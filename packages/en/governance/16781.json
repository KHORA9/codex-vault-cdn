Edited by Thomas Jefferson Randolph.”\r\n\r\n     In conformity to the act of the Congress of the United\r\n     States, entitled “An act for the encouragement of learning,\r\n     by securing the copies of maps, charts, and books, to the\r\n     authors and proprietors of such copies, during the times\r\n     therein mentioned.”\r\n\r\n     RD. JEFFRIES, Clerk of the Eastern District of Virginia.\r\n\r\n     CAMBRIDGE: E. W. Metcalf & Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe opinion universally entertained of the extraordinary abilities of\r\nThomas Jefferson, and the signal evidence given by his country, of a\r\nprofound sense of his patriotic services, and of veneration for his\r\nmemory, have induced the Editor, who is both his Executor and the\r\nLegatee of his Manuscript Papers, to believe that an extensive\r\npublication from them would be particularly acceptable to the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe Memoir, contained in the first volume, commences with circumstantial\r\nnotices of his earliest life; and is continued to his arrival in New\r\nYork, in March, 1790, when he entered on the duties of the Department of\r\nState, of which he had been just appointed Secretary.\r\n\r\nFrom the aspect of the Memoir, it may be presumed that parts of it, at\r\nleast, had been written for his own and his family’s use only; and in a\r\nstyle without the finish of his revising pen. There is, however, no part\r\nof it, minute and personal as it may be, which the Reader would wish\r\nto have been passed over by the Editor; whilst not a few parts of that\r\ndescription will, by some, be regarded with a particular interest.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the Memoir, succeeding the biographical pages, may be\r\ndesignated as follows:\r\n\r\nI. General facts and anecdotes relating to the origin and early stages\r\nof the contest with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nII. Historical circumstances relating to the Confederation of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIII. Facts and anecdotes, local and general, preliminary to the\r\nDeclaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nIV. An exact account of the circumstances attending that memorable act,\r\nin its preparation and its progress through Congress; with a copy\r\nfrom the original draught, _in the hand-writing of the Author;_ and a\r\nparallel column, in the same hand, showing the alterations made in the\r\ndraught by Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Memoir will be considered not a little enriched by the Debates in\r\nCongress, on the great question of Independence, as they were taken down\r\nby Mr. Jefferson at the time, and which, though in a compressed form,\r\npresent the substance of what passed on that memorable occasion.\r\nThis portion of the work derives peculiar value from its perfect\r\nauthenticity, being all in the hand-writing of that distinguished member\r\nof the body; from the certainty that this is the first disclosure to the\r\nworld of those Debates; and from the probability, or rather certainty,\r\nthat a like knowledge of them is not to be expected from any other\r\nsource. The same remarks are applicable to the Debates in the same\r\nCongress, preserved in the same manner, on two of the original Articles\r\nof Confederation. The first is the Article fixing the rate of assessing\r\nthe quotas of supply to the common Treasury: the second is the Article\r\nwhich declares, “that in determining questions, each Colony shall have\r\none vote.” The Debates on both are not only interesting in themselves,\r\nbut curious, also, in relation to like discussions of the same subjects\r\non subsequent occasions.\r\n\r\nV. Views of the connections and transactions of the United States with\r\nforeign nations, at different periods; particularly, a narrative, with\r\nmany details, personal and political, of the causes and early course of\r\nthe French Revolution, as exhibited to the observation of the Author,\r\nduring his diplomatic residence at Paris. The narrative, with the\r\nintermingled reflections on the character and consequences of that\r\nRevolution, fills a considerable space in the Memoir, and forms a very\r\nimportant part of it.\r\n\r\nVI. Within the body of the Memoir, or referred to as an appendix, are\r\nother papers which were thought well entitled to the place they occupy.\r\nAmong them, are, 1. A paper drawn up in the year 1774, as “Instructions\r\nto our Delegates in Congress.” Though heretofore in print, it will be\r\nnew to most readers; and will be regarded by all, as the most ample and\r\nprecise enumeration of British violations that had then appeared, or,\r\nperhaps, that has since been presented in a form at once so compact\r\nand so complete. 2. A Penal Code, being part of a Revised Code of Laws,\r\nprepared by appointment of the Legislature of Virginia, in 1776, with\r\nreference to the Republican form of Government, and to the principles of\r\nhumanity congenial therewith, and with the improving spirit of the age.\r\nAnnexed to the several articles, are explanatory and other remarks of\r\nthe Author, worthy of being preserved by the aid of the press. 3. A\r\nhistorical and critical review of the repeal of the laws establishing\r\nthe Church in Virginia; which was followed by the “Act for establishing\r\nreligious freedom.” This act, it is well known, was always held by Mr.\r\nJefferson to be one of his best efforts in the cause of liberty, to\r\nwhich he was devoted: and it is certainly the strongest legal barrier\r\nthat could be erected against a connection between Church and State,\r\nso fatal in its tendency to the purity of both. 4. An elaborate paper\r\nconcerning a Money Unit, prepared in the year 1784, and which laid the\r\nfoundation of the system adopted by Congress, for a coinage and money of\r\naccount. For other particulars, not here noted, the Reader is referred\r\nto the volume itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe termination of the Memoir, at the date mentioned, by the Author, may\r\nbe explained by the laborious tasks assumed or not declined by him, on\r\nhis return to private life; which, with his great age, did not permit\r\nhim to reduce his materials into a state proper to be embodied in such a\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe other volumes contain, I. Letters from 1775, to his death, addressed\r\nto a very great variety of individuals; and comprising a range of\r\ninformation, and, in many instances, regular essays, on subjects of\r\nHistory, Politics, Science, Morals, and Religion. The letters to him\r\nare omitted, except in a very few instances, where it was supposed their\r\npublication would be generally acceptable, from the important character\r\nof the communication, or the general interest in the views of the\r\nwriter; or where the whole or a part of a letter had been filed for the\r\nbetter understanding of the answer.\r\n\r\nIn these cases, such letters are inserted in the body of the work, or\r\nin an appendix, as their importance, and connection with the subject\r\ndiscussed by the author, rendered advisable. And where inferences from\r\nthe tenor of the answer, might in any way affect the correspondent,\r\nhis name does not appear in the copy filed. The historical parts of the\r\nletters, and the entire publication, have the rare value of coming\r\nfrom one of the chief actors himself, and of being written, not for the\r\npublic eye, but in the freedom and confidence of private friendship.\r\n\r\nII. Notes of conversations, whilst Secretary of State, with President\r\nWashington, and others high in office; and memoranda of Cabinet\r\nCouncils, committed to paper on the spot, and filed; the whole, with\r\nthe explanatory and miscellaneous additions, showing the views and\r\ntendencies of parties, from the year 1789 to 1800.\r\n\r\nAppended to the publication, is a ‘Facsimile’ of the rough draught of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, in which will be seen the erasures,\r\ninterlineations, and additions of Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams, two of the\r\nappointed Committee, in the handwriting of each.\r\n\r\nThe Editor, though he cannot be insensible to the genius, the learning,\r\nthe philosophic inspiration, the generous devotion to virtue, and the\r\nlove of country, displayed in the writings now committed to the press,\r\nis restrained, not less by his incompetency, than by his relation to the\r\nAuthor, from dwelling on themes which belong to an eloquence that can do\r\njustice to the names of illustrious benefactors to their country and to\r\ntheir fellow men.\r\n\r\nAlbemarle, Va., January, 1829.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Page One of Jefferson’s Memoir, page001]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMOIR.\r\n\r\nJanuary 6, 1821. At the age of 77, I begin to make some memoranda, and\r\nstate some recollections of dates and facts concerning myself, for my\r\nown more ready reference, and for the information of my family.\r\n\r\nThe tradition in my father’s family was, that their ancestor came to\r\nthis country from Wales, and from near the mountain of Snowden, the\r\nhighest in Great Britain. I noted once a case from Wales, in the law\r\nreports, where a person of our name was either plaintiff or defendant;\r\nand one of the same name was secretary to the Virginia Company. These\r\nare the only instances in which I have met with the name in that\r\ncountry. I have found it in our early records; but the first particular\r\ninformation I have of any ancestor was of my grandfather, who lived\r\nat the place in Chesterfield called Ozborne’s, and owned the lands\r\nafterwards the glebe of the parish. He had three sons; Thomas who died\r\nyoung, Field who settled on the waters of Roanoke and left numerous\r\ndescendants, and Peter, my father, who settled on the lands I still own,\r\ncalled Shadwell, adjoining my present residence. He was born February\r\n29, 1707-8, and intermarried 1739, with Jane Randolph, of the age of\r\n19, daughter of Isham Randolph, one of the seven sons of that name and\r\nfamily settled at Dungeoness in Goochland. They trace their pedigree far\r\nback in England and Scotland, to which let every one ascribe the faith\r\nand merit he chooses.\r\n\r\nMy father’s education had been quite neglected; but being of a strong\r\nmind, sound judgment, and eager after information, he read much\r\nand improved himself, insomuch that he was chosen, with Joshua Fry,\r\nprofessor of Mathematics in William and Mary college, to continue the\r\nboundary line between Virginia and North Carolina, which had been begun\r\nby Colonel Byrd; and was afterwards employed with the same Mr. Fry, to\r\nmake the first map of Virginia which had ever been made, that of Captain\r\nSmith being merely a conjectural sketch. They possessed excellent\r\nmaterials for so much of the country as is below the Blue Ridge; little\r\nbeing then known beyond that Ridge. He was the third or fourth settler,\r\nabout the year 1737, of the part of the country in which I live. He died\r\nAugust 17th, 1757, leaving my mother a widow, who lived till 1776, with\r\nsix daughters and two sons, myself the elder. To my younger brother\r\nhe left his estate on James river, called Snowden, after the supposed\r\nbirth-place of the family: to myself, the lands on which I was born and\r\nlive. He placed me at the English school at five years of age; and at\r\nthe Latin at nine, where I continued until his death. My teacher, Mr.\r\nDouglas, a clergyman from Scotland, with the rudiments of the Latin and\r\nGreek languages, taught me the French; and on the death of my father, I\r\nwent to the Reverend Mr. Maury, a correct classical scholar, with whom\r\nI continued two years; and then, to wit, in the spring of 1760, went to\r\nWilliam and Mary college, where I continued two years. It was my great\r\ngood fortune, and what probably fixed the destinies of my life, that\r\nDr. William Small of Scotland was then professor of Mathematics, a man\r\nprofound in most of the useful branches of science, with a happy talent\r\nof communication, correct and gentlemanly manners, and an enlarged and\r\nliberal mind. He, most happily for me, became soon attached to me, and\r\nmade me his daily companion when not engaged in the school; and from his\r\nconversation I got my first views of the expansion of science, and\r\nof the system of things in which we are placed. Fortunately, the\r\nphilosophical chair became vacant soon after my arrival at college, and\r\nhe was appointed to fill it per interim: and he was the first who ever\r\ngave, in that college, regular lectures in Ethics, Rhetoric, and Belles\r\nlettres. He returned to Europe in 1762, having previously filled up\r\nthe measure of his goodness to me, by procuring for me, from his most\r\nintimate friend George Wythe, a reception as a student of Law, under his\r\ndirection, and introduced me to the acquaintance and familiar table of\r\nGovenor Fauquier, the ablest man who had ever filled that office.\r\nWith him, and at his table, Dr. Small and Mr. Wythe, his _amici omnium\r\nhorarum,_ and myself, formed a _partie quarrée,_ and to the habitual\r\nconversations on these occasions I owed much instruction. Mr. Wythe\r\ncontinued to be my faithful and beloved Mentor in youth, and my most\r\naffectionate friend through life. In 1767, he led me into the practice\r\nof the law at the bar of the General Court, at which I continued until\r\nthe Revolution shut up the courts of justice.*\r\n\r\n     * For a sketch of the life and character of Mr. Wythe, see\r\n     my letter of August 31, 1820, to Mr. John Saunderson. [See\r\n     Appendix, note A.]\r\n\r\nIn 1769, I became a member of the legislature by the choice of the\r\ncounty in which I live, and so continued until it was closed by the\r\nRevolution. I made one effort in that body for the permission of the\r\nemancipation of slaves, which was rejected: and indeed, during the\r\nregal government, nothing liberal could expect success. Our minds were\r\ncircumscribed within narrow limits, by an habitual belief that it was\r\nour duty to be subordinate to the mother country in all matters of\r\ngovernment, to direct all our labors in subservience to her interests,\r\nand even to observe a bigoted intolerance for all religions but hers.\r\nThe difficulties with our representatives were of habit and despair,\r\nnot of reflection and conviction. Experience soon proved that they could\r\nbring their minds to rights, on the first summons of their attention.\r\nBut the King’s Council, which acted as another house of legislature,\r\nheld their places at will, and were in most humble obedience to that\r\nwill: the Governor too, who had a negative on our laws, held by the same\r\ntenure, and with still greater devotedness to it: and, last of all, the\r\nRoyal negative closed the last door to every hope of melioration.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1772, I was married to Martha Skelton, widow of\r\nBathurst Skelton, and daughter of John Wayles, then twenty-three\r\nyears old. Mr. Wayles was a lawyer of much practice, to which he\r\nwas introduced more by his great industry, punctuality and practical\r\nreadiness, than by eminence in the science of his profession. He was\r\na most agreeable companion, full of pleasantry and good humor, and\r\nwelcomed in every society. He acquired a handsome fortune, and died in\r\nMay, 1773, leaving three daughters: the portion which came on that\r\nevent to Mrs. Jefferson, after the debts should be paid, which were\r\nvery considerable, was about equal to my own patrimony, and consequently\r\ndoubled the ease of our circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen the famous Resolutions of 1765, against the Stamp-act, were\r\nproposed, I was yet a student of law in Williamsburg. I attended the\r\ndebate, however, at the door of the lobby of the House of Burgesses, and\r\nheard the splendid display of Mr. Henry’s talents as a popular orator.\r\nThey were great indeed; such as I have never heard from any other man.\r\nHe appeared to me, to speak as Homer wrote. Mr. Johnson, a lawyer, and\r\nmember from the Northern Neck, seconded the resolutions, and by him the\r\nlearning and logic of the case were chiefly maintained. My recollections\r\nof these transactions may be seen page 60 of the “Life of Patrick\r\nHenry,” by Wirt, to whom I furnished them.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1769, a meeting of the General Assembly was called by the\r\nGovernor, Lord Botetourt. I had then become a member; and to that\r\nmeeting became known the joint resolutions and address of the Lords\r\nand Commons of 1768-9, on the proceedings in Massachusetts.\r\nCounter-resolutions, and an address to the King by the House of\r\nBurgesses, were agreed to with little opposition, and a spirit\r\nmanifestly displayed itself of considering the cause of Massachusetts as\r\na common one. The Governor dissolved us: but we met the next day in\r\nthe Apollo* of the Raleigh tavern, formed ourselves into a voluntary\r\nconvention, drew up articles of association against the use of any\r\nmerchandise imported from Great Britain, signed and recommended them\r\nto the people, repaired to our several counties, and were re-elected\r\nwithout any other exception than of the very few who had declined assent\r\nto our proceedings.\r\n\r\n     * The name of a public room in the Raleigh.\r\n\r\nNothing of particular excitement occurring for a considerable time,\r\nour countrymen seemed to fall into a state of insensibility to our\r\nsituation; the duty on tea, not yet repealed, and the declaratory act of\r\na right in the British Parliament, to bind us by their laws in all cases\r\nwhatsoever, still suspended over us. But a court of inquiry held in\r\nRhode Island in 1762, with a power to send persons to England to be\r\ntried for offences committed here, was considered, at our session of the\r\nspring of 1773, as demanding attention. Not thinking our old and\r\nleading members up to the point of forwardness and zeal which the times\r\nrequired, Mr. Henry, Richard Henry Lee, Francis L. Lee, Mr. Carr, and\r\nmyself agreed to meet in the evening, in a private room of the Raleigh,\r\nto consult on the state of things. There may have been a member or two\r\nmore whom I do not recollect. We were all sensible that the most urgent\r\nof all measures was that of coming to an understanding with all the\r\nother colonies, to consider the British claims as a common cause to all,\r\nand to produce a unity of action: and for this purpose that a committee\r\nof correspondence in each colony would be the best instrument for\r\nintercommunication: and that their first measure would probably be, to\r\npropose a meeting of deputies from every colony, at some central place,\r\nwho should be charged with the direction of the measures which should be\r\ntaken by all. We therefore drew up the resolutions which may be seen in\r\nWirt, page 87. The consulting members proposed to me to move them, but I\r\nurged that it should be done by Mr. Carr, my friend and brother-in-law,\r\nthen a new member, to whom I wished an opportunity should be given of\r\nmaking known to the house his great worth and talents. It was so agreed;\r\nhe moved them, they were agreed to _nem. con._ and a committee of\r\ncorrespondence appointed, of whom Peyton Randolph, the speaker, was\r\nchairman.\r\n\r\nThe Governor (then Lord Dunmore) dissolved us, but the committee met\r\nthe next day, prepared a circular letter to the speakers, of the other\r\ncolonies, inclosing to each a copy of the resolutions, and left it in\r\ncharge with their chairman to forward them by expresses.\r\n\r\nThe origination of these committees of correspondence between the\r\ncolonies, has been since claimed for Massachusetts, and Marshall * has\r\ngiven in to this error, although the very note of his appendix to which\r\nhe refers, shows that their establishment was confined to their own\r\ntowns. This matter will be seen clearly stated in a letter of Samuel\r\nAdams Wells to me of April 2nd, 1819, and my answer of May 12th. I was\r\ncorrected by the letter of Mr. Wells in the information I had given\r\nMr. Wirt, as stated in his note, page 87, that the messengers of\r\nMassachusetts and Virginia crossed each other on the way, bearing\r\nsimilar propositions; for Mr. Wells shows that Massachusetts did not\r\nadopt the measure, but on the receipt of our proposition, delivered at\r\ntheir next session. Their message, therefore, which passed ours, must\r\nhave related to something else, for I well remember Peyton Randolph’s\r\ninforming me of the crossing of our messengers. **\r\n\r\n     * Life of Washington, vol. ii. p. 151.\r\n     ** See Appendix, note B.\r\n\r\nThe next event which excited our sympathies for Massachusetts, was the\r\nBoston port bill, by which that port was to be shut up on the 1st of\r\nJune, 1774. This arrived while we were in session in the spring of that\r\nyear. The lead in the House, on these subjects, being no longer left to\r\nthe old members, Mr. Henry, R. H. Lee, Fr. L. Lee, three or four other\r\nmembers, whom I do not recollect, and myself, agreeing that we must\r\nboldly take an unequivocal stand in the line with Massachusetts,\r\ndetermined to meet and consult on the proper measures, in the council\r\nchamber, for the benefit of the library in that room. We were under\r\nconviction of the necessity of arousing our people from the lethargy\r\ninto which they had fallen, as to passing events; and thought that the\r\nappointment of a day of general fasting and prayer, would be most likely\r\nto call up and alarm their attention. No example of such a solemnity had\r\nexisted since the days of our distress in the war of ‘55, since which\r\na new generation had grown up. With the help, therefore, of Rushworth,\r\nwhom we rummaged over for the revolutionary precedents and forms of\r\nthe Puritans of that day, preserved by him, we cooked up a resolution,\r\nsomewhat modernizing their phrases, for appointing the 1st day of\r\nJune, on which the port bill was to commence, for a day of fasting,\r\nhumiliation, and prayer, to implore Heaven to avert from us the evils of\r\ncivil war, to inspire us with firmness in support of our rights, and to\r\nturn the hearts of the King and Parliament to moderation and justice.\r\nTo give greater emphasis to our proposition, we agreed to wait the next\r\nmorning on Mr. Nicholas, whose grave and religious character was more in\r\nunison with the tone of our resolution, and to solicit him to move it.\r\nWe accordingly went to him in the morning. He moved it the same day; the\r\n1st of June was proposed; and it passed without opposition. The Governor\r\ndissolved us, as usual. We retired to the Apollo, as before, agreed\r\nto an association, and instructed the committee of correspondence\r\nto propose to the corresponding committees of the other colonies, to\r\nappoint deputies to meet in Congress at such place, annually, as should\r\nbe convenient, to direct, from time to time, the measures required by\r\nthe general interest: and we declared that an attack on any one colony\r\nshould be considered as an attack on the whole. This was in May. We\r\nfurther recommended to the several counties to elect deputies to meet\r\nat Williamsburg, the 1st of August ensuing, to consider the state of\r\nthe colony, and particularly to appoint delegates to a general Congress,\r\nshould that measure be acceded to by the committees of correspondence\r\ngenerally. It was acceded to; Philadelphia was appointed for the place,\r\nand the 5th of September for the time of meeting. We returned home, and\r\nin our several counties invited the clergy to meet assemblies of the\r\npeople on the 1st of June, to perform the ceremonies of the day, and\r\nto address to them discourses suited to the occasion. The people met\r\ngenerally, with anxiety and alarm in their countenances, and the effect\r\nof the day, through the whole colony, was like a shock of electricity,\r\narousing every man and placing him erect and solidly on his centre. They\r\nchose, universally, delegates for the convention. Being elected one for\r\nmy own county, I prepared a draught of instructions to be given to the\r\ndelegates whom we should send to the Congress, which I meant to propose\r\nat our meeting. [See Appendix, note C.] In this I took the ground that,\r\nfrom the beginning, I had thought the only one orthodox or tenable,\r\nwhich was, that the relation between Great Britain and these colonies\r\nwas exactly the same as that of England and Scotland, after the\r\naccession of James and until the union, and the same as her present\r\nrelations with Hanover, having the same executive chief, but no other\r\nnecessary political connection; and that our emigration from England to\r\nthis country gave her no more rights over us, than the emigrations\r\nof the Danes and Saxons gave to the present authorities of the mother\r\ncountry, over England. In this doctrine, however, I had never been able\r\nto get any one to agree with me but Mr. Wythe. He concurred in it from\r\nthe first dawn of the question, What was the political relation between\r\nus and England? Our other patriots, Randolph, the Lees, Nicholas,\r\nPendleton, stopped at the half-way house of John Dickinson, who admitted\r\nthat England had a right to regulate our commerce, and to lay duties on\r\nit for the purposes of regulation, but not of raising revenue. But for\r\nthis ground there was no foundation in compact, in any acknowledged\r\nprinciples of colonization, nor in reason: expatriation being a natural\r\nright, and acted on as such, by all nations, in all ages. I set out for\r\nWilliamsburg some days before that appointed for the meeting, but taken\r\nill of a dysentery on the road, and was unable to proceed, I sent on,\r\ntherefore, to Williamsburg two copies of my draught, the one under cover\r\nto Peyton Randolph, who I knew would be in the of the convention, the\r\nother to Patrick Henry. Whether Mr. Henry disapproved the ground taken,\r\nor was too lazy to read it (for he was the laziest man in reading I ever\r\nknew) I never learned: but he communicated it to nobody. Peyton Randolph\r\ninformed the convention he had received such a paper from a member,\r\nprevented by sickness from offering it in his place, and he laid it on\r\nthe table for perusal. It was read generally by the members, approved by\r\nmany, though thought too bold for the present state of things; but they\r\nprinted it in pamphlet form, under the title of ‘A Summary View of the\r\nRights of British America.’ It found its way to England, was taken up\r\nby the opposition, interpolated a little by Mr. Burke so as to make it\r\nanswer opposition purposes, and in that form ran rapidly through several\r\neditions. This information I had from Parson Hurt, who happened at the\r\ntime to be in London, whither he had gone to receive clerical orders;\r\nand I was informed afterwards by Peyton Randolph, that it had procured\r\nme the honor of having my name inserted in a long list of proscriptions,\r\nenrolled in a bill of attainder commenced in one of the Houses of\r\nParliament, but suppressed in embryo by the hasty step of events, which\r\nwarned them to be a little cautious. Montague, agent of the House of\r\nBurgesses in England, made extracts from the bill, copied the names, and\r\nsent them to Peyton Randolph. The names I think were about twenty,\r\nwhich he repeated to me, but I recollect those only of Hancock, the\r\ntwo Adamses, Peyton Randolph himself, Patrick Henry, and myself.*\r\nThe convention met on the 1st of August, renewed their association,\r\nappointed delegates to the Congress, gave them instructions very\r\ntemperately and properly expressed, both as to style and matter; **\r\nand they repaired to Philadelphia at the time appointed. The splendid\r\nproceedings of that Congress, at their first session, belong to general\r\nhistory, are known to every one, and need not therefore be noted here.\r\nThey terminated their session on the 26th of October, to meet again on\r\nthe 10th of May ensuing. The convention, at their ensuing session\r\nof March ‘75, approved of the proceedings of Congress, thanked their\r\ndelegates, and reappointed the same persons to represent the colony\r\nat the meeting to be held in May: and foreseeing the probability that\r\nPeyton Randolph, their president, and speaker also of the House of\r\nBurgesses, might be called off, they added me, in that event, to the\r\ndelegation.\r\n\r\n     * See Girardin’s History of Virginia, Appendix No. 12. note.\r\n     ** See Appendix, note D.\r\n\r\nMr. Randolph was according to expectation obliged the chair of Congress,\r\nto attend the General Assembly summoned by Lord Dunmore, to meet on the\r\n1st day of June,1775. Lord North’s conciliatory propositions, as they\r\nwere called received by the Governor, and furnished the subject for\r\nwhich this assembly was convened. Mr. Randolph accordingly attended, and\r\nthe tenor of these propositions being generally known, as having been\r\naddressed to all the governors, he was anxious that the answer of our\r\nAssembly, likely to be the first, should harmonise with what he knew to\r\nbe the sentiments and wishes of the body he had recently left. He feared\r\nthat Mr. Nicholas, whose mind was not yet up to the mark of the times,\r\nwould undertake the answer, and therefore pressed me to prepare it. I\r\ndid so, and, with his aid, carried it through the House, with long and\r\ndoubtful scruples from Mr. Nicholas and James Mercer, and a dash of cold\r\nwater on it here and there, enfeebling it somewhat, but finally with\r\nunanimity, or a vote approaching it. This being passed, I repaired\r\nimmediately to Philadelphia, and conveyed to Congress the first notice\r\nthey had of it. It was entirely approved there. I took my seat with them\r\non the 21st of June. On the 24th, a committee which had been appointed\r\nto prepare a declaration of the causes of taking up arms, brought in\r\ntheir report (drawn, I believe, by J. Rutledge) which, not being liked,\r\nthe House recommitted it, on the 26th, and added Mr. Dickinson and\r\nmyself to the committee. On the rising of the House, the committee\r\nhaving not yet met, I happened to find myself near Governor W.\r\nLivingston, and proposed to him to draw the paper. He excused himself\r\nand proposed that I should draw it. On my pressing him with urgency, ‘We\r\nare as yet but new acquaintances, sir,’ said he, ‘why are you so earnest\r\nfor my doing it?’ ‘Because,’ said I, ‘I have been informed that you drew\r\nthe Address to the people of Great Britain, a production, certainly, of\r\nthe finest pen in America.’ ‘On that,’ says he, ‘perhaps, sir, you may\r\nnot have been correctly informed.’ I had received the information in\r\nVirginia from Colonel Harrison on his return from that Congress. Lee,\r\nLivingston, and Jay had been the committee for the draught. The first,\r\nprepared by Lee, had been disapproved and recommitted. The second\r\nwas drawn by Jay, but being presented by Governor Livingston, had led\r\nColonel Harrison into the error. The next morning, walking in the hall\r\nof Congress, many members being assembled, but the House formed, I\r\nobserved Mr. Jay speaking to R. H. Lee, and leading him by the button of\r\nhis coat to me. ‘I understand, sir,’ said he to me, ‘that this gentleman\r\ninformed you, that Governor Livingston drew the Address to the people\r\nof Great Britain.’ I assured him at once that I had not received that\r\ninformation from Mr. Lee and that not a word had ever passed on the\r\nsubject between Mr. Lee and myself; and after some explanations the\r\nsubject was dropped. These gentlemen had had some sparrings in debate\r\nbefore, and continued ever very hostile to each other.\r\n\r\nI prepared a draught of the declaration committed to us. It was too\r\nstrong for Mr. Dickinson. He still retained the hope of reconciliation\r\nwith the mother country, and was unwilling it should be lessened by\r\noffensive statements. He was so honest a man, and so able a one, that he\r\nwas greatly indulged even by those who could not feel his scruples. We\r\ntherefore requested him to take the paper, and put it into a form\r\nhe could approve. He did so, preparing an entire new statement, and\r\npreserving of the former only the last four paragraphs and half of the\r\npreceding one. We approved and reported it to Congress, who accepted it.\r\nCongress gave a signal proof of their indulgence to Mr. Dickinson, and\r\nof their great desire not to go too fast for any respectable part of\r\nour body, in permitting him to draw their second petition to the King\r\naccording to his own ideas, and passing it with scarcely any amendment.\r\nThe disgust against its humility was general; and Mr. Dickinson’s\r\ndelight at its passage was the only circumstance which reconciled them\r\nto it. The vote being passed, although further observation on it was\r\nout of order, he could not refrain from rising and expressing his\r\nsatisfaction, and concluded by saying, ‘There is but one word, Mr.\r\nPresident, in the paper which I disapprove, and that is the word\r\nCongress;’ on which Ben Harrison rose and said, ‘There is but one word\r\nin the paper, Mr. President, of which I approve, and that is the word\r\nCongress?’\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of July, Dr. Franklin, Mr. Adams, R. H. Lee, and myself\r\nwere appointed a committee to consider and report on Lord North’s\r\nconciliatory resolution. The answer of the Virginia Assembly on that\r\nsubject having been approved, I was requested by the committee to\r\nprepare this report, which will account for the similarity of feature in\r\nthe two instruments.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of May, 1776, the convention of Virginia instructed their\r\ndelegates in Congress, to propose to that body to declare the colonies\r\nindependent of Great Britain, and appointed a committee to prepare a\r\ndeclaration of rights and plan of government.\r\n\r\n     Here, in the original manuscript, commence the ‘two\r\n     preceding sheets’ referred to by Mr. Jefferson, page 21, as\r\n     containing ‘notes’ taken by him ‘whilst these things were\r\n     going on.’ They are easily distinguished from the body of\r\n     the MS. in which they were inserted by him, being of a paper\r\n     very different in size, quality, and color, from that on\r\n     which the latter is written:\r\n\r\nIn Congress, Friday, June 7, 1776. The delegates from Virginia moved,\r\nin obedience to instructions from their constituents, that the Congress\r\nshould declare that these United Colonies and of right ought to be, free\r\nand independent states, that they are absolved from all allegiance to\r\nthe British crown, and that all political connection between them and\r\nthe state of Great Britain is and ought to be, totally dissolved; that\r\nmeasures should be immediately taken for procuring the assistance of\r\nforeign powers and a confederation be formed to bind the colonial more\r\nclosely together.\r\n\r\nThe House being obliged to attend at that time to some other business,\r\nthe proposition was referred to the next day, when the members were\r\nordered to attend punctually at ten o’clock.\r\n\r\nSaturday, June 8. They proceeded to take it into consideration, and\r\nreferred it to a committee of the whole, into which they immediately\r\nresolved themselves, and passed that day and Monday the 10th in debating\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nIt was argued by Wilson, Robert R. Livingston, E. Rutledge, Dickinson,\r\nand others--\r\n\r\nThat, though they were friends to the measures themselves, and saw the\r\nimpossibility that we should ever again be united with Great Britain,\r\nyet they were against adopting them at this time:\r\n\r\nThat the conduct we had formerly observed was wise and proper now, of\r\ndeferring to take any capital step till the voice of the people drove us\r\ninto it:\r\n\r\nThat they were our power, and without them our declarations could not be\r\ncarried into effect:\r\n\r\nThat the people of the middle colonies (Maryland, Delaware,\r\nPennsylvania, the Jerseys, and New York) were not yet ripe for bidding\r\nadieu to British connection, but that they were fast ripening, and, in a\r\nshort time, would join in the general voice of America:\r\n\r\nThat the resolution, entered into by this House on the 15th of May,\r\nfor suppressing the exercise of all powers derived from the crown, had\r\nshown, by the ferment into which it had thrown these middle colonies,\r\nthat they had not yet accommodated their minds to a separation from the\r\nmother country:\r\n\r\nThat some of them had expressly forbidden their delegates to consent\r\nto such a declaration, and others had given no instructions, and\r\nconsequently no powers to give such consent:\r\n\r\nThat if the delegates of any particular colony had no power to declare\r\nsuch colony independent, certain they were, the others could not declare\r\nit for them; the colonies being as yet perfectly independent of each\r\nother:\r\n\r\nThat the assembly of Pennsylvania was now sitting above stairs, their\r\nconvention would sit within a few days, the convention of New York was\r\nnow sitting, and those of the Jerseys and Delaware counties would meet\r\non the Monday following, and it was probable these bodies would take up\r\nthe question of Independence, and would declare to their delegates the\r\nvoice of their state:\r\n\r\nThat if such a declaration should now be agreed to, these delegates must\r\nretire, and possibly their colonies might secede from the Union:\r\n\r\nThat such a secession would weaken us more than could be compensated by\r\nany foreign alliance:\r\n\r\nThat in the event of such a division, foreign powers would either refuse\r\nto join themselves to our fortunes, or, having us so much in their power\r\nas that desperate declaration would place us, they would insist on terms\r\nproportionably more hard and prejudicial:\r\n\r\nThat we had little reason to expect an alliance with those to whom\r\nalone, as yet, we had cast our eyes:\r\n\r\nThat France and Spain had reason to be jealous of that rising power,\r\nwhich would one day certainly strip them of all their American\r\npossessions:\r\n\r\nThat it was more likely they should form a connection with the British\r\nCourt, who, if they should find themselves unable otherwise to extricate\r\nthemselves from their difficulties, would agree to a partition of our\r\nterritories, restoring Canada to France, and the Floridas to Spain, to\r\naccomplish for themselves a recovery of these colonies:\r\n\r\nThat it would not be long before we should receive certain information\r\nof the disposition of the French court, from the agent whom we had sent\r\nto Paris for that purpose:\r\n\r\nThat if this disposition should be favorable, by waiting the event of\r\nthe present campaign, which we all hoped would be successful, we should\r\nhave reason to expect an alliance on better terms:\r\n\r\nThat this would in fact work no delay of any effectual aid from such\r\nally, as, from the advance of the season and distance of our situation,\r\nit was impossible we could receive any assistance during this campaign:\r\n\r\nThat it was prudent to fix among ourselves the terms on which we would\r\nform alliance, before we declared we would form one at all events:\r\n\r\nAnd that if these were agreed on, and our Declaration of Independence\r\nready by the time our Ambassador should be prepared to sail, it would be\r\nas well, as to go into that Declaration at this day.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, it was urged by J. Adams, Lee, Wythe and others, that\r\nno gentleman had argued against the policy or the right of separation\r\nfrom Britain, nor had supposed it possible we should ever renew our\r\nconnection; that they had only opposed its being now declared:\r\n\r\nThat the question was not whether, by a Declaration of Independence, we\r\nshould make ourselves what we are not; but whether we should declare a\r\nfact which already exists:\r\n\r\nThat, as to the people or parliament of England, we had always been\r\nindependent of them, their restraints on our trade deriving efficacy\r\nfrom our acquiescence only, and not from any rights they possessed of\r\nimposing them, and that so far, our connection had been federal only,\r\nand was now dissolved by the commencement of hostilities:\r\n\r\nThat, as to the King, we had been bound to him by allegiance, but that\r\nthis bond was now dissolved by his assent to the late act of parliament,\r\nby which he declares us out of his protection, and by his levying war on\r\nus, a fact which had long ago proved us out of his protection; it\r\nbeing a certain position in law, that allegiance and protection are\r\nreciprocal, the one ceasing when the other is withdrawn:\r\n\r\nThat James the II. never declared the people of England out of his\r\nprotection, yet his actions proved it and the parliament declared it:\r\n\r\nNo delegates then can be denied, or ever want, a power of declaring an\r\nexistent truth:\r\n\r\nThat the delegates from the Delaware counties having declared their\r\nconstituents ready to join, there are only two colonies, Pennsylvania\r\nand Maryland, whose delegates are absolutely tied up, and that these\r\nhad, by their instructions, only reserved a right of confirming or\r\nrejecting the measure:\r\n\r\nThat the instructions from Pennsylvania might be accounted for from the\r\ntimes in which they were drawn, near a twelvemonth ago, since which the\r\nface of affairs has totally changed:\r\n\r\nThat within that time, it had become apparent that Britain was\r\ndetermined to accept nothing less than a _carte-blanche,_ and that the\r\nKing’s answer to the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of London,\r\nwhich had come to hand four days ago, must have satisfied every one of\r\nthis point:\r\n\r\nThat the people wait for us to lead the way:\r\n\r\nThat they are in favor of the measure, though the instructions given by\r\nsome of their representatives are not:\r\n\r\nThat the voice of the representatives is not always consonant with\r\nthe voice of the people, and that this is remarkably the case in these\r\nmiddle colonies:\r\n\r\nThat the effect of the resolution of the 15th of May has proved this,\r\nwhich, raising the murmurs of some in the colonies of Pennsylvania\r\nand Maryland, called forth the opposing voice of the freer part of the\r\npeople, and proved them to be the majority even in these colonies:\r\n\r\nThat the backwardness of these two colonies might be ascribed, partly to\r\nthe influence of proprietary power and connections, and partly, to their\r\nhaving not yet been attacked by the enemy:\r\n\r\nThat these causes were not likely to be soon removed, as there seemed no\r\nprobability that the enemy would make either of these the seat of this\r\nsummer’s war:\r\n\r\nThat it would be vain to wait either weeks or months for perfect\r\nunanimity, since it was impossible that all men should ever become of\r\none sentiment on any question:\r\n\r\nThat the conduct of some colonies, from the beginning of this contest,\r\nhad given reason to suspect it was their settled policy to keep in the\r\nrear of the confederacy, that their particular prospect might be better,\r\neven in the worst event:\r\n\r\nThat, therefore, it was necessary for those colonies who had thrown\r\nthemselves forward and hazarded all from the beginning, to come forward\r\nnow also, and put all again to their own hazard:\r\n\r\nThat the history of the Dutch revolution, of whom three states only\r\nconfederated at first, proved that a secession of some colonies would\r\nnot be so dangerous as some apprehended:\r\n\r\nThat a declaration of Independence alone could render it consistent\r\nwith European delicacy, for European powers to treat with us, or even to\r\nreceive an Ambassador from us:\r\n\r\nThat till this, they would not receive our vessels into their ports,\r\nnor acknowledge the adjudications of our courts of admiralty to be\r\nlegitimate, in cases of capture of British vessels:\r\n\r\nThat though France and Spain may be jealous of our rising power, they\r\nmust think it will be much more formidable with the addition of\r\nGreat Britain; and will therefore see it their interest to prevent a\r\ncoalition; but should they refuse, we shall be but where we are; whereas\r\nwithout trying, we shall never know whether they will aid us or not:\r\n\r\nThat the present campaign may be unsuccessful, and therefore we had\r\nbetter propose an alliance while our affairs wear a hopeful aspect:\r\n\r\nThat to wait the event of this campaign will certainly work delay,\r\nbecause, during this summer, France may assist us effectually, by\r\ncutting off those supplies of provisions from England and Ireland, on\r\nwhich the enemy’s armies here are to depend; or by setting in motion\r\nthe great power they have collected in the West Indies, and calling our\r\nenemy to the defence of the possessions they have there:\r\n\r\nThat it would be idle to lose time in settling the terms of alliance,\r\ntill we had first determined we would enter into alliance:\r\n\r\nThat it is necessary to lose no time in opening a trade for our people,\r\nwho will want clothes, and will want money too, for the payment of\r\ntaxes:\r\n\r\nAnd that the only misfortune is, that we did not enter into alliance\r\nwith France six months sooner, as, besides opening her ports for the\r\nvent of our last year’s produce, she might have marched an army into\r\nGermany, and prevented the petty princes there, from selling their\r\nunhappy subjects to subdue us.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appearing in the course of these debates, that the colonies of New\r\nYork, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and South Carolina\r\nwere not yet matured for falling from the parent stem, but that they\r\nwere fast advancing to that state, it was thought most prudent to wait\r\nawhile for them, and to postpone the final decision to July 1st: but,\r\nthat this might occasion as little delay as possible, a committee was\r\nappointed to prepare a Declaration of Independence. The committee were\r\nJohn Adams, Dr. Franklin, Roger Sherman, Robert R. Livingston, and\r\nmyself. Committees were also appointed, at the same time, to prepare a\r\nplan of confederation for the colonies, and to state the terms proper\r\nto be proposed for foreign alliance. The committee for drawing the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, desired me to do it. It was accordingly\r\ndone, and being approved by them, I reported it to the House on Friday,\r\nthe 28th of June, when it was read and ordered to lie on the table. On\r\nMonday, the 1st of July, the House resolved itself into a committee of\r\nthe whole, and resumed the consideration of the original motion made by\r\nthe delegates of Virginia, which, being again debated through the\r\nday, was carried in the affirmative by the votes of New Hampshire,\r\nConnecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, and Georgia. South Carolina and Pennsylvania\r\nvoted against it. Delaware had but two members present, and they\r\nwere divided. The delegates from New York declared they were for it\r\nthemselves, and were assured their constituents were for it; but that\r\ntheir instructions having been drawn near a twelvemonth before, when\r\nreconciliation was still the general object, they were enjoined by them\r\nto do nothing which should impede that object. They therefore thought\r\nthemselves not justifiable in voting on either side, and asked leave to\r\nwithdraw from the question; which was given them. The committee rose and\r\nreported their resolution to the House. Mr. Edward Rutledge, of South\r\nCarolina, then requested the determination might be put off to the\r\nnext day, as he believed his colleagues, though they disapproved of\r\nthe resolution, would then join in it for the sake of unanimity. The\r\nultimate question, whether the House would agree to the resolution of\r\nthe committee, was accordingly postponed to the next day, when it was\r\nagain moved, and South Carolina concurred in voting for it. In the\r\nmean time, a third member had come post from the Delaware counties, and\r\nturned the vote of that colony in favor of the resolution. Members of a\r\ndifferent sentiment attending that morning from Pennsylvania also, her\r\nvote was changed, so that the whole twelve colonies, who were authorized\r\nto vote at all, gave their voices for it; and, within a few days, [July\r\n9.] the convention of New York approved of it, and thus supplied the\r\nvoid occasioned by the withdrawing of her delegates from the vote.\r\n\r\nCongress proceeded the same day to consider the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, which had been reported and laid on the table the Friday\r\npreceding, and on Monday referred to a committee of the whole. The\r\npusillanimous idea that we had friends in England worth keeping terms\r\nwith, still haunted the minds of many. For this reason, those passages\r\nwhich conveyed censures on the people of England were struck out, lest\r\nthey should give them offence. The clause too, reprobating the enslaving\r\nthe inhabitants of Africa, was struck out in complaisance to South\r\nCarolina and Georgia, who had never attempted to restrain the\r\nimportation of slaves, and who, on the contrary, still wished to\r\ncontinue it. Our northern brethren also, I believe, felt a little\r\ntender under those censures; for though their people had very few slaves\r\nthemselves, yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to\r\nothers. The debates having taken up the greater parts of the 2nd, 3rd,\r\nand 4th days of July, were, on the evening of the last, closed; the\r\nDeclaration was reported by the committee, agreed to by the House, and\r\nsigned by every member present, except Mr. Dickinson. As the sentiments\r\nof men are known, not only by what they receive, but what they reject\r\nalso, I will state the form of the Declaration as originally reported.\r\nThe parts struck out by Congress shall be distinguished by a black line\r\ndrawn under them; * and those inserted by them shall be placed in the\r\nmargin, or in a concurrent column.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Draft of Declaration of Independence, page016]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Draft of Declaration of Independence, page017]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Draft of Declaration of Independence, page018]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Draft of Declaration of Independence, page019]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Draft of Declaration of Independence, page020]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Draft of Declaration of Independence, page021]\r\n\r\n\r\n     * In this publication, the parts struck out are printed in\r\n     Italics and inclosed in brackets--and those inserted are\r\n     inclosed in parenthesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DECLARATION BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IN\r\n_GENERAL_ CONGRESS ASSEMBLED.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people\r\nto dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another,\r\nand to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal\r\nstation to which the laws of nature and of nature’s God entitle them,\r\na decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should\r\ndeclare the causes which impel them to the separation.\r\n\r\nWe hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal;\r\nthat they are endowed by their creator with [_inherent and_] (certain)\r\ninalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit\r\nof happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted\r\namong men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed;\r\nthat whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends,\r\nit is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute\r\nnew government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing\r\nits powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect\r\ntheir safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that\r\ngovernments long established should not be changed for light and\r\ntransient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind\r\nare more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable, than to right\r\nthemselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But\r\nwhen a long train of abuses and usurpations [_begun at a distinguished\r\nperiod and_] pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to\r\nreduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their\r\nduty to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their\r\nfuture security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies;\r\nand such is now the necessity which constrains them to [_expunge_]\r\n(alter) their former systems of government. The history of the present\r\nking of Great Britain is a history of [_unremitting_] (repeated)\r\ninjuries and usurpations, [_among which appears no solitary act to\r\ncontradict the uniform tenor of the rest, but all have_] (all having)\r\nin direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these\r\nstates. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world [_for\r\nthe truth of which we pledge a faith yet unsullied by falsehood._]\r\n\r\nHe has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for\r\nthe public good.\r\n\r\nHe has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing\r\nimportance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should\r\nbe obtained; and, when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nHe has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large\r\ndistricts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right\r\nof representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them, and\r\nformidable to tyrants only.\r\n\r\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\r\nuncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records,\r\nfor the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nHe has dissolved representative houses repeatedly [_and continually_]\r\nfor opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nHe has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause\r\nothers to be elected, whereby the legislative powers, incapable of\r\nannihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise,\r\nthe state remaining, in the mean time, exposed to all the dangers of\r\ninvasion from without and convulsions within.\r\n\r\nHe has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that\r\npurpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners, refusing\r\nto pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the\r\nconditions of new appropriations of lands.\r\n\r\nHe has [_suffered_] (obstructed) the administration of justice [_totally\r\nto cease in some of these states_] (by) refusing his assent to laws for\r\nestablishing judiciary powers.\r\n\r\nHe has made [_our_] judges dependant on his will alone for the tenure of\r\ntheir offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\r\n\r\nHe has erected a multitude of new offices, [_by a self-assumed power_]\r\nand sent hither swarms of new officers to harass our people and eat out\r\ntheir substance.\r\n\r\nHe has kept among us in times of peace standing armies [_and ships of\r\nwar_] without the consent of our legislatures.\r\n\r\nHe has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to,\r\nthe civil power.\r\n\r\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to\r\nour constitutions and unacknowledged by our laws, giving his assent to\r\ntheir acts of pretended legislation for quartering large bodies of armed\r\ntroops among us; for protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for\r\nany murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states;\r\nfor cutting off our trade with all parts of the world; for imposing\r\ntaxes on us without our consent; for depriving us [ ] in many cases of\r\nthe benefits of trial by jury; for transporting us beyond seas to be\r\ntried for pretended offences; for abolishing the free system of English\r\nlaws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary\r\ngovernment, and enlarging its boundaries, so as to render it at once an\r\nexample and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into\r\nthese [_states_] (colonies); for taking away our charters, abolishing\r\nour most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of\r\nour governments; for suspending our own legislatures, and declaring\r\nthemselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nHe has abdicated government here [_withdrawing his governors, and\r\ndeclaring us out of his allegiance and protection._] (by declaring us\r\nout of his protection and waging war against us.)\r\n\r\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and\r\ndestroyed the lives of our people.\r\n\r\nHe is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to\r\ncomplete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny already begun with\r\ncircumstances of cruelty and perfidy [ ] (scarcely paralleled in the\r\nmost barbarous ages and totally) unworthy the head of a civilized\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nHe has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas\r\nto bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their\r\nfriends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.\r\n\r\nHe has [ ] (excited domestic insurrections amoungst us and has)\r\nendeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless\r\nIndian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished\r\ndestruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions [_of existence._]\r\n\r\n[_He has incited treasonable insurrections of our fellow citizens, with\r\nthe allurements of forfeiture and confiscation of our property.\r\n\r\nHe has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most\r\nsacred rights of life and, liberty in the persons of a distant people\r\nwho never offended him, captivating and carrying them into slavery in\r\nanother hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation\r\nthither. This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of INFIDEL powers, is\r\nthe warfare of the CHRISTIAN king of Great Britain. Determined to keep\r\nopen a market where men should be bought and sold, he has prostituted\r\nhis negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or\r\nto restrain this execrable commerce. And that this assemblage of horrors\r\nmight want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very\r\npeople to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which\r\nhe has deprived them, by murdering the people on whom he also obtruded\r\nthem: thus paying off former crimes committed against the liberties of\r\none people with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives\r\nof another._]\r\n\r\nIn every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in\r\nthe most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by\r\nrepeated injuries.\r\n\r\nA prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a\r\ntyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a [ ] (free) people [_who mean to be\r\nfree. Future ages will scarcely believe that the hardiness of one man\r\nadventured, within the short compass of twelve years only, to lay\r\na foundation so broad and so undisguised for tyranny over a people\r\nfostered and fixed in principles of freedom._]\r\n\r\nNor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have\r\nwarned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend\r\n[_a_] (an unwarrantable) jurisdiction over [_these our states_] (us). We\r\nhave reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement\r\nhere, [_no one of which could warrant so strange a pretension: that\r\nthese were effected at the expense of our own blood and treasure,\r\nunassisted by the wealth or the strength of Great Britain: that in\r\nconstituting indeed our several forms of government, we had adopted one\r\ncommon king, thereby laying a foundation for perpetual league and amity\r\nwith them: but that submission to their parliament was no part of our\r\nconstitution, nor ever in idea, if history may be credited: and,_] we [\r\n] (have) appealed to their native justice and magnanimity [_as well as\r\nto_] (and we have conjured them by) the ties of our common kindred to\r\ndisavow these usurpations which [_were likely to_] (would inevitably)\r\ninterrupt our connection and correspondence. They too have been deaf\r\nto the voice of justice and of consanguinity, [_and when occasions have\r\nbeen given them, by the regular course of their laws, of removing from\r\ntheir councils the disturbers of our harmony, they have, by their free\r\nelection, re-established, them in power. At this very time too, they are\r\npermitting their chief magistrate to send over not only soldiers of our\r\ncommon blood, but Scotch and foreign mercenaries to invade and destroy\r\nus. These facts have given the last stab to agonizing affection, and\r\nmanly spirit bids us to renounce for ever these unfeeling brethren. We\r\nmust endeavor to forget our former love for them, and hold them as we\r\nhold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends. We might\r\nhave been a free and a great people together; but a communication of\r\ngrandeur and of freedom, it seems, is below their dignity. Be it so,\r\nsince they will have it. The road to happiness and to glory is open\r\nto us too. We will tread it apart from them, and_] (We must therefore)\r\nacquiesce in the necessity which denounces our [eternal] separation [ ]!\r\n(and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace\r\nfriends.)\r\n\r\n[_We therefore the representatives of the United States of America in\r\nGeneral Congress assembled, do in the name, and by the authority of\r\nthe good people of these states reject and renounce all allegiance\r\nand subjection to the kings of Great Britain and all others who may\r\nhereafter claim by, through, or under them; we utterly dissolve all\r\npolitical connection which may heretofore have subsisted between us and,\r\nthe people or parliament of Great Britain: and finally we do assert and\r\ndeclare these colonies to be free and independent states, and that as\r\nfree and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude\r\npeace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts\r\nand things which independent states may of right do.\r\n\r\nAnd for the support of this declaration, we mutually pledge to each\r\nother our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor._]\r\n\r\n(We therefore the representatives of the United States of America in\r\nGeneral Congress assembled, appealing to the supreme judge of the\r\nworld for the rectitude of our intentions, do in the name, and by the\r\nauthority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and\r\ndeclare, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free\r\nand independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to\r\nthe British crown, and that all political connection between them and\r\nthe state of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and\r\nthat as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war,\r\nconclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all\r\nother acts and things which independent states may of right do.\r\n\r\nAnd for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the\r\nprotection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our\r\nlives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe declaration thus signed on the 4th, on paper, was engrossed on\r\nparchment, and signed again on the 2nd of August.\r\n\r\n[* Some erroneous statements of the proceedings on the Declaration of\r\nIndependence having got before the public in latter times, Mr. Samuel A.\r\nWells asked explanations of me, which are given in my letter to him of\r\nMay 12, ‘19, before and now again referred to.

On the\r\n30th and 31st of that month, and 1st of the ensuing, those articles were\r\ndebated which determined the proportion, or quota, of money which each\r\nstate should furnish to the common treasury, and the manner of voting\r\nin Congress. The first of these articles was expressed in the original\r\ndraught in these words. ‘Art. XI. All charges of war and all other\r\nexpenses that shall be incurred for the common defence, or general\r\nwelfare, and allowed by the United States assembled, shall be defrayed\r\nout of a common treasury, which shall be supplied by the several\r\ncolonies in proportion to the number of inhabitants of every age, sex,\r\nand quality, except Indians not paying taxes, in each colony, a true\r\naccount-of which, distinguishing the white inhabitants, shall be\r\ntriennially taken and transmitted to the Assembly of the United States.’\r\n\r\nMr. Chase moved that the quotas should be fixed, not by the number of\r\ninhabitants of every condition, but by that of the ‘white inhabitants.’\r\nHe admitted that taxation should be always in proportion to property;\r\nthat this was, in theory, the true rule; but that, from a variety of\r\ndifficulties, it was a rule which could never be adopted in practice.\r\nThe value of the property in every state, could never be estimated\r\njustly and equally. Some other measures for the wealth of the state must\r\ntherefore be devised, some standard referred to, which would be more\r\nsimple. He considered the number of inhabitants as a tolerably good\r\ncriterion of property, and that this might always be obtained. He\r\ntherefore thought it the best mode which we could adopt, with one\r\nexception only: he observed that negroes are property, and as such,\r\ncannot be distinguished from the lands or personalities held in those\r\nstates where there are few slaves; that the surplus of profit which a\r\nNorthern farmer is able to lay by, he invests in cattle, horses, &c.\r\nwhereas a Southern farmer lays out the same surplus in slaves. There is\r\nno more reason therefore for taxing the Southern states on the farmer’s\r\nhead, and on his slave’s head, than the Northern ones on their farmers’\r\nheads and the heads of their cattle: that the method proposed would,\r\ntherefore, tax the Southern states according to their numbers and their\r\nwealth conjunctly, while the Northern would be taxed on numbers only;\r\nthat negroes, in fact, should not be considered as members of the state,\r\nmore than cattle, and that they have no more interest in it.\r\n\r\nMr. John Adams observed, that the numbers of people were taken by this\r\narticle, as an index of the wealth of the state, and not as subjects of\r\ntaxation; that, as to this matter, it was of no consequence by what name\r\nyou called your people, whether by that of freemen or of slaves; that\r\nin some countries the laboring poor were called freemen, in others\r\nthey were called slaves; but that the difference as to the state\r\nwas imaginary only. What matters it whether a landlord employing ten\r\nlaborers on his farm, give them annually as much money as will buy them\r\nthe necessaries of life, or gives them those necessaries at short hand?\r\nThe ten laborers add as much wealth annually to the state, increase its\r\nexports as much, in the one case as the other. Certainly five hundred\r\nfreemen produce no more profits, no greater surplus for the payment of\r\ntaxes, than five hundred slaves. Therefore the state in which are the\r\nlaborers called freemen, should be taxed no more than that in which are\r\nthose called slaves. Suppose, by an extraordinary operation of nature\r\nor of law, one half the laborers of a state could in the course of one\r\nnight be transformed into slaves; would the state be made the poorer or\r\nthe less able to pay taxes? That the condition of the laboring poor\r\nin most countries, that of the fishermen particularly of the Northern\r\nstates, is as abject as that of slaves. It is the number of laborers\r\nwhich produces the surplus for taxation, and numbers, therefore,\r\nindiscriminately, are the fair index of wealth; that it is the use of\r\nthe word ‘property’ here, and its application to some of the people\r\nof the state, which produces the fallacy. How does the Southern farmer\r\nprocure slaves? Either by importation or by purchase from his neighbor.\r\nIf he imports a slave, he adds one to the number of laborers in his\r\ncountry, and proportionably to its profits and abilities to pay-taxes;\r\nif he buys from his neighbor, it is only a transfer of a laborer from\r\none farm to another, which does not change the annual produce of the\r\nstate, and therefore should not change its tax: that if a Northern\r\nfarmer works ten laborers on his farm, he can, it is true, invest the\r\nsurplus of ten men’s labor in cattle; but so may the Southern farmer,\r\nworking ten slaves; that a state of one hundred thousand freemen can\r\nmaintain no more cattle, than one of one hundred thousand slaves.\r\nTherefore, they have no more of that kind of property; that a slave may,\r\nindeed, from the custom of speech, be more properly called the wealth\r\nof his master, than the free laborer might be called the wealth of his\r\nemployer: but as to the state, both were equally its wealth, and should\r\ntherefore equally add to the quota of its tax.\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison proposed, as a compromise, that two slaves should be\r\ncounted as one freeman. He affirmed that slaves did not do as much work\r\nas freemen, and doubted if two effected more than one; that this was\r\nproved by the price of labor; the hire of a laborer in the Southern\r\ncolonies being from £8 to £12, while in the Northern it was generally\r\n£24.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson said, that if this amendment should take place, the Southern\r\ncolonies would have all the benefit of slaves, whilst the Northern ones\r\nwould bear the burthen: that slaves increase the profits of a state,\r\nwhich the Southern states mean to take to themselves; that they also\r\nincrease the burthen of defence, which would of course fall so much the\r\nheavier on the Northern: that slaves occupy the places of freemen and\r\neat their food. Dismiss your slaves, and freemen will take their places.\r\nIt is our duty to lay every discouragement on the importation of slaves;\r\nbut this amendment would give the _jus trium liberorum_ to him who\r\nwould import slaves: that other kinds of property were pretty equally\r\ndistributed through all the colonies: there were as many cattle, horses,\r\nand sheep, in the North as the South, and South as the North; but not so\r\nas to slaves: that experience has shown that those colonies have, been\r\nalways able to pay most, which have the most inhabitants, whether they\r\nbe black or white: and the practice of the Southern colonies has always\r\nbeen to make every farmer pay poll taxes upon all his laborers, whether\r\nthey be black or white. He acknowledges indeed, that freemen work the\r\nmost; but they consume the most also. They do not produce a greater\r\nsurplus for taxation. The slave is neither fed nor clothed so\r\nexpensively as a freeman. Again, white women are exempted from labor\r\ngenerally, but negro women are not. In this then the Southern states\r\nhave an advantage as the article now stands. It has sometimes been said\r\nthat slavery is necessary, because the commodities they raise would be\r\ntoo dear for market if cultivated by freemen: but now it is said that\r\nthe labor of the slave is the dearest.\r\n\r\nMr. Payne urged the original resolution of Congress, to proportion the\r\nquotas of the states to the number of souls.\r\n\r\nDr. Witherspoon was of opinion, that the value of lands and houses was\r\nthe best estimate of the wealth of a nation, and that it was practicable\r\nto obtain such a valuation. This is the true barometer of wealth. The\r\none now proposed is imperfect in itself, and unequal between the states.\r\nIt has been objected that negroes eat the food of freemen, and therefore\r\nshould be taxed; horses also eat the food of freemen; therefore they\r\nalso should be taxed. It has been said too, that in carrying slaves into\r\nthe estimate of the taxes the state is to pay, we do no more than those\r\nstates themselves do, who always take slaves into the estimate of the\r\ntaxes the individual is to pay. But the cases are not parallel. In\r\nthe Southern colonies slaves pervade the whole colony; but they do\r\nnot pervade the whole continent. That as to the original resolution\r\nof Congress, to proportion the quotas according to the souls, it was\r\ntemporary only, and related to the monies heretofore emitted; whereas\r\nwe are now entering into a new compact, and therefore stand on original\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAugust 1. The question being put, the amendment proposed was rejected\r\nby the votes of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,\r\nNew York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, against those of Delaware,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina. Georgia was divided.\r\n\r\nThe other article was in these words. ‘Art. XVII. In determining\r\nquestions, each colony shall have one vote.’\r\n\r\nJuly 30, 31, August 1. Present forty-one members. Mr. Chase observed\r\nthat this article was the most likely to divide us, of any one proposed\r\nin the draught then under consideration: that the larger colonies\r\nhad threatened they would not confederate at all, if their weight in\r\nCongress should not be equal to the numbers of people they added to the\r\nconfederacy; while the smaller ones declared against a union, if they\r\ndid not retain an equal vote for the protection of their rights. That it\r\nwas of the utmost consequence to bring the parties together, as, should\r\nwe sever from each other, either no foreign power will ally with us at\r\nall, or the different states will form different alliances, and thus\r\nincrease the horrors of those scenes of civil war and bloodshed, which\r\nin such a state of separation and independence, would render us a\r\nmiserable people. That our importance, our interests, our peace required\r\nthat we should confederate, and that mutual sacrifices should be made to\r\neffect a compromise of this difficult question. He was of opinion,\r\nthe smaller colonies would lose their rights, if they were not in some\r\ninstances allowed an equal vote; and, therefore, that a discrimination\r\nshould take place among the questions which would come before Congress.\r\nThat the smaller states should be secured in all questions concerning\r\nlife or liberty, and the greater ones, in all respecting property. He\r\ntherefore proposed, that in votes relating to money, the voice of each\r\ncolony should be proportioned to the number of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nDr. Franklin thought, that the votes should be so proportioned in all\r\ncases. He took notice that the Delaware counties had bound up\r\ntheir delegates to disagree to this article. He thought it a very\r\nextraordinary language to be held by any state, that they would not\r\nconfederate with us, unless we would let them dispose of our money.\r\nCertainly, if we vote equally, we ought to pay equally; but the smaller\r\nstates will hardly purchase the privilege at this price. That had he\r\nlived in a state where the representation, originally equal, had become\r\nunequal by time and accident, he might have submitted rather than\r\ndisturb government: but that we should be very wrong to set out in this\r\npractice, when it is in our power to establish what is right. That at\r\nthe time of the Union between England and Scotland, the latter had made\r\nthe objection which the smaller states now do; but experience had proved\r\nthat no unfairness had ever been shown them: that their advocates had\r\nprognosticated that it would again happen, as in times of old, that the\r\nwhale would swallow Jonas, but he thought the prediction reversed in\r\nevent, and that Jonas had swallowed the whale; for the Scotch had in\r\nfact got possession of the government, and gave laws to the English. He\r\nreprobated the original agreement of Congress to vote by colonies, and,\r\ntherefore, was for their voting, in all cases, according to the number\r\nof taxables.\r\n\r\nDr. Witherspoon opposed every alteration of the article. All men admit\r\nthat a confederacy is necessary. Should the idea get abroad that there\r\nis likely to be no union among us, it will damp the minds of the people,\r\ndiminish the glory of our struggle, and lessen its importance; because\r\nit will open to our view future prospects of war and dissension among\r\nourselves. If an equal vote be refused, the smaller states will become\r\nvassals to the larger; and all experience has shown that the vassals and\r\nsubjects of free states are the most enslaved. He instanced the Helots\r\nof Sparta, and the provinces of Rome. He observed that foreign powers,\r\ndiscovering this blemish, would make it a handle for disengaging the\r\nsmaller states from so unequal a confederacy. That the colonies\r\nshould in fact be considered as individuals; and that, as such, in all\r\ndisputes, they should have an equal vote; that they are now collected\r\nas individuals making a bargain with each other, and, of course, had a\r\nright to vote as individuals. That in the East India Company they\r\nvoted by persons, and not by their proportion of stock. That the Belgic\r\nconfederacy voted by provinces. That in questions of war the smaller\r\nstates were as much interested as the larger, and therefore, should vote\r\nequally; and indeed, that the larger states were more likely to bring\r\nwar on the confederacy, in proportion as their frontier was more\r\nextensive. He admitted that equality of representation was an excellent\r\nprinciple, but then it must be of things which are co-ordinate; that\r\nis of things similar, and of the same nature: that nothing relating\r\nto individuals could ever come before Congress; nothing but what would\r\nrespect colonies. He distinguished between an incorporating and a\r\nfederal union. The union of England was an incorporating one; yet\r\nScotland had suffered by that union; for that its inhabitants were drawn\r\nfrom it by the hopes of places and employments; nor was it an instance\r\nof equality of representation; because, while Scotland was allowed\r\nnearly a thirteenth of representation, they were to pay only one\r\nfortieth of the land tax. He expressed his hopes, that in the present\r\nenlightened state of men’s minds, we might expect a lasting confederacy,\r\nif it was founded on fair principles.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams advocated the voting in proportion to numbers. He said, that\r\nwe stand here as the representatives of the people; that in some states\r\nthe people are many, in others they are few; that therefore their vote\r\nhere should be proportioned to the numbers from whom it comes. Reason,\r\njustice, and equity never had weight enough on the face of the earth, to\r\ngovern the councils of men. It is interest alone which does it, and it\r\nis interest alone which can be trusted; that therefore the interests,\r\nwithin doors, should be the mathematical representatives of the\r\ninterests without doors; that the individuality of the colonies is a\r\nmere sound. Does the individuality of a colony increase its wealth or\r\nnumbers? If it does, pay equally. If it does not add weight in the\r\nscale of the confederacy, it cannot add to their rights, nor weigh in\r\nargument. A. has £50, B. £500, C. £1000, in partnership. Is it just they\r\nshould equally dispose of the monies of the partnership? It has been\r\nsaid, we are independent individuals, making a bargain together. The\r\nquestion is not, what we are now, but what we ought to be, when our\r\nbargain shall be made. The confederacy is to make us one individual\r\nonly; it is to form us, like separate parcels of metal, into one common\r\nmass. We shall no longer retain our separate individuality, but become\r\na single individual as to all questions submitted to the confederacy.\r\nTherefore all those reasons, which prove the justice and expediency of\r\nequal representation in other assemblies, hold good here. It has been\r\nobjected, that a proportional vote will endanger the smaller states.\r\nWe answer, that an equal vote will endanger the larger. Virginia,\r\nPennsylvania, and Massachusetts, are the three greater colonies.\r\nConsider their distance, their difference of produce, of interests,\r\nand of manners, and it is apparent they can never have an interest\r\nor inclination to combine for the oppression of the smaller; that the\r\nsmaller will naturally divide on all questions with the larger. Rhode\r\nIsland, from its relation, similarity, and intercourse, will generally\r\npursue the same objects with Massachusetts; Jersey, Delaware, and\r\nMaryland, with Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nDr. Rush took notice, that the decay of the liberties of the Dutch\r\nrepublic proceeded from three causes. 1. The perfect unanimity requisite\r\non all occasions. 2. Their obligation to consult their constituents.\r\n3. Their voting by provinces. This last destroyed the equality of\r\nrepresentation, and the liberties of Great Britain also are sinking from\r\nthe same defect. That a part of our rights is deposited in the hands of\r\nour legislatures. There, it was admitted, there should be an equality of\r\nrepresentation. Another part of our rights is deposited in the hands\r\nof Congress; why is it not equally necessary, there should be an equal\r\nrepresentation there? Were it possible to collect the whole body of the\r\npeople together, they would determine the questions submitted to them\r\nby their majority. Why should not the same majority decide, when\r\nvoting here, by their representatives? The larger colonies are so\r\nprovidentially divided in situation, as to render every fear of\r\ntheir combining visionary. Their interests are different, and their\r\ncircumstances dissimilar. It is more probable they will become rivals,\r\nand leave it in the power of the smaller states to give preponderance\r\nto any scale they please. The voting by the number of free inhabitants,\r\nwill have one excellent effect, that of inducing the colonies to\r\ndiscourage slavery, and to encourage the increase of their free\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins observed, there were four larger, four smaller, and four\r\nmiddle-sized colonies. That the four largest would contain more than\r\nhalf the inhabitants of the confederating states, and therefore would\r\ngovern the others as they should please. That history affords no\r\ninstance of such a thing as equal representation. The Germanic body\r\nvotes by states. The Helvetic body does the same; and so does the Belgic\r\nconfederacy. That too little is known of the ancient confederations, to\r\nsay what was their practice.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson thought, that taxation should be in proportion to wealth,\r\nbut that representation should accord with the number of freemen. That\r\ngovernment is a collection or result of the wills of all: that if any\r\ngovernment could speak the will of all, it would be perfect; and that,\r\nso far as it departs from this, it becomes imperfect. It has been said,\r\nthat Congress is a representation of states, not of individuals. I say,\r\nthat the objects of its care are all the individuals of the states.\r\nIt is strange, that annexing the name of ‘State’ to ten thousand men,\r\nshould give them an equal right with forty thousand. This must be the\r\neffect of magic, not of reason. As to those matters which are referred\r\nto Congress, we are not so many states; we are one large state. We lay\r\naside our individuality, whenever we come here. The Germanic body is\r\na burlesque on government: and their practice on any point, is\r\na sufficient authority and proof that it is wrong. The greatest\r\nimperfection in the constitution of the Belgic confederacy is their\r\nvoting by provinces. The interest of the whole is constantly sacrificed\r\nto that of the small, states. The history of the war in the reign of\r\nQueen Anne, sufficiently proves this. It is asked, shall nine colonies\r\nput it into the power of four, to govern them as they please? I invert\r\nthe question, and ask, shall two millions of people put it into the\r\npower of one million, to govern them as they please? It is pretended,\r\ntoo, that the smaller colonies will be in danger from the greater. Speak\r\nin honest language and say, the minority will be in danger from the\r\nmajority. And is there an assembly on earth, where this danger may not\r\nbe equally pretended? The truth is, that our proceedings will then be\r\nconsentaneous with the interests of the majority, and so they ought\r\nto be. The probability is much greater, that the larger states will\r\ndisagree, than that they will combine. I defy the wit of man to invent a\r\npossible case, or to suggest any one thing on earth, which shall be for\r\nthe interests of Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, and which\r\nwill not also be for the interest of the other states.*\r\n\r\n     * Here terminate the author’s notes of the ‘earlier debates\r\n     on the confederation,’ and recommences the MS. begun by him\r\n     in 1821.\r\n\r\nThese articles, reported July 12, ‘76, were debated from day to day, and\r\ntime to time, for two years, were ratified July 9, ‘78, by ten states,\r\nby New-Jersey on the 26th of November of the same year, and by Delaware\r\non the 23rd of February following. Maryland alone held off two years\r\nmore, acceding to them March 1, ‘81, and thus closing the obligation.\r\n\r\nOur delegation had been renewed for the ensuing year, commencing\r\nAugust 11; but the new government was now organized, a meeting of the\r\nlegislature was to be held in October, and I had been elected a member\r\nby my county. I knew that our legislation, under the regal government,\r\nhad many very vicious points which urgently required reformation, and\r\nI thought I could be of more use in forwarding that work. I therefore\r\nretired from my seat in Congress on the 2nd of September, resigned it,\r\nand took my place in the legislature of my state, on the 7th of October.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th, I moved for leave to bring in a bill for the establishment\r\nof courts of justice, the organization of which was of importance. I\r\ndrew the bill; it was approved by the committee, reported and passed,\r\nafter going through its due course.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, I obtained leave to bring in a bill declaring tenants in\r\ntail to hold their lands in fee simple. In the earlier times of the\r\ncolony, when lands were to be obtained for little or nothing, some\r\nprovident individuals procured large grants; and, desirous of founding\r\ngreat families for themselves, settled them on their descendants in fee\r\ntail. The transmission of this property from generation to generation,\r\nin the same name, raised up a distinct set of families, who, being\r\nprivileged by law in the perpetuation of their wealth, were thus formed\r\ninto a Patrician order, distinguished by the splendor and luxury of\r\ntheir establishments. From this order, too, the king habitually selected\r\nhis Counsellors of state; the hope of which distinction devoted the\r\nwhole corps to the interests and will of the crown. To annul this\r\nprivilege, and instead of an aristocracy of wealth, of more harm and\r\ndanger, than benefit, to society, to make an opening for the aristocracy\r\nof virtue and talent, which nature has wisely provided for the direction\r\nof the interests of society, and scattered with equal hand through all\r\nits conditions, was deemed essential to a well ordered republic. To\r\neffect it, no violence was necessary, no deprivation of natural right,\r\nbut rather an enlargement of it by a repeal of the law. For this would\r\nauthorize the present holder to divide the property among his children\r\nequally, as his affections were divided; and would place them, by\r\nnatural generation, on the level of their fellow citizens. But this\r\nrepeal was strongly opposed by Mr. Pendleton, who was zealously attached\r\nto ancient establishments; and who, taken all in all, was the ablest man\r\nin debate I have ever met with. He had not indeed the poetical fancy of\r\nMr. Henry, his sublime imagination, his lofty and overwhelming diction;\r\nbut he was cool, smooth, and persuasive; his language flowing, chaste,\r\nand embellished; his conceptions quick, acute, and full of resource;\r\nnever vanquished; for if he lost the main battle, he returned upon\r\nyou, and regained so much of it as to make it a drawn one, by dexterous\r\nmanoeuvres, skirmishes in detail, and the recovery of small advantages\r\nwhich, little singly, were important all together. You never knew when\r\nyou were clear of him, but were harassed by his perseverance, until the\r\npatience was worn down of all who had less of it than himself. Add to\r\nthis, that he was one of the most virtuous and benevolent of men, the\r\nkindest friend, the most amiable and pleasant of companions, which\r\nensured a favorable reception to whatever came from him. Finding that\r\nthe general principle of entails could not be maintained, he took\r\nhis stand on an amendment which he proposed, instead of an absolute\r\nabolition, to permit the tenant in tail to convey in fee simple, if he\r\nchose it: and he was within a few votes of saving so much of the old\r\nlaw. But the bill passed finally for entire abolition.\r\n\r\nIn that one of the bills for organizing our judiciary system, which\r\nproposed a court of Chancery, I had provided for a trial by jury of all\r\nmatters of fact, in that as well as in the courts of law. He defeated\r\nit by the introduction of four words only, ‘if either party choose?’ The\r\nconsequence has been, that as no suitor will say to his judge, ‘Sir, I\r\ndistrust you, give me a jury,’ juries are rarely, I might say perhaps\r\nnever, seen in that court, but when called for by the Chancellor of his\r\nown accord.\r\n\r\nThe first establishment in Virginia, which became permanent, was made in\r\n1607. I have found no mention of negroes in the colony until about 1650.\r\nThe first brought here as slaves were by a Dutch ship; after which the\r\nEnglish commenced the trade, and continued it until the revolutionary\r\nwar. That suspended, _ipso facto,_ their further importation for\r\nthe present, and the business of the war pressing constantly on the\r\nlegislature, this subject was not acted on finally until the year ‘78,\r\nwhen I brought in a bill to prevent their further importation. This\r\npassed without opposition, and stopped the increase of the evil by\r\nimportation, leaving to future efforts its final eradication.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers of this colony were Englishmen, loyal subjects to\r\ntheir king and church; and the grant to Sir Walter Raleigh contained\r\nan express proviso, that their laws should not be against the true\r\nChristian faith, now professed in the church of England.’ As soon as the\r\nstate of the colony admitted, it was divided into parishes, in each of\r\nwhich was established a minister of the Anglican church, endowed with\r\na fixed salary, in tobacco, a glebe house and land, with the other\r\nnecessary appendages. To meet these expenses, all the inhabitants of\r\nthe parishes were assessed, whether they were or not members of the\r\nestablished church. Towards Quakers, who came here, they were most\r\ncruelly intolerant, driving them from the colony by the severest\r\npenalties. In process of time, however, other sectarisms were\r\nintroduced, chiefly of the Presbyterian family; and the established\r\nclergy, secure for life in their glebes and salaries, adding to these,\r\ngenerally, the emoluments of a classical school, found employment enough\r\nin their farms and school-rooms, for the rest of the week, and devoted\r\nSunday only to the edification of their flock, by service, and a sermon\r\nat their parish church. Their other pastoral functions were little\r\nattended to. Against this inactivity, the zeal and industry of sectarian\r\npreachers had an open and undisputed field; and by the time of the\r\nrevolution, a majority of the inhabitants had become dissenters from\r\nthe established church, but were still obliged to pay contributions to\r\nsupport the pastors of the minority. This unrighteous compulsion, to\r\nmaintain teachers of what they deemed religious errors, was grievously\r\nfelt during the regal government, and without a hope of relief. But\r\nthe first republican legislature, which met in ‘76, was crowded with\r\npetitions to abolish, this spiritual tyranny. These brought on the\r\nseverest contests in which I have ever been engaged. Our great opponents\r\nwere Mr. Pendleton and Robert Carter Nicholas; honest men, but zealous\r\nchurchmen. The petitions were referred to the committee of the whole\r\nHouse on the state of the country; and, after desperate contests in\r\nthat committee, almost daily, from the 11th of October to the 5th\r\nof December, we prevailed so far only, as to repeal the laws, which\r\nrendered criminal the maintenance of any religious opinions, the\r\nforbearance of repairing to church, or the exercise of any mode of\r\nworship: and further, to exempt dissenters from contributions to the\r\nsupport of the established church; and to suspend, only until the next\r\nsession, levies on the members of the church for the salaries of\r\ntheir own incumbents. For although the majority of our citizens were\r\ndissenters, as has been observed, a majority of the legislature were\r\nchurchmen. Among these, however, were some reasonable and liberal men,\r\nwho enabled us, on some points, to obtain feeble majorities. But our\r\nopponents carried, in the general resolutions of the committee of\r\nNovember 19, a declaration, that religious assemblies ought to be\r\nregulated, and that provision ought to be made for continuing the\r\nsuccession of the clergy, and superintending their conduct. And in the\r\nbill now passed, was inserted an express reservation of the question,\r\nWhether a general assessment should not be established by law, on every\r\none, to the support of the pastor of his choice; or whether all should\r\nbe left to voluntary contributions: and on this question, debated at\r\nevery session from ‘76 to ‘79 (some of our dissenting allies, having\r\nnow secured their particular object, going over to the advocates of a\r\ngeneral assessment), we could only obtain a suspension from session to\r\nsession until ‘79, when the question against a general assessment was\r\nfinally carried, and the establishment of the Anglican church entirely\r\nput down. In justice to the two honest but zealous opponents, who have\r\nbeen named, I must add, that although, from their natural temperaments,\r\nthey were more disposed generally to acquiesce in things as they\r\nare, than to risk innovations; yet, whenever the public will had once\r\ndecided, none were more faithful or exact in their obedience to it.\r\n\r\nThe seat of our government had been originally fixed in the peninsula\r\nof Jamestown, the first settlement of the colonists; and had been\r\nafterwards removed a few miles inland to Williamsburg. But this was at\r\na time when our settlements had not extended beyond the tide waters. Now\r\nthey had crossed the Allegany; and the centre of population was very far\r\nremoved from what it had been. Yet Williamsburg was still the depository\r\nof our archives, the habitual residence of the Governor, and many other\r\nof the public functionaries, the established place for the sessions\r\nof the legislature, and the magazine of our military stores: and its\r\nsituation was so exposed, that it might be taken at any time in war,\r\nand, at this time particularly, an enemy might in the night run up\r\neither of the rivers, between which it lies, land a force above, and\r\ntake possession of the place, without the possibility of saving either\r\npersons or things. I had proposed its removal so early as October, ‘76;\r\nbut it did not prevail until the session of May, ‘79.\r\n\r\nEarly in the session of May, ‘79, I prepared, and obtained leave to\r\nbring in a bill, declaring who should be deemed citizens, asserting the\r\nnatural right of expatriation, and prescribing the mode of exercising\r\nit. This, when I withdrew from the house on the 1st of June following, I\r\nleft in the hands of George Mason, and it was passed on the 26th of that\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nIn giving this account of the laws, of which I was myself the mover\r\nand draughtsman, I by no means mean to claim to myself the merit of\r\nobtaining their passage. I had many occasional and strenuous coadjutors\r\nin debate, and one, most steadfast, able, and zealous; who was himself\r\na host. This was George Mason, a man of the first order of wisdom among\r\nthose who acted on the theatre of the revolution, of expansive mind,\r\nprofound judgment, cogent in argument, learned in the lore of our former\r\nconstitution, and earnest for the republican change, on democratic\r\nprinciples. His elocution was neither flowing nor smooth; but his\r\nlanguage was strong, his manner most impressive, and strengthened by a\r\ndash of biting cynicism, when provocation made it seasonable.\r\n\r\nMr. Wythe, while speaker in the two sessions of 1777, between his return\r\nfrom Congress and his appointment to the Chancery, was an able and\r\nconstant associate in whatever was before a committee of the whole. His\r\npure integrity, judgment, and reasoning powers gave him great weight. Of\r\nhim, see more in some notes inclosed in my letter of August 31, 1821, to\r\nMr. John Saunderson. [See Appendix, note A.]\r\n\r\nMr. Madison came into the House in 1776, a new member, and young;\r\nwhich circumstances, concurring with his extreme modesty, prevented his\r\nventuring himself in debate before his removal to the Council of State,\r\nin November, ‘77. From thence he went to Congress, then consisting of\r\nfew members. Trained in these successive schools, he acquired a habit of\r\nself-possession, which placed at ready command the rich resources of his\r\nluminous and discriminating mind, and of his extensive information, and\r\nrendered him the first of every assembly afterwards, of which he became\r\na member. Never wandering from his subject into vain declamation, but\r\npursuing it closely, in language pure, classical, and copious, soothing\r\nalways the feelings of his adversaries by civilities and softness of\r\nexpression, he rose to the eminent station which he held in the great\r\nNational Convention of 1787; and in that of Virginia, which followed,\r\nhe sustained the new constitution in all its parts, bearing off the palm\r\nagainst the logic of George Mason, and the fervid declamation of Mr.\r\nHenry. With these consummate powers, was united a pure and spotless\r\nvirtue, which no calumny has ever attempted to sully. Of the powers\r\nand polish of his pen, and of the wisdom of his administration in the\r\nhighest office of the nation, I need say nothing. They have spoken, and\r\nwill for ever speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nSo far we were proceeding in the details of reformation only; selecting\r\npoints of legislation, prominent in character and principle, urgent, and\r\nindicative of the strength of the general pulse of reformation. When I\r\nleft Congress in ‘76, it was in the persuasion, that our whole code must\r\nbe reviewed, adapted to our republican form of government, and, now that\r\nwe had no negatives of Councils, Governors, and Kings to restrain us\r\nfrom doing right, that it should be corrected, in all its parts, with a\r\nsingle eye to reason, and the good of those for whose government it was\r\nframed. Early, therefore, in the session of ‘76, to which I returned,\r\nI moved and presented a bill for the revision of the laws; which\r\nwas passed on the 24th of October, and on the 5th of November, Mr.\r\nPendleton, Mr. Wythe, George Mason, Thomas L. Lee, and myself, were\r\nappointed a committee to execute the work. We agreed to meet at\r\nFredericksburg to settle the plan of operation, and to distribute the\r\nwork. We met there accordingly, on the 13th of January, 1777. The first\r\nquestion was, whether we should propose to abolish the whole existing\r\nsystem of laws, and prepare a new and complete Institute, or preserve\r\nthe general system, and only modify it to the present state of things.\r\nMr. Pendleton, contrary to his usual disposition in favor of ancient\r\nthings, was for the former proposition, in which he was joined by Mr.\r\nLee. To this it was objected, that to abrogate our whole system would\r\nbe a bold measure, and probably far beyond the views of the legislature;\r\nthat they had been in the practice of revising, from time to time,\r\nthe laws of the colony, omitting the expired, the repealed, and the\r\nobsolete, amending only those retained, and probably meant we should\r\nnow do the same, only including the British statutes as well as our own:\r\nthat to compose a new Institute, like those of Justinian and Bracton, or\r\nthat of Blackstone, which was the model proposed by Mr. Pendleton, would\r\nbe an arduous undertaking, of vast research, of great consideration and\r\njudgment; and when reduced to a text, every word of that text, from\r\nthe imperfection of human language, and its incompetence to express\r\ndistinctly every shade of idea, would become a subject of question and\r\nchicanery, until settled by repeated adjudications; that this would\r\ninvolve us for ages in litigation, and render property uncertain, until,\r\nlike the statutes of old, every word had been tried and settled by\r\nnumerous decisions, and by new volumes of reports and commentaries; and\r\nthat no one of us, probably, would undertake such a work, which, to be\r\nsystematical, must be the work of one hand. This last was the opinion of\r\nMr. Wythe, Mr. Mason, and myself. When we proceeded to the distribution\r\nof the work, Mr. Mason excused himself, as, being no lawyer, he felt\r\nhimself unqualified for the work, and he resigned soon after. Mr. Lee\r\nexcused himself on the same ground, and died indeed in a short time. The\r\nother two gentlemen, therefore, and myself, divided the work among\r\nus. The common law and statutes to the 4 James I. (when our separate\r\nlegislature was established) were assigned to me; the British statutes,\r\nfrom that period to the present day, to Mr. Wythe; and the Virginia laws\r\nto Mr. Pendleton. As the law of Descents, and the Criminal law, fell of\r\ncourse within my portion, I wished the committee to settle the leading\r\nprinciples of these, as a guide for me in framing them; and, with\r\nrespect to the first, I proposed to abolish the law of primogeniture,\r\nand to make real estate descendible in parcenery to the next of kin,\r\nas personal property is, by the statute of distribution. Mr. Pendleton\r\nwished to preserve the right of primogeniture; but seeing at once\r\nthat that could not prevail, he proposed we should adopt the Hebrew\r\nprinciple, and give a double portion to the elder son. I observed, that\r\nif the elder son could eat twice as much, or do double work, it might be\r\na natural evidence of his right to a double portion; but being on a par,\r\nin his powers and wants, with his brothers and sisters, he should be on\r\na par also in the partition of the patrimony; and such was the decision\r\nof the other members.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the Criminal law, all were agreed, that the punishment\r\nof death should be abolished, except for treason and murder; and that,\r\nfor other felonies, should be substituted hard labor in the public\r\nworks, and, in some cases, the _Lex talionis_. How this last revolting\r\nprinciple came to obtain our approbation, I do not remember. There\r\nremained, indeed, in our laws, a vestige of it in a single case of a\r\nslave; it was the English law, in the time of the Anglo-Saxons, copied\r\nprobably from the Hebrew law of an ‘eye for an eye, a tooth for a\r\ntooth,’ and it was the law of several ancient people; but the modern\r\nmind had left it far in the rear of its advances. These points, however,\r\nbeing settled, we repaired to our respective homes for the preparation\r\nof the work.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of my part, I thought it material not to vary the\r\ndiction of the ancient statutes by modernizing it, nor to give rise to\r\nnew questions by new expressions. The text of these statutes had been so\r\nfully explained and defined, by numerous adjudications, as scarcely ever\r\nnow to produce a question in our courts. I thought it would be useful,\r\nalso, in all new draughts, to reform the style of the later British\r\nstatutes, and of our own acts of Assembly; which, from their verbosity,\r\ntheir endless tautologies, their involutions of case within case,\r\nand parenthesis within parenthesis, and their multiplied efforts at\r\ncertainty, by saids and afore-saids, by ors and by ands, to make them\r\nmore plain, are really rendered more perplexed and incomprehensible, not\r\nonly to common readers, but to the lawyers themselves. We were\r\nemployed in this work from that time to February, 1779, when we met at\r\nWilliamsburg; that is to say, Mr. Pendleton, Mr. Wythe, and myself; and\r\nmeeting day by day, we examined critically our several parts, sentence\r\nby sentence, scrutinizing and amending, until we had agreed on the\r\nwhole. We then returned home, had fair copies made of our several parts,\r\nwhich were reported to the General Assembly, June 18, 1779, by Mr.\r\nWythe and myself, Mr. Pendleton’s residence being distant, and he having\r\nauthorized us by letter to declare his approbation. We had, in this\r\nwork, brought so much of the Common law as it was thought necessary to\r\nalter, all the British statutes from _Magna Charta_ to the present day,\r\nand all the laws of Virginia, from the establishment of our legislature\r\nin the 4th Jac. I. to the present time, which we thought should be\r\nretained, within the compass of one hundred and twenty-six bills,\r\nmaking a printed folio of ninety pages only. Some bills were taken out,\r\noccasionally, from time to time, and passed; but the main body of the\r\nwork was not entered on by the legislature, until after the general\r\npeace, in 1785, when, by the unwearied exertions of Mr. Madison, in\r\nopposition to the endless quibbles, chicaneries, perversions, vexations,\r\nand delays of lawyers and demi-lawyers, most of the bills were passed by\r\nthe legislature, with little alteration.\r\n\r\nThe bill for establishing religious freedom, the principles of which\r\nhad, to a certain degree, been enacted before, I had drawn in all the\r\nlatitude of reason and right. It still met with opposition; but, with\r\nsome mutilations in the preamble, it was finally passed; and a singular\r\nproposition proved, that its protection of opinion was meant to be\r\nuniversal. Where the preamble declares that coercion is a departure from\r\nthe plan of the holy author of our religion, an amendment was proposed,\r\nby inserting the words ‘Jesus Christ,’ so that it should read, ‘a\r\ndeparture from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our\r\nreligion;’ the insertion was rejected by a great majority, in proof that\r\nthey meant to comprehend, within the mantle of its protection, the Jew\r\nand the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo, and Infidel of\r\nevery denomination.\r\n\r\nBeccaria, and other writers on crimes and punishments, had satisfied the\r\nreasonable world of the unrightfulness and inefficacy of the punishment\r\nof crimes by death; and hard labor on roads, canals, and other public\r\nworks, had been suggested as a proper substitute. The Revisors had\r\nadopted these opinions; but the general idea of our country had not yet\r\nadvanced to that point. The bill, therefore, for proportioning crimes\r\nand punishments, was lost in the House of Delegates by a majority of a\r\nsingle vote. I learned afterwards, that the substitute of hard labor in\r\npublic, was tried (I believe it was in Pennsylvania) without success.\r\nExhibited as a public spectacle, with shaved heads, and mean clothing,\r\nworking on the high roads, produced in the criminals such a prostration\r\nof character, such an abandonment of self-respect, as, instead of\r\nreforming, plunged them into the most desperate and hardened depravity\r\nof morals and character. To pursue the subject of this law.--I was\r\nwritten to in 1785 (being then in Paris) by Directors appointed to\r\nsuperintend the building of a Capitol in Richmond, to advise them as\r\nto a plan, and to add to it one of a Prison. Thinking it a favorable\r\nopportunity of introducing into the state an example of architecture, in\r\nthe classic style of antiquity, and the _Maison Quarrée_ of Nismes,\r\nan ancient Roman temple, being considered as the most perfect model\r\nexisting of what may be called Cubic architecture, I applied to M.\r\nClerissault, who had published drawings of the antiquities of Nismes, to\r\nhave me a model of the building made in stucco, only changing the order\r\nfrom Corinthian to Ionic, on account of the difficulty of the Corinthian\r\ncapitals. I yielded, with reluctance, to the taste of Clerissault,\r\nin his preference of the modern capital of Scamozzi to the more noble\r\ncapital of antiquity. This was executed by the artist whom Choiseul\r\nGouffier had carried with him to Constantinople, and employed, while\r\nAmbassador there, in making those beautiful models of the remains\r\nof Grecian architecture, which are to be seen at Paris. To adapt the\r\nexterior to our use, I drew a plan for the interior, with the apartments\r\nnecessary for legislative, executive, and judiciary purposes; and\r\naccommodated in their size and distribution to the form and dimensions\r\nof the building. These were forwarded to the Directors, in 1786, and\r\nwere carried into execution, with some variations, not for the better,\r\nthe most important of which, however, admit of future correction. With\r\nrespect to the plan of a Prison, requested at the same time, I had heard\r\nof a benevolent society, in England, which had been indulged by the\r\ngovernment, in an experiment of the effect of labor, in solitary\r\nconfinement, on some of their criminals; which experiment had succeeded\r\nbeyond expectation. The same idea had been suggested in France, and an\r\nArchitect of Lyons had proposed a plan of a well contrived edifice, on\r\nthe principle of solitary confinement. I procured a copy, and as it was\r\ntoo large for our purposes, I drew one on a scale less extensive, but\r\nsusceptible of additions as they should be wanting. This I sent to the\r\nDirectors, instead of a plan of a common prison, in the hope that it\r\nwould suggest the idea of labor in solitary confinement, instead of\r\nthat on the public works, which we had adopted in our Revised Code. Its\r\nprinciple, accordingly, but not its exact form, was adopted by Latrobe\r\nin carrying the plan into execution, by the erection of what is now\r\ncalled the Penitentiary, built under his direction. In the mean while,\r\nthe public opinion was ripening, by time, by reflection, and by the\r\nexample of Pennsylvania, where labor on the highways had been tried,\r\nwithout approbation, from 1786 to ‘89, and had been followed by their\r\nPenitentiary system on the principle of confinement and labor, which was\r\nproceeding auspiciously. In 1796, our legislature resumed the subject,\r\nand passed the law for amending the Penal laws of the commonwealth. They\r\nadopted solitary, instead of public, labor, established a gradation in\r\nthe duration of the confinement, approximated the style of the law more\r\nto the modern usage, and, instead of the settled distinctions of murder\r\nand manslaughter, preserved in my bill, they introduced the new terms of\r\nmurder in the first and second degree. Whether these have produced more\r\nor fewer questions of definition, I am not sufficiently informed of our\r\njudiciary transactions, to say. I will here, however, insert the text of\r\nmy bill, with the notes I made in the course of my researches into the\r\nsubject. [See Appendix, Note E.]\r\n\r\nThe acts of Assembly concerning the College of William and Mary, were\r\nproperly within Mr. Pendleton’s portion of the work; but these related\r\nchiefly to its revenue, while its constitution, organization, and scope\r\nof science, were derived from its charter. We thought that on this\r\nsubject, a systematical plan of general education should be proposed,\r\nand I was requested to undertake it. I accordingly prepared three bills\r\nfor the Revisal, proposing three distinct grades of education, reaching\r\nall classes. 1st. Elementary schools, for all children generally, rich\r\nand poor. 2nd. Colleges, for a middle degree of instruction, calculated\r\nfor the common purposes of life, and such as would be desirable for\r\nall who were in easy circumstances. And, 3rd., an ultimate grade for\r\nteaching the sciences generally, and in their highest degree. The first\r\nbill proposed to lay off every county into Hundreds, or Wards, of a\r\nproper size and population for a school, in which reading, writing, and\r\ncommon arithmetic should be taught; and that the whole state should be\r\ndivided into twenty-four districts, in each of which should be a school\r\nfor classical learning, grammar, geography, and the higher branches of\r\nnumerical arithmetic. The second bill proposed to amend the constitution\r\nof William and Mary college, to enlarge its sphere of science, and to\r\nmake it in fact a University. The third was for the establishment of\r\na library. These bills were not acted on until the same year, ‘96, and\r\nthen only so much of the first as provided for elementary schools. The\r\nCollege of William and Mary was an establishment purely of the Church\r\nof England; the Visitors were required to be all of that Church; the\r\nProfessors to subscribe its Thirty-nine Articles; its Students to learn\r\nits Catechism; and one of its fundamental objects was declared to be, to\r\nraise up Ministers for that Church. The religious jealousies, therefore,\r\nof all the dissenters, took alarm lest this might give an ascendancy\r\nto the Anglican sect, and refused acting on that bill. Its local\r\neccentricity, too, and unhealthy autumnal climate, lessened the general\r\ninclination towards it. And in the Elementary bill, they inserted a\r\nprovision which completely defeated it; for they left it to the court\r\nof each county to determine for itself, when this act should be carried\r\ninto execution, within their county. One provision of the bill was, that\r\nthe expenses of these schools should be borne by the inhabitants of\r\nthe county, every one in proportion to his general tax rate. This would\r\nthrow on wealth the education of the poor; and the justices, being\r\ngenerally of the more wealthy class, were unwilling to incur that\r\nburthen, and I believe it was not suffered to commence in a single\r\ncounty. I shall recur again to this subject, towards the close of my\r\nstory, if I should have life and resolution enough to reach that term;\r\nfor I am already tired of talking about myself.\r\n\r\nThe bill on the subject of slaves, was a mere digest of the existing\r\nlaws respecting them, without any intimation of a plan for a future and\r\ngeneral emancipation. It was thought better that this should be kept\r\nback, and attempted only by way of amendment, whenever the bill should\r\nbe brought on. The principles of the amendment, however, were agreed\r\non, that is to say, the freedom of all born after a certain day, and\r\ndeportation at a proper age. But it was found that the public mind would\r\nnot yet bear the proposition, nor will it bear it even at this day. Yet\r\nthe day is not distant when it must bear and adopt it, or worse will\r\nfollow. Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate, than that\r\nthese people are to be free; nor is it less certain that the two\r\nraces, equally free, cannot live in the same government. Nature, habit,\r\nopinion, have drawn indelible lines of distinction between them. It\r\nis still in our power to direct the process of emancipation and\r\ndeportation, peaceably, and in such slow degree, as that the evil will\r\nwear off insensibly, and their place be, _pari passu_, filled up by\r\nfree white laborers. If, on the contrary, it is left to force itself\r\non, human nature must shudder at the prospect held up. We should in vain\r\nlook for an example in the Spanish deportation or deletion of the Moors.\r\nThis precedent would fall far short of our case.\r\n\r\nI considered four of these bills, passed or reported, as forming a\r\nsystem by which every fibre would be eradicated of ancient or future\r\naristocracy; and a foundation laid for a government truly republican.\r\nThe repeal of the laws of entail would prevent the accumulation and\r\nperpetuation of wealth, in select families, and preserve the soil of\r\nthe country from being daily more and more absorbed in mortmain. The\r\nabolition of primogeniture, and equal partition of inheritances, removed\r\nthe feudal and unnatural distinctions which made one member of every\r\nfamily rich, and all the rest poor, substituting equal partition, the\r\nbest of all Agrarian laws. The restoration of the rights of conscience\r\nrelieved the people from taxation for the support of a religion not\r\ntheirs; for the establishment was truly of the religion of the rich, the\r\ndissenting sects being entirely composed of the less wealthy people;\r\nand these, by the bill for a general education, would be qualified\r\nto understand their rights, to maintain them, and to exercise with\r\nintelligence their parts in self-government: and all this would be\r\neffected, without the violation of a single natural right of any\r\none individual citizen. To these, too, might be added, as a further\r\nsecurity, the introduction of the trial by jury into the Chancery\r\ncourts, which have already ingulphed, and continue to ingulph, so great\r\na proportion of the jurisdiction over our property.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of June, 1779, I was appointed Governor of the Commonwealth,\r\nand retired from the legislature. Being elected, also, one of the\r\nVisitors of William and Mary college, a self-electing body, I effected,\r\nduring my residence in Williamsburg that year, a change in the\r\norganization of that institution, by abolishing the Grammar school,\r\nand the two professorships of Divinity and Oriental languages, and\r\nsubstituting a professorship of Law and Police, one of Anatomy,\r\nMedicine, and Chemistry, and one of Modern Languages; and the charter\r\nconfining us to six professorships, We added the Law of Nature and\r\nNations, and the Fine Arts, to the duties of the Moral professor, and\r\nNatural History to those of the professor of Mathematics and Natural\r\nPhilosophy.\r\n\r\nBeing now, as it were, identified with the Commonwealth itself, to write\r\nmy own history, during the two years of my administration, would be to\r\nwrite the public history of that portion of the revolution within this\r\nstate. This has been done by others, and particularly by Mr. Girardin,\r\nwho wrote his Continuation of Burke’s History of Virginia, while at\r\nMilton in this neighborhood, had free access to all my papers while\r\ncomposing it, and has given as faithful an account as I could myself.\r\nFor this portion, therefore, of my own life, I refer altogether to his\r\nhistory. From a belief that, under the pressure of the invasion under\r\nwhich we were then laboring, the public would have more confidence in a\r\nmilitary chief, and that the military commander, being invested with the\r\ncivil power also, both might be wielded with more energy, promptitude,\r\nand effect for the defence of the state, I resigned the administration\r\nat the end of my second year, and General Nelson was appointed to\r\nsucceed me.\r\n\r\nSoon after my leaving Congress, in September, ‘76, to wit, on the last\r\nday of that month, I had been appointed, with Dr. Franklin, to go to\r\nFrance, as a Commissioner to negotiate treaties of alliance and commerce\r\nwith that government. Silas Deane, then in France, acting as agent for\r\nprocuring military stores,* was joined with us in commission. But such\r\nwas the state of my family that I could not leave it, nor could I expose\r\nit to the dangers of the sea, and of capture by the British ships, then\r\ncovering the ocean. I saw, too, that the laboring oar was really at\r\nhome, where much was to be done, of the most permanent interest,\r\nin new-modelling our governments, and much to defend our fanes and\r\nfire-sides from the desolations of an invading enemy, pressing on our\r\ncountry in every point. I declined, therefore, and Dr. Lee was appointed\r\nin my place. On the 15th of June, 1781, I had been appointed, with\r\nMr. Adams, Dr. Franklin, Mr. Jay, and Mr. Laurens, a Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary for negotiating peace, then expected to be effected\r\nthrough the mediation of the Empress of Russia. The same reasons obliged\r\nme still to decline; and the negotiation was in fact never entered on.\r\nBut, in the autumn of the next year, 1782, Congress receiving assurances\r\nthat a general peace would be concluded in the winter and spring, they\r\nrenewed my appointment on the 13th of November of that year. I had, two\r\nmonths before that, lost the cherished companion of my life, in whose\r\naffections, unabated on both sides, I had lived the last ten years in\r\nunchequered happiness. With the public interests, the state of my mind\r\nconcurred in recommending the change of scene proposed; and I accepted\r\nthe appointment, and left Monticello on the 19th of December, 1782,\r\nfor Philadelphia, where I arrived on the 27th. The Minister of France,\r\nLuzerne, offered me a passage in the Romulus frigate, which I accepted;\r\nbut she was then lying a few miles below Baltimore, blocked up in the\r\nice. I remained, therefore, a month in Philadelphia, looking over the\r\npapers in the office of State, in order to possess myself of the general\r\nstate of our foreign relations, and then went to Baltimore, to await\r\nthe liberation of the frigate from the ice. After waiting there nearly\r\na month, we received information that a Provisional treaty of peace\r\nhad been signed by our Commissioners on the 3rd of September, 1782, to\r\nbecome absolute, on the conclusion of peace between France and Great\r\nBritain. Considering my proceeding to Europe as now of no utility to the\r\npublic, I returned immediately to Philadelphia, to take the orders of\r\nCongress, and was excused by them from further proceeding. I therefore\r\nreturned home, where I arrived on the 15th of May, 1783.\r\n\r\n     * His ostensible character was to be that of a merchant, his\r\n     real one that of agent for military supplies, and also for\r\n     sounding the dispositions of the government of France, and\r\n     seeing how far they would favor us, either secretly or\r\n     openly. His appointment had been by the Committee of Foreign\r\n     Correspondence, March, 1776.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of the following month, I was appointed by the legislature\r\na delegate to Congress, the appointment to take place on the 1st of\r\nNovember ensuing, when that of the existing delegation would expire. I\r\naccordingly left home on the 16th of October, arrived at Trenton, where\r\nCongress was sitting, on the 3rd of November, and took my seat on the\r\n4th, on which day Congress adjourned, to meet at Annapolis on the 26th.\r\n\r\nCongress had now become a very small body, and the members very remiss\r\nin their attendance on its duties, insomuch that a majority of the\r\nstates, necessary by the Confederation to constitute a House, even for\r\nminor business, did not assemble until the 13th of December.\r\n\r\nThey, as early as January 7, 1782, had turned their attention to the\r\nmonies current in the several states, and had directed the Financier,\r\nRobert Morris, to report to them a table of rates, at which the foreign\r\ncoins should be received at the treasury. That officer, or rather his\r\nassistant, Gouverneur Morris, answered them on the 15th, in an able and\r\nelaborate statement of the denominations of money current in the several\r\nstates, and of the comparative value of the foreign coins chiefly in\r\ncirculation with us, He went into the consideration of the necessity of\r\nestablishing a standard of value with us, and of the adoption of a money\r\nunit. He proposed for that unit, such a fraction of pure silver as\r\nwould be a common measure of the penny of every state, without leaving\r\na fraction. This common divisor he found to be 1/1440 of a dollar, or\r\n1/1600 the crown sterling. The value of a dollar was, therefore, to be\r\nexpressed by 1440 units, and of a crown by 1600; each unit containing\r\na quarter of a grain of fine silver. Congress turning again their\r\nattention to this subject the following year, the Financier, by a letter\r\nof April 30,1783, further explained and urged the unit he had proposed:\r\nbut nothing more was done on it until the ensuing year, when it was\r\nagain taken up, and referred to a committee, of which I was a member.\r\nThe general views of the Financier were sound, and the principle was\r\ningenious, on which he proposed to found his unit; but it was too minute\r\nfor ordinary use, too laborious for computation, either by the head or\r\nin figures. The price of a loaf of bread, 1/20 of a dollar, would be\r\n72 units. A pound of butter, 1/5 of a dollar, 288 units. A horse, or\r\nbullock, of eighty dollars’ value, would require a notation of six\r\nfigures, to wit, 115,200, and the public debt, suppose of eighty\r\nmillions, would require twelve figures, to wit, 115,200,000,000 units.\r\nSuch a system of money-arithmetic would be entirely unmanageable for the\r\ncommon purposes of society. I proposed, therefore, instead of this,\r\nto adopt the Dollar as our unit of account and payment, and that its\r\ndivisions and subdivisions should be in the decimal ratio. I wrote some\r\nNotes on the subject, which I submitted to the consideration of the\r\nFinancier. I received his answer and adherence to his general system,\r\nonly agreeing to take for his unit one hundred of those he first\r\nproposed, so that a Dollar should be 14 40/100 and a crown 16 units. I\r\nreplied to this, and printed my Notes and Reply on a flying sheet, which\r\nI put into the hands of the members of Congress for consideration, and\r\nthe Committee agreed to report on my principle. This was adopted the\r\nensuing year, and is the system which now prevails. I insert, here, the\r\nNotes and Reply, as showing the different views on which the adoption of\r\nour money system hung. [See Appendix, note F.]The divisions into dismes,\r\ncents, and mills is now so well understood, that it would be easy of\r\nintroduction into the kindred branches of weights and measures. I use,\r\nwhen I travel, an Odometer of Clarke’s invention, which divides the mile\r\ninto cents, and I find every one comprehends a distance readily, when\r\nstated to him in miles and cents; so he would in feet and cents, pounds\r\nand cents, &c.\r\n\r\nThe remissness of Congress, and their permanent session began to be a\r\nsubject of uneasiness; and even some of the legislatures had recommended\r\nto them intermissions, and periodical sessions. As the Confederation had\r\nmade no provision for a visible head of the government, during vacations\r\nof Congress, and such a one was necessary to superintend the executive\r\nbusiness, to receive and communicate with foreign ministers and nations,\r\nand to assemble Congress on sudden and extraordinary emergencies, I\r\nproposed, early in April, the appointment of a committee, to be called\r\nthe ‘Committee of the States,’ to consist of a member from each state,\r\nwho should remain in session during the recess of Congress: that the\r\nfunctions of Congress should be divided into executive and legislative,\r\nthe latter to be reserved, and the former, by a general resolution, to\r\nbe delegated to that Committee. This proposition was afterwards\r\nagreed to; a Committee appointed who entered on duty on the subsequent\r\nadjournment of Congress, quarrelled very soon, split into two parties,\r\nabandoned their post, and left the government without any visible head,\r\nuntil the next meeting of Congress. We have since seen the same thing\r\ntake place, in the Directory of France; and I believe it will for ever\r\ntake place in any Executive consisting of a plurality. Our plan, best, I\r\nbelieve, combines wisdom and practicability, by providing a plurality of\r\nCounsellors, but a single Arbiter for ultimate decision. I was in France\r\nwhen we heard of this schism and separation of our Committee, and,\r\nspeaking with Dr. Franklin of this singular disposition of men to\r\nquarrel, and divide into parties, he gave his sentiments, as usual, by\r\nway of Apologue. He mentioned the Eddystone light-house, in the\r\nBritish channel, as being built on a rock, in the mid-channel, totally\r\ninaccessible in winter, from the boisterous character of that sea, in\r\nthat season; that, therefore, for the two keepers employed to keep up\r\nthe lights, all provisions for the winter were necessarily carried to\r\nthem in autumn, as they could never be visited again till the return of\r\nthe milder season; that, on the first practicable day in the spring, a\r\nboat put off to them with fresh supplies. The boatmen met at the door\r\none of the keepers, and accosted him with a ‘How goes it, friend?’ ‘Very\r\nwell.’ ‘How is your companion?’ ‘I do not know.’ ‘Don’t know? Is not he\r\nhere?’ ‘I can’t tell.’ ‘Have not you seen him to-day?’ ‘No.’ ‘When did\r\nyou see him?’ ‘Not since last fall.’ ‘You have killed him?’ ‘Not\r\nI, indeed.’ They were about to lay hold of him, as having certainly\r\nmurdered his companion; but he desired them to go up stairs and examine\r\nfor themselves. They went up, and there found the other keeper. They had\r\nquarrelled, it seems, soon after being left there, had divided into two\r\nparties, assigned the cares below to one, and those above to the other,\r\nand had never spoken to, or seen, one another since.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our Congress at Annapolis. The definitive treaty of\r\npeace which had been signed at Paris on the 3rd of September, 1783, and\r\nreceived here, could not be ratified without a House of nine states.\r\nOn the 23rd of December, therefore, we addressed letters to the several\r\nGovernors, stating the receipt of the definitive treaty; that seven\r\nstates only were in attendance, while nine were necessary to its\r\nratification; and urging them to press on their delegates the necessity\r\nof their immediate attendance. And on the 26th, to save time, I moved\r\nthat the Agent of Marine (Robert Morris) should be instructed to have\r\nready a vessel at this place, at New York, and at some Eastern port,\r\nto carry over the ratification of the treaty when agreed to. It met the\r\ngeneral sense of the House, but was opposed by Dr. Lee, on the ground\r\nof expense, which it would authorize the Agent to incur for us; and,\r\nhe said, it would be better to ratify at once, and send on the\r\nratification. Some members had before suggested, that seven states were\r\ncompetent to the ratification. My motion was therefore postponed, and\r\nanother brought forward by Mr. Read, of South Carolina, for an immediate\r\nratification. This was debated the 26th and 27th. Read, Lee, Williamson,\r\nand Jeremiah Chase urged that ratification was a mere matter of form;\r\nthat the treaty was conclusive from the moment it was signed by the\r\nministers; that, although the Confederation requires the assent of nine\r\nstates to enter into a treaty, yet, that its conclusion could not be\r\ncalled the entrance into it; that supposing nine states requisite, it\r\nwould be in the power of five states to keep us always at war; that nine\r\nstates had virtually authorized the ratification, having ratified\r\nthe provisional treaty, and instructed their ministers to agree to a\r\ndefinitive one in the same terms, and the present one was, in fact,\r\nsubstantially, and almost verbatim, the same; that there now remain\r\nbut sixty-seven days for the ratification, for its passage across the\r\nAtlantic, and its exchange; that there was no hope of our soon having\r\nnine states present in fact, that this was the ultimate point of time\r\nto which we could venture to wait; that if the ratification was not\r\nin Paris by the time stipulated, the treaty would become void; that if\r\nratified by seven states, it would go under our seal, without its being\r\nknown to Great Britain that only seven had concurred; that it was a\r\nquestion of which they had no right to take cognizance, and we were only\r\nanswerable for it to our constituents; that it was like the ratification\r\nwhich Great Britain had received from the Dutch, by the negotiations of\r\nSir William Temple.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, it was argued by Monroe, Gerry, Howel, Ellery, and\r\nmyself, that by the modern usage of Europe, the ratification was\r\nconsidered as the act which gave validity to a treaty, until which, it\r\nwas not obligatory.* That the commission to the ministers, reserved the\r\nratification to Congress; that the treaty itself stipulated, that it\r\nshould be ratified; that it became a second question, who were competent\r\nto the ratification? That the Confederation expressly required nine\r\nstates to enter into any treaty; that, by this, that instrument must\r\nhave intended, that the assent of nine states should be necessary, as\r\nwell to the completion as to the commencement of the treaty, its object\r\nhaving been to guard the rights of the Union in all those important\r\ncases, where nine states are called for; that by the contrary\r\nconstruction, seven states, containing less than one third of our whole\r\ncitizens, might rivet on us a treaty, commenced indeed under commission\r\nand instructions from nine states, but formed by the minister in express\r\ncontradiction to such instructions, and in direct sacrifice of the\r\ninterests of so great a majority; that the definitive treaty was\r\nadmitted not to be a verbal copy of the provisional one, and whether the\r\ndepartures from it were of substance, or not, was a question on which\r\nnine states alone were competent to decide; that the circumstances\r\nof the ratification of the provisional articles by nine states, the\r\ninstructions to our ministers to form a definitive one by them, and\r\ntheir actual agreement in substance, do not render us competent to\r\nratify in the present instance; if these circumstances are in themselves\r\na ratification, nothing further is requisite than to give attested\r\ncopies of them, in exchange for the British ratification; if they are\r\nnot, we remain where we were, without a ratification by nine states,\r\nand incompetent ourselves to ratify; that it was but four days since the\r\nseven states, now present, unanimously concurred in a resolution to be\r\nforwarded to the Governors of the absent states, in which they stated,\r\nas a cause for urging on their delegates, that nine states were\r\nnecessary to ratify the treaty; that in the case of the Dutch\r\nratification, Great Britain had courted it, and therefore was glad to\r\naccept it as it was; that they knew our Constitution, and would object\r\nto a ratification by seven; that, if that circumstance was kept back,\r\nit would be known hereafter, and would give them ground to deny the\r\nvalidity of a ratification, into which they should have been surprised\r\nand cheated, and it would be a dishonorable prostitution of our seal;\r\nthat there is a hope of nine states; that if the treaty would become\r\nnull, if not ratified in time, it would not be saved by an imperfect\r\nratification; but that, in fact, it would not be null, and would be\r\nplaced on better ground, going in unexceptionable form, though a few\r\ndays too late, and rested on the small importance of this circumstance,\r\nand the physical impossibilities which had prevented a punctual\r\ncompliance in point of time; that this would be approved by all nations,\r\nand by Great Britain herself, if not determined to renew the war, and if\r\nso determined, she would never want excuses, were this out of the way.\r\nMr. Read gave notice, he should call for the yeas and nays; whereon\r\nthose in opposition, prepared a resolution, expressing pointedly the\r\nreasons of their dissent from his motion. It appearing, however, that\r\nhis proposition could not be carried, it was thought better to make no\r\nentry at all. Massachusetts alone would have been for it; Rhode Island,\r\nPennsylvania, and Virginia against it, Delaware, Maryland, and North\r\nCarolina, would have been divided.\r\n\r\nOur body was little numerous, but very contentious. Day after day\r\nwas wasted on the most unimportant questions. A member, one of those\r\nafflicted with the morbid rage of debate, of an ardent mind, prompt\r\nimagination, and copious flow of words, who heard with impatience any\r\nlogic which was not his own, sitting near me on some occasion of a\r\ntrifling but wordy debate, asked me how I could sit in silence, hearing\r\nso much false reasoning, which a word should refute? I observed to\r\nhim, that to refute indeed was easy, but to silence impossible; that\r\nin measures brought forward by myself, I took the laboring oar, as was\r\nincumbent on me; but that in general, I was willing to listen; that if\r\nevery sound argument or objection was used by some one or other of the\r\nnumerous debaters, it was enough; if not, I thought it sufficient to\r\nsuggest the omission, without going into a repetition of what had been\r\nalready said by others: that this was a waste and abuse of the time and\r\npatience of the House, which could not be justified. And I believe,\r\nthat if the members of deliberate bodies were to observe this course\r\ngenerally, they would do in a day, what takes them a week; and it\r\nis really more questionable, than may at first be thought, whether\r\nBonaparte’s dumb legislature, which said nothing, and did much, may not\r\nbe preferable to one which talks much, and does nothing. I served\r\nwith General Washington in the legislature of Virginia, before the\r\nrevolution, and, during it, with Dr. Franklin in Congress. I never heard\r\neither of them speak ten minutes at a time, nor to any but the main\r\npoint, which was to decide the question. They laid their shoulders\r\nto the great points, knowing that the little ones would follow of\r\nthemselves. If the present Congress errs in too much talking, how can it\r\nbe otherwise, in a body to which the people send one hundred and fifty\r\nlawyers, whose trade it is, to question every thing, yield nothing, and\r\ntalk by the hour? That one hundred and fifty lawyers should do business\r\ntogether, ought not to be expected. But to return again to our subject.\r\n\r\nThose, who thought seven states competent to the ratification, being\r\nvery restless under the loss of their motion, I proposed, on the\r\nthird of January, to meet them on middle ground, and therefore moved a\r\nresolution, which premised, that there were but seven states present,\r\nwho were unanimous for the ratification, but that they differed in\r\nopinion on the question of competency; that those however in the\r\nnegative, were unwilling, that any powers which it might be supposed\r\nthey possessed, should remain unexercised for the restoration of\r\npeace, provided it could be done, saving their good faith, and without\r\nimporting any opinion of Congress, that seven states were competent, and\r\nresolving that the treaty be ratified so far as they had power; that\r\nit should be transmitted to our ministers, with instructions to keep it\r\nuncommunicated; to endeavor to obtain three months longer for exchange\r\nof ratifications; that they should be informed, that so soon as nine\r\nstates shall be present, a ratification by nine shall be sent them: if\r\nthis should get to them before the ultimate point of time for exchange,\r\nthey were to use it, and not the other; if not, they were to offer the\r\nact of the seven states in exchange, informing them the treaty had come\r\nto hand while Congress was not in session, that but seven states were as\r\nyet assembled, and these had unanimously concurred in the ratification.\r\nThis was debated on the third and fourth; and on the fifth, a vessel\r\nbeing to sail for England, from this port, (Annapolis), the House\r\ndirected the President to write to our ministers accordingly.\r\n\r\nJanuary 14. Delegates from Connecticut having attended yesterday, and\r\nanother from South Carolina coming in this day, the treaty was ratified\r\nwithout a dissenting voice; and three instruments of ratification were\r\nordered to be made out, one of which was sent by Colonel Harmer, another\r\nby Colonel Franks, and the third transmitted to the Agent of Marine, to\r\nbe forwarded by any good opportunity.\r\n\r\nCongress soon took up the consideration of their foreign relations. They\r\ndeemed it necessary to get their commerce placed, with every nation, on\r\na footing as favorable as that of other nations; and for this purpose,\r\nto propose to each a distinct treaty of commerce. This act too would\r\namount to an acknowledgment, by each, of our independence, and of our\r\nreception into the fraternity of nations; which, although as possessing\r\nour station of right, and, in fact, we would not condescend to ask, we\r\nwere not unwilling to furnish opportunities for receiving their friendly\r\nsalutations and welcome. With France, the United Netherlands, and\r\nSweden, we had already treaties of commerce; but commissions were given\r\nfor those countries also, should any amendments be thought necessary.\r\nThe other states to which treaties were to be proposed, were England,\r\nHamburg, Saxony, Prussia, Denmark, Russia, Austria, Venice, Rome,\r\nNaples, Tuscany, Sardinia, Genoa, Spain, Portugal, the Porte, Algiers,\r\nTripoli, Tunis, and Morocco.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of May, Congress resolved that a Minister Plenipotentiary\r\nshould be appointed, in addition to Mr. Adams and Dr. Franklin, for\r\nnegotiating treaties of commerce with foreign nations, and I was elected\r\nto that duty. I accordingly left Annapolis on the 11th, took with me my\r\neldest daughter; then at Philadelphia (the two others being too young\r\nfor the voyage), and proceeded to Boston, in quest of a passage. While\r\npassing through the different states, I made a point of informing myself\r\nof the state of the commerce of each, went on to New Hampshire with the\r\nsame view, and returned to Boston. Thence I sailed on the 5th of July,\r\nin the Ceres, a merchant ship of Mr. Nathaniel Tracy, bound to Cowes. He\r\nwas himself a passenger, and, after a pleasant voyage of nineteen days,\r\nfrom land to land, we arrived at Cowes on the 26th. I was detained there\r\na few days by the indisposition of my daughter. On the 30th we embarked\r\nfor Havre, arrived there on the 31st, left it on the 3rd of August, and\r\narrived at Paris on the 6th. I called immediately on Dr. Franklin, at\r\nPassy, communicated to him our charge, and we wrote to Mr. Adams, then\r\nat the Hague, to join us at Paris.\r\n\r\nBefore I had left America, that is to say, in the year 1781, 1 had\r\nreceived a letter from M. de Marbois, of the French legation in\r\nPhiladelphia, informing me, he had been instructed by his government to\r\nobtain such statistical accounts of the different states of our Union,\r\nas might be useful for their information; and addressing to me a number\r\nof queries relative to the state of Virginia. I had always made it a\r\npractice, whenever an opportunity occurred of obtaining any information\r\nof our country, which might be of use to me in any station, public or\r\nprivate, to commit it to writing. These memoranda were on loose papers,\r\nbundled up without order, and difficult of recurrence, when I had\r\noccasion for a particular one. I thought this a good occasion to embody\r\ntheir substance, which I did in the order of Mr. Marbois’ queries, so as\r\nto answer his wish, and to arrange them for my own use. Some friends, to\r\nwhom they were occasionally communicated, wished for copies; but their\r\nvolume rendering this too laborious by hand, I proposed to get a few\r\nprinted for their gratification. I was asked such a price however, as\r\nexceeded the importance of the object. On my arrival at Paris, I found\r\nit could be done for a fourth of what I had been asked here. I therefore\r\ncorrected and enlarged them, and had two hundred copies printed, under\r\nthe title of ‘Notes on Virginia.’ I gave a very few copies to some\r\nparticular friends in Europe, and sent the rest to my friends in\r\nAmerica. An European copy, by the death of the owner, got into the hands\r\nof a bookseller, who engaged its translation, and when ready for the\r\npress, communicated his intentions and manuscript to me, suggesting\r\nthat I should correct it, without asking any other permission for the\r\npublication. I never had seen so wretched an attempt at translation.\r\nInterverted, abridged, mutilated, and often reversing the sense of\r\nthe original, I found it a blotch of errors from beginning to end. I\r\ncorrected some of the most material, and, in that form, it was printed\r\nin French. A London bookseller, on seeing the translation, requested me\r\nto permit him to print the English original. I thought it best to do\r\nso, to let the world see that it was not really so bad as the French\r\ntranslation had made it appear. And this is the true history of that\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams soon joined us at Paris, and our first employment was to\r\nprepare a general form, to be proposed to such nations as were disposed\r\nto treat with us. During the negotiations for peace with the British\r\nCommissioner, David Hartley, our Commissioners had proposed, on the\r\nsuggestion of Dr. Franklin, to insert an article, exempting from capture\r\nby the public or private armed ships, of either belligerent, when at\r\nwar, all merchant vessels and their cargoes, employed merely in\r\ncarrying on the commerce between nations. It was refused by England,\r\nand unwisely, in my opinion. For, in the case of a war with us, their\r\nsuperior commerce places infinitely more at hazard on the ocean, than\r\nours; and, as hawks abound in proportion to game, so our privateers\r\nwould swarm, in proportion to the wealth exposed to their prize, while\r\ntheirs would be few, for want of subjects of capture. We inserted\r\nthis article in our form, with a provision against the molestation of\r\nfishermen, husbandmen, citizens unarmed, and following their occupations\r\nin unfortified places, for the humane treatment of prisoners of war, the\r\nabolition of contraband of war, which exposes merchant vessels to such\r\nvexatious and ruinous detentions and abuses; and for the principle of\r\nfree bottoms, free goods.\r\n\r\nIn a conference with the Count de Vergennes, it was thought better to\r\nleave to legislative regulation, on both sides, such modifications of\r\nour commercial intercourse, as would voluntarily flow from amicable\r\ndispositions. Without urging, we sounded the ministers of the several\r\nEuropean nations, at the court of Versailles, on their dispositions\r\ntowards mutual commerce, and the expediency of encouraging it by the\r\nprotection of a treaty. Old Frederic, of Prussia, met us cordially, and\r\nwithout hesitation, and appointing the Baron de Thulemeyer, his minister\r\nat the Hague, to negotiate with us, we communicated to him our Projet,\r\nwhich, with little alteration by the King, was soon concluded. Denmark\r\nand Tuscany entered also into negotiations with us. Other powers\r\nappearing indifferent, we did not think it proper to press them. They\r\nseemed, in fact, to know little about us, but as rebels, who had been\r\nsuccessful in throwing off the yoke of the mother country. They were\r\nignorant of our commerce, which had been always monopolized by England,\r\nand of the exchange of articles it might offer advantageously to both\r\nparties. They were inclined, therefore, to stand aloof, until they could\r\nsee better what relations might be usefully instituted with us. The\r\nnegotiations, therefore, begun with Denmark and Tuscany, we protracted\r\ndesignedly, until our powers had expired; and abstained from making new\r\npropositions to others having no colonies; because our commerce being\r\nan exchange of raw for wrought materials, is a competent price for\r\nadmission into the colonies of those possessing them; but were we to\r\ngive it, without price, to others, all would claim it, without price, on\r\nthe ordinary ground of _gentis amicissimæ_.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams, being appointed Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States\r\nto London, left us in June, and in July, 1785, Dr. Franklin returned to\r\nAmerica, and I was appointed his successor at Paris. In February, 1786,\r\nMr. Adams wrote to me, pressingly, to join him in London immediately,\r\nas he thought he discovered there some symptoms of better disposition\r\ntowards us. Colonel Smith, his secretary of legation, was the bearer of\r\nhis urgencies for my immediate attendance. I, accordingly, left Paris\r\non the 1st of March, and, on my arrival in London, we agreed on a very\r\nsummary form of treaty, proposing an exchange of citizenship for our\r\ncitizens, our ships, and our productions generally, except as to office.\r\nOn my presentation, as usual, to the King and Queen, at their levees, it\r\nwas impossible for any thing to be more ungracious, than their notice\r\nof Mr. Adams and myself. I saw, at once, that the ulcerations of mind\r\nin that quarter left nothing to be expected on the subject of\r\nmy attendance; and, on the first conference with the Marquis of\r\nCaermarthen, the Minister for foreign affairs, the distance and\r\ndisinclination which he betrayed in his conversation, the vagueness\r\nand evasions of his answers to us, confirmed me in the belief of their\r\naversion to have any thing to do with us. We delivered him, however, our\r\n_Projet_, Mr. Adams not despairing as much as I did of its effect.\r\nWe afterwards, by one or more, notes, requested his appointment of an\r\ninterview and conference, which, without directly declining, he evaded,\r\nby pretence of other pressing occupations for the moment. After staying\r\nthere seven weeks, till within a few days of the expiration of our\r\ncommission, I informed the minister, by note, that my duties at Paris\r\nrequired my return to that place, and that I should, with pleasure, be\r\nthe bearer of any commands to his Ambassador there. He answered, that\r\nhe had none, and, wishing me a pleasant journey, I left London the 26th,\r\nand arrived at Paris the 30th of April.\r\n\r\nWhile in London, we entered into negotiations with the Chevalier Pinto,\r\nAmbassador of Portugal, at that place. The only article of difficulty\r\nbetween us was, a stipulation that our bread-stuff should be received\r\nin Portugal, in the form of flour as well as of grain. He approved of it\r\nhimself, but observed that several nobles, of great influence at their\r\ncourt, were the owners of windmills in the neighborhood of Lisbon, which\r\ndepended much for their profits on manufacturing our wheat, and that\r\nthis stipulation would endanger the whole treaty. He signed it, however,\r\nand its fate was what he had candidly portended.\r\n\r\nMy duties, at Paris, were confined to a few objects; the receipt of\r\nour whale-oils, salted fish, and salted meats, on favorable terms; the\r\nadmission of our rice on equal terms with that of Piedmont, Egypt,\r\nand the Levant; a mitigation of the monopolies of our tobacco by the\r\nfarmers-general, and a free admission of our productions into their\r\nislands, were the principal commercial objects which required attention;\r\nand on these occasions, I was powerfully aided by all the influence and\r\nthe energies of the Marquis de la Fayette, who proved himself equally\r\nzealous for the friendship and welfare of both nations; and, in justice,\r\nI must also say, that I found the government entirely disposed to\r\nbefriend us on all occasions, and to yield us every indulgence, not\r\nabsolutely injurious to themselves. The Count de Vergennes had the\r\nreputation with the diplomatic corps, of being wary and slippery in his\r\ndiplomatic intercourse; and so he might be, with those whom he knew\r\nto be slippery, and double-faced themselves. As he saw that I had\r\nno indirect views, practised no subtleties, meddled in no intrigues,\r\npursued no concealed object, I found him as frank, as honorable, as easy\r\nof access to reason, as any man with whom I had ever done business; and\r\nI must say the same for his successor, Montmorin, one of the most honest\r\nand worthy of human beings.\r\n\r\nOur commerce, in the Mediterranean, was placed under early alarm, by the\r\ncapture of two of our vessels and crews by the Barbary cruisers. I was\r\nvery unwilling that we should acquiesce in the European humiliation,\r\nof paying a tribute to those lawless pirates, and endeavored to form an\r\nassociation of the powers subject to habitual depredations from them.\r\nI accordingly prepared, and proposed to their Ministers at Paris,\r\nfor consultation with their governments, articles of a special\r\nconfederation, in the following form.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Proposals for concerted operation among the powers at war with the\r\npiratical States of Barbary.\r\n\r\n‘1. It is proposed, that the several powers at war with the piratical\r\nStates of Barbary, or any two or more of them who shall be willing,\r\nshall enter into a convention to carry on their operations against those\r\nStates, in concert, beginning with the Algerines.\r\n\r\n‘2. This convention shall remain open to any other power, who shall, at\r\nany future time, wish to accede to it; the parties reserving the\r\nright to prescribe the conditions of such accession, according to the\r\ncircumstances existing at the time it shall be proposed.\r\n\r\n‘3. The object of the convention shall be to compel the piratical States\r\nto perpetual peace, without price, and to guaranty that peace to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n‘4. The operations for obtaining this peace shall be constant cruises on\r\ntheir coast, with a naval force now to be agreed on. It is not proposed,\r\nthat this force shall be so considerable, as to be inconvenient to any\r\nparty. It is believed, that half a dozen frigates, with as many tenders\r\nor xebecs, one half of which shall be in cruise, while the other half is\r\nat rest, will suffice.\r\n\r\n‘5. The force agreed to be necessary, shall be furnished by the parties,\r\nin certain quotas, now to be fixed; it being expected, that each will\r\nbe willing to contribute, in such proportion as circumstances may render\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n‘6. As miscarriages often proceed from the want of harmony among\r\nofficers of different nations, the parties shall now consider and\r\ndecide, whether it will not be better to contribute their quotas in\r\nmoney, to be employed in fitting out and keeping on duty a single fleet\r\nof the force agreed on.\r\n\r\n‘7. The difficulties and delays, too, which will attend the management\r\nof these operations, if conducted by the parties themselves separately,\r\ndistant as their courts may be from one another, and incapable of\r\nmeeting in consultation, suggest a question, whether it will not\r\nbe better for them to give full powers, for that purpose, to their\r\nAmbassadors, or other Ministers resident at some one court of Europe,\r\nwho shall form a Committee, or Council, for carrying this convention\r\ninto effect; wherein, the vote of each member shall be computed in\r\nproportion to the quota of his sovereign, and the majority so computed,\r\nshall prevail in all questions within the view of this convention. The\r\ncourt of Versailles is proposed, on account of its neighborhood to the\r\nMediterranean, and because all those powers are represented there, who\r\nare likely to become parties to this convention.\r\n\r\n‘8. To save to that Council the embarrassment of personal solicitations\r\nfor office, and to assure the parties, that their contributions will be\r\napplied solely to the object for which they are destined, there shall\r\nbe no establishment of officers for the said Council, such as\r\nCommissioners, Secretaries, or any other kind, with either salaries\r\nor perquisites, nor any other lucrative appointments, but such whose\r\nfunctions are to be exercised on board the said vessels.\r\n\r\n‘9. Should war arise between any two of the parties to this convention,\r\nit shall not extend to this enterprise, nor interrupt it; but as to\r\nthis, they shall be reputed at peace.\r\n\r\n‘10. When Algiers shall be reduced to peace, the other piratical States,\r\nif they refuse to discontinue their piracies, shall become the objects\r\nof this convention, either successively or together, as shall seem best.\r\n\r\n‘11. Where this convention would interfere with treaties actually\r\nexisting between any of the parties and the said States of Barbary, the\r\ntreaty shall prevail, and such party shall be allowed to withdraw from\r\nthe operations against that state.’\r\n\r\n\r\nSpain had just concluded a treaty with Algiers, at the expense of three\r\nmillions of dollars, and did not like to relinquish the benefit of that,\r\nuntil the other party should fail in their observance of it. Portugal,\r\nNaples, the Two Sicilies, Venice, Malta, Denmark, and Sweden were\r\nfavorably disposed to such an association; but their representatives at\r\nParis expressed apprehensions that France would interfere, and, either\r\nopenly or secretly, support the Barbary powers; and they required, that\r\nI should ascertain the dispositions of the Count de Vergennes on the\r\nsubject. I had before taken occasion to inform him of what we were\r\nproposing, and, therefore, did not think it proper to insinuate\r\nany doubt of the fair conduct of his government; but stating our\r\npropositions, I mentioned the apprehensions entertained by us that\r\nEngland would interfere in behalf of those piratical governments. ‘She\r\ndares not do it,’ said he. I pressed it no further. The other Agents\r\nwere satisfied with this indication of his sentiments, and nothing was\r\nnow wanting to bring it into direct and formal consideration, but\r\nthe assent of our government, and their authority to make the formal\r\nproposition. I communicated to them the favorable prospect of protecting\r\nour commerce from the Barbary depredations, and for such a continuance\r\nof time, as, by an exclusion of them from the sea, to change their\r\nhabits and characters, from a predatory to an agricultural people:\r\ntowards which, however, it was expected they would contribute a\r\nfrigate, and its expenses, to be in constant cruise. But they were in no\r\ncondition to make any such engagement. Their recommendatory powers for\r\nobtaining contributions, were so openly neglected by the several states,\r\nthat they declined an engagement, which they were conscious they could\r\nnot fulfil with punctuality; and so it fell through.\r\n\r\n     [In the original MS., the paragraph ending with ‘fell\r\n     through,’ terminates page 81; between this page and the\r\n     next, there is stitched in a leaf of old writing,\r\n     constituting a memorandum, whereof note G, in the Appendix,\r\n     is a copy.]\r\n\r\nIn 1786, while at Paris, I became acquainted with John Ledyard, of\r\nConnecticut, a man of genius, of some science, and of fearless courage\r\nand enterprise. He had accompanied Captain Cook in his voyage to the\r\nPacific, had distinguished himself on several occasions by an unrivalled\r\nintrepidity, and published an account of that voyage, with details\r\nunfavorable to Cook’s deportment towards the savages, and lessening our\r\nregrets at his fate; Ledyard had come to Paris, in the hope of forming\r\na company to engage in the fur-trade of the Western coast of America. He\r\nwas disappointed in this, and being out of business, and of a roaming,\r\nrestless character, I suggested to him the enterprise of exploring the\r\nWestern part of our continent, by passing through St. Petersburg to\r\nKamtschatka, and procuring a passage thence in some of the Russian\r\nvessels to Nootka sound, whence he might make his way across the\r\ncontinent to the United States; and I undertook to have the permission\r\nof the Empress of Russia solicited. He eagerly embraced the proposition,\r\nand M. de Semoulin, the Russian Ambassador, and more particularly\r\nBaron Grimm, the special correspondent of the Empress, solicited her\r\npermission for him to pass through her dominions, to the Western coast\r\nof America. And here I must correct a material error, which I have\r\ncommitted in another place, to the prejudice of the Empress. In writing\r\nsome notes of the life of Captain Lewis, prefixed to his ‘Expedition to\r\nthe Pacific,’ I stated, that the Empress gave the permission asked, and\r\nafterwards retracted it. This idea, after a lapse of twenty-six years,\r\nhad so insinuated itself into my mind, that I committed it to paper,\r\nwithout the least suspicion of error. Yet I find, on returning to my\r\nletters of that date, that the Empress refused permission at once,\r\nconsidering the enterprise as entirely chimerical. But Ledyard would\r\nnot relinquish it, persuading himself, that, by proceeding to St.\r\nPetersburg, he could satisfy the Empress of its practicability, and\r\nobtain her permission. He went accordingly, but she was absent on a\r\nvisit to some distant part of her dominions, and he pursued his course\r\nto within two hundred miles of Kamtschatka, where he was overtaken by an\r\narrest from the Empress, brought back to Poland, and there dismissed.\r\nI must, therefore, in justice, acquit the Empress of ever having for\r\na moment countenanced, even by the indulgence of an innocent passage\r\nthrough her territories, this interesting enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe pecuniary distresses of France produced this year a measure,\r\nof which there had been no example for near two centuries; and the\r\nconsequences of which, good and evil, are not yet calculable. For its\r\nremote causes, we must go a little back.\r\n\r\nCelebrated writers of France and England had already sketched good\r\nprinciples on the subject of government: yet the American Revolution\r\nseems first to have awakened the thinking part of the French nation\r\nin general from the sleep of despotism in which they were sunk. The\r\nofficers, too, who had been to America, were mostly young men, less\r\nshackled by habit and prejudice, and more ready to assent to the\r\nsuggestions of common sense, and feeling of common rights, than\r\nothers. They came back with new ideas and impressions. The press,\r\nnotwithstanding its shackles, began to disseminate them; conversation\r\nassumed new freedoms; politics became the theme of all societies, male\r\nand female, and a very extensive and zealous party was formed, which\r\nacquired the appellation of the Patriotic party, who, sensible of the\r\nabusive government under which they lived, sighed for occasions for\r\nreforming it. This party comprehended all the honesty of the kingdom,\r\nsufficiently at leisure to think, the men of letters, the easy\r\nBourgeois, the young nobility, partly from reflection, partly from mode;\r\nfor these sentiments became matter of mode, and, as such, united most\r\nof the young women to the party. Happily for the nation, it happened,\r\nat the same moment, that the dissipations of the queen and court, the\r\nabuses of the pension-list, and dilapidations in the administration of\r\nevery branch of the finances, had exhausted the treasures and credit of\r\nthe nation, insomuch, that its most necessary functions were paralyzed.\r\nTo reform these abuses would have overset the Minister; to impose new\r\ntaxes by the authority of the king, was known to be impossible, from the\r\ndetermined opposition of the Parliament to their enregistry. No resource\r\nremained, then, but to appeal to the nation. He advised, therefore, the\r\ncall of an Assembly of the most distinguished characters of the nation,\r\nin the hope, that, by promises of various and valuable improvements in\r\nthe organization and regimen of the government, they would be induced to\r\nauthorize new taxes, to control the opposition of the Parliament, and\r\nto raise the annual revenue to the level of expenditures. An Assembly of\r\nNotables, therefore, about one hundred and fifty in number, named by the\r\nKing, convened on the 22nd of February. The Minister (Calonne) stated to\r\nthem, that the annual excess of expenses beyond the revenue, when Louis\r\nXVI. came to the throne, was thirty-seven millions of livres; that four\r\nhundred and forty millions had been borrowed to re-establish the navy;\r\nthat the American war had cost them fourteen hundred and forty millions\r\n(two hundred and fifty-six millions of dollars), and that the interest\r\nof these sums, with other increased expenses, had added forty millions\r\nmore to the annual deficit. (But a subsequent and more candid estimate\r\nmade it fifty-six millions.) He proffered them an universal redress\r\nof grievances, laid open those grievances fully, pointed out sound\r\nremedies, and, covering his canvass with objects of this magnitude, the\r\ndeficit dwindled to a little accessory, scarcely attracting attention.\r\nThe persons chosen, were the most able and independent characters in the\r\nkingdom, and their support, if it could be obtained, would be enough\r\nfor him. They improved the occasion for redressing their grievances,\r\nand agreed that the public wants should be relieved; but went into an\r\nexamination of the causes of them. It was supposed that Calonne was\r\nconscious that his accounts could not bear examination; and it was said,\r\nand believed, that he asked of the King, to send four members to the\r\nBastile, of whom the Marquis de la Fayette was one, to banish twenty\r\nothers, and two of his Ministers. The King found it shorter to banish\r\nhim. His successor went on in full concert with the Assembly. The\r\nresult was an augmentation of the revenue, a promise of economies in\r\nits expenditure, of an annual settlement of the public accounts before a\r\ncouncil, which the Comptroller, having been heretofore obliged to\r\nsettle only with the King in person, of course never settled at all; an\r\nacknowledgment that the King could not lay a new tax, a reformation\r\nof the Criminal laws, abolition of torture, suppression of _corvees_,\r\nreformation of the _gabelles_, removal of the interior custom-houses,\r\nfree commerce of grain, internal and external, and the establishment of\r\nProvincial Assemblies; which, altogether, constituted a great mass of\r\nimprovement in the condition of the nation. The establishment of the\r\nProvincial Assemblies was, in itself, a fundamental improvement. They\r\nwould be, of the choice of the people, one third renewed every year, in\r\nthose provinces where there are no states, that is to say, over\r\nabout three fourths of the kingdom. They would be partly an Executive\r\nthemselves, and partly an Executive Council to the Intendant, to whom\r\nthe executive power, in his province, had been heretofore entirely\r\ndelegated. Chosen by the people, they would soften the execution of\r\nhard laws, and, having a right of representation to the King, they\r\nwould censure bad laws, suggest good ones, expose abuses, and their\r\nrepresentations, when united, would command respect. To the other\r\nadvantages, might be added the precedent itself of calling the Assemblée\r\ndes Notables, which would perhaps grow into habit. The hope was, that\r\nthe improvements thus promised would be carried into effect; that they\r\nwould be maintained during the present reign, and that that would be\r\nlong enough for them to take some root in the constitution, so that they\r\nmight come to be considered as a part of that, and be protected by time,\r\nand the attachment of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Vergennes had died a few days before the meeting of the\r\nAssembly, and the Count de Montmorin had been named Minister of foreign\r\naffairs, in his place. Villedeuil succeeded Calonne, as Comptroller\r\nGeneral, and Lomenie de Brienne, Archbishop of Toulouse, afterwards of\r\nSens, and ultimately Cardinal Lomenie, was named Minister principal,\r\nwith whom the other Ministers were to transact the business of their\r\ndepartments, heretofore done with the King in person; and the Duke de\r\nNivernois, and M. de Malesherbes, were called to the Council. On the\r\nnomination of the Minister principal, the Marshals de Segur and de\r\nCastries retired from the departments of War and Marine, unwilling to\r\nact subordinately, or to share the blame of proceedings taken out of\r\ntheir direction. They were succeeded by the Count de Brienne, brother\r\nof the Prime Minister, and the Marquis de la Luzerne, brother to him who\r\nhad been Minister in the United States.\r\n\r\nA dislocated wrist, unsuccessfully set, occasioned advice from\r\nmy surgeon, to try the mineral waters of Aix, in Provence, as a\r\ncorroborant. I left Paris for that place therefore, on the 28th of\r\nFebruary, and proceeded up the Seine, through Champagne and Burgundy,\r\nand down the Rhone through the Beaujolais by Lyons, Avignon, Nismes, to\r\nAix; where, finding on trial no benefit from the waters, I concluded to\r\nvisit the rice country of Piedmont, to see if any thing might be learned\r\nthere, to benefit the rivalship of our Carolina rice with that, and\r\nthence to make a tour of the seaport towns of France, along its Southern\r\nand Western coast, to inform myself, if any thing could be done to\r\nfavor our commerce with them. From Aix, therefore, I took my route by\r\nMarseilles, Toulon, Hieres, Nice, across the Col de Tende, by Coni,\r\nTurin, Vercelli, Novara, Milan, Pavia, Novi, Genoa. Thence, returning\r\nalong the coast by Savona. Noli, Albenga, Oneglia, Monaco, Nice,\r\nAntibes, Frejus, Aix, Marseilles, Avignon, Nismes, Montpellier,\r\nFrontignan, Sette, Agde, and along the canal of Languedoc, by Beziers,\r\nNarbonne, Carcassonne, Castelnaudari, through the Souterrain of St.\r\nFeriol, and back by Castelnaudari, to Toulouse; thence to Montauban,\r\nand down the Garonne by Langon to Bordeaux. Thence to Rochefort, la\r\nRochelle, Nantes, L’Orient; then back by Rennes to Nantes, and up the\r\nLoire by Angers, Tours, Amboise, Blois, to Orleans, thence direct to\r\nParis, where I arrived on the 10th of June. Soon after my return from\r\nthis journey, to wit, about the latter part of July, I received my\r\nyounger daughter, Maria, from Virginia, by the way of London, the\r\nyoungest having died some time before.\r\n\r\nThe treasonable perfidy of the Prince of Orange, Stadtholder and Captain\r\nGeneral of the United Netherlands, in the war which England waged\r\nagainst them, for entering into a treaty of commerce with the United\r\nStates, is known to all. As their Executive officer, charged with the\r\nconduct of the war, he contrived to baffle all the measures of the\r\nStates General, to dislocate all their military plans, and played false\r\ninto the hands of England against his own country, on every possible\r\noccasion, confident in her protection, and in that of the King of\r\nPrussia, brother to his Princess. The States General, indignant at\r\nthis patricidal conduct, applied to France for aid, according to the\r\nstipulations of the treaty, concluded with her in ‘85. It was assured\r\nto them readily, and in cordial terms, in a letter from the Count de\r\nVergennes, to the Marquis de Verac, Ambassador of France at the Hague,\r\nof which the following is an extract.\r\n\r\n‘_Extrait de la dépêche de Monsieur le Comte de Vergennes à Monsieur le\r\nMarquis de Verac, Ambassadeurde France à la Haye, du ler Mars, 1786.\r\n\r\n‘Le Roi concourrera, autant qu’il sera en son pouvoir, au succès de la\r\nchose, et vous inviterez, de sa part, les Patriotes de lui communiquer\r\nleurs vues, leurs plans, et leurs envies. Vous les assurerez, que le\r\nroi prend un interêt véritable à leurs personnes cornme à leur cause, et\r\nqu’ils peuvent compter sur sa protection. Us doivent y compter d’autant\r\nplus, Monsieur, que nous ne dissimulons pas, que si Monsieur le\r\nStadtholder reprend son ancienne influence, le système Anglois ne\r\ntardera pas de prévaloir, et que notre alliance deviendroit un être de\r\nraison. Les Patriotes sentiront facilement, que cette position seroit\r\nincompatible avec la dignité, comme avec la considération de sa Majesté.\r\nMais dans le cas, Monsieur, ou les chefs des Patriotes auroient à\r\ncraindre une scission, ils auroient le temps suffisant peur ramener ceux\r\nde leurs amis, que les Anglomanes ont égarés, et préparer les choses,\r\nde maniere que la question de nouveau mise en délibération, soit decidée\r\nselon leurs desirs. Dans cette hypothèse, le roi vous autorise à agir\r\nde concert avec eux, de suivre la direction qu’ils jugeront devoir\r\nvous donner, et d’employer tous les moyens pour augmenter le nombre des\r\npartisans de la bonne cause. Il me reste, Monsieur, de vous parler de la\r\nsureté personelle des Patriotes. Vous les assurerez, que dans tout état\r\nde cause, le roi les prend sous sa protection immédiate, et vous\r\nferez connoître, partout où vous le jugerez nécessaire, que sa Majesté\r\nregarderoit comme une offense personelle, tout ce qu’on entreprenderoit\r\ncontre leur liberté. Il est á presumer que ce langage, tenu avec\r\nénergie, en imposera á l’audace des Anglomanes, et que Monsieur\r\nle Prince de Nassau croira courir quelque risque en provoquant le\r\nressentiment de sa Majesté.’_ *\r\n\r\n     [*Extract from the despatch of the Count de Vergennes, to\r\n     the Marquis de Verac, Ambassador from France, at the Hague,\r\n     dated March 1, 1788.\r\n\r\n     ‘The King will give his aid, as far as may be in his power,\r\n     towards the success of the affair, and you will, on his\r\n     part, invite the Patriots to communicate to him their views,\r\n     their plans, and their discontents. You may assure them,\r\n     that the King takes a real interest in themselves, as well\r\n     as their cause, and that they may rely upon his protection.\r\n     On this they may place the greater dependence, as we do not\r\n     conceal, that if the Stadtholder resumes his former\r\n     influence, the English system will soon prevail, and our\r\n     alliance become a mere affair of the imagination. The\r\n     Patriots will readily feel, that this position would be\r\n     incompatible both with the dignity and consideration of his\r\n     Majesty. But in case the chief of the Patriots should have\r\n     to fear a division, they would have time sufficient to\r\n     reclaim those whom the Anglomaniacs had misled, and to\r\n     prepare matters in such a manner, that the question when\r\n     again agitated, might be decided according to their wishes.\r\n     In such a hypothetical case, the King authorizes you to act\r\n     in concert with them, to pursue the direction which they may\r\n     think proper to give you, and to employ every means to\r\n     augment the number of the partisans of the good cause. It\r\n     remains for me to speak of the personal security of the\r\n     Patriots. You may assure them, that under every\r\n     circumstance, the King will take them under his immediate\r\n     protection, and you will make known wherever you may judge\r\n     necessary, that his Majesty will regard, as a personal\r\n     offence, every undertaking against their libeity. It is to\r\n     be presumed that this language, energetically maintained,\r\n     may have some effect on the audacity of the Anglomaniacs,\r\n     and that the Prince de Nassau will feel that he runs some\r\n     risk in provoking the resentment of his Majesty.’]\r\n\r\nThis letter was communicated by the Patriots to me, when at Amsterdam,\r\nin 1788, and a copy sent by me to Mr. Jay, in my letter to him of March\r\n16, 1788.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Patriots was, to establish a representative and\r\nrepublican government. The majority of the States General were with\r\nthem, but the majority of the populace of the towns was with the Prince\r\nof Orange; and that populace was played off with great effect by the\r\ntriumvirate of * * * Harris, the English Ambassador, afterwards Lord\r\nMalmesbury, the Prince of Orange, a stupid man, and the Princess, as\r\nmuch a man as either of her colleagues, in audaciousness, in enterprise,\r\nand in the thirst of domination. By these, the mobs of the Hague were\r\nexcited against the members of the States General; their persons were\r\ninsulted, and endangered in the streets; the sanctuary of their houses\r\nwas violated; and the Prince, whose function and duty it was to repress\r\nand punish these violations of order, took no steps for that purpose.\r\nThe States General, for their own protection, were therefore obliged to\r\nplace their militia under the command of a Committee. The Prince filled\r\nthe courts of London and Berlin with complaints at this usurpation of\r\nhis prerogatives, and, forgetting that he was but the first servant of a\r\nRepublic, marched his regular troops against the city of Utrecht, where\r\nthe States were in session. They were repulsed by the militia. His\r\ninterests now became marshaled with those of the public enemy, and\r\nagainst his own country. The States, therefore, exercising their rights\r\nof sovereignty, deprived him of all his powers. The great Frederic\r\nhad died in August, ‘86. He had never intended to break with France in\r\nsupport of the Prince of Orange. During the illness of which he died,\r\nhe had, through the Duke of Brunswick, declared to the Marquis de\r\nla Fayette, who was then at Berlin, that he meant not to support the\r\nEnglish interest in Holland: that he might assure the government of\r\nFrance, his only wish was, that some honorable place in the Constitution\r\nshould be reserved for the Stadtholder and his children, and that he\r\nwould take no part in the quarrel, unless an entire abolition of the\r\nStadtholderate should be attempted. But his place was now occupied by\r\nFrederic William, his great nephew, a man of little understanding, much\r\ncaprice, and very inconsiderate: and the Princess, his sister, although\r\nher husband was in arms against the legitimate authorities of the\r\ncountry, attempting to go to Amsterdam, for the purpose of exciting the\r\nmobs of that place, and being refused permission to pass a military post\r\non the way, he put the Duke of Brunswick at the head of twenty thousand\r\nmen, and made demonstrations of marching on Holland. The King of France\r\nhereupon declared, by his Chargé des Affaires in Holland, that if\r\nthe Prussian troops continued to menace Holland with an invasion, his\r\nMajesty, in quality of Ally, was determined to succor that province. In\r\nanswer to this, Eden gave official information to Count Montmorin, that\r\nEngland must consider as at an end, its convention with France relative\r\nto giving notice of its naval armaments, and that she was arming\r\ngenerally. War being now imminent, Eden, since Lord Aukland, questioned\r\nme on the effect of our treaty with France, in the case of a war,\r\nand what might be our dispositions. I told him frankly, and without\r\nhesitation, that our dispositions would be neutral, and that I thought\r\nit would be the interest of both these powers that we should be so;\r\nbecause, it would relieve both from all anxiety as to feeding their West\r\nIndia islands; that, England, too, by suffering us to remain so, would\r\navoid a heavy land war on our Continent, which might very much cripple\r\nher proceedings elsewhere; that our treaty, indeed, obliged us to\r\nreceive into our ports the armed vessels of France, with their prizes,\r\nand to refuse admission to the prizes made on her by her enemies: that\r\nthere was a clause, also, by which we guaranteed to France her American\r\npossessions, which might perhaps force us into the war, if these were\r\nattacked. ‘Then it will be war,’ said he, ‘for they will assuredly\r\nbe attacked.’ Liston, at Madrid, about the same time, made the same\r\nenquiries of Carmichael. The government of France then declared a\r\ndetermination to form a camp of observation at Givet, commenced arming\r\nher marine, and named the Bailli de Suffrein their Generalissimo on the\r\nOcean. She secretly engaged, also, in negotiations with Russia, Austria,\r\nand Spain, to form a quadruple alliance. The Duke of Brunswick having\r\nadvanced to the confines of Holland, sent some of his officers to Givet,\r\nto reconnoitre the state of things there, and report them to him. He\r\nsaid afterwards, that ‘if there, had been only a few tents at that\r\nplace, he should not have advanced further, for that the king would not,\r\nmerely for the interest of his sister, engage in a war with France.’\r\nBut, finding that there was not a single company there, he boldly\r\nentered the country, took their towns as fast as he presented himself\r\nbefore them, and advanced on Utrecht. The States had appointed the\r\nRhingrave of Salm their Commander in chief; a Prince without talents,\r\nwithout courage, and without principle. He might have held out in\r\nUtrecht, for a considerable time, but he surrendered the place without\r\nfiring a gun, literally ran away and hid himself, so that for months it\r\nwas not known what was become of him. Amsterdam was then attacked,\r\nand capitulated. In the mean time, the negotiations for the quadruple\r\nalliance were proceeding favorably; but the secrecy with which they were\r\nattempted to be conducted, was penetrated by Fraser, Chargé des Affaires\r\nof England at St. Petersburg, who instantly notified his court, and gave\r\nthe alarm to Prussia. The King saw at once what would be his situation,\r\nbetween the jaws of France, Austria, and Russia. In great dismay, he\r\nbesought the court of London not to abandon him, sent Alvensleben to\r\nParis to explain and soothe; and England, through the Duke of Dorset\r\nand Eden, renewed her conferences for accommodation. The Archbishop,\r\nwho shuddered at the idea of war, and preferred a peaceful surrender\r\nof right, to an armed vindication of it, received them with open\r\narms, entered into cordial conferences, and a declaration, and\r\ncounter-declaration, were cooked up at Versailles, and sent to London\r\nfor approbation. They were approved there, reached Paris at one o’clock\r\nof the 27th, and were signed that night at Versailles. It was said and\r\nbelieved at Paris, that M. de Montrnorin, literally ‘pleuroit cotnrae\r\nun enfant,’ when obliged to sign this counter-declaration; so distressed\r\nwas he by the dishonor of sacrificing the Patriots, after assurances so\r\nsolemn of protection, and absolute encouragement to proceed. The Prince\r\nof Orange was reinstated in all his powers, now become regal. A great\r\nemigration of the Patriots took place; all were deprived of office, many\r\nexiled, and their property confiscated. They were received in France,\r\nand subsisted, for some time, on her bounty. Thus fell Holland, by the\r\ntreachery of her Chief, from her honorable independence, to become\r\na province of England; and so, also, her Stadtholder, from the high\r\nstation of the first citizen of a free Republic, to be the servile\r\nViceroy of a foreign Sovereign. And this was effected by a mere scene of\r\nbullying and demonstration; not one of the parties, France, England,\r\nor Prussia, having ever really meant to encounter actual war for the\r\ninterest of the Prince of Orange. But it had all the effect of a real\r\nand decisive war.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur first essay, in America, to establish a federative government\r\nhad fallen, on trial, very short of its object. During the war of\r\nIndependence, while the pressure of an external enemy hooped us\r\ntogether, and their enterprises kept us necessarily on the alert,\r\nthe spirit of the people, excited by danger, was a supplement to the\r\nConfederation, and urged them to zealous exertions, whether claimed by\r\nthat instrument or not; but, when peace and safety were restored, and\r\nevery man became engaged in useful and profitable occupation, less\r\nattention was paid to the calls of Congress. The fundamental defect\r\nof the Confederation was, that Congress was not authorized to act\r\nimmediately on the people, and by its own officers. Their power was\r\nonly requisitory, and these requisitions were addressed to the several\r\nLegislatures, to be by them carried into execution, without other\r\ncoercion than the moral principle of duty. This allowed, in fact, a\r\nnegative to every legislature, on every measure proposed by Congress; a\r\nnegative so frequently exercised in practice, as to benumb the action\r\nof the Federal government, and to render it inefficient in its general\r\nobjects, and more especially in pecuniary and foreign concerns. The\r\nwant, too, of a separation of the Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary\r\nfunctions, worked disadvantageously in practice. Yet this state of\r\nthings afforded a happy augury of the future march of our Confederacy,\r\nwhen it was seen that the good sense and good dispositions of the\r\npeople, as soon as they perceived the incompetence of their first\r\ncompact, instead of leaving its correction to insurrection and civil\r\nwar, agreed, with one voice, to elect deputies to a general Convention,\r\nwho should peaceably meet and agree on such a Constitution as ‘would\r\nensure peace, justice, liberty, the common defence, and general\r\nwelfare.’\r\n\r\nThis Convention met at Philadelphia on the 25th of May, ‘87. It sat with\r\nclosed doors, and kept all its proceedings secret, until its dissolution\r\non the 17th of September, when the results of its labors were published\r\nall together. I received a copy, early in November, and read and\r\ncontemplated its provisions with great satisfaction. As not a member of\r\nthe Convention, however, nor probably a single citizen of the Union, had\r\napproved it in all its parts, so I, too, found articles which I thought\r\nobjectionable. The absence of express declarations ensuring freedom\r\nof religion, freedom of the press, freedom of the person under the\r\nuninterrupted protection of the _habeas corpus_ and trial by jury\r\nin civil, as well as in criminal cases, excited my jealousy; and\r\nthe re-eligibility of the President for life, I quite disapproved. I\r\nexpressed freely, in letters to my friends, and most particularly to Mr.\r\nMadison and General Washington, my approbations and objections. How\r\nthe good should be secured, and the ill brought to rights, was the\r\ndifficulty. To refer it back to a new Convention, might endanger the\r\nloss of the whole. My first idea was, that the nine states first acting,\r\nshould accept it unconditionally, and thus secure what in it was good,\r\nand that the four last should accept on the previous condition, that\r\ncertain amendments should be agreed to; but a better course was devised,\r\nof accepting the whole, and trusting that the good sense and honest\r\nintentions of our citizens would make the alterations which should be\r\ndeemed necessary. Accordingly, all accepted, six without objection, and\r\nseven with recommendations of specified amendments. Those respecting the\r\npress, religion, and juries, with several others, of great value, were\r\naccordingly made; but the _habeas corpus_ was left to the discretion of\r\nCongress, and the amendment against the re-eligibility of the President\r\nwas not proposed. My fears of that feature were founded on the\r\nimportance of the office, on the fierce contentions it might\r\nexcite among ourselves, if continuable for life, and the dangers of\r\ninterference, either with money or arms, by foreign nations, to whom the\r\nchoice of an American President might become interesting. Examples\r\nof this abounded in history; in the case of the Roman Emperors, for\r\ninstance; of the Popes, while of any significance; of the German\r\nEmperors; the Kings of Poland, and the Deys of Barbary. I had observed,\r\ntoo, in the feudal history, and in the recent instance, particularly,\r\nof the Stadtholder of Holland, how easily offices, or tenures for life,\r\nslide into inheritances. My wish, therefore, was that the President\r\nshould be elected for seven years, and be ineligible afterwards. This\r\nterm I thought sufficient to enable him, with the concurrence of the\r\nLegislature, to carry though and establish any system of improvement he\r\nshould propose for the general good. But the practice adopted, I think,\r\nis better, allowing his continuance for eight years, with a liability to\r\nbe dropped at half way of the term, making that a period of probation.\r\nThat his continuance should be restrained to seven years, was the\r\nopinion of the Convention at an earlier stage of its session, when it\r\nvoted that term, by a majority of eight against two, and by a simple\r\nmajority, that he should be ineligible a second time. This opinion was\r\nconfirmed by the House so late as July 26, referred to the Committee of\r\ndetail, reported favorably by them, and changed to the present form by\r\nfinal vote, on the last day, but one only, of their session. Of this\r\nchange, three states expressed their disapprobation; New York, by\r\nrecommending an amendment, that the President should not be eligible\r\na third time, and Virginia and North Carolina, that he should not be\r\ncapable of serving more than eight, in any term of sixteen years; and\r\nalthough this amendment has not been made in form, yet practice seems\r\nto have established it. The example of four Presidents, voluntarily\r\nretiring at the end of their eighth year, and the progress of public\r\nopinion, that the principle is salutary, have given it in practice the\r\nforce of precedent and usage; insomuch, that should a President consent\r\nto be a candidate for a third election, I trust he would be rejected, on\r\nthis demonstration of ambitious views.\r\n\r\nBut there was another amendment, of which none of us thought at the\r\ntime, and in the omission of which, lurks the germ that is to destroy\r\nthis happy combination of National powers, in the general government,\r\nfor matters of National concern, and independent powers in the States,\r\nfor what concerns the States severally. In England, it was a great point\r\ngained at the Revolution, that the commissions of the Judges, which had\r\nhitherto been during pleasure, should thenceforth be made during good\r\nbehavior. A Judiciary, dependant on the will of the King, had proved\r\nitself the most oppressive of all tools in the hands of that magistrate.\r\nNothing, then, could be more salutary, than a change there, to the\r\ntenure of good behavior; and the question of good behavior, left to the\r\nvote of a simple majority in the two Houses of Parliament. Before\r\nthe Revolution, we were all good English Whigs, cordial in their free\r\nprinciples, and in their jealousies of their Executive magistrate. These\r\njealousies are very apparent, in all our state Constitutions; and, in\r\nthe General government in this instance, we have gone even beyond\r\nthe English caution, by requiring a vote of two thirds, in one of the\r\nHouses, for removing a Judge; a vote so impossible, where * any defence\r\nis made, before men of ordinary prejudices and passions, that our Judges\r\nare effectually independent of the nation. But this ought not to be. I\r\nwould not, indeed, make them dependant on the Executive authority,\r\nas they formerly were in England; but I deem it indispensable to the\r\ncontinuance of this government, that they should be submitted to some\r\npractical and impartial control; and that this, to be impartial, must\r\nbe compounded of a mixture of State and Federal authorities. It is not\r\nenough, that honest men are appointed Judges. All know the influence\r\nof interest on the mind of man, and how unconsciously his judgment\r\nis warped by that influence. To this bias add that of the _esprit de\r\ncorps_, of their peculiar maxim and creed, that ‘it is the office of\r\na good Judge to enlarge his jurisdiction,’ and the absence of\r\nresponsibility; and how can we expect impartial decision between the\r\nGeneral government, of which they are themselves so eminent a part, and\r\nan individual state, from which they have nothing to hope or fear? We\r\nhave seen, too, that, contrary to all correct example, they are in\r\nthe habit of going out of the question before them, to throw an anchor\r\nahead, and grapple further hold for future advances of power. They are\r\nthen, in fact, the corps of sappers and miners, steadily working to\r\nundermine the independent rights of the states, and to consolidate all\r\npower in the hands of that government, in which they have so important a\r\nfreehold estate. But it is not by the consolidation, or concentration\r\nof powers, but by their distribution, that good government is effected.\r\nWere not this great country already divided into states, that division\r\nmust be made, that each might do for itself what concerns itself\r\ndirectly, and what it can so much better do than a distant authority.\r\nEvery state again is divided into counties, each to take care of what\r\nlies within its local bounds; each county again into townships or wards,\r\nto manage minuter details; and every ward into farms, to be governed\r\neach by its individual proprietor. Were we directed from Washington\r\nwhen to sow, and when to reap, we should soon want bread. It is by this\r\npartition of cares, descending in gradation from general to particular,\r\nthat the mass of human affairs may be best managed, for the good and\r\nprosperity of all. I repeat, that I do not charge the judges with wilful\r\nand ill-intentioned error; but honest error must be arrested, where\r\nits toleration leads to public ruin. As, for the safety of society,\r\nwe commit honest maniacs to Bedlam, so judges should be withdrawn from\r\ntheir bench, whose erroneous biases are leading us to dissolution.\r\nIt may, indeed, injure them in fame or in fortune; but it saves the\r\nRepublic, which is the first and supreme law.\r\n\r\n     * In the impeachment of Judge Pickering, of New Hampshire, a\r\n     habitual and maniac drunkard, no defence was made. Had there\r\n     been, the party vote of more than one third of the Senate\r\n     would have acquitted him.\r\n\r\nAmong the debilities of the government of the Confederation, no one was\r\nmore distinguished or more distressing, than the utter impossibility\r\nof obtaining, from the States, the monies necessary for the payment\r\nof debts, or even for the ordinary expenses of the government. Some\r\ncontributed a little, some less, and some nothing; and the last,\r\nfurnished at length an excuse for the first, to do nothing also. Mr.\r\nAdams, while residing at the Hague, had a general authority to borrow\r\nwhat sums might be requisite, for ordinary and necessary expenses.\r\nInterest on the public debt, and the maintenance of the diplomatic\r\nestablishment in Europe, had been habitually provided in this way. He\r\nwas now elected Vice-President of the United States, was soon to return\r\nto America, and had referred our bankers to me for future counsel, on\r\nour affairs in their hands. But I had no powers, no instructions,\r\nno means, and no familiarity with the subject. It had always been\r\nexclusively under his management, except as to occasional and partial\r\ndeposites in the hands of Mr. Grand, banker in Paris, for special and\r\nlocal purposes. These last had been exhausted for some time, and I\r\nhad fervently pressed the Treasury board to replenish this particular\r\ndeposite, as Mr. Grand now refused to make further advances. They\r\nanswered candidly, that no funds could be obtained until the\r\nnew government should get into action, and have time to make its\r\narrangements. Mr. Adams had received his appointment to the court of\r\nLondon, while engaged at Paris, with Dr. Franklin and myself, in the\r\nnegotiations under our joint commissions. He had repaired thence\r\nto London, without returning to the Hague, to take leave of that\r\ngovernment. He thought it necessary, however, to do so now, before he\r\nshould leave Europe, and accordingly went there. I learned his departure\r\nfrom London, by a letter from Mrs. Adams, received on the very day on\r\nwhich he would arrive at the Hague. A consultation with him, and some\r\nprovision for the future, was indispensable, while we could yet avail\r\nourselves of his powers; for when they would be gone, we should be\r\nwithout resource. I was daily dunned by a Company who had formerly made\r\na small loan to the United States, the principal of which was now become\r\ndue; and our bankers in Amsterdam had notified me, that the interest on\r\nour general debt would be expected in June; that if we failed to pay it,\r\nit would be deemed an act of bankruptcy, and would effectually destroy\r\nthe credit of the Upited States, and all future prospects of obtaining\r\nmoney there; that the loan they had been authorized to open, of which\r\na third only was filled, had now ceased to get forward, and rendered\r\ndesperate that hope of resource. I saw that there was not a moment to\r\nlose, and set out for the Hague on the 2nd morning after receiving the\r\ninformation of Mr. Adams’s journey. I went the direct road by Louvres,\r\nSenlis, Roye, Pont St. Maxence, Bois le Due, Gournay, Peronne, Cambray,\r\nBouchain, Valenciennes, Mons, Bruxelles, Malines, Antwerp, Mordick, and\r\nRotterdam, to the Hague, where I happily found Mr. Adams. He concurred\r\nwith me at once in opinion, that something must be done, and that we\r\nought to risk ourselves on doing it without instructions, to save the\r\ncredit of the United States. We foresaw, that before the new government\r\ncould be adopted, assembled, establish its financial system, get the\r\nmoney into the Treasury, and place it in Europe, considerable time would\r\nelapse; that, therefore, we had better provide at once for the years\r\n‘88, ‘89, and ‘90, in order to place our government at its ease, and our\r\ncredit in security, during that trying interval. We set out, therefore,\r\nby the way of Leyden, for Amsterdam, where we arrived on the 10th, I had\r\nprepared an estimate, showing, that\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Financial Projection, American Embassy Paris, page068]\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorins.\r\n\r\nThere would be necessary for the year ‘88--531,937-10 ‘89--538,540\r\n‘90--473,540 -------------------- Total, 1,544,017-10\r\n\r\nFlorins.\r\n\r\nTo meet this, the bankers had in hand, 79,268-2-8 and the unsold bonds\r\nwould yield, 542,800\r\n\r\n622,068-2-8\r\n\r\nLeaving a deficit of 921,949-7-4\r\n\r\nWe proposed then to borrow a million, yielding 920,000\r\n\r\nWhich would leave a small deficiency of 1,949-7-4\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Adams accordingly executed 1000 bonds, for 1000 florins each, and\r\ndeposited them in the hands of our bankers, with instructions, however,\r\nnot to issue them until Congress should ratify the measure. This done,\r\nhe returned to London, and I set out for Paris; and, as nothing urgent\r\nforbade it, I determined to return along the banks of the Rhine, to\r\nStrasburg, and thence strike off to Paris. I accordingly left Amsterdam\r\non the 30th of March, and proceeded by Utrecht, Nimegnen, Cleves,\r\nDuysberg, Dusseldorf, Cologne, Bonne, Coblentz, Nassau, Hocheim,\r\nFrankfort, and made an excursion to Hanau, then to Mayence, and another\r\nexcursion to Rudesheim, and Johansberg; then by Oppenheim, Worms, and\r\nManheim, making an excursion to Heidelberg, then by Spire, Carlsruhe,\r\nRastadt, and Kelh, to Sfrasburg, where I arrived April the 16th,\r\nand proceeded again on the 18th, by Phalsbourg, Fenestrange, Dieuze,\r\nMoyenvie, Nancy, Toul, Ligny, Barleduc, St. Diziers, Vitry, Chalons sur\r\nMarne, Epernay, Chateau Thierri, Meaux, to Paris, where I arrived on\r\nthe 23d of April: and I had the satisfaction to reflect, that by this\r\njourney, our credit was secured, the new government was placed at ease\r\nfor two years to come, and that, as well as myself, relieved from the\r\ntorment of incessant duns, whose just complaints could not be silenced\r\nby any means within our power.\r\n\r\nA Consular Convention had been agreed on in ‘84, between Dr. Franklin\r\nand the French government, containing several articles, so entirely\r\ninconsistent with the laws of the several states, and the general spirit\r\nof our citizens, that Congress withheld their ratification, and sent\r\nit back to me, with instructions to get those articles expunged, or\r\nmodified, so as to render them compatible with our laws. The Minister\r\nunwillingly released us from these concessions, which, indeed,\r\nauthorized the exercise of powers very offensive in a free state. After\r\nmuch discussion, the Convention was reformed in a considerable degree,\r\nand was signed by the Count Montmorin and myself, on the 14th of\r\nNovember, ‘88; not indeed, such as I would have wished; but such as\r\ncould be obtained with good humor and friendship.\r\n\r\nOn my return from Holland, I found Paris as I had left it, still in\r\nhigh fermentation. Had the Archbishop, on the close of the Assembly of\r\nNotables, immediately carried into operation the measures contemplated,\r\nit was believed they would all have been registered by the Parliament;\r\nbut he was slow, presented his edicts, one after another, and at\r\nconsiderable intervals, which gave time for the feelings excited by the\r\nproceedings of the Notables to cool off, new claims to be advanced, and\r\na pressure to arise for a fixed constitution, not subject to changes\r\nat the will of the King. Nor should we wonder at this pressure, when\r\nwe consider the monstrous abuses of power under which this people were\r\nground to powder; when we pass in review the weight of their taxes, and\r\nthe inequality of their distribution; the oppressions of the tythes,\r\nthe failles, the corvees, the gabelles, the farms and the barriers;\r\nthe shackles on commerce by monopolies; on industry by guilds and\r\ncorporations; on the freedom of conscience, of thought, and of speech;\r\non the freedom of the press by the censure; and of the person by lettres\r\nde cachet; the cruelty of the criminal code generally; the atrocities\r\nof the rack; the venality of Judges, and their partialities to the rich;\r\nthe monopoly of military honors by the noblesse; the enormous expenses\r\nof the Queen, the Princes, and the Court; the prodigalities of pensions;\r\nand the riches, luxury, indolence, and immorality of the Clergy. Surely\r\nunder such a mass of misrule and oppression, a people might justly\r\npress for thorough reformation, and might even dismount their roughshod\r\nriders, and leave them to walk, on their own legs. The edicts, relative\r\nto the corvees and free circulation of grain, were first presented to\r\nthe Parliament and registered; but those for the impot territorial,\r\nand stamp tax, offered some time after, were refused by the Parliament,\r\nwhich proposed a call of the States General, as alone competent to their\r\nauthorization. Their refusal produced a bed of justice, and their exile\r\nto Troyes. The Advocates, however, refusing to attend them, a suspension\r\nin the administration of justice took place. The Parliament held out for\r\nawhile, but the ennui of their exile and absence from Paris, began at\r\nlength to be felt, and some dispositions for compromise to appear. On\r\ntheir consent, therefore, to prolong some of the former taxes, they were\r\nrecalled from exile. The King met them in session, November 19, ‘87,\r\npromised to call the States General in the year ‘92, and a majority\r\nexpressed their assent to register an edict for successive and annual\r\nloans from 1788 to ‘92; but a protest being entered by the Duke of\r\nOrleans, and this encouraging others in a disposition to retract,\r\nthe King ordered peremptorily the registry of the edict, and left the\r\nassembly abruptly. The Parliament immediately protested, that the votes\r\nfor the enregistry had not been legally taken, and that they gave no\r\nsanction to the loans proposed. This was enough to discredit and defeat\r\nthem. Hereupon issued another edict, for the establishment of a _cour\r\nplenière_ and the suspension of all the Parliaments in the kingdom.\r\nThis being opposed, as might be expected, by reclamations from all the\r\nParliaments and Provinces, the King gave way, and by an edict of July\r\n5th, ’88, renounced his _cour plenière_, and promised the States General\r\nfor the first of May, of the ensuing year: and the Archbishop, finding\r\nthe times beyond his faculties, accepted the promise of a Cardinal’s\r\nhat, was removed (September ‘88) from the Ministry, and Mr. Necker was\r\ncalled to the department of finance. The innocent rejoicings of the\r\npeople of Paris on this change, provoked the interference of an officer\r\nof the city guards, whose order for their dispersion not being obeyed,\r\nhe charged them with fixed bayonets, killed two or three, and wounded\r\nmany. This dispersed them for the moment, but they collected the next\r\nday in great numbers, burnt ten or twelve guardhouses, killed two or\r\nthree of the guards, and lost six or eight more of their own number. The\r\ncity was hereupon put under martial law, and after a while the tumult\r\nsubsided. The effect of this change of ministers, and the promise of the\r\nStates General at an early day tranquillized the nation. But two\r\ngreat questions now occurred. 1st. What proportion shall the number of\r\ndeputies of the _Tiers Etat_ bear to those of the Nobles and Clergy?\r\nAnd, 2nd. Shall they sit in the same or in distinct apartments? Mr.\r\nNecker, desirous of avoiding himself these knotty questions, proposed a\r\nsecond call of the same Notables, and that their advice should be asked\r\non the subject. They met, November 9, ‘88, and, by five bureaux against\r\none, they recommended the forms of the States General of 1614; wherein\r\nthe Houses were separate, and voted by orders, not by persons. But the\r\nwhole nation declaring at once against this, and that the _Tiers\r\nEtat_ should be, in numbers, equal to both the other orders, and the\r\nParliament deciding for the same proportion, it was determined so to be,\r\nby a declaration of December 27th, ‘88. A Report of Mr. Necker, to\r\nthe King, of about the same date, contained other very important\r\nconcessions. 1. That the King could neither lay a new tax, nor prolong\r\nan old one. 2. It expressed a readiness to agree on the periodical\r\nmeeting of the States. 3. To consult on the necessary restriction on\r\n_lettres de cachet_; and 4. How far the press might be made free. 5. It\r\nadmits that the States are to appropriate the public money; and 6.\r\nThat Ministers shall be responsible for public expenditures. And these\r\nconcessions came from the very heart of the King. He had not a wish but\r\nfor the good of the nation; and for that object, no personal sacrifice\r\nwould ever have cost him a moment’s regret; but his mind was weakness\r\nitself, his constitution timid, his judgment null, and without\r\nsufficient firmness even to stand by the faith of his word. His Queen,\r\ntoo, haughty and bearing no contradiction, had an absolute ascendancy\r\nover him; and around her were rallied the King’s brother D’Artois,\r\nthe court generally, and the aristocratic part of his Ministers,\r\nparticularly Breteuil, Broglio, Vauguyon, Foulon, Luzerne, men whose\r\nprinciples of government were those of the age of Louis XIV. Against\r\nthis host, the good counsels of Necker, Montmorin, St. Priest, although\r\nin unison with the wishes of the King himself, were of little avail. The\r\nresolutions of the morning, formed under their advice, would be reversed\r\nin the evening, by the influence of the Queen and court. But the hand\r\nof Heaven weighed heavily indeed on the machinations of this junto;\r\nproducing collateral incidents, not arising out of the case, yet\r\npowerfully co-exciting the nation to force a regeneration of its\r\ngovernment, and overwhelming, with accumulated difficulties, this\r\nliberticide resistance. For, while laboring under the want of money\r\nfor even ordinary purposes, in a government which required a million\r\nof livres a day, and driven to the last ditch by the universal call\r\nfor liberty, there came on a winter of such severe cold, as was without\r\nexample in the memory of man, or in the written records of history. The\r\nMercury was at times 50° below the freezing point of Farenheit, and 22°\r\nbelow that of Reaumur. All out-door labor was suspended, and the poor,\r\nwithout the wages of labor, were, of course, without either bread\r\nor fuel. The government found its necessities aggravated by that of\r\nprocuring immense quantities of firewood, and of keeping great fires at\r\nall the cross streets, around which the people gathered in crowds, to\r\navoid perishing with cold. Bread, too, was to be bought, and distributed\r\ndaily, _gratis_, until a relaxation of the season should enable the\r\npeople to work: and the slender stock of bread-stuff had for some time\r\nthreatened famine, and had raised that article to an enormous price. So\r\ngreat, indeed, was the scarcity of bread, that, from the highest to the\r\nlowest citizen, the bakers were permitted to deal but a scanty allowance\r\nper head, even to those who paid for it; and, in cards of invitation\r\nto dine in the richest houses, the guest was notified to bring his own\r\nbread. To eke out the existence of the people, every person who had\r\nthe means, was called on for a weekly subscription, which the Cures\r\ncollected, and employed in providing messes for the nourishment of the\r\npoor, and vied with each other in devising such economical compositions\r\nof food, as would subsist the greatest number with the smallest means.\r\nThis want of bread had been foreseen for some time past, and M. de\r\nMontmorin had desired me to notify it in America, and that, in addition\r\nto the market price, a premium should be given on what should be brought\r\nfrom the United States. Notice was accordingly given, and produced\r\nconsiderable supplies. Subsequent information made the importations from\r\nAmerica, during the months of March, April, and May, into the Atlantic\r\nports of France, amount to about twenty-one thousand barrels of flour,\r\nbesides what went to other ports, and in other months; while our\r\nsupplies to their West Indian islands relieved them also from that\r\ndrain. This distress for bread continued till July.\r\n\r\nHitherto no acts of popular violence had been produced by the struggle\r\nfor political reformation. Little riots, on ordinary incidents, had\r\ntaken place at other times, in different parts of the kingdom, in which\r\nsome lives, perhaps a dozen or twenty, had been lost; but in the month\r\nof April, a more serious one occurred in Paris, unconnected, indeed,\r\nwith the Revolutionary principle, but making part of the history of\r\nthe day. The Fauxbourg St. Antoine, is a quarter of the city inhabited\r\nentirely by the class of day-laborers and journeymen in every line. A\r\nrumor was spread among them, that a great paper-manufacturer, of the\r\nname of Reveillon, had proposed, on some occasion, that their wages\r\nshould be lowered to fifteen sous a day. Inflamed at once into rage,\r\nand without inquiring into its truth, they flew to his house in\r\nvast numbers, destroyed every thing in it, and in his magazines and\r\nwork-shops, without secreting, however, a pin’s worth to themselves, and\r\nwere continuing this work of devastation, when the regular troops were\r\ncalled in. Admonitions being disregarded, they were of necessity fired\r\non, and a regular action ensued, in which about one hundred of them were\r\nkilled, before the rest would disperse. There had rarely passed a year\r\nwithout such a riot, in some part or other of the kingdom; and this\r\nis distinguished only as cotemporary with the Revolution, although not\r\nproduced by it.\r\n\r\nThe States General were opened on the 5th of May, ‘89, by speeches from\r\nthe King, the Garde des Sceaux, Lamoignon, and Mr. Necker. The last was\r\nthought to trip too lightly over the constitutional reformations which\r\nwere expected. His notices of them in this speech, were not as full\r\nas in his previous _Rapport au Roi_. This was observed, to his\r\ndisadvantage: but much allowance should have been made for the situation\r\nin which he was placed, between his own counsels and those of the\r\nministers and party of the court. Overruled in his own opinions,\r\ncompelled to deliver, and to gloss over those of his opponents, and even\r\nto keep their secrets, he could not come forward in his own attitude.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the Assembly, although equivalent, on the whole, to\r\nwhat had been expected, was something different in its elements. It had\r\nbeen supposed, that a superior education would carry into the scale\r\nof the Commons, a respectable portion of the Noblesse. It did so as to\r\nthose of Paris, of its vicinity, and of the other considerable cities,\r\nwhose greater intercourse with enlightened society had liberalized their\r\nminds, and prepared them to advance up to the measure of the times. But\r\nthe Noblesse of the country, which constituted two thirds of that body,\r\nwere far in their rear. Residing constantly on their patrimonial feuds,\r\nand familiarized, by daily habit, with Seigneurial powers and practices,\r\nthey had not yet learned to suspect their inconsistence with reason and\r\nright. They were willing to submit to equality of taxation, but not to\r\ndescend from their rank and prerogatives to be incorporated in session\r\nwith the _Tiers Etat_. Among the Clergy, on the other hand, it had been\r\napprehended that the higher orders of the Hierarchy, by their wealth and\r\nconnections, would have carried the elections generally; but it turned\r\nout, that in most cases, the lower clergy had obtained the popular\r\nmajorities. These consisted of the Cureés sons of the peasantry, who\r\nhad been employed to do all the drudgery of parochial services for ten,\r\ntwenty, or thirty louis a year; while their superiors were consuming\r\ntheir princely revenues in palaces of luxury and indolence. The\r\nobjects for which this body was convened, being of the first order of\r\nimportance, I felt it very interesting to understand the views of the\r\nparties of which it was composed, and especially the ideas prevalent,\r\nas to the organization contemplated for their government. I went,\r\ntherefore, daily from Paris to Versailles, and attended their debates,\r\ngenerally till the hour of adjournment. Those of the Noblesse were\r\nimpassioned and tempestuous. They had some able men on both sides,\r\nactuated by equal zeal. The debates of the Commons were temperate,\r\nrational, and inflexibly firm. As preliminary to all other business,\r\nthe awful questions came on: Shall the States sit in one, or in distinct\r\napartments? And shall they vote by heads or houses? The opposition was\r\nsoon found to consist of the Episcopal order among the clergy, and two\r\nthirds of the _Noblesse_; while the _Tiers Etat_ were, to a man, united\r\nand determined. After various propositions of compromise had failed,\r\nthe Commons undertook to cut the Gordian knot. The Abbe Sieyes, the most\r\nlogical head of the nation, (author of the pamphlet ‘_Qu’est ce que le\r\nTiers Etat?_’ which had electrified that country, as Paine’s ‘Common\r\nSense’ did us,) after an impressive speech on the 10th of June, moved\r\nthat a last invitation should be sent to the Nobles and Clergy, to\r\nattend in the hall of the States, collectively or individually, for the\r\nverification of powers, to which the Commons would proceed immediately,\r\neither in their presence or absence. This verification being finished,\r\na motion was made, on the 15th, that they should constitute themselves a\r\nNational Assembly; which was decided on the 17th, by a majority of four\r\nfifths. During the debates on this question, about twenty of the Curés\r\nhad joined them, and a proposition was made, in the chamber of the\r\nClergy, that their whole body should join. This was rejected, at first,\r\nby a small majority only; but, being afterwards somewhat modified, it\r\nwas decided affirmatively, by a majority of eleven. While this was under\r\ndebate, and unknown to the court, to wit, on the 19th, a council was\r\nheld in the afternoon, at Marly, wherein it was proposed that the King\r\nshould interpose, by a declaration of his sentiments, in a _séance\r\nroyale_. A form of declaration was proposed by Necker, which, while it\r\ncensured, in general, the preceedings, both of the Nobles and Commons,\r\nannounced the King’s views, such as substantially to coincide with the\r\nCommons. It was agreed to in Council, the _séance_ was fixed for the\r\n22nd, the meetings of the States were till then to be suspended, and\r\nevery thing, in the mean time, kept secret. The members, the next\r\nmorning (the 20th) repairing to their house, as usual, found the doors\r\nshut and guarded, a proclamation posted up for a séance, royale on the\r\n22nd, and a suspension of their meetings in the mean, time. Concluding\r\nthat their dissolution was now to take place, they repaired to a\r\nbuilding called the _Jeu de paume_ (or Tennis court), and there bound\r\nthemselves by oath to each other, never to separate, of their own\r\naccord, till they had settled a constitution for the nation, on a solid\r\nbasis, and, if separated by force, that they would reassemble in some\r\nother place. The next day they met in the church of St. Louis, and were\r\njoined by a majority of the clergy. The heads of the aristocracy saw\r\nthat all was lost without some bold exertion. The King was still at\r\nMarly. Nobody was permitted to approach him but their friends. He was\r\nassailed by falsehoods in all shapes. He was made to believe that the\r\nCommons were about to absolve the army from their oath of fidelity\r\nto him, and to raise their pay. The court party were now all rage and\r\ndesperation. They procured a committee to be held, consisting of the\r\nKing and his Ministers, to which Monsieur and the Count d’Artois\r\nshould be admitted. At this committee, the latter attacked Mr. Necker\r\npersonally, arraigned his declaration, and proposed one which some of\r\nhis prompters had put into his hands. Mr. Necker was browbeaten and\r\nintimidated, and the King shaken. He determined that the two plans\r\nshould be deliberated on the next day, and the _séance royale_ put off a\r\nday longer. This encouraged a fiercer attack on Mr. Necker the next day.\r\nHis draught of a declaration was entirely broken up, and that of the\r\nCount d’Artois inserted into it. Himself and Montmorin offered their\r\nresignation, which was refused; the Count d’Artois saying to Mr. Necker,\r\n‘No, sir, you must be kept as the hostage; we hold you responsible for\r\nall the ill which shall happen.’ This change of plan was immediately\r\nwhispered without doors. The _Noblesse_ were in triumph; the people in\r\nconsternation. I was quite alarmed at this state of things. The soldiery\r\nhad not yet indicated which side they should take, and that which they\r\nshould support would be sure to prevail. I considered a successful\r\nreformation of government in France as insuring a general reformation\r\nthrough Europe, and the resurrection to a new life of their people,\r\nnow ground to dust by the abuses of the governing powers. I was much\r\nacquainted with the leading patriots of the Assembly. Being from a\r\ncountry which had successfully passed through a similar reformation,\r\nthey were disposed to my acquaintance, and had some confidence in me.\r\nI urged, most strenuously, an immediate compromise; to secure what the\r\ngovernment was now ready to yield, and trust to future occasions for\r\nwhat might still be wanting. It was well understood that the King would\r\ngrant, at this time, 1. Freedom of the person by _habeas corpus_. 2.\r\nFreedom of conscience: 3. Freedom of the press: 4. Trial by jury: 5. A\r\nrepresentative legislature: 6. Annual meetings: 7. The origination of\r\nlaws: 8. The exclusive right of taxation and appropriation: and 9. The\r\nresponsibility of ministers: and with the exercise of these powers they\r\ncould obtain, in future, whatever might be further necessary to improve\r\nand preserve their constitution. They thought otherwise, however, and\r\nevents have proved their lamentable error. For, after thirty years\r\nof war, foreign and domestic, the loss of millions of lives, the\r\nprostration of private happiness, and the foreign subjugation of their\r\nown country for a time, they have obtained no more, nor even that\r\nsecurely. They were unconscious of (for who could foresee?) the\r\nmelancholy sequel of their well-meant perseverance; that their physical\r\nforce would be usurped by a first tyrant to trample on the independence,\r\nand even the existence, of other nations: that this would afford a fatal\r\nexample for the atrocious conspiracy of kings against their people;\r\nwould generate their unholy and homicide alliance to make common cause\r\namong themselves, and to crush, by the power of the whole, the efforts\r\nof any part, to moderate their abuses and oppressions. When the King\r\npassed, the next day, through the lane formed from the Chateau to the\r\n_Hotel des Etats_, there was a dead silence. He was about an hour in\r\nthe House, delivering his speech and declaration. On his coming out, a\r\nfeeble cry of _Vive le Roy_ was raised by some children, but the people\r\nremained silent and sullen. In the close of his speech, he had ordered\r\nthat the members should follow him, and resume their deliberations the\r\nnext day. The _Noblesse_ followed him, and so did the clergy, except\r\nabout thirty, who, with the _Tiers_, remained in the room, and entered\r\ninto deliberation. They protested against what the King had done,\r\nadhered to all their former proceedings, and resolved the inviolability\r\nof their own persons. An officer came to order them out of the room\r\nin the King’s name. ‘Tell those who sent you,’ said Mirabeau, ‘that we\r\nshall not move hence but at our own will, or the point of the bayonet.’\r\nIn the afternoon, the people, uneasy, began to assemble in great numbers\r\nin the courts and vicinities of the palace. This produced alarm. The\r\nQueen sent for Mr. Necker. He was conducted, amidst the shouts and\r\nacclamations of the multitude, who filled all the apartments of the\r\npalace. He was a few minutes only with the Queen, and what passed\r\nbetween them did not transpire. The King went out to ride. He passed\r\nthrough the crowd to his carriage, and into it, without being in the\r\nleast noticed. As Mr. Necker followed him, universal acclamations\r\nwere raised of ‘_Vive Monsieur Necker, vive le sauveur de la France\r\nopprimée_.’ He was conducted back to his house, with the same\r\ndemonstrations of affection and anxiety. About two hundred deputies of\r\nthe _Tiers_, catching the enthusiasm of the moment, went to his house,\r\nand extorted from him a promise that he would not resign. On the 25th,\r\nforty-eight of the Nobles joined the _Tiers_, and among them the Duke of\r\nOrleans. There were then with them one hundred and sixty-four members\r\nof the clergy, although the minority of that body still sat apart, and\r\ncalled themselves the Chamber of the Clergy. On the 26th, the Archbishop\r\nof Paris joined the Tiers, as did some others of the clergy and of the\r\n_Noblesse_.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings had thrown the people into violent ferment. It gained\r\nthe soldiery, first of the French guards, extended to those of every\r\nother denomination, except the Swiss, and even to the body guards of\r\nthe King. They began to quit their barracks, to assemble in squads, to\r\ndeclare they would defend the life of the King, but would not be the\r\nmurderers of their fellow-citizens. They called themselves the soldiers\r\nof the nation, and left now no doubt on which side they would be, in\r\ncase of a rupture. Similar accounts came in from the troops in other\r\nparts of the kingdom, giving good reason to believe they would side\r\nwith their fathers and brothers, rather than with their officers.\r\nThe operation of this medicine at Versailles, was as sudden as it was\r\npowerful. The alarm there was so complete, that in the afternoon of the\r\n27th, the King wrote with his own hand letters to the Presidents of the\r\nClergy and Nobles, engaging them immediately to join the _Tiers_. These\r\ntwo bodies were debating, and hesitating, when notes from the Count\r\nd’Artois decided their compliance. They went in a body, and took their\r\nseats with the Tiers, and thus rendered the union of the orders in one\r\nchamber complete.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly now entered on the business of their mission, and first\r\nproceeded to arrange the order in which they would take up the heads of\r\ntheir constitution, as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, and as preliminary to the whole, a general declaration of the\r\nrights of man. Then, specifically, the principles of the monarchy;\r\nrights of the nation; rights of the king; rights of the citizens;\r\norganization and rights of the National Assembly; forms necessary for\r\nthe enactment of laws; organization and functions of the Provincial\r\nand Municipal Assemblies; duties and limits of the Judiciary power;\r\nfunctions and duties of the Military power.\r\n\r\nA declaration of the rights of man, as the preliminary of their work,\r\nwas accordingly prepared and proposed by the Marquis de la Fayette.\r\n\r\nBut the quiet of their march was soon disturbed by information that\r\ntroops, and particularly the foreign troops, were advancing on Paris\r\nfrom various quarters. The King had probably been advised to this on the\r\npretext of preserving peace in Paris. But his advisers were believed to\r\nhave other things in contemplation. The Marshal de Broglio was appointed\r\nto their command, a highflying aristocrat, cool and capable of every\r\nthing. Some of the French guards were soon arrested, under other\r\npretexts, but really on account of their dispositions in favor of the\r\nnational cause. The people of Paris forced their prison, liberated them,\r\nand sent a deputation to the Assembly to solicit a pardon. The Assembly\r\nrecommended peace and order to the people of Paris, the prisoners to\r\nthe King, and asked from him the removal of the troops. His answer was\r\nnegative and dry, saying they might remove themselves, if they pleased,\r\nto Noyon or Soissons. In the mean time, these troops, to the number of\r\ntwenty or thirty thousand, had arrived, and were posted in and between\r\nParis and Versailles. The bridges and passes were guarded. At three\r\no’clock in the afternoon of the 11th of July, the Count de la Luzerne\r\nwas sent to notify Mr. Necker of his dismission, and to enjoin him to\r\nretire instantly, without saying a word of it to any body. He went home,\r\ndined, and proposed to his wife a visit to a friend, but went in fact\r\nto his country-house at St. Ouen, and at midnight set out for Brussels.\r\nThis was not known till the next day (the 12th), when the whole\r\nministry was changed, except Villedeuil, of the domestic department, and\r\nBarenton, _Garde des Sceaux_. The changes were as follows.\r\n\r\nThe Baron de Breteuil, President of the Council of Finance; de la\r\nGalasiere, Comptroller General, in the room of Mr. Necker; the Marshal\r\nde Broglio, Minister of War, and Foulon under him, in the room of\r\nPuy-Segur; the Duke de la Vauguyon, Minister of Foreign Affairs, instead\r\nof the Count de Montmorin; de la Porte, Minister of Marine, in place of\r\nthe Count de la Luzerne; St. Priest was also removed from the Council.\r\nLucerne and Puy Segur had been strongly of the aristocratic party in\r\nthe Council but they were not considered as equal to the work now to\r\nbe done. The King was now completely in the hands of men, the principal\r\namong whom had been noted through their lives for the Turkish despotism\r\nof their characters, and who were associated around the King as proper\r\ninstruments for what was to be executed. The news of this change began\r\nto be known at Paris about one or two o’clock. In the afternoon, a body\r\nof about one hundred German cavalry were advanced, and drawn up in the\r\nPlace Louis XV., and about two hundred Swiss posted at a little distance\r\nin their rear. This drew people to the spot, who thus accidentally found\r\nthemselves in front of the troops, merely at first as spectators; but,\r\nas their numbers increased, their indignation rose. They retired a few\r\nsteps, and posted themselves on and behind large piles of stones, large\r\nand small, collected in that place for a bridge, which was to be built\r\nadjacent to it. In this position, happening to be in my carriage on a\r\nvisit, I passed through the lane they had formed, without interruption.\r\nBut the moment after I had passed, the people attacked the cavalry with\r\nstones. They charged, but the advantageous position of the people, and\r\nthe showers of stones, obliged the horse to retire, and quit the field\r\naltogether, leaving one of their number on the ground, and the Swiss in\r\ntheir rear, not moving to their aid. This was the signal for universal\r\ninsurrection, and this body of cavalry, to avoid being massacred,\r\nretired towards Versailles. The people now armed themselves with such\r\nweapons as they could find in armorers’ shops, and private houses, and\r\nwith bludgeons; and were roaming all night, through all parts of the\r\ncity, without any decided object. The next day (the 13th), the Assembly\r\npressed on the king to send away the troops, to permit the Bourgeoisie\r\nof Paris, to arm for the preservation of order in the city, and offered\r\nto send a deputation from their body to tranquillize them: but their\r\npropositions were refused. A committee of magistrates and electors\r\nof the city were appointed by those bodies, to take upon them its\r\ngovernment. The people, now openly joined by the French guards, forced\r\nthe prison of St. Lazare, released all the prisoners, and took a great\r\nstore of corn, which they carried to the corn market. Here they got\r\nsome arms, and the French guards began to form and train; them. The\r\ncity-committee determined to raise forty-eight thousand _Bourgeois_, or\r\nrather to restrain their numbers to forty-eight thousand. On the 14th,\r\nthey sent one of their members (Monsieur de Corny) to the _Hotel des\r\nInvalides_, to ask arms for their _Garde Bourgeoise_. He was followed\r\nby, and he found there, a great collection of people. The Governor\r\nof the Invalids came out, and represented the impossibility of his\r\ndelivering arms, without the orders of those from whom he received them.\r\nDe Corny advised the people then to retire, and retired himself; but the\r\npeople took possession of the arms, it was remarkable, that not only the\r\nInvalids themselves made no opposition, but that a body of five thousand\r\nforeign troops, within four hundred yards, never stirred. M. de Corny,\r\nand five others, were then sent to ask arms of M. de Launay, Governor of\r\nthe Bastile. They found a great collection of people already before the\r\nplace, and they immediately planted a flag of truce, which was answered\r\nby a like flag hoisted on the parapet. The deputation prevailed on the\r\npeople to fall back a little, advanced themselves to make their demand\r\nof the Governor, and in that instant, a discharge from the Bastile\r\nkilled four persons, of those nearest to the deputies. The deputies\r\nretired. I happened to be at the house of M. de Corny, when he returned\r\nto it, and received from him a narrative of these transactions. On the\r\nretirement of the deputies, the people rushed forward, and almost in an\r\ninstant, were in possession of a fortification, of infinite strength,\r\ndefended by one hundred men, which in other times, had stood several\r\nregular sieges, and had never been taken. How they forced their entrance\r\nhas never been explained. They took all the arms, discharged the\r\nprisoners, and such of the garrison as were not killed in the first\r\nmoment of fury; carried the Governor and Lieutenant Governor to the\r\nPlace de Greve (the place of public execution), cut off their heads, and\r\nsent them through the city, in triumph, to the Palais Royal. About the\r\nsame instant, a treacherous correspondence having been discovered in M.\r\nde Flesselles, _Prévôt des Marchands_, they seized him in the _Hotel\r\nde Ville_, where he was in the execution of his office, and cut off his\r\nhead. These events, carried imperfectly to Versailles, were the subject\r\nof two successive deputations from the Assembly to the King, to both of\r\nwhich he gave dry and hard answers; for nobody had as yet been permitted\r\nto inform him, truly and fully, of what had passed at Paris. But at\r\nnight, the Duke de Liancourt forced his way into the King’s bed-chamber,\r\nand obliged him to hear a full and animated detail of the disasters of\r\nthe day in Paris. He went to bed fearfully impressed. The decapitation\r\nof De Launay worked powerfully, through the night, on the whole\r\nAristocratical party; insomuch, that in the morning, those of the\r\ngreatest influence on the Count d’Artois, represented to him the\r\nabsolute necessity, that the King should give up every thing to the\r\nAssembly. This according with the dispositions of the King, he went\r\nabout eleven o’clock, accompanied only by his brothers, to the Assembly,\r\nand there read to them a speech, in which he asked their interposition\r\nto re-establish order. Although couched in terms of some caution, yet\r\nthe manner in which it was delivered made it evident, that it was\r\nmeant as a surrender at discretion. He returned to the Chateau afoot,\r\naccompanied by the Assembly. They sent off a deputation to quiet Paris,\r\nat the head of which was the Marquis de la Fayette, who had, the same\r\nmorning, been named _Commandant en Chef_ of the _Milice Bourgeoise_; and\r\nMonsieur Bailly, former President of the States General, was called for\r\nas _Prévôt des Marchands_. The demolition of the Bastile was now ordered\r\nand begun. A body of the Swiss guards, of the regiment of Ventimille,\r\nand the city horse-guards joined the people. The alarm at Versailles\r\nincreased. The foreign troops were ordered off instantly. Every Minister\r\nresigned. The King confirmed Bailly as Prévôt des Marchands, wrote to\r\nMr. Necker, to recall him, sent his letter open to the Assembly, to be\r\nforwarded by them, and invited them to go with him to Paris the next\r\nday, to satisfy the city of his dispositions; and that night, and\r\nthe next morning, the Count d’Artois, and M. de Montesson, a deputy\r\nconnected with him, Madame de Polignac, Madame de Guiche, and the Count\r\nde Vaudreuil, favorites of the Queen, the Abbe de Vermont her confessor,\r\nthe Prince of Conde. and Duke of Bourbon fled. The King came to Paris,\r\nleaving the Queen in consternation for his return. Omitting the less\r\nimportant figures of the procession, the King’s carriage was in the\r\ncentre; on each side of it, the Assembly, in two ranks afoot; at their\r\nhead the Marquis de la Fayette, as commander-in-chief, on horse-back,\r\nand _Bourgeois_ guards before and behind. About sixty thousand citizens,\r\nof all forms and conditions, armed with the conquests of the Bastile and\r\nInvalids, as far as they would go, the rest with pistols, swords, pikes,\r\npruning hooks, scythes, &c. lined all the streets through which the\r\nprocession passed, and with the crowds of people in the streets,\r\ndoors, and windows, saluted them everywhere with the cries of ‘_Vive la\r\nNation_,’ but not a single ‘_Vive le Roi_’ was heard. The King stopped\r\nat the _Hotel de Ville_. There M. Bailly presented, and put into his\r\nhat, the popular cockade, and addressed him. The King being unprepared,\r\nand unable to answer, Bailly went to him, gathered from him some\r\nscraps of sentences, and made out an answer, which he delivered to the\r\naudience, as from the King. On their return, the popular cries were\r\n‘_Vive le Roi et la Nation_.’ He was conducted by a _garde Bourgeoise_,\r\nto his palace at Versailles, and thus concluded such an ‘_amende\r\nhonorable_,’ as no sovereign ever made, and no people ever received.\r\n\r\nAnd here, again, was lost another precious occasion of sparing to France\r\nthe crimes and cruelties through which she has since passed, and to\r\nEurope, and finally America, the evils which flowed on them also from\r\nthis mortal source. The King was now become a passive machine in the\r\nhands of the National Assembly, and had he been left to himself, he\r\nwould have willingly acquiesced in whatever they should devise as best\r\nfor the nation. A wise constitution would have been formed, hereditary\r\nin his line, himself placed at its head, with powers so large, as to\r\nenable him to do all the good of his station, and so limited, as to\r\nrestrain him from its abuse. This he would have faithfully administered,\r\nand more than this, I do not believe, he ever wished. But he had a Queen\r\nof absolute sway over his weak mind and timid virtue, and of a character\r\nthe reverse of his in all points. This angel, as gaudily painted in the\r\nrhapsodies of Burke, with some smartness of fancy, but no sound sense,\r\nwas proud, disdainful of restraint, indignant at all obstacles to her\r\nwill, eager in the pursuit of pleasure, and firm enough to hold to\r\nher desires, or perish in their wreck. Her inordinate gambling and\r\ndissipations, with those of the Count d’Artois, and others of her\r\nclique, had been a sensible item in the exhaustion of the treasury,\r\nwhich called into action the reforming hand of the nation; and her\r\nopposition to it, her inflexible perverseness, and dauntless spirit, led\r\nherself to the Guillotine, drew the King on with her, and plunged the\r\nworld into crimes and calamities which will for ever stain the pages\r\nof modern history. I have ever believed, that had there been no Queen,\r\nthere would have been no revolution. No force would have been provoked,\r\nnor exercised. The King would have gone hand in hand with the wisdom of\r\nhis sounder counsellors, who, guided by the increased lights of the\r\nage, wished only, with the same pace, to advance the principles of their\r\nsocial constitution. The deed which closed the mortal course of these\r\nsovereigns, I shall neither approve nor condemn. I am not prepared to\r\nsay, that the first magistrate of a nation cannot commit treason against\r\nhis country, or is unamenable to its punishment: nor yet, that where\r\nthere is no written law, no regulated tribunal, there is not a law in\r\nour hearts, and a power in our hands, given for righteous employment in\r\nmaintaining right, and redressing wrong. Of those who judged the King,\r\nmany thought him wilfully criminal; many, that his existence would keep\r\nthe nation in perpetual conflict with the horde of Kings, who would war\r\nagainst a regeneration which might come home to themselves, and that it\r\nwere better that one should die than all. I should not have voted with\r\nthis portion of the legislature. I should have shut up the Queen in\r\na convent, putting harm out of her power, and placed the King in his\r\nstation, investing him with limited powers, which, I verily believe,\r\nhe would have honestly exercised, according to the measure of his\r\nunderstanding. In this way, no void would have been created, courting\r\nthe usurpation of a military adventurer, nor occasion given for those\r\nenormities which demoralized the nations of the world, and destroyed,\r\nand is yet to destroy, millions and millions of its inhabitants. There\r\nare three epochs in history, signalized by the total extinction of\r\nnational morality. The first was of the successors of Alexander, not\r\nomitting himself: the next, the successors of the first Cæsar: the\r\nthird, our own age. This was begun by the partition of Poland, followed\r\nby that of the treaty of Pilnitz; next the conflagration of Copenhagen;\r\nthen the enormities of Bonaparte, partitioning the earth at his will,\r\nand devastating it with fire and sword; now the conspiracy of Kings,\r\nthe successors of Bonaparte, blasphemously calling themselves ‘The Holy\r\nAlliance,’ and treading in the footsteps of their incarcerated leader;\r\nnot yet, indeed, usurping the government of other nations, avowedly and\r\nin detail, but controlling by their armies the forms in which they will\r\npermit them to be governed; and reserving, _in petto_, the order and\r\nextent of the usurpations further meditated. But I will return from a\r\ndigression, anticipated, too, in time, into which I have been led\r\nby reflection on the criminal passions which refused to the world\r\na favorable occasion of saving it from the afflictions it has since\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nMr. Necker had reached Basle before he was overtaken by the letter of\r\nthe King, inviting him back to resume the office he had recently left.\r\nHe returned immediately, and all the other ministers having resigned,\r\na new administration was named, to wit: St. Priest and Montmorin were\r\nrestored; the Archbishop of Bordeaux was appointed _Garde des Sceaux_;\r\nLa Tour du Pin, Minister of War; La Luzerne, Minister of Marine. This\r\nlast was believed to have been effected by the friendship of Montmorin;\r\nfor although differing in politics, they continued firm in friendship,\r\nand Luzerne, although not an able man, was thought an honest one. And\r\nthe Prince of Bauvau was taken into the Council.\r\n\r\nSeven Princes of the blood royal, six ex-ministers, and many of the\r\nhigh _Noblesse_, having fled, and the present ministers, except Luzerne,\r\nbeing all of the popular party, all the functionaries of government\r\nmoved, for the present, in perfect harmony.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of August the 4th, and on the motion of the Viscount\r\nde Noailles, brother-in-law of La Fayette, the Assembly abolished all\r\ntitles of rank, all the abusive privileges of feudalism, the tythes\r\nand casuals of the clergy, all provincial privileges, and, in fine, the\r\nfeudal regimen generally. To the suppression of tythes, the Abbe Sieyes\r\nwas vehemently opposed; but his learned and logical arguments were\r\nunheeded, and his estimation lessened by a contrast of his egoism (for\r\nhe was beneficed on them) with the generous abandonment of rights by the\r\nother members of the Assembly. Many days were employed in putting into\r\nthe form of laws the numerous demolitions of ancient abuses; which done,\r\nthey proceeded to the preliminary work of a declaration of rights. There\r\nbeing much concord of sentiment on the elements of this instrument, it\r\nwas liberally framed, and passed with a very general approbation.\r\nThey then appointed a committee for the ‘reduction of a _projet_’ of\r\na constitution, at the head of which was the Archbishop of Bordeaux. I\r\nreceived from him, as chairman of the committee, a letter of July the\r\n20th, requesting me to attend and assist at their deliberations; but I\r\nexcused myself, on the obvious considerations, that my mission was to\r\nthe King as Chief Magistrate of the nation, that my duties were limited\r\nto the concerns of my own country, and forbade me to intermeddle with\r\nthe internal transactions of that in which I had been received under a\r\nspecific character only. Their plan of a constitution was discussed\r\nin sections, and so reported from time to time, as agreed to by the\r\ncommittee. The first respected the general frame of the government;\r\nand that this should be formed into three departments, executive,\r\nlegislative, and judiciary, was generally agreed. But when they\r\nproceeded to subordinate developments, many and various shades of\r\nopinion came into conflict, and schism, strongly marked, broke the\r\nPatriots into fragments of very discordant principles. The first\r\nquestion, Whether there should be a King? met with no open opposition;\r\nand it was readily agreed, that the government of France should be\r\nmonarchical and hereditary. Shall the King have a negative on the laws?\r\nShall that negative be absolute, or suspensive only? Shall there be\r\ntwo Chambers of Legislation, or one only? If two, shall one of them be\r\nhereditary? or for life? or for a fixed term? and named by the King?\r\nor elected by the people? These questions found strong differences of\r\nopinion, and produced repulsive combinations among the Patriots. The\r\naristocracy was cemented by a common principle of preserving the ancient\r\nregime or whatever should be nearest to it. Making this their polar\r\nstar, they moved in phalanx, gave preponderance on every question to the\r\nminorities of the Patriots, and always to those who advocated the\r\nleast change. The features of the new constitution were thus assuming a\r\nfearful aspect, and great alarm was produced among the honest Patriots\r\nby these dissensions in their ranks. In this uneasy state of things, I\r\nreceived one day a note from the Marquis de la Fayette, informing me,\r\nthat he should bring a party of six or eight friends, to ask a dinner of\r\nme the next day. I assured him of their welcome. When they arrived, they\r\nwere La Fayette himself, Duport, Barnave, Alexander la Meth, Blacon,\r\nMounier, Maubourg, and Dagout. These were leading Patriots, of honest\r\nbut differing opinions, sensible of the necessity of effecting a\r\ncoalition by mutual sacrifices, knowing each other, and not afraid,\r\ntherefore, to unbosom themselves mutually. This last was a material\r\nprinciple in the selection. With this view, the Marquis had invited the\r\nconference, and had fixed the time and place inadvertently, as to the\r\nembarrassment under which it might place me. The cloth being removed,\r\nand wine set on the table, after the American manner, the Marquis\r\nintroduced the objects of the conference, by summarily reminding them of\r\nthe state of things in the Assembly, the course which the principles of\r\nthe constitution were taking, and the inevitable result, unless checked\r\nby more concord among the Patriots themselves. He observed, that\r\nalthough he also had his opinion, he was ready to sacrifice it to that\r\nof his brethren of the same cause; but that a common opinion must now be\r\nformed, or the aristocracy would carry every thing, and that, whatever\r\nthey should now agree on, he, at the head of the national force, would\r\nmaintain. The discussions began at the hour of four, and were continued\r\ntill ten o’clock in the evening; during which time I was a silent\r\nwitness to a coolness and candor of argument unusual in the conflicts\r\nof political opinion; to a logical reasoning, and chaste eloquence,\r\ndisfigured by no gaudy tinsel of rhetoric or declamation, and truly\r\nworthy of being placed in parallel with the finest dialogues of\r\nantiquity, as handed to us by Xenophon, by Plato, and Cicero. The result\r\nwas, that the King should have a suspensive veto on the laws, that the\r\nlegislature should be composed of a single body only, and that to\r\nbe chosen by the people. This Concordat decided the fate of the\r\nconstitution. The Patriots all rallied to the principles thus settled,\r\ncarried every question agreeably to them, and reduced the aristocracy\r\nto insignificance and impotence. But duties of exculpation were now\r\nincumbent on me. I waited on Count Montmorin the next morning, and\r\nexplained to him, with truth and candor, how it happened that my house\r\nhad been made the scene of conferences of such a character. He told me\r\nhe already knew every thing which had passed, that so far from taking\r\numbrage at the use made of my house on that occasion, he earnestly\r\nwished I would habitually assist at such conferences, being sure I\r\nshould be useful in moderating the warmer spirits, and promoting a\r\nwholesome and practicable reformation only. I told him I knew too well\r\nthe duties I owed to the King, to the nation, and to my own country, to\r\ntake any part in councils concerning their internal government, and that\r\nI should persevere, with care, in the character of a neutral and passive\r\nspectator, with wishes only, and very sincere ones, that those measures\r\nmight prevail which would be for the greatest good of the nation. I have\r\nno doubt, indeed, that this conference was previously known and approved\r\nby this honest minister, who was in confidence and communication with\r\nthe Patriots, and wished for a reasonable reform of the constitution.\r\n\r\nHere I discontinue my relation of the French Revolution. The minuteness\r\nwith which I have so far given its details, is disproportioned to the\r\ngeneral scale of my narrative. But I have thought it justified by the\r\ninterest which the whole world must take in this Revolution. As yet, we\r\nare but in the first chapter of its history. The appeal to the rights of\r\nman, which had been made in the United States, was taken up by France,\r\nfirst of the European nations. From her the spirit has spread over those\r\nof the South. The tyrants of the North have allied indeed against it;\r\nbut it is irresistible. Their opposition will only multiply its millions\r\nof human victims; their own satellites will catch it, and the condition\r\nof man through the civilized world, will be finally and greatly\r\nmeliorated. This is a wonderful instance of great events from small\r\ncauses. So inscrutable is the arrangement of causes and consequences\r\nin this world, that a two-penny duty on tea, unjustly imposed in a\r\nsequestered part of it, changes the condition of all its inhabitants.\r\nI have been more minute in relating the early transactions of this\r\nregeneration, because I was in circumstances peculiarly favorable for\r\na knowledge of the truth. Possessing the confidence and intimacy of the\r\nleading Patriots, and more than all, of the Marquis Fayette, their head\r\nand Atlas, who had no secrets from me, I learned with correctness the\r\nviews and proceedings of that party; while my intercourse with the\r\ndiplomatic missionaries of Europe at Paris, all of them with the\r\ncourt, and eager in prying into its councils and proceedings, gave me\r\na knowledge of these also. My information was always, and immediately\r\ncommitted to writing, in letters to Mr. Jay, and often to my friends,\r\nand a recurrence to these letters now insures me against errors of\r\nmemory. These opportunities of information ceased at this period, with\r\nmy retirement from this interesting scene of action. I had been more\r\nthan a year soliciting leave to go home, with a view to place my\r\ndaughters in the society and care of their friends, and to return for a\r\nshort time to my station at Paris. But the metamorphosis through which\r\nour government was then passing from its chrysalid to its organic form,\r\nsuspended its action in a great degree; and it was not till the last\r\nof August that I received the permission I had asked. And here I cannot\r\nleave this great and good country, without expressing my sense of\r\nits pre-eminence of character among the nations of the earth. A more\r\nbenevolent people I have never known, nor greater warmth and devotedness\r\nin their select friendships. Their kindness and accommodation to\r\nstrangers is unparalleled, and the hospitality of Paris is beyond any\r\nthing I had conceived to be practicable in a large city. Their eminence,\r\ntoo, in science, the communicative dispositions of their scientific men,\r\nthe politeness of the general manners, the ease and vivacity of their\r\nconversation, give a charm to their society, to be found nowhere else.\r\nIn a comparison of this with other countries, we have the proof of\r\nprimacy, which was given to Themistocles after the battle of Salamis.\r\nEvery general voted to himself the first reward of valor, and the second\r\nto Themistocles. So, ask the traveled inhabitant of any nation, In what\r\ncountry on earth would you rather live?--Certainly, in my own, where are\r\nall my friends, my relations, and the earliest and sweetest affections\r\nand recollections of my life. Which would be your second choice? France.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of September, I left Paris for Havre, where I was detained\r\nby contrary winds, until the 8th of October. On that day, and the 9th,\r\nI crossed over to Cowes, where I had engaged the Clermont, Capt. Colley,\r\nto touch for me. She did so; but here again we were detained by contrary\r\nwinds, until the 22nd, when we embarked, and landed at Norfolk on the\r\n23rd of November. On my way home, I passed some days at Eppington, in\r\nChesterfield, the residence of my friend and connection, Mr. Eppes; and,\r\nwhile there, I received a letter from the President, General Washington,\r\nby express, covering an appointment to be Secretary of State. [See\r\nAppendix, note H.] I received it with real regret. My wish had been\r\nto return to Paris, where I had left my household establishment, as\r\nif there myself, and to see the end of the Revolution, which, I then\r\nthought, would be certainly and happily closed in less than a year. I\r\nthen meant to return home, to withdraw from political life, into which\r\nI had been impressed by the circumstances of the times, to sink into\r\nthe bosom of my family and friends, and devote myself to studies more\r\ncongenial to my mind. In my answer of December 15th, I expressed these\r\ndispositions candidly to the President, and my preference of a return to\r\nParis; but assured him, that if it was believed I could be more useful\r\nin the administration of the government, I would sacrifice my own\r\ninclinations without hesitation, and repair to that destination: this I\r\nleft to his decision. I arrived at Monticello on the 23rd of December,\r\nwhere I received a second letter from the President, expressing his\r\ncontinued wish, that I should take my station there, but leaving\r\nme still at liberty to continue in my former office, if I could not\r\nreconcile myself to that now proposed. This silenced my reluctance, and\r\nI accepted the new appointment.\r\n\r\nIn the interval of my stay at home, my eldest daughter had been happily\r\nmarried to the eldest son of the Tuckahoe branch of Randolphs, a young\r\ngentleman of genius, science, and honorable mind, who afterwards filled\r\na dignified station in the General Government, and the most dignified\r\nin his own State. I left Monticello on the 1st of March, 1790, for New\r\nYork. At Philadelphia I called on the venerable and beloved Franklin.\r\nHe was then on the bed of sickness from which he never rose. My recent\r\nreturn from a country in which he had left so many friends, and the\r\nperilous convulsions to which they had been exposed, revived all his\r\nanxieties to know what part they had taken, what had been their course,\r\nand what their fate. He went over all in succession, with a rapidity and\r\nanimation, almost too much for his strength. When all his inquiries were\r\nsatisfied, and a pause took place, I told him I had learned with much\r\npleasure that, since his return to America, he had been occupied in\r\npreparing for the world, the history of his own life. ‘I cannot say much\r\nof that,’ said he; ‘but I will give you a sample of what I shall leave:’\r\nand he directed his little grandson (William Bache) who was standing by\r\nthe bedside, to hand him a paper from the table, to which he pointed. He\r\ndid so; and the Doctor putting it into my hands, desired me to take it,\r\nand read it at my leisure. It was about a quire of folio paper, written\r\nin a large and running hand, very like his own. I looked into it\r\nslightly, then shut it, and said I would accept his permission to read\r\nit, and would carefully return it. He said, ‘No, keep it.’ Not certain\r\nof his meaning, I again looked into it, folded it for my pocket, and\r\nsaid again, I would certainly return it. ‘No,’ said he, ‘keep it.’ I put\r\nit into my pocket, and shortly after, took leave of him. He died on\r\nthe 17th of the ensuing month of April; and as I understood that he had\r\nbequeathed all his papers to his grandson, William Temple Franklin, I\r\nimmediately wrote to Mr. Franklin, to inform him I possessed this paper,\r\nwhich I should consider as his property, and would deliver to his order.\r\nHe came on immediately to New York, called on me for it, and I delivered\r\nit to him. As he put it into his pocket, he said carelessly, he had\r\neither the original, or another copy of it, I do not recollect which.\r\nThis last expression struck my attention forcibly, and for the first\r\ntime suggested to me the thought, that Dr. Franklin had meant it as a\r\nconfidential deposite in my hands, and that I had done wrong in\r\nparting from it. I have not yet seen the collection he published of Dr.\r\nFranklin’s works, and therefore know not if this is among them. I\r\nhave been told it is not. It contained a narrative of the negotiations\r\nbetween Dr. Franklin and the British Ministry, when he was endeavoring\r\nto prevent the contest of arms which followed. The negotiation was\r\nbrought about by the intervention of Lord Howe and his sister, who, I\r\nbelieve, was called Lady Howe, but I may misremember her title. Lord\r\nHowe seems to have been friendly to America, and exceedingly anxious to\r\nprevent a rupture. His intimacy with Dr. Franklin, and his position\r\nwith the Ministry, induced him to undertake a mediation between them; in\r\nwhich his sister seemed to have been associated. They carried from\r\none to the other, backwards and forwards, the several propositions and\r\nanswers which passed, and seconded with their own intercessions, the\r\nimportance of mutual sacrifices, to preserve the peace and connection\r\nof the two countries. I remember that Lord North’s answers were dry,\r\nunyielding, in the spirit of unconditional submission, and betrayed an\r\nabsolute indifference to the occurrence of a rupture; and he said to\r\nthe mediators distinctly, at last, that ‘a rebellion was not to be\r\ndeprecated on the part of Great Britain; that the confiscations it would\r\nproduce, would provide for many of their friends.’ This expression was\r\nreported by the mediators to Dr. Franklin, and indicated so cool and\r\ncalculated a purpose in the Ministry, as to render compromise hopeless,\r\nand the negotiation was discontinued. If this is not among the papers\r\npublished, we ask, what has become of it? I delivered it with my own\r\nhands, into those of Temple Franklin. It certainly established views\r\nso atrocious in the British government, that its suppression would, to\r\nthem, be worth a great price. But could the grandson of Dr. Franklin\r\nbe, in such degree, an accomplice in the parricide of the memory of his\r\nimmortal grandfather? The suspension, for more than twenty years, of\r\nthe general publication, bequeathed and confided to him, produced for\r\na while hard suspicions against him: and if, at last, all are not\r\npublished, a part of these suspicions may remain with some.\r\n\r\nI arrived at New York on the 21st of March, where Congress was in\r\nsession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO THE MEMOIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE A.] Letter to John Saunderson, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMonticello, August 31, 1820.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 19th was received in due time, and I wish it were\r\nin my power to furnish you more fully, than in the enclosed paper,\r\nwith materials for the biography of George Wythe; but I possess none in\r\nwriting, am very distant from the place of his birth and early life,\r\nand know not a single person in that quarter from whom inquiry could\r\nbe made, with the expectation of collecting any thing material. Add\r\nto this, that feeble health disables me, almost, from writing; and,\r\nentirely, from the labor of going into difficult research. I became\r\nacquainted with Mr. Wythe when he was about thirty-five years of age.\r\nHe directed my studies in the law, led me into business, and continued,\r\nuntil death, my most affectionate friend. A close intimacy with him,\r\nduring that period of forty odd years, the most important of his life,\r\nenables me to state its leading facts, which, being of my own knowledge,\r\nI vouch their truth. Of what precedes that period, I speak from hearsay\r\nonly, in which there may be error, but of little account, as the\r\ncharacter of the facts will themselves manifest. In the epoch of his\r\nbirth I may err a little, stating that from the recollection of a\r\nparticular incident, the date of which, within a year or two, I do not\r\ndistinctly remember. These scanty outlines, you will be able, I hope,\r\nto fill up from other information, and they may serve you, sometimes, as\r\nlandmarks to distinguish truth from error, in what you hear from others.\r\nThe exalted virtue of the man will also be a polar star to guide you in\r\nall matters which may touch that element of his character. But on that\r\nyou will receive imputation from no man; for, as far as I know, he never\r\nhad an enemy. Little as I am able to contribute to the just reputation\r\nof this excellent man, it is the act of my life most gratifying to my\r\nheart: and leaves me only to regret that a waning memory can do no more.\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Hancock I can say nothing, having known him only in the chair of\r\nCongress. Having myself been the youngest man but one in that body, the\r\ndisparity of age prevented any particular intimacy. But of him there can\r\nbe no difficulty in obtaining full information in the North.\r\n\r\nI salute you, Sir, with sentiments of great respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes for the Biography of George Wythe_.\r\n\r\nGeorge Wythe was born about the year 1727 or 1728, of a respectable\r\nfamily in the county of Elizabeth City, on the shores of the Chesapeake.\r\nHe inherited, from his father, a fortune sufficient for independence and\r\nease. He had not the benefit of a regular education in the schools, but\r\nacquired a good one of himself, and without assistance; insomuch, as to\r\nbecome the best Latin and Greek scholar in the state. It is said, that\r\nwhile reading the Greek Testament, his mother held an English one,\r\nto aid him in rendering the Greek text conformably with that. He also\r\nacquired, by his own reading, a good knowledge of Mathematics, and of\r\nNatural and Moral Philosophy. He engaged in the study of the law under\r\nthe direction of a Mr. Lewis, of that profession, and went early to\r\nthe bar of the General Court, then occupied by men of great ability,\r\nlearning, and dignity in their profession. He soon became eminent\r\namong them, and, in process of time, the first at the bar, taking into\r\nconsideration his superior learning, correct elocution, and logical\r\nstyle of reasoning; for in pleading he never indulged himself with an\r\nuseless or declamatory thought or word; and became as distinguished by\r\ncorrectness and purity of conduct in his profession, as he was by his\r\nindustry and fidelity to those who employed him. He was early elected\r\nto the House of Representatives, then called the House of Burgesses, and\r\ncontinued in it until the Revolution. On the first dawn of that, instead\r\nof higgling on half-way principles, as others did who feared to follow\r\ntheir reason, he took his stand on the solid ground, that the only link\r\nof political union between us and Great Britain, was the identity of\r\nour Executive; that that nation and its Parliament had no more authority\r\nover us, than we had over them, and that we were co-ordinate nations\r\nwith Great Britain and Hanover.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, he was a member of a Committee of the House of Burgesses,\r\nappointed to prepare a Petition to the King, a Memorial to the House of\r\nLords, and a Remonstrance to the House of Commons, on the subject of the\r\nproposed Stamp Act. He was made draughtsman of the last, and, following\r\nhis own principles, he so far overwent the timid hesitations of\r\nhis colleagues, that his draught was subjected by them to material\r\nmodifications; and, when the famous Resolutions of Mr. Henry, in 1775,\r\nwere proposed, it was not on any difference of principle that they\r\nwere opposed by Wythe. Randolph, Pendleton, Nicholas, Bland, and other\r\nworthies, who had long been the habitual leaders of the House; but\r\nbecause those papers of the preceding session had already expressed the\r\nsame sentiments and assertions of right, and that an answer to them was\r\nyet to be expected.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1775, he was appointed a member of Congress, and in 1776,\r\nsigned the Declaration of Independence, of which he had, in debate,\r\nbeen an eminent supporter. And subsequently, in the same year, he was\r\nappointed by the Legislature of Virginia, one of a committee to revise\r\nthe laws of the state, as well of British, as of Colonial enactment,\r\nand to prepare bills for re-enacting them, with such alterations as\r\nthe change in the form and principles of the government, and other\r\ncircumstances, required: and of this work, he executed the period\r\ncommencing with the revolution in England, and ending with the\r\nestablishment of the new government here; excepting the Acts for\r\nregulating descents, for religious freedom, and for proportioning\r\ncrimes and punishments. In 1777, he was chosen speaker of the House\r\nof Delegates, being of distinguished learning in parliamentary law and\r\nproceedings; and towards the end of the same year, he was appointed one\r\nof the three Chancellors, to whom that department of the Judiciary\r\nwas confided, on the first organization of the new government. On a\r\nsubsequent change of the form of that court, he was appointed sole\r\nChancellor, in which office he continued to act until his death, which\r\nhappened in June, 1806, about the seventy-eighth or seventy-ninth year\r\nof his age.\r\n\r\nMr. Wythe had been twice married; first, I believe, to a daughter of\r\nMr. Lewis, with whom he had studied law, and afterwards, to a Miss\r\nTaliaferro, of a wealthy and respectable family in the neighborhood of\r\nWilliamsburg; by neither of whom did he leave issue.\r\n\r\nNo man ever left behind him a character more venerated than George\r\nWythe. His virtue was of the purest tint; his integrity inflexible,\r\nand his justice exact; of warm patriotism, and, devoted as he was to\r\nliberty, and the natural and equal rights of man, he might truly be\r\ncalled the Cato of his country, without the avarice of the Roman; for a\r\nmore disinterested person never lived. Temperance and regularity in all\r\nhis habits, gave him general good health, and his unaffected modesty and\r\nsuavity of manners endeared him to every one. He was of easy elocution,\r\nhis language chaste, methodical in the arrangement of his matter,\r\nlearned and logical in the use of it, and of great urbanity in debate;\r\nnot quick of apprehension, but, with a little time, profound in\r\npenetration, and sound in conclusion. In his philosophy he was firm,\r\nand neither troubling, nor perhaps trusting, any one with his religious\r\ncreed, he left the world to the conclusion, that that religion must be\r\ngood which could produce a life of exemplary virtue.\r\n\r\nHis stature was of the middle size, well formed and proportioned, and\r\nthe features of his face were manly, comely, and engaging. Such was\r\nGeorge Wythe, the honor of his own, and the model of future times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE B.]--Letter to Samuel A. Wells, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMonticello, May 12, 1829.\r\n\r\nAn absence, of sometime, at an occasional and distant residence, must\r\napologize for the delay in acknowledging the receipt of your favor of\r\nApril 12th; and candor obliges me to add, that it has been somewhat\r\nextended by an aversion to writing, as well as to calls on my memory\r\nfor facts so much obliterated from it by time, as to lessen my own\r\nconfidence in the traces which seem to remain. One of the enquiries in\r\nyour letter, however, may be answered without an appeal to the memory.\r\nIt is that respecting the question, Whether committees of correspondence\r\noriginated in Virginia, or Massachusetts? on which you suppose me to\r\nhave claimed it for Virginia; but certainly I have never made such\r\na claim. The idea, I suppose, has been taken up from what is said in\r\nWirt’s history of Mr. Henry, page 87, and from an inexact attention\r\nto its precise terms. It is there said, ‘This House [of Burgesses,\r\nof Virginia] had the merit of originating that powerful engine of\r\nresistance, corresponding committees between the legislatures of the\r\ndifferent colonies.’ That the fact, as here expressed, is true, your\r\nletter bears witness, when it says, that the resolutions of Virginia,\r\nfor this purpose, were transmitted to the speakers of the different\r\nassemblies, and by that of Massachusetts was laid, at the next session,\r\nbefore that body, who appointed a committee for the specified\r\nobject: adding, ‘Thus, in Massachusetts, there were two committees of\r\ncorrespondence, one chosen by the people, the other appointed by the\r\nHouse of Assembly; in the former, Massachusetts preceded Virginia; in\r\nthe latter, Virginia preceded Massachusetts.’ To the origination of\r\ncommittees for the interior correspondence between the counties and\r\ntowns of a state, I know of no claim on the part of Virginia; and\r\ncertainly none was ever made by myself. I perceive, however, one error,\r\ninto which memory had led me. Our committee for national correspondence\r\nwas appointed in March, ‘73, and I well remember, that going to\r\nWilliamsburg in the month of June following, Peyton Randolph, our\r\nchairman, told me that messengers bearing despatches between the two\r\nstates had crossed each other by the way, that of Virginia carrying our\r\npropositions for a committee of national correspondence, and that of\r\nMassachusetts, bringing, as my memory suggested, a similar proposition.\r\nBut here I must have misremembered; and the resolutions brought us from\r\nMassachusetts were probably those you mention of the town-meeting of\r\nBoston, on the motion of Mr. Samuel Adams, appointing a committee ‘to\r\nstate the rights of the colonists, and of that province in particular,\r\nand the infringements of them; to communicate them to the several towns,\r\nas the sense of the town of Boston, and to request, of each town, a\r\nfree, communication of its sentiments on this subject.’ I suppose,\r\ntherefore, that these resolutions were not received, as you think, while\r\nthe House of Burgesses was in session in March, 1773, but a few days\r\nafter we rose, and were probably what was sent by the messenger, who\r\ncrossed ours by the way. They may, however, have been still different.\r\nI must, therefore, have been mistaken in supposing, and stating to Mr.\r\nWirt, that the proposition of a committee for national correspondence\r\nwas nearly simultaneous in Virginia and Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nA similar misapprehension of another passage in Mr. Wirt’s book, for\r\nwhich I am also quoted, has produced a similar reclamation on the\r\npart of Massachusetts, by some of her most distinguished and estimable\r\ncitizens. I had been applied to by Mr. Wirt, for such facts respecting\r\nMr. Henry, as my intimacy with him and participation in the transactions\r\nof the day, might have placed within my knowledge. I accordingly\r\ncommitted them to paper; and Virginia being the theatre of his action,\r\nwas the only subject within my contemplation. While speaking of him,\r\nof the resolutions and measures here, in which he had the acknowledged\r\nlead, I used the expression that ‘Mr. Henry certainly gave the first\r\nimpulse to the ball of revolution.’ [Wirt, page 41.] The expression is\r\nindeed general, and in all its extension would comprehend all the sister\r\nstates; but indulgent construction would restrain it, as was really\r\nmeant, to the subject matter under contemplation, which was Virginia\r\nalone; according to the rule of the lawyers, and a fair canon of general\r\ncriticism, that every expression should be construed _secundum subjectam\r\nmateriam_. Where the first attack was made, there must have been of\r\ncourse, the first act of resistance, and that was in Massachusetts. Our\r\nfirst overt act of war, was Mr. Henry’s embodying a force of militia\r\nfrom several counties, regularly armed and organized, marching them in\r\nmilitary array, and making reprisal on the King’s treasury at the seat\r\nof government, for the public powder taken away by his Governor. This\r\nwas on the last days of April, 1775. Your formal battle of Lexington was\r\nten or twelve days before that, and greatly overshadowed in importance,\r\nas it preceded in time, our little affray, which merely amounted to\r\na levying of arms against the King; and very possibly, you had had\r\nmilitary affrays before the regular battle of Lexington.\r\n\r\nThese explanations will, I hope, assure you, Sir, that so far as either\r\nfacts or opinions have been truly quoted from me, they have never been\r\nmeant to intercept the just fame of Massachusetts, for the promptitude\r\nand perseverance of her early resistance. We willingly cede to her the\r\nlaud of having been (although not exclusively) ‘the cradle of sound\r\nprinciples,’ and, if some of us believe she has deflected from them in\r\nher course, we retain full confidence in her ultimate return to them.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to your quotation from Mr. Galloway’s statement of\r\nwhat passed in Congress, on their Declaration of Independence; in\r\nwhich statement there is not one word of truth, and where bearing some\r\nresemblance to truth, it is an entire perversion of it. I do not charge\r\nthis on Mr. Galloway himself; his desertion having taken place long\r\nbefore these measures, he doubtless received his information from some\r\nof the loyal friends whom he left behind him. But as yourself, as\r\nwell as others, appear embarrassed by inconsistent accounts of the\r\nproceedings on that memorable occasion, and as those who have endeavored\r\nto restore the truth, have themselves committed some errors, I will give\r\nyou some extracts from a written document on that subject; for the\r\ntruth of which, I pledge myself to heaven and earth; having, while the\r\nquestion of Independence was under consideration before Congress, taken\r\nwritten notes, in my seat, of what was passing, and reduced them to form\r\non the final conclusion. I have now before me that paper, from which\r\nthe following are extracts. ‘Friday, June 7th, 1776. The delegates from\r\nVirginia moved, in obedience to instructions from their constituents,\r\nthat the Congress should declare that these United Colonies are, and of\r\nright ought to be, free and independent states; that they are absolved\r\nfrom all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political\r\nconnection between them and the state of Great Britain is, and ought\r\nto be, totally dissolved; that measures should be immediately taken\r\nfor procuring the assistance of foreign powers, and a Confederation\r\nbe formed to bind the colonies more closely together. The House being\r\nobliged to attend at that time to some other business, the proposition\r\nwas referred to the next day, when the members were ordered to attend\r\npunctually at ten o’clock. Saturday, June 8th. They proceeded to take\r\nit into consideration, and referred it to a committee of the whole,\r\ninto which they immediately resolved themselves, and passed that day and\r\nMonday, the 10th, in debating on the subject.\r\n\r\n‘It appearing, in the course of these debates, that the colonies of New\r\nYork, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delware, Maryland, and South Carolina,\r\nwere not yet matured for falling from the parent stem, but that they\r\nwere fast advancing to that state, it was thought most prudent to wait\r\na while for them, and to postpone the final decision to July 1st. But,\r\nthat this might occasion as little delay as possible, a Committee was\r\nappointed to prepare a Declaration of Independence. The Committee were\r\nJohn Adams, Dr. Franklin, Roger Sherman, Robert R. Livingston, and\r\nmyself. This was reported to the House on Friday the 28th of June, when\r\nit was read and ordered to lie on the table. On Monday, the 1st of July,\r\nthe House resolved itself into a Committee of the whole, and resumed the\r\nconsideration of the original motion made by the delegates of Virginia,\r\nwhich, being again debated through the day, was carried in the\r\naffirmative by the votes of New Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia. South Carolina and Pennsylvania voted against it. Delaware had\r\nbut two members present, and they were divided. The delegates from\r\nNew York declared they were for it themselves, and were assured their\r\nconstituents were for it; but that their instructions having been drawn\r\nnear a twelvemonth before, when reconciliation was still the general\r\nobject, they were enjoined by them, to do nothing which should impede\r\nthat object. They, therefore, thought themselves not justifiable in\r\nvoting on either side, and asked leave to withdraw from the question,\r\nwhich was given them. The Committee rose, and reported their resolution\r\nto the House. Mr. Rutledge, of South Carolina, then requested the\r\ndetermination might be put off to the next day, as he believed his\r\ncolleagues, though they disapproved of the resolution, would then join\r\nin it for the sake of unanimity. The ultimate question, whether the\r\nHouse would agree to the resolution of the Committee, was accordingly\r\npostponed to the next day, when it was again moved, and South Carolina\r\nconcurred in voting for it. In the mean time, a third member had come\r\npost from the Delaware counties, and turned the vote of that colony in\r\nfavor of the resolution. Members of a different sentiment attending that\r\nmorning from Pennsylvania also, her vote was changed; so that the whole\r\ntwelve colonies, who were authorized to vote at all, gave their votes\r\nfor it; and within a few days [July 9th] the convention of New York\r\napproved of it, and thus supplied the void occasioned by the withdrawing\r\nof their delegates from the vote.’ [Be careful to observe, that this\r\nvacillation and vote were on the original motion of the 7th of June,\r\nby the Virginia delegates, that Congress should declare the colonies\r\nindependent.] ‘Congress proceeded, the same day, to consider the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, which had been reported and laid on the\r\ntable the Friday preceding, and on Monday referred to a Committee of\r\nthe whole. The pusillanimous idea, that we had friends in England worth\r\nkeeping terms with, still haunted the minds of many. For this reason,\r\nthose passages which conveyed censures on the people of England were\r\nstruck out, lest they should give them offence. The debates having taken\r\nup the greater parts of the second, third, and fourth days of July,\r\nwere, in the evening of the last, closed: the Declaration was reported\r\nby the Committee, agreed to by the House, and signed by every member\r\npresent except Mr. Dickinson.’ So far my notes.\r\n\r\nGovernor M’Kean, in his letter to M’Corkle of July 16th, 1817, has\r\nthrown some lights on the transactions of that day: but, trusting to his\r\nmemory chiefly, at an age when our memories are not to be trusted, he\r\nhas confounded two questions, and ascribed proceedings to one which\r\nbelonged to the other. These two questions were, 1st, the Virginia\r\nmotion of June the 7th, to declare Independence; and 2nd, the actual\r\nDeclaration, its matter and form. Thus he states the question on the\r\nDeclaration itself, as decided on the 1st of July; but it was the\r\nVirginia motion which was voted on that day in committee of the whole;\r\nSouth Carolina, as well as Pennsylvania, then voting against it. But the\r\nultimate decision in the House, on the report of the Committee, being,\r\nby request, postponed to the next morning, all the states voted for it,\r\nexcept New York, whose vote was delayed for the reason before stated. It\r\nwas not till the 2nd of July, that the Declaration itself was taken up;\r\nnor till the 4th, that it was decided, and it was signed by every member\r\npresent, except Mr. Dickinson.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent signatures of members who were not then present, and some\r\nof them not yet in office, is easily explained, if we observe who they\r\nwere; to wit, that they were of New York and Pennsylvania. New York\r\ndid not sign till the 15th, because it was not till the 9th, (five days\r\nafter the general signature,) that their Convention authorized them to\r\ndo so. The Convention of Pennsylvania, learning that it had been signed\r\nby a majority only of their delegates, named a new delegation on the\r\n20th, leaving out Mr. Dickinson, who had refused to sign, Willing and\r\nHumphreys, who had withdrawn, reappointing the three members who had\r\nsigned, Morris, who had not been present, and five new ones, to wit,\r\nRush, Clymer, Smith, Taylor, and Ross: and Morris and the five new\r\nmembers were permitted to sign, because it manifested the assent of\r\ntheir full delegation, and the express will of their Convention, which\r\nmight have been doubted on the former signature of a minority only. Why\r\nthe signature of Thornton, of New Hampshire, was permitted so late\r\nas the 4th of November, I cannot now say; but undoubtedly for some\r\nparticular reason, which we should find to have been good, had it been\r\nexpressed. These were the only post-signers, and you see, sir,\r\nthat there were solid reasons for receiving those of New York and\r\nPennsylvania, and that this circumstance in no wise affects the faith of\r\nthis Declaratory Charter of our rights, and of the rights of man.\r\n\r\nWith a view to correct errors of fact before they become inveterate by\r\nrepetition, I have stated what I find essentially material in my papers,\r\nbut with that brevity which the labor of writing constrains me to use.\r\n\r\nOn the four particular articles of inquiry in your letter, respecting\r\nyour grandfather, the venerable Samuel Adams, neither memory nor\r\nmemorandums enable me to give any information. I can say that he was\r\ntruly a great man, wise in council, fertile in resources, immovable in\r\nhis purposes, and had, I think, a greater share than any other member,\r\nin advising and directing our measures in the Northern war. As a\r\nspeaker, he could not be compared with his living colleague and\r\nnamesake, whose deep conceptions, nervous style, and undaunted firmness,\r\nmade him truly our bulwark in debate. But Mr. Samuel Adams, although not\r\nof fluent elocution, was so rigorously logical, so clear in his views,\r\nabundant in good sense, and master always of his subject, that he\r\ncommanded the most profound attention whenever he rose in an assembly,\r\nby which the froth of declamation was heard with the most sovereign\r\ncontempt. I sincerely rejoice that the record of his worth is to be\r\nundertaken by one so much disposed as you will be, to hand him down\r\nfairly to that posterity, for whose liberty and happiness he was so\r\nzealous a laborer.\r\n\r\nWith sentiments of sincere veneration for his memory, accept yourself\r\nthis tribute to it, with the assurances of my great respect.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. August 6th, 1822. Since the date of this letter, to wit, this\r\nday, August 6, ‘22, I have received the new publication of the Secret\r\nJournals of Congress, wherein is stated a resolution of July 19th,\r\n1776, that the Declaration passed on the 4th, be fairly engrossed on\r\nparchment, and when engrossed, be signed by every member; and another\r\nof August 2nd, that being engrossed and compared at the table, it was\r\nsigned by the members; that is to say, the copy engrossed on parchment\r\n(for durability) was signed by the members, after being compared at the\r\ntable with the original one signed on paper, as before stated. I add\r\nthis P. S. to the copy of my letter to Mr. Wells, to prevent confounding\r\nthe signature of the original with that of the copy engrossed on\r\nparchment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE C]--August, 1774, Instructions to the first Delegation\r\n\r\nOn the Instructions given to the first Delegation of Virginia to\r\nCongress, in August, 1774.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of Virginia happened to be in session in Williamsburg,\r\nwhen news was received of the passage, by the British Parliament, of the\r\nBoston Port Bill, which was to take effect on the first day of June\r\nthen ensuing. The House of Burgesses, thereupon, passed a resolution,\r\nrecommending to their fellow-citizens that that day should be set apart\r\nfor fasting and prayer to the Supreme Being, imploring him to avert the\r\ncalamities then threatening us, and to give us one heart and one mind\r\nto oppose every invasion of our liberties. The next day, May the 20th,\r\n1774, the Governor dissolved us. We immediately repaired to a room in\r\nthe Raleigh tavern, about one hundred paces distant from the Capitol,\r\nformed ourselves into a meeting, Peyton Randolph in the chair, and\r\ncame to resolutions, declaring, that an attack on one colony to enforce\r\narbitrary acts, ought to be considered as an attack on all, and to\r\nbe opposed by the united wisdom of all. We, therefore, appointed a\r\nCommittee of Correspondence, to address letters to the Speakers of\r\nthe several Houses of Representatives of the colonies, proposing\r\nthe appointment of deputies from each, to meet annually in a general\r\nCongress, to deliberate on their common interests, and on the measures\r\nto be pursued in common. The members then separated to their several\r\nhomes, except those of the Committee, who met the next day, prepared\r\nletters according to instructions, and despatched them by messengers\r\nexpress, to their several destinations. It had been agreed, also by the\r\nmeeting, that the Burgesses, who should be elected under the writs then\r\nissuing, should be requested to meet in Convention on a certain day in\r\nAugust, to learn the result of these letters, and to appoint delegates\r\nto a Congress, should that measure be approved by the other colonies. At\r\nthe election, the people re-elected every man of the former Assembly, as\r\na proof of their approbation of what they had done. Before I left home\r\nto attend the Convention, I prepared what I thought might be given,\r\nin instruction, to the Delegates who should be appointed to attend the\r\nGeneral Congress proposed. They were drawn in haste, with a number of\r\nblanks, with some uncertainties and inaccuracies of historical facts,\r\nwhich I neglected at the moment, knowing they could be readily corrected\r\nat the meeting. I set out on my journey, but was taken sick on the road,\r\nand was unable to proceed. I therefore sent on, by express, two copies,\r\none under cover to Patrick Henry, the other to Peyton Randolph, who I\r\nknew would be in the chair of the Convention. Of the former no more was\r\never heard or known. Mr. Henry probably thought it too bold, as a first\r\nmeasure, as the majority of the members did. On the other copy being\r\nlaid on the table of the Convention, by Peyton Randolph, as the\r\nproposition of a member who was prevented from attendance by sickness\r\non the road, tamer sentiments were preferred, and, I believe, wisely\r\npreferred; the leap I proposed being too long, as yet, for the mass of\r\nour citizens. The distance between these, and the instructions actually\r\nadopted, is of some curiosity, however, as it shows the inequality of\r\npace with which we moved, and the prudence required to keep front and\r\nrear together. My creed had been formed on unsheathing the sword at\r\nLexington. They printed the paper, however, and gave it the title of ‘A\r\nSummary View of the Rights of British America.’ In this form it got to\r\nLondon, where the opposition took it up, shaped it to opposition views,\r\nand, in that form, it ran rapidly through several editions.\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall, in his history of General Washington, chapter 3, speaking\r\nof this proposition for Committees of correspondence and for a General\r\nCongress, says, ‘this measure had already been proposed in town meeting\r\nin Boston,’ and some pages before he had said, that ‘at a session of\r\nthe General Court of Massachusetts, in September, 1770, that Court, in\r\npursuance of a favorite idea of uniting all the colonies in one system\r\nof measures, elected a Committee of correspondence, to communicate with\r\nsuch Committees as might be appointed by the other colonies.’ This is an\r\nerror. The Committees of correspondence, elected by Massachusetts, were\r\nexpressly for a correspondence among the several towns of that province\r\nonly. Besides the text of their proceedings, his own note X, proves\r\nthis. The first proposition for a general correspondence between the\r\nseveral states, and for a General Congress, was made by our meeting of\r\nMay, 1774. Botta, copying Marshall, has repeated his error, and so it\r\nwill be handed on from copyist to copyist, _ad infinitum_. Here follow\r\nmy proposition, and the more prudent one which was adopted.\r\n\r\n‘Resolved, That it be an instruction to the said deputies, when\r\nassembled in General Congress, with the deputies from the other states\r\nof British America, to propose to the said Congress that an humble and\r\ndutiful address be presented to his Majesty, begging leave to lay before\r\nhim, as Chief Magistrate of the British empire, the united complaints of\r\nhis Majesty’s subjects in America; complaints which are excited by many\r\nunwarrantable encroachments and usurpations, attempted to be made by the\r\nlegislature of one part of the empire upon the rights which God and the\r\nlaws have given equally and independently to all. To represent to his\r\nMajesty that, these, his States, have often individually made humble\r\napplication to his imperial throne, to obtain, through its intervention,\r\nsome redress of their injured rights; to none of which was ever even\r\nan answer condescended. Humbly to hope that this, their joint address,\r\npenned in the language of truth, and divested of those expressions of\r\nservility which would persuade his Majesty that we are asking favors,\r\nand not rights, shall obtain from his Majesty a more respectful\r\nacceptance; and this his Majesty will think we have reason to expect,\r\nwhen he reflects that he is no more than the chief officer of the\r\npeople, appointed by the laws, and circumscribed with definite powers,\r\nto assist in working the great machine of government, erected for their\r\nuse, and, consequently, subject to their superintendence; and in order\r\nthat these, our rights, as well as the invasions of them, may be laid\r\nmore fully before his Majesty, to take a view of them from the origin\r\nand first settlement of these countries.\r\n\r\n‘To remind him that our ancestors, before their emigration to America,\r\nwere the free inhabitants of the British dominions in Europe, and\r\npossessed a right, which nature has given to all men, of departing from\r\nthe country in which chance, not choice, has placed them, of going in\r\nquest of new habitations, and of there establishing new societies, under\r\nsuch laws and regulations, as to them shall seem most likely to promote\r\npublic happiness. That their Saxon ancestors had, under this universal\r\nlaw, in like manner left their native wilds and woods in the North of\r\nEurope, had possessed themselves of the island of Britain, then less\r\ncharged with inhabitants, and had established there that system of laws\r\nwhich has so long been the glory and protection of that country. Nor was\r\never any claim of superiority or dependence asserted over them, by that\r\nmother country from which they had migrated: and were such a claim made,\r\nit is believed his Majesty’s subjects in Great Britain have too firm a\r\nfeeling of the rights derived to them from their ancestors, to bow down\r\nthe sovereignty of their state before such visionary pretensions. And it\r\nis thought that no circumstance has occurred to distinguish, materially,\r\nthe British from the Saxon emigration. America was conquered, and her\r\nsettlements made and firmly established, at the expense of individuals,\r\nand not of the British public. Their own blood was spilt in acquiring\r\nlands for their settlement, their own fortunes expended in making that\r\nsettlement effectual. For themselves they fought, for themselves they\r\nconquered, and for themselves alone they have right to hold. No shilling\r\nwas ever issued from the public treasures of his Majesty, or his\r\nancestors, for their assistance, till of very late times, after the\r\ncolonies had become established on a firm and permanent fooling. That\r\nthen, indeed, having become valuable to Great Britain for her commercial\r\npurposes, his Parliament was pleased to lend them assistance, against\r\nan enemy who would fain have drawn to herself the benefits of their\r\ncommerce, to the great aggrandizement of herself, and danger of Great\r\nBritain. Such assistance, and in such circumstances, they had often\r\nbefore given to Portugal and other allied states, with whom they carry\r\non a commercial intercourse. Yet these states never supposed, that\r\nby calling in her aid, they thereby submitted themselves to her\r\nsovereignty. Had such terms been proposed, they would have rejected them\r\nwith disdain, and trusted for better to the moderation of their enemies,\r\nor to a vigorous exertion of their own force. We do not, however, mean\r\nto underrate those aids, which, to us, were doubtless valuable, on\r\nwhatever principles granted: but we would show that they cannot give a\r\ntitle to that authority which the British Parliament would arrogate over\r\nus; and that they may amply be repaid, by our giving to the inhabitants\r\nof Great Britain such exclusive privileges in trade as may be\r\nadvantageous to them, and, at the same time, not too restrictive to\r\nourselves. That settlement having been thus effected in the wilds of\r\nAmerica, the emigrants thought proper to adopt that system of laws,\r\nunder which they had hitherto lived in the mother country, and to\r\ncontinue their union with her, by submitting themselves to the same\r\ncommon sovereign, who was thereby made the central link, connecting the\r\nseveral parts of the empire thus newly multiplied.\r\n\r\n‘But that not long were they permitted, however far they thought\r\nthemselves removed from the hand of oppression, to hold undisturbed,\r\nthe rights thus acquired at the hazard of their lives and loss of their\r\nfortunes. A family of Princes was then on the British throne, whose\r\ntreasonable crimes against their people brought on them, afterwards, the\r\nexertion of those sacred and sovereign rights of punishment, reserved\r\nin the hands of the people for cases of extreme necessity, and judged by\r\nthe constitution unsafe to be delegated to any other judicature. While\r\nevery day brought forth some new and unjustifiable exertion of power\r\nover their subjects on that side the water, it, was not to be expected\r\nthat those here, much less able at that time to oppose the designs of\r\ndespotism, should be exempted from injury. Accordingly, this country,\r\nwhich had been acquired by the lives, the labors, and fortunes of\r\nindividual adventurers, was by these Princes, at several times, parted\r\nout and distributed among the favorites and followers of their fortunes;\r\nand, by an assumed right of the crown alone, were erected into distinct\r\nand independent governments; a measure, which, it is believed, his\r\nMajesty’s prudence and understanding would prevent him from imitating at\r\nthis day; as no exercise of such power, of dividing and dismembering a\r\ncountry, has ever occurred in his Majesty’s realm of England, though now\r\nof very ancient standing; nor could it be justified or acquiesced under\r\nthere, or in any other part of his Majesty’s empire.\r\n\r\n‘That the exercise of a free trade with all parts of the world,\r\npossessed by the American colonists, as of natural right, and which\r\nno law of their own had taken away or abridged, was next the object\r\nof unjust encroachment. Some of the colonies having thought proper to\r\ncontinue the administration of their government in the name and\r\nunder the authority of his Majesty, King Charles the First, whom,\r\nnotwithstanding his late deposition by the Commonwealth of England, they\r\ncontinued in the sovereignty of their State, the Parliament, for the\r\nCommonwealth, took the same in high offence, and assumed upon themselves\r\nthe power of prohibiting their trade with all other parts of the world,\r\nexcept the Island of Great Britain. This arbitrary act, however, they\r\nsoon recalled, and by solemn treaty entered into on the 12th day of\r\nMarch, 1651, between the said Commonwealth by their Commissioners, and\r\nthe colony of Virginia by their House of Burgesses, it was expressly\r\nstipulated by the eighth article of the said treaty, that they should\r\nhave “free trade as the people of England do enjoy to all places and\r\nwith all nations, according to the laws of that Commonwealth.” But that,\r\nupon the restoration of his Majesty, King Charles the Second, their\r\nrights of free commerce fell once more a victim to arbitrary power: and\r\nby several acts of his reign, as well as of some of his successors, the\r\ntrade of the colonies was laid under such restrictions, as show what\r\nhopes they might form from the justice of a British Parliament, were its\r\nuncontrolled power admitted over these States.*\r\n\r\n     *12.

C.2. c.13.\r\n\r\nHistory has informed us, that bodies of men, as well as individuals, are\r\nsusceptible of the spirit of tyranny. A view of these acts of Parliament\r\nfor regulation, as it has been affectedly called, of the American trade,\r\nif all other evidences were removed out of the case, would undeniably\r\nevince the truth of this observation. Besides the duties they impose\r\non our articles of export and import, they prohibit our going to any\r\nmarkets northward of Cape Finisterra, in the kingdom of Spain, for the\r\nsale of commodities which Great Britian will not take from us, and for\r\nthe purchase of others, with which she cannot supply us; and that, for\r\nno other than the arbitrary purpose of purchasing for themselves, by\r\na sacrifice of our rights and interests, certain privileges in their\r\ncommerce with an allied state, who, in confidence that their exclusive\r\ntrade with America will be continued, while the principles and power of\r\nthe British Parliament be the same, have indulged themselves in every\r\nexorbitance which their avarice could dictate, or our necessities\r\nextort; have raised their commodities called for in America, to\r\nthe double and treble of what they sold for, before such exclusive\r\nprivileges were given them, and of what better commodities of the same\r\nkind would cost us elsewhere; and, at the same time, give us much less\r\nfor what we carry thither, than might be had at more convenient ports.\r\nThat these acts prohibit us from carrying, in quest of other purchasers,\r\nthe surplus of our tobaccos, remaining after the consumption of Great\r\nBritain is supplied: so that we must leave them with the British\r\nmerchant, for whatever he will please to allow us, to be by him\r\nre-shipped to foreign markets, where he will reap the benefits of\r\nmaking sale of them for full value. That, to heighten still the idea of\r\nParliamentary justice, and to show with what moderation they are like to\r\nexercise power, where themselves are to feel no part of its weight, we\r\ntake leave to mention to his Majesty certain other acts of the British\r\nParliament, by which they would prohibit us from manufacturing, for our\r\nown use, the articles we raise on our own lands, with our own labor. By\r\nan act passed in the fifth year of the reign of his late Majesty, King\r\nGeorge the Second, an American subject is forbidden to make a hat for\r\nhimself, of the fur which he has taken, perhaps on his own soil; an\r\ninstance of despotism, to which no parallel can be produced in the\r\nmost arbitrary ages of British history. By one other act, passed in\r\nthe twenty-third year of the same reign, the iron which we make, we are\r\nforbidden to manufacture; and, heavy as that article is, and necessary\r\nin every branch of husbandry, besides commission and insurance, we are\r\nto pay freight for it to Great Britain, and freight for it back again,\r\nfor the purpose of supporting, not men, but machines, in the island of\r\nGreat Britain. In the same spirit of equal and impartial legislation, is\r\nto be viewed the act of Parliament, passed in the fifth year of the\r\nsame reign, by which American lands are made subject to the demands\r\nof British creditors, while their own lands were still continued\r\nunanswerable for their debts; from which one of these conclusions must\r\nnecessarily follow, either that justice is not the same thing in America\r\nas in Britain, or else that the British Parliament pay less regard to\r\nit here than there. But, that we do not point out to his Majesty the\r\ninjustice of these acts, with intent to rest on that principle the cause\r\nof their nullity; but to show that experience confirms the propriety of\r\nthose political principles, which exempt us from the jurisdiction of the\r\nBritish Parliament. The true ground on which we declare these acts void,\r\nis, that the British Parliament has no right to exercise authority over\r\nus.\r\n\r\n‘That these exercises of usurped power have not been confined to\r\ninstances alone, in which themselves were interested; but they have\r\nalso intermeddled with the regulation of the internal affairs of the\r\ncolonies. The act of the 9th of Anne for establishing a post-office in\r\nAmerica seems to have had little connection with British convenience,\r\nexcept that of accommodating his Majesty’s ministers and favorites with\r\nthe sale of a lucrative and easy office.\r\n\r\n‘That thus have we hastened through the reigns which preceded his\r\nMajesty’s, during which the violations of our rights were less alarming,\r\nbecause repeated at more distant intervals, than that rapid and bold\r\nsuccession of injuries, which is likely to distinguish the present from\r\nall other periods of American story. Scarcely have our minds been able\r\nto emerge from the astonishment, into which one stroke of Parliamentary\r\nthunder has involved us, before another more heavy and more alarming is\r\nfallen on us. Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental\r\nopinion of a day; but a series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished\r\nperiod, and pursued unalterably through every change of ministers, too\r\nplainly prove a deliberate, systematical plan of reducing us to slavery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Acts of King George and Parliament, page107]\r\n\r\n‘That the act passed in the fourth year of his Majesty’s reign, entitled\r\n“an act [ Act for granting certain duties.]\r\n\r\n‘One other act passed in the fifth year of his reign, entitled “an act\r\n[Stamp Act.]\r\n\r\n‘One other act passed in the sixth year of his reign, entitled “an act\r\n[Act declaring the right of Parliament over the colonies.]\r\n\r\n‘And one other act passed in the seventh year of his reign, entitled an\r\nact [ Act for granting duties on paper, tea, &c.\r\n\r\n‘Form that connected chain of parliamentary usurpation, which has\r\nalready been the subject of frequent applications to his Majesty, and\r\nthe Houses of Lords and Commons of Great Britain; and, no answers having\r\nyet been condescended to any of these, we shall not trouble his Majesty\r\nwith a repetition of the matters they contained.\r\n\r\n‘But that one other act passed in the same seventh year of his reign,\r\nhaving been a peculiar attempt, must ever require peculiar mention. It\r\nis entitled “an act [Act suspending Legislature of New York.]\r\n\r\n‘One free and independent legislature hereby takes upon itself to\r\nsuspend the powers of another, free and independent as itself. Thus\r\nexhibiting a phenomenon unknown in nature, the creator and creature of\r\nits own power. Not only the principles of common sense, but the common\r\nfeelings of human nature must be surrendered up, before his Majesty’s\r\nsubjects here can be persuaded to believe, that they hold their\r\npolitical existence at the will of a British Parliament. Shall these\r\ngovernments be dissolved, their property annihilated, and their people\r\nreduced to a state of nature, at the imperious breath of a body of men\r\nwhom they never saw, in whom they never confided, and over whom they\r\nhave no powers of punishment or removal, let their crimes against the\r\nAmerican public be ever so great? Can any one reason be assigned, why\r\none hundred and sixty thousand electors in the island of Great Britain\r\nshould give law to four millions in the states of America, every\r\nindividual of whom is equal to every individual of them in virtue, in\r\nunderstanding, and in bodily strength? Were this to be admitted, instead\r\nof being a free people, as we have hitherto supposed, and mean to\r\ncontinue ourselves, we should suddenly be found the slaves, not of one,\r\nbut of one hundred and sixty thousand tyrants; distinguished, too, from\r\nall others, by this singular circumstance, that they are removed from\r\nthe reach of fear, the only restraining motive which may hold the hand\r\nof a tyrant.\r\n\r\n‘That, by “an act to discontinue in such manner, and for such time as\r\nare therein mentioned, the landing and discharging, lading or shipping\r\nof goods, wares, and merchandise, at the town and within the harbor of\r\nBoston, in the province of Massachusetts Bay, in North America,” [14\r\nG.3.] which was passed at the last session of the British Parliament,\r\na large and populous town, whose trade was their sole subsistence, was\r\ndeprived of that trade, and involved in utter ruin. Let us for a while,\r\nsuppose the question of right suspended, in order to examine this act\r\non principles of justice. An act of Parliament had been passed, imposing\r\nduties on teas, to be paid in America, against which act the Americans\r\nhad protested, as inauthoritative. The East India Company, who till that\r\ntime had never sent a pound of tea to America on their own account, step\r\nforth on that occasion, the asserters of Parliamentary right, and send\r\nhither many ship-loads of that obnoxious commodity. The masters of their\r\nseveral vessels, however, on their arrival in America, wisely attended\r\nto admonition, and returned with their cargoes. In the province of New\r\nEngland alone, the remonstrances of the people were disregarded, and\r\na compliance, after being many days waited for, was flatly refused.\r\nWhether in this, the master of the vessel was governed by his obstinacy,\r\nor his instructions, let those who know, say. There are extraordinary\r\nsituations which require extraordinary interposition. An exasperated\r\npeople, who feel that they possess power, are not easily restrained\r\nwithin limits strictly regular. A number of them assembled in the town\r\nof Boston, threw the tea into the ocean, and dispersed without doing any\r\nother act of violence. If in this they did wrong, they were known, and\r\nwere amenable to the laws of the land; against which, it could not\r\nbe objected that they had ever, in any instance, been obstructed or\r\ndiverted from their regular course, in favor of popular offenders. They\r\nshould, therefore, not have been distrusted on this occasion. But that\r\nill-fated colony had formerly been bold in their enmities against the\r\nHouse of Stuart, and were now devoted to ruin, by that unseen hand\r\nwhich governs the momentous affairs of this great empire. On the\r\npartial representations of a few worthless ministerial dependants, whose\r\nconstant office it has been to keep that government embroiled, and who,\r\nby their treacheries, hope to obtain the dignity of British knighthood,\r\nwithout calling for a party accused, without asking a proof, without\r\nattempting a distinction between the guilty and the innocent, the whole\r\nof that ancient and wealthy town, is in a moment reduced from opulence\r\nto beggary. Men who had spent their lives in extending the British\r\ncommerce, who had invested in that place, the wealth their honest\r\nendeavors had merited, found themselves and their families, thrown at\r\nonce on the world, for subsistence by its charities. Not the hundredth\r\npart of the inhabitants of that town had been concerned in the act\r\ncomplained of; many of them were in Great Britain, and in other parts\r\nbeyond sea; yet all were involved in one indiscriminate ruin, by a new\r\nexecutive power, unheard of till then, that of a British Parliament.\r\nA property of the value of many millions of money was sacrificed\r\nto revenge, not to repay, the loss of a few thousands. This is\r\nadministering justice with a heavy hand indeed! And when is this tempest\r\nto be arrested in its course? Two wharves are to be opened again when\r\nhis Majesty shall think proper: the residue which lined the extensive\r\nshores of the bay of Boston, are for ever interdicted the exercise of\r\ncommerce. This little exception seems to have been thrown in for no\r\nother purpose, than that of setting a precedent for investing his\r\nMajesty with legislative powers. If the pulse of his people shall beat\r\ncalmly under this experiment, another and another will be tried, till\r\nthe measure of despotism be filled up. It would be an insult on common\r\nsense, to pretend that this exception was made in order to restore its\r\ncommerce to that great town. The trade which cannot be received at two\r\nwharves alone, must of necessity be transferred to some other place; to\r\nwhich it will soon be followed by that of the two wharves. Considered\r\nin this light, it would be an insolent and cruel mockery at the\r\nannihilation of the town of Boston. By the act for the suppression of\r\nriots and tumults in the town of Boston, [14 G.3.] passed also in\r\nthe last session of Parliament, a murder committed there, is, if the\r\nGovernor pleases, to be tried in the court of King’s Bench, in the\r\nisland of Great Britain, by a jury of Middlesex. The witnesses, too, on\r\nreceipt of such a sum as the Governor shall think it reasonable for them\r\nto expend, are to enter into recognisance to appear at the trial. This\r\nis, in other words, taxing them to the amount of their recognisance; and\r\nthat amount may be whatever a Governor pleases. For who does his Majesty\r\nthink can be prevailed on to cross the Atlantic, for the sole purpose\r\nof bearing evidence to a fact? His expenses are to be borne, indeed, as\r\nthey shall be estimated by a Governor; but who are to feed the wife and\r\nchildren whom he leaves behind, and who have had no other subsistence\r\nbut his daily labor? Those epidemical disorders, too, so terrible in a\r\nforeign climate, is the cure of them to be estimated among the articles\r\nof expense, and their danger to be warded off by the almighty power of a\r\nParliament? And the wretched criminal, if he happen to have offended on\r\nthe American side, stripped of his privilege of trial by peers of his\r\nvicinage, removed from the place where alone full evidence could be\r\nobtained, without money, without counsel, without friends, without\r\nexculpatory proof, is tried before Judges predetermined to condemn. The\r\ncowards who would suffer a countryman to be torn from the bowelss of\r\ntheir society, in order to be thus offered a sacrifice to Parliamentary\r\ntyranny, would merit that everlasting infamy now fixed on the authors\r\nof the act! A clause, for a similar purpose, had been introduced into an\r\nact passed in the twelfth year of his Majesty’s reign, entitled, “an\r\nact for the better securing and preserving his Majesty’s dock-yards,\r\nmagazines, ships, ammunition, and stores;” against which, as meriting\r\nthe same censures, the several colonies have already protested.\r\n\r\n‘That these are the acts of power, assumed by a body of men foreign to\r\nour constitutions, and unacknowledged by our laws; against which we do,\r\non behalf of the inhabitants of British America, enter this our solemn\r\nand determined protest. And we do earnestly entreat his Majesty, as\r\nyet the only mediatory power between the several states of the British\r\nempire, to recommend to his Parliament of Great Britain, the total\r\nrevocation of these acts, which, however nugatory they be, may yet prove\r\nthe cause of further discontents and jealousies among us.\r\n\r\n‘That we next proceed to consider the conduct of his Majesty, as holding\r\nthe Executive powers of the laws of these states, and mark out his\r\ndeviations from the line of duty. By the constitution of Great Britain,\r\nas well as of the several American States, his Majesty possesses the\r\npower of refusing to pass into a law, any bill which has already passed\r\nthe other two branches of the legislature. His Majesty, however, and his\r\nancestors, conscious of the impropriety of opposing their single\r\nopinion to the united wisdom of two Houses of Parliament, while their\r\nproceedings were unbiased by interested principles, for several ages\r\npast, have modestly declined the exercise of this power, in that part of\r\nhis empire called Great Britain. But, by change of circumstances, other\r\nprinciples than those of justice simply, have obtained an influence on\r\ntheir determinations. The addition of new states to the British empire,\r\nhas produced an addition of new, and sometimes, opposite interests.\r\nIt is now, therefore, the great office of his Majesty, to resume the\r\nexercise of his negative power, and to prevent the passage of laws by\r\nany one legislature of the empire, which might bear injuriously on the\r\nrights and interests of another. Yet this will not excuse the wanton\r\nexercise of this power, which we have seen his Majesty practise on the\r\nlaws of the American legislatures. For the most trifling reasons, and\r\nsometimes for no conceivable reason at all, his Majesty has rejected\r\nlaws of the most salutary tendency. The abolition of domestic slavery is\r\nthe great object of desire in those colonies, where it was, unhappily,\r\nintroduced in their infant state. But previous to the enfranchisement of\r\nthe slaves we have, it is necessary to exclude all further importations\r\nfrom Africa. Yet our repeated attempts to effect this, by prohibitions,\r\nand by imposing duties which might amount to a prohibition, have\r\nbeen hitherto defeated by his Majesty’s negative: thus preferring the\r\nimmediate advantages of a few British corsairs to the lasting interests\r\nof the American States, and to the rights of human nature, deeply\r\nwounded by this infamous practice. Nay, the single interposition of an\r\ninterested individual against a law, was scarcely ever known to fail\r\nof success, though in the opposite scale were placed the interests of\r\na whole country. That this is so shameful an abuse of a power, trusted\r\nwith his Majesty for other purposes, as if, not reformed, would call for\r\nsome legal restrictions.\r\n\r\n‘With equal inattention to the necessities of his people here, has\r\nhis Majesty permitted our laws to lie neglected in England for years,\r\nneither confirming them by his assent, nor annulling them by his\r\nnegative: so that such of them as have no suspending clause, we hold on\r\nthe most precarious of all tenures, his Majesty’s will; and such of them\r\nas suspend themselves till his Majesty’s assent be obtained, we have\r\nfeared might be called into existence at some future and distant\r\nperiod, when time and change of circumstances shall have rendered them\r\ndestructive to his people here. And, to render this grievance still more\r\noppressive, his Majesty, by his instructions, has laid his Governors\r\nunder such restrictions, that they can pass no law of any moment, unless\r\nit have such suspending clause: so that, however immediate may be the\r\ncall for legislative interposition, the law cannot be executed till it\r\nhas twice crossed the Atlantic, by which time the evil may have spent\r\nits whole force.\r\n\r\n‘But in what terms reconcilable to Majesty, and,at the same time to\r\ntruth, shall we speak of a late instruction to his Majesty’s Governor\r\nof the colony of Virginia, by which he is forbidden to assent to any law\r\nfor the division of a county, unless the new county will consent to\r\nhave no representative in Assembly? That colony has as yet affixed no\r\nboundary to the westward. Their Western counties, therefore, are of\r\nindefinite extent. Some of them are actually seated many hundred miles\r\nfrom their Eastern limits. Is it possible, then that his Majesty can\r\nhave bestowed a single thought on the situation of those people, who, in\r\norder to obtain justice for injuries, however great or small, must, by\r\nthe laws of that colony, attend their county court at such a distance,\r\nwith all their witnesses, monthly, till their litigation be determined?\r\nOr does his Majesty seriously wish, and publish it to the world, that\r\nhis subjects should give up the glorious right of representation, with\r\nall the benefits derived from that, and submit themselves to be absolute\r\nslaves of his sovereign will? Or is it rather meant to confine the\r\nlegislative body to their present numbers, that they may be the cheaper\r\nbargain, whenever they shall become worth a purchase?\r\n\r\n‘One of the articles of impeachment against Tresilian and the other\r\nJudges of Westminster Hall, in the reign of Richard the Second, for\r\nwhich they suffered death, as traitors to their country, was, that they\r\nhad advised the King that he might dissolve his Parliament at any time:\r\nand succeeding Kings have adopted the opinion of these unjust Judges.\r\nSince the establishment, however, of the British constitution, at the\r\nglorious Revolution, on its free and ancient principles, neither his\r\nMajesty nor his ancestors have exercised such a power of dissolution in\r\nthe island of Great Britain;* and, when his Majesty was petitioned by\r\nthe united voice of his people there to dissolve the present Parliament,\r\nwho had become obnoxious to them, his Ministers were heard to declare,\r\nin open Parliament, that his Majesty possessed no such power by the\r\nconstitution. But how different their language, and his practice, here!\r\nTo declare, as their duty required, the known rights of their country,\r\nto oppose the usurpation of every foreign judicature, to disregard\r\nthe imperious mandates of a Minister or Governor, have been the avowed\r\ncauses of dissolving Houses of Representatives in America. But if such\r\npowers be really vested in his Majesty, can he suppose they are\r\nthere placed to awe the members from such purposes as these? When the\r\nrepresentative body have lost the confidence of their constituents, when\r\nthey have notoriously made sale of their most valuable rights, when they\r\nhave assumed to themselves powers which the people never put into their\r\nhands, then, indeed, their continuing in office becomes dangerous to the\r\nstate, and calls for an exercise of the power of dissolution. Such being\r\nthe causes for which the representative body should, and should not, be\r\ndissolved, will it not appear strange, to an unbiassed observer, that\r\nthat of Great Britain was not dissolved, while those of the colonies\r\nhave repeatedly incurred that sentence?\r\n\r\n     * On further inquiry, I find two instances of dissolutions\r\n     before the Parliament would, of itself, have been at an end:\r\n     viz. the Parliament called to meet August 24, 1698, was\r\n     dissolved by King William, December 19, 1700, and a new one\r\n     called, to meet February 6, 1701, which was also dissolved\r\n     November 11, 1701, and a new one met December 30, 1701.\r\n\r\nBut your Majesty or your Governors have carried this power beyond every\r\nlimit known or provided for by the laws. After dissolving one House of\r\nRepresentatives, they have refused to call another, so that, for a great\r\nlength of time, the legislature provided by the laws has been out of\r\nexistence. From the nature of things, every society must at all times\r\npossess within itself the sovereign powers of legislation. The feelings\r\nof human nature revolt against the supposition of a state so situated,\r\nas that it may not, in any emergency, provide against dangers which\r\nperhaps threaten immediate ruin. While those bodies are in existence\r\nto whom the people have delegated the powers of legislation, they alone\r\npossess, and may exercise, those powers. But when they are dissolved, by\r\nthe lopping off one or more of their branches, the power reverts to the\r\npeople, who may use it to unlimited extent, either assembling together\r\nin person, sending deputies, or in any other way they may think proper.\r\nWe forbear to trace consequences further; the dangers are conspicuous\r\nwith which this practice is replete.\r\n\r\n‘That we shall, at this time also, take notice of an error in the nature\r\nof our land-holdings, which crept in at a very early period of our\r\nsettlement. The introduction of the feudal tenures into the kingdom of\r\nEngland, though ancient, is well enough understood to set this matter\r\nin a proper light. In the earlier ages of the Saxon settlement, feudal\r\nholdings were certainly altogether unknown, and very few, if any, had\r\nbeen introduced at the time of the Norman conquest. Our Saxon ancestors\r\nheld their lands, as they did their personal property, in absolute\r\ndominion, disencumbered with any superior, answering nearly to the\r\nnature of those possessions which the Feudalists term Allodial. William\r\nthe Norman first introduced that system generally. The lands which\r\nhad belonged to those who fell in the battle of Hastings, and in the\r\nsubsequent insurrections of his reign, formed a considerable proportion\r\nof the lands of the whole kingdom. These he granted out, subject\r\nto feudal duties, as did he also those of a great number of his new\r\nsubjects, who, by persuasions or threats, were induced to surrender\r\nthem for that purpose. But still much was left in the hands of his Saxon\r\nsubjects, held of no superior, and not subject to feudal conditions.\r\nThese, therefore, by express laws, enacted to render uniform the system\r\nof military defence, were made liable to the same military duties as if\r\nthey had been feuds: and the Norman lawyers soon found means to saddle\r\nthem, also, with all the other feudal burthens. But still they had not\r\nbeen surrendered to the King, they were not derived from his grant, and\r\ntherefore they were not holden of him. A general principle, indeed, was\r\nintroduced, that “all lands in England were held either mediately or\r\nimmediately of the Crown:” but this was borrowed from those holdings\r\nwhich were truly feudal, and only applied to others for the purposes of\r\nillustration. Feudal holdings were, therefore, but exceptions out of the\r\nSaxon laws of possession, under which all lands were held in absolute\r\nright. These, therefore, still form the basis or groundwork of the\r\ncommon law, to prevail wheresoever the exceptions have not taken\r\nplace. America was not conquered by William the Norman, nor its lands\r\nsurrendered to him or any of his successors. Possessions there are,\r\nundoubtedly, of the Allodial nature. Our ancestors, however, who\r\nmigrated hither, were laborers, not lawyers. The fictitious principle,\r\nthat all lands belong originally to the King, they were early persuaded\r\nto believe real, and accordingly took grants of their own lands from\r\nthe Crown. And while the Crown continued to grant for small sums and on\r\nreasonable rents, there was no inducement to arrest the error, and\r\nlay it open to public view. But his Majesty has lately taken on him to\r\nadvance the terms of purchase and of holding to the double of what they\r\nwere; by which means the acquisition of lands being rendered difficult,\r\nthe population of our country is likely to be checked. It is time,\r\ntherefore, for us to lay this matter before his Majesty, and to declare\r\nthat he has no right to grant lands of himself. From the nature and\r\npurpose of civil institutions, all the lands within the limits which any\r\nparticular society has circumscribed around itself, are assumed by that\r\nsociety, and subject to their allotment; this may be done by themselves\r\nassembled collectively, or by their legislature, to whom they may have\r\ndelegated sovereign authority: and, if they are allotted in neither of\r\nthese ways, each individual of the society may appropriate to himself\r\nsuch lands as he finds vacant, and occupancy will give him title.\r\n\r\n‘That, in order to enforce the arbitrary measures before complained of,\r\nhis Majesty has, from time to time, sent among us large bodies of armed\r\nforces, not made up of the people here, nor raised by the authority of\r\nour laws. Did his Majesty possess such a right as this, it might swallow\r\nup all our other rights whenever he should think proper. But his Majesty\r\nhas no right to land a single armed man on our shores; and those whom he\r\nsends here are liable to our laws for the suppression and punishment of\r\nriots, routs, and unlawful assemblies, or are hostile bodies invading\r\nus in defiance of law. When, in the course of the late war, it became\r\nexpedient that a body of Hanoverian troops should be brought over\r\nfor the defence of Great Britain, his Majesty’s grandfather, our late\r\nsovereign, did not pretend to introduce them under any authority he\r\npossessed. Such a measure would have given just alarm to his subjects of\r\nGreat Britain, whose liberties would not be safe if armed men of another\r\ncountry, and of another spirit, might be brought into the realm at any\r\ntime, without the consent, of their legislature. He, therefore, applied\r\nto Parliament, who passed an act for that purpose, limiting the number\r\nto be brought in, and the time they were to continue. In like manner is\r\nhis Majesty restrained in every part of the empire. He possesses indeed\r\nthe executive power of the laws in every state; but they are the laws of\r\nthe particular state, which he is to administer within that state, and\r\nnot those of any one within the limits of another. Every state must\r\njudge for itself, the number of armed men which they may safely trust\r\namong them, of whom they are to consist, and under what restrictions\r\nthey are to be laid. To render these proceedings still more criminal\r\nagainst our laws, instead of subjecting the military to the civil power,\r\nhis Majesty has expressly made the civil subordinate to the military.\r\nBut can his Majesty thus put down all law under his feet? Can he erect\r\na power superior to that which erected himself? He has done it indeed by\r\nforce; but let him remember that force cannot give right.\r\n\r\n‘That these are our grievances, which we have thus laid before his\r\nMajesty, with that freedom of language and sentiment which becomes a\r\nfree people, claiming their rights as derived from the laws of nature,\r\nand not as the gift of their Chief Magistrate. Let those flatter, who\r\nfear: it is not an American art. To give praise where it is not due,\r\nmight be well from the venal, but would ill beseem those who are\r\nasserting the rights of human nature. They know, and will, therefore,\r\nsay, that Kings are the servants, not the proprietors of the people.\r\nOpen your breast, Sire, to liberal and expanded thought. Let not the\r\nname of George the Third be a blot on the page of history. You are\r\nsurrounded by British counsellors, but remember that they are parties.\r\nYou have no ministers for American affairs, because you have none taken\r\nfrom among us, nor amenable to the laws on which they are to give you\r\nadvice. It behoves you, therefore, to think and to act for yourself\r\nand your people. The great principles of right and wrong are legible to\r\nevery reader: to pursue them, requires not the aid of many counsellors.\r\nThe whole art of government consists in the art of being honest. Only\r\naim to do your duty, and mankind will give you credit where you fail. No\r\nlonger persevere in sacrificing the rights of one part of the empire,\r\nto the inordinate desires of another: but deal out to all, equal and\r\nimpartial right. Let no act be passed by any one legislature, which may\r\ninfringe on the rights and liberties of another. This is the important\r\npost in which fortune has placed you, holding the balance of a great, if\r\na well poised empire. This, Sire, is the advice of your great American\r\ncouncil, on the observance of which may, perhaps, depend your felicity\r\nand future fame, and the preservation of that harmony which alone can\r\ncontinue, both to Great Britain and America, the reciprocal advantages\r\nof their connection. It is neither our wish nor our interest to separate\r\nfrom her. We are willing, on our part, to sacrifice every thing which\r\nreason can ask, to the restoration of that tranquillity for which all\r\nmust wish. On their part, let them be ready to establish union on a\r\ngenerous plan. Let them name their terms, but let them be just. Accept\r\nof every commercial preference it is in our power to give, for such\r\nthings as we can raise for their use, or they make for ours. But let\r\nthem not think to exclude us from going to other markets, to dispose of\r\nthose commodities which they cannot use, nor to supply those wants which\r\nthey cannot supply. Still less, let it be proposed, that our properties,\r\nwithin our own territories, shall be taxed or regulated by any power\r\non earth, but our own. The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the\r\nsame time: the hand of force may destroy, but cannot disjoin them.\r\nThis, Sire, is our last, our determined resolution. And that you will\r\nbe pleased to interpose, with that efficacy which your earnest endeavors\r\nmay insure, to procure redress of these our great grievances, to quiet\r\nthe minds of your subjects in British America against any apprehensions\r\nof future encroachment, to establish fraternal love and harmony through\r\nthe whole empire, and that that may continue to the latest ages of time,\r\nis the fervent prayer of all British America,’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE D.]--August, 1774., Instructions for the Deputies\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions for the Deputies appointed to meet in General Congress on\r\nthe Part of this Colony.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy disputes between Great Britain and her American colonies,\r\nwhich began about the third year of the reign of his present Majesty,\r\nand since, continually increasing, have proceeded to lengths so\r\ndangerous and alarming, as to excite just apprehensions in the minds of\r\nhis Majesty’s faithful subjects of this colony, that they are in\r\ndanger of being deprived of their natural, ancient, constitutional, and\r\nchartered rights, have compelled them to take the same into their most\r\nserious consideration; and, being deprived of their usual and accustomed\r\nmode of making known their grievances, have appointed us their\r\nrepresentatives, to consider what is proper to be done in this dangerous\r\ncrisis of American affairs. It being our opinion that the united wisdom\r\nof North America should be collected in a general congress of all the\r\ncolonies, we have appointed the Honorable Peyton Randolph, Richard Henry\r\nLee, George Washington, Patrick Henry, Richard Bland, Benjamin Harrison,\r\nand Edmund Pendleton, Esquires, deputies to represent this colony in\r\nthe said Congress, to be held at Philadelphia, on the first Monday in\r\nSeptember next.\r\n\r\nAnd that they may be the better informed of our sentiments, touching the\r\nconduct we wish them to observe on this important occasion, we\r\ndesire that they will express, in the first place, our faith and\r\ntrue allegiance to his Majesty, King George the Third, our lawful and\r\nrightful sovereign; and that we are determined, with our lives and\r\nfortunes, to support him in the legal exercise of all his just rights\r\nand prerogatives. And, however misrepresented, we sincerely approve of a\r\nconstitutional connection with Great Britain, and wish, most ardently, a\r\nreturn of that intercourse of affection and commercial connection, that\r\nformerly united both countries, which can only be effected by a removal\r\nof those causes of discontent, which have of late unhappily divided us.\r\n\r\nIt cannot admit of a doubt, but that British subjects in America are\r\nentitled to the same rights and privileges, as their fellow subjects\r\npossess in Britain; and therefore, that the power assumed by the British\r\nParliament, to bind America by their statutes, in all cases whatsoever,\r\nis unconstitutional, and the source of these unhappy differences.\r\n\r\nThe end of government would be defeated by the British Parliament\r\nexercising a power over the lives, the property, and the liberty of\r\nAmerican subjects; who are not, and, from their local circumstances,\r\ncannot be, there represented. Of this nature, we consider the several\r\nacts of Parliament, for raising a revenue in America, for extending the\r\njurisdiction of the courts of Admiralty, for seizing American subjects,\r\nand transporting them to Britain, to be tried for crimes committed in\r\nAmerica, and the several late oppressive acts respecting the town of\r\nBoston and Province of the Massachusetts Bay.\r\n\r\nThe original constitution of the American colonies possessing their\r\nassemblies with the sole right of directing their internal polity, it\r\nis absolutely destructive of the end of their institution, that their\r\nlegislatures should be suspended, or prevented, by hasty dissolutions,\r\nfrom exercising their legislative powers.\r\n\r\nWanting the protection of Britain, we have long acquiesced in their\r\nacts of navigation, restrictive of our commerce, which we consider as\r\nan ample recompense for such protection; but as those acts derive their\r\nefficacy from that foundation alone, we have reason to expect they will\r\nbe restrained, so as to produce the reasonable purposes of Britain, and\r\nnot injurious to us.\r\n\r\nTo obtain redress of these grievances, without which the people of\r\nAmerica can neither be safe, free, nor happy, they are willing to\r\nundergo the great inconvenience that will be derived to them, from\r\nstopping all imports whatsoever, from Great Britain, after the first day\r\nof November next, and also to cease exporting any commodity whatsoever,\r\nto the same place, after the tenth day of August, 1775. The earnest\r\ndesire we have to make as quick and full payment as possible of our\r\ndebts to Great Britain, and to avoid the heavy injury that would arise\r\nto this country from an earlier adoption of the non-exportation plan,\r\nafter the people have already applied so much of their labor to the\r\nperfecting of the present crop, by which means they have been prevented\r\nfrom pursuing other methods of clothing and supporting their families,\r\nhave rendered it necessary to restrain you in this article of\r\nnon-exportation; but it is our desire, that you cordially co-operate\r\nwith our sister colonies in General Congress, in such other just and\r\nproper methods as they, or the majority, shall deem necessary for the\r\naccomplishment of these valuable ends.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation issued by General Gage, in the government of the\r\nProvince of the Massachusetts Bay, declaring it treason for the\r\ninhabitants of that province to assemble themselves to consider of\r\ntheir grievances, and form associations for their common conduct on the\r\noccasion, and requiring the civil magistrates and officers to apprehend\r\nall such persons, to be tried for their supposed offences, is the most\r\nalarming process that ever appeared in a British government; that the\r\nsaid General Gage hath, thereby, assumed, and taken upon himself, powers\r\ndenied by the constitution to our legal sovereign; that he, not having\r\ncondescended to disclose by what authority he exercises such extensive\r\nand unheard-of powers, we are at a loss to determine, whether he\r\nintends to justify himself as the representative of the King, or as the\r\nCommander in Chief of his Majesty’s forces in America. If he considers\r\nhimself as acting in the character of his Majesty’s representative, we\r\nwould remind him that the statute 25 Edward the Third has expressed\r\nand defined all treasonable offences, and that the legislature of Great\r\nBritain hath declared, that no offence shall be construed to be treason,\r\nbut such as is pointed out by that statute, and that this was done\r\nto take out of the hands of tyrannical Kings, and of weak and wicked\r\nMinisters, that deadly weapon, which constructive treason had furnished\r\nthem with, and which had drawn the blood of the best and honestest men\r\nin the kingdom; and that the King of Great Britain hath no right by\r\nhis proclamation to subject his people to imprisonment, pains, and\r\npenalties.\r\n\r\nThat if the said General Gage conceives he is empowered to act in this\r\nmanner, as the Commander in Chief of his Majesty’s forces in America,\r\nthis odious and illegal proclamation must be considered as a plain and\r\nfull declaration, that this despotic Viceroy will be bound by no law,\r\nnor regard the constitutional rights of his Majesty’s subjects, whenever\r\nthey interfere with the plan he has formed for oppressing the good\r\npeople of the Massachusetts Bay; and, therefore, that the executing, or\r\nattempting to execute, such proclamation, will justify resistance and\r\nreprisal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE E.]--Monticello, November 1, 1778.--[Re: Crimes and Punishment]\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have got through the bill ‘for proportioning crimes and punishments in\r\ncases heretofore capital,’ and now enclose it to you with a request that\r\nyou will be so good, as scrupulously to examine and correct it, that it\r\nmay be presented to our committee, with as few defects as possible.\r\nIn its style, I have aimed at accuracy, brevity, and simplicity,\r\npreserving, however, the very words of the established law, wherever\r\ntheir meaning had been sanctioned by judicial decisions, or rendered\r\ntechnical by usage. The same matter, if couched in the modern statutory\r\nlanguage, with all its tautologies, redundancies, and circumlocutions,\r\nwould have spread itself over many pages, and been unintelligible to\r\nthose whom it most concerns. Indeed, I wished to exhibit a sample of\r\nreformation in the barbarous style, into which modern statutes have\r\ndegenerated from their ancient simplicity. And I must pray you to be as\r\nwatchful over what I have not said, as what is said; for the omissions\r\nof this bill have all their positive meaning. I have thought it better\r\nto drop, in silence, the laws we mean to discontinue, and let them be\r\nswept away by the general negative words of this, than to detail them\r\nin clauses of express repeal. By the side of the text I have written the\r\nnote? I made, as I went along, for the benefit of my own memory. They\r\nmay serve to draw your attention to questions, to which the expressions\r\nor the omissions of the text may give rise. The extracts from the\r\nAnglo-Saxon laws, the sources of the Common law, I wrote in their\r\noriginal, for my own satisfaction;* but I have added Latin, or liberal\r\nEnglish translations. From the time of Canute to that of the Magna\r\nCharta, you know, the text of our statutes is preserved to us in Latin\r\nonly, and some old French.\r\n\r\n     * In this publication, the original Saxon words are given,\r\n     but, owing to the want of Saxon letter, they are printed in\r\n     common type.\r\n\r\nI have strictly observed the scale of punishments settled by the\r\nCommittee, without being entirely satisfied with it. The _Lex talionis_,\r\nalthough a restitution of the Common law, to the simplicity of which we\r\nhave generally found it so advantageous to return, will be revolting to\r\nthe humanized feelings of modern times. An eye for an eye, and a hand\r\nfor a hand, will exhibit spectacles in execution, whose moral effect\r\nwould be questionable; and even the _membrum pro membro_ of Bracton, or\r\nthe punishment of the offending member, although long authorized by our\r\nlaw, for the same offence in a slave, has, you know, been not long\r\nsince repealed, in conformity with public sentiment. This needs\r\nreconsideration.\r\n\r\nI have heard little of the proceedings of the Assembly, and do not\r\nexpect to be with you till about the close of the month. In the mean\r\ntime, present me respectfully to Mrs. Wythe, and accept assurances\r\nof the affectionate esteem and respect of, Dear Sir, Your friend and\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nGeorge Wythe, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill For Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, page121]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill For Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, page122]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill For Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, page123]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill For Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, page124]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill For Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, page125]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill For Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, page126]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill For Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, page127]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill For Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, page128]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill For Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, page129]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill For Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, page130]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill For Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, page131]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill For Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, page132]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill For Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, page133]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill For Proportioning Crimes and Punishments, page134]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bill for proportioning Crimes and Punishments, in Cases heretofore\r\nCapital_.\r\n\r\nWhereas, it frequently happens that wicked and dissolute men, resigning\r\nthemselves to the dominion of inordinate passions, commit violations on\r\nthe lives, liberties, and property of others, and, the secure enjoyment\r\nof these having principally induced men to enter into society,\r\ngovernment would be defective in its principal purpose, were it not to\r\nrestrain such criminal acts, by inflicting due punishments on those who\r\nperpetrate them; but it appears, at the same time, equally deducible\r\nfrom the purposes of society, that a member thereof, committing\r\nan inferior injury, does not wholly forfeit the protection of his\r\nfellow-citizens, but, after suffering a punishment in proportion to his\r\noffence, is entitled to their protection from all greater pain, so that\r\nit becomes a duty in the legislature to arrange, in a proper scale,\r\nthe crimes which it may be necessary for them to repress, and to adjust\r\nthereto a corresponding gradation of punishments.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, the reformation of offenders, though an object worthy the\r\nattention of the laws, is not effected at all by capital punishments,\r\nwhich exterminate, instead of reforming, and should be the last\r\nmelancholy resource against those whose existence is become inconsistent\r\nwith the safety of their fellow-citizens, which also weaken the State,\r\nby cutting off so many who, if reformed, might be restored sound members\r\nto society, who, even under a course of correction, might be rendered\r\nuseful in various labors for the public, and would be living and long\r\ncontinued spectacles to deter others from committing the like offences.\r\n\r\nAnd forasmuch as the experience of all ages and countries hath shown,\r\nthat cruel and sanguinary laws defeat their own purpose, by engaging the\r\nbenevolence of mankind to withhold prosecutions, to smother testimony,\r\nor to listen to it with bias, when, if the punishment were only\r\nproportioned to the injury, men would feel it their inclination, as well\r\nas their duty, to see the laws observed.\r\n\r\nFor rendering crimes and punishments, therefore, more proportionate to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nBe it enacted by the General Assembly, that no crime shall be henceforth\r\npunished by deprivation of life or limb,* except those hereinafter\r\nordained to be so punished.\r\n\r\n     * This takes away the punishment of cutting off the hand of\r\n     a person striking another, or drawing his sword in one of\r\n     the superior courts of justice.

The convictions of\r\n     treason of that kind in England, have been under that branch\r\n     of the statute which makes the compassing the king’s death\r\n     treason. Foster, 196, 197. But as we omit that branch, we\r\n     must by other means reach this flagrant case.\r\n\r\n\r\n     **** The stat. 25 E. 3. directs all other cases of treason\r\n     to await the opinion of Parliament. This has the effect of\r\n     negative words, excluding all other treasons. As we drop\r\n     that part of the statute, we must, by negative words,\r\n     prevent an inundation of common law treasons. I strike out\r\n     the word ‘it,’ therefore, and insert ‘the said cases and no\r\n     others.’ Quaere, how far those negative words may affect the\r\n     case of accomplices above mentioned? Though if their case\r\n     was within the statute, so as that it needed not await the\r\n     opinion of Parliament, it should seem to be also within our\r\n     act, so as not to be ousted by the negative words.\r\n\r\n     ***** This implies ‘by the neck.’ See 2 Hawk. 444, notes _n.o._\r\n\r\nIf any person commit petty treason, or a husband murder his wife, a\r\nparent his child,* or a child his parent, he shall suffer death by\r\nhanging, and his body be delivered to anatomists to be dissected.\r\n\r\n     * By the stat. 21.Tac. 1. c. 27. and Act Ass. 1710, c. 12.\r\n     concealment by the mother of the death of a bastard child is\r\n     made murder. In justification of this, it is said, that\r\n     shame is a feeling which operates so strongly on the mind,\r\n     as frequently to induce the mother of such a child to murder\r\n     it, in order to conceal her disgrace. The act of\r\n     concealment, therefore, proves she was influenced by shame,\r\n     and that influence produces a presumption that she murdered\r\n     the child. The effect of this law, then, is, to make what,\r\n     in its nature, is only presumptive evidence of a murder,\r\n     conclusive of that fact. To this I answer, 1. So many\r\n     children die before, or soon after birth, that to presume\r\n     all those murdered who are found dead, is a presumption\r\n     which will lead us oftener wrong than right, and\r\n     consequently would shed more blood than it would save. 2. If\r\n     the child were born dead, the mother would naturally choose\r\n     rather to conceal it, in hopes of still keeping a good\r\n     character in the neighborhood. So that the act of\r\n     concealment is far from proving the guilt of murder on the\r\n     mother. 3. If shame be a powerful affection of the mind, is\r\n     not parental love also? Is it not the strongest affection\r\n     known? Is it not greater than even that of self-\r\n     preservation? While we draw presumptions from shame, one\r\n     affection of the mind, against the life of the prisoner,\r\n     should we not give some weight to presumptions from parental\r\n     love, an affection at least as strong in favor of life? If\r\n     concealment of the fact is a presumptive evidence of murder,\r\n     so strong as to overbalance all other evidence that may\r\n     possibly be produced to take away the presumption, why not\r\n     trust the force of this incontestable presumption to the\r\n     jury, who are, in a regular course, to hear presumptive, as\r\n     well as positive testimony? If the presumption, arising from\r\n     the act of concealment, may be destroyed by proof positive\r\n     or circumstantial to the contrary, why should the\r\n     legislature preclude that contrary proof? Objection. The\r\n     crime is difficult to prove, being usually committed in\r\n     secret. Answer. But circumstantial proof will do; for\r\n     example, marks of violence, the behavior, countenance, &c.\r\n     of the prisoner, &c. And if conclusive proof be difficult to\r\n     be obtained, shall we therefore fasten irremovably upon\r\n     equivocal proof? Can we change the nature of what is\r\n     contestable, and make it incontestable? Can we make that\r\n     conclusive which God and nature have made inconclusive?\r\n     Solon made no law against, parricide, supposing it\r\n     impossible any one could be guilty of it; and the Persians,\r\n     from the same opinion, adjudged all who killed their reputed\r\n     parents to be bastards: and although parental, be yet\r\n     stronger than filial affection, we admit saticide proved on\r\n     the most equivocal testimony, whilst they rejected all proof\r\n     of an act, certainly not more repugnant to nature, as of a\r\n     thing impossible, improvable. See Beccaria, § 31.\r\n\r\nWhosoever committeth murder by poisoning, shall suffer death by poison.\r\n\r\nWhosoever committeth murder by way of duel, shall suffer death by\r\nhanging; and if he were the challenger, his body, after death, shall\r\nbe gibbeted.* He who removeth it from the gibbet, shall be guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanor; and the officer shall see that it be replaced.\r\n\r\n     * 25 G. 2. c. 37.\r\n\r\nWhosoever shall commit murder in any other way, shall suffer death by\r\nhanging.\r\n\r\nAnd in all cases of petty treason and murder, one half of the lands\r\nand goods of the offender shall be forfeited to the next of kin to\r\nthe person killed, and the other half descend and go to his own\r\nrepresentatives. Save only, where one shall slay the challenger in a\r\nduel,* in which case, no part of his lands or goods shall be forfeited\r\nto the kindred of the party slain, but, instead thereof, a moiety shall\r\ngo to the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n     * Quære, if the estates of both parties in a duel should not\r\n     be forfeited? The deceased is equally guilty with a suicide.\r\n\r\nThe same evidence* shall suffice, and order and course** of trial be\r\nobserved in cases of petty treason, as in those of other*** murders.\r\n\r\n     * Quære, if these words may not be omitted?

The second offence\r\nshall be deemed murder.\r\n\r\n     * Manslaughter is punishable at law, by burning in the hand,\r\n     and forfeiture of chattels.\r\n\r\n     ** It is best, in this act, to lay down principles only, in\r\n     order that it may not for ever be undergoing change: and, to\r\n     carry into effect the minuter parts of it; frame a bill ‘for\r\n     the employment and government of felons, or male-factors,\r\n     condemned to labor for the Commonwealth,’ which may serve as\r\n     an Appendix to this, and in which all the particulars\r\n     requisite may be directed: and as experience will, from time\r\n     to time, be pointing out amendments, these may be made\r\n     without touching this fundamental act. See More’s Utopia pa.\r\n     50, for some good hints. Fugitives might, in such a bill, be\r\n     obliged to work two days for every one they absent\r\n     themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd where persons, meaning to commit a trespass* only, or larceny, or\r\nother unlawful deed, and doing an act from which involuntary homicide\r\nhath ensued, have heretofore been adjudged guilty of manslaughter, or\r\nof murder, by transferring such their unlawful intention to an act much\r\nmore penal than they could have in probable contemplation; no such\r\ncase shall hereafter be deemed manslaughter, unless manslaughter was\r\nintended, nor murder, unless murder was intended.\r\n\r\n     * The shooting at a wild fowl, and killing a man, is\r\n     homicide by misadventure. Shooting at a pullet, without any\r\n     design to take it away, is manslaughter; and with a design\r\n     to take it away, is murder. 6 Sta. tr. 222. To shoot at the\r\n     poultry of another, and thereby set fire to his house, is\r\n     arson, in the opinion of some. Dalt. c. 116 1 Hale’s P. C.\r\n     569, contra.\r\n\r\nIn other cases of homicide, the law will not add to the miseries of the\r\nparty, by punishments or forfeitures.*\r\n\r\n     * Beccaria, § 32. Suicide. Homicides are, 1. Justifiable. 2.\r\n     Excusable. 3. Felonious. For the last, punishments have been\r\n     already provided. The first are held to be totally without\r\n     guilt, or rather commendable. The second are, in some cases,\r\n     not quite unblamable. These should subject the party to\r\n     marks of contrition; viz. the killing of a man in defence of\r\n     property; so also in defence of one’s person, which is a\r\n     species of excusable homicide; because, although cases may\r\n     happen where these also are commendable, yet most frequently\r\n     they are done on too slight appearance of danger; as in\r\n     return for a blow, kick, fillip, &c; or on a person’s\r\n     getting into a house, not _anirno furandi_, but perhaps\r\n     _veneris causa_, &c. Bracton says, ‘_Si quis furem noctupnum\r\n     occiderit, ita demum impune foret, si parcere ei sine\r\n     periculo suo non potuit; si autem potuit, aliter erit.’\r\n     ‘Item erit si quis hamsokne qua; dicitur invasio domus\r\n     contra pacem domini regis in domo sua se defenderit, et\r\n     invasor occisus fuerit; impersecutus et inultus ramanebit,\r\n     si ille quem invasit aliter se defendere non potuit; dicitur\r\n     enim quod non est dignus habere pacem qui non vult observare\r\n     earn.’ L.3. c.23. § 3. ‘Qui latronetn Occident, non tenetur,\r\n     nocturnum vel diurnnm, si aliter periculum evadere non\r\n     possit; tenetur ta-men, si possit. Item non tenetur si per\r\n     inforlunium, et non anitno et voluntate occidendi, nee\r\n     dolus, nec culpa ejus inveniatur_.’ L.3. c.36. § 1. The stat.\r\n     24 H. 8. c. 5 is therefore merely declaratory of the Common\r\n     law. See on the general subject, Puffend. 2. 5. § 10, 11,\r\n     12, 16, 17. Excusable homicides are by misadventure, or in\r\n     self-defence. It is the opinion of some lawyers, that the\r\n     Common law punished these with death, and that the statute\r\n     of Marlbridge, c. 26. and Gloucester, c. 9. first took away\r\n     this by giving them title to a pardon, as matter of right,\r\n     and a writ of restitution of their goods. See 2 Inst, 148.\r\n     315; 3 Inst. 55. Bracton, L. 3. c. 4. § 2. Fleta L, 1. c.\r\n     23. § 14, 15; 21 E. 3. 23. But it is believed never to have\r\n     been capital. 1 H. P. C. 425; 1 Hawk. 75; Foster, 282; 4 Bl.\r\n     188. It seems doubtful also, whether at Common law, the\r\n     party forfeited all his chattels in this case, or only paid\r\n     a weregild. Foster, _ubi supra_, doubts, and thinks it of no\r\n     consequence, as the statute of Gloucester entitles the party\r\n     to Royal grace, which goes as well to forfeiture as life. To\r\n     me, there seems no reason for calling these excusable\r\n     homicides, and the killing a man in defence of property, a\r\n     justifiable homicide. The latter is less guiltless than\r\n     misadventure or self defence.\r\n\r\n     Suicide is by law punishable by forfeiture of chattels. This\r\n     bill exempts it from forfeiture. The suicide injures the\r\n     state less than he who leaves it with his effects. If the\r\n     latter then be not punished, the former should not. As to\r\n     the example, we need not fear its influence. Men are too\r\n     much attached to life, to exhibit frequent instances of\r\n     depriving themselves of it. At any rate, the quasi-\r\n     punishment of confiscation will not prevent it. For if one\r\n     be found who can calmly determine to renounce life, who is\r\n     so weary of his existence here, as rather to make experiment\r\n     of what is beyond the grave, can we suppose him, in such a\r\n     state of mind, susceptible of influence from the losses to\r\n     his family by confiscation? That men in general, too,\r\n     disapprove of this severity, is apparent from the constant\r\n     practice of juries finding the suicide in a state of\r\n     insanity; because they have no other way of saving the\r\n     forfeiture. Let it then be done away.\r\n\r\nWhenever sentence of death shall have been pronounced against any person\r\nfor treason or murder, execution shall be done on the next day but\r\none after such sentence, unless it be Sunday, and then on the Monday\r\nfollowing.*\r\n\r\n     * Beccaria, § 19; 25 G. 2. c. 37.\r\n\r\nWhosoever shall be guilty of Rape,* Polygamy,** or Sodomy,*** with man\r\nor woman, shall be punished, if a man, by castration,**** if a woman,\r\nby cutting through the cartilage of her nose, a hole of one half inch in\r\ndiameter at the least.\r\n\r\n     * 13 E. 1. c. 34.

Bracton L.3. 28. § 1. says, the\r\n     punishment of rape is ‘_amissio membrorum, ut sit membrumpro\r\n     membra, quia virgo, cum corrumpitur, membrum amittit, et\r\n     ideo corruptor puniatur in eo in quo deliquit; oculos igitur\r\n     amittat propter aspectum decoris quo virginem concupivit;\r\n     amittat et testiculos qui calorem stupri induxerunt.

With mankind, 2.\r\n     with beasts. Buggery is the genus, of which Sodomy and\r\n     Bestiality are the species. 12 Co. 37. says, In Dyer, 304. a\r\n     man was indicted, and found guilty of a rape on a girl of\r\n     seven years old. The court doubted of the rape of so tender\r\n     a girl; but if she had been nine years old, it would have\r\n     been otherwise.’ 14 Eliz. Therefore the statute 18 Eliz. c.\r\n     6, says, ‘For plain declaration of law, be it enacted, that\r\n     if any person shall unlawfully and carnally know and abuse\r\n     any woman child, under the age of ten years, &c. he shall\r\n     suffer as a felon, without allowance of clergy.’ Lord Hale,\r\n     however, 1 P. C. 630. thinks it rape independent of that\r\n     statute, to know carnally a girl under twelve, the age of\r\n     consent. Yet, 4 Bl. 212. seems to neglect this opinion; and\r\n     as it was founded on the words of 3 E. 1. c. 13. and this is\r\n     with us omitted, the offence of carnally knowing a girl\r\n     under twelve, or ten years of age, will not be distinguished\r\n     from that of any other. Co. 37. says ‘note that Sodomy is\r\n     with mankind.’ But Finch’s L. B. 3. c. 24. ‘Sodomitry is a\r\n     carnal copulation against nature, to wit, of man or woman in\r\n     the same sex, or of either of them with beasts.’ 12 Co 36.\r\n     says, ‘It appears by the ancient authorities of the law\r\n     that this was felony.’ Yet the 25 H. 8. declares it felony,\r\n     as if supposed not to be so. Britton, c, 9. says, that\r\n     Sodomites are to be burnt. F. N. B. 269. b. Fleta, L 1. c.\r\n     37. says, ‘Pecorantes et Sodomise in terra, vivi\r\n     confodiantur.’ The Mirror makes it treason. Bestiality can\r\n     never make any progress; it cannot therefore be injurious to\r\n     society in any great degree, which is the true measure of\r\n     criminality _in foro cirili_, and will ever be properly and\r\n     severely punished, by universal derision. It may, therefore,\r\n     be omitted. It was anciently punished with death, as it has\r\n     been latterly. LI Ælfrid. 31. and 25 H. 8. c. 6. see\r\n     Beccaria, § 31. Montesq.\r\n\r\n     ****Bracton, Fleta, &c.\r\n\r\nBut no one shall be punished for Polygamy, who shall have married after\r\nprobable information of the death of his or her husband or wife, or\r\nafter his or her husband or wife hath absented him or herself, so that\r\nno notice of his or her being alive hath reached such person for seven\r\nyears together, or hath suffered the punishments before prescribed for\r\nrape, polygamy, or sodomy.\r\n\r\nWhosoever, on purpose, and of malice forethought, shall maim* another,\r\nor shall disfigure him by cutting out or disabling the tongue, slitting\r\nor cutting off a nose, lip, or ear, branding, or otherwise, shall be\r\nmaimed, or disfigured in like** sort: or if that cannot be for want of\r\nthe same part, then as nearly as may be, in some other part of at least\r\nequal value and estimation, in the opinion of a jury, and moreover,\r\nshall forfeit one half of his lands and goods to the sufferer.\r\n\r\n     * 22 &l 23 Car. 2, c. 1.

I do not find\r\n     any of these definitions confine the offence to wilful and\r\n     malicious perpetrations of it. 22&23 Car. 2. c. 1, called\r\n     the Coventry act, has the words ‘on purpose and of malice\r\n     forethought.’ or does the Common law-prescribe the same\r\n     punishment for disfiguring, as for maiming.\r\n\r\n     ** The punishment was by retaliation. ‘Et come ascun appele\r\n     serra de tele felonie atteint et attende jugement, si soit\r\n     le jugement tiel que il perde autriel membre come il avera\r\n     toilet al pleintyre.

Burglary and House-\r\n     breaking were called ‘Hamsockne.’ ‘Diximus etiam de pacis\r\n     violatione et de immunitatibus domus, si quis hoc in\r\n     posterum fecetit ut perdat ornne quod habet, et sit in regis\r\n     arbitro utrum vitam habeat.’ ‘Eac we quasdon be mundbryce\r\n     and be ham socnum,sethe hit ofer this do tha:t he dolie\r\n     enlles thces the age, and sy on Cyninges Jome hwsether be\r\n     life age: and we quoth of mound-breach, and of home-seeking\r\n     he who it after this do, that he dole all that he owe\r\n     [owns], and is in kings doom whether he life owes [owns].’\r\n     LI. Eadmundi, c. 6 and see LI. Cnuti. 61. ‘bus btec,’ in\r\n     notesion Arson, ante. A Burglar was also called a Burgessor.\r\n     ‘Et soit enquis de Burgessours et sunt tenus Burgessours\r\n     trestous ceux que felonisement en temps de pees debrusornt\r\n     esglises ou auter mesons, ou murs ou portes de nos cytes, ou\r\n     de nos Burghes.’ Britt. c. 10. ‘Burglaria est nocturna\r\n     diruptio habitaculi alicujus, vel ecclesise, etiam murorum,\r\n     portarurnve civitatis aut burgi, ad feloniam aliquam\r\n     perpetrandam.

It may be committed in the outset houses, as well\r\n     as inset, 3 Inst. 65. though not under the same roof or\r\n     contiguous, provided they be within the Curtilage or Home-\r\n     stall. 4 BI. 225. As by the Common law all felonies were\r\n     clergiable, the stat. 23 H. 8. c. 1; 5 E. 6. c. 9. and 18\r\n     El. c. 7. first distinguished tfiem, by taking the clerical\r\n     privilege of impunity from the principals, and 3 & 4 W. M.\r\n     c. 9. from accessories before the fact. No statute defines\r\n     what Burglary is. The 12 Ann. c. 7. decides the doubt\r\n     whether, where breaking is subsequent to entry, it is\r\n     Burglary. Bacon’s Elements had affirmed, and T. H. P. C.\r\n     554. had denied it. Our bill must distinguish them by\r\n     different degrees of punishment.\r\n\r\nWhatsoever act, if committed in the night time, shall constitute\r\nthe crime of Burglary, shall, if committed in the day, be deemed\r\nHouse-breaking;* and whosoever is guilty thereof, shall be condemned to\r\nhard labor three years in the public works, and shall make reparation to\r\nthe persons injured.\r\n\r\n     * At the Common law, the offence of House-breaking was not\r\n     distinguished from Burglary, and neither of them from any\r\n     other larceny. The statutes at first took away clergy from\r\n     Burglary, which made a leading distinction between the two\r\n     offences. Later statutes, however, have taken clergy from so\r\n     many cases of House-breaking, as nearly to bring the\r\n     offences together again. These are 23 H. 8. c. 1; 1 E. 6. c.\r\n     12; 5 k 6 E. 6. c. 9; 3 & 4 W. M. c. 9; 39 El. c. 15; 10&11\r\n     W. 3. c.23; 12 Ann. c. 7. See Burr. 428; 4 Bl. 240. The\r\n     circumstances, which in these statutes characterize the\r\n     offence, seem to have been occasional and unsystematical.\r\n     The houses on which Burglary may be committed, and the\r\n     circumstances which constitute that crime, being\r\n     ascertained, it will be better to define House-breoking by\r\n     the same subjects and circumstances, and let the crimes be\r\n     distinguished only by the hour at which they are committed,\r\n     and the degree of punishment.\r\n\r\nWhosoever shall be guilty of Horse-stealing,* shall be condemned to hard\r\nlabor three years in the public works, and shall make reparation to the\r\nperson injured.\r\n\r\n     * The offence of Horse-stealing seems properly\r\n     distinguishable from other larcenies, here, where these\r\n     animals generally run at large, the temptation being so\r\n     great and frequent, and the facility of commission so\r\n     remarkable. See 1 E. 6. c. 12; 23 E. 6. c. 33; 31 El. c. 12.\r\n\r\nGrand Larceny* shall be where the goods stolen are of the value of five\r\ndollars; and whosoever shall be guilty thereof, shall be forthwith put\r\nin the pillory for one half hour, shall be condemned to hard labor**\r\ntwo years in the public works, and shall make reparation to the person\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\n     * The distinction between grand and petty larceny is very\r\n     ancient. At first 8d. was the sum which constituted grand\r\n     larceny. LI. Ælhelst. c. 1. ‘Ne parcatur ulli furi, qui\r\n     furtum manutenens captus sit, supra 12 annos nafo, et supra\r\n     8 denarios.’ Afterwards, in the same king’s reign, it was\r\n     raised to 12d. ‘Non parcaturalicui furi ultra 12 denarios,\r\n     et ultra 12 annos nato--ut occide-mus ilium et capiamus omne\r\n     quod possidet, et inprimis sumamus rei furto ablatse pretium\r\n     ab hserede, ac dividatur postea reliquum in duas partes, una\r\n     pars uxori, si munda, et facinoris conscia non sit; et\r\n     residuum in duo, dimi-dium capiat rex, dimidium societas.’\r\n     LI. Æthelst. Wilkins, p. 65. VOL. I. 17\r\n\r\n     ** LI. Inse, c. 7. ‘Si quis furetur ita ut uxor ejus et\r\n     infans ipsius nesciani, solvat 60. solidos pcenae loco. Si\r\n     autem furetur testantibus omuibus haere-dibus suis, abeant\r\n     omnes in servilutem.’ Ina was King of the West Saxons, and\r\n     began to reign A. C. 688. After the union of the Heptarchy,\r\n     i. e. temp. Æthelst. inter 924 and 940, we find it\r\n     punishable with death as above. So it was inter 1017 and\r\n     1035, i. e. temp. Cnuti. LI. Cnuti 61. cited in notes on\r\n     Arson. In the time of William the Conqueror, it seems lo\r\n     have been made punishable by fine only. LI. Gul. Cohq. apud\r\n     Wilk. p. 218. 220. This commutation, however, was taken away\r\n     by LI. H. 1. anno 1108. ‘Si quis in furto vel latro-cinio\r\n     deprehensus fuisset, suspenderetur: sublata wirgildorum, id\r\n     est, pecu-niarse redemptions lege.’ Larceny is the felonious\r\n     taking and carrying away of the personal goods of another.\r\n     1. As to the taking, the 3 & 4 VV. M. c. 9. § 5, is not\r\n     additional to the Common law, but declaratory of it; because\r\n     where only the care or use, and not the possession, of\r\n     things is delivered, to take them was larceny at the Common\r\n     law. The 33 H. 6. c. 1 and 21 11. 8. c. 7., indeed., have\r\n     added to the Common law by making it larceny in a servant to\r\n     convert things of his master’s. But quære, if they should be\r\n     imitated more than as to other breaches of trust in general.\r\n     2. As to the subject of larceny, 4 G. 2. c.32; 6 G. 3. c. 36\r\n     48; 43 El. c. 7; 15 Car. 2. c. 2; 23 G. 2 c. 26; 31 G. 2. c.\r\n     35; 9 G. 3. c. 41; 25 G. 2. c. 10. have extended larceny to\r\n     things of various sorts, either real, or fixed to the\r\n     realty. But the enumeration is unsystematical, and in this\r\n     country, where the produce of the earth is so spontaneous as\r\n     to have rendered things of this kind scarcely a breach of\r\n     civility or good manners in the eyes of the people, quære,\r\n     if it would not too much enlarge the field of Criminal law?\r\n     The same may be questioned of 9 G. J. c. 22; 13 Car. 2. c.\r\n     10; 10 G. 2. c. 32; 5 G. 3. c. 14; 22 h 23 Car. 2. c. 25; 37\r\n     E. 3. c. 19. making it felony to steal animals ferte\r\n     natures.\r\n\r\nPetty Larceny shall be, where the goods stolen are of less value than\r\nfive dollars; and whosoever shall be guilty thereof, shall be forthwith\r\nput in the pillory for a quarter of an hour, shall be condemned to hard\r\nlabor one year in the public works, and shall make reparation to the\r\nperson injured.\r\n\r\nRobbery* or larceny of bonds, bills obligatory, bills of exchange, or\r\npromissory notes for the payment of money or tobacco, lottery tickets,\r\npaper bills issued in the nature of money, or of certificates of loan on\r\nthe credit of this Commonwealth, or of all or any of the United States\r\nof America, or Inspectors’ notes for tobacco, shall be punished in the\r\nsame manner as robbery,or larceny of the money or tobacco due on or\r\n     represented by such papers.* 2 G. 2. c. 25 §3; 7 G 3. c. 50.\r\n\r\nBuyers* and receivers of goods taken by way of robbery or larceny,\r\nknowing them to have been so taken, shall be deemed accessaries to such\r\nrobbery or larceny after the fact.\r\n\r\n     * 3 &. 4 W. & M. c. 9. § 4; 5 Ann. c. 31. § 5; 4 G. 1. c.\r\n     11. § 1.\r\n\r\nPrison breakers,* also, shall be deemed accessaries after the fact, to\r\ntraitors or felons whom they enlarge from prison.**\r\n\r\n     * 1 E. 2.\r\n\r\n     ** Breach of prison at the Common law was capital, without\r\n     regard to the crime for which the party was committed. ‘Cum\r\n     pro criminis qualitate in carcerem recepti fuerint,\r\n     conspiraverint (ut ruptis vinculis aut fracto carcere)\r\n     evadant, atnplius (quam causa pro qua recepti sunt exposuit)\r\n     puniendi sunt, videlicet ultimo supplicio, quamvis ex eo\r\n     crimine innocentes inveniantur, propter quod inducti sunt in\r\n     carcerem et imparcati.’ Bracton L. 3, c. 9. § 4. Britt. c.\r\n     11. Fleta, L. 1. c. 26. § 4. Yet in the Y. B. Hill. 1 H. 7.\r\n     2. Hussey says, that, by the opinion of Billing and Choke,\r\n     and all the Justices, it was a felony in strangers only, but\r\n     not in the prisoner himself. S. C. Fitz. Abr. Co-ron. 48.\r\n     They are principal felons, not accessaries, ib. Whether it\r\n     was felony in the prisoner at Common law, is doubted. Stam.\r\n     P. C. 30. b. The Mirror c. 5. § 1. says, ‘Abusion est a\r\n     tener escape de prisoner, ou de bruserie del gaole pur peche\r\n     mortal 1, car eel usage nest garrant per nul ley, ne in nul\r\n     part est use forsque in cest realme, et en France, ems\r\n     [mais] est leu garrantie de ceo faire per la ley de nature’\r\n     2 Inst. 589. The stat. 1 E. 2, ‘de fragentibus priso-nam,’\r\n     ‘restrained the judgment of life and limb for prison-\r\n     breaking, to cases where the offence of the prisoner\r\n     required such judgment.’\r\n\r\n     It is not only vain but wicked, in a legislator to frame\r\n     laws in opposition to the laws of nature, and to arm them\r\n     with the terrors of death. This is truly creating crimes in\r\n     order to punish them. The law of nature impels every one to\r\n     escape from confinement; it should not, therefore, be\r\n     subjected to punishment. Let the legislator restrain his\r\n     criminal by walls, not by parchment. As to strangers\r\n     breaking prison to enlarge an offender, they should, and may\r\n     be fairly considered as accessaries after the fact. This\r\n     bill saying nothing of the prisoner releasing himself by\r\n     breach of jail, he will have the benefit of the first\r\n     section of the bill, which repeals the judgment of life and\r\n     death at the Common law.\r\n\r\nAll attempts to delude the people, or to abuse their understanding by\r\nexercise of the pretended arts of witchcraft, conjuration, enchantment,\r\nor sorcery, or by pretended prophecies, shall be punished by ducking and\r\nwhipping, at the discretion of a jury, not, exceeding fifteen stripes.*\r\n\r\n     * ‘Gifwiecan owwe wigleras mansworan, owwe morthwyrhtan owwe\r\n     fule afylede eebere horcwenan ahwhar on lande wurthan\r\n     agytene, thonne fyrsie man of earde, and claensie lha.\r\n     theode, owwe on earde forfare hi mid ealle, buton hi\r\n     geswican and the deoper gebetan:’ ‘if witches, or weirds,\r\n     man-swearers, or murther-wroughters, or foul, defiled, open\r\n     whore-queens, ay--where in the land were gotten, then force\r\n     them off earth, and cleanse the nation, or in earth forth-\r\n     fare them withal, buton they beseech, and deeply better.’\r\n     LI.

It extended to no case\r\n     where the judgment was not of life or limb. Note in 2. H. P.\r\n     C. 326. This, therefore, excluded it in trespass, petty\r\n     larceny, or killing _se defendendo_. In high treason against\r\n     the person of the King, it seems not to have been allowed.\r\n     Note 1 H. P. C. 185. Treasons, therefore, not against the\r\n     King’s person immediately, petty treasons and felonies, seem\r\n     to have been the cases where it was allowed; and even of\r\n     those, not for _insidiatio viarum, depopulatio agrorum, or\r\n     combustio domorum_. The statute de Clero, 25 E. 3. st. 3. c.\r\n     4. settled the law on this head. 2. As to the persons, it\r\n     extended to all clerks, always, and toties quoiies. 2 H. P.\r\n     C. 374.

That it be of _convenient_ size to be applied as a measure to the\r\ncommon money transactions of life.\r\n\r\nII. That its parts and multiplies be in an _easy proportion_ to each\r\nother, so as to facilitate the money arithmetic;\r\n\r\nIII. That the Unit and its parts, or divisions, be _so nearly of the\r\nvalue of some of the known coins_, as that they may be of easy adoption\r\nfor the people.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Dollar seems to fulfil all these conditions.\r\n\r\nI. Taking into our view all money transactions, great and small, I\r\nquestion if a common measure of more _convenient size_ than the Dollar\r\ncould be proposed. The value of 100, 1000, 10,000 dollars is well\r\nestimated by the mind; so is that of the tenth or the hundredth of a\r\ndollar. Few transactions are above or below these limits. The expediency\r\nof attending to the size of the Money Unit will be evident to any one\r\nwho will consider how inconvenient it would be to a manufacturer or\r\nmerchant, if instead of the yard for measuring cloth, either the inch or\r\nthe mile had been made the Unit of Measure.\r\n\r\nII. The most _easy ratio_ of multiplication and division is that by ten.\r\nEvery one knows the facility of Decimal Arithmetic. Every one remembers,\r\nthat, when learning Money-Arithmetic, he used to be puzzled with adding\r\nthe farthings, taking out the fours and carrying them on; adding\r\nthe pence, taking out the twelves and carrying them on; adding the\r\nshillings, taking out the twenties and carrying them on; but when he\r\ncame to the pounds, where he had only tens to carry forward, it was easy\r\nand free from error. The bulk of mankind are school-boys through\r\nlife. These little perplexities are always great to them. And even\r\nmathematical heads feel the relief of an easier, substituted for a more\r\ndifficult process. Foreigners, too, who trade or travel among us, will\r\nfind a great facility in understanding our coins and accounts from this\r\nratio of subdivision. Those who have had occasion to convert the Livres,\r\nsols, and deniers of the French; the Gilders, stivers, and frenings of\r\nthe Dutch; the Pounds, shillings, pence, and farthings of these several\r\nStates, into each other, can judge how much they would have been aided,\r\nhad their several subdivisions been in a decimal ratio. Certainly, in\r\nall cases, where we are free to choose between easy and difficult modes\r\nof operation, it is most rational to choose the easy. The Financier,\r\ntherefore, in his report, well proposes that our Coins should be in\r\ndecimal proportions to one another. If we adopt the Dollar for our Unit,\r\nwe should strike four coins, one of gold, two of silver, and one of\r\ncopper, viz.\r\n\r\n1. A golden piece, equal in value to ten dollars:\r\n\r\n2. The Unit or Dollar itself, of silver:\r\n\r\n3. The tenth of a Dollar, of silver also:\r\n\r\n4. The hundreth of a Dollar, of copper.\r\n\r\nCompare the arithmetical operations, on the same sum of money expressed\r\nin this form, and expressed in the pound sterling and its divisions.\r\n\r\nA bare inspection of the above operations, will evince the labor which\r\nis occasioned by subdividing the Unit into 20ths, 240ths, and 960ths,\r\nas the English do, and as we have done; and the ease of subdivision in\r\na decimal ratio. The same difference arises in making payment. An\r\nEnglishman, to pay £8 13s. 11d. 1/2qrs. must find, by calculation,\r\nwhat combination of the coins of his country will pay this sum; but an\r\nAmerican, having the same sum to pay, thus expressed $38.65, will know,\r\nby inspection only, that three golden pieces, eight units or dollars,\r\nsix tenths, and five coppers, pay it precisely.\r\n\r\nIII. The third condition required is, that the Unit, its multiples, and\r\nsubdivisions, coincide in value with some of the known coins so nearly,\r\nthat the people may, by a quick reference in the mind, estimate their\r\nvalue. If this be not attended to, they will be very long in adopting\r\nthe innovation, if ever they adopt it. Let us examine, in this point of\r\nview, each of the four coins proposed.\r\n\r\n1. The golden piece will be 1/5 more than a half joe and 1/15 more than\r\na double guinea. It will be readily estimated, then, by reference to\r\neither of them; but more readily and accurately as equal to ten dollars.\r\n\r\n2. The Unit, or Dollar, is a known coin, and the most familiar of all to\r\nthe minds of the people. It is already adopted from South to North; has\r\nidentified our currency, and therefore happily offers itself as a\r\nUnit already introduced. Our public debt, our requisitions, and their\r\napportionments, have given it actual and long possession of the place of\r\nUnit. The course of our commerce, too, will bring us more of this than\r\nof any other foreign coin, and therefore renders it more worthy of\r\nattention. I know of no Unit which can be proposed in competition with\r\nthe Dollar, but the Pound. But what is the Pound? 1547 grains of fine\r\nsilver in Georgia; 1289 grains in Virginia, Connecticut, Rhode Island,\r\nMassachusetts, and New Hampshire; 1031 grains in Maryland, Delaware,\r\nPennsylvania, and New Jersey; 966 grains in North Carolina and New York.\r\nWhich of these shall we adopt? To which State give that pre-eminence of\r\nwhich all are so jealous? And on which impose the difficulties of a new\r\nestimate of their corn, their cattle, and other commodities? Or shall we\r\nhang the pound sterling, as a common badge, about all their necks? This\r\ncontains 1718 grains of pure silver. It is difficult to familiarize a\r\nnew coin to the people; it is more difficult to familiarize them to a\r\nnew coin with an old name. Happily, the Dollar is familiar to them all,\r\nand is already as much referred to for a measure of value, as their\r\nrespective provincial pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The tenth will be precisely the Spanish bit, or half pistereen. This\r\nis a coin perfectly familiar to us all. When we shall make a new coin,\r\nthen, equal in value to this, it will be of ready estimate with the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n4. The hundredth, or copper, will differ little from the copper of the\r\nfour Eastern States, which is 1/108 of a dollar; still less from the\r\npenny of New York and North Carolina, which is 1/96 of a dollar;\r\nand somewhat more from the penny or copper of Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, and Maryland, which is 1/90 of a dollar. It will be about the\r\nmedium between the old and the new coppers of these States, and will\r\ntherefore soon be substituted for them both. In Virginia, coppers have\r\nnever been in use. It will be as easy, therefore, to introduce them\r\nthere of one value as of another. The copper coin proposed, will be\r\nnearly equal to three fourths of their penny, which is the same with the\r\npenny lawful of the Eastern States.\r\n\r\nA great deal of small change is useful in a State, and tends to reduce\r\nthe price of small articles. Perhaps it would not be amiss to coin\r\nthree, more pieces of silver, one of the value of five tenths, or half\r\na dollar, one of the value of two tenths, which would be equal to the\r\nSpanish pistereen, and one of the value of five coppers, which would be\r\nequal to the Spanish half-bit. We should then have five silver coins,\r\nviz.\r\n\r\n1. The Unit or Dollar:\r\n\r\n2. The half dollar or five tenths:\r\n\r\n3. The double tenth, equal to 2/10, or one fifth of a dollar, or to the\r\npistereen:\r\n\r\n4. The tenth, equal to a Spanish bit:\r\n\r\n5. The five copper piece, equal to 5/100 or one twentieth of a dollar,\r\nor the half-bit.\r\n\r\nThe plan reported by the Financier is worthy of his sound judgment. It\r\nadmits, however, of objection, in the size of the Unit. He proposes that\r\nthis shall be the 1440th part of a dollar; so that it will require 1440\r\nof his units to make the one before proposed. He was led to adopt this\r\nby a mathematical attention to our old currencies, all of which this\r\nUnit will measure without leaving a fraction. But as our object is to\r\nget rid of those currencies, the advantage derived from this coincidence\r\nwill soon be past, whereas the inconveniences of this Unit will for\r\never remain, if they do not altogether prevent its introduction. It\r\nis defective in two of the three requisites of a Money Unit. 1. It is\r\ninconvenient in its application to the ordinary money transactions.\r\n10,000 dollars will require eight figures to express them, to wit,\r\n14,400,000 units. A horse or bullock of eighty dollars’ value, will\r\nrequire a notation of six figures, to wit, 115,200 units. As a money\r\nof account, this will be laborious, even when facilitated by the aid\r\nof decimal arithmetic: as a common measure of the value of property,\r\nit will be too minute to be comprehended by the people. The French are\r\nsubjected to very laborious calculations, the Livre being their ordinary\r\nmoney of account, and this but between 1/5 and 1/6 of a dollar; but what\r\nwill be our labors, should our money of account be 1/1440 of a dollar\r\nonly? 2. It is neither equal, nor near to any of the known coins in\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIf we determine that a Dollar shall be our Unit, we must then say with\r\nprecision what a Dollar is. This coin, struck at different times,\r\nof different weights and fineness, is of different values. Sir Isaac\r\nNewton’s assay and representation to the Lords of the Treasury, in 1717,\r\nof those which he examined, make their values as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir Isaac Newton’s Assay, page137]\r\n\r\n     The Seville piece of eight . . . . 387     grains of pure silver\r\n     The Mexico piece of eight  . . . . 385 1/2       ”\r\n      The Pillar piece of eight  . . . . 385 3/4       ”\r\n      The new Seville piece of eight . . 308 7/10      ”\r\n\r\nThe Financier states the old Dollar as containing 376 grains of fine\r\nsilver, and the new 365 grains. If the Dollars circulating among us be\r\nof every date equally, we should examine the quantity of pure metal in\r\neach, and from them form an average for our Unit. This is a work proper\r\nto be committed to mathematicians as well as merchants, and which should\r\nbe decided on actual and accurate experiment.\r\n\r\nThe quantum of alloy is also to be decided. Some is necessary, to\r\nprevent the coin from wearing too fast; too much, fills our pockets with\r\ncopper, instead of silver. The silver coin assayed by Sir Isaac Newton,\r\nvaried from 1 1/2 to 76 pennyweights alloy, in the pound troy of mixed\r\nmetal. The British standard has 18 dwt.; the Spanish coins assayed by\r\nSir Isaac Newton, have from 18 to 19 1/2 dwt.; the new French crown has\r\nin fact 19 1/2, though by edict it should have 20 dwt., that is 1/12.\r\n\r\nThe taste of our countrymen will require, that their furniture plate\r\nshould be as good as the British standard. Taste cannot be controlled\r\nby law. Let it then give the law, in a point which is indifferent to a\r\ncertain degree. Let the Legislatures fix the alloy of furniture plate\r\nat 18 dwt., the British standard, and Congress that of their coin at one\r\nounce in the pound, the French standard. This proportion has been found\r\nconvenient for the alloy of gold coin, and it will simplify the system\r\nof our mint to alloy both metals in the same degree. The coin too, being\r\nthe least pure, will be the less easily melted into plate. These reasons\r\nare light, indeed, and, of course, will only weigh, if no heavier ones\r\ncan be opposed to them.\r\n\r\nThe proportion between the values of gold and silver is a mercantile\r\nproblem altogether. It would be inaccurate to fix it by the popular\r\nexchanges of a half Joe for eight dollars, a Louis for four French\r\ncrowns, or five Louis for twenty-three dollars. The first of these,\r\nwould be to adopt the Spanish proportion between gold and silver;\r\nthe second, the French; the third, a mere popular barter, wherein\r\nconvenience is consulted more than accuracy. The legal proportion in\r\nSpain is 16 for 1; in England, 15 1/2 for 1; in France, 15 for 1.\r\nThe Spaniards and English are found, in experience, to retain an over\r\nproportion of gold coins, and to lose their silver. The French have a\r\ngreater proportion of silver. The difference at market has been on the\r\ndecrease. The Financier states it at present, as at 141/2 for one. Just\r\nprinciples will lead us to disregard legal proportions altogether; to\r\ninquire into the market price of gold, in the several countries with\r\nwhich we shall principally be connected in commerce, and to take an\r\naverage from them. Perhaps we might, with safety, lean to a proportion\r\nsomewhat above par for gold, considering our neighborhood and commerce\r\nwith the sources of the coins, and the tendency which the high price\r\nof gold in Spain has, to draw thither all that of their mines, leaving\r\nsilver principally for our and other markets. It is not impossible that\r\n15 for 1, may be found an eligible proportion. I state it, however, as a\r\nconjecture only.\r\n\r\nAs to the alloy for gold coin, the British is an ounce in the pound; the\r\nFrench, Spanish, and Portuguese differ from that, only from a quarter of\r\na grain, to a grain and a half. I should, therefore, prefer the\r\nBritish, merely because its fraction stands in a more simple form, and\r\nfacilitates the calculations into which it enters.\r\n\r\nShould the Unit be fixed at 365 grains of pure silver, gold at 15 for 1,\r\nand the alloy of both be one twelfth, the weights of the coins will be\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Projected Coin Weights, page138]\r\n\r\nThe quantity of fine silver which shall constitute the Unit,\r\nbeing-settled, and the proportion of the value of gold, to that of\r\nsilver; a table should be formed from the assay before suggested,\r\nclassing the several foreign coins according to their fineness,\r\ndeclaring the worth of a pennyweight or grain in each class, and that\r\nthey shall be lawful tenders at those rates, if not clipped or otherwise\r\ndiminished; and where diminished, offering their value for them at the\r\nmint, deducting the expense of re-coinage. Here the Legislatures should\r\nco-operate with Congress, in providing that no money be received or paid\r\nat their treasuries, or by any of their officers, or any bank, but on\r\nactual weight; in making it criminal, in a high degree, to diminish\r\ntheir own coins, and, in some smaller degree, to offer them in payment\r\nwhen diminished.\r\n\r\nThat this subject may be properly prepared and in readiness for Congress\r\nto take up at their meeting in November, something must now be done. The\r\npresent session drawing to a close, they probably would not choose to\r\nenter far into this undertaking themselves. The Committee of the States,\r\nhowever, during the recess, will have time to digest it thoroughly, if\r\nCongress will fix some general principles for their government. Suppose\r\nthey be instructed,--\r\n\r\nTo appoint proper persons to assay and examine, with the utmost\r\naccuracy practicable, the Spanish milled dollars of different dates in\r\ncirculation with us.\r\n\r\nTo assay and examine, in like manner, the fineness of all the other\r\ncoins which may be found in circulation within these states.\r\n\r\nTo report to the Committee the result of these assays, by them to be\r\nlaid before Congress.\r\n\r\nTo appoint, also, proper persons to inquire what are the proportions\r\nbetween the values of fine gold and fine silver, at the markets of the\r\nseveral countries with which we are, or probably may be, connected in\r\ncommerce; and what would be a proper proportion here, having regard\r\nto the average of their values at those markets, and to other\r\ncircumstances, and to report the same to the Committee, by them to be\r\nlaid before Congress.\r\n\r\nTo prepare an Ordinance for establishing the Unit of Money within these\r\nStates; for subdividing it; and for striking coins of gold, silver, and\r\ncopper, on the following principles.\r\n\r\nThat the Money Unit of these States shall be equal in value to a Spanish\r\nmilled dollar containing so much fine silver as the assay, before\r\ndirected, shall show to be contained, on an average, in dollars of the\r\nseveral dates in circulation with us.\r\n\r\nThat this Unit shall be divided into tenths and hundredths; that there\r\nshall be a coin of silver of the value of a Unit; one other of the same\r\nmetal, of the value of one tenth of a Unit; one other of copper, of the\r\nvalue of the hundredth of a Unit.\r\n\r\nThat there shall be a coin of gold of the value of ten units, according\r\nto the report before directed, and the judgment of the Committee\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\nThat the alloy of the said coins of gold and silver shall be equal in\r\nweight to one eleventh part of the fine metal.\r\n\r\nThat there be proper devices for these coins.\r\n\r\nThat measures be proposed for preventing their diminution, and also\r\ntheir currency, and that of any others, when diminished.\r\n\r\nThat the several foreign coins be described and classed in the said\r\nOrdinance, the fineness of each class stated, and its value by weight\r\nestimated in Units and decimal parts of Units.\r\n\r\nAnd that the said draught of an Ordinance be reported to Congress at\r\ntheir next meeting, for their consideration and determination.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupplementary Explanations.\r\n\r\nThe preceding notes having been submitted to the consideration of the\r\nFinancier, he favored me with his opinion and observations on them,\r\nwhich render necessary the following supplementary explanations.\r\n\r\nI observed in the preceding notes, that the true proportion of value\r\nbetween gold and silver was a mercantile problem altogether, and that,\r\nperhaps, fifteen for one, might be found an eligible proportion. The\r\nFinancier is so good as to inform me, that this would be higher than\r\nthe market would justify. Confident of his better information on this\r\nsubject, I recede from that idea.*\r\n\r\n* In a Newspaper, which frequently gives good details in political\r\neconomy, I find, under the Hamburg head, that the present market\r\nprice of Gold and Silver is, in England, 15.5 for 1: in Russia, 15: in\r\nHolland, 14.75: in Savoy, 14.96: in Fiance, 14.42: in Spain, 14.3: in\r\nGermany, 14.155: the average of which is 14.615 or 14 1/2. I would still\r\nincline to give a little more than the market price for gold, because of\r\nits superior convenience in transportation.\r\n\r\nHe also informs me, that the several coins in circulation among us, have\r\nalready been assayed with accuracy, and the result published in a work\r\non that subject. The assay of Sir Isaac Newton had superseded, in my\r\nmind, the necessity of this operation as to the older coins, which were\r\nthe subject of his examination. This later work, with equal reason, may\r\nbe considered as saving the same trouble as to the latter coins.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, I accede to the opinions of the Financier. On the other\r\nhand, he seems to concur with me, in thinking his smallest fractional\r\ndivision too minute for a Unit, and, therefore, proposes to transfer\r\nthat denomination to his largest silver coin, containing 1000 of the\r\nunits first proposed, and worth about 4s. 2d. lawful, or 25/36 of a\r\ndollar. The only question then remaining between us is, whether the\r\nDollar, or this coin, be best for the Unit. We both agree that the ease\r\nof adoption with the people, is the thing to be aimed at.\r\n\r\n1. As to the Dollar, events have overtaken and superseded the question.\r\nIt is no longer a doubt whether the people can adopt it with ease; they\r\nhave adopted it, and will have to be turned out of that, into another\r\ntrack of calculation, if another Unit be assumed. They have now two\r\nUnits, which they use with equal facility, viz. the Pound of their\r\nrespective state, and the Dollar. The first of these is peculiar to each\r\nstate; the second, happily, common to all. In each state, the people\r\nhave an easy rule for converting the pound of their state into dollars,\r\nor dollars into pounds; and this is enough for them, without knowing how\r\nthis may be done in every state of the Union. Such of them as live near\r\nenough the borders of their state to have dealings with their neighbors,\r\nlearn also the rule of their neighbors: Thus, in Virginia and the\r\nEastern States, where the dollar is 6s. or 3/10 of a pound, to turn\r\npounds into dollars, they multiply by 10, and divide by 3. To turn\r\ndollars into pounds, they multiply by 3, and divide by 10. Those in\r\nVirginia who live near to Carolina, where the dollar is 8s. or 4/10 of\r\na pound, learn the operation of that state, which is a multiplication\r\nby 4, and division by 10, _et e converso_. Those who live near Maryland,\r\nwhere the dollar is 7s. 6d. or 3/8 of a pound, multiply by 3, and divide\r\nby 8, _et e converso_. All these operations are easy, and have been\r\nfound by experience, not too much for the arithmetic of the people,\r\nwhen they have occasion to convert their old Unit into dollars, or the\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\n2. As to the Unit of the Financier; in the States where the dollar is\r\n3/10 of a pound, this Unit will be 5/24. Its conversion into the pound\r\nthen, will be by a multiplication by 5, and a division by 24. In the\r\nStates where the dollar is 3/8 of a pound, this Unit will be 25/96 of\r\na pound, and the operation must be to multiply by 25, and divide by 96,\r\n_et e converso_. Where the dollar is 4/10 of a pound, this Unit will\r\nbe 5/18. The simplicity of the fraction, and of course the facility\r\nof conversion and reconversion, is therefore against this Unit, and in\r\nfavor of the dollar, in every instance. The only advantage it has over\r\nthe dollar, is, that it will in every case express our farthing without\r\na remainder; whereas, though the dollar and its decimals will do this\r\nin many cases, it will not in all. But, even in these, by extending your\r\nnotation one figure farther, to wit, to thousands, you approximate a\r\nperfect accuracy within less than the two thousandth part of a dollar;\r\nan atom in money which every one would neglect. Against this single\r\ninconvenience, the other advantages of the dollar are more than\r\nsufficient to preponderate. This Unit will present to the people a new\r\ncoin, and whether they endeavor to estimate its value by comparing it\r\nwith a Pound, or with a Dollar, the Units they now possess, they will\r\nfind the fraction very compound, and of course less accommodated to\r\ntheir comprehension and habits than the dollar. Indeed the probability\r\nis, that they could never be led to compute in it generally.\r\n\r\nThe Financier supposes that the 1/100 of a dollar is not sufficiently\r\nsmall, where the poor are purchasers or vendors. If it is not, make\r\na smaller coin. But I suspect that it is small enough. Let us examine\r\nfacts, in countries where we are acquainted with them. In Virginia,\r\nwhere our towns are few, small, and of course their demand for\r\nnecessaries very limited, we have never yet been able to introduce a\r\ncopper coin at all. The smallest coin which any body will receive there,\r\nis the half-bit, or 1/20 of a dollar. In those states where the towns\r\nare larger and more populous, a more habitual barter for small wants,\r\nhas called for a copper coin of 1/90 or 1/96 or 1/108 of a dollar.\r\nIn England, where the towns are many and pouplous, and where ages of\r\nexperience have matured the conveniences of intercourse, they have found\r\nthat some wants may be supplied for a farthing, or 1/208 of a dollar,\r\nand they have accommodated a coin to this want. This business is\r\nevidently progressive. In Virginia we are far behind. In some other\r\nstates, they are farther advanced, to wit, to the appreciation of\r\n1/90, 1/96 or 1/108 of a dollar. To this most advanced state, then, I\r\naccommodated my smartest coin in the decimal arrangement, as a money of\r\npayment, corresponding with the money of account. I have no doubt the\r\ntime will come when a smaller coin will be called for. When that comes,\r\nlet it be made. It will probably be the half of the copper I propose,\r\nthat is to say 5/1000 or.005 of a dollar, this being very nearly the\r\nfarthing of England. But it will be time enough to make it, when the\r\npeople shall be ready to receive it.\r\n\r\nMy proposition then, is, that our notation of money shall be decimal,\r\ndescending _ad libitum_ of the person noting; that the Unit of this\r\nnotation shall be a Dollar; that coins shall be accommodated to it from\r\nten dollars to the hundredth of a dollar; and that, to set this on\r\nfoot, the resolutions be adopted which were proposed in the notes, only\r\nsubstituting an inquiry into the fineness of the coins in lieu of an\r\nassay of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE G.]\r\n\r\nI have sometimes asked myself, whether my country is the better for\r\nmy having lived at all. I do not know that it is. I have been the\r\ninstrument of doing the following things; but they would have been done\r\nby others; some of them, perhaps, a little better.\r\n\r\nThe Rivanna had never been used for navigation; scarcely an empty\r\ncanoe had ever passed down it. Soon after I came of age I examined its\r\nobstructions, set on foot a subscription for removing them, got an act\r\nof Assembly passed, and the thing effected, so as to be used completely\r\nand fully for carrying down all our produce.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nI proposed the demolition of the Church establishment, and the freedom\r\nof religion. It could only be done by degrees; to wit, the act of 1776,\r\nc. 2. exempted dissenters from contributions to the Church, and left the\r\nChurch clergy to be supported by voluntary contributions of their own\r\nsect; was continued from year to year, and made perpetual 1779, c. 36. I\r\nprepared the act for religious freedom in 1777, as part of the revisal,\r\nwhich was not reported to the Assembly till 1779, and that particular\r\nlaw not passed till 1785, and then by the efforts of Mr. Madison.\r\n\r\nThe act putting an end to entails.\r\n\r\nThe act prohibiting the importation of slaves.\r\n\r\nThe act concerning citizens, and establishing the natural right of man\r\nto expatriate himself at will.\r\n\r\nThe act changing the course of descents, and giving the inheritance to\r\nall the children, &c. equally, I drew as part of the revisal.\r\n\r\nThe act for apportioning crimes and punishments, part of the same work,\r\nI drew. When proposed to the Legislature by Mr. Madison, in 1785, it\r\nfailed by a single vote. G. K. Taylor afterwards, in 1796, proposed the\r\nsame subject; avoiding the adoption of any part of the diction of mine,\r\nthe text of which had been studiously drawn in the technical terms of\r\nthe law, so as to give no occasion for new questions by new expressions.\r\nWhen I drew mine, public labor was thought the best punishment to be\r\nsubstituted for death. But, while I was in France, I heard of a society\r\nin England who had successfully introduced solitary confinement, and\r\nsaw the drawing of a prison at Lyons, in France, formed on the idea of\r\nsolitary confinement. And, being applied to by the Governor of Virginia\r\nfor the plan of a Capitol and Prison, I sent him the Lyons plan,\r\naccompanying it with a drawing on a smaller scale, better adapted to our\r\nuse. This was in June, 1786. Mr. Taylor very judiciously adopted this\r\nidea, (which had now been acted on in Philadelphia, probably from the\r\nEnglish model,) and substituted labor in confinement, to the public\r\nlabor proposed by the Committee of revisal; which themselves would have\r\ndone, had they been to act on the subject again. The public mind was\r\nripe for this in 1796, when Mr. Taylor proposed it, and ripened chiefly\r\nby the experiment in Philadelphia; whereas, in 1785, when it had been\r\nproposed to our Assembly, they were not quite ripe for it.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 and 1790, I had a great number of olive plants, of the best\r\nkind, sent from Marseilles to Charleston, for South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia. They were planted, and are flourishing; and, though not yet\r\nmultiplied, they will be the germ of that cultivation in those States.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, I got a cask of heavy upland rice, from the river Denbigh, in\r\nAfrica, about lat. 9° 30’ North, which I sent to Charleston, in hopes\r\nit might supersede the culture of the wet rice, which renders South\r\nCarolina and Georgia so pestilential through the summer. It was divided,\r\nand a part sent to Georgia. I know not whether it has been attended to\r\nin South Carolina; but it has spread in the upper parts of Georgia, so\r\nas to have become almost general, and is highly prized. Perhaps it may\r\nanswer in Tennessee and Kentucky. The greatest service which can\r\nbe rendered any country is, to add an useful plant to its culture;\r\nespecially a bread grain; next in value to bread is oil.\r\n\r\nWhether the Act for the more general diffusion of knowledge will ever\r\nbe carried into complete effect, I know not. It was received, by the\r\nlegislature, with great enthusiasm at first; and a small effort was made\r\nin 1796, by the act to establish public schools, to carry a part of it\r\ninto effect, viz. that for the establishment of free English schools;\r\nbut the option given to the courts has defeated the intention of the\r\nAct.*\r\n\r\n     * It appears, from a blank space at the bottom of this\r\n     paper, that a continuation had been intended. Indeed, from\r\n     the loose manner in which the above notes are written, it\r\n     may be inferred that they were originally intended as\r\n     memoranda only, to be used in some more permanent form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE H.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nNew York, October 13, 1789.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of characters to fill the important offices of\r\nGovernment in the United States, I was naturally led to contemplate the\r\ntalents and dispositions which I knew you to possess and entertain for\r\nthe service of your country; and without being able to consult your\r\ninclination, or to derive any knowledge of your intentions from your\r\nletters, either to myself or to any other of your friends, I was\r\ndetermined, as well by motives of private regard, as a conviction of\r\npublic propriety, to nominate you for the Department of State, which,\r\nunder its present organization, involves many of the most interesting\r\nobjects of the Executive authority.\r\n\r\nBut grateful as your acceptance of this commission would be to me, I\r\nam, at the same time, desirous to accommodate your wishes, and I\r\nhave, therefore, forborne to nominate your successor at the court of\r\nVersailles until I should be informed of your determination.\r\n\r\nBeing on the eve of a journey through the Eastern States, with a view\r\nto observe the situation of the country, and in a hope of perfectly\r\nre-establishing my health, which a series of indispositions has much\r\nimpaired, I have deemed it proper to make this communication of your\r\nappointment, in order that you might lose no time, should it be your\r\nwish to visit Virginia during the recess of Congress, which will\r\nprobably be the most convenient season, both as it may respect your\r\nprivate concerns, and the public service.\r\n\r\nUnwilling, as I am, to interfere in the direction of your choice of\r\nassistants, I shall only take the liberty of observing to you, that,\r\nfrom warm recommendations which I have received in behalf of Roger\r\nAlden, Esq., Assistant Secretary to the late Congress, I have placed all\r\nthe papers thereunto belonging under his care. Those papers which more\r\nproperly appertain to the office of Foreign Affairs, are under the\r\nsuperintendence of Mr. Jay, who has been so obliging as to continue his\r\ngood offices, and they are in the immediate charge of Mr. Remsen.\r\n\r\nWith sentiments of very great esteem and regard, I have the honor to be,\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Thomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\nI take the occasion to acknowledge the receipt of your several favors of\r\nthe 4th and 5th of December of the last, and 10th of May of the present\r\nyear, and to thank you for the communications therein. G. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York, November 30, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by the inclosed letter (which was left for you at the\r\noffice of Foreign Affairs when I made a journey to the Eastern States),\r\nthe motives, on which I acted with regard to yourself, and the occasion\r\nof my explaining them at that early period.\r\n\r\nHaving now reason to hope, from Mr. Trumbull’s report, that you will\r\nbe arrived at Norfolk before this time (on which event I would most\r\ncordially congratulate you), and having a safe conveyance by Mr.\r\nGriffin, I forward your commission to Virginia; with a request to\r\nbe made acquainted with your sentiments as soon as you shall find it\r\nconvenient to communicate them to me. With sentiments of very great\r\nesteem and regard,\r\n\r\nI am, dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Thomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER I.--TO DR. WILLIAM SMALL, May 7, 1775\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. WILLIAM SMALL.\r\n\r\nMay 7, 1775.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nWithin this week we have received the unhappy news of an action of\r\nconsiderable magnitude, between the King’s troops and our brethren of\r\nBoston, in which, it is said, five hundred of the former, with the Earl\r\nof Percy, are slain. That such an action has occurred, is undoubted,\r\nthough perhaps the circumstances may not have reached us with truth.\r\nThis accident has cut off our last hope of reconciliation, and a phrenzy\r\nof revenge seems to have seized all ranks of people. It is a lamentable\r\ncircumstance, that the only mediatory power, acknowledged by both\r\nparties, instead of leading to a reconciliation his divided people,\r\nshould pursue the incendiary purpose of still blowing up the flames, as\r\nwe find him constantly doing, in every speech and public declaration.\r\nThis may, perhaps, be intended to intimidate into acquiescence, but the\r\neffect has been most unfortunately otherwise. A little knowledge\r\nof human nature, and attention to its ordinary workings, might have\r\nforeseen that the spirits of the people here were in a state, in which\r\nthey were more likely to be provoked, than frightened, by haughty\r\ndeportment. And to fill up the measure of irritation, a proscription of\r\nindividuals has been substituted in the room of just trial. Can it be\r\nbelieved, that a grateful people will suffer those to be consigned to\r\nexecution, whose sole crime has been the developing and asserting their\r\nrights? Had the Parliament possessed the power of reflection, they would\r\nhave avoided a measure as impotent, as it was inflammatory. When I saw\r\nLord Chatham’s bill, I entertained high hope that a reconciliation could\r\nhave been brought about. The difference between his terms, and those\r\noffered by our Congress, might have been accommodated, if entered on,\r\nby both parties, with a disposition to accommodate. But the dignity of\r\nParliament, it seems, can brook no opposition to its power. Strange,\r\nthat a set of men, who have made sale of their virtue to the minister,\r\nshould yet talk of retaining dignity. But I am getting into politics,\r\nthough I sat down only to ask your acceptance of the wine: and express\r\nmy constant wishes for your happiness.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.--TO JOHN RANDOLPH, August 25,1775\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN RANDOLPH, ESQ.,\r\n\r\nMonticello,\r\n\r\nAugust 25,1775.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am sorry the situation of our country should render it not eligible to\r\nyou to remain longer in it. I hope the returning wisdom of Great Britain\r\nwill, ere long, put an end to this unnatural contest. There may be\r\npeople to whose tempers and dispositions contention is pleasing, and\r\nwho, therefore, wish a continuance of confusion; but to me it is of all\r\nstates but one, the most horrid: My first wish is a restoration of our\r\njust rights; my second, a return of the happy period, when, consistently\r\nwith duty, I may withdraw myself totally from the public stage, and pass\r\nthe rest of my days in domestic ease and tranquillity, banishing every\r\ndesire of ever hearing what passes in the world. Perhaps, (for the\r\nlatter adds considerably to the warmth of the former wish,) looking\r\nwith fondness towards a reconciliation with Great Britain, I cannot help\r\nhoping you may be able to contribute towards expediting this good work.\r\nI think it must be evident to yourself, that the Ministry have been\r\ndeceived by their officers on this side of the water, who (for what\r\npurpose, I cannot tell) have constantly represented the American\r\nopposition as that of a small faction, in which the body of the people\r\ntook little part. This, you can inform them, of your own knowledge, is\r\nuntrue. They have taken it into their heads, too, that we are cowards,\r\nand shall surrender at discretion to an armed force. The past and future\r\noperations of the war must confirm or undeceive them on that head.\r\nI wish they were thoroughly and minutely acquainted with every\r\ncircumstance relative to America, as it exists in truth. I am persuaded,\r\nthis would go far towards disposing them to reconciliation. Even those\r\nin Parliament who are called friends to America, seem to know nothing\r\nof our real determinations. I observe, they pronounced in the last\r\nParliament, that the Congress of 1774 did not mean to insist rigorously\r\non the terms they held out, but kept something in reserve, to give up:\r\nand, in fact, that they would give up every thing but the article of\r\ntaxation. Now, the truth is far from this, as I can affirm, and put\r\nmy honor to the assertion. Their continuance in this error may perhaps\r\nproduce very ill consequences. The Congress stated the lowest terms they\r\nthought possible to be accepted, in order to convince the world they\r\nwere not unreasonable. They gave up the monopoly and regulation of\r\ntrade, and all acts of Parliament prior to 1764, leaving to British\r\ngenerosity to render these, at some future time, as easy to America\r\nas the interest of Britain would admit. But this was before blood was\r\nspilt. I cannot affirm, but have reason to think, these terms would not\r\nnow be accepted. I wish no false sense of honor, no ignorance of our\r\nreal intentions, no vain hope that partial concessions of right will be\r\naccepted, may induce the Ministry to trifle with accommodation, till\r\nit shall be out of their power ever to accommodate. If, indeed, Great\r\nBritain, disjoined from her colonies, be a match for the most potent\r\nnations of Europe, with the colonies thrown into their scale, they\r\nmay go on securely. But if they are not assured of this, it would be\r\ncertainly unwise, by trying the event of another campaign, to risk our\r\naccepting a foreign aid, which perhaps may not be obtainable but on\r\ncondition of everlasting avulsion from Great Britain. This would be\r\nthought a hard condition to those who still wish for reunion with their\r\nparent country. I am sincerely one of those, and would rather be in\r\ndependence on Great Britain, properly limited, than on any nation upon\r\nearth, or than on no nation. But I am one of those, too, who, rather\r\nthan submit to the rights of legislating for us, assumed by the British\r\nParliament, and which late experience has shown they will so cruelly\r\nexercise, would lend my hand to sink the whole island in the ocean.\r\n\r\nIf undeceiving the Minister, as to matters of fact, may change his\r\ndisposition, it will perhaps be in your power, by assisting to do\r\nthis, to render service to the whole empire at the most critical time,\r\ncertainly, that it has ever seen. Whether Britain shall continue the\r\nhead of the greatest empire on earth, or shall return to her original\r\nstation in the political scale of Europe, depends perhaps on the\r\nresolutions of the succeeding winter. God send they may be wise and\r\nsalutary for us all. I shall be glad to hear from you as often as\r\nyou may be disposed to think of things here. You may be at liberty, I\r\nexpect; to communicate some things, consistently with your honor and the\r\nduties you will owe to a protecting nation. Such a communication among\r\nindividuals may be mutually beneficial to the contending parties.\r\nOn this or any future occasion, if I affirm to you any facts, your\r\nknowledge of me will enable you to decide on their credibility; if I\r\nhazard opinions on the dispositions of men or other speculative points,\r\nyou can only know they are my opinions. My best wishes for your felicity\r\nattend you wherever you go; and believe me to be, assuredly,\r\n\r\nYour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.--TO JOHN RANDOLPH, November 29, 1775\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN RANDOLPH, ESQ..\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia,\r\n\r\nNovember 29, 1775.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am to give you the melancholy intelligence of the death of our most\r\nworthy Speaker, which happened here on the 22nd of the last month. He\r\nwas struck with an apoplexy, and expired within five hours.\r\n\r\nI have it in my power to acquaint you that the success of our arms has\r\ncorresponded with the justness of our cause. Chambly and St. Johns were\r\ntaken some weeks ago, and in them the whole regular army in Canada,\r\nexcept about forty or fifty men. This day certain intelligence has\r\nreached us that our General, Montgomery, is received into Montreal: and\r\nwe expect every hour to be informed that Quebec has opened its arms to\r\nColonel Arnold, who, with eleven hundred men, was sent from Boston up\r\nthe Kennebec, and down the Chaudiere river to that place. He expected\r\nto be there early this month. Montreal acceded to us on the 13th, and\r\nCarleton set out, with the shattered remains of his little army, for\r\nQuebec, where we hope he will be taken up by Arnold. In a short time, we\r\nhave reason to hope, the delegates of Canada will join us in Congress,\r\nand complete the American union as far as we wish to have it completed.\r\nWe hear that one of the British transports has arrived at Boston; the\r\nrest are beating off the coast, in very bad weather. You will have\r\nheard, before this reaches you, that Lord Dunmore has commenced\r\nhostilities in Virginia. That people bore with every thing, till he\r\nattempted to burn the town of Hampton. They opposed and repelled him,\r\nwith considerable loss on his side, and none on ours. It has raised our\r\ncountrymen into a perfect phrenzy. It is an immense misfortune to the\r\nwhole empire to have a King of such a disposition at such a time. We are\r\ntold, and every thing proves it true, that he is the bitterest enemy\r\nwe have. His Minister is able, and that satisfies me that ignorance, or\r\nwickedness, somewhere, controls him. In an earlier part of this contest,\r\nour petitions told him, that from our King there was but one appeal.\r\nThe admonition was despised, and that appeal forced on us. To undo his\r\nempire, he has but one truth more to learn; that, after colonies have\r\ndrawn the sword, there is but one step more they can take. That step is\r\nnow pressed upon us by the measures adopted, as if they were afraid we\r\nwould not take it. Believe me, dear Sir, there is not in the British\r\nempire a man who more cordially loves a union with Great Britain than I\r\ndo. But, by the God that made me, I will cease to exist before I yield\r\nto a connection on such terms as the British Parliament propose; and\r\nin this, I think I speak the sentiments of America. We want neither\r\ninducement nor power to declare and assert a separation. It is will\r\nalone which is wanting, and that is growing apace under the fostering\r\nhand of our King. One bloody campaign will probably decide everlastingly\r\nour future course; I am sorry to find a bloody campaign is decided on.\r\nIf our winds and waters should not combine to rescue their shores from\r\nslavery, and General Howe’s reinforcement should arrive in safety, we\r\nhave hopes he will be inspirited to come out of Boston and take another\r\ndrubbing: and we must drub him soundly before the sceptred tyrant will\r\nknow we are not mere brutes, to crouch under his hand, and kiss the rod\r\nwith which he deigns to scourge us.\r\n\r\nYours, &c.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.--TO BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, August 13, 1777\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, PARIS.\r\n\r\nVirginia,\r\n\r\nAugust 13, 1777.\r\n\r\nHonorable Sir,\r\n\r\nI forbear to write you news, as the time of Mr. Shore’s departure being\r\nuncertain, it might be old before you receive it, and he can, in person,\r\npossess you of all we have. With respect to the State of Virginia in\r\nparticular, the people seem to have laid aside the monarchical, and\r\ntaken up the republican government, with as much ease as would have\r\nattended their throwing off an old and putting on a new suit of clothes.\r\nNot a single throe has attended this important transformation. A\r\nhalf dozen aristocratical gentlemen, agonizing under the loss of\r\npre-eminence, have sometimes ventured their sarcasms on our political\r\nmetamorphosis. They have been thought fitter objects of pity than of\r\npunishment. We are at present in the complete and quiet exercise of well\r\norganized government, save only that our courts of justice do not open\r\ntill the fall. I think nothing can bring the security of our continent\r\nand its cause into danger, if we can support the credit of our paper. To\r\ndo that, I apprehend one of two steps must be taken. Either to procure\r\nfree trade by alliance with some naval power able to protect it; or, if\r\nwe find there is no prospect of that, to shut our ports totally to all\r\nthe world, and turn our colonies into manufactories. The former would be\r\nmost eligible, because most conformable to the habits and wishes of\r\nour people. Were the British Court to return to their senses in time to\r\nseize the little advantage which still remains within their reach from\r\nthis quarter, I judge that, on acknowledging our absolute independence\r\nand sovereignty, a commercial treaty beneficial to them, and perhaps\r\neven a league of mutual offence and defence, might, not seeing the\r\nexpense or consequences of such a measure, be approved by our people, if\r\nnothing in the mean time, done on your part, should prevent it. But\r\nthey will continue to grasp at their desperate sovereignty, till every\r\nbenefit short of that is for ever out of their reach. I wish my domestic\r\nsituation had rendered it possible for me to join you in the very\r\nhonorable charge confided to you. Residence in a polite Court, society\r\nof literati of the first order, a just cause and an approving God, will\r\nadd length to a life for which all men pray, and none more than\r\n\r\nYour most obedient\r\n\r\nand humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.--TO PATRICK HENRY, March 27, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY PATRICK HENRY.\r\n\r\nAlbemarle,\r\n\r\nMarch 27, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nA report prevailing here, that in consequence of some powers from\r\nCongress, the Governor and Council have it in contemplation to\r\nremove the Convention troops, [The troops under Burgoyne, captured at\r\nSaratoga.] either wholly or in part, from their present situation,\r\nI take the liberty of troubling you with some observations on that\r\nsubject. The reputation and interest of our country, in general, may\r\nbe affected by such a measure; it would, therefore, hardly be deemed an\r\nindecent liberty, in the most private citizen, to offer his thoughts\r\nto the consideration of the Executive. The locality of my situation,\r\nparticularly, in the neighborhood of the present barracks, and the\r\npublic relation in which I stand to the people among whom they are\r\nsituated, together with a confidence, which a personal knowledge of the\r\nmembers of the Executive gives me, that they Will be glad of information\r\nfrom any quarter, on a subject interesting to the public, induce me\r\nto hope that they will acquit me of impropriety in the present\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nBy an article in the Convention of Saratoga, it is stipulated, on the\r\npart of the United States, that the officers shall not be separated\r\nfrom their men. I suppose the term officers, includes general as well as\r\nregimental officers. As there are general officers who command all the\r\ntroops, no part of them can be separated from these officers without a\r\nviolation of the article: they cannot, of course, be separated from one\r\nanother, unless the same general officer could be in different places\r\nat the same time. It is true, the article adds the words, ‘as far as\r\ncircumstances will admit.’ This was a necessary qualification; because,\r\nin no place in America, I suppose, could there have been found quarters\r\nfor both officers and men together; those for the officers to be\r\naccording to their rank. So far, then, as the circumstances of the place\r\nwhere they should be quartered, should render a separation necessary, in\r\norder to procure quarters for the officers, according to their rank, the\r\narticle admits that separation. And these are the circumstances which\r\nmust have been under the contemplation of the parties; both of whom, and\r\nall the world beside (who are ultimate judges in the case), would still\r\nunderstand that they were to be as near in the environs of the camp, as\r\nconvenient quarters could be procured; and not that the qualification\r\nof the article destroyed the article itself and laid it wholly at our\r\ndiscretion. Congress, indeed, have admitted of this separation; but\r\nare they so far lords of right and wrong as that our consciences may\r\nbe quiet with their dispensation? Or is the case amended by saying they\r\nleave it optional in the Governor and Council to separate the troops\r\nor not? At the same time that it exculpates not them, it is drawing the\r\nGovernor and Council into a participation in the breach of faith. If\r\nindeed it is only proposed, that a separation of the troops shall be\r\nreferred to the consent of their officers; that is a very different\r\nmatter. Having carefully avoided conversation with them on public\r\nsubjects, I cannot say, of my own knowledge, how they would relish\r\nsuch a proposition. I have heard from others, that they will choose to\r\nundergo any thing together, rather than to be separated, and that they\r\nwill remonstrate against it in the strongest terms. The Executive,\r\ntherefore, if voluntary agents in this measure, must be drawn into a\r\npaper war with them, the more disagreeable, as it seems that faith and\r\nreason will be on the other side. As an American, I cannot help feeling\r\na thorough mortification, that our Congress should have permitted an\r\ninfraction of our public honor; as a citizen of Virginia, I cannot help\r\nhoping and confiding, that our supreme Executive, whose acts will be\r\nconsidered as the acts of the Commonwealth, estimate that honor too\r\nhighly to make its infraction their own act. I may be permitted to hope,\r\nthen, that if any removal takes place, it will be a general one: and, as\r\nit is said to be left to the Governor and Council to determine on\r\nthis, I am satisfied, that, suppressing every other consideration, and\r\nweighing the matter dispassionately, they will determine upon this sole\r\nquestion, Is it for the benefit of those for whom they act, that, the\r\nConvention troops should be removed from among them? Under the head of\r\ninterest, these circumstances, viz. the expense of building barracks,\r\nsaid to have been £25,000, and of removing the troops backwards and\r\nforwards, amounting to I know not how much, are not to be pre-termitted,\r\nmerely because they are Continental expenses; for we are a part of the\r\nContinent; we must pay a shilling of every dollar wasted. But the sums\r\nof money, which, by these troops, or on their account, are brought into,\r\nand expended in this State, are a great and local advantage. This can\r\nrequire no proof. If, at the conclusion of the war, for instance, our\r\nshare of the Continental debt should be twenty millions of dollars, or\r\nsay that we are called on to furnish an annual quota of two millions\r\nfour hundred thousand dollars, to Congress, to be raised by tax, it is\r\nobvious that we should raise these given sums with greater or less\r\nease, in proportion to the greater or less quantity of money found in\r\ncirculation among us. I expect that our circulating money is, by the\r\npresence of these troops, at the rate of $30,000 a week, at the least. I\r\nhave heard, indeed, that an objection arises to their being kept within\r\nthis state, from the information of the commissary that they cannot\r\nbe subsisted here. In attending to the information of that officer,\r\nit should be borne in mind that the county of King William and its\r\nvicinities are one thing, the territory of Virginia another. If the\r\ntroops could be fed upon long letters, I believe the gentleman at the\r\nhead of that department in this country would be the best commissary\r\nupon earth. But till I see him determined to act, not to write; to\r\nsacrifice his domestic ease to the duties of his appointment, and apply\r\nto the resources of this country, wheresoever they are to be had, I must\r\nentertain a different opinion of him. I am mistaken, if, for the animal\r\nsub-sistence of the troops hitherto, we are not principally indebted to\r\nthe genius and exertions of Hawkins, during the very short time he\r\nlived after his appointment to that department, by your board. His\r\neye immediately pervaded the whole state; it was reduced at once to\r\na regular machine, to a system, and the whole put into movement and\r\nanimation by the _fiat_ of a comprehensive mind. If the Commonwealth\r\nof Virginia cannot furnish these troops with bread, I would ask of the\r\ncommissariat, which of the thirteen is now become the grain colony? If\r\nwe are in danger of famine from the addition of four thousand mouths,\r\nwhat is become of that surplus of bread, the exportation of which used\r\nto feed the West Indies and Eastern States, and fill the colony with\r\nhard money? When I urge the sufficiency of this State, however, to\r\nsubsist these troops, I beg to be understood, as having in contemplation\r\nthe quantity of provisions necessary for their real use, and not as\r\ncalculating what is to be lost by the wanton waste, mismanagement, and\r\ncarelessness of those employed about it. If magazines of beef and\r\npork are suffered to rot by slovenly butchering, or for want of\r\ntimely provision and sale; if quantities of flour are exposed by the\r\ncommissaries entrusted with the keeping it, to pillage and destruction;\r\nand if, when laid up in the Continental stores, it is still to be\r\nembezzled and sold, the land of Egypt itself would be insufficient\r\nfor their supply, and their removal would be necessary, not to a more\r\nplentiful country, but to more able and honest commissaries. Perhaps,\r\nthe magnitude of this question, and its relation to the whole state,\r\nmay render it worth while to await, the opinion of the National Council,\r\nwhich is now to meet within a few weeks. There is no danger of\r\ndistress in the mean time, as the commissaries affirm they have a great\r\nsufficiency of provisions for some time to come. Should the measure of\r\nremoving them into another State be adopted, and carried into execution,\r\nbefore the meeting of Assembly, no disapprobation of theirs will bring\r\nthem back, because they will then be in the power of others, who will\r\nhardly give them up.\r\n\r\nWant of information as to what may be the precise measure proposed by\r\nthe Governor and Council, obliges me to shift my ground, and take up the\r\nsubject in every possible form. Perhaps they have not thought to remove\r\nthe troops out of this State altogether, but to some other part of\r\nit. Here, the objections arising from the expenses of removal, and of\r\nbuilding new barracks, recur. As to animal food, it may be driven to\r\none part of the country as easily as to another: that circumstance,\r\ntherefore, may be thrown out of the question. As to bread, I suppose\r\nthey will require about forty or forty-five thousand bushels of grain\r\na year. The place to which it is to be brought to them, is about the\r\ncentre of the State. Besides that the country round about is fertile,\r\nall the grain made in the counties adjacent to any kind of navigation,\r\nmay be brought by water to within twelve miles of the spot. For these\r\ntwelve miles, wagons must be employed; I suppose half a dozen will be a\r\nplenty. Perhaps this part of the expense might have been saved, had the\r\nbarracks been built on the water; but it is not sufficient to justify\r\ntheir being abandoned now they are built. Wagonage, indeed, seems to\r\nthe commissariat, an article not worth economizing. The most wanton and\r\nstudied circuity of transportation has been practised: to mention\r\nonly one act, they have bought quantities of flour for these troops\r\nin Cumberland, have ordered it to be wagoned down to Manchester, and\r\nwagoned thence up to the barracks. This fact happened to fall within my\r\nown knowledge. I doubt not there are many more such, in order either to\r\nproduce their total removal, or to run up the expenses of the present\r\nsituation, and satisfy Congress that the nearer they are brought to the\r\ncommissary’s own bed, the cheaper they will be subsisted. The grain made\r\nin the Western counties may be brought partly in wagons, as conveniently\r\nto this as to any other place; perhaps more so, on account of its\r\nvicinity to one of the best passes through the Blue Ridge; and partly\r\nby water, as it is near to James river, to the navigation of which, ten\r\ncounties are adjacent above the falls. When I said that the grain\r\nmight be brought hither from all the counties of the State, adjacent to\r\nnavigation, I did not mean to say it would be proper to bring it from\r\nall. On the contrary, I think the commissary should be instructed, after\r\nthe next harvest, not to send one bushel of grain to the barracks\r\nfrom below the falls of the rivers, or from the northern counties. The\r\ncounties on tide water are accessible to the calls for our own army.\r\nTheir supplies ought, therefore, to be husbanded for them. The counties\r\nin the northwestern parts of the State are not only within reach for our\r\nown grand army, but peculiarly necessary for the support of Macintosh’s\r\narmy; or for the support of any other northwestern expedition, which the\r\nuncertain conduct of the Indians should render necessary; insomuch\r\nthat if the supplies of that quarter should be misapplied to any\r\nother purpose, it would destroy in embryo every exertion, either for\r\nparticular or general safety there. The counties above tide water,\r\nin the middle and southern and western parts of the country, are not\r\naccessible to calls for either of those purposes, but at such an expense\r\nof transportation as the article would not bear. Here, then, is a\r\ngreat field, whose supplies of bread cannot be carried to our army, or,\r\nrather, which will raise no supplies of bread, because there is no body\r\nto eat them. Was it not, then, wise in Congress to remove to that field\r\nfour thousand idle mouths, who must otherwise have interfered with the\r\npasture of our own troops? And, if they are removed to any other part\r\nof the country, will it not defeat this wise purpose? The mills on the\r\nwaters of James river, above the falls, open to canoe navigation,\r\nare very many. Some of them are of great note, as manufacturers. The\r\nbarracks are surrounded by mills. There are five or six round about\r\nCharlottesville. Any two or three of the whole might, in the course of\r\nthe winter, manufacture flour sufficient for the year. To say the worst,\r\nthen, of this situation, it is but twelve miles wrong. The safe custody\r\nof these troops is another circumstance worthy consideration. Equally\r\nremoved from the access of an eastern or western enemy; central to the\r\nwhole State, so that, should they attempt an irruption in any direction,\r\nthey must pass through a great extent of hostile country; in a\r\nneighborhood thickly inhabited by a robust and hardy people, zealous in\r\nthe American cause, acquainted with the use of arms, and the defiles and\r\npasses by which they must issue: it would seem, that in this point of\r\nview, no place could have been better chosen.\r\n\r\nTheir health is also of importance. I would not endeavor to show that\r\ntheir lives are valuable to us, because it would suppose a possibility,\r\nthat humanity was kicked out of doors in America, and interest only\r\nattended to. The barracks occupy the top and brow of a very high hill,\r\n(you have been untruly told they were in a bottom.) They are free from\r\nfog, have four springs which seem to be plentiful, one within twenty\r\nyards of the piquet, two within fifty yards, and another within two\r\nhundred and fifty, and they propose to sink wells within the piquet. Of\r\nfour thousand people, it should be expected, according to the ordinary\r\ncalculations, that one should die every day. Yet, in the space of near\r\nthree months, there have been but four deaths among them; two infants\r\nunder three weeks old, and two others by apoplexy. The officers tell me,\r\nthe troops were never before so healthy since they were embodied.\r\n\r\nBut is an enemy so execrable, that, though in captivity, his wishes and\r\ncomforts are to be disregarded and even crossed? I think not. It is\r\nfor the benefit of mankind to mitigate the horrors of war as much\r\nas possible. The practice, therefore, of modern nations, of treating\r\ncaptive enemies with politeness and generosity, is not only delightful\r\nin contemplation, but really interesting to all the world, friends,\r\nfoes, and neutrals. Let us apply this: the officers, after considerable\r\nhardships, have all procured quarters comfortable and satisfactory to\r\nthem. In order to do this, they were obliged, in many instances, to\r\nhire houses for a year certain, and at such exorbitant rents, as were\r\nsufficient to tempt independent owners to go out of them, and shift as\r\nthey could. These houses, in most cases, were much out of repair.\r\nThey have repaired them at a considerable expense. One of the general\r\nofficers has taken a place for two years, advanced the rent for the\r\nwhole time, and been obliged, moreover, to erect additional buildings\r\nfor the accommodation of part of his family, for which there was\r\nnot room in the house rented. Independent of the brick work, for the\r\ncarpentry of these additional buildings, I know he is to pay fifteen\r\nhundred dollars. The same gentleman, to my knowledge, has-paid to one\r\nperson, three thousand six hundred, and seventy dollars, for different\r\narticles to fix himself commodiously. They have generally laid in their\r\nstocks of grain and other provisions, for it is well known that officers\r\ndo not live on their rations. They have purchased cows, sheep, &c, set\r\nin to farming, prepared their gardens, and have a prospect of comfort\r\nand quiet before them. To turn to the soldiers: the environs of the\r\nbarracks are delightful, the ground cleared, laid off in hundreds of\r\ngardens, each enclosed in its separate paling; these well prepared, and\r\nexhibiting, a fine appearance. General Riedesel, alone, laid out upwards\r\nof two hundred pounds in garden seeds, for the German troops only. Judge\r\nwhat an extent of ground these seeds would cover. There is little doubt\r\nthat their own gardens will furnish them a great abundance of vegetables\r\nthrough the year. Their poultry, pigeons, and other preparations of that\r\nkind, present to the mind the idea of a company of farmers, rather than\r\na camp of soldiers. In addition to the barracks built for them by the\r\npublic, and now very comfortable, they have built great numbers for\r\nthemselves, in such messes as fancied each other: and the whole\r\ncorps, both officers and men, seem now, happy and satisfied with their\r\nsituation. Having thus found the art of rendering captivity itself\r\ncomfortable, and carried it into execution, at their own great expense\r\nand labor, their spirit sustained by the prospect of gratifications\r\nrising before their eyes, does not every sentiment of humanity revolt\r\nagainst the proposition of stripping them of all this, and removing\r\nthem into new situations, where from the advanced season of the year, no\r\npreparations can be made for carrying themselves comfortably through the\r\nheats of summer; and when it is known that the necessary advances for\r\nthe conveniences already provided, have exhausted their funds and left\r\nthem unable to make the like exertions anew. Again; review this\r\nmatter as it may regard appearances. A body of troops, after staying\r\na twelvemonth at Boston, are ordered to take a march of seven hundred\r\nmiles to Virginia, where, it is said, they may be plentifully subsisted.\r\nAs soon as they are there, they are ordered on some other march,\r\nbecause, in Virginia, it is said, they cannot be subsisted. Indifferent\r\nnations will charge this either to ignorance, or to whim and caprice;\r\nthe parties interested, to cruelty. They now view the proposition in\r\nthat light, and it is said, there is a general and firm persuasion among\r\nthem, that they were marched from Boston with no other purpose than to\r\nharass and destroy them with eternal marches. Perseverance in object,\r\nthough not by the most direct way, is often more laudable than perpetual\r\nchanges, as often as the object shifts light. A character of steadiness\r\nin our councils is worth more than the subsistence of four thousand\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThere could not have been a more unlucky concurrence of circumstances\r\nthan when these troops first came. The barracks were unfinished for want\r\nof laborers, the spell of weather the worst ever known within the memory\r\nof man, no stores of bread laid in, the roads, by the weather and number\r\nof wagons, soon rendered impassable: not only the troops themselves were\r\ngreatly disappointed, but the people in the neighborhood were alarmed at\r\nthe consequences which a total failure of provisions might produce.\r\nIn this worst state of things, their situation was seen by many\r\nand disseminated through the country, so as to occasion a general\r\ndissatisfaction, which even seized the minds of reasonable men, who, if\r\nnot infected with the contagion, must have foreseen that the prospect\r\nmust brighten, and that great advantages to the people must necessarily\r\narise. It has, accordingly, so happened. The planters, being more\r\ngenerally sellers than buyers, have felt the benefit of their presence\r\nin the most vital part about them, their purses, and are now sensible\r\nof its source. I have too good an opinion of their love of order, to\r\nbelieve that a removal of these troops would produce any irregular\r\nproofs of their disapprobation, but I am well assured it would be\r\nextremely odious to them.\r\n\r\nTo conclude. The separation of these troops would be a breach of public\r\nfaith; therefore suppose it impossible. If they are removed to another\r\nState, it is the fault of the commissaries; if they are removed to any\r\nother part of the State, it is the fault of the commissaries; and\r\nin both cases, the public interest and public security suffer, the\r\ncomfortable and plentiful subsistence of our own army is lessened, the\r\nhealth of the troops neglected, their wishes crossed, and their comforts\r\ntorn from them, the character of whim and caprice, or, what is worse,\r\nof cruelty, fixed on us as a nation, and, to crown the whole, our own\r\npeople disgusted with such a proceeding.\r\n\r\nI have thus taken the liberty of representing to you the facts and the\r\nreasons, which seem to militate against the separation or removal of\r\nthese troops. I am sensible, however, that the same subject may appear\r\nto different persons in very different lights. What I have urged as\r\nreasons, may, to sounder minds, be apparent fallacies. I hope they will\r\nappear, at least, so plausible, as to excuse the interposition of\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s\r\n\r\nmost obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI.--TO JOHN PAGE, January 22, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\nWilliamsburg,\r\n\r\nJanuary 22, 1779.\r\n\r\nDear Page,\r\n\r\nI received your letter by Mr. Jamieson. It had given me much pain, that\r\nthe zeal of our respective friends should ever have placed you and me\r\nin the situation of competitors. I was comforted, however, with the\r\nreflection, that it was their competition, not ours, and that\r\nthe difference of the numbers which decided between us, was too\r\ninsignificant to give you a pain, or me a pleasure, had our dispositions\r\ntowards each other been such as to admit those sensations. I know you\r\ntoo well to need an apology for any thing you do, and hope you will for\r\never be assured of this; and as to the constructions of the world, they\r\nwould only have added one to the many sins for which they are to go to\r\nthe devil. As this is the first, I hope it will be the last, instance\r\nof ceremony between us. A desire to see my family, which is in Charles\r\nCity, carries me thither to-morrow, and I shall not return till Monday.\r\nBe pleased to present my compliments to Mrs. Page, and add this to the\r\nassurances I have ever given you, that I am, dear Page,\r\n\r\nyour affectionate friend,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, June 23, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nWilliamsburg,\r\n\r\nJune 23, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure to enclose you the particulars of Colonel Clarke’s\r\nsuccess against St. Vincennes, as stated in his letter but lately\r\nreceived; the messenger, with his first letter, having been killed. I\r\nfear it will be impossible for Colonel Clarke to be so strengthened,\r\nas to enable him to do what he desires. Indeed, the express who brought\r\nthis letter, gives us reason to fear, St. Vincennes is in danger from\r\na large body of Indians, collected to attack it, and said, when he\r\ncame from Kaskaskias, to be within thirty leagues of the place. I also\r\nenclose you a letter from Colonel Shelby, stating the effect of his\r\nsuccess against the seceding Cherokees and Chuccamogga. The damage done\r\nthem, was killing half a dozen, burning eleven towns, twenty thousand\r\nbushels of corn, collected probably to forward the expeditions which\r\nwere to have been planned at the council which was to meet Governor\r\nHamilton at the mouth of Tennessee, and taking as many goods as sold for\r\ntwenty-five thousand pounds. I hope these two blows coming together,\r\nand the depriving them of their head, will, in some measure, effect the\r\nquiet of our frontiers this summer. We have intelligence, also, that\r\nColonel Bowman, from Kentucky, is in the midst of the Shawnee country,\r\nwith three hundred men, and hope to hear a good account of him. The\r\nenclosed order being in its nature important, and generally interesting,\r\nI think it proper to transmit it to you, with the reasons supporting\r\nit.* It will add much to our satisfaction, to know it meets your\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with every sentiment of private respect and\r\npublic gratitude,\r\n\r\nSir, your most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. The distance of our northern and western counties from the scene\r\nof southern service, and the necessity of strengthening our western\r\nquarter, have induced the Council to direct the new levies from the\r\ncounties of Yohogania, Ohio, Monongalia, Frederick, Hampshire, Berkeley,\r\nRockingham, and Greenbrier, amounting to somewhat less than three\r\nhundred men, to enter into the ninth regiment at Pittsburg. The aid they\r\nmay give there, will be so immediate and important, and what they could\r\ndo to the southward, would be so late, as, I hope, will apologize for\r\ntheir interference. T. J.\r\n\r\n     * For the letter of Colonel Clarke, and the order referred\r\n     to, see Appendix A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VIII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, July 17, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nWilliamsburg,\r\n\r\nJuly 17, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI some time ago enclosed to you a printed copy of an order of Council,\r\nby which Governor Hamilton was to be confined in irons, in close jail,\r\nwhich has occasioned a letter from General Phillips, of which the\r\nenclosed is a copy. The General seems to think that a prisoner on\r\ncapitulation cannot be put in close confinement, though his capitulation\r\nshould not have provided against it. My idea was, that all persons taken\r\nin war, were to be deemed prisoners of war. That those who surrender on\r\ncapitulation (or convention) are prisoners of war also, subject to the\r\nsame treatment with those who surrender at discretion, except only so\r\nfar as the terms of their capitulation or convention shall have guarded\r\nthem. In the capitulation of Governor Hamilton (a copy of which I\r\nenclose), no stipulation is made as to the treatment of himself, or\r\nthose taken with him. The Governor, indeed, when he signs, adds a\r\nflourish of reasons inducing him to capitulate, one of which is the\r\ngenerosity of his enemy. Generosity, on a large and comprehensive scale,\r\nseems to dictate the making a signal example of this gentleman;\r\nbut waving that, these are only the private motives inducing him to\r\nsurrender, and do not enter into the contract of Colonel Clarke. I have\r\nthe highest idea of those contracts which take place between nation\r\nand nation, at war, and would be the last on earth to do any thing in\r\nviolation of them. I can find nothing in those books usually recurred\r\nto as testimonials of the laws and usages of nature and nations, which\r\nconvicts the opinions I have above expressed of error. Yet there may\r\nbe such an usage as General Phillips seems to suppose, though not taken\r\nnotice of by these writers. I am obliged to trouble your Excellency on\r\nthis occasion, by asking of you information on this point. There is no\r\nother person, whose decision will so authoritatively decide this doubt\r\nin the public mind, and none with which I am disposed so implicitly\r\nto comply. If you shall be of opinion that the bare existence of a\r\ncapitulation, in the case of Governor Hamilton, privileges him\r\nfrom confinement, though there be no article to that effect in the\r\ncapitulation, justice shall most assuredly be done him. The importance\r\nof this point, in a public view, and my own anxiety under a charge of\r\nviolation of national faith by the Executive of this Commonwealth, will,\r\nI hope, apologize for my adding this to the many troubles with which I\r\nknow you to be burdened. I have the honor to be, with the most profound\r\nrespect, your Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. I have just received a letter from Colonel Bland, containing\r\ninformation of numerous desertions from the Convention troops, not less\r\nthan four hundred in the last fortnight. He thinks he has reason to\r\nbelieve it is with the connivance of some of their officers. Some\r\nof these have been retaken, all of them going northwardly. They had\r\nprovided themselves with forged passports, and with certificates of\r\nhaving taken the oath of fidelity to the State; some of them forged,\r\nothers really given by weak magistrates. I give this information to\r\nyour Excellency, as perhaps it may be in your power to have such of them\r\nintercepted as shall be passing through Pennsylvania and Jersey.\r\n\r\nYour letter enclosing the opinion of the board of war in the case of\r\nAllison and Lee, has come safe to hand, after a long passage. It shall\r\nbe answered by next post. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IX.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, October 1, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nWilliamsburg,\r\n\r\nOctober 1, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nOn receipt of your letter of August 6th, during my absence, the Council\r\nhad the irons taken off the prisoners of war. When your advice was\r\nasked, we meant it should decide with us; and upon my return to\r\nWilliamsburg, the matter was taken up and the enclosed advice given.\r\n[See Appendix, note B.] A parole was formed, of which the enclosed is\r\na copy, and tendered to the prisoners. They objected to that part of it\r\nwhich restrained them from _saying_ any thing to the prejudice of\r\nthe United States, and insisted on ‘freedom of speech.’ They were, in\r\nconsequence, remanded to their confinement in the jail, which must be\r\nconsidered as a voluntary one, until they can determine with themselves\r\nto be inoffensive in word as well as deed. A flag sails hence to-morrow\r\nto New York, to negotiate the exchange of some prisoners. By her I have\r\nwritten to General Phillips on this subject, and enclosed to him copies\r\nof the within; intending it as an answer to a letter I received from him\r\non the subject of Governor Hamilton.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER X.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, October 2, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nWilliamsburg,\r\n\r\nOctober 2, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nJust as the letter accompanying this was going off, Colonel Mathews\r\narrived on parole from New York, by the way of headquarters, bringing\r\nyour Excellency’s letter on this subject, with that of the British\r\ncommissary of prisoners. The subject is of great importance, and I must,\r\ntherefore, reserve myself to answer after further consideration. Were\r\nI to speak from present impressions, I should say it was happy for\r\nGovernor Hamilton that a final determination of his fate was formed\r\nbefore this new information. As the enemy have released Captain Willing\r\nfrom his irons, the Executive of this State will be induced perhaps not\r\nto alter their former opinion. But it is impossible they can be serious\r\nin attempting to bully us in this manner. We have too many of their\r\nsubjects in our power, and too much iron to clothe them with, and, I\r\nwill add, too much resolution to avail ourselves of both, to fear their\r\npretended retaliation. However, I will do myself the honor of forwarding\r\nto your Excellency the ultimate result of Council on this subject.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the information in the letter from the British\r\ncommissary of prisoners, that no officers of the Virginia line should\r\nbe exchanged till Governor Hamilton’s affair should be settled, we have\r\nstopped our flag, which was just hoisting anchor with a load of privates\r\nfor New York. I must, therefore, ask the favor of your Excellency to\r\nforward the enclosed by flag, when an opportunity offers, as I suppose\r\nGeneral Phillips will be in New York before it reaches you.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir, with the greatest esteem,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XI.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, Oct. 8, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nIn Council, Oct. 8, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn mine of the second of the present month, written in the instant of\r\nColonel Mathews’ delivery of your letter, I informed you what had been\r\ndone on the subject of Governor Hamilton and his companions previous to\r\nthat moment. I now enclose you an advice of Council, [See Appendix, note\r\nC.] in consequence of the letter you were pleased to enclose me, from\r\nthe British commissary of prisoners, with one from Lord Rawdon; also\r\na copy of my letter to Colonel Mathews, enclosing, also, the papers\r\ntherein named. The advice of Council to allow the enlargement of\r\nprisoners, on their giving a proper parole, has not been recalled, nor\r\nwill be, I suppose, unless something on the part of the enemy should\r\nrender it necessary. I rather expect, however, that they will see it\r\ntheir interest to discontinue this kind of conduct. I am afraid I shall\r\nhereafter, perhaps be obliged to give your Excellency some trouble in\r\naiding me to obtain information of the future usage of our prisoners. I\r\nshall give immediate orders for having in readiness every engine which\r\nthe enemy have contrived for the destruction of our unhappy citizens,\r\ncaptivated by them. The presentiment of these operations is shocking\r\nbeyond expression. I pray Heaven to avert them: but nothing in this\r\nworld will do it, but a proper conduct in the enemy. In every event, I\r\nshall resign myself to the hard necessity under which I shall act.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great regard and esteem,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s\r\n\r\nmost obedient and\r\n\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XII.--TO COLONEL MATHEWS, October, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MATHEWS.\r\n\r\nIn Council, October, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe proceedings respecting Governor Hamilton and his companions,\r\nprevious to your arrival here, you are acquainted with. For your more\r\nprecise information, I enclose you the advice of Council, of June the\r\n16th, of that of August the 28th, another of September the 19th, on the\r\nparole tendered them the 1st instant, and Governor Hamilton’s letter of\r\nthe same day, stating his objections, in which he persevered: from that\r\ntime his confinement has become a voluntary one. You delivered us\r\nyour letters the next day, when, the post being just setting out, much\r\nbusiness prevented the Council from taking them into consideration. They\r\nhave this day attended to them, and found their resolution expressed in\r\nthe enclosed advice bearing date this day. It gives us great pain\r\nthat any of our countrymen should be cut off from the society of their\r\nfriends and tenderest connections, while it seems as if it was in\r\nour power, to administer relief. But we trust to their good sense for\r\ndiscerning, and their spirit for bearing up against the fallacy of this\r\nappearance. Governor Hamilton and his companions were imprisoned and\r\nironed, 1st. In retaliation for cruel treatment of our captive citizens\r\nby the enemy in general. 2nd. For the barbarous species of warfare which\r\nhimself and his savage allies carried on in our western frontier. 3d.\r\nFor particular acts of barbarity, of which he himself was personally\r\nguilty, to some of our citizens in his power. Any one of these charges\r\nwas sufficient to justify the measures we took. Of the truth of the\r\nfirst, yourselves are witnesses. Your situation, indeed, seems to have\r\nbeen better since you were sent to New York; but reflect on what you\r\nsuffered before that, and knew others of our countrymen to suffer, and\r\nwhat you know is now suffered by that more unhappy part of them, who\r\nare still confined on board the prison-ships of the enemy. Proofs of the\r\nsecond charge, we have under Hamilton’s own hand: and of the third,\r\nas sacred assurances as human testimony is capable of giving. Humane\r\nconduct on our part, was found to produce no effect; the contrary,\r\ntherefore, was to be tried. If it produces a proper lenity to our\r\ncitizens in captivity, it will have the effect we meant; if it does not,\r\nwe shall return a severity as terrible as universal. If the causes of\r\nour rigor against Hamilton were founded in truth, that rigor was just,\r\nand would not give right to the enemy to commence any new hostilities\r\non their part: and all such new severities are to be considered, not as\r\nretaliation, but as original and unprovoked. If those causes were,\r\nnot founded in truth, they should have denied them. If, declining the\r\ntribunal of truth and reason, they choose to pervert this into a contest\r\nof cruelty and destruction, we will contend with them in that line, and\r\nmeasure out misery to those in our power, in that multiplied proportion\r\nwhich the advantage of superior numbers enables us to do. We shall think\r\nit our particular duty, after the information we gather from the papers\r\nwhich have been laid before us, to pay very constant attention to your\r\nsituation, and that of your fellow prisoners. We hope that the prudence\r\nof the enemy will be your protection from injury; and we are assured\r\nthat your regard for the honor of your country would not permit you\r\nto wish we should suffer ourselves to be bullied into an acquiescence,\r\nunder every insult and cruelty they may choose to practise, and a\r\nfear to retaliate, lest you should be made to experience additional\r\nsufferings. Their officers and soldiers in our hands are pledges\r\nfor your safety: we are determined to use them as such. Iron will be\r\nretaliated by iron, but a great multiplication on distinguished objects;\r\nprison-ships by prison-ships, and like for like in general. I do\r\nnot mean by this to cover any officer who has acted, or shall act,\r\nimproperly. They say Captain Willing was guilty of great cruelties at\r\nthe Natchez; if so, they do right in punishing him. I would use any\r\npowers I have, for the punishment of any officer of our own, who should\r\nbe guilty of excesses unjustifiable under the usages of civilized\r\nnations. However, I do not find myself obliged to believe the charge\r\nagainst Captain Willing to be true, on the affirmation of the British\r\ncommissary, because, in the next breath, he affirms no cruelties have as\r\nyet been inflicted on him. Captain Willing has been in irons.\r\n\r\nI beg you to be assured, there is nothing consistent with the honor of\r\nyour country, which we shall not, at all times, be ready to do for the\r\nrelief of yourself and companions in captivity. We know, that ardent\r\nspirit and hatred for tyranny, which brought you into your present\r\nsituation, will enable you to bear up against it with the firmness,\r\nwhich has distinguished you as a soldier, and to look forward with\r\npleasure to the day, when events shall take place, against which\r\nthe wounded spirits of your enemies will find no comfort, even from\r\nreflections on the most refined of the cruelties with which they have\r\nglutted themselves.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, November 28, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nWilllamsburg, November 28, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour Excellency’s letter on the discriminations which have been\r\nheretofore made, between the troops raised within this state, and\r\nconsidered as part of our quota, and those not so considered, was\r\ndelivered me four days ago. I immediately laid it before the Assembly,\r\nwho thereupon came to the resolution I now do myself the honor of\r\nenclosing you. The resolution of Congress, of March 15th, 1779, which\r\nyou were so kind as to enclose, was never known in this state till a few\r\nweeks ago, when we received printed copies of the Journals of Congress.\r\nIt would be a great satisfaction to us, to receive an exact return\r\nof all the men we have in Continental service, who come within the\r\ndescription of the resolution, together with our state troops in\r\nContinental service. Colonel Cabell was so kind as to send me a return\r\nof the Continental regiments, commanded by Lord Sterling, of the first\r\nand second Virginia State regiments, and of Colonel Gist’s regiment.\r\nBesides these are the following, viz. Colonel Harrison’s regiment\r\nof artillery, Colonel Bayler’s horse, Colonel Eland’s horse, General\r\nScott’s new levies, part of which are gone to Carolina, and part are\r\nhere, Colonel Gibson’s regiment stationed on the Ohio, Heath and Ohara’s\r\nindependent companies at the same stations. Colonel Taylor’s regiment of\r\nguards to the Convention troops: of these, we have a return. There may,\r\npossibly, be others not occurring to me. A return of all these would\r\nenable us to see what proportion of the Continental army is contributed\r\nby us. We have, at present, very pressing calls to send additional\r\nnumbers of men to the southward. No inclination is wanting in either the\r\nLegislature or Executive, to aid them or strengthen you: but we find it\r\nvery difficult to procure men. I herewith transmit to your Excellency\r\nsome recruiting commissions, to be put into such hands as you may think\r\nproper, for re-enlisting such of our soldiery as are not already\r\nengaged for the war. The Act of Assembly authorizing these instructions,\r\nrequires that the men enlisted should be reviewed and received by an\r\nofficer to be appointed for that purpose; a caution, less necessary\r\nin the case of men now actually in Service, therefore, doubtless\r\nable-bodied, than in the raising new recruits. The direction, however,\r\ngoes to all cases, and, therefore, we must trouble your Excellency with\r\nthe appointment of one or more officers of review. Mr. Moss, our agent,\r\nreceives orders, which accompany this, to pay the bounty money and\r\nrecruiting money, and to deliver the clothing. We have, however, certain\r\nreason to fear he has not any great sum of money on hand; and it is\r\nabsolutely out of our power, at this time, to supply him, or to say,\r\nwith certainty, when we shall be able to do it. He is instructed to note\r\nhis acceptances under the draughts, and to assure payment as soon as we\r\nshall have it in our power to furnish him, as the only substitute for\r\nmoney. Your Excellency’s directions to the officer of review, will\r\nprobably procure us the satisfaction of being informed, from time to\r\ntime, how many men shall be re-enlisted.\r\n\r\nBy Colonel Mathews I informed your Excellency fully of the situation\r\nof Governor Hamilton and his companions. Lamothe and Dejean have given\r\ntheir paroles, and are at Hanover Court-House: Hamilton, Hay, and\r\nothers, are still obstinate; therefore, still in close confinement,\r\nthough their irons have never been on, since your second letter on the\r\nsubject. I wrote full information of this matter to General Phillips\r\nalso, from whom I had received letters on the subject. I cannot, in\r\nreason, believe that the enemy, on receiving this information either\r\nfrom yourself or General Phillips, will venture to impose any new\r\ncruelties on our officers in captivity with them. Yet their conduct,\r\nhitherto, has been most successfully prognosticated by reversing the\r\nconclusions of right reason. It is, therefore, my duty, as well as\r\nit was my promise to the Virginia captives, to take measures for\r\ndiscovering any change which may be made in their situation. For this\r\npurpose, I must apply for your Excellency’s interposition. I doubt not\r\nbut you have an established mode of knowing, at all times, through your\r\ncommissary of prisoners, the precise state of those in the power of the\r\nenemy. I must, therefore, pray you to put into motion any such means you\r\nhave, for obtaining knowledge of the situation of Virginia officers in\r\ncaptivity. If you should think proper, as I could wish, to take upon\r\nyourself to retaliate any new sufferings which may be imposed on them,\r\nit will be more likely to have-due weight, and to restore the unhappy on\r\nboth sides, to that benevolent treatment for which all should wish.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIV.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, December 10,1779\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nWilliamsburg, December 10,1779.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of putting under cover to your Excellency some\r\nletters to Generals Phillips and Reidesel, uninformed whether they are\r\ngone into New York or not, and knowing that you can best forward them in\r\neither case.\r\n\r\nI also trouble you with a letter from the master of the flag in this\r\nState, to the British commissary of prisoners in New York, trusting it\r\nwill thus be more certainly conveyed than if sent to Mr. Adams. It is\r\nmy wish the British commissary should return his answer through your\r\nExcellency, or your commissary of prisoners, and that they should not\r\npropose, under this pretext, to send another flag, as the mission of the\r\npresent flag is not unattended with circumstances of suspicion; and a\r\ncertain information of the situation of ourselves and our allies here,\r\nmight influence the measures of the enemy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps your commissary of prisoners can effect the former method of\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nI enclose to you part of an Act of Assembly ascertaining the quantity of\r\nland, which shall be allowed to the officers and soldiers at the close\r\nof the war, and providing means of keeping that country vacant which has\r\nbeen allotted for them.\r\n\r\nI am advised to ask your Excellency’s attention to the case of Colonel\r\nBland, late commander of the barracks in Albemarle. When that gentleman\r\nwas appointed to that command, he attended the Executive here and\r\ninformed them he must either decline it, or be supported in such a\r\nway as would keep up that respect which was essential to his command;\r\nwithout, at the same time, ruining his private fortune.\r\n\r\nThe Executive were sensible he would be exposed to great and unavoidable\r\nexpense: they observed, his command would be in a department separate\r\nfrom any other, and that he actually relieved a Major General from\r\nthe same service. They did not think themselves authorized to say what\r\nshould be done in this case, but undertook to represent the matter to\r\nCongress, and, in the mean time, gave it as their opinion that he ought\r\nto be allowed a decent table. On this, he undertook the office, and\r\nin the course of it incurred expenses which seemed to have been\r\nunavoidable, unless he would have lived in such a way as is hardly\r\nreconcileable to the spirit of an officer, or the reputation of those\r\nin whose service he is. Governor Henry wrote on the subject to Congress;\r\nColonel Bland did the same; but we learn they have concluded the\r\nallowance to be unprecedented, and inadmissible in the case of an\r\nofficer of his rank. The commissaries, on this, have called on Colonel\r\nBland for reimbursement. A sale of his estate was about to take place,\r\nwhen we undertook to recommend to them to suspend their demand, till we\r\ncould ask the favor of you to advocate this matter so far with Congress,\r\nas you may think it right; otherwise the ruin of a very worthy officer\r\nmust inevitably follow. I have the honor to be, with the greatest\r\nrespect and esteem,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s\r\n\r\nmost obedient servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XV.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, February 10, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nWilliamsburg, February 10, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIt is possible you may have heard, that in the course of last summer an\r\nexpedition was meditated, by our Colonel Clarke, against Detroit: that\r\nhe had proceeded so far as to rendezvous a considerable body of\r\nIndians, I believe four or five thousand, at St. Vincennes; but, being\r\ndisappointed in the number of whites he expected, and not choosing to\r\nrely principally on the Indians, he was obliged to decline it. We have\r\na tolerable prospect of reinforcing him this spring, to the number which\r\nhe thinks sufficient for the enterprise. We have informed him of this,\r\nand left him to decide between this object, and that of giving vigorous\r\nchastisement to those tribes of Indians, whose eternal hostilities have\r\nproved them incapable of living on friendly terms with us. It is our\r\nopinion, his inclination will lead him to determine on the former. The\r\nreason of my laying before your Excellency this matter, is, that it\r\nhas been intimated to me that Colonel Broadhead is meditating a similar\r\nexpedition. I wished, therefore, to make you acquainted with what we had\r\nin contemplation. The enterprising and energetic genius of Clarke is not\r\naltogether unknown to you. You also know (what I am a stranger to) the\r\nabilities of Broadhead, and the particular force with which you will be\r\nable to arm him for such an expedition. We wish the most hopeful\r\nmeans should be used for removing so uneasy a thorn from our side. As\r\nyourself, alone, are acquainted with all the circumstances necessary for\r\nwell informed decision, I am to ask the favor of your Excellency, if you\r\nshould think Broadhead’s undertaking it most likely to produce success,\r\nthat you will be so kind as to intimate to us to divert Clarke to the\r\nother object, which is also important to this State. It will, of course,\r\nhave weight with you in forming your determination, that our prospect of\r\nstrengthening Clarke’s hands, sufficiently, is not absolutely certain.\r\nIt may be necessary, perhaps, to inform you, that these two officers\r\ncannot act together, which excludes the hopes of ensuring success by a\r\njoint expedition.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most sincere esteem,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVI.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, June 11, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, June 11, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMajor Galvan, as recommended by your Excellency, was despatched to\r\nhis station without delay, and has been furnished with every thing he\r\ndesired, as far as we were able. The line of expresses formed between\r\nus is such, as will communicate intelligence from one to the other in\r\ntwenty-three hours. I have forwarded to him information of our disasters\r\nin the South, as they have come to me.\r\n\r\nOur intelligence from the southward is most lamentably defective. Though\r\nCharleston has been in the hands of the enemy a month, we hear nothing\r\nof their movements which can be relied on. Rumors are, that they are\r\npenetrating northward. To remedy this defect, I shall immediately\r\nestablish a line of expresses from hence to the neighborhood of\r\ntheir army, and send thither a sensible, judicious person, to give\r\nus information of their movements. This intelligence will, I hope,\r\nbe conveyed to us at the rate of one hundred and twenty miles in the\r\ntwenty-four hours. They set out to their stations to-morrow. I wish it\r\nwere possible, that a like speedy line of communication could be formed\r\nfrom hence to your Excellency’s head-quarters. Perfect and speedy\r\ninformation of what is passing in the South, might put it in your power,\r\nperhaps, to frame your measures by theirs. There is really nothing to\r\noppose the progress of the enemy northward, but the cautious principles\r\nof the military art. North Carolina is without arms. We do not abound.\r\nThose we have, are freely imparted to them; but such is the state of\r\ntheir resources, that they have not been able to move a single musket\r\nfrom this State to theirs. All the wagons we can collect, have been\r\nfurnished to the Marquis de Kalb, and are assembled for the march of\r\ntwenty-five hundred men, under General Stevens, of Culpeper, who will\r\nmove on the 19th instant. I have written to Congress to hasten supplies\r\nof arms and military stores for the southern states, and particularly to\r\naid us with cartridge paper and boxes, the want of which articles, small\r\nas they are, renders our stores useless. The want of money cramps\r\nevery effort. This will be supplied by the most unpalatable of all\r\nsubstitutes, force. Your Excellency will readily conceive, that after\r\nthe loss of one arm, our eyes are turned towards the other, and that\r\nwe comfort ourselves, if any aids can be furnished by you, without\r\ndefeating the operations more beneficial to the general union, they will\r\nbe furnished. At the same time, I am happy to find that the wishes of\r\nthe people go no further, as far as I have an opportunity of learning\r\ntheir sentiments. Could arms be furnished, I think this State and North\r\nCarolina would embody from ten to fifteen thousand militia immediately,\r\nand more if necessary.\r\n\r\nI hope, ere long, to be able to give you a more certain statement of\r\nthe enemy’s as well as our situation, which I shall not fail to do.\r\nI enclose you a letter from Major Galvan, being the second I have\r\nforwarded to you.\r\n\r\nWith sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect,\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s\r\n\r\nmost obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, July 2, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, July 2, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have received from the Committee of Congress, at headquarters, three\r\nletters calling for aids of men and provisions. I beg leave to refer\r\nyou to my letter to them, of this date, on those subjects. I thought it\r\nnecessary, however, to suggest to you the preparing an arrangement of\r\nofficers for the men; for, though they are to supply our battalions,\r\nyet, as our whole line officers, almost, are in captivity, I suppose\r\nsome temporary provision must be made. We cheerfully transfer to you\r\nevery power which the Executive might exercise on this occasion. As it\r\nis possible you may cast your eye on the unemployed officers now within\r\nthe State, I write to General Muhlenburg, to send you a return of them.\r\nI think the men will be rendezvoused within the present month. The bill,\r\nindeed, for raising them is not actually passed, but it is in its last\r\nstage, and no opposition to any essential parts of it. I will take care\r\nto notify you of its passage.\r\n\r\nI have, with great pain, perceived your situation; and, the more so, as\r\nbeing situated between two fires, a division of sentiment has arisen,\r\nboth in Congress and here, as to which the resources of this country\r\nshould be sent. The removal of General Clinton to the northward, must,\r\nof course, have great influence on the determination of this question;\r\nand I have no doubt but considerable aids may be drawn hence for your\r\narmy, unless a larger one should be embodied in the South, than the\r\nforce of the enemy there seems to call for. I have the honor to be, with\r\nevery sentiment of respect and esteem,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s\r\n\r\nmost obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n[See Appendix, Note D.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVIII.--TO GENERAL EDWARD STEVENS, August 4, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL EDWARD STEVENS.\r\n\r\nRichmond, August 4, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour several favors of July the 16th, 21st, and 22nd, are now before me.\r\nOur smiths are engaged in making five hundred axes and some tomahawks\r\nfor General Gates. About one hundred of these will go by the wagons now\r\ntaking in their loads. As these are for the army in general, no doubt\r\nbut you will participate of them. A chest of medicine was made up for\r\nyou in Williamsburg, and by a strange kind of forgetfulness, the vessel\r\nordered to bring that, left it and brought the rest of the shop. It is\r\nsent for again, and I am not without hopes will be here in time to go\r\nby the present wagons. They will carry some ammunition and the axes, and\r\nwill make up their load with spirits. Tents, I fear, cannot be got in\r\nthis country; we have, however, sent out powers to all the trading towns\r\nhere, to take it wherever they can find it. I write to General Gates,\r\nto try whether the duck in North Carolina cannot be procured by the\r\nExecutive of that State on Continental account; for, surely, the whole\r\narmy, as well our militia as the rest, is Continental. The arms you\r\nhave to spare may be delivered to General Gates’s order, taking and\r\nfurnishing us with proper vouchers. We shall endeavor to send our drafts\r\narmed. I cannot conceive how the arms before sent could have got into\r\nso very bad order; they certainly went from hence in good condition. You\r\nwish to know how far the property of this State in your hands is meant\r\nto be subject to the orders of the commander in chief. Arms and military\r\nstores we mean to be perfectly subject to him. The provisions going from\r\nthis country will be for the whole army. If we can get any tents,\r\nthey must be appropriated to the use of our own troops. Medicine, sick\r\nstores, spirits, and such things, we expect shall be on the same footing\r\nas with the northern army. There, you know, each State furnishes its own\r\ntroops with these articles, and, of course, has an exclusive right\r\nto what is furnished. The money put into your hands, was meant as a\r\nparticular resource for any extra wants of our own troops, yet in case\r\nof great distress, you would probably not see the others suffer without\r\ncommunicating part of it for their use. We debit Congress with this\r\nwhole sum. There can be nothing but what is right in your paying\r\nMajor Mazaret’s troops out of it. I wish the plan you have adopted for\r\nsecuring a return of the arms from the militia, may answer. I apprehend\r\nany man, who has a good gun on his shoulder, would agree to keep it, and\r\nhave the worth of it deducted out of his pay, more especially when\r\nthe receipt of the pay is at some distance. What would you think of\r\nnotifying to them, further, that a proper certificate that they are\r\ndischarged, and have _returned their arms_, will be required before\r\nany pay is issued to them. A roll, kept and forwarded, of those\r\nso discharged, and who have delivered up their arms, would supply\r\naccidental losses of their certificates. We are endeavoring to get\r\nbayonet belts made. The State quarter-master affirms the cartouch boxes\r\nsent from this place, (nine hundred and fifty-nine in number,) were all\r\nin good condition. I therefore suppose the three hundred you received in\r\nsuch very bad order, must have gone from the continental quarter-master\r\nat Petersburg, or, perhaps, have been pillaged, on the road, of their\r\nflaps, to mend shoes, &c. I must still press the return of as many\r\nwagons as possible. All you will send, shall be loaded with spirits or\r\nsomething else for the army. By their next return, we shall have a good\r\ndeal of bacon collected. The enclosed is a copy of what was reported to\r\nme, as heretofore sent by the wagons.\r\n\r\nI am. Sir, with the greatest esteem,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIX.--TO MAJOR GENERAL GATES, August 15, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\nRichmond, August 15, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of August 3rd is just now put into my hand. Those formerly\r\nreceived have been duly answered, and my replies will, no doubt, have\r\nreached you before this date. My last letter to you was by Colonel\r\nDrayton.\r\n\r\nI spoke fully with you on the difficulty of procuring wagons here,\r\nwhen I had the pleasure of seeing you, and for that reason pressed\r\nthe sending back as many as possible. One brigade of twelve has since\r\nreturned, and is again on its way with medicine, military stores,\r\nand spirit. Any others which come, and as fast as they come, shall be\r\nreturned to you with spirit and bacon. I have ever been informed,\r\nthat the very plentiful harvests of North Carolina would render the\r\ntransportation of flour from this State, as unnecessary as it would be\r\ntedious, and that, in this point of view, the wagons should carry hence\r\nonly the articles before mentioned, which are equally wanting with you.\r\nFinding that no great number of wagons is likely to return to us, we\r\nwill immediately order as many more to be bought and sent on, as we\r\npossibly can. But to prevent too great expectations, I must again\r\nrepeat, that I fear no great number can be got. I do assure you,\r\nhowever, that neither attention nor expense shall be spared, to forward\r\nto you every support for which we can obtain means of transportation.\r\nYou have, probably, received our order on Colonel Lewis to deliver you\r\nany of the beeves he may have purchased.\r\n\r\nTents, I fear, it is in vain to expect, because there is not in this\r\ncountry stuff to make them. We have agents and commissioners in constant\r\npursuit of stuff, but hitherto researches have been fruitless. Your\r\norder to Colonel Carrington shall be immediately communicated. A\r\nhundred copies of the proclamation shall also be immediately printed\r\nand forwarded to you. General Muhlenburg is come to this place, which\r\nhe will now make his headquarters. I think he will be able to set into\r\nmotion, within a very few days, five hundred regulars, who are now\r\nequipped for their march, except some blankets still wanting, but I hope\r\nnearly procured and ready to be delivered.\r\n\r\nI sincerely congratulate you on your successful advances on the enemy,\r\nand wish to do every thing to second your enterprises, which the\r\nsituation of this country, and the means and powers put into my hands,\r\nenable me to do.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, with sincere respect and esteem,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XX.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, September 8, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, September 8, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAs I know the anxieties you must have felt, since the late misfortune to\r\nthe South, and our latter accounts have not been quite so unfavorable\r\nas the first, I take the liberty of enclosing you a statement of this\r\nunlucky affair, taken from letters from General Gates, General Stevens,\r\nand Governor Nash, and, as to some circumstances, from an officer who\r\nwas in the action.* Another army is collecting; this amounted, on the\r\n23rd ultimo, to between four and five thousand men, consisting of about\r\nfive hundred Maryland regulars, a few of Hamilton’s artillery, and\r\nPorterfield’s corps, Armand’s legion, such of the Virginia militia as\r\nhad been reclaimed, and about three thousand North Carolina militia,\r\nnewly embodied. We are told they will increase these to eight thousand.\r\nOur new recruits will rendezvous in this State between the 10th and 25th\r\ninstant. We are calling out two thousand militia, who, I think, however,\r\nwill not be got to Hillsborough till the 25th of October. About three\r\nhundred and fifty regulars marched from Chesterfield a week ago. Fifty\r\nmarch to-morrow, and there will be one hundred or one hundred and fifty\r\nmore from that post, when they can be cleared of the hospital. This\r\nis as good a view as I can give you of the force we are endeavoring to\r\ncollect; but they are unarmed. Almost the whole small arms seem to have\r\nbeen lost in the late rout. There are here, on their way southwardly,\r\nthree thousand stand of arms, sent by Congress, and we have still a\r\nfew in our magazine. I have written pressingly, as the subject well\r\ndeserves, to Congress, to send immediate supplies, and to think of\r\nforming a magazine here, that in case of another disaster, we may not be\r\nleft without all means of opposition.\r\n\r\n     [* The circumstances of the defeat of General Gates’s army,\r\n     near Camden in August, 1780, being of historical notoriety,\r\n     this statement is omitted.]\r\n\r\nI enclosed to your Excellency, some time ago, a resolution of the\r\nAssembly, instructing us to send a quantity of tobacco to New York for\r\nthe relief of our officers there, and asking the favor of you to obtain\r\npermission. Having received no answer, I fear my letter or your answer\r\nhas miscarried. I therefore take the liberty of repeating my application\r\nto you.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most profound respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXI.--TO GENERAL EDWARD STEVENS, September 12,1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL EDWARD STEVENS.\r\n\r\nRichmond, September 12,1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour letters of August 27th and 30th are now before me. The subsequent\r\ndesertions of your militia have taken away the necessity of answering\r\nthe question, how they shall be armed. On the contrary, as there must\r\nnow be a surplus of arms, I am in hopes you will endeavor to reserve\r\nthem, as we have not here a sufficient number by fifteen hundred or two\r\nthousand, for the men who will march hence, if they march in numbers\r\nequal to our expectations. I have sent expresses into all the counties\r\nfrom which those militia went, requiring the county lieutenants to exert\r\nthemselves in taking them; and such is the detestation with which they\r\nhave been received, that I have heard from many counties they were going\r\nback of themselves. You will of course, hold courts martial on them, and\r\nmake them soldiers for eight months. If you will be so good as to inform\r\nme, from time to time, how many you have, we may, perhaps, get the\r\nsupernumerary officers in the State, to take command of them. By the\r\nsame opportunities, I desired notice to be given to the friends of the\r\nfew remaining with you, that they had lost their clothes and blankets,\r\nand recommended, that they should avail themselves of any good\r\nopportunity to send them supplies.\r\n\r\nWe approve of your accommodating the hospital with medicines, and the\r\nMaryland troops with spirits. They really deserve the whole, and I wish\r\nwe had means of transportation for much greater quantities, which\r\nwe have on hand and cannot convey. This article we could furnish\r\nplentifully to you and them. What is to be done for wagons, I do not\r\nknow. We have not now one shilling in the treasury to purchase them.\r\nWe have ordered an active quarter-master to go to the westward, and\r\nendeavor to purchase on credit, or impress a hundred wagons and teams.\r\nBut I really see no prospect of sending you additional supplies, till\r\nthe same wagons return from you, which we sent on with the last. I\r\ninformed you in my last letter, we had ordered two thousand militia\r\nmore, to rendezvous at Hillsborough on the 25th of October. You will\r\njudge yourself, whether in the mean time you can be more useful by\r\nremaining where you are, with the few militia left and coming in, or by\r\nreturning home, where, besides again accommodating yourself after your\r\nlosses, you may also aid us in getting those men into motion, and in\r\npointing out such things as are within our power, and may be useful to\r\nthe service. And you will act accordingly. I am with great friendship\r\nand esteem, dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXII.--TO GENERAL EDWARD STEVENS, September 15, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL EDWARD STEVENS.\r\n\r\nRichmond, September 15, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI beg leave to trouble you with a private letter, on a little matter\r\nof my own, having no acquaintance at camp, with whom I can take that,\r\nliberty. Among the wagons impressed, for the use of your militia, were\r\ntwo of mine. One of these, I know is safe, having been on its way from\r\nhence to Hillsborough, at the time of the late engagement. The other,\r\nI have reason to believe, was on the field. A wagon-master, who says\r\nhe was near it, informs me the brigade quarter-master cut out one of\r\nmy best horses, and made his escape on him, and that he saw my wagoner\r\nloosening his own horse to come off, but the enemy’s horse were then\r\ncoming up, and he knows nothing further. He was a negro man, named\r\nPhill, lame in one arm and leg. If you will do me the favor to inquire\r\nwhat is become of him, what horses are saved, and to send them to me,\r\nI shall be much obliged to you. The horses were not public property, as\r\nthey were only impressed and not sold. Perhaps your certificate of what\r\nis lost, may be necessary for me. The wagon-master told me, that the\r\npublic money was in my wagon, a circumstance, which, perhaps, may aid\r\nyour inquiries. After apologizing for the trouble, I beg leave to assure\r\nyou, that I am, with great sincerity,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIII.--TO MAJOR GENERAL GATES, September 23, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\nRichmond, September 23, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have empowered Colonel Carrington to have twelve boats, scows, or\r\nbatteaux, built at Taylor’s Ferry, and to draw on me for the cost. I\r\nrecommended the constructing them so as to answer the transportation of\r\nprovisions along that river, as a change of position of the two armies\r\nmay render them unnecessary at Taylor’s Ferry, and I am thoroughly\r\npersuaded, that, unless we can find out some channel of transportation\r\nby water, no supplies of bread, of any consequence can be sent you\r\nfrom this State for a long time to come. The want of wagons is a bar\r\ninsuperable, at least in any reasonable time. I have given orders to\r\nhave Fry and Jefferson’s map, and Henry’s map of Virginia, sought for\r\nand purchased. As soon as they can be got, I will forward them. I have\r\nalso written to General Washington on the subject of wintering the\r\nFrench fleet in the Chesapeake. Our new levies rendezvous in large\r\nnumbers. As General Washington had constituted them in eight battalions,\r\nand allotted none to Colonel Harrison, we think to deliver him about\r\nfour hundred drafts of another kind, who are to serve eighteen months\r\nalso. Unless Congress furnish small arms, we cannot arm more than half\r\nthe men who will go from this State. The prize you mention of tents and\r\nblankets is very fortunate. It is absolutely out of our power to get\r\nthese articles, to any amount, in this country, nor have we clothing for\r\nour new levies. They must, therefore, go to you clothed as militia,\r\ntill we can procure and send on supplies. They will be as warm in their\r\npresent clothing at Hillsborough, as at Chesterfield Court House.\r\n\r\nWe have an agent collecting all the beeves which can be got from the\r\ncounties round about Portsmouth, to send off to you.\r\n\r\nThey have there also plentiful crops of corn growing. We have instructed\r\nhim to try whether means of conveying it down into the Sounds, and up\r\nsome of the rivers of North Carolina, or by land to Meherrin river, and\r\nthence down Chowan, and up Roanoke, cannot be rendered practicable.\r\n\r\nI am, with every sentiment of esteem and respect,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. I enclose a certificate, acknowledging satisfaction for the money\r\nfurnished Colonel Kosciusko. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIV.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, September 23, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, September 23, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI yesterday forwarded to you a letter from Colonel Wood, informing\r\nyou of his situation. That post has, for some time past, been pretty\r\nregularly supplied, and I hope will continue to be for some time to\r\ncome. A person whose punctuality can be relied on, offers to contract\r\nfor victualling it. If we can agree on terms, and the Assembly will\r\nstrengthen our hands sufficiently, we think to adopt that method, as\r\nthe only one to be relied on with certainty. I have heard it hinted\r\nthat Colonel Wood thinks of quitting that post. I should be exceedingly\r\nsorry, indeed, were he to do it. He has given to those under his charge,\r\nthe most perfect satisfaction, and, at the same time, used all the\r\ncautions which the nature of his charge has required. It is principally\r\nowing to his prudence and good temper that the late difficulties have\r\nbeen passed over, almost without a murmur. Any influence which your\r\nExcellency shall think proper to me, for retaining him in his present\r\nsituation, will promote the public good, and have a great tendency to\r\nkeep up a desirable harmony with the officers of that corps. Our new\r\nrecruits are rendezvousing very generally. Colonel Harrison was uneasy\r\nat having none of them assigned to his corps of artillery, who have very\r\nmuch distinguished themselves in the late unfortunate action, and\r\nare reduced almost to nothing. We happened to have about four hundred\r\ndrafts, raised in the last year, and never called out and sent on duty\r\nby their county lieutenants, whom we have collected and are collecting.\r\nWe think to deliver these to Colonel Harrison: they are to serve\r\neighteen months from the time of rendezvous. The numbers of regulars\r\nand militia ordered from this State into the southern service, are\r\nabout seven thousand. I trust we may count that fifty-five hundred\r\nwill actually proceed: but we have arms for three thousand only. If,\r\ntherefore, we do not speedily receive a supply from Congress, we must\r\ncountermand a proper number of these troops. Besides this supply,\r\nthere should certainly be a magazine laid in here, to provide against\r\na general loss as well as daily waste. When we deliver out those now in\r\nour magazine, we shall have sent seven thousand stand of our own into\r\nthe southern service, in the course of this summer. We are still more\r\ndestitute of clothing, tents, and wagons for our troops. The southern\r\narmy suffers for provisions, which we could plentifully supply, were\r\nit possible to find means of transportation. Despairing of this, we\r\ndirected very considerable quantities, collected on the navigable\r\nwaters, to be sent northwardly by the quarter-master. This he is now\r\ndoing; slowly, however. Unapprized what may be proposed by our allies\r\nto be done with their fleet in the course of the ensuing winter, I would\r\nbeg leave to intimate to you, that if it should appear to them eligible\r\nthat it should winter in the Chesapeake, they can be well supplied with\r\nprovisions, taking their necessary measures in due time. The waters\r\ncommunicating with that bay furnish easy, and (in that case) safe\r\ntransportation, and their money will call forth what is denied to ours.\r\n\r\nI am, with all possible esteem and respect, your Excellency’s\r\n\r\nmost obedient and humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXV.--TO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON, September 26,1780\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, September 26,1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe enclosed copy of a letter from Lord Cornwallis [See Appendix, note\r\nE.] to Colonel Balfour, was sent me by Governor Rutledge: lest you\r\nshould not have seen it, I do myself the pleasure of transmitting\r\nit, with a letter from General Harrington to General Gates giving\r\ninformation of some late movements of the enemy.\r\n\r\nI was honored yesterday with your favor of the 5th instant, on the\r\nsubject of prisoners, and particularly Lieutenant Governor Hamilton. You\r\nare not unapprized of the influence of this officer with the Indians,\r\nhis activity and embittered zeal against us. You also, perhaps, know how\r\nprecarious is our tenure of the Illinois country, and how critical\r\nis the situation of the new counties on the Ohio. These circumstances\r\ndetermined us to detain Governor Hamilton and Major Hay within\r\nour power, when we delivered up the other prisoners. On a late\r\nrepresentation from the people of Kentucky, by a person sent here from\r\nthat country, and expressions of what they had reason to apprehend from\r\nthese two prisoners, in the event of their liberation, we assured\r\nthem they would not be parted with, though we were giving up our other\r\nprisoners. Lieutenant Colonel Dabusson, aid to Baron de Kalb, lately\r\ncame here on his parole, with an offer from Lord Rawdon, to exchange\r\nhim for Hamilton. Colonel Towles is now here with a like proposition\r\nfor himself, from General Phillips, very strongly urged by the General.\r\nThese, and other overtures, do not lessen our opinion of the importance\r\nof retaining him; and they have been, and will be, uniformly rejected.\r\nShould the settlement, indeed, of a cartel become impracticable, without\r\nthe consent of the States to submit their separate prisoners to its\r\nobligation, we will give up these two prisoners, as we would any thing,\r\nrather than be an obstacle to a general good. But no other circumstance\r\nwould, I believe, extract them from us. These two gentlemen, with a\r\nLieutenant Colonel Elligood, are the only separate prisoners we have\r\nretained, and the last, only on his own request, and not because we set\r\nany store by him. There is, indeed, a Lieutenant Governor Rocheblawe of\r\nKaskaskia, who has broken his parole and gone to New York, whom we must\r\nshortly trouble your Excellency to demand for us, as soon as we can\r\nforward to you the proper documents. Since the forty prisoners sent\r\nto Winchester, as mentioned in my letter of the 9th ultimo, about one\r\nhundred and fifty more have been sent thither, some of them taken by us\r\nat sea, others sent on by General Gates.\r\n\r\nThe exposed and weak state of our western settlements, and the danger\r\nto which they are subject from the northern Indians, acting under the\r\ninfluence of the British post at Detroit, render it necessary for us to\r\nkeep from five to eight hundred men on duty for their defence. This is a\r\ngreat and perpetual expense. Could that post be reduced and retained,\r\nit would cover all the States to the southeast of it. We have long\r\nmeditated the attempt under the direction of Colonel Clarke, but the\r\nexpense would be so great, that whenever we have wished to take it up,\r\nthis circumstance has obliged us to decline it. Two different estimates\r\nmake it amount to two millions of pounds, present money. We could\r\nfurnish the men, provisions, and every necessary, except powder, had\r\nwe the money, or could the demand from us be so far supplied from\r\nother quarters, as to leave it in our power to apply such a sum to that\r\npurpose; and, when once done, it would save annual expenditures to a\r\ngreat amount. When I speak of furnishing the men, I mean they should be\r\nmilitia; such being the popularity of Colonel Clarke, and the confidence\r\nof the western people in him, that he could raise the requisite number\r\nat any time. We, therefore, beg leave to refer this matter to yourself,\r\nto determine whether such an enterprise would not be for the general\r\ngood, and if you think it would, to authorize it at the general\r\nexpense. This is become the more reasonable, if, as I understand, the\r\nratification of the Confederation has been rested on our cession of a\r\npart of our western claim; a cession which (speaking my private opinion)\r\nI verily believe will be agreed to, if the quantity demanded is not\r\nunreasonably great. Should this proposition be approved of, it should be\r\nimmediately made known to us, as the season is now coming on, at which\r\nsome of the preparations must be made. The time of execution, I think,\r\nshould be at the time of the breaking up of the ice in the Wabash, and\r\nbefore the lakes open. The interval, I am told, is considerable.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, &c.\r\n\r\nyour most obedient and humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVI.--TO MAJOR GENERAL GATES, October 4, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\nRichmond, October 4, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy letter of September 23rd answered your favors received before that\r\ndate, and the present serves to acknowledge the receipt of those of\r\nSeptember 24th and 27th. I retain in mind, and recur, almost daily, to\r\nyour requisitions of August; we have, as yet, no prospect of more than\r\none hundred tents. Flour is ordered to be manufactured, as soon as the\r\nseason will render it safe; out of which, I trust, we can furnish not\r\nonly your requisition of August, but that of Congress of September 11th.\r\nThe corn you desire, we could furnish when the new crops come in, fully,\r\nif water transportation can be found; if not, we shall be able only\r\nto send you what lies convenient to the southern boundary, in which\r\nneighborhood the crops have been much abridged by a flood in Roanoke. We\r\nhave no rice. Rum and other spirits, we can furnish to a greater amount\r\nthan you require, as soon as our wagons are in readiness, and shall\r\nbe glad to commute into that article some others which we have not,\r\nparticularly sugar, coffee, and salt. The vinegar is provided. Colonel\r\nFinnie promised to furnish to Colonel Muter, a list of the shades, hoes,\r\n&c. which could be furnished from the Continental stores. This list has\r\nnever yet come to hand. It is believed the Continental stores here will\r\nfall little short of your requisition, except in the article of axes,\r\nwhich our shops are proceeding on. Your information of September 24th,\r\nas to the quality of the axes, has been notified to the workmen, and\r\nwill, I hope, have a proper effect on those made hereafter. Application\r\nhas been made to the courts, to have the bridges put in a proper state,\r\nwhich they have promised to do. We are endeavoring again to collect\r\nwagons. About twenty are nearly finished at this place. We employed,\r\nabout three weeks ago, agents to purchase, in the western counties, a\r\nhundred wagons and teams. Till these can be got, it will be impossible\r\nto furnish any thing from this place. I am exceedingly pleased to hear\r\nof your regulation for stopping our wagons at Roanoke. This will put\r\nit in our power to repair and replace them, to calculate their returns,\r\nprovide loads, and will be a great encouragement to increase their\r\nnumber, if possible, as their departure hence will no longer produce the\r\nidea of a final adieu to them.\r\n\r\nColonel Senf arrived here the evening before the last. He was employed\r\nyesterday and to-day, in copying some actual and accurate surveys, which\r\nwe had had made of the country round about Portsmouth, as far as Cape\r\nHenry to the eastward, Nansemond river to the westward, the Dismal Swamp\r\nto the southward, and northwardly, the line of country from Portsmouth\r\nby Hampton and York to Williamsburg, and including the vicinities of\r\nthese three last posts. This will leave him nothing to do, but to take\r\ndrawings of particular places, and the soundings of such waters as he\r\nthinks material. He will proceed on this business to-morrow, with a\r\nletter to General Nelson, and powers to call for the attendance of a\r\nproper vessel.\r\n\r\nI suppose that your drafts in favor of the quarter-master, if attended\r\nwith sixty days’ grace, may be complied with to a certain amount. We\r\nwill certainly use our best endeavors to answer them. I have only to\r\ndesire that they may be made payable to the quarter-master alone, and\r\nnot to the bearer. This is to prevent the mortification of seeing an\r\nunapprized individual taken in by an assignment of them, as if they\r\nwere ready money. Your letter to Colonel Finnie will go to Williamsburg\r\nimmediately. Those to Congress, with a copy of the papers enclosed to\r\nme, went yesterday by express. I will take order as to the bacon you\r\nmention. I fear there is little of it, and that not capable of being\r\nlong kept. You are surely not uninformed, that Congress required the\r\ngreater part of this article to be sent northward, which has been\r\ndone. I hope, by this time, you receive supplies of beeves from our\r\ncommissary, Mr. Eaton, who was sent three weeks or a month ago, to\r\nexhaust of that article the counties below, and in the neighborhood of\r\nPortsmouth; and from thence, was to proceed to other counties, in order,\r\nas they stood exposed to an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the French West India fleet (which, though not\r\nauthentically communicated, seems supported by so many concurring\r\naccounts from individuals, as to leave scarcely room for doubt,) will,\r\nI hope, prevent the enemy from carrying into effect the embarkation they\r\nhad certainly intended from New York, though they are strengthened by\r\nthe arrival of Admiral Rodney, at that place, with twelve sail of the\r\nline and four frigates, as announced by General Washington to Congress,\r\non the 19th ultimo. The accounts of the additional French fleet are\r\nvaried from sixteen to nineteen ships of the line, besides frigates. The\r\nnumber of the latter has never been mentioned. The extracts of\r\nletters, which you will see in our paper of this day, are from General\r\nWashington, President Huntington, and our Delegates in Congress to me.\r\nThat from Bladensburg is from a particular acquaintance of mine, whose\r\ncredit cannot be doubted. The distress we are experiencing from want\r\nof leather to make shoes, is great. I am sure you have thought of\r\npreventing it in future, by the appointment of a commissary of hides, or\r\nsome other good regulation for saving and tanning the hides, which the\r\nconsumption of your army will afford.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with all possible esteem and respect, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVII.--TO GENERAL GATES, October 15, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\nRichmond, October 15, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am rendered not a little anxious by the paragraph of yours of the\r\n7th instant, wherein you say, ‘It is near a month since I received any\r\nletter from your Excellency; indeed, the receipt of most that I have\r\nwritten to you, remains unacknowledged.’ You ought, within that time, to\r\nhave received my letter of September the 3rd, written immediately on my\r\nreturn to this place, after a fortnight’s absence; that of September the\r\n11th, acknowledging the receipt of yours which covered drafts for money;\r\nthat of September the 23rd, on the subject of batteaux at Taylor’s\r\nFerry, wagons, maps of Virginia, wintering the French fleet in the\r\nChesapeake, our new levies, and provisions from our lower counties; and\r\nthat of October the 4th, in answer to yours of September the 24th\r\nand 27th. I begin to apprehend treachery in some part of our chain of\r\nexpresses, and beg the favor of you, in your next, to mention whether\r\nany, and which of these letters have come to hand. This acknowledges the\r\nreceipt of yours of September the 28th, and October the 3rd, 5th, and\r\n7th. The first of these was delivered four or five days ago by Captain\r\nDrew. He will be permitted to return as you desire, as we would fulfil\r\nyour wishes in every point in our power, as well as indulge the ardor of\r\na good officer. Our militia from the western counties are now on their\r\nmarch to join you. They are fond of the kind of service in which Colonel\r\nMorgan is generally engaged, and are made very happy by being informed\r\nyou intend to put them under him. Such as pass by this place, take\r\nmuskets in their hands. Those from the,southern counties, beyond the\r\nBlue Ridge, were advised to carry their rifles. For those who carry\r\nneither rifles nor muskets, as well as for our eighteen months men, we\r\nshall send on arms as soon as wagons can be procured. In the mean time,\r\nI had hoped that there were arms for those who should first arrive at\r\nHillsborough, as by General Steven’s return, dated at his departure\r\nthence, there were somewhere between five and eight hundred muskets (I\r\nspeak from memory, not having present access to the return) belonging\r\nto this State, either in the hands of the few militia who were there,\r\nor stored. Captain Fauntleroy, of the cavalry, gives me hopes he shall\r\nimmediately forward a very considerable supply of accoutrements, for\r\nWhite’s and Washington’s cavalry. He told me yesterday he had received\r\none hundred and thirteen horses for that service, from us. Besides\r\nthese, he had rejected sixty odd, after we had purchased them, at £3000\r\napiece. Nelson’s two troops were returned to me, deficient only twelve\r\nhorses, since which, ten have been sent to him by Lieutenant Armstead.\r\nI am not a little disappointed, therefore, in the number of cavalry fit\r\nfor duty, as mentioned in the letter you enclosed me. Your request (as\r\nstated in your letter of the 7th) that we will send no men into the\r\nfield, or even to your camp, that are not well furnished with shoes,\r\nblankets, and every necessary for immediate service, would amount to a\r\nstoppage of every man; as we have it not in our power to furnish them\r\nwith real necessaries completely. I hope they will be all shod. What\r\nproportion will have blankets I cannot say: we purchase every one which\r\ncan be found out; and now I begin to have a prospect of furnishing about\r\nhalf of them with tents, as soon as they can be made and forwarded. As\r\nto provisions, our agent, Eaton, of whom I before wrote, informs me in\r\na letter of the 5th instant, he shall immediately get supplies of beef\r\ninto motion, and shall send some corn by a circuitous navigation. But\r\ntill we receive our wagons from the western country, I cannot hope to\r\naid you in bread. I expect daily to see wagons coming in to us. The\r\nmilitia were ordered to rendezvous at Hillsborough, expecting they would\r\nthence be ordered by you into service. I send you herewith a copy of\r\nHenry’s map of Virginia. It is a mere _cento_ of blunders. It may serve\r\nto give you a general idea of the courses of rivers, and positions of\r\ncounties. We are endeavoring to get you a copy of Fry and Jefferson’s;\r\nbut they are now very scarce. I also enclose you some newspapers, in\r\nwhich you will find a detail of Arnold’s apostacy and villany.\r\n\r\nI am, with all sentiments of sincere respect and esteem, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\nP. S. Just as I was closing my letter, yours of the 9th instant was\r\nput into my hands. I enclose by this express, a power to Mr. Lambe,\r\nquarter-master, to impress, for a month, ten wagons from each of the\r\ncounties of Brunswick, Mecklenburg, Lunenburg, Charlotte, and Halifax,\r\nand direct him to take your orders, whether they shall go first to you,\r\nor come here. If the latter, we can load them with arms and spirits.\r\nBefore their month is out, I hope the hundred wagons from the westward\r\nwill have come in. We will otherwise provide a relief for these. I am\r\nperfectly astonished at your not having yet received my letters before\r\nmentioned. I send you a copy of that of the 4th of October, as being\r\nmost material. I learn, from one of General Muhlenburg’s family, that\r\nfive wagons have set out from hence, with three hundred stand of arms,\r\n&c. However, the General writes to you himself. T.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVIII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, October 22, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, October 22, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have this morning received certain information of the arrival of a\r\nhostile fleet in our bay, of about sixty sail. The debarkation of some\r\nlight-horse, in the neighborhood of Portsmouth, seems to indicate that\r\nas the first scene of action. We are endeavoring to collect as large a\r\nbody to oppose them as we can arm: this will be lamentably inadequate,\r\nif the enemy be in any force. It is mortifying to suppose that a people,\r\nable and zealous to contend with their enemy, should be reduced to fold\r\ntheir arms for want of the means of defence. Yet no resources, that we\r\nknow of, ensure us against this event. It has become necessary to divert\r\nto this new object, a considerable part of the aids we had destined\r\nfor General Gates. We are still, however, sensible of the necessity\r\nof supporting him, and have left that part of our country nearest him\r\nuncalled on, at present, that they may reinforce him as soon as arms\r\ncan be received. We have called to the command of our forces, Generals\r\nWeeden and Muhlenburg, of the line, and Nelson and Stevens of the\r\nmilitia. You will be pleased to make to these such additions as you may\r\nthink proper. As to the aids of men, I ask for none, knowing that if the\r\nlate detachment of the enemy shall have left it safe for you to spare\r\naids of that kind, you will not await my application. Of the troops\r\nwe shall raise, there is not a single man who ever saw the face of an\r\nenemy. Whether the Convention troops will be removed or not, is yet\r\nundetermined. This must depend on the force of the enemy, and the aspect\r\nof their movements.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient,\r\n\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIX.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, October 25,1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, October 25,1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of enclosing to you letters from Governor Hamilton,\r\nfor New York. On some representations received by Colonel Towles, that\r\nan indulgence to Governor Hamilton and his companions to go to New York,\r\non parole, would produce the happiest,effect on the situation of our\r\nofficers in Long Island, we have given him, Major Hay, and some of the\r\nsame party at Winchester, leave to go there on parole. The two former go\r\nby water, the latter by land.\r\n\r\nBy this express I hand on, from General Gates to Congress, intelligence\r\nof the capture of Augusta, in Georgia, with considerable quantities of\r\ngoods; and information, which carries a fair appearance, of the taking\r\nof Georgetown, in South Carolina, by a party of ours, and that an army\r\nof six thousand French and Spaniards had landed at Sunbury. This is\r\nthe more credible, as Cornwallis retreated from Charlotte on the 12th\r\ninstant, with great marks of precipitation. Since my last to you,\r\ninforming you of an enemy’s fleet, they have landed eight hundred men\r\nin the neighborhood of Portsmouth, and some more on the bay side of\r\nPrincess Anne. One thousand infantry landed at New-ports-news, on the\r\nmorning of the 23rd, and immediately took possession of Hampton. The\r\nhorse were proceeding up the road. Such a corps as Major Lee’s would be\r\nof infinite service to us. Next to a naval force, horse seems to be the\r\nmost capable of protecting a country so intersected by waters.\r\n\r\nI am, with the most sincere esteem,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXX.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, October 26, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, October 26, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe Executive of this State think it expedient, under our present\r\ncircumstances, that the prisoners of war under the Convention\r\nof Saratoga, be removed from their present situation. It will be\r\nimpossible, as long as they remain with us, to prevent the hostile army\r\nfrom being reinforced by numerous desertions from this corps; and this\r\nexpectation may be one among the probable causes of this movement of the\r\nenemy. Should, moreover, a rescue of them be attempted, the extensive\r\ndisaffection which has of late been discovered, and the almost total\r\nwant of arms in the hands of our good people, render the success of such\r\nan enterprise by no means desperate. The fear of this, and the dangerous\r\nconvulsions to which such an attempt would expose us, divert the\r\nattention of a very considerable part of our militia, from an opposition\r\nto an invading enemy. An order has been, therefore, this day issued to\r\nColonel Wood, to take immediate measures for their removal; and every\r\naid has been and will be given him, for transporting, guarding, and\r\nsubsisting them on the road, which our powers can accomplish. Notice\r\nhereof is sent to his Excellency Governor Lee, on whose part, I doubt\r\nnot, necessary preparations will be made.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem and respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXI.--TO GENERAL GATES, October 28, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\nRichmond, October 28, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour letters of the 14th, 20th, and 21st have come to hand, and your\r\ndespatches to Congress have been regularly forwarded. I shall attend\r\nto the caveat against Mr. Ochiltree’s bill. Your letter to Colonel Senf\r\nremains still in my hands, as it did not come till the enemy had taken\r\npossession of the ground, on which I knew him to have been, and I have\r\nsince no certain information where a letter might surely find him. My\r\nproposition as to your bills in favor of the quarter-master, referred\r\nto yours of September 27th. I have notified to the Continental\r\nquarter-master, your advance of nine hundred dollars to Cooper. As yet,\r\nwe have received no wagons. I wish Mr. Lambe may have supplied you.\r\nShould those from the western quarter not come in, we will authorize him\r\nor some other, to procure a relief, in time, for those first impressed.\r\nWe are upon the eve of a new arrangement as to our commissary’s and\r\nquarter-master’s departments, as the want of money, introducing its\r\nsubstitute, force, requires the establishment of a different kind of\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nSince my first information to you of the arrival of an enemy, they have\r\nlanded about eight hundred men near Portsmouth, some on the bay side of\r\nPrincess Anne, one thousand at Hampton, and still retained considerable\r\npart on board their ships. Those at Hampton, after committing horrid\r\ndepredations, have again retired to their ships, which, on the evening\r\nof the 26th, were strung along the Road from New-ports-news, to the\r\nmouth of Nansemond, which seems to indicate an intention of coming\r\nup James river. Our information is, that they have from four to five\r\nthousand men, commanded by General Leslie, and that they have come under\r\nconvoy of one forty-gun ship, and some frigates (how many, has never\r\nbeen said), commanded by Commodore Rodney. Would it not be worth while\r\nto send out a swift boat from some of the inlets of Carolina, to notify\r\nthe French Admiral that his enemies are in a net, if he has leisure to\r\nclose the mouth of it? Generals Muhlenburg and Nelson are assembling a\r\nforce to be ready for them, and General Weeden has come to this place,\r\nwhere he is at present employed in some arrangements. We have ordered\r\nthe removal of the Saratoga prisoners, that we may have our hands clear\r\nfor these new guests.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, November 3,1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, November 3,1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nSince I had the honor of writing to your Excellency, on the 25th ultimo,\r\nthe enemy have withdrawn their forces from the north side of James\r\nriver, and have taken post at Portsmouth, which, we learn, they are\r\nfortifying. Their highest post is Suffolk, where there is a very narrow\r\nand defensible pass between Nansemond river and the Dismal Swamp,\r\nwhich covers the country below, from being entered by us. More accurate\r\ninformation of their force, than we at first had, gives us reason to\r\nsuppose them to be from twenty-five hundred to three thousand strong,\r\nof which, between sixty and seventy are cavalry. They are commanded by\r\nGeneral Leslie, and were convoyed by the Romulus, of forty guns, the\r\nBlonde, of thirty-two guns, the Delight sloop, of sixteen, a twenty-gun\r\nship of John Goodwick’s, and two row-galleys, commanded by Commodore\r\nGrayton. We are not assured, as yet, that they have landed their whole\r\nforce. Indeed, they give out themselves, that after drawing the force\r\nof this State to Suffolk, they mean, to go to Baltimore. Their movements\r\nhad induced me to think they came with an expectation of meeting with\r\nLord Cornwallis in this country, that his precipitate retreat has left\r\nthem without a concerted object, and that they were waiting further\r\norders. Information of this morning says, that being informed of Lord\r\nCornwallis’s retreat, and a public paper having been procured by\r\nthem, wherein were printed the several despatches which brought this\r\nintelligence from General Gates, they unladed a vessel and sent, her off\r\nto Charleston immediately. The fate of this army of theirs hangs on a\r\nvery slender naval force, indeed.\r\n\r\nThe want of barracks at Fort Frederick, as represented by Colonel Wood,\r\nthe difficulty of getting wagons sufficient to move the whole Convention\r\ntroops, and the state of uneasiness in which the regiment of guards is,\r\nhave induced me to think it would be better to move these troops in\r\ntwo divisions; and as the whole danger of desertion to the enemy, and\r\ncorrespondence with the disaffected in our southern counties, is from\r\nthe British only (for from the Germans we have no apprehensions on\r\neither head), we have advised Colonel Wood to move on the British in the\r\nfirst division, and to leave the Germans in their present situation, to\r\nform a second division, when barracks may be erected at Fort Frederick.\r\nBy these means, the British may march immediately under the guard of\r\nColonel Crochet’s battalion, while Colonel Taylor’s regiment of guards\r\nremains with the Germans. I cannot suppose this will be deemed such\r\na separation as is provided against by the Convention, nor that their\r\nofficers will wish to have the whole troops crowded into barracks,\r\nprobably not sufficient for half of them. Should they, however, insist\r\non their being kept together, I suppose it would be the opinion that the\r\nsecond division should follow the first as soon as possible, and that\r\ntheir being exposed, in that case, to a want of covering, would be\r\njustly imputable to themselves only. The delay of the second division\r\nwill lessen the distress for provisions, which may, perhaps, take\r\nplace on their first going to the new post, before matters are properly\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, November 10, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, November 10, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI enclose your Excellency a copy of an intercepted letter from Major\r\nGeneral Leslie to Lord Cornwallis. [See Appendix, note F.] It was taken\r\nfrom a person endeavoring to pass through the country from Portsmouth\r\ntowards Carolina. When apprehended, and a proposal made to search him,\r\nhe readily consented to be searched, but, at the same time, was observed\r\nto put his hand into his pocket and carry something towards his mouth,\r\nas if it were a quid of tobacco: it was examined, and found to be a\r\nletter, of which the enclosed is a copy, written on silk paper, rolled\r\nup in gold-beater’s skin, and nicely tied at each end, so as not to be\r\nlarger than a goose quill. As this is the first authentic disclosure of\r\ntheir purpose in coming here, and may serve to found, with somewhat more\r\nof certainty, conjectures respecting their future movements, while their\r\ndisappointment in not meeting with Lord Cornwallis may occasion\r\nnew plans at New York, I thought it worthy of communication to your\r\nExcellency.\r\n\r\nSome deserters were taken yesterday, said to be of the British\r\nConvention troops, who had found means to get to the enemy at\r\nPortsmouth, and were seventy or eighty miles on their way back to the\r\nbarracks, when they were taken. They were passing under the guise of\r\ndeserters from Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem and respect,\r\n\r\nyour Exellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIV.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, November 26, 1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, November 26, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have been honored with your Excellency’s letter of the 8th instant.\r\nHaving found it impracticable to move, suddenly, the whole Convention\r\ntroops, British and German, and it being represented that there could\r\nnot, immediately, be covering provided for them all at Fort Frederick,\r\nwe concluded to march off the British first, from whom was the principal\r\ndanger of desertion, and to permit the Germans, who show little\r\ndisposition to join the enemy, to remain in their present quarters till\r\nsomething further be done. The British, accordingly, marched the 20th\r\ninstant. They cross the Blue Ridge at Rock Fish gap, and proceed along\r\nthat valley. I am to apprize your Excellency, that the officers of\r\nevery rank, both British and German, but particularly the former, have\r\npurchased within this State some of the finest horses in it. You will be\r\npleased to determine, whether it be proper that they carry them within\r\ntheir lines. I believe the Convention of Saratoga entitles them to keep\r\nthe horses they then had. But I presume none of the line below the rank\r\nof field-officers, had a horse. Considering the British will be now at\r\nFort Frederick, and the Germans in Albemarle, Alexandria seems to be\r\nthe most central point to which there is navigation. Would it not,\r\ntherefore, be better that the flag-vessel, solicited by General\r\nPhillips, should go to that place? It is about equally distant from the\r\ntwo posts. The roads to Albemarle are good. I know not how those are\r\nwhich lead to Fort Frederick. Your letter referring me to General Green,\r\nfor the mode of constructing light, portable boats, unfortunately did\r\nnot come to hand till he had left us. We had before determined to have\r\nsomething done in that way, and as they are still unexecuted, we should\r\nbe greatly obliged by any draughts or hints, which could be given by any\r\nperson within the reach of your Excellency.\r\n\r\nI received advice, that on the 22nd instant, the enemy’s fleet got all\r\nunder way, and were standing toward the Capes: as it still remained\r\nundecided, whether they would leave the bay, or turn up it, I waited the\r\nnext stage of information, that you might so far be enabled to judge of\r\ntheir destination. This I hourly expected, but it did not come till this\r\nevening, when I am informed they all got out to sea in the night of the\r\n22nd. What course they steered afterwards, is not known. I must do their\r\nGeneral and Commander the justice to say, that in every case to which\r\ntheir attention and influence could reach, as far as I have been\r\nwell-informed, their conduct was such as does them the greatest honor.\r\nIn the few instances of wanton and unnecessary devastation, they\r\npunished the aggressors.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s\r\n\r\nmost obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXV.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, December 15,1780\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, December 15,1780.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of writing to your Excellency on the subject of an\r\nexpedition contemplated by this State, against the British post at\r\nDetroit, and of receiving your answer of October the 10th. Since the\r\ndate of my letter, the face of things has so far changed, as to leave\r\nit no longer optional in us to attempt or decline the expedition, but\r\ncompels us to decide in the affirmative, and to begin our preparations\r\nimmediately. The army the enemy at present have in the South, the\r\nreinforcements still expected there, and their determination to direct\r\ntheir future exertions to that quarter, are not unknown to you. The\r\nregular force proposed on our part to counteract those exertions, is\r\nsuch, either from the real or supposed inability of this State, as by no\r\nmeans to allow a hope that it may be effectual. It is, therefore, to\r\nbe expected that the scene of war will either be within our country, or\r\nvery nearly advanced to it; and that our principal dependence is to be\r\non militia, for which reason it becomes incumbent to keep as great a\r\nproportion of our people as possible, free to act in that quarter. In\r\nthe mean time, a combination is forming in the westward, which, if not\r\ndiverted, will call thither a principal and most valuable part of our\r\nmilitia. From intelligence received, we have reason to expect that a\r\nconfederacy of British and Indians, to the amount of two thousand men,\r\nis formed for the purpose of spreading destruction and dismay through\r\nthe whole extent of our frontier, in the ensuing spring. Should this\r\ntake place, we shall certainly lose in the South all aids of militia\r\nbeyond the Blue Ridge, besides the inhabitants who must fall a sacrifice\r\nin the course of the savage irruptions.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be but one method of preventing this, which is to give\r\nthe western enemy employment in their own country. The regular force\r\nColonel Clarke already has, with a proper draft from the militia beyond\r\nthe Allegany, and that of three or four of our most northern counties,\r\nwill be adequate to the reduction of Fort Detroit, in the opinion\r\nof Colonel Clarke; and he assigns the most probable reasons for that\r\nopinion. We have, therefore, determined to undertake it, and commit\r\nit to his direction. Whether the expense of the enterprise shall\r\nbe defrayed by the Continent or State, we will leave to be decided\r\nhereafter by Congress, in whose justice we can confide as to the\r\ndetermination. In the mean time, we only ask the loan of such\r\nnecessaries as, being already at Fort Pitt, will save time and an\r\nimmense expense of transportation. These articles shall either be\r\nidentically or specifically returned; should we prove successful, it is\r\nnot improbable they may be where Congress would choose to keep them. I\r\nam, therefore, to solicit your Excellency’s order to the commandant at\r\nFort Pitt, for the articles contained on the annexed list, which shall\r\nnot be called for until every thing is in readiness; after which, there\r\ncan be no danger of their being wanted for the post at which they are:\r\nindeed, there are few of the articles essential for the defence of the\r\npost.\r\n\r\nI hope your Excellency will think yourself justified in lending us this\r\naid without awaiting the effect of an application elsewhere, as such\r\na delay would render the undertaking abortive, by postponing it to the\r\nbreaking up of the ice in the lake. Independent of the favorable effects\r\nwhich a successful enterprise against Detroit must produce to the United\r\nStates in general, by keeping in quiet the frontier of the northern\r\nones, and leaving our western militia at liberty to aid those of the\r\nSouth, we think the like friendly offices performed by us to the Sates,\r\nwhenever desired, and almost to the absolute exhausture of our own\r\nmagazines, give well founded hopes that we may be accommodated on this\r\noccasion. The supplies of military stores which have been furnished by\r\nus to Fort Pitt itself, to the northern army, and, most of all, to the\r\nsouthern, are not altogether unknown to you. I am the more urgent for\r\nan immediate order, because Colonel Clarke awaits here your Excellency’s\r\nanswer by the express, though his presence in the western country to\r\nmake preparations for the expedition is so very necessary, if you enable\r\nhim to undertake it. To the above, I must add a request to you to send\r\nfor us to Pittsburg, persons proper to work the mortars, &c, as Colonel\r\nClarke has none such, nor is there one in this State. They shall be in\r\nthe pay of this State from the time they leave you. Any money necessary\r\nfor their journey, shall be repaid at Pittsburg, without fail, by the\r\nfirst of March.\r\n\r\nAt the desire of the General Assembly, I take the liberty of\r\ntransmitting to you the enclosed resolution; and have the honor to be,\r\nwith the most perfect esteem and regard,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVI.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, January 10, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, January 10, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIt may seem odd, considering the important events which have taken place\r\nin this State within the course of ten days, that I should not have\r\ntransmitted an account of them to your Excellency; but such has been\r\ntheir extraordinary rapidity, and such the unremitted attention they\r\nhave required from all concerned in government, that I do not recollect\r\nthe portion of time which I could have taken to commit them to paper.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of December, a letter from a private gentleman to General\r\nNelson came to my hands, notifying, that in the morning of the preceding\r\nday, twenty-seven sail of vessels had entered the Capes; and from\r\nthe tenor of the letter, we had reason to expect, within a few hours,\r\nfurther intelligence; whether they were friends or foes, their force,\r\nand other circumstances. We immediately despatched General Nelson to the\r\nlower country, with powers to call on the militia in that quarter,\r\nor act otherwise as exigencies should require; but waited further\r\nintelligence, before we would call for militia from the middle or upper\r\ncountry. No further intelligence came till the 2nd instant, when the\r\nformer was confirmed; it was ascertained they had advanced up James\r\nriver to Wanasqueak bay. All arrangements were immediately taken for\r\ncalling in a sufficient body of militia for opposition. In the night of\r\nthe 3rd, we received advice that they were at anchor opposite Jamestown;\r\nwe then supposed Williamsburg to be their object. The wind, however,\r\nwhich had hitherto been unfavorable, shifted fair, and the tide being\r\nalso in their favor, they ascended the river to Kennons’ that evening,\r\nand, with the next tide, came up to Westover, having, on their way,\r\ntaken possession of some works we had at Hood’s, by which two or three\r\nof their vessels received some damage, but which were of necessity\r\nabandoned by the small garrison of fifty men placed there, on the\r\nenemy’s landing to invest the works. Intelligence of their having\r\nquitted the station at Jamestown, from which we supposed they meant\r\nto land for Williamsburg, and of their having got in the evening to\r\nKennon’s, reached us the next morning at five o’clock, and was the\r\nfirst indication of their meaning to penetrate towards this place or\r\nPetersburg. As the order for drawing miliatia here had been given but\r\ntwo days, no opposition was in readiness. Every effort was therefore\r\nnecessary, to withdraw the arms and other military stores, records, &c.\r\nfrom this place. Every effort was, accordingly, exerted to convey them\r\nto the foundery five miles, and to a laboratory six miles, above this\r\nplace, till about sunset of that day, when we learned the enemy had come\r\nto an anchor at Westover that morning. We then knew that this, and not\r\nPetersburg was their object, and began to carry across the river every\r\nthing remaining here, and to remove what had been transported to the\r\nfoundery and laboratory to Westham, the nearest crossing, seven miles\r\nabove this place, which operation was continued till they had approached\r\nvery near. They marched from Westover, at two o’clock in the afternoon\r\nof the 4th, and entered Richmond at one o’clock in the afternoon of\r\nthe 5th. A regiment of infantry and about thirty horse continued on,\r\nwithout halting, to the foundery. They burnt that, the boring mill, the\r\nmagazine, and two other houses, and proceeded to Westharn; but nothing\r\nbeing in their power there, they retired to Richmond. The next morning\r\nthey burned some buildings of public and private property, with what\r\nstores remained in them, destroyed a great quantity of private stores,\r\nand about twelve o’clock, retired towards Westover, where they encamped\r\nwithin the Neck, the next day.\r\n\r\nThe loss sustained is not yet accurately known. As far as I have been\r\nable to discover, it consisted, at this place, of about three\r\nhundred muskets, some soldiers’ clothing to a small amount, some\r\nquarter-master’s stores, of which one hundred and twenty sides of\r\nleather was the principal article, part of the artificers’ tools, and\r\nthree wagons. Besides which, five brass four-pounders, which we had sunk\r\nin the river, were discovered to them, raised and carried off. At\r\nthe foundery, we lost the greater part of the papers belonging to the\r\nAuditor’s office, and of the books and papers of the Council office.\r\nAbout five or six tons of powder, as we conjecture, was thrown into the\r\ncanal, of which there will be a considerable saving by re-manufacturing\r\nit. The roof of the foundery was burned, but the stacks of chimneys and\r\nfurnaces not at all injured. The boring mill was consumed. Within less\r\nthan forty-eight hours from the time of their landing, and nineteen from\r\nour knowing their destination, they had penetrated thirty-three miles,\r\ndone the whole injury, and retired. Their numbers, from the best\r\nintelligence I have had, are about fifteen hundred infantry, and as to\r\ntheir cavalry, accounts vary from fifty to one hundred and twenty; and\r\nthe whole commanded by the parricide Arnold. Our militia, dispersed over\r\na large tract of country, can be called in but slowly. On the day the\r\nenemy advanced to this place, two hundred only were embodied. They were\r\nof this town and its neighborhood, and were too few to do any thing.\r\nAt this time, they are assembled in pretty considerable numbers on the\r\nsouth side of James river, but are not yet brought to a point. On the\r\nnorth side are two or three small bodies, amounting in the whole to\r\nabout nine hundred men. The enemy were, at four o’clock yesterday\r\nevening, still remaining in their encampment at Westover and Berkeley\r\nNeck. In the mean while, Baron Steuben, a zealous friend, has descended\r\nfrom the dignity of his proper command, to direct our smallest\r\nmovements. His vigilance has in a great measure supplied the want of\r\nforce in preventing the enemy from crossing the river, which might\r\nhave been very fatal. He has been assiduously employed in preparing\r\nequipments for the militia, as they should assemble, in pointing them to\r\na proper object, and in other offices of a good commander. Should they\r\nloiter a little longer, and he be able to have a sufficient force, I\r\nstill flatter myself they will not escape with total impunity. To what\r\nplace they will point their next exertions, we cannot even conjecture.\r\nThe whole country on the tide waters and some distance from them, is\r\nequally open to similar insult.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with every sentiment of respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVII.--TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, Jan. 15, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nRichmond, January 15,1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAs the dangers which threaten our western frontiers, the ensuing spring,\r\nrender it necessary that we should send thither Colonel Crocket’s\r\nbattalion, at present on guard at Fredericktown, but raised for the\r\nwestern service, I thought it necessary to give your Excellency previous\r\ninformation thereof, that other forces may be provided in time to\r\nsucceed to their duties. Captain Read’s troop of horse, if necessary,\r\nmay be continued a while longer on guard.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVIII.--TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, Jan. 15, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nRichmond, January 15, 1781.\r\n\r\nI received some time ago from Major Forsyth, and afterwards from you,\r\na requisition to furnish one half the supplies of provision for the\r\nConvention troops, removed into Maryland. I should sooner have done\r\nmyself the honor of writing to you on this subject, but that I hoped to\r\nhave laid it before you more fully than could be done in writing, by a\r\ngentleman who was to pass on other public business to Philadelphia. The\r\nlate events in this State having retarded his setting out, I think it my\r\nduty no longer to postpone explanation on this head.\r\n\r\nYou cannot be unapprized of the powerful armies of our enemy, at this\r\ntime in this and the southern States, and that their future plan is\r\nto push their successes in the same quarter, by still larger\r\nreinforcements. The forces to be opposed to these must be proportionably\r\ngreat, and these forces must be fed. By whom are they to be fed?\r\nGeorgia and South Carolina are annihilated, at least, as to us. By the\r\nrequisition to us to send provisions into Maryland, it is to be supposed\r\nthat none are to come to the southern army, from any State north of\r\nthis; for it would seem inconsistent, that while we should be sending\r\nnorth, Maryland, and other states beyond that, should be sending their\r\nprovisions south. Upon North Carolina, then, already exhausted by the\r\nravages of two armies, and on this State, are to depend for subsistence\r\nthose bodies of men, who are to oppose the greater part of the enemy’s\r\nforce in the United States, the subsistence of the German, and of\r\nhalf the British Conventioners. To take a view of this matter on the\r\nContinental requisitions of November the 4th, 1780, for specific quotas\r\nof provisions, it is observable that North Carolina and Virginia are to\r\nfurnish 10,475,740 pounds of animal food, and 13,529 barrels of flour,\r\nwhile the States north of these will yield 25,293,810 pounds of animal\r\nfood, and 106,471 barrels of flour.\r\n\r\nIf the greater part of the British armies be employed in the South, it\r\nis to be supposed that the greater part of the American force will\r\nbe sent there to oppose them. But should this be the case, while the\r\ndistribution of the provisions is so very unequal, would it be proper to\r\nrender it still more so, by withdrawing a part of our contributions\r\nto the support of posts northward of us? It would certainly be a\r\ngreat convenience to us, to deliver a portion of our specifics at\r\nFredericktown, rather than in Carolina: but I leave it to you to judge,\r\nwhether this would be consistent with the general good or safety.\r\nInstead of sending aids of any kind to the northward, it seems but too\r\ncertain that unless very timely and substantial assistance be received\r\nfrom thence, our enemies are yet far short of the ultimate term of\r\ntheir successes. I beg leave, therefore, to refer to you, whether the\r\nspecifics of Maryland, as far as shall be necessary, had not better be\r\napplied to the support of the posts within it, for which its quota is\r\nmuch more than sufficient, or, were it otherwise, whether those of the\r\nStates north of Maryland had not better be called on, than to detract\r\nany thing from the resources of the southern opposition, already much\r\ntoo small for the encounter to which it is left. I am far from wishing\r\nto count or measure our contributions by the requisitions of Congress.\r\nWere they ever so much beyond these. I should readily strain them in aid\r\nof any one of our sister States. But while they are so short of those\r\ncalls to which they must be pointed in the first instance, it would\r\nbe great misapplication to divert them to any other purpose: and I am\r\npersuaded you will think me perfectly within the line of duty, when I\r\nask a revisal of this requisition.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIX.--TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, Jan. 17, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nRichmond, January 17, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI do myself the honor of transmitting to your Excellency a resolution of\r\nthe General Assembly of this Commonwealth, entered into in consequence\r\nof the resolution of Congress of September the 6th, 1780, on the subject\r\nof the Confederation. I shall be rendered very happy if the other States\r\nof the Union, equally impressed with the necessity of that important\r\nconvention, shall be willing to sacrifice equally to its completion.\r\nThis single event, could it take place shortly, would overweigh every\r\nsuccess which the enemy have hitherto obtained, and render desperate the\r\nhopes to which those successes have given birth.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most real esteem and respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XL.--TO THE VIRGINIA DELEGATES IN CONGRESS, Jan. 18, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE VIRGINIA DELEGATES IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nRichmond, January 18, 1781.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nI enclose you a Resolution of Assembly, directing your conduct as to the\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe loss of powder lately sustained by us (about five tons), together\r\nwith the quantities sent on to the southward, have reduced our stock\r\nvery low indeed. We lent to Congress, in the course of the last year\r\n(previous to our issues for the southern army), about ten tons of\r\npowder. I shall be obliged to you to procure an order from the board of\r\nwar, for any quantity from five to ten tons, to be sent us immediately\r\nfrom Philadelphia or Baltimore, and to inquire into and hasten, from\r\ntime to time, the execution of it. The stock of cartridge-paper is\r\nnearly exhausted. I do not know whether Captain Irish, or what other\r\nofficer, should apply for this. It is essential that a good stock should\r\nbe forwarded, and without a moment’s delay. If there be a rock on\r\nwhich we are to split, it is the want of muskets, bayonets, and\r\ncartouch-boxes.\r\n\r\nThe occurrences, since my last to the President, are not of any\r\nmagnitude. Three little rencounters have happened with the enemy. In the\r\nfirst, General Smallwood led on a party of two or three hundred militia,\r\nand obliged some armed vessels of the enemy to retire from a prize they\r\nhad taken at Broadway’s, and renewing his attack the next day with\r\na four-pounder or two (for on the first day he had only muskets), he\r\nobliged some of their vessels to fall down from City Point to their\r\nmain fleet at Westover. The enemy’s loss is not known; ours was four men\r\nwounded. One of the evenings, during their encampment at Westover and\r\nBerkeley, their light-horse surprised a party of about one hundred or\r\none hundred and fifty militia at Charles City Court House, killed and\r\nwounded four, and took, as has been generally said, about seven or\r\neight. On Baron Steuben’s approach towards Hood’s, they embarked at\r\nWestover; the wind, which, till then, had set directly up the river\r\nfrom the time of their leaving Jamestown, shifted in the moment to the\r\nopposite point. Baron Steuben had not reached Hood’s by eight or ten\r\nmiles, when they arrived there. They landed their whole army in the\r\nnight, Arnold attending in person. Colonel Clarke (of Kaskaskias) had\r\nbeen sent on with two hundred and forty men by Baron Steuben, and having\r\nproperly disposed of them in ambuscade, gave them a deliberate fire,\r\nwhich killed seventeen on the spot, and wounded thirteen. They returned\r\nit in confusion, by which we had three or four wounded, and our party\r\nbeing so small and without bayonets, were obliged to retire on the\r\nenemy’s charging with bayonets. They fell down to Cobham, whence they\r\ncarried all the tobacco there (about sixty hogsheads); and the\r\nlast intelligence was, that on the 16th they were standing for\r\nNew-ports-news. Baron Steuben is of opinion, they are proceeding to fix\r\na post in some of the lower counties. Later information has given\r\nno reason to believe their force more considerable than we at first\r\nsupposed. I think, since the arrival of the three transports which had\r\nbeen separated in a storm, they may be considered as about two thousand\r\nstrong. Their naval force, according to the best intelligence, is the\r\nCharon, of forty-four guns, Commodore Symmonds, the Amphitrite, Iris,\r\nThames, and Charlestown frigates, the Forvey, of twenty guns, two sloops\r\nof war, a privateer ship, and two brigs. We have about thirty-seven\r\nhundred militia embodied, but at present they are divided into three\r\ndistant encampments: one under General Weeden, at Fredericksburg, for\r\nthe protection of the important works there; another under General\r\nNelson, at and near Williamsburg; and a third under Baron Steuben, at\r\nCabin Point. As soon as the enemy fix themselves, these will be brought\r\nto a point.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very great respect, gentlemen,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLI.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, February 8, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, February 8, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have just received intelligence, which, though from a private hand,\r\nI believe is to be relied on, that a fleet of the enemy’s ships have\r\nentered Cape Fear river, that eight of them had got over the bar,\r\nand many others were lying off; and that it was supposed to be a\r\nreinforcement to Lord Cornwallis, under the command of General Prevost.\r\nThis account, which had come through another channel, is confirmed by a\r\nletter from General Parsons at Halifax, to the gentleman who forwards it\r\nto me. I thought it of sufficient importance to be communicated to your\r\nExcellency by the stationed expresses. The fatal want of arms puts it\r\nout of our power to bring a greater force into the field, than will\r\nbarely suffice to restrain the adventures of the pitiful body of men\r\nthey have at Portsmouth. Should any more be added to them, this country\r\nwill be perfectly open to them, by land as well as water.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with all possible respect,\r\n\r\nYour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, February 12, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, February 12, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe enclosed extract from a letter from Governor Nash, which I received\r\nthis day, being a confirmation of the intelligence I transmitted in a\r\nformer letter, I take the liberty of transmitting it to your Excellency.\r\nI am informed, through a private channel, on which I have considerable\r\nreliance, that the enemy had landed five hundred troops under the\r\ncommand of a Major Craig, who were joined by a number of disaffected;\r\nthat they had penetrated forty miles; that their aim appeared to be\r\nthe magazine at Kingston, from which place they were about twenty miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nBaron Steuben transmits to your Excellency a letter from General Greene,\r\nby which you will learn the events which have taken place in that\r\nquarter since the defeat of Colonel Tarleton, by General Morgan. These\r\nevents speak best for themselves, and no doubt will suggest what is\r\nnecessary to be done to prevent the successive losses of State after\r\nState, to which the want of arms, and of a regular soldiery, seem more\r\nespecially to expose those in the South.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with every sentiment of respect, your\r\nExcellency’s most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, February 17, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, February 17, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nBy a letter from General Greene, dated Guilford Court House, February\r\n10th, we are informed that Lord Cornwallis had burned his own wagons in\r\norder to enable himself to move with greater facility, and had pressed\r\nimmediately on. The prisoners taken at the Cow-pens, were happily saved\r\nby the accidental rise of a water-course, which gave so much time as to\r\nwithdraw them from the reach of the enemy. Lord Cornwallis had advanced\r\nto the vicinities of the Moravian towns, and was still moving on\r\nrapidly. His object was supposed to be to compel General Greene to an\r\naction, which, under the difference of force they had, would probably\r\nbe ruinous to the latter. General Greene meant to retire by the way of\r\nBoyd’s Ferry, on the Roanoke. As yet he had lost little or no stores or\r\nbaggage, but they were far from being safe. In the instant of receiving\r\nthis intelligence, we ordered a reinforcement of militia to him, from\r\nthe most convenient counties in which there was a hope of finding any\r\narms. Some great event must arise from the present situation of things,\r\nwhich, for a long time, will determine the condition of southern\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nArnold lies close in his quarters. Two days ago, I received information\r\nof the arrival of a sixty-four gun ship and two frigates in our bay,\r\nbeing part of the fleet of our good ally at Rhode Island. Could they\r\nget at the British fleet here, they are sufficient to destroy them; but\r\nthese being drawn up into Elizabeth river, into which the sixty-four\r\ncannot enter, I apprehend they could do nothing more than block up the\r\nriver. This, indeed, would reduce the enemy, as we could cut off their\r\nsupplies by land; but the operation being tedious, would probably be\r\ntoo dangerous for the auxiliary force. Not having yet had any particular\r\ninformation of the designs of the French Commander, I cannot pretend to\r\nsay what measures this aid will lead to.\r\n\r\nOur proposition to the Cherokee Chiefs, to visit Congress, for the\r\npurpose of preventing or delaying a rupture with that nation, was too\r\nlate. Their distresses had too much ripened their alienation from us,\r\nand the storm had gathered to a head, when Major Martin got back. It was\r\ndetermined to carry the war into their country, rather than await it\r\nin ours, and thus disagreeably circumstanced, the issue has been\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe militia’ of this State and North Corolina penetrated into their\r\ncountry, burned almost every town they had, amounting to about one\r\nthousand houses in the whole, destroyed fifty thousand bushels of grain,\r\nkilled twenty-nine, and took seventeen prisoners. The latter are mostly\r\nwomen and children.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, &c. your Excellency’s\r\n\r\nmost obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. Since writing the above, I have received information which, though\r\nnot authentic, deserves attention: that Lord Cornwallis had got to\r\nBoyd’s Ferry on the 14th. I am issuing orders, in consequence, to other\r\ncounties, to embody and march all the men they can arm. In this fatal\r\nsituation, without arms, there will be no safety for the Convention\r\ntroops but in their removal, which I shall accordingly order. The\r\nprisoners of the Cowpens were at New London (Bedford Court House) on the\r\n14th. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIV.--TO GENERAL GATES, February 17, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\nRichmond, February 17, 1781.\r\n\r\nDear General,\r\n\r\nThe situation of affairs here and in Carolina is such as must shortly\r\nturn up important events, one way orihe other. By letter from General\r\nGreene, dated Guilford Court House, February the 10th, I learn that\r\nLord Cornwallis, rendered furious by the affair of the Cowpens and the\r\nsurprise of Georgetown, had burned his own wagons, to enable himself\r\nto move with facility, had pressed on to the vicinity of the Moravian\r\ntowns, and was still advancing: The prisoners taken at the Cowpens\r\nwere saved by a hair’s-breadth accident, and Greene was retreating.\r\nHis force, two thousand regulars, and no militia; Cornwallis, three\r\nthousand. General Davidson was killed in a skirmish. Arnold lies still\r\nat Portsmouth with fifteen hundred men. A French sixty-four gun ship\r\nand two frigates, of thirty-six each, arrived in our bay three days ago.\r\nThey would suffice to destroy the British shipping here (a forty, four\r\nfrigates, and a twenty), could they get at them. But these are withdrawn\r\nup Elizabeth river, which the sixty-four cannot enter. We have ordered\r\nabout seven hundred riflemen from Washington, Montgomery, and Bedford,\r\nand five hundred common militia from Pittsylvania and Henry, to\r\nreinforce General Greene; and five hundred new levies will march from\r\nChesterfield Court House in a few days. I have no doubt, however, that\r\nthe southwestern counties will have turned out in greater numbers before\r\nour orders reach them.\r\n\r\nI have been knocking at the door of Congress for aids of all kinds,\r\nbut especially of arms, ever since the middle of summer. The speaker,\r\nHarrison, is gone to be heard on that subject. Justice, indeed, requires\r\nthat we should be aided powerfully. Yet if they would repay us the arms\r\nwe have lent them, we should give the enemy trouble, though abandoned to\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nAfter repeated applications, I have obtained a warrant for your advance\r\nmoney, £18,000, which I have put into the hands of Mr. McAlister, to\r\nreceive the money from the Treasurer, and carry it to you.\r\n\r\nI am, with very sincere esteem,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLV.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, February 26,1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, February 26,1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI gave you information in my last letter, that General Greene had\r\ncrossed the Dan, at Boyd’s Ferry, and that Lord Cornwallis had arrived\r\nat the opposite shore. Large reinforcements of militia having embodied\r\nboth in front and rear of the enemy, he is retreating with as much\r\nrapidity as he advanced; his route is towards Hillsborough. General\r\nGreene re-crossed the Dan on the 21st, in pursuit of him. I have the\r\npleasure to inform you, that the spirit of opposition was as universal,\r\nas could have been wished for. There was no restraint on the numbers\r\nthat embodied, but the want of arms.\r\n\r\nThe British at Portsmouth lie close in their lines. The French squadron\r\nkeep them in by water, and since their arrival, as they put it out of\r\nthe power of the enemy to cut off our retreat by sending up Nansemond\r\nriver, our force has been moved down close to their lines.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVI.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, March 8, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, March 8, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of receiving a letter from General Greene, dated\r\nHigh-rock Ford, February 29th (probably March the 1st), who informs me,\r\nthat, on the night of the 24th, Colonel M’Call surprised a subaltern’s\r\nguard at Hart’s Mill, killed eight, and wounded and took nine prisoners,\r\nand that on the 25th, General Pickens and Lieutenant Colonel Lee routed\r\na body of near three hundred tories, on the Haw river, who were in arms\r\nto join the British army, killed upwards of one hundred, and wounded\r\nmost of the rest; which had a very happy effect on the disaffected in\r\nthat country.\r\n\r\nBy a letter from Major Magill, an officer of this State, whom I had sent\r\nto General Greene’s head-quarters, for the purpose of giving us regular\r\nintelligence, dated Guilford County, March 2nd, I am informed that\r\nLord Cornwallis, on his retreat, erected the British standard at\r\nHillsborough; that numbers of disaffected, under the command of Colonel\r\nPiles, were resorting to it, when they were intercepted by General\r\nPickens and Lieutenant Colonel Lee, as mentioned by General Greene; and\r\nthat their commanding officer was among the slain: that Lord Cornwallis,\r\nafter destroying every thing he could, moved down the Haw river from\r\nHillsborough: that General Greene was within six miles of him: that our\r\nsuperiority in the goodness, though not in the number of our cavalry,\r\nprevented the enemy from moving with rapidity, or foraging. Having been\r\nparticular in desiring Major Magill to inform me what corps of militia,\r\nfrom this State, joined General Greene, he accordingly mentioned, that\r\nseven hundred under General Stevens, and four hundred from Botetourt,\r\nhad actually joined him; that Colonel Campbell was to join, him that\r\nday with six hundred, and that Colonel Lynch, with three hundred from\r\nBedford, was shortly expected: the last three numbers being riflemen.\r\nBesides these mentioned by Major Magill, General Lawson must, before\r\nthis, have crossed Roanoke with a body of militia, the number of which\r\nhas not been stated to me. Report makes them a thousand, but I suppose\r\nthe number to be exaggerated. Four hundred of our new levies left\r\nChesterfield Court House on the 25th of February, and probably would\r\ncross the Roanoke about the 1st or 2nd of March.\r\n\r\nI was honored with your Excellency’s letter of February the 21st, within\r\nseven days after its date. We have, accordingly, been making every\r\npreparation on our part, which we are able to make. The militia proposed\r\nto co-operate, will be upwards of four thousand from this State, and\r\none thousand or twelve hundred from Carolina, said to be under General\r\nGregory. The enemy are, at this time, in a great measure blockaded by\r\nland, there being a force on the east side of Elizabeth river. They\r\nsuffer for provisions, as they are afraid to venture far, lest the\r\nFrench squadron should be in the neighborhood, and come upon them. Were\r\nit possible to block up the river, a little time would suffice to reduce\r\nthem by want and desertions, and would be more sure in its event than an\r\nattempt by storm. I shall be very happy to have it in my power to hand\r\nyou a favorable account of these two armies in the South.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem and respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVII.--TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, March 19,1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nRichmond, March 19,1781;\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have the honor of enclosing to your Excellency a copy of a letter from\r\nGeneral Greene, with some other intelligence received, not doubting your\r\nanxiety to know the movements in the South.\r\n\r\nI find we have deceived ourselves not a little, by counting on the whole\r\nnumbers of the militia which have been in motion, as if they had all\r\nremained with General Greene, when, in fact, they seem only to have\r\nvisited and quitted him.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis Fayette arrived at New York on the 15th. His troops still\r\nremained at the head of the bay, till the appearance of some force which\r\nshould render their passage down safe.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and\r\nrespect, your Excellency’s\r\n\r\nmost obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVIII.--TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, March 21, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nRichmond, March 21, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe enclosed letter will inform you of the arrival of a British fleet in\r\nChesapeake bay.\r\n\r\nThe extreme negligence of our stationed expresses is no doubt the cause\r\nwhy, as yet, no authentic account has reached us of a general action,\r\nwhich happened on the 15th instant, about a mile and a half from\r\nGuilford Court House, between General Greene and Lord Cornwallis.\r\nCaptain Singleton, an intelligent officer of Harrison’s artillery, who\r\nwas in the action, has this moment arrived here, and gives the general\r\ninformation that both parties were prepared and desirous for action;\r\nthe enemy were supposed about twenty-five hundred strong, our army about\r\nfour thousand. That after a very warm and general engagement, of about\r\nan hour and a half, we retreated about a mile and a half from the field,\r\nin good order, having, as he supposed, between two and three hundred\r\nkilled and wounded, the enemy between five and seven hundred killed and\r\nwounded: that we lost four pieces of artillery: that the militia, as\r\nwell as regulars, behaved exceedingly well: that General Greene, he\r\nbelieves, would have renewed the action the next day, had it not proved\r\nrainy, and would renew it as soon as possible, as he supposes: that the\r\nwhole of his troops, both regulars and militia, were in high spirits and\r\nwishing a second engagement: that the loss has fallen pretty equally on\r\nthe militia and regulars: that General Stevens received a ball through\r\nthe thigh.\r\n\r\nMajor Anderson, of Maryland, was killed, and Captain Barrett, of\r\nWashington’s cavalry; Captain Fauntleroy, of the same cavalry, was shot\r\nthrough the thigh, and left in the field.\r\n\r\nCaptain Singleton, having left the camp the day after the battle, does,\r\nnot speak from particular returns, none such having been then made. I\r\nmust inform your Excellency from him, till more regular applications can\r\nreach you, that they are in extreme want of lead, cartridge-paper, and\r\nthread. I think it improper, however it might urge an instantaneous\r\nsupply, to repeat to you his statement of the extent of their stock of\r\nthese articles. In a former letter, I mentioned to you the failure of\r\nthe vein of our lead mines, which has left the army here in a state of\r\nequal distress and danger.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very high respect and esteem,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. Look-out boats have been ordered from the sea-board of the eastern\r\nshore, to apprise the Commander of the French fleet, on its approach, of\r\nthe British being in the Chesapeake. T. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIX.--TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, March 26,1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nIn Council, Richmond, March 26,1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe appointment of commissioner to the war-office of this State having\r\nlately become vacant, the Executive are desirous to place Colonel\r\nWilliam Davies, of the Virginia Continentals, in that office. This\r\ngentleman, however, declines undertaking it, unless his rank in the\r\narmy, half pay for life and allowance for depreciation of pay, can be\r\nreserved to him; observing with justice, that these emoluments, distant\r\nas they are, are important to a person who has spent the most valuable\r\npart of his youth in the service of his country. As this indulgence\r\nrests in the power of Congress alone, I am induced to request it of them\r\non behalf of the State, to whom it is very interesting that the office\r\nbe properly filled, and I may say, on behalf of the Continent also, to\r\nwhom the same circumstance is interesting, in proportion to its reliance\r\nupon this State for supplies to the southern war. We should not have\r\ngiven Congress the trouble of this application, had we found it easy to\r\ncall any other to the office, who was likely to answer our wishes in the\r\nexercise of it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER L.--TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, March 28, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nRichmond, March 28, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI forward to your Excellency, under cover with this, copies of letters\r\nreceived from Major General Greene and Baron Steuben, which will give\r\nyou the latest account of the situation of things with us and in North\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nI observe a late resolve of Congress, for furnishing a number of arms to\r\nthe southern states; and I lately wrote you on the subject of ammunition\r\nand cartridge-paper. How much of this State, the enemy thus reinforced,\r\nmay think proper to possess themselves of, must depend on their own\r\nmoderation and caution, till these supplies arrive. We had hoped to\r\nreceive, by the French squadron under Monsieur Destouches, eleven\r\nhundred stand of arms, which we had at Rhode Island, but were\r\ndisappointed. The necessity of hurrying forward the troops intended for\r\nthe southern operations will be doubtless apparent from this letter.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LI.--TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, March 31, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nRichmond, March 31, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe letters and papers accompanying this, will inform your Excellency of\r\nthe arrival of a British flag vessel with clothing, refreshments, money,\r\n&c. for their prisoners under the Convention of Saratoga. The gentlemen\r\nconducting them have, on supposition that the prisoners, or a part of\r\nthem, still remained in this State, applied to me by letters, copies\r\nof which I transmit your Excellency, for leave to allow water\r\ntransportation as far as possible, and then, for themselves to attend\r\nthem to the post where they are to be issued. These indulgencies were\r\nusually granted them here, but the prisoners being removed, it becomes\r\nnecessary to transmit the application to Congress for their direction.\r\nIn the mean time the flag will wait in James river.\r\n\r\nOur intelligence from General Greene’s camp as late as the 24th, is,\r\nthat Lord Cornwallis’s march of the day before had decided his route to\r\nCross creek.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the reinforcements to the enemy, arrived at Portsmouth,\r\nis not yet known with certainty. Accounts differ from fifteen hundred to\r\nmuch larger numbers. We are informed they have a considerable number of\r\nhorse. The affliction of the people for want of arms is great; that of\r\nammunition is not yet known to them. An apprehension is added, that, the\r\nenterprise on Portsmouth being laid aside, the troops under the Marquis\r\nFayette will not come on. An enemy three thousand strong, not a regular\r\nin the State, nor arms to put in the hands of the militia, are, indeed,\r\ndiscouraging circumstances.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LII.--TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, April 7, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nRichmond, April 7, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nHearing that our arms from Rhode Island have arrived at Philadelphia,\r\nI have begged the favor of our Delegates to send them on in wagons\r\nimmediately, and, for the conveyance of my letter, have taken the\r\nliberty of setting the Continental line of expresses in motion, which I\r\nhope our distress for arms will justify, though the errand be not purely\r\nContinental.\r\n\r\nI have nothing from General Greene later than the 27th of March; our\r\naccounts from Portsmouth vary the reinforcements which came under\r\nGeneral Phillips, from twenty-five hundred to three thousand. Arnold’s\r\nstrength before, was, I think, reduced to eleven hundred. They have made\r\nno movement yet. Their preparation of boats is considerable; whether\r\nthey mean to go southwardly or up the river, no leading circumstance has\r\nyet decided.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIII.--TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, April 18, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nIn Council, April 18, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI was honored, yesterday, with your Excellency’s favor enclosing the\r\nresolutions of Congress of the 8th instant, for removing stores and\r\nprovisions from the counties of Accomack and Northampton. We have there\r\nno military stores, except a few muskets in the hands of the militia.\r\nThere are some collections of forage and provisions belonging to the\r\nContinent, and some to the State, and the country there, generally,\r\nfurnishes an abundance of forage. But such is the present condition of\r\nChesapeake bay, that we cannot even get an advice-boat across it, with\r\nany certainty, much less adventure on transportation. Should, however,\r\nany interval happen, in which these articles may be withdrawn, we shall\r\ncertainly avail ourselves of it, and bring thence whatever we can.\r\n\r\nIf I have been rightly informed, the horses there are by no means such,\r\nas that the enemy could apply them to the purposes of cavalry. Some,\r\nlarge enough for the draught, may, perhaps, be found, but of these not\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIV.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, April 23,1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nRichmond, April 23,1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nOn the 18th instant, the enemy came from Portsmouth up James river, in\r\nconsiderable force, though their numbers are not yet precisely known to\r\nus. They landed at Burwell’s Ferry, below Williamsburg, and also a\r\nshort distance above the mouth of Chickahominy. This latter circumstance\r\nobliged Colonel Innis, who commanded a body of militia, stationed on\r\nthat side the river to cover the country from depredation, to retire\r\nupwards, lest he should be placed between their two bodies. One of these\r\nentered Williamsburg on the 20th, and the other proceeded to a ship-yard\r\nwe had on Chickahominy. What injury they did there, I am not yet\r\ninformed. I take for granted, they have burned an unfinished twenty-gun\r\nship we had there. Such of the stores belonging to the yard as were\r\nmoveable, had been carried some miles higher up the river. Two small\r\ngalleys also retired up the river. Whether by this, either the stores\r\nor galleys were saved, is yet unknown. I am just informed from a private\r\nhand, that they left Williamsburg early yesterday morning. If this\r\nsudden departure was not in consequence of some circumstance of alarm\r\nunknown to us, their expedition to Williamsburg has been unaccountable.\r\nThere were no public stores at that place, but those which were\r\nnecessary for the daily subsistence of the men there. Where they mean\r\nto descend next, the event alone can determine. Besides harassing our\r\nmilitia with this kind of war, the taking them from their farms at the\r\ninteresting season of planting their corn, will have an unfortunate\r\neffect on the crop of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nI have heard nothing certain of General Greene since the 6th instant,\r\nexcept that his head-quarters were on Little river on the 11th.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect and esteem,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LV.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, May 9, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nRichmond, May 9, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nSince the last letter which I had the honor of addressing to your\r\nExcellency, the military movements in this State, except a very late\r\none, have scarcely merited communication.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, after leaving Williamsburg, came directly up James river and\r\nlanded at City Point, being the point of land on the southern side\r\nof the confluence of Appomatox and James rivers. They marched up to\r\nPetersburg, where they were received by Baron Steuben with a body of\r\nmilitia somewhat under one thousand, who, though the enemy were two\r\nthousand and three hundred strong, disputed the ground very handsomely,\r\ntwo hours, during which time the enemy gained only one mile, and that by\r\ninches. Our troops were then ordered to retire over a bridge, which they\r\ndid in perfectly good order. Our loss was between sixty and seventy,\r\nkilled, wounded, and taken. The enemy’s is unknown, but it must be equal\r\nto ours; for their own honor they must confess this, as they broke twice\r\nand run like sheep, till supported by fresh troops. An inferiority in\r\nnumber obliged our force to withdraw about twelve miles upwards, till\r\nmore militia should be assembled. The enemy burned all the tobacco in\r\nthe warehouses at Petersburg, and its, neighborhood. They afterwards\r\nproceeded to Osborne’s, where they did the same, and also destroyed the\r\nresidue of the public armed vessels, and several of private property,\r\nand then came to Manchester, which is on the hill opposite this place.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Major General Marquis Fayette, having been advised of\r\nour danger, had, by forced marches, got here with his detachment of\r\nContinental troops; and reinforcements of militia having also come in,\r\nthe enemy finding we were able to meet them on equal footing, thought\r\nproper to burn the warehouses and tobacco at Manchester, and retire to\r\nWarwick, where they did the same. Ill armed and untried militia, who\r\nnever before saw the face of an enemy, have, at times, during the course\r\nof this war, given occasions of exultation to our enemies; but they\r\nafforded us, while at Warwick, a little satisfaction in the same way.\r\nSix or eight hundred of their picked men of light-infantry, with General\r\nArnold at their head, having crossed the river from Warwick, fled from\r\na patrole of sixteen horse, every man into his boat as he could, some\r\npushing north, some south, as their fears drove them. Their whole\r\nforce then proceeded to the Hundred, being the point of land within the\r\nconfluence of the two rivers, embarked, and fell down the river. Their\r\nforemost vessels had got below Burwell’s Ferry on the 6th instant, when\r\non the arrival of a boat from Portsmouth, and a signal given, the whole\r\ncrowded sail up the river again with a fair wind and tide, and came to\r\nanchor at Brandon; there six days’ provision was dealt out to every\r\nman; they landed, and had orders to march an hour before day the next\r\nmorning. We have not yet heard which way they went, or whether they have\r\ngone; but having, about the same time, received authentic information\r\nthat Lord Cornwallis had, on the 1st instant, advanced from Wilmington\r\nhalf way to Halifax, we have no doubt, putting all circumstances\r\ntogether, that these two armies are forming a junction.\r\n\r\nWe are strengthening our hands with militia, as far as arms, either\r\npublic or private, can be collected, but cannot arm a force which may\r\nface the combined armies of the enemy. It will, therefore, be of very\r\ngreat importance that General Wayne’s forces be pressed on with\r\nthe utmost despatch. Arms and a naval force, however, are what must\r\nultimately save us. This movement of our enemies we consider as most\r\nperilous in its consequences.\r\n\r\nOur latest advices from General Greene were of the 26th ult., when\r\nhe was lying before Camden, the works and garrison of which were much\r\nstronger than he had expected to find them.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVI.--TO THE VIRGINIA DELEGATES IN CONGRESS, May 10, 1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE VIRGINIA DELEGATES IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nIn Council, May 10, 1781.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nA small affair has taken place between the British commanding officer\r\nin this state, General Phillips, and the Executive, of which, as he may\r\nendeavor to get rid of it through the medium of Congress, I think it\r\nnecessary previously to apprise you.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott obtained permission from the Commandant at Charleston, for\r\nvessels with necessary supplies to go from hence to them, but instead\r\nof sending the original, sent only a copy of the permission taken by his\r\nbrigade-major. I applied to General Phillips to supply this omission\r\nby furnishing a passport for the vessel. Having just before taken great\r\noffence at a threat of retaliation in the treatment of prisoners,\r\nhe enclosed his answer to my letter under this address, ‘To Thomas\r\nJefferson Esq., American Governor of Virginia.’ I paused on receiving\r\nthe letter, and for some time would not open it; however, when the\r\nmiserable condition of our brethren in Charleston occurred to me, I\r\ncould not determine that they should be left without the necessaries of\r\nlife, while a punctilio should be discussing between the British General\r\nand myself; and knowing that I had an opportunity of returning the\r\ncompliment to Mr. Phillips in a case perfectly corresponding, I opened\r\nthe letter.\r\n\r\nVery shortly after, I received, as I expected, the permission of the\r\nboard of war, for the British flag-vessel, then in Hampton Roads with\r\nclothing and refreshments, to proceed to Alexandria. I enclosed and\r\naddressed it, ‘To William Phillips Esq., commanding the British forces\r\nin the Commonwealth of Virginia.’ Personally knowing Phillips to be the\r\nproudest man of the proudest nation on earth, I well know he will not\r\nopen this letter; but having occasion at the same time to write to\r\nCaptain Gerlach, the flag-master, I informed him that the Convention\r\ntroops in this state should perish-for want of necessaries, before any\r\nshould be carried to them through this state, till General Phillips\r\neither swallowed this pill of retaliation, or made an apology for his\r\nrudeness. And in this, should the matter come ultimately to Congress, we\r\nhope for their support.\r\n\r\nHe has the less right to insist on the expedition of his flag, because\r\nhis letter, instead of enclosing a passport to expedite ours, contained\r\nonly an evasion of the application, by saying he had referred it to Sir\r\nHenry Clinton, and in the mean time, he has come up the river, and taken\r\nthe vessel with her loading, which we had chartered and prepared to send\r\nto Charleston, and which wanted nothing but the passport to enable her\r\nto depart.\r\n\r\nI would further observe to you, that this gentleman’s letters to the\r\nBaron Steuben first, and afterwards to the Marquis Fayette, have been in\r\na style so intolerably insolent and haughty, that both these gentlemen\r\nhave, been obliged to inform him, that if he thinks proper to address\r\nthem again in the same spirit, all intercourse shall be discontinued.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect and esteem,\r\n\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, May 28,1781\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nCharlottesville, May 28,1781.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI make no doubt you will have heard, before this shall have the honor of\r\nbeing presented to your Excellency, of the junction of Lord Cornwallis\r\nwith the force at Petersburg under Arnold, who had succeeded to the\r\ncommand on the death of Major General Phillips. I am now advised that\r\nthey have evacuated Petersburg, joined at Westover a reinforcement of\r\ntwo thousand men just arrived from New York, crossed James river, and\r\non the 26th instant were three miles advanced on their way towards\r\nRichmond; at which place Major General the Marquis Fayette lay with\r\nthree thousand men, regulars and militia: these being the whole number\r\nwe could arm, until the arrival of the eleven hundred arms from Rhode\r\nIsland, which are, about this time, at the place where our public stores\r\nare deposited, The whole force of the enemy within this State, from\r\nthe best intelligence I have been able to get, is, I think, about seven\r\nthousand men, infantry and cavalry, including also the small garrison\r\nleft at Portsmouth. A number of privateers, which are constantly\r\nravaging the shores of our rivers, prevent us from receiving any aid\r\nfrom the counties lying on navigable waters: and powerful operations\r\nmeditated against our western frontier, by a joint force of British\r\nand Indian savages, have, as your Excellency before knew, obliged us\r\nto embody between two and three thousand men in that quarter. Your\r\nExcellency will judge from this state of things, and from what you know\r\nof our country, what it may probably suffer during the present campaign.\r\nShould the enemy be able to produce no opportunity of annihilating the\r\nMarquis’s army, a small proportion of their force may yet restrain\r\nhis movements effectually, while the greater part are employed, in\r\ndetachment, to waste an unarmed country, and lead the minds of the\r\npeople to acquiescence under those events, which they see no human power\r\nprepared to ward off. We are too far removed from the other scenes of\r\nwar to say, whether the main force of the enemy be within this state.\r\nBut I suppose they cannot any where spare so great an army for the\r\noperations of the field. Were it possible for this circumstance to\r\njustify in your Excellency a determination to lend us your personal\r\naid, it is evident from the universal voice, that the presence of\r\ntheir beloved countryman, whose talents have so long been successfully\r\nemployed in establishing the freedom of kindred States, to whose person\r\nthey have still flattered themselves they retained some right, and have\r\never looked up, as their dernier resort in distress, would restore full\r\nconfidence of salvation to our citizens, and would render them equal to\r\nwhatever is not impossible. I cannot undertake to foresee and obviate\r\nthe difficulties which lie in the way of such a resolution. The whole\r\nsubject is before you, of which I see only detached parts: and your\r\njudgment will be formed on a view of the whole. Should the danger of\r\nthis State, and its consequence to the Union, be such, as to render\r\nit best for the whole that you should repair to its assistance, the\r\ndifficulty would then be, how to keep men out of the field. I have\r\nundertaken to hint this matter to your Excellency, not only on my own\r\nsense of its importance to us, but at the solicitations of many members\r\nof weight in our legislature, which has not yet assembled to speak their\r\nown desires.\r\n\r\nA few days will bring to me that relief which the constitution has\r\nprepared for those oppressed with the labors of my office, and a long\r\ndeclared resolution of relinquishing it to abler hands, has prepared\r\nmy way for retirement to a private station: still, as an individual, I\r\nshould feel the comfortable effects of your presence, and have (what I\r\nthought could not have been) an additional motive for that gratitude,\r\nesteem, and respect, with which\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [An interval of near three years here occurs in the\r\n     Author’s correspondence, during which he preserved only\r\n     memoranda of the contents of the letters written by him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER, LVIII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, April 16, 1784\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nAnnapolis, April 16, 1784.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received your favor of April the 8th, by Colonel Harrison, The subject\r\nof it is interesting, and, so far as you have stood connected with it,\r\nhas been matter of anxiety to me; because, whatever may be the ultimate\r\nfate of the institution of the Cincinnati, as, in its course, it draws\r\nto it some degree of disapprobation, I have wished to see you standing\r\non ground separated from it, and that the character which will be handed\r\nto future ages at the head of our Revolution, may, in no instance, be\r\ncompromitted in subordinate altercations. The subject has been at the\r\npoint of my pen in every letter I have written to you, but has been\r\nstill restrained by the reflection that you had among your friends more\r\nable counsellors, and, in yourself, one abler than them all. Your letter\r\nhas now rendered a duty what was before a desire, and I cannot better\r\nmerit your confidence than by a full and free communication of facts\r\nand sentiments, as far as they have come within my observation. When the\r\narmy was about to be disbanded, and the officers to take final leave,\r\nperhaps never again to meet, it was natural for men who had accompanied\r\neach other through so many scenes of hardship, of difficulty and danger,\r\nwho, in a variety of instances, must have been rendered mutually dear\r\nby those aids and good offices, to which their situations had given\r\noccasion, it was natural, I say, for these to seize with fondness any\r\nproposition which promised to bring them together again, at certain and\r\nregular periods. And this, I take for granted, was the origin and object\r\nof this institution: and I have no suspicion that they foresaw, much\r\nless intended, those mischiefs which exist perhaps in the forebodings of\r\npoliticians only. I doubt, however, whether in its execution, it would\r\nbe found to answer the wishes of those who framed it, and to foster\r\nthose friendships it was intended to preserve. The members would be\r\nbrought together at their annual assemblies no longer to encounter a\r\ncommon enemy, but to encounter one another in debate and sentiment.\r\nFor something, I suppose, is to be done at these meetings, and,\r\nhowever unimportant, it will suffice to produce difference of opinion,\r\ncontradiction, and irritation. The way to make friends quarrel is to put\r\nthem in disputation under the public eye. An experience of near twenty\r\nyears has taught me, that few friendships stand this test, and that\r\npublic assemblies where every one is free to act and speak, are the\r\nmost powerful looseners of the bands of private friendship. I think,\r\ntherefore, that this institution would fail in its principal object, the\r\nperpetuation of the personal friendships contracted through the war.\r\n\r\nThe objections of those who are opposed to the institution shall be\r\nbriefly sketched. You will readily fill them up. They urge that it\r\nis against the Confederation--against the letter of some of our\r\nconstitutions--against the spirit of all of them;--that the foundation\r\non which all these are built, is the natural equality of man, the\r\ndenial of every pre-eminence but that annexed to legal office, and,\r\nparticularly, the denial of a pre-eminence by birth; that however, in\r\ntheir present dispositions, citizens might decline accepting honorary\r\ninstalments[sp.]into the order; but a time, may come, when a change\r\nof dispositions would render these flattering, when a well directed\r\ndistribution of them might draw into the order all the men of talents,\r\nof office, and wealth, and in this case, would probably procure an\r\ningraftment into the government; that in this, they will be supported by\r\ntheir foreign members, and the wishes and influence of foreign courts;\r\nthat experience has shown that the hereditary branches of modern\r\ngovernments are the patrons of privilege and prerogative, and not of the\r\nnatural rights of the people, whose oppressors they generally are:\r\nthat besides these evils, which are remote, others may take place\r\nmore immediately; that a distinction is kept up between the civil and\r\nmilitary, which it is for the happiness of both to obliterate; that when\r\nthe members assemble the, will be proposing to do something, and what\r\nthat something may be, will depend on actual circumstances; that being\r\nan organized body, under habits of subordination, the first obstruction\r\nto enterprise will be already surmounted; that the moderation and virtue\r\nof a single character have probably prevented this Revolution from being\r\nclosed as most others have been, by a subversion of that liberty it was\r\nintended to establish; that he is not immortal, and his successor, or\r\nsome of his successors, may be led by false calculation into a less\r\ncertain road to glory.\r\n\r\nWhat are the sentiments of Congress on this subject, and what line they\r\nwill pursue, can only be stated, conjecturally. Congress as a body, if\r\nleft to themselves, will in my opinion say nothing on the subject. They\r\nmay, however, be forced into a declaration by instructions from some\r\nof the States, or by other incidents. Their sentiments, if forced from\r\nthem, will be unfriendly to the institution. If permitted to pursue\r\ntheir own path, they will check it by side-blows whenever it comes in\r\ntheir way, and in competitions for office, on equal or nearly equal\r\nground, will give silent preferences to those who are not of the\r\nfraternity. My reasons for thinking this are, 1. The grounds on which\r\nthey lately declined the foreign order proposed to be conferred on\r\nsome of our citizens. 2. The fourth of the fundamental articles of\r\nconstitution for the new States. I enclose you the report; it has\r\nbeen considered by Congress, recommitted and reformed by a committee,\r\naccording to sentiments expressed on other parts of it, but the\r\nprinciple referred to, having not been controverted at all, stands in\r\nthis as in the original report; it is not yet confirmed by Congress.\r\n3. Private conversations on this subject with the members. Since the\r\nreceipt of your letter I have taken occasion to extend these; not,\r\nindeed, to the military members, because, being of the order, delicacy\r\nforbade it, but to the others pretty generally; and, among these, I have\r\nas yet found but one who is not opposed to the institution, and that\r\nwith an anguish of mind, though covered under a guarded silence which\r\nI have not seen produced by any circumstance before. I arrived at\r\nPhiladelphia before the separation of the last Congress, and saw there\r\nand at Princeton some of its members not now in delegation. Burke’s\r\npiece happened to come out at that time, which occasioned this\r\ninstitution to be the subject of conversation. I found the same\r\nimpressions made on them which their successors have received. I hear\r\nfrom other quarters that it is disagreeable, generally, to such citizens\r\nas have attended to it, and, therefore, will probably be so to all, when\r\nany circumstance shall present it to the notice of all.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is as faithful an account of sentiments and facts as I am\r\nable to give you. You know the extent of the circle within which my\r\nobservations are at present circumscribed, and can estimate how far, as\r\nforming a part of the general opinion, it may merit notice, or ought to\r\ninfluence your particular conduct.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to pay obedience to that part of your letter, which\r\nrequests sentiments on the most eligible measures to be pursued by the\r\nsociety, at their next meeting. I must be far from pretending to be a\r\njudge of what would, in fact, be the most, eligible measures for the\r\nsociety. I can only give you the opinions of those with whom I have\r\nconversed, and who, as I have before observed, are unfriendly to it.\r\nThey lead to these conclusions. 1. If the society proceed according to\r\nits institution, it will be better to make no applications to Congress\r\non that subject, or any other, in their associated character. 2. If they\r\nshould propose to modify it, so as to render it unobjectionable, I think\r\nit would not be effected without such a modification as would\r\namount almost to annihilation: for such would it be to part with its\r\ninheritability, its organization, and its assemblies. 3. If they shall\r\nbe disposed to discontinue the whole, it would remain with them to\r\ndetermine whether they would choose it to be done by their own act only,\r\nor by a reference of the matter to Congress, which would infallibly\r\nproduce a recommendation of total discontinuance.\r\n\r\nYou will be sensible, Sir, that these communications are without\r\nreserve. I supposed such to be your wish, and mean them but as\r\nmaterials, with such others as you may collect, for your better judgment\r\nto work on. I consider the whole matter as between ourselves alone,\r\nhaving determined to take no active part in this or any thing else,\r\nwhich may lead to altercation, or disturb that quiet and tranquillity of\r\nmind, to which I consign the remaining portion of my life. I have been\r\nthrown back by events, on a stage where I had never more thought to\r\nappear. It is but for a time, however, and as a day-laborer, free to\r\nwithdraw, or be withdrawn at will. While I remain, I shall pursue in\r\nsilence the path of right, but in every situation, public or private,\r\nI shall be gratified by all occasions of rendering you service, and of\r\nconvincing you there is no one, to whom your reputation and happiness\r\nare dearer than to, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIX.--TO COLONEL URIAH FORREST, October 20, 1784\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL URIAH FORREST.\r\n\r\nParis, Cul-de-Sac Tetebout,\r\n\r\nOctober 20, 1784.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI received yesterday your favor of the 8th instant, and this morning\r\nwent to Auteuil and Passy, to consult with Mr. Adams and Dr. Franklin\r\non the subject of it. We conferred together, and think it is a case in\r\nwhich we could not interpose (were there as yet cause for interposition)\r\nwithout express instructions from Congress. It is, however, our private\r\nopinion, which we give as individuals, only, that Mr. McLanahan, while\r\nin England, is subject to the laws of England; that, therefore, he must\r\nemploy counsel, and be guided in his defence by their advice. The law\r\nof nations and the treaty of peace, as making a part of the law of the\r\nland, will undoubtedly be under the consideration of the judges who\r\npronounce on Mr. McLanahan’s case; and we are willing to hope that, in\r\ntheir knowledge and integrity, he will find certain resources against\r\ninjustice, and a reparation of all injury to which he may have been\r\ngroundlessly exposed. A final and palpable failure on their part, which\r\nwe have no reason to apprehend, might make the case proper for the\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of great respect and esteem, for\r\nMr. McLanahan, as well as yourself.\r\n\r\nSir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LX.--TO JOHN JAY, May 11, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, May 11, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI was honored on the 2nd instant with the receipt of your favor of March\r\nthe 15th, enclosing the resolution of Congress of the 10th of the same\r\nmonth, appointing me their Minister Plenipotentiary at this court, and\r\nalso of your second letter of March 22nd, covering the commission and\r\nletter of credence for that appointment. I beg permission through you,\r\nSir, to testify to Congress my gratitude for this new mark of their\r\nfavor, and my assurances of endeavoring to merit it by a faithful\r\nattention to the discharge of the duties annexed to it. Fervent zeal is\r\nall which I can be sure of carrying into their service; and where I fail\r\nthrough a want of those powers which nature and circumstances deny me, I\r\nshall rely on their indulgence, and much also on that candor with which\r\nyour Goodness will present my proceedings to their eye. The kind terms\r\nin which you are pleased to notify this honor to me, require mv sincere\r\nthanks. I beg you to accept them, and to be assured of the perfect\r\nesteem, with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXI.--TO GENERAL CHASTELLUX, June 7,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL CHASTELLUX.\r\n\r\nParis, June 7,1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have been honored with the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant,\r\nand am to thank you, as I do sincerely, for the partiality with which\r\nyou receive the copy of the Notes on my country. As I can answer for the\r\nfacts therein reported on my own observation, and have admitted none on\r\nthe report of others, which were not supported by evidence sufficient to\r\ncommand my own assent, I am not afraid that you should make any extracts\r\nyou please for the Journal de Physique, which come within their plan\r\nof publication. The strictures on slavery and on the constitution of\r\nVirginia, are not of that kind, and they are the parts which I do\r\nnot wish to have made public, at least, till I know whether their\r\npublication would do most harm or good. It is possible, that in my\r\nown country, these strictures might produce an irritation, which would\r\nindispose the people towards the two great objects I have in view,\r\nthat is, the emancipation of their slaves, and the settlement of their\r\nconstitution on a firmer and more permanent basis. If I learn from\r\nthence, that they will not produce that effect, I have printed and\r\nreserved just copies enough to be able to give one to every young man at\r\nthe College. It is to them I look, to the rising generation, and not\r\nto the one now in power, for these great reformations. The other copy,\r\ndelivered at your hotel, was for Monsieur de Buffon. I meant to ask the\r\nfavor of you to have it sent to him, as I was ignorant how to do it. I\r\nhave one also for Monsieur Daubenton, but being utterly unknown to him,\r\nI cannot take the liberty of presenting it, till I can do it through\r\nsome common acquaintance.\r\n\r\nI will beg leave to say here a few words on the general question of the\r\ndegeneracy of animals in America. 1. As to the degeneracy of the man of\r\nEurope transplanted to America, it is no part of Monsieur de Buffon’s\r\nsystem. He goes, indeed, within one step of it, but he stops there. The\r\nAbbe Raynal alone has taken that step. Your knowledge of America enables\r\nyou to judge this question; to say, whether the lower class of people\r\nin America, are less informed, and less susceptible of information,\r\nthan the lower class in Europe: and whether those in America who have\r\nreceived such an education as that country can give, are less improved\r\nby it than Europeans of the same degree of education. 2. As to the\r\naboriginal man of America, I know of no respectable evidence on which\r\nthe opinion of his inferiority of genius has been founded, but that of\r\nDon Ulloa. As to Robertson, he never was in America; he relates nothing\r\non his own knowledge; he is a compiler only of the relations of others,\r\nand a mere translator of the opinions of Monsieur de Buffon. I should\r\nas soon, therefore, add the translators of Robertson to the witnesses of\r\nthis fact, as himself. Paw, the beginner of this charge, was a compiler\r\nfrom the works of others; and of the most unlucky description; for\r\nhe seems to have read the writings of travellers, only to collect and\r\nrepublish their lies. It is really remarkable, that in three volumes\r\n12mo, of small print, it is scarcely possible to find one truth, and\r\nyet, that the author should be able to produce authority for every\r\nfact he states, as he says he can. Don Ulloa’s testimony is of the most\r\nrespectable. He wrote of what he saw, but he saw the Indian of South\r\nAmerica only, and that, after he had passed through ten generations of\r\nslavery. It is very unfair, from this sample, to judge of the natural\r\ngenius of this race of men; and after supposing that Don Ulloa had not\r\nsufficiently calculated the allowance which should be made for this\r\ncircumstance, we do him no injury in considering the picture he draws\r\nof the present Indians of South America, as no picture of what their\r\nancestors were, three hundred years ago. It is in North America we are\r\nto seek their original character. And I am safe in affirming that the\r\nproofs of genius given by the Indians of North America, place them on\r\na level with whites in the same uncultivated state. The North of Europe\r\nfurnishes subjects enough for comparison with them, and for a proof of\r\ntheir equality. I have seen some thousands myself, and conversed much\r\nwith them, and have found in them a masculine, sound understanding. I\r\nhave had much information from men who had lived among them, and whose\r\nveracity and good sense were so far known to me, as to establish a\r\nreliance on their information. They have all agreed in bearing witness\r\nin favor of the genius of this a people. As to their bodily strength,\r\ntheir manners rendering it disgraceful to labor, those muscles employed\r\nin labor will be weaker with them, than with the European laborer; but\r\nthose which are exerted in the chase, and those faculties which\r\nare employed in the tracing an enemy or a wild beast, in contriving\r\nambuscades for him, and in carrying them through their execution, are\r\nmuch stronger than with us, because they are more exercised. I believe\r\nthe Indian, then, to be, in body and mind, equal to the white man. I\r\nhave supposed the black man, in his present state, might not be so; but\r\nit would be hazardous to affirm, that, equally cultivated for a few\r\ngenerations, he would not become so. 3. As to the inferiority of the\r\nother animals of America, without more facts, I can add nothing to what\r\nI have said in my Notes.\r\n\r\nAs to the theory of Monsieur de Buffon, that heat is friendly, and\r\nmoisture adverse to the production of large animals, I am lately\r\nfurnished with a fact by Dr. Franklin, which proves the air of London\r\nand of Paris to be more humid than that of Philadelphia, and so creates\r\na suspicion that the opinion of the superior humidity of America,\r\nmay, perhaps, have been too hastily adopted. And supposing that fact\r\nadmitted, I think the physical reasonings urged to show, that in a moist\r\ncountry animals must be small, and that in a hot one they must be large,\r\nare not built on the basis of experiment. These questions, however,\r\ncannot be decided ultimately, at this day. More facts must be collected,\r\nand more time flow off, before the world will be ripe for decision. In\r\nthe mean time, doubt is wisdom.\r\n\r\nI have been fully sensible of the anxieties of your situation, and that\r\nyour attentions were wholly consecrated, where alone they were wholly\r\ndue, to the succor of friendship and worth. However much I prize your\r\nsociety, I wait with patience the moment when I can have it without\r\ntaking what is due to another. In the mean time, I am solaced with the\r\nhope of possessing your friendship, and that it is not ungrateful to\r\nyou to receive the assurances of that with which I have the honor to be,\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, June 15, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPassy, June 15, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAmong the instructions given to the ministers of the United States for\r\ntreating with foreign powers, was one of the 11th of May, 1784, relative\r\nto an individual of the name of John Baptist Picquet. It contains an\r\nacknowledgement, on the part of Congress, of his merits and sufferings\r\nby friendly services rendered to great numbers of American seamen\r\ncarried prisoners into Lisbon, and refers to us the delivering him\r\nthese acknowledgements in honorable terms, and the making him such\r\ngratification, as may indemnify his losses, and properly reward his\r\nzeal. This person is now is Paris, and asks whatever return is intended\r\nfor him. Being in immediate want of money, he has been furnished with\r\nten guineas. He expressed, desires of some appointment either for\r\nhimself or son at Lisbon, but has been told that none such are in our\r\ngift, and that nothing more could be done for him in that line, than to\r\nmention to Congress that his services will merit their recollection, if\r\nthey should make any appointment there analogous to his talents. He says\r\nhis expenses in the relief of our prisoners have been upwards of fifty\r\nmoidores. Supposing that, as he is poor, a pecuniary gratification will\r\nbe most useful to him, we propose, in addition to what he has received,\r\nto give him a hundred and fifty guineas, or perhaps four thousand\r\nlivres, and to write a joint letter to him expressing the sense Congress\r\nentertain of his services. We pray you to give us your sentiments on\r\nthis subject by return of the first post, as he is waiting here, and we\r\nwish the aid of your counsels therein.\r\n\r\nWe are to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of June 3rd, informing\r\nus of your reception at the court of London.\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of great respect and esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIII.--TO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, June 16, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nParis,\r\n\r\nJune 16, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of receiving, the day before yesterday, the resolution\r\nof Council, of March the 10th, and your letter of March the 30th, and\r\nshall, with great pleasure, unite my endeavors with those of the Marquis\r\nde la Fayette and Mr. Barclay, for the purpose of procuring the arms\r\ndesired. Nothing can be more wise than this determination to arm our\r\npeople, as it is impossible to say when our neighbors may think proper\r\nto give them exercise. I suppose that the establishing a manufacture\r\nof arms, to go hand in hand with the purchase of them from hence, is at\r\npresent opposed by good reasons. This alone would make us independent\r\nfor an article essential to our preservation; and workmen could probably\r\nbe either got here, or drawn from England, to be embarked hence.\r\n\r\nIn a letter of January the 12th, to Governor Harrison, I informed him of\r\nthe necessity that the statuary should see General Washington; that we\r\nshould accordingly send him over unless the Executive disapproved of it,\r\nin which case I prayed to receive their pleasure. Mr. Houdon being new\r\nre-established in his health, and no countermand received, I hope this\r\nmeasure met the approbation of the Executive: Mr. Houdon will therefore\r\ngo over with Dr. Franklin, some time in the next month.\r\n\r\nI have the honor of enclosing you the substance of propositions which\r\nhave been made from London to the Farmers General of this country,\r\nto furnish them with the tobacco of Virginia and Maryland, which\r\npropositions were procured for me by the Marquis de la Fayette. I take\r\nthe liberty of troubling you with them, on a supposition that it may be\r\npossible to have this article furnished from those two States to this\r\ncountry, immediately, without its passing through the _entrepot_\r\nof London, and the returns for it being made, of course, in London\r\nmerchandise. Twenty thousand hogsheads of tobacco a year, delivered here\r\nin exchange for the produce and manufactures of this country, many\r\nof which are as good, some better, and most of them cheaper than in\r\nEngland, would establish a rivalship for our commerce, which would have\r\nhappy effects in all the three countries. Whether this end will be best\r\neffected by giving out these propositions to our merchants, and exciting\r\nthem to become candidates with the Farmers General for this contract, or\r\nby any other means, your Excellency will best judge on the spot.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of due respect, your\r\nExcellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. I have written on the last subject to the Governor of Maryland\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIV.--TO COLONEL MONROE, June 17, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nParis, June 17, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received three days ago your favor of April the 12th. You therein\r\nspeak of a former letter to me, but it has not come to hand, nor any\r\nother of later date than the 14th of December. My last to you was of the\r\n11th of May, by Mr. Adams, who went in the packet of that month. These\r\nconveyances are now becoming deranged. We have had expectations of their\r\ncoming to Havre, which would infinitely facilitate the communication\r\nbetween Paris and Congress; but their deliberations on the subject seem\r\nto be taking another turn. They complain of the expense, and that their\r\ncommerce with us is too small to justify it. They therefore talk of\r\nsending a packet every six weeks only. The present one, therefore, which\r\nshould have sailed about this time, will not sail till the 1st of July.\r\nHowever, the whole matter is as yet undecided. I have hopes that when\r\nMr. St. John arrives from New York, he will get them replaced on\r\ntheir monthly system. By the bye, what is the meaning of a very\r\nangry resolution of Congress on his subject? I have it not by me, and\r\ntherefore cannot cite it by date, but you will remember it, and oblige\r\nme by explaining its foundation. This will be handed you by Mr.\r\nOtto, who comes to America as Charge, des Affaires, in the room of Mr.\r\nMarbois, promoted to the Intendancy of Hispaniola, which office is next\r\nto that of Governor. He becomes the head of the civil, as the Governor\r\nis of the military department.\r\n\r\nI am much pleased with Otto’s appointment; he is good-humored,\r\naffectionate to America, will see things in a friendly light when they\r\nadmit of it, in a rational one always, and will not pique himself on\r\nwriting every trifling circumstance of irritation to his court. I\r\nwish you to be acquainted with him, as a friendly intercourse between\r\nindividuals who do business together, produces a mutual spirit of\r\naccommodation useful to both parties. It is very much our interest to\r\nkeep up the affection of this country for us, which is considerable.\r\nA court has no affections; but those of the people whom they govern,\r\ninfluence their decisions even in the most arbitrary governments.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations between the Emperor and Dutch are spun out to an\r\namazing length. At present there is no apprehension but that they will\r\nterminate in peace. This court seems to press it with ardor, and the\r\nDutch are averse, considering the terms cruel and unjust, as they\r\nevidently are. The present delays, therefore, are imputed to their\r\ncoldness and to their forms. In the mean time, the Turk is delaying the\r\ndemarcation of limits between him and the Emperor, is making the most\r\nvigorous preparations for war, and has composed his ministry of warlike\r\ncharacters, deemed personally hostile, to the Emperor. Thus time seems\r\nto be spinning out, both by the Dutch and Turks, and time is wanting\r\nfor France. Every year’s delay is a great thing for her. It is not\r\nimpossible, therefore, but that she may secretly encourage the delays\r\nof the Dutch, and hasten the preparations of the Porte, while she is\r\nrecovering vigor herself also, in order to be able to present such a\r\ncombination to the Emperor as may dictate to him to be quiet. But the\r\ndesigns of these courts are unsearchable. It is our interest to pray\r\nthat this country may have no continental war, till our peace with\r\nEngland is perfectly settled. The. merchants of this country continue as\r\nloud and furious as ever against the _Arrêt_ of August, 1784, permitting\r\nour commerce with their islands to a certain degree. Many of them have\r\nactually abandoned their trade. The ministry are disposed to be firm;\r\nbut there is a point at which they will give way: that is, if the\r\nclamors should become such as to endanger their places. It is evident\r\nthat nothing can be done by us, at this time, if we may hope it\r\nhereafter. I like your removal to New York, and hope Congress will\r\ncontinue there, and never execute the idea of building their Federal\r\ntown. Before it could be finished, a change of members in Congress, or\r\nthe admission of new States, would remove them some where else. It is\r\nevident that when a sufficient number of the western states come in,\r\nthey will remove it to Georgetown. In the mean time, it is our interest\r\nthat it should remain where it is, and give no new pretensions to any\r\nother place. I am also much pleased with the proposition to the States\r\nto invest Congress with the regulation of their trade, reserving its\r\nrevenue to the States. I think it a happy idea, removing the only\r\nobjection which could have been justly made to the proposition. The time\r\ntoo is the present, before the admission of the western States. I am\r\nvery differently affected towards the new plan of opening our land\r\noffice, by dividing the lands among the States, and selling them at\r\nvendue. It separates still more the interests of the States, which ought\r\nto be made joint in every possible instance, in order to cultivate the\r\nidea of our being one nation, and to multiply the instances in which the\r\npeople should look up to Congress as their head. And when the States get\r\ntheir portions they will either fool them away, or make a job of it to\r\nserve individuals. Proofs of both these practices have been furnished,\r\nand by either of them that invaluable fund is lost, which ought to pay\r\nour public debt. To sell them at vendue, is to give them to the bidders\r\nof the day, be they many or few. It is ripping up the hen which lays\r\ngolden eggs. If sold in lots at a fixed price, as first proposed, the\r\nbest lots will be sold first; as these become occupied, it gives a value\r\nto the interjacent ones, and raises them, though of inferior quality, to\r\nthe price of the first. I send you by Mr. Otto, a copy of my book. Be so\r\ngood as to apologize to Mr. Thomson for my not sending him one by this\r\nconveyance. I could not burthen Mr. Otto with more, on so long a road as\r\nthat from here to L’Orient. I will send him one by a Mr. Williams, who\r\nwill go ere long. I have taken measures to prevent its publication. My\r\nreason is, that I fear the terms in which I speak of slavery, and of our\r\nconstitution, may produce an irritation which will revolt the minds of\r\nour countrymen against reformation in these two articles, and thus do\r\nmore harm than good. I have asked of Mr. Madison to sound this matter as\r\nfar as he can, and if he thinks it will not produce that effect, I have\r\nthen copies enough printed to give one to each of the young men at the\r\nCollege, and to my friends in the country.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to see a possibility of * * being put into the Treasury.\r\nHe has no talents for the office, and what he has, will be employed in\r\nrummaging old accounts to involve you in eternal war with * *, and he\r\nwill, in a short time, introduce such dissensions into the commission,\r\nas to break it up. If he goes on the other appointment to Kaskaskia, he\r\nwill produce a revolt of that settlement from the United States. I\r\nthank you for your attention to my outfit. For the articles of household\r\nfurniture, clothes, and a carriage, I have already paid twenty-eight\r\nthousand livres, and have still more to pay. For the greatest part of\r\nthis, I have been obliged to anticipate my salary, from which, however,\r\nI shall never be able to repay it. I find, that by a rigid economy,\r\nbordering however on meanness, I can save perhaps, five hundred livres a\r\nmonth, at least in the summer. The residue goes for expenses so much of\r\ncourse and of necessity, that I cannot avoid them without abandoning\r\nall respect to my public character. Yet I will pray you to touch this\r\nstring, which I know to be a tender one with Congress, with the utmost\r\ndelicacy. I had rather be ruined in my fortune, than in their esteem.\r\nIf they allow me half a year’s salary as an outfit, I can get through my\r\ndebts in time. If they raise the salary to what it was, or even pay our\r\nhouse rent and taxes, I can live with more decency. I trust that Mr.\r\nAdams’s house at the Hague, and Dr. Franklin’s at Passy,--the rent of\r\nwhich has been always allowed him, will give just expectations of the\r\nsame allowance to me. Mr. Jay, however, did not charge it, but he lived\r\neconomically and laid up money.\r\n\r\nI will take the liberty of hazarding to you some thoughts on the policy\r\nof entering into treaties with the European nations, and the nature of\r\nthem. I am not wedded to these ideas, and, therefore, shall relinquish\r\nthem cheerfully when Congress shall adopt others, and zealously endeavor\r\nto carry theirs into effect. First, as to the policy of making treaties.\r\nCongress, by the Confederation, have no original and inherent power over\r\nthe commerce of the States. But by the 9th article, they are authorized\r\nto enter into treaties of commerce. The moment these treaties are\r\nconcluded, the jurisdiction of Congress over the commerce of the States,\r\nsprings into existence, and that of the particular States is superseded\r\nso far as the articles of the treaty may have taken up the subject.\r\nThere are two restrictions only, on the exercise of the power of treaty\r\nby Congress. 1st. That they shall not, by such treaty, restrain the\r\nlegislatures of the States from imposing such duties on foreigners,\r\nas their own people are subject to: nor 2ndly, from prohibiting the\r\nexportation or importation of any particular species of goods. Leaving\r\nthese two points free, Congress may, by treaty, establish any system of\r\ncommerce they please; but, as I before observed, it is by treaty\r\nalone they can do it. Though they may exercise their other powers by\r\nresolution or ordinance, those over commerce can only be exercised by\r\nforming a treaty, and this, probably, by an accidental wording of our\r\nConfederation. If, therefore, it is better for the States that Congress\r\nshould regulate their commerce, it is proper that they should form\r\ntreaties with all nations with whom we may possibly trade. You see that\r\nmy primary object in the formation of treaties, is to take the commerce\r\nof the States out of the hands of the States, and to place it under the\r\nsuperintendence of Congress, so far as the imperfect provisions of our\r\nconstitution will admit, and until the States shall, by new compact,\r\nmake them more perfect. I would say then to every nation on earth,\r\nby treaty, your people shall trade freely with us, and ours with you,\r\npaying no more than the most favored nation in order to put an end to\r\nthe right of individual States, acting by fits and starts, to interrupt\r\nour commerce or to embroil us with any nation. As to the terms of these\r\ntreaties, the question becomes more difficult. I will mention three\r\ndifferent plans. 1. That no duties shall be laid by either party on\r\nthe productions of the other. 2. That each may be permitted to equalize\r\ntheir duties to those laid by the other. 3. That each shall pay in the\r\nports of the other, such duties only as the most favored nations pay.\r\n\r\n1. Were the nations of Europe as free and unembarrassed of established\r\nsystems as we are, I do verily believe they would concur with us in the\r\nfirst plan. But it is impossible. These establishments are fixed\r\nupon them; they are interwoven with the body of their laws and the\r\norganization of their government, and they make a great part of their\r\nrevenue; they cannot then get rid of them.\r\n\r\n2. The plan of equal imposts presents difficulties insurmountable. For\r\nhow are the equal imposts to be effected? Is it by laying in the ports\r\nof A, an equal per cent, on the goods of B, with that which B has laid\r\nin his ports on the goods of A? But how are we to find what is that per\r\ncent.? For this is not the usual form of imposts. They generally pay by\r\nthe-ton, by the measure, by the weight, and not by the value. Besides,\r\nif A sends a million’s worth of goods to B, and takes back but the half\r\nof that, and each pays the same per cent., it is evident that A pays\r\nthe double of what he recovers in the same way from B: this would be our\r\ncase with Spain. Shall we endeavor to effect equality, then, by saying\r\nA may levy so much on the sum of B’s importations into his ports, as B\r\ndoes on the sum of A’s importations into the ports of B.? But how\r\nfind out that sum? Will either party lay open their custom-house books\r\ncandidly to evince this sum? Does either keep their books so exactly as\r\nto be able to do it? This proposition was started in Congress when our\r\ninstructions were formed, as you may remember, and the impossibility of\r\nexecuting it occasioned it to be disapproved. Besides, who should have\r\na right of deciding when the imposts were equal. A would say to B, My\r\nimposts do not raise so much as yours; I raise them therefore. B would\r\nthen say, You have made them greater than mine, I will raise mine; and\r\nthus a kind of auction would be carried on between them, and a mutual\r\nirritation, which would end in any thing, sooner than equality and\r\nright.\r\n\r\n3. I confess then to you, that I see no alternative left but that which\r\nCongress adopted, of each party placing the other on the footing of\r\nthe most favored nation. If the nations of Europe, from their actual\r\nestablishments, are not at liberty to say to America, that she shall\r\ntrade in their ports duty free, they may say she may trade there paying\r\nno higher duties than the most favored nation; and this is valuable in\r\nmany of these countries, where a very great difference is made between\r\ndifferent nations. There is no difficulty in the execution of this\r\ncontract, because there is not a merchant who does not know, or may not\r\nknow, the duty paid by every nation on every article. This stipulation\r\nleaves each party at liberty to regulate their own commerce by\r\ngeneral rules, while it secures the other from partial and oppressive\r\ndiscriminations. The difficulty which arises in our case is with\r\nthe nations having American territory. Access to the West Indies\r\nis indispensably necessary to us. Yet how to gain it when it is the\r\nestablished system of these nations to exclude all foreigners from their\r\ncolonies? The only chance seems to be this: our commerce to the mother\r\ncountries is valuable to them. We must indeavor, then, to make this the\r\nprice of an admission into their West Indies, and to those who refuse\r\nthe admission, we must refuse our commerce, or load theirs by odious\r\ndiscriminations in our ports. We have this circumstance in our favor\r\ntoo, that what one grants us in their islands, the others will not\r\nfind it worth their while to refuse. The misfortune is, that with this\r\ncountry we gave this price for their aid in the war, and we have now\r\nnothing more to offer. She being withdrawn from the competition, leaves\r\nGreat Britain much more at liberty to hold out against us. This is the\r\ndifficult part of the business of treaty, and I own it does not hold out\r\nthe most flattering prospects.\r\n\r\nI wish you would consider this subject, and write me your thoughts on\r\nit. Mr. Gerry wrote me on the same subject. Will you give me leave to\r\nimpose on you the trouble of communicating this to him? It is long, and\r\nwill save me much labor in copying. I hope he will be so indulgent as\r\nto consider it as an answer to that part of his letter, and will give\r\nme his further thoughts on it. Shall I send you so much of the\r\n_Encyclopédie_ as is already published, or reserve it here till you\r\ncome? It is about forty volumes which is probably about half the work.\r\nGive yourself no uneasiness about the money; perhaps I may find it\r\nconvenient to ask you to pay trifles occasionally for me in America. I\r\nsincerely wish you may find it convenient to come here; the pleasure of\r\nthe trip will be less than you expect, but the utility greater. It will\r\nmake you adore your own country, its soil, its climate, its equality,\r\nliberty, laws, people, and manners. My God! how little do my countrymen\r\nknow what precious blessings they are in possession of, and which no\r\nother people on earth enjoy. I confess I had no idea of it myself. While\r\nwe shall see multiplied instances of Europeans going to live in America,\r\nI will venture to say no man now living, will ever see an instance of\r\nan American removing to settle in Europe, and continuing there. Come\r\nthen and see the proofs of this, and on your return add your testimony\r\nto that of every thinking American, in order to satisfy our countrymen\r\nhow much it is their interest to preserve, uninfected by contagion,\r\nthose peculiarities in their governments and manners, to which they\r\nare indebted for those blessings. Adieu, my dear friend; present me\r\naffectionately to your colleagues. If any of them think me worth writing\r\nto, they may be assured that in the epistolary account I will keep the\r\ndebit side against them. Once more, adieu.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. June 19. Since writing the above we have received the following\r\naccount: Monsieur Pilatre de Roziere, who had been waiting for some\r\nmonths at Boulogne for a fair wind to cross the channel, at length took\r\nhis ascent with a companion. The wind changed after a while, and brought\r\nhim back on the French coast. Being at a height of about six thousand\r\nfeet, some accident happened to his balloon of inflammable air; it\r\nburst, they fell from that height, and were crushed to atoms. There\r\nwas a montgolfier combined with the balloon of inflammable air. It is\r\nsuspected the heat of the montgolfier rarefied too much the inflammable\r\nair of the other, and occasioned it to burst. The montgolfier came down\r\nin good order.\r\n\r\nT.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXV.--TO CHARLES THOMSON, June 21, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES THOMSON.\r\n\r\nParis, June 21, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of March the 6th has come duly to hand. You therein\r\nacknowledge the receipt of mine of November the 11th; at that time you\r\ncould not have received my last, of February the 8th. At present there\r\nis so little new in politics, literature, or the arts, that I write\r\nrather to prove to you my desire of nourishing your correspondence\r\nthan of being able to give you any thing interesting at this time. The\r\npolitical world is almost lulled to sleep by the lethargic state of the\r\nDutch negotiation, which will probably end in peace. Nor does this court\r\nprofess to apprehend, that the Emperor will involve this hemisphere\r\nin war by his schemes on Bavaria and Turkey. The arts, instead of\r\nadvancing, have lately received a check, which will probably render\r\nstationary for a while, that branch of them which had promised to\r\nelevate us to the skies. Pilatre de Roziere, who had first ventured into\r\nthat region, has fallen a sacrifice to it. In an attempt to pass from\r\nBoulogne over to England, a change in the wind having brought him\r\nback on the coast of France, some accident happened to his balloon of\r\ninflammable air, which occasioned it to burst, and that of rarefied\r\nair combined with it being then unequal to the weight, they fell to the\r\nearth from a height, which the first reports made six thousand feet, but\r\nlater ones have reduced to sixteen hundred. Pilatre de Roziere was dead\r\nwhen a peasant, distant one hundred yards only, run to him; but Romain,\r\nhis companion, lived about ten minutes, though speechless, and without\r\nhis senses. In literature there is nothing new. For I do not consider as\r\nhaving added any thing to that field, my own Notes, of which I have\r\nhad a few copies printed. I will send you a copy by the first safe\r\nconveyance. Having troubled Mr. Otto with one for Colonel Monroe, I\r\ncould not charge him with one for you. Pray ask the favor of Colonel\r\nMonroe, in page 5, line 17, to strike out the words ‘above the mouth of\r\nAppamatox,’ which make nonsense of the passage; and I forgot to correct\r\nit before I had enclosed and sent off the copy to him. I am desirous of\r\npreventing the reprinting this, should any book-merchant think it worth\r\nit, till I hear from my friends, whether the terms in which I have\r\nspoken of slavery and the constitution of our State, will not, by\r\nproducing an irritation, retard that reformation which I wish, instead\r\nof promoting it. Dr. Franklin proposes to sail for America about the\r\nfirst or second week of July. He does not yet know, however, by what\r\nconveyance he can go. Unable to travel by land, he must descend the\r\nSeine in a boat to Havre. He has sent to England to get some vessel\r\nbound for Philadelphia, to touch at Havre for him. But he receives\r\ninformation that this cannot be done. He has been on the lookout ever\r\nsince he received his permission to return; but, as yet, no possible\r\nmeans of getting a passage have offered, and I fear it is very uncertain\r\nwhen any will offer. I am with very great esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVI.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, June 22, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nParis, June 22, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of April the 4th came to my hands on the 16th of that month,\r\nand was acknowledged by mine of May the 3rd. That which you did me the\r\nhonor to write me on the 5th of April, never came to hand until the 19th\r\nof May, upwards of a month after the one of the day before. I have hopes\r\nof sending the present by a Mr. Jarvis, who went from hence to Holland\r\nsome time ago. About this date, I suppose him to be at Brussels, and\r\nthat from thence he will inform me, whether, in his way to Madrid, he\r\nwill pass by this place. If he does, this shall be accompanied by a\r\ncipher for our future use; if he does not, I must still await a safe\r\nopportunity. Mr. Jarvis is a citizen of the United States from New-York,\r\na gentleman of intelligence, in the mercantile line, from whom you will\r\nbe able to get considerable information of American affairs. I think\r\nhe left America in January. He informed us that Congress were about to\r\nappoint a Mr. Lambe, of Connecticut, their consul to Morocco, and to\r\nsend him to their ministers, commissioned to treat with the Barbary\r\npowers, for instructions. Since that, Mr. Jay enclosed to Mr. Adams,\r\nin London, a resolution of Congress deciding definitively on amicable\r\ntreaties with the Barbary States, in the usual way, and informing him\r\nthat he had sent a letter and instructions to us, by Mr. Lambe. Though\r\nit is near three weeks since we received a communication of this from\r\nMr. Adams, yet we hear nothing further of Mr. Lambe. Our powers of\r\ntreating with the Barbary States are full, but in the amount of the\r\nexpense we are limited. I believe you may safely assure them, that they\r\nwill soon receive propositions from us, if you find such an assurance\r\nnecessary to keep them quiet. Turning at this instant to your letter\r\ndated April 5th, and considering it attentively, I am persuaded it must\r\nhave been written on the 5th of May: of this little mistake I ought to\r\nhave been sooner sensible. Our latest letters from America are of the\r\nmiddle of April, and are extremely barren of news. Congress had not yet\r\nproposed a time for their recess, though it was thought a recess would\r\ntake place. Mr. Morris had retired, and the treasury was actually\r\nadministered by commissioners. Their land-office was not yet opened.\r\nThe settlements at Kaskaskia, within the territory ceded to them by\r\nVirginia, had prayed the establishment of a regular government, and they\r\nwere about sending a commissioner to them. General Knox was appointed\r\ntheir secretary of the war-office. These, I think, are the only facts\r\nwe have learned which are worth communicating to you. The inhabitants\r\nof Canada have sent a sensible petition to their King, praying the\r\nestablishment of an Assembly, the benefits of the _habeas corpus_\r\nlaws, and other privileges of British subjects. The establishment of an\r\nAssembly is denied, but most of their other desires granted. We are now\r\nin hourly expectation of the arrival of the packet which should have\r\nsailed from New York in May. Perhaps that may bring us matter which may\r\nfurnish the subject of a more interesting letter.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. July 14. I have thus long waited, day after day, hoping to hear\r\nfrom Mr. Jarvis, that I might send a cipher with this: but now give up\r\nthe hope. No news yet of Mr. Lambe. The packet has arrived, but brings\r\nno intelligence, except that it is doubtful whether Congress will\r\nadjourn this summer. The Assembly of Pennsylvania propose to suppress\r\ntheir bank on principles of policy. T.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, June 23, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, June 23, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of the 2nd instant, since which I have received\r\nyours of the 3rd and 7th. I informed you in mine of the substance of our\r\nletter to Baron Thulemeyer: last night came to hand his acknowledgment\r\nof the receipt of it. He accedes to the method proposed for signing,\r\nand has forwarded our despatch to the King. I enclose you a copy of\r\nour letter to Mr. Jay, to go by the packet of this month. It contains a\r\nstatement of our proceedings since the preceding letter, which you\r\nhad signed with us. This statement contains nothing but what you had\r\nconcurred with us in; and, as Dr. Franklin expects to go early in July\r\nto America, it is probable that the future letters must be written by\r\nyou and myself. I shall therefore take care that you be furnished with\r\ncopies of every thing which comes to hand on the joint business.\r\n\r\nWhat is become of this Mr. Lambe? I am uneasy at the delay of that\r\nbusiness, since we know the ultimate decision of Congress. Dr. Franklin,\r\nhaving a copy of the _Corps Diplomatique_, has promised to prepare a\r\ndraught of a treaty to be offered to the Barbary States: as soon as he\r\nhas done so, we will send it to you for your corrections. We think it\r\nwill be best to have it in readiness against the arrival of Mr. Lambe,\r\non the supposition that he may be addressed to the joint ministers for\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nI asked the favor of you in my last, to choose two of the best London\r\npapers for me; one of each party. The Duke of Dorset has given me leave\r\nto have them put under his address, and sent to the office from which\r\nhis despatches come. I think he called it Cleveland office, or Cleveland\r\nlane, or by some such name; however, I suppose it can easily be known\r\nthere. Will Mr. Stockdale undertake to have these papers sent regularly,\r\nor is this out of the line of his business? Pray order me also any\r\nreally good pamphlets that come out from time to time, which he will\r\ncharge to me.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem, dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVIII.--TO COLONEL MONROE, July 5, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nParis, July 5, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you, by Mr. Adams, May the 11th, and by Mr. Otto, June the 17th.\r\nThe latter acknowledged the receipt of yours of April the 12th, which is\r\nthe only one come to hand of later date than December the 14th. Little\r\nhas occurred since my last. Peace seems to show herself under a more\r\ndecided form. The Emperor is now on a journey to Italy, and the two\r\nDutch Plenipotentiaries have set out for Vienna; there to make an\r\napology for their State having dared to fire a gun in defence of her\r\ninvaded rights: this is insisted on as a preliminary condition. The\r\nEmperor seems to prefer the glory of terror to that of justice; and,\r\nto satisfy this tinsel passion, plants a dagger in the heart of every\r\nDutchman which no time will extract. I inquired lately of a gentleman\r\nwho lived long at Constantinople, in a public character, and enjoyed the\r\nconfidence of that government, insomuch, as to become well acquainted\r\nwith its spirit and its powers, what he thought might be the issue of\r\nthe present affair between the Emperor and the Porte. He thinks the\r\nlatter will not push matters to a war; and, if they do, they must fail\r\nunder it. They have lost their warlike spirit, and their troops cannot\r\nbe induced to adopt the European arms. We have no news yet of Mr. Lambe;\r\nof course our Barbary proceedings are still at a stand.*\r\n\r\n[* The remainder of this letter is in cipher, to which there is no key\r\nin the Editor’s possession.]\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIX.--TO MRS. SPROWLE, July 5,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. SPROWLE.\r\n\r\nParis, July 5,1785.\r\n\r\nMadam,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 21st of June, has come safely to hand. That which you\r\nhad done me the honor of writing before, has not yet been received. It\r\nhaving gone by Dr. Witherspoon to America, which I had left before his\r\nreturn to it, the delay is easily accounted for.\r\n\r\nI wish you may be rightly informed that the property of Mr. Sprowle is\r\nyet unsold. It was advertised so long ago, as to found a presumption\r\nthat the sale has taken place. In any event, you may safely go to\r\nVirginia. It is in the London newspapers only, that exist those mobs and\r\nriots, which are fabricated to deter strangers from going to America.\r\nYour person will be sacredly safe, and free from insult. You can best\r\njudge from the character and qualities of your son, whether he may be\r\nan useful co-adjutor to you there. I suppose him to have taken side with\r\nthe British, before our Declaration of Independence; and, if this was\r\nthe case, I respect the candor of the measure, though I do not its\r\nwisdom. A right to take the side which every man’s conscience approves\r\nin a civil contest, is too precious a right, and too favorable to the\r\npreservation of liberty, not to be protected by all its well informed\r\nfriends. The Assembly of Virginia have given sanction to this right\r\nin several of their laws, discriminating honorably those who took\r\nside against us before the Declaration of Independence, from those\r\nwho remained among us, and strove to injure us by their treacheries.\r\nI sincerely wish that you, and every other to whom this distinction\r\napplies favorably, may find, in the Assembly of Virginia, the good\r\neffects of that justice and generosity, which have dictated to them\r\nthis discrimination. It is a sentiment which will gain strength in their\r\nbreasts, in proportion as they can forget the savage cruelties committed\r\non them, and will, I hope, in the end, reduce them to restore the\r\nproperty itself, wherever it is unsold, and the price received for it,\r\nwhere it has been actually sold.\r\n\r\nI am, Madam,\r\n\r\nyour very humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXX.--TO JOHN ADAMS, July 7, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, July 7, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThis will accompany a joint letter enclosing the draft of a treaty? and\r\nmy private letter of June 23rd, which has waited so long for a private\r\nconveyance. We daily expect from the Baron Thulemeyer the French column\r\nfor our treaty with his sovereign. In the mean while, two copies are\r\npreparing with the English column, which Dr. Franklin wishes to sign\r\nbefore his departure, which will be within four or five days. The\r\nFrench, when received, will be inserted in the blank columns of each\r\ncopy. As the measure of signing at separate times and places is new, we\r\nthink it necessary to omit no other circumstance of ceremony which can\r\nbe observed. That of sending it by a person of confidence, and invested\r\nwith a character relative to the object, who shall attest our signature,\r\nyours in London, and Baron Thulemeyer’s at the Hague, and who shall make\r\nthe actual exchanges, we think will contribute to supply the departure\r\nfrom the original form, in other instances. For this reason, we have\r\nagreed to send Mr. Short on this business, to make him a secretary _pro\r\nhac vice_, and to join Mr. Dumas for the operations of exchange, &c. As\r\nDr. Franklin will have left us before Mr. Short’s mission will commence,\r\nand I have never been concerned in the ceremonials of a treaty, I will\r\nthank you for your immediate information as to the papers he should be\r\nfurnished with from hence. He will repair first to you in London, thence\r\nto the Hague, and then return to Paris.\r\n\r\nWhat has become of Mr. Lambe? Supposing he was to call on the\r\ncommissioners for instructions, and thinking it best these should be in\r\nreadiness, Dr. Franklin undertook to consult well the Barbary treaties\r\nwith other nations, and to prepare a sketch which we should have sent\r\nfor your correction. He tells me he has consulted those treaties, and\r\nmade references to the articles proper for us, which, however, he will\r\nnot have time to put into form, but will leave them with me to reduce.\r\nAs soon as I see them, you shall hear from me. A late conversation with\r\nan English gentleman here, makes me believe, what I did not believe\r\nbefore; that his nation thinks seriously that Congress have no power to\r\nform a treaty of commerce. As the explanations of this matter, which you\r\nand I may separately give, may be handed to their minister, it would be\r\nwell that they should agree. For this reason, as well as for the hope of\r\nyour showing me wherein I am wrong, and confirming me where I am right,\r\nI will give you my creed on the subject. It is contained in these four\r\nprinciples. By the Confederation, Congress have no power given them,\r\nin the first instance, over the commerce of the States. But they have\r\na power given them of entering into treaties of commerce, and these\r\ntreaties may cover the whole field of commerce, with two restrictions\r\nonly. 1. That the States may impose equal duties on foreigners as\r\nnatives: and 2. That they may prohibit the exportation or importation of\r\nany species of goods whatsoever. When they shall have entered into such\r\ntreaty, the superintendence of it results to them; all the operations\r\nof commerce, which are protected by its stipulations, come under their\r\njurisdiction, and the power of the States to thwart them by their\r\nseparate acts, ceases. If Great Britain asks, then, why she should enter\r\ninto treaty with us? why not carry on her commerce without treaty? I\r\nanswer; because till a treaty is made, no consul of hers can be received\r\n(his functions being called into existence by a convention only, and the\r\nStates having abandoned the right of separate agreements and treaties);\r\nno protection to her commerce can be given by Congress; no cover to\r\nit from those checks and discouragements, with which the States will\r\noppress it, acting separately, and by fits and starts. That they will\r\nact so till a treaty is made, Great Britain has had several proofs; and\r\nI am convinced those proofs will become general. It is then to put her\r\ncommerce with us on systematical ground, and under safe cover, that it\r\nbehoves Great Britain to enter into treaty. And I own to you, that my\r\nwish to enter into treaties with the other powers of Europe, arises more\r\nfrom a desire of bringing all our commerce under the jurisdiction of\r\nCongress, than from any other views. Because, according to my idea, the\r\ncommerce of the United States with those countries not under treaty with\r\nus, is under the jurisdiction of each State separately; but that of\r\nthe countries which have treated with us, is under the jurisdiction of\r\nCongress, with the two fundamental restraints only, which I have before\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\nI shall be happy to receive your corrections of these ideas, as I have\r\nfound, in the course of our joint services, that I think right when I\r\nthink with you.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere affection, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. Monsieur Houdon has agreed to go to America to take the figure of\r\nGeneral Washington. In the case of his death, between his departure from\r\nParis and his return to it, we may lose twenty thousand livres. I ask\r\nthe favor of you to inquire what it will cost to ensure that sum on his\r\nlife, in London, and to give me as early an answer as possible, that\r\nI may order the ensurance, if I think the terms easy enough. He is, I\r\nbelieve, between thirty and thirty-five years of age, healthy enough,\r\nand will be absent about six months. T.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXI.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, July 10, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nParis, July 10, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMr. Houdon would much sooner have had the honor of attending you,\r\nbut for a spell of sickness, which long induced us to despair of his\r\nrecovery, and from which he is but recently recovered. He comes now, for\r\nthe purpose of lending the aid of his art to transmit you to posterity.\r\nHe is without rivalship in it, being employed from all parts of Europe\r\nin whatever is capital. He has had a difficulty to withdraw himself from\r\nan order of the Empress of Russia; a difficulty, however, that arose\r\nfrom a desire to show her respect, but which never gave him a moment’s\r\nhesitation about his present voyage, which he considers as promising\r\nthe brightest chapter of his history. I have spoken of him as an artist\r\nonly; but I can assure you also, that, as a man, he is disinterested,\r\ngenerous, candid, and panting after glory: in every circumstance\r\nmeriting your good opinion. He will have need to see you much while he\r\nshall have the honor of being with you; which you can the more freely\r\nadmit, as his eminence and merit give him admission into genteel\r\nsocieties here. He will need an interpreter. I suppose you could procure\r\nsome person from Alexandria, who might be agreeable to yourself, to\r\nperform this office. He brings with him one or two subordinate workmen,\r\nwho of course will associate with their own class only.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the favor of your letter of February the 25th, I\r\ncommunicated the plan for clearing the Potomac, with the act of\r\nAssembly, and an explanation of its probable advantages, to Mr. Grand,\r\nwhose acquaintance and connection with the monied men here, enabled him\r\nbest to try its success. He has done so; but to no end. I enclose\r\nyou his letter. I am pleased to hear in the mean time, that the\r\nsubscriptions are likely to be filled up at home. This is infinitely\r\nbetter, and will render the proceedings of the company much more\r\nharmonious. I place an immense importance to my own country, on this\r\nchannel of connection with the new western States. I shall continue\r\nuneasy till I know that Virginia has assumed her ultimate boundary to\r\nthe westward. The late example of the State of Franklin separating from\r\nNorth Carolina, increases my anxieties for Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe confidence you are so good as to place in me, on the subject of the\r\ninterest lately given you by Virginia in the Potomac company, is very\r\nflattering to me. But it is distressing also, inasmuch as, to deserve\r\nit, it obliges me to give my whole opinion. My wishes to see you made\r\nperfectly easy, by receiving, those just returns of gratitude from our\r\ncountry to which you are entitled, would induce me to be contented with\r\nsaying, what is a certain truth, that the world would be pleased with\r\nseeing them heaped on you, and would consider your receiving them as no\r\nderogation from your reputation. But I must own that the declining them\r\nwill add to that reputation, as it will show that your motives have\r\nbeen pure and without any alloy. This testimony, however, is not wanting\r\neither to those who know you, or who do not. I must therefore repeat,\r\nthat I think the receiving them will not, in the least, lessen the\r\nrespect of the world, if from any circumstances they would be convenient\r\nto you. The candor of my communication will find its justification, I\r\nknow, with you.\r\n\r\nA tolerable certainty of peace leaves little interesting in the way of\r\nintelligence. Holland and the emperor will be quiet. If any thing is\r\nbrewing, it is between the latter and the Porte. Nothing in prospect as\r\nyet from England. We shall bring them, however, to a decision, now that\r\nMr. Adams is received there. I wish much to hear that the canal through\r\nthe Dismal Swamp is resumed.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect and esteem,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, your most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXII.--TO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, July 11, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nParis, July 11, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMr. Houdon’s long and desperate illness has retarded, till now, his\r\ndeparture for Virginia. We had hoped, from our first conversations with\r\nhim, that it would be easy to make our terms, and that the cost of\r\nthe statue and expense of sending him, would be but about a thousand\r\nguineas. But when we came to settle this precisely, he thought himself\r\nobliged to ask vastly more insomuch, that, at one moment, we thought\r\nour treaty at an end. But unwilling to commit such a work to an inferior\r\nhand, we made nim an ultimate proposition on our part. He was as much\r\nmortified at the prospect of not being the executor of such a work, as\r\nwe were, not to have it done by such a hand. He therefore acceded to our\r\nterms; though we are satisfied he will be a considerable loser. We were\r\nled to insist on them, because, in a former letter to the Governor,\r\nI had given the hope we entertained of bringing the whole within one\r\nthousand guineas. The terms are twenty-five thousand livres, or one\r\nthousand English guineas (the English guinea being worth twenty-five\r\nlivres) for the statue and pedestal. Besides this, we pay his expenses\r\ngoing and returning, which we expect will be between four and five\r\nthousand livres: and if he dies on the voyage, we pay his family ten\r\nthousand livres. This latter proposition was disagreeable to us; but\r\nhe has a father, mother, and sisters, who have no resource but in his\r\nlabor: and he is himself one of the best men in the world. He therefore\r\nmade it a _sine qua non_, without which all would have been off. We have\r\nreconciled it to ourselves, by determining to get insurance on his life\r\nmade in London, which we expect can be done for five per cent.; so that\r\nit becomes an additional sum of five hundred livres. I have written\r\nto Mr. Adams to know, for what per cent, the insurance can be had. I\r\nenclose you, for a more particular detail, a copy of the agreement.\r\nDr. Franklin, being on his departure, did not become a party to the\r\ninstrument, though it has been concluded with his approbation. He was\r\ndisposed to give two hundred and fifty guineas more, which would have\r\nsplit the difference between the actual terms and Mr Houdon’s demand.\r\nI wish the State, at the conclusion of the work, may agree to give him\r\nthis much more; because I am persuaded he will be a loser, which I\r\nam sure their generosity would not wish. But I have not given him the\r\nsmallest expectation of it, choosing the proposition should come from\r\nthe State, which will be more honorable. You will perceive by the\r\nagreement, that I pay him immediately 8333 1/3 livres, which is to be\r\nemployed in getting the marble in Italy, its transportation, he. The\r\npackage and transportation of his stucco to make the moulds, will\r\nbe about five hundred livres. I shall furnish him with money for his\r\nexpenses in France, and I have authorized Dr. Franklin, when he arrives\r\nin Philadelphia, to draw on me for money for his other expenses, going,\r\nstaying, and returning. These drafts will have been made probably,\r\nand will be on their way to me, before you receive this, and with the\r\npayments made here, will amount to about five thousand livres more than\r\nthe amount of the bill remitted me. Another third, of 8333 1/3 livres,\r\nwill become due at the end of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nDr. Franklin leaves Passy this morning. As he travels in a litter, Mr.\r\nHoudon will follow him some days hence, and will embark with him for\r\nPhiladelphia. I am in hopes he need not stay in America more than a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with due respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Suggested Packet Project, page251]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIII.--TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, July 12, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n(Private.) Paris, July 12, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI was honored, two days ago, with yours of May the 16th, and thank you\r\nfor the intelligence it contained, much of which was new to me. It\r\nwas the only letter I received by this packet, except one from Mr.\r\nHopkinson, on philosophical subjects. I generally write about a dozen\r\nby every packet, and receive sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes\r\nne’er a one. You are right in supposing all letters opened which come\r\neither through the French or English channel, unless trusted to a\r\npassenger. Yours had evidently been opened, and I think I never\r\nreceived one through the post office which had not been. It is\r\ngenerally discoverable by the smokiness of the wax, and faintness of\r\nthe re-impression. Once they sent me a letter open, having forgotten\r\nto re-seal it. I should be happy to hear that Congress thought of\r\nestablishing packets of their own between New York and Havre; to send a\r\npacket from each port once in two months. The business might possibly be\r\ndone by two packets, as will be seen by the following scheme, wherein we\r\nwill call the two packets A and B.\r\n\r\nJanuary, A sails from New York, B from Havre. February. March. B sails\r\nfrom New York, A from Havre. April. May. A sails from New York, B\r\nfrom Havre. June. July. B sails from New York, A from Havre. August.\r\nSeptember. A sails from New York, B from Havre. October. November. B\r\nsails from New York, A from Havre. December.\r\n\r\nI am persuaded that government would gladly arrange this method with us,\r\nand send their packets in the intermediate months, as they are tired of\r\nthe expense. We should then have a safe conveyance every two months, and\r\none for common matters every month. A courier would pass between this\r\nand Havre in twenty-four hours. Could not the surplus of the post office\r\nrevenue be applied to this? This establishment would look like the\r\ncommencement of a little navy; the only kind of force we ought to\r\npossess. You mention that Congress is on the subject of requisition. No\r\nsubject is more interesting to the honor of the States. It is an opinion\r\nwhich prevails much in Europe, that our government wants authority to\r\ndraw money from the States, and that the States want faith to pay their\r\ndebts. I shall wish much to hear how far the requisitions on the States\r\nare productive of actual cash. Mr. Grand informed me, the other day,\r\nthat the commissioners were dissatisfied with his having paid to this\r\ncountry but two hundred thousand livres, of the four hundred thousand\r\nfor which Mr. Adams drew on Holland; reserving the residue to replace\r\nhis advances and furnish current expenses. They observed that these last\r\nobjects might have been effected by the residue of the money in Holland,\r\nwhich was lying dead. Mr. Grand’s observation to me was, that Mr.\r\nAdams did not like to draw for these purposes, that he himself had\r\nno authority, and that the commissioners had not accompanied their\r\ncomplaints with any draft on that fund; so that the debt still remains\r\nunpaid, while the money is lying dead in Holland. He did not desire me\r\nto mention this circumstance; but should you see the commissioners, it\r\nmight not be amiss to communicate it to them, that they may take any\r\nmeasures they please, if they think it proper to do any thing in it. I\r\nam anxious to hear what is done with the States of Vermont and Franklin.\r\nI think that the former is the only innovation on the system of April\r\n23rd, 1784, which ought ever possibly to be admitted. If Congress are\r\nnot firm on that head, our several States will crumble to atoms by the\r\nspirit of establishing every little canton into a separate State. I hope\r\nVirginia will concur in that plan as to her territory south of the Ohio;\r\nand not leave to the western country to withdraw themselves by force,\r\nand become our worst enemies instead of our best friends.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of great respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIV.--TO THE VIRGINIA DELEGATES IN CONGRESS, July 12,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE VIRGINIA DELEGATES IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nParis, July 12,1785.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the orders of the legislative and executive bodies of\r\nVirginia, I have engaged Monsieur Houdon to make the statue of General\r\nWashington. For this purpose it is necessary for him to see the General.\r\nHe therefore goes with Doctor Franklin, and will have the honor of\r\ndelivering you this himself. As his journey is at the expense of the\r\nState, according to our contract, I will pray you to favor him with your\r\npatronage and counsels, and to protect him as much as possible, from\r\nthose impositions to which strangers are but too much exposed. I have\r\nadvised him to proceed in the stages to the General’s. I have also\r\nagreed, if he can see Generals Greene and Gates, whose busts he has\r\na desire to execute, that he may make a moderate deviation for this\r\npurpose, after he has done with General Washington.\r\n\r\nBut the most important object with him, is to be employed to make\r\nGeneral Washington’s equestrian statue for Congress. Nothing but the\r\nexpectation of this, could have engaged him to have undertaken this\r\nvoyage; as the pedestrian statue for Virginia will not make it worth\r\nthe business he loses by absenting himself. I was therefore obliged to\r\nassure him of my recommendations for this greater work. Having acted in\r\nthis for the State, you will, I hope, think yourselves in some measure\r\nbound to patronize and urge his being employed by Congress. I would not\r\nhave done this myself, nor asked you to do it, did I not see that it\r\nwould be better for Congress to put this business into his hands, than\r\ninto those of any other person living, for these reasons: 1. He is,\r\nwithout rivalship, the first statuary of this age; as a proof of which,\r\nhe receives orders from every other country for things intended to\r\nbe capital. 2. He will have seen General Washington, have taken his\r\nmeasures in every part, and, of course, whatever he does of him will\r\nhave the merit of being original, from which other workmen can only\r\nfurnish copies. 3. He is in possession of the house, the furnaces, and\r\nall the apparatus provided for making the statue of Louis XV. If any\r\nother workman be employed, this will all have to be provided anew, and\r\nof course, to be added to the price of the statue; for no man can ever\r\nexpect to make two equestrian statues. The addition which this would be\r\nto the price, will much exceed the expectation of any person who has\r\nnot seen that apparatus. In truth it is immense. As to the price of the\r\nwork, it will be much greater than Congress is probably aware of. I have\r\ninquired somewhat into this circumstance, and find the prices of those\r\nmade for two centuries past, have been from one hundred and twenty\r\nthousand guineas, down to sixteen thousand guineas, according to\r\nthe size. And as far as I have seen, the smaller they are, the more\r\nagreeable. The smallest yet made, is infinitely above the size of\r\nlife, and they all appear outrees and monstrous. That of Louis XV., is\r\nprobably the best in the world, and it is the smallest here. Yet it\r\nis impossible to find a point of view, from which it does not appear\r\na monster, unless you go so far as to lose sight of the features, and\r\nfiner lineaments of the face and body. A statue is not made like a\r\nmountain, to be seen at a great distance. To perceive those minuter\r\ncircumstances which constitute its beauty, you must be near it, and,\r\nin that case, it should be so little above the size of the life, as to\r\nappear actually of that size, from your point of view. I should not,\r\ntherefore, fear to propose, that the one intended by Congress should be\r\nconsiderably smaller than any of those to be seen here; as I think it\r\nwill be more beautiful, and also cheaper. I have troubled you with these\r\nobservations, as they have been suggested to me from an actual sight of\r\nworks of this kind, and I supposed they might assist you in making up\r\nyour minds on this subject. In making a contract with Monsieur Houdon it\r\nwould not be proper to advance money, but as his disbursements and labor\r\nadvance. As it is a work of many years, this will render the expense\r\ninsensible. The pedestrian statue of marble, is to take three years; the\r\nequestrian, of course, would take much more. Therefore the sooner it is\r\nbegun, the better.\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of the highest respect, Gentlemen,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXV.--TO JOHN JAY, July 12,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, July 12,1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy last letter to you was dated the 17th of June. The present serves to\r\ncover some papers put into my hands by Captain Paul Jones. They respect\r\nan ancient matter, which is shortly this.\r\n\r\nWhile Captain Jones was hovering on the coast of England, in the\r\nyear 1779, a British pilot, John Jackson by name, came on board him,\r\nsupposing him to be British. Captain Jones found it convenient to detain\r\nhim as a pilot, and, in the action with the Serapis, which ensued, this\r\nman lost his arm. It is thought that this gives him a just claim to the\r\nsame allowance with others, who have met with the like misfortune in\r\nthe service of the United States. Congress alone being competent to this\r\napplication, it is my duty to present the case to their consideration;\r\nwhich I beg leave to do through you.\r\n\r\nDr. Franklin will be able to give you so perfect a state of all\r\ntransactions relative to his particular office in France, as well as to\r\nthe subjects included in our general commission, that it is unnecessary\r\nfor me to enter on them. His departure, with the separate situation of\r\nMr. Adams and myself, will render it difficult to communicate to you\r\nthe future proceedings of the commission, as regularly as they have\r\nbeen heretofore. We shall do it, however, with all the punctuality\r\npracticable, either separately or jointly, as circumstances may require\r\nand admit.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVI.--TO MONSIEUR BRIET, July 13, 1785\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR BRIET.\r\n\r\nParis, July 13, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that the Council have ordered restitution of the\r\nmerchandise seized at L’Orient, contrary to the freedom of the place.\r\nWhen a court of justice has taken cognizance of a complaint, and has\r\ngiven restitution of the principal subject, if it refuses some of\r\nthe accessories, we are to presume that some circumstance of evidence\r\nappeared to them, unknown to us, and which rendered its refusal just and\r\nproper. So, in the present case, if any circumstances in the conduct of\r\nthe owner, or relative to the merchandise itself, gave probable grounds\r\nof suspicion that they were not entitled to the freedom of the port,\r\ndamages for the detention might be properly denied. Respect for the\r\nintegrity of courts of justice, and especially of so high a one as that\r\nof the King’s Council, obliges us to presume that circumstances arose\r\nwhich justified this part of their order. It is only in cases where\r\njustice is palpably denied, that one nation, or its ministers, are\r\nauthorized to complain of the courts of another. I hope you will see,\r\ntherefore, that an application from me as to the damages for detention,\r\nwould be improper.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVII.--TO MESSRS. FRENCH AND NEPHEW, July 13,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. FRENCH AND NEPHEW.\r\n\r\nParis, July 13,1785.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of receiving your letter of June the 21st, enclosing one\r\nfrom Mr. Alexander of June the 17th, and a copy of his application to\r\nMonsieur de Calonne. I am very sensible that no trade can be on a more\r\ndesperate footing than that of tobacco, in this country; and that our\r\nmerchants must abandon the French markets, if they are not permitted to\r\nsell the productions they bring, on such terms as will enable them to\r\npurchase reasonable returns in the manufactures of France. I know but\r\none remedy to the evil; that of allowing a free vent: and I should be\r\nvery happy in being instrumental to the obtaining this. But while the\r\npurchase of tobacco is monopolized by a company, and they pay for that\r\nmonopoly a heavy price to the government, they doubtless are at liberty\r\nto fix such places and terms of purchase, as may enable them to make\r\ngood their engagements with government. I see no more reason for\r\nobliging them to give a greater price for tobacco than they think they\r\ncan afford, than to do the same between two individuals treating for\r\na horse, a house, or any thing else. Could this be effected by\r\napplications to the minister, it would only be a palliative which would\r\nretard the ultimate cure, so much to be wished for and aimed at by every\r\nfriend to this country, as well as to America.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Gentlemen,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVIII.--TO DR. STILES, July 17,1785\r\n\r\nTO DR. STILES.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, July 17,1785.\r\n\r\nI have long deferred doing myself the honor of writing to you,\r\nwishing for an opportunity to accompany my letter with a copy of the\r\n_Bibliothèque Physico-oeconomique_, a book published here lately in\r\nfour small volumes, and which gives an account of all the improvements\r\nin the arts which have been made for some years past. I flatter myself\r\nyou will find in it many things agreeable and useful. I accompany it\r\nwith the volumes of the _Connoissance des Terns_ for the years 1781,\r\n1784, 1785, 1786, 1787. But why, you will ask, do I send you old\r\nalmanacs, which are proverbially useless? Because, in these publications\r\nhave appeared, from time to time, some of the most precious things in\r\nastronomy. I have searched out those particular volumes which might be\r\nvaluable to you on this account. That of 1781 contains De la Caillie’s\r\ncatalogue of fixed stars reduced to the commencement of that year, and\r\na table of the aberrations and nutations of the principal stars. 1784\r\ncontains the same catalogue with the _nébuleuses_ of Messier. 1785\r\ncontains the famous catalogue of Flamsteed, with the positions of the\r\nstars reduced to the beginning of the year 1784, and which supersedes\r\nthe use of that immense book. 1786 gives you Euler’s lunar tables\r\ncorrected; and 1787, the tables for the planet Herschel. The two last\r\nneeded not an apology, as not being within the description of old\r\nalmanacs. It is fixed on grounds which scarcely admit a doubt, that the\r\nplanet Herschel was seen by Mayer in the year 1756, and was considered\r\nby him as one of the zodiacal stars, and, as such, arranged in his\r\ncatalogue, being the 964th which he describes. This 964th of Mayer has\r\nbeen since missing, and the calculations for the planet Herschel show\r\nthat, it should have been, at the time of Mayer’s observation, where he\r\nplaces his 964th star. The volume of 1787 gives you Mayer’s catalogue of\r\nthe zodiacal stars. The researches of the natural philosophers of Europe\r\nseem mostly in the field of chemistry, and here, principally, on the\r\nsubjects of air and fire. The analysis of these two subjects presents\r\nto us very new ideas. When speaking of the _Bibliothèque\r\nPhysico-oeconomique_, T should have observed, that since its\r\npublication, a man in this city has invented a method of moving a vessel\r\non the water, by a machine worked within the vessel. I went to see it.\r\nHe did not know himself the principle of his own invention. It is a\r\nscrew with a very broad, thin worm, or rather it is a thin plate with\r\nits edge applied spirally round an axis. This being turned, operates on\r\nthe air, as a screw does, and may be literally said to screw the vessel\r\nalong: the thinness of the medium, and its want of resistance,\r\noccasion a loss of much of the force. The screw, I think, would be more\r\neffectual, if placed below the surface of the water. I very much suspect\r\nthat a countrymen of ours, Mr. Bushnel of Connecticut, is entitled to\r\nthe merit of a prior discovery of this use of the screw. I remember to\r\nhave heard of his submarine navigation during the war, and, from what\r\nColonel Humphreys now tells me, I conjecture that the screw was the\r\npower he used. He joined to this a machine for exploding under water\r\nat a given moment. If it were not too great a liberty for a stranger to\r\ntake, I would ask from him a narration of his actual experiments, with\r\nor without a communication of his principle, as he should choose. If he\r\nthought proper to communicate it, I would engage never to disclose it,\r\nunless I could find an opportunity of doing it for his benefit. I thank\r\nyou for your information as to the greatest bones found on the Hudson\r\nriver. I suspect that they must have been of the same animal with those\r\nfound on the Ohio: and if so, they could not have belonged to any human\r\nfigure, because they are accompanied with tusks of the size, form, and\r\nsubstance of those of the elephant. I have seen a part of the ivory,\r\nwhich was very good. The animal itself must have been much larger\r\nthan an elephant. Mrs. Adams gives me an account of a flower found in\r\nConnecticut, which vegetates when suspended in the air. She brought one\r\nto Europe. What can be this flower? It would be a curious present to\r\nthis continent.\r\n\r\nThe accommodation likely to take place between the Dutch and the\r\nEmperor, leaves us without that unfortunate resource for news, which\r\nwars give us. The Emperor has certainly had in view the Bavarian\r\nexchange of which you have heard; but so formidable an opposition\r\npresented itself, that he has thought proper to disavow it. The Turks\r\nshow a disposition to go to war with him; but if this country can\r\nprevail on them to remain in peace, they will do so. It has been thought\r\nthat the two Imperial courts have a plan of expelling the Turks from\r\nEurope. It is really a pity, so charming a country should remain in the\r\nhands of a people, whose religion forbids the admission of science and\r\nthe arts among them. We should wish success to the object of the two\r\nempires, if they meant to leave the country in possession of the Greek\r\ninhabitants. We might then expect, once more, to see the language of\r\nHomer and Demosthenes a living language. For I am persuaded the modern\r\nGreek would easily get back to its classical models. But this is not\r\nintended. They only propose to put the Greeks under other masters; to\r\nsubstitute one set of barbarians for another.\r\n\r\nColonel Humphreys having satisfied you that all attempts would be\r\nfruitless here, to obtain money or other advantages for your college, I\r\nneed add nothing on that head. It is a method of supporting colleges\r\nof which they have no idea, though they practise it for the support of\r\ntheir lazy monkish institutions.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect and esteem, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIX.--TO JOHN ADAMS, July 28, 1785\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, July 28, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favors of Jury the 16th and 18th came to hand the same day on which\r\nI had received Baron Thulemeyer’s, enclosing the ultimate draught for\r\nthe treaty. As this draught, which was in French, was to be copied into\r\nthe two instruments which Dr. Franklin had signed, it is finished this\r\nday only. Mr. Short sets out immediately. I have put into his hands\r\na letter of instructions how to conduct himself, which I have signed,\r\nleaving a space above for your signature. The two treaties I have signed\r\nat the left hand, Dr. Franklin having informed me that the signatures\r\nare read backwards. Besides the instructions to Mr. Short, I signed\r\nalso a letter to. Mr. Dumas, associating him with Mr. Short. These\r\ntwo letters I made out as nearly conformably as I could, to your ideas\r\nexpressed in your letter of the 18th. If any thing more be necessary, be\r\nso good as to make a separate instruction for them, signed by yourself,\r\nto which I will accede. I have not directed Mr. Dumas’s letter. I\r\nhave heretofore directed to him as ‘Agent for the United States at the\r\nHague,’ that being the description under which the journals of Congress\r\nspeak of him. In his last letter to me, is a paragraph, from which I\r\nconclude that the address I have used is not agreeable, and perhaps may\r\nbe wrong. Will you be so good as to address the letter to him, and to\r\ninform me how to address him hereafter. Mr. Short carries also the other\r\npapers necessary. His equipment for his journey requiring expenses which\r\ncannot come into the account of ordinary expenses, such as clothes, &,c.\r\nwhat allowance should be made him? I have supposed somewhere between a\r\nguinea a day, and one thousand dollars a year, which I believe is\r\nthe salary of a private secretary. This I mean as over and above his\r\ntravelling expenses. Be so good as to say, and I will give him an order\r\non his return. The danger of robbery has induced me to furnish him with\r\nonly money enough to carry him to London. You will be so good as to\r\nprocure him enough to carry him to the Hague and back to Paris. The\r\nconfederation of the King of Prussia with some members of the Germanic\r\nbody, for the preservation of their constitution, is, I think, beyond\r\na doubt. The Emperor has certainly complained of it in formal\r\ncommunications at several courts. By what can be collected from\r\ndiplomatic conversation here, I also conclude it tolerably certain, that\r\nthe Elector of Hanover has been invited to accede to the confederation,\r\nand has done or is doing so. You will have better circumstances however,\r\non the spot, to form a just judgment. Our matters with the first of\r\nthese powers being now in conclusion, I wish it was so with the Elector\r\nof Hanover. I conclude, from the general expressions in your letter,\r\nthat little may be expected. Mr. Short furnishing so safe a conveyance\r\nthat the trouble of the cipher may me dispensed with, I will thank you\r\nfor such details of what has passed, as may not be too troublesome to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of getting books into Paris, delayed for some time my\r\nreceipt of the _Corps Diplomatique_ left by Dr. Franklin. Since that, we\r\nhave been engaged with expediting Mr. Short. A huge packet also, brought\r\nby Mr. Mazzei, has added to the causes which have as yet prevented me\r\nfrom examining Dr. Franklin’s notes on the Barbary treaty. It shall be\r\none of my first occupations. Still the possibility is too obvious that\r\nwe may run counter to the instructions of Congress, of which Mr. Lambe\r\nis said to be the bearer. There is a great impatience in America for\r\nthese treaties. I am much distressed between this impatience and the\r\nknown will of Congress, on the one hand, and the uncertainty of the\r\ndetails committed to this tardy servant.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Dorset sets out for London to-morrow. He says he shall be\r\nabsent two months. There is some whisper that he will not return, and\r\nthat, Lord Carmarthen wishes to come here. I am sorry to lose so\r\nhonest a man as the Duke. I take the liberty to ask an answer about the\r\ninsurance of Houdon’s life.\r\n\r\nCongress is not likely to adjourn this summer. They have passed an\r\nordinance for selling their lands. I have not received it.\r\n\r\nWhat would you think of the enclosed draught to be proposed to the\r\ncourts of London and Versailles? I would add Madrid and Lisbon, but that\r\nthey are still more desperate than the others. I know it goes beyond our\r\npowers; and beyond the powers of Congress too; but it is so evidently\r\nfor the good of all the States, that I should not be afraid to risk\r\nmyself on it, if you are of the same opinion. Consider it, if you\r\nplease, and give me your thoughts on it by Mr. Short: but I do not\r\ncommunicate it to him, nor any other mortal living but yourself.\r\n\r\nBe pleased to present me in the most friendly terms to the ladies, and\r\nbelieve me to be, with great esteem,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXX.--TO HOGENDORP, July 29, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HOGENDORP.\r\n\r\nParis, July 29, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nBy an American gentleman who went to the Hague, about a month ago, I\r\nsent you a copy of my Notes on Virginia. Having since that received some\r\ncopies of the revisal of our laws, of which you had desired one, I now\r\nsend it to you. I congratulate you sincerely on the prospect of your\r\ncountry’s being freed from the menace of war, which, however just, is\r\nalways expensive and calamitous, and sometimes unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nCongress, having made a very considerable purchase of land from the\r\nIndians, have established a land office, and settled the mode of selling\r\nthe lands. Their plan is judicious. I apprehend some inconveniences in\r\nsome parts of it; but if such should be found to exist, they will amend\r\nthem. They receive in payment their own certificates, at par with actual\r\nmoney. We have a proof the last year, that the failure of the States\r\nto bring money into the treasury, has proceeded, not from any\r\nunwillingness, but from the distresses of their situation. Heretofore,\r\nMassachusetts and Pennsylvania had brought in the most money, and\r\nVirginia was among the least. The last year, Virgjnia has paid in more\r\nthan all the rest together. The reason is, that she is at liberty to\r\navail herself of her natural resources and has free markets for them;\r\nwhereas the others which, while they were sure of a sale for their\r\ncommodities, brought more into the treasury; now, that that sale is, by\r\ncircumstances, rendered more precarious, they bring in but little.\r\n\r\nThe impost is not yet granted. Rhode Island and New York hold off.\r\nCongress have it in contemplation to propose to the States, that\r\nthe direction of all their commerce shall be committed to Congress,\r\nreserving to the States, respectively, the revenue which shall be laid\r\non it. The operations of our good friends, the English, are calculated\r\nas precisely to bring the States into this measure as if we directed\r\nthem ourselves, and as they were, through the whole war, to produce\r\nthat union which was so necessary for us. I doubt whether Congress will\r\nadjourn this summer.\r\n\r\nShould you be at the Hague, I will beg leave to make known to you bearer\r\nhereof, M, William Short. He of Virginia, has come to stay some time\r\nwith me at Paris being among my most particular friends. Though young,\r\nhis talents and merit are such as to have placed him in the Council of\r\nState of Virginia; an office which he relinquished to make a visit to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very high esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXI.--TO MESSRS. N. AND J. VAN STAPHORST, July 30, 1785\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. N. AND J. VAN STAPHORST, Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nParis, July 30, 1785.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nI received yesterday your favor of the 25th. Supposing that the funds,\r\nwhich are the object of your inquiry, are those which constitute what\r\nwe call our domestic debt, it is my opinion that they are absolutely\r\nsecure: I have no doubt at all but that they will be paid, with their\r\ninterest at six per cent. But I cannot say that they are as secure and\r\nsolid as the funds which constitute our foreign debt: because no man\r\nin America ever entertained a doubt that our foreign debt is to be paid\r\nfully; but some people in America have seriously contended, that the\r\ncertificates and other evidences of our domestic debt, ought to be\r\nredeemed only at what they have cost the holder; for I must observe\r\nto you, that these certificates of domestic debt, having as yet no\r\nprovision for the payment of principal or interest, and the original\r\nholders being mostly needy, have been sold at a very great discount.\r\nWhen I left America (July, 1784,) they sold in different States at from\r\n15s. to 2s. 6d. in the pound; and any amount of them might, then have\r\nbeen purchased. Hence some thought that full justice would be done, if\r\nthe public paid the purchasers of them what they actually paid for them,\r\nand interest on that. But this is very far from being a general opinion;\r\na very great majority being firmly decided that they shall be paid\r\nfully. Were I the holder of any of them, I should not have the least\r\nfear of their full payment. There is also a difference between different\r\nspecies of certificates; some of them being receivable in taxes, others\r\nhaving the benefit of particular assurances, &c. Again, some of these\r\ncertificates are for paper-money debts. A deception here must be guarded\r\nagainst. Congress ordered all such to be re-settled by the depreciation\r\ntables, and a new certificate to be given in exchange for them,\r\nexpressing their value in real money. But all have not yet been\r\nre-settled. In short, this is a science in which few in America are\r\nexpert, and no person in a foreign country can be so. Foreigners should\r\ntherefore be sure that they are well advised, before they meddle with\r\nthem, or they may suffer. If you will reflect with what degree of\r\nsuccess persons actually in America could speculate in the European\r\nfunds, which rise and fall daily, you may judge how far those in Europe\r\nmay do it in the American funds, which are more variable from a variety\r\nof causes.\r\n\r\nI am not at all acquainted with Mr. Daniel Parker, farther than having\r\nonce seen him in Philadelphia. He is of Massachusetts, I believe, and\r\nI am of Virginia. His circumstances are utterly unknown to me. I think\r\nthere are few men in America, if there is a single one, who could\r\ncommand a hundred thousand pounds’ sterling worth of these notes, at\r\ntheir real value. At their nominal amount, this might be done perhaps\r\nwith twenty-five thousand pounds sterling, if the market price of\r\nthem be as low as when I left America. I am with very great respect,\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, July 31, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, July 31, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI was honored yesterday with yours of the 24th instant. When the first\r\narticle of our instructions of May 7th, 1784, was under debate in\r\nCongress, it was proposed that neither party should make the other\r\npay, in their ports, greater duties, than they paid in the ports of the\r\nother. One objection to this was, its impracticability; another, that it\r\nwould put it out of our power to lay such duties on alien importation as\r\nmight encourage importation by natives. Some members, much attached\r\nto English policy, thought such a distinction should actually be\r\nestablished. Some thought the power to do it should be reserved, in case\r\nany peculiar circumstances should call for it, though under the present,\r\nor perhaps, any probable circumstances, they did not think it would be\r\ngood policy ever to exercise it. The footing _gentis amicissimæ_ was\r\ntherefore adopted, as you see in the instruction. As far as my inquiries\r\nenable me to judge, France and Holland make no distinction of duties\r\nbetween aliens and natives. I also rather believe that the other states\r\nof Europe make none, England excepted, to whom this policy, as that\r\nof her navigation act, seems peculiar. The question then is, should\r\nwe disarm ourselves of the power to make this distinction against all\r\nnations, in order to purchase an exemption from the alien duties in\r\nEngland only; for if we put her importations on the footing of native,\r\nall other nations with whom we treat will have a right to claim the\r\nsame. I think we should, because against other nations, who make no\r\ndistinction in their ports between us and their own subjects, we ought\r\nnot to make a distinction in ours. And if the English will agree, in\r\nlike manner, to make none, we should, with equal reason, abandon the\r\nright as against them. I think all the world would gain, by setting\r\ncommerce at perfect liberty. I remember that when we were digesting\r\nthe general form of our treaty, this proposition to put foreigners and\r\nnatives on the same footing, was considered: and we were all three, Dr.\r\nFranklin as well as you and myself, in favor of it. We finally, however,\r\ndid not admit it, partly from the objection you mention, but more still\r\non account of our instructions. But though the English proclamation had\r\nappeared in America at the time of framing these instructions, I think\r\nits effect, as to alien duties, had not yet been experienced, and\r\ntherefore was not attended to. If it had been noted in the debate, I am\r\nsure that the annihilation of our whole trade would have been thought\r\ntoo great a price to pay for the reservation of a barren power, which\r\na majority of the members did not propose ever to exercise, though they\r\nwere willing to retain it. Stipulating for equal rights to foreigners\r\nand natives, we obtain more in foreign ports than our instructions\r\nrequired, and we only part with, in our own ports, a power, of which\r\nsound policy would probably for ever forbid the exercise. Add to this,\r\nthat our treaty will be for a very short term, and if any evil be\r\nexperienced under it, a reformation will soon be in our power. I am,\r\ntherefore, for putting this among our original propositions to the court\r\nof London.\r\n\r\nIf it should prove an insuperable obstacle with them, or if it should\r\nstand in the way of a greater advantage, we can but abandon it in the\r\ncourse of the negotiation.\r\n\r\nIn my copy of the cipher, on the alphabetical side, numbers are wanting\r\nfrom ‘Denmark’ to ‘disc’ inclusive, and from ‘gone’ to ‘governor’\r\ninclusive. I suppose them to have been omitted in copying; will you be\r\nso good as to send them to me from yours, by the first safe conveyance.\r\n\r\nWith compliments to the ladies and to Colonel Smith,\r\n\r\nI am, dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.*\r\n\r\n[* The original of this letter was in cipher. But annexed to the copy in\r\ncipher, is the above literal copy by the author.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIII.--TO M. DE CASTRIES, August 3,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE CASTRIES.\r\n\r\nParis, August 3,1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe enclosed copy of a letter from Captain John Paul Jones, on the\r\nsubject on which your Excellency did me the honor to write me, on\r\nthe day of July, will inform you that there is still occasion to be\r\ntroublesome to you. A Mr. Puchilburg, a merchant of L’Orient, who seems\r\nto have kept himself unknown till money was to be received, now presents\r\npowers to receive it, signed by the American officers and crews:\r\nand this produces a hesitation in the person to whom your order was\r\ndirected. Congress, however, having substituted Captain Jones, as agent,\r\nto solicit and receive this money, he having given them security to\r\nforward it, when received, to their treasury, to be thence distributed\r\nto the claimants, and having at a considerable expense of time, trouble,\r\nand money, attended it to a conclusion, are circumstances of weight,\r\nagainst which Mr. Puchilburg seems to have nothing to oppose, but a\r\nnomination by individuals of the crew, under which he has declined\r\nto act, and permitted the business to be done by another without\r\ncontradiction from him. Against him, too, it is urged that he fomented\r\nthe sedition which took place among them, that he obtained this\r\nnomination from them while their minds were under ferment; and that he\r\nhas given no security for the faithful payment of the money to those\r\nentitled to it.\r\n\r\nI will add to these, one more circumstance which appears to render it\r\nimpossible that he should execute this trust. It is now several years\r\nsince the right to this money arose. The persons in whom it originally\r\nvested, were probably from different States in America. Many of them\r\nmust be now dead; and their rights passed on to their representatives.\r\nBut who are their representatives? The laws of some States prefer one\r\ndegree of relations, those of others prefer another, there being no\r\nuniformity among the States on this point. Mr. Puchilberg, therefore,\r\nshould know which of the parties are dead; in what order the laws of\r\ntheir respective States call their relations to the succession; and,\r\nin every case, which of those orders are actually in existence, and\r\nentitled to the share of the deceased. With the Atlantic ocean between\r\nthe principals and their substitute, your Excellency will perceive what\r\nan inexhaustible source of difficulties, of chicanery, and delay, this\r\nmight furnish to a person who should find an interest in keeping this\r\nmoney, as long as possible, in his own hands. Whereas, if it be lodged\r\nin the treasury of Congress, they, by an easy reference to the tribunals\r\nof the different States, can have every one’s portion immediately\r\nrendered to himself, if living; and if dead, to such of his relations as\r\nthe laws of his particular State prefer, and as shall be found actually\r\nliving. I the rather urge this course, as I foresee that it will\r\nrelieve your Excellency from numberless appeals which these people will\r\ncontinually be making from the decisions of Mr. Puchilberg; appeals\r\nlikely to perpetuate that trouble of which you have already had\r\ntoo much, and to which I am sorry to be obliged to add, by asking a\r\nperemptory order for the execution of what you were before pleased to\r\ndecide, on this subject.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIV.--TO CAPTAIN JOHN PAUL JONES, August 3,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN JOHN PAUL JONES.\r\n\r\nParis, August 3,1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI received yesterday your favor of the 29th, and have written on the\r\nsubject of it to the Maréchal de Castries this morning. You shall have\r\nan answer as soon as I receive one. Will you be so good as to make an\r\ninquiry into all the circumstances relative to Peyrouse’s expedition,\r\nwhich seem to ascertain his destination. Particularly what number\r\nof men, and of what conditions and vocations, had he on board? What\r\nanimals, their species and number? What trees, plants, or seeds? What\r\nutensils? What merchandise or other necessaries? This inquiry should be\r\nmade with as little appearance of interest in it as possible. Should you\r\nnot be able to get satisfactory information without going to Brest, and\r\nit be inconvenient for you to go there, I will have the expenses, this\r\nshall occasion you, paid. Commit all the circumstances to writing, and\r\nbring them when you come yourself, or send them by a safe hand.\r\n\r\nI am, with much respect, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXV.--TO JOHN ADAMS, August 6, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, August 6, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI now enclose you a draught of a treaty for the Barbary States, together\r\nwith the notes Dr. Franklin left me. I have retained a press copy of\r\nthis draught, so that by referring to any article, line, and word, in\r\nit, you can propose amendments and send them by the post, without any\r\nbody’s being able to make much of the main subject. I shall be glad to\r\nreceive any alterations you may think necessary, as soon as convenient,\r\nthat this matter may be in readiness. I enclose also a letter containing\r\nintelligence from Algiers. I know not how far it is to be relied on. My\r\nanxiety is extreme indeed, as to these treaties. We know that Congress\r\nhave decided ultimately to treat. We know how far they will go. But\r\nunfortunately we know also, that a particular person has been charged\r\nwith instructions for us, these five months, who neither comes nor\r\nwrites to us. What are we to do? It is my opinion that if Mr. Lambe does\r\nnot come in either of the packets (English or French) now expected, we\r\nought to proceed. I therefore propose to you this term, as the end of\r\nour expectations of him, and that if he does not come, we send some\r\nother person. Dr. Bancroft or Captain Jones occurs to me as the fittest.\r\nIf we consider the present object only, I think the former would be the\r\nmost proper: but if we look forward to the very probable event of war\r\nwith those pirates, an important object would be obtained by Captain\r\nJones’s becoming acquainted with their ports, force, tactics, &c. Let\r\nme know your opinion on this. I have never mentioned it to either, but I\r\nsuppose either might be induced to go. Present me affectionately to the\r\nladies and Colonel Smith, and be assured of the sincerity with which I\r\nam,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVI.--TO DR. PRICE, August 7,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. PRICE.\r\n\r\nParis, August 7,1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of July the 2nd came duly to hand. The concern you therein\r\nexpress as to the effect of your pamphlet in America, induces me to\r\ntrouble you with some observations on that subject. From my acquaintance\r\nwith that country, I think I am able to judge, with some degree of\r\ncertainty, of the manner in which it will have been received. Southward\r\nof the Chesapeake it will find but few readers concurring with it in\r\nsentiment, on the subject of slavery. From the mouth to the head of the\r\nChesapeake, the bulk of the people will approve it in theory, and\r\nit will find a respectable minority ready to adopt it in practice;\r\na minority, which, for weight and worth of character, preponderates\r\nagainst the greater number, who have not the courage to divest their\r\nfamilies of a property, which, however, keeps their consciences unquiet.\r\nNorthward of the Chesapeake, you may find here and there an opponent to\r\nyour doctrine, as you may find here and there a robber and murderer;\r\nbut in no greater number. In that part of America, there being but few\r\nslaves, they can easily disencumber themselves of them; and emancipation\r\nis put into such a train, that in a few years there will be no slaves\r\nnorthward of Maryland. In Maryland, I do not find such a disposition\r\nto begin the redress of this enormity, as in Virginia. This is the next\r\nState to which we may turn our eyes for the interesting spectacle of\r\njustice, in conflict with avarice and oppression: a conflict wherein the\r\nsacred side is gaining daily recruits, from the influx into office of\r\nyoung men grown and growing up. These have sucked in the principles of\r\nliberty, as it were, with their mothers’ milk; and it is to them I\r\nlook with anxiety to turn the fate of this question. Be not therefore\r\ndiscouraged. What you have written will do a great deal of good: and\r\ncould you still trouble yourself with our welfare, no man is more able\r\nto give aid to the laboring side. The College of William and Mary in\r\nWilliamsburg, since the re-modelling of its plan, is the place where are\r\ncollected together all the young men of Virginia, under preparation for\r\npublic life. They are there under the direction (most of them) of a Mr.\r\nWythe, one of the most virtuous of characters, and whose sentiments on\r\nthe subject of slavery are unequivocal. I am satisfied, if you could\r\nresolve to address an exhortation to those young men, with all that\r\neloquence of which you are master, that its influence on the future\r\ndecision of this important question would be great, perhaps decisive.\r\nThus you see, that, so far from thinking you have cause to repent of\r\nwhat you have done, I wish you to do more, and wish it on an assurance\r\nof its effect. The information I have received from America, of the\r\nreception of your pamphlet in the different States, agrees with the\r\nexpectations I had formed.\r\n\r\nOur country is getting into a ferment against yours, or rather has\r\ncaught it from yours. God knows how this will end; but assuredly in\r\none extreme or the other. There can be no medium between those who have\r\nloved so much. I think the decision is in your power as yet, but will\r\nnot be so long.\r\n\r\nI pray you to be assured of the sincerity of the esteem and respect,\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient,\r\n\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, August 10,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, August 10,1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 4th instant came to hand yesterday. I now enclose you\r\nthe two _Arrêts_ against the importation of foreign manufactures into\r\nthis kingdom. The cause of the balance against this country in favor of\r\nEngland, as well as its amount, is not agreed on. No doubt, the rage\r\nfor English manufactures must be a principal cause. The speculators in\r\nexchange say, also, that those of the circumjacent countries, who have\r\na balance in their favor against France, remit that balance to England\r\nfrom France. If so, it is possible that the English may count this\r\nbalance twice: that is, in summing their exports to one of these States,\r\nand their imports from it, they count the difference once in their\r\nfavor; then a second time, when they sum the remittances of cash they\r\nreceive from France. There has been no _Arrêt_ relative to our commerce,\r\nsince that of August, 1784. And all the late advices from the French\r\nWest Indies are, that they have now in their ports always three times\r\nas many vessels as there ever were before, and that the increase\r\nis principally from our States. I have now no further fears of that\r\n_Arrêts_ standing its ground. When it shall become firm, I do not think\r\nits extension desperate. But whether the placing it on the firm basis\r\nof treaty be practicable, is a very different question. As far as it is\r\npossible to judge from appearances, I conjecture that Crawford will do\r\nnothing. I infer this from some things in his conversation, and from\r\nan expression of the Count de Vergennes, in a conversation with me\r\nyesterday. I pressed upon him the importance of opening their\r\nports freely to us, in the moment of the oppressions of the English\r\nregulations against us, and perhaps of the suspension of their commerce.\r\nHe admitted it; but said we had free ingress with our productions. I\r\nenumerated them to him, and showed him on what footing they were, and\r\nhow they might be improved. We are to have further conversations on the\r\nsubject. I am afraid the voyage to Fontainebleau will interrupt them.\r\nFrom the inquiries I have made, I find I cannot get a very small and\r\nindifferent house there, for the season, (that is, for a month) for less\r\nthan one hundred or one hundred and fifty guineas. This is nearly the\r\nwhole salary for the time, and would leave nothing to eat. I therefore\r\ncannot accompany the court thither, but I will endeavor to go there\r\noccasionally from Paris.\r\n\r\nThey tell me it is the most favorable scene for business with the Count\r\nde Vergennes, because he is then more abstracted from the domestic\r\napplications. Count d’Aranda is not yet returned from the waters of\r\nVichy. As soon as he returns, I will apply to him in the case of Mr.\r\nWatson. I will pray you to insure Houdon’s life from the 27th of last\r\nmonth till his return to Paris. As he was to stay in America a month\r\nor two, he will probably be about six months absent; but the three per\r\ncent, for the voyage being once paid, I suppose they will insure his\r\nlife by the month, whether his absence be longer or shorter. The sum to\r\nbe insured is fifteen thousand livres tournois. If it be not necessary\r\nto pay the money immediately, there is a prospect of exchange becoming\r\nmore favorable. But whenever it is necessary, be so good as to procure\r\nit by selling a draft on Mr. Grand, which I will take care shall be\r\nhonored. With compliments to the ladies,\r\n\r\nI am, dear Sir, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVIII.--TO MRS. SPROWLE, August 10, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. SPROWLE.\r\n\r\nParis, August 10, 1785.\r\n\r\nMadam,\r\n\r\nIn your letter of June the 21st, you asked my opinion whether yourself\r\nor your son might venture to go to Virginia, to claim your possessions\r\nthere? I had the honor of writing you, on the 5th of July, that you\r\nmight safely go there; that your person would be sacredly safe, and free\r\nfrom insult. I expressed my hopes, too, that the Assembly of Virginia\r\nwould, in the end, adopt the just and useful measure of restoring\r\nproperty unsold, and the price of that actually sold. In yours of July\r\nthe 30th, you entreat my influence with the Assembly for retribution,\r\nand that, if I think your personal presence in Virginia would facilitate\r\nthat end, you were willing and ready to go. This seems to propose to me\r\nto take on myself the solicitation of your cause, and that you will go,\r\nif I think your personal presence will be auxiliary to my applications.\r\nI feel myself obliged to inform you frankly, that it is improper for me\r\nto solicit your case with the Assembly of Virginia. The application can\r\nonly go with propriety from yourself, or the minister of your court\r\nto America, whenever there shall be one. If you think the sentiments\r\nexpressed in my former letter will serve you, you are free to exhibit it\r\nto members individually; but I wish the letter not to be offered to the\r\nAssembly as a body, or referred to in any petition or memorial to them.\r\n\r\nI am, with much respect, Madam,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIX.--TO CAPTAIN JOHN PAUL JONES, August 13, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN JOHN PAUL JONES.\r\n\r\nParis, August 13, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nSupposing you may be anxious to hear from hence, though there should\r\nbe nothing interesting to communicate, I write by Mr. Cairnes merely to\r\ninform you, that I have, as yet, received no answer from the Marechal\r\nde Castries. I am in daily expectation of one. Should it not be received\r\nsoon, I shall urge it again, which I wish to avoid however, if possible;\r\nbecause I think it better to await with patience a favorable decision,\r\nthan by becoming importunate, to produce unfavorable dispositions,\r\nand, perhaps, a final determination of the same complexion. Should my\r\noccupations prevent my writing awhile, be assured that it will only be\r\nas long as I have nothing to communicate, and that as soon as I receive\r\nany answer, it shall be forwarded to you.\r\n\r\nI am, with much esteem, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XC.--TO MESSRS. BUCHANAN AND HAY, August 13, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. BUCHANAN AND HAY.\r\n\r\nParis, August 13, 1785.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nYour favor of March the 20th came to hand the 14th of June, and the next\r\nday I wrote to you, acknowledging the receipt, and apprizing you, that\r\nbetween that date and the 1st of August, it would be impossible to\r\nprocure, and get to your hands, the drafts you desired. I did hope,\r\nindeed, to have had them prepared before this, but it will yet be some\r\ntime before they will be in readiness. I flatter myself, however, they\r\nwill give you satisfaction when you receive them, and that you will\r\nthink the object will not have lost by the delay. It was a considerable\r\ntime before I could find an architect whose taste had been formed on\r\na study of the ancient models of his art: the style of architecture in\r\nthis capital being far from chaste. I at length heard of one, to whom\r\nI immediately addressed myself, and who perfectly fulfils my wishes. He\r\nhas studied twenty years in Rome, and has given proofs of his skill\r\nand taste, by a publication of some antiquities of this country. You\r\nintimate that you should be willing to have a workman sent to you to\r\nsuperintend the execution of this work. Were I to send one on this\r\nerrand from hence, he would consider himself as the superintendant of\r\nthe Directors themselves, and probably, of the government of the State\r\nalso. I will give you my ideas on this subject. The columns of the\r\nbuilding, and the external architraves of the doors and windows, should\r\nbe of stone. Whether these are made here or there, you will need one\r\ngood stone-cutter; and one will be enough; because, under his direction,\r\nnegroes, who never saw a tool, will be able to prepare the work for him\r\nto finish. I will therefore send you such a one, in time to begin\r\nwork in the spring. All the internal cornices, and other ornaments\r\nnot exposed to the weather, will be much handsomer, cheaper, and more\r\ndurable in plaister, than in wood. I will therefore employ a good\r\nworkman in this way, and send him to you. But he will have no employment\r\ntill the house is covered; of course he need not be sent till next\r\nsummer. I will take him on wages so long before hand, as that he may\r\ndraw all the ornaments in detail, under the eye of the architect, which\r\nhe will have to execute when he comes to you. It will be the cheapest\r\nway of getting them drawn, and the most certain of putting him in\r\npossession of his precise duty. Plaister will not answer for your\r\nexternal cornice, and stone will be too dear. You will probably find\r\nyourselves obliged to be contented with wood. For this, therefore, and\r\nfor your window sashes, doors, frames, wainscoting, &c. you will need\r\na capital house-joiner; and a capital one he ought to be, capable of\r\ndirecting all the circumstances in the construction of the walls, which\r\nthe execution of the plan will require. Such a workman cannot be got\r\nhere. Nothing can be worse done than the house-joinery of Paris. Besides\r\nthat his speaking the language perfectly would be essential, I think\r\nthis character must be got from England. There are no workmen in wood,\r\nin Europe, comparable to those of England. I submit to you, therefore,\r\nthe following proposition: to wit, I will get a correspondent in England\r\nto engage a workman of this kind. I will direct him to come here, which\r\nwill cost five guineas. We will make proof of his execution. He shall\r\nalso make, under the eye of the architect, all the drawings for the\r\nbuilding, which he is to execute himself: and if we find him sober and\r\ncapable, he shall be forwarded to you. I expect that in the article of\r\nthe drawings, and the cheapness of passage from France, you will save\r\nthe expense of his coming here. But as to this workman, I shall do\r\nnothing unless I receive your commands. With respect to your stone work,\r\nit may be got much cheaper here than in England. The stone of Paris is\r\nvery white and beautiful; but it always remains soft, and suffers from\r\nthe weather. The cliffs of the Seine, from hence to Havre, are all\r\nof stone. I am not yet informed whether it is all liable to the same\r\nobjections. At Lyons, and all along the Rhone, is a stone as beautiful\r\nas that of Paris, soft when it comes out of the quarry, but very soon\r\nbecoming hard in the open air, and very durable. I doubt, however,\r\nwhether the commerce between Virginia and Marseilles would afford\r\nopportunities of conveyance sufficient. It remains to be inquired, what\r\naddition to the original cost would be made by the short land carriage\r\nfrom Lyons to the Loire, and the water transportation down that to\r\nBordeaux;, and also, whether a stone of the same quality may not be\r\nfound on the Loire. In this, and all other matters relative to your\r\ncharge, you may command my services freely.\r\n\r\nHaving heard high commendations of a plan of a prison, drawn by an\r\narchitect at Lyons, I sent there for it. The architect furnished me with\r\nit. It is certainly the best plan I ever saw. It unites, in the most\r\nperfect manner, the objects of security and health, and has, moreover,\r\nthe advantage, valuable to us, of being capable of being adjusted to\r\nany number of prisoners, small or great, and admitting an execution from\r\ntime to time, as it may be convenient. The plan is under preparation as\r\nfor forty prisoners. Will you have any occasion for slate? It may be got\r\nvery good and ready prepared at Havre; and a workman or more might be\r\nsent on easy terms. Perhaps the quarry at Tuckahoe would leave you no\r\nother want than that of a workman.\r\n\r\nI shall be glad to receive your sentiments on the several matters herein\r\nmentioned, that I may know how far you approve of them, as I shall with\r\npleasure pursue strictly whatever you desire. I have the honor to be,\r\nwith great respect and esteem, Gentlemen,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCI.--TO JOHN JAY, August 14, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, August 14, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI was honored, on the 22nd ultimo, with the receipt of your letter\r\nof June the 15th; and delivered the letter therein enclosed, from the\r\nPresident of Congress to the King. I took an opportunity of asking the\r\nCount de Vergennes, whether the Chevalier Luzerne proposed to return to\r\nAmerica. He answered me that he did; and that he was here, for a\r\ntime only, to arrange his private affairs. Of course, this stopped my\r\nproceeding further in compliance with the hint in your letter. I knew\r\nthat the Chevalier Luzerne still retained the character of minister\r\nto Congress, which occasioned my premising the question I did. But,\r\nnotwithstanding the answer, which indeed was the only one the Count de\r\nVergennes could give me, I believe it is not expected that the Chevalier\r\nwill return to America: that he is waiting an appointment here, to some\r\nof their embassies, or some other promotion, and in the mean time, as a\r\nfavor, is permitted to retain his former character. Knowing the esteem\r\nborne him in America, I did not suppose it would be wished, that I\r\nshould add any thing which might occasion an injury to him; and the\r\nrather, as I presumed that, at this time, there did not exist the same\r\nreason for wishing the arrival of a minister in America, which perhaps\r\nexisted there at the date of your letter. Count Adhemar is just arrived\r\nfrom London, on account of a paralytic disease with which he has been\r\nstruck. It does not seem improbable, that his place will be supplied,\r\nand perhaps by the Chevalier de la Luzerne.\r\n\r\nA French vessel has lately refused the salute to a British armed vessel\r\nin the channel. The _Chargé des Affaires_ of Great Britain at this court\r\n(their ambassador having gone to London a few days ago) made this the\r\nsubject of a conference with the Count de Vergennes, on Tuesday last.\r\nHe told me that the Count explained the transaction as the act of\r\nthe individual master of the French vessel, not founded in any public\r\norders. His earnestness, and his endeavors to find terms sufficiently\r\nsoft to express the Count’s explanation, had no tendency to lessen any\r\ndoubts I might have entertained on this subject. I think it possible the\r\nrefusal may have been by order: nor can I believe that Great Britain is\r\nin a condition to resent it, if it was so. In this case, we shall see it\r\nrepeated by France and her example will then be soon followed by other\r\nnations. The news-writers bring together this circumstance with\r\nthe departure of the French ambassador from London, and the English\r\nambassador from Paris, the manoeuvring of the French fleet just off the\r\nchannel, the collecting some English vessels of war in the channel, the\r\nfailure of a commercial treaty between the two countries, and a severe\r\n_Arrêt_ here against English manufacturers, as foreboding war. It is\r\npossible that the fleet of manoeuvre, the refusal of the salute, and the\r\nEnglish fleet of observation, may have a connexion with one another. But\r\nI am persuaded the other facts are totally independent of these, and\r\nof one another, and are accidentally brought together in point of time.\r\nNeither nation is in a condition to go to war: Great Britain, indeed,\r\nthe least so of the two. The latter power, or rather its monarch, as\r\nElector of Hanover, has lately confederated with the King of Prussia and\r\nothers of the Germanic body, evidently in opposition to the Emperor’s\r\ndesigns on Bavaria. An alliance, too, between the Empress of Russia\r\nand the Republic of Venice, seems to have had him in view, as he had\r\nmeditated some exchange of territory with that republic. This desertion\r\nof the powers heretofore thought friendly to him, seems to leave no\r\nissue for his ambition, but on the side of Turkey. His demarkation\r\nwith that country is still unsettled. His difference with the Dutch\r\nis certainly agreed. The articles are not yet made public; perhaps not\r\nquite adjusted. Upon the whole, we may count on another year’s peace in\r\nEurope, and that our friends will not, within that time, be brought into\r\nany embarrassments, which might encourage Great Britain to be difficult\r\nin settling the points still unsettled between us.\r\n\r\nYou have, doubtless, seen in the papers, that this court was sending\r\ntwo vessels into the south sea, under the conduct of a Captain Peyrouse.\r\nThey give out, that the object is merely for the improvement of our\r\nknowledge of the geography of that part of the globe. And certain it is,\r\nthat they carry men of eminence in different branches of science.\r\nTheir loading, however, as detailed in conversations, and some other\r\ncircumstances, appeared to me to indicate some other design: perhaps\r\nthat of colonizing on the western coast of America; or, it may be, only\r\nto establish one or more factories there, for the fur-trade. Perhaps\r\nwe may be little interested in either of these objects. But we are\r\ninterested in another, that is, to know whether they are perfectly\r\nweaned from the desire of possessing continental colonies in America.\r\nEvents might arise, which would render it very desirable for Congress\r\nto be satisfied they have no such wish. If they would desire a colony on\r\nthe western side of America, I should not be quite satisfied that they\r\nwould refuse one which should offer itself on the eastern side. Captain\r\nPaul Jones being at L’Orient, within a day’s journey of Brest, where\r\nCaptain Peyrouse’s vessels lay, I desired him, if he could not satisfy\r\nhimself at L’Orient of the nature of this equipment, to go to Brest for\r\nthat purpose: conducting himself so as to excite no suspicion that we\r\nattended at all to this expedition. His discretion can be relied on,\r\nand his expenses for so short a journey will be a trifling price for\r\nsatisfaction on this point. I hope, therefore, that my undertaking\r\nthat the expenses of his journey shall be reimbursed him, will not be\r\ndisapproved.\r\n\r\nA gentleman lately arrived from New York tells me, he thinks it will be\r\nsatisfactory to Congress, to be informed of the effect produced here by\r\nthe insult of Longchamps on Monsieur de Marbois. Soon after my arrival\r\nin France last summer, it was the matter of a conversation between the\r\nCount de Vergennes and myself. I explained to him the effect of the\r\njudgment against Longchamps. He did not say that it was satisfactory,\r\nbut neither did he say a word from which I could collect that it was not\r\nso. The conversation was not official, because foreign to the character\r\nin which I then was. He has never mentioned a word on the subject to me\r\nsince, and it was not for me to introduce it at any time. I have never\r\nonce heard it mentioned in conversation, by any person of this country,\r\nand have no reason to suppose that there remains any uneasiness on the\r\nsubject. I have indeed been told, that they had sent orders to make\r\na formal demand of Longchamps from Congress, and had immediately\r\ncountermanded these orders. You know whether this be true. If it be, I\r\nshould suspect the first orders to have been surprised from them by some\r\nexaggeration, and that the latter was a correction of their error,\r\nin the moment of further reflection. Upon the whole, there certainly\r\nappears to me no reason to urge the State, in which the fact happened,\r\nto any violation of their laws, nor to set a precedent which might\r\nhereafter be used in cases more interesting to us than the late one.\r\n\r\nIn a late conversation with the Count de Vergennes, he asked me if the\r\ncondition of our finances was improving. He did not make an application\r\nof the question to the arrearages of their interest, though perhaps\r\nhe meant that I should apply it. I told him the impost still found\r\nobstacles, and explained to him the effects which I hoped from our land\r\noffice. Your letter of the 15th of April did not come to hand till\r\nthe 27th ultimo. I enclose a letter from Mr. Dumas to the President of\r\nCongress, and accompany the present with the Leyden Gazette and Gazette\r\nof France, from the date last sent you to the present time. I have the\r\nhonor to be, with high esteem, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCII.--TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES, August 15, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.\r\n\r\nParis, August 15, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn the conversation which I had the honor of having with your\r\nExcellency, a few days ago, on the importance of placing, at this time,\r\nthe commerce between France and America on the best footing possible,\r\namong other objects of this commerce, that of tobacco was mentioned, as\r\nsusceptible of greater encouragement and advantage to the two nations.\r\nAlways distrusting what I say in a language I speak so imperfectly, I\r\nwill beg your permission to state, in English, the substance of what I\r\nhad then the honor to observe, adding some more particular details for\r\nyour consideration.\r\n\r\nI find the consumption of tobacco in France estimated at from fifteen to\r\nthirty millions of pounds. The most probable estimate, however, places\r\nit at twenty-four millions.\r\n\r\nThis costing eight sous the pound, delivered in\r\n\r\na port of France, amounts to...............9,600,000 livres.\r\n\r\nAllow six sous a pound, as the average cost of the\r\n\r\ndifferent manufactures.....................7,200,000\r\n\r\nThe revenue which the King derives from this, is\r\n\r\nsomething less than.......................30,000,000\r\n\r\nWhich would make the cost of the whole... 46,800,000\r\n\r\nBut it is sold to the consumers at an average of\r\n\r\nthree livres the pound....................72,000,000\r\n\r\nThere remain then for the expenses\r\n\r\nof collection............................ 25,200,000 livres.\r\n\r\nThis is within a sixth as much as the King receives, and so gives nearly\r\none half for collecting the other. It would be presumption in me, a\r\nstranger, to suppose my numbers perfectly accurate. I have taken them\r\nfrom the best and most disinterested authorities I could find. Your\r\nExcellency will know how far they are wrong; and should you find them\r\nconsiderably wrong, yet I am persuaded you will find, after strictly\r\ncorrecting them, that the collection of this branch of the revenue still\r\nabsorbs too much.\r\n\r\nMy apology for making these remarks will, I hope, be found in my wishes\r\nto improve the commerce between the two nations, and the interest which\r\nmy own country will derive from this improvement. The monopoly of the\r\npurchase of tobacco in France, discourages both the French and American\r\nmerchant from bringing it here, and from taking in exchange the\r\nmanufactures and productions of France. It is contrary to the spirit of\r\ntrade, and to the dispositions of merchants, to carry a commodity to any\r\nmarket where but one person is allowed to buy it, and where, of course,\r\nthat person fixes its price, which the seller must receive, or reexport\r\nhis commodity, at the loss of his voyage thither. Experience accordingly\r\nshows, that they carry it to other markets, and that they take in\r\nexchange the merchandise of the place where they deliver it. I am\r\nmisinformed, if France has not been furnished from a neighboring nation\r\nwith considerable quantities of tobacco, since the peace, and been\r\nobliged to pay there in coin, what might have been paid here in\r\nmanufactures, had the French and American merchants bought the tobacco\r\noriginally here. I suppose, too, that the purchases made by the Farmers\r\nGeneral, in America, are paid for chiefly in coin, which coin is also\r\nremitted directly hence to England, and makes an important part of the\r\nbalance supposed to be in favor of that nation against this. Should\r\nthe Farmers General, by themselves, or by the company to whom they\r\nmay commit the procuring these tobaccos from America, require, for the\r\nsatisfaction of government on this head, the exportation of a proportion\r\nof merchandise in exchange for them, it would be an unpromising\r\nexpedient. It would only commit the exports, as well as imports, between\r\nFrance and America, to a monopoly, which, being secure against rivals\r\nin the sale of the merchandise of France, would not be likely to sell\r\nat such moderate prices as might encourage its consumption there,\r\nand enable it to bear a competition with similar articles from other\r\ncountries. I am persuaded this exportation of coin may be prevented, and\r\nthat of commodities effected, by leaving both operations to the French\r\nand American merchants, instead of the Farmers General. They will import\r\na sufficient quantity of tobacco, if they are allowed a perfect freedom\r\nin the sale; and they will receive in payment, wines, oils, brandies,\r\nand manufactures, instead of coin; forcing each other, by their\r\ncompetition, to bring tobaccos of the best quality; to give to the\r\nFrench manufacturer the full worth of his merchandise; and to sell\r\nto the American consumer at the lowest price they can afford; thus\r\nencouraging him to use, in preference, the merchandise of this country.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that this exchange should be favored by any loss of\r\nrevenue to the King. I do not mean to urge any thing which shall injure\r\neither his Majesty or his people. On the contrary, the measure I have\r\nthe honor of proposing, will increase his revenue, while it places both\r\nthe seller and buyer on a better footing. It is not for me to say, what\r\nsystem of collection may be best adapted to the organization of this\r\ngovernment; nor whether any useful hints may be taken from the practice\r\nof that country, which has heretofore been the principal entrepot\r\nfor this commodity. Their system is simple and little expensive. The\r\nimporter there, pays the whole duty to the King: and as this would\r\nbe inconvenient for him to do before he has sold his tobacco, he is\r\npermitted, on arrival, to deposite it in the King’s warehouse, under the\r\nlocks of the King’s officer. As soon as he has sold it, he goes with the\r\npurchaser to the warehouse; the money is there divided between the\r\nKing and him, to each his proportion, and the purchaser takes out the\r\ntobacco. The payment of the King’s duty is thus ensured in ready money.\r\nWhat is the expense of its collection, I cannot say; but it certainly\r\nneed not exceed six livres a hogshead of one thousand pounds. That\r\ngovernment levies a higher duty on tobacco than is levied here. Yet\r\nso tempting and so valuable is the perfect liberty of sale, that the\r\nmerchant carries it there and finds his account in doing so.\r\n\r\nIf, by a simplification of the collection of the King’s duty on tobacco,\r\nthe cost of that collection can be reduced even to five per cent., or\r\na million and a half, instead of twenty-five millions; the price to the\r\nconsumer will be reduced from three to two livres the pound. For thus I\r\ncalculate.\r\n\r\nThe cost, manufacture, and revenue, on twenty-four million pounds\r\n\r\nof tobacco being (as before stated)................46,800,000 livres.\r\n\r\nFive per cent, on thirty millions of livres,\r\n\r\nexpenses of collection .............................1,500,000\r\n\r\nGive what the consumers would pay, being\r\n\r\nabout two livres a pound...........................48,300,000\r\n\r\nBut they pay at present three livres a pound...... 72,000,000\r\n\r\nThe difference is..................................23,700,000\r\n\r\nThe price being thus reduced one third, would be brought within the\r\nreach of a new and numerous circle of the people, who cannot, at\r\npresent, afford themselves this luxury. The consumption, then, would\r\nprobably increase, and perhaps in the same if not a greater proportion,\r\nwith the reduction of the price; that is to say, from twenty-four to\r\nthirty-sis millions of pounds: and the King, continuing to receive\r\ntwenty-five sous on the pound, as at present, would receive forty-fire\r\ninstead of thirty millions of livres, while his subjects would pay but\r\ntwo livres for an object which has heretofore cost them three. Or if,\r\nin event, the consumption were not to be increased, he would levy only\r\nforty-eight millions on his people, where seventy-two millions are now\r\nlevied, and would leave twenty-four millions in their pockets, either\r\nto remain there, or to be levied in some other form, should the state\r\nof revenue require it. It will enable his subjects, also, to dispose of\r\nbetween nine and ten millions’ worth of their produce and manufactures,\r\ninstead of sending nearly that sum annually, in coin, to enrich a\r\nneighboring nation.\r\n\r\nI have heard two objections made to the suppression of this monopoly. 1.\r\nThat it might increase the importation of tobacco in contraband. 2. That\r\nit would lessen the abilities of the Farmers General to make occasional\r\nloans of money to the public treasury. These objections will surely be\r\nbetter answered by those who are better acquainted than I am with the\r\ndetails and circumstances of the country. With respect to the first,\r\nhowever, I may observe, that contraband does not increase on lessening\r\nthe temptations to it. It is now encouraged, by those who engage in it\r\nbeing able to sell for sixty sous what cost but fourteen, leaving a gain\r\nof forty-six sous. When the price shall be reduced from sixty to forty\r\nsous, the gain will be but twenty-six, that is to say, a little more\r\nthan one half of what it is at present. It does not seem a natural\r\nconsequence, then, that contraband should be increased by reducing its\r\ngain nearly one half. As to the second objection, if we suppose (for\r\nelucidation and without presuming to fix) the proportion of the farm on\r\ntobacco, at one eighth of the whole mass farmed, the abilities of the\r\nFarmers General to lend will be reduced one eighth, that is, they can\r\nhereafter lend only seven millions, where heretofore they have lent\r\neight. It is to be considered, then, whether this eighth (or other\r\nproportion, whatever it be) is worth the annual sacrifice of twenty-four\r\nmillions, or if a much smaller sacrifice to other monied men, will not\r\nproduce the same loans of money in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nWhile the advantages of an increase of revenue to the crown, a\r\ndiminution of impost on the people, and a payment in merchandise\r\ninstead of money, are conjectured as likely to result to France from a\r\nsuppression of the monopoly on tobacco, we have also reason to hope some\r\nadvantages on our part; and this hope alone could justify my entering\r\ninto the present details. I do not expect this advantage will be by\r\nan augmentation of price. The other markets of Europe have too much\r\ninfluence on this article, to admit any sensible augmentation of price\r\nto take place. But the advantage I principally expect, is an increase\r\nof consumption. This will give us a vent for so much more, and, of\r\nconsequence, find employment for so many more cultivators of the earth:\r\nand in whatever proportion it increases this production for us, in the\r\nsame proportion will it procure additional vent for the merchandise of\r\nFrance, and employment for the hands which produce it. I expect too,\r\nthat by bringing our merchants here, they would procure a number of\r\ncommodities in exchange, better in kind, and cheaper in price. It is\r\nwith sincerity I add, that warm feelings are indulged in my breast by\r\nthe further hope, that it would bind the two nations still closer in\r\nfriendship, by binding them in interest. In truth, no two countries\r\nare better calculated for the exchanges of commerce. France wants rice,\r\ntobacco, potash, furs, and ship timber. We want wines, brandies, oils,\r\nand manufactures. There is an affection, too, between the two people,\r\nwhich disposes them to favor one another. They do not come together,\r\nthen, to make the exchange in their own ports, it shows there is some\r\nsubstantial obstruction in the way. We have had the benefit of too many\r\nproofs of his Majesty’s friendly disposition towards the United States,\r\nand know too well his affectionate care of his own subjects, to\r\ndoubt his willingness to remove these obstructions, if they can be\r\nunequivocally pointed out. It is for his wisdom to decide, whether the\r\nmonopoly, which is the subject of this letter, be deservedly classed\r\nwith the principal of these. It is a great comfort to me too, that in\r\npresenting this to the mind of his Majesty, your Excellency will correct\r\nmy ideas where an insufficient knowledge of facts may have led me into\r\nerror; and that while the interests of the King and of his people are\r\nthe first object of your attention, an additional one will be presented\r\nby those dispositions towards us, which have heretofore so often\r\nbefriended our nation.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this occasion to repeat the assurance of that high\r\nrespect and esteem, with which I have the honor to be\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIII.--TO CAPTAIN JOHN PAUL JONES, August 17, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN JOHN PAUL JONES.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, August 17, 1785.\r\n\r\nMine of the 13th informed you that I had written to the M. de Castries\r\non the subject of Puchilberg’s interference. Yesterday I received his\r\nanswer dated the 12th. In that, he says that he is informed by the\r\n_Ordonnateur_, that he has not been able to get an authentic roll of\r\nthe crew of the Alliance, and that, in the probable case of there having\r\nbeen some French subjects among them, it will be just that you should\r\ngive security to repay their portions. I wrote to him this morning, that\r\nas you have obliged yourself to transmit the money to the treasury of\r\nthe United States, it does not seem just to require you to be answerable\r\nfor money which will be no longer within your power; that the repayment\r\nof such portions will be incumbent on Congress; that I will immediately\r\nsolicit their orders to have all such claims paid by their banker here:\r\nand that should any be presented before I receive their orders, I will\r\nundertake to direct the banker of the United States to pay them, that\r\nthere may be no delay. I trust that this will remove the difficulty, and\r\nthat it is the last which will be offered. The ultimate answer shall\r\nbe communicated the moment I receive it. Having pledged myself for the\r\nclaims which may be offered, before I receive the orders of Congress,\r\nit is necessary to arm myself with the proper checks. Can you give me\r\na roll of the crew, pointing out the French subjects? If not, can you\r\nrecollect personally the French subjects, and name them to me, and the\r\nsums they are entitled to? it there were none such, yet the roll will\r\nbe material, because I have no doubt that Puchilberg will excite claims\r\nupon me, either true or false,\r\n\r\nI am, with much respect, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIV.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, August 18, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nPads, August 18, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of June the 22nd, with a postscript of July the 14th.\r\nYours of June the 27th came to hand the 23rd of July, and that of July\r\nthe 28th came to hand the 10th instant. The papers enclosed in the last\r\nshall be communicated to Mr. Adams. I see with extreme satisfaction and\r\ngratitude, the friendly interposition of the court of Spain with the\r\nEmperor of Morocco, on the subject of the brig Betsy, and I am persuaded\r\nit will produce the happiest effects in America. Those who are entrusted\r\nwith the public affairs there, are sufficiently sensible how essentially\r\nit is for our interest to cultivate peace with Spain, and they will be\r\npleased to see a corresponding disposition in that court. The late\r\ngood office of emancipating a number of our countrymen from slavery is\r\npeculiarly calculated to produce a sensation among our people, and to\r\ndispose them to relish and adopt the pacific and friendly views of\r\ntheir leaders towards Spain. We hear nothing yet of Mr. Lambe. I have\r\ntherefore lately proposed to Mr. Adams, that if he does not come in the\r\nFrench or English packet of this month, we will wait no longer. If he\r\naccedes to the proposition, you will be sure of hearing of, and perhaps\r\nof seeing, some agent proceeding on that business. The immense sum\r\nsaid to have been proposed, on the part of Spain, to Algiers, leaves us\r\nlittle hope of satisfying their avarice. It may happen then, that the\r\ninterests of Spain and America may call for a concert of proceedings\r\nagainst that State. The dispositions of the Emperor of Morocco give us\r\nbetter hopes there. May not the affairs of the Musquito coast, and our\r\nwestern ports, produce another instance of a common interest? Indeed,\r\nI meet this correspondence of interest in so many quarters, that I look\r\nwith anxiety to the issue of Mr. Gardoqui’s mission; hoping it will be\r\na removal of the only difficulty at present subsisting between the two\r\nnations, or which is likely to arise.\r\n\r\nCongress are not likely to adjourn this summer. They have purchased the\r\nIndian right of soil to about fifty millions of acres of land, between\r\nthe Ohio and lakes, and expected to make another purchase of an equal\r\nquantity. They have, in consequence, passed an ordinance for disposing\r\nof their lands, and I think a very judicious one. They propose to sell\r\nthem at auction for not less than a dollar an acre, receiving their own\r\ncertificates of debt as money. I am of opinion all the certificates of\r\nour domestic debt will immediately be exchanged for land, Our foreign\r\ndebt, in that case, will soon be discharged. New York and Rhode Island\r\nstill refuse the impost. A general disposition is taking place to commit\r\nthe whole management of our commerce to Congress. This has been much\r\npromoted by the interested policy of England, which, it was apparent,\r\ncould not be counter-worked by the States separately. In the mean time,\r\nthe other great towns are acceding to the proceedings of Boston for\r\nannihilating, in a great measure, their commercial connections with\r\nGreat Britain. I will send the cipher by a gentleman who goes from here\r\nto Madrid about a month hence. It shall be a copy of the one I gave Mr.\r\nAdams. The letter of Don Gomez has been delivered at the hotel of the\r\nPortuguese ambassador, who is, however, in the country. I am with much\r\nrespect, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCV.--TO PETER CARR--Advice to a young man, Aug. 19, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PETER CARR.\r\n\r\nParis, August 19, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Peter,\r\n\r\nI received, by Mr. Mazzei, your letter of April the 20th. I am much\r\nmortified to hear that you have lost so much time; and that when you\r\narrived in Williamsburg, you were not at all advanced from what you were\r\nwhen you left Monticello. Time now begins to be precious to you. Every\r\nday you lose, will retard a day your entrance on that public stage\r\nwhereon you may begin to be useful to yourself. However, the way to\r\nrepair the loss is to improve the future time. I trust, that with your\r\ndispositions, even the acquisition of science is a pleasing employment.\r\nI can assure you, that the possession of it is, what (next to an honest\r\nheart) will above all things render you dear to your friends, and give\r\nyou fame and promotion in your own country. When your mind shall be well\r\nimproved with science, nothing will be necessary to place you in the\r\nhighest points of view, but to pursue the interests of your country, the\r\ninterests of your friends and your own interests also, with the purest\r\nintegrity, the most chaste honor. The defect of these virtues can never\r\nbe made up by all the other acquirements of body and mind. Make these\r\nthen your first object. Give up money, give up fame, give up science,\r\ngive the earth itself and all it contains, rather than do an immoral\r\nact. And never suppose, that in any possible situation, or under any\r\ncircumstances, it is best for you to do a dishonorable thing, however\r\nslightly so it may appear to you. Whenever you are to do a thing, though\r\nit can never be known but to yourself, ask yourself how you would act\r\nwere all the world looking at you, and act accordingly. Encourage all\r\nyour virtuous dispositions, and exercise them whenever an opportunity\r\narises; being assured that they will gain strength by exercise, as a\r\nlimb of the body does, and that exercise will make them habitual. From\r\nthe practice of the purest virtue, you may be assured you will derive\r\nthe most sublime comforts in every moment of life, and in the moment\r\nof death. If ever you find yourself environed with difficulties\r\nand perplexing circumstances, out of which you are at a loss how to\r\nextricate yourself, do what is right, and be assured that that will\r\nextricate you the best out of the worst situations. Though you cannot\r\nsee, when you take one step, what will be the next, yet follow truth,\r\njustice, and plain dealing, and never fear their leading you out of the\r\nlabyrinth, in the easiest manner possible. The knot which you thought a\r\nGordian one, will untie itself before you. Nothing is so mistaken as the\r\nsupposition, that a person is to extricate himself from a difficulty by\r\nintrigue, by chicanery, by dissimulation, by trimming, by an untruth,\r\nby an injustice. This increases the difficulties ten fold; and those who\r\npursue these methods, get themselves so involved at length, that they\r\ncan turn no way but their infamy becomes more exposed. It is of great\r\nimportance to set a resolution, not to be shaken, never to tell an\r\nuntruth. There is no vice so mean, so pitiful, so contemptible; and he\r\nwho permits himself to tell a lie once, finds it much easier to do it a\r\nsecond and third time, till a length it becomes habitual; he tells lies\r\nwithout attending to it, and truths without the world’s believing him.\r\nThis falsehood of the tongue leads to that of the heart, and in time\r\ndepraves all its good dispositions.\r\n\r\nAn honest heart being the first blessing, a knowing head is the second.\r\nIt is time for you now to begin to be choice in your reading; to begin\r\nto pursue a regular course in it; and not to suffer yourself to be\r\nturned to the right or left by reading any thing out of that course. 1\r\nhave long ago digested a plan for you, suited to the circumstances in\r\nwhich you will be placed. This I will detail to you, from time to time,\r\nas you advance. For the present, I advise you to begin a course\r\nof ancient history, reading every thing in the original and not in\r\ntranslations. First read Goldsmith’s History of Greece. This will give\r\nyou a digested view of that field. Then take up ancient history in the\r\ndetail, reading the following books in the following order: Herodotus,\r\nThucydides, Xenophontis Hellenica, Xenophontis Anabasis, Arrian, Quintus\r\nCurtius, Diodorus Siculus, Justin. This shall form the first stage of\r\nyour historical reading, and is all I need mention to you now. The\r\nnext, will be of Roman history.* From that we will come down to modern\r\nhistory. In Greek and Latin poetry, you have read or will read at\r\nschool, Virgil, Terence, Horace, Anacreon, Theocritus, Homer, Euripides,\r\nSophocles. Read also Milton’s Paradise Lost, Shakspeare, Ossian, Pope’s\r\nand Swift’s works, in order to form your style in your own language.\r\nIn morality, read Epictetus, Xenophontis Memorabilia, Plato’s Socratic\r\ndialogues, Cicero’s philosophies, Antoninus, and Seneca.\r\n\r\n     * Livy, Sullust, Cæsar, Cicero’s Epistles, Suetonius,\r\n     Tacitus, Gibbon.\r\n\r\nIn order to assure a certain progress in this reading, consider what\r\nhours you have free from the school and the exercises of the school.\r\nGive about two of them every day to exercise; for health must not be\r\nsacrificed to learning. A strong body makes the mind strong. As to\r\nthe species of exercise, I advise the gun. While this gives a moderate\r\nexercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise, and independence to\r\nthe mind. Games played with the ball, and others of that nature, are too\r\nviolent for the body, and stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun\r\ntherefore be the constant companion of your walks. Never think of taking\r\na book with you. The object of walking is to relax the mind. You should\r\ntherefore not permit yourself even to think while you walk; but divert\r\nyour attention by the objects surrounding you. Walking is the best\r\npossible exercise. Habituate yourself to walk very far. The Europeans\r\nvalue themselves on having subdued the horse to the uses of man; but I\r\ndoubt whether we have not lost more than we have gained, by the use of\r\nthis animal. No one has occasioned so much the degeneracy of the human\r\nbody. An Indian goes on foot nearly as far in a day, for a long journey,\r\nas an enfeebled white does on his horse; and he will tire the best\r\nhorses. There is no habit you will value so much as that of walking\r\nfar without fatigue. I would advise you to take your,exercise in the\r\nafternoon: not because it is the best time for exercise, for certainly\r\nit is not; but because it is the best time to spare from your studies;\r\nand habit will soon reconcile it to health, and render it nearly as\r\nuseful as if you gave to that the more precious hours of the day. A\r\nlittle walk of half an hour in the morning, when you first rise, is\r\nadvisable also. It shakes off sleep, and produces other good effects in\r\nthe animal economy. Rise at a fixed and an early hour, and go to bed at\r\na fixed and early hour also. Sitting up late at night is injurious to\r\nthe health, and not useful to the mind. Having ascribed proper hours to\r\nexercise, divide what remain (I mean of your vacant hours) into three\r\nportions. Give the principal to History, the other two, which should be\r\nshorter, to Philosophy and Poetry. Write to me once every month or two,\r\nand let me know the progress you make. Tell me in what manner you employ\r\nevery hour in the day. The plan I have proposed for you is adapted to\r\nyour present situation only. When that is changed, I shall propose a\r\ncorresponding change of plan. I have ordered the following books to be\r\nsent you from London, to the care of Mr. Madison. Herodotus, Thucydides,\r\nXenophon’s Hellenics, Anabasis, and Memorabilia, Cicero’s works,\r\nBaretti’s Spanish and English Dictionary, Martin’s Philosophical\r\nGrammar, and Martin’s Philosophia Britannica. I will send you the\r\nfollowing from hence. Bezout’s Mathematics, De la Lande’s Astronomy,\r\nMuschenbroeck’s Physics, Quintus Curtius, Justin, a Spanish Grammar, and\r\nsome Spanish books, You will observe that Martin, Bezout, De la Lande,\r\nand Muschenbroeck are not in the preceding plan. They are not to be\r\nopened till you go to the University. You are now, I expect, learning\r\nFrench. You must push this; because the books which will be put into\r\nyour hands when you advance into Mathematics, Natural Philosophy,\r\nNatural History, &c. will be mostly French, these sciences being better\r\ntreated by the French than the English writers. Our future connection\r\nwith Spain renders that the most necessary of the modern languages,\r\nafter the French. When you become a public man, you may have occasion\r\nfor it, and the circumstance of your possessing that language may give\r\nyou a preference over other candidates. I have nothing further to add\r\nfor the present, but husband well your time, cherish your instructors,\r\nstrive to make every body your friend; and be assured that nothing will\r\nbe so pleasing, as your success, to, Dear Peter,\r\n\r\nYour’s affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVI.--TO JOHN PAGE, August 20 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\nParis, August 20 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Page,\r\n\r\nI received your friendly letter of April the 28th, by Mr. Mazzei, on the\r\n22nd of July. That of the month before, by Monsieur La Croix, has not\r\ncome to hand. This correspondence is grateful to some of my warmest\r\nfeelings, as the friendships of my youth are those which adhere closest\r\nto me, and in which I most confide. My principal happiness is now in the\r\nretrospect of life.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your notes of your operations on the Pennsylvania\r\nboundary. I am in hopes that from yourself, Madison, Rittenhouse, or\r\nHutchings, I shall receive a chart of the line as actually run. It will\r\nbe a great present to me. I think Hutchings promised to send it to me. I\r\nhave been much pleased to hear you had it in contemplation, to endeavor\r\nto establish Rittenhouse in our college. This would be an immense\r\nacquisition, and would draw youth to it from every part of the\r\ncontinent. You will do much more honor to our society, on reviving it,\r\nby placing him at its head, than so useless a member as I should be. I\r\nhave been so long diverted from this my favorite line, and that, too,\r\nwithout acquiring an attachment to my adopted one, that I am become a\r\nmongrel, of no decided order, unowned by any, and incapable of serving\r\nany. I should feel myself out of my true place too, to stand before\r\nMcLurg. But why withdraw yourself? You have more zeal, more application,\r\nand more constant attention to the subjects proper to the society, and\r\ncan, therefore, serve them best.\r\n\r\nThe affair of the Emperor and Dutch is settled, though not signed. The\r\nparticulars have not yet transpired. That of the Bavarian exchange is\r\ndropped, and his views on Venice defeated. The alliance of Russia\r\nwith Venice, to prevent his designs in that quarter, and that of the\r\nHanoverian Elector with the King of Prussia and other members of the\r\nGermanic body, to prevent his acquisition of Bavaria, leave him in a\r\nsolitary situation. In truth, he has lost much reputation by his late\r\nmanoeuvres. He is a restless, ambitious character, aiming at every\r\nthing, persevering in nothing, taking up designs without calculating the\r\nforce which will be opposed to him, and dropping them on the appearance\r\nof firm opposition. He has some just views and much activity. The only\r\nquarter in which the peace of Europe seems at present capable of being\r\ndisturbed, is on that of the Porte. It is believed that the Emperor\r\nand Empress have schemes in contemplation for driving the Turks out of\r\nEurope. Were this with a view to re-establish the native Greeks in the\r\nsovereignty of their own country, I could wish them success, and to see\r\ndriven from that delightful country, a set of barbarians, with whom an\r\nopposition to all science is an article of religion. The modern Greek is\r\nnot yet so far departed from its ancient model, but that we might still\r\nhope to see the language of Homer and Demosthenes flow with purity from\r\nthe lips of a free and ingenious people. But these powers have in object\r\nto divide the country between themselves. This is only to substitute one\r\nset of barbarians for another, breaking, at the same time, the balance\r\namong the European powers. You have been told with truth, that the\r\nEmperor of Morocco has shown a disposition to enter into treaty with\r\nus: but not truly, that Congress has not attended to his advances, and\r\nthereby disgusted him. It is long since they took measures to meet his\r\nadvances. But some unlucky incidents have delayed their effect. His\r\ndispositions continue good. As a proof of this, he has lately released\r\nfreely, and clothed well, the crew of an American brig he took last\r\nwinter; the only vessel ever taken from us by any of the States of\r\nBarbary. But what is the English of these good dispositions? Plainly\r\nthis; he is ready to receive us into the number of his tributaries. What\r\nwill be the amount of tribute, remains yet to be known, but it probably\r\nwill not be as small as you may have conjectured. It will surely be\r\nmore than a free people ought to pay to a power owning only four or five\r\nfrigates, under twenty-two guns: he has not a port into which a larger\r\nvessel can enter. The Algerines possess fifteen or twenty frigates,\r\nfrom that size up to fifty guns. Disinclination on their part has lately\r\nbroken off a treaty between Spain and them, whereon they were to have\r\nreceived a million of dollars, besides great presents in naval stores.\r\nWhat sum they intend we shall pay, I cannot say. Then follow Tunis and\r\nTripoli. You will probably find the tribute to all these powers make\r\nsuch a proportion of the federal taxes, as that every man will feel them\r\nsensibly, when he pays those taxes. The question is whether their peace\r\nor war will be cheapest. But it is a question which should be addressed\r\nto our honor, as well as our avarice. Nor does it respect us as to these\r\npirates only, but as to the nations of Europe. If we wish our commerce\r\nto be free and uninsuked, we must let these nations see that we have an\r\nenergy which at present they disbelieve. The low opinion they entertain\r\nof our powers, cannot fail to involve us soon in a naval war.\r\n\r\nI shall send you with this, if I can., and if not, then by the first\r\ngood conveyance, the _Connoissance des Tems_ for the years 1786 and\r\n1787, being all as yet published. You will find in these the tables for\r\nthe planet Herschel, as far as the observations, hitherto made, admit\r\nthem to be calculated. You will see, also, that Herschel was only the\r\nfirst astronomer who discovered it to be a planet, and not the first who\r\nsaw it. Mayer saw it in the year 1756, and placed it in the catalogue of\r\nhis zodiacal stars, supposing it to be such. A Prussian astronomer, in\r\nthe year 1781, observed that the 964th star of Mayer’s catalogue was\r\nmissing: and the calculations now prove that at the time Mayer saw his\r\n964th star, the planet Herschel should have been precisely in the place\r\nwhere he noted that star. I shall send you also a little publication\r\nhere, called the _Bibliothèque Physico-oeconomique_. It will communicate\r\nall the improvements and new discoveries in the arts and sciences, made\r\nin Europe for some years past. I shall be happy to hear from you often.\r\nDetails, political and literary, and even of the small history of our\r\ncountry, are the most pleasing communications possible. Present me\r\naffectionately to Mrs. Page, and to your family, in the members of\r\nwhich, though unknown to me, I feel an interest on account of their\r\nparents. Believe me to be with warm esteem, dear Page, your sincere\r\nfriend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVII.--TO JOHN JAY, August 23, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n(Private.) Paris, August 23, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI shall sometimes ask your permission to write you letters, not\r\nofficial, but private. The present is of this kind, and is occasioned\r\nby the question proposed in yours of June the 14th; ‘Whether it would be\r\nuseful to us, to carry all our own productions, or none?’\r\n\r\nWere we perfectly free to decide this question, I should reason as\r\nfollows. We have now lands enough to employ an infinite number of people\r\nin their cultivation. Cultivators of the earth are the most valuable\r\ncitizens. They are the most vigorous, the most independent, the most\r\nvirtuous, and they are tied to their country, and wedded to its liberty\r\nand interests, by the most lasting bonds. As long, therefore, as\r\nthey can find employment in this line, I would not convert them into\r\nmariners, artisans, or any thing else. But our citizens will find\r\nemployment in this line, till their numbers, and of course their\r\nproductions, become too great for the demand, both internal and foreign.\r\nThis is not the case as yet, and probably will not be for a considerable\r\ntime. As soon as it is, the surplus of hands must be turned to something\r\nelse. I should then, perhaps, wish to turn them to the sea in preference\r\nto manufactures; because, comparing the characters of the two classes,\r\nI find the former the most valuable citizens. I consider the class of\r\nartificers as the panders of vice, and the instruments by which the\r\nliberties of a country are generally overturned. However, we are not\r\nfree to decide this question on principles of theory only. Our people\r\nare decided in the opinion, that it is necessary for us to take a share\r\nin the occupation of the ocean, and their established habits induce\r\nthem to require that the sea be kept open to them, and that that line of\r\npolicy be pursued, which will render the use of that element to them\r\nas great as possible. I think it a duty in those entrusted with the\r\nadministration of their affairs, to conform themselves to the decided\r\nchoice of their constituents: and that therefore, we should, in every\r\ninstance, preserve an equality of right to them in the transportation of\r\ncommodities, in the right of fishing, and in the other uses of the sea.\r\n\r\nBut what will be the consequence? Frequent wars without a doubt. Their\r\nproperty will be violated on the sea and in foreign ports, their persons\r\nwill be insulted, imprisoned, &c. for pretended debts, contracts,\r\ncrimes, contraband, &c. &c. These insults must be resented, even if we\r\nhad no feelings, yet to prevent their eternal repetition; or, in other\r\nwords, our commerce on the ocean and in other countries must be paid for\r\nby frequent war. The justest dispositions possible in ourselves will not\r\nsecure us against it. It would be necessary that all other nations were\r\njust also. Justice indeed, on our part, will save us from those wars\r\nwhich would have been produced by a contrary disposition. But how can\r\nwe prevent those produced by the wrongs of other nations? By putting\r\nourselves in a condition to punish them. Weakness provokes insult and\r\ninjury, while a condition to punish, often prevents them. This reasoning\r\nleads to the necessity of some naval force; that being the only weapon\r\nwith which we can reach an enemy. I think it to our interest to punish\r\nthe first insult: because an insult unpunished is the parent of many\r\nothers. We are not, at this moment, in a condition to do it, but we\r\nshould put ourselves into it, as soon as possible. If a war with England\r\nshould take place, it seems to me that the first thing necessary, would\r\nbe a resolution to abandon the carrying trade, because we cannot protect\r\nit. Foreign nations must, in that case, be invited to bring us what we\r\nwant, and to take our productions in their own bottoms. This alone could\r\nprevent the loss of those productions to us, and the acquisition of\r\nthem to our enemy. Our seamen might be employed in depredations on their\r\ntrade. But how dreadfully we shall suffer on our coasts, if we have\r\nno force on the water, former experience has taught us. Indeed, I look\r\nforward with horror to the very possible case of war with an European\r\npower, and think there is no protection against them, but from the\r\npossession of some force on the sea. Our vicinity to their West India\r\npossessions, and to the fisheries, is a bridle which a small naval\r\nforce, on our part, would hold in the mouths of the most powerful of\r\nthese countries. I hope our land office will rid us of our debts, and\r\nthat our first attention then will be, to the beginning a naval force,\r\nof some sort. This alone can countenance our people as carriers on the\r\nwater, and I suppose them to be determined to continue such.\r\n\r\nI wrote you two public letters on the 14th instant, since which I have\r\nreceived yours of July the 13th. I shall always be pleased to receive\r\nfrom you, in a private way, such communications as you might not choose\r\nto put into a public letter.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very sincere esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVIII.--TO COLONEL MONROE, August 28, 1735\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nParis, August 28, 1735.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you on the 5th of July by Mr. Franklin, and on the 12th of the\r\nsame month by Monsieur Houdon. Since that date, yours of June the 16th,\r\nby Mr. Mazzei, has been received. Every thing looks like peace here. The\r\nsettlement between the Emperor and Dutch is not yet published, but it is\r\nbelieved to be agreed on. Nothing is done, as yet, between him and\r\nthe Porte. He is much wounded by the confederation of several of the\r\nGermanic body, at the head of which is the King of Prussia, and to which\r\nthe King of England, as Elector of Hanover, is believed to accede. The\r\nobject is to preserve the constitution of that empire. It shows that\r\nthese princes entertain serious jealousies of the ambition of the\r\nEmperor, and this will very much endanger the election of his nephew as\r\nKing of the Romans. A late _Arrêt_ of this court against the admission\r\nof British manufactures produces a great sensation in England. I wish\r\nit may produce a disposition there to receive our commerce in all their\r\ndominions, on advantageous terms. This is the only balm which can heal\r\nthe wounds that it has received. It is but too true, that that country\r\nfurnished markets for three fourths of the exports of the eight\r\nnorthernmost states. A truth not proper to be spoken of, but which\r\nshould influence our proceedings with them.\r\n\r\nThe July French packet having arrived without bringing any news of Mr.\r\nLambe, if the English one of the same month be also arrived, without\r\nnews of him, I expect Mr. Adams will concur with me in sending some\r\nother person to treat with the Barbary States. Mr. Barclay is willing to\r\ngo, and I have proposed him to Mr. Adams, but have not yet received his\r\nanswer. The peace expected between Spain and Algiers will probably\r\nnot take place. It is said the former was to have given a million of\r\ndollars. Would it not be prudent to send a minister to Portugal? Our\r\ncommerce with that country is very important; perhaps more so than with\r\nany other country in Europe. It is possible too, that they might permit\r\nour whaling vessels to refresh in Brazil, or give some other indulgences\r\nin America. The lethargic character of their ambassador here, gives a\r\nvery unhopeful aspect to a treaty on this ground. I lately spoke with\r\nhim on the subject, and he has promised to interest himself in obtaining\r\nan answer from his court.\r\n\r\nI have waited to see what was the pleasure of Congress, as to the\r\nsecretaryship of my office here; that is, to see whether they proposed\r\nto appoint a secretary of legation, or leave me to appoint a private\r\nsecretary. Colonel Humphreys’ occupation in the despatches and records\r\nof the matters which relate to the general commissions, does not afford\r\nhim leisure to aid me in my office, were I entitled to ask that aid. In\r\nthe mean time, the long papers which often accompany the communications\r\nbetween the ministers here and myself, and the other business of the\r\noffice, absolutely require a scribe. I shall, therefore, on Mr. Short’s\r\nreturn from the Hague, appoint him my private secretary, ‘til congress\r\nshall think proper to signify their pleasure. The salary allowed Mr.\r\nFranklin, in the same office, was one thousand dollars a year. I shall\r\npresume that Mr Short may draw the same allowance from the funds of the\r\nUnited States here. As soon as I shall have made this appointment, I\r\nshall give official notice of it to Mr. Jay, that Congress may, if they\r\ndisapprove it, say so.\r\n\r\nI am much pleased with your land ordinance, and think it improved from\r\nthe first, in the most material circumstances. I had mistaken the object\r\nof the division of the lands among the States. I am sanguine in my\r\nexpectations of lessening our debts by this fund, and have expressed\r\nmy expectations to the minister and others here. I see by the public\r\npapers, you have adopted the dollar as your money unit. In the\r\narrangement of coins, I proposed, I ought to have inserted a gold coin\r\nof five dollars, which, being within two shillings of the value of a\r\nguinea, would be very convenient.\r\n\r\nThe English papers are so incessantly repeating their lies, about the\r\ntumults, the anarchy, the bankruptcies, and distresses of America, that\r\nthese ideas prevail very generally in Europe. At a large table where\r\nI dined the other day, a gentleman from Switzerland expressed his\r\napprehensions for the fate of Dr. Franklin, as he said he had been\r\ninformed, that he would be received with stones by the people, who were\r\ngenerally dissatisfied with the Revolution, and incensed against\r\nall those who had assisted in bringing it about. I told him his\r\napprehensions were just, and that the people of America would probably\r\nsalute Dr. Franklin with the same stones they had thrown at the Marquis\r\nFayette. The reception of the Doctor is an object of very general\r\nattention, and will weigh in Europe, as an evidence of the satisfaction\r\nor dissatisfaction of America with their Revolution. As you are to be\r\nin Williamsburg early in November, this is the last letter I shall write\r\nyou till about that time.\r\n\r\nI am, with very sincere esteem, dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIX.--TO CAPTAIN JOHN PAUL JONES, August 29,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN JOHN PAUL JONES.\r\n\r\nParis, August 29,1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI received this moment a letter from the Marechal de Castries, of which\r\nthe enclosed is a copy. Having engaged to him to solicit orders for\r\nthe payment of any part of this money due to French subjects to be made\r\nhere, and moreover engaged that, in the mean time, I will order payment,\r\nshould any such claimants offer themselves; I pray you to furnish\r\nme with all the evidence you can, as to what French subjects may be\r\nentitled to any part of the monies you will receive, and to how much,\r\neach of them; and also to advise me by what means I can obtain a certain\r\nroll of all such claimants.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, with great esteem,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER C.--TO JOHN JAY, August 30,1785\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, August 30,1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of writing to you on the 14th instant, by a Mr. Cannon\r\nof Connecticut, who was to sail in the packet. Since that date yours of\r\nJuly the 13th has come to hand. The times for the sailing of the packets\r\nbeing somewhat deranged, I avail myself of a conveyance for the present,\r\nby the Mr. Fitzhugbs of Virginia, who expect to land at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a correspondence which has taken place between the\r\nMarechal de Castries, minister of the Marine, and myself. It is on\r\nthe subject of the prize-money, due to the officers and crew of the\r\nAlliance, for prizes taken in Europe, under the command of Captain\r\nJones. That officer has been here, under the direction of Congress,\r\nnear two years, soliciting the liquidation and payment of that money.\r\nInfinite delays had retarded the liquidation till the month of June. It\r\nwas expected, when the liquidation was announced to be completed, that\r\nthe money was to be received. The M. de Castries doubted the authority\r\nof Captain Jones to receive it, and wrote to me for information. I\r\nwrote him a letter dated July the 10th, which seemed to clear away that\r\ndifficulty. Another arose. A Mr. Puchilberg presented powers to receive\r\nthe money. I wrote then the letter of August the 3rd, and received\r\nthat of the M. de Castries, of August the 12th, acknowledging he was\r\nsatisfied as to this difficulty, but announcing another; to wit, that\r\npossibly some French subjects might have been on board the Alliance, and\r\ntherefore, that Captain Jones ought to give security for the repayment\r\nof their portions. Captain Jones had before told me there was not a\r\nFrenchman on board that vessel, but the captain. I inquired of Mr.\r\nBarclay.. He told me he was satisfied there was not one. Here, then,\r\nwas a mere possibility, a shadow of right, opposed to a certain, to a\r\nsubstantial one, which existed in the mass of the crew, and which was\r\nlikely to be delayed; for it was not to be expected that Captain\r\nJones could, in a strange country, find the security required. These\r\ndifficulties I suppose to have been conjured up, one after another, by\r\nMr. Puchilberg, who wanted to get hold of the money. I saw but one way\r\nto cut short these everlasting delays, which were ruining the officer\r\nsoliciting the payment of the money, and keeping our seamen out of what\r\nthey had hardly fought for, years ago. This was, to undertake to ask an\r\norder from Congress, for the payment of any French claimants by their\r\nbanker in Paris; and, in the mean time, to undertake to order such\r\npayment, should any such claimant prove his title, before the pleasure\r\nof Congress should be made known to me. I consulted with Mr. Barclay,\r\nwho seemed satisfied I might venture this undertaking, because no such\r\nclaim could be presented. I therefore wrote the letter of August the\r\n17th, and received that of August the 26th, finally closing this tedious\r\nbusiness. Should what I have done, not meet the approbation of Congress,\r\nI would pray their immediate sense, because it is not probable that the\r\nwhole of this money will be paid so hastily, but that their orders may\r\narrive in time to stop a sufficiency for any French claimants who may\r\npossibly exist. The following paragraph of a letter from Captain Jones,\r\ndated L’Orient, August the 25th, 1785, further satisfies me, that my\r\nundertaking amounted to nothing in fact. He says, ‘It is impossible\r\nthat any legal demands should be made on you for French subjects, in\r\nconsequence of your engagement to the Marechal. The Alliance was manned\r\nin America, and I never heard of any person’s having served on board\r\nthat frigate, who had been born in France, except the captain, who, as\r\nI was informed, had, in America, abjured the church of Rome, and been\r\nnaturalized.’ Should Congress approve what I have done, I will then\r\nask their resolution for the payment, by their banker here, of any such\r\nclaims as may be properly authenticated, and will moreover pray of\r\nyou an authentic roll of the crew of the Alliance, with the sums to be\r\nallowed to each person; on the subject of which roll, Captain Jones, in\r\nthe letter above mentioned, says, ‘I carried a set of the rolls with me\r\nto America, and before I embarked in the French fleet at Boston, I put\r\nthem into the hands of Mr. Secretary Livingston, and they were sealed\r\nup among the papers of his office, when I left America.’ I think it\r\npossible that Mr. Puchilberg may excite claims. Should any name be\r\noffered which shall not be found on the roll, it will be a sufficient\r\ndisproof of the pretension. Should it be found on the roll, it will\r\nremain to prove the identity of person, and to inquire if payment\r\nmay not have been made in America. I conjecture from the journals of\r\nCongress of June the 2nd, that Landais, who, I believe, was the captain,\r\nmay be in America. As his portion of prize-money may be considerable, I\r\nhope it will be settled in America, where only it can be known whether\r\nany advances have been made him.\r\n\r\nThe person at the head of the post office here, says, he proposed to Dr.\r\nFranklin a convention to facilitate the passage of letters through\r\ntheir office and ours, and that he delivered a draught of the convention\r\nproposed, that it might be sent to Congress. I think it possible he may\r\nbe mistaken in this, as, on my mentioning it to Dr. Franklin, he did not\r\nrecollect any such draught having been put into his hands. An answer,\r\nhowever, is expected by them. I mention it, that Congress may decide\r\nwhether they will make any convention on the subject, and on what\r\nprinciple. The one proposed here was, that for letters passing\r\nhence into America, the French postage should be collected by our\r\npost-officers, and paid every six months, and for letters coming\r\nfrom America here, the American postage should be collected by the\r\npost-officers here, and paid to us in like manner. A second plan,\r\nhowever, presents itself; that is, to suppose the sums to be thus\r\ncollected, on each side, will be equal, or so nearly equal, that the\r\nbalance will not pay for the trouble of keeping accounts, and for the\r\nlittle bickerings that the settlement of accounts and demands of the\r\nbalances may occasion: and therefore, to make an exchange of postage.\r\nThis would better secure our harmony; but I do not know that it would be\r\nagreed to here. If not, the other might then be agreed to.\r\n\r\nI have waited hitherto, supposing that Congress might, possibly, appoint\r\na secretary to the legation here, or signify their pleasure that\r\nI should appoint a private secretary, to aid me in my office. The\r\ncommunications between the ministers and myself requiring often that\r\nmany and long papers should be copied, and that in a shorter time\r\nthan could be done by myself, were I otherwise unoccupied, other\r\ncorrespondences and proceedings, of all which copies must be retained,\r\nand still more the necessity of having some confidential person, who, in\r\ncase of any accident to myself, might be authorized to take possession\r\nof the instructions, letters, and other papers of the office, have\r\nrendered it absolutely necessary for me to appoint a private secretary.\r\nColonel Humphreys finds full occupation, and often more than he can do,\r\nin writing and recording the despatches and proceedings of the general\r\ncommissions. I shall, therefore, appoint Mr. Short, on his return from\r\nthe Hague, with an express condition, that the appointment shall cease\r\nwhenever Congress shall think proper to make any other arrangement. He\r\nwill, of course, expect the allowance heretofore made to the private\r\nsecretaries of the ministers, which, I believe, has been a thousand\r\ndollars a year.\r\n\r\nAn improvement is made here in the construction of muskets, which it may\r\nbe interesting to Congress to know, should they at any time propose to\r\nprocure any. It consists in the making every part of them so exactly\r\nalike, that what belongs to any one, may be used for every other musket\r\nin the magazine. The government here has examined and approved the\r\nmethod, and is establishing a large manufactory for the purpose of\r\nputting it into execution. As yet, the inventor has only completed the\r\nlock of the musket, on this plan. He will proceed immediately to have\r\nthe barrel, stock, and other parts, executed in the same way. Supposing\r\nit might be useful to the United States, I went to the workman. He\r\npresented me the parts of fifty locks taken to pieces, and arranged in\r\ncompartments. I put several together myself, taking pieces at hazard\r\nas they came to hand, and they fitted in the most perfect manner. The\r\nadvantages of this, when arms need repair, are evident. He effects it by\r\ntools of his own contrivance, which, at the same time, abridge the work,\r\nso that he thinks he shall be able to furnish the musket two livres\r\ncheaper than the common price. But it will be two or three years before\r\nhe will be able to furnish any quantity. I mention it now, as it may\r\nhave an influence on the plan for furnishing our magazines with this\r\narm.\r\n\r\nEvery thing in Europe remains as when I wrote you last. The peace\r\nbetween Spain and Algiers has the appearance of being broken off. The\r\nFrench packet having arrived without Mr. Lambe, or any news of him, I\r\nawait Mr. Adams’s acceding to the proposition mentioned in my last. I\r\nsend you the Gazettes of Leyden and France to this date, and have the\r\nhonor to be, with the highest respect and esteem, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CI.--TO JAMES MADISON, September 1,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, September 1,1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you by Monsieur de Doradour, was dated May the 11th. Since\r\nthat, I have received yours of January the 22nd with six copies of the\r\nrevisal, and that of April the 27th by Mr. Mazzei.\r\n\r\nAll is quiet here. The Emperor and Dutch have certainly agreed, though\r\nthey have not published their agreement. Most of his schemes in Germany\r\nmust be postponed, if they are not prevented by the confederacy of many\r\nof the Germanic body, at the head of which is the King of Prussia, and\r\nto which the Elector of Hanover is supposed to have acceded. The object\r\nof the league is to preserve the members of the empire in their present\r\nstate. I doubt whether the jealousy entertained of this prince, and\r\nwhich is so fully evidenced by this league, may not defeat the election\r\nof his nephew to be King of the Romans, and thus produce an instance of\r\nbreaking the lineal succession. Nothing is as yet done between him and\r\nthe Turks. If any thing is produced in that quarter, it will not be for\r\nthis year. The court of Madrid has obtained the delivery of the crew\r\nof the brig Betsey, taken by the Emperor of Morocco. The Emperor had\r\ntreated them kindly, new-clothed them, and delivered them to the Spanish\r\nminister, who sent them to Cadiz. This is the only American vessel ever\r\ntaken by the Barbary States. The Emperor continues to give proofs of his\r\ndesire to be in friendship with us, or, in other words, of receiving us\r\ninto the number of his tributaries. Nothing further need be feared from\r\nhim. I wish the Algerines may be as easily dealt with. I fancy the peace\r\nexpected between them and Spain is not likely to take place. I am well\r\ninformed that the late proceedings in America have produced a wonderful\r\nsensation in England in our favor. I mean the disposition, which seems\r\nto be becoming general, to invest Congress with the regulation of\r\nour commerce, and, in the mean time, the measures taken to defeat the\r\navidity of the British government, grasping at our carrying business.\r\nI can add with truth, that it was not till these symptoms appeared in\r\nAmerica, that I have been able to discover the smallest token of\r\nrespect towards the United States, in any part of Europe. There was an\r\nenthusiasm towards us, all over Europe, at the moment of the peace. The\r\ntorrent of lies published unremittingly, in every day’s London paper,\r\nfirst made an impression, and produce a coolness. The republication of\r\nthese lies in most of the papers of Europe (done probably by authority\r\nof the governments to discourage emigrations) carried them home to the\r\nbelief of every mind. They supposed every thing in America was anarchy,\r\ntumult, and civil war. The reception of the Marquis Fayette gave a check\r\nto these ideas. The late proceedings seem to be producing a decisive\r\nvibration in our favor. I think it possible that England may ply before\r\nthem. It is a nation which nothing but views of interest can govern. If\r\nthey produce us good there, they will here also. The defeat of the Irish\r\npropositions is also in our favor.\r\n\r\nI have at length made up the purchase of books for you, as far as it can\r\nbe done at present. The objects which I have not yet been able to get, I\r\nshall continue to seek for. Those purchased, are packed this morning in\r\ntwo trunks, and you have the catalogue and prices herein inclosed. The\r\nfuture charges of transportation shall be carried into the next bill.\r\nThe amount of the present is 1154 livres, 13 sous, which, reckoning the\r\nFrench crown of six livres at six shillings and eight pence, Virginia\r\nmoney, is £64. 3s., which sum you will be so good as to keep in your\r\nhands, to be used occasionally in the education of my nephews, when the\r\nregular resources disappoint you. To the same use I would pray you to\r\napply twenty-five guineas, which I have lent the two Mr. Fitz-hughs of\r\nMarmion, and which I have desired them to repay into your hands. You\r\nwill of course deduct the price of the revisals, and of any other\r\narticles you may have been so kind as to pay for me. Greek and Roman\r\nauthors are dearer here, than, I believe, any where in the world. Nobody\r\nhere reads them; wherefore they are not reprinted. Don Ulloa, in the\r\noriginal, is not to be found. The collection of tracts on the economies\r\nof different nations, we cannot find; nor Amelot’s Travels into China.\r\nI shall send these two trunks of books to Havre, there to wait a\r\nconveyance to America; for as to the fixing the packets there, it is as\r\nuncertain as ever. The other articles you mention, shall be procured\r\nas far as they can be. Knowing that some of them would be better got in\r\nLondon, I commissioned Mr. Short, who was going there, to get them. He\r\nhas not yet returned. They will be of such a nature as that I can\r\nget some gentleman who may be going to America, to take them in his\r\nportmanteau. Le Maire being now able to stand on his own legs, there\r\nwill be no necessity for your advancing him the money I desired, if it\r\nis not already done. I am anxious to hear from you on the subject of\r\nmy Notes on Virginia. I have been obliged to give so many of them here,\r\nthat I fear their getting published. I have received an application from\r\nthe Directors of the public buildings, to procure them a plan for their\r\ncapitol. I shall send them one taken from the best morsel of ancient\r\narchitecture now remaining. It has obtained the approbation of fifteen\r\nor sixteen centuries, and is, therefore, preferable to any design which\r\nmight be newly contrived. It will give more room, be more convenient,\r\nand cost less, than the plan they sent me. Pray encourage them to wait\r\nfor it, and to execute it. It will be superior in beauty to any thing in\r\nAmerica, and not inferior to any thing in the world. It is very simple.\r\nHave you a copying press? If you have not, you should get one. Mine\r\n(exclusive of paper, which costs a guinea a ream) has cost me about\r\nfourteen guineas. I would give ten times that sum, to have had it from\r\nthe date of the stamp act. I hope you will be so good as to continue\r\nyour communications, both of the great and small kind, which are equally\r\nuseful to me. Be assured of the sincerity with which I am, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CII.--TO MESSRS. DUMAS AND SHORT, September 1, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. DUMAS AND SHORT.\r\n\r\nParis, September 1, 1785.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nI have been duly honored with the receipt of your separate letters of\r\nAugust 23rd, and should sooner have returned an answer, but that as you\r\nhad written also to Mr. Adams, I thought it possible I might receive his\r\nsentiments on the subject, in time for the post. Not thinking it proper\r\nto lose the occasion of the post, I have concluded to communicate to you\r\nmy separate sentiments, which you will of course pay attention to, only\r\nso far as they may concur with what you shall receive from Mr. Adams.\r\n\r\nOn a review of our letters to the Baron de Thulemeyer, I do not find\r\nthat we had proposed that the treaty should be in two columns, the\r\none English, and the other what he should think proper. We certainly\r\nintended to have proposed it. We had agreed together that it should be\r\nan article of system with us, and the omission of it, in this instance,\r\nhas been accidental. My own opinion, therefore, is, that to avoid the\r\nappearance of urging new propositions when every thing appeared to be\r\narranged, we should agree to consider the French column as the original,\r\nif the Baron de Thulemeyer thinks himself bound to insist on it: but\r\nif the practice of his court will admit of the execution in the two\r\nlanguages, each to be considered as equally original, it would be very\r\npleasing to me, as it will accommodate it to our views, relieve us from\r\nthe embarrassment of this precedent, which may be urged against us on\r\nother occasions, and be more agreeable to our country, where the French\r\nlanguage is spoken by very few. This method will be also attended with\r\nthe advantage, that if any expression in any part of the treaty is\r\nequivocal in the one language, its true sense will be known by the\r\ncorresponding passage in the other.\r\n\r\nThe errors of the copyist, in the French column, you will correct of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very high esteem, Gentlemen,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CIII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, September 4, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, September 4, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nOn receipt of your favors of August the 18th and 23rd, I conferred with\r\nMr. Barclay on the measures necessary to be taken to set our treaty with\r\nthe piratical States into motion, through his agency. Supposing that we\r\nshould begin with the Emperor of Morocco, a letter to the Emperor and\r\ninstructions to Mr. Barclay, seemed necessary. I have therefore sketched\r\nsuch outlines for these, as appear to me to be proper. You will be so\r\ngood as to detract, add to, or alter them as you please, to return such\r\nas you approve under your signature, to which I will add mine. A\r\nperson understanding English, French, and Italian, and at the same\r\ntime meriting confidence, was not to be met with here. Colonel Franks,\r\nunderstanding the two first languages perfectly, and a little Spanish\r\ninstead of Italian, occurred to Mr. Barclay as the fittest person he\r\ncould employ for a secretary. We think his allowance (exclusive of his\r\ntravelling expenses and his board, which will be paid by Mr. Barclay in\r\ncommon with his own) should be between one hundred and one hundred and\r\nfifty guineas a year. Fix it where you please, between these limits.\r\nWhat is said in the instructions to Mr. Barclay, as to his own\r\nallowance, was proposed by himself. My idea as to the partition of the\r\nwhole sum to which we are limited (eighty thousand dollars), was,\r\nthat one half of it should be kept in reserve for the Algerines. They\r\ncertainly possess more than half the whole power of the piratical\r\nStates. I thought then, that Morocco might claim the half of the\r\nremainder, that is to say, one fourth of the whole. For this reason, in\r\nthe instructions, I propose twenty thousand dollars as the limit of the\r\nexpenses of the Morocco treaty. Be so good as to think of it, and make\r\nit what you please. I should be more disposed to enlarge than abridge\r\nit, on account of their neighborhood to our Atlantic trade. I did not\r\nthink that these papers should be trusted through the post office, and\r\ntherefore, as Colonel Franks is engaged in the business, he comes with\r\nthem. Passing by the diligence, the whole expense will not exceed twelve\r\nor fourteen guineas. I suppose we are bound to avail ourselves of the\r\nco-operation of France. I will join you, therefore, in any letter you\r\nthink proper to write to the Count de Vergennes. Would you think it\r\nexpedient to write to Mr. Carmichael, to interest the interposition of\r\nthe Spanish court? I will join you in any thing of this kind you will\r\noriginate. In short, be so good as to supply whatever you may think\r\nnecessary. With respect to the money, Mr. Jay’s information to you was,\r\nthat it was to be drawn from Holland. It will rest therefore with you,\r\nto avail Mr. Barclay of that fund, either by your draft, or by a letter\r\nof credit to the bankers in his favor, to the necessary amount. I\r\nimagine the Dutch consul at Morocco may be rendered an useful character,\r\nin the remittances of money to Mr. Barclay, while at Morocco.\r\n\r\nYou were apprised, by a letter from Mr. Short, of the delay which had\r\narisen in the execution of the treaty with Prussia. I wrote a separate\r\nletter, of which I enclose you a copy, hoping it would meet one from\r\nyou, and set them again into motion.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following are the sketches of the letter to the Emperor of Morocco,\r\nand of the instructions to Mr. Barclay, referred to in the preceding\r\nletter.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADS FOR A LETTER TO THE EMPEROR OF MOROCCO.\r\n\r\nThat the United States of America, heretofore connected in government\r\nwith Great Britain, had found it necessary for their happiness to\r\nseparate from her, and to assume an independent station.\r\n\r\nThat, consisting of a number of separate States, they had confederated\r\ntogether, and placed the sovereignty of the whole, in matters relating\r\nto foreign nations, in a body consisting of delegates from every State,\r\nand called the Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\nThat Great Britain had solemnly confirmed their separation and\r\nacknowledged their independence.\r\n\r\nThat after the conclusion of the peace, which terminated the war in\r\nwhich they had been engaged for the establishment of their independence,\r\nthe first attentions of Congress were necessarily engrossed by the\r\nre-establishment of order and regular government.\r\n\r\nThat they had, as soon as possible, turned their attention to foreign\r\nnations, and, desirous of entering into amity and commerce with them,\r\nhad been pleased to appoint us, with Dr. Benjamin Franklin, to execute\r\nsuch treaties for this purpose, as should be agreed on by such nations,\r\nwith us, or any two of us.\r\n\r\nThat Dr. Franklin having found it, necessary to return to America, the\r\nexecution of these several commissions had devolved on us. That being\r\nplaced as Ministers Plenipotentiary for the United States at the courts\r\nof England and France; this circumstance, with the commissions with\r\nwhich we are charged for entering into treaties with various other\r\nnations, puts it out of our power to attend at the other courts in\r\nperson, and obliges us to negotiate by the intervention of confidential\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nThat, respecting the friendly dispositions shown by his Majesty, the\r\nEmperor of Morocco, towards the United States, and indulging the desire\r\nof forming a connection with a sovereign, so renowned for his power, his\r\nwisdom, and his justice, we had embraced the first moment possible, of\r\nassuring him of these the sentiments of our country and of ourselves,\r\nand of expressing to him our wishes to enter into a connection of\r\nfriendship and commerce with him. That for this purpose, we had\r\ncommissioned the bearer hereof, Thomas Barclay, a person in the highest\r\nconfidence of the Congress of the United States, and as such, having\r\nbeen several years, and still being, their consul general with our\r\ngreat and good friend and ally, the King of France, to arrange with his\r\nMajesty the Emperor, those conditions which it might be advantageous for\r\nboth nations to adopt, for the regulation of their commerce, and their\r\nmutual conduct towards each other.\r\n\r\nThat we deliver to him a copy of the full powers with which we are\r\ninvested, to conclude a treaty with his Majesty, which copy he is\r\ninstructed to present to his Majesty.\r\n\r\nThat though by these, we are not authorized to delegate to him the\r\npower of ultimately signing the treaty, yet such is our reliance on his\r\nwisdom, his integrity, and his attention to the instructions with which\r\nhe is charged, that we assure his Majesty, the conditions which he shall\r\narrange and send to us, shall be returned with our signature, in order\r\nto receive that of the person whom his Majesty shall commission for the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADS OF INSTRUCTION TO MR. BARCLAY.\r\n\r\nCongress having been pleased to invest us with full powers for entering\r\ninto a treaty of amity and alliance with the Emperor of Morocco, and it\r\nbeing impracticable for us to attend his court in person, and equally\r\nimpracticable, on account of our separate stations, to receive a\r\nminister from him, we have concluded to effect our object by the\r\nintervention of a confidential person. We concur in wishing to avail\r\nthe United States of your talents in the execution of this business, and\r\ntherefore furnish you with a letter to the Emperor of Morocco, to give\r\ndue credit to your transactions with him.\r\n\r\nWe advise you to proceed by the way of Madrid, where you will have\r\nopportunities of deriving many lights from Mr. Carmichael, through whom\r\nmany communications with the court of Morocco have already passed.\r\n\r\nFrom thence you will proceed, by such route as you shall think best, to\r\nthe court of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nYou will present to him our letter, with the copy of our full powers,\r\nwith which you are furnished, at such time or times, and in such manner,\r\nas you shall find best.\r\n\r\nYou will proceed to negotiate with his minister the terms of a treaty\r\nof amity and commerce, as nearly conformed as possible to the draught\r\nwe give you. Where alterations, which, in your opinion, shall not be of\r\ngreat importance, shall be urged by the other party, you are at liberty\r\nto agree to them. Where they shall be of great importance, and such as\r\nyou think should be rejected, you will reject them: but where they are\r\nof great importance, and you think they may be accepted, you will ask\r\ntime to take our advice, and will advise with us accordingly, by letter\r\nor by courier, as you shall think best. When the articles shall all\r\nbe agreed, you will send them to us by some proper person, for our\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\nThe whole expense of this treaty, including as well the expenses of\r\nall persons employed about it, as the presents to the Emperor and his\r\nservants, must not exceed twenty thousand dollars: and we urge you\r\nto use your best endeavors, to bring it as much below that sum as you\r\npossibly can. As custom may have rendered some presents necessary in the\r\nbeginning or progress of this business, and before it is concluded,\r\nor even in a way to be concluded, we authorize you to conform to the\r\ncustom, confiding in your discretion to hazard as little as possible,\r\nbefore a certainty of the event. We trust to you also to procure the\r\nbest information, as to what persons, and in what form, these presents\r\nshould be made, and to make them accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the customs of that and other courts, the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining knowledge of those customs, but on the spot, and\r\nour great confidence in your discretion, induce us to leave to that, all\r\nother circumstances relative to the object of your mission. It will\r\nbe necessary for you to take a secretary, well skilled in the French\r\nlanguage, to aid you in your business, and to take charge of your\r\npapers in case of any accident to yourself. We think you may allow\r\nhim ¦---------guineas a year, besides his expenses for travelling and\r\nsubsistence. We engage to furnish your own expenses, according to the\r\nrespectability of the character with which you are invested, but as\r\nto the allowance for your trouble, we wish to leave it to Congress. We\r\nannex hereto sundry heads of inquiry which we wish you to make, and to\r\ngive us thereon the best information you shall be able to obtain. We\r\ndesire you to correspond with us by every opportunity which you think\r\nshould be trusted, giving us, from time to time, an account of your\r\nproceedings and prospects.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADS OF INQUIRY FOR MR. BARCLAY, AS TO MOROCCO.\r\n\r\n1. Commerce. What are the articles of their export and import? What\r\nduties are levied by them on exports and imports?

It was then put where I usually place my\r\nunanswered letters; and I, from time to time, put off acknowledging\r\nthe receipt of it, till I should be able to furnish you American\r\nintelligence worth communicating. A favorable opportunity, by a courier,\r\nof writing to you occurring this morning, what has been my astonishment\r\nand chagrin on reading your letter again, to find there was a case in\r\nit which required an immediate answer, but which, by the variety of\r\nmatters, which happened to be presented to my mind, at the same time,\r\nhad utterly escaped my recollection. I pray you to be assured, that\r\nnothing but this slip of memory would have prevented my immediate\r\nanswer, and no other circumstance would have prevented its making such\r\nan impression on my mind, as that it could not have escaped. I hope\r\nyou will therefore obliterate the imputation of want of respect, which,\r\nunder actual appearances, must have arisen in your mind, but which\r\nwould refer to an untrue cause the occasion of my silence. I am not\r\nsufficiently acquainted with the proceedings of the New York Assembly,\r\nto say, with certainty, in what predicament the lands of Mr. Upton may\r\nstand. But on conferring with Colonel Humphreys, who, being from the\r\nneighboring State, was more in the way of knowing what passed in New\r\nYork, he thinks that the descriptions in their confiscation laws were\r\nsuch, as not to include a case of this nature. The first thing to be\r\ndone by Mr. Upton is, to state his case to some intelligent lawyer\r\nof the country, that he may know with certainty whether they be\r\nconfiscated, or not; and if not confiscated, to know what measures are\r\nnecessary for completing and securing his grant. But if confiscated,\r\nthere is then no other tribunal of redress but their General Assembly.\r\nIf he is unacquainted there, I would advise him to apply to Colonel\r\nHamilton, who was aid to General Washington, and is now very eminent at\r\nthe bar, and much to be relied on. Your letter in his favor to Mr. Jay\r\nwill also procure him the benefit of his counsel.\r\n\r\nWith respect to America, I will rather give you a general view of\r\nits situation, than merely relate recent events. The impost is still\r\nunpassed by the two States of New York and Rhode Island: for the manner\r\nin which the latter has passed it does not appear to me to answer the\r\nprincipal object, of establishing a fund, which, by being subject to\r\nCongress alone, may give such credit to the certificates of public debt,\r\nas will make them negotiable. This matter, then, is still suspended.\r\n\r\nCongress have lately purchased the Indian right to nearly the whole of\r\nthe land lying in the new State, bounded by lake Erie, Pennsylvania, and\r\nthe Ohio. The northwestern corner alone is reserved to the Delawares and\r\nWyandots. I expect a purchase is also concluded with other tribes, for a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the State next to this, on the north side\r\nof the Ohio. They have passed an ordinance establishing a land-office,\r\nconsiderably improved, I think, on the plan, of which I had the honor of\r\ngiving you a copy. The lands are to be offered for sale to the highest\r\nbidder. For this purpose, portions of them are to be proposed in each\r\nState, that each may have the means of purchase carried equally to their\r\ndoors, and that the purchasers may be a proper mixture of the citizens\r\nfrom all the different States. But such lots as cannot be sold for a\r\ndollar an acre, are not to be parted with. They will receive as money\r\nthe certificates of public debt. I flatter myself that this arrangement\r\nwill very soon absorb the whole of these certificates, and thus rid\r\nus of our domestic debt, which is four fifths of our whole debt. Our\r\nforeign debt will be then a bagatelle.\r\n\r\nI think it probable that Vermont will be made independent, as I am told\r\nthe State of New York is likely to agree to it. Maine will probably in\r\ntime be also permitted to separate from Massachusetts. As yet, they only\r\nbegin to think of it. Whenever the people of Kentucky shall have agreed\r\namong themselves, my friends write me word, that Virginia will consent\r\nto their separation. They will constitute the new State on the south\r\nside of Ohio, joining Virginia. North Corolina, by an act of their\r\nAssembly, ceded to Congress all their lands westward of the Allegany.\r\nThe people inhabiting that territory thereon declared themselves\r\nindependent, called their State by the name of Franklin, and solicited\r\nCongress to be received into the Union. But before Congress met, North\r\nCarolina (for what reasons I could never learn) resumed their session.\r\nThe people, however, persist; Congress recommend to the State to desist\r\nfrom their opposition, and I have no doubt they will do it. It will,\r\ntherefore, result from the act of Congress laying off the western\r\ncountry into new States, that these States will come into the Union\r\nin the manner therein provided, and without any disputes as to their\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\nI am told that some hostile transaction by our people at the Natchez,\r\nagainst the Spaniards, has taken place. If it be a fact, Congress\r\nwill certainly not protect them, but leave them to be chastised by the\r\nSpaniards, saving the right to the territory. A Spanish minister being\r\nnow with Congress, and both parties interested in keeping the peace, I\r\nthink, if such an event has happened, it will be easily arranged.\r\n\r\nI told you when here, of the propositions made by Congress to the\r\nStates, to be authorized to make certain regulations in their commerce;\r\nand, that from the disposition to strengthen the hands of Congress,\r\nwhich was then growing fast, I thought they would consent to it. Most of\r\nthem did so, and I suppose all of them would have done it, if they have\r\nnot actually done it, but that events proved a much more extensive power\r\nwould be requisite. Congress have, therefore, desired to be invested\r\nwith the whole regulation of their trade, and for ever; and to prevent\r\nall temptations to abuse the power, and all fears of it, they propose\r\nthat whatever monies shall be levied on commerce, either for the purpose\r\nof revenue, or by way of forfeitures or penalty, shall go directly into\r\nthe coffers of the State wherein it is levied, without being touched\r\nby Congress. From the present temper of the States, and the conviction\r\nwhich your country has carried home to their minds, that there is no\r\nother method of defeating the greedy attempts of other countries to\r\ntrade with them on unequal terms, I think they will add an article for\r\nthis purpose to their Confederation. But the present powers of Congress\r\nover the commerce of the States, under the Confederation, seem not at\r\nall understood by your ministry. They say that body has no power to\r\nenter into a treaty of commerce; why then make one? This is a mistake.\r\nBy the sixth article of the Confederation, the States renounce,\r\nindividually, all power to make any treaty, of whatever nature, with\r\na foreign nation. By the ninth article, they give the power of making\r\ntreaties wholly to Congress with two reservations only. 1. That no\r\ntreaty of commerce shall be made, which shall restrain the legislatures\r\nfrom making foreigners pay the same imposts with their own people: nor\r\n2. from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of\r\nmerchandise, which they might think proper. Were any treaty to be made\r\nwhich should violate either of these two reservations, it would be so\r\nfar void. In the treaties, therefore, made with France, Holland, &c.\r\nthis has been cautiously avoided. But are these treaties of no advantage\r\nto these nations? Besides the advantages expressly given by them, there\r\nresults another, of great value. The commerce of those nations with\r\nthe United States is thereby under the protection of Congress, and no\r\nparticular State, acting by fits and starts, can harass the trade of\r\nFrance, Holland, &c. by such measures as several of them have practised\r\nagainst England, by loading her merchandise with partial imposts,\r\nrefusing admittance to it altogether, excluding her merchants, &c. &c.\r\nFor you will observe, that though, by the second reservation before\r\nmentioned, they can prohibit the importation of any species of\r\nmerchandise, as, for instance, though they may prohibit the importation\r\nof wines in general, yet they cannot prohibit that of French wines in\r\nparticular. Another advantage is, that the nations having treaties with\r\nCongress, can and do provide in such treaties for the admission of\r\ntheir consuls, a kind of officer very necessary for the regulation\r\nand protection of commerce. You know that a consul is the creature of\r\ntreaty. No nation, without an agreement, can place an officer in another\r\ncountry, with any powers or jurisdiction whatever. But as the States\r\nhave renounced the separate power of making treaties with foreign\r\nnations, they cannot separately receive a consul: and as Congress have,\r\nby the Confederation, no immediate jurisdiction over commerce, as\r\nthey have only a power of bringing that jurisdiction into existence\r\nby entering into a treaty, till such treaty be entered into, Congress\r\nthemselves cannot receive a consul. Till a treaty then, there exists no\r\npower in any part of our government, federal or particular, to admit\r\na consul among us: and if it be true, as the papers say, that you have\r\nlately sent one over, he cannot be admitted by any power in existence\r\nto an exercise of any function. Nothing less than a new article, to be\r\nagreed to by all the States, would enable Congress, or the particular\r\nStates, to receive him. You must not be surprised then, if he be not\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nI think I have by this time tired you with American politics, and will\r\ntherefore only add assurances of the sincere regard and esteem, with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CV.--TO BARON GEISMER, September 6, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BARON GEISMER.\r\n\r\nParis, September 6, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour letter of March the 28th, which I received about a month after its\r\ndate, gave me a very real pleasure, as it assured me of an existence\r\nwhich I valued, and of which I had been led to doubt. You are now too\r\ndistant from America, to be much interested in what passes there. From\r\nthe London gazettes, and the papers copying them, you are led to suppose\r\nthat all there is anarchy, discontent, and civil war. Nothing, however,\r\nis less true. There are not on the face of the earth, more tranquil\r\ngovernments than ours, nor a happier and more contented people. Their\r\ncommerce has not as yet found the channels, which their new relations\r\nwith the world will offer to best advantage, and the old ones remain as\r\nyet unopened by new conventions. This occasions a stagnation in the sale\r\nof their produce, the only truth among all the circumstances published\r\nabout them. Their hatred against Great Britain, having lately received\r\nfrom that nation new cause and new aliment, has taken a new spring.\r\nAmong the individuals of your acquaintance, nothing remarkable has\r\nhappened. No revolution in the happiness of any of them has taken place,\r\nexcept that of the loss of their only child to Mr. and Mrs. Walker,\r\nwho, however, left them a grandchild for their solace, and that of your\r\nhumble servant, who remains with no other family than two daughters, the\r\nelder here (who was of your acquaintance), the younger in Virginia,\r\nbut expected here the next summer. The character in which I am here,\r\nat present, confines me to this place, and will confine me as long as I\r\ncontinue in Europe. How long this will be, I cannot tell. I am now of\r\nan age which does not easily accommodate itself to new manners and new\r\nmodes of living: and I am savage enough to prefer the woods, the wilds,\r\nand the independence of Monticello, to all the brilliant pleasures\r\nof this gay capital. I shall, therefore, rejoin myself to my native\r\ncountry, with new attachments, and with exaggerated esteem for its\r\nadvantages; for though there is less wealth there, there is more\r\nfreedom, more ease, and less misery. I should like it better, however,\r\nif it could tempt you once more to visit it: but that is not to be\r\nexpected. Be this as it may, and whether fortune means to allow or deny\r\nme the pleasure of ever seeing you again, be assured that the worth\r\nwhich gave birth to my attachment, and which still animates it, will\r\ncontinue to keep it up while we both live, and that it is with sincerity\r\nI subscribe myself, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVI.--TO JOHN LANGDON, September 11, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN LANGDON.\r\n\r\nParis, September 11, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour Captain Yeaton being here, furnishes me an opportunity of paying\r\nthe tribute of my congratulations on your appointment to the government\r\nof your State, which I do sincerely. He gives me the grateful\r\nintelligence of your health, and that of Mrs. Langdon. Anxious to\r\npromote your service, and believing he could do it by getting himself\r\nnaturalized here, and authorized to command your vessel he came from\r\nHavre to Paris. But on making the best inquiries I could, it seemed that\r\nthe time requisite to go through with this business, would be much more\r\nthan he could spare. He therefore declined it. I wish it were in my\r\npower to give you a hope that our commerce, either with this country,\r\nor its islands, was likely to be put on better footing. But if it be\r\naltered at all, it will probably be for the worse. The regulations\r\nrespecting their commerce are by no means sufficiently stable to be\r\nrelied on.\r\n\r\nEurope is in quiet, and likely to remain so. The affairs of the Emperor\r\nand Dutch are as good as settled, and no other cloud portends any\r\nimmediate storm. You have heard much of American vessels taken by the\r\nBarbary pirates. The Emperor of Morocco took one last winter (the brig\r\nBetsey of Philadelphia); he did not however reduce the crew to slavery,\r\nnor confiscate the vessel or cargo. He has lately delivered up the crew\r\non the solicitation of the Spanish court. No other has ever been taken\r\nby them. There are, indeed, rumors of one having been lately taken by\r\nthe Algerines. The fact is possible, as there is nothing to hinder their\r\ntaking them, but it is not as yet confirmed. I have little doubt that\r\nwe shall be able to place our commerce on a popular footing with the\r\nBarbary States this summer, and thus not only render our navigation\r\nto Portugal and Spain safe, but open the Mediterranean as formerly. In\r\nspite of treaties, England is still our enemy. Her hatred is deep-rooted\r\nand cordial, and nothing is wanting with her but the power, to wipe us\r\nand the land we live on out of existence. Her interest, however, is her\r\nruling passion! and the late American measures have struck at that so\r\nvitally, and with an energy, too, of which she had thought us quite\r\nincapable, that a possibility seems to open of forming some arrangement\r\nwith her. When they shall see decidedly, that, without it we shall\r\nsuppress their commerce with us, they will be agitated by their avarice\r\non the one hand, and their hatred and their fear of us on the other. The\r\nresult of this conflict of dirty passions is yet to be awaited. The\r\nbody of the people of this country love us cordially. But ministers and\r\nmerchants love nobody. The merchants here are endeavoring to exclude,\r\nus from their islands. The ministers will be governed in it by political\r\nmotives, and will do it, or not do it, as these shall appear to dictate,\r\nwithout love or hatred to any body. It were to be wished that they were\r\nable to combine better the various circumstances, which prove, beyond a\r\ndoubt, that all the advantages of their colonies result, in the end, to\r\nthe mother country. I pray you to present me in the most friendly terms\r\nto Mrs. Langdon, and be assured of the esteem with which I am\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVII.--LISTER ASQUITH, September 14, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LISTER ASQUITH.\r\n\r\nParis, September 14, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nSeveral of your letters have been received, and we have been occupied\r\nin endeavors to have you discharged: but these have been ineffectual. If\r\nour information be right, you are mistaken in supposing you are already\r\ncondemned. The Farmers General tell us, you are to be tried at Brest,\r\nand this trial may perhaps be a month hence. From that court you\r\nmay appeal to the Parliament of Rennes, and from that to the King in\r\nCouncil. They say, that from the depositions sent to them, there can be\r\nno doubt you came to smuggle, and that in that case, the judgment of the\r\nlaw is a forfeiture of the vessel and cargo, a fine of a thousand\r\nlivres on each of you, and six years’ condemnation to the galleys. These\r\nseveral appeals will be attended with considerable expense. They offer\r\nto discharge your persons and vessel (but not the cargo) on your paying\r\ntwo thousand livres, and the costs already incurred; which are three or\r\nfour hundred more. You will therefore choose, whether to go through the\r\ntrial, or to compromise, and you are the best judge, what may be the\r\nevidence for or against you. In either case, I shall render you all the\r\nservice I can. I will add, that if you are disposed to have the matter\r\ntried, I am of opinion, that, if found against you, there will be no\r\ndanger of their sending you to the galleys; so that you may decide what\r\ncourse you will take, without any bias from that fear. If you choose to\r\ncompromise, I will endeavor to have it done for you, on the best terms\r\nwe can. I fear they will abate little from the two thousand livres,\r\nbecause Captain Deville, whom you sent here, fixed the matter by\r\noffering that sum, and has done you more harm than good. I shall be glad\r\nif you will desire your lawyer to make out a state of your case, (which\r\nhe may do in French,) and send it to me. Write me also yourself a plain\r\nand full narration of your voyage, and the circumstances which have\r\nbrought so small a vessel, with so small a cargo, from America into\r\nFrance. As far as we yet know them, they are not in your favor. Inform\r\nme who you are, and what papers you have on board. But do not state to\r\nme a single fact which is not true: for if I am led by your information\r\nto advance any thing which they shall prove to be untrue, I will abandon\r\nyour case from that moment: whereas, sending me a true statement, I will\r\nmake the best of it I can. Mr. Barclay, the American consul, will be\r\nhere some few days yet. He will be, as he has already been, of much\r\nservice to you, if the information I ask both from yourself and your\r\nlawyer, can come before his departure. I repeat my assurances of doing\r\nwhatever I can for you, and am, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour very humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVIII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, September 19, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, September 19, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nLambe has arrived. He brings new full powers to us from Congress, to\r\nappoint persons to negotiate with the Barbary States; but we are to sign\r\nthe treaties. Lambe has not even a recommendation from them to us, but\r\nit seems clear that he would be approved by them. I told him of Mr.\r\nBarclay’s appointment to Morocco, and proposed Algiers to him. He\r\nagrees. A small alteration in the form of our despatches will be\r\nnecessary, and, of course, another courier shall be despatched to you on\r\nthe return of Colonel Franks, for your pleasure herein.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.*\r\n\r\n     [* The original of the above was in cipher; though, as in\r\n     the case of most of the Author’s letters in cipher, he\r\n     prepared and preserved a literal copy of it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CIX.--TO JAMES MADISON, September 20, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, September 20, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Fitzhugh, you will receive my letter of the first instant. He\r\nis still here, and gives me an opportunity of again addressing you much\r\nsooner than I should have done, but for the discovery of a great piece\r\nof inattention. In that letter I send you a detail of the cost of your\r\nbooks, and desire you to keep the amount in your hands, as if I had\r\nforgot that a part of it was in fact your own, as being a balance of\r\nwhat I had remained in your debt. I really did not attend to it in the\r\nmoment of writing, and when it occurred to me, I revised my memorandum\r\nbook from the time of our being in Philadelphia together, and stated our\r\naccount from the beginning, lest I should forget or mistake any part of\r\nit. I enclose you this statement. You will always be so good as to let\r\nme know, from time to time, your advances for me. Correct with freedom\r\nall my proceedings for you, as, in what I do, I have no other desire\r\nthan that of doing exactly what will be most pleasing to you.\r\n\r\nI received this summer a letter from Messrs. Buchanan and Hay, as\r\nDirectors of the public buildings desiring I would have drawn for them\r\nplans of sundry buildings, and, in the first place, of a capital. They\r\nfixed; for their receiving this plan, a day which Was within about\r\nsix weeks of that on which their letter came to my hand. I engaged\r\nan architect of capital abilities in this business. Much time was\r\nrequisite, after the external form was agreed on, to make the internal\r\ndistribution convenient for the three branches of government. This time\r\nwas much lengthened by my avocations to other objects, which I had no\r\nright to neglect. The plan however Was settled. The gentlemen had\r\nsent me one which they had thought of. The one agreed on here is more\r\nconvenient, more beautiful, gives more room, and will not cost more than\r\ntwo thirds of what that would. We took for our model what is called the\r\n_Maison Quarrée_ (Nismes), one of the most beautiful, if not the most\r\nbeautiful and precious morsel of architecture left us by antiquity. It\r\nwas built by Caius and Lucius Cæsar, and repaired by Louis XIV., and\r\nhas the suffrage of all the judges of architecture who have seen it, as\r\nyielding to no one of the beautiful monuments of Greece, Rome, Palmyra,\r\nand Balbec, which late travellers have communicated to us. It is very\r\nsimple, but it is noble beyond expression, and would have done honor\r\nto our country, as presenting to travellers a specimen of taste in our\r\ninfancy, promising much for our maturer age. I have been much mortified\r\nwith information, which I received two days ago from Virginia, that the\r\nfirst brick of the Capitol would be laid within a few days. But surely,\r\nthe delay of this piece of a summer would have been repaired by\r\nthe savings in the plan preparing here, were we to value its other\r\nsuperiorities as nothing. But how is a taste in this beautiful art to\r\nbe formed in our countrymen, unless we avail ourselves of every occasion\r\nwhen public buildings are to be erected, of presenting to them models\r\nfor their study and imitation? Pray try if you can effect the slopping\r\nof this work. I have written also to E. R. on the subject. The loss will\r\nbe only of the laying the bricks already laid, or a part of them. The\r\nbricks themselves will do again for the interior walls, and one side\r\nwall and one end wall may remain, as they will answer equally well for\r\nour plan. This loss is not to be weighed against the saving of money\r\nwhich will arise, against the comfort of laying out the public money for\r\nsomething honorable, the satisfaction of seeing an object and proof\r\nof national good taste, and the regret and mortification of erecting a\r\nmonument of our barbarism, which will be loaded with execrations as long\r\nas it shall endure. The plans are in good forwardness, and I hope will\r\nbe ready within three or four weeks. They could not be stopped now,\r\nbut on paying their whole price, which will be considerable. If the\r\nundertakers are afraid to undo what they have done, encourage them to it\r\nby a recommendation from the Assembly. You see I am an enthusiast on the\r\nsubject of the arts. But it is an enthusiasm of which I am not ashamed,\r\nas its object is to improve the taste of my countrymen, to increase\r\ntheir reputation, to reconcile to them the respect of the world, and\r\nprocure them its praise.\r\n\r\nI shall send off your books, in two trunks, to Havre, within two or\r\nthree days, to the care of Mr. Limozin, American agent there. I will\r\nadvise you, as soon as I know by what vessel he forwards them. Adieu.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CX.--TO EDMUND RANDOLPH, September 20,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDMUND RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nParis, September 20,1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nBeing in your debt for ten volumes of Buffon, I have endeavored to\r\nfind something that would be agreeable to you to receive, in return. I\r\ntherefore send you, by way of Havre, a dictionary of law, natural and\r\nmunicipal, in thirteen volumes 4to, called _Le Code de l’Humanité_. It\r\nis published by Felice, but written by him and several other authors of\r\nestablished reputation. It is an excellent work. I do not mean to say,\r\nthat it answers fully to its title. That would have required fifty times\r\nthe volume. It wants many articles which the title would induce us to\r\nseek in it. But the articles which it contains are well written. It is\r\nbetter than the voluminous _Dictionnaire Diplomatique_, and better also\r\nthan the same branch of the _Encyclopédie Méthodigue_. There has been\r\nnothing published here, since I came, of extraordinary merit. The\r\n_Encyclopédie Méthodique_, which is coming out from time to time, must\r\nbe excepted from this. It is to be had at two guineas less than the\r\nsubscription price. I shall be happy to send you any thing in this way\r\nwhich you may desire. French books are to be bought here for two thirds\r\nof what they can in England. English and Greek and Latin authors cost\r\nfrom twenty-five to fifty per cent, more here than in England.\r\n\r\nI received, some time ago, a letter from Messrs. Hay and Buchanan, as\r\nDirectors of the public buildings, desiring I would have plans drawn for\r\nour public buildings, and in the first place for the capitol. I did not\r\nreceive their letter till within about six weeks of the time they\r\nhad fixed on for receiving the drawings. Nevertheless, I engaged an\r\nexcellent architect to comply with their desire. It has taken much\r\ntime to accommodate the external adopted, to the internal arrangement\r\nnecessary for the three branches of government. However, it is effected\r\non a plan, which, with a great deal of beauty and convenience within,\r\nunites an external form on the most perfect model of antiquity now\r\nexisting. This is the _Maison Quarrée_ of Nismes, built by Caius and\r\nLucius Cæsar, and repaired by Louis XIV., which, in the opinion of all\r\nwho have seen it, yields, in beauty, to no piece of architecture on\r\nearth. The gentlemen enclosed me a plan of which they had thought. The\r\none preparing here will be more convenient, give more room, and cost but\r\ntwo thirds of that: and as a piece of architecture, doing honor to our\r\ncountry, will leave nothing to be desired. The plans will be ready soon.\r\nBut, two days ago, I received a letter from Virginia, informing me\r\nthe first brick of the capitol would be laid within a few days. This\r\nmortifies my extremely. The delay of this summer would have been amply\r\nrepaid by the superiority and economy of the plan preparing here. Is it\r\nimpossible to stop the work where it is? You will gain money by losing\r\nwhat is done, and general approbation, instead of occasioning a regret,\r\nwhich will endure as long as your building does. How is a taste for a\r\nchaste and good style of building to be formed in our countrymen, unless\r\nwe seize all occasions which the erection of public buildings offers,\r\nof presenting to them models for their imitation? Do, my dear Sir, exert\r\nyour influence to stay the further progress of the work, till you can\r\nreceive these plans. You will only lose the price of laying what bricks\r\nare already laid, and of taking part of them asunder. They will do again\r\nfor the inner walls. A plan for a prison will be sent at the same time.\r\n\r\nMazzei is here, and in pressing distress for money. I have helped him as\r\nfar as I have been able, but particular circumstances put it out of my\r\npower to do more. He is looking with anxiety to the arrival of every\r\nvessel, in hopes of relief through your means. If he does not receive it\r\nsoon, it is difficult to foresee his fate.\r\n\r\nThe quiet which Europe enjoys at present, leaves nothing to communicate\r\nto you in the political way. The Emperor and Dutch still differ about\r\nthe quantum of money to be paid by the latter; they know not for what.\r\nPerhaps their internal convulsions will hasten them to a decision.\r\nFrance is improving her navy, as if she were already in a naval war: yet\r\nI see no immediate prospect of her having occasion for it. England is\r\nnot likely to offer war to any nation, unless, perhaps, to ours. This\r\nwould cost us our whole shipping: but in every other respect, we might\r\nflatter ourselves with success. But the most successful war seldom pays\r\nfor its losses. I shall be glad to hear from you when convenient, and\r\nam, with much esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXI.--TO JOHN ADAMS, September 24, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, September 24, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have received your favor of the 18th, enclosing your compliments on\r\nyour presentation. The sentiments you therein expressed, were such as\r\nwere entertained in America till the commercial proclamation, and such\r\nas would again return, were a rational conduct to be adopted by Great\r\nBritain. I think, therefore, you by no means compromitted yourself\r\nor our country, nor expressed more than it would be our interest to\r\nencourage, if they were disposed to meet us. I am pleased, however,\r\nto see the answer of the King. It bears the marks of suddenness and\r\nsurprise, and as he seems not to have had time for reflection, we may\r\nsuppose he was obliged to find his answer in the real sentiments of his\r\nheart if that heart has any sentiment. I have no doubt however that it\r\ncontains the real creed of an Englishman, and that the word which he\r\nhas let escape is the true word of the enigma. ‘The moment I see such\r\nsentiments as yours prevail, and a disposition to give this country\r\nthe preference, I will,’ &c. All this I steadfastly believe. But the\r\ncondition is impossible. Our interest calls for a perfect equality in\r\nour conduct towards these two nations; but no preferences any where.\r\nIf, however, circumstances should ever oblige us to show a preference,\r\na respect for our character, if we had no better motive, would decide to\r\nwhich it should be given.\r\n\r\nMy letters from members of Congress render it doubtful, whether\r\nthey would not rather that full time should be given for the present\r\ndisposition of America to mature itself, and to produce a permanent\r\nimprovement in the federal constitution, rather than, by removing the\r\nincentive, to prevent the improvement. It is certain that our commerce\r\nis in agonies at present, and that these would be relieved by opening\r\nthe British ports in the West Indies. It remains to consider, whether a\r\ntemporary continuance under these sufferings would be paid for, by the\r\namendment it is likely to produce. However, I believe there is no fear\r\nthat Great Britain will puzzle us, by leaving it in our choice to hasten\r\nor delay a treaty.\r\n\r\nIs insurance made on Houdon’s life? I am uneasy about it, lest we should\r\nhear of any accident. As yet there is no reason to doubt their safe\r\npassage. If the insurance is not made, I will pray you to have it done\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nAs I have not received any London newspapers as yet, I am obliged to\r\nask you what is done as to them, lest the delay should proceed from some\r\nobstacle to be removed.\r\n\r\nThere is a Mr. Thompson at Dover, who has proposed to me a method of\r\ngetting them post-free: but I have declined resorting to it, till I\r\nshould know in what train the matter is at present.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, September 24,1785\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, September 24,1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy letter of September the 19th, written the morning after Mr. Lambe’s\r\narrival here, will inform you of that circumstance. I transmit you\r\nherewith, copies of the papers he brought to us on the subject of the\r\nBarbary treaties. You will see by them, that Congress have adopted the\r\nvery plan which we were proposing to pursue. It will now go on with less\r\ndanger of objection from the other parties. The receipt of these new\r\npapers, therefore, has rendered necessary no change, in matter of\r\nsubstance, in the despatches we had prepared. But they render some\r\nformal changes necessary. For instance, in our letter of credence for\r\nMr. Barclay to the Emperor of Morocco, it becomes improper to enter\r\ninto those explanations which seemed proper when that letter was drawn;\r\nbecause Congress in their letter enter into those explanations. In the\r\nletter to the Count de Vergennes, it became proper to mention the new\r\nfull powers received from Congress, and which, in some measure, accord\r\nwith the idea communicated by him to us, from the Marechal de Castries.\r\nThese and other formal alterations, which appeared necessary to me,\r\nI have made, leaving so much of the original draughts, approved and\r\namended by you, as were not inconsistent with these alterations. I have\r\ntherefore had these prepared fair, to save you the trouble of copying;\r\nyet, wherever you choose to make alterations, you will be so good as to\r\nmake them; taking, in that case, the trouble of having new fair copies\r\nmade out.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by Mr. Jay’s letter, that Congress had not thought\r\nproper to give Mr. Lambe any appointment. I imagine they apprehended it\r\nmight interfere with measures actually taken by us. Notwithstanding the\r\nperfect freedom which they are pleased to leave to us, on this subject,\r\nI cannot feel myself clear of that bias, which a presumption of their\r\npleasure gives, and ought to give. I presume that Mr. Lambe met their\r\napprobation, because of the recommendations he carried from the Governor\r\nand State of Connecticut, because of his actual knowledge of the country\r\nand people of the States of Barbary, because of the detention of these\r\nletters from March to July, which, considering their pressing-nature,\r\nwould otherwise have been sent by other Americans, who, in the mean\r\ntime, have come from New York to Paris; and because, too, of the\r\ninformation we received by Mr. Jarvis. These reasons are not strong\r\nenough to set aside our appointment of Mr. Barclay to Morocco: that I\r\nthink should go on, as no man could be sent who would enjoy more the\r\nconfidence of Congress. But they are strong enough to induce me to\r\npropose to you the appointment of Lambe to Algiers. He has followed for\r\nmany years the Barbary trade, and seems intimately acquainted with those\r\nStates. I have not seen enough of him to judge of his abilities. He\r\nseems not deficient, as far as I can see, and the footing on which he\r\ncomes, must furnish a presumption for what we do not see. We must\r\nsay the same as to his integrity; we must rely for this on the\r\nrecommendations he brings, as it is impossible for us to judge of this\r\nfor ourselves. Yet it will be our duty to use such reasonable cautions\r\nas are in our power. Two occur to me. 1. To give him a clerk capable of\r\nassisting and attending to his proceedings, and who, in case he thought\r\nany thing was going amiss, might give us information. 2. Not to give him\r\na credit on Van Staphorst and Willinck, but let his drafts be made on\r\nyourself, which, with the knowledge you will have of his proceedings,\r\nwill enable you to check them, if you are sensible of any abuse\r\nintended. This will give you trouble; but as I have never found you\r\ndeclining trouble, when it is necessary, I venture to propose it. I\r\nhope it will not expose you to inconvenience, as by instructing Lambe to\r\ninsert in his drafts a proper usance, you can, in the mean time, raise\r\nthe money for them by drawing on Holland. I must inform you that Mr.\r\nBarclay wishes to be put on the same footing with Mr. Lambe, as to\r\nthis article, and therefore I return you your letter of credit on Van\r\nStaphorst &, Co. As to the first article, there is great difficulty.\r\nThere is nobody at Paris fit for the undertaking, who would be likely to\r\naccept it. I mean there is no American, for I should be anxious to place\r\na native in the trust. Perhaps you can send us one from London. There\r\nis a Mr. Randall there, from New York, whom Mr. Barclay thinks might be\r\nrelied on very firmly for integrity and capacity. He is there for his\r\nhealth; perhaps you can persuade him to go to Algiers in pursuit of it.\r\nIf you cannot, I really know not what will be done. It is impossible\r\nto propose to Bancroft to go in a secondary capacity. Mr. Barclay and\r\nmyself have thought of Cairnes, at L’Ori-ent, as a _dernier ressort_.\r\nBut it is uncertain, or rather improbable, that he will undertake it.\r\nYou will be pleased in the first place, to consider of my proposition\r\nto send Lambe to Algiers; and in the next, all the circumstances before\r\ndetailed, as consequences of that.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed letter from Richard O’Bryan furnishes powerful motives\r\nfor commencing, by some means or other, the treaty with Algiers,\r\nmore immediately than would be done, if left on Mr. Barclay. You will\r\nperceive by that, that two of our vessels, with their crews and cargoes,\r\nhave been carried captive into that port. What is to be done as to those\r\npoor people? I am for hazarding the supplementary instruction to Lambe,\r\nwhich accompanies these papers. Alter it, or reject it, as you please.\r\nYou ask what I think of claiming the Dutch interposition. I doubt the\r\nfidelity of any interposition too much to desire it sincerely. Our\r\nletters to this court, heretofore, seemed to oblige us to communicate\r\nwith them on the subject. If you think the Dutch would take amiss our\r\nnot applying to them, I will join you in the application. Otherwise, the\r\nfewer who are apprized of our proceedings, the better. To communicate\r\nthem to the States of Holland, is to communicate them to the whole\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nMr. Short returned last night, and brought the Prussian treaty, duly\r\nexecuted in English and French. We may send it to Congress by the Mr.\r\nFitzhughs going from hence. Will you draw and sign a short letter for\r\nthat purpose? I send you a copy of a letter received from the Marquis\r\nFayette. In the present unsettled state of American commerce, I had as\r\nlieve avoid all further treaties, except with American powers. If Count\r\nMerci, therefore, does not propose the subject to me, I shall not to\r\nhim, nor do more than decency requires, if he does propose it. I am,\r\nwith great esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIII.--TO F. HOPKINSON, September 25, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO F. HOPKINSON.\r\n\r\nParis, September 25, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of the 6th of July. Since that, I have received yours\r\nof July the 23rd. I do not altogether despair of making something of\r\nyour method of quilling, though, as yet, the prospect is not favorable.\r\nI applaud much your perseverance in improving this instrument, and\r\nbenefiting mankind almost in spite of their teeth. I mentioned to\r\nPiccini the improvement with which I am entrusted. He plays on the\r\npiano-forte, and therefore did not feel himself personally interested.\r\nI hope some better opportunity will yet fall in my way of doing it\r\njustice. I had almost decided, on his advice, to get a piano-forte for\r\nmy daughter; but your last letter may pause me, till I see its effect.\r\n\r\nArts and arms are alike asleep for the moment. Ballooning indeed goes\r\non. There are two artists in the neighborhood of Paris, who seem to be\r\nadvancing towards the _desideratum_ in this business. They are able\r\nto rise and fall at will, without expending their gas, and to deflect\r\nforty-five degrees from the course of the wind.\r\n\r\nI desired you in my last to send the newspapers, notwithstanding the\r\nexpense. I had then no idea of it. Some late instances have made me\r\nperfectly acquainted with it. I have therefore been obliged to adopt\r\nthe following plan. To have my newspapers, from the different States,\r\nenclosed to the office for Foreign Affairs, and to desire Mr. Jay to\r\npack the whole in a box, and send it by the packet as merchandise,\r\ndirected to the American consul at L’Orient, who will forward it to\r\nme by the periodical wagons. In this way they will only cost me livres\r\nwhere they now cost me guineas, I must pray you, just before the\r\ndeparture of every French packet, to send my papers on hand to Mr. Jay,\r\nin this way. I do not know whether I am subject to American postage\r\nor not, in general; but I think newspapers never are. I have sometimes\r\nthought of sending a copy of my Notes to the Philosophical Society, as\r\na tribute due to them: but this would seem as if I considered them as\r\nworth something, which I am conscious they are not. I will not ask you\r\nfor your advice on this occasion, because it is one of those on which no\r\nman is authorized to ask a sincere opinion. I shall therefore refer it\r\nto further thoughts.\r\n\r\nI am, with very sincere esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIV.--TO LISTER ASQUITH, September 26,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LISTER ASQUITH.\r\n\r\nParis, September 26,1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have received your letter of September the 19th, with your log-book\r\nand other papers. I now wait for the letter from your lawyer, as, till I\r\nknow the real nature and state of your process, it is impossible for me\r\nto judge what can be done for you here. As soon as I receive them, you\r\nshall hear from me. In the mean time, I supposed it would be a comfort\r\nto you to know that your papers had come safe to hand, and that I shall\r\nbe attentive to do whatever circumstances will admit.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your very humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXV.--TO R. IZARD, September 26,1783\r\n\r\n\r\nTO R. IZARD.\r\n\r\nParis, September 26,1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received, a few days ago, your favor of the 10th of June, and am\r\nto thank you for the trouble you have given yourself, to procure me\r\ninformation on the subject of the commerce of your State. I pray you,\r\nalso, to take the trouble of expressing my acknowledgments to the\r\nGovernor and Chamber of Commerce, as well as to Mr. Hall, for the very\r\nprecise details on this subject, with which they have been pleased to\r\nhonor me. Your letter of last January, of which you make mention, never\r\ncame to my hands. Of course, the papers now received are the first and\r\nonly ones which have come safe. The infidelities of the post-offices,\r\nboth of England and France, are not unknown to you. The former are the\r\nmost rascally, because they retain one’s letters, not choosing to take\r\nthe trouble of copying them. The latter, when they have taken copies,\r\nare so civil as to send the originals, re-sealed clumsily with a\r\ncomposition, on which they had previously taken the impression of the\r\nseal. England shows no dispositions to enter into friendly connections\r\nwith us. On the contrary, her detention of our posts, seems to be the\r\nspeck which is to produce a storm. I judge that a war with America would\r\nbe a popular war in England. Perhaps the situation of Ireland may deter\r\nthe ministry from hastening it on. Peace is at length made between the\r\nEmperor and Dutch. The terms are not published, but it is said he gets\r\nten millions of florins, the navigation of the Scheldt not quite to\r\nAntwerp, and two forts. However, this is not to be absolutely relied on.\r\nThe league formed by the King of Prussia against the Emperor is a most\r\nformidable obstacle to his ambitious designs. It certainly has defeated\r\nhis views on Bavaria, and will render doubtful the election of his\r\nnephew to be King of the Romans. Matters are not yet settled between him\r\nand the Turk. In truth, he undertakes too much. At home he has made some\r\ngood regulations.\r\n\r\nYour present pursuit being (the wisest of all) agriculture, I am not in\r\na situation to be useful to it. You know that France is not the country\r\nmost celebrated for this art. I went the other day to see a plough which\r\nwas to be worked by a windlass, without horses or oxen. It was a poor\r\naffair. With a very troublesome apparatus, applicable only to a\r\ndead level, four men could do the work of two horses. There seems a\r\npossibility that the great _desideratum_ in the use of the balloon may\r\nbe obtained. There are two persons at Javel (opposite to Auteuil) who\r\nare pushing this matter. They are able to rise and fall at will, without\r\nexpending their gas, and they can deflect forty-five degrees from the\r\ncourse of the wind.\r\n\r\nI took the liberty of asking you to order me a Charleston newspaper.\r\nThe expense of French postage is so enormous that I have been obliged to\r\ndesire that my newspapers, from the different States, may be sent to the\r\noffice for Foreign Affairs at New York; and I have requested of Mr. Jay\r\nto have them always packed in a box, and sent by the French packets as\r\nmerchandise to the care of the American consul at L’Orient, who will\r\nsend them on by the periodical wagons. Will you permit me to add this\r\nto the trouble I have before given you, of ordering the printer to send\r\nthem under cover to Mr. Jay, by such opportunities by water, as occur\r\nfrom time to time. This request must go to the acts of your Assembly\r\nalso. I shall be on the watch to send you any thing that may appear\r\nhere on the subjects of agriculture or the arts, which may be worth your\r\nperusal, I sincerely congratulate Mrs. Izard and yourself on the double\r\naccession to your family by marriage and a new birth. My daughter values\r\nmuch your remembrance of her, and prays to have her respects presented\r\nto the ladies and yourself. In this I join her, and shall embrace with\r\npleasure every opportunity of assuring you of the sincere esteem, with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, Dear Sir, your most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVI.--TO RICHARD O’BRYAN, September 29, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD O’BRYAN.\r\n\r\nParis, September 29, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have received your letter, and shall exert myself for you. Be assured\r\nof hearing from me soon: but say nothing to any body, except what may be\r\nnecessary to comfort your companions. I add no more, because the fate of\r\nthis letter is uncertain. I am, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour very humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVII.--TO MR. BELLINI, September 30,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BELLINI.\r\n\r\nParis, September 30,1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour estimable favor, covering a letter to Mr. Mazzei, came to hand on\r\nthe 26th instant. The letter to Mr. Mazzei was put into his hands in the\r\nsame moment, as he happened to be present. I leave to him to convey to\r\nyou all his complaints, as it will be more agreeable to me to express\r\nto you the satisfaction I received, on being informed of your perfect\r\nhealth. Though I could not receive the same pleasing news of Mrs.\r\nBellini, yet the philosophy, with which I am told she bears the loss of\r\nhealth, is a testimony the more, how much she deserved the esteem I\r\nbear her. Behold me at length on the vaunted scene of Europe! It is\r\nnot necessary for your information, that I should enter into details\r\nconcerning it. But you are, perhaps, curious to know how this new scene\r\nhas struck a savage of the mountains of America. Not advantageously, I\r\nassure you. I find the general fate of humanity here most deplorable.\r\nThe truth of Voltaire’s observation offers itself perpetually, that\r\nevery man here must be either the hammer or the anvil. It is a true\r\npicture of that country to which they say we shall pass hereafter, and\r\nwhere we are to see God and his angels in splendor, and crowds of the\r\ndamned trampled under their feet. While the great mass of the people are\r\nthus suffering under physical and moral oppression, I have endeavored to\r\nexamine more nearly the condition of the great, to appreciate the true\r\nvalue of the circumstances in their situation which dazzle the bulk of\r\nspectators, and, especially, to compare it with that degree of happiness\r\nwhich is enjoyed in America by every class of people. Intrigues of love\r\noccupy the younger, and those of ambition the elder part of the great.\r\nConjugal love having no existence among them, domestic happiness,\r\nof which that is the basis, is utterly unknown. In lieu of this, are\r\nsubstituted pursuits which nourish and invigorate all our bad passions,\r\nand which offer only moments of ecstacy, amidst days and months of\r\nrestlessness and torment. Much, very much inferior, this, to the\r\ntranquil, permanent felicity, with which domestic society in America\r\nblesses most of its inhabitants; leaving them to follow steadily those\r\npursuits which health and reason approve, and rendering truly delicious\r\nthe intervals of those pursuits.\r\n\r\nIn science, the mass of the people is two centuries behind ours; their\r\nliterati, half a dozen years before us. Books, really good, acquire just\r\nreputation in that time, and so become known to us, and communicate to\r\nus all their advances in knowledge. Is not this delay compensated,\r\nby our being placed out of the reach of that swarm of nonsensical\r\npublications, which issues daily from a thousand presses, and perishes\r\nalmost in issuing? With respect to what are termed polite manners,\r\nwithout sacrificing too much the sincerity of language, I would wish my\r\ncountrymen to adopt just so much of European politeness, as to be\r\nready to make all those little sacrifices of self, which really render\r\nEuropean manners amiable, and relieve society from the disagreeable\r\nscenes to which rudeness often subjects it. Here, it seems that a\r\nman might pass a life without encountering a single rudeness. In the\r\npleasures of the table they are far before us, because with good taste\r\nthey unite temperance. They do not terminate the most sociable meals by\r\ntransforming themselves into brutes. I have never yet seen a man drunk\r\nin France, even among the lowest of the people. Were I to proceed to\r\ntell you how much I enjoy their architecture, sculpture, painting,\r\nmusic, I should want words. It is in these arts they shine. The last of\r\nthem, particularly, is an enjoyment, the deprivation of which with us\r\ncannot be calculated. I am almost ready to say, it is the only thing\r\nwhich from my heart I envy them, and which, in spite of all the\r\nauthority of the Decalogue, I do covet. But I am running on in an\r\nestimate of things infinitely better known to you than to me, and which\r\nwill only serve to convince you, that I have brought with me all the\r\nprejudices of country, habit, and age. But whatever I may allow to\r\nbe charged to me as prejudice, in every other instance, I have one\r\nsentiment at least founded on reality: it is that of the perfect esteem\r\nwhich your merit and that of Mrs. Bellini have produced, and which will\r\nfor ever enable me to assure you of the sincere regard with which I am,\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVIII.--JAMES MADISON, October 2, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON, of William and Mary College.\r\n\r\nParis, October 2, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received your favor of April the 10th, by Mr. Mazzei. You\r\ntherein speak of a new method of raising water by steam, which you\r\nsuppose will come into general use. I know of no new method of that\r\nkind, and suppose (as you say that the account you have received of it\r\nis very imperfect) that some person has represented to you, as new, a\r\nfire-engine erected at Paris, and which supplies the greater part of the\r\ntown with water. But this is nothing more than the fire-engine you\r\nhave seen described in the books of hydraulics, and particularly in the\r\nDictionary of Arts and Sciences, published in 8vo, by Owen, the idea of\r\nwhich was first taken from Papin’s Digester. It would have been better\r\ncalled the steam-engine. The force of the steam of water, you know, is\r\nimmense. In this-engine it is made to exert itself towards the working\r\nof pumps. That of Paris is, I believe, the largest known, raising four\r\nhundred thousand cubic feet (French) of water, in twenty-four hours; or\r\nrather I should have said, those of Paris, for there are two under one\r\nroof, each raising that quantity.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Rochon not living at Paris, I have not had an opportunity of\r\nseeing him, and of asking him the questions you desire, relative to\r\nthe crystal of which I wrote you. I shall avail myself of the earliest\r\nopportunity I can, of doing it. I shall cheerfully execute your commands\r\nas to the _Encyclopédie_, when I receive them. The price will be only\r\nthirty guineas. About half the work is out. The volumes of your Buffon,\r\nwhich are spoiled, can be replaced here.\r\n\r\nI expect that this letter will be carried by the Mr. Fitzhughs, in\r\na ship from Havre to Portsmouth. I have therefore sent to Havre some\r\nbooks, which I expected would be acceptable to you. These are the\r\n_Bibliothèque Physico-oeconomique_, which will give you most of the\r\nlate improvements in the arts; the _Connoissance des Terns_ for 1786 and\r\n1787, which is as late as they are published; and some pieces on air and\r\nfire, wherein you will find all the discoveries hitherto made on these\r\nsubjects. These books are made into a packet, with your address on\r\nthem, and are put into a trunk wherein is a small packet for Mr. Wythe,\r\nanother for Mr. Page, and a parcel of books, without direction, for\r\nPeter Carr. I have taken the liberty of directing the trunk to you, as\r\nthe surest means of its getting safe. I pay the freight of it here, so\r\nthat there will be no new demands, but for the transportation from the\r\nship’s side to Williamsburg, which I will pray you to pay; and as much\r\nthe greatest part is for my nephew, I will take care to repay it to you.\r\n\r\nIn the last volume of the _Connoissance des Terns_, you will find the\r\ntables for the planet Herschel. It is a curious circumstance, that this\r\nplanet was seen thirty years ago by Mayer, and supposed by him to be a\r\nfixed star. He accordingly determined a place for it, in his catalogue\r\nof the zodiacal stars, making it the 964th of that catalogue. Bode,\r\nof Berlin, observed in 1781, that this star was missing. Subsequent\r\ncalculations of the motion of the planet Herschel show, that it must\r\nhave been, at the time of Mayer’s observation, where he had placed his\r\n964th star.\r\n\r\nHerschel has pushed his discoveries of double stars, now, to upwards\r\nof nine hundred, being twice the number of those communicated in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions. You have probably seen, that a Mr. Pigott\r\nhad discovered periodical variations of light in the star Algol. He\r\nhas observed the same in the _n_ of Antinous, and makes the period of\r\nvariation seven days, four hours, and thirty minutes, the duration of\r\nthe increase sixty-three hours, and of the decrease thirty-six hours.\r\nWhat are we to conclude from this? That there are suns which have their\r\norbits of revolution too? But this would suppose a wonderful harmony\r\nin their planets, and present a new scene, where the attracting powers\r\nshould be without, and not within the orbit. The motion of our sun would\r\nbe a miniature of this. But this must be left to you astronomers.\r\n\r\nI went some time ago to see a machine, which offers something new. A man\r\nhad applied to a light boat, a very large screw, the thread of which was\r\na thin plate, two feet broad, applied by its edge spirally round a small\r\naxis. It somewhat resembled a bottle-brush, if you will suppose the\r\nhairs of the bottle-brush joining together, and forming a spiral plane.\r\nThis, turned on its axis in the air, carried the vessel across the\r\nSeine. It is, in fact, a screw which takes hold of the air and draws\r\nitself along by it: losing, indeed, much of its effort by the yielding\r\nnature of the body it lays hold of, to pull itself on by. I think it\r\nmay be applied in the water with much greater effect, and to very useful\r\npurposes Perhaps it may be used also for the balloon.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible but you must have heard long ago of the machine for\r\ncopying letters at a single stroke, as we had received it in America\r\nbefore I left there. I have written a long letter to my nephew, in whose\r\neducation I feel myself extremely interested. I shall rely much on your\r\nfriendship for conducting him in the plan I mark out for him, and for\r\nguarding him against those shoals, on which youth sometimes shipwreck. I\r\ntrouble you to present to Mr. Wythe my affectionate remembrance of him,\r\nand am with very great esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIX.--TO DR. FRANKLIN, October 5,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\nParis, October 5,1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nA vessel sailing from Havre to Philadelphia, furnishes the Messrs.\r\nFitzhughs with a passage to that place. To them, therefore, I confide a\r\nnumber of letters and packets which I have received for you from sundry\r\nquarters, and which, I doubt not, they will deliver safe. Among these is\r\none from M. Du Plessis. On receipt of your letter, in answer to the\r\none I had written you, on the subject of his memorial, I sent to M. La\r\nMotte, M. Chaumont, and wherever else I thought there was a probability\r\nof finding out Du Plessis’ address. But all in vain. I meant to examine\r\nhis memoir, as you desired, and to have it copied. Lately, he came and\r\nbrought it with him, copied by himself. He desired me to read it, and\r\nenclose it to you, which I have done.\r\n\r\nWe have no public news worth communicating to you, but the signing of\r\npreliminaries between the Emperor and Dutch. The question is, then, with\r\nwhom the Emperor will pick the next quarrel. Our treaty with Prussia\r\ngoes by this conveyance. But it is not to be spoken of till a convenient\r\ntime is allowed for exchanging ratifications.\r\n\r\nScience offers nothing new since your departure, nor any new publication\r\nworth your notice. All your friends here are well. Those in England\r\nhave carried you captive to Algiers. They have published a letter, as\r\nif written by Truxen, the 20th of August, from Algiers, stating\r\nthe circumstances of the capture, and that you bore your slavery to\r\nadmiration. I happened to receive a letter from Algiers, dated August\r\nthe 24th, informing me that two vessels were then there, taken from us,\r\nand naming the vessels and captains. This was a satisfactory proof to\r\nus, that you were not there. The fact being so, we would have gladly\r\ndispensed with the proof, as the situation of our countrymen there was\r\ndescribed as very distressing.\r\n\r\nWere I to mention all those who make inquiries after you, there would be\r\nno end to my letter. I cannot, however, pass over those of the good old\r\nCountess d’Hoditot, with whom I dined on Saturday, at Sanois. They were\r\nvery affectionate. I hope you have had a good passage. Your essay in\r\ncrossing the channel gave us great hopes you would experience little\r\ninconvenience on the rest of the voyage. My wishes place you in the\r\nbosom of your friends, in good health, and with a well grounded prospect\r\nof preserving it long, for your own sake, for theirs, and that of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nI am, with the sincerest attachment and respect, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXX.--TO SAMUEL OSGOOD, October 5, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL OSGOOD.\r\n\r\nParis, October 5, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIt was with very sincere pleasure I heard of your appointment to\r\nthe board of treasury, as well from the hope that it might not\r\nbe disagreeable to yourself, as from the confidence that your\r\nadministration would be wise. I heartily wish the States may, by their\r\ncontributions, enable you to re-establish a credit, which cannot be\r\nlower than at present, to exist at all. This is partly owing to their\r\nreal deficiencies, and partly to the lies propagated by the London\r\npapers, which are probably paid for by the minister, to reconcile the\r\npeople to the loss of us. Unluckily, it indisposes them, at the same\r\ntime, to form rational connections with us. Should this produce the\r\namendment of our federal constitution, of which your papers give us\r\nhopes, we shall receive a permanent indemnification for a temporary\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nAll things here promise an arrangement between the Emperor and Dutch.\r\nTheir ministers have signed preliminary articles, some of which,\r\nhowever, leave room for further cavil. The Dutch pay ten millions of\r\nflorins, yield some forts and territory, and the navigation of the\r\nScheldt to Saftingen. Till our treaty with England be fully executed,\r\nit is desirable to us, that all the world should be in peace. That done,\r\ntheir wars would do us little harm.\r\n\r\nI find myself under difficulties here, which I will take the liberty of\r\nexplaining to you as a friend. Mr. Carmichael lately drew a bill on\r\nMr. Grand for four thousand livres, I suppose for his salary. Mr.\r\nGrand said, he was not used to accept drafts but by the desire of Dr.\r\nFranklin, and rested it on me to say, whether this bill should be paid\r\nor not. I thought it improper, that the credit of so confidential\r\na person, as Mr. Carmichael, should be affected by a refusal, and\r\ntherefore advised payment. Mr. Dumas has drawn on me for twenty-seven\r\nhundred livres, his half year’s salary, informing me he always drew on\r\nDr. Franklin. I shall advise the payment. I have had loan-office bills,\r\ndrawn on the commissioners of the United States, presented to me. My\r\nanswer has been, ‘These are very old bills. Had they been presented\r\nwhile those gentlemen were in Europe, they would have been paid. You\r\nhave kept them up till Dr. Franklin, the last of them, has returned to\r\nAmerica; you must therefore send them there, and they will be paid. I am\r\nnot the drawee described in the bill.’ It is impossible for me to meddle\r\nwith these bills. The gentlemen who had been familiar with them, from\r\nthe beginning, who kept books of them, and knew well the form of these\r\nbooks, often paid bills twice. But how can I interfere with them,\r\nwho have not a scrip of a pen on their subject, who never saw a book\r\nrelating to them, and who, if I had the books, should much oftener be\r\nbewildered in the labyrinth, than the gentlemen who have kept them? I\r\nthink it, therefore, most advisable, that what bills remain out, should\r\nbe sent back to America for payment, and therefore advise Mr. Barclay to\r\nreturn thither all the books and papers relative to them. There, is the\r\nproper and ultimate deposite of all records of this nature. All\r\nthese articles are very foreign to my talents, and foreign also, as I\r\nconceive, to the nature of my duties. Dr. Franklin was obliged to meddle\r\nwith them, from the circumstances which existed. But, these having\r\nceased, I suppose it practicable for your board to direct the\r\nadministration of your monies here, in every circumstance. It is only\r\nnecessary for me to draw my own allowances, and to order payment for\r\nservices done by others, by my direction, and within the immediate line\r\nof my office; such as paying couriers, postage, and other extraordinary\r\nservices, which must rest on my discretion, and at my risk, if\r\ndisapproved by Congress. I will thank you for your advice on this\r\nsubject, and if you think a resolution of your board necessary, I will\r\npray you to send me such a one, and that it may relieve me from all\r\nconcerns with the money of the United States, other than those I have\r\njust spoken of. I do not mean by this to testify a disposition to render\r\nno service but what is rigorously within my duty. I am the farthest in\r\nthe world from this; it is a question I shall never ask myself; nothing\r\nmaking me more happy than to render any service in my power of whatever\r\ndescription. But I wish only to be excused from intermeddling in\r\nbusiness, in which I have no skill, and should do more harm than good.\r\n\r\nCongress were pleased to order me an advance of two quarters’ salary. At\r\nthat time, I supposed that I might refund it, or spare so much from my\r\nexpenses, by the time the third quarter became due. Probably, they might\r\nexpect the same. But it has been impossible. The expense of my outfit,\r\nthough I have taken it up on a scale as small as could be admitted, has\r\nbeen very far beyond what I had conceived. I have, therefore, not only\r\nbeen unable to refund the advance ordered, but been obliged to go beyond\r\nit. I wished to have avoided so much, as was occasioned by the purchase\r\nof furniture. But those who hire furniture, asked me forty per cent,\r\na year for the use of it. It was better to buy, therefore; and this\r\narticle, clothes, carriage, &c. have amounted to considerably more than\r\nthe advance ordered. Perhaps it may be thought reasonable to allow me an\r\noutfit. The usage of every other nation has established this, and reason\r\nreally pleads for it. I do not wish to make a shilling; but only my\r\nexpenses to be defrayed, and in a moderate style. On the most moderate,\r\nwhich the reputation or interest of those I serve would admit, it will\r\ntake me several years to liquidate the advances for my outfit. I mention\r\nthis, to enable you to understand the necessities which have obliged me\r\nto call for more money than was probably expected, and, understanding\r\nthem, to explain them to others. Being perfectly disposed to conform\r\nmyself decisively to what shall be thought proper, you cannot oblige me\r\nmore, than by communicating to me your sentiments hereon, which I shall\r\nreceive as those of a friend, and govern myself accordingly.\r\n\r\nI am, with the most perfect esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXI.--TO JOHN JAY, October 6, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, October 6, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nMy letter of August the 30th acknowledged the receipt of yours of July\r\nthe 13th. Since that, I have received your letter of August the 13th,\r\nenclosing a correspondence between the Marquis de la Fayette and\r\nMonsieur de Calonne, and another of the same date, enclosing the papers\r\nin Fortin’s case. I immediately wrote to M. Limozin, at Havre, desiring\r\nhe would send me a state of the case, and inform me what were the\r\ndifficulties which suspended its decision. He has promised me, by\r\nletter, to do this as soon as possible, and I shall not fail in\r\nattention to it.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and Dutch have signed preliminaries, which are now made\r\npublic. You will see them in the papers which accompany this. They still\r\nleave a good deal to discussion. However, it is probable they will end\r\nin peace. The party in Holland, possessed actually of the sovereignty,\r\nwish for peace, that they may push their designs on the Stadtholderate.\r\nThis country wishes for peace, because her finances need arrangement.\r\nThe Bavarian exchange has produced to public view that jealousy and.\r\nrancor between the courts of Vienna and Berlin, which existed before,\r\nthough it was smothered. This will appear by the declarations of the two\r\ncourts. The demarcation between the Emperor and Turk does not advance.\r\nStill, however, I suppose neither of those two germs of war likely to\r\nopen soon. I consider the conduct of France as the best evidence of\r\nthis. If she had apprehended a war from either of those quarters, she\r\nwould not have been so anxious to leave the Emperor one enemy the less,\r\nby placing him at peace with the Dutch. While she is exerting all\r\nher powers to preserve peace by land, and making no preparation which\r\nindicates a fear of its being disturbed in that quarter, she is pushing\r\nher naval preparations, with a spirit unexampled in time of peace.\r\nBy the opening of the next spring, she will have eighty ships, of\r\nseventy-four guns and upwards, ready for sea at a moment’s warning; and\r\nthe further constructions proposed, will probably, within two years,\r\nraise the number to an hundred. New regulations have been made, too,\r\nfor perfecting the classification of her seamen; an institution, which,\r\ndividing all the seamen of the nation into classes, subjects them to\r\ntours of duty by rotation and enables government, at all times, to man\r\ntheir ships. Their works for rendering Cherbourg a harbor for their\r\nvessels of war, and Dunkirk, for frigates and privateers, leave now\r\nlittle doubt of success. It is impossible that these preparations can\r\nhave in view any other nation than the English. Of course, they show a\r\ngreater diffidence of their peace with them, than with any other power.\r\n\r\nI mentioned to you, in my letter of August the 14th, that I had desired\r\nCaptain John Paul Jones to inquire into the circumstances of Peyrouse’s\r\nexpedition. I have now the honor of enclosing you copies of my letter to\r\nhim, and of his answer. He refuses to accept of any indemnification for\r\nhis expenses, which is an additional proof of his disinterested spirit,\r\nand of his devotion to the service of America. The circumstances are\r\nobvious, which indicate an intention to settle factories, and not\r\ncolonies, at least, for the present. However, nothing shows for what\r\nplace they are destined. The conjectures are divided between New\r\nHolland, and the northwest coast of America.\r\n\r\nAccording to what I mentioned in my letter of August the 30th, I have\r\nappointed Mr. Short my secretary here. I enclose to you copies of my\r\nletters to him and Mr. Grand, which will show to Congress that he stands\r\naltogether at their pleasure. I mention this circumstance, that if what\r\nI have done meets with their disapprobation, they may have the goodness\r\nto signify it immediately, as I should otherwise conclude that they do\r\nnot disapprove it. I shall be ready to conform myself to what would be\r\nmost agreeable to them.\r\n\r\nThis will be accompanied by the gazettes of France and Ley-den, to the\r\npresent date.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXII.--TO ELBRIDGE GERRY, October 11, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\nParis, October 11, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received, last night, the letter signed by yourself and the other\r\ngentlemen, delegates of Massachusetts and Virginia, recommending Mr.\r\nSayre for the Barbary negotiations. As that was the first moment of its\r\nsuggestion to me, you will perceive by my letter of this day, to Mr Jay,\r\nthat the business was already established in other hands, as your letter\r\ncame at the same time with the papers actually signed by Mr. Adams, for\r\nMessrs. Barclay and Lambe, according to arrangements previously taken\r\nbetween us. I should, with great satisfaction, have acceded to the\r\nrecommendation in the letter: not indeed as to Morocco, because, no\r\nbetter man than Mr. Barclay could have been substituted; but as to\r\nAlgiers, Mr. Lambe being less known to me. However, I hope well of him,\r\nand rely considerably on the aid he will receive from his secretary, Mr.\r\nRandall, who bears a very good character. I suppose Mr. Adams entitled\r\nto the same just apology, as matters were settled otherwise, before he\r\nprobably received your letter. I pray you to communicate this to the\r\nother gentlemen of your and our delegation as my justification.\r\n\r\nThe peace made between the Emperor and Dutch, leaves Europe quiet for\r\nthis campaign. As yet, we do not know where the storm, dissipated for\r\nthe moment, will gather again. Probably over Bavaria or Turkey. But this\r\nwill be for another year.\r\n\r\nWhen our instructions were made out, they were conceived on a general\r\nscale, and supposed that all the European nations would be disposed to\r\nform commercial connections with us. It is evident, however, that a very\r\ndifferent degree of importance was annexed to these different states.\r\nSpain, Portugal, England, and France, were most important. Holland,\r\nSweden, Denmark, in a middling degree. The others, still less so. Spain\r\ntreats in another line. Portugal is disposed to do the same. England\r\nwill not treat at all; nor will France, probably, add to her former\r\ntreaty. Failing in the execution of these our capital objects, it has\r\nappeared to me, that the pushing the treaties with the lesser powers,\r\nmight do us more harm than good, by hampering the measures the States\r\nmay find it necessary to take, for securing those commercial interests,\r\nby separate measures, which is refused to be done here, in concert. I\r\nhave understood through various channels, that the members of Congress\r\nwished a change in our instructions. I have, in my letter to Mr. Jay, of\r\nthis date, mentioned the present situation and aspect of these treaties,\r\nfor their information.\r\n\r\nMy letter of the 6th instant to Mr. Jay, having communicated what little\r\nthere is new here, I have only to add assurances of the sincere esteem,\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIII.--TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES, October 11, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.\r\n\r\nParis, October 11, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have the honor of enclosing to your Excellency, a report of the voyage\r\nof an American ship, the first which has gone to China. The circumstance\r\nwhich induces Congress to direct this communication, is the very\r\nfriendly conduct of the consul of his Majesty at Macao, and of the\r\ncommanders and other officers of the French vessels in those seas. It\r\nhas been with singular satisfaction, that Congress have seen these added\r\nto the many other proofs of the cordiality of this nation towards our\r\ncitizens. It is the more pleasing, when it appears in the officers of\r\ngovernment, because it is then viewed as an emanation of the spirit of\r\nthe government. It would be an additional gratification to Congress, in\r\nthis particular instance, should any occasion arise of notifying\r\nthose officers, that their conduct has been justly represented to\r\nyour Excellency, on the part of the United States, and has met\r\nyour approbation. Nothing will be wanting, on our part, to foster\r\ncorresponding dispositions in our citizens, and we hope that proofs\r\nof their actual existence have appeared, and will appear, whenever,\r\noccasion shall offer. A sincere affection between the two people, is the\r\nbroadest basis on which their peace can be built.\r\n\r\nIt will always be among the most pleasing functions of my office, to\r\nbe made the channel of communicating the friendly sentiments of the two\r\ngovernments. It is additionally so, as it gives me an opportunity of\r\nassuring your Excellency of the high respect and esteem, with which I\r\nhave the honor to be,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIV.--TO JOHN JAY, October 11,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nParis, October 11,1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn my letter of August the 14th, I had the honor of expressing to you\r\nthe uneasiness I felt at the delay of the instructions on the subject\r\nof the Barbary treaties, of which Mr.. Lambe was the bearer, and of\r\ninforming you that I had proposed to Mr. Adams, that if he did not\r\narrive either in the French or English packets, then expected, we should\r\nsend some person to negotiate these treaties. As he did not arrive in\r\nthose packets, and I found Mr. Barclay was willing to undertake the\r\nnegotiations, I wrote to Mr. Adams (who had concurred in the proposition\r\nmade him), informing him that Mr. Barclay would go, and proposing papers\r\nfor our immediate signature. The day before the return of the courier,\r\nMr. Lambe arrived with our instructions, the letters of credence, he\r\nenclosed in yours of March the 11th, 1785. Just about the same time,\r\ncame to hand the letter No. 1, informing me, that two American vessels\r\nwere actually taken and carried into Algiers, and leaving no further\r\ndoubt that that power was exercising hostilities against us in the\r\nAtlantic. The conduct of the Emperor of Morocco had been such, as\r\nforbade us to postpone his treaty to that with Algiers. But the\r\ncommencement of hostilities by the latter, and their known activity,\r\npressed the necessity of immediate propositions to them. It was\r\ntherefore thought best, while Mr. Barclay should be proceeding with the\r\nEmperor of Morocco, that some other agent should go to Algiers. We had\r\nfew subjects to choose out of. Mr. Lambe’s knowledge of the country,\r\nof its inhabitants, of their manner of transacting business, the\r\nrecommendations from his State to Congress, of his fitness for this\r\nemployment, and other information founding a presumption that he would\r\nbe approved, occasioned our concluding to send him to Algiers. The\r\ngiving him proper authorities, and new ones to Mr. Barclay conformable\r\nto our own new powers, was the subject of a new courier between Mr.\r\nAdams and myself. He returned last night, and I have the honor of\r\nenclosing you copies of all the papers we furnish those gentlemen with;\r\nwhich will possess Congress fully of our proceedings herein. They are\r\nnumbered from two to ten inclusive. The supplementary instruction to Mr.\r\nLambe, No. 5, must rest for justification on the emergency of the case.\r\nThe motives which led to it, must be found in the feelings of the human\r\nheart, in a partiality for those sufferers who are of our own country,\r\nand in the obligations of every government to yield protection to their\r\ncitizens, as the consideration for their obedience. It will be a comfort\r\nto know, that Congress does not disapprove this step.\r\n\r\nConsidering the treaty with Portugal among the most interesting to the\r\nUnited States, I some time ago, took occasion at Versailles, to ask\r\nof the Portuguese ambassador, if he had yet received from his court an\r\nanswer to our letter. He told me he had not, but that he would make\r\nit the subject of another letter. Two days ago, his _secrétaire\r\nd’ambassade_ called on me, with a letter from his minister to the\r\nambassador, in which was the following paragraph, as he translated it to\r\nme; and I committed it to writing from his mouth. ‘Your Excellency has\r\ncommunicated to us the substance of your conversation with the American\r\nminister. That power ought to have been already persuaded, by the manner\r\nin which its vessels have been received here; and consequently that his\r\nMajesty would have much satisfaction in maintaining perfect harmony and\r\ngood understanding with the same United States. But it would be proper\r\nto begin with the reciprocal nomination, on both sides, of persons, who,\r\nat least with the character of agents, might reciprocally inform their\r\nconstituents, of what might conduce to a knowledge of the interests of\r\nthe two nations, without prejudice to either. This first step appears\r\nnecessary to lead to the proposed object.’\r\n\r\nBy this, it would seem, that this power is more disposed to pursue a\r\ntrack of negotiation, similar to that which Spain has done. I consider\r\nthis answer as definitive of all further measures, under our commission\r\nto Portugal. That to Spain was superseded by proceedings in another\r\nline. That to Prussia is concluded by actual treaty; to Tuscany will\r\nprobably be so; and perhaps to Denmark: and these, I believe, will\r\nbe the sum of the effects of our commissions for making treaties of\r\nalliance. England shows no disposition to treat. France, should her\r\nministers be able to keep the ground of the _Arrêt_ of August, 1784,\r\nagainst the clamors of her merchants, and should they be disposed,\r\nhereafter, to give us more, very probably will not bind herself to it by\r\ntreaty, but keep her regulations dependent on her own will. Sweden will\r\nestablish a free port at St. Bartholomew’s, which, perhaps, will render\r\nany new engagement, on our part, unnecessary. Holland is so immovable\r\nin her system of colony administration, that, as propositions to her, on\r\nthat subject, would be desperate, they had better not be made. You will\r\nperceive by the letter No. 11, from the Marquis de la Fayette, that\r\nthere is a possibility of an overture from the Emperor. A hint from\r\nthe _charge des affaires of Naples_, lately, has induced me to suppose\r\nsomething of the same kind from thence. But the advanced period of our\r\ncommissions now offers good cause for avoiding to begin, what probably\r\ncannot be terminated during their continuance; and with respect to these\r\ntwo, and all other powers not before mentioned, I doubt whether the\r\nadvantages to be derived from treaties with them, will countervail the\r\nadditional embarrassments they may impose on the States, when they shall\r\nproceed to make those commercial arrangements necessary to counteract\r\nthe designs of the British cabinet. I repeat it, therefore, that the\r\nconclusion of the treaty with Prussia, and the probability of others\r\nwith Denmark, Tuscany and the Barbary States, may be expected to wind\r\nup the proceedings of the general commissions. I think that, in possible\r\nevents, it may be advantageous to us, by treaties with Prussia, Denmark,\r\nand Tuscany, to have secured ports in the Northern and Mediterranean\r\nseas. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect and\r\nesteem,\r\n\r\nSir, your most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXV.--TO MESSRS. VAN STAPHORST, October 12, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. VAN STAPHORST.\r\n\r\nParis, October 12, 1785.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nThe receipt of your favor, of September the 19th, should not have been\r\nso long unacknowledged, but that I have been peculiarly and very closely\r\nengaged ever since it came to hand.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the expediency of the arrangement you propose to make\r\nwith Mr. Parker, I must observe to you, that it would be altogether out\r\nof my province to give an official opinion, for your direction. These\r\ntransactions appertain altogether to the commissioners of the treasury,\r\nto whom you have very properly written on the occasion. I shall always\r\nbe willing, however, to apprize you of any facts I may be acquainted\r\nwith, and which might enable you to proceed with more certainty; and\r\neven to give my private opinion, where I am acquainted with the subject,\r\nleaving you the most perfect liberty to give it what weight you may\r\nthink proper. In the present case, I cannot give even a private opinion,\r\nbecause I am not told what are precisely the securities offered by Mr.\r\nParker. So various are the securities of the United States, that unless\r\nthey are precisely described by their dates, consideration, and other\r\nmaterial circumstances, no man on earth can say what they are worth.\r\nOne fact, however, is certain, that all debts of any considerable amount\r\ncontracted by the United States, while their paper money existed, are\r\nsubject to a deduction, and not payable at any fixed period. I think I\r\nmay venture to say, also, that there are no debts of the United States,\r\n‘on the same footing with the money loaned by Holland,’ except those due\r\nto the Kings of France and Spain. However, I hope you will soon receive\r\nthe answer of the commissioners, which alone can decide authoritatively\r\nwhat can be done.\r\n\r\nCongress have thought proper to entrust to Mr. Adams and myself a\r\ncertain business, which may eventually call for great advances of money:\r\nperhaps four hundred thousand livres or upwards. They have authorized\r\nus to draw for this on their funds in Holland. The separate situation of\r\nMr. Adams and myself rendering joint drafts inconvenient, we have agreed\r\nthat they shall be made by him alone. You will be pleased, therefore, to\r\ngive the same credit to these bills, drawn by him, as if they were also\r\nsubscribed by me.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with high respect, Gentlemen,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVI.--TO MONSIEUR DESBORDES, October 12,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DESBORDES.\r\n\r\nParis, October 12,1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThere are, in the prison of St. Pol de Léon, six or seven citizens of\r\nthe United States of America, charged with having attempted a contraband\r\nof tobacco, but, as they say themselves, forced into that port by\r\nstress of weather. I believe that they are innocent. Their situation\r\nis described to me to be as deplorable, as should be that of men found\r\nguilty of the worst of crimes. They are in close jail, allowed three\r\nsous a day only, and unable to speak a word of the language of the\r\ncountry. I hope their distress, which it is my duty to relieve, and the\r\nrecommendation of Mr. Barclay to address myself to you, will apologize\r\nfor the liberty I take, of asking you to advise them what to do for\r\ntheir defence, to engage some good lawyer for them, and to pass to them\r\nthe pecuniary reliefs necessary. I write to Mr. Lister Asquith, the\r\nowner of the vessel, that he may draw bills on me, from time to\r\ntime, for a livre a day for every person of them, and for what may be\r\nnecessary to engage a lawyer for him. I will pray the favor of you to\r\nfurnish him money for his bills drawn on me for these purposes, which I\r\nwill pay on sight. You will judge if he should go beyond this allowance,\r\nand be so good as to reject the surplus. I must desire his lawyer to\r\nsend me immediately a state of their case, and let me know in what\r\ncourt their process is, and when it is likely to be decided. I hope the\r\ncircumstances of the case will excuse the freedom I take; and I have the\r\nhonor to be, with great respect, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVII.--TO HOGENDORP, October 13,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HOGENDORP.\r\n\r\nParis, October 13,1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nHaving been much engaged lately, I have been unable sooner to\r\nacknowledge the receipt of your favor of September the 8th. What you are\r\npleased to say on the subject of my Notes, is more than they deserve.\r\nThe condition in which you first saw them, would prove to you how\r\nhastily they had been originally written; as you may remember the\r\nnumerous insertions I had made in them, from time to time, when I could\r\nfind a moment for turning to them from other occupations. I have never\r\nyet seen Monsieur de Buffon. He has been in the country all the summer.\r\nI sent him a copy of the book, and have only heard his sentiments on one\r\nparticular of it, that of the identity of the mammoth and elephant.\r\nAs to this, he retains his opinion that they are the same. If you had\r\nformed any considerable expectations from our revised code of laws, you\r\nwill be much disappointed. It contains not more than three or four laws\r\nwhich could strike the attention of a foreigner. Had it been a digest of\r\nall our laws, it would not have been comprehensible or instructive, but\r\nto a native. But it is still less so, as it digests only the British\r\nstatutes and our own acts of Assembly, which are but a supplementary\r\npart of our law. The great basis of it is anterior to the date of the\r\nMagna Charta, which is the oldest statute extant. The only merit of this\r\nwork is, that it may remove from our book-shelves about twenty folio\r\nvolumes of statutes, retaining all the parts of them, which either their\r\nown merit or the established system of laws required.\r\n\r\nYou ask me what are those operations of the British nation, which\r\nare likely to befriend us, and how they will produce this effect? The\r\nBritish government, as you may naturally suppose, have it much at heart\r\nto reconcile their nation to the loss of America. This is essential to\r\nthe repose, perhaps even to the safety of the King and his ministers.\r\nThe most effectual engines for this purpose are the public papers. You\r\nknow well, that that government always kept a kind of standing army of\r\nnews-writers, who, without any regard to truth, or to what should be\r\nlike truth, invented, and put into the papers, whatever might serve the\r\nministers. This suffices with the mass of the people, who have no means\r\nof distinguishing the false from the true paragraphs of a newspaper.\r\nWhen forced to acknowledge our independence, they were forced to\r\nredouble their efforts to keep the nation quiet. Instead of a few of\r\nthe papers, formerly engaged, they now engaged every one. No paper,\r\ntherefore, comes out without a dose of paragraphs against America. These\r\nare calculated for a secondary purpose also, that of preventing the\r\nemigrations of their people to America. They dwell very much on American\r\nbankruptcies. To explain these, would require a long detail; but would\r\nshow you that nine tenths of these bankruptcies are truly English\r\nbankruptcies, in no wise chargeable on America. However, they have\r\nproduced effects the most desirable of all others for us. They have\r\ndestroyed our credit, and thus checked our disposition to luxury; and,\r\nforcing our merchants to buy no more than they have ready money to pay\r\nfor, they force them to go to those markets where that ready money will\r\nbuy most. Thus you see, they check our luxury, they force us to connect\r\nourselves with all the world, and they prevent foreign emigrations to\r\nour country, all of which I consider as advantageous to us. They are\r\ndoing us another good turn. They attempt, without disguise, to possess\r\nthemselves of the carriage of our produce, and to prohibit our own\r\nvessels from participating of it. This has raised a general indignation\r\nin America. The States see, however, that their constitutions have\r\nprovided no means of counteracting it. They are therefore beginning to\r\nvest Congress with the absolute power of regulating their commerce,\r\nonly reserving all revenue arising from it, to the State in which it is\r\nlevied. This will consolidate our federal building very much, and for\r\nthis we shall be indebted to the British.\r\n\r\nYou ask what I think on the expediency of encouraging our States to\r\nbe commercial? Were I to indulge my own theory, I should wish them to\r\npractise neither commerce nor navigation, but to stand, with respect to\r\nEurope, precisely on the footing of China. We should thus avoid wars,\r\nand all our citizens would be husbandmen. Whenever, indeed, our numbers\r\nshould so increase, as that our produce would overstock the markets of\r\nthose nations who should come to seek it, the farmers must either employ\r\nthe surplus of their time in manufactures, or the surplus of our hands\r\nmust be employed in manufactures, or in navigation. But that day would,\r\nI think, be distant, and we should long keep our workmen in Europe,\r\nwhile Europe should be drawing rough materials, and even subsistence,\r\nfrom America. But this is theory only, and a theory which the servants\r\nof America are not at liberty to follow. Our people have a decided taste\r\nfor navigation and commerce. They take this from their mother country;\r\nand their servants are in duty bound to calculate all their measures on\r\nthis datum: we wish to do it by throwing open all the doors of commerce,\r\nand knocking off its shackles. But as this cannot be done for others,\r\nunless they will do it for us, and there is no great probability that\r\nEurope will do this, I suppose we shall be obliged to adopt a system\r\nwhich may shackle them in our ports, as they do us in theirs. With\r\nrespect to the sale of our lands, that cannot begin till a considerable\r\nportion shall have been surveyed. They cannot begin to survey till the\r\nfall of the leaf of this year, nor to sell probably till the ensuing\r\nspring. So that it will be yet a twelvemonth, before we shall be able to\r\njudge of the efficacy of our land-office, to sink our national debt. It\r\nis made a fundamental, that the proceeds shall be solely and sacredly\r\napplied as a sinking fund, to discharge the capital only of the debt.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the tobaccos of Virginia go almost entirely to England.\r\nThe reason is, the people of that State owe a great debt there, which\r\nthey are paying as fast as they can. I think I have now answered your\r\nseveral queries, and shall be happy to receive your reflections on the\r\nsame subjects, and at all times to hear of your welfare, and to give you\r\nassurances of the esteem, with which I have the honor to be, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVIII.--TO J. BANNISTER, JUNIOR, October 15,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. BANNISTER, JUNIOR.\r\n\r\nParis, October 15,1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI should sooner have answered the paragraph in your letter, of September\r\nthe 19th, respecting the best seminary for the education of youth,\r\nin Europe, but that it was necessary for me to make inquiries on the\r\nsubject. The result of these has been, to consider the competition as\r\nresting between Geneva and Rome. They are equally cheap, and probably\r\nare equal in the course of education pursued. The advantage of Geneva\r\nis, that students acquire there the habit of speaking French. The\r\nadvantages of Rome are, the acquiring a local knowledge of a spot so\r\nclassical and so celebrated; the acquiring the true pronunciation of the\r\nLatin language; a just taste in the fine arts, more particularly those\r\nof painting, sculpture, architecture, and music; a familiarity with\r\nthose objects and processes of agriculture, which experience has shown\r\nbest adapted to a climate like ours; and lastly, the advantage of a\r\nfine climate for health. It is probable, too, that by being boarded in a\r\nFrench family, the habit of speaking that language may be obtained. I\r\ndo not count on any advantage to be derived in Geneva from a familiar\r\nacquaintance with the principles of that government. The late revolution\r\nhas rendered it a tyrannical aristocracy, more likely to give ill, than\r\ngood ideas to an American. I think the balance in favor of Rome. Pisa is\r\nsometimes spoken of, as a place of education. But it does not offer\r\nthe first and third of the advantages of Rome. But why send an American\r\nyouth to Europe for education? What are the objects of an useful\r\nAmerican education? Classical knowledge, modern languages, chiefly\r\nFrench, Spanish, and Italian; Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Natural\r\nHistory, Civil History, and Ethics. In Natural Philosophy, I mean to\r\ninclude Chemistry and Agriculture, and in Natural History, to include\r\nBotany, as well as the other branches of those departments. It is\r\ntrue, that the habit of speaking the modern languages cannot be so well\r\nacquired in America; but every other article can be as well acquired\r\nat William and Mary College, as at any place in Europe. When college\r\neducation is done with, and a young man is to prepare himself for public\r\nlife, he must cast his eyes (for America) either on Law or Physic. For\r\nthe former, where can he apply so advantageously as to Mr. Wythe? For\r\nthe latter, he must come to Europe: the medical class of students,\r\ntherefore, is the only one which need come to Europe. Let us view the\r\ndisadvantages of sending a youth to Europe. To enumerate them all, would\r\nrequire a volume. I will select a few. If he goes to England, he learns\r\ndrinking, horse-racing, and boxing. These are the peculiarities of\r\nEnglish education. The following circumstances are common to education\r\nin that, and the other countries of Europe. He acquires a fondness for\r\nEuropean luxury,and dissipation, and a contempt for the simplicity of\r\nhis own country; he is fascinated with the privileges of the European\r\naristocrats, and sees, with abhorrence, the lovely equality which the\r\npoor enjoy with the rich in his own country; he contracts a partiality\r\nfor aristocracy or monarchy; he forms foreign friendships which will\r\nnever be useful to him, and loses the season of life for forming in\r\nhis own country those friendships, which, of all others, are the most\r\nfaithful and permanent; he is led by the strongest of all the human\r\npassions into a spirit for female intrigue, destructive of his own and\r\nothers’ happiness, or a passion for whores, destructive of his health,\r\nand in both cases, learns to consider fidelity to the marriage bed as an\r\nungentlemanly practice, and inconsistent with happiness; he recollects\r\nthe voluptuary dress and arts of the European women, and pities and\r\ndespises the chaste affections and simplicity of those of his own\r\ncountry; he retains, through life, a fond recollection, and a hankering\r\nafter those places, which were the scenes of his first pleasures and\r\nof his first connections; he returns to his own country a foreigner,\r\nunacquainted with the practices of domestic economy necessary to\r\npreserve him from ruin, speaking and writing his native tongue as a\r\nforeigner, and therefore unqualified to obtain those distinctions, which\r\neloquence of the pen and tongue ensures in a free country; for, I would\r\nobserve to you, that what is called style in writing or speaking,\r\nis formed very early in life, while the imagination is warm, and\r\nimpressions are permanent. I am of opinion, that there never was an\r\ninstance of a man’s writing or speaking his native tongue with elegance,\r\nwho passed from fifteen to twenty years of age out of the country\r\nwhere it was spoken. Thus, no instance exists of a person’s writing two\r\nlanguages perfectly. That will always appear to be his native language,\r\nwhich was most familiar to him in his youth. It appears to me then, that\r\nan American coming to Europe for education, loses in his knowledge, in\r\nhis morals, in his health, in his habits, and in his happiness. I had\r\nentertained only doubts on this head, before I came to Europe: what I\r\nsee and hear, since I came here, proves more than I had even suspected.\r\nCast your eye over America: who are the men of most learning, of most\r\neloquence, most beloved by their countrymen, and most trusted and\r\npromoted by them? They are those who have been educated among them, and\r\nwhose manners, morals, and habits, are perfectly homogeneous with those\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nDid you expect by so short a question, to draw such a sermon on\r\nyourself? I daresay you did not. But the consequences of foreign\r\neducation are alarming to me, as an American. I sin, therefore, through\r\nzeal, whenever I enter on the subject. You are sufficiently American\r\nto pardon me for it. Let me hear of your health, and be assured of the\r\nesteem with which I am, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIX.--TO MR. CARMICHAEL, October 18, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nParis, October 18, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 29th of September came safely to hand: the constant\r\nexpectation of the departure of the persons whom I formerly gave you\r\nreason to expect, has prevented my writing, as it has done yours. They\r\nwill probably leave this in a week, but their route will be circuitous\r\nand attended with delays. Between the middle and last of November, they\r\nmay be with you. By them, you will receive a cipher, by which you may\r\ncommunicate with Mr. Adams and myself. I should have sent it by Baron\r\nDreyer, the Danish minister; but I then expected our own conveyance\r\nwould have been quicker. Having mentioned this gentleman, give me leave\r\nto recommend him to your acquaintance. He is plain, sensible, and open:\r\nhe speaks English well, and had he been to remain here, I should have\r\ncultivated his acquaintance much. Be so good as to present me very\r\nrespectfully to him.\r\n\r\nThis being to go by post, I shall only add the few articles of general\r\nAmerican news, by the last packet. Dr. Franklin arrived in good health\r\nat Philadelphia, the 15th ult., and was received amidst the acclamations\r\nof an immense crowd. No late event has produced greater demonstrations\r\nof joy. It is doubted whether Congress will adjourn this summer; but\r\nthey are so thin, they do not undertake important business. Our western\r\nposts are in statu quo.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXX.--TO MESSRS. VAN STAPHORSTS, October 25,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. VAN STAPHORSTS.\r\n\r\nParis, October 25,1785.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nI received yesterday your favor of the 20th instant. In order to give\r\nyou the information you desire, on the subject of the liquidated debts\r\nof the United States, and the comparative footing on which they stand,\r\nI must observe to you, that the first and great division of our\r\nfederal debt, is, into 1. foreign; and 2. domestic. The foreign debt\r\ncomprehends, 1. the loan from the government of Spain; 2. the loans from\r\nthe government of France, and from the Farmers General; 3. the loans\r\nnegotiated in Holland, by order of Congress. This branch of our debt\r\nstands absolutely singular: no man in the United States having ever\r\nsupposed that Congress, or their legislatures, can, in any wise, modify\r\nor alter it. They justly view the United States as the one party,\r\nand the lenders as the other, and that the consent of both would be\r\nrequisite, were any modification to be proposed. But with respect to the\r\ndomestic debt, they consider Congress as representing both the borrowers\r\nand lenders, and that the modifications which have taken place in this,\r\nhave been necessary to do justice between the two parties, and that they\r\nflowed properly from Congress as their mutual umpire. The domestic debt\r\ncomprehends 1. the army debt; 2. the loan-office debt; 3. the liquidated\r\ndebt; and 4. the unliquidated debt. The first term includes debts to the\r\nofficers and soldiers for pay, bounty, and subsistence. The second term\r\nmeans monies put into the loan-office of the United States. The third\r\ncomprehends all debts contracted by quarter-masters, commissioners, and\r\nothers duly authorized to procure supplies for the army, and which have\r\nbeen liquidated (that is, settled) by commissioners appointed under the\r\nresolution of Congress, of June the 12th, 1780, or by the officer who\r\nmade the contract. The fourth comprehends the whole mass of debts,\r\ndescribed in the preceding article, which have not yet been liquidated.\r\nThese are in a course of liquidation, and are passing over daily into\r\nthe third class. The debts of this third class, that is, the liquidated\r\ndebt, is the object of your inquiry. No time is fixed for the payment of\r\nit, no fund as yet determined, nor any firm provision for the interest\r\nin the mean time. The consequence is, that the certificates of these\r\ndebts sell greatly below par. When I left America, they could be bought\r\nfor from two shillings and sixpence to fifteen shillings, in the pound:\r\nthis difference proceeding from the circumstance of some STates having\r\nprovided for paying the interest on those due in their own State, which\r\nothers had not. Hence, an opinion had arisen with some, and propositions\r\nhad even been made in the legislatures, for paying off the principal of\r\nthese debts with what they had cost the holder, and interest on that.\r\nThis opinion is far from being general, and I think will not prevail.\r\nBut it is among possible events.\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular, that you might be able to judge, not only\r\nin the present case, but also in others, should any attempts be made\r\nto speculate in your city, on these papers. It is a business, in which\r\nforeigners will be in great danger of being duped. It is a science which\r\nbids defiance to the powers of reason. To understand it, a man must not\r\nonly be on the spot, and be perfectly possessed of all the circumstances\r\nrelative to every species of these papers, but he must have that\r\ndexterity which the habit of buying and selling them alone gives. The\r\nbrokers of these certificates are few in number, and any other person\r\nventuring to deal with them, engages in a very unequal contest.\r\n\r\ni have the honor to be, with the highest respect, gentlemen,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXI.--TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, November 4, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nParis, November 4, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of writing you on the 18th of October, and again on\r\nthe 25th of the same month. Both letters, being to pass through the\r\npost-offices, were confined to particular subjects. The first of them\r\nacknowledged the receipt of yours of September the 29th.\r\n\r\nAt length a confidential opportunity arrives for conveying to you a\r\ncipher; it will be handed you by the bearer, Mr, Lambe. Copies of it are\r\nin the hands of Mr. Adams, at London, Mr. Barclay, who is proceeding to\r\nMorocco, and Mr. Lambe, who is proceeding to Algiers. This enables us\r\nto keep up such correspondences with each other, as maybe requisite.\r\nCongress, in the spring of 1784, gave powers to Mr. Adams, Dr. Franklin,\r\nand myself, to treat with the Barbary States. But they gave us no money\r\nfor them, and the other duties assigned us rendered it impossible for\r\nus to proceed thither in person. These things having been represented to\r\nthem, they assigned to us a certain sum of money, and gave us powers\r\nto delegate agents to treat with those States, and to form preliminary\r\narticles, but confining to us the signing of them in a definitive form.\r\nThey did not restrain us in the appointment of the agents; but the\r\norders of Congress were brought to us by Mr. Lambe, they had waited for\r\nhim four months, and the recommendations he brought, pointed him out, in\r\nour opinion, as a person who would meet the approbation of Congress. We\r\ntherefore appointed him to negotiate with the Algerines. His manners\r\nand appearance are not promising. But he is a sensible man, and seems to\r\npossess some talents which may be proper in a matter of bargain. We have\r\njoined with him, as secretary, a Mr. Randall, from New York, in whose\r\nprudence we hope he will find considerable aid. They now proceed to\r\nMadrid, merely with the view of seeing you, as we are assured they\r\nwill receive from you lights which may be useful to them. I hear that\r\nD’Expilly and the Algerine ministers have gone from Madrid. Letters\r\nfrom Algiers, of August the 24th, inform me, that we had two vessels and\r\ntheir crews in captivity there, at that time. I have never had reason to\r\nbelieve certainly, that any others had been captured. Should Mr. Lambe\r\nhave occasion to draw bills, while in Spain, on Mr. Adams, you may\r\nsafely assure the purchasers that they will be paid.\r\n\r\nAn important matter detains Mr. Barclay some days longer, and his\r\njourney to Madrid will be circuitous. Perhaps he may arrive there a\r\nmonth later than Lambe. It would be well if the Emperor of Morocco\r\ncould, in the mean time, know that such a person is on the road. Perhaps\r\nyou may have an opportunity of notifying this to him officially, by\r\nasking from him passports for Mr. Barclay and his suite. This would\r\nbe effecting too[sp.] good purposes at once, if you can find an\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nYour letter of September the 2d did not get to my hands till these\r\narrangements were all taken between Mr. Adams and myself, and the\r\npersons appointed. That gave me the first hint that you would have acted\r\nin this business. I mean no flattery when I assure you, that no person\r\nwould have better answered my wishes. At the same time, I doubt whether\r\nMr. Adams and myself should have thought ourselves justifiable in\r\nwithdrawing a servant of the United States from a post equally important\r\nwith those, which prevented our acting personally in the same business.\r\nI am sure, that, remaining where you are, you will be able to forward\r\nmuch the business, and that you will do it with the zeal you have\r\nhitherto manifested on every occasion.\r\n\r\nYour intercourse with America being less frequent than ours, from this\r\nplace, I will state to you, generally, such new occurrences there,\r\nas may be interesting; some of which, perhaps, you will not have been\r\ninformed of. It was doubtful, at the date of my last letters, whether\r\nCongress would adjourn this summer. They were too thin, however, to\r\nundertake important business. They had begun arrangements for the\r\nestablishment of a mint. The Dollar was decided on as the money unit\r\nof America. I believe, they proposed to have gold, silver, and copper\r\ncoins, descending and ascending decimally; viz. a gold coin of ten\r\ndollars, a silver coin of one tenth of a dollar (equal to a Spanish\r\nbit), and a copper, of one hundredth of a dollar. These parts of the\r\nplan, however, were not ultimately decided on. They have adopted the\r\nlate improvement in the British post-office, of sending their mails by\r\nthe stages. I am told, this is done from New Hampshire to Georgia, and\r\nfrom New York to Albany. Their treasury is administered by a board,\r\nof which Mr. Walter Livingston, Mr. Osgood, and Dr. Arthur Lee, are\r\nmembers. Governor Rutledge who had been appointed minister to the Hague,\r\non the refusal of Governor Livingston, declines coming. We are\r\nuncertain whether the States will generally come into the proposition of\r\ninvesting. Congress with the regulation of their commerce. Massachusetts\r\nhas passed an act, the first object of which seemed to be, to retaliate\r\non the British commercial measures, but in the close of it, they impose\r\ndouble duties on all goods imported in bottoms not wholly owned by\r\ncitizens of our States. New Hampshire has followed the example. This\r\nis much complained of here, and will probably draw retaliating measures\r\nfrom the States of Europe, if generally adopted in America, or not\r\ncorrected by the States which have adopted it. It must be our endeavor\r\nto keep them quiet on this side the water, under the hope that our\r\ncountrymen will correct this step; as I trust they will do. It is no\r\nways akin to their general system. I am trying here to get contracts\r\nfor the supplying the cities of France with whale-oil, by the Boston\r\nmerchants. It would be the greatest relief possible to that State,\r\nwhose commerce is in agonies, in consequence of being subjected to alien\r\nduties on their oil in Great Britain, which has been heretofore their\r\nonly market. Can any thing be done, in this way, in Spain? Or do they\r\nthere light their streets in the night?\r\n\r\nA fracas, which has lately happened in Boston, becoming a serious\r\nmatter, I will give you the details of it, as transmitted to Mr. Adams\r\nin depositions. A Captain Stanhope, commanding the frigate Mercury,\r\nwas sent with a convoy of vessels from Nova Scotia to Boston, to get a\r\nsupply of provisions for that colony. It had happened, that two persons\r\nliving near Boston, of the names of Dunbar and Lowthorp, had been taken\r\nprisoners during the war, and transferred from one vessel to another,\r\ntill they were placed on board Stanhope’s ship. He treated them most\r\ncruelly, whipping them frequently, in order to make them do duty against\r\ntheir country, as sailors, on board his ship. The ship going to Antigua\r\nto refit, he put all his prisoners into jail, first giving Dunbar\r\ntwenty-four lashes. Peace took place, and the prisoners got home\r\nunder the general liberation. These men were quietly pursuing their\r\noccupations at home, when they heard that Stanhope was in Boston.\r\nTheir indignation was kindled. They immediately went there, and meeting\r\nStanhope walking in the mall, Dunbar stepped up to him, and asked him\r\nif he recollected him, and the whipping him on board his ship. Having\r\nno weapon in his hand, he struck at Stanhope with his fist. Stanhope\r\nstepped back, and drew his sword. The people interposed, and guarded him\r\nto the door of a Mr. Morton, to which he retreated. There Dunbar again\r\nattempted to seize him; but the high-sheriff had by this time arrived,\r\nwho interposed and protected him. The assailants withdrew, and here\r\nended all appearance of force. But Captain Stanhope thought proper to\r\nwrite to the Governor, which brought on the correspondence published in\r\nthe papers of Europe. Lest you should not have seen it, I enclose it, as\r\ncut from a London paper; though not perfectly exact, it is substantially\r\nso. You will doubtless judge, that Governor Bowdoin referred him\r\nproperly to the laws for redress, as he was obliged to do, and as would\r\nhave been done in England, in a like case. Had he applied to the courts,\r\nthe question would have been whether they would have punished Dunbar.\r\nThis must be answered now by conjecture only; and, to form that\r\nconjecture, every man must ask himself, whether he would not have done\r\nas Dunbar did; and whether the people should not have permitted him to\r\nreturn to Stanhope the twenty-four lashes. This affair has been stated\r\nin the London papers, without mixing with it one circumstance of truth.\r\n\r\nIn your letter of the 27th of June, you were so good as to tell me that\r\nyou should shortly send off some of the books I had taken the liberty to\r\nask you to get for me, and that your correspondent at Bayonne would give\r\nme notice of their arrival there. Not having heard from him, I mention\r\nit to you, lest they should be stopped any where.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXII.--TO RICHARD O’BRYAN, November 4, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD O’BRYAN.\r\n\r\nParis, November 4, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you a short letter on the 29th of September, acknowledging the\r\nreceipt of yours of August the 24th, from Algiers, and promising that\r\nyou should hear further from me soon. Mr. Adams, the American minister\r\nat London, and myself, have agreed to authorize the bearer hereof, Mr.\r\nLambe, to treat for your redemption, and that of your companions taken\r\nin American vessels, and, if it can be obtained for sums within\r\nour power, we shall have the money paid. But in this we act without\r\ninstruction from Congress, and are therefore obliged to take the\r\nprecaution of requiring, that you bind your owners for yourself and\r\ncrew, and the other captain, in like manner, his owners for himself and\r\ncrew, and that each person separately make himself answerable for his\r\nown redemption, in case Congress requires it. I suppose Congress will\r\nnot require it: but we have no authority to decide that, but must leave\r\nit to their own decision; which renders necessary the precautions I have\r\nmentioned, in order to justify ourselves for undertaking to redeem you\r\nwithout orders. Mr. Lambe is instructed to make no bargain without your\r\napprobation, and that of the other prisoners, each for himself. We also\r\ndirect him to relieve your present necessities. I sincerely wish you\r\na speedy deliverance from your distresses, and a happy return to your\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIII.--TO W. W. SEWARD, November 12,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. W. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nParis, November 12,1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI received the honor of your letter, of the 25th ult., written by desire\r\nof the associated company of Irish merchants, in London, and return you\r\nthanks for the kind congratulations you express therein. The freedom of\r\ncommerce between Ireland and America is undoubtedly very interesting\r\nto both countries. If fair play be given to the natural advantages of\r\nIreland, she must come in for a distinguished share of that commerce.\r\nShe is entitled to it, from the excellence of some of her manufactures,\r\nthe cheapness of most of them, their correspondence with the American\r\ntaste, a sameness of language, laws, and manners, a reciprocal affection\r\nbetween the people, and the singular circumstance of her being the\r\nnearest European land to the United States. I am not, at present, so\r\nwell acquainted with the trammels of Irish commerce, as to know what\r\nthey are, particularly, which obstruct the intercourse between Ireland\r\nand America; nor, therefore, what can be the object of a fleet stationed\r\nin the western ocean, to intercept that intercourse. Experience,\r\nhowever, has taught us to infer that the fact is probable, because it\r\nis impolitic. On the supposition that this interruption will take place,\r\nyou suggest Ostend as a convenient entrepot for the commerce between\r\nAmerica and Ireland. Here, too, I find myself, on account of the same\r\nignorance of your commercial regulations, at a loss to say why this is\r\npreferable to L’Orient, which, you know, is a free port and in great\r\nlatitude, which is nearer to both parties, and accessible by a less\r\ndangerous navigation. I make no doubt, however, that the reasons of the\r\npreference are good. You find by this essay, that I am not likely to be\r\na very instructive correspondent: you shall find me, however, zealous in\r\nwhatever may concern the interests of the two countries. The system into\r\nwhich the United States wished to go, was that of freeing commerce from\r\nevery shackle. A contrary conduct in Great Britain will occasion, them\r\nto adopt the contrary system, at least as to that island. I am sure\r\nthey would be glad, if it should be, found practicable, to make that\r\ndiscrimination between Great Britain and Ireland, which their commercial\r\nprinciples, and their affection for the latter, would dictate.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect for yourself and the\r\ncompany for whom you write, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTm: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIV.--TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES, November 14,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.\r\n\r\nParis, November 14,1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of troubling your Excellency on behalf of six\r\ncitizens of the United States, who have been for some time confined in\r\nthe prison of St. Pol de Léon, and of referring for particulars to\r\nthe enclosed state of their case. Some of the material facts therein\r\nmentioned, are founded on the bill of sale for the vessel, her clearance\r\nfrom Baltimore, and her log-book. The originals of the two last, and\r\na copy of the first, are in my hands. I have, also, letters from a\r\nmerchant in Liverpool to Asquith, which render it really probable that\r\nhis vessel was bound to Liverpool. The other circumstances depend on\r\ntheir affirmation, but I must say that in these facts they have been\r\nuniform and steady. I have thus long avoided troubling your Excellency\r\nwith this case, in hopes it would receive its decision in the ordinary\r\ncourse of law, and I relied, that that would indemnify the sufferers,\r\nif they had been used unjustly: but though they have been in close\r\nconfinement now near three months, it has yet no appearance of\r\napproaching to decision. In the mean time, the cold of the winter is\r\ncoming on, and to men in their situation, may produce events which\r\nwould render all indemnification too late. I must, therefore, pray the\r\nassistance of your Excellency, for the liberation of their persons, if\r\nthe established order of things may possibly admit of it. As to their\r\nproperty and their personal sufferings hitherto, I have full confidence\r\nthat the laws have provided some tribunal where justice will be done\r\nthem. I enclose the opinion of an advocate, forwarded to me by a\r\ngentleman whom I had desired to obtain, from some judicious person of\r\nthat faculty, a state of their case. This may perhaps give a better idea\r\nthan I can, of the situation of their cause. His inquiries have led him\r\nto believe they are innocent men, but that they must lose their vessel\r\nunder the edict, which forbids those under thirty tons to approach the\r\ncoast. Admitting their innocence, as he does, I should suppose them not\r\nthe objects on whom such an edict was meant to operate. The essential\r\npapers, which he says they re-demanded from him, and did not return,\r\nwere sent to me, at my desire. I am, with sentiments of the highest\r\nrespect, your Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The case of Lister Asquith, owner of the schooner William and\r\nCatharine, William M’Neil, captain, William Thomson, William Neily,\r\nRobert Anderson, mariners, and William Fowler, passenger_.\r\n\r\nLister Asquith, citizen of the State of Maryland, having a lawsuit\r\ndepending in England which required his presence, as involving in its\r\nissue nearly his whole fortune, determined to go thither in a small\r\nschooner of his own, that he might, at the same time, take with him an\r\nadventure of tobacco and flour to Liverpool, where he had commercial\r\nconnections. This schooner he purchased as of fifty-nine and a quarter\r\ntons, as appears by his bill of sale, but she had been registered by\r\nher owner at twenty-one tons, in order to evade the double duties in\r\nEngland, to which American vessels are now subject. He cleared out from\r\nBaltimore for Liverpool, the 11th of June, 1785, with eight hogsheads\r\nof tobacco and sixty barrels of flour, but ran aground at Smith’s point,\r\nsprung a leak, and was obliged to return to Baltimore to refit. Having\r\nstopped his leak, he took his cargo on board again, and his health being\r\ninfirm, he engaged Captain William M’Neil* to go with him, and on the\r\n20th of June sailed for Norfolk in Virginia, and, on the 22nd, came to\r\nin Hampton road, at the mouth of the river on which Norfolk is. Learning\r\nhere, that tobacco would be better than flour for the English market, he\r\nlanded fifty barrels of his flour and one hogshead of tobacco, which\r\nhe found to be bad, meaning to take, instead thereof, nine hogsheads of\r\ntobacco more. But the same night it began to blow very hard, with much\r\nrain. The 23d, the storm became more heavy; they let go both their\r\nanchors, but were driven, notwithstanding, from their anchorage, forced\r\nto put to sea and to go before the wind. The occurrences of their voyage\r\nwill be best detailed by short extracts from the log-book.\r\n\r\n     * This was the officer, who, on the evacuation of Fort\r\n     Mifflin, after the British had passed the chevaux-de-frise\r\n     on the Delaware, was left with fifteen men to destroy the\r\n     works, which he did, and brought off his men successfully.\r\n     He had, before that, been commander of the Rattlesnake sloop\r\n     of war, and had much annoyed the British trade; Being bred a\r\n     seaman, he has returned to that vocation.\r\n\r\nJune 24. The weather becomes worse. One of the fore shrouds and the\r\nforemast, carried away.\r\n\r\nJune 25. Shifted their ballast, which threw them on their beam ends, and\r\nshipped a very heavy sea. Held a consultation; the result of which\r\nwas, that seeing they were now driven so far to sea, and the weather\r\ncontinuing still very bad, it was better to steer for Liverpool, their\r\nport of destination, though they had not their cargo on board, and no\r\nother clearance but that which they took from Baltimore.\r\n\r\nJune 29. The first observation they had been able to take N.lat. 38°\r\n13’.\r\n\r\nJune 30. Winds begin to be light, but the sea still very heavy.\r\n\r\nJuly 5. Light winds and a smooth sea for the first time, in lat. 43°\r\n12’.\r\n\r\nJuly 9. Spoke a French brig, Comte D’Artois, Captain Mieaux, from St.\r\nMaloes, in distress for provisions. Relieved her with three barrels of\r\nflour.\r\n\r\nAug. 6. Thick weather and strong wind. Made the Land’s End of England.\r\n\r\nAug. 7. Unable to fetch the land, therefore bore off for Scilly, and\r\ncame to with both anchors. Drove, notwithstanding, and obliged to get up\r\nthe anchors, and put to sea, running southwardly.\r\n\r\nAug. 8. Made the land of France, but did not know what part.\r\n\r\nHere the log-book ends. At this time they had on board but ten gallons\r\nof water, four or five barrels of bread, two or three pounds of candles,\r\nno firewood. Their sails unfit to be trusted to any longer, and all\r\ntheir materials for mending them exhausted by the constant repairs which\r\nthe violence of the weather had called for. They therefore took a pilot\r\naboard, who carried them into Pont Duval; but being informed by the\r\ncaptain of a vessel there, that the schooner was too sharp built (as\r\nthe American vessels mostly are) to lie in that port, they put out\r\nimmediately, and the next morning the pilot brought them to anchor\r\nin the road of the Isle de Bas. Asquith went immediately to Roscaff,\r\nprotested at the admiralty the true state of his case, and reported\r\nhis vessel and cargo at the custom-house. In making the report of his\r\nvessel, he stated her as of twenty-one tons, according to his register.\r\nThe officer informed him that if she was no larger, she would be\r\nconfiscated by an edict, which forbids all vessels, under thirty tons,\r\nto approach the coast. He told the officer what was the real truth as\r\nto his register and his bill of sale, and was permitted to report her\r\naccording to the latter. He paid the usual fees of ten livres and\r\nseven sols, and obtained a clearance. Notwithstanding this, he was soon\r\nvisited by other persons, whom he supposes to have been _commis_ of the\r\n_Fermes_, who seized his vessel, carried her to the pier, and confined\r\nthe crew to the vessel and half the pier, putting centinels over them.\r\nThey brought a guager, who measured only her hold and part of her\r\nsteerage, allowing nothing for the cockpit, cabin, forecastle, and above\r\none half of the steerage, which is almost half the vessel, and thus made\r\nher contents (if that had been of any importance) much below the truth.\r\nThe tobacco was weighed, and found to be six thousand four hundred and\r\neighty-seven pounds,* which was sent on the 18th to Landivisiau, and on\r\nthe 19th, they were committed to close prison at St. Pol de Léon, where\r\nthey have been confined ever since. They had, when they first landed,\r\nsome money, of which they were soon disembarrassed by different persons,\r\nwho, in various forms, undertook to serve them. Unable to speak or\r\nunderstand a word of the language of the country, friendless, and left\r\nwithout money, they have languished three months in a loathsome jail,\r\nwithout any other sustenance, a great part of the time, than what could\r\nbe procured for three sous a day, which have been furnished them to\r\nprevent their perishing.\r\n\r\n     * A hogshead of tobacco weighs generally about one thousand\r\n     pounds, English, equal to nine hundred and seventeen pounds\r\n     French. The seven hogsheads he sailed with, would therefore\r\n     weigh, according to this estimate, six thousand four hundred\r\n     and twenty-three pounds. They actually weighed more on the\r\n     first essay. When afterwards weighed at Landivisiau, they\r\n     had lost eighty-four pounds on being carried into a drier\r\n     air. Perhaps, too, a difference of weights may have entered\r\n     into this apparent loss.\r\n\r\nThey have been made to understand that a criminal process is going on\r\nagainst them under two heads. 1. As having sold tobacco in contraband;\r\nand 2., as having entered a port of France in a vessel of less than\r\nthirty tons’ burthen. In support of the first charge, they understand\r\nthat the circumstance is relied on, of their having been seen off the\r\ncoast by the _employés des Fermes_, one or two days. They acknowledge\r\nthey may have been so seen while beating off Pont Duval, till they could\r\nget a pilot, while entering that port, and again going round from\r\nthence to the road of the Isle de Bas. The reasons for this have been\r\nexplained. They further add, that all the time they were at Pont Duval\r\nthey had a King’s officer on board, from whom, as well as from their\r\npilot, and the captain, by whose advise they left that port for the\r\nIsle de Bas, information can be obtained by their accusers (who are not\r\nimprisoned) of the true motives for that measure. It is said to be\r\nurged also, that there was found in their vessel some loose tobacco in\r\na blanket, which excites a suspicion that they had been selling tobacco.\r\nWhen they were stowing their loading, they broke a hogshead, as is\r\nalways necessary, and is always done, to fill up the stowage, and to\r\nconsolidate and keep the whole mass firm and in place. The loose tobacco\r\nwhich had come out of the broken hogshead, they re-packed in bags:\r\nbut in the course of the distress of their disastrous voyage, they\r\nhad employed these bags, as they had done every thing else of the same\r\nnature, in mending their sails. The condition of their sails when they\r\ncame into port will prove this, and they were seen by witnesses enough,\r\nto whom their accusers, being at their liberty, can have access.\r\nBesides, the sale of a part of their tobacco is a fact, which, had it\r\ntaken place, might have been proved; but they deny that it has been\r\nproved, or ever can be proved by true men, because it never existed. And\r\nthey hope the justice of this country does not permit strangers, seeking\r\nin her ports an asylum from death, to be thrown into jail and continued\r\nthere indefinitely, on the possibility of a fact, without any proof.\r\nMore especially when, as in the present case, a demonstration to the\r\ncontrary is furnished by their clearance, which shows they never had\r\nmore than eight hogsheads of tobacco on board, of which one had been put\r\nashore at Hampton in Virginia, as has been before related, and the seven\r\nothers remained when they first entered port. If they had been smugglers\r\nof tobacco, the opposite coast offered a much fairer field, because the\r\ngain there is as great; because they understand the language and laws of\r\nthe country, they know its harbors and coasts, and have connections\r\nin them. These circumstances are so important to smugglers, that it\r\nis believed no instance has ever occurred of the contraband tobacco,\r\nattempted on this side the channel, by a crew wholly American. Be this\r\nas it may, they are not of that description of men.\r\n\r\nAs to the second charge, that they have entered a port of France in\r\na vessel of less than thirty tons’ burthen, they, in the first place,\r\nobserve, that they saw the guager measure the vessel, and affirm that\r\nhis method of measuring could render little more than half her true\r\ncontents: but they say, further, that were she below the size of thirty\r\ntons, and, when entering the port, had they known of the alternative of\r\neither forfeiting their vessel and cargo, or of perishing at sea; they\r\nmust still have entered the port: the loss of their vessel and cargo\r\nbeing the lesser evil. But the character of the lawgiver assures\r\nthem, that the intention of his laws are perverted, when misapplied to\r\npersons, who, under their circumstances, take refuge in his ports. They\r\nhave no occasion to recur from his clemency to his justice, by claiming\r\nthe benefit of that article in the treaty which binds the two nations\r\ntogether, and which assures to the fugitives of either from the dangers\r\nof the sea, a hospitable reception and necessary aids in the ports of\r\nthe other, and that, without measuring the size of their vessel.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, they protest themselves to have been as innocent as they\r\nhave been unfortunate. Instead of relief in a friendly port, they have\r\nseen their misfortunes aggravated by the conduct of officers, who, in\r\ntheir greediness for gain, can see in no circumstance any thing but\r\nproofs of guilt. They have already long suffered and are still suffering\r\nwhatever scanty sustenance, an inclement season, and close confinement\r\ncan offer most distressing to men who have been used to neither, and who\r\nhave wives and children at home participating of their distresses; they\r\nare utterly ignorant of the laws and language of the country, where\r\nthey are suffering; they are deprived of that property which would have\r\nenabled them to procure counsel to place their injuries in a true light;\r\nthey are distant from the stations of those who are appointed by their\r\ncountry to patronize their rights; they are not at liberty to go\r\nto them, nor able to have communication through any other than the\r\nuncertain medium of the posts; and they see themselves already ruined by\r\nthe losses and delays they have been made to incur, and by the\r\nfailure of the original object of their voyage. They throw themselves,\r\ntherefore, on the patronage of the government, and pray that its energy\r\nmay be interposed in aid of their poverty and ignorance, to restore them\r\nto their liberty, and to extend to them that retribution which the laws\r\nof every country mean to extend to those who suffer unjustly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXV.--TO JOHN ADAMS, November 19, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, November 19, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote to you on the 11th of October, by Mr. Preston, and again on\r\nthe 18th of the same month, by post. Since that, yours of September\r\nthe 25th, by Mr. Boylston, of October the 24th, November the 1st, and\r\nNovember the 4th, have come safe to hand. I will take up their several\r\nsubjects in order. Boylston’s object was, first, to dispose of a cargo\r\nof spermaceti oil, which he brought to Havre. A secondary one, was to\r\nobtain a contract for future supplies. I carried him to the Marquis\r\nde la Fayette. As to his first object, we are in hopes of getting the\r\nduties taken off, which will enable him to sell his cargo. This has led\r\nto discussions with the ministers, which give us a hope that we may get\r\nthe duties taken off in perpetuum. This done, a most abundant market for\r\nour oil will be opened by this country, and one which will be absolutely\r\ndependant on us; for they have little expectation themselves of\r\nestablishing a successful whale-fishery. It is possible they may\r\nonly take the duties off of those oils, which shall be the produce\r\nof associated companies of French and American merchants. But as yet,\r\nnothing certain can be said.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the trouble you have taken to obtain insurance on\r\nHoudon’s life. I place the thirty-two pounds and eleven shillings to\r\nyour credit, and not being able, as yet, to determine precisely how our\r\naccounts stand, I send a sum by Colonel Smith, which may draw the scales\r\ntowards a balance.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the British cabinet to make no equal treaty with\r\nus, confirms me in the opinion expressed in your letter of October the\r\n24th, that the United States must pass a navigation act against\r\nGreat Britain, and load her manufactures with duties, so as to give a\r\npreference to those of other countries: and I hope our Assemblies will\r\nwait no longer, but transfer such a power to Congress, at the sessions\r\nof this fall. I suppose, however, it will only be against Great Britain,\r\nand I think it will be right not to involve other nations in the\r\nconsequences of her injustice. I take for granted, that the commercial\r\nsystem wished for by Congress, was such a one, as should leave commerce\r\non the freest footing possible. This was the plan on which we prepared\r\nour general draught for treating with all nations. Of those with whom we\r\nwere to treat, I ever considered England, France, Spain, and Portugal\r\nas capitally important; the first two, on account of their American\r\npossessions, the last, for their European as well as American. Spain\r\nis treating in America, and probably will give an advantageous treaty.\r\nPortugal shows dispositions to do the same. France does not treat. It is\r\nlikely enough she will choose to keep the staff in her own hands. But,\r\nin the mean time, she gives us an access to her West Indies, which,\r\nthough not all we wish, is yet extremely valuable to us: this access,\r\nindeed, is much affected by the late _Arrêts_ of the 18th and 25th of\r\nSeptember, which I enclose to you. I consider these as a reprisal for\r\nthe navigation acts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The minister\r\nhas complained to me, officially, of these acts, as a departure from the\r\nreciprocity stipulated for by the treaty. I have assured him that his\r\ncomplaints shall be communicated to Congress, and in the mean time,\r\nobserved that the example of discriminating between foreigners and\r\nnatives had been set by the _Arrêt_ of August, 1784, and still more\r\nremarkably by those of September the 18th and 25th, which, in effect,\r\nare a prohibition of our fish in their islands. However, it is better\r\nfor us, that both sides should revise what they have done. I am in hopes\r\nthis country did not mean these as permanent regulations. Mr. Bingham,\r\nlately from Holland, tells me that the Dutch are much dissatisfied with\r\nthese acts. In fact, I expect the European nations, in general, will\r\nrise up against an attempt of this kind, and wage a general commercial\r\nwar against us. They can do well without all our commodities except\r\ntobacco, and we cannot find, elsewhere, markets for them. The\r\nselfishness of England alone will not justify our hazarding a contest of\r\nthis kind against all Europe. Spain, Portugal, and France, have not yet\r\nshut their doors against us: it will be time enough, when they do, to\r\ntake up the commercial hatchet. I hope, therefore, those States will\r\nrepeal their navigation clauses, except as against Great Britain and\r\nother nations not treating with us.\r\n\r\nI have made the inquiries you desire, as to American ship-timber for\r\nthis country. You know they sent some person (whose name was not told\r\nus) to America, to examine the quality of our masts, spars, &c. I think\r\nthis was young Chaumont’s business. They have, besides this, instructed\r\nthe officer who superintends their supplies of masts, spars, foe., to\r\nprocure good quantities from our northern States; but I think they have\r\nmade no contract: on the contrary, that they await the trials projected,\r\nbut with a determination to look to us for considerable supplies, if\r\nthey find our timber answer. They have on the carpet a contract for\r\nlive-oak from the southern States.\r\n\r\nYou ask why the Virginia merchants do not learn to sort their own\r\ntobaccos? They can sort them as well as any other merchants whatever.\r\nNothing is better known than the quality of every hogshead of tobacco,\r\nfrom the place of its growth. They know, too, the particular qualities\r\nrequired in every market. They do not send their tobaccos, therefore, to\r\nLondon to be sorted, but to pay their debts: and though they could send\r\nthem to other markets and remit the money to London, yet they find it\r\nnecessary to give their English merchant the benefit of the consignment\r\nof the tobacco (which is enormously gainful), in order to induce him to\r\ncontinue his indulgence for the balance due.\r\n\r\nIs it impossible to persuade our countrymen to make peace with the Nova\r\nScotians? I am persuaded nothing is wanting but advances on our part;\r\nand that it is in our power to draw off the greatest proportion of that\r\nsettlement, and thus to free ourselves from rivals who may become of\r\nconsequence. We are, at present, co-operating with Great Britain, whose\r\npolicy it is to give aliment to that bitter enmity between her States\r\nand ours, which may secure her against their ever joining us. But would\r\nnot the existence of a cordial friendship between us and them, be the\r\nbest bridle we could possibly put into the mouth of England?\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Danish business, you will observe that the\r\ninstructions of Congress, article 3, of October the 29th, 1783, put it\r\nentirely into the hands of the _Ministers Plenipotentiary of the United\r\nStates of America at the court of Versailles, empower to to negotiate\r\na peace, or to any one or more of them_. At that time, I did not come\r\nunder this description. I had received the permission of Congress to\r\ndecline coming, in the spring preceding that date. On the first day\r\nof November, 1783, that is to say, two days after the date of the\r\ninstructions to the commissioners, Congress recommended John Paul Jones\r\nto the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States, at Versailles, as\r\nagent, to solicit, under his direction, the payment of all prizes taken\r\nin Europe under his command. But the object under their view, at that\r\ntime, was assuredly the money due from the court of Versailles, for the\r\nprizes taken in the expedition by the Bon-homme Richard, the Alliance,\r\n&c. In this business, I have aided him effectually, having obtained\r\na definitive order for paying the money to him, and a considerable\r\nproportion being actually paid him. But they could not mean by their\r\nresolution of November the 1st, to take from the commissioners, powers\r\nwhich they had given them two days before. If there could remain a doubt\r\nthat this whole power has resulted to you, it would be cleared up by the\r\ninstructions of May the 7th, 1784, article 9, which declare, ‘that these\r\ninstructions be considered as supplementary to those of October the\r\n29th, 1783, and not as revoking, except where they contradict them;’\r\nwhich shows that they considered the instructions of October the 29th,\r\n1783, as still in full force. I do not give you the trouble of this\r\ndiscussion, to save myself the trouble of the negotiation. I should\r\nhave no objections to this part: but it is to avoid the impropriety of\r\nmeddling in a matter wherein I am unauthorized to act, and where any\r\nthing I should pretend to conclude with the court of Denmark, might\r\nhave the appearance of a deception on them. Should it be in my power to\r\nrender any service in it, I shall do it with cheerfulness; but I repeat,\r\nthat I think you are the only person authorized.\r\n\r\nI received, a few days ago, the _Nuova Minuta_ of Tuscany, which Colonel\r\nHumphreys will deliver you. I have been so engaged that I have not been\r\nable to go over it with any attention. I observe, in general, that the\r\norder of the articles is entirely deranged, and their diction almost\r\ntotally changed. When you shall have examined it, if you will be so good\r\nas to send me your observations by post, in cipher, I will communicate\r\nwith you in the same way, and try to mature this matter.\r\n\r\nThe deaths of the Dukes of Orleans and Praslin, will probably reach you\r\nthrough the channel of the public papers, before this letter does. Your\r\nfriends the Abbes are well, and always speak of you with affection.\r\nColonel Humphreys comes to pass some time in London. My curiosity\r\nwould render a short trip thither agreeable to me also, but I see no\r\nprobability of taking it. I will trouble you with my respects to Dr.\r\nPrice. Those to Mrs. Adams, I witness in a letter to herself.\r\n\r\nI am, with very great esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVI.--TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES, November 20, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.\r\n\r\nParis, November 20, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI found here, on my return from Fontainebleau, the letter of October the\r\n30th, which your Excellency did me the honor there of informing me had\r\nbeen addressed to me at this place; and I shall avail myself of the\r\nfirst occasion of transmitting it to Congress, who will receive, with\r\ngreat pleasure; these new assurances of the friendly sentiments, which\r\nhis Majesty is pleased to continue towards the United States.\r\n\r\nI am equally persuaded they will pay the most serious attention to that\r\npart of your Excellency’s letter, which mentions the information you\r\nhave received of certain acts or regulations of navigation and commerce,\r\npassed in some of the United States, which are injurious to the\r\ncommerce of France. In the mean time, I wish to remove the unfavorable\r\nimpressions which those acts seem to have made, as if they were a\r\ndeparture from the reciprocity of conduct, stipulated for by the treaty\r\nof February the 6th, 1776. The effect of that treaty is, to place each\r\nparty with the other, always on the footing of the most favored nation.\r\nBut those who framed the acts, probably did not consider the treaty as\r\nrestraining either from discriminating between foreigners and natives.\r\nYet this is the sole effect of these acts. The same opinion, as to\r\nthe meaning of the treaty, seems to have been entertained by this\r\ngovernment, both before and since the date of these acts. For the\r\n_Arrêt_ of the King’s Council, of August the 30th, 1784, furnished\r\nan example of such a discrimination between foreigners and natives,\r\nimporting salted fish into his Majesty’s dominions in the West Indies;\r\nby laying a duty on that imported, by foreigners, and giving out the\r\nsame, in bounty, to native importers. This opinion shows itself more\r\nremarkably in the late _Arrêts_ of the 18th and 25th of September,\r\nwhich, increasing to excess the duty on foreign importations of fish\r\ninto the West Indies, giving the double, in bounty, on those of\r\nnatives, and thereby rendering it impossible for the former to sell in\r\ncompetition with the latter, have, in effect, prohibited the importation\r\nof that article by the citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nBoth nations, perhaps, may come into the opinion, that their friendship\r\nand their interests may be better cemented, by approaching the condition\r\nof their citizens, reciprocally, to that of natives, as a better ground\r\nof intercourse than that of the most favored nation. I shall rest with\r\nhopes of being authorized, in due time, to inform your Excellency that\r\nnothing will be wanting, on our part, to evince a disposition to concur\r\nin revising whatever regulations may, on either side, bear hard on\r\nthe commerce of the other nation. In the mean time I have the honor to\r\nassure you of the profound respect and esteem, with which\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s\r\n\r\nmost obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVII.--TO LISTER ASQUITH, November 23, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LISTER ASQUITH.\r\n\r\nParis, November 23, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have received your letter of the 14th instant. It was not till the 8th\r\nof this month, that I could obtain information from any quarter, of\r\nthe particular court in which your prosecution was instituted, and the\r\nground on which it was founded. I then received it through the hands of\r\nMonsieur Desbordes, at Brest. I have sent to the Count de Vergennes\r\na statement of your case, of which the enclosed is a copy. I wish you\r\nwould read it over, and if there be any fact stated in it, which is\r\nwrong, let me know it, that I may have it corrected. I at the same time\r\nwrote him an urgent letter in your behalf. I have daily expected an\r\nanswer, which has occasioned my deferring writing to you. The moment I\r\nreceive one, you may be assured of my communicating it to you. My hopes\r\nare, that I may obtain from the King a discharge of the persons of all\r\nof you: but, probably, your vessel and cargo must go through a process.\r\nI have sincerely sympathized with your misfortunes, and have taken every\r\nstep in my power to get into the right line for obtaining relief. If it\r\nwill add any comfort to your situation and that of your companions, to\r\nbe assured that I never lose sight of your sufferings, and leave nothing\r\nundone to extricate you, you have that assurance. I am, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour very humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVIII.--TO JOHN ADAMS, November 27, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, November 27, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 5th came to hand yesterday, and Colonel Smith and\r\nColonel Humphreys (by whom you will receive one of the 19th from me)\r\nbeing to set out to-morrow, I hasten to answer it. I sincerely rejoice\r\nthat Portugal is stepping forward in the business of treaty, and that\r\nthere is a probability that we may at length do something under our\r\ncommissions, which may produce a solid benefit to our constituents. I as\r\nmuch rejoice, that it is not to be negotiated through the medium of the\r\ntorpid, uninformed machine, at first made use of. I conjecture, from\r\nyour relation of the conference with the Chevalier de Pinto, that he\r\nis well informed and sensible. So much the better. It is one of those\r\ncases, where the better the interests of the two parties are understood,\r\nthe broader will be the basis on which they will connect them.\r\n\r\nTo the very judicious observations on the subjects of the conference,\r\nwhich were made by you, I have little to add.\r\n\r\nFlour. It may be observed, that we can sell them the flour ready\r\nmanufactured, for much less than the wheat of which it is made. In\r\ncarrying to them wheat, we carry also the bran, which does not pay its\r\nown freight. In attempting to save and transport wheat to them, much is\r\nlost by the weavil, and much spoiled by heat in the hold of the vessel.\r\nThis loss must be laid on the wheat which gets safe to market, where\r\nit is paid for by the consumer. Now, this is much more than the cost of\r\nmanufacturing it with us, which would prevent that loss. I suppose the\r\ncost of manufacturing does not exceed seven per cent, on the value. But\r\nthe loss by the weavil, and other damage on ship-board, amount to much\r\nmore. Let them buy of us as much wheat as will make a hundred weight of\r\nflour. They will find that they have paid more for the wheat, than we\r\nshould have asked for the flour, besides having lost the labor of their\r\nmills in grinding it. The obliging us, therefore, to carry it to them in\r\nthe form of wheat, is a useless loss to both parties.\r\n\r\nIron. They will get none from us. We cannot make it in competition with\r\nSweden, or any other nation of Europe, where labor is so much cheaper.\r\n\r\nWines. The strength of the wines of Portugal will give them always an\r\nalmost exclusive possession of a country, where the summers are so\r\nhot as in America. The present demand will be very great, if they will\r\nenable us to pay for them; but if they consider the extent and rapid\r\npopulation of the United States, they must see that the time is not\r\ndistant, when they will not be able to make enough for us, and that it\r\nis of great importance to avail themselves of the prejudices already\r\nestablished in favor of their wines, and to continue them, by\r\nfacilitating the purchase. Let them do this, and they need not care for\r\nthe decline of their use in England. They will be independent of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSalt. I do not know where the northern States supplied themselves with\r\nsalt, but the southern ones took great quantities from Portugal.\r\n\r\nCotton and Wool. The southern States will take manufactures, of both:\r\nthe northern, will take both the manufactures and raw materials.\r\n\r\nEast India goods of every kind. Philadelphia and New York have begun a\r\ntrade to the East Indies. Perhaps Boston may follow their example. But\r\ntheir importations will be sold only to the country adjacent to them.\r\nFor a long time to come, the States south of the Delaware, will not\r\nengage in a direct commerce with the East Indies. They neither have nor\r\nwill have ships or seamen for their other commerce: nor will they buy\r\nEast India goods of the northern States. Experience shows that the\r\nStates never bought foreign goods of one another. The reasons are, that\r\nthey would, in so doing, pay double freight and charges; and again,\r\nthat they would have to pay mostly in cash, what they could obtain for\r\ncommodities in Europe. I know that the American merchants have looked,\r\nwith some anxiety, to the arrangements to be taken with Portugual, in\r\nexpectation that they could, through her, get their East India articles\r\non better and more convenient terms; and I am of opinion, Portugal will\r\ncome in for a good share of this traffic with the southern States, if\r\nthey facilitate our payments.\r\n\r\nCoffee. Can they not furnish us with this article from Brazil?\r\n\r\nSugar. The Brazil sugars are esteemed, with us, more than any other.\r\n\r\nChocolate. This article, when ready made, as also the cocoa, becomes\r\nso soon rancid, and the difficulties of getting it fresh, have been\r\nso great in America, that its use has spread but little. The way to\r\nincrease its consumption would be, to permit it to be brought to us\r\nimmediately from the country of its growth. By getting it good in\r\nquality, and cheap in price, the superiority of the article, both for\r\nhealth and nourishment, will soon give it the same preference over tea\r\nand coffee in America, which it has in Spain, where they can get it by a\r\nsingle voyage, and, of course, while it is sweet. The use of the sugars,\r\ncoffee, and cotton of Brazil, would also be much extended by a similar\r\nindulgence.\r\n\r\nGinger and spices from the Brazils, if they had the advantage of a\r\ndirect transportation, might take place of the same articles from the\r\nEast Indies.\r\n\r\nGinseng. We can furnish them with enough to supply their whole demand\r\nfor the East Indies.\r\n\r\nThey should be prepared to expect, that in the beginning of this\r\ncommerce, more money will be taken by us than after a while. The reasons\r\nare, that our heavy debt to Great Britain must be paid, before we\r\nshall be masters of our own returns; and again, that habits of using\r\nparticular things are produced only by time and practice.\r\n\r\nThat as little time as possible may be lost in this negotiation, I will\r\ncommunicate to you at once, my sentiments as to the alterations in the\r\ndraught sent them, which will probably be proposed by them, or which\r\nought to be proposed by us, noting only those articles.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. They will probably restrain us to their dominions in Europe.\r\nWe must expressly include the Azores, Madeiras, and Cape de Verde\r\nIslands, some of which are deemed to be in Africa. We should also\r\ncontend for an access to their possessions in America, according to the\r\ngradation in the 2nd article of our instructions, of May the 7th, 1784.\r\nBut if we can obtain it in no one of these forms, I am of opinion we\r\nshould give it up.\r\n\r\nArticle 4. This should be put into the form we gave it, in the draught\r\nsent you by Dr. Franklin and myself, for Great Britain. I think we had\r\nnot reformed this article, when we sent our draught to Portugal. You\r\nknow, the Confederation renders the reformation absolutely necessary; a\r\ncircumstance which had escaped us at first.\r\n\r\nArticle 9. Add, from the British draught, the clause about wrecks.\r\n\r\nArticle 13. The passage ‘nevertheless,’ &c. to run as in the British\r\ndraught.\r\n\r\nArticle 18. After the word ‘accident,’ insert ‘or wanting supplies of\r\nprovisions or other refreshments.’ And again, instead of ‘take refuge,’\r\ninsert ‘come,’ and after ‘of the other,’ insert ‘in any part of the\r\nworld.’ The object of this is to obtain leave for our whaling vessels\r\nto refit and refresh on the coast of the Brazils; an object of immense\r\nimportance to that class of our vessels. We must acquiesce under\r\nsuch modifications as they may think necessary for regulating this\r\nindulgence, in hopes to lessen them in time, and to get a pied a terre\r\nin that country.\r\n\r\nArticle 19. Can we get this extended to the Brazils? It would be\r\nprecious in case of war with Spain.\r\n\r\nArticle 23. Between ‘places’ and ‘whose,’ insert ‘and in general, all\r\nothers,’ as in the British draught.\r\n\r\nArticle 24. For ‘necessaries,’ substitute ‘comforts.’\r\n\r\nArticle 25. Add ‘but if any such consuls shall exercise commerce,’ &c.\r\nas in the British draught.\r\n\r\nWe should give to Congress as early notice as possible, of the\r\nre-institution of this negotiation; because, in a letter by a gentleman\r\nwho sailed from Havre, the 10th instant, I communicated to them the\r\nanswer of the Portuguese minister, through the ambassador here, which\r\nI sent to you. They may, in consequence, be making other arrangements,\r\nwhich might do injury. The little time which now remains, of the\r\ncontinuance of our commissions, should also be used with the Chevalier\r\nde Pinto, to hasten the movements of his court.\r\n\r\nBut all these preparations for trade with Portugal will fail in their\r\neffect, unless the depredations of the Algerines can be prevented. I am\r\nfar from confiding in the measures taken for this purpose. Very possibly\r\nwar must be recurred to. Portugal is at war with them. Suppose the\r\nChevalier de Pinto was to be sounded on the subject of an union of\r\nforce, and even a stipulation for contributing each a certain force,\r\nto be kept in constant cruise. Such a league once begun, other nations\r\nwould drop into it, one by one. If he should seem to approve it, it\r\nmight then be suggested to Congress, who, if they should be forced to\r\ntry the measure of war, would doubtless be glad of such an ally. As the\r\nPortuguese negotiation should be hastened, I suppose our communications\r\nmust often be trusted to the post, availing ourselves of the cover of\r\nour cipher.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIX.--TO COLONEL HUMPHREYS, December 4,1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\nParis, December 4,1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI enclose you a letter from Gatteaux, observing that there will be\r\nan anachronism, if, in making a medal to commemorate the victory of\r\nSaratoga, he puts on General Gates the insignia of the Cincinnati, which\r\ndid not exist at that date. I wrote him, in answer, that I thought so\r\ntoo, but that you had the direction of the business; that you were now\r\nin London; that I would write to you, and probably should have an answer\r\nwithin a fortnight; and that, in the mean time, he could be employed on\r\nother parts of the die. I supposed you might not have observed on the\r\nprint of General Gates, the insignia of the Cincinnati, or did not mean\r\nthat that particular should be copied. Another reason against it strikes\r\nme. Congress have studiously avoided giving to the public their sense of\r\nthis institution. Should medals be prepared, to be presented from them\r\nto certain officers, and bearing on them the insignia of the order, as\r\nthe presenting them would involve an approbation of the institution, a\r\nprevious question would be forced on them, whether they would present\r\nthese medals. I am of opinion it would be very disagreeable to them to\r\nbe placed under the necessity of making this declaration. Be so good as\r\nto let me know your wishes on this subject by the first post.\r\n\r\nMr. Short has been sick ever since you left us. Nothing new has occurred\r\nhere, since your departure. I imagine you have American news. If so,\r\npray give us some. Present me affectionately to Mr. Adams and the\r\nladies, and to Colonel Smith; and be assured of the esteem with which I\r\nam, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXL.--TO JOHN ADAMS, December 10, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS,\r\n\r\nParis, December 10, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of Mr. Boylston, I carried him to the Marquis de la\r\nFayette, who received from him communications of his object. This was to\r\nget a remission of the duties on his cargo of oil, and he was willing to\r\npropose a future contract. I suggested however to the Marquis, when\r\nwe were alone, that instead of wasting our efforts on individual\r\napplications, we had better take up the subject on general ground, and\r\nwhatever could be obtained, let it be common to all. He concurred with\r\nme. As the jealousy of office between ministers does not permit me to\r\napply immediately to the one in whose department this was, the Marquis’s\r\nagency was used. The result was to put us on the footing of the\r\nHanseatic towns, as to whale-oil, and to reduce the duties to eleven\r\nlivres and five sols for five hundred and twenty pounds French, which is\r\nvery nearly two livres on the English hundred weight, or about a guinea\r\nand a half the ton. But the oil must be brought in American or French\r\nships, and the indulgence is limited to one year. However, as to this, I\r\nexpressed to Count de Vergennes my hopes that it would be continued; and\r\nshould a doubt arise, I should propose, at the proper time, to claim\r\nit under the treaty on the footing _gentis amicissimæ_. After all, I\r\nbelieve Mr. Boylston has failed of selling to Sangrain, and from what I\r\nlearn, through a little too much hastiness of temper. Perhaps they may\r\nyet come together, or he may sell to somebody else.\r\n\r\nWhen the general matter was thus arranged, a Mr. Barrett arrived here\r\nfrom Boston, with letters of recommendation from Governor Bowdoin,\r\nGushing, and others. His errand was to get the whale business here\r\nput on a general bottom, instead of the particular one which had been\r\nsettled, you know, the last year, for a special company. We told him\r\nwhat was done. He thinks it will answer, and proposes to settle at\r\nL’Orient for conducting the sales of the oil and the returns. I hope,\r\ntherefore, that this matter is tolerably well fixed, as far as the\r\nconsumption of this country goes. I know not as yet to what amount that\r\nis; but shall endeavor to find out how much they consume, and how much\r\nthey furnish themselves. I propose to Mr. Barrett, that he should induce\r\neither his State, or individuals, to send a sufficient number of boxes\r\nof the spermaceti candle to give one to every leading house in Paris;\r\nI mean to those who lead the ton: and at the same time to deposite a\r\nquantity for sale here, and advertise them in the _petites affiches_.\r\nI have written to Mr. Carmichael to know on what footing the use and\r\nintroduction of the whale-oil is there, or can be placed.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very sincere esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLI.--TO JOHN ADAMS, December 11, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, December 11, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nBaron Polnitz not going off till to-day enables me to add some\r\ninformation which I received from Mr. Barclay this morning. You know\r\nthe immense amount of Beaumarchais’ accounts with the United States,\r\nand that Mr. Barclay was authorized to settle them. Beaumarchais had\r\npertinaciously insisted on settling them with Congress. Probably he\r\nreceived from them a denial: for just as Mr. Barclay was about to\r\nset out on the journey we destined him, Beaumarchais tendered him a\r\nsettlement. It was thought best not to refuse this, and that it would\r\nproduce a very short delay. However, it becomes long, and Mr. Barclay\r\nthinks it will occupy him all this month. The importance of the account,\r\nand a belief that nobody can settle it so well as Mr. Barclay, who is\r\nintimately acquainted with most of the articles, induce me to think we\r\nmust yield to this delay. Be so good as to give me your opinion on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very great esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLII.--TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES, December 21, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.\r\n\r\nParis, December 21, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have received this moment a letter, of which I have the honor to\r\nenclose your Excellency a copy. It is on the case of Asquith and others,\r\ncitizens of the United States, in whose behalf I had taken the liberty\r\nof asking your interference. I understand by this letter, that they have\r\nbeen condemned to lose their vessel and cargo, and to pay six thousand\r\nlivres and the costs of the prosecution before the 25th instant, or\r\nto go to the galleys. This payment being palpably impossible to men\r\nin their situation, and the execution of the judgment pressing, I am\r\nobliged to trouble your Excellency again, by praying, if the government\r\ncan admit any mitigation of their sentence, it may be extended to them\r\nin time to save their persons from its effect.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very great respect, your Excellency’s most\r\nobedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIII.--TO THE GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA, December 22, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA.\r\n\r\nParis, December 22, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe death of the late General Oglethorpe, who had considerable\r\npossessions in Georgia, has given rise, as we understand, to questions\r\nwhether these possessions have become the property of the State, or have\r\nbeen transferred by his will to his widow, or descended on the nearest\r\nheir capable in law of taking them. In the latter case, the Chevalier de\r\nMezieres, a subject of France, stands foremost, as being made capable\r\nof the inheritance by the treaty between this country and the United\r\nStates. Under the regal government, it was the practice with us, when\r\nlands passed to the crown by escheat or forfeiture, to grant them to\r\nsuch relation of the party as stood on the fairest ground. This was even\r\na chartered right in some of the States. The practice has been continued\r\namong them, as deeming that the late Revolution should in no instance\r\nabridge the rights of the people. Should this have been the practice\r\nin the State of Georgia, or should they in any instance think proper\r\nto admit it, I am persuaded none will arise in which it will be\r\nmore expedient to do it, than in the present, and that no person’s\r\nexpectations should be fairer than those of the Chevalier de Mezieres.\r\nHe is the nephew of General Oglethorpe, he is of singular personal\r\nmerit, an officer of rank, of high connections, and patronized by\r\nthe ministers. His case has drawn their attention, and seems to be\r\nconsidered as protected by the treaty of alliance, and as presenting a\r\ntrial of our regard to that. Should these lands be considered as having\r\npassed to the State, I take the liberty of recommending him to the\r\nlegislature of Georgia, as worthy of their generosity, and as presenting\r\nan opportunity of proving the favorable dispositions which exist\r\nthroughout America towards the subjects of this country, and an\r\nopportunity too, which will probably be known and noted here.\r\n\r\nIn the several views, therefore, of personal merit, justice, generosity\r\nand policy, I presume to recommend the Chevalier de Mezieres, and his\r\ninterests, to the notice and patronage of your Excellency, whom the\r\nchoice of your country has sufficiently marked as possessing the\r\ndispositions, while it has at the same time given you the power, to\r\nbefriend just claims. The Chevalier de Mezieres will pass over to\r\nGeorgia in the ensuing spring; but should he find an opportunity, he\r\nwill probably forward this letter sooner. I have the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of the most profound respect,\r\n\r\nyour Excellency’s most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIV.--TO THE GEORGIA DELEGATES IN CONGRESS, Dec. 22, 1785\r\n\r\nTO THE GEORGIA DELEGATES IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nParis, December 22, 1785.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nBy my despatch to Mr. Jay which accompanies this, you will perceive\r\nthat the claims of the Chevalier de Mezieres, nephew to the late General\r\nOglethorpe, to his possessions within your State, have attracted the\r\nattention of the ministry here; and that considering them as protected\r\nby their treaty with us, they have viewed as derogatory of that, the\r\ndoubts which have been expressed on the subject. I have thought it best\r\nto present to them those claims in the least favorable point of view,\r\nto lessen as much as possible the ill effects of a disappointment: but\r\nI think it my duty to ask your notice and patronage of this case, as\r\none whose decision will have an effect on the general interests of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier de Mezieres is nephew to General Oglethorpe; he is a\r\nperson of great estimation, powerfully related and protected. His\r\ninterests are espoused by those whom it is our interest to gratify. I\r\nwill take the liberty, therefore, of soliciting your recommendations of\r\nhim to the generosity of your legislature, and to the patronage and good\r\noffices of your friends, whose efforts, though in a private case, will\r\ndo a public good. The pecuniary advantages of confiscation, in this\r\ninstance, cannot compensate its ill effects. It is difficult to make\r\nforeigners understand those legal distinctions between the effects of\r\nforfeiture of escheat, and of conveyance, on which the professors of\r\nthe law might build their opinions in this case. They can see only the\r\noutlines of the case; to wit, the death of a possessor of lands lying\r\nwithin the United States, leaving an heir in France, and the State\r\nclaiming those lands in opposition to the heir. An individual thinking\r\nhimself injured makes more noise than a State. Perhaps too, in every\r\ncase which either party to a treaty thinks to be within its provisions,\r\nit is better not to weigh the syllables and letters of the treaty, but\r\nto show that gratitude and affection render that appeal unnecessary. I\r\ntake the freedom, therefore, of submitting to your wisdom the motives\r\nwhich present themselves in favor of a grant to the Chevalier de\r\nMezieres, and the expediency of urging them on your State as far as you\r\nmay think proper.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect,\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLV.--TO JOHN ADAMS, December 27, 1785\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, December 27, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favors of the 13th and 20th were put into my hands today. This will\r\nbe delivered to you by Mr. Dalrymple, secretary to the legation of Mr.\r\nCrawford. I do not know whether you were acquainted with him here. He\r\nis a young man of learning and candor, and exhibits a phenomenon I never\r\nbefore met with, that is, a republican born on the north side of the\r\nTweed.\r\n\r\nYou have been consulted in the case of the Chevalier de Mezieres, nephew\r\nto General Oglethorpe, and are understood to have given an opinion\r\nderogatory of our treaty with France. I was also consulted, and\r\nunderstood in the same way. I was of opinion the Chevalier had no right\r\nto the estate, and as he had determined the treaty gave him a right, I\r\nsuppose he made the inference for me, that the treaty was of no weight.\r\nThe Count de Vergennes mentioned it to me in such a manner, that I\r\nfound it was necessary to explain the case to him, and show him that\r\nthe treaty had nothing to do with it. I enclose you a copy of the\r\nexplanation I delivered him.\r\n\r\nMr. Boylston sold his cargo to an agent of Monsieur Sangrain. He got for\r\nit fifty-five livres the hundred weight. I do not think that his being\r\njoined to a company here would contribute to its success. His capital is\r\nnot wanting. Le Conteux has agreed that the merchants of Boston, sending\r\nwhale-oil here, may draw-on him for a certain proportion of money, only\r\ngiving such a time in their drafts, as will admit the actual arrival of\r\nthe oil into a port of France for his security. Upon these drafts, Mr.\r\nBarrett is satisfied they will be able to raise money to make their\r\npurchases in America. The duty is seven livres and ten sols on the\r\nbarrel of five hundred and twenty pounds French, and ten sous on\r\nevery livre, which raises it to eleven livres and five sols, the sum I\r\nmentioned to you. France uses between five and six millions of pounds’\r\nweight French, which is between three and four thousand tons English.\r\nTheir own fisheries do not furnish one million, and there is no\r\nprobability of their improving. Sangrain purchases himself upwards of\r\na million. He tells me our oil is better than the Dutch or English,\r\nbecause we make it fresh; whereas they cut up the whale, and bring it\r\nhome to be made, so that it is by that time entered into fermentation.\r\nMr. Barrett says, that fifty livres the hundred weight will pay the\r\nprime cost and duties, and leave a profit of sixteen per cent, to the\r\nmerchant. I hope that England will, within a year or two, be obliged to\r\ncome here to buy whale-oil for her lamps.\r\n\r\nI like as little as you do, to have the gift of appointments. I hope\r\nCongress will not transfer the appointment of their consuls to their\r\nministers. But if they do, Portugal is more naturally under the\r\nsuperintendence of the minister at Madrid, and still more naturally\r\nunder that of the minister at Lisbon, where it is clear they ought to\r\nhave one. If all my hopes fail, the letters of Governor Bowdoin and\r\nGushing, in favor of young Mr. Warren, and your more detailed testimony\r\nin his behalf, are not likely to be opposed by evidence of equal weight,\r\nin favor of any other. I think with you, too, that it is for the public\r\ninterest to encourage sacrifices and services, by rewarding them, and\r\nthat they should weigh to a certain point, in the decision between\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\nI am sorry for the illness of the Chevalier Pinto. I think that treaty\r\nimportant: and the moment to urge it, is that of a treaty between France\r\nand England.\r\n\r\nLambe, who left this place the 6th of November, was at Madrid the 10th\r\nof this month. Since his departure, Mr. Barclay has discovered that no\r\ncopies of the full powers were furnished to himself, nor of course to\r\nLambe. Colonel Franks has prepared copies, which I will endeavor to get,\r\nto send by this conveyance for your attestation: which you will be so\r\ngood as to send back by the first safe conveyance, and I will forward\r\nthem. Mr. Barclay and Colonel Franks being at this moment at St.\r\nGermain, I am not sure of getting the papers in time to go by Mr.\r\nDalrymple. In that case, I will send them by Mr. Bingham.\r\n\r\nBe so good as to present me affectionately to Mrs. and Miss Adams, to\r\nColonels Smith and Humphreys, and accept assurances of the esteem with\r\nwhich I am, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVI.--TO JOHN JAY, January 2,1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nParis, January 2,1786\r\n\r\nSeveral conferences and letters having passed between the Count de\r\nVergennes and myself, on the subject of the commerce of this country\r\nwith the United States, I think them sufficiently interesting to be\r\ncommunicated to Congress. They are stated in the form of a report,\r\nand are herein enclosed. The length of this despatch, perhaps, needs\r\napology. Yet I have not been able to abridge it, without omitting\r\ncircumstances which I thought Congress would rather choose to know.\r\nSome of the objects of these conferences present but small hopes for the\r\npresent, but they seem to admit a possibility of success at some future\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     [The following is an extract from the report referred to in\r\n     the preceding letter, embracing every thing interesting\r\n     therein, not communicated to the reader in the previous\r\n     correspondence.]\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe next levee day at Versailles, I meant to bring again under the\r\nview of the Count de Vergennes, the whole subject of our commerce with\r\nFrance; but the number of audiences of ambassadors and other ministers,\r\nwhich take place, of course, before mine, and which seldom, indeed,\r\nleave me an opportunity of audience at all, prevented me that day. I was\r\nonly able to ask of the Count de Vergennes, as a particular favor, that\r\nhe would permit me to wait on him some day that week. He did so, and I\r\nwent to Versailles the Friday following, (the 9th of December.) M.\r\nde Reyneval was with the Count. Our conversation began with the usual\r\ntopic; that the trade of the United States had not yet learned the way\r\nto France, but continued to centre in England, though no longer obliged\r\nby law to go there. I observed, that the real cause of this was to\r\nbe found in the difference of the commercial arrangements in the two\r\ncountries; that merchants would not, and could not, trade but where\r\nthere was to be some gain; that the commerce between two countries could\r\nnot be kept up, but by an exchange of commodities; that, if an American\r\nmerchant was forced to carry his produce to London, it could not be\r\nexpected he would make a voyage from thence to France, with the money,\r\nto lay it out here; and, in like manner, that if he could bring his\r\ncommodities with advantage to this country, he would not make another\r\nvoyage to England, with the money, to lay it out there, but would take\r\nin exchange the merchandise of this country. The Count de Vergennes\r\nagreed to this, and particularly, that where there was no exchange of\r\nmerchandise, there could be no durable commerce; and that it was natural\r\nfor merchants to take their returns in the port where they sold their\r\ncargo. I desired his permission then, to take a summary view of the\r\nproductions of the United States, that we might see which of them could\r\nbe brought here to advantage.\r\n\r\n1. Rice. France gets from the Mediterranean a rice not so good indeed,\r\nbut cheaper than ours. He said that they bought of our rice, but that\r\nthey got from Egypt, also, rice of a very fine quality. I observed that\r\nsuch was the actual state of their commerce in that article, that\r\nthey take little from us. 2. Indigo. They make a plenty in their own\r\ncolonies. He observed that they did, and that they thought it better\r\nthan ours. 3. Flour, fish, and provisions of all sorts, they produce for\r\nthemselves. That these articles might, therefore, be considered as not\r\nexisting, for commerce, between the United States and the kingdom of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nI proceeded to those capable of becoming objects of exchange between\r\nthe two nations. 1. Peltry and furs. Our posts being in the hands of the\r\nEnglish, we are cut off from that article. I am not sure even, whether\r\nwe are not obliged to buy of them, for our own use. When these posts\r\nare given up, if ever they are, we shall be able to furnish France with\r\nskins and furs, to the amount of two millions of livres, in exchange for\r\nher merchandise: but, at present, these articles are to be counted as\r\nnothing. 2. Potash. An experiment is making whether this can be brought\r\nhere. We hope it may, but at present it stands for nothing. He observed\r\nthat it was much wanted in France, and he thought it would succeed. 3.\r\nNaval stores. Trials are also making on these, as subjects of commerce\r\nwith France. They are heavy, and the voyage long. The result, therefore,\r\nis doubtful. At present, they are as nothing in our commerce with this\r\ncountry. 4. Whale-oil: I told him I had great hopes, that the late\r\ndiminution of duty would enable us to bring this article with advantage,\r\nto France: that a merchant was just arrived (Mr. Barrett), who proposed\r\nto settle at L’Orient, for the purpose of selling the cargoes of this\r\narticle, and choosing the returns. That he had informed me, that in the\r\nfirst year, it would be necessary to take one third in money, and\r\nthe remainder only in merchandise; because the fishermen require,\r\nindispensably, some money. But he thought that after the first year,\r\nthe merchandise of the preceding year would always produce money for\r\nthe ensuing one, and that the whole amount would continue to be taken\r\nannually afterwards, in merchandise. I added, that though the diminution\r\nof duty was expressed to be but for one year, yet I hoped they would\r\nfind their advantage in renewing and continuing it: for that if they\r\nintended really to admit it for one year only, the fishermen would not\r\nfind it worth while to rebuild their vessels and to prepare themselves\r\nfor the business. The Count expressed satisfaction on the view of\r\ncommercial exchange held up by this article. He made no answer as to the\r\ncontinuance of it; and I did not choose to tell him, at that time, that\r\nwe should claim its continuance under their treaty with the Hanseatic\r\ntowns, which fixes this duty for them, and our own treaty, which gives\r\nus the rights of the most favored nation. 5. Tobacco. I recalled to the\r\nmemory of the Count de Vergennes the letter I had written to him on\r\nthis article; and the object of the present conversation being, how\r\nto facilitate the exchange of commerciable articles between the two\r\ncountries, I pressed that of tobacco in this point of view; observed\r\nthat France, at present, paid us two millions of livres for this\r\narticle; that for such portions of it as were bought in London, they\r\nsent the money directly there, and for what they bought in the United\r\nStates, the money was still remitted to London, by bills of exchange:\r\nwhereas, if thy would permit our merchants to sell this article\r\nfreely, they would bring it here, and take the returns on the spot,\r\nin merchandise, not money. The Count observed, that my proposition\r\ncontained what was doubtless useful, but that the King received on this\r\narticle, at present, a revenue of twenty-eight millions, which was so\r\nconsiderable, as to render them fearful of tampering with it; that the\r\ncollection of this revenue by way of Farm, was of very ancient date, and\r\nthat it was always hazardous to alter arrangements of long standing, and\r\nof such infinite combinations with the fiscal system. I answered, that\r\nthe simplicity of the mode of collection proposed for this article,\r\nwithdrew it from all fear of deranging other parts of their system; that\r\nI supposed they would confine the importation to some of their principal\r\nports, probably not more than five or six; that a single collector in\r\neach of these, was the only new officer requisite; that he could get\r\nrich himself on six livres a hogshead, and would receive the whole\r\nrevenue, and pay it into the treasury, at short hand. M. de Reyneval\r\nentered particularly into this part of the conversation, and explained\r\nto the Count, more in detail, the advantages and simplicity of it, and\r\nconcluded by observing to me, that it sometimes happened that useful\r\npropositions, though not practicable at one time, might become so at\r\nanother. I told him that that consideration had induced me to press the\r\nmatter when I did, because I had understood the renewal of the Farm was\r\nthen on the carpet, and that it was the precise moment, when I supposed\r\nthat this portion might be detached from the mass of the Farms. I asked\r\nthe Count de Vergennes whether, if the renewal of the Farm was pressing,\r\nthis article might not be separated, merely in suspense, till government\r\nshould have time to satisfy themselves on the expediency of renewing it.\r\nHe said no promise could be made.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this conversation, he had mentioned the liberty we\r\nenjoyed of carrying our fish to the French islands. I repeated to\r\nhim what I had hinted in my letter of November the 20th, 1785, that I\r\nconsidered as a prohibition, the laying such duties on our fish, and\r\ngiving such premiums on theirs, as made a difference between their and\r\nour fishermen of fifteen livres the quintal, in an article which sold\r\nfor but fifteen livres. He said it would not have that effect, for two\r\nreasons. 1. That their fishermen could not furnish supplies sufficient\r\nfor their islands, and, of course, the inhabitants must, of necessity,\r\nbuy our fish. 2. That from the constancy of our fishery, and the short\r\nseason during which theirs continued, and also from the economy and\r\nmanagement of ours, compared with the expense of theirs, we had always\r\nbeen able to sell our fish, in their islands, at twenty-five livres the\r\nquintal, while they were obliged to ask thirty-six livres. (I suppose he\r\nmeant the livre of the French islands.) That thus, the duty and premium\r\nhad been a necessary operation on their side, to place the sale of their\r\nfish on a level with ours, and, that without this, theirs could not bear\r\nthe competition.\r\n\r\nI have here brought together the substance of what was said on the\r\npreceding subjects, not pretending to give it verbatim, which my memory\r\ndoes not enable me to do. I have, probably, omitted many things\r\nwhich were spoken, but have mentioned nothing which was not. I was\r\ninterrupted, at times, with collateral matters. One of these was\r\nimportant. The Count de Vergennes complained, and with a good deal of\r\nstress, that they did not find a sufficient dependence on arrangements\r\ntaken with us. This was the third time, too, he had done it; first, in\r\na conversation at Fontainebleau, when he first complained to me of the\r\nnavigation acts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire; secondly, in his\r\nletter of October the 30th, 1785, on the same subject; and now, in the\r\npresent conversation, wherein he added, as another instance, the case\r\nof the Chevalier de Mezieres, heir of General Oglethorpe, who,\r\nnotwithstanding that the 11th article of the treaty provides, that the\r\nsubjects or citizens of either party shall succeed, _ab intestato_, to\r\nthe lands of their ancestors, within the dominions of the other,\r\nhad been informed from Mr. Adams, and by me also, that his right of\r\nsuccession to the General’s estate in Georgia was doubtful. He observed\r\ntoo, that the administration of justice with us was tardy, insomuch,\r\nthat their merchants, when they had money due to them within our States,\r\nconsidered it as desperate; and, that our commercial regulations, in\r\ngeneral, were disgusting to them. These ideas were new, serious, and\r\ndelicate. I decided, therefore, not to enter into them at that moment,\r\nand the rather, as we were speaking in French, in which language I\r\ndid not choose to hazard myself. I withdrew from the objections of the\r\ntardiness of justice with us, and the disagreeableness of our commercial\r\nregulations, by a general observation, that I was not sensible they were\r\nwell founded. With respect to the case of the Chevalier de Mezieres, I\r\nwas obliged to enter into some explanations. They related chiefly to\r\nthe legal operation of our Declaration of Independence, to the undecided\r\nquestion whether our citizens and British subjects were thereby made\r\naliens to one another, to the general laws as to conveyances of land to\r\naliens, and the doubt, whether an act of the Assembly of Georgia might\r\nnot have been passed, to confiscate General Oglethorpe’s property,\r\nwhich would of course prevent its devolution on any heir. M. Reyneval\r\nobserved, that in this case, it became a mere question of fact, whether\r\na confiscation of these lands had taken place before the death of\r\nGeneral Oglethorpe, which fact might be easily known by, inquiries in\r\nGeorgia, where the possessions lay. I thought it very material, that\r\nthe opinion of this court should be set to rights on these points. On\r\nmy return, therefore, I wrote the following observations on them,\r\nwhich, the next time I went to Versailles (not having an opportunity\r\nof speaking to the Count de Vergennes), I put into the hands of M.\r\nReyneval, praying him to read them, and to ask the favor of the Count to\r\ndo the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Explanations on some of the subjects of the conversation, which I had\r\nthe honor of having with his Excellency, the Count de Vergennes, when I\r\nwas last at Versailles_.\r\n\r\nThe principal design of that conversation was, to discuss, those\r\narticles of commerce which the United States could spare, which are\r\nwanted in France, and, if received there on a convenient footing, would\r\nbe exchanged for the productions of France. But in the course of the\r\nconversation, some circumstances were incidentally mentioned by\r\nthe Count de Vergennes, which induced me to suppose he had received\r\nimpressions, neither favorable to us, nor derived from perfect\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Chevalier de Mezieres was supposed to furnish an\r\ninstance of our disregard to treatises; and the event of that case was\r\ninferred from opinions supposed to have been given by Mr. Adams and\r\nmyself. This is ascribing a weight to our opinions, to which they are\r\nnot entitled. They will have no influence on the decision of the case.\r\nThe judges in our courts would not suffer them to be read. Their guide\r\nis the law of the land, of which law its treaties make a part. Indeed, I\r\nknow not what opinion Mr. Adams may have given on the case. And, if any\r\nbe imputed to him derogatory of our regard to the treaty with France,\r\nI think his opinion has been misunderstood. With respect to myself, the\r\ndoubts which I expressed to the Chevalier de Mezieres, as to the success\r\nof his claims, were not founded on any question whether the treaty\r\nbetween France and the United States would be observed. On the contrary,\r\nI venture to pronounce that it will be religiously observed, if his case\r\ncomes under it. But I doubted whether it would come under the treaty.\r\nThe case, as I understand it, is this. General Oglethorpe, a British\r\nsubject, had lands in Georgia. He died since the peace, having devised\r\nthese lands to his wife. His heirs are the Chevalier de Mezieres, son\r\nof his eldest sister, and the Marquis de Bellegarde, son of his younger\r\nsister. This case gives rise to legal questions, some of which have\r\nnot yet been decided, either in England or America, the laws of which\r\ncountries are nearly the same.\r\n\r\n1. It is a question under the laws of those countries, whether persons\r\nborn before their separation, and once completely invested, in both,\r\nwith the character of natural subjects, can ever become aliens in\r\neither? There are respectable opinions on both sides. If the negative be\r\nright, then General Oglethorpe having never become an alien, and having\r\ndevised his lands to his wife, who, on this supposition, also, was not\r\nan alien, the devise has transferred the lands to her, and there is\r\nnothing left for the treaty to operate on.\r\n\r\n2. If the affirmative opinion be right, and the inhabitants of Great\r\nBritain and America, born before the Revolution, are become aliens to\r\neach other, it follows by the laws of both, that the lands which either\r\npossessed, within the jurisdiction of the other, became the property of\r\nthe State in which they are. But a question arises, whether the transfer\r\nof the property took place on the Declaration of Independence, or not\r\ntill an office, or an act of Assembly, had declared the transfer. If the\r\nproperty passed to the State on the Declaration of Independence, then it\r\ndid not remain in General Oglethorpe, and, of course, at the time of his\r\ndeath, he having nothing, there was nothing to pass to his heirs, and so\r\nnothing for the treaty to operate on.\r\n\r\n3. If the property does not pass till declared by an office found by\r\njury, or an act passed by the Assembly, the question then is, whether\r\nan office had been found, or an act of Assembly been passed for that\r\npurpose, before the peace. If there was, the lands had passed to the\r\nState during his life, and nothing being left in him, there is nothing\r\nfor his heirs to claim under the treaty.\r\n\r\n4. If the property had not been transferred to the State, before the\r\npeace, either by the Declaration of Independence, or an office or an act\r\nof Assembly, then it remained in General Oglethorpe at the epoch of the\r\npeace and it will be insisted, no doubt, that, by the sixth article of\r\nthe treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain, which\r\nforbids future confiscations, General Oglethorpe acquired a capacity of\r\nholding and of conveying his lands. He has conveyed them to his wife.\r\nBut, she being an alien, it will be decided by the laws of the land,\r\nwhether she took them for her own use, or for the use of the State. For\r\nit is a general principle of our law, that conveyances to aliens pass\r\nthe lands to the State; and it may be urged, that though, by the treaty\r\nof peace, General Oglethorpe could convey, yet that treaty did not mean\r\nto give him a greater privilege of conveyance, than natives hold, to\r\nwit, a privilege of transferring the property to persons incapable, by\r\nlaw, of taking it. However, this would be a question between the State\r\nof Georgia and the widow of General Oglethorpe, in the decision of which\r\nthe Chevalier de Mezieres is not interested, because, whether she takes\r\nthe land by the will, for her own use, or for that of the State, it is\r\nequally prevented from descending to him: there is neither a conveyance\r\nto him, nor a succession _ab intestato_ devolving on him, which are the\r\ncases provided for by our treaty with France. To sum up the matter in\r\na few words; if the lands had passed to the State before the epoch of\r\npeace, the heirs of General Oglethorpe cannot say they have descended\r\non them, and if they remained in the General at that epoch, the treaty\r\nsaving them to him, he could convey them away from his heirs, and he has\r\nconveyed them to his widow, either for her own use, or for that of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nSeeing no event, in which, according to the facts stated to me, the\r\ntreaty could be applied to this case, or could give any right, whatever,\r\nto the heirs of General Oglethorpe, I advised the Chevalier de Mezieres\r\nnot to urge his pretensions on the footing of right, nor under the\r\ntreaty, but to petition the Assembly of Georgia for a grant of these\r\nlands. If, in the question between the State and the widow of General\r\nOglethorpe, it should be decided that they were the property of the\r\nState, I expected from their generosity, and the friendly dispositions\r\nin America towards the subjects of France, that they would be favorable\r\nto the Chevalier de Mezieres. There is nothing in the preceding\r\nobservations, which would not have applied against the heir of General\r\nOgiethorpe, had he been a native citizen of Georgia, as it now applies\r\nagainst him, being a subject of France. The treaty has placed the\r\nsubjects of France on a footing with natives, as to conveyances and\r\ndescent of property. There was no occasion for the assemblies to pass\r\nlaws on this subject; the treaty being a law, as I conceive, superior to\r\nthose of particular Assemblies, and repealing them where they stand in\r\nthe way of its operations.\r\n\r\nThe supposition that the treaty was disregarded on our part, in the\r\ninstance of the acts of Assembly of Massachusetts and New Hampshire,\r\nwhich made a distinction between natives and foreigners, as to the\r\nduties to be paid on commerce, was taken notice of in the letter of\r\nNovember the 20th, which I had the honor of addressing to the Count de\r\nVergennes. And while I express my hopes, that, on a revision of these\r\nsubjects, nothing will be found in them derogatory from either the\r\nletter or spirit of our treaty, I will add assurances that the United\r\nStates will not be behind hand, in going beyond both, when occasions\r\nshall ever offer of manifesting their sincere attachment to this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI will pass on to the observation, that our commercial regulations\r\nare difficult and repugnant to the French merchants. To detail these\r\nregulations minutely, as they exist in every State, would be beyond my\r\ninformation. A general view of them, however, will suffice because the\r\nStates differ little in their several regulations. On the arrival of a\r\nship in America, her cargo must be reported at the proper office. The\r\nduties on it are to be paid. These are commonly from two and a half to\r\nfive per cent, on its value. On many articles, the value of which is\r\ntolerably uniform, the precise sum is fixed by law. A tariff of these is\r\npresented to the importer, and he can see what he has to pay, as well as\r\nthe officer. For other articles, the duty is such a per cent, on their\r\nvalue. That value is either shown by the invoice, or by the oath of the\r\nimporter. This operation being once over, and it is a very short one,\r\nthe goods are considered as entered, and may then pass through the whole\r\nthirteen States, without their being ever more subject to a question,\r\nunless they be re-shipped. Exportation is still more simple: because,\r\nas we prohibit the exportation of nothing, and very rarely lay a duty\r\non any article of export, the State is little interested in examining\r\noutward bound vessels. The captain asks a clearance for his own\r\npurposes. As to the operations of internal commerce, such as matters of\r\nexchange, of buying, selling, bartering, &c, our laws are the same as\r\nthe English. If they have been altered in any instance, it has been\r\nto render them more simple. Lastly, as to the tardiness of the\r\nadministration of justice with us, it would be equally tedious and\r\nimpracticable for me to give a precise account of it in every State. But\r\nI think it probable, that it is much on the same footing through all\r\nthe States, and that an account of it in any one of them, may found a\r\ngeneral presumption of it in the others. Being best acquainted with its\r\nadministration in Virginia, I shall confine myself to that. Before the\r\nRevolution, a judgment could not be obtained under eight years, in the\r\nsupreme court, where the suit was in the department of the common law,\r\nwhich department embraces about nine tenths of the subjects of legal\r\ncontestation. In that of the chancery, from twelve to twenty years were\r\nrequisite. This did not proceed from any vice in the laws, but from the\r\nindolence of the judges appointed by the King: and these judges holding\r\ntheir offices during his will only, he could have reformed the evil at\r\nany time. This reformation was among the first works of the legislature,\r\nafter our independence. A judgment can now be obtained in the supreme\r\ncourt, in one year, at the common law, and in about three years, in the\r\nchancery. But more particularly to protect the commerce of France, which\r\nat that moment was considerable with us, a law was passed, giving\r\nall suits wherein a foreigner was a party, a privilege to be tried\r\nimmediately, on the return of his process, without waiting till those\r\nof natives, which stand before them, shall have been decided on. Out of\r\nthis act, however, the British stand excluded by a subsequent one. This,\r\nwith its causes, must be explained. The British army, after ravaging\r\nthe State of Virginia, had sent off a very great number of slaves to New\r\nYork. By the seventh article of the treaty of peace, they stipulated\r\nnot to carry away any of these. Notwithstanding this, it was known, when\r\nthey were evacuating New York, that they were carrying away the slaves.\r\nGeneral Washington made an official demand of Sir Guy Carleton, that he\r\nshould cease to send them away. He answered, that these people had come\r\nto them under promise of the King’s protection, and that that promise\r\nshould be fulfilled, in preference to the stipulation in the treaty. The\r\nState of Virginia, to which nearly the whole of these slaves belonged,\r\npassed a law to forbid the recovery of debts due to British subjects.\r\nThey declared, at the same time, they would repeal the law, if Congress\r\nwere of opinion they ought to do it. But, desirous that their citizens\r\nshould be discharging their debts, they afterwards permitted British\r\ncreditors to prosecute their suits, and to receive their debts in seven\r\nequal and annual payments; relying that the demand for the slaves would\r\neither be admitted or denied, in time to lay their hands on some of\r\nthe latter payments for reimbursement. The immensity of this debt was\r\nanother reason for forbidding such a mass of property to be offered for\r\nsale under execution at once, as, from the small quantity of circulating\r\nmoney, it must have sold for little or nothing, whereby the creditor\r\nwould have failed to receive his money, and the debtor would have lost\r\nhis whole estate, without being discharged of his debt. This is the\r\nhistory of the delay of justice in that country, in the case of British\r\ncreditors. As to all others, its administration is as speedy as justice\r\nitself will admit. I presume it is equally so in all the other States,\r\nand can add, that it is administered in them all with a purity and\r\nintegrity, of which few countries afford an example.\r\n\r\nI cannot take leave, altogether, of the subjects of this conversation,\r\nwithout recalling the attention of the Count de Vergennes to what had\r\nbeen its principal drift. This was to endeavor to bring about a direct\r\nexchange between France and the United States, (without the intervention\r\nof a third nation) of those productions, with which each could furnish\r\nthe other. We can furnish to France (because we have heretofore\r\nfurnished to England) of whale-oil and spermaceti, of furs and peltry,\r\nof ships and naval stores, and of potash, to the amount of fifteen\r\nmillions of livres; and the quantities will admit of increase. Of our\r\ntobacco, France consumes the value of ten millions more. Twenty-five\r\nmillions of livres, then, mark the extent of that commerce of exchange,\r\nwhich is, at present, practicable between us. We want, in return,\r\nproductions and manufactures, not money. If the duties on our produce\r\nare light, and the sale free, we shall undoubtedly bring it here, and\r\nlay out the proceeds on the spot, in the productions and manufactures\r\nwhich we want. The merchants of France will, on their part, become\r\nactive in the same business. We shall no more think, when we shall have\r\nsold our produce here, of making an useless voyage to another country,\r\nto lay out the money, than we think, at present, when we have sold it\r\nelsewhere, of coming here to lay out the money. The conclusion is, that\r\nthere are commodities which form a basis of exchange, to the extent of a\r\nmillion of guineas annually: it is for the wisdom of those in power, to\r\ncontrive that the exchange shall be made.\r\n\r\nHaving put this paper into the hands of Monsieur Reyneval, we entered\r\ninto conversation again, on the subject of the Farms, which were now\r\nunderstood to be approaching to a conclusion. He told me, that he was\r\ndecidedly of opinion, that the interest of the State required the Farm\r\nof tobacco to be discontinued, and that he had, accordingly, given every\r\naid to my proposition, which lay within his sphere: that the Count de\r\nVergennes was very clearly of the same opinion, and had supported\r\nit strongly with reasons of his own, when he transmitted it to the\r\nComptroller General; but that the Comptroller, in the discussions of\r\nthis subject which had taken place, besides the objections which the\r\nCount de Vergennes had repeated to me, and which are before mentioned,\r\nhad added, that the contract with the Farmers General was now so far\r\nadvanced, that the article of tobacco could not be withdrawn from it,\r\nwithout unraveling the whole transaction. Having understood, that,\r\nin this contract, there was always reserved to the crown, a right to\r\ndiscontinue it at any moment, making just reimbursements to the Farmers,\r\nI asked M. Reyneval, if the contract should be concluded in its present\r\nform, whether it might still be practicable to have it discontinued, as\r\nto the article of tobacco, at some future moment. He said it might be\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, the true obstacle to this proposition has penetrated,\r\nin various ways, through the veil which covers it. The influence of the\r\nFarmers General has been heretofore found sufficient to shake a minister\r\nin his office. Monsieur de Calonne’s continuance or dismission has been\r\nthought, for some time, to be on a poise. Were he to shift this great\r\nweight, therefore, out of his own scale into that of his adversaries,\r\nit would decide their preponderance. The joint interests of France and\r\nAmerica would be an insufficient counterpoise in his favor.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, that these efforts to improve the commerce of the\r\nUnited States have been confined to that branch only, which respects\r\nFrance itself, and that nothing passed on the subject of our commerce\r\nwith the West Indies, except an incidental conversation as to our fish.\r\nThe reason of this was no want of a due sense of its importance. Of that\r\nI am thoroughly sensible. But efforts in favor of this branch would, at\r\npresent, be desperate. To nations with which we have not yet treated,\r\nand who have possessions in America, we may offer a free vent of their\r\nmanufactures in the United States, for a full, or a modified admittance\r\ninto those possessions. But to France, we are obliged to give that\r\nfreedom for a different compensation; to wit, for her aid in effecting\r\nour independence. It is difficult, therefore, to say what we have now to\r\noffer her, for an admission into her West Indies. Doubtless it has its\r\nprice. But the question is, what this would be, and whether worth our\r\nwhile to give it. Were we to propose to give to each other’s citizens\r\nall the rights of natives, they would, of course, count what they should\r\ngain by this enlargement of right, and examine whether it would be worth\r\nto them, as much as their monopoly of their West India commerce. If not,\r\nthat commercial freedom which we wish to preserve, and which, indeed, is\r\nso valuable, leaves us little else to offer. An expression in my letter\r\nto the Count de Vergennes, of November the 20th, wherein I hinted, that\r\nboth nations might, perhaps, come into the opinion, that the condition\r\nof natives might be a better ground of intercourse for their citizens,\r\nthan that of the most favored nation, was intended to furnish an\r\nopportunity to the minister, of parleying on that subject, if he was so\r\ndisposed, and to myself, of seeing whereabouts they would begin, that\r\nI might communicate it to Congress, and leave them to judge of the\r\nexpediency of pursuing the subject. But no overtures have followed;\r\nfor I have no right to consider, as coming from the minister, certain\r\nquestions which were, very soon after, proposed to me by an individual.\r\nIt sufficiently accounts for these questions, that that individual\r\nhad written a memorial on the subject, for the consideration of the\r\nminister, and might wish to know what we would be willing to do.\r\nThe idea that I should answer such questions to him, is equally\r\nunaccountable, whether we suppose them originating with himself, or\r\ncoming from the minister. In fact, I must suppose them to be his own;\r\nand I transmit them, only that Congress my see what one Frenchman,\r\nat least, thinks on the subject. If we can obtain from Great Britain\r\nreasonable conditions of commerce (which, in my idea, must for ever\r\ninclude an admission into her islands), the freest ground between these\r\ntwo nations would seem to be the best. But if we can obtain no equal\r\nterms from her, perhaps Congress might think it prudent, as Holland has\r\ndone, to connect us unequivocally with France. Holland has purchased the\r\nprotection of France. The price she pays is, aid in time of war. It is\r\ninteresting for us to purchase a free commerce with the French islands.\r\nBut whether it is best to pay for it, by aids in war, or by privileges\r\nin commerce; or not to purchase it at all, is the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVII.--TO T. HOPKINSON, January 3, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. HOPKINSON.\r\n\r\nParis, January 3, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 25th of September. Since that I have received\r\nyours of October the 25th, enclosing a duplicate of the last invented\r\ntongue for the harpsichord. The letter enclosing another of them, and\r\naccompanied by newspapers, which you mention in that of October the\r\n25th, has never come to hand. I will embrace the first opportunity of\r\nsending you the crayons. Perhaps they may come with this, which I think\r\nto deliver to Mr. Bingham, who leaves us on Saturday, for London. If, on\r\nconsulting him, I find the conveyance from London uncertain, you shall\r\nreceive them by a Mr. Barrett, who goes from hence for New York, next\r\nmonth. You have not authorized me to try to avail you of the new tongue.\r\nIndeed, the ill success of my endeavors with the last does not promise\r\nmuch with this. However, I shall try. Houdon only stopped a moment, to\r\ndeliver me your letter, so that I have not yet had an opportunity of\r\nasking his opinion of the improvement. I am glad you are pleased with\r\nhis work. He is among the foremost, or, perhaps, the foremost artist in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nTurning to your _Encyclopédie, Arts et Metiers_, tome 3, part 1, page\r\n393, you will find mentioned an instrument, invented by a Monsieur\r\nRenaudin, for determining the true time of the musical movements, largo,\r\nadagio, &c. I went to see it. He showed me his first invention; the\r\nprice of the machine was twenty-five guineas: then his second, which\r\nhe had been able to make for about half that sum. Both of these had\r\na mainspring and a balance-wheel, for their mover and regulator. The\r\nstrokes are made by a small hammer. He then showed me his last, which is\r\nmoved by a weight and regulated by a pendulum, and which cost only-two\r\nguineas and a half. It presents, in front, a dial-plate like that of\r\na clock, on which are arranged, in a circle, the words _largo, adagio,\r\nandante, allegro, presto_. The circle is moreover divided into fifty-two\r\nequal degrees. _Largo_ is at 1, _adagio_ at 11, _andante_ at 22,\r\n_allegro_ at 36, and _presto_ at 46. Turning the index to any one of\r\nthese, the pendulum (which is a string, with a ball hanging to it)\r\nshortens or lengthens, so that one of its vibrations gives you a crochet\r\nfor that movement. This instrument has been examined by the academy of\r\nmusic here, who were so well satisfied of its utility, that they have\r\nordered all music which shall be printed here, in future, to have the\r\nmovements numbered in correspondence with this plexi-chronometer. I need\r\nnot tell you that the numbers between two movements, as between 22 and\r\n36, give the quicker or slower degrees of the movements, such as the\r\nquick _andante_, or moderate _allegro_. The instrument is useful, but\r\nstill it may be greatly simplified. I got him to make me one, and having\r\nfixed a pendulum vibrating seconds, I tried by that the vibrations of\r\nhis pendulum, according to the several movements. I find the pendulum\r\nregulated to Largo\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Plexi-Chronometer, page391]\r\n\r\nEvery one, therefore, may make a chronometer adapted to his instrument.\r\n\r\nFor a harpsichord, the following occurs to me:\r\n\r\nIn the wall of your chamber, over the instrument, drive five little\r\nbrads, as, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, in the following manner. Take a string with\r\na bob to it, of such length, as, that hung on No. 1, it shall vibrate\r\nfifty-two times in a minute. Then proceed by trial to drive No. 2, at\r\nsuch a distance, that drawing the loop of the string to that, the part\r\nremaining between 1 and the bob, shall vibrate sixty times in a minute.\r\nFix the third for seventy vibrations, &c.; the cord always hanging over\r\nNo. 1, as the centre of vibration. A person playing on the violin may\r\nfix this on his music-stand. A pendulum thrown into vibration will\r\ncontinue in motion long enough to give you the time of your piece. I\r\nhave been thus particular, on the supposition that you would fix one of\r\nthese simple things for yourself.\r\n\r\nYou have heard often of the metal called platina, to be found only in\r\nSouth America. It is insusceptible of rust, as gold and silver are, none\r\nof the acids affecting it, excepting the _aqua regia_. It also admits\r\nof as perfect a polish as the metal hitherto used for the specula of\r\ntelescopes. These two properties had suggested to the Spaniards the\r\nsubstitution of it for that use. But the mines being closed up by the\r\ngovernment, it is difficult to get the metal. The experiment has been\r\nlately tried here by the Abbe Rochon (whom I formerly mentioned to\r\nMr. Rittenhouse, as having discovered that lenses of certain natural\r\ncrystals have two different and uncombined magnifying powers), and he\r\nthinks the polish as high as that of the metal heretofore used, and\r\nthat it will never be injured by the air, a touch of the finger, &c. I\r\nexamined it in a dull day, which did not admit a fair judgment of the\r\nstrength of its reflection.\r\n\r\nGood qualities are sometimes misfortunes. I will prove it from your\r\nown experience. You are punctual; and almost the only one of my\r\ncorrespondents on whom I can firmly rely, for the execution of\r\ncommissions which combine a little trouble with more attention. I am\r\nvery sorry however that I have three commissions to charge you with,\r\nwhich will give you more than a little trouble. Two of them are for\r\nMonsieur de Buffon. Many, many years ago, Cadwallader Golden wrote a\r\nvery small pamphlet on the subjects of attraction and impulsion, a copy\r\nof which he sent to Monsieur de Buffon. He was so charmed with it, that\r\nhe put it into the hands of a friend to translate, who lost it. It has\r\never since weighed on his mind, and he has made repeated trials to have\r\nit found in England. But in vain. He applied to me. I am in hopes, if\r\nyou will write a line to the booksellers of Philadelphia to rummage\r\ntheir shops, that some of them may find it. Or, perhaps, some of the\r\ncareful old people of Pennsylvania or New Jersey may have preserved a\r\ncopy. In the King’s cabinet of Natural History, of which Monsieur de\r\nBuffon has the superintendence, I observed that they had neither our\r\ngrouse nor our pheasant. These, I know, may be bought in the market of\r\nPhiladelphia, on any day while they are in season. Pray buy the male and\r\nfemale of each, and employ some apothecary’s boys to prepare them, and\r\npack them. Methods may be seen in the preliminary discourse to the first\r\nvolume of Birds, in the _Encyclopédie_, or in the Natural History of\r\nBuffon, where he describes the King’s cabinet. And this done, you will\r\nbe so good as to send them to me. The third commission is more distant.\r\nIt is to precure me two or three hundred paccan nuts from the western\r\ncountry. I expect they can always be got at Pittsburgh and am in hopes,\r\nthat by yourself or your friends, some attentive person there may be\r\nengaged to send them to you. They should come as fresh as possible,\r\nand come best, I believe, in a box of sand. Of this, Barham could best\r\nadvise you. I imagine vessels are always coming from Philadelphia to\r\nFrance. If there be a choice of ports, Havre would be the best. I must\r\nbeg you to direct them to the care of the American consul or agent at\r\nthe port, to be sent by the Diligence or Fourgon. A thousand apologies\r\nwould not suffice for this trouble, if I meant to pay you in apologies\r\nonly. But I sincerely ask, and will punctually execute, the appointment\r\nof your _chargé des affaires_ in Europe generally. From the smallest\r\nto the highest commission, I will execute with zeal and punctually, in\r\nbuying, or doing any thing you wish, on this side the water. And you may\r\njudge from the preceding specimen, that I shall not be behind hand\r\nin the trouble I shall impose on you. Make a note of all the expenses\r\nattending my commissions, and favor me with it every now and then, and\r\nI will replace them. My daughter is well, and retains an affectionate\r\nremembrance of her ancient patroness, your mother, as well as of your\r\nlady and family. She joins me in wishing to them, and to Mr. and Mrs.\r\nRittenhouse and family, every happiness. Accept, yourself, assurances of\r\nthe esteem with which I am, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. What is become of the Lunarium for the King?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVIII.--TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, January 4, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nParis, January 4, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have been honored with your letter of September the 26th, which was\r\ndelivered me by Mr. Houdon, who is safely returned. He has brought with\r\nhim the mould of the face only, having left the other parts of his work\r\nwith his workmen to come by some other conveyance. Doctor Franklin, who\r\nwas joined with me in the superintendence of this just monument, having\r\nleft us before what is called the costume of the statue was decided on,\r\nI cannot so well satisfy myself, and I am persuaded I should not so well\r\nsatisfy the world, as by consulting your own wish or inclination as\r\nto this article. Permit me, therefore, to ask you whether there is any\r\nparticular dress, or any particular attitude, which you would rather\r\nwish to be adopted. I shall take a singular pleasure in having your own\r\nidea executed, if you will be so good as to make it known to me.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the trouble you have taken in answering my inquiries on\r\nthe subject of Bushnel’s machine. Colonel Humphreys could only give me\r\na general idea of it from the effects proposed, rather than the means\r\ncontrived to produce them.\r\n\r\nI sincerely rejoice that three such works as the opening the Potomac and\r\nJames rivers, and a canal from the Dismal Swamp are likely to be carried\r\nthrough. There is still a fourth, however, which I had the honor I\r\nbelieve of mentioning to you in a letter of March the 15th, 1784, from\r\nAnnapolis. It is the cutting a canal which shall unite the heads of the\r\nCayahoga and Beaver Creek. The utility of this, and even the necessity\r\nof it, if we mean to aim at the trade of the lakes, will be palpable\r\nto you. The only question is its practicability. The best information I\r\ncould get as to this was from General Hand, who described the country as\r\nchampain, and these waters as heading in lagoons, which would be easily\r\nunited. Maryland and Pennsylvania are both interested to concur with us\r\nin this work. The institutions you propose to establish by the shares\r\nin the Potomac and James river companies, given you by the Assembly, and\r\nthe particular objects of those institutions, are most worthy. It occurs\r\nto me, however, that if the bill ‘for the more general diffusion\r\nof knowledge,’ which is in the revisal, should be passed, it would\r\nsupersede the use and obscure the existence of the charity schools you\r\nhave thought of. I suppose in fact, that that bill or some other like it\r\nwill be passed. I never saw one received with more enthusiasm than that\r\nwas in the year 1778, by the House of Delegates, who ordered it to be\r\nprinted. And it seemed afterwards, that nothing but the extreme distress\r\nof our resources prevented its being carried into execution even during\r\nthe war. It is an axiom in my mind, that our liberty can never be safe\r\nbut in the hands of the people themselves, and that too of the people\r\nwith a certain degree of instruction. This it is the business of the\r\nState to effect, and on a general plan. Should you see a probability\r\nof this, however, you can never be at a loss for worthy objects of this\r\ndonation. Even the remitting that proportion of the toll on all articles\r\ntransported, would present itself under many favorable considerations,\r\nand it would in effect be to make the State do in a certain proportion\r\nwhat they ought to have done wholly: for I think they should clear\r\nall the rivers, and lay them open and free to all. However, you are\r\ninfinitely the best judge, how the most good may be effected with these\r\nshares.\r\n\r\nAll is quiet here. There are indeed two specks in the horizon: the\r\nexchange of Bavaria, and the demarcation between the Emperor and Turks.\r\nWe may add as a third, the interference by the King of Prussia in the\r\ndomestic disputes of the Dutch. Great Britain, it is said, begins to\r\nlook towards us with a little more good humor. But how true this may\r\nbe, I cannot say with certainty. We are trying to render her commerce\r\nas little necessary to us as possible, by finding other markets for our\r\nproduce. A most favorable reduction of duties on whale-oil has taken\r\nplace here, which will give us a vent for that article, paying a duty of\r\na guinea and a half a ton only.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest esteem and respect, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient and\r\n\r\nmost humble servant,\r\n\r\nTm: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIX.--TO A. CARY, January 7, 1786\r\n\r\nTO A. CARY.\r\n\r\nParis, January 7, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe very few of my countrymen who happen to be punctual, will find their\r\npunctuality a misfortune to them. Of this I shall give you a proof by\r\nthe present application, which I should not make to you, if I did\r\nnot know you to be superior to the torpidity of our climate. In my\r\nconversations with the Count de Buffon on the subjects of Natural\r\nHistory, I find him absolutely unacquainted with our elk and our deer.\r\nHe has hitherto believed that our deer never had horns more than a foot\r\nlong; and has, therefore, classed them with the roe-buck, which I am\r\nsure you know them to be different from. I have examined some of the red\r\ndeer of this country at the distance of about sixty yards, and I find\r\nno other difference between them and ours, than a shade or two in the\r\ncolor. Will you take the trouble to procure for me the largest pair of\r\nbuck’s horns you can, and a large skin of each color, that is to say,\r\na red and a blue? If it were possible to take these from a buck just\r\nkilled, to leave all the bones of the head in the skin with the horns\r\non, to leave the bones of the legs in the skin also, and the hoofs to\r\nit, so that having only made an incision all along the belly and neck to\r\ntake the animal out at, we could by sewing up that incision and stuffing\r\nthe skin, present the true size and form of the animal, it would be\r\na most precious present. Our deer have been often sent to England and\r\nScotland. Do you know (with certainty) whether they have ever bred with\r\nthe red deer of those countries? With respect to the elk, I despair of\r\nyour being able to get for me any thing but the horns of it. David Ross\r\nI know has a pair; perhaps he would give them to us. It is useless to\r\nask for the skin and skeleton, because I think it is not in your power\r\nto get them, otherwise they would be most desirable. A gentleman,\r\nfellow-passenger with me from Boston to England, promised to send to you\r\nin my name some hares, rabbits, pheasants, and partridges, by the return\r\nof the ship which was to go to Virginia, and the captain promised to\r\ntake great care of them. My friend procured the animals, and the ship\r\nchanging her destination, he kept them, in hopes of finding some other\r\nconveyance, till they all perished. I do not despair, however, of\r\nfinding some opportunity still of sending a colony of useful animals.\r\nI am making a collection of vines for wine, and for the table; also of\r\nsome trees, such as the cork-oak, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nEvery thing is absolutely quiet in Europe. There is not, therefore, a\r\nword of news to communicate. I pray you to present me affectionately\r\nto your family and that of Tuckahoe. Whatever expense is necessary for\r\nprocuring me the articles above-mentioned, I will instantly replace,\r\neither in cash, or in any thing you may wish from hence.\r\n\r\nI am with very sincere esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CL.--TO MAJOR GENERAL GREENE, January 12, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR GENERAL GREENE.\r\n\r\nParis, January 12, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of June the 1st did not come to hand till the 3rd of\r\nSeptember. I immediately made inquiries on the subject of the frigate\r\nyou had authorized your relation to sell to this government, and I found\r\nthat he had long before that sold her to government, and sold her very\r\nwell, as I understood. I noted the price on the back of your letter,\r\nwhich I have since unfortunately mislaid, so that I cannot at this\r\nmoment state to you the price. But the transaction is of so long\r\nstanding that you cannot fail to have received advice of it. I should\r\nwithout delay have given you this information, but that I hoped to be\r\nable to accompany it with information as to the live-oak, which\r\nwas another object of your letter. This matter, though it has been\r\nconstantly pressed by Mr. St. John, and also by the Marquis de la\r\nFayette, since his return from Berlin, has been spun to a great length,\r\nand at last they have only decided to send to you for samples of the\r\nwood. Letters on this subject from the Marquis de la Fayette accompany\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nEvery thing in Europe is quiet, and promises quiet for at least a year\r\nto come. We do not find it easy to make commercial arrangements in\r\nEurope. There is a want of confidence in us. This country has lately\r\nreduced the duties on American whale-oil to about a guinea and a half\r\nthe ton, and I think they will take the greatest part of what we can\r\nfurnish. I hope, therefore, that this branch of our commerce will resume\r\nits activity. Portugal shows a disposition to court our trade; but this\r\nhas for some time been discouraged by the hostilities of the piratical\r\nstates of Barbary. The Emperor of Morocco, who had taken one of our\r\nvessels, immediately consented to suspend hostilities and ultimately\r\ngave up the vessel, cargo, and crew. I think we shall be able to settle\r\nmatters with him. But I am not sanguine as to the Algerines. They have\r\ntaken two of our vessels, and I fear will ask such a tribute for a\r\nforbearance of their piracies as the United States would be unwilling\r\nto pay. When this idea comes across my mind, my faculties are absolutely\r\nsuspended between indignation and impatience. I think whatever sums\r\nwe are obliged to pay for freedom of navigation in the European seas,\r\nshould be levied on the European commerce with us by a separate impost,\r\nthat these powers may see that they protect these enormities for their\r\nown loss. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect\r\nesteem and respect, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLI.--TO LISTER ASQUITH, January 13, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LISTER ASQUITH.\r\n\r\nParis, January 13, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have duly received your letter of the 2nd instant. The delays, which\r\nhave attended your enlargement, have been much beyond my expectation.\r\nThe reason I have not written to you for some time, has been the\r\nconstant expectation of receiving an order for your discharge. I have\r\nnot received it however. I went to Versailles three days ago, and made\r\nfresh applications on the subject. I received assurances which give me\r\nreason to hope that the order for your discharge will soon be made out.\r\nBe assured it shall not be delayed a moment after it comes to my hands,\r\nand that I shall omit no opportunity of hastening it. In the mean time,\r\nI think you may comfort yourself and companions with the certainty of\r\nreceiving it ere long.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRE QUESTIONS FOR _ECONOMIE POLITIQUE ET DIPLOMATIQUE_\r\n\r\n     [The following were answers by Mr. Jefferson to questions\r\n     addressed to him by Monsieur de Meusnier, author of that\r\n     part of the _Encylopédie Méthodique_, entitled _Economie\r\n     Politique et Diplomatique_.]\r\n\r\n1. What has led Congress to determine that the concurrence of seven\r\nvotes is requisite in questions, which by the Confederation are\r\nsubmitted to the decision of a majority of the United States in Congress\r\nassembled?\r\n\r\nThe ninth article of Confederation, section sixth, evidently establishes\r\nthree orders of questions in Congress. 1. The greater ones which relate\r\nto making peace or war, alliances, coinage, requisitions for money,\r\nraising military force, or appointing its commander-in-chief. 2.\r\nThe lesser ones which comprehend all other matters submitted by the\r\nConfederation to the federal head. 3. The single question of adjourning\r\nfrom day to day. This gradation of questions is distinctly characterized\r\nby the article.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to the magnitude of these questions, a greater concurrence\r\nof the voices composing the Union was thought necessary. Three degrees\r\nof concurrence, well distinguished by substantial circumstances, offered\r\nthemselves to notice. 1. A concurrence of a majority of the people of\r\nthe Union. It was thought that this would be insured by requiring the\r\nvoices of nine States; because according to the loose estimates which\r\nhad then been made of the inhabitants, and the proportion of them which\r\nwere free, it was believed, that even the nine smallest would include\r\na majority of the free citizens of the Union. The voices, therefore, of\r\nnine States were required in the greater questions. 2. A concurrence of\r\nthe majority of the States. Seven constitute that majority. This number,\r\ntherefore, was required in the lesser questions. 3. A concurrence of the\r\nmajority of Congress, that is to say, of the States actually present\r\nin it. As there is no Congress when there are not seven States present,\r\nthis concurrence could never be of less than four States. But these\r\nmight happen to be the four smallest, which would not include one\r\nninth part of the free citizens of the Union. This kind of majority,\r\ntherefore, was entrusted with nothing but the power of adjourning\r\nthemselves from day to day.\r\n\r\nHere then are three kinds of majorities. 1. Of the people. 2. Of the\r\nStates. 3. Of the Congress. Each of which is entrusted to a certain\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThough the paragraph in question be clumsily expressed, yet it strictly\r\nannounces its own intentions. It defines with precision, the greater\r\nquestions, for which nine votes shall be requisite. In the lesser\r\nquestions, it then requires a majority of the United States in Congress\r\nassembled: a term which will apply either to the number seven, as being\r\na majority of the States, or to the number four, as being a majority\r\nof Congress. Which of the two kinds of majority was meant. Clearly that\r\nwhich would leave a still smaller kind for the decision of the question\r\nof adjournment. The contrary construction would be absurd.\r\n\r\nThis paragraph, therefore, should be understood as if it had been\r\nexpressed in the following terms. ‘The United States in Congress\r\nassembled, shall never engage in war, &c. but with the consent of nine\r\nStates: nor determine any other question, but with the consent of a\r\nmajority of the whole States, except the question of adjournment from\r\nday to day, which may be determined by a majority of the States actually\r\npresent in Congress.’\r\n\r\n\r\n2. How far is it permitted to bring on the reconsideration of a question\r\nwhich Congress has once determined?\r\n\r\nThe first Congress which met being composed mostly of persons who had\r\nbeen members of the legislatures of their respective States, it was\r\nnatural for them to adopt those rules in their proceedings, to which\r\nthey had been accustomed in their legislative houses; and the more so,\r\nas these happened to be nearly the same, as having been copied from the\r\nsame original, those of the British parliament. One of those rules of\r\nproceeding was, that ‘a question once determined cannot be proposed a\r\nsecond time in the same session.’ Congress, during their first session\r\nin the autumn of 1774, observed this rule strictly. But before their\r\nmeeting in the spring of the following year, the war had broken out.\r\nThey found themselves at the head of that war, in an executive as well\r\nas legislative capacity. They found that a rule, wise and necessary for\r\na legislative body, did not suit an executive one, which, being governed\r\nby events, must change their purposes as those change. Besides, their\r\nsession was then to become of equal duration with the war; and a rule,\r\nwhich should render their legislation immutable during all that period,\r\ncould not be submitted to. They, therefore, renounced it in practice,\r\nand have ever since continued to reconsider their questions freely. The\r\nonly restraint, as yet provided against the abuse of this permission\r\nto reconsider, is, that when a question has been decided, it cannot be\r\nproposed for reconsideration, but by some one who voted in favor of the\r\nformer decision, and declares that he has since changed his opinion.\r\nI do not recollect accurately enough, whether it be necessary that his\r\nvote should have decided that of his State, and the vote of his State\r\nhave decided that of Congress.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it might have been better, when they were forming the federal\r\nconstitution, to have assimilated it as much as possible to the\r\nparticular constitutions of the States. All of these have distributed\r\nthe legislative, executive, and judiciary powers into different\r\ndepartments. In the federal constitution the judiciary powers are\r\nseparated from the others; but the legislative and executive are both\r\nexercised by Congress. A means of amending this defect has been thought\r\nof. Congress having a power to establish what committees of their own\r\nbody they please, and to arrange among them the distribution of their\r\nbusiness, they might, on the first day of their annual meeting, appoint\r\nan executive committee consisting of a member from each State, and refer\r\nto them all executive business which should occur during their session;\r\nconfining themselves to what is of a legislative nature, that is to say,\r\nto the heads described in the ninth article, as of the competence of\r\nnine States only, and to such other questions as should lead to the\r\nestablishment of general rules. The journal of this committee of the\r\npreceding day might be read the next morning in Congress, and considered\r\nas approved, unless a vote was demanded on a particular article, and\r\nthat article changed. The sessions of Congress would then be short, and\r\nwhen they separated, the Confederation authorizes the appointment of a\r\ncommittee of the States which would naturally succeed to the business of\r\nthe executive committee. The legislative business would be better done,\r\nbecause the attention of the members would not be interrupted by the\r\ndetails of execution; and the executive business would be better done,\r\nbecause business of this nature is better adapted to small than great\r\nbodies. A monarchical head should confide the execution of its will to\r\ndepartments, consisting each of a plurality of hands, who would warp\r\nthat will as much as possible towards wisdom and moderation, the two\r\nqualities it generally wants. But a republican head, founding its\r\ndecrees originally in these two qualities, should commit them to a\r\nsingle hand for execution, giving them thereby a promptitude which\r\nrepublican proceedings generally want. Congress could not, indeed,\r\nconfide their executive business to a smaller number than a committee\r\nconsisting of a member from each State. This is necessary to insure the\r\nconfidence of the Union. But it would be gaining a great deal to reduce\r\nthe executive head to thirteen, and to relieve themselves of those\r\ndetails. This, however, has as yet been the subject of private\r\nconversations only.\r\n\r\n3. A succinct account of paper money, in America?\r\n\r\nPrevious to the late revolution, most of the States were in the\r\nhabit, whenever they had occasion for more money than could be raised\r\nimmediately, by taxes, to issue paper notes or bills, in the name of the\r\nState, wherein they promised to pay to the bearer the sum named in the\r\nnote or bill. In some of the States, no time of payment was fixed, nor\r\ntax laid to enable payment. In these, the bills depreciated. But others\r\nof the States named in the bill the day when it should be paid, laid\r\ntaxes to bring in money enough for that purpose, and paid the bills\r\npunctually, on or before the day named. In these States, paper money\r\nwas in as high estimation as gold and silver. On the commencement of\r\nthe late Revolution, Congress had no money. The external commerce of the\r\nStates being suppressed, the farmer could not sell his produce, and, of\r\ncourse, could not pay a tax. Congress had no resource then, but in paper\r\nmoney. Not being able to lay a tax for its redemption, they could only\r\npromise that taxes should be laid for that purpose, so as to redeem the\r\nbills by a certain day. They did not foresee the long continuance of the\r\nwar, the almost total suppression of their exports, and other events,\r\nwhich rendered the performance of their engagement impossible. The paper\r\nmoney continued, for a twelvemonth, equal to gold and silver. But the\r\nquantities which they were obliged to emit, for the purposes of the war,\r\nexceeded what had been the usual quantity of the circulating medium.\r\nIt began, therefore, to become cheaper, or, as we expressed it, it\r\ndepreciated, as gold and silver would have done, had they been thrown\r\ninto circulation in equal quantities. But not having, like them, an\r\nintrinsic value, its depreciation was more rapid, and greater, than\r\ncould ever have happened with them. In two years, it had fallen to two\r\ndollars of paper money for one of silver; in three years, to four for\r\none; in nine months more, it fell to ten for one; and in the six months\r\nfollowing, that is to say, by September, 1779, it had fallen to twenty\r\nfor one.\r\n\r\nCongress, alarmed at the consequences which were to be apprehended,\r\nshould they lose this resource altogether, thought it necessary to make\r\na vigorous effort to stop its further depreciation. They, therefore,\r\ndetermined, in the first place, that their emissions should not exceed\r\ntwo hundred millions of dollars, to which term they were then nearly\r\narrived: and, though they knew that twenty dollars of what they were\r\nthen issuing, would buy no more for their army than one silver dollar\r\nwould buy, yet they thought it would be worth while to submit to the\r\nsacrifices of nineteen out of twenty dollars, if they could thereby stop\r\nfurther depreciation. They, therefore, published an address to their\r\nconstituents, in which they renewed their original declarations, that\r\nthis paper money should be redeemed at dollar for dollar. They proved\r\nthe ability of the States to do this, and that their liberty would be\r\ncheaply bought at that price. The declaration was ineffectual. No man\r\nreceived the money at a better rate; on the contrary, in six months\r\nmore, that is, by March, 1780, it had fallen to forty for one. Congress\r\nthen tried an experiment of a different kind. Considering their former\r\noffers to redeem this money, at par, as relinquished by the general\r\nrefusal to take it, but in progressive depreciation, they required the\r\nwhole to be brought in, declared it should be redeemed at its present\r\nvalue, of forty for one, and that they would give to the holders new\r\nbills, reduced in their denomination to the sum of gold or silver, which\r\nwas actually to be paid for them. This would reduce the nominal sum of\r\nthe mass in circulation, to the present worth of that mass, which was\r\nfive millions; a sum not too great for the circulation of the States,\r\nand which, they therefore hoped, would not depreciate further, as they\r\ncontinued firm in their purpose of emitting no more. This effort was as\r\nunavailing as the former. Very little of the money was brought in. It\r\ncontinued to circulate and to depreciate, till the end of 1780, when it\r\nhad fallen to seventy-five for one, and the money circulated from the\r\nFrench army, being, by that time, sensible in all the States north\r\nof the Potomac, the paper ceased its circulation altogether, in those\r\nStates. In Virginia and North Carolina, it continued a year longer,\r\nwithin which time it fell to one thousand for one, and then expired, as\r\nit had done in the other States, without a single groan. Not a murmur\r\nwas heard, on this occasion, among the people. On the contrary,\r\nuniversal congratulations took place, on their seeing this gigantic\r\nmass, whose dissolution had threatened convulsions which should shake\r\ntheir infant confederacy to its centre, quietly interred in its grave.\r\nForeigners, indeed, who do not, like the natives, feel indulgence for\r\nits memory, as of a being which has vindicated their liberties, and\r\nfallen in the moment of victory, have been loud, and still are loud in\r\ntheir complaints. A few of them have reason; but the most noisy are\r\nnot the best of them. They are persons who have become bankrupt, by\r\nunskilful attempts at commerce with America. That they may have some\r\npretext to offer to their creditors, they have bought up great masses of\r\nthis dead money in America, where it is to be had at five thousand for\r\none, and they show the certificates of their paper possessions, as\r\nif they had all died in their hands, and had been the cause of their\r\nbankruptcy. Justice will be done to all, by paying to all persons what\r\nthis money actually cost them, with an interest of six per cent, from\r\nthe time they received it. If difficulties present themselves in the\r\nascertaining the epoch of the receipt, it has been thought better that\r\nthe State should lose, by admitting easy proofs, than that individuals,\r\nand especially foreigners, should, by being held to such as would be\r\ndifficult, perhaps impossible.\r\n\r\n4. Virginia certainly owed two millions, sterling, to Great Britain,\r\nat the conclusion of the war. Some have conjectured the debt as high as\r\nthree millions. I think that state owed near as much as all the rest put\r\ntogether. This is to be ascribed to peculiarities in the tobacco trade.\r\nThe advantages made by the British merchants, on the tobaccos consigned\r\nto them, were so enormous, that they spared no means of increasing those\r\nconsignments. A powerful engine for this purpose, was the giving good\r\nprices and credit to the planter, till they got him more immersed in\r\ndebt than he could pay, without selling his lands or slaves. They then\r\nreduced the prices given for his tobacco, so that let his shipments be\r\never so great, and his demand of necessaries ever so economical, they\r\nnever permitted him to clear off his debt. These debts had become\r\nhereditary from father to son, for many generations, so that the\r\nplanters were a species of property, annexed to certain mercantile\r\nhouses in London.\r\n\r\n5. The members of Congress are differently paid by different States.\r\nSome are on fixed allowances, from four to eight dollars a day. Others\r\nhave their expenses paid, and a surplus for their time. This surplus is\r\nof two, three, or four dollars a day.\r\n\r\n6. I do not believe there has ever been a moment, when a single whig, in\r\nany one State, would not have shuddered at the very idea of a separation\r\nof their State from the confederacy. The tories would, at all times,\r\nhave been glad to see the confederacy dissolved, even by particles at a\r\ntime, in hopes of their attaching themselves again to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n7. The 11th article of Confederation admits Canada to accede to the\r\nConfederation, at its own will, but adds, ‘no other colony shall\r\nbe admitted to the same, unless such admission be agreed to by nine\r\nStates.’ When the plan of April, 1784, for establishing new States, was\r\non the carpet, the committee who framed the report of that plan, had\r\ninserted this clause, ‘provided nine States agree to such admission,\r\naccording to the reservation of the 11th of the articles of\r\nConfederation.’ It was objected, 1. That the words of the Confederation,\r\n‘no other colony,’ could refer only to the residuary possessions of\r\nGreat Britain, as the two Floridas, Nova Scotia, &c. not being already\r\nparts of the Union; that the law for ‘admitting’ a new member into the\r\nUnion, could not be applied to a territory which was already in the\r\nUnion, as making part of a State which was a member of it. 2. That\r\nit would be improper to allow ‘nine’ States to receive a new member,\r\nbecause the same reasons which rendered that number proper now, would\r\nrender a greater one proper, when the number composing the Union should\r\nbe increased. They therefore struck out this paragraph, and inserted\r\na proviso, that, ‘the consent of so many States, in Congress, shall be\r\nfirst obtained, as may, at the time, be competent;’ thus leaving the\r\nquestion, whether the 11th article applies to the admission of new\r\nStates, to be decided when that admission shall be asked. See the\r\nJournal of Congress of April 20, 1784. Another doubt was started in this\r\ndebate; viz. whether the agreement of the nine Stales, required by\r\nthe Confederation, was to be made by their legislatures, or by their\r\ndelegates in Congress. The expression adopted, viz. ‘so many States, in\r\nCongress, is first obtained,’ show what was their sense of this matter.\r\nIf it be agreed, that the 11th article of the Confederation is not to be\r\napplied to the admission of these new States, then it is contended\r\nthat their admission comes within the 13th article, which forbids ‘any\r\nalteration, unless agreed to in a Congress of the United States,\r\nand afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.’ The\r\nindependence of the new States of Kentucky and Franklin, will soon bring\r\non the ultimate decision of all these questions.\r\n\r\n8. Particular instances, whereby the General Assembly of Virginia have\r\nshown, that they considered the ordinance called their constitution, as\r\nevery other ordinance, or act of the legislature, subject to be altered\r\nby the legislature for the time being.\r\n\r\n1. The convention which formed that constitution, declared themselves\r\nto be the House of Delegates, during the term for which they were\r\noriginally elected, and, in the autumn of the year, met the Senate,\r\nelected under the new constitution, and did legislative business with\r\nthem. At this time, there were malefactors in the public jail, and there\r\nwas, as yet, no court established for their trial. They passed a\r\nlaw, appointing certain members by name, who were then members of the\r\nExecutive Council, to be a court for the trial of these malefactors,\r\nthough the constitution had said, in express words, that no person\r\nshould exercise the powers of more than one of the three departments,\r\nlegislative, executive, and judiciary, at the same time. This proves,\r\nthat the very men who had made that constitution, understood that it\r\nwould be alterable by the General Assembly. This court was only for that\r\noccasion. When the next General Assembly met, after the election of the\r\nensuing year, there was a new set of malefactors in the jail, and no\r\ncourt to try them. This Assembly passed a similar law to the former,\r\nappointing certain members of the Executive Council to be an occasional\r\ncourt for this particular case. Not having the journals of Assembly by\r\nme, I am unable to say whether this measure was repealed afterwards.\r\nHowever, they are instances of executive and judiciary powers exercised\r\nby the same persons, under the authority of a law, made in contradiction\r\nto the constitution.\r\n\r\n2. There was a process depending in the ordinary courts of justice,\r\nbetween two individuals of the name of Robinson and Fauntleroy, who\r\nwere relations, of different descriptions, to one Robinson, a British\r\nsubject, lately dead. Each party claimed a right to inherit the lands\r\nof the decedent, according to the laws. Their right should, by the\r\nconstitution, have been decided by the judiciary courts; and it was\r\nactually depending before them. One of the parties petitioned the\r\nAssembly, (I think it was in the year 1782,) who passed a law deciding\r\nthe right in his favor. In the following year, a Frenchman, master of a\r\nvessel, entered into port without complying with the laws established in\r\nsuch cases, whereby he incurred the forfeitures of the law to any person\r\nwho would sue for them. An individual instituted a legal process\r\nto recover these forfeitures, according to the law of the land. The\r\nFrenchman petitioned the Assembly, who passed a law deciding the\r\nquestion of forfeiture in his favor. These acts are occasional repeals\r\nof that part of the constitution, which forbids the same persons to\r\nexercise legislative and judiciary powers, at the same time.\r\n\r\n3. The Assembly is in the habitual exercise, during their sessions,\r\nof directing the Executive what to do. There are few pages of their\r\njournals, which do not furnish proofs of this, and, consequently,\r\ninstances of the legislative and executive powers exercised by the same\r\npersons, at the same time. These things prove, that it has been the\r\nuninterrupted opinion of every Assembly, from that which passed the\r\nordinance called the constitution, down to the present day, that their,\r\nacts may control that ordinance, and, of course, that the State of\r\nVirginia has no fixed constitution at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE BY JEFFERSON: ‘_Etats Unis,_’ FOR THE _Encyclopédie Méthodique_\r\n\r\n     [The succeeding observations were made by Mr. Jefferson on\r\n     an article entitled ‘_Etats Unis_,’ prepared for the\r\n     _Encyclopédie Méthodique_, and submitted to him before its\r\n     publication.]\r\n\r\nPage 8. The malefactors sent to America were not sufficient in number to\r\nmerit enumeration, as one class out of three, which peopled America. It\r\nwas at a late period of their history, that this practice began. I\r\nhave no book by me, which enables me to point out the date of its\r\ncommencement. But I do not think the whole number sent would amount to\r\ntwo thousand, and being principally men, eaten up with disease, they\r\nmarried seldom and propagated little. I do not suppose that themselves\r\nand their descendants are, at present, four thousand, which is little\r\nmore than one thousandth part of the whole inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIndented servants formed a considerable supply. These were poor\r\nEuropeans, who went to America to settle themselves. If they could pay\r\ntheir passage, it was well. If not, they must find means of paying it.\r\nThey were at liberty, therefore, to make an agreement with any person\r\nthey chose, to serve him such a length of time as they agreed on, upon\r\ncondition that he would repay, to the master of the vessel, the expenses\r\nof their passage. If, being foreigners, unable to speak the language,\r\nthey did not know how to make a bargain for themselves, the captain\r\nof the vessel contracted for them, with such persons as he could.\r\nThis contract was by deed indented, which occasioned them to be called\r\nindented servants. Sometimes they were called redemptioners, because,\r\nby their agreement with the master of the vessel, they could redeem\r\nthemselves from his power by paying their passage; which they frequently\r\neffected, by hiring themselves on their arrival, as is before mentioned.\r\nIn some States, I know that these people had a right of marrying\r\nthemselves, without their master’s leave, and I did suppose they had\r\nthat right every where. I did not know, that, in any of the States, they\r\ndemanded so much as a week for every day’s absence, without leave.\r\nI suspect this must have been at a very early period, while the\r\ngovernments were in the hands of the first emigrants, who, being mostly\r\nlaborers, were narrow-minded and severe. I know that in Virginia, the\r\nlaws allowed their servitude to be protracted only two days for every\r\none they were absent without leave. So mild was this kind of servitude,\r\nthat it was very frequent for foreigners, who carried to America money\r\nenough, not only to pay their passage, but to buy themselves a farm,\r\nto indent themselves to a master for three years, for a certain sum of\r\nmoney, with a view to learn the husbandry of the country. I will here\r\nmake a general observation. So desirous are the poor of Europe to get\r\nto America, where they may better their condition, that, being unable to\r\npay their passage, they will agree to serve two or three years on their\r\narrival there, rather than not go. During the time of that service, they\r\nare better fed, better clothed, and have lighter labor, than while in\r\nEurope. Continuing to work for hire, a few years longer, they buy a\r\nfarm, marry, and enjoy all the sweets of a domestic society of their\r\nown. The American governments are censured for permitting this species\r\nof servitude, which lays the foundation of the happiness of these\r\npeople. But what should these governments do? Pay the passage of all\r\nthose who choose to go into their country? They are not able; nor,\r\nwere they able, do they think the purchase worth the price. Should they\r\nexclude these people from their shores? Those who know their situations\r\nin Europe and America, would not say, that this is the alternative which\r\nhumanity dictates. It is said these people are deceived by those who\r\ncarry them over. But this is done in Europe. How can the American\r\ngovernments prevent it? Should they punish the deceiver? It seems more\r\nincumbent on the European government, where the act is done, and where\r\na public injury is sustained from it. However, it is only in Europe that\r\nthis deception is heard of. The individuals are generally satisfied in\r\nAmerica, with their adventure, and very few of them wish not to have\r\nmade it. I must add, that the Congress have nothing to do with this\r\nmatter. It belongs to the legislatures of the several States.\r\n\r\nPage 26. ‘_Une puissance, en effet,_’ &c. The account of the settlement\r\nof the colonies, which precedes this paragraph, shows that that\r\nsettlement was not made by public authority, or at the public expense of\r\nEngland; but by the exertions, and at the expense, of individuals. Hence\r\nit happened, that their constitutions were not formed systematically,\r\nbut according to the circumstances which happened to exist in each.\r\nHence, too, the principles of the political connection between the\r\nold and new countries were never settled. That it would have been\r\nadvantageous to have settled them, is certain; and, particularly, to\r\nhave provided a body which should decide, in the last resort, all cases\r\nwherein both parties were interested. But it is not certain that\r\nthat right would have been given, or ought to have been given, to the\r\nParliament; much less, that it resulted to the Parliament, without\r\nhaving been given to it expressly. Why was it necessary, that there\r\nshould have been a body to decide in the last resort? Because, it would\r\nhave been for the good of both parties. But this reason shows, it ought\r\nnot to have been the Parliament, since that would have exercised it for\r\nthe good of one party only.\r\n\r\nPage 105. As to the change of the 8th article of Confederation, for\r\nquotaing requisitions of money on the States.\r\n\r\nBy a report of the secretary of Congress, dated January the 4th, 1786,\r\neight States had then acceded to the proposition; to wit, Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and\r\nNorth Carolina.\r\n\r\nCongress, on the 18th of April, 1783, recommended to the States to\r\ninvest them with a power, for twenty-five years, to levy an impost of\r\nfive per cent, on all articles imported from abroad. New Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, had complied with this,\r\nbefore the 4th of January, 1786. Maryland had passed an act for the\r\nsame purpose; but, by a mistake in referring to the date of the\r\nrecommendation of Congress, the act failed of its effect. This was\r\ntherefore to be rectified. Since the 4th of January, the public papers\r\ntell us, that Rhode Island has complied fully with this recommendation.\r\nIt remains still for New York and Georgia to do it. The exportations\r\nof America, which are tolerably well known, are the best measure for\r\nestimating the importations. These are probably worth about twenty\r\nmillions of dollars annually. Of course, this impost will pay the\r\ninterest of a debt to that amount. If confined to the foreign debt,\r\nit will pay the whole interest of that, and sink half a million of the\r\ncapital annually. The expenses of collecting this impost, will probably\r\nbe six per cent, on its amount, this being the usual expense of\r\ncollection in the United States. This will be sixty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April, 1784, Congress recommended to the States, to\r\ninvest them with a power, for fifteen years, to exclude from their ports\r\nthe vessels of all nations, not having a treaty of commerce with them;\r\nand to pass, as to all nations, an act on the principles of the British\r\nnavigation act. Not that they were disposed to carry these powers into\r\nexecution, with such as would meet them in fair and equal arrangements\r\nof commerce; but that they might be able to do it against those who\r\nshould not. On the 4th of January, 1786, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,\r\nand North Carolina, had done it: It remained for New Jersey, Delaware,\r\nSouth Carolina, and Georgia to do the same.\r\n\r\nin the mean time, the general idea has advanced before the demands of\r\nCongress, and several States have passed acts, for vesting Congress with\r\nthe whole regulation of their commerce, reserving the revenue arising\r\nfrom these regulations, to the disposal of the State in which it is\r\nlevied. The States which, according to the public papers, have passed\r\nsuch acts, are New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey,\r\nDelaware, and Virginia: but the Assembly of Virginia, apprehensive that\r\nthis disjointed method of proceeding may fail in its effect, or be much\r\nretarded, passed a resolution on the 21st of January, 1786, appointing\r\ncommissioners to meet others from the other States, whom they invite\r\ninto the same measure, to digest the form of an act for investing\r\nCongress with, such powers over their commerce, as shall be thought\r\nexpedient, which act is to be reported to their several Assemblies for\r\ntheir adoption. This was the state of the several propositions relative\r\nto the impost and regulation of commerce at the date of our latest\r\nadvices from America.\r\n\r\nPage 125. The General Assembly of Virginia, at their session in 1785,\r\npassed an act, declaring that the district called Kentucky shall be a\r\nseparate and independent State on these conditions. 1. That the people\r\nof that district shall consent to it. 2. That Congress shall consent to\r\nit, and shall receive them into the federal Union. 3. That they shall\r\ntake on themselves a proportionable part of the public debt of Virginia.\r\n4. That they shall confirm all titles to lands within their district\r\nmade by the State of Virginia before their separation.\r\n\r\nPage 139. It was in 1783, and not in 1781, that Congress quitted\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nPage 140, ‘_Le Congrès qui se trouvoit a la portée des rebelles fut\r\neffrayé._’ I was not present on this occasion, but, I have had relations\r\nof the transaction from several who were. The conduct of Congress was\r\nmarked with indignation and firmness. They received no propositions from\r\nthe mutineers. They came to the resolutions which may be seen in the\r\njournals of June the 21st, 1783, then adjourned regularly and went\r\nthrough the body of the mutineers to their respective lodgings.\r\nThe measures taken by Dickinson, the President of Pennsylvania,\r\nfor punishing this insult, not being satisfactory to Congress, they\r\nassembled nine days after at Princeton, in Jersey. The people of\r\nPennsylvania sent petitions, declaring their indignation at what had\r\npassed, their devotion to the federal head, and their dispositions\r\nto protect it, and praying them to return; the legislature as soon as\r\nassembled did the same thing; the Executive, whose irresolution had been\r\nso exceptionable, made apologies. But Congress were now removed; and to\r\nthe opinion that this example was proper, other causes were now added\r\nsufficient to prevent their return to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nPage 155, I. 2. Omit ‘_La dette actuelle,_’ &c.\r\n\r\nAnd also, ‘_Les details,_’ &c. &c. to the end of the paragraph, ‘_celles\r\ndes Etats Unis_’ page 156. The reason is, that these passages seem to\r\nsuppose that the several sums emitted by Congress at different times,\r\namounting nominally to two hundred millions of dollars, had been\r\nactually worth that at the time of emission, and of course, that the\r\nsoldiers and others had received that sum from Congress. But nothing is\r\nfurther from the truth. The soldier, victualler, or other persons who\r\nreceived forty dollars for a service at the close of the year 1779,\r\nreceived, in fact, no more than he who received one dollar for the same\r\nservice in the year 1775, or 1776; because in those years the paper\r\nmoney was at par with silver; whereas, by the close of 1779, forty\r\npaper dollars were worth but one of silver, and would buy no more of the\r\nnecessaries of life. To know what the monies emitted by Congress were\r\nworth to the people at the time they received them, we will state the\r\ndate and amount of every several emission, the depreciation of paper\r\nmoney at the time, and the real worth of the emission in silver or gold.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Depreciation of Money 1775-1779, page411]\r\n\r\n     [* The sum actually voted was 50,000,400, but part of it was\r\n     for exchange of old bills, without saying how much. It is\r\n     presumed that these exchanges absorbed 25,552,780, because\r\n     the remainder 24,447,620, with all the other emissions\r\n     preceding September 2nd, 1779, will amount to 159,948,880,\r\n     the sum which Congress declared to be then in circulation.]\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the two hundred millions of dollars, emitted by\r\nCongress, were worth to those who received them, but about thirty-six\r\nmillions of silver dollars. If we estimate at the same value the like\r\nsum of two hundred millions, supposed to have been emitted by the\r\nStates, and reckon the Federal debt, foreign and domestic, at about\r\nforty-three millions, and the State debts at about twenty-five millions,\r\nit will form an amount of one hundred and forty millions of dollars, or\r\nseven hundred and thirty-five millions of livres Tournois, the total\r\nsum which the war has cost the inhabitants of the United States. It\r\ncontinued eight years, from the battle of Lexington to the cessation\r\nof hostilities in America. The annual expense then was about seventeen\r\nmillions and five hundred thousand dollars, while that of our enemies\r\nwas a greater number of guineas.\r\n\r\nIt will be asked, how will the two masses of Continental and of State\r\nmoney have cost the people of the United States seventy-two millions\r\nof dollars, when they are to be redeemed now with about six millions? I\r\nanswer, that the difference, being sixty-six millions, has been lost on\r\nthe paper bills separately by the successive holders of them. Every\r\none through whose hands a bill passed lost on that bill what it lost in\r\nvalue, during the time it was in his hands. This was a real tax on him;\r\nand in this way, the people of the United States actually contributed\r\nthose sixty-six millions of dollars during the war, and by a mode of\r\ntaxation the most oppressive of all, because the most unequal of all.\r\n\r\nPage 166; bottom line. Leave out ‘Et c’est une autre économie,’ &c. The\r\nreason of this is, that in 1784, purchases of lands were to be made\r\nof the Indians, which were accordingly made. But in 1785 they did not\r\npropose to make any purchase. The money desired in 1785, five thousand\r\ndollars, was probably to pay agents residing among the Indians, or\r\nbalances of the purchases of 1784. These purchases will not be made\r\nevery year; but only at distant intervals, as our settlements are\r\nextended: and it may be regarded as certain, that not a foot of land\r\nwill ever be taken from the Indians without their own consent. The\r\nsacredness of their rights is felt by all thinking persons in America,\r\nas much as in Europe.\r\n\r\nPage 170. Virginia was quotaed the highest of any State in the Union.\r\nBut during the war several States appear to have paid more, because\r\nthey were free from the enemy, whilst Virginia was cruelly ravaged. The\r\nrequisition of 1784 was so quotaed on the several States, as to bring\r\nup their arrearages; so that, when they should have paid the sums then\r\ndemanded, all would be on an equal footing. It is necessary to give a\r\nfurther explanation of this requisition. The requisitions of one million\r\nand two hundred thousand dollars, of eight millions, and two millions,\r\nhad been made during the war, as an experiment to see whether in that\r\nsituation the States could furnish the necessary supplies. It was found\r\nthey could not. The money was thereupon obtained by loans in Europe: and\r\nCongress meant by their requisition of 1784, to abandon the requisitions\r\nof one million and two hundred thousand dollars, and of two millions,\r\nand also one half of the eight millions. But as all the States almost\r\nhad made some payments in part of that requisition, they were obliged\r\nto retain such a proportion of it as would enable them to call for equal\r\ncontributions from all the others.\r\n\r\nPage 170. I cannot say how it has happened, that the debt of Connecticut\r\nis greater than that of Virginia. The latter is the richest in\r\nproductions, and, perhaps, made greater exertions to pay for her\r\nsupplies in the course of the war.\r\n\r\nPage 172. ‘_Les Americains levant après une banqueroute,_ &c. The\r\nobjections made to the United States being here condensed together in a\r\nshort compass, perhaps it would not be improper to condense the answers\r\nin as small a compass in some such form as follows. That is, after the\r\nwords ‘_aucun espoir,_’ add, ‘But to these charges it may be justly\r\nanswered, that those are no bankrupts who acknowledge the sacredness\r\nof their debts in their just and real amount, who are able within a\r\nreasonable time to pay them, and who are actually proceeding in that\r\npayment; that they furnish, in fact, the supplies necessary for the\r\nsupport of their government; that their officers and soldiers are\r\nsatisfied, as the interest of their debt is paid regularly, and the\r\nprincipal is in a course of payment; that the question, whether they\r\nfought ill should be asked of those who met them at Bunker’s Hill,\r\nBennington, Stillwater, King’s Mountain, the Cowpens, Guilford, and the\r\nEutaw. And that the charges of ingratitude, madness, infidelity, and\r\ncorruption, are easily made by those to whom falsehoods cost nothing;\r\nbut that no instances in support of them have been produced or can be\r\nproduced.’\r\n\r\nPage 182. ‘_Les officiers et les soldats ont été payés_,’ &c. The\r\nbalances due to the officers and soldiers have been ascertained, and a\r\ncertificate of the sum given to each; on these the interest is regularly\r\npaid; and every occasion is seized of paying the principal by receiving\r\nthese certificates as money whenever public property is sold, till a\r\nmore regular and effectual method can be taken for paying the whole.\r\n\r\nPage 191. ‘_Quoique la loi dont nous parlons, ne s’observe plus en\r\nAngleterre_.’ ‘An alien born may purchase lands or other estates, but\r\nnot for his own use; for the King is thereupon entitled to them.’ ‘Yet\r\nan alien may acquire a property in goods, money, and other personal\r\nestate, or may hire a house for his habitation. For this is necessary\r\nfor the advancement of trade.’ ‘Also, an alien may bring an action\r\nconcerning personal property, and may make a will and dispose of his\r\npersonal estate.’ When I mention these rights of an alien, I must be\r\nunderstood of alien friends only, or such whose countries are in peace\r\nwith ours; for alien enemies have no rights, no privileges, unless by\r\nthe King’s special favor during the time of war.’Blackstone, B.1. c.10.\r\npage 372. ‘An alien friend may have personal actions, but not real; an\r\nalien enemy shall have neither real, personal, nor mixed actions. The\r\nreason why an alien friend is allowed to maintain a personal action is,\r\nbecause he would otherwise be incapacitated to merchandise, which may be\r\nas much to our prejudice as his.’ Cunningham’s Law Diet, title, Aliens.\r\nThe above is the clear law of England, practised from the earliest ages\r\nto this day, and never denied. The passage quoted by M. de Meusnier from\r\nBlack-stone, c.26. is from his chapter ‘Of title to things personal\r\nby occupancy.’ The word ‘personal’ shows that nothing in this chapter\r\nrelates to lands which are real estate; and therefore, this passage does\r\nnot contradict the one before quoted from the same author (1.B. c.10.),\r\nwhich says, that the lands of an alien belong to the King. The words,\r\n‘of title by occupancy,’ show, that it does not relate to debts, which\r\nbeing a moral existence only, cannot be the subject of occupancy.\r\nBlackstone, in this passage (B.2. c.26.), speaks only of personal goods\r\nof an alien, which another may find and seize as prime occupant.\r\n\r\nPage 193. ‘_Le remboursement presentera des difficultés des sommes\r\nconsidérables_,’ &c. There is no difficulty nor doubt on this subject.\r\nEvery one is sensible how this is to be ultimately settled. Neither\r\nthe British creditor, nor the State, will be permitted to lose by these\r\npayments. The debtor will be credited for what he paid, according to\r\nwhat it was really worth at the time he paid it, and he must pay the\r\nbalance. Nor does he lose by this; for if a man who owed one thousand\r\ndollars to a British merchant, paid eight hundred paper dollars into\r\nthe treasury, when the depreciation was at eight for one, it is clear he\r\npaid but one hundred real dollars, and must now pay nine hundred. It is\r\nprobable he received those eight hundred dollars for one hundred bushels\r\nof wheat, which were never worth more than one hundred silver dollars.\r\nHe is credited, therefore, the full worth of his wheat. The equivoque is\r\nin the use of the word ‘dollar.’\r\n\r\nPage 226. ‘_Qu’on abolisse les privilèges du clergé_.’ This privilege,\r\noriginally allowed to the clergy, is now extended to every man, and even\r\nto women. It is a right of exemption from capital punishment for the\r\nfirst offence in most cases. It is then a pardon by the law. In other\r\ncases, the Executive gives the pardon. But when laws are made as mild as\r\nthey should be, both those pardons are absurd. The principle of Beccaria\r\nis sound. Let the legislators be merciful, but the executors of the law\r\ninexorable. As the term ‘privilèges du clergé’ may be misunderstood\r\nby foreigners, perhaps it will be better to strike it out here and\r\nsubstitute the word ‘pardon.’\r\n\r\nPage 239. ‘_Les commissaires veulent_,’ &c. Manslaughter is the killing\r\na man with design, but in a sudden gust of passion, and where the killer\r\nhas not had time to cool. The first offence is not punished capitally,\r\nbut the second is. This is the law of England and of all the American\r\nStates; and is not a new proposition. Those laws have supposed that a\r\nman, whose passions have so much dominion over him, as to lead him to\r\nrepeated acts of murder, is unsafe to society: that it is better he\r\nshould be put to death by the law, than others more innocent than\r\nhimself on the movements of his impetuous passions.\r\n\r\nIbid. ‘_Mal-aisé d’indiquer la nuance précise,_’ &c. In forming a scale\r\nof crimes and punishments, two considerations have principal weight. 1.\r\nThe atrocity of the crime. 2. The peculiar circumstances of a country,\r\nwhich furnish greater temptations to commit it, or greater facilities\r\nfor escaping detection, The punishment must be heavier to counterbalance\r\nthis. Were the first the only consideration, all nations would form the\r\nsame scale. But as the circumstances of a country have influence on\r\nthe punishment, and no two countries exist precisely under the same\r\ncircumstances, no two countries will form the same scale of crimes and\r\npunishments. For example; in America the inhabitants let their horses go\r\nat large in the uninclosed lands which are so extensive as to maintain\r\nthem altogether. It is easy, therefore, to steal them and easy to\r\nescape. Therefore the laws are obliged to oppose these temptations with\r\na heavier degree of punishment. For this reason the stealing of a horse\r\nin America is punished more severely, than stealing the same value in\r\nany other form. In Europe where horses are confined so securely, that it\r\nis impossible to steal them, that species of theft need not be punished\r\nmore severely than any other. In some countries of Europe, stealing\r\nfruit from trees in punished capitally. The reason is, that it being\r\nimpossible to lock fruit trees up in coffers, as we do our money, it is\r\nimpossible to oppose physical bars to this species of theft. Moral ones\r\nare therefore opposed by the laws. This to an unreflecting American\r\nappears the most enormous of all the abuses of power; because he has\r\nbeen used to see fruits hanging in such quantities, that if not taken by\r\nmen they would rot: he has been used to consider them therefore as of\r\nno value, and as not furnishing materials for the commission of a\r\ncrime. This must serve as an apology for the arrangement of crimes and\r\npunishments in the scale under our consideration. A different one would\r\nbe formed here; and still different ones in Italy, Turkey, China, &c.\r\n\r\nPage 240. ‘_Les officiers Americains,_’ &c. to page 264, ‘_qui le\r\nméritoient_.’ I would propose to new-model this section in the following\r\nmanner, 1. Give a succinct history of the origin and establishment of\r\nthe Cincinnati. 2. Examine whether in its present form it threatens\r\nany dangers to the State. 3. Propose the most practicable method of\r\npreventing them.\r\n\r\nHaving been in America during the period in which this institution was\r\nformed, and being then in a situation which gave me opportunities\r\nof seeing it in all its stages, I may venture to give M. de Meusnier\r\nmaterials for the first branch of the preceding distribution of the\r\nsubject. The second and third he will best execute himself. I should\r\nwrite its history in the following form. When on the close of that war\r\nwhich established the independence of America, its army was about to be\r\ndisbanded, the officers, who, during the course of it, had gone through\r\nthe most trying scenes together, who by mutual aids and good offices\r\nhad become dear to one another, felt with great oppression of mind the\r\napproach of that moment which was to separate them, never perhaps to\r\nmeet again. They were from different States, and from distant parts\r\nof the same State. Hazard alone could therefore give them but rare and\r\npartial occasions of seeing each other. They were of course to abandon\r\naltogether the hope of ever meeting again, or to devise some occasion\r\nwhich might bring them together. And why not come together on purpose\r\nat stated times? Would not the trouble of such a journey be greatly\r\noverpaid by the pleasure of seeing each other again, by the sweetest\r\nof all consolations, the talking over the scenes of difficulty and of\r\nendearment they had gone through? This too would enable them to know who\r\nof them should succeed in the world, who should be unsuccessful, and\r\nto open the purses of all to every laboring brother. This idea was too\r\nsoothing not to be cherished in conversation. It was improved into\r\nthat of a regular association, with an organized administration, with\r\nperiodical meetings, general and particular, fixed contributions for\r\nthose who should be in distress, and a badge by which not only those\r\nwho had not had occasion to become personally known should be able to\r\nrecognise one another, but which should be worn by their descendants,\r\nto perpetuate among them the friendships which had bound their ancestors\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington was, at that moment, oppressed with the operation\r\nof disbanding an army which was not paid, and the difficulty of this\r\noperation was increased, by some two or three States having expressed\r\nsentiments, which did not indicate a sufficient attention to their\r\npayment. He was sometimes present, when his officers were fashioning, in\r\ntheir conversations, their newly proposed society. He saw the innocence\r\nof its origin, and foresaw no effects less innocent. He was, at that\r\ntime, writing his valedictory letter to the States, which has been so\r\ndeservedly applauded by the world. Far from thinking it a moment to\r\nmultiply the causes of irritation, by thwarting a proposition which had\r\nabsolutely no other basis but that of benevolence and friendship, he was\r\nrather satisfied to find himself aided in his difficulties by this new\r\nincident, which occupied, and, at the same time, soothed the minds\r\nof the officers. He thought, too, that this institution would be\r\none instrument the more, for strengthening the federal bond, and for\r\npromoting federal ideas. The institution was formed. They incorporated\r\ninto it the officers of the French army and navy, by whose sides they\r\nhad fought, and with whose aid they had finally prevailed, extending it\r\nto such grades, as they were told might be permitted to enter into it.\r\nThey sent an officer to France, to make the proposition to them, and to\r\nprocure the badges which they had devised for their order. The moment of\r\ndisbanding the army having come, before they could have a full meeting\r\nto appoint their President, the General was prayed to act in that office\r\ntill their first general meeting, which was to be held at Philadelphia,\r\nin the month of May following.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the society were published. Men who read them in their\r\nclosers, unwarmed by those sentiments of friendship which had produced\r\nthem, inattentive to those pains which an approaching separation had\r\nexcited in the minds of the instituters, politicians, who see in every\r\nthing only the dangers with which it threatens civil society, in fine,\r\nthe laboring people, who, shielded by equal laws, had never seen any\r\ndifference between man and man, but had read of terrible oppressions,\r\nwhich people of their description experience in other countries, from\r\nthose who are distinguished by titles and badges, began to be alarmed at\r\nthis new institution. A remarkable silence, however, was observed.\r\nTheir solicitudes were long confined within the circles of private\r\nconversation. At length, however, a Mr. Burke, Chief Justice of South\r\nCarolina, broke that silence. He wrote against the new institution,\r\nforeboding its dangers, very imperfectly indeed, because he had nothing\r\nbut his imagination to aid him. An American could do no more; for to\r\ndetail the real evils of aristocracy, they must be seen in Europe.\r\nBurke’s fears were thought exaggerations in America; while in Europe,\r\nit is known that even Mirabeau has but faintly sketched the curses of\r\nhereditary aristocracy, as they are experienced here, and as they would\r\nhave followed in America, had this institution remained. The epigraph\r\nof Burke’s pamphlet, was ‘Blow ye the trumpet in Zion.’ Its effect\r\ncorresponded with its epigraph. This institution became, first, the\r\nsubject of general conversation. Next, it was made the subject of\r\ndeliberation in the legislative Assemblies of some of the States. The\r\nGovernor of South Carolina censured it, in an address to the Assembly\r\nof that State. The Assemblies of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and\r\nPennsylvania condemned its principles. No circumstance, indeed, brought\r\nthe consideration of it expressly before Congress; yet it had sunk deep\r\ninto their minds. An offer having been made to them, on the part of\r\nthe Polish order of Divine Providence, to receive some of their\r\ndistinguished citizens into that order, they made that an occasion to\r\ndeclare, that these distinctions were contrary to the principles of\r\ntheir Confederation.\r\n\r\nThe uneasiness excited by this institution had very early caught the\r\nnotice of General Washington. Still recollecting all the purity of the\r\nmotives which gave it birth, he became sensible that it might produce\r\npolitical evils, which the warmth of those motives had masked. Add to\r\nthis, that it was disapproved by the mass of citizens of the Union.\r\nThis, alone, was reason strong enough, in a country where the will\r\nof the majority is the law, and ought to be the law. He saw that\r\nthe objects of the institution were too light to be opposed to\r\nconsiderations as serious as these; and that it was become necessary to\r\nannihilate it absolutely. On this, therefore, he was decided. The\r\nfirst annual meeting at Philadelphia was now at hand; he went to that,\r\ndetermined to exert all his influence for its suppression. He proposed\r\nit to his fellow officers, and urged it with all his powers. It met an\r\nopposition which was observed to cloud his face with an anxiety, that\r\nthe most distressful scenes of the war had scarcely ever produced. It\r\nwas canvassed for several days, and, at length, it was no more a doubt,\r\nwhat would be its ultimate fate. The order was on the point of receiving\r\nits annihilation, by the vote of a great majority of its members. In\r\nthis moment, their envoy arrived from France, charged with letters from\r\nthe French officers, accepting with cordiality the proposed badges of\r\nunion, with solicitations from others to be received into the order,\r\nand with notice that their respectable Sovereign had been pleased\r\nto recognise it, and to permit his officers to wear its badges. The\r\nprospect was now changed. The question assumed a new form. After the\r\noffer made by them, and accepted by their friends, in what words\r\ncould they clothe a proposition to retract it, which would not cover\r\nthemselves with the reproaches of levity and ingratitude? which would\r\nnot appear an insult to those whom they loved? Federal principles,\r\npopular discontent, were considerations, whose weight was known and felt\r\nby themselves. But would foreigners know and feel them equally? Would\r\nthey so far acknowledge their cogency, as to permit, without any\r\nindignation, the eagle and ribbon to be torn from their breasts, by\r\nthe very hands which had placed them there? The idea revolted the whole\r\nsociety. They found it necessary, then, to preserve so much of their\r\ninstitution as might continue to support this foreign branch, while they\r\nshould prune off every other, which would give offence to their fellow\r\ncitizens: thus sacrificing, on each hand, to their friends and to their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe society was to retain its existence, its name, its meetings, and\r\nits charitable funds: but these last were to be deposited with their\r\nrespective legislatures. The order was to be no longer hereditary; a\r\nreformation, which had been pressed even from this side the Atlantic; it\r\nwas to be communicated to no new members; the general meetings, instead\r\nof annual, were to be triennial only. The eagle and ribbon, indeed, were\r\nretained, because they were worn, and they wished them to be worn, by\r\ntheir friends who were in a country where they would not be objects\r\nof offence; but themselves never wore them. They laid them up in their\r\nbureaus, with the medals of American Independence, with those of the\r\ntrophies they had taken, and the battles they had won. But through all\r\nthe United States, no officer is seen to offend the public eye with the\r\ndisplay of this badge. These changes have tranquillized the American\r\nStates. Their citizens feel too much interest in the reputation of their\r\nofficers, and value too much whatever may serve to recall to the memory\r\nof their allies, the moments wherein they formed but one people, not to\r\ndo justice to the circumstance which prevented a total annihilation of\r\nthe order. Though they are obliged by a prudent foresight, to keep out\r\nevery thing from among themselves, which might pretend to divide them\r\ninto orders, and to degrade one description of men below another, yet\r\nthey hear with pleasure, that their allies, whom circumstances have\r\nalready placed under these distinctions, are willing to consider it as\r\none, to have aided them in the establishment of their liberties, and to\r\nwear a badge which may recall them to their remembrance; and it would\r\nbe an extreme affliction to them, if the domestic reformation which has\r\nbeen found necessary, if the censures of individual writers, or if any\r\nother circumstance, should discourage the wearing of their badge, or\r\nlessen its reputation.\r\n\r\nThis short but true, history of the order of the Cincinnati, taken from\r\nthe mouths of persons on the spot, who were privy to its origin and\r\nprogress, and who know its present state, is the best apology which can\r\nbe made for an institution, which appeared to be, and was really, so\r\nheterogeneous to the governments in which it was erected.\r\n\r\nIt should be further considered, that, in America, no other distinction\r\nbetween man and man had ever been known, but that of persons in office,\r\nexercising powers by authority of the laws, and private individuals.\r\nAmong these last, the poorest laborer stood on equal ground with the\r\nwealthiest millionary, and generally, on a more favored one, whenever\r\ntheir rights seemed to jar. It has been seen that a shoemaker, or other\r\nartisan, removed by the voice of his country from his work-bench, into a\r\nchair of office, has instantly commanded all the respect and obedience,\r\nwhich the laws ascribe to his office. But of distinctions by birth or\r\nbadge, they had no more idea than they had of the mode of existence in\r\nthe moon or planets. They had heard only that there were such, and knew\r\nthat they must be wrong. A due horror of the evils which flow from these\r\ndistinctions, could be excited in Europe only, where the dignity of man\r\nis lost in arbitrary distinctions, where the human species is classed\r\ninto several stages of degradation, where the many are crouched under\r\nthe weight of the few, and where the order established can present to\r\nthe contemplation of a thinking being, no other picture, than that\r\nof God Almighty and his angels, trampling under foot the host of the\r\ndamned. No wonder, then, that the institution of the Cincinnati should\r\nbe innocently conceived by one order of American citizens, should raise\r\nin the other orders, only a slow, temperate, and rational opposition,\r\nand should be viewed in Europe as a detestable parricide.\r\n\r\nThe second and third branches of this subject, nobody can better execute\r\nthan M. de Meusnier. Perhaps it may be curious to him to see how they\r\nstrike an American mind at present. He shall, therefore, have the ideas\r\nof one, who was an enemy to the institution from the first moment of\r\nits conception, but who was always sensible, that the officers neither\r\nforesaw nor intended the injury they were doing to their country.\r\n\r\nAs to the question, then, whether any evil can proceed from the\r\ninstitution, as it stands at present, I am of opinion there may. 1.\r\nFrom the meetings. These will keep the officers formed into a body; will\r\ncontinue a distinction between the civil and military, which, it would\r\nbe for the good of the whole to obliterate, as soon as possible; and\r\nmilitary assemblies will not only keep alive the jealousies and fears of\r\nthe civil government, but give ground for these fears and jealousies. For\r\nwhen men meet together, they will make business, if they have none; they\r\nwill collate their grievances, some real, some imaginary, all highly\r\npainted; they will communicate to each other the sparks of discontent;\r\nand these may engender a flame, which will consume their particular, as\r\nwell as the general happiness. 2. The charitable part of the institution\r\nis still more likely to do mischief, as it perpetuates the dangers\r\napprehended in the preceding clause. For here is a fund provided, of\r\npermanent existence. To whom will it belong? To the descendants of\r\nAmerican officers, of a certain description. These descendants, then,\r\nwill form a body, having a sufficient interest to keep up an attention\r\nto their description, to continue meetings, and perhaps, in some moment,\r\nwhen the political eye shall be slumbering, or the firmness of their\r\nfellow citizens relaxed, to replace the insignia of the order, and\r\nrevive all its pretensions. What good can the officers propose, which\r\nmay weigh against these possible evils? The securing their descendants\r\nagainst want? Why afraid to trust them to the same fertile soil, and\r\nthe same genial climate, which will secure from want the descendants\r\nof their other fellow citizens? Are they afraid they will be reduced to\r\nlabor the earth for their sustenance? They will be rendered thereby both\r\nmore honest and happy. An industrious farmer occupies a more dignified\r\nplace in the scale of beings, whether moral or political, than a lazy\r\nlounger, valuing himself on his family, too proud to work, and drawing\r\nout a miserable existence, by eating on that surplus of other men’s\r\nlabor, which is the sacred fund of the helpless poor. A pitiful annuity\r\nwill only prevent them from exerting that industry and those talents,\r\nwhich would soon lead them to better fortune.\r\n\r\nHow are these evils to be prevented? 1. At their first general meeting,\r\nlet them distribute the funds on hand to the existing objects of their\r\ndestination, and discontinue all further contributions. 2. Let them\r\ndeclare, at the same time, that their meetings, general and particular,\r\nshall thenceforth cease. 3. Let them melt up their eagles, and add\r\nthe mass to the distributable fund, that their descendants may have no\r\ntemptation to hang them in their button-holes.\r\n\r\nThese reflections are not proposed as worthy the notice of M. de\r\nMeusnier. He will be so good as to treat the subject in his own way, and\r\nno body has a better. I will only pray him to avail us of his forcible\r\nmanner, to evince that there is evil to be apprehended, even from the\r\nashes of this institution, and to exhort the society in America to\r\nmake their reformation complete; bearing in mind, that we must keep the\r\npassions of men on our side, even when we are persuading them to do what\r\nthey ought to do.\r\n\r\nPage 268. ‘_Et en effet la population_,’ &c. Page 270. ‘_Plus de\r\nconfiance_.’\r\n\r\nTo this, we answer, that no such census of the numbers was ever given\r\nout by Congress, nor ever presented to them: and further, that\r\nCongress never have, at any time, declared by their vote, the number of\r\ninhabitants in their respective States. On the 22nd of June, 1775, they\r\nfirst resolved to emit paper money. The sum resolved on was two millions\r\nof dollars. They declared, then, that the twelve confederate colonies\r\n(for Georgia had not yet joined them) should be pledged for the\r\nredemption of these bills. To ascertain in what proportion each State\r\nshould be bound, the members from each were desired to say, as nearly as\r\nthey could, what was the number of the inhabitants of their respective\r\nStates. They were very much unprepared for such a declaration. They\r\nguessed, however, as well as they could. The following are the numbers,\r\nas they conjectured them, and the consequent apportionment of the two\r\nmillions of dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Population Estimates--1775, page422]\r\n\r\nGeorgia, having not yet acceded to the measures of the other States, was\r\nnot quotaed; but her numbers were generally estimated at about thirty\r\nthousand, and so would have made the whole, two million four hundred\r\nand forty-eight thousand persons, of every condition. But it is to\r\nbe observed, that though Congress made this census the basis of their\r\napportionment, yet they did not even give it a place on their journals;\r\nmuch less, publish it to the world with their sanction. The way it got\r\nabroad was this. As the members declared from their seats the number of\r\ninhabitants which they conjectured to be in their State, the secretary\r\nof Congress wrote them on a piece of paper, calculated the portion of\r\ntwo millions of dollars, to be paid by each, and entered the sum only in\r\nthe journals. The members, however, for their own satisfaction, and the\r\ninformation of their States, took copies of this enumeration, and sent\r\nthem to their States. From thence, they got into the public papers: and\r\nwhen the English news-writers found it answer their purpose to compare\r\nthis with the enumeration of 1783, as their principle is ‘to lie boldly,\r\nthat they may not be suspected of lying,’ they made it amount to three\r\nmillions one hundred and thirty-seven thousand eight hundred and nine,\r\nand ascribed its publication to Congress itself.\r\n\r\nin April, 1785, Congress being to call on the States to raise a million\r\nand a half of dollars annually, for twenty-five years, it was necessary\r\nto apportion this among them. The States had never furnished them with\r\ntheir exact numbers. It was agreed, too, that in this apportionment,\r\nfive slaves should be counted as three freemen only. The preparation\r\nof this business was in the hands of a committee; they applied to the\r\nmembers for the best information they could give them, of the numbers\r\nof their States. Some of the States had taken pains to discover their\r\nnumbers. Others had done nothing in that way, and, of course, were now\r\nwhere they were in 1775, when their members were first called on to\r\ndeclare their numbers. Under these circumstances, and on the principle\r\nof counting three fifths only of the slaves, the committee apportioned\r\nthe money among the States, and reported their work to Congress. In\r\nthis, they had assessed South Carolina as having one hundred and seventy\r\nthousand inhabitants. The delegates for that State, however, prevailed\r\non Congress to assess them on the footing of one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand only, in consideration of the state of total devastation, in\r\nwhich the enemy had left their country. The difference was then laid on\r\nthe other States, and the following was the result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Population Estimates--1785, page424]\r\n\r\nStill, however, Congress refused to give the enumeration the sanction of\r\na place on their journals, because it was not formed on such evidence,\r\nas a strict attention to accuracy and truth required. They used it from\r\nnecessity, because they could get no better rule, and they entered on\r\ntheir journals only the apportionment of money. The members, however, as\r\nbefore, took copies of the enumeration, which was the ground work of\r\nthe apportionment, sent them to their States, and thus, this second\r\nenumeration got into the public papers, and was, by the English,\r\nascribed to Congress, as their declaration of their present numbers.\r\nTo get at the real numbers which this enumeration supposes, we must add\r\ntwenty thousand to the number, on which South Carolina was quotaed; we\r\nmust consider, that seven hundred thousand slaves are counted but as\r\nfour hundred and twenty thousand persons, and add, on that account, two\r\nhundred and eighty thousand. This will give us a total of two millions\r\nsix hundred and thirty-nine thousand three hundred inhabitants, of every\r\ncondition, in the thirteen States; being two hundred and twenty-one\r\nthousand three hundred more, than the enumeration of 1775, instead of\r\nseven hundred and ninety-eight thousand five hundred and nine less,\r\nwhich the English papers asserted to be the diminution of numbers, in\r\nthe United States, according to the confession of Congress themselves.\r\n\r\nPage 272.’_Comportera, peut être, une population de 30,000,000_.’ The\r\nterritory of the United States contains about a million of square miles,\r\nEnglish. There is, in them, a greater proportion of fertile lands, than\r\nin the British dominions in Europe. Suppose the territory of the United\r\nStates, then, to attain an equal degree of population, with the British\r\nEuropean dominions; they will have an hundred millions of inhabitants.\r\nLet us extend our views to what may be the population of the two\r\ncontinents of North and South America, supposing them divided at the\r\nnarrowest part of the isthmus of Panama. Between this line and that\r\nof 50° of north latitude, the northern continent contains about five\r\nmillions of square miles, and south of this line of division, the\r\nsouthern continent contains about seven millions of square miles. I do\r\nnot pass the 50th degree of northern latitude in my reckoning, because\r\nwe must draw a line somewhere, and considering the soil and climate\r\nbeyond that, I would only avail my calculation of it, as a make-weight,\r\nto make good what the colder regions, within that line, may be supposed\r\nto fall short in their future population. Here are twelve millions of\r\nsquare miles, then, which, at the rate of population before assumed,\r\nwill nourish twelve hundred millions of inhabitants, a number greater\r\nthan the present population of the whole globe is supposed to amount to.\r\nIf those who propose medals for the resolution of questions, about which\r\nnobody makes any question, those who have invited discussion on the\r\npretended problem, Whether the discovery of America was for the good\r\nof mankind? if they, I say, would have viewed it only as doubling\r\nthe numbers of mankind, and, of course, the quantum of existence and\r\nhappiness, they might have saved the money and the reputation which\r\ntheir proposition has cost them. The present population of the inhabited\r\nparts of the United States is of about ten to the square mile; and\r\nexperience has shown us, that wherever we reach that, the inhabitants\r\nbecome uneasy, as too much compressed, and go off, in great numbers,\r\nto search for vacant country. Within forty years, their whole territory\r\nwill be peopled at that rate. We may fix that, then, as the term, beyond\r\nwhich the people of those States will not be restrained within their\r\npresent limits; we may fix that population, too, as the limit which they\r\nwill not exceed, till the whole of those two continents are filled up\r\nto that mark; that is to say, till they shall contain one hundred and\r\ntwenty millions of inhabitants. The soil of the country, on the western\r\nside of the Mississippi, its climate, and its vicinity to the United\r\nStates, point it out as the first which will receive population from\r\nthat nest. The present occupiers will just have force enough to repress\r\nand restrain the emigrations, to a certain degree of consistence. We\r\nhave seen, lately, a single person go, and decide on a settlement in\r\nKentucky, many hundred miles from any white inhabitant, remove thither\r\nwith his family and a few neighbors, and though perpetually harassed\r\nby the Indians, that settlement in the course of ten years has acquired\r\nthirty thousand inhabitants; its numbers are increasing while we are\r\nwriting, and the State, of which it formerly made a part, has offered it\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nPage 280, line five. ‘_Huit des onze Etats_,’ &c. Say, ‘there were ten\r\nStates present; six voted unanimously for it, three against it, and one\r\nwas divided: and seven votes being requisite to decide the proposition\r\naffirmatively, it was lost. The voice of a single individual of the\r\nState which was divided, or of one of those which were of the negative,\r\nwould have prevented this abominable crime from spreading itself over\r\nthe new country. Thus we see the fate of millions unborn, hanging on the\r\ntongue of one man, and Heaven was silent in that awful moment! But it\r\nis to be hoped it will not always be silent, and that the friends to the\r\nrights of human nature will, in the end, prevail.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of March, 1785, it was moved in Congress, that the same\r\nproposition should be referred to a committee, and it was referred by\r\nthe votes of eight States against three. We do not hear that any thing\r\nfurther is yet done on it.’\r\n\r\nPage 286. ‘_L’autorité du Congrès étoit nécessaire_.’ The substance of\r\nthe passage alluded to, in the journal of Congress, May the 26th, 1784,\r\nis, ‘That the authority of Congress to make requisitions of troops,\r\nduring peace, is questioned; that such an authority would be dangerous,\r\ncombined with the acknowledged one of emitting or of borrowing money;\r\nand that a few troops only, being wanted, to guard magazines and\r\ngarrison the frontier posts, it would be more proper, at present, to\r\nrecommend than to require.’\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson presents his compliments to M. de Meusnier, and sends him\r\ncopies of the thirteenth, twenty-third, and twenty-fourth articles of\r\nthe treaty between the King of Prussia and the United States.\r\n\r\nIf M. de Meusnier proposes to mention the facts of cruelty, of which\r\nhe and Mr Jefferson spoke yesterday, the twenty-fourth article will\r\nintroduce them properly, because they produced a sense of the necessity\r\nof that article. These facts are, 1. The death of upwards of eleven\r\nthousand American prisoners, in one prison-ship (the Jersey), and in the\r\nspace of three years. 2. General Howe’s permitting our prisoners, taken\r\nat the battle of Germantown, and placed under a guard, in the yard\r\nof the State-house of Philadelphia, to be so long without any food\r\nfurnished them, that many perished with hunger. Where the bodies lay,\r\nit was seen that they had eaten all the grass around them, within their\r\nreach, after they had lost the power of rising or moving from their\r\nplace. 3. The second fact was the act of a commanding officer: the\r\nfirst, of several commanding officers, and, for so long a time, as must\r\nsuppose the approbation of government. But the following was the act\r\nof government itself. During the periods that our affairs seemed\r\nunfavorable, and theirs successful, that is to say, after the evacuation\r\nof New York, and again after the taking of Charleston, in South\r\nCarolina, they regularly sent our prisoners, taken on the seas and\r\ncarried to England, to the East Indies. This is so certain, that in\r\nthe month of November or December, 1785, Mr. Adams having officially\r\ndemanded a delivery of the American prisoners sent to the East Indies,\r\nLord Caermarthen answered, officially, ‘that orders were immediately\r\nissued for their discharge.’ M. de Meusnier is at liberty to quote this\r\nfact. 4. A fact, to be ascribed not only to the government, but to the\r\nparliament, who passed an act for that purpose, in the beginning of the\r\nwar, was the obliging our prisoners, taken at sea, to join them, and\r\nfight against their countrymen. This they effected by starving and\r\nwhipping them. The insult on Captain Stanhope, which happened at Boston\r\nlast year, was a consequence of this. Two persons, Dunbar and Lowthorp,\r\nwhom Stanhope had treated in this manner (having particularly inflicted\r\ntwenty-four lashes on Dunbar), meeting him at Boston, attempted to beat\r\nhim. But the people interposed, and saved him. The fact is referred to\r\nin that paragraph of the Declaration of Independence, which says, ‘He\r\nhas constrained our fellow citizens, taken captive on the high seas,\r\nto bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their\r\nfriends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.’ This was\r\nthe most afflicting to our prisoners, of all the cruelties exercised on\r\nthem. The others affected the body only, but this the mind; they were\r\nhaunted by the horror of having, perhaps, themselves shot the ball by\r\nwhich a father or a brother fell. Some of them had constancy enough to\r\nhold out against half-allowance of food and repeated whippings. These\r\nwere generally sent to England, and from thence to the East Indies. One\r\nof them escaped from the East Indies, and got back to Paris, where he\r\ngave an account of his sufferings to Mr. Adams, who happened to be then\r\nat Paris.\r\n\r\nM. de Meusnier, where he mentions that the slave-law has been passed\r\nin Virginia, without the clause of emancipation, is pleased to mention,\r\nthat neither Mr. Wythe nor Mr. Jefferson was present, to make the\r\nproposition they had meditated; from which, people, who do not give\r\nthemselves the trouble to reflect or inquire, might conclude, hastily,\r\nthat their absence was the cause why the proposition was not made; and,\r\nof course, that there were not, in the Assembly, persons of virtue and\r\nfirmness enough to propose the clause for emancipation. This supposition\r\nwould not be true. There were persons there, who wanted neither the\r\nvirtue to propose, nor talents to enforce the proposition, had they seen\r\nthat the disposition of the legislature was ripe for it. These worthy\r\ncharacters would feel themselves wounded, degraded, and discouraged by\r\nthis idea. Mr. Jefferson would therefore be obliged to M. de Meusnier to\r\nmention it in some such manner as this. ‘Of the two commissioners, who\r\nhad concerted the amendatory clause for the gradual emancipation\r\nof slaves, Mr. Wythe could not be present, he being a member of the\r\njudiciary department, and Mr. Jefferson was absent on the legation\r\nto France. But there were not wanting in that Assembly, men of virtue\r\nenough to propose, and talents to vindicate this clause. But they saw,\r\nthat the moment of doing it with success, was not yet arrived, and that\r\nan unsuccessful effort, as too often happens, would only rivet still\r\ncloser the chains of bondage, and retard the moment of delivery to\r\nthis oppressed description of men. What a stupendous, what an\r\nincomprehensible machine is man! who can endure toil, famine, stripes,\r\nimprisonment, and death itself, in vindication of his own liberty, and,\r\nthe next moment, be deaf to all those motives whose power supported him\r\nthrough his trial, and inflict on his fellow men a bondage, one hour of\r\nwhich is fraught with more misery, than ages of that which he rose in\r\nrebellion to oppose! But we must await, with patience, the workings\r\nof an overruling Providence, and hope that that is preparing the\r\ndeliverance of these our suffering brethren. When the measure of their\r\ntears shall be full, when their groans shall have involved heaven itself\r\nin darkness, doubtless, a God of justice will awaken to their distress,\r\nand by diffusing light and liberality among their oppressors, or, at\r\nlength, by his exterminating thunder, manifest his attention to the\r\nthings of this world, and that they are not left to the guidance of a\r\nblind fatality.’\r\n\r\n     [The following are the articles of the treaty with Prussia,\r\n     referred to in the preceding observations.]\r\n\r\nArticle 13. And in the same case, of one of the contracting parties\r\nbeing engaged in war with any other power, to prevent all the\r\ndifficulties and misunderstandings, that usually arise respecting the\r\nmerchandise heretofore called contraband, such as arms, ammunition, and\r\nmilitary stores of every kind, no such articles, carried in the vessels,\r\nor by the subjects or citizens of one of the parties, to the enemies of\r\nthe other, shall be deemed contraband, so as to induce confiscation or\r\ncondemnation, and a loss of property to individuals. Nevertheless, it\r\nshall be lawful to stop such vessels and articles, and to detain them\r\nfor such length of time, as the captors may think necessary to prevent\r\nthe inconvenience or damage that might ensue from their proceeding,\r\npaying, however, a reasonable compensation for the loss such arrest\r\nshall occasion to the proprietors: and it shall further be allowed\r\nto use, in the service of the captors, the whole or any part of the\r\nmilitary stores so detained, paying the owners the full value of\r\nthe same, to be ascertained by the current price at the place of its\r\ndestination. But in the case supposed, of a vessel stopped for articles\r\nheretofore deemed contraband, if the master of the vessel stopped will\r\ndeliver out the goods supposed to be of contraband nature, he shall be\r\nadmitted to do it, and the vessel shall not, in that case be carried\r\ninto any port, nor further detained, but shall be allowed to proceed on\r\nher voyage.\r\n\r\nArticle 23. If war should arise between the two contracting parties,\r\nthe merchants of either country, then residing in the other, shall be\r\nallowed to remain nine months to collect their debts, and settle their\r\naffairs, and may depart freely, carrying off all their effects, without\r\nmolestation or hindrance: and all women and children, scholars of\r\nevery faculty, cultivators of the earth, artisans, manufacturers, and\r\nfishermen, unarmed, and inhabiting unfortified towns, villages, or\r\nplaces, and, in general, all others whose occupations are for the common\r\nsubsistence and benefit of mankind, shall be allowed to continue their\r\nrespective employments, and shall not be molested in their persons, nor\r\nshall their houses be burned or otherwise destroyed, nor their fields\r\nwasted by the armed force of the enemy, into whose power, by the events\r\nof war, they may happen to fall: but if any thing is necessary to be\r\ntaken from them, for the use of such armed force, the same shall be\r\npaid for at a reasonable price. And all merchant and trading vessels,\r\nemployed in exchanging the products of different places, and thereby\r\nrendering the necessaries, conveniences, and comforts of human life more\r\neasy to be obtained, and more general, shall be allowed to pass free and\r\nunmolested. And neither of the contracting parties shall grant or issue\r\nany commission to any private armed vessels, empowering them to take or\r\ndestroy such trading vessels, or interrupt such commerce.\r\n\r\nArticle 24. And to prevent the destruction of prisoners of war, by\r\nsending them into distant and inclement countries, or by crowding them\r\ninto close and noxious places, the two contracting parties solemnly\r\npledge themselves to each other and the world, that they will not adopt\r\nany such practice: that neither will send the prisoners whom they may\r\ntake from the other, into the East Indies or any other parts of Asia or\r\nAfrica: but that they shall be placed in some part of their dominions\r\nin Europe or America, in wholesome situations; that they shall not be\r\nconfined in dungeons, prison-ships, nor prisons, nor be put into irons,\r\nnor bound, nor otherwise restrained in the use of their limbs. That\r\nthe officers shall be enlarged, on their paroles, within convenient\r\ndistricts, and have comfortable quarters, and the common men be disposed\r\nin cantonments, open and extensive enough for air and exercise, and\r\nlodged in barracks as roomy and good, as are provided by the party, in\r\nwhose power they are, for their own troops; that the officers shall\r\nbe daily furnished by the party, in whose power they are, with as many\r\nrations, and of the same articles and quality, as are allowed by them,\r\neither in kind or by commutation, to officers of equal rank in their own\r\narmy; and all others shall be daily furnished by them, with such rations\r\nas they allow to a common soldier in their own service; the value\r\nwhereof shall be paid by the other party, on a mutual adjustment of\r\naccounts for the subsistence of prisoners, at the close of the war:\r\nand the said accounts shall not be mingled with, or set off against any\r\nothers, nor the balances due on them, be withheld as a satisfaction\r\nor reprisal for any other article, or for any other cause, real\r\nor pretended, whatever. That each party shall be allowed to keep a\r\ncommissary of prisoners, of their own appointment, with every separate\r\ncantonment of prisoners in possession of the other, which commissary\r\nshall see the prisoners as often as he pleases, shall be allowed to\r\nreceive and distribute whatever comforts may be sent to them by their\r\nfriends, and shall be free to make his reports, in open letters, to\r\nthose who employ him. But if any officer shall break his parole, or any\r\nother prisoner shall escape from the limits of his cantonment, after\r\nthey shall have been designated to him, such individual officer, or\r\nother prisoner, shall forfeit so much of the benefit of this article,\r\nas provides for his enlargement on parole or cantonment. And it is\r\ndeclared, that neither the pretence that war dissolves all treaties, nor\r\nany other whatever, shall be considered as annulling or suspending this,\r\nor the next preceding article, but, on the contrary, that the state of\r\nwar is precisely that for which they are provided, and during which,\r\nthey are to be as sacredly observed, as the most acknowledged articles\r\nin the law of nature and nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLII.--TO MR. RITTENHOUSE, January 25,1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RITTENHOUSE.\r\n\r\nParis, January 25,1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour favor of September the 28th came to hand a few days ago. I thank\r\nyou for the details on the subject of the southern and western lines.\r\nThere remains thereon, one article, however, which I will still beg\r\nyou to inform me of; viz. how far is the western boundary beyond the\r\nmeridian of Pittsburg? This information is necessary, to enable me to\r\ntrace that boundary in my map. I shall be much gratified, also, with\r\na communication of your observations on the curiosities of the western\r\ncountry. It will not be difficult to induce me to give up the theory of\r\nthe growth of shells, without their being the nidus of animals. It is\r\nonly an idea, and not an opinion with me. In the Notes, with which I\r\ntroubled you, I had observed that there were three opinions as to the\r\norigin of these shells. 1. That they have been deposited even in the\r\nhighest mountains, by an universal deluge. 2. That they, with all the\r\ncalcareous stones and earths, are animal remains. 3. That they grow\r\nor shoot as crystals do. I find that I could swallow the last opinion,\r\nsooner than either of the others; but I have not yet swallowed it.\r\nAnother opinion might have been added, that some throe of nature has\r\nforced up parts which had been the bed of the ocean. But have we\r\nany better proof of such an effort of nature, than of her shooting a\r\nlapidific juice into the form of a shell? No such convulsion has taken\r\nplace in our time, nor within the annals of history: nor is the distance\r\ngreater, between the shooting of the lapidific juice into the form of a\r\ncrystal or a diamond, which we see, and into the form of a shell, which\r\nwe do not see, than between the forcing volcanic matter a little above\r\nthe surface, where it is in fusion, which we see, and the forcing the\r\nbed of the sea fifteen thousand feet above the ordinary surface of the\r\nearth, which we do not see. It is not possible to believe any of these\r\nhypotheses; and if we lean towards any of them, it should be only\r\ntill some other is produced, more analogous to the known operations of\r\nnature. In a letter to Mr. Hopkinson, I mentioned to him that the\r\nAbbe Rochon, who discovered the double refracting power in some of the\r\nnatural crystals, had lately made a telescope with the metal called\r\nplatina, which, while it is as susceptible of as perfect a polish as the\r\nmetal heretofore used for the specula of telescopes, is insusceptible of\r\nrust, as gold and silver are. There is a person here, who has hit on a\r\nnew method of engraving. He gives you an ink of his composition. Write\r\non copper plates, any thing of which you would wish to take several\r\ncopies, and, in an hour, the plate will be ready to strike them off; so\r\nof plans, engravings, &c. This art will be amusing to individuals, if\r\nhe should make it known. I send you herewith, the Nautical Almanacs for\r\n1786, 1787, 1788, 1789, 1790, which are as late as they are published.\r\nYou ask, how you may reimburse the expense of these trifles? I answer,\r\nby accepting them; as the procuring you a gratification, is a higher one\r\nto me than money. We have had nothing curious published lately. I do not\r\nknow whether you are fond of chemical reading. There are some things in\r\nthis science worth reading. I will send them to you, if you wish it. My\r\ndaughter is well, and joins me in respects to Mrs. Rittenhouse and the\r\nyoung ladies. After asking when we are to have the Lunarium, I will\r\nclose with assurances of the sincere regard and esteem, with which I am,\r\nDear Sir, your most obedient,\r\n\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIII.--TO A. STEWART, January 25, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. STEWART.\r\n\r\nParis, January 25, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have received your favor of the 17th of October, which, though you\r\nmention it as the third you have written me, is the first that has\r\ncome to hand. I sincerely thank you for the communications it contains.\r\nNothing is so grateful to me, at this distance, as details, both great\r\nand small, of what is passing in my own country. Of the latter, we\r\nreceive little here, because they either escape my correspondents,\r\nor are thought unworthy of notice. This, however, is a very mistaken\r\nopinion, as every one may observe, by recollecting, that when he has\r\nbeen long absent from his neighborhood, the small news of that is the\r\nmost pleasing, and occupies his first attention, either when he meets\r\nwith a person from thence, or returns thither himself. I still hope,\r\ntherefore, that the letter, in which you have been so good as to give me\r\nthe minute occurrences in the neighborhood of Monticello, may yet come\r\nto hand, and I venture to rely on the many proofs of friendship I have\r\nreceived from you for a continuance of your favors. This will be the\r\nmore meritorious, as I have nothing to give you in exchange.\r\n\r\nThe quiet of Europe at this moment furnishes little which can attract\r\nyour notice. Nor will that quiet be soon disturbed, at least for the\r\ncurrent year. Perhaps it hangs on the life of the King of Prussia, and\r\nthat hangs by a very slender thread. American reputation in Europe is\r\nnot such as to be flattering to its citizens. Two circumstances are\r\nparticularly objected to us; the nonpayment of our debts, and the want\r\nof energy in our government. These discourage a connection with us. I\r\nown it to be my opinion, that good will arise from the destruction of\r\nour credit. I see nothing else which can restrain our disposition to\r\nluxury, and to the change of those manners, which alone can preserve\r\nrepublican government. As it is impossible to prevent credit, the best\r\nway would be to cure its ill effects by giving an instantaneous recovery\r\nto the creditor. This would be reducing purchases on credit to purchases\r\nfor ready money. A man would then see a prison painted on every thing he\r\nwished, but had not ready money to pay for.\r\n\r\nI fear from an expression in your letter, that the people of Kentucky\r\nthink of separating, not only from Virginia (in which they are right),\r\nbut also from the confederacy. I own, I should think this a most\r\ncalamitous event, and such a one as every good citizen should set\r\nhimself against. Our present federal limits are not too large for good\r\ngovernment, nor will the increase of votes in Congress produce any ill\r\neffect. On the contrary, it will drown the little divisions at present\r\nexisting there. Our confederacy must be viewed as the nest from which\r\nall America, North and South, is to be peopled. We should take care,\r\ntoo, not to think it for the interest of that great continent to press\r\ntoo soon on the Spaniards. Those countries cannot be in better hands. My\r\nfear is, that they are too feeble to hold them till our population\r\ncan be sufficiently advanced to gain it from them piece by piece. The\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi we must have. This is all we are, as yet,\r\nready to receive. I have made acquaintance with a very sensible, candid\r\ngentleman here, who was in South America during the revolt which took\r\nplace there while our Revolution was going on. He says, that those\r\ndisturbances (of which we scarcely heard any thing) cost, on both sides,\r\nan hundred thousand lives.\r\n\r\nI have made a particular acquaintance here with Monsieur de Buffon, and\r\nhave a great desire to give him the best idea I can of our elk. Perhaps\r\nyour situation may enable you to aid me in this. You could not oblige me\r\nmore, than by sending me the horns, skeleton, and skin of an elk, were\r\nit possible to procure them. The most desirable form of receiving them\r\nwould be to have the skin slit from the under jaw along the belly to the\r\ntail, and down the thighs to the knee, to take the animal out, leaving\r\nthe legs and hoofs, the bones of the head, and the horns attached to\r\nthe skin. By sewing-up the belly, &c. and stuffing the skin, it would\r\npresent the form of the animal. However, as an opportunity of doing this\r\nis scarcely to be expected, I shall be glad to receive them detached,\r\npacked in a box and sent to Richmond, to the care of Dr. Currie. Every\r\nthing of this kind is precious here. And to prevent my adding to your\r\ntrouble, I must close my letter with assurances of the esteem and\r\nattachment, with which I am, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIV.--TO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY, January 26, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nParis, January 26, 1786.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nI have been duly honored by the receipt of your letter of December the\r\n6th, and am to thank you for the communications it contained on\r\nthe state of our funds and expectations here. Your idea, that these\r\ncommunications, occasionally, may be useful to the United States, is\r\ncertainly just, as I am frequently obliged to explain our prospects of\r\npaying interest, &c. which I should better do with fuller information.\r\nIf you would be so good as to instruct Mr. Grand, always to furnish me\r\nwith a duplicate of those cash accounts which he furnishes to you, from\r\ntime to time, and if you would be so good as to direct your secretary to\r\nsend me copies of such letters, as you transmit to Mr. Grand, advising\r\nhim of the remittances he may expect, from time to time. I should,\r\nthereby, be always informed of the sum of money on hand here, and the\r\nprobable expectations of supply. Dr. Franklin, during his residence\r\nhere, having been authorized to borrow large sums of money, the disposal\r\nof that money seemed naturally to rest with him. It was Mr. Grand’s\r\npractice, therefore, never to pay money, but on his warrant. On his\r\ndeparture, Mr. Grand sent all money drafts to me, to authorize their\r\npayment. I informed him, that this was in nowise within my province;\r\nthat I was unqualified to direct him in it, and that were I to presume\r\nto meddle, it would be no additional sanction to him. He refused,\r\nhowever, to pay a shilling without my order. I have been obliged,\r\ntherefore, to a nugatory interference, merely to prevent the affairs of\r\nthe United States from standing still. I need not represent to you the\r\nimpropriety of my continuing to direct Mr. Grand, longer than till\r\nwe can receive your orders, the mischief which might ensue from the\r\nuncertainty in which this would place you, as to the extent to which you\r\nmight venture to draw on your funds here, and the little necessity\r\nthere is for my interference. Whenever you order a sum of money into Mr.\r\nGrand’s hands, nothing will be more natural than your instructing him\r\nhow to apply it, so as that he shall observe your instructions alone.\r\nAmong these, you would doubtless judge it necessary to give him one\r\nstanding instruction, to answer my drafts for such sums, as my office\r\nauthorizes me to call for. These would be salary, couriers, postage,\r\nand such other articles as circumstances will require, which cannot be\r\npreviously defined. These will never be so considerable as to endanger\r\nthe honor of your drafts. I shall certainly exercise in them the\r\ngreatest caution, and stand responsible to Congress.\r\n\r\nMr. Grand conceives that he has suffered in your opinion, by an\r\napplication of two hundred thousand livres, during the last year,\r\ndifferently from what the office of finance had instructed him. This was\r\na consequence of his being thought subject to direction here, and it is\r\nbut justice to relieve him from blame on that account, and to show that\r\nit ought to fall, if any where, on Dr. Franklin, Mr. Adams, and myself.\r\nThe case was thus. The monies here were exhausted, Mr. Grand was in\r\nadvance about fifty thousand livres, and the diplomatic establishments\r\nin France, Spain, and Holland, subsisting on his bounties, which they\r\nwere subject to see stopped every moment, and feared a protest on every\r\nbill. Other current expenses, too, were depending on advances from him,\r\nand though these were small in their amount, they sometimes involved\r\ngreat consequences. In this situation, he received four hundred thousand\r\nlivres, to be paid to this government for one year’s interest. We\r\nthought the honor of the United States would suffer less by suspending\r\nhalf the payment to this government, replacing Mr. Grand’s advances, and\r\nproviding a fund for current expenses. We advised him so to do. I still\r\nthink it was for the best, and I believe my colleagues have continued\r\nto see the matter in the same point of view. We may have been biassed by\r\nfeelings excited by our own distressing situation. But certainly, as to\r\nMr. Grand, no blame belongs to him. We explained this matter in a letter\r\nto Congress, at the time, and justice requires this explanation to you,\r\nas I conjecture that the former one has not come to your knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe two hundred thousand livres retained, as before mentioned, have been\r\napplied to the purposes described, to the payment of a year’s interest\r\nto the French officers (which is about forty-two thousand livres), and\r\nother current expenses, which, doubtless, Mr. Grand has explained to\r\nyou. About a week ago, there remained in his hands but about twelve\r\nthousand livres. In this situation, the demands of the French officers\r\nfor a second year’s interest were presented. But Mr. Grand observed\r\nthere were neither money nor orders for them. The payment of these\r\ngentlemen, the last year, had the happiest effect imaginable; it\r\nprocured so many advocates for the credit and honor of the United\r\nStates, who were heard, in all companies. It corrected the idea that we\r\nwere unwilling to pay our debts. I fear that our present failure towards\r\nthem will give new birth to new imputations, and a relapse of credit.\r\nUnder this fear I have written to Mr. Adams, to know whether he can have\r\nthis money supplied from the funds in Holland; though I have little hope\r\nfrom that quarter, because he had before informed me, that those funds\r\nwould be exhausted by the spring of the present year, and I doubt, too,\r\nwhether he would venture to order these payments, without authority from\r\nyou. I have thought it my duty to state these matters to you.\r\n\r\nI have had the honor of enclosing to Mr. Jay, Commodore Jones’s receipts\r\nfor one hundred and eighty-one thousand and thirty-nine livres, one sol\r\nand ten deniers, prize-money, which (after deducting his own proportion)\r\nhe is to remit to you, for the officers and soldiers who were under his\r\ncommand. I take the liberty of suggesting, whether the expense and risk\r\nof double remittances might not be saved, by ordering it into the hands\r\nof Mr. Grand immediately, for the purposes of the treasury in Europe,\r\nwhile you could make provision at home for the officers and soldiers,\r\nwhose demands will come in so slowly, as to leave you the use of a great\r\nproportion of this money for a considerable time, and some of it for\r\never. We could then, immediately, quiet the French officers.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and esteem,\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLV.--TO MESSRS. BUCHANAN AND HAY, January 26, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. BUCHANAN AND HAY.\r\n\r\nParis, January 26, 1786.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nI had the honor of writing to you on the receipt of your orders to\r\nprocure draughts for the public buildings, and again on the 13th of\r\nAugust. In the execution of these orders, two methods of proceeding\r\npresented themselves to my mind. The one was, to leave to some architect\r\nto draw an external according to his fancy, in which way, experience\r\nshows, that about once in a thousand times a pleasing form is hit upon;\r\nthe other was, to take some model already devised, and approved by the\r\ngeneral suffrage of the world. I had no hesitation in deciding that the\r\nlatter was best, nor after the decision, was there any doubt what model\r\nto take, There is at Nismes, in the south of France, a building, called\r\nthe _Maison Quarrée_, erected in the time of the Cæsars, and which is\r\nallowed, without contradiction, to be the most perfect and precious\r\nremain of antiquity in existence. Its superiority over any thing at\r\nRome, in Greece, at Balbec, or Palmyra, is allowed on all hands; and\r\nthis single object has placed Nismes in the general tour of travellers.\r\nHaving not yet had leisure to visit it, I could only judge of it from\r\ndrawings, and from the relation of numbers who had been to see it.\r\nI determined, therefore, to adopt this model, and to have all its\r\nproportions justly observed. As it was impossible for a foreign artist\r\nto know what number and sizes of apartments would suit the different\r\ncorps of our government, nor how they should be connected with one\r\nanother, I undertook to form that arrangement, and this being done, I\r\ncommitted them to an architect (Monsieur Clerissauk), who had studied\r\nthis art twenty years in Rome, who had particularly studied and measured\r\nthe _Maison Quarrée_ of Nismes, and had published a book containing most\r\nexcellent plans, descriptions, and observations on it. He was too well\r\nacquainted with the merit of that building, to find himself restrained\r\nby my injunctions not to depart from his model. In one instance, only,\r\nhe persuaded me to admit of this. That was, to make the portico two\r\ncolumns deep only, instead of three, as the original is. His reason was,\r\nthat this latter depth would too much darken the apartments. Economy\r\nmight be added, as a second reason. I consented to it, to satisfy\r\nhim, and the plans are so drawn. I knew that it would still be easy to\r\nexecute the building with a depth of three columns, and it is what I\r\nwould certainly recommend. We know that the Maison Quarrée has pleased,\r\nuniversally, for near two thousand years. By leaving out a column, the\r\nproportions will be changed, and perhaps the effect may be injured more\r\nthan is expected. What is good, is often spoiled by trying to make it\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe present is the first opportunity which has occurred of sending the\r\nplans. You will, accordingly, receive herewith the ground plan, the\r\nelevation of the front, and the elevation of the side. The architect\r\nhaving been much busied, and knowing that this was all which would be\r\nnecessary in the beginning, has not yet finished the sections of the\r\nbuilding. They must go by some future occasion, as well as the models\r\nof the front and side, which are making in plaster of Paris. These were\r\nabsolutely necessary for the guide of workmen, not very expert in their\r\nart. It will add considerably to the expense, and I would not have\r\nincurred it, but that I was sensible of its necessity. The price of the\r\nmodel will be fifteen guineas. 1 shall know, in a few days, the cost of\r\nthe drawings, which probably will be the triple of the model: however,\r\nthis is but conjecture. I will make it as small as possible, pay it, and\r\nrender you an account in my next letter. You will find, on examination,\r\nthat the body of this building covers an area but two fifths of that\r\nwhich is proposed and begun; of course, it will take but about one\r\nhalf the bricks; and, of course, this circumstance will enlist all the\r\nworkmen, and people of the art, against the plan. Again, the building\r\nbegun is to have four porticoes; this but one. It is true that this\r\nwill be deeper than those were probably proposed, but even if it be made\r\nthree columns deep, it will not take half the number of columns. The\r\nbeauty of this is insured by experience, and by the suffrage of the\r\nwhole world: the beauty of that is problematical, as is every drawing,\r\nhowever well it looks on paper, till it be actually executed: and though\r\nI suppose there is more room in the plan begun, than in that now sent,\r\nyet there is enough in this for all the three branches of government,\r\nand more than enough is not wanted. This contains sixteen rooms; to wit,\r\nfour on the first floor, for the General Court, Delegates, lobby, and\r\nconference. Eight on the second floor, for the Executive, the Senate,\r\nand six rooms for committees and juries: and over four of these smaller\r\nrooms of the second floor, are four mezzininos or entresols, serving as\r\noffices for the clerks of the Executive, the Senate, the Delegates, and\r\nthe Court in actual session. It will be an objection, that the work\r\nis begun on the other plan. But the whole of this need not be taken to\r\npieces, and of what shall be taken to pieces, the bricks will do for\r\ninner work. Mortar never becomes so hard and adhesive to the bricks, in\r\na few months, but that it may be easily chipped off. And upon the whole,\r\nthe plan now sent will save a great proportion of the expense.\r\n\r\nHitherto, I have spoken of the capital only. The plans for the prison,\r\nalso, accompany this. They will explain themselves. I send, also,\r\nthe plan of the prison proposed at Lyons, which was sent me by the\r\narchitect, and to which we are indebted for the fundamental idea of\r\nours. You will see, that of a great thing a very small one is made.\r\nPerhaps you may find it convenient to build, at first, only two\r\nsides, forming an L; but of this, you are the best judges. It has been\r\nsuggested to me, that fine gravel, mixed in the mortar, prevents the\r\nprisoners from cutting themselves out, as that will destroy their tools.\r\nIn my letter of August the 13th, I mentioned that I could send workmen\r\nfrom hence. As I am in hopes of receiving your orders precisely, in\r\nanswer to that letter, I shall defer actually engaging any, till I\r\nreceive them. In like manner, I shall defer having plans drawn for a\r\nGovernor’s house, &c, till further orders; only assuring you, that the\r\nreceiving and executing these orders, will always give me a very great\r\npleasure, and the more, should I find that what I have done meets your\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem,\r\nGentlemen,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVI.--TO JOHN ADAMS, February 7, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nParis, February 7, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am honored with yours of January the 19th. Mine of January the 12th,\r\nhad not, I suppose, at that time got to your hands, as the receipt of it\r\nis unacknowledged. I shall be anxious till I receive your answer to it.\r\n\r\nI was perfectly satisfied before I received your letter, that your\r\nopinion had been misunderstood or misrepresented in the case of the\r\nChevalier de Mezieres. Your letter, however, will enable me to say so\r\nwith authority. It is proper it should be known, that you had not given\r\nthe opinion imputed to you, though, as to the main question, it is\r\nbecome useless; Monsieur de Reyneval having assured me, that what I had\r\nwritten on that subject had perfectly satisfied the Count de Vergennes\r\nand himself, that this case could never come under the treaty. To\r\nevince, still further, the impropriety of taking up subjects gravely,\r\non such imperfect information as this court had, I have this moment\r\nreceived a copy of an act of the Georgia Assembly, placing the subjects\r\nof France, as to real estates, on the footing of natural citizens, and\r\nexpressly recognising the treaty. Would you think any thing could be\r\nadded, after this, to put this question still further out of doors? A\r\ngentleman of Georgia assured me, General Oglethorpe did not own a foot\r\nof land in the State. I do not know whether there has been any American\r\ndetermination on the question, whether American citizens and British\r\nsubjects, born before the Revolution, can be aliens to one another.\r\nI know there is an opinion of Lord Coke’s, in Colvin’s case, that if\r\nEngland and Scotland should, in a course of descent, pass to separate\r\nKings, those born under the same sovereign during the union, would\r\nremain natural subjects and not aliens. Common sense urges some\r\nconsiderations against this. Natural subjects owe allegiance; but we owe\r\nnone. Aliens are the subjects of a foreign power; we are subjects of a\r\nforeign power. The King, by the treaty, acknowledges our independence;\r\nhow then can we remain natural subjects? The King’s power is, by the\r\nconstitution, competent to the making peace, war, and treaties. He had,\r\ntherefore, authority to relinquish our allegiance by treaty. But if an\r\nact of parliament had been necessary, the parliament passed an act to\r\nconfirm the treaty. So that it appears to me, that in this question,\r\nfictions of law alone are opposed to sound sense.\r\n\r\nI am in hopes Congress will send a minister to Lisbon. I know no\r\ncountry, with which we are likely to cultivate a more useful commerce. I\r\nhave pressed this in my private letters.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to learn any thing certain here, about the French and\r\nEnglish treaty. Yet, in general, little is expected to be done between\r\nthem. I am glad to hear that the Delegates of Virginia had made the vote\r\nrelative to English commerce, though they afterwards repealed it. I\r\nhope they will come to again. When my last letters came away, they\r\nwere engaged in passing the revisal of their laws, with some small\r\nalterations. The bearer of this, Mr. Lyons, is a sensible, worthy young\r\nphysician, son of one of our judges, and on his return to Virginia.\r\nRemember me with affection to Mrs. and Miss Adams, Colonels Smith and\r\nHumphreys, and be assured of the esteem with which I am, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVII.--TO JAMES MADISON, February 8, 1786\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nParis, February 8, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy last letters were of the 1st and 20th of September, and the 28th of\r\nOctober. Yours, unacknowledged, are of August the 20th, October the\r\n3rd, and November the 15th. I take this, the first safe opportunity, of\r\nenclosing to you the bills of lading for your books, and two others for\r\nyour namesake of Williamsburg, and for the attorney, which I will pray\r\nyou to forward. I thank you for the communication of the remonstrance\r\nagainst the assessment. Mazzei, who is now in Holland, promised me to\r\nhave it published in the Leyden gazette. It will do us great honor. I\r\nwish it may be as much approved by our Assembly, as by the wisest part\r\nof Europe. I have heard, with great pleasure, that our Assembly have\r\ncome to the resolution, of giving the regulation of their commerce to\r\nthe federal head. I will venture to assert, that there is not one of its\r\nopposers, who, placed on this ground, would not see the wisdom of this\r\nmeasure. The politics of Europe render it indispensably necessary, that,\r\nwith respect to every thing external, we be one nation only, firmly\r\nhooped together. Interior government is what each State should keep to\r\nitself. If it were seen in Europe, that all our States could be brought\r\nto concur in what the Virginia Assembly has done, it would produce a\r\ntotal revolution in their opinion of us, and respect for us. And it\r\nshould ever be held in mind, that insult and war are the consequences\r\nof a want of respectability in the national character. As long as the\r\nStates exercise, separately, those acts of power which respect foreign\r\nnations, so long will there continue to be irregularities committed\r\nby some one or other of them, which will constantly keep us on an ill\r\nfooting with foreign nations.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your information as to my Notes. The copies I have\r\nremaining shall be sent over, to be given to some of my friends and to\r\nselect subjects in the College. I have been unfortunate here with this\r\ntrifle. I gave out a few copies only, and to confidential persons,\r\nwriting in every copy a restraint against its publication. Among others,\r\nI gave a copy to a Mr. Williams: he died. I immediately took every\r\nprecaution I could to recover this copy. But, by some means or other, a\r\nbookseller had got hold of it. He employed a hireling translator, and is\r\nabout publishing it in the most injurious form possible. I am now at\r\na loss what to do as to England. Every thing, good or bad, is thought\r\nworth publishing there; and I apprehend a translation back from the\r\nFrench, and a publication there. I rather believe it will be most\r\neligible to let the original come out in that country: but am not yet\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\nI have purchased little for you in the book way since I sent the\r\ncatalogue of my former purchases. I wish, first, to have your answer to\r\nthat, and your information, what parts of these purchases went out of\r\nyour plan. You can easily say, Buy more of this kind, less of that, &c.\r\nMy wish is to conform myself to yours. I can get for you the original\r\nParis edition of the Encyclopédie, in thirty-five volumes, folio, for\r\nsix hundred and twenty livres; a good edition, in thirty-nine volumes,\r\n4to, for three hundred and eighty livres; and a good one, in thirty-nine\r\nvolumes, 8vo, for two hundred and eighty livres. The new one will be\r\nsuperior in far the greater number of articles; but not in all. And the\r\npossession of the ancient one has, moreover, the advantage of supplying\r\npresent use. I have bought one for myself, but wait your orders as to\r\nyou. I remember your purchase of a watch in Philadelphia. If it should\r\nnot have proved good, you can probably sell it. In that case, I can get\r\nfor you here, one made as perfect as human art can make it, for about\r\ntwenty-four louis. I have had such a one made, by the best and most\r\nfaithful hand in Paris. It has a second hand, but no repeating, no day\r\nof the month, nor other useless thing to impede and injure the movements\r\nwhich are necessary. For twelve louis more, you can have in the same\r\ncover, but on the back, and absolutely unconnected with the movements of\r\nthe watch, a pedometer, which shall render you an exact account of the\r\ndistances you walk. Your pleasure hereon shall be awaited.\r\n\r\nHoudon has returned. He called on me, the other day, to remonstrate\r\nagainst the inscription proposed for General Washington’s statue. He\r\nsays it is too long to be put on the pedestal. I told him, I was not at\r\nliberty to permit any alteration, but I would represent his objection to\r\na friend, who could judge of its validity, and whether a change could be\r\nauthorized. This has been the subject of conversations here, and various\r\ndevices and inscriptions have been suggested. The one which has appeared\r\nbest to me, may be translated as follows: ‘Behold, Reader, the form of\r\nGeorge Washington. For his worth, ask History; that will tell it, when\r\nthis stone shall have yielded to the decays of time. His country erects\r\nthis monument.’ Houdon makes it.’This for one side. On the second,\r\nrepresent the evacuation of Boston, with the motto, ‘Hostibus primum\r\nfugatis.’ On the third, the capture of the Hessians, with ‘Hostibus\r\niterum devictis.’ On the fourth, the surrender of York, with ‘Hostibus\r\nultimum debellatis.’ This is seizing the three most brilliant actions of\r\nhis military life. By giving out, here, a wish of receiving mottos for\r\nthis statue, we might have thousands offered, from which still better\r\nmight be chosen. The artist made the same objection, of length, to the\r\ninscription for the bust of the Marquis de la Fayette. An alteration of\r\nthat might come in time still, if an alteration was wished. However, I\r\nam not certain that it is desirable in either case. The State of Georgia\r\nhas given twenty thousand acres of land, to the Count d’Estaing. This\r\ngift is considered here as very honorable to him, and it has gratified\r\nhim much. I am persuaded, that a gift of lands by the State of Virginia\r\nto the Marquis de la Fayette, would give a good opinion here of our\r\ncharacter, and would reflect honor on the Marquis. Nor am I sure that\r\nthe day will not come, when it might be an useful asylum to him. The\r\ntime of life at which he visited America was too well adapted to receive\r\ngood and lasting impressions, to permit him ever to accommodate himself\r\nto the principles of monarchical government; and it will need all his\r\nown prudence, and that of his friends, to make this country a safe\r\nresidence for him. How glorious, how comfortable in reflection, will it\r\nbe, to have prepared a refuge for him in case of a reverse. In the\r\nmean time, he could settle it with tenants from the freest part of this\r\ncountry, Bretaigne. I have never suggested the smallest idea of this\r\nkind to him: because the execution of it should convey the first notice.\r\nIf the State has not a right to give him lands with their own officers,\r\nthey could buy up, at cheap prices, the shares of others. I am not\r\ncertain, however, whether, in the public or private opinion, a similar\r\ngift to Count Rochambeau could be dispensed with. If the State could\r\ngive to both, it would be better: but, in any event, I think they\r\nshould to the Marquis. Count Rochambeau, too, has really deserved more\r\nattention than he has received. Why not set up his bust, that of Gates,\r\nGreene, Franklin, in your new capitol? _A propos_ of the capital. Do, my\r\ndear friend, exert yourself to get the plan begun on set aside, and that\r\nadopted, which was drawn here. It was taken from a model which has been\r\nthe admiration of sixteen centuries; which has been the object of as\r\nmany pilgrimages as the tomb of Mahomet; which will give unrivalled\r\nhonor to our State, and furnish a model whereon to form the taste of our\r\nyoung men. It will cost much less too, than the one begun; because it\r\ndoes not cover one half of the area. Ask, if you please, a sight of\r\nmy letter of January the 26th, to Messrs. Buchanan and Hay, which will\r\nspare me the repeating its substance here.\r\n\r\nEvery thing is quiet in Europe. I recollect but one new invention in the\r\narts which is worth mentioning. It is a mixture of the arts of engraving\r\nand printing, rendering both cheaper. Write or draw any thing on a plate\r\nof brass, with the ink of the inventor, and, in half an hour, he gives\r\nyou engraved copies of it, so perfectly like the original, that they\r\ncould not be suspected to be copies. His types for printing a whole\r\npage, are all in one solid piece. An author, therefore, only prints a\r\nfew copies of his work, from time to time, as they are called for. This\r\nsaves the loss of printing more copies than may possibly be sold, and\r\nprevents an edition from being ever exhausted.\r\n\r\nI am, with a lively esteem, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour sincere friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVIII.--TO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE, February 9, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nParis, February 9, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe Mr. John Ledyard, who proposes to undertake the journey through the\r\nnorthern parts of Asia and America, is a citizen of Connecticut, one of\r\nthe United States of America. He accompanied Captain Cook in his last\r\nvoyage to the northwestern parts of America, and rendered himself useful\r\nto that officer, on some occasions, by a spirit of enterprise which has\r\ndistinguished his whole life. He has genius, and education better than\r\nthe common, and a talent for useful and interesting observation. I\r\nbelieve him to be an honest man, and a man of truth. To all this, he\r\nadds just as much singularity of character, and of that particular kind\r\ntoo, as was necessary to make him undertake the journey he proposes.\r\nShould he get safe through it, I think he will give an interesting\r\naccount of what he shall have seen.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of sincere esteem and respect,\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIX.--TO MONSIEUR HILLIARD d’AUBERTEUIL, Feb. 20, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR HILLIARD d’AUBERTEUIL.\r\n\r\nParis, February 20, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have been honored with your letter, and the books which accompanied\r\nit, for which I return you my hearty thanks. America cannot but be\r\nflattered with the choice of the subject, on which you are at present\r\nemploying your pen. The memory of the American Revolution will be\r\nimmortal, and will immortalize those who record it. The reward is\r\nencouraging, and will justify all those pains, which a rigorous\r\ninvestigation of facts will render necessary. Many important facts,\r\nwhich preceded the commencement of hostilities, took place in England.\r\nThese may mostly be obtained from good publications in that country.\r\nSome took place in this country. They will be probably hidden from\r\nthe present age. But America is the field where the greatest mass of\r\nimportant events were transacted, and where, alone, they can now be\r\ncollected. I therefore much applaud your idea of going to that country,\r\nfor the verification of the facts you mean to record. Every man there\r\ncan tell you more than any man here, who has not been there: and the\r\nvery ground itself will give you new insight into some of the most\r\ninteresting transactions. If I can be of service to you, in promoting\r\nyour object there, I offer myself freely to your use. I shall be\r\nflattered by the honor of your visit here, at any time. I am seldom from\r\nhome before noon; but if any later hour should suit you better, I will\r\ntake care to be at home, at any hour and day, you will be pleased to\r\nindicate.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLX.--TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES, February 28,1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.\r\n\r\nParis, February 28,1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nCircumstances of public duty calling me suddenly to London, I take\r\nthe liberty of mentioning it to your Excellency, and of asking a\r\nfew minutes’ audience of you, at as early a day and hour as will be\r\nconvenient to you, and that you will be so good as to indicate them to\r\nme. I would wish to leave Paris about Friday or Saturday, and suppose\r\nthat my stay in London will be of about three weeks. I shall be happy to\r\nbe the bearer of any commands your Excellency may have for that place,\r\nand will faithfully execute them. I cannot omit mentioning, how pleasing\r\nit would be to me to be enabled, before my departure, to convey to the\r\nAmerican prisoners at St. Pol de Léon such mitigation of their fate, as\r\nmay be thought admissible.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect and\r\nesteem, your Excellency’s\r\n\r\nmost obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXI.--TO MONSIEUR DE REYNEVAL, March 8, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE REYNEVAL.\r\n\r\nParis, March 8, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nHis Excellency, Count de Vergennes, having been pleased to say that he\r\nwould give orders at Calais, for the admission of certain articles which\r\nI wish to bring with me from England, I have thought it best to give a\r\ndescription of them, before my departure. They will be as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A set of table furniture, consisting of China, silver, and plated\r\nware, distributed into three or four boxes or canteens, for the\r\nconvenience of removing them.\r\n\r\n2. A box containing small tools for wooden and iron work, for my own\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n3. A box, probably, of books.\r\n\r\n4. I expect to bring with me a riding horse, saddle, &c.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical instruments will probably be so light that I may bring\r\nthem in my carriage, in which case, I presume they will pass with my\r\nbaggage, under the authority of the passport for my person. If these\r\norders can be made out in time, I would willingly be the bearer of them\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, ,\r\n\r\nyour most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXII.--TO JOHN JAY, March 12, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nLondon, March 12, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\nThe date of a letter from London will doubtless be as unexpected to you\r\nas it was unforeseen by myself, a few days ago. On the 27th of the last\r\nmonth, Colonel Smith arrived in Paris, with a letter from Mr. Adams,\r\ninforming me that there was at this place a minister from Tripoli,\r\nhaving general powers to enter into treaties on behalf of his State, and\r\nwith whom it was possible we might do something, under our commission\r\nto that power: and that he gave reason to believe, he could also make\r\narrangements with us, for Tunis. He further added, that the minister\r\nof Portugal here had received ultimate instructions from his court, and\r\nthat, probably, that treaty might be concluded in the space of three\r\nweeks, were we all on the spot together. He, therefore, pressed me to\r\ncome over immediately. The first of these objects had some weight on my\r\nmind, because, as we had sent no person to Tripoli or Tunis, I thought\r\nif we could meet a minister from them on this ground, our arrangements\r\nwould be settled much sooner, and at less expense. But what principally\r\ndecided me, was, the desire of bringing matters to a conclusion with\r\nPortugal, before the term of our commissions should expire, or any\r\nnew turn in the negotiations of France and England should abate their\r\nwillingness to fix a connection with us. A third motive had also its\r\nweight. I hoped that my attendance here, and the necessity of shortening\r\nit, might be made use of to force a decisive answer from this court.\r\nI therefore concluded to comply with Mr. Adams’s request. I went\r\nimmediately to Versailles, and apprized the Count de Vergennes, that\r\ncircumstances of public duty called me hither for three or four weeks,\r\narranged with him some matters, and set out with Colonel Smith for this\r\nplace, where we arrived last night, which was as early as the excessive\r\nrigor of the weather admitted. I saw Mr. Adams immediately, and again\r\nto-day. He informs me, that the minister of Portugal was taken ill five\r\nor six days ago, has been very much so, but is now somewhat better.\r\nIt would be very mortifying, indeed, should this accident, with the\r\nshortness of the term to which I limit my stay here, defeat what was the\r\nprincipal object of my journey, and that, without which, I should hardly\r\nhave undertaken it. With respect to this country, I had no doubt but\r\nthat every consideration had been urged by Mr. Adams, which was proper\r\nto be urged. Nothing remains undone in this way. But we shall avail\r\nourselves of my journey here, as if made on purpose, just before the\r\nexpiration of our commission, to form our report to Congress on the\r\nexecution of that commission, which report, they may be given to\r\nknow, cannot be formed without decisive information of the ultimate\r\ndetermination of their court. There is no doubt what that determination\r\nwill be: but it will be useful to have it; as it may put an end to all\r\nfurther expectations on our side the water, and show that the time\r\nis come for doing whatever is to be done by us, for counteracting the\r\nunjust and greedy designs of this country. We shall have the honor,\r\nbefore I leave this place, to inform you of the result of the several\r\nmatters which have brought me to it.\r\n\r\nA day or two before my departure from Paris, I received your letter of\r\nJanuary------. The question therein proposed, How far France considers\r\nherself as bound to insist on the delivery of the posts, would\r\ninfallibly produce another, How far we consider ourselves as guarantees\r\nof their American possessions, and bound to enter into any future war,\r\nin which these may be attacked? The words of the treaty of alliance\r\nseem to be without ambiguity on either head, yet, I should be afraid to\r\ncommit Congress, by answering without authority. I will endeavor, on\r\nmy return, to sound the opinion of the minister, if possible, without\r\nexposing myself to the other question. Should any thing forcible\r\nbe meditated on these posts, it would possibly be thought prudent,\r\npreviously to ask the good offices of France, to obtain their delivery.\r\nIn this case, they would probably say, we must first execute the treaty,\r\non our part, by repealing all acts which have contravened it. Now this\r\nmeasure, if there be any candor in the court of London, would suffice to\r\nobtain a delivery of the posts from them, without the mediation of any\r\nthird power. However, if this mediation should be finally needed, I\r\nsee no reason to doubt our obtaining it, and still less to question its\r\nomnipotent influence on the British court.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest respect and esteem, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXIII.--TO COLONEL HUMPHREYS, March 14, 1786\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\nLondon, March 14, 1786.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have been honoured with your letter, in which you mention to me\r\nyour intention of returning to America in the April packet. It is with\r\nsincere concern that I meet this event, as it deprives me not only of\r\nyour aid in the office in which we have been joined, but also of your\r\nsociety, which has been to me a source of the greatest satisfaction.\r\nI think myself bound to return you my thanks for it, and, at the\r\nsame time, to bear testimony, that in the discharge of the office of\r\nSecretary of Legation to the several commissions, you have fulfilled all\r\nits duties with readiness, propriety, and fidelity. I sincerely wish,\r\nthat on your return, our country may avail itself of your talents in the\r\npublic service, and that you may be willing so to employ them. You\r\ncarry with you my wishes for your prosperity, and a desire of being\r\ninstrumental to it: and I hope, that in every situation in which we may\r\nbe placed, you will freely command and count on my services. I will beg\r\nto be favored with your letters, whenever it is convenient. You have\r\nseen our want of intelligence here, and well know the nature of\r\nthat which will be useful or agreeable. I fear I shall have little\r\ninteresting to give you in return; but such news as my situation\r\naffords, you shall be sure to receive. I pray you to be the bearer of\r\nthe enclosed letter to Mr. Jay, to accept my wishes for a favorable\r\npassage, a happy meeting with your friends, and for every future\r\nfelicity which this life can afford, being with the greatest esteem,\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour sincere friend\r\n\r\nand most humble servant,\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE A.]--TO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nKaskaskias, Illinois, April 29,1779.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nA few days ago, I received certain intelligence of William Morris,\r\nmy express to you, being killed near the falls of Ohio, news truly\r\ndisagreeable to me, as I fear many of my letters will fall into the\r\nhands of the enemy, at Detroit, although some of them, as I learn, were\r\nfound in the woods torn in pieces. I do not doubt but before the\r\nreceipt of this, you will have heard of my late success against Governor\r\nHamilton, at post St. Vincenne. That gentleman, with a body of men,\r\npossessed himself of that post on the 15th of December last, repaired\r\nthe fortifications for a repository, and in the spring, meant to attack\r\nthis place, which he made no doubt of carrying; where he was to be\r\njoined by two hundred Indians from Michilimackinac, and five hundred\r\nCherokees, Chickasaws, and other nations. With this body, he was to\r\npenetrate up the Ohio to Fort Pitt, sweeping Kentucky on his way, having\r\nlight brass cannon for the purpose, joined on his march by all the\r\nIndians that could be got to him. He made no doubt, that he could force\r\nall West Augusta. This expedition was ordered by the commander in chief\r\nof Canada. Destruction seemed to hover over us from every quarter;\r\ndetached parties of the enemy were in the neighborhood every day, but\r\nafraid to attack. I ordered Major Bowman to evacuate the fort at the\r\nCohas, and join me immediately, which he did. Having not received a\r\nscrape of a pen from you, for near twelve months, I could see but little\r\nprobability of keeping possession of the country, as my number of men\r\nwas too small to stand a siege, and my situation too remote to call for\r\nassistance. I made all the preparations I possibly could for the attack,\r\nand was necessitated to set fire to some of the houses in town, to clear\r\nthem out of the way. But in the height of the hurry, a Spanish\r\nmerchant, who had been at St. Vincenne, arrived, and gave the following\r\nintelligence: that Mr. Hamilton had weakened himself, by sending his\r\nIndians against the frontiers, and to block up the Ohio; that he had\r\nnot more than eighty men in garrison, three pieces of cannon, and some\r\nswivels mounted; and that he intended to attack this place, as soon as\r\nthe winter opened, and made no doubt of clearing the western waters\r\nby the fall. My situation and circumstances induced me to fall on the\r\nresolution of attacking him, before he could collect his Indians again.\r\nI was sensible the resolution was as desperate as my situation, but\r\nI saw no other probability of securing the country. I immediately\r\ndespatched a small galley, which I had fitted up, mounting two\r\nfour-pounders and four swivels, with a company of men and necessary\r\nstores on board, with orders to force her way, if possible, and station\r\nherself a few miles below the enemy, suffer nothing to pass her, and\r\nwait for further orders. In the mean time, I marched across the country\r\nwith one hundred and thirty men, being all I could raise, after leaving\r\nthis place garrisoned by the militia. The inhabitants of the country\r\nbehaved exceedingly well, numbers of young men turned out on the\r\nexpedition, and every other one embodied to guard the different towns.\r\nI marched the 7th of February. Although so small a body, it took me\r\nsixteen days on the route. The inclemency of the season, high waters,\r\n&c. seemed to threaten the loss of the expedition. When within three\r\nleagues of the enemy, in a direct line, it took us five days to cross\r\nthe drowned lands of the Wabash river, having to wade often upwards of\r\ntwo leagues, to our breast in water. Had not the weather been warm, we\r\nmust have perished. But on the evening of the 23rd, we got on dry land,\r\nin sight of the enemy; and at seven o’clock, made the attack, before\r\nthey knew any thing of us. The town immediately surrendered with joy,\r\nand assisted in the siege. There was a continual fire on both sides,\r\nfor eighteen hours. I had no expectation of gaining the fort until the\r\narrival of my artillery. The moon setting about one o’clock, I had an\r\nentrenchment thrown up within rifle-shot of their strongest battery,\r\nand poured such showers of well directed balls into their ports, that we\r\nsilenced two pieces of cannon in fifteen minutes, without getting a man\r\nhurt.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hamilton and myself had, on the following day, several\r\nconferences, but did not agree until the evening, when he agreed to\r\nsurrender the garrison (seventy-nine in number) prisoners of war, with\r\nconsiderable stores. I got only one man wounded; not being able to lose\r\nmany, I made them secure themselves well. Seven were badly wounded in\r\nthe fort, through ports. In the height of this action, an Indian party\r\nthat had been to war, and taken two prisoners, came in, not knowing of\r\nus. Hearing of them, I despatched a party to give them battle in the\r\ncommons, and got nine of them, with the two prisoners, who proved to be\r\nFrenchmen. Hearing of a convoy of goods from Detroit, I sent a party\r\nof sixty men, in armed boats well mounted with swivels, to meet them,\r\nbefore they could receive any intelligence. They met the convoy forty\r\nleagues up the river, and made a prize of the whole, taking forty\r\nprisoners, and about ten thousand pounds’ worth of goods and provisions;\r\nalso the mail from Canada to Governor Hamilton, containing, however, no\r\nnews of importance. But what crowned the general joy, was the arrival of\r\nWilliam Morris, my express to you, with your letters, which gave general\r\nsatisfaction. The soldiery, being made sensible of the gratitude of\r\ntheir country for their services, were so much elated, that they would\r\nhave attempted the reduction of Detroit, had I ordered them. Having\r\nmore prisoners than I knew what to do with, I was obliged to discharge\r\na greater part of them on parole. Mr. Hamilton, his principal officers,\r\nand a few soldiers, I have sent to Kentucky, under convoy of Captain\r\nWilliams, in order to be conducted to you. After despatching Morris with\r\nletters to you, treating with the neighboring Indians, &c, I returned to\r\nthis place, leaving a sufficient garrison at St. Vincenne.\r\n\r\nDuring my absence, Captain Robert George, who now commands the company\r\nformerly commanded by Captain Willing, had returned from New Orleans,\r\nwhich greatly added to our strength. It gave great satisfaction to the\r\ninhabitants, when acquainted with the protection which was given them,\r\nthe alliance with France, &c. I am impatient for the arrival of Colonel\r\nMontgomery, but have heard nothing of him lately. By your instructions\r\nto me, I find you put no confidence in General M’Intosh’s taking\r\nDetroit, as you encourage me to attempt it, if possible. It has been\r\ntwice in my power. Had I been able to raise only five hundred men when\r\nI first arrived in the country, or when I was at St. Vincenne, could I\r\nhave secured my prisoners, and only have had three hundred good men, I\r\nshould have attempted it, and since learn there could have been no doubt\r\nof success, as by some gentlemen, lately from that post, we are informed\r\nthat the town and country kept three days in feasting and diversions on\r\nhearing of my success against Mr. Hamilton, and were so certain of my\r\nembracing the fair opportunity of possessing myself of that post,\r\nthat the merchants and others provided many necessaries for us on our\r\narrival; the garrison, consisting of only eighty men, not daring to stop\r\ntheir diversions. They are now completing a new fort, and I fear too\r\nstrong for any force I shall ever be able to raise in this country.\r\nWe are proud to hear Congress intends putting their forces on the\r\nfrontiers, under your direction. A small army from Pittsburg, conducted\r\nwith spirit, may easily take Detroit, and put an end to the Indian war.\r\nThose Indians who are active against us, are the Six Nations, part of\r\nthe Shawnese, the Meamonies, and about half the Chesaweys, Ottawas,\r\nJowaas, and Pottawatimas nations, bordering on the lakes. Those nations,\r\nwho have treated with me, have behaved since very well, to wit, the\r\nPeankishaws, Kiccapoos, Orcaottenans of the Wabash river, the Kaskias,\r\nPerrians, Mechigamies, Foxes, Sacks, Opays, Illinois, and Poues, nations\r\nof the Mississippi and Illinois rivers. Part of the Chesaweys have also\r\ntreated, and are peaceable. I continually keep agents among them,\r\nto watch their motions and keep them peaceably inclined. Many of\r\nthe Cherokees, Chickasaws, and their confederates, are, I fear, ill\r\ndisposed. It would be well if Colonel Montgomery should give them a\r\ndressing, as he comes down the Tennessee. There can be no peace expected\r\nfrom many nations, while the English are at Detroit. I strongly\r\nsuspect they will turn their arms against the Illinois, as they will be\r\nencouraged. I shall always be on my guard, watching every opportunity to\r\ntake the advantage of the enemy, and, if I am ever able to muster six\r\nor seven hundred men, I shall give them a shorter distance to come and\r\nfight me, than at this place.\r\n\r\nThere is one circumstance very distressing, that of our money’s being\r\ndiscredited, to all intents and purposes, by the great number of traders\r\nwho come here in my absence, each outbidding the other, giving prices\r\nunknown in this country by five hundred per cent., by which the people\r\nconceived it to be of no value, and both French and Spaniards refused\r\nto take a farthing of it. Provision is three times the price it was two\r\nmonths past, and to be got by no other means than my own bonds, goods,\r\nor force. Several merchants are now advancing considerable sums of\r\ntheir own property, rather than the service should suffer, by which I\r\nam sensible they must lose greatly, unless some method is taken to raise\r\nthe credit of our coin, or a fund be sent to Orleans, for the payment\r\nof the expenses of this place, which should at once reduce the price\r\nof every species of provision; money being of little service to them,\r\nunless it would pass at the ports they trade at. I mentioned to you, my\r\ndrawing some bills on Mr. Pollock in New Orleans, as I had no money with\r\nme. He would accept the bills, but had not money to pay them off, though\r\nthe sums were trifling; so that we have little credit to expect from\r\nthat quarter. I shall take every step I possibly can, for laying up a\r\nsufficient quantity of provisions, and hope you will immediately send me\r\nan express with your instructions. Public expenses in this country have\r\nhitherto been very low, and may still continue so, if a correspondence\r\nis fixed at New Orleans for payment of expenses in this country, or\r\ngold and silver sent. I am glad to hear of Colonel Todd’s appointment.\r\nI think government has taken the only step they could have done, to make\r\nthis country flourish, and be of service to them. No other regulation\r\nwould have suited the people. The last account I had of Colonel Rogers,\r\nwas his being in New Orleans, with six of his men. The rest he left at\r\nthe Spanish Ozack, above the Natches. I shall immediately send him some\r\nprovisions, as I learn he is in great want. I doubt he will not be able\r\nto get his goods up the river except in Spanish bottoms. One regiment\r\nwould be able to clear the Mississippi, and to do great damage to the\r\nBritish interest in Florida, and by properly conducting themselves might\r\nperhaps gain the affection of the people, so as to raise a sufficient\r\nforce to give a shock to Pensacola. Our alliance with France has\r\nentirely devoted this people to our interest. I have sent several copies\r\nof the articles to Detroit, and do not doubt but they will produce the\r\ndesired effect. Your instructions, I shall pay implicit regard to, and\r\nhope to conduct myself in such a manner as to do honor to my country.\r\n\r\nI am, with the greatest respect,\r\n\r\nyour humble servant,\r\n\r\nG. R. Clarke.\r\n\r\nP. S. I understand there is a considerable quantity of cannon ball at\r\nPittsburg. We are much in want of four and six pound ball. I hope you\r\nwill immediately order some down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN COUNCIL, June 18, 1779\r\n\r\n\r\nThe board proceeded to the consideration of the letters of Colonel\r\nClarke, and other papers relating to Henry Hamilton, Esq. who has acted\r\nfor some years past as Lieutenant Governor of the settlement at and\r\nabout Detroit, and commandant of the British garrison there, under Sir\r\nGuy Carleton, as Governor in chief; Philip Dejean, justice of the peace\r\nfor Detroit, and William Lamothe, captain of volunteers, prisoners of\r\nwar, taken in the county of Illinois.\r\n\r\nThey find, that Governor Hamilton has executed the task of inciting the\r\nIndians to perpetrate their accustomed cruelties on the citizens of the\r\nUnited States, without distinction of age, sex, or condition, with\r\nan eagerness and avidity which evince, that the general nature of his\r\ncharge harmonized with his particular disposition. They should have been\r\nsatisfied, from the other testimony adduced, that these enormities were\r\ncommitted by savages acting under his commission, but the number of\r\nproclamations, which, at different times, were left in houses, the\r\ninhabitants of which were killed or carried away by the Indians, one of\r\nwhich proclamations is in possession of the board, under the hand and\r\nseal of Governor Hamilton, puts this fact beyond a doubt. At the time\r\nof his captivity, it appears, he had sent considerable bodies of Indians\r\nagainst the frontier settlements of these States, and had actually\r\nappointed a great council of Indians, to meet him at Tennessee, to\r\nconcert the operations of this present campaign. They find that his\r\ntreatment of our citizens and soldiers, taken and carried within the\r\nlimits of his command, has been cruel and inhuman; that in the case\r\nof John Dodge, a citizen of these States, which has been particularly\r\nstated to this board, he loaded him with irons, threw him into a\r\ndungeon, without bedding, without straw, without fire, in the dead of\r\nwinter and severe climate of Detroit; that, in that state, he wasted\r\nhim with incessant expectations of death: that when the rigors of his\r\nsituation had brought him so low, that death seemed likely to withdraw\r\nhim from their power, he was taken out and somewhat attended to, until\r\na little mended, and before he had recovered ability to walk, was again\r\nreturned to his dungeon, in which a hole was cut, seven inches square\r\nonly for the admission of air, and the same load of irons again put on\r\nhim: that appearing, a second time, in imminent danger of being lost\r\nto them, he was again taken from his dungeon, in which he had lain from\r\nJanuary till June, with the intermission of a few weeks only, before\r\nmentioned. That Governor Hamilton gave standing rewards for scalps,\r\nbut offered none for prisoners, which induced the Indians, after making\r\ntheir captives carry their baggage into the neighborhood of the fort,\r\nthere to put them to death, and carry in their scalps to the Governor,\r\nwho welcomed their return and success by a discharge of cannon. That\r\nwhen a prisoner, brought alive, and destined to death by the Indians,\r\nthe fire already kindled, and himself bound to the stake, was\r\ndexterously withdrawn, and secreted from them by the humanity of a\r\nfellow prisoner, a large reward was offered for the discovery of the\r\nvictim, which having tempted a servant to betray his concealment, the\r\npresent prisoner Dejean, being sent with a party of soldiers, surrounded\r\nthe house, took and threw into jail the unhappy victim and his\r\ndeliverer, where the former soon expired under the perpetual assurances\r\nof Dejean, that he was to be again restored into the hands of the\r\nsavages, and the latter when enlarged, was bitterly reprimanded by\r\nGovernor Hamilton.\r\n\r\nIt appears to them, that the prisoner Dejean was, on all occasions,\r\nthe willing and cordial instrument of Governor Hamilton, acting both\r\nas judge and keeper of the jails, and instigating and urging him, by\r\nmalicious insinuations and untruths, to increase, rather than relax\r\nhis severities, heightening the cruelty of his orders by his manner of\r\nexecuting them, offering at one time a reward to one man to be hangman\r\nfor another, threatening his life on refusal, and taking from his\r\nprisoners the little property their opportunities enabled them to\r\nacquire.\r\n\r\nIt appears, that the prisoner Lamothe, was a captain of the volunteer\r\nscalping parties of Indians and whites, who went, from time to time,\r\nunder general orders to spare neither men, women, nor children. From\r\nthis detail of circumstances, which arose in a few cases only, coming\r\naccidentally to the knowledge of the board, they think themselves\r\nauthorized by fair deduction, to presume what would be the horrid\r\nhistory of the sufferings of the many, who have expired under their\r\nmiseries (which, therefore, will remain for ever untold), or who have\r\nescaped from them, and are yet too remote and too much dispersed, to\r\nbring together their well founded accusations against the prisoners.\r\n\r\nThey have seen that the conduct of the British officers, civil and\r\nmilitary, has in the whole course of this war, been savage, and\r\nunprecedented among civilized nations; that our officers taken by\r\nthem, have been confined in crowded jails, loathsome dungeons, and\r\nprison-ships, loaded with irons, supplied often with no food, generally\r\nwith too little for the sustenance of nature, and that little sometimes\r\nunsound and unwholesome, whereby such numbers have perished, that\r\ncaptivity and death have with them been almost synonymous; that they\r\nhave been transported beyond seas, where their fate is out of the reach\r\nof our inquiry, have been compelled to take arms against their country,\r\nand, by a refinement in cruelty, to become murderers of their own\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\nTheir prisoners with us have, on the other hand, been treated with\r\nhumanity and moderation; they have been fed, on all occasions, with\r\nwholesome and plentiful food, suffered to go at large within extensive\r\ntracts of country, treated with liberal hospitality, permitted to live\r\nin the families of our citizens, to labor for themselves, to acquire and\r\nenjoy profits, and finally to participate of the principal benefits of\r\nsociety, privileged from all burdens.\r\n\r\nReviewing this contrast, which cannot be denied by our enemies\r\nthemselves, in a single point, and which has now been kept up\r\nduring four years of unremitting war, a term long enough to produce\r\nwell-founded despair that our moderation may ever lead them to the\r\npractice of humanity; called on by that justice we owe to those who are\r\nfighting the battles of our country, to deal out, at length, miseries\r\nto their enemies, measure for measure, and to distress the feelings of\r\nmankind by exhibiting to them spectacles of severe retaliation, where\r\nwe had long and vainly endeavored to introduce an emulation in kindness;\r\nhappily possessed, by the fortune of war, of some of those very\r\nindividuals who, having distinguished themselves personally in this\r\nline of cruel conduct, are fit subjects to begin on, with the work of\r\nretaliation; this board has resolved to advise the Governor, that the\r\nsaid Henry Hamilton, Philip Dejean and William Lamothe, prisoners of\r\nwar, be put into irons, confined in the dungeon of the public jail,\r\ndebarred the use of pen, ink, and paper, and excluded all converse,\r\nexcept with their keeper. And the Governor orders accordingly.\r\n\r\nArch. Blair, C. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE B]--IN COUNCIL, September 29, 1779.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe board having been, at no time, unmindful of the circumstances\r\nattending the confinement of Lieutenant Governor Hamilton, Captain\r\nLamothe, and Philip Dejean, which the personal cruelties of those men,\r\nas well as the general conduct of the enemy, had constrained them to\r\nadvise: wishing, and willing to expect, that their sufferings may lead\r\nthem to the practice of humanity, should any future turn of fortune,\r\nin their favor, submit to their discretion the fate of their fellow\r\ncreatures; that it may prove an admonition to others, meditating like\r\ncruelties, not to rely for impunity in any circumstances of distance or\r\npresent security; and that it may induce the enemy to reflect, what must\r\nbe the painful consequences, should a continuation of the same conduct\r\non their part impel us again to severities, while such multiplied\r\nsubjects of retaliation are within our power: sensible that no\r\nimpression can be made on the event of the war, by wreaking vengeance\r\non miserable captives; that the great cause which has animated the two\r\nnations against each other, is not to be decided by unmanly cruelties on\r\nwretches, who have bowed their necks to the power of the victor, but by\r\nthe exercise of honorable valor in the field: earnestly hoping that the\r\nenemy, viewing the subject in the same light, will be content to abide\r\nthe event of that mode of decision, and spare us the pain of a second\r\ndeparture from kindness to our captives: confident that commiseration\r\nto our prisoners is the only possible motive, to which can be candidly\r\nascribed, in the present actual circumstances of the war, the advice\r\nwe are now about to give; the board does advise the Governor to send\r\nLieutenant Governor Hamilton, Captain Lamothe, and Philip Dejean, to\r\nHanover court house, there to remain at large, within certain reasonable\r\nlimits, taking their parole in the usual manner. The Governor orders\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nArch. Blair, C. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdered, that Major John Hay be sent, also, under parole to the same\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nArch. Blair, C. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE C]--IN COUNCIL, October 8, 1779.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Governor is advised to take proper and effectual measures for\r\nknowing, from time to time, the situation and treatment of our prisoners\r\nby the enemy, and to extend to theirs, with us a like treatment,\r\nin every circumstance; and, also, to order to a proper station, the\r\nprison-ship fitted up on recommendation from Congress from the reception\r\nand confinement of such prisoners of war, as shall be sent to it.\r\n\r\nArch.

One thousand were killed and\r\nwounded, about eight hundred taken prisoners. We are in possession\r\nof eight pieces of brass cannon, all they had in the field, all their\r\nammunition wagons, a great number of arms, and one hundred and thirty\r\nbaggage wagons: in short, there never was a more complete victory. I\r\nhave written to Lieutenant Colonel Turnbull, whom I sent to join\r\nMajor Johnson on Little river, to push on after General Sumpter to the\r\nWax-haws, whose detachment is the only collected force of rebels in all\r\nthis country. Colonel Tarleton is in pursuit of Sumpter. Our loss is\r\nabout three hundred killed and wounded, chiefly of the thirty-third\r\nregiment and volunteers, of Ireland. I have given orders that all the\r\ninhabitants of this province, who have subscribed and taken part in this\r\nrevolt, should be punished with the greatest rigor; also, that those\r\nwho will not turn out, may be imprisoned, and their whole property taken\r\nfrom them, and destroyed. I have also ordered that satisfaction should\r\nbe made for their estates, to those who have been injured and oppressed\r\nby them. I have ordered, in the most positive manner, that every militia\r\nman who has borne arms with us and afterwards joined the enemy, shall be\r\nimmediately hanged. I desire you will take the most rigorous measure\r\nto punish the rebels in the district in which you command, and that you\r\nwill obey, in the strictest manner, the directions I have given in this\r\nletter, relative to the inhabitants of this country.\r\n\r\nCornwallis.\r\n\r\nAugust, 1780.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE F.]--TO LORD CORNWALLIS\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LORD CORNWALLIS.\r\n\r\nPortsmouth, Virginia, November 4, 1780.\r\n\r\nMy Lord,\r\n\r\nI have been here near a week, establishing a post.
