BRANCH’S ALLIGATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTruth Whips Fiction.\r\n\r\n _Love and Sin.—Fatality of the Metropolis.—Domestic Vices.—Virgins\r\n Beware.—Parsons Profess too much, and Practice too little.—“We must\r\n be Cruel to be Kind.”—A Terrible Example.—Let Sacred Teachers Warn\r\n their precarious Daughters to Avoid the Snares of Music and Fiction._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the shades of twilight, amid the perfume of the sunny zones, sat a\r\npale and attenuated student from the northern climes, musing of his\r\nnative vales and hills, and the sweet idol of his heart, whose latest\r\nthoughts he had just perused. He had consumed too much midnight oil at\r\ncollege, and his health was gone, and he sought the towering bluffs of\r\nNatchez for restoration, where he was a sophomoric pastor. The figs,\r\nand flowers, and balmy breezes restored his health, and he returned\r\nto his native latitudes, and married one of Eve’s most fascinating\r\nposterity. He preached\r\n\r\n  In dale and vill,\r\n  And shore and hill,\r\n\r\nand came to the metropolis, and cast a gauntlet to Dr. Wainwright on\r\nbishops and crinoline, which made owls screech, and worms squirm, and\r\nfrogs sing, and alligators grimly grin, and snakes and toads hiss and\r\nbelch sepulchrals. Wainwright boldly seized the gauntlet shaft, and\r\nthe sacred pugilists closed like panthers, and the people hissed,\r\nand laughed, and applauded, as the battle raged, and Bennett filled\r\nthe air with his most comic darts, which made the _Herald_ sell like\r\nSlievegammon news. We had worms and boils, and salt rheum, and ate\r\nGraham-bread and mush, and slept with Horace Greeley in Barclay street,\r\ntill our bones did rattle, and we could not laugh beyond a whisper, and\r\n\r\n  Our shanks were so thin,\r\n  That negroes did grin,\r\n  And, as we passed by,\r\n  Dogs and cats did cry.\r\n\r\n“Long time in even scale the battle hung,” until Potts and Wainwright\r\nretired from the field as conquerors, in the estimation of themselves\r\nand enthusiastic friends. The sun and moon and romantic stars performed\r\ntheir wonted evolutions, and Potts and Wainwright had their salaries\r\nincreased, and rose to Bishoprics and the giddy alpines of the godly\r\navenues, and we went to the setting sun, and almost beyond the world.\r\nOn our return from the bleak, and shady, and snowy slopes of the Rocky\r\nMountains, in 1849, we dwelt with Mrs. Mitchell, at the corner of\r\nHouston and McDougal streets, whose family consisted of her daughter,\r\ntwo nieces, a sister, and Otto Dressel, a teacher of piano music, whose\r\nstyle was soft, pensive, sacred, and bewitching. We had boarded with\r\nMrs. Mitchell, in Broadway, eight years previous, and in 1841, while\r\ngoing up the dark alley that led to Jackson’s pawnbroker’s shop in\r\nReade street, we met Mrs. Mitchell coming down the lane, who sneezed\r\nwhile we coughed, when we both passed on with crimson cheeks and sly\r\nglances of each other. Otto Dressel’s sleeping apartment at Mrs.\r\nMitchell’s in Houston street, in 1849, was next to ours; and many a\r\nsummer eve, while reclining on our couch, has Otto borne us into the\r\nunconscious realms of Morpheus, with his soothing and entrancing music.\r\nThe pale and rosy and dark-eyed offspring of the mother and departed\r\nsister, were ever at his door, and perhaps too often within, or on the\r\nmusic side of his portal. We often heard the thrilling echo of kisses,\r\nand the sudden tap of his piano, to drown the reverberation emblems\r\nof a lover or libertine. And we often warned the mother and sister of\r\nthe fatal intimacy between the music serpent, and the pretty virgins\r\nof their blood. But they smiled, and said: “O, fy;” and we let the\r\nmusic-teacher have his way, and he kissed and hugged the lovely maidens\r\nto his heart’s content. The eldest girl was Julia Mitchell, who drew\r\nnear one evening while we were seated on the sofa, (with no light save\r\nthe milky rays of an autumnal moon,) when she said: “Stephen, can you\r\nkeep a secret?” “Yes.” “Then listen: Otto Dressel, you perceive, is\r\nmorose and reserved, and dignified at our table, but he is a thorough\r\nscamp, and so loquacious when alone in the presence of pretty girls,\r\nthat his tongue rattles like a rattlesnake; and his music, in the\r\nsociety of spotless virgins, is so alluring, as to enrapture, and\r\nbewitch, and deprive them of self-control and consciousness. Almost\r\nevery evening, the beautiful, and musical, and intellectual daughter\r\nof the Rev. Doctor George Potts archly and slyly drops gilded notes\r\non our steps, when Otto, who is watching her arrival from his bedroom\r\nwindow, runs down stairs with the velocity of a deer, and clutches\r\nthe pale and lovely missives, and bounds up stairs like a bloodhound.\r\nOtto is her music-teacher, and he tells me that he reads with her, at\r\nher father’s and elsewhere, all the latest English, French and German\r\nworks of fiction, which fill her impulsive genius with the profoundest\r\nromance and fatality. It is about the period of her appearance, and I\r\ndesire you to take a position at the window, and behold how prettily,\r\nand gracefully, and archly, she leaves her mysterious note for her\r\nadored Otto.” We sat near the window, screened by the lattice and\r\ngauzy curtains, and presently we behold her in the distance; and,\r\nafter gazing at Otto’s window, she discovers him on the watch, and\r\nrapidly crosses the street, and, after leering cautiously around,\r\nshe softly places the letter on the steps, and hastily departs, when\r\ndown comes Otto, like a vulture for its prey, or like Putnam down the\r\nrocky precipice, or like the Falls of the eternal Niagara, and seizes\r\nthe pretty note, and flies like an eagle to his celestial cloister.\r\nJulia gently smiles, and intently gazes at us, and we at her, in the\r\nprofoundest silence, when we arise, and pace across the moonlight rays\r\nthat gild the rainbow carpet, in disconcerted meditation. Julia becomes\r\nalarmed, and exclaims: “Stephen, you seem agitated and bewildered,\r\nand I fear you will disclose in Bennett’s _Herald_ what you have seen\r\nto-night.” We assured her that we would not, and then she besought\r\nus, in plaintive tones, never to divulge our painful observations to\r\nthe Reverend Doctor Potts, and we assented, and soon retired, but\r\ncould not repose, and arose and paced the room, and in fancy rambled\r\nthrough our early days, and parted the lattice, and gazed upon the\r\nautumnal firmament, and counted its brilliant constellations. We saw\r\nthe meteors fall, and heard the watchman’s solemn cry, and closed\r\nthe lattice and retired, (with the imprudent Parson’s daughter, like\r\nan affrighted ghost, flitting before our midnight vision,) and there\r\nwas no repose for us. We tossed hither and thither, like a vessel in\r\na storm, and heard the doleful clock measure the passing hours, and\r\nheard the shrill music of the King of hens, and gladly hailed the\r\nfirst pale ray of the morning twilight that lit upon our nose, and\r\nwe arise, and enter the exhilerating atmosphere, and stroll with the\r\nearliest rays of Aurora, as she gilds the hills and sacred skies. We\r\npace the streets in excited contemplation, and waggons, and rustics,\r\nand butchers, and debauchees, and homeless wanderers pass us in rapid\r\nsuccession, for whose hard and mysterious destiny, our poor heart\r\nbeats high in tearful sympathy. We pass on, and intoxicated girls, of\r\nincomparable beauty, reeled by our side, who had just emerged from\r\ndens of infamy, where they had been decoyed, and their virginity\r\nforever blighted by incarnate demons. We rove through the commodious\r\nPark, bearing the enchanting name of Washington, and recline beneath\r\nits mellifluous foliage, and soliloquize in the mental disquietude of\r\nAristotle, when he apostrophised on his expiring pillow, with his arms\r\nacross his breast, and his deluged vision turned to Heaven: “O God!\r\nI entered the world in sin,—I have lived in anxiety, and I depart in\r\nperturbation. Cause of causes, pity me, poor Aristotle.” We ruminate\r\nwith our bewildered eyes riveted on vacancy, and suddenly resolve to\r\ndivulge all to the Reverend Doctor Potts, and at a bound are in his\r\ndazzling habitation, close by his side, whom thus rudely do we accost:\r\n“We are a stranger, on a mission of love and duty. What we disclose\r\nwill appal, and you may lose your sacred temper, and drive us from your\r\npresence. But, as we came to save your daughter from the embraces of\r\na villain, if you violate our person, we shall yearn for a terrible\r\nrevenge, and may, in our awful wrath, slay you in your own domestic\r\ncastle.” He paled and trembled,—his eyes glistened and lips quivered,\r\nand his hair actually arose. We told him to be as serene as the morning\r\nsky without, as we had come, like the Saviour, to rescue his beauteous\r\nchild from ruin, and himself, and wife, and other children from eternal\r\ndegradation; and that what we should disclose, must be concealed in his\r\nheart’s most secret recesses, until the curfew tolled the departure of\r\nhis final sun, to which he most solemnly assented. And then we divulged\r\nall we have here narrated, when he arose, and, with his hands clasped,\r\nhe cried in tones of melting tenderness: “What! my daughter! my darling\r\nchild, who is the hope and solace of my being, to drop notes for\r\nOtto Dressel in Houston street! Impossible, sir—impossible—utterly\r\nimpossible. Mr. Dressel is a great pianist, and came to this country\r\nwith letters to me from the leading men of Germany, and I have the\r\nhighest confidence in his integrity, and I permit him to visit my\r\nfamily, and he often passes his leisure in my house, and teaches music\r\nto my daughter, and they often sit for hours at the piano, and play\r\nduets and sing together like brother and sister; and I think they\r\nadmire, but do not love each other, as she is betrothed to a southern\r\ngentleman of great affluence. Otto I love, and so does my wife,\r\nand other children, and we treat him like one of us; but my eldest\r\ndaughter simply admires, but cannot love him without infidelity to her\r\nbetrothed. All her purest and most sacred affections are concentrated\r\non another. But Otto will ever be welcome to my house, for I like his\r\ndelightful music and his modest demeanor, and I cannot and will not\r\nbelieve that he could be guilty of dishonorable stratagem, to rob me\r\nof my favorite child. It is impossible, and I will not believe it.” We\r\narose, and smiled, and departed with the usual courtesy of departure.\r\nAnd soon we received the following, which we punctuate and italicise\r\nprecisely as we received it:—\r\n\r\n“_To Mr. Branch_: Dear Sir—It has just occurred to me, that I owe you\r\na line, to express again my thanks for the manly straightforward way\r\nin which you brought to _me_ the derogatory scandal you had heard. Far\r\nbetter such a method of dealing, than that of talking _about_ people\r\nof whom we have heard disparaging statements—and far better than\r\nanonymous letter-writing, which shoots arrows in the dark. Although\r\nthe affair you brought to my ears—plausible as seemed the statements\r\nyou rec’d—had no farther foundation, than the passing of notes about\r\nindifferent matters—still I am none the less obliged to you for the\r\nmanner in which you made it known to me. My promise of holding you\r\nharmless, is the only reason, why I do not call upon the parties\r\nnamed, and take them to task. This, however, I cannot do, without\r\nyour permission—nor perhaps is it of any importance I should. I may,\r\nhowever, suggest to yourself a good office toward the young person,\r\nwith whom this story, (which owes its plausibility to a little fact,\r\nand a good deal of suspicious fancy,) originated: namely to warn her\r\n_of the danger_ of letting her imagination and her tongue run away with\r\nher. Respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n  GEORGE POTTS.\r\n\r\nNov. 9, 1849.\r\n\r\nP. S.—If it should be at all in your power, you would oblige me if you\r\ncould verify the story of the dropping of notes, and who the person (if\r\nsuch an one there be) is.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE IS OUR REPLY.\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK CITY, Nov. 12, 1849.\r\n\r\n_To the Rev. Dr. Potts_: Dear Sir—Your approval of my course is truly\r\ngrateful to my feelings. On my return to my abode on the day I saw\r\nyou, my interrogations elicited the following which I forward as an\r\nanswer to your request in your postscript, although I supposed I had\r\nsufficiently verified all I disclosed. Miss Mitchell says that she\r\nknows your daughter, when she sees her, and her mother and two nieces\r\nalso know her by sight; that the Saturday previous (three days prior\r\nto my visit to you), she saw your daughter ascend the steps, ring\r\nthe bell, request the servant (who is in collusion with Dressel and\r\nyour daughter), to hand a note to Mr. Dressel, and depart as far as\r\nthe corner of Sullivan and Houston streets, where she tarried until\r\nMr. Dressel (leaving immediately on the receipt of the note in his\r\nroom) overtook her, when they walked away together, arm in arm, and\r\nthat similar scenes occurred while Mr. Dressel boarded with them\r\nin Bond street, last Winter, where the correspondence began, which\r\nhas also been conducted through the Dispatch Post ever since, Mr.\r\nDressel sometimes receiving as many as three letters per week; that\r\na colored boy has sometimes brought the letters; that these letters\r\n(at least those Miss Mitchell perused, at Mr. Dressel’s request,)\r\ncomprised six closely written pages, with the name of your daughter\r\nannexed, beginning with: “My dear, dear Otto:” and with “My dearest\r\nand very best friend,” &c.; that these letters bear the impress, on\r\nthe seal, of “Happiness,” “Pain,” “Eye,” &c; that Mr. Dressel has\r\nyour daughter’s daguerreotype, which has been open on the piano, in\r\nthe parlor of Mrs. Mitchell, or on the piano or bed in Mr. Dressel’s\r\napartment. Now, my dear Sir, if all this be fallacious, Miss Mitchell\r\ndeserves a severe retribution. Time will show as to its truth. I am\r\nequally the friend of Mr. Dressel, and of the family of Mrs. Mitchell,\r\nand of your own family, all of whom are strangers to me in the light\r\nof consanguinity, and nearly by association, save as the boarder of\r\nMrs. Mitchell now and hitherto. But if I can save your daughter from\r\nthe dreadful calamity of elopement, and her parents from the deep\r\nmortification and anguish that would arise therefrom, I assure you that\r\nI will do so, come what may. The pride and glory of your family, and\r\nof a large circle of acquaintance and friends, shall not be suddenly\r\nand surreptitiously sacrificed forever, if I can avert it. So, my dear\r\nSir, you can command my services as you please, in a rational way, in\r\nall this business. I repeat what I said at our interview, (in reply\r\nto your assertion of implicit confidence in your daughter,) that you\r\nmust not lose sight of the frailties of our nature, with its unreliable\r\nand treacherous impulsions, nor of the power of genius, nor the\r\nextraordinary fascinations of music (in the hands of a great master),\r\nover the delicate, unsophisticated, and enthusiastic mind of a female,\r\nwith kindred musical genius; and that even opposing natures often form\r\nalliances of friendship and matrimony.\r\n\r\n  From your friend,\r\n  STEPHEN H. BRANCH.\r\n\r\nTo Rev. Dr. George Potts.\r\n\r\nN. B.—I trust you will excuse the haste with which this letter was\r\nwritten, owing to the arrival of friends from California, on yesterday.\r\n\r\n  S. H. B.\r\n\r\nTime rolls! Mr. Perkins, a young lawyer, (formerly of Natchez, but who\r\nhad removed to New Orleans,) comes North, and marries the daughter of\r\nthe Rev. Dr. Potts, and they sail for Paris, where he discovers in her\r\ntrunk the very letters that Dressel wrote her while at Mrs. Mitchell’s,\r\nin response to her “drop notes,” and also letters from Dressel that\r\nshe had just received in Paris, which were enclosed in her mother’s\r\nletters from New York. Terrible scenes transpire, resembling those\r\nbetween Othello and Desdemona, and she flies from him in terror, and\r\nconceals herself in Paris, and writes to her father, who goes to Paris\r\nand accompanies her to America, when he immediately sends for us, and\r\nweeps in our presence, and deeply regrets that he had not adopted our\r\nadvice, and driven Dressel into the street, who, with the imprudence\r\nof his own wife, in inclosing Dressel’s letters to his daughter in\r\nParis, had plunged his family into irremediable ruin. Perkins returns\r\nand goes to the Irving House, at the corner of Chambers street and\r\nBroadway, where we had frequent interviews, when he cries like a little\r\nchild, and denounces Mr. and Mrs. Potts, but defends the chastity of\r\nhis wife, and regrets his passion and his furious anathema of her in\r\nParis. The matter is thrown into the Courts, and Perkins employs Daniel\r\nLord, William Kent, and Benjamin F. Butler, and Potts engages Wm.\r\nCurtis Noyes, Ogden Hoffman, and —— Staples, and both Perkins and\r\nPotts strive to induce us to testify in their favor, and because we\r\nperemptorily refused, and assured them we should disclose the truth on\r\nthe stand, they dared not call the case for trial, lest our testimony\r\nwould overwhelm both parties, and consign them to eternal odium and\r\nmisery. Perkins obtained a divorce, and was elected to Congress, and\r\nmarried a Southern lady. Miss Potts remains single, and is a noble\r\nornament of society. One of Mrs. Mitchell’s nieces was seduced by a\r\nmonster, and had a child, and she soon became a prostitute, and her\r\nmother a lunatic. Julia Mitchell married a Southron, who professed\r\ngreat wealth, but proved to be a pauper, and a villain of the deepest\r\ncalibre. Julia obtained a divorce, and married a Mr. Moffat, who was\r\nalso supposed to be immensely affluent. Mrs. Mitchell died, and her\r\nother niece resides with Mrs. Julia Moffat. And thus ends the first\r\nChapter of this mournful narrative.\r\n\r\n  O whence have we come?\r\n  And where shall we go?\r\n  And why are we here\r\n  To combat woe?\r\n  O come fair spirit\r\n  Through the air,\r\n  And tell us more\r\n  Of this affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen H. Branch’s Alligator.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, SATURDAY, MAY 8, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nIce Cream.\r\n\r\n _The toiling million starved by the heartless Politicians, and the\r\n Fifth Avenue Robbers of the Public Treasure, who are the source of\r\n Oppressive Taxation, and Exorbitant Rents, and Fuel, and Food, and\r\n Raiment, and Prostitution, and Suicide, and of Theft, Rape, Arson, and\r\n Assassination._\r\n\r\nReclining on the velvet banks of the Hudson, were Mayor Kingsland\r\nand little Georgy, with steamers, and mariners, and forests, and the\r\nfull round moon, and radiant stars reflected in the placid waters.\r\nWith segars, and wine, and luscious cream before them, Georgy said:\r\n“Kingsland: I came from Brandon in the ship Perseus, in 1817, and was\r\na valiant youth. Patrick Dickey was a passenger, with 400 others. We\r\nexchanged vessels at Halifax, and tarried several months at Perth\r\nAmboy, and resided in Banker street, (the Fifth Avenue of those days,)\r\nand at Niblo’s Garden, where my father was a fashionable Broadway\r\ndandy tailor, on whose big sign was ‘George Matsell, Tailor, from\r\nLondon.’ Our residence was the first brownstone mansion erected on\r\nBroadway. My father was of the Paine, Wright, and Owen creed, which I\r\nearly imbibed. My brother Augustus was the Secretary of Fanny Wright,\r\nand I was her enthusiastic disciple, and sold her books, and pretty\r\npictures, which were not obscene, and for which I was not indicted;\r\nnor were my associates imprisoned thirty days in the Tombs, whom I\r\ninduced to visit America. Through Fanny Wright and George II. Purser,\r\n(who was the favorite of Fanny,) and Robert Dale Owen, I became a\r\nCustom House officer, under Martin Van Buren, and a Police Justice\r\nunder Mayor Varian, and Chief of Police under Mayor Havemeyer, with\r\nwhom and all his successors I had great influence. I pulled the nose\r\nof every Mayor save Havemeyer, whom I found extremely mulish; and\r\nyet I made him fear me when I chose. Although my salary was small,\r\nyet I realized a stupendous fortune like yourself, since you began\r\nyour political career in the First Ward, as a shoulder-hitter, and\r\na candidate for Assistant Alderman, and successful municipal oil\r\ncontractor. We understand these political ropes and wires, Kingsland,\r\nand it is unnecessary to linger on them. You are on the Fifth Avenue,\r\nin a Persian Palace, while I adhere to Stanton street, in a humble\r\ndwelling, lest I be suspected by my enemies of acquiring vast treasures\r\nthrough my office of Chief. I think you commit a fatal error in your\r\ndisplay of magnificence, but I’ll not murmur, as all are responsible\r\nfor their own sins and imprudence. You may have a boisterous career,\r\nand a gust may arise, like that of Astor Place, when you may require\r\nmy services. My coolness and intrepidity on that occasion, saved the\r\ncity from universal massacre and conflagration. I judiciously remained\r\nin the Opera House, and commanded Woodhull, Talmadge, Westervelt and\r\nSandford, to fire at the mob in the street, or all would have been\r\nlost, and the city instantly demolished, and its inhabitants butchered\r\nand burned to bleeding fragments and Kansas cinders. I was in the\r\nstage-box throughout the frightful spectacle, lest from my immense fat,\r\nI might be as palpable a target for the foe, as Daniel Lambert, my\r\nremotest ancestor on my Daddy’s side. Lambert is from Lamb, a word of\r\nBrandon origin, and hence the mildness of my disposition, although I\r\nam terrible in bloody conflicts, where the fate of a city is involved.\r\nAnd the eye of Providence was in my appointment by Havemeyer, and my\r\nskillful and courageous direction of the entire Astor Place riots.\r\nThe Mayor, Recorder, Sheriff, and the General, were pale and timid,\r\nand faltered, and it required the lungs of Knox, (who could bellow\r\ninto the ears of Washington across the icy and tumultuous atmosphere\r\nof the Delaware,) and the nervous fat of an immediate descendant of\r\nLambert, and the herculean vigor of Sampson, and the impetuosity of\r\nPutnam, to brave the demons of Astor Place who strove to exterminate\r\nmy countryman the gallant, and graceful, and intellectual Macready,\r\nwho was right in the introduction of a dance in Hamlet, as Hamlet’s\r\ngrandfather was a dancing master to the King of Denmark, and hence\r\nNed Forrest had no right to hiss Macready for his testimonial of\r\nrespect to Hamlet’s grand-father. Shakespeare, himself, was long a\r\ncorrespondent of Hamlet’s grand-father, and introduced the dance in\r\nHamlet from his respect to his old friend, which Johnson ejected\r\nduring the very year that Shakespeare died, because he had a quarrel\r\nwith Hamlet’s grand-father in a ball-room, in Denmark, when Johnson\r\nnot only got licked, but had his nose broken in five places, besides\r\nthe horrible and irremediable fracture of its tip end. This is the\r\ngist of the whole Astor Place quarrel, and MacCready was familiar with\r\nall these historical truths, and hence his introduction of the dance\r\nin Hamlet. I saved the city and MacCready, and by adroit tactics I\r\nsaved myself, by adhering to the stage box, (with a pistol in either\r\nhand,) until the massacre was over in the street, and the exasperated\r\npopulace had dispersed, when I rushed into the open air, and knocked\r\ndown a blind-crippled-music-grinder, and brandished my sword and\r\npistols ferociously, and frightened a little boy almost to death, who\r\nwas inquiring for his mother. It was hard for me to order the Mayor,\r\nRecorder, Sheriff, and General, to fire upon the Americans; but my duty\r\nto a fellow-countryman in peril, and to myself, and to the people,\r\nwhose alien Chief I was,—and, above all, to a God, in whom I ardently\r\nbelieve, and love, and fear, and into whose eternal embrace I expect\r\nto go, demanded me to indirectly give the thrilling and fatal word of\r\nfire, which hurled a score of beings into the dreary entrails of the\r\nglobe, and into the sudden and awful presence of our common Deity.\r\nAnd now, Kingsland, my dear boy, in view of my tried courage, and my\r\nprodigious influence with the file of Mayors who have preceded you,\r\nand of my aid to you in primary elections, and of my powerful recent\r\nsecret support of you in your nomination and election—and—and—you\r\nknow, Kingsland, all the rest. I say that, in view of all this, I\r\ndesire you to let me remain as Chief of Police, for which I will cling\r\nto you as I did to Fanny Wright, and Robert Dale Owen, and George H.\r\nPurser, and to the City of New York in its hour of peril. Do this,\r\nmy dear Kingsland, and I will lobby through the Common Council the\r\nGanzevoort jobs, and all the oil contracts you desire, and let you go\r\nwhere you please unmolested; and you can join Messrs. Paine & Phalon\r\nin musical, or lottery and policy operations, and buy as many millions\r\nof dollars’ worth of land in Williamsburgh and Greenpoint, and own as\r\nmany licentious houses in Church, and Leonard, and other streets, as\r\nyou desire, and I will not cull a solitary hair from your beautiful and\r\nconscientious skull. What is your response?”\r\n\r\n_Kingsland._—“Have I not declared that you were my first choice for\r\nChief of Police?”\r\n\r\n_Matsell._—“Yes. But that was only a verbal declaration. I desire\r\nthe bird in my own cage. I want the fascinating documents under your\r\nsignature.”\r\n\r\n_Kingsland._—“Waiter: Bring me pen, ink and paper. [Writes.] There,\r\nMatsell, there it is, but do not use it until I see my political\r\nfriends, and conciliate them with the assurance that your appointment\r\nwas absolutely essential to the preservation of the Metropolis from\r\nriots, and sword, and fire, and ashes. If I fail to allay their\r\nexasperation, I shall send them to you, and if you fail to pacify them\r\nwith promises of appointment, and those sweet accents that flow like\r\nStuart’s syrup from your ruddy lips, and your oriental bows, and meek\r\nscrapes, and cringing smiles,—why, then, you must put your bloodhounds\r\non their track on howling tempest nights, (when only owls dare prowl\r\nthrough the fearful darkness of ether,) who will pursue them to the\r\ndens of infamy and revelry, and blasphemy, and obscenity, and dicery,\r\nwhen you will have them in your awful clutches, as you have me. O, God!\r\nMatsell, I hardly know what I say. Wine works wonders, and now let us\r\nfill our glasses to the brim, and have another dulcet cream, and depart\r\nfor the Metropolis,—and at our nocturnal farewell, let us kneel and\r\nswear beneath the universal concave, that we will cling to each other\r\nlike Damon and Pythias, or Burr and Arnold, until our wormy conquerors\r\nbegin their happy feast, and grin and dance over our silent and icy\r\nforms in the dreary and awful sepulchre. But remember my oil and other\r\ncontracts, Matsell. Be piously true to them. When we next meet, I’ll\r\ntell you how to effect their continuation with the Aldermen, if you\r\ndon’t know already, from your limited experience.”\r\n\r\n_Chorus._\r\n\r\n  O, oil is the thing\r\n  That the stuff will bring,\r\n  Which will buy sweet cream\r\n  To eat on life’s stream.\r\n\r\n [More ice-cream next Saturday, of a superior quality.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupervisor Blunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo more public documents, written by Stephen H. Branch for Orison\r\nBlunt, who was Alderman of the Third Ward in 1854, and Alderman of the\r\nFifteenth Ward in 1857, and is now Supervisor from the Fifteenth Ward.\r\n\r\n [From the N. Y. Herald, April 22, 1851.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul Julien’s Second Concert.\r\n\r\nThe youthful artist has created a perfect _furore_ in musical\r\ncircles—amateurs, professionals, _dilettanti_ and every body else;\r\nhis talent is wonderful, and his improvement still more remarkable.\r\nHe has, withal, the modesty which is the companion of true merit. His\r\nsecond concert was given at Niblo’s Saloon, on Thursday evening, and\r\nit was attended by as full and fashionable an audience as that which\r\nwelcomed him on Tuesday evening. Mayseder’s grand variations were\r\ngiven for the second time, upon a single string; the second attempt\r\nwas even more successful than the first, and the young artist gave the\r\nhighest proof of genius in overcoming difficulties previously regarded\r\nas insurmountable. Another gem of the soiree was a duet for violin and\r\npiano-forte, by Julien and Richard Hoffman. It was capitally given and\r\nwas encored. The vocal part of the concert was given by Mme. Commettant\r\nand M’lle. Henrietta Behrend. The enthusiasm of the audience at the\r\nmatchless execution of Julien was unbounded.\r\n\r\nBut an episode occurred yesterday which was more telling in its effects\r\nthan the applause of the audience on Thursday evening. It was a grand\r\n“variation” in the form of five one thousand dollar bank notes, a\r\ngift to the young musical genius. The following extraordinary letters\r\ndescribe the affair:\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK, April 21, 1854.\r\n\r\n_Master Paul Julien_: I have heard your delightful music in the Concert\r\nroom, and you have had the kindness to play for myself and friends\r\nat my residence. In earlier life I strove to learn the violin, but I\r\nabandoned it as too difficult for me. Its intricacies are unconquerable\r\nto all save those who are inspired. I have heard of the extraordinary\r\nperseverance and severe pecuniary trials through which your father has\r\npassed, to impart to you, his only child, a musical education. And I\r\ndeem the efforts of both father and son highly commendable, and truly\r\nworthy of encouragement. I therefore present you with five thousand\r\ndollars, which I trust will be consecrated to your intellectual,\r\nmusical, and moral culture.—Sincerely,\r\n\r\n  ORISON BLUNT.\r\n\r\n [_Turn over for Paul’s response._]\r\n\r\n  New York, April 21, 1854.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Sir_:—Mere words, though brightly glowing with affection,\r\ncould not express my grateful emotions for your unexampled munificence.\r\nNor could the most stirring strains I ever expect to conceive, reflect\r\nthe chords you have touched in my heart. I can only assure you, that\r\nI will be very studious, and fondly cherish you next to my father and\r\nmother. I may soon return to France, and if you should ever visit\r\nme, I am sure that my friends would cordially receive you, for your\r\nsubstantial kindness to me during my sojourn in a far distant land.\r\nAffectionately,\r\n\r\n  PAUL JULIEN.\r\n\r\n  Alderman Orison Blunt,\r\n  Warren street, New York.\r\n\r\nWe led Alderman Blunt into this, and we trust the public will not\r\ncensure him, but lash us most unmercifully for such a vile imposture.\r\nBlunt never gave a cent to Paul Julien,—and when we asked him some\r\ntime afterwards, to aid Paul, he declined; but Alderman Thomas Christy\r\ngave Paul $80, to relieve himself and father and mother. When we had\r\nour last sad interview with Madame Sontag, just prior to her fatal\r\ndeparture for Mexico, by way of the Lakes, (in a conversation of three\r\nhours at her room in the Mansion House in Albany) she assured us there\r\nnever was such a talented youth as Paul Julien, and that she had\r\nadopted him, and warmly besought us never to desert him, not only as\r\nhis private teacher, but as his pecuniary friend, and we most solemnly\r\npromised we would not. After Sontag died in Mexico, Paul became very\r\npoor, and as we were also indigent, we hatched this stratagem to\r\ndeceive the public, and create excitement, and fill a concert room for\r\nPaul, and we asked Blunt to sign this sham letter, which he did. We\r\nhave ever been disgusted with this wicked imposition, and have suffered\r\nthe compunction of a penitent thief, and we now dash the odium from our\r\nconscience, as a midnight spider prowling round our nose. And as it is\r\nthe only Barnum and Ullman operation in which we ever were enlisted, we\r\ntrust and believe that the public will forgive us.\r\n\r\nJames Gordon Bennett knew nothing of our imposition, nor did Frederick\r\nHudson, his Private Secretary, until the present week, when we\r\ndisclosed the whole infamous proceeding to Mr. Hudson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFun, and Sun, and Shade.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCES FAUVEL GOURAUD, the mnemonic lecturer of 1843, gave gold\r\npencils and other gilded trinkets to males, and reticules to females.\r\nJohn Innman was editor of the _Commercial Advertiser_, to whom he gave\r\na massive gold pencil, and desired to give a reticule to his fair lady,\r\nwho was sister of the once famous Clara Fisher, and now Mrs. Maeder.\r\nThe day was warm, and the cholera diarrhœa was prevalent, and he loudly\r\nrings the bell, and dashes into the house with all the enthusiasm of a\r\nFrenchman, and screams: “Mrs. Innman: Have you got one _necessaire_?”\r\nShe is dumb for seconds, and her lily cheeks are balls of fire, and\r\nindignant phrenzy glares in her eyes, when she proclaims: “I will call\r\nthe servant,” and furiously retires. The servant darts in and balls\r\nout: “Come hither sir,” and on he tramps, behind the servant, into\r\nthe basement and the yard, where he is politely escorted into the\r\n_necessaire_, when he savagely ejaculates: “The _diable_! You von tam\r\nskamp! Why for you take me in dis vile place? By gar! by dam! What is\r\ndat I smell? What you for eat so much unions in dis country? You one\r\ntam rascal! What for you bring me in dis nasty place”?\r\n\r\n_Servant_—“Mrs. Innman directed mo to show you the necessaire.”\r\n\r\n_Gouraud_—“_Necessaire!_ Vat!—You call dis _necessaire_? By gar! You\r\ntell one tam lie. A _necessaire_ is full of holes.”\r\n\r\n_Servant_—“And is not this _necessaire_ full of holes?”\r\n\r\n_Gouraud_—“Yes—dat we admit for de argument—but they are such tam\r\npig holes, dat de ladies’ perfume would all run out into de street. Why\r\ndoes for you laugh right in my face? Me will break your tam head if you\r\nlaugh at me. A _necessaire_ has very small holes in my superb French\r\nbeautiful and sublime and very glorious country. Me did not mean to\r\nask Mrs. Innman for dis kind of _necessaire_. Me mean one little box,\r\nor bag, or re-tickle-em, to put her sweet perfume handkerchief, and\r\nother pretty little things in. Whew! O, by gar! Me shall sneeze? How me\r\nnose do tickle! Git me out of dis one tam yard. Me be sick already. By\r\ndam—me are ruined. Ah che—Horatio! Dare—does you not see dat? Did\r\nnot me say me should sneeze? By dam! How you does smell in dis nasty\r\ncountry. Where is Mrs. Innman? Me must explain to her that me mean de\r\nother _necessaire_, and not dis _necessaire_.”\r\n\r\n_Servant_—“You perhaps had better see Mr. Innman, as it would not be\r\nproper to explain such a thing to Mrs. Innman.”\r\n\r\n_Gouraud_—(Seizing the servant by the throat)—“You are one tam\r\nvillain, and me tell you me must see Mrs. Innman, for to ask her\r\npardon, or Mr. Innman will give me no more puffs of my astonishing\r\nSystem of Mnemotechny. Me must see Mrs. Innman. Dare—dare is one gold\r\npencil, (it was copper plated) and now let me see Mrs. Innman.”\r\n\r\n_Servant_—“Well, I will ask her if it be agreeable to see you.”\r\n\r\n_Gouraud_—“Bury well—bury well—and me will wait domb stairs, until\r\nyou come with Mrs. Innman.”\r\n\r\n_Servant_—(returns) “I have explained everything to Mrs. Innman, who\r\nsays that she hopes you will excuse her from an explanatory interview,\r\nand regrets that _necessaire_ has been confounded with something less\r\nfragrant, and that she is very sorry she had you escorted into the\r\nyard.”\r\n\r\n_Gouraud_—Seizes both hands of the servant, and dances, and runs him\r\nup and down the parlor like fury, and cuts half a dozen pigeons’ wings\r\nwith his buoyant legs, and sings Marseilles, and darts out of the\r\nhouse, and down the street, as though a creditor was after him; and\r\nin the far perspective, with his elastic step and fancy and frantic\r\ngesticulation, evinces a wild delight that resembles the ecstacies of\r\nElysium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Beloved Brethren of the Press.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reporters of the Common Council have received 200 dollars each for\r\ntheir laborious services, which is a happiness to us beyond expression.\r\nWe know their generous emotions, and their evening toil in a sickly\r\natmosphere, some of whom have the ability and genius to wield the\r\ndestinies of a city or nation. Although Horace Greeley recently told us\r\nthat he had never been in the Board of Aldermen, and would hardly know\r\nwhere to find it, yet James Gordon Bennett has told us that he served a\r\nterrible apprenticeship as a Reporter of the Common Council, more than\r\na quarter of a century since, and we know that most of the metropolitan\r\neditors were Municipal Reporters prior to their present exalted and\r\nlucrative, and powerful position as public journalists. Even before we\r\nbaptised the _Alligator_, we had to endure the tortures of a ten years’\r\npilgrimage around the corners and through the subterranean caverns\r\nof the City Hall. But no more of this. We sincerely congratulate our\r\nReportorial friends, on the reception of a trifling remuneration for\r\ntheir severe and honorable toil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1857, by\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN H. BRANCH,\r\n\r\nIn the Clerk’s Office of the District Court of the United States for\r\nthe Southern District of New Turk.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife of Stephen H. Branch.\r\n\r\nMy brother Albert came to New York without the knowledge of father, and\r\nI got him a situation at the Harpers. I shall never forget how hard\r\nI besought John Harper to employ Albert, who did not want a boy, but\r\nkindly employed him to please me. Albert had the salt rheum, and also\r\nhad very small and spiteful yellow bugs on the surface of his cranium.\r\nAs I had to sleep with him, I combed his head every day, and when I\r\nfound one of the little villains, I most cruelly tortured him with\r\npins and flame, to terrify his brethren who remained, and to thwart\r\nhis return to Albert’s head. But in spite of my bloody precaution,\r\npoor Albert’s skull teemed like Egypt of old, with ferocious animals,\r\nand I retired with him at night, invested with the fear of a culprit\r\non his march to the scaffold. The yellow scamps made such a Napoleonic\r\nresistance, that I procured a finer comb, and in my violent efforts\r\nto drag out and exterminate the enemy, (who were deeply embedded and\r\nirresistibly fortified in his invulnerable skull,) poor Ally screamed,\r\nlike an eagle on his cliff, and Mrs. Harper came to the basis of the\r\nattic stairs, and severely scolded us for quarrelling and fighting,\r\nas she supposed. Mrs. Harper was extremely nervous, and fearing she\r\nwould learn that Albert had battalions of animalculæ in the region\r\nof his brain, and also trembling lest they would ground arms, and\r\nencamp and form tents in my luxuriant intellectual foliage, I advised\r\nAlbert to return to Providence, and after long persuasion, with candy\r\nand peanuts, and peaches, he assented, and I went to Captain Bunker,\r\nJunior, who kindly consented to take him to Providence, without charge.\r\nWhile leaning on the railing of the steamer, with our eyes on the\r\nbeautiful panorama of the bay, Captain Bunker told me that my lot was\r\ncast in a vicious city, and that I must resist evil temptation, and\r\nalways be a good boy, and become a worthy man, and breathed other\r\nkind words into my ears, which soothed my lonely and inexperienced\r\nheart, made me cry vociferously, and I have always cherished him with\r\nthe purest affection. Albert went to Providence with Captain Bunker,\r\nbut instead of going to father’s, he proceeded to Boston with the\r\nmoney John Harper gave him, and thence to Eastport, Maine, where the\r\nyellow bugs increased so rapidly, that he was compelled to return to\r\nProvidence, where father had his head shaved, which presented a bloody\r\nbattle plain, full of teeming entrenchments, and his yellow foes so\r\nbewildered him, that the hospital nurses had to watch him closely, for\r\nseveral days, lest he would destroy himself.\r\n\r\nJohn Harper often called me from the composing to the counting room,\r\nand sent me to the Banks in Wall street to get or deposit money. I\r\noften contemplated the robbery of the Harpers, by flight to a foreign\r\nland; but when I reviewed their exact justice to all men, and their\r\nkindness to myself and brother Albert, and to all their apprentices,\r\njourneymen, and laborers, I would falter in my wicked purpose. While\r\nreturning from bank with a $500 bill, I dropped it by design, and asked\r\na stranger if he had lost it, who said yes, and strove to seize it from\r\nthe pavement, but I was about one second in his advance. While about\r\nto run, he seized me and demanded the return of his $500 bill. I cried\r\nand screamed lustily, and during the scuffle, two gentlemen came to my\r\nrelief, when my antagonist soon fled, and I run down Cliff street, like\r\na bloodhound. Better time was never made from the old pump of Saint\r\nGeorge’s to the Harpers. I never again pretended to lose a $500 bill.\r\n\r\n (To be continued to our last groan.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following meritorious gentlemen are wholesale agents for the\r\nAlligator.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ross & Tousey, 121 Nassau street.\r\n  Hamilton & Johnson, 22 Ann street.\r\n  Samuel Yates, 22 Beekman street.\r\n  Mike Madden, 21 Ann street.\r\n  Cauldwell & Long, 23 Ann street.\r\n  Boyle & Whalen, 32 Ann street and\r\n  Bell & Hendrickson., 25 Ann street.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertisements—One Dollar a line\r\n\r\nIN ADVANCE.\r\n\r\nAUG.
