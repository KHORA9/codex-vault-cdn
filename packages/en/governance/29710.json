Arriving\r\nin Dublin in March, it at once became evident that the industrial\r\ncommunity regarded Home Rule, not with the academical indifference\r\nattributed to the bulk of the English electorate, but with absolute\r\ndismay; not as a possibility which might be pleasantly discussed\r\nbetween friends, but as a wholly unnecessary measure, darkly\r\niniquitous, threatening the total destruction of all they held dear.\r\nEnglish lukewarmness was hotly resented, but the certainty that\r\nEngland must herself receive a dangerous if not a mortal wound, was\r\nscant comfort to men who felt themselves on the eve of a hopeless\r\nstruggle for political, nay, even for material existence. This was\r\nbefore the vast demonstrations of Belfast and Dublin, before the\r\nmemorable function in the Albert Hall, London, before the hundreds of\r\nspeakers sent forth by the Irish Unionist Alliance had visited\r\nEngland, spreading the light of accurate knowledge, returning to\r\nIreland with tidings of comfort and joy. The change in public feeling\r\nwas instant and remarkable. Although from day to day the passage of\r\nthe Bill through the Commons became more and more a certainty, the\r\nIrish Unionists completely discarded their fears, resuming their\r\nnormal condition of trust and confidence. Mr. H.L. Barnardo, J.P., of\r\nDublin, aptly expressed the universal feeling when he said:--\r\n\r\n\"We have been to England, and we know three things,--that the Bill\r\nwill pass the Commons, that the Lords will throw it out, and that the\r\nEnglish people don't care if they do.\"\r\n\r\nThis accounted for the renewed serenity of the well-doing classes,\r\nwhose air and attitude were those of men thankful for having narrowly\r\nescaped a great danger. The rebound was easily observable in cities\r\nlike Dublin and Belfast, where also was abundantly evident the placid\r\nresignation of the Separatist forces, whose discontent with the actual\r\nBill and profound distrust of its framer, superadded to an\r\never-increasing qualmishness inevitably arising from acquaintance with\r\nthe prospective statesmen of an Irish Legislature, caused them to look\r\nforward to the action of the Lords with ill-disguised complacency. In\r\nregions more remote the scattered Loyalists lacked the consolation\r\narising from numbers and propinquity to England, and accordingly their\r\ntremors continued, and, in a smaller degree, continue still. To them\r\nthe Bill is a matter of life and death; and while their industry is\r\ncrippled, their mental peace is destroyed by the ever-present torture\r\nof suspense.\r\n\r\nAs to the merits of the case for Home Rule, I would earnestly ask\r\nfair-minded opponents to remember that during my wanderings I met with\r\nnumbers of intelligent and honourable men, both Scots and English, who\r\nhaving come to Ireland as earnest, nay, even by their own confession,\r\nas bigoted Gladstonians, had changed their opinions on personal\r\nacquaintance with the facts, and strove with all the energy of\r\nconscientious men who had unwittingly led others astray, to repair, so\r\nfar as in them lay, the results of their former political action. And\r\nit should be especially noted that of all those I so met who had\r\narrived in Ireland as Home Rulers, not one retained his original\r\nfaith. A very slight process of inductive reasoning will develop the\r\nsuggestiveness of this incontestible fact.\r\n\r\nReaders will hardly require to be reminded that the letters were\r\nwritten, not in studious retirement with ample time at command, but\r\nfor a Daily Paper, at the rate of nearly eight newspaper columns a\r\nweek, in the intervals of travel and inquiry, often under grave\r\ndifficulties and with one eye on the inexorable clock. The precepts of\r\nthe Master were of necessity ignored:--\r\n\r\n    _Sæpe stylum vertas, iterum quæ digna legi sint Scripturus;\r\n    neque, te ut miretur turba labores Contentus paucis lectoribus._\r\n\r\nBut before committing them to paper, the facts were sifted with\r\nscrupulous care, and where personal investigation was impracticable,\r\nnothing was adduced except upon evidence of weight and authority\r\nsufficient to prove anything. And as during a six months' hue and cry\r\nof the Nationalist press of Ireland, aided and abetted by some English\r\nprints, no single statement was in any degree shaken, the letters have\r\nre-appeared precisely as at first.\r\n\r\n                                         R.J.B.,\r\n     Special Commissioner of the _Birmingham Daily Gazette_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S REVIEW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Birmingham Daily Gazette_ of August 18, 1893, thus summed up the\r\nlabours of its Special Commissioner:--We publish to-day the last of\r\nour Special Commissioner's letters on \"Ireland As It Is.\" His task has\r\nbeen an arduous one, and not without a strong element of personal\r\ndanger. That he has been kept under the close observation of the Irish\r\npolice; that they have frequently given him timely warning of personal\r\ndanger; that he has dared to go to places in County Clare when the\r\npolice warned him to refrain, and his native car-driver refused to\r\nventure, are facts which he has modestly abstained from bringing into\r\nthe prominence they deserved. We must necessarily speak of the merits\r\nof his labour with a certain measure of reserve, but the many letters\r\nwhich lie before us are at least a gratifying proof that his work has\r\nbeen appreciated, and that it has cast new lights upon the Irish\r\nproblem. To the simple direction, \"State nothing that you cannot stand\r\nby,\" he has been faithful even beyond our most sanguine hopes. A\r\nstranger in a strange land seeking information wherever it can be\r\nfound, and compelled on many occasions to accept the statements made\r\nto him, may easily be led into error. It is to the credit of our\r\nCommissioner that he has withheld some of the most sensational stories\r\nretailed to him, because he had not an opportunity of verifying them\r\nin detail. The notorious Father Humphreys, of Tipperary, will not\r\nsoon forget his experience of giving the lie to the _Gazette_; neither\r\nwill those who organised an \"indignation\" meeting at Tuam be likely to\r\ncongratulate themselves upon having stung our Commissioner into\r\nretaliation. It may be recalled as an illustration of the desperate\r\nefforts made to discredit him that after he had attended a Nationalist\r\nmeeting at Dundalk he was denounced as a \"liar\" and a \"pimp\" because\r\nhe had stated that he was invited to address the score of persons who\r\nhad \"met in their thousands\" to shake the foundations of the British\r\nEmpire. His assailants fiercely declared that he was not invited to\r\nspeak; he was only informed that he might address the meeting if he\r\ndesired to do so!\r\n\r\nOur Commissioner has travelled about four thousand miles since he\r\nstarted last March. He has taken no lop-sided view of Ireland. The\r\nprosperous North has been contrasted with the stagnant South, and the\r\ncauses of their difference have been explained. The splendid work of\r\nindustrial development inaugurated in the poverty-stricken West by\r\nthat greatest of all Irish Secretaries, Mr. Balfour, has been compared\r\nwith the mischievous encouragements of idleness, the lavish\r\nprofessions of sentimental sympathy, and the dogged refusals of\r\nsubstantial help since the present Government took office. Above all,\r\nour Commissioner has provided conclusive evidence that Irish\r\nNationalism is a mere delusive sham--a paltry euphemism for the\r\npredatory passion which a succession of professional agitators have\r\naroused in the hearts of the people. If the Land Question could be\r\nsettled, there would be an end of the clamour for independence and of\r\nthe insensate shrieking against British rule. With a definite stake in\r\nthe country the peasantry upon whom the Nationalist agitation mainly\r\nrelies would cease to place their faith in the impecunious and\r\nblatant scoundrelism which fattens upon the discord and misery which\r\nit provokes in the name of Patriotism. Our Commissioner believes that\r\nthe priests, who have an even stronger hold upon the people than the\r\npoliticians, would find their power weakened if it were possible to\r\ngreatly extend the system of peasant proprietary which it was the\r\npurpose of the Land Purchase of 1891 to foster. Land hunger lies at\r\nthe root of Irish disaffection, and the Romish hierarchy have found in\r\nthe deep-rooted prejudices and the ignorant superstitions of the\r\npeople a foundation upon which they have reared an appalling\r\nsuperstructure of social and spiritual tyranny. Politicians have\r\ntaught the peasantry to believe that they have been robbed of the land\r\nwhich is their only means of subsistence in a country that is\r\ndestitute of mineral wealth, that lacks capital, and is overshadowed\r\nby the enormous commercial energy of Great Britain. The priests have\r\nadopted the theses of politicians, and have brought the terrors of\r\ntheir sacred calling into play in order to make themselves the masters\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nHome Rule would be the signal for a ghastly civil war, ruinous to\r\nIreland, and fatal to that spirit of religious toleration by which the\r\nRoman Catholics and the Protestants have obtained equal rights of\r\ncitizenship under the rule of the Queen and the Imperial Parliament.\r\nThe cultured Roman Catholics of England and Ireland look with pain and\r\nregret at the insensate bigotry and domineering intolerance which made\r\nthe exposures in County Meath possible. They see in these wild claims\r\nof absolutism in the domain of temporal as well as spiritual affairs,\r\na grave danger to all pure religion. They perceive that the revival of\r\nthe old sectarian passions in Ireland cannot fail to react on Great\r\nBritain, and even if the Keltic priesthood triumphed over the Ulster\r\nProtestants their victory would be a fatal one to all who hold by the\r\nRoman Catholic faith in England. Home Rule would bring misery and\r\ndisaster in its train, and even the Parnellite section of the Irish\r\npeople, who have shaken off clerical domination, tremble at the\r\nprospect of it while nine-tenths of their co-religionists are\r\ndestitute of personal freedom. We must find the solution of Ireland's\r\ndisaffection in another way, and mainly by a bold handling of the\r\nagrarian question, which lies at the root of all. The task before the\r\nUnionist party is not a light one. They must crush the Nationalist\r\nconspiracy, and uproot the fantastic hopes which unscrupulous men have\r\nimplanted in the minds of an ignorant and credulous people. They must\r\nextend the noble system of practical aid to Ireland so successfully\r\ninaugurated by Mr. Balfour in his light railway, fishery, and\r\nagricultural development schemes. And they must mitigate the friction\r\nbetween owners and occupiers of the soil by making it easy and\r\nprofitable for tenants and landlords alike to avail themselves of\r\nBritish credit in terminating a relationship which has been fraught\r\nwith occasions of bitter hostility and mistrust. Under such a policy\r\nwe can see bright prospects of a happy future for the sister island,\r\nbut under the policy of Home Rule we see only the lowering clouds of\r\ncivil war and the dark shadows of reawakened religious animosity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\nNo. 1.--The Spirit of the Capital             Dublin, March 28th     1\r\n\r\nNo. 2.--Panic and Disaster                    Dublin, March 30th     7\r\n\r\nNo. 3.--Ulster's Preparations for War         Belfast, April 1st    13\r\n\r\nNo. 4.--Mr. Balfour's Welcome                 Belfast, April 4th    20\r\n\r\nNo. 5.--Has Mr. Morley Lied?

There can be no doubt of the interest\r\nprevailing in the Irish metropolis. The people are wrought into a\r\nfever-heat of expectancy and intense nervous excitement. Home Rule is\r\nthe only topic of conversation. In hotels, on the steamers, in railway\r\ncarriages, on tramcars, in the market-place, on the steps of the\r\ntemples, at the corners of the streets, in the music halls, the\r\nwondering stranger hears of Home Rule, Home Rule, Home Rule, first,\r\nlast, midst, and without end.\r\n\r\nObviously so much discussion shows difference of opinion, divergency\r\nof conception, conflicting interests. It is borne in upon you that the\r\nIrish people are far from agreed as to what Home Rule means, and that\r\nevery individual has his own pet notion, the various theories\r\ndiffering as widely as the education and social position of their\r\nproposers. But the most striking feature in the attitude of Dublin is\r\nundoubtedly the intense, the deep-rooted, the perfervid hatred of the\r\nbill shown by the better sort of people, the nervous anxiety of the\r\nlaw-abiding classes, the undisguised alarm of everybody who has\r\nanything to lose, whether commercial men, private traders,\r\nmanufacturers, or the representatives of learning and culture. The\r\nmere shadow of Home Rule has already seriously affected stocks and\r\nsecurities, has brought about withdrawal of capital, and is sending\r\nboth English and Irish commercial travellers home empty-handed. Sir\r\nHoward Grubb, maker of the great telescope of the Lick Observatory,\r\nAmerica, an Irishman whose scientific and commercial successes are a\r\nglory to his country, and whose titular honours have been won by sheer\r\nforce of merit, declares that the passing of the Home Rule Bill will\r\nbe the signal heralding his departure to England, with plant and\r\nworking staff, and that he has been preparing for this since 1886. One\r\nof the largest booksellers in the city tells me that, acting in\r\nconjunction with others of the trade, during the last six weeks no\r\norders have been given to English travellers, adding--and thoughtful\r\npeople should find this highly suggestive--\"The Dublin Unionists are\r\nthe people who have the money and the education. The people who have\r\nmoney to spend are becoming excessively careful. They know not what\r\nmay be in store, but they fear that if Home Rule becomes law they will\r\nbe ruined, and more than ninety-five per cent. of my customers are\r\nUnionists.\"\r\n\r\nFurther inquiry confirmed the statement that the book-buying community\r\nare practically Unionists to a man. The same figures hold good among\r\nthe Irish Quakers. Ninety-five per cent. is the proportion given to me\r\nby an eminent Friend, no stranger to Birmingham, intimately known to\r\nAlderman White and three generations of the Cadbury family. He said,\r\n\"Irish Quakers are Unionists, because they are on the spot, because\r\nthey understand the subject, because they know what will follow,\r\nbecause they share the dangers of the threatened revolution. What may\r\nbe the proportion of Home Rulers among the English Friends I do not\r\nknow, but probably the Gladstonians have a majority, for precisely\r\nopposite reasons to those I have stated, that is,--they are not on the\r\nspot, do not understand the matter, are unable to see what will take\r\nplace, and regard themselves as safe, whatever happens.\" The Irish\r\nQuakers have issued a manifesto which should weigh with their English\r\nbrethren and with the country at large. The Quakers know their way\r\nabout. Their piety has not blunted their perceptive faculties, has not\r\ntaken the edge off their keenness. Their reputation for shrewdness is\r\nequal to their reputation for integrity, which is saying a good deal.\r\nWith them the innocence of the dove is happily combined with\r\nconsiderable wisdom of the serpent. And at least ninety-five per cent.\r\nof the Irish Quakers are earnest Unionists.\r\n\r\nBut although the deep concern of the respectable classes of the Irish\r\ncapital is calculated to fill the wandering Englishman with grave\r\nuneasiness, it is not all tragedy. The Dubliners must have their fun,\r\nand, like the Parisians, will sport with matters of heaviest import.\r\nThe poorer classes treat the universal subject lightly, as beseems men\r\nwho have nothing to lose and everything to gain. The prevailing trait\r\nin their mental attitude is incredulousness. You cannot make them\r\nbelieve that the bill will pass. \"We'll get Home Rule when a pair o'\r\nwhite wings sprouts out o' me shoulders an' I fly away like a\r\nblackbird,\" said an old market woman with great emphasis; and a Dublin\r\njackeen, piloting an American over the city, said: \"This, Sorr, is\r\nCollege Green, an' that, Sorr, is Thrinity College, an' that\r\nSorr,\"--here he pointed to the grand pile opposite the College--\"that\r\nSorr, is the grate buildin' in which the Irish Parliament is _not_\r\ngoing to meet!\" At one of the music halls an old woman (Ireland) is\r\nrepresented as buying a coffin for a deceased son named \"Home Rule\"\r\nBill, when the following conversation occurs:--\r\n\r\n\"Is it an oak or an elm coffin ye want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, thin, just a chape deal coffin, shure--wid a few archangels on\r\nthe lid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will ye want any trimmings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah, what d'ye mane by trimmin's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Trimmings for the coffin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad luck to yer trimmin's. What would I want wid them? Sure 'twas\r\n'trimmin's' that kilt him!\"\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that Saxon readers will see this subtle joke when I\r\nexplain that \"delirium\" should come before \"trimmin's.\"\r\n\r\nUnderneath the incredulity of the lower classes--and be it observed\r\nthat their incredulity is obviously based on an instinctive feeling\r\nthat the claims and arguments of their own party are alike\r\npreposterous--underneath this vein of unbelief is a vein of\r\nextraordinary credulity. Poverty is to be at once and for ever\r\nabolished. \"The millions an' millions that John Bull dhrags out iv us,\r\nto kape up his grandeur, an' to pay soldiers to grind us down, we'll\r\nput into our own pockets, av you plaze,\" was the answer vouchsafed to\r\nan inquiry as to what advantages were expected from the passing of the\r\nHome Rule Bill. The speaker was a political barber. Another of the\r\ncraft said, in answer to the same query, \"Well, Sorr, I think we have\r\na right to our indipindence. Sure, we'd be as sthrong as Switzerland\r\nor Belgium.\" A small farmer from the outlying district thought that\r\nrents would be lowered, that money would be advanced to struggling\r\ntenants, that great public works would be instituted, and plainly\r\nintimated that all these good things and many more had been roundly\r\npromised by the Home Rule leaders, and that he, for one, fully\r\nbelieved that all would duly come to pass, once the Bill were carried,\r\nwhich happy event he never expected to see. Every man was to be a kind\r\nof king in his own country, evictions were to be utterly unknown; the\r\npeasantry were to live rent free, under a visionary scheme of which he\r\nhad all the absurd particulars; the old sporting maxim reminding\r\nfarmers that landlord shooting begins on January 1st and ends on\r\nDecember 31st was to become obsolete by reason of a complete\r\nextinction of the species--only an odd one being occasionally dug out\r\nof the bogs along with trunks of bog-oak and skeletons of the great\r\nIrish elk; while the family pig, which, having for ages occupied a\r\nresponsible position in the matter of \"Rint,\" is understood to be an\r\ninveterate landlord-hater, will be released from his delicate\r\nsituation, will be relieved from his harassing anxieties, will no\r\nlonger be sacrificed to the exigencies of the occasion; but, on the\r\ncontrary, will peacefully expire of old age, surrounded by every\r\ntribute of respect. The dirtiest of the Dubliners hold opinions as to\r\nthe marvellous results of Home Rule more adapted to their own\r\npositions and pursuits, but apparently on the same plane, no whit\r\nhigher in the scale of intelligence. They regard the English as their\r\nnatural enemies, and the lower you go the more truculent they become.\r\nOne and all they hold the belief, industriously instilled by\r\nagitators, that the poverty of Ireland is due to the aggrandisement\r\nof England, that the bulk of Irish taxation flows into English\r\ncoffers, and is used for English purposes to the exclusion of Ireland,\r\nand this they have swallowed and insist upon, in defiance of common\r\nreason and the evidence of their senses. The instinct of patriotism is\r\nnot _en évidence_. The dominant passion is cupidity, and nothing\r\nhigher; sheer greed of gain, lust of possession, and nothing nobler.\r\nSelfishness and the hope of plunder are the actuating impulses at the\r\npoll; crass ignorance and bitter prejudice the mental disposition of\r\nthe lower class of voters. Four hours' slumming convinced me of this,\r\nand must convince anyone. \"We'll bate the English into the say,\" said\r\na resident in the sweet region yclept Summer Hill. \"Whin we get the\r\npolice in our hands an' an army of our own, we'd sweep them out o' the\r\ncounthry av we only held cabbage-shtalks. Ireland for the Irish, an'\r\nto hell wid John Bull! Thim's my sintiments.\" And those are the\r\n\"sintiments\" of his class. I have spent days among the Irish Home\r\nRulers without having once heard of the Union of Hearts. The phrase\r\nserves well enough to tickle the simple souls of the long-eared but\r\nshort-headed fraternity of pseudo-philosophical-philanthropists across\r\nthe water, but it has no currency in Ireland.\r\n\r\nLike the country folks the city slummers believe that unheard-of\r\nadvantages would follow the great Bill, and, unconsciously parodying\r\nSancho Panza, say in effect, \"Now blessings light on him who first\r\ninvented Home Rule! it covers a man all over, thoughts and all, like a\r\ncloak; it is meat for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, heat for the\r\ncold, and cold for the hot.\" The bare thought of the coming Paradise\r\nilluminates their dirty visages. Like the lunatic, the lover, and the\r\npoet, they are of imagination all compact, and, unlike the character\r\nmentioned by the Bard, they \"can hold a fire in their hands, By\r\nthinking on the frosty Caucasus, And cloy the hungry edge of appetite\r\nBy bare imagination of a feast; And wallow naked in December snow By\r\nthinking on fantastic summer's heat.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, they lounge about in idleness, hugging their misery,\r\ndiscussing the \"bating\" of the Unionist party, or, as I saw them\r\nyesterday evening, listening to the crooning of an ancient female\r\ngutter-snipe, a dun-coloured heap of decrepit wretchedness, chanting\r\nthe great future of the Irish Parliament in a picturesque and\r\nextraordinary doggerel anent the \"larned reprisintatives of the Oirish\r\nna-a-tion. Promiscu-o-ous they shtand in em-u-la-a-tion.\" The small\r\nshopkeepers, once ardent Nationalists, seem to be changing their\r\nminds. One of them confided to me the fact that he and his fellows,\r\nbrought actually face to face with the possibility that the end of\r\ntheir aspirations and agitations would be attained, were beginning to\r\nask whether, after all, taxation would be remitted, whether indeed the\r\nrates would not be heavier, and whether the moneyed people would\r\nremain in the country at all. Hearing on all sides these and similar\r\nconfessions, accompanied by urgent admonitions of secrecy, you begin\r\nto ask whether the past conduct of these enlightened voters had any\r\nmore substantial basis than a cantankerous and unreasonable\r\ndiscontent, superadded to an Irishman's natural love of fighting. The\r\nleaders of the Separatist party have made the most frantic efforts to\r\nwin over the police, but apparently without much success. The Dublin\r\nconstabulary, a body of 1,300 men, is totally separate and distinct\r\nfrom the Royal Irish Constabulary, but I have reason to believe that\r\nthe feeling of both forces is averse to Home Rule. Said a sergeant\r\nyesterday, \"John Bull may have faults, but,\" and here he winked\r\nexpressively, \"but--he pays!\" Then he went on--\"I am a Westmeath man,\r\na Roman Catholic, an' as good an Irishman as any of thim; an' I'd like\r\nHome Rule if it was local self-government, what they call the gas an'\r\nwather management, or the like of that. But although I've the highest\r\nrespect for my counthry, an' for my counthrymen, I'd like to feel that\r\nmy pay was in better hands, and--what is of more importance--my\r\npension, afther 30 years' service.\"\r\n\r\nHere was a complete lack of confidence, but my friend had more to say.\r\nHe referred to the provisions of the bill, spoke of the six years'\r\narrangement, and on this point exhibited great native shrewdness. \"How\r\ndo we know we'll be employed for six years, once the Irish leaders get\r\nmatters in their own hands? They may promise fairly enough, but they\r\nwould be subject to several influences which might prevint thim kaping\r\ntheir promise. First of all, when they had the power, they would\r\nnaturally like to manage things their own way--an' not to be\r\naltogether bound down so hard an' fast by their engagement with the\r\nEnglish Parliament. Then, although they profess such friendship, they\r\ndon't altogether like us. We may tell them we are Nationalists, an'\r\nthat we're runnin' over with patriotism; but they'll tell us that we\r\nstood by at evictions, an' that we fired on the people at\r\nMitchelstown. But the greatest thing of all is this--all their\r\ncounthry friends, all the terrorisers, the men that mutilated the\r\ncattle, the village ruffians that for years have been doin' their\r\nwork, an' actin' as their spies--all these will have to be provided\r\nfor. The same with our officers, but their case is still worse. They\r\nhave had to pass a regular military examination, which means an\r\nexpensive education. They will get the go-by an' the dirty kick-out,\r\nin order that the friends of the ruling party, who have been so long\r\nin the desert, may be furnished with posts. 'Tis human nature, Sorr.\"\r\nWherefore, the constabulary, it would seem, may be trusted to take\r\ncare of themselves, but the situation is suggestive of serious\r\ncomplications, once the bill were passed. A full private this morning\r\ntold me that without the security of the British Exchequer the force\r\nwould not hold together for four-and-twenty hours, a statement which,\r\nwhatever be its value, is at least an indication of the amount of\r\ntrust which some of the Irish people, and those not the worst\r\ninformed, are disposed to place in the distinguished assembly which,\r\naccording to the authority hereinbefore-mentioned is _not_ to meet on\r\nCollege Green.\r\n\r\nA never-ending complaint which follows you everywhere is the\r\nsupineness of the English electorate. Men whose interests are\r\nseriously threatened, such as the better class of shopkeepers, are\r\nunable to understand the comparative calmness of the British public at\r\nlarge. Passionately they ask why England leaves them to their fate,\r\nand strongly they urge that prompt and decided action should be taken,\r\nif not for the sake of Ireland, then in the interests of England\r\nherself. Disruption, pure and simple, the breaking up of the Empire,\r\nwith panic and general ruin, are in their opinion the sure and certain\r\nconcomitants of the bill now before the House. They declare that\r\nEnglishmen as a whole, whether Gladstonians or Unionists, fail to\r\nrealise the gravity of the situation, and they lose no opportunity of\r\nsaying whenever they hear an English accent, \"WE DON'T WANT IT, WE\r\nDON'T WANT IT!\" Not always do they trouble to say what is the thing\r\nthey so emphatically reject. \"Pardon me, Sir, but are you English?\"\r\nReceiving an affirmative the rejoinder comes at once, and forcefully,\r\n\"We don't want it, we don't want it! Tell the English people that if\r\nthey knew all they would not entertain the idea for a moment.\" The\r\nphrase meets you everywhere, is roared at you in chorus in commercial\r\nrooms, haunts you in your sleep, and, if they would own it, must be\r\npainfully suggestive to Gladstonian visitors. But there are none so\r\nblind as those who will not see, none so deaf as those who will not\r\nhear. It is impossible to withhold sympathy with the indignation and\r\nmental anxiety of these industrious men, who have made Dublin what she\r\nis, and whose only notion of happiness is the fulfilment of duty,\r\ntheir sole means of acquiring wealth or middleclass comfort, hard and\r\nhonest work. That the backbone of the city should stand with their\r\nfortunes subject to the will of a few unscrupulous agitators is\r\nindeed, as they say, an inscrutable dispensation of Providence.\r\n\r\nHelp, however, is at hand. As Hercules hangs backward in their need\r\nthey have determined to help themselves. During the Easter recess both\r\nIreland and England will be made to ring with denunciations of Home\r\nRule, denunciations uttered for the most part by Irishmen. Orators\r\nwill go forth throughout the length and breadth of both islands, with\r\nthe object of laying the truth of the matter before the\r\npeople--demonstrating the dire results which the most intelligent\r\nalmost unanimously predict. There will be no lack of funds--Catholics\r\nand Protestants are subscribing, among the former the grandson of\r\nDaniel O'Connell, the great Liberator of Ireland. Money is literally\r\npouring into the offices of the Irish Unionist Alliance. Little Roman\r\nCatholic Tralee, in the heart of Kerry, one of the most disturbed\r\ndistricts, has sent several hundreds. In three weeks the subscriptions\r\nhave reached £20,000. That ought to be enough to enable Irish\r\nUnionists not, as one said to me, \"to enlighten the English people. We\r\ndo not presume to so much. But we will try to let some of the Darkness\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nDublin, March 28th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 2.--PANIC AND DISASTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation is becoming hourly more serious. The over-excited\r\ncondition of men's minds is rapidly ripening into a panic. The\r\nimpending Second Reading is driving the respectable population of\r\nIreland into absolute despair. The capital is inundated by men from\r\nall parts of the kingdom anxious to know the worst, running hither and\r\nthither, asking whether, even at the eleventh hour, anything may be\r\ndone to avert the dreaded calamity. An eminent solicitor assures me\r\nthat during the last four-and-twenty hours a striking change of\r\nopinion has taken place. Red-hot Home Rulers when confronted with the\r\nlooming actuality are on all sides abandoning their loudly proclaimed\r\npolitical opinions. My friend's business--he is, or has been, an\r\nardent Home Ruler--is chiefly connected with land conveyancing, and he\r\ndeclares that his office is besieged by people anxious to \"withdraw\r\ntheir charges\" on land and house property, that is, to recall their\r\nmoney advanced on mortgage, however profitable the investment, however\r\napparently solid the security. He instanced the case of an estate in\r\nCavan, bearing three mortgages of respectively £1,000, £3,000, and\r\n£4,000, and leaving to the borrower a clear income of £1,700 a year\r\nafter all claims were paid. The three lenders are strenuously\r\nendeavouring to realise, the thousand-pounder being prostrate with\r\naffright, but although the investments under normal conditions would\r\nfetch a good premium, not a penny can be raised in any direction. The\r\nlenders are Home Rulers, and eighty per cent. of the population of\r\nCavan are Roman Catholic.\r\n\r\nThe same story is heard everywhere, with \"damnable iteration.\" The\r\ncause of charity is suffering severely. The building of additions to\r\nthe Rotunda Hospital and the Hospital for Consumptives, at a cost of\r\ntwenty thousand pounds, has been definitely abandoned, although\r\nthree-quarters of the money has been raised. The building trade is at\r\na complete standstill. On every hand contracts are thrown up, great\r\nworks are put aside. Mr. Kane, High Sheriff of Kildare, declines to\r\nproceed with the building of his new mansion, which was to cost many\r\nthousand pounds. Mr. John Jameson, the eminent distiller, who also\r\ncontemplated the construction of a palatial residence, which would\r\ntake years to build, has dropped the idea. The project for the\r\nformation of a great Donegal Oyster-bed Company, which long bade fair\r\nto prosper, and to confer a boon on the starving peasantry of the\r\ncoast, has been cast to the winds. Among the shoals of similar\r\noccurrences which confront you at every turn, some contain an element\r\nalmost of humour. A Dublin architect tells a quaint story of this\r\nkind. It may not be generally known in England that the Roman\r\nCatholics of Ireland can borrow money from John Bull for the erection\r\nof \"glebe-houses,\" at 4 per cent., repayable in 49 years. In a certain\r\nrecent case the priest thought the builder's estimate too high, and,\r\nwithout absolutely declining the contract, intimated that he would\r\n\"wait a while.\" Said the architect, \"Better make up your mind before\r\nJune, or you may have the Irish Legislature to deal with.\" This\r\nargument acted like magic. The good Father instantly saw its cogency,\r\nand, like every other patriotic Nationalist whose personal interest is\r\ninvolved, preferred to place himself in English hands rather than in\r\nthose of his own countrymen, and incontinently accepted the contract,\r\nbegging the architect to proceed with all haste.\r\n\r\nA run on the Post Office Savings Bank threatens to clear out every\r\npenny of Irish money, and why? Because it has dawned on the small\r\nhoarders, the thrifty and industrious members of the lower classes,\r\nthat the Post Office is to be transferred to the Irish Legislature. A\r\nfriend tells me that yesterday his Catholic cook begged for an\r\ninterview. She had money in the Post Office Savings Bank, and\r\nthereanent required advice, asking if it would be safe till to-morrow!\r\nFollowing up this hint, pregnant with meaning, though delivered in\r\njest, I found that the feeling of insecurity is spreading like wild\r\nfire, to the intense indignation of those patriots who have no\r\nsavings, and who are alive to the fact that under the provisions of\r\nthe proposed Act the four millions supposed to be lying in the Post\r\nOffice Savings Bank would constitute the entire working capital, as\r\ndistinguished from current income, of the College Green Legislature.\r\nThe master of a small sub-office told me that the withdrawals at his\r\nlittle place amounted to £200 per week, rising latterly to £70 per\r\nday, and that it was necessary to get money from London to meet the\r\ndemands. Concurrently with this I learn that the Dublin Savings Bank,\r\nan institution managed by merchants of the city, for the encouragement\r\nof thrift, is receiving the money so withdrawn, and this confidence is\r\nexplained by the well-known fact that the directors have publicly\r\ndeclared that on the passing of the Home Rule Bill they will pay 20s.\r\nin the pound and close the bank, in addition to which significant\r\nultimatum they have, in writing, declared to Mr. Gladstone, that this\r\ncourse of action is due to the fact that they repudiate the security\r\nof the proposed Irish Legislature. To put the thing in a nutshell it\r\nmay be said that not a single Irishman in or out of the country is\r\nwilling to trust the Irish Legislature with a single penny of his own\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nA curious feature of the Nationalist character is the profound\r\ncontempt expressed for Nationalist M.P.'s. Englishmen are accustomed\r\nto speak of their own members, representing their own opinions, with\r\nrespect. Not so in Dublin. A rabid Nationalist said to me, \"I am an\r\nIrishman to the backbone. I am a Home Ruler out-and-out. But do you\r\nthink I'd trust my property with either of the two Tims? Do you think\r\nsuch men as Tim Harrington and Tim Healy are fit to be trusted with\r\nthe spending of 2-1/2 millions of money per annum? They have their\r\njob, and they work well at their job, and the Irish people have backed\r\nthem up out of pure divilment. 'Tis mighty fine to take a rise out of\r\nJohn Bull, to harass him, to worry him, to badger him out of his seven\r\nsinses. The half of the voters never were serious, or voted as they\r\nwere told by men who expatiated on the wrongs which have been dinned\r\ninto them from infancy. But to trust these orators with their money!\r\nBedad, we're not all out such omadhauns (idiots) as that! Paddy is not\r\naltogether such a fool as he looks.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough public feeling has suddenly deepened in intensity, the change\r\nhas been for some time in progress. I am enabled to state on\r\nirrefragable authority, that Lord Houghton's sudden departure from\r\nDublin on Sunday week was entirely due to his alarm at the shifting\r\naspect of affairs, which rendered instant conference with Mr.\r\nGladstone a matter of urgent necessity. And it should be especially\r\nnoted that this change is most apparent not in the Protestant North,\r\nnot among the irreconcilable black and heretic Ulsterites, but in\r\nNationalist Dublin, in the Roman Catholic south--not simply among the\r\nmoneyed classes and well-to-do shopkeepers of Dublin, but among the\r\nindustrious poor, and the small farmers of the region round about. The\r\nopinions and feelings of the better classes have ever been dead\r\nagainst the Bill, and the best portion of the poorer people are\r\nassuredly moving in the same direction. That such is the simple fact\r\nis undeniable. It is thrust upon you whether you will or no. You are\r\ncompelled to believe it, whatever your political creed. It manifests\r\nitself in a variety of ways. Mr. Love, of Kildare, a landed\r\nproprietor, now in Dublin, says that on Sunday last Dr. Gowing, parish\r\npriest of Kill, denounced Home Rule from the altar, and advised the\r\npeople to have none of it.\r\n\r\nThe Dubliners are beginning to publicly ridicule their Nationalist\r\nmembers. A bog-oak carving represents a typical Irishman driving a\r\n\"conthrairy pig,\" which is supposed to stand for Tim Harrington. The\r\ninteresting animal is deviating from the right way, gazing fixedly at a\r\nmilestone which bears the legend, \"IX. miles to College Green.\" His\r\nmaster gives him a cut of the whip and a jerk of the rope, and thus\r\naddresses the wayward Tim, \"Arrah, don't be wastin' yer larnin', radin'\r\nmilestones. Ye're not goin' to Dublin--ye're goin' to BRAY!\" A Phoenix\r\nPark orator who sang amusing songs finished his appeal for coppers\r\nthus, \"Sure, Home Rule is a splindid thing--an iligant thing intirely,\r\nan' a blind man could see the goodness iv it wid his two eyes. Didn't\r\nye all know Tim Harrington whin he hadn't the price iv his breakfast?\r\nDidn't ye know him whin he would dhrop on his two marrowbones and thank\r\nGod for the price of a shmell of calamity-wather\" (whiskey). \"An' now\r\nlook at him! D'ye mind the iligant property he has outside Dublin? An\r\nye'll all get the like o' that, every bosthoon among yez, av ye get\r\nHome Rule. But yez must sind _me_ to Parlimint. Sure I have ivery\r\nquollification. Wasn't I born among yez? Wasn't I rared among yez?\r\nDon't I know what yez wants? An' didn't I go many a day widout a male?\r\nAye, that I did, an' could do it again! Sind _me_ to Parlimint, till I\r\nget within whisperin' distance of Misther Gladstone--within whisperin'\r\ndistance, d'ye mind me? Ye'll all get lashins of dhrink, an' free\r\nquarthers at the Castle. An' all ye have to do is to pay me, an' pay me\r\nwell.\" Here the speaker laid his finger along his nose and broke into a\r\ncomic song having reference to \"the broad Atlantic,\" which he chanted\r\nin a brogue almost as broad as the Atlantic itself.\r\n\r\nThe better class of vacillating Nationalists are ready to give a\r\nplausible reason for the faith that is in them. You cannot catch an\r\nIrish Home Ruler napping, nor will he admit that he was ever wrong. He\r\nwill talk to the average Englishman about Irish rights and Irish\r\nwrongs, Irish virtues and Irish abstinence from crime with a reckless\r\ndisregard for truth that can only be born of a firm belief that Irish\r\nnewspapers are never read outside Ireland, and will then walk off and\r\nplume himself on the assumption that because he met no point-blank\r\ncontradiction he has duped his victim into believing the most absurd\r\nmass of wild misinformation that was ever crammed down the throats of\r\nthe most gullible of his rustic countrymen. It must be admitted that\r\nthey are shrewd critics of the Bill, of which every individual\r\ncitizen, whatever his conviction, has an annotated copy in his\r\ntail-pocket. The Dublin change of front is ascribed to the \"insulting\r\nmanner in which the Bill is drafted.\" The Nationalists, one and all,\r\nroundly declare, in terms which admit of no qualification, that the\r\npresent bill means no less than separation, and while admitting that\r\nthis is their dearest aspiration, declare that England will only have\r\nherself to thank. They complain that the word \"Parliament\" is never\r\nused in the Bill when referring to the Irish Legislature, but console\r\nthemselves with the reflection that the supremacy of Parliament proper\r\nis only mentioned in the preamble, which they rejoice to believe is\r\nnot part of the bill, and therefore is not binding in law. The\r\nTreasury clauses they declare to have been drawn by a deadly enemy of\r\nIreland, but here again they find salvation in the alleged\r\ninconsistency of the various provisions of the bill.\r\n\r\nThey accept with exceeding great joy the provision which will enable\r\nthem to deprive of their property, rights, and privileges all existing\r\nCorporations whether incorporated under Royal Charter or otherwise,\r\npointing out that this means ownership and control of the Bank of\r\nIreland, Trinity College, and all the churches and cathedrals, which\r\nhereafter are to be wrested from Protestant hands and devoted to the\r\npropagandism of the Roman Catholic faith; and that the Bill confers\r\nthese powers is, they say, made clearly evident by the clause that\r\nplaces these matters in the hands of an executive \"directed by Irish\r\nAct.\" By virtue of his position they have already nominated Archbishop\r\nWalsh on this executive, with other ecclesiastics of like kidney. This\r\nthey admit is a good mouthful, but they scornfully assert that while\r\nMr. Gladstone has left them income-tax to pay, he has also loaded them\r\nwith the Post Office, a Greek gift, which under the best English\r\nmanagement is worked at a loss of fifty thousand pounds a year! The\r\ntwo Home Rulers who in my hearing so ruthlessly dissected the Bill\r\nmade merry over the clause which excludes the Irish Government from\r\nall control of the \"foreign mails or submarine telegraphs or\r\nthrough-lines in connection therewith,\" pouring on the unhappy\r\nsentence whole cataracts of ridicule. \"We have the thing in our hands,\r\nand we are not to control its working,\" said they. \"The cable between\r\nEngland and America passes through Ireland, will be worked by our\r\nservants, by people who will look to us as their paymasters, and we\r\nare to have no control!\" The preposterous absurdity of the notion\r\ntickled the entire company. \"But if England does not please us, can we\r\nnot cut the cable? Can we not order our own paid servants to cease\r\ntransmitting messages, or to transmit only such as have survived the\r\ninspection of the accredited officials of the Irish people?\" It was\r\nthought that this was reasonable and a possible, nay a probable\r\nconjuncture, and might be used as a weapon to damage English trade.\r\n\"Let them go round or lay another cable,\" said one patriot.\r\n\r\nThis sort of discussion, more or less reasonable, is everywhere heard,\r\nand should be of some value in indicating the use Irishmen expect to\r\nmake of the Act. Not a single friendly syllable, not a word of\r\namicable fellowship with England, not a scintilla of gratitude for\r\nfavours past or to come, nothing but undisguised animosity, and a\r\nfixed resolution to make every clause of the Act a battlefield. I\r\nspeak that I do know and testify that I have seen. My personal\r\nrelations with the Irish people have been and continue to be of the\r\nmost gratifying kind. In the homes of the highest, in the great\r\nmanufactories, even in the lowest slums I have seen much that is\r\nattractive in the Irish character--much that excites warm interest,\r\nand is calculated to attach you to the people. I have conversed with\r\nscores of Home Rulers of all shades, and to the query as to whether\r\nultimate separation is hoped for, I have received an invariable\r\naffirmative. True it is that the answer varied in terms from the blunt\r\n\"Yes\" of the uncompromising man to the more or less veiled assent of\r\nthe more cautious, but the result was in substance ever the same. Talk\r\nabout the Union of Hearts, the pacification of Ireland, the brotherly\r\nlove that is to ensue, and the Unionists turn away with undissembled\r\nimpatience, the Home Rulers with a chuckle and a sneer. As well tell\r\nreasonable Irishmen that the world is flat, or that a straight line\r\nbetween two given points is the longest, or that the sun moves round\r\nthe moon, or any other inane absurdity contrary to the evidence of\r\nscience and their senses. The English Gladstonians who babble about\r\nbrotherly love and conciliation should move about Dublin in disguise.\r\nDisguise would in their case be necessary to get at the truth, for\r\nPaddy is a shrewd trickster, and delights in humbugging this species\r\nof visitor, whom he calls \"the slobbering Saxon.\" Then if they would\r\nreturn and still vote for Home Rule they are no less than traitors to\r\ntheir country and enemies to their fellow-country men.\r\n\r\nThe weather is very fine, and the fashionable resorts are fairly well\r\nfrequented, but trade daily grows worse. Wholesale houses, says a high\r\nauthority, are \"not dull, but stone dead.\" The pious Irish fast and\r\npray during the week, and the great Roman Catholic Retreat at Milltown\r\nis crowded to the limits of its accommodation. The ladies wear a kind\r\nof half-mourning, a stylish sort of reminder of original sin.\r\nSackcloth and ashes in Catholic Dublin consist of fetching brown,\r\ngrey, or tan costumes, set off with huge bunches of fragrant violets,\r\ntied with a bow the exact shade of the flower, or a dull shade of\r\npurple, a sort of Lenten lugubriousness particularly becoming to\r\nblonde penitents. The ladies are indefatigable in their efforts\r\nagainst Home Rule, and one distinguished canvasser for signatures to\r\nthe Roman Catholic petition has been warned by the police, as she\r\nvalues her life, to leave Dublin for a time. The ruffian class,\r\nneedless to say, has undergone no change, but still demands the bill,\r\nand this delicate lady, for years foremost in every good and\r\ncharitable work, is driven from her home by threatening letters--that\r\naccursed resort to anonymous intimidation which so discredits the\r\nIrish claim to superior courage and chivalry. The Catholics of Dublin\r\nare signing numerously, but the number of signatories by no means\r\nrepresents the opponents of the Bill.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen cannot be brought to realise for one moment the system of\r\nterrorism and intimidation which prevails even in the very heart of\r\nthe capital. Parnellite spies are everywhere and know everything, and\r\nwoe to the helpless man who dares to have a mind of his own. And not\r\nonly are the poor coerced and deprived of the liberty of the subject,\r\nbut the wealthiest manufacturers--men whose firms are of the greatest\r\nmagnitude--will caution you against using their names in connection\r\nwith anything that could give a clue to their real sentiments. This\r\ndifficulty arises everywhere and information can only be extracted\r\nafter a promise that its source shall never be disclosed. The priests\r\nare credited with unheard-of influence among the poor. \"At the present\r\nmoment the ruffians are held in leash. The order has gone forth that\r\npending the Home Rule debate they are to 'be good.' But if I sign that\r\npetition, although here in Dublin, the thing would be known at Tralee,\r\n200 miles away, before I reached home--and a hundred to one that the\r\nfirst blackguard that passed would put a match in my thatch, would\r\nburn my stacks, would hough or mutilate my cattle.\" The speaker was a\r\nRoman Catholic farmer from Kerry. Mr. Morley, in stating that the\r\nprosecution of the Rev. Robert Eager had ceased and determined, was\r\nutterly wrong. The rector's cousin, Mr. W.J. Eager, also of Tralee,\r\ntold me that threatening letters with coffins and cross-bones were\r\nstill pouring in in profusion. Mr. Eager was calmly requested to give\r\nup land which he had held for 15 years to a man who had previously\r\nrented it, and as the good parson failed to see the force of this\r\nargument he is threatened with a violent death. In England such a\r\nthing could only happen in a pantomime, but some of the Irish think it\r\nthe quintessence of reasonable action. These are the class that\r\nsupport the Bill; these are the men Mr. Gladstone and his\r\nconglomeration of cranks and faddists hope to satisfy. A brilliant\r\nkind of prospect for poor John Bull.\r\n\r\nMr. John Morley should accompany me in my peregrinations among the\r\nintelligent voters who have placed him and his great chief in power,\r\nalong with the galaxy of minor stars which rise with the Grand Man's\r\nrising and set at his setting. \"The British Government won't allow us\r\nto work the gold mines in the Wicklow mountains. Whin we get the Bill\r\nevery man can take a shpade, an' begorra! can dig what he wants.\" \"The\r\nPhaynix Park is all cramfull o' coal that the Castle folks won't allow\r\nus to dig, bad scran to them. Whin we get the Bill wu'll sink thim\r\nmines an' send the Castle to Blazes.\" But the quaintest, the funniest,\r\nthe most sweetly ingenuous of the lot was the reason given by a\r\ngentleman of patriarchal age and powerful odour, whom I encountered in\r\nHamilton's Lane. He said, \"Ye see, Sorr, this is the way iv it. 'Tis\r\nthe Americans we'll look to, by raison that they're mostly our own\r\nfolks. They're powerful big invintors, but bedad, they haven't the\r\nwather power to work the invintions. Now _we_ have the wather power,\r\nan' the invintions 'll be brought over here to be worked. An' that'll\r\ngive the poor folks imploymint.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor man's ignorance was doubtless dense, his credulity amusing,\r\nhis childlike simplicity interesting. But the darkness of his\r\nignorance was no blacker, the extent of his credulity no more amazing,\r\nthan the ignorance and credulity of English Gladstonian speakers, who,\r\nwith a Primitive Methodist accent and a Salvation Army voice,\r\nproclaim, with a Bible twang, their conviction that Home Rule means\r\nthe friendship of Ireland.\r\n\r\nDublin, March 30th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 3.--ULSTER'S PREPARATIONS FOR WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nUlster will fight, and fight to the death. The people have taken a\r\nresolution--deep, stern, and irrevocable. Outwardly they do not seem\r\nso troubled as the Dubliners. They are quiet in their movements,\r\nmoderate in their speech. They show no kind of alarm, for they know\r\ntheir own strength, and are fully prepared for the worst. They speak\r\nand act like men whose minds are made up, who will use every\r\nConstitutional means of maintaining their freedom, and, these failing,\r\nwill take the matter in their own strong hands. Meanwhile they\r\npreserve external calm, and systematically make their arrangements. If\r\never they went through a talking stage, that is now over. They have\r\npassed the time of discussion, and are preparing for action. If ever\r\nthey showed heat, that period also is past. They have reached the cold\r\nstage, in which men act on ascertained principles and not in the\r\nfrenzy of passion. There is nothing hysterical about the Belfast men.\r\nThey are by no means the kind of people who run hither and thither\r\nwringing their hands. Neither are they men who will sit down under\r\noppression. And oppression is what they expect from a Dublin\r\nGovernment. Mr. Gladstone and his tribe may pooh-pooh this notion, but\r\nthe feeling in Ulster is strong and immovable. The tens of thousands\r\nof Protestants thickly scattered over other provinces feel more\r\nstrongly still; as well they may, for they have not the numbers, the\r\norganisation, the unity which is strength, that characterise the\r\nprovince of Ulster. They hold that Home Rule is at the bottom a\r\nreligious movement, that by circuitous methods, and subterranean\r\nstrategy, the religious re-conquest of the island is sought; that the\r\nignorant peasantry, composing the large majority of the electorate,\r\nare entirely in the hands of the priests, and that these black swarms\r\nof Papists have a congenital hatred of England, which must bring about\r\nseparation. These are the opinions of thousands of eminent men whose\r\nability is beyond argument, who have lived all their lives on the\r\nspot, who from childhood have had innumerable facilities for knowing\r\nthe truth, whose interests are bound up with the prosperity of\r\nIreland, and who, on every ground, are admittedly the best judges.\r\nSaid Mr. Albert Quill, the Dublin barrister:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone, who in eighty-four years has spent a week in Ireland,\r\nputs aside Sir Edward Harland, who has built a fleet of great ships in\r\nan Irish port, and sneers at the opinion of the Belfast deputation who\r\nhave lived all their lives in Ireland.\" A Roman Catholic Unionist, an\r\neminent physician, said to me:--\r\n\r\n\"I fear that Catholicism would ultimately lose by the change, although\r\nat first it would undoubtedly obtain a strong ascendant. The bulk of\r\nthe Irish Catholics have a deep animosity to the English people, whom\r\nthey regard as heretics, and the Protestants of Ireland would in\r\nself-defence be compelled to band themselves together, for underneath\r\nthe specious surface of the Home Rule movement are the teeth and claws\r\nof the tiger. Persecution would follow separation, which is inevitable\r\nif the present bill be carried. A Dublin Parliament would make a\r\nProtestant's life a burden. This would react in time, and Catholicism\r\nwould suffer in the long run. And for this reason, amongst others, I\r\nam against Home Rule.\"\r\n\r\nBut what are the Belfast men doing? _Imprimis_ they are working in\r\nwhat may be called the regular English methods. Unionist clubs are\r\nspringing up in all directions. The Earl of Ranfurly opened three in\r\none evening, and others spring up almost every day. The Ulster\r\nAnti-Repeal and Loyalist Association will during the month of April\r\nhold over three hundred meetings in England, all manned by competent\r\nspeakers. The Irish Unionist Association and the Conservative\r\nAssociation are likewise doing excellent work, which is patent to\r\neverybody. But other associations which do not need public offices are\r\nflourishing like green bay trees, and their work is eminently\r\nsuggestive. By virtue of an all-powerful introduction, I yesterday\r\nvisited what may be called the Ulster war department, and there saw\r\nregular preparation for an open campaign, the preliminaries for which\r\nare under eminently able superintendence. The tables are covered with\r\ndocuments connected with the sale and purchase of rifles and munitions\r\nof war. One of them sets forth the particulars of a German offer of\r\n245,000 Mauser rifles, the arm last discarded by the Prussian\r\nGovernment, with 50,000,000 cartridges. As the first 150,000 Mausers\r\nwere manufactured by the National Arms and Ammunition Company,\r\nSparkbrook, Birmingham, it may be interesting to record that the\r\nquoted price was 16s. each, the cartridges being thrown in for\r\nnothing. Another offer referred to 149,000 stand of arms, with\r\n30,000,000 cartridges. A third document, the aspect of which to a\r\nnative of Brum was like rivers of water in a thirsty land, was said to\r\nhave been summarily set aside by reason of the comparative antiquity\r\nof the excellent weapon offered, notwithstanding the tempting lowness\r\nof the quoted price.\r\n\r\nA novel and unexpected accession of information was the revelation of\r\na deep and sincere sympathy among the working men of England, who,\r\nwith gentlemen of position and rifle volunteers by hundreds and\r\nthousands, are offering their services in the field, should civil war\r\nensue. The letters were shown to me, all carefully filed, and\r\nsufficient liberty was permitted to enable me to be satisfied as to\r\nthe tenour of their contents. Among the more important was a short\r\nnote from a distinguished personage, offering a contribution of £500,\r\nwith his guarantee of a force of two hundred men. This also was from\r\nEngland, a fact which the scoffers at Ulster will do well to read,\r\nmark, learn, and inwardly digest. The guarantee fund for the first\r\ncampaign now amounts to nearly a million and a half, which the best\r\nfinancial authority of Belfast tells me is \"as good as the Bank of\r\nEngland.\" What the Dublin police-sergeant said of John Bull may also\r\nbe said of the Ulsterman--\"He may have faults, but--he Pays!\" Funds\r\nfor current purposes are readily forthcoming, £50,000 being already in\r\nhand, while promises of a whole year's income seem thick as autumnal\r\nleaves in Vallombrosa. No means is left untried, no stone is left\r\nunturned to render abortive what the dry and caustic Northerners call\r\nthe Home Ruin Bill, or the Bill for the _Bitter_ Government of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nMoving hourly among people accurately and minutely acquainted with the\r\nlocal position, you cannot fail to be struck by the marvellous\r\nunanimity with which all Irish Unionists predict the exact result of\r\nsuch a bill as constitutes the present bone of contention, and their\r\nprecise agreement as to concerted action should the crisis arise. They\r\nridicule the English notion that they intend to take the field at\r\nonce. Nothing of the kind. They will await the imposition of taxes by\r\na Dublin Parliament, and will steadfastly refuse to pay. The money\r\nmust then be collected by force of arms, that is, by the Royal Irish\r\nConstabulary, who will be met by men who under their very noses are\r\nnow becoming expert in battalion drill, having mastered company drill,\r\nwith manual and firing exercise; and whose numbers--I love to be\r\nparticular--amount to the respectable total of one hundred and\r\nsixty-four thousand six hundred and fourteen, all duly enrolled and\r\npledged to act together anywhere and at any time, most of them already\r\nwell armed, and the remainder about to be furnished with splendid and\r\neffective weapons, which before this appears in print will have been\r\nlanded from a specially chartered steamer, and instantly distributed\r\nfrom a spot I am forbidden to indicate, by an organisation specially\r\ncreated for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAll these particulars--and more--were furnished by gentlemen of high\r\nposition and unimpeachable integrity, whose statements, of themselves\r\nsufficient, were abundantly confirmed by the exhibition under\r\nrestrictive pledges, of undeniable documentary proofs, with partial\r\nbut satisfactory glimpses of the work actually in hand. No vapouring\r\nhere, no breathless haste, not a suspicion of excitement. Nothing but\r\na cold, emotionless, methodical, business-like precision, a\r\nwell-considered series of commercial transactions, conducted by men\r\nspecially acquainted with the articles required and regularly trained\r\nto office routine. English Home Rulers, unable to see a yard in front\r\nof them, whose training and instincts are of the goody-goody, milk and\r\nwater type,--the lily-livered weaklings, who measure the courage of\r\nothers by their own,--may be excused their inability to conceive the\r\nsituation. They cannot understand the dour, unyielding spirit of the\r\nUlsterman in a matter which affects his property, his religion, his\r\nfreedom. A party backboneless as the Globerigina ooze, and, like that\r\nsub-Atlantic production, only held together by its own sliminess, must\r\never fail to realise the grit which means resistance, sacrifice,\r\nendurance; cannot grasp the outlines of the Ulster character and\r\nspirit, which resemble those which actuated the Scottish Covenanters,\r\nthe Puritan army of Cromwell, or even--and this illustration should be\r\nespecially grateful to Gladstonians--the Dutch Boers of the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nBut although the surface is placid the depths are turbulent. If Dublin\r\nis simmering, Belfast is boiling. The breed is different. The\r\nNortherner is not demonstrative, is slow to anger, but being moved is\r\nnot easily appeased. The typical Irishman, with his cutaway coat, his\r\npipe stuck in his conical caubeen, his \"sprig of shillelagh,\" or\r\nbludgeon the Donnybrook Fair hero who \"shpinds half a-crown, Mates wid\r\na frind An' (for love) knocks him down\" is totally unknown in these\r\nregions. The men who by their ability and industry have lifted Ireland\r\nout of the slough, given her prosperity and comparative affluence,\r\nmarched hand in hand with the English people, have only seen, with\r\nwonder, the rollicking Kelt, devoid of care, forethought, and\r\nresponsibility, during their trips to the South and West--or wherever\r\nHome Rulers most do congregate. Strange it is, but perfectly true,\r\nthat in most cases an Irishman's politics may be determined by outward\r\nand visible signs, so plain that he who runs may read. In Dundalk,\r\nwhich should be a thriving port, you see in and around the town long\r\nrows of low thatch-covered cabins, with putrid dunghills\r\n\"convaynient,\" dirty, half-fed, barefooted children, and--magnificent\r\nCatholic churches. Home Rule rules the roost. As you move northwards,\r\nthe symptoms of poverty gradually disappear. Scarva, the annual\r\nmeeting ground of 5,000 to 10,000 Orangemen, who on July 13, the day\r\nafter the anniversary of the battle of the Boyne, fight the battle\r\no'er again, with a King William and a King James, mounted respectively\r\non their regulation white and bay chargers--Scarva is neat, clean and\r\ncivilised. Bessbrook, the Quaker colony, is, as might be expected, a\r\nmodel community. Lurgan is well built, smart, trim, and delightful, a\r\nwealthy manufacturing place with the general aspect of Leamington. As\r\nthe train steamed into the station an American traveller took a\r\ngeneral survey of the district, and said to the general company--\r\n\r\n\"I reckon this is a Unionist place.\"\r\n\r\nA fierce-looking man from Dundalk admitted the soft impeachment.\r\n\r\n\"Thought so. Can spot a Home Rule town far off as I can see it. Mud\r\nhuts, whitewashed cabins with no upstairs, muck-heaps, and bad fences.\r\nCan spot a Home Ruler as far as I can see him. Darned if I couldn't\r\ntrack him by scent, like a foxhound. That's the rank and file--very\r\nrank, I should say, most of them. And old J. Bull concludes to let the\r\ndunghill folks, powerful lazy beggars they seem, come top-sawyer over\r\nthe fellows that built a place like this, eh?\"\r\n\r\nThe Newry man, taking off his hat, revealing a head of hair like a\r\ndisorderly halo, took from the lining a little paper which called upon\r\nthe Irish peasantry to remember their wrongs, referred to the time\r\nwhen Englishmen could murder Irishmen with impunity, stated that the\r\nthing had often been done, and called upon every male from fifteen to\r\nfifty to enrol himself in the Irish Independent Army--referring to the\r\nProtestants as \"a cruel and bloody minority.\" The Yankee returned the\r\nbill contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"You think this a question of counting noses. Now, I'm a sympathiser\r\nof Home Rule, but if I was J.B. it would be different. I'm hanged if I\r\nwould not stick to my clean, clever, faithful friends, though they\r\nwere outnumbered by twenty to one. An' I'm a Republican, mind ye that.\r\nYe might ask me to put the muck-heap men at the head of affairs--ye\r\nmight ask till doomsday, but ye'd never get it. An' any man's a fool\r\nthat would do it.\"\r\n\r\nA placard announcing the formation of an Irish Army of Independence,\r\nand calling on the people to enrol themselves, has been extensively\r\ncirculated, and it is said that the Roman Catholics, like the\r\nProtestants, are industriously drilling, north, south, east and west.\r\nI am careful to use the term Protestants, as the force available is\r\ndrawn from the general body of Nonconformists. Orangemen are members\r\nof the Church of Ireland, and have always been regarded as\r\nConservative. On the contrary, Presbyterians and Methodists are\r\nconsidered to be advanced Liberals, and herein lies a popular English\r\nfallacy--Gladstonians often refer to the Orange agitation against the\r\ndisestablishment of the Irish Church, which they would fain compare\r\nwith the present opposition to Home Rule, forgetting or ignoring the\r\nfact that the strength of Ulster resides in the Nonconformist bodies,\r\nand that these were all in favour of disestablishment, leaving the\r\nOrangemen in a hopeless minority. Now, however, the Nonconformists\r\nhave joined their forces with those of the Orange bodies, which\r\ncreates a very different aspect of affairs. The English Home Rulers\r\nsay the opposition will end in smoke. It is said that the most insane\r\nare sometimes wiser than they dream, just as liars sometimes speak\r\ntruth by accident. The movement will end in smoke, but it will be the\r\nsmoke of battle. Every man who supports the Home Rule Bill incurs the\r\nstigma of blood-guiltiness. The bill that succeeds Home Rule will be\r\nthe Butchers' Bill. No doubt Mr. Gladstone will explain away the\r\n\"painful occurrences which we all deplore,\" and will endeavour to\r\ntransfer the blame to other shoulders. His talent for explanation is\r\nunapproachable, but unhappily he cannot explain the slain to life\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIn a former letter I pointed out how cleverly the Nationalists dissect\r\nthe bill, how they point out that its proposals are insulting to\r\nIreland, how they prove that its provisions are inconsistent and\r\nunworkable, how they propose to discount the trumpery restrictions and\r\nthe gimcrack \"safeguards\" of the proposed measure, how in short, they\r\ntear the bill to rags, laugh its powers to scorn, and hold its authors\r\nin high derision. The Belfast men do not discuss the bill, do not\r\nexamine it clause by clause, do not quibble over the purport of this\r\nor the probable effect of that, do not ask how the customs are to be\r\ncollected, or who is to pay for this, that, or the other. They descend\r\nto no details, enter into no particulars, point out no minor\r\nfallacies, argue no questions of the ultimate effect of any one\r\nsection of the bill. They reject the measure as a whole. The principle\r\nis bad, radically rotten, and cannot be amended. With the Home Rulers\r\nthey agree that the bill means Separation, and therefore they put it\r\naway _en bloc_. They will have no part with the unclean thing, but\r\ncast it to the winds, bundle it out neck and crop, kick it downstairs,\r\ntreat it with immeasurable contempt. They are well versed in the broad\r\nprinciples of Constitutional law, as it at present exists; will tell\r\nyou that the Irish Constabulary is the only force that can be brought\r\nagainst them for the collection of the taxes, which they will\r\nabsolutely refuse; declare that the military can only be used against\r\nthem for this purpose by Act of Parliament; cite the preamble of the\r\nArmy Bill, which shows that there is no standing army, but only a\r\nforce renewed in its functions from year to year; show that the\r\nmonarch has ceased to be generalissimo of the British troops since\r\nsuch a year, refer to the sad case of Charles I., who would fain have\r\ncollected Ship-money from a certain John Hampden, and endeavoured to\r\nuse the English army for this laudable purpose, meeting a fate at once\r\nhorrible and instructive. Then comes the application. Similar causes,\r\nsay they, will bring about similar effects, and if the quality and\r\ntemper of the people be considered their arguments seem reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe Irish army of Independence is already a subject of mockery. \"Ten\r\nof our men would make a hundred of them run like hares. On the 27th\r\nult. a party of Orangemen were fired upon near Stewartstown, and\r\nalthough unarmed they stormed the hill whence came the shots, while\r\nthe heroic riflemen who had fired 14 bullets, luckily without effect,\r\nshowed that if too cowardly to fight, they were not too lazy to run.\"\r\nThis occurrence, of which I had the description from authority, would\r\nhave excited some attention in England, but here it is lightly passed\r\nover as nothing exceptional. \"We are holding back our men. The other\r\nparty are egging us on to outbreak, in the hope that our cause will be\r\ndiscredited, and that Lord Salisbury's visit in May might be\r\nhindered.\" There is a mutual repugnance between the two peoples, but\r\nthe character of the repulsion is different. The Roman Catholics\r\nmanifest an unmistakable hatred--the term is no whit too strong--a\r\nhatred of the social and intellectual superiority of their\r\nfellow-countrymen, who in turn look upon the Catholics (as a whole)\r\nwith mistrust, mingled with contempt. As well ask Brother Jonathan to\r\nsubmit to the rule of the negro, as well ask the London trader to put\r\nhis interests in the hands of a Seven Dials' syndicate, as well ask\r\nMr. Gladstone and his followers to listen to reason or to talk common\r\nsense, as to expect the powerful and influential Protestants of\r\nBelfast and Ulster generally to entrust their future to a Legislature\r\nelected by the most illiterate electorate in the three kingdoms, and\r\nunder the thumb of the priests--who wield a despotic power which\r\npeople in England cannot be made to understand. A short time ago the\r\nDublin Freemasons held a bazaar in aid of a charity whose object was\r\nthe complete care of orphan children. The Catholic Archbishop\r\nimmediately fulminated a decree that whosoever patronised the show\r\nwould incur the terrors of the church, which means that they would\r\nperish everlastingly. Some poor folks, servant girls and porters and\r\nthe like, who were sent by their mistresses or called by their honest\r\navocations, dared to enter the accursed precincts, and emerging alive,\r\nrushed to confession, that the leprosy of Masonic charity might be\r\nwashed from their souls by absolution.\r\n\r\nAbsolution was refused. The wretched outcasts were referred to the\r\nBishop, who in this dire emergency had sole power to unlock the gates\r\nof heaven. Do English people know what an Irish Catholic feels when\r\nrefused absolution? I trow not, and that therefore they cannot justly\r\nestimate the power of the priests. Another illustration. A friend of\r\nmine made some purchases and sent a man for them, one of five hundred\r\nCatholics in his employ. The poor fellow halted two hundred yards from\r\nthe contaminating circle, and by the aid of a policeman, got the\r\nparcel brought to him--without risking his immortal soul.\r\n\r\nThe bazaar realised twenty-two thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nThe Ireland of the harp and vesper bell, free from the dominion of\r\nEngland, having the prestige of an independent Catholic State, the\r\nIreland of excommunication by bell, book, and candle, the Ireland of\r\nthe priest and Pope--that, and no other, according to Ulstermen, is\r\nthe ultimate end of Home Rule. They will have none of it, their\r\ndetermination is announced, and they will stand by what they say. From\r\nwhat I have seen and heard I am convinced that Ulster means business,\r\nand also has the power to win. The Irish Unionists are worthy\r\nco-partners in the great fight, and Englishmen should stand with them\r\nshoulder to shoulder. But with or without English aid, Ulster may be\r\ntrusted to hold its own.\r\n\r\nBelfast, April 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 4.--MR. BALFOUR'S WELCOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nArriving in the northern capital from Dublin you are apt to experience\r\na kind of chill, akin to that felt by the boy of easy-going parents\r\nwho, visiting the house of a staid and sober uncle, said to his little\r\ncousins, \"At home we can fight with pillows, and let off crackers in\r\nthe kitchen, and ride on the poker and tongs across the dining-room\r\ntables, and shy oranges at the chimney ornaments, and cut the sofas\r\nand pull out the stuffing, but here we get no fun at all!\" The\r\neffervescence of the sunny south is conspicuous by its absence, and be\r\nit observed that the political south and the geographical south of\r\nIreland are entirely different, the Ulstermen invariably using the\r\nterm to denote an imaginary line across the country just above\r\nDundalk. The mention of this town reminds me of a Cork commercial\r\ntraveller's description of the Dundalk festivities in connection with\r\nthe visit of our famous citizen, Mr. Egan, on the occasion of his\r\nrelease--\"There was a murtherin' big crowd o' the greatest ruffians ye\r\never clapped your two eyes on. Some o' them had long sticks with a\r\nlump o' tow on the end, steeped in petroleum or something equally\r\ninflammable, an' whin they got the word to march--the hero was in a\r\nbrake--they lit up and walked away in procession without looking at\r\nhim at all, or taking any notice of him, which was moighty strange, I\r\nthought. They went on an' on, a lot o' rapscallions ye wouldn't like\r\nto meet in a lonely lane, and whin the brake stopped, for some reason\r\nor other, the whole o' them were unconscious of it, an' marched on\r\nwithout the grate man, leaving him an' his brake alone. I had the\r\ncuriosity to go to the meetin'. There were two factions in the town,\r\nan' only one of them was riprisinted, the others stood aloof. They are\r\nat daggers drawn, flyin' at each other's throat, although Catholics\r\nand Home Rulers, an' this meetin' was the funniest thing at all! The\r\nchairman was a common fellow that made money some way, an' ye may say\r\nhe liked to hear himself spake. An' be the powdhers o' war, he had the\r\nconvaniences for speech-makin', for he had a jaw like a bulldog, an' a\r\nmouth on him ye couldn't span with your two hands.\" Further\r\ndescription proceeded in the same strain, and even allowing for the\r\nexuberancies of my friend's southern imagination, and his wide command\r\nof figurative language, this account of the kind of people who\r\nconstitute ninety-nine hundredths of Mr. Gladstone's allies should\r\ngive Home Rulers pause.\r\n\r\nThere is no lack of enthusiasm here, but the people mind their work,\r\nand do not bubble over every five minutes. They certainly showed\r\nwarmth on Monday morning, and never was popular ruler, victorious\r\ngeneral, or famous statesman welcomed with more spontaneous burst of\r\npopular acclaim. York Street was literally full of all classes of\r\npeople, save and except the typical Irish poor. Of the tens of\r\nthousands who filled Royal Avenue, Donegal Place, and the broad road\r\nto the North Counties Railway, I saw none poorly clad. All were well\r\ndressed, orderly, respectable, and wonderfully good-humoured, besides\r\nbeing the tallest and best-grown people I have ever seen in a fairly\r\nextensive European experience. I was admitted to the station with a\r\nlittle knot, comprising the Marquess of Ormonde, Lord Londonderry, the\r\ngigantic Dr. Kane, head of the Ulster Orangemen, and Colonel\r\nSaunderson, full as ever of fun and fight. It was at first intended to\r\nkeep the people outside, and a strong detachment of police guarded the\r\ngreat gates, but in vain. They were swept away by mere pressure, and\r\nthe people occupied the place to the number of many thousands, mostly\r\nwearing primroses. As the train steamed in there was a tremendous rush\r\nand cheering--genuine British cheering, such as that with which\r\nBirmingham used on great occasions to greet John Bright--rendering\r\nalmost inaudible the numerous explosions of fog-signals which perhaps\r\nby way of salute had been placed at the entrance to the station. There\r\nwas a mocking shout of \"Dynamite,\" followed by a roar of laughter, and\r\ndespite the frantic efforts of the railway men, who humanely struggled\r\nto avoid the seemingly impending sacrifices _à la_ Juggernaut, the\r\nmore active members of the crowd storming the train, instantly sprang\r\naloft and manned the tops of the carriages with a solid mass of\r\nvociferating humanity. Soon Mr. Balfour's face appeared, and a moment\r\nafter he was standing amidst the throng, swayed hither and thither by\r\nloyalists who shook his hands, patted him on the back, deafened him\r\nwith their cheers. Out came the horses, dashing through the people,\r\nsnorting and plunging like so many Gladstonians, but happily injuring\r\nno one. In went the men, Mr. Balfour laughing merrily, and looking\r\nuncommonly fit, lifting his soft brown hat in mute recognition of the\r\nmagnificent welcome accorded by men who are perhaps among the most\r\ncompetent judges of his merit as a benefactor of Ireland. Away went\r\nthe carriage, amid tumultuous shouting of \"No Home Rule,\" and \"God\r\nsave the Queen.\" This went on for miles, from the Northern Counties'\r\nTerminus to Victoria Street, when Lord Londonderry signalled to\r\nquicken the pace, and after a short speech at the Albert Memorial, the\r\n_cortége_ disappeared over the bridge, and I returned to meet the\r\nEnglish working men who arrived an hour later. Splendid it was to hear\r\nthe six hundred miners from Newcastle-on-Tyne shouting \"Old Ireland\r\nfor ever!\" while the generous Irishmen responded with \"Rule Britannia\"\r\nand cheers for Old England. Cheers for Belfast and Newcastle\r\nalternated with such stentorian vigour, each side shouting for the\r\nother, that you might have been excused for imagining that the Union\r\nof Hearts was an accomplished fact, and that brotherly love had begun\r\nand must ever continue. Said a miner, \"We're all surprised to see that\r\nthe people here are just like Englishmen. An' I'm blest if they aren't\r\nmore loyal than the English themselves.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Monday morning the city has been resounding with beat of drum and\r\nthe shrill sounds of the fife. The houses are swathed in bunting, and\r\nthe public buildings were already covered with banners when I arrived\r\non Friday last. This, however is not characteristic Belfast form. The\r\nBelfasters _can_ rejoice, and whatever they do, is thoroughly done,\r\nbut work is their vocation, as befits their grave and sober mood. They\r\nare great at figures, and by them they try to show that they, and not\r\nthe Dubliners, should be first considered. They are practical, and\r\nalthough not without sentiment, avoid all useless manifestation of\r\nmere feeling. They are mainly utilitarian, and prefer mathematical\r\nproof, on which they themselves propose to rely, in proving their\r\ncase. Here is an instance. A Belfast accountant, who is also a public\r\nofficer, has collected a number of comparative figures on which he\r\nbases the claims of Belfast to prior consideration. The figures are\r\ncertainly exact, and are submitted as evidence of the superior\r\nbusiness management, and larger, keener capacity of Protestant Belfast\r\nas compared with those of Catholic Dublin. Beginning with the\r\nfunctions of the Dublin Lord Mayor, secretary, and so forth, which\r\ncost £4,967 a year, it is shown that the same work in Belfast--which\r\nis rather larger than Dublin--costs only £176. Let us tabulate a few\r\nrepresentative cases:--\r\n\r\n                                                   Dublin.   Belfast.\r\n\r\nMayor, &c.                                           £4,967       £176\r\nTown Clerk, secretaries of committees, law agents     5,659      2,752\r\nTreasurer, accountants, stock registrar               3,402      2,168\r\nFire Brigade, salaries and lighting                   3,616      1,247\r\nCoroners, sanitary officials                          3,530      1,310\r\nWages of sanitary staff                               2,233      1,130\r\nSurveyors (borough & waterworks) and Secretaries      6,070      4,472\r\nClerks of Peace and Revision Officers                 2,451      1,552\r\n                                                     ------     ------\r\n                 Totals                             £31,928    £14,807\r\n\r\n\r\nThis discrepancy is everywhere observable. The Dublin Gas\r\nManagement costs £14,850 against £8,060 in Belfast, with the\r\nresult that the Ulster City Gasworks yielded in 1891 a profit of\r\n£27,105, charging 2s. 9d., while the Dubliners charge 3s. 6d. and\r\nmake no profit at all. The Belfast markets yield a profit of about\r\n£3,500, while on the Dublin markets and abattoir there was a\r\ndeficit of £3,012 to be made good by the ratepayers. Dublin, with\r\nproperty amounting to £20,000 a year and old-established Royal\r\nbounties, owes nearly twice as much as Belfast, which latter city\r\nspends more on what may be called the advance of civilisation.\r\nIn 1892 Belfast spent £8,000 on a public park--Government\r\nproviding for this matter in Dublin--£5,686 on public libraries,\r\nand £4,100 on baths and workhouses, against £1,217 and £1,627\r\nfor like purposes in Dublin. \"Therefore,\" say the Belfast men,\r\n\"we will not have our affairs managed by these incompetent men,\r\nwho, besides their demonstrated incapacity to deal with finance, are\r\ndependent for their position on the illiterates of the agricultural\r\ndistricts, who are to a man under the thumb of the priests, and who,\r\nmoreover, have shown that their rapacity is equal to their lack of\r\nintegrity, and whose leading doctrine is the repudiation of lawful\r\ncontracts,\" a point on which commercial Ulster is excessively severe.\r\nOne thing is certain--Ulster will never pay taxes levied by an Irish\r\nLegislature in which Ulster would be utterly swamped. All classes\r\nare of this opinion, from the Earl of Ranfurly, who during a long\r\ninterview repeatedly expressed his conviction that the passing of\r\nany Home Rule Bill would be fraught with most lamentable results,\r\nto the humble trimmer of a suburban hedge who, having admitted\r\nthat he was from the county Roscommon, and (therefore) a Catholic\r\nHome Ruler, claimed to know the Ulster temper in virtue of 28\r\nyears' residence in or near Belfast, and said--\r\n\r\n\"What they say they mane, an' the divil himself wouldn't tur-r-n thim.\r\nAh, but they're a har-r-d-timpered breed, ivery mother's son o' them.\r\nYe can comether (gammon) a Roscommon man, but a Bilfast man,\r\nwhillaloo!\" He stopped in sheer despair of finding words to express\r\nthe futility of attempting to take in a Belfast man. \"An' whin ye ax\r\nthim for taxes, an' they say they won't pay--ye might jist as well\r\nwhistle jigs to a milestone! 'Tis thrue what I tell ye.\"\r\n\r\nAs for to-day, the magnificence of the pageant beggars description.\r\nWhether regarded from a scenic point of view or with respect to\r\nnumbers and enthusiasm, never since Belfast was Belfast has the city\r\nlooked upon a sight approaching it. From early morning brass bands and\r\nfife bands commenced to enter the city from every point of the\r\ncompass, and wherever you turned the air resounded with the inspiring\r\nrattle of the drum. Monday's display of bunting was sufficiently\r\nlavish to suggest the impossibility of exhibiting any more, but the\r\nBelfasters accomplished the feat, and the bright sunshine on the\r\nbrilliant colours of the myriad banners was strongly reminiscent of\r\nParis _en fête_ under the Empire. The Belfast streets are long,\r\nstraight, and wide, and mostly intersect at right angles. Much of the\r\nconcourse was thus visible from any moderate coign of vantage, and\r\nfrom the Grand Stand in Donegal Place the sight was truly wonderful.\r\nThe vast space, right, left, and front, was from 10 o'clock closely\r\npacked with a mighty multitude that no man could number, and\r\nlocomotion became every moment so painful as to threaten total\r\nstagnation. The crowd was eminently respectable and perfectly orderly,\r\nand submitted to the passage of innumerable musical organisations with\r\ncharming good humour. Never have I seen or heard of such an assemblage\r\nof bands, all uniformed, all preceded by gorgeous banners bearing all\r\nkinds of loyal and party mottoes, all marching in splendid military\r\nfashion, and of themselves numerous enough to furnish a very\r\nconsiderable demonstration. Many of the tunes were of a decidedly\r\nmartial character, and strange to English ears, such as the \"Boyne\r\nWater,\" the \"Orange Lily\" and the \"Protestant Boys,\" the last being a\r\nversion of the \"Lillibulero\" so often mentioned by Scott. All these\r\ntunes, more or less distasteful to Nationalists, were interspersed\r\nwith others less debatable, such as \"Rule Britannia,\" \"The Old Folks\r\nat Home,\" \"The Last Rose of Summer,\" \"God Save the Queen,\" and \"See\r\nthe Conquering Hero comes,\" which last generally accompanied the\r\nportrait of Orange William, the \"Glorious, Pious, and Immortal,\"\r\nmounted on his famous white charger, which noble animal is depicted in\r\nthe attitude erroneously believed to be peculiar to that of Bonaparte\r\nwhen crossing the Alps. The Earl of Beaconsfield was also to the fore\r\nwith primroses galore; indeed, the favourite flower was invariably\r\nworn by the ladies, who were greatly in evidence. \"Our God, our\r\nCountry, and our Empire\" was the motto over Mr. Balfour, with a huge\r\n\"Welcome\" in white on scarlet ground, the whole surrounded by immense\r\nUnion Jacks. The familiar red, white, and blue bore the brunt of the\r\ndecorative responsibilities, although here and there the green flag of\r\nIreland hung cheek by jowl with the English standard, emphasising the\r\nfriendliness of the present Union. As time went on the crowd became\r\nmore and more dense, and a breathless pressman, who reached his post\r\nat twelve o'clock, stated that the seething myriads of Donegal Place\r\nand the adjacent streets were \"hardly a circumstance\" to what he had\r\nseen in the York Road, where the people awaited the hero of the hour.\r\nThings were getting serious at 12.15, and then it was that the active\r\nmembers of the crowd swarmed on the railings, balancing themselves in\r\nmost uncomfortable situations, and maintaining their spiky seats with\r\na tenacious martyrdom which spoke volumes for the determination of the\r\nUlster character.\r\n\r\nOn and ever on went the bands in seemingly endless procession,\r\nalthough merely assembling for the great march past, and therefore\r\nonly a fraction of the impending multitude. Some enterprising men\r\nclimbed the trees bordering the square, driving away the little flocks\r\nof sparrows which till then had conducted a noisy committee meeting\r\nin the branches, heedless of the drumming and general uproar, but\r\nwhich now dispersed without so much as a vote of thanks to the chair.\r\nAt 12.30 a foam of white faces broke over the roofs of the lofty\r\nbuildings around, protected by stone balustrades. At the same moment a\r\nshout of \"They are coming\" was heard, followed fey a thunderous roar\r\nof cheering. Mr. Balfour slowly emerged from York Road, amid immense\r\nacclamation, his carriage, piloted by the Corporation, moving inch by\r\ninch through the solid mass with inconceivable difficulty. Over and\r\nover again the line of vehicles stopped dead, and it was clear that\r\nthe horses had much trouble to maintain their gravity. As the carriage\r\nwith Sir Daniel Dixon (the Lord Mayor of Belfast), Sir Samuel Black\r\n(Town Clerk), and Lord Londonderry neared the Grand Stand, the\r\npressmen agreed that nothing equal to this demonstration had ever\r\nbefore been held within the British Islands. Mr. Balfour having gained\r\nthe platform the procession proper commenced, headed by the banner of\r\nthe Belfast Harbour Commissioners, while the people broke into a\r\nchorus, asserting that Britons never, never shall be slaves.\r\n\r\nThis at 12.35 precisely. Next came the Belfast Water Commissioners,\r\nthe Belfast Board of Guardians, the provincial Corporate bodies, and\r\nthe provincial Boards of Guardians. A tremendous tumult of voices\r\naccompanied all these, but when the Trinity College graduates arrived\r\nthe din became overpowering. Their standard was halted opposite Mr.\r\nBalfour, and the young fellows burst into wild and uncontrollable\r\nenthusiasm. The medical students of Queen's College, Belfast, with the\r\n_alumni_ of the Methodist and Presbyterian College succeeding, gave\r\n\"God Save the Queen\" with great vigour, and came in a close second;\r\nbut nothing quite touched the Trinity College men. The Scottish\r\nUnionist clubs, a fine body, two thousand strong, confirmed the\r\nstatement that Scots who understand the situation are against Home\r\nRule. Most of these men work in the shipbuilding yards of Belfast. The\r\nBelfast Unionist Clubs and the Provincial Unionist Clubs were, of\r\ncourse, heartily greeted, returning the applause with interest, and\r\nthe Independent Order of Rechabites showed that their alleged\r\nexclusive partiality for cold water had not diminished their lung\r\npower. The British Order of Ancient Free Gardeners, the Loyal Order of\r\nAncient Shepherds, and the Independent Order of Oddfellows reminded\r\nthe Brutal Saxon who might be present of his native shore, the men\r\nbeing of the familiar sturdy type, marching in dense columns, all\r\ngloriously arrayed. There was none of the artful spreading over the\r\nground which I observed in the great Birmingham demonstration which\r\nwas to \"end or mend\" the Lords; and another point of divergency\r\nconsists in the fact that the Belfast demonstration, which was\r\nincomparably larger, was perfectly spontaneous, and not due to\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\nBaronets and other gentlemen of distinction headed the Unionist clubs,\r\nwalking through the streets in such manner as was never known before.\r\nMagistrates and Presbyterian ministers tramped with the rank and file.\r\nSir William Ewart, Bart., Mr. Thomas Sinclair, J.P.--a great name in\r\nthe city--and the Rev. Dr. Lynd were especially prominent. Some of the\r\nteetotallers wore white sashes, which were perhaps more conspicuous\r\nthan the gaudy colours affected by the Orangemen, and one body of\r\nUnionists from the suburban clubs waved white handkerchiefs, a feature\r\nwhich for obvious reasons can never occur in Nationalist processions.\r\nThe Shepherds have a pastoral dress, each man carrying a crook, and\r\nthe marshals of the lodges bore long halberds. The van of each column\r\nwas preceded by a stout fellow, who dexterously raising a long staff\r\nin a twirling fashion peculiar to Ireland, shouted, \"Faugh-a-Ballagh,\"\r\nwhich being interpreted signifies \"Clear the way.\" The Oddfellows\r\nmarched to the tune known in England as \"We won't go home till\r\nmorning,\" which is the same as \"Marlborough goes to war,\" the\r\nfavourite air of the Great Napoleon. All this time Mr. Balfour is\r\nstanding at my elbow as I write, bareheaded, acknowledging the finest\r\nreception ever accorded to any man in Ireland, not excepting Dan\r\nO'Connell and Parnell. The funeral of the uncrowned king was a\r\ncomparatively small affair, while the respectability of the crowd was\r\nof course immeasurably below that of the Belfast concourse. An old man\r\nsomehow got near the platform and presented Mr. Balfour with a bunch\r\nof orange lilies, saying that was the flower the people would fight\r\nunder. The Young Men's Christian Association cheered lustily for the\r\nUnion to the tune of three thousand strong. The Central Presbyterian\r\nAssociation marched past singing \"God is our refuge and our strength,\"\r\nand the Church of Ireland Young Men's Society, headed by the clergy,\r\nsuperintended by the Bishop of the diocese from the stand, made a\r\nbrave and gallant show. Hour after hour glides by, and still the\r\nteeming multitude moves on, and still Mr. Balfour stands uncovered. No\r\njoke to be a hero nowadays. The \"Young Irelands\" gave a grand cheer,\r\nand passed in brave array, singing with the Y.M.C.A. \"Hold the Fort\"\r\nand \"God Save the Queen.\" Dr. Kane, the Bishop of Clogher, Captain\r\nSomerset Maxwell, Colonel Saunderson, and the Earl of Erne, Grand\r\nMaster of the Orangemen of Ireland, received a stupendous reception as\r\nthey followed the Young Men Christians, mustered in overwhelming\r\nforce. The \"Marseillaise\" here broke out with considerable severity,\r\nand Mr. Balfour broke out into a broad smile, which ran over into a\r\nlaugh, as the too familiar strains of \"Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay\" made the\r\nwelkin ring. Then came \"The March of the Men of Harlech,\" mixed with\r\n\"Home Sweet Home\" and \"The Boyne Water,\" till the senses reeled again.\r\n\r\nAt 3.35 the two miles of Orangemen seemed likely to go on for ever,\r\nand Mr. Balfour said to me, \"I think this demonstration undoubtedly\r\nthe greatest ever seen, and if you like you may convey that as my\r\nmessage to the Unionists of Birmingham. They will know what the effect\r\nof this will be. I need say no more.\" I asked Mr. Balfour if he\r\nthought the bill would pass, and he replied, \"Tell the Birmingham men\r\nwhat I have said already. They will require no more.\" At 4.10 the\r\nprocession was in full swing, but Mr. Balfour seemed to have had about\r\nenough and showed symptoms of making a move, and, as a preliminary,\r\nput on his hat. This was the signal for cheering, which perhaps\r\nsurpassed anything that had gone before. The great ex-Irish-Secretary\r\neffaced himself; and Colonel Saunderson, backed by Lord Salisbury's\r\nson and several Irish peers, essayed to fill the gap. I ventured in my\r\ntimid way to tap the gallant Colonel on the shoulder with a view to\r\ntapping his sentiments, which proved to be exultant. He told me of the\r\nwire he had received from Lord Salisbury, and spoke of the meeting in\r\nthe Botanic Gardens which had taken place while I had watched the\r\nprocession. Then he said, \"Tell the Birmingham people through the\r\n_Gazette_ that as we have the last Prime Minister and the present\r\nChief of the Opposition with us, we cannot be called revolutionary. As\r\nfor this meeting, it will speak for itself. I think it the biggest\r\nthing ever known.\" During the procession a copy of the Home Rule Bill\r\nwas burnt on the top of a pole in front of the Grand Stand.\r\n\r\nAfter exactly four hours of watching, I accepted the proffered aid of\r\nan Irish friend who agreed to lead me by roundabout ways to the\r\ntelegraph office. After many narrow passages and devious turns, we\r\nstruck the Royal Avenue, a long, long way from our starting place.\r\nHere we took the still advancing procession in flank. It was now 4.45,\r\nand my friend said, \"By jabers, there's forty million more of them. I\r\nbelieve the procession reaches all round the world, and moves in a\r\ncontinuous band.\" And, sure enough, they were coming on as fresh as\r\never, but I felt that four hours and a quarter of bands and drums was\r\nenough at once, so I made a dash for the wires before they should be\r\nabsolutely blocked. My account is not, perhaps, quite perfect, but it\r\nwas pencilled under extraordinary circumstances--ten people talking to\r\nme at once, a lady's umbrella in my side, a thousand people leaning on\r\nmy right elbow, and five hundred bands sounding in my ear. Surely it\r\nmay be said to have been written under fire.\r\n\r\nBelfast, April 4th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 5.--HAS MR. MORLEY LIED?\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Belfast I obtained incontrovertible evidence anent the\r\ngrowing fears of Mr. Gladstone's Government. Mr. Morley has denied the\r\nexistence of any such nervousness, and has repudiated the assertion\r\nthat precautions have been taken. But what is the truth of the matter?\r\nLet us see whether his statement is borne out by facts.\r\n\r\nIn February certain military officers received a confidential\r\ncommunication having reference to the defence of the Belfast barracks.\r\nThey were requested to examine and report upon the possibility of\r\nthese buildings being tenable against a _coup de main_, were ordered\r\nto examine the loop-holes for musketry, to prepare plans of the same,\r\nand to duly submit them to the proper authorities, giving their\r\nopinion as to the practicability and sufficiency of existing\r\narrangements in the event of the buildings being assaulted by\r\norganised bodies of armed civilians, during the absence of soldiers\r\nwho might be about the city, taking their walks abroad, after the\r\nregulation manner permitted to Mr. Thomas Atkins under ordinary\r\ncircumstances. The order was executed, the plans were duly furnished,\r\nand if Mr. Morley is still unaware of the fact, I have much pleasure\r\nin imparting the information which I have on the best authority\r\nattainable in an imperfect world. He may rely on this statement as\r\nbeing absolutely undeniable, and to descend to particulars, I will add\r\nthat plans were made of the Tram Stables Barracks, the Willow Bank\r\nBarracks, and the Victoria Barracks. As I have said, the instructions\r\nwere marked Confidential, and the Irish Secretary may have relied on\r\nthis magic word in formulating his denials. The alternative hypothesis\r\nis, of course, obvious enough. The work may have been ordered and\r\nexecuted without Mr. Morley's knowledge, but it has been done, and,\r\nafter proper inquiry, he will not venture to deny it. The circumstance\r\nis a curious commentary on the Gladstonian affectation of perfect\r\nsecurity, and the scornful references of Home Rulers to the alleged\r\ndetermination of Ulstermen, in the last resource, to push matters to\r\nextremity. I could tell him more than this. It would be easy to adduce\r\nother instances of Governmental nervousness, but prudential and\r\nconfidential considerations intervene.\r\n\r\nHowever, while in the vein, let me submit for serious contemplation\r\nthe fact that up to the morning postal delivery of Wednesday, April 5,\r\n1893, written offers of personal assistance in the matter of armed\r\nresistance to the exact number of ten thousand and five have reached a\r\ncertain Ulster organisation from England and Scotland, the roll\r\nincluding five generals, with a percentage of Victoria Cross men. This\r\nstatement is made on the authority of the Earl of Ranfurly, who told\r\nme that the matter was within his personal knowledge, and that the\r\nwhole of these communications were entirely spontaneous and altogether\r\nunsolicited, and that nobody in Ireland was in any way responsible for\r\ntheir existence. Lord Ranfurly also said that while the hearty\r\nfriendship and co-operation of these gentlemen were warmly appreciated\r\nby Irish Loyalists, he was quite certain that their generous aid would\r\nnever be required, for that Home Rule was now defunct, dead, and\r\nburied, and beyond the possibility of resurrection. It may be\r\nremarked, in passing, that this is the feeling of the best-informed\r\nIrish Home Rulers, and that many in my hearing have offered to back\r\ntheir opinion by laying odds. The rejection of the Bill so far from\r\nexasperating the Nationalist party, would positively come as a relief.\r\nTo say that they are lukewarm is only to fairly indicate a state of\r\nfeeling which is rapidly degenerating into frigidity. They declare\r\nthat the Bill is unworkable, and while maintaining their abstract\r\nright to demand whatever they choose, believe that, taking one\r\nconsideration with another, the lot of autonomic Ireland would not be\r\na happy one.\r\n\r\nMr. Richard Patterson, J.P., the great ironmonger of Belfast, observes\r\nthat \"according to Mr. Gladstone the only people who really understand\r\nUlster are those who have never been in it.\" My interview with him was\r\nboth instructive and interesting. He is one of the Harbour\r\nCommissioners, and a gentleman of considerable scientific attainments,\r\nas well as a great public and commercial man. He belongs to the Reform\r\nClub and, with his fellow-members, was up to 1886 a devoted follower\r\nof Mr. Gladstone. The name of his firm, established in 1786 on the\r\nvery ground it now occupies, is a household word in Ireland, and Mr.\r\nPatterson himself has the respect and esteem of his bitterest\r\npolitical opponents. He pointed out the unfairness and injustice of\r\nMr. Gladstone's reference to religion, when turning a deaf ear to the\r\nBelfast deputation. \"The report of the Chamber of Commerce,\" he said,\r\n\"was a purely business statement, and had no element of party feeling.\r\nThe fact that the Protestant members of the Chamber outnumber the\r\nCatholics is in no respect due to religious intolerance, which in this\r\nbody is totally unknown. Anybody who pays a guinea a year may be\r\nelected a member, whatever his religion, whatever his circumstances,\r\nproviding he is a decent member of society, which is the only\r\nqualification required. Members are certainly elected by ballot, but\r\nduring the many years I have belonged to the Chamber not a single\r\nperson has been black-balled. If the Protestants are more numerous,\r\nthe fact simply demonstrates their superior prosperity, arising only\r\nfrom their more steady application to hard work. We live on terms of\r\nperfect friendship with our Catholic countrymen, and we assiduously\r\ncultivate the sentiment. It is only when a weak and ignorant pandering\r\nto disloyalty excites opposition that enmity begins. Only let us\r\nalone, that is all we ask. We were going on beautifully until Mr.\r\nGladstone and his accomplices upset everything.\" Speaking of the\r\ndifference between the Ulster men and the Irish Kelts, Mr. Patterson\r\nsaid, \"Prosperity or the reverse is indicative of the breed. The\r\nSouthern Irish had more advantages than the Ulstermen. They had better\r\nland, better harbours, a far more productive country, and yet they\r\nalways seethe in discontent. Put 20,000 Northerners in Cork, and in\r\ntwenty years the Southern port could knock Liverpool out of time.\"\r\nAddressing himself to the Home Rule Bill, he declared that the\r\npractical, keen-witted merchants of Belfast dismissed the whole\r\nconcoction as unworthy of sober consideration, and declared that an\r\nawful responsibility rested on Mr. Gladstone. Said this experienced\r\nJ.P.:\r\n\r\n\"The Belfast riots of 1886 were terrible. Forty people were killed in\r\nthe streets, and what I saw in my capacity of magistrate was dreadful\r\nin the extreme. The injuries from gun-shot wounds were almost\r\ninnumerable, and many a local doctor gained experience in this line\r\nwhich is unknown to many an army surgeon. The riots began with the\r\nruffian class, from which this great city is not entirely free, and\r\ngradually rose upwards to the shipbuilding yards. All this disturbance\r\nand awful loss of life were entirely due to the production of Mr.\r\nGladstone's first bill. And now they tell us that a worse bill--for it\r\nis a worse bill--might become law without any inconvenience. I submit\r\nto any reasonable man that if the mere menace of a bill cost forty\r\nlives in Belfast alone, the loss of life all over Ireland, once the\r\nbill were passed, would be enormous. And all this will be attributable\r\nto the action of Mr. Gladstone, who has never been in Ulster.\"\r\n\r\nWalking down Royal Avenue I met Colonel Saunderson, radiant after the\r\ngreat demonstration of two days ago, wearing a big bunch of violets in\r\nplace of Tuesday's bouquet of primroses. He stopped to express good\r\nwishes to the _Gazette_, and said that the Belfasters were proud of\r\nBirmingham, which city he regarded as being the most advanced and\r\nenlightened in the world. While he so spake, up came the mighty Dr.\r\nKane, idol of the Ulsterites, towering over the gallant Colonel's\r\npaltry six feet one, and looking down smilingly from his altitude in\r\ninfinite space on my own discreditable five feet ten. He agreed with\r\nthe Colonel as to the merits of Birmingham, and added that every\r\nUnionist in Belfast cherished a deep sentiment of gratitude to the\r\nhardware city, requesting me to explode the misleading statements of\r\nthe Separatist press, which asserts that Tuesday's procession\r\nconsisted of Orangemen. \"The first two hours,\" said the Reverend\r\nDoctor, \"consisted of bodies who do not processionise, and who never\r\nperform in public, in or out of Belfast, Methodists, Presbyterians,\r\nand the like, while the 25,000 or 30,000 Orangemen who came in at the\r\ntail of the show were a mere fraction of the whole. Colonel\r\nSaunderson, the Earl of Erne, and myself stood up in our carriage and\r\ncheered the Radical Reform Club, a thing we certainly have never done\r\nbefore.\" Here the Colonel laughed, and said--\r\n\r\n\"The union of hearts, Doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the union of hearts and no mistake, as the Grand Old Man will\r\nfind--to his cost. All classes are united against the common enemy\"\r\n(Mr. Gladstone). \"But tell me something--How is it that the English\r\npeople are deceived by that arch-professor of cant? Tell me that!\"\r\n\r\nI requested the good doctor to ask me something easier, and he\r\ndoubtless would have done so, but at this moment up came the famous\r\nDr. Traill, the Admirable Crichton of Ireland, and with my usual\r\nthirst for knowledge, I ventured to suggest that the mathematical\r\nintellect of the Trinity College Examiner might possibly grapple with\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\nThe learned professor smiled, gripped my unworthy fin, shook out some\r\nwords of greeting, wagged his head hopelessly, and--bolted like a\r\nrocket.\r\n\r\nDr. Traill is said to be equally versed in Law, Physic, and Divinity,\r\nto sport with trigonometry, and to amuse his lighter moments with the\r\ndifferential calculus. But \"this knowledge was too wonderful for him,\r\nhe could not attain unto it,\" and to avoid confession of defeat, he\r\nfled with lightning speed. This erudite doctor is well known in\r\nEngland, especially among riflemen. Colonel Saunderson describes him\r\nas a wonderful shot at a thousand yards, and thinks he was once one of\r\nthe Irish Eight at Wimbledon. I met him on the stand on Tuesday, when\r\nhe amusingly described his adventures on the Continent. \"The poor\r\nPoles,\" he said, \"wished to take me to their collective bosom, and to\r\nfall on my individual neck, the moment they found I was an Irishman.\r\nThey said we were brothers in misfortune!\" Whereat this learned pundit\r\nlaughed good-humouredly. It may be that Dr. Traill is the long-range\r\nrifleman of whom a Land League man remarked, on hearing that the\r\nmarksman had made a long series of bull's eyes--\r\n\r\n\"The saints betune us an' harm--but wouldn't he make an iligant\r\ntenant!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Kane was not surprised to see the professor run away. He said, \"I\r\ncannot understand it all. I must and will cross the Channel\r\nimmediately to investigate this strange phenomenon. I have always\r\nconsidered the English a people of superior mental force, men who\r\ncould not be easily deceived. That they should pin their faith to a\r\nman who has proved to demonstration that Home Rule is impossible, who\r\nmore than any other has branded the Nationalist party with ignominy, I\r\ncannot understand.\" The Doctor perhaps momentarily forgot that the\r\nEnglish do not pin their faith to Mr. Gladstone, that the adverse\r\nmajority are dead against him, and that this majority is daily\r\nincreasing by leaps and bounds. Gallant Captain Leslie, whom I saw\r\nearlier in the day, more accurately hit the situation. This splendid\r\nold soldier said, \"The English people are not to be blamed. Living\r\nunder social conditions of perfect freedom and friendship they do not\r\nunderstand the conditions prevailing in Ireland; they cannot be\r\nexpected to understand a state of things differing so widely from\r\nanything within the circle of their own experience. But all the same,\r\nif they grant Home Rule, if they listen to the disloyal party rather\r\nthan to their loyal friends, if they truckle to treason rather than\r\nsupport their own supporters, the consequences will be disastrous to\r\nEngland, and where the disasters will stop is a piece of knowledge\r\nwhich 'passes the wit of man.'\"\r\n\r\nRunning up to Ballymena, I encountered several interesting\r\npersonalities, each of whom had his own view of the all-absorbing\r\nsubject, and looked at the matter from his own standpoint. An\r\nIrish-American of high culture, a man of science, looked up from what\r\nhe regarded as \"the most interesting book in existence,\" which turned\r\nout to be Thompson's \"Evolution of Sex,\" and said that once Home Rule\r\nwere in force the blackguard American-Irish would return in shoals,\r\nand that the Fenians of America might be expected to \"boss the show.\"\r\n\"How is it,\" he asked, \"that the English people listen to what appears\r\nthe chief argument of Separatist orators--that agitation will come to\r\nan end, that the Irish will be content to rest and be thankful?\r\nClearly while money and power can be had by agitation, so long will\r\nagitation continue. That seems so obvious to me, that I wonder at the\r\npatience of the North of England men--I was among them during the\r\ngeneral election--in listening quietly to this argument, if it be one\r\nat all. And with all their experience of the past to enlighten them\r\ninto the bargain. Was not the disestablishment of the Church to remove\r\nall cause of discontent? Then it was the land. You gave several Land\r\nActs, most favourable laws, very one-sided, all in favour of the\r\ntenant, far beyond what English, Scotch, or Welsh farmers hope to get.\r\nHave you satisfied Irishmen yet? No, and you never will. The more you\r\ngive, the more they ask. They never will be content. ''Tis not their\r\nnature to.' England now suffers for her own weak good nature. The true\r\ncurse of Ireland is laziness. I left Belfast at twenty, but I am well\r\nacquainted with Ireland. In the North they work and prosper. In the\r\nSouth they do nothing but nurse their grievances. Twenty years' firm\r\ngovernment, as Lord Salisbury said, would enrich the country. Do the\r\nright thing by them--put them level with England and Scotland, and\r\nthen put down your foot. Let them know that howling will do no good,\r\nand they'll stop it like a shot. Paddy is mighty 'cute, and knows when\r\nhe has a _man_ to deal with. Put a noodle over him and that noodle's\r\nlife will be a burden. And serve him right. Fools must expect fools'\r\nreward.\"\r\n\r\nA Catholic priest I met elsewhere was very chary of his opinions, and\r\nconfined himself to the \"hope that England would see her way to\r\ncompensate the Church and the country for centuries of extortion and\r\noppression.\" This he thought was a matter of \"common honesty.\" He did\r\nnot exactly suggest a perpetual church-rate for the benefit of the\r\nCatholics of Ireland, but the thing is on the cards, and may be\r\nproposed by Mr. Gladstone later on. Something ought to be done,\r\nsomething substantial, for the gentlemen educated under the Maynooth\r\nGrant. Mr. Bull has admitted the principle, and his sense of fair play\r\nwill doubtless lead him to do the right thing, always, of course,\r\nunder compulsion, which is now usually regarded as the mainspring of\r\nthat estimable gentleman's supposed virtuous actions.\r\n\r\nBallymena is a smart looking place, trig and trim, thriving and\r\nwell-liking, a place to look upon and live. The people are all\r\nwell-clad, and prosperous, well-fed and well-grown. The men are mostly\r\nbig, the women mostly beautiful; the houses are of stone, handsome and\r\nwell-built. On the bleaching grounds you see long miles of\r\nlinen--Irish miles, of course--and all the surroundings are pleasant.\r\nAfter this, no need to say the place is one of the blackest, most\r\nUnionist, Protestant, and loyal in the whole country. A number of buff\r\nplacards issued by Nationalists attract respectful attention. The same\r\nbill is stuck all over Belfast--in the High Street, on the hoardings\r\nfacing the heretic meeting houses, everywhere. It purports to present\r\nthe sentiments of the great Duke of Wellington _re_ the Roman\r\nCatholics of Ireland, and is to the effect that in moments of danger\r\nand difficulty the Roman Catholics had caused the British Empire to\r\nfloat buoyant when other Empires were wrecked; that the Roman\r\nCatholics of Ireland, and they only, had saved our freedom, our\r\nConstitution, our institutions, and in short that it is to the Irish\r\nRoman Catholics that we owe everything worth having. Alone they did\r\nit. The priest, in short, has made Mr. Bull the man he is.\r\n\r\nCan anybody in England \"go one better\" than this?\r\n\r\nThese extracts are plainly taken from some speech on the Roman\r\nCatholic Emancipation Bill, and refer to the valour of the Irish\r\nsoldiery, whose bravery in fighting for a Protestant cause was\r\ndoubtless invaluable to the cause of liberty. There is an apocryphal\r\nstory concerning Alfred de Musset, who on his death-bed is reported to\r\nhave conveyed to a friend with his last breath his last, his only\r\nwish, to wit:--\r\n\r\n\"Don't permit me to be annotated.\" The Iron Duke might have said the\r\nsame if he had thought of it. He could not know that, shorn of his\r\ncontext, divorced from his drift, he would be placarded in his native\r\nland as an agent in the cause of sedition and disloyalty. This truly\r\nGrand Old Man, who, in his determination to uphold the dignity and\r\nunity of the Empire \"stood four-square to all the winds that blew,\"\r\nwould scarcely have sided with the modern G.O.M. and his satellites,\r\nHorsewhipped Healy and Breeches O'Brien.\r\n\r\nOne word as to the alleged \"intolerance of the fanatic Orangemen of\r\nBelfast.\"\r\n\r\nThe placards above-mentioned were up on Tuesday last. They are large\r\nand boldly printed, and attracted crowds of readers--but not a hand\r\nwas raised to deface them, to damage them, to do them any injury\r\nwhatever. I watched them for four-and-twenty hours, and not a finger\r\nwas lifted against any one in the High Street or elsewhere, so far as\r\nI could ascertain.\r\n\r\nThere are twenty thousand Orangemen in the city, and the Protestants\r\noutnumber the Papists by three to one. Yet the placard was treated\r\nwith absolute respect, and although I entered several groups of\r\nreaders I heard no words of criticism--no comment, unfavourable or\r\notherwise, no gesture of dissent. The people seemed to be interested\r\nin the bill, and desirous of giving it respectful consideration. I\r\nhave seen Liberal Birmingham, when in the days of old it assembled\r\nround Tory posters--but the subject becomes delicate; better change\r\nour ground. It is, however, only fair to say that the Gladstonians of\r\nBirmingham, who, as everybody knows, formed the extreme and inferior\r\nwing of the old Radical party, can hardly teach the Belfast men\r\ntolerance.\r\n\r\nBallymena, April 6th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 6.--THE EXODUS OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDerry is a charming town, unique, indescribable. Take equal parts of\r\nAmsterdam and Antwerp, add the Rhine at Cologne, and Waterloo Bridge,\r\nmix with the wall of Chester and the old guns of Peel Castle, throw in\r\na strong infusion of Wales, with about twenty Nottingham lace\r\nfactories, stir up well and allow to settle, and you will get the\r\ngeneral effect. The bit of history resulting in the raising of the\r\nsiege still influences Derry conduct and opinions. The 'Prentice Boys\r\nof Derry, eight hundred strong, are ardent loyalists, and having once\r\nbeaten an army twenty-five thousand strong, believe that for the good\r\nof the country, like the orator who had often \"gone widout a male,\"\r\nthey too could \"do it again.\" They do not expect to be confronted with\r\nthe necessity, but both the Boys and the Orangemen of Derry, with all\r\ntheir co-religionists, are deeply pledged to resist a Dublin\r\nParliament. \"We would not take the initiative, but would merely stand\r\non our own defence, and offer a dogged resistance. We have a tolerable\r\nstore of arms, although this place was long a proclaimed district, and\r\nwe have fifteen modern cannon, two of which are six-pounders, the rest\r\nmostly four-pounders, and one or two two-pounders, which are snugly\r\nstored away, for fear of accident.\" Thus spake one who certainly\r\nknows, and his words were amply confirmed from another quarter.\r\n\r\nDerry makes shirts. The industrious Derryans make much money, and in\r\nmany ways. They catch big salmon in the middle of the town, and\r\noutside it they have what Mr. Gladstone would call a \"plethora\" of\r\nrivers. They ship unnumbered emigrants to the Far West, and carry the\r\nproduce of the surrounding agriculturists to Glasgow and Liverpool.\r\nThey also make collars and cuffs, but this is mere sport. Their real\r\nvocation is the making of shirts, which they turn out by the million,\r\nmostly of high quality. Numbers of great London houses have their\r\nworks at Derry. Welch, Margeston and Co. among others. The Derry\r\npartner, Mr. Robert Greer, an Englishman forty years resident in the\r\ntown, favoured me with his views _re_ Home Rule, thus:--\r\n\r\n\"The bill would be ruinous to Ireland, but not to the same extent as\r\nto England. Being an Englishman, I may be regarded as free from the\r\nsectarian animosity which actuates the opposing parties, but I cannot\r\nclose my eyes to the results of the bill, results of which no sane\r\nperson, in a position to give an opinion, can have any doubt. We are\r\nso convinced that the bill would render our business difficult, not to\r\nsay impracticable, that our London partners say they will remove the\r\nworks, plant, machinery, and all, to the West of Scotland or\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"About 1,200 girls are employed in the mill, and 3,000 to 4,000 women\r\nat their own homes all over the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone may think he knows best, but here the unanimous opinion\r\nis that trade will be fatally injured. Ireland is no mean market for\r\nEnglish goods, and the market will be closed because Ireland will have\r\nno money to spend. Go outside the manufacturing towns and what do you\r\nsee? Chronic poverty. Manufacturers will remove to the Continent, to\r\nAmerica--anywhere else--leaving the peasantry only. The prospective\r\ntaxes are alarming. We know what would be one of the very first acts\r\nof a Dublin Parliament. They would curry favour with the poor, the\r\nlazy districts, by an equalisation of the poor rate. In Derry, where\r\neverybody works for his bread, the rate is about sixpence in the\r\npound. There are districts where it runs to ten shillings in the\r\npound. The wealthy traders, the capitalists, the manufacturers of the\r\nNorth will have to pay for the loafers of the South. The big men would\r\ngather up their goods and chattels and clear out. There are other\r\nreasons for this course.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Greer made the inevitable statement that Englishmen out of\r\nIreland did not understand the question; and another large\r\nmanufacturer chipped in with:--\r\n\r\n\"Leave us alone, and we get on admirably. There is no intolerance;\r\neverybody lives comfortably with his neighbour. But pass the bill and\r\nwhat happens? The Catholic employés would become unmanageable, would\r\nbegin to kick over the traces, would want to dictate terms, would\r\nattempt to dominate the Protestant section, which would rebel, and\r\ntrouble would ensue. They would not work together. It is impracticable\r\nto say: Employ one faith only and Home Rule means that Catholicism is\r\nto hold the sway. The Nationalist leaders foster this spirit,\r\notherwise there would be no Home Rule. The workpeople would act as\r\ndirected by the priest, even in matters connected with employment. You\r\nhave no idea what that means to us. It means ruin. The people do not\r\nknow their own mind, and their ignorance is amazing. My porter says\r\nthat when the bill becomes law, which will take place in one month\r\nfrom date, he will have a situation in Dublin at a thousand a year,\r\nand both he and others sincerely believe in such a changed state of\r\nthings for Catholics alone.\"\r\n\r\nI went over Welch, Margetson's works, a wonderful place, where were\r\nhundreds of women, clean and well-dressed, working at the various\r\ndepartments of shirt-making. The highest class of mill hands I ever\r\nsaw, working in large and well-ventilated rooms, many getting a pound\r\na week. Another firm over the way employs one thousand five hundred\r\nmore. And according to the best authority, that of the owners, all\r\nthis is to leave the country when Ireland gets Home Rule.\r\n\r\nA very intelligent Catholic farmer living a few miles out of Donegal\r\nsaid, \"Farmers look at the bill in the light of the land question.\r\nWe're not such fools as to believe in Gladstone or his bill for\r\nanythin' else. Shure, Gladstone never invints anythin' at all, but\r\nonly waits till pressure is put on him. Shure, iverythin' has to be\r\ndhragged out iv him, an' if he settles the land question, divil thank\r\nhim, 'tis because he knows he's bate out an' out, an' _has_ to do it,\r\nwhether he will or no. An' now he comes bowin' an' scrapin' an'\r\ncondiscindin' to relave us--whin we kicked it out o' his skin. Ah! the\r\ndivil sweep him an' his condiscinshun.\"\r\n\r\nIngratitude, thy name is Irish Tenant!\r\n\r\nMisther O'Doherty proceeded to say that landlords were all right now,\r\nunder compulsion. But the tenantry demanded that they should be\r\nreleased entirely from the landlords' yoke. He said that the\r\nagriculturists were not in touch with the whole question of Home Rule,\r\nnor would they consider any subject but that of the land. The\r\nNationalists had preached prairie value, and the people were tickled\r\nby the idea of driving out landowners and Protestants. All the evicted\r\ntenants, all the men who have no land, all the ne'er-do-weels would\r\nexpect to be satisfied. Ulster is tillage--the South is mostly\r\ngrazing. Ulster had been profitably cultivated by black Protestants,\r\nand their land was coveted by the priests for their own people. My\r\nfriend admitted that, although born a Catholic, his religious opinions\r\nwere liberal. I asked him if the Protestant minority would be\r\ncomfortable under a Dublin Parliament. He shook his head\r\nnegatively--\"Under equal laws they are friendly enough, but they do\r\nnot associate, they do not intermarry, they have little or nothing to\r\ndo with each other. They are like oil and wather in the same bottle,\r\nye can put them together but they won't mix. And the Protestant\r\nminority has always been the best off, simply because they are hard\r\nworkers. A full-blooded Irishman is no worker. He likes to live from\r\nhand to mouth, and that satisfies him. When he has enough to last him\r\na day through he drops work at once. The Protestants have Scotch\r\nblood, and they go on working with the notion that they'll be better\r\noff than their father, who was better off than their grandfather. And\r\nthat's the whole of it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. J. Gilbert Kennedy, of Donegal, holds similar views of Irish\r\nindolence. He told me that although living in a congested district he\r\ncould not obtain men to dig in his gardens, except when thereto driven\r\nby sheer necessity, and that having received a day's pay they would\r\nnot return to work so long as their money lasted. \"They will put up\r\nwith semi-starvation, cold, and nakedness most patiently. Their\r\nendurance is most commendable. They will bear anything, only--don't\r\nask them to work.\" Mrs. Kennedy said that with crowds of poor girls\r\naround her, she was compelled to obtain kitchen maids and so forth\r\nfrom Belfast. \"They will not be servants, and when they afford casual\r\nhelp, they do it as a great favour.\"\r\n\r\nA Scotsman who employs five hundred men in the mechanical work said:\r\n\"I have been in Ireland fifteen years, and have gone on fairly\r\nsmoothly, but with a world of management. For the sake of peace I have\r\nnot five Protestants in the place; and I would have none if I could\r\nhelp it. It is, however, necessary to have Protestant foremen.\r\nIrishmen are not born mechanics. In Scotland and England men take to\r\nthe vice and the lathe like mother's milk, but here it is labour and\r\npain. Irishmen are not capable of steady, unremitting work. They want\r\na day on and a day off. They wish to be traders, cattle-drovers,\r\npig-jobbers, that they may wander from fair to fair. My men have\r\nlittle to do beyond minding machines; otherwise I must have Scots or\r\nEnglish. Discharge a man and the most singular things occur. In a late\r\ninstance I had seven written requests from all sorts of quarters to\r\ntake the man back, although before discharge he had been duly warned.\r\nThe entire neighbourhood called on me--the man's father, wife, mother,\r\nthe priest, a Protestant lady, three whiskey-sellers, two\r\nPresbyterians, the Church of Ireland parson, God knows who. This\r\nlasted a fortnight, and then threatening letters set in; coffins,\r\nskulls, and marrow-bones were chalked all over the place, with my\r\ninitials. Indeed you may say they are a wonderful people.\"\r\n\r\nMr. E.T. Herdman, J.P., of Sion Mills, Co. Tyrone, should know\r\nsomething of the Irish people. The model village above-named belongs\r\nto him. Travellers to Londonderry viâ the Great Northern will remember\r\nhow the great Herdman flax-spinning mills, with their clean,\r\nprosperous, almost palatial appearance, relieve the melancholy aspect\r\nof the peaty landscape about the Rivers Mourne and Derg. Mr. Herdman\r\npays in wages some £30,000 a year, a sum of which the magnitude\r\nassumes colossal proportions in view of the surrounding landscape. The\r\npeople of the district speak highly of the Herdman family, who are\r\ntheir greatest benefactors, but they failed to return Mr. E.T.\r\nHerdman, who contested East Donegal in 1892. The people were willing\r\nenough, but the priests stepped in and sent a Nationalist. Said Mr.\r\nHerdman, \"Home Rule would be fatal to England. The Irish people have\r\nmore affinity with the Americans or the French than with the English,\r\nand the moment international difficulties arise Ireland would have to\r\nbe reconquered by force of arms. And complications would arise, and in\r\nmy estimation would arise very early.\" A landowner I met at Beragh,\r\nCounty Tyrone, held somewhat original opinions. He said, \"I refused to\r\nidentify myself with any Unionist movement. If we're going to be\r\nrobbed, let us be robbed; if our land is going to be confiscated, let\r\nit be confiscated. The British Government is going to give us\r\nsomething, if not much, by way of compensation; and my opinion is,\r\nthat if the Grand Old Man lives five years longer he'll propose to\r\ngive the Irish tenants the fee-simple of the lands without a penny to\r\npay. That's my view, begad. I'm a sportsman, not a politician, and my\r\nwife says I'm a fool, and very likely she knows best. But, begad, I\r\nsay let us have prairie value to-day, for to-morrow the G.O.M. will\r\ngive us nothing at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary curiosity of Derry, the _lusus naturæ_ of which\r\nthe citizens justly boast, is _the_ Protestant Home Ruler of brains\r\nand integrity who, under the familiar appellation of John Cook, lives\r\nin Waterloo Place. Reliable judges said, \"Mr. Cook is a man of high\r\nhonour, and the most sincere patriot imaginable, besides being a\r\nhighly-cultured gentleman.\" So excited was I, so eager to see an Irish\r\nHome Ruler combining these qualities with his political faith, that I\r\nset off instanter in search of him, and having sought diligently till\r\nI found him, intimated a desire to sit at his patriotic feet. He\r\nconsented to unburden his Nationalist bosom, and assuredly seemed to\r\nmerit the high character he everywhere bears. Having heard his opinion\r\non the general question, I submitted that Mr. Bull's difficulty was\r\nlack of confidence, and that he might grant a Home Rule Bill, if the\r\nIrish leaders were men of different stamp. He said they were \"clever\r\nmen not overburdened with money,\" and admitted that a superior class\r\nwould have been more trustworthy, but relied on the people. \"If the\r\nfirst administrators of the law were dishonest, the people would\r\nreplace them by others. The keystone of my political faith is trust in\r\nthe people. The Irish are keen politicians, and may be trusted to keep\r\nthings square.\"\r\n\r\nI submitted that the patriots were in the pay of the Irish-Americans,\r\nwho were no friends of England--\r\n\r\n\"The present Nationalist members are not purists, but to take money\r\nfor their services, to accept £300 a year is no more disgraceful than\r\nthe action of the Lord Chancellor who takes £10,000. The\r\nAmerican-Irish cherish a just resentment. They went away because they\r\nwere driven out of the country by the land system of that day. And the\r\nIrish people must be allowed to regenerate themselves. It cannot be\r\ndone by England. Better let them go to hell in their own way than\r\nattempt to spoon-feed them. But the injustice of former days does not\r\njustify the injustice to the landlords proposed by the present bill.\r\nIt is a bad bill, an unjust bill, and would do more harm than good.\r\nEngland should have a voice in fixing the price, for if the matter be\r\nleft to the Irish Parliament gross injustice will be done. The tenants\r\nwere buying their land, aided by the English loans, for they found\r\nthat their four per cent. interest came lower than their rent. But\r\nthey have quite ceased to buy, and for the stipulated three years will\r\npay their rent as usual, and why? Because they expect the Irish\r\nlegislature to give them even better terms--or even to get the land\r\nfor nothing. Retributive justice is satisfied. For the last twenty\r\nyears the landlords have suffered fearfully. The present bill is\r\nradically unsound, and I trust it will never become law.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this was all that the one specimen of a Protestant Home Ruler I\r\nhave found in Ireland could say in favour of his views! His\r\nintelligence and probity compelled him to denounce Mr. Gladstone's\r\nBill as \"unjust\" and radically unsound, and his patriotism caused him\r\nto pray that it might never become law! I left him more Unionist than\r\never.\r\n\r\nThe great Orange leader of Derry, Mr. John Guy Ferguson, once Grand\r\nRuler, and of world-wide fame, deprecated appeal to arms, except under\r\ndirest necessity. \"I should recommend resistance to all except the\r\nQueen's troops. Before all things a sincere loyalist, I should never\r\nconsent to fire a shot on them. Others think differently, and in case\r\nof pressure and excitement the most regrettable things might happen.\r\nThe people of Derry are full of their great victory of 1688, and\r\nbelieve that their one hundred and five days' resistance saved England\r\nfrom Catholic tyranny. The Bishop of Derry, as you know, had ordered\r\nthat the troops of King James should be admitted when the thirteen\r\nPrentice Boys closed the gate on the very nose of his army.\" I saw the\r\ntwo white standards taken from the Catholic troops flanking the high\r\naltar of the Cathedral; which also contains the grandly-carved case of\r\nan organ taken from a wreck of the Spanish Armada in 1588, just a\r\ncentury before the siege. The people have ever before them these\r\nwarlike spoils, which may account for their martial spirit. An old\r\nPrentice Boy told me of the great doings of 1870, how a Catholic\r\npublican, one O'Donnell, endeavoured to prevent the annual marching of\r\nthe Boys, who on the anniversary of the raising of the siege, parade\r\nthe walls, fire guns, and burn traitor Lundy in effigy; how 5,000 men\r\nin sleeve-waistcoats entered the town to stop the procession, how the\r\nmilitary intervened, and forbade both marching and burning; how the\r\nBoys seized the Town Hall, and in face of 1,700 soldiers and police\r\nburnt an effigy hanging from a high window, which the authorities\r\ncould not reach; how Colonel Hillier broke down the doors and stormed\r\nthe hall at the bayonet's point, to search both sexes for arms.\r\nGleefully he produced an alphabetical rhyme, which he thought rather\r\nappropriate to the present time, and which ended as follows:--\"X is\r\nthe excellent way they (the authorities) were beaten, and exceeding\r\namount of dirt they have eaten. Y is the yielding to blackguards\r\nunshorn, which cannot and will not much longer be borne. Z is the zeal\r\nwith which England put down the Protestant boys who stood up for the\r\ncrown.\" In 1883 Lord Mayor Dawson of Dublin wished to lecture at\r\nDerry, but the Boys took the Hall and held it, declining to permit the\r\n\"colleague of Carey\" (on the Dublin Town Council) to speak in the\r\ncity. There you have the present spirit of Derry.\r\n\r\nTwo miles outside the town I came on a fine Home Ruler, who had\r\nsomewhere failed to sell a pig. \"Sorra one o' me 'll do any good till\r\nwe get Home Rule.\" He paid £5 a year for two acres of land with a\r\nhouse. \"'Tis the one-half too much, Av I paid fifty shillings, I'd be\r\naisy,\" he said. Truly a small sum to stand between him and affluence.\r\nI failed to sympathise with this worthy man, but my spirits fell as I\r\nwalked through a collar factory, and thought of Mr. Gladstone. The\r\ndislocation of the shirt trade is less serious. Few Irish patriots\r\nhave any personal interest in this particular branch of industry.\r\n\r\nDublin, April 8th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BALFOUR IN DUBLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour is the most popular man in Ireland, and his Dublin visit\r\nwill be for ever memorable. The Leinster Hall, which holds several\r\nthousands, was packed by half-past five; ninety minutes before\r\nstarting time, and the multitude outside was of enormous proportions.\r\nThe people were respectable, quiet, good-humoured, as are Unionist\r\ncrowds in general, though it was plain that the Dubliners are more\r\ndemonstrative than the Belfast men. The line of police in Hawkins\r\nStreet had much difficulty in regulating the surging throng which\r\npressed tumultuously on the great entrance without the smallest hope\r\nof ever getting in. The turmoil of cheering and singing was incessant,\r\nand everyone seemed under the influence of pleasurable excitement. As\r\nyou caught the eye of any member of the crowd he would smile with a\r\n\"What-a-day-we're-having\" kind of expression. The college students\r\nwere in great form, cheering with an inexhaustible vigour, every man\r\nsmoking and carrying a \"thrifle iv a switch.\" Portraits of Mr. Balfour\r\nfound a ready sale, and Tussaud's great exhibition of waxworks next\r\ndoor to the hall was quite unable to compete with the living hero.\r\nMessrs. Burke and Hare, Parnell and Informer Carey, Tim Healy and\r\nBreeches O'Brien, Mr. Gladstone and Palmer the poisoner, with other\r\nbenefactors and philanthropists, were at a discount. The outsiders\r\nwere waiting to see Mr. Balfour, but they were disappointed. Lord\r\nIveagh's carriage suddenly appeared in Poolbeg Street at the\r\npressmen's entrance, and the hero slipped into the hall almost\r\nunobserved. Inside, the enthusiasm was tremendous. The building is\r\nplanned like the Birmingham Town Hall, and the leading features of the\r\nauditorium are similar. The orchestra was crowded to the ceiling, the\r\ngreat gallery was closely packed, the windows were occupied, and every\r\ninch of floor was covered. A band played \"God Save the Queen,\" \"Rule\r\nBritannia,\" and the \"Boyne Water.\" The word \"Union,\" followed by the\r\nnames of Balfour, Abercorn, Iveagh, Hartington, Chamberlain, and\r\nGoschen, was conspicuous on the side galleries, and over Mr. Balfour's\r\nhead was a great banner bearing the rose, thistle, and shamrock, with\r\nthe Union Jack and the English crown over all. Boldly-printed mottoes\r\nin scarlet and white, such as \"Quis Separabit?\" \"Union is strength,\"\r\n\"We Won't submit to Home Rule,\" and \"God Bless Balfour,\" abounded, and\r\nin the galleries and on the floor men waved the British flag. The\r\npeople listened to the band, or amused themselves with patriotic songs\r\nand Kentish fire, till Mr. Balfour arrived, when their cheering, loud\r\nand long, was taken up outside, and reverberated through the city.\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries being over, the principal speaker rose amid\r\nredoubled applause, which gradually subsided to the silence of intense\r\nexpectation. Mr. Balfour's first words fell like drops of water in a\r\nthirsty land, and never had a speaker a more eager, attentive,\r\nrespectful audience. Now and then stentorian shouts of assent\r\nencouraged him, but the listeners were mostly too much in earnest for\r\nnoise. It was plain that they meant business, and that the\r\ndemonstration was no mere empty tomfoolery. Parnellites were there--a\r\ndrop in the ocean--but their small efforts at interruption were\r\nsmilingly received. True, there was once a shout of \"Throw him out,\"\r\nbut a trumpet-like voice screamed \"Give him a wash, 'tis what he\r\nmostly needs, the crathur,\" upon which a roar of laughter proclaimed\r\nthat the offender was forgiven. The outsiders continued their singing\r\nand cheering, and when Mr. Balfour concluded sent up a shout the like\r\nof which Dublin has seldom heard, if ever. Succeeding speakers were\r\nwell received, the audience holding their ground. Mr. J. Hall, of\r\nCork, evoked great cheering by the affirmation that Protestants\r\ndesired no advantage, no privilege, unshared by their Catholic\r\nbrethren. Similar points made by other speakers met with an instant\r\nand hearty confirmation that was unmistakable. Lord Sligo pointed out\r\nthat firmness and integrity were nowhere better understood than in\r\nIreland, and said that while William O'Brien, the great Nationalist,\r\nvisited Cork under a powerful escort of police, who with the utmost\r\ndifficulty prevented the populace from tearing him to pieces; on the\r\nother hand, Mr. Balfour had passed through the length and breadth of\r\nthe land, visiting the poverty-stricken and disturbed districts of the\r\nWest, with no other protection beyond that afforded by \"his\r\ntender-hearted sister.\" Mr. Balfour rose to make a second speech, and\r\nthe enthusiasm reached its climax. The great ex-Secretary seemed\r\ntouched, and although speaking slowly showed more than his usual\r\nemotion. When he concluded the people sent up a shout such as England\r\nnever hears--an original shout, long drawn out on a high musical note,\r\nsomething like the unisonous tone of forty factory bulls.\r\n\r\nThe students went outside, and with their friends formed in military\r\ncolumns--the outside files well armed with knobby sticks as a\r\ndeterrent to possible Parnellite enterprise. An extemporised arch of\r\nUnion Jacks canopied Mr. Balfour in his carriage, which was drawn by\r\nhundreds of willing hands linked in long line. The column, properly\r\nmarshalled, moved away, keeping step amid loud shouts of \"Right, left,\r\nright, left,\" until perfect uniformity was attained, and the\r\ndisciplined force marched steadily on to College Green, following the\r\ntriumphal chariot with alternate verses of \"God Save the Queen\" and\r\n\"Rule Britannia,\" each verse interpolated with great bursts of\r\napplause. At Trinity College the glare of torches appeared, and\r\nsimultaneously an organised attempt at groaning boomed in under the\r\ncheering. Heedless of the rabble the column marched merrily on, not\r\nwith the broken rush of an English mob, but with the irresistible\r\nforce of unity in a concrete mass, with the multitudinous tramp of an\r\narmy division. The yelling slummers hovered on each flank, frantic\r\nwith impotent rage; willing to wound and yet afraid to strike, knowing\r\nthat to themselves open conflict meant annihilation. A savage,\r\nunsavoury horde of rat-like ruffians, these same allies of Mr.\r\nGladstone and Mr. Morley, a peculiarly repulsive residuum these Dublin\r\noff-scourings. They screamed \"To hell with Balfour,\" \"To hell with the\r\nEnglish,\" \"To hell with your Unionists,\" \"To hell with Queen\r\nVictoria.\" Some of them sang a doggerel, beginning:--\r\n\r\n    Let the English remember,\r\n    We'll make them surrender,\r\n    And chase them to their boats,\r\n    And cut their ---- throats,\r\n    And make a big flood\r\n    Of their bad black blood--\r\n\r\nnot precisely a poem to herald the famous \"Union of hearts\" so\r\nconfidently expected. The Unionists tramped on cheering triumphantly,\r\nrejoicing in their strength, ignoring the taunting and jeering of the\r\nParnellite scum as beneath contempt. An old Home Ruler expressed\r\ndisapprobation of his party. \"What's the use of showing your teeth\r\nwhen you can't bite?\" he said. \"Wait till we get the bill and then we\r\nwill show them and the English what we can do.\"\r\n\r\nOn through Grafton Street, Nassau Street, and into Dawson Street,\r\nalways with great shouting and singing of \"God Save the Queen,\" and\r\n\"Rule Britannia,\" the torches still glaring in front. At Morrisson's\r\nHotel, where Parnell was arrested, a man shouted \"Three cheers for\r\nGladstone,\" but nobody responded. The rabble may use him, but they\r\nrefused a single shout. On the other hand groans were given with\r\nleonine force both for Morley and his master. Arrived at St. Stephen's\r\nGreen, the procession halted at Lord Iveagh's residence, and Mr.\r\nBalfour came on the balcony, receiving a welcome right royal. He made\r\nanother speech amid cheering and groaning of tremendous energy, making\r\nhimself tolerably well heard under abnormal conditions. When he said\r\n\"This day shall never fade from my recollection,\" the lamp beside him\r\nwas removed and all was over. Back tramped the column, with its clouds\r\nof camp-followers, on the way cheering and sending to hell the member\r\nfor South Tyrone, with other prominent politicians who live on the\r\nline of march. The students held their sticks aloft, striking them\r\ntogether in time to their singing. A shindy had been predicted on the\r\nreturn to College Green, and little groups of Scots Greys and Gordon\r\nHighlanders, the latter in their white uniforms, lounged about smoking\r\ntheir pipes in happy expectation, but beyond cheering at the statue of\r\nOrange William in Dame Street, nothing whatever occurred, and\r\npresently the crowd began to disperse. Seeing this, the police, who\r\nuntil now had been massed in strong force broke up into units, and\r\nmoving leisurely about said, \"Good night, boys; you have had enough\r\nfun for one day. Get to bed, all of you.\" Then the young men who had\r\ncomposed the great loyalist column left the square in little bands,\r\neach singing \"God save the Queen,\" and every man feeling that he had\r\ndeserved well of his country. The bill may be stone dead, but there is\r\na satisfaction in the act of shovelling earth on the corpse.\r\n\r\nDublin, April 8th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 7.--BAD FOR ENGLAND, RUINOUS TO IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nHome Rule for Ireland means damage and loss to English working men.\r\nDuring the late general election the working men candidates of\r\nBirmingham, and of England generally, argued that once Ireland were\r\ngranted Home Rule the distressful land would immediately become a\r\nGarden of Eden, a sort of Hibernian El-Dorado; that the poverty which\r\ndrove Irishmen from their native shores would at once and for ever\r\ncease and determine, and that thenceforth--and here was the\r\nbribe--Irishmen would cease to compete with the overcrowded artisans\r\nand labourers of England. That these statements are diametrically\r\nopposed to the truth is well known to all persons of moderate\r\nintelligence, and the personal statement of several great capitalists\r\nwith reference to their course of action in the event of Home Rule\r\nbecoming law tends to show that multitudes of the industrious classes\r\nof Irish manufacturing towns will at once be thrown out of employment,\r\nand must of necessity flock to England, increasing the congestion of\r\nits great cities, competing with English labour, and inevitably\r\nlowering the rate of wages. Hear what comfortable words Mr. Robert\r\nWorthington can speak.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington is no politician; never has interfered with party\r\nquestions; has always confined his attention to his business affairs.\r\nIt was because of this that Mr. Balfour sent for him to confer anent\r\nthe light railways, which have proved such a blessing to the country.\r\nIt was Mr. Worthington who carried out most of these beneficent works.\r\nBesides this, Mr. Worthington has built railways to the amount of\r\nthree-quarters of a million in Ireland alone. He has employed 5,300\r\nmen at one time, and his regular average exceeds 1,500 all the year\r\nround. He may therefore be said to know what he is talking about. I\r\ncalled on him at 30, Dame Street, before I left Dublin, and he said,\r\n\"The bill would be bad for England in every way, and would ruin\r\nIreland. The question is certainly one for the English working man. If\r\nhe wishes to avoid the competition of armies of Irish labourers and\r\nartisans he must throw out the bill. And this is how it will work--\r\n\r\n\"All the railways I have constructed in Ireland have been built on\r\ncounty guarantees assisted by special grants from the Imperial\r\nTreasury. Without these special grants the work could never have been\r\nundertaken at all. If Home Rule becomes law those special grants from\r\nthe Imperial Treasury will be no longer available; and what will be\r\nthe result? Clearly that the work will not be undertaken; that the\r\nbuilding of railways will come to an end, and that the Irish peasants\r\nwho have devoted themselves to railway work will go to England and try\r\nto find employment there. Once a railway navvy, always a railway\r\nnavvy, is a well-known and very true saying.\r\n\r\n\"For my own part I shall be compelled to compete in England, having\r\nnothing to do in Ireland, and I shall of course transport my staff and\r\nlabourers across the Channel.\r\n\r\n\"The railways of Ireland, fostered by English capital, resting on\r\nEngland's security, have given vast employment to my countrymen. But\r\nthey would do so no longer. Let us give an example to prove my point.\r\n\r\n\"Before the introduction of the Home Rule Bill the railway stock to\r\nwhich I have referred stood at a premium of 27 per cent. Since the\r\nbill became public and has been the subject of popular discussion, I\r\nbrought out the Ballinrobe and Claremorris Railway--with what result?\r\nNot one-seventh of the sum required has been subscribed, although in\r\nthe absence of the bill the amount would certainly have been\r\nsubscribed four times over, at a premium of 20 per cent. What does\r\nthis prove?\r\n\r\n\"Simply this--that the farmers and small shopkeepers who invest in\r\nthis class of security will not trust their savings in the hands of\r\nthe proposed Irish Legislature. The bill, therefore, stops progress,\r\nretards enterprise, drives away capital, and the workers must follow\r\nthe money. That seems clear enough. Everybody here concedes so much.\r\nMore than this. I can say from my own experience, and from the reports\r\nof my agents and engineers in the South and West of Ireland, that the\r\nNationalists do not want this bill. I do not speak of Home Rule, but\r\nof this bill only. All condemn its provisions, and universally concur\r\nin the opinion that once it were passed it would be succeeded by a\r\nmore violent agitation than anything we have yet seen--an agitation\r\nhaving for its object the radical amendment of the measure.\r\n\r\n\"There is a complete cessation of railway work. Already the men are\r\nthinking of moving. But this is not all. I am now at a standstill,\r\npulled up short by the bill. What is the effect on England? Under\r\nordinary circumstances I buy largely all kinds of railway\r\nmaterial--steel rails, sleepers, fasteners, engines, and carriages.\r\nEvery year I send thousands and thousands of pounds to England for\r\nthese things, and surely most of the money goes indirectly into the\r\npockets of English working men, who are now suffering the loss of all\r\nthis by reason of their apathy in this matter. I speak only as a man\r\nof business, anxious for the prosperity of my country. I do not\r\ndiscuss Home Rule; never did discuss it and never will. But I end\r\nwhere I began, and I repeat the bill will ruin Ireland, will be bad\r\nfor England, and I will add that the British Government will soon be\r\ncompelled to intervene to stave off Irish bankruptcy. Home Rulers are\r\nnow becoming afraid of the bill; artisans, farmers, and labourers\r\nthink it a good joke. They relished the hunt, but they don't want the\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n\"Returning to my own affairs, I say without hesitation that though the\r\nmere threat of the bill has paralysed my business, and that the\r\npassing of the bill would drive my men to England, yet--throw out the\r\nbill, deliver us from the impending dread, and during the next two\r\nyears I shall myself expend £150,000 in railway material manufactured\r\nby British artisans. Emphatically I repeat that Home Rule to the\r\nBritish working man means increased competition and direct pecuniary\r\nloss.\"\r\n\r\nMr. S. McGregor, of 30, Anglesea Street, Dublin, has been located in\r\nthe city for 34 years, and seems to have been a politician from the\r\nfirst. Coming from the Land o' Cakes, he landed an advanced Radical,\r\nand a devoted admirer of the Grand Auld Mon. Once on the spot a change\r\ncame o'er the spirit of his dream. His shop has the very unusual\r\nfeature of indicating his political views. Her Gracious Majesty, Lord\r\nBeaconsfield, and Mr. Balfour look down upon you from neat frames. I\r\nam disposed to regard Mr. McGregor as the pluckiest man in Ireland. A\r\nquiet, peaceful citizen he is, one who remembers the Sawbath, and on\r\nweekdays concentrates his faculties on his occupation as a tailor and\r\nclothier. I did not seek the interview, which arose from a business\r\ncall not altogether unconnected with a missing button, but his\r\nopinions and his information are well worth recording. Mr. McGregor\r\nsaid, \"I thrust my opinions on none, but I have a right to my\r\nopinions, and I do not affect concealment. The great defect of the\r\nIrish Unionists is want of courage. They dare not for their lives come\r\nforward and boldly state their convictions. If Lord Emly or some other\r\nIrish Roman Catholic nobleman had come forward earlier, it might have\r\ninduced weak-kneed members of the party to do likewise. The Unionists\r\ndo not exercise the great influence they undoubtedly possess. They\r\nallow themselves to be terrorised into silence. Let them have the\r\ncourage of their opinions and they have nothing to fear. The masses of\r\nthe industrial population are not in favour of Home Rule. The\r\ncorner-men, who want to spend what they never earned, and the farmers,\r\nwho hope to get the land for nothing, are the only hearty Home Rulers\r\nin Ireland. I employ ten people, all Roman Catholics, some of them\r\nwith me for twenty-five years. None of these are Home Rulers. I became\r\na convert to Conservatism by my intimate knowledge and personal\r\nacquaintance with many of the leaders of the Fenian movement. I saw\r\nthrough the hollowness of the whole thing, and declined any connection\r\ntherewith. Poor Henry Rowles, who was to be told off by signal to\r\nshoot Mr. Foster, was one of my workmen. He died in prison, some said\r\nfrom sheer fright, but two or three of his friends were hanged. He was\r\nmixed up by marriage with the Fenian party, and was drawn on and on\r\nlike many another. I would rather not name the Fenian leaders I knew,\r\nand the reason is this. I knew them too well. Speaking of the Unionist\r\nlack of courage, you must not be too much surprised. During the last\r\nfourteen years Unionists have had to maintain a guerilla warfare for\r\nexistence. But the strangest feature of the present position is\r\nthis--the Home Rulers are kicking at the bill! A great Home Ruler of\r\nmy acquaintance (Mr. McGregor referred me to him) is getting quite\r\nafraid. He is a farmer holding 300 acres under Lord Besborough, and\r\nsays that he trusts things will remain as they are. He has a good\r\nlandlord, borrows money by the subvention, and has a perfect horror\r\nof the class of men who will obtain the upper hand in Ireland. A\r\nNationalist over the way was about to extend the buildings you see\r\nthere. Plans were drafted, and offices were to be built. Out comes the\r\nbill and in goes the project. He has no confidence in the Irish\r\nNationalist leaders; but, strange to say he believes in Mr. Gladstone.\r\nHe admits that the Irish M.P.'s are not quite up to his ideal, but\r\nbelieves that the Grand Old Man's genius for accommodation and\r\ningenious dovetailing of Imperial interests will pull the country\r\nthrough. Meanwhile he lays out no penny of money.\r\n\r\n\"I am a Presbyterian, and what is more a United Presbyterian,\r\nbelonging to the Presbyter of Scotland. All Scotch Presbyterians are\r\nadvanced Radicals. We have four hundred members here. They came here\r\nworshippers of Gladstone and Home Rulers to the tune of 97 per cent.\r\nThe congregation is now 99 per cent. Unionist or Conservative out and\r\nout. Of the four hundred we have only three Home Rulers. What will the\r\nEnglish people say to that? Tell them that our minister, who came here\r\na Home Ruler, is now on a Unionist mission in Scotland--the Rev. Mr.\r\nProcter, brother of Procter, the cartoonist of _Moonshine_ and the\r\n_Sketch_, to wit. My workpeople, all steady, industrious people, ask\r\nbut one thing--it is to be let alone.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. G.M. Roche, the great Irish wool-factor and famous amateur\r\nphotographer, said--\r\n\r\n\"Ah! we must have the bill. 'Tis all we want to finish us up. We're\r\nnever happy unless we're miserable; the bill will make us so and we'll\r\nnever be properly discontented till we get it!\"\r\n\r\nPassing through the Counties of Louth, Dublin, Londonderry, Monaghan,\r\nTyrone, Donegal, and Fermanagh, I met with many farmers whose\r\nstatements amply confirmed the words of the descendant of the great\r\nSir Boyle Roche. These unhappy men had been divested of their last\r\ngrievance, stripped of their burning wrongs, heartlessly robbed of\r\ntheir long-cherished injuries. It was bad enough before, when Irishmen\r\nhad nothing except grievances, but at least they had these, handed\r\ndown from father to son, from generation to generation, along with the\r\nfamily physiognomy, two precious, priceless heirlooms, remarkable as\r\nbeing the only hereditary possessions upon which the brutal Saxon\r\nfailed to cast his blood-shot, covetous eye. And now the grievances\r\nare taken away, the _Lares_ and _Penates_ of the farmer's cabin are\r\nruthlessly removed, and the melancholy peasant looks around for the\r\nimmaterial antiquities bequeathed by his long-lost forefathers. \"Ah;\r\ndon't the days seem lank and long, When all goes right and nothing\r\ngoes wrong, And isn't our life extremely flat, When we've nothing\r\nwhatever to grumble at.\" The Irish farmer is with the poet, who hits\r\nhis harrowing anguish to a hair. He folds his hands and looks about,\r\nuncertain what to do next. His rent has been lowered by 35 per cent.,\r\nhe has compensation for improvements, fixity of tenure, and may borrow\r\nmoney to buy the land outright at a percentage, which will amount to\r\nless than his immortal Rint. What is the unhappy man to do? His\r\ngrievances have been his sole theme from boyhood's happy days, the\r\nbasis of his conversation, his actuating motive, the very backbone of\r\nhis personal entity. Now they are gone, the fine gold has become dim,\r\nand the weapons of war have perished. Once he could walk abroad with\r\nthe proud consciousness that he was a wronged man, a martyr, a brave\r\npatriot struggling nobly against the adverse fates, a broth of a boy,\r\nwhose melancholy position was noted by the gods, and whose manly\r\nbearing under proffered slavery established a complete claim to high\r\nconsideration in Olympus. But now, with heart bowed down with grief\r\nand woe, he walks heavily, and even as a man who mourneth for his\r\nmother, over the enfranchised unfamiliar turf. He peeps into the\r\nbog-hole, and does not recognise himself. He could pay the rent twice\r\nover, but he hates conventionalities, and would rather keep the money.\r\nHe is constructed to run on grievances, and in no other grooves, and\r\nthe strangeness of his present position is embarrassing. The tenants\r\nof Lord Leitrim, Lord Lifford, and the Duke of Abercorn make no\r\ncomplaint of their landlords. On the contrary, they distinctly state\r\nthat all are individually kind and reasonable men, and while\r\nattributing their own improved position to the various Land Acts given\r\nto Ireland, which leave the actual possessor of the land small option\r\nin the matter, they freely admit that these gentlemen willingly do\r\nmore than is ordained by any act of Parliament, and that over and\r\nabove the provisions of the law, all three are fair-minded men,\r\ndesirous of doing the right thing by their people and the country at\r\nlarge. Other landlords there were on whose devoted heads were breathed\r\ncurses both loud and deep.\r\n\r\nThe late Lord Leitrim was exalted to the skies, but his murdered\r\nfather was visited with blackest malediction. At Clones, in the County\r\nMonaghan, I met a sort of roadside specimen of the _Agricola\r\nHibernicus_, who explained his position thus:--\"Ye see, we wor\r\nrayduced 35 per cent., an' 'tis thrue what ye say; but then produce is\r\nrayduced 50 per cent., so we're 15 per cent. worse off than iver we\r\nwor before. We want another Land Act that'll go to the root. An' that\r\nwe'll get from an Oirish Parliament an' only from that. 'Tis not the\r\ntinints that's always the worst off. Many's the time I seen thim that\r\nhad a farrum of their own go to the dogs, while thim that had rint to\r\npay sthruggled and sthrived an' made money an' bought the freeholders\r\nout. For whin they had nothin' to pay they did no work, an' then,\r\nbedad ivery mortial thing wint to the divil. An' that's how it'll be\r\nwid the lazy ones once we get Home Rule, which means the land for\r\nnothin' or next to nothin'. Barney will kick up his heels and roar\r\nwhirroo, but call again in a year an' ye'll see he hasn't enough money\r\nto jingle on a tombstone.\"\r\n\r\nMy next from the New Tipperary, whither I journey viâ Kildare,\r\nKilkenny, and Limerick, _en route_ for Cork and the Blood-taxed Kerry,\r\nwhere Kerry cows are cut and carved. Now meditation on marauding\r\nmoonlighters makes melancholy musing mine.\r\n\r\nLimerick, April 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 8.--TERRORISM AT TIPPERARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTipperary is Irish, and no mistake. Walking into town from Limerick\r\nthe first dwellings you reach are of the most primitive description,\r\nwhether regarded as to sanitary arrangements or otherwise. The ground\r\nto the right slopes downwards, and the cabins are built with sloping\r\nfloors. The architects of these aboriginal erections stuck up four\r\nbrick walls, a hole in, a hole out, and a hole in the top, without\r\ntroubling to level the ground. Entering, you take a downward step, and\r\nif you walk to the opposite exit, you will need to hold on to the\r\nfurniture, if any. If you slip on the front step you will fall head\r\nfirst into the back yard, and though your landing might be soft\r\nenough, it would have a nameless horror, far more killing than a stony\r\nfall. The women stand about frowsy and unkempt, with wild Irish eyes,\r\nall wearing the shawl as a hood, many in picturesque tatters, like the\r\ncast-off rags of a scarecrow, rags and flesh alike unwashed and of\r\nevil odour. The children look healthy and strong, though some of them\r\nare almost _in puris naturalibus_. Their faces are washed once a week;\r\none of them said so, but the statement lacks confirmation, and is\r\nopposed to the evidence of the senses. Scenes like these greet the\r\nvisitor to Old Tipperary, that is, Tipperary proper, if he enter from\r\nLimerick. The town is said to be old, and in good sooth the dunghills\r\nseem to possess a considerable antiquity. In this matter the Tipperary\r\nmen are sentimental enough--conservative enough for anything. At\r\nTipperary, of all places, the brutal Saxon will learn how much has\r\nbeen bequeathed to Irishmen by their mighty forefathers.\r\n\r\nThe eastern side is better. A grand new Roman Catholic church has just\r\nbeen built at a cost of £25,000, and in front of the gilded\r\nrailings--for they are gilt like the railings of Paris--were dreadful\r\nold women, like Macbethian witches, holding out their skinny hands for\r\nalms. Smartly dressed young ladies, daughters of publicans and\r\nshopkeepers, passed in jauntily, took a splash in the holy water,\r\ncrossed themselves all over, knocked off a few prayers, and tripped\r\nmerrily away. The better parts of the town belong to Mr. Smith-Barry,\r\nthe knock-me-down cabins to Mr. Stafford O'Brien, whose system is\r\ndifferent. As the leases fall in the former has modern houses built,\r\nwhile the latter is in the hands of the middlemen, who sub-let the\r\nhouses, and leave things to slide. The _laissez-aller_ policy is very\r\nsuitable to the genius of the genuine Irish, who may be said to rule\r\nthe roost in Tipperary.\r\n\r\nI interviewed all sorts and conditions of men, but every individual\r\nbound me down to closest secrecy. And although nobody said anything\r\napproaching high treason, their alarm on finding they had ventured to\r\nexpress to a stranger anything like their real opinion was very\r\nsignificant. The conversations took place last evening, and this\r\nmorning before breakfast a young man called on me at the Station\r\nHotel, Limerick Junction, three miles from Tipperary, \"on urgent\r\nbusiness.\" \"Me father thinks he said too much, an' that ye moight put\r\nwhat he said in print, wid his name to it. Ye promised ye wouldn't,\r\nan' me father has confidence, but he wishes to remoind ye that there's\r\nplinty in Tipperary would curse him for spakin' wid an Englishman, an'\r\nthat dozens of thim would murther him or you for the price of a pot of\r\nporter.\" Another messenger shortly arrived, bearing a letter in which\r\nthe writer said that any mention of his name would simply ruin him,\r\nand that he might leave the country at once. And yet these men had\r\nonly said what Englishmen would account as nothing.\r\n\r\nNew Tipperary adjoins the old, to which it is on the whole superior.\r\nAll the descriptions I have seen of the Land League buildings are\r\nuntrue and unfair. Most of them were written by men who never saw the\r\nplace, and who paraphrased and perpetuated the original error. It was\r\ndescribed as a \"mile or two from Tipperary,\" and the buildings were\r\ncalled \"tumble-down shanties of wood, warped and decaying, already\r\nfalling to pieces.\" The place adjoins and interlocks with the old\r\ntown; it is not separated by more than the breadth of a street, is\r\nlargely built of stone, and comprises a stone arcade, which alone cost\r\nmany thousands. Some of the cottages are of wood, but they look well,\r\nare slated, and seem in good condition. The butter mart, a post and\r\nrail affair, with barbed wire decorations, is desolate enough, and\r\nnearly all the shops are shuttered. Enamel plates with Dillon Street\r\nand Emmett Street still attest the glory that has departed, but the\r\nplate bearing Parnell Street escaped my research. The William O'Brien\r\nArcade is scattered to the winds, save and except the sturdy stone\r\nwalls, which (_à la_ Macaulay's New-Zealander) I surveyed with\r\nsatisfaction, sketching the ruins of the structure from a broken bench\r\nin Dillon Street.\r\n\r\nA full and true history of the New Tipperary venture has never been\r\nwritten. As in the present juncture the story is suggestive and\r\ninstructive, I will try to submit the whole in a form at once concise\r\nand accurate. The particulars have been culled with great pains from\r\nmany quarters and carefully collated on the spot, and may be relied on\r\nas minutely exact and undeniable. Everyone admits Mr. Smith-Barry's\r\nclaim to the title of a good landlord, an excellent landlord, one of a\r\nthousand. Before the _casus belli_ was found by William O'Brien all\r\nwas prosperity, harmony, and peace. Mr. Smith-Barry owns about 5,000\r\nacres of land situate in the fat and fertile plain of Tipperary, known\r\nas the Golden Vale, with the best part of the county town itself.\r\nTipperary is a great butter centre. The people are ever driving to the\r\nbutter factory, which seemed to be worked in the Brittany way.\r\nDonkey-carts driven by women, and bearing barrels of milk, abound on\r\nthe Limerick Road. The land is so rich, grand meadows, and heavy\r\ndairy-ground, that the place prospered abundantly, and was by\r\ncommercial men reckoned an excellent place for business. But they have\r\nchanged all that. The Tipperary folks were once thought as good as\r\nthe Bank of England. Now they dislike to pay anything or anybody.\r\nTheir delicate sense of _meum_ and _tuum_ is blunted. They take all\r\nthey can get, and pay as little as they can. They affect dunghills and\r\ndirt, and have a natural affinity for battle, murder, and sudden\r\ndeath. How did all this come about?\r\n\r\nFirst, as to Mr. Smith-Barry's character. The most advanced\r\nNationalists, the Fenian papers, the Catholic clergy, all concurred in\r\nblessing him. The Roman Catholic Bishop of Cloyne, Canon Hegarty,\r\nP.P., and Tim Healy spoke of him in the character of a landlord in\r\nhighest terms. Sir Charles Russell, Tim Harrington, Mr. O'Leary\r\n(Chairman of the Clonakilty Town Commissioners, a violent\r\nNationalist), and Canon Keller (R.C.) unanimously agreed that Mr.\r\nSmith-Barry must be exempted from the general condemnation of Irish\r\nlandlords. They said he was the \"kindest of landlords,\" and that his\r\ntenants were \"comfortable, respectable, and happy.\" They proclaimed\r\nhis \"generous and noble deeds,\" declaring that \"there have been no\r\ncases of oppression or hardship, and the best and most kindly\r\nrelations have existed.\" All these sayings are gathered from\r\nNationalist papers, which would supply thousands of similar character,\r\nand up to the time of O'Brien's interference, none of an opposite\r\nsort. But, as Serjeant Buzfuz would have said, the serpent was on the\r\ntrail, the viper was on the hearthstone, the sapper and miner was at\r\nwork. Thanks to the patriot's influence, the Paradise was soon to\r\nbecome an Inferno.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Ponsonby wanted his rents, or part of them. His tenants had\r\nlived rent-free for so long--some of them were seven years\r\nbehind--that they naturally resented the proposed innovation. Mr.\r\nSmith-Barry and others came to Mr. Ponsonby's assistance, and,\r\nendeavouring to settle the thing by arbitration, proposed that the\r\nlandlord should knock off £22,000 of arrears, should make reductions\r\nof 24 to 34 per cent. in the rents, and make the tenants absolute\r\nowners in 49 years. This was not good enough. Judge Gibson thought it\r\n\"extravagantly generous,\" but the Tipperary folks resented Mr.\r\nSmith-Barry's connection with such a disgracefully tyrannical piece of\r\nbusiness, and, at the instance of William O'Brien, determined to make\r\nhim rue the day he imagined it. They sent a deputation to remonstrate,\r\nand Mr. Smith-Barry, while adhering to his opinion as to the\r\nliberality of the proposition, explained that he was only one of many,\r\nand that whatever he said or did would not change the course of\r\nevents. The Tipperary folks required him to repudiate the arrangement,\r\nto turn his back on his friend and himself, and--here is the cream of\r\nthe whole thing, this is deliciously Irish--they soberly, seriously,\r\nand officially proposed to Mr. Smith-Barry that in addition to the 15\r\nper cent. abatement they had just received on their rent he should\r\nmake a further remittance of 10 per cent. to enable them to assist the\r\nPonsonby tenants in carrying on the war against their landlord, on\r\nwhose side Mr. Smith-Barry was fighting. They said in effect, \"You\r\nhave given us 3s. in the pound, to which we had no claim; now we want\r\n2s. more, to enable us to smash the landlord combination, of which you\r\nare the leader.\" This occurred in the proceedings of a business\r\ndeputation, and not in a comic opera.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith-Barry failed to see the sweet reasonableness of this\r\ndelightful proposition, and then the fun began.\r\n\r\nO'Brien to the rescue, whirroo!\r\n\r\nHe rushed from Dublin, and told the Tipperary men to pay Smith-Barry\r\nno rent. If they paid a penny they were traitors, slaves, murderers,\r\nfelons, brigands, and bosthoons. If they refused to pay they were\r\npatriots, heroes, angels, cherubim and seraphim, the whole country\r\nwould worship them, they would powerfully assist the Ponsonby folks in\r\nthe next county, they would be saviours of Ireland.\r\n\r\nAnd besides all this they would keep the money in their pockets. But\r\nthis was a mere detail.\r\n\r\nThe people took O'Brien's advice, withholding Mr. Smith-Barry's rent,\r\nkeeping in their purses what was due to him, in order that somebody's\r\ntenants in the next county might get better terms. Still Mr.\r\nSmith-Barry held out, and the Land League determined to make of him a\r\nterrible example. He owned most of the town. Happy thought! let the\r\nshopkeepers leave his hated tenements. Let their habitations be\r\ndesolate and no man to dwell in their tents. The Land League can build\r\nanother Tipperary over the way, the tenants can hop across, and Mr.\r\nSmith-Barry will be left in the lurch! The end, it was thought, would\r\njustify the means, and some sacrifice was expected. Things would not\r\nwork smoothly at first. The homes of their fathers were void; new\r\ndunghills, comparatively flavourless, had to be made, the old\r\naccretions, endeared by ancestral associations, had to be abandoned,\r\nand the old effluvium weakened by distance was all that was left to\r\nthem. The new town was off the main line of trade and traffic, but it\r\nwas thought that these, with the old Tipperary odour, would come in\r\ntime. Streets and marts were built by the Land League at a cost of\r\n£20,000 or more. The people moved away, but they soon moved back\r\nagain. The shopkeepers could do no business, so with bated breath and\r\nwhispering humbleness they returned to Mr. Smith-Barry. The mart was\r\ndeclared illegal, and the old one was re-opened. But while the\r\nagitation continued, the town was possessed by devils. Terrorism and\r\noutrage abounded on every side. The local papers published the names\r\nof men who dared to avow esteem for Mr. Smith-Barry, or who were\r\nsupposed to favour his cause. The Tipperary boys threw bombshells into\r\ntheir houses, pigeon-holed their windows with stones, threw blasts of\r\ngun-powder with burning fuses into their homes. They were pitilessly\r\nboycotted, and a regular system of spies watched their goings out and\r\ntheir comings in. If they were shopkeepers everything was done to\r\ninjure them, and people who patronised them were not only placed on\r\nthe Black List but were assaulted on leaving the shops, and their\r\npurchases taken by violence and destroyed. Broken windows and threats\r\nof instant death were so common as to be unworthy of mention, and the\r\nhundred extra armed policemen who were marched into the town were\r\nutterly powerless against the prevailing rowdyism of the Nationalist\r\nparty. Honest men were coerced into acting as though dishonest, and\r\none unfortunate man, who had in a moment of weakness paid\r\nhalf-a-year's rent, pitifully besought Mr. Smith-Barry's agent to sue\r\nhim along with the rest, and declared he would rather pay it over\r\nagain than have it known that the money had been paid. \"Ye can pay a\r\nyear's gale for six months, but ye can't rise again from the dead,\"\r\nsaid this pious victim to circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt last the leaders were prosecuted, but before this the Boys had\r\ngreat divarshun. These good Gladstonians, these ardent Home Rulers,\r\nthese patriotic purists, these famous members of the sans-shirt\r\nSeparatist section, set no limits to their sacrifices in the Good\r\nCause, stuck at nothing that would exemplify their determination to\r\nbring about the Union of Hearts, were resolved to take their light\r\nfrom under a bushel and set it in a candlestick. They wrecked many\r\nhouses and sorely beat the inmates. They burnt barns, and stacks, and\r\nhomesteads, and in one case a poor man's donkey-cart with its load of\r\noats. They exploded in people's homes metal boxes, leaden pipes, and\r\nglass bottles containing gun-powder, in such numbers as to be beyond\r\nreckoning. They burnt the doors and window sashes of the empty houses,\r\nknocked people down at dark corners with heavy bludgeons, and fired\r\nshots into windows by way of adding zest to the family hearth. Poor\r\nJohn Quinlan escaped five shots, all fired into his house. Mr. Bell,\r\nof Pegsboro, beat this record with six. He was _believed_ to\r\nsympathise with Mr. Smith-Barry! Men with white masks pervaded the\r\nvicinity from the gentle gloaming till the witching morn, and woe to\r\nthe weak among their opponents, or even among the neutrals, whom they\r\nmight meet on their march!\r\n\r\nThe tenants were great losers. A commercial man from Dublin assured me\r\nthat the agitation cost him £2,000 in bad debts. The people were\r\ninconvenienced, unsettled, permanently demoralised, their peaceful\r\nrelations rudely interrupted, themselves and their commercial\r\nconnections more or less discredited and injured, and the whole\r\nprosperous community impoverished, by the machinations of O'Brien and\r\nBishop Croke of Thurles, a few miles away. The inferior clergy were of\r\ncourse in their element. Father Humphreys and others were notorious\r\nfor the violence of their language. Gladstonians who think Home Rule\r\nheralds the millennium, and who babble of brotherly love, should note\r\nthe neat speech of good Father Haynes, who said, \"We would, if we\r\ncould, pelt them not only with dynamite, but with the lightnings of\r\nheaven and the fires of hell, till every British bulldog, whelp, and\r\ncur would be pulverised and made top-dressing for the soil.\" This is\r\nthe feeling of the priests, and the people are under the priestly\r\nthumb. That this is so is proved by recent events in Dublin. None but\r\nthe Parnellites could make head against the Catholic Party. In the\r\nrecent conflict the Parnellites were squelched. Tim Healy kicked and\r\nbit, but Bishop Walsh got him on the ropes, and Tim \"went down to\r\navoid punishment.\" The priest holds Tim in the hollow of his hand. Tim\r\nand his tribe must be docile, must answer to the whistle, must keep to\r\nheel, or they will feel the lash. Should they rebel, their\r\nconstituencies, acting on priestly orders, will cast them out as\r\nunclean, and their occupation, the means by which they live, will be\r\ngone. Tim and his congeries hate the clerics, but they fear the\r\nflagellum. They loathe their chains, but they must grin and bear them.\r\nThey have no choice between that and political extinction.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of Tipperary men on the question of religious toleration\r\nis practically unanimous. Pass Home Rule and the Protestants must\r\nperforce clear out. As it is, they are entirely excluded from any\r\nelective position, their dead are hooted in the streets, their funeral\r\nservices are mocked and derided by a jeering crowd. The other day a\r\nman was fined for insulting the venerable Protestant pastor of\r\nCappawhite, near Tipperary, while the old man was peacefully\r\nconducting the burial service of a member of his congregation. Foul\r\noaths and execrations being meekly accepted without protest, a more\r\nenterprising Papist struck the pastor with a sod of turf, for which he\r\nwas punished. But, returning to our muttons, let me conclude with\r\nthree important points:\r\n\r\n(1) Mr. Smith-Barry built the Town Hall of Tipperary at a cost of\r\n£3,000, and gave the use thereof to the Town Commissioners for\r\nnothing. He spent £1,000 on a butter weigh-house, £500 on a market\r\nyard, and tidied up the green at a cost of £300. He gave thirty acres\r\nof land for a park, and the ground for the Catholic Cathedral. He\r\noffered the land for a Temperance Hall (I think he promised to build\r\nit), on condition that it was not used as a political meeting-house.\r\nThe Catholic Bishop declined to accede to this, and the project was\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\n(2) Several dupes of the Land League, for various outrages, were\r\nsentenced to punishment varying from one year's hard labour to seven\r\nyears' penal servitude.\r\n\r\n(3) O'Brien, M.P., and Dillon, M.P., who had brought about the\r\ntrouble, were with others convicted of conspiracy, and were sentenced\r\nto six months' imprisonment. But this was in their absence, for soon\r\nafter the trial commenced, being released on bail, they ran away,\r\nputting the salt sea between themselves and their deservings. Heroes\r\nand martyrs of Ireland, of whom the brutal Briton hears so much,\r\nreceive these patriots into your glorious company!\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Tipperary is ever the same. No open hostility now, but\r\nthe fires of fanaticism are only smouldering, and only a breath is\r\nneeded to revive the flame. Every Protestant I saw, and all the\r\nintelligent and enlightened Catholics, concur that this is so, and\r\nthat Home Rule would supply the needful impulse. These men also submit\r\nthat they understand the matter better than Mr. Gladstone and his\r\npatch-work party.\r\n\r\nTipperary April 12th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 9.--TYRANNY AND TERRORISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peasantry and small shopkeepers of this district can only be\r\ncaptured by stratagem, and this for two reasons. Their native\r\npoliteness makes them all things to all men, and their fear of\r\nconsequences is ever before them. Their caution is not the Scotsman's\r\ningrained discretion, but rather the result of an ever-present fear.\r\nEnglish working men of directly opposite politics chum together in\r\ngood fellowship, harbouring no animosity, agreeing to differ in a\r\nfriendly way. It is not so in Ireland. The Irish labourer is\r\ndifferently situated. He dare not think for himself, and to boldly\r\nspeak his mind would mean unknown misfortunes, affecting the liberty\r\nand perhaps the lives of himself and those nearest and dearest to him.\r\nThat is, of course, assuming that his opinions were not approved by\r\nthe village ruffians who watch his every movement, of whom he stands\r\nin deadly terror, and whom he dreads as almost divining his most\r\nsecret thoughts. A direct query as to present politics would fail in\r\nevery case. As well try to catch Thames trout with a bent pin, or\r\nshoot snipe with a bow and arrow. My plan has been to lounge about\r\nbrandishing a big red guide-book, a broad-brimmed hat, and an American\r\naccent; speaking of antiquities, shortest roads to famous spots,\r\noccasionally shmoking my clay dhudeen with the foinest pisantry in the\r\nwurruld and listening to their comments on the \"moighty foine weather\r\nwe're havin', Glory be to God.\" They generally veer round to the\r\nuniversal subject, seeking up-to-date information. Discovering my\r\nignorance of the question, they explain the whole matter, incidentally\r\ndisclosing their own opinions. The field workers of this district are\r\nfairly intelligent. Most have been in England, working as harvesters,\r\nand some of the better-informed believe that in future they will be\r\ncompelled to live in England altogether.\r\n\r\nA fine old man, living by the roadside near Oolagh, said:--\"I wint to\r\nEngland for thirty-four years runnin', and to the same place, in North\r\nStaffordshire, first wid father, thin wid son. Whin I got too ould an'\r\nstiff I sent me own son. First it was old Micky, thin it was young\r\nMicky. He's away four months, and brings back enough to help us thro'\r\nthe winter, thanks be to God. The other time he mostly works at the\r\nbig farrum beyant there. Whin they cut up the big farrums into little\r\nones, nayther meself nor Micky will get anything, by raison we're\r\ndacent, harmless people. 'Tis the murtherin' moonlighters will get the\r\nland, an' me son wouldn't demane himself by stoppin' in the counthry\r\nto work for them. First 'twas the landlords dhrove us away, next\r\n'twill be the tenants. We're bound to be slaughtered some way,\r\nalthough 'twas said that when we 'bolished the landlords we'd end our\r\ntroubles. But begorra, there's more ways o' killin' a dog than by\r\nchokin' him wid butther.\" There is a growing feeling among the farmers\r\nthat the land will be heavily taxed to raise revenue, and that this\r\nmeans expatriation to the labouring classes, who will swarm to England\r\nin greater numbers than ever.\r\n\r\nAnother grand old man, named Mulqueen, spoke English imperfectly, and\r\nit was only by dint of frequent repetition that his meaning could be\r\nmastered. Well clothed and well groomed, he stood at his cottage door,\r\nthe picture of well-earned repose. Thirty-two years of constabulary\r\nservice and twenty-one years in a private capacity had brought him to\r\nseventy-five, when he returned to end his days on his native spot,\r\namong Irish-speaking people, and under the noble shadow of the Galtee\r\nMountains. Divested of the accent which flavoured his rusty English,\r\nMr. Mulqueen's opinions were as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"I am a Home Ruler and I voted for a Nationalist. But I am now\r\ndoubtful as to the wisdom of that course. I see that Irishmen quarrel\r\nat every turn, that they are splitting up already, that the country\r\nunder their management would be torn to pieces, that the people would\r\nsuffer severely, and that England would have to interfere to keep our\r\nleaders from each other's throats. It was Irish disputes that brought\r\nthe English here at first. In the event of an Irish Legislature Irish\r\ndisagreements would bring them here again. We'll never be able to\r\ngovern ourselves until the people are more enlightened.\" I left this\r\nsensible and truly patriotic Irishman with the wish that there were\r\nmore like him. He was a pious Catholic, and regretted to learn that I\r\nwas otherwise, admitting in extenuation that this was rather a\r\nmisfortune than a fault, and, with a parting hand-shake, expressing an\r\nearnest hope that \"the golden gates of glory might open to receive my\r\nsowl, and that we might again convarse in the company of the blessed\r\nsaints in the peaceful courts of heaven.\" This old-fashioned pious\r\nkindliness is hardly now the mode, and isolated instances can rarely\r\nbe met with even in remote country districts.\r\n\r\nRunning down to Limerick, I witnessed a warm contention between a\r\nUnionist from Belfast and a commercial traveller from Mullingar, a hot\r\nHome Ruler, the latter basing his arguments on alleged iniquitous\r\ntreatment of his father, a West Meath farmer, and defending boycotting\r\nas \"a bloodless weapon,\" which phrase he evidently considered\r\nunanswerable. The Land League he contended was a fair combination to\r\nprotect the interests of the tenants, and avowed that all evictions\r\nwere unwarrantable acts of tyranny. The Belfast man showed that these\r\narguments were equally applicable to the other side, and asked the\r\npatriot if eviction were not likewise \"a bloodless weapon,\" to which\r\ninquiry the Mullingar man failed to find the proper answer, and, not\r\ncoming up to time, was by his backers held to have thrown up the\r\nsponge. This incident is only valuable as showing the poor line of\r\ncountry hunted by the more brainy Nationalists. A County Clare man\r\nboasted of his collection of Irish curiosities. \"I have the pistol\r\nO'Connell shot So-and-So with, I have the pistol Grattan used when he\r\nmet Somebody else, I have the sword of Wolfe Tone, the pike that Miles\r\nO'Flanagan--\" Here the Ulsterman broke in with--\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Sir. There's one thing I'd like to see if ye have it. Like\r\nyou, I am a pathriotic Irishman, and take deloight in relics\r\nappertaining to the histhory of me counthry. Tell me now, have ye the\r\nhorsewhip, the thunderin' big horsewhip, that young McDermot, of\r\nThrinity College, used when he administhered condign punishment to Tim\r\nHealy? Have ye that, now?\"\r\n\r\nThe County Clare man was completely knocked out. He discontinued the\r\nrecital of his catalogue, and surveyed the scenery in dignified\r\nsilence. His own friends chuckled. This was the most unkindest cut of\r\nall. Irishmen love to see a splendid knockdown blow. They are full of\r\nfight, and their spirit must have vent. They fight for fun, for love,\r\nfor anything, for nothing, with words, with blows, with tongues, with\r\nblackthorns, anywhere, anyhow, only let them fight. Remove Mr. Bull,\r\nthey will fight each other. Heaven help the right when nobody stands\r\nby to see fair play!\r\n\r\nA Mr. Magrath, of Killmallock, was inclined to take a jocose view of\r\nthe situation. \"Faix, the English could never govern Ireland, an'\r\nsmall blame to thim for that same. Did ye see the Divil's Bit\r\nMountains as ye came down from Dublin? Ye did? Av coorse, ye couldn't\r\nhelp but see them. Did ye see the big bite he tuk out o' the range--ye\r\ncan see the marks o' the divil's own teeth, an' the very shape of his\r\ngums, divil sweep him! Shure, I seen it meself whin I wint to the\r\nCurragh races wid Barney Maloney; an' by the same token, 'twas Barney\r\naxplained it to me. Didn't the divil take his bite, an' then didn't he\r\ndhrop it on the plain out there forninst ye, the big lump they call\r\nthe rock iv Cashel? Av coorse he did. An' if the divil himself found\r\nIreland too hard a nut to crack, how can the English expect to manage\r\nus? Anyway, 'tis too big a mouthful for Misther Bull.\" One gentleman\r\nstood at his shop door, and having looked carefully around, said, \"Ye\r\nniver know who ye're spakin' wid, an' ye niver know who's spyin' ye.\r\nAh, this is a terrible counthry since we all got upset wid this Home\r\nRule question. Did ye hear of Sadleir, of Tipperary? Ye didn't? He was\r\na savin', sthrivin' man, an' he married a woman wid money. He had a\r\nfoine shop, wid ploughs, an' sickles, an' spades for the whole\r\ncounthry round. 'Twas a grand business he had, an' he made a powerful\r\ndale o' money. He was a quiet man, an' niver wint to the whiskey\r\nshops, where the boys they would be quarrellin' an' knockin' hell out\r\niv each other. He introduced a timprance lecturer that towld the boys\r\nthe poteen was pizenin' thim, an' 'twas wather they must dhrink. Ha!\r\nHa! Will I tell ye what owld Sheela Maguire said to the timprance\r\nman?\"\r\n\r\nI admitted a delirious delight in discursive digression.\r\n\r\n\"The timprance man had a wondherful glass that made iverything a\r\nthousand million times as big. What's this he called it? Ye're right,\r\n'twas a my-cross-scrope; ye hit it to a pop; bedad 'tis yerself has\r\nthe larnin.' An' the people looked through it at the wather he put in\r\na glass, an' they seen the wather all swimmin' wid snakes an'\r\nscorpions; 'twas enough to terrify the mortal sowl out o' ye. An' so\r\nSheela looked in an' saw them. An' the man put in the wather a good\r\ndhrop o' whiskey, an' he says, says he, 'Now ye'll see the effect on\r\nanimal life,' says he. An' Sheela looked in again, an' she seen the\r\nsnakes all doubled up, an' kilt, an' murthered an' says Sheela, says\r\nshe:--\r\n\r\n\"'May the divil fly away wid me,' says she, 'if I ever touch wather\r\nagain till I first put in whiskey to kill them fellows!'\r\n\r\n\"'Twas poor Sadleir, of Tipperary town, brought the man down. Sadleir\r\nmust howld land; nothin' less would sarve him, an' he tuk from\r\nSmith-Barry a big houldin', an' paid the out-going tenant five\r\nthousand pounds for his interest. Whin the throubles began he refused\r\nto join the Land League, by raison that he'd put all his money in the\r\nland. They sent him terrible letthers wid skulls an' guns, an'\r\ncoffins, an' they said Will ye join? An' he said No, once. They\r\nsmashed ivery pane o' glass in his house, an' they said Will ye join?\r\nAn' he said No, twice. They bate his servants next, an' said Will ye\r\njoin? An' he said No, three times. They threw explosives into the\r\nhouse, an' said Will ye join? An' he broke down. He was afeard for his\r\nlife. He wint in wid the rest, an' refused to pay rint', an' iv coorse\r\nhe got evicted, an' lost his five thousand pounds he put into the\r\nfarm, an' then he lost his business, an' before long he died with a\r\nbroken heart. An' where did he die? Just in the workhouse. 'Twas all\r\nthro' William O'Brien, the great frind iv Oireland, that this\r\nhappened. An' if O'Brien an' his frinds got into power, why wouldn't\r\nit happen again? But we're afeard to breathe almost in this\r\nunfortunate counthry, God help us!\"\r\n\r\nAmid the varying opinions of the Irish people there is one point on\r\nwhich they are unanimous. They have no confidence in their present\r\nleaders, whom they freely accuse of blackguardism, lying, and flagrant\r\ndishonesty. Business men, although Home Rulers, agree that the\r\ndestinies of the country should not be trusted to either or any of the\r\njarring factions, which like unclean birds of evil omen hover darkling\r\naround, already disputing with horrid dissonance possession of the\r\ncarcase on which they hope to batten. At the Station Hotel, Limerick\r\nJunction, a warm Nationalist said to me, \"The country will be ruined\r\nwith those blackguards. We have a right to Home Rule, an abstract\r\nright to manage our own affairs, and I believe in the principle. But I\r\nwant such men as Andrew Jameson, or Jonathan Hogg, or that other\r\nQuaker, Pym, the big draper. There we have honourable gentlemen, whom\r\nwe or the English alike might trust, either as to ability or\r\nintegrity. We might place ourselves in the hands of such men and close\r\nour eyes with perfect confidence. Our misfortune is that our men, as a\r\nwhole, are a long way below par. They inspire no confidence, they\r\ncarry no weight, and nobody has any respect for them.\" Here my friend\r\nmentioned names, and spoke of an Irish M.P.'s conduct at Sligo. I give\r\nhis story exactly as I heard it, premising that my informant's _tout\r\nensemble_ was satisfactory, and that he assured me I might rely on his\r\nwords:--\"At the Imperial Hotel a discussion arose--a merely political\r\ndiscussion--and blows were exchanged, the 'honourable gentleman' and\r\nothers rolling about the floor like so many savage bull dogs in a\r\nregular rough-and-tumble fight. The poor 'boots' got his face badly\r\nbruised, and for some days went about in mourning. I see that this\r\nsame member is bringing in a Bill in the House of Commons, and I read\r\nit through with great interest, because I remembered the row, which\r\nwas hushed up, and never appeared in the papers. Imagine any Irishman,\r\nwith any respect either for himself or his country, trusting either to\r\na parcel of fellows like that.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend spoke more moderately of the objectionable Irish M.P.'s than\r\nthey do of each other, but his opinions were obviously strong enough\r\nfor anything. The attitude of the _Freeman's Journal_ moved him to\r\ncontempt, and its abject subjection to the priesthood excited his\r\ndisgust. He said, waving the despised sheet with indignity--\"We have\r\nno paper now. We lost all when we lost Parnell. He was a Protestant,\r\nand could carry the English people, and with all his faults he had the\r\ntraining of a gentleman. Look at the low-bred animals that represent\r\nus now. Look at Blank-Blanky and his whole boiling. I swear I am\r\nashamed to look an Englishman in the face. The very thought of the\r\nIrish members makes me puke.\"\r\n\r\nThe mention of Mr. Jonathan Hogg reminds me that this eminent Dubliner\r\nsubmitted to me a point which I do not remember to have seen in print.\r\nSaid Mr. Hogg: \"When the Irish Legislature has become an accomplished\r\nfact, which is extremely improbable, the land will be divided and\r\nsub-divided until the separate holdings will yield incomes below the\r\namount required for the payment of income-tax. The effect of this will\r\nbe that a large number of incomes now paying tax will disappear, each\r\nleaving a number of small incomes paying no tax, so that a larger tax\r\nmust be levied on the remaining incomes to meet the deficiency. Then\r\nthe large manufacturers who can move away will certainly do so, and\r\nthe country will suffer severely. Employment will be scarce or\r\naltogether lacking, and the people will go to England, by their\r\ncompetition lowering the rate of wage.\" The mention of Mr. Andrew\r\nJameson reminds me of his opinion _re_ Customs. He said to me \"The\r\nbill nominally deprecates Separation, and yet proposes to establish a\r\nCustom House between the two countries, making Ireland a foreign\r\ncountry at once.\" Mr. John Jameson, who was present along with Mr.\r\nArundel, the business manager of the great J.J. concern, then\r\nexpressed his fears anent the practicability of Customs' collections\r\non the Irish coast. He said, \"We have 1,300 coastguards at present,\r\nand this force is ample when backed by the Royal Irish Constabulary,\r\nmarching and patrolling in the interior. But when the constabulary are\r\nno longer engaged in the direct protection of British interests the\r\nlittle force of thirteen hundred coastguards must prove quite\r\ninsufficient, and I doubt if even thirteen thousand would prove an\r\nadequate force. The Irish people will have no interest in protecting\r\nthe British Government. Their interest will be exactly the other way.\r\nGrave difficulties attend the proposition having regard to the Customs\r\nduties between the two countries.\" Another eminent authority then\r\npresent referred to the encouragement which the Act would give to the\r\nenterprising smuggler, and thought that a small fleet of American\r\nsteamers, smart built, fast little boats, would instantly spring into\r\nexistence to carry on a splendidly paying trade--a trade, too, having\r\nuntold fascination for the Yankees, while the average Irishman, as\r\neverybody knows, is a smuggler by nature, disposition, heredity, and\r\ndivine right. It was also pointed out that, whereas huge quantities of\r\nspirits now pass to Ireland through the ports of Bristol and London,\r\nunder the new dispensation Irish merchants would order direct, which\r\nwould inflict loss on England. The details of this loss were fully\r\nexplained, but I omit them for the reason that experts will\r\nunderstand, while lay readers may safely accept a statement uttered in\r\nthe presence of the two Jamesons and receiving their assent.\r\n\r\nBut my friend's conversation reminded me of something more, and I\r\nremembered a little story I heard in Dublin respecting a daily\r\ndisseminator of priest-ordered politics. It owed some rent for the\r\npremises it occupies on the thymy banks of the odorous Liffey. It\r\nowed, I say, for owing, not paying, is the strong suit of the party it\r\nrepresents. It was pressed to pay, coaxed to plank down, soothered to\r\nshell out. A registered letter with premonitory twist of the screw\r\n\"fetched\" the patriot laggards. They or \"It\" paid up, but failed to\r\nlook pleasant. In his hurry the glad recipient of the cash gave a\r\nreceipt up to date instead of up to the time the rent was due. The\r\nimmaculate organ of highly-rectified morality wished to hold the\r\nwriter of the receipt to his pen-slip, to nobble the rent; and being\r\nreproached backed out with:--\r\n\r\n\"We thought you wanted to give it as a present.\" The landlord is a\r\nstrong Unionist. The rottenness of repudiation is spreading\r\neverywhere. Lying and theft, under other names, would be, the dominant\r\ninfluences under the new _régime_. But it may be objected--If Irishmen\r\nhave no respect for their members, why did they elect them? If they\r\nobject to Home Rule, why did they vote for it? And so on, and so on.\r\nThese queries at first blush seem unanswerable, but they are not\r\nreally so. Attentive readers of later letters will discover the reason\r\nwhy. Further, it may be remarked, in passing, that questions are more\r\neasily asked than answered. Here is an instance. The facts are\r\nundeniable, staring us in the face:--\r\n\r\nThe base and bloody Balfour, unaccompanied by men who have been called\r\nhis black and brutal bloodhounds, moves about in Ireland unmolested,\r\nwith no other protection than that of his sister.\r\n\r\nThe bright and brilliant O'Brien, the purist-patriot, visiting the\r\nconstituency of which he is the senior member, is with difficulty\r\nprotected by a powerful force of the police he has so often affected\r\nto despise.\r\n\r\nOther Nationalist members dare not appear in Nationalist quarters. How\r\nis this?\r\n\r\nTo return to the objections given above. Since the appearance of the\r\nbill, Irishmen have been changing their minds. Day by day they dread\r\nit more and more. They still believe that under certain conditions\r\nHome Rule would be a good thing for Ireland. But they begin to see\r\nthat the required conditions do not exist. They begin to see that they\r\nhave been used by such men as O'Brien and Healy, they see the\r\nincompetency which has reduced the party paper to so low an ebb, they\r\nsee the misery and degradation which the Land League inflicted on the\r\nonce thriving districts of Tipperary; they saw their neighbours, poor,\r\nunlettered men, dupes of unscrupulous lying eloquence, men whom it was\r\nmurder to deceive--they saw these men sentenced to long terms of penal\r\nservitude, while the instigators of the crimes for which they had\r\nsuffered, availing themselves of the liberal English law, broke their\r\nbail, and, travelling first-class to Paris, lived in the best hotels\r\nof that gay city on the plunder they had wiled from ignorant servant\r\ngirls, being clothed in purple and fine linen, and faring sumptuously\r\nevery day, while their friends the felons trod the tireless wheel and\r\nthe housemaids went on with their scrubbing.\r\n\r\nThe Irish people have seen these things and many more, and, as the\r\nFrench say, they have reflected. A very considerable proportion of the\r\nlower classes have already changed their minds, but--they dare not own\r\nit. So the process of education is comparatively slow. A small farmer\r\nsaid to me, \"Not an hour's walk from here, a small tinant like meself\r\nwas suspicted to be a thraitor to the cause. He was a sthrivin' man,\r\nan' he had really no politics, an' only wanted to get lave to work his\r\nland, an' earn his bit an' sup.\r\n\r\n\"He had two sthrappin' daughters, as nice, dacent young girls as ye'd\r\nsee in a summer's day. They were seen spakin' to a pliceman--that was\r\nall they done--an' four men came that night, four ruffians wid white\r\nmasks, an' havin' secured the father, they dhragged the young girls\r\nout of bed at the dead hour, an' stripped them to the skin. Thin they\r\ncut off their hair close wid a knife, the way ye'd cut corn, an'\r\nscarified their bodies wid knives. Would ye wondher we're careful?\"\r\n\r\nI asked him whether a Protestant could in his district hope to be\r\nelected to any public position, the Board of Guardians for instance\r\n(he was a good Catholic). His answer was an unqualified No. Then he\r\ntook time, and shortly proposed the following statement of the\r\nposition, which I present on account of its gem-like finish:--\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't say but they'd put on a Protestant av he paid for it by\r\nsettlin' wid the priest that for certain considerations he would be\r\ncontint wid a seat on the boord. An' thin he must renounce his\r\npolitical ideas, or promise never to mintion thim in public. But,\r\nbegorra, he'd have to sell his birthright for a mess of pottage by\r\nmakin' a decoy duck of himself!\"\r\n\r\nIn adding this great specimen to the immortal list of memorable mixed\r\nmetaphors, I feel that my visit to Ireland has not been quite in vain.\r\n\r\nOolagh, (Co. Tipperary), April 15th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 10.--DEFYING THE LAND LEAGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Burn everything English except English coals.\" That was the first\r\nsentiment I heard in \"rebel Cork,\" and it certainly expresses the\r\ndominant feeling of the local Nationalist party, who do not seem to\r\nhave heard of the proposed Union of Hearts, or, if they have heard,\r\nthey certainly have not heeded. Nor will anyone who knows for one\r\nmoment assert that the Corkers entertain the idea. My hotel is a\r\nhotbed of sedition. It is the southern head-quarters of the Parnellite\r\nparty. The spacious entrance hall is a favourite resort of the leading\r\nCork Nationalists, who air their views in public with much excited\r\ngesture, having its basis in whiskey-nourished hatred of English rule.\r\nThey walk to the bar, suck in the liquid bliss, and return to the spot\r\nwhence they may look upon the beauteous promenaders of Patrick Street.\r\nThey prefer the kaleidoscopic change of the streets to the stationary\r\nbeauty of the bar, and while admitting the unfleeting quality of the\r\nfixed stars they worship the procession of the equinoxes. On Saturday\r\nlast, the day O'Brien died, the Mayor of Cork, with Mayoral chain and\r\nhosts of satellites, might have been seen under the familiar portal,\r\ndiscussing the proposed public funeral of the lamented friend, once\r\nMayor of the City, and described as \"a gentleman who had, by his\r\ncourageous and outspoken utterances, obtained the distinguished honour\r\nof imprisonment by the British Government.\" Particulars were not\r\ngiven, as the first two incarcerations occurred under Forster and\r\nTrevelyan. The third, under Balfour, was a term of fourteen days for\r\nassaulting a policeman. The Corporation discussed the patriot's merits\r\nwithout descending to detail. Outside, the newspaper boys were yelling\r\n\"Arrest of Misther Balfour-r-r,\" but the Corporation were no buyers.\r\nThe populace might be taken in, but official Cork know it was the\r\n\"wrong 'un,\" and clave to its hard-earned pence.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion here is much the same as in Dublin, only hotter.\r\nRespectable people who have anything to lose are, if possible, more\r\nseriously alarmed. The lower classes are, if possible, more bitter,\r\nmore implacable in their animosity to everything English.\r\nNevertheless, the feeling against Home Rule is assuredly gaining\r\nground, even among the most ardent Nationalists. The great meeting of\r\nlast Wednesday showed what the Unionists could do, how they could\r\ncrowd a great platform with the intelligence of the country, and fill\r\na great hall with the Unionist rank and file. The Loyalists have\r\nastonished themselves. They knew not their own strength. Now they are\r\ntaking fresh heart, determined to hold out to extremity. The\r\nSeparatists--for the Corkers are Separatists _au naturel_--are\r\nsomewhat disconcerted, and try to minimise the effect of the meeting\r\nby sneering and contumely; but it will not do. They affect hilarity,\r\nbut their laughter is not real. Perhaps nothing shows the shallowness\r\nof men more than the tricks they think sufficient to deceive. And then\r\nthe leaders are accustomed to a credulous public. The place is\r\neminently religious. Cork is the Isle of Saints--with a port and a\r\ngarrison to enhance its sanctity. At certain seasons a big trade is\r\ndone in candles, on which names are written, which being blessed and\r\nburnt have powerful influence in the heavenly courts. It costs a\r\ntrifle to hallow the tallow, but no matter. A friend has seen a muddy\r\nlittle well, which is fine for sore eyes. Offerings of old bottles and\r\nlittle headless images were planted around, but the favourite gift was\r\na pin, stuck in the ground by way of fee. Jolly Mr. Whicker, of\r\nDublin, who represents three Birmingham houses, saw Father McFadden,\r\nof Gweedore, waving his hat when in custody. A policeman insisted that\r\nthis should cease, when a man in the crowd said to Mr. Whicker:--\r\n\r\n\"Arrah, now, look at the holy man. He puts on his hat widout a wurrud,\r\nwhin he could strike the man dead wid jist sayin' a curse. 'Tis a good\r\nsaint he is, to go wid the police, whin if he sthretched out his hand\r\nhe could wither thim up, an' bur-rn thim like sthraws in the blazin'\r\nturf!\"\r\n\r\nThese people have votes, and to a man support the Nationalist party.\r\nIt is proposed to place Ireland under a Government governed by these\r\ngood folks, who are in turn governed by their sacred medicine-men.\r\n\r\nA member of the firm of Cooke Brothers, a native of Cork, in business\r\nin this city fifty years, said:--\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt that the bill means ruin for Ireland, and\r\ntherefore damage to England. The poor folks here believe the most\r\nextravagant things, and follow the agitators like a flock of sheep.\r\nThey are undoubtedly wanting in energy. We have the richest land in\r\nIreland, wonderful pastures that turn out the most splendid cattle in\r\nthe world, big salmon rivers, a most fruitful country, a land flowing\r\nwith milk and honey. As the rents are judicially fixed there can be no\r\nground for complaint, but the people will not help themselves. Whether\r\nit is in the climate I cannot say, but I must reluctantly admit--and\r\nno one will gainsay my statement--that the people of the South, to put\r\nit mildly, are not a striving sort.\r\n\r\n\"They want somebody else to do something for them. They get on a stick\r\nand wait till it turns to a horse before they ride. No Act of\r\nParliament will help them, for they will not help themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Look at the magnificent country you saw from Dublin to this city.\r\nCompare it with the black and desolate bogs of Ulster, and then ask\r\nyourself this question--How is it that the Ulster people, with far\r\nworse land, worse harbours, worse position, and having the same laws,\r\nare prosperous and content to have no change? If the Northerns and\r\nSoutherns would swop countries, Ireland must develop into one of the\r\nmost prosperous countries in the world. The Ulster men are\r\ntremendously handicapped as against the Munster folks, but--they are\r\nworkers. Some say that if they were here the climate would enervate\r\nthem, but I do not find that my experience countenances this\r\nsupposition. Fifty years ago all the leading merchants and tradesmen\r\nof Cork were Catholics. It is not so now. What does that prove? I\r\nwithhold my own opinion.\r\n\r\n\"The Southerners are better fixed than the Ulstermen, but they are\r\nidle, and--this is very important--extremely sentimental.\"\r\n\r\nAn avowed Nationalist, one Sullivan, completely bore out this last\r\nstatement. \"We want to manage our own business, and be ruled by\r\nIrishmen. You say in England that we shall be poor, and so we may, but\r\nthat is no argument at all. It might influence a nation of\r\nshopkeepers, but it has no weight with Irishmen, who have a proper and\r\ncreditable wish to make their country one of the nations of the world.\r\nThe very servant girls feel this, and the poorest peasant woman now\r\nhaving what she calls a 'tay brakefast' is willing to go back to\r\nporridge if the country was once rid of the English. Never you mind\r\nwhat will happen to us. Cut us adrift, and that will be all we ask. If\r\nwe need help we can affiliate with America or even France. The first\r\nis half our own people, the second understands the Irish nation, which\r\nfought for centuries in the French armies, and, under Marshal Saxe, an\r\nIrishman, routed the English at Fontenoy.\" This gentleman was civil\r\nand moderate in tone, but he did not promise to walk down the ages\r\narm-in-arm with England, attesting eternal amity by exchanging smokes\r\nand drinks. \"We'll be very glad to see the English as tourists,\" he\r\nsaid. \"And they will have to behave themselves, too,\" he added,\r\nreflectively.\r\n\r\nA large trader of Patrick Street has most serious misgivings as to the\r\neffect of the bill. He said:--\r\n\r\n\"I had just been over to England to make purchases. Arriving here, I\r\nfound the bill just out. I read it, and at once cancelled half my\r\norders. We are reducing stock. What Home Rule would do for us I cannot\r\ncontemplate. The mere threat amounts to partial paralysis. What the\r\nCork people want with Home Rule is beyond me. They have everything in\r\ntheir own hands. The city elections of all kinds are governed by the\r\nrural voters of five miles round. Wealth and commercial capital are\r\ncompletely swamped by these obedient servants of the priests. Mr.\r\nGladstone talks of an Upper House, with a £20 qualification. Why, the\r\nqualification for the Grand Jury is £40. Many of the twenty-pounders\r\nround here cannot read or write, and yet they will be qualified for\r\nthe Irish House of Lords.\r\n\r\nA customer came up and said:--\"Gladstone wants to hand the capital and\r\ncommerce of this country to men like Tim Healy, who expects to be\r\nPrime Minister, and who will succeed, if the bill passes and he can\r\neat priestly dirt enough. I knew where he was reared in Waterford, in\r\na little tripe and drischeen shop.\"\r\n\r\nI rose to a point of order. Would the honourable member now addressing\r\nthe House kindly explain the technical term \"drischeen shop?\"\r\n\"Certainly. The drischeen is a sort of pudding, made of hog's blood\r\nand entrails, with a mixture of tansy and other things. Tim would know\r\nthem well for he was reared on them, which accounts for his\r\ncharacteristic career. Do you know that the Queenstown Town\r\nCommissioners call each other liars, and invite each other to come out\r\nand settle it on the landing? Get the _Cork Constitution_, look over\r\nthe file, and you'll drop on gems that will be the soul of your next\r\nletter. Don't miss it. And that's the sort of folks Mr. Gladstone\r\nwould trust with the fate of England as well as Ireland, for their\r\nfates would be the same. You cannot separate them. The people of\r\nEngland do not seem to see through that. They will have an awful\r\nawakening. And serve them right. They make a pact with traitors; they\r\noffer their throats to the murderer, and they say, 'Anything to oblige\r\nyou. I know you won't hurt us much.'\r\n\r\n\"The Southern Irish are the most lovable people in the world, with all\r\ntheir faults, if they were not led astray by hireling agitators, who\r\nruin the country by playing on the people's ignorance, exciting the\r\nCatholic hope of religious domination, and trusting to damage England\r\nas a great spreader of Protestantism. A lie is no lie if told to a\r\nProtestant. To keep a Protestant out of heaven would be a meritorious\r\naction. And they would readily damage themselves if by doing so they\r\ncould also damage England. Englishmen hardly believe this, but every\r\ncommercial traveller from an English house knows it is true.\"\r\n\r\nI tested a number of English commercials on this point. All confirmed\r\nthe statement above given. Many had been Gladstonians, but now all\r\nwere Unionists. None of them knew an English or Scotch commercial who,\r\nhaving travelled in Ireland, remained a Home Ruler. Such a person,\r\nthey thought, did not exist. Admitted that for business purposes the\r\napparent _rara avis_ might possibly, though not probably, be found,\r\nall agreed that no Englishman in his senses, with personal knowledge\r\nof the subject, could over support Home Rule. Two Gladstonians went\r\nfrom Chester to Tipperary to investigate the troubles: both returned\r\nconverted. Six men from a shop-fitting establishment in Birmingham\r\nworked some weeks in Dublin: all returned Unionist to the core. This\r\nfrom Mr. Sibley, of Grafton street, Dublin, in whose splendid shop I\r\nmet the Duchess of Leinster, handsomest woman in Ireland, and\r\ntherefore (say Irishmen) handsomest in the world. She was buying books\r\nfor Mr. Balfour, who, she said, was a great reader of everything\r\nconnected with Ireland or Irish affairs. Mr. Sibley is a partner of\r\nMr. Combridge, of New street, Birmingham, and is a leading Irish\r\nUnionist. Returning to the cancelling of orders, I will add that Mr.\r\nRichard Patterson, J.P., of Belfast, the largest buyer of hardware in\r\nIreland, has cancelled very largely, together with two other large\r\nfirms, whose names he gave me. You will remember Mr. John Cook, the\r\nProtestant Home Ruler, of Derry. His manager, Mr. Smith, has written\r\nthe Birmingham factor of the house, to omit his usual visit, as the\r\nfirm will have no orders for him. A strange comment on Mr. Cook's\r\ntheories of confidence. Mr. Cook is an excellent, a high-minded man.\r\nHe asked me how I would class him among his party. I called him a\r\nVisionary in Excelsis.\r\n\r\nEvery self-respecting Saxon visitor to Cork visits the famous castle\r\nof Blarney, seven miles away, to see the scenery and kiss the Blarney\r\nStone, the apparent source of Home Rule inspiration.\r\n\r\n    There is a stone there\r\n    That whoever kisses\r\n    Och! he never misses\r\n        To grow eloquent.\r\n    'Tis he may clamber\r\n    To a lady's chamber,\r\n    Or become a member\r\n        Of Parliament.\r\n\r\n    A clever spouter\r\n    He'll sure turn out, or\r\n    An out-an'-outer\r\n        To be let alone!\r\n    Don't hope to hindher him\r\n    Or to bewildher him--\r\n    Sure, he's a pilgrim\r\n        From the Blarney stone!\r\n\r\nThe walk is delightful, not unlike that from Colwyn Bay to Conway, but\r\nmore beautiful still, as instead of the London and North Western\r\nRailway a lovely river runs along the valley on your right. The Cork\r\nand Muskerry Light Railway occupies the roadside for the first four\r\nmiles, relic of the beneficent Balfour--winding by the river side for\r\nthe rest of the journey, through fat meadows dotted with thriving\r\nkine, and having a background of richly-wooded hills. At Carrickrohane\r\nyour left is bounded by a huge precipitous rock, covered from base to\r\nsummit with ivy and other greenery, a great grey building on the very\r\nbrink of the abyss, flanked by Scotch firs, peering over the\r\nprecipice. A fine stone bridge, garrisoned by salmon-fishers, leads to\r\nthe Anglers' Rest, and here I found a splendid character, one Dennis\r\nMulcahy, who boasted of his successful resistance to the Land League.\r\nHaving told me of his adventures in America, and how his oyster-bar\r\nexperiences in the Far West had opened his eyes to the fact that the\r\nIrish people were being humbugged, he narrated his return to his\r\nnative land, on his succession to a small farm left him by \"an ould\r\naunt he had.\" His language was so forcible and picturesque that I\r\ndespair of conveying its effect, more especially as no pen can\r\ndescribe the rich brogue, which, notwithstanding his two years'\r\nresidence in the States, was still thick enough to be cut with a\r\nknife. Apart from its amusing side, his story has a moral, and may be\r\ninstructively applied.\r\n\r\n\"'Twas at Ballina I was, the toime o' the Land Lague. 'Twas there\r\nCaptain Moonlight started from, an' the whole disthrict was shiverin'\r\nin their shoes. I refused to subscribe to the Land Lague, an' they\r\nstarted to compil me, but, be the powers, they tackled the wrong\r\ntom-cat whin they wint to coarce Dennis Mulcahy. Threatenin' letthers,\r\nwid pictures o' death's-heads, an' guns, an' pikes, an' coffins, was\r\nbut a thrifle to the way they wint on. But they knew I had a thrifle\r\nof a sivin-shooter, an' bad luck to the one o' thim that dared mislist\r\nme at all. At last it got abroad that I was to get a batin' wid\r\nblackthorn sticks, for they wor tired the life out o' them, raisonin'\r\nwid me. Well, says I, I'm here, says I, an' the first man that raises\r\na hand to me, I'll invite him to his own inquist, says I, for, bedad,\r\nI'll perforate him like a riddle, says I. Well, it wint on an' on,\r\ntill one day I was stayin' at a bit of a shebeen outside the place,\r\nwhen a slip o' a girleen kem to me--I was sittin' on a bench in the\r\nback garden, the way I'd enjoy my pipe in the fresh air, an', says\r\nshe, 'Get out o' this, for there's a whole crew o' thim inside going\r\nto bate you.' That was six or seven o' a fine summer's night, an' I\r\nwalked into the house an' took a look at thim--a thievin' heap o'\r\nblayguards as iver ye seen wid your two eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wint out again an' sat in the haggard, where I could kape my eye on\r\nthe dure. Prisintly out comes one o' thim, to commince the row, I\r\nsuppose.\r\n\r\n\"He spoke o' the Land Lague, an' I towld him I didn't agree wid it at\r\nall, and 'twas a thievin' invintion o' a set o' roguish schamers.\r\n\r\n\"'Ye'd betther mind yer manners,' says he, 'onless ye have yer\r\nrevalver,' says he, lookin' at me maningly.\r\n\r\n\"Faix, 'tis here, says I, pullin' out the tool.\r\n\r\n\"'But can ye handle it?' says he.\r\n\r\n\"Begorra, says I, I'd shoot a fly off yer nose; an' wid that I looked\r\nround for a mark, an' I seen in a three foreninst me a lump o' a crow\r\nsittin' annoyin' me. 'Will ye quit yer dhrimandhru?' says I, to the\r\nbotherin' ould rook.\r\n\r\n\"'Caw, caw, caw,' says he, vexin' me intirely.\r\n\r\n\"Bang! says I, an the dirty blackburd comes fluttherin' down, an'\r\ndhropped in the haggard like a log o' limestone.\r\n\r\n\"Ye should have seen that fellow! The landlord wid the whole rout o'\r\nthim runs out. 'What's the matter?' says he, starin' round like a sick\r\ncod-fish.\r\n\r\n\"'I'm afther charmin' a burd out iv a three; 'tis a way I have,' says\r\nI, shovin' in a fresh cartridge from my waistcoat pocket, fair an'\r\naisy, an' kapin' me back to the haystack.\r\n\r\n\"'Was it you kilt the jackdaw?' says he.\r\n\r\n\"''Twas meself,' says I, 'that did it,' says I.\r\n\r\n\"'An' ye carry a murdherin' thing like that in a paceful counthry,'\r\nsays he. ''Tis yer American thrainin' says he, sneerin'.\r\n\r\n\"I tuk off me hat an' giv' him a bow an' a scrape. 'Is it yerself\r\nwould insinse me into the rudiments o' polite larnin'?' says I. Thin I\r\nlooked him straight into the white iv his eye, an' give him the length\r\no' my tongue. Me blood was up whin I seen this spalpeen wid his dirty\r\nset o' vagabones waitin' to murther me if they ketched me unbeknownst.\r\n'Michael Hegarty,' says I, 'where did ye scour up yer thievin' set o'\r\nrag-heaps?' says I. 'Ye'd bate me wid blackthorns, would ye? Come on,\r\nyou and your dirty thribe, till I put sivin shots into yez. Shure I\r\ncould pick the eye out o' yez shure I could shoot a louse off yer\r\near,' says I. 'Anger me,' says I, 'an' I'll murther the whole parish;\r\nraise a stick to me, an' I'll shlaughter the whole counthry side.' An'\r\nwid that I cocked me little shootin'-iron.\r\n\r\n\"Ye should have seen that shebeen-keeper; ye should have seen the\r\nwhole o' them whin I raised me voice an' lifted me little Colt!\r\n\r\n\"They tumbled away through the dure, crossin' each other like threes\r\nye'd cut down, lavin' the landlord, struck all iv a heap, the mug on\r\nhim white as a new twelve-pinny, staggerin' on his two shin-bones, an'\r\nthrimblin' an' shiverin' wid fright, till ye'd think he'd shake the\r\nteeth out iv his head.\r\n\r\n\"The murdherin' vilyans want shtandin' up to, an' they'll rispict ye.\r\nI had no further trouble. That was the last o' thim. 'Tis the wake an'\r\ndifinceless people they bate an' murther. I heerd there was talk o'\r\nshootin' me from the back iv a ditch; an' that one said, 'But av ye\r\nmissed?' says he. 'What thin?' says he.\r\n\r\n\"Ye should sind ould Gladstone an' Morley an' the other ould women to\r\nCarrignaheela till I give them a noggin' o' right poteen an' insinse\r\nthim into the way iv it. The only way o' managin' me counthrymin is to\r\nbe the masther all out, an' 'tis thrue what I spake, an' sorra one o'\r\nme cares who hears me opinion. I'm the only man in the counthry that\r\ndares open his teeth, an' yet they all thrate me well now, an' the\r\npriest invites me to his house. An' all because I spake me mind, an'\r\ndon't care three thraneens for the whole o' thim. 'Twas in America I\r\nlarned the secret.\"\r\n\r\nCork, April 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 11.--THE CRY FOR PEACE AND QUIETNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What's the next place to this?\" I asked, as the Southern and Western\r\nRailway deposited me at Tralee. I was uncertain as to whether the\r\nplace was a terminus, but the gintleman who dhrove the cyar I hailed\r\nmarvelled greatly at my ignorance. He surveyed me from top to toe with\r\na compassionate expression. No doubt he had heard much of the\r\nignorance of the uncivilised English, but this beat the record. Not\r\nto know that Tralee was on the sea, not to know that the little port\r\nfrowned o'er the wild Atlantic main, as Mr. Micawber would have said.\r\nHe struggled for a moment with his emotion and then said,\r\n\r\n\"Musha, the next parish is Amerikay!\"\r\n\r\nI apologised for my imperfect geographical knowledge, but the cyar-man\r\nwas immovable. No pardoning look stole over his big red face, which\r\nwas of the size and complexion of a newly cut ham. Nor would he enter\r\ninto conversation with the inquiring stranger. He cursed his horse\r\nwith a copiousness which showed his power of imagination, and with a\r\nminute attention to detail which demonstrated a superior business\r\ncapacity. Put him in the House amongst the Nationalist members, and he\r\nis bound to come to the front. The qualifications above-mentioned\r\ncannot fail to ensure success. We have the examples before us, no need\r\nto mention names. A hard cheek, a bitter tongue, and a good digestion\r\nare the three great steps in the Irish Parliamentary _gradus ad\r\nParnassum_, the cheek to enable its happy possessor to \"snub up\" to\r\ngentlemen of birth and breeding, the tongue to drip gall and venom on\r\nall and sundry, the digestion to eat dirt _ad libitum_ and to endure\r\nhebdomadal horsewhippings. Such a man, I am sure, was the dhriver of\r\nmy cyar, who may readily be identified. His physiognomy is very like\r\nthe railway map of Ireland, coloured red, with the rivers and mountain\r\nranges in dark-blue or plum-colour. As a means of ready reference he\r\nwould be invaluable in the House of Commons. How interesting to see\r\nMr. Gladstone poring over his cheek (Connaught and Leinster), his jaw\r\n(Munster, with a pimple for Parnellite Cork), and his forehead\r\n(Ulster, with the eyes for Derry and Belfast). The G.O.M. would find\r\nthe Kerry member invaluable. Like the rest he would probably be devoid\r\nof shame, untroubled by scruples, and a straight voter for his side,\r\nso long as he was not allowed to go \"widout a male.\" Who knows but\r\nthat, like the Prime Minister's chief Irish adviser, he may even have\r\nbeen reared on the savoury tripe and the succulent \"drischeen\"?\r\n\r\nAll the Tralee folks are shy of political talk. They eye you for a\r\nlong time before they commit themselves, but when once started they\r\ncan hardly stop, so warm are they, so intensely interested in the\r\ngreat question. Running down the line, a Cork merchant said \"The Kerry\r\nfolks are decent, quiet folks by nature. Do not believe that these\r\nsimple villagers are the determined murderers they would seem to be.\r\nNo brighter intellects in Ireland, no better hearts, no more\r\nhospitable hosts in the Emerald Isle. They are very superstitious.\r\nThere you have it all. 'Tis their beautiful ingenuousness that makes\r\nthem so easily led astray. What do these simple country folks, living\r\non their farms, without books, without newspapers, without\r\ncommunication with large centres--what do they know about intricate\r\nState affairs? What can they do but listen to the priest, regarded as\r\nthe great scholar of the district, reverenced as almost--nay, quite\r\ninfallible, and credited with the power to give or withhold eternal\r\nlife? For while in England the people only respect a parson according\r\nto the esteem he deserves as a man, in Ireland the priestly office\r\ninvests the man with a character entirely different from his own, and\r\ncovers everything. These poor folks felt the pinch of hard times, and\r\nthe agitators, backed by their Church, saw their opportunity and\r\ncommenced to use it. Hence the Kerry moonlighters, poor fellows,\r\nfighting in their rude and uncouth way for what they believed to be\r\npatriotism and freedom. They should be pitied rather than blamed, for\r\nthey were assuredly acting up to their light, and upon the advice of\r\nmen they had from childhood been taught to regard as wise, sincere,\r\nand disinterested counsellors.\r\n\r\n\"Ah me, what terrible times we had in Cork! Belfast may boast, but\r\nBelfast is not in it. We were in the centre of the fire. The\r\nshopkeepers of Patrick Street deserve the fullest recognition from the\r\nBritish nation. They had to furnish juries to well and truly try the\r\nmoonlighters of Kerry, Clare, and several other counties. They sat for\r\neight months, had to adjourn over Christmas, and those men returned\r\ntrue bills at the peril of their lives. The venue was changed to Cork\r\nfor all these counties, and every man jack of the jury knew full well\r\nthat any day some fanatic friend of the convicted men might shoot or\r\nstab him in the street. The loyalty of Belfast is all the talk, but it\r\nhas never undergone so severe a test. There the Loyalists have it all\r\ntheir own way. Here the Loyalists, instead of being three to one, are\r\nonly one to three. The Ulstermen are the entrenched army; the Cork\r\nUnionists are the advanced picket. More judges got promotion from Cork\r\nthan elsewhere. We changed the barristers' silk to ermine, too. All\r\nthis shows what we went through. Everything is quiet now; Balfour\r\nterrified the life out of them, and Captain Moonlight at the mention\r\nof that name would skip like spring-heeled Jack.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kerry folks turned out bright as their reputation. It was hard to\r\nbelieve that these simple, kindly peasants had ever stained their\r\nbeautiful pastoral country with the bloodiest, cruellest deeds of\r\nrecent times. They have a polite, deferential manner without\r\nservility, and a pious way of interpolating prayer and thanksgiving\r\nwith their ordinary conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good mornin', an' God save ye, Sorr.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine weather.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis indeed foine weather, glory be to God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nice country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Troth, it is a splindid country. The Lord keep us in it.\"\r\n\r\nA prosperous-looking shop with a portly personage at the door looked\r\nso uncommonly Unionistic that I ventured to make a few inquiries _re_\r\nthe antiquities of the district. The inevitable topic soon turned up,\r\nand to my surprise my friend avowed himself a Home Ruler and a\r\nProtectionist. His opinions and illustrations struck me as\r\nremarkable, and with his permission I record them here.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am a Home Ruler--in theory. I think Home Rule would be best\r\nfor both. Best for you and best for me, as the song says; but mark me\r\nwell--NOT YET.\r\n\r\n\"You are surprised that I should say Not Yet so emphatically, but the\r\nfact is I love my country, and, besides, all my interests and those of\r\nmy children are bound up with the prosperity of the country. This\r\nought to sharpen a man's wits, if anything could do it, and I have for\r\nmany years been engaged in thinking out the matter, and my mind is now\r\nmade up.\r\n\r\n\"Home Rule from Gladstone will ruin us altogether. We must have Home\r\nRule from Balfour. We _must_ have Home Rule, but we must have it from\r\na Conservative Government. You smile. Is that new to you? It is? Just\r\nbecause Home Rulers in this country cannot afford to express their\r\nviews at this moment. But the hope is entertained by all, I will say\r\nall, the most advanced Irish Home Rulers. By advanced I mean educated,\r\nenlightened. Let me give you an illustration which I heard from a\r\nfriend in Cork.\r\n\r\n\"Here is Ireland, a delicate plant requiring untold watching and\r\ncareful training. Around it on the ground are a number of slugs and\r\nsnails. Or call them hireling agitators if you like. I sprinkle salt\r\naround the roots to kill off the brutes and save my darling plant.\r\nThat salt is Conservatism. It is furnished by people of property, by\r\nmen who have interests to guard. Salt is a grand thing, let me tell\r\nyou! Balfour is the man to sprinkle salt. Home Rule from him would be\r\nsafe. He is the greatest man that ever governed Ireland, but that must\r\nbe stale to you. You must have heard that everywhere. He put his foot\r\non rebellion and crushed it out of existence. On the other hand the\r\npoor folks of the West coast would lie down and let him walk over\r\nthem. They hold him in such esteem that they would regard it a favour\r\nif he would honour them by wiping his feet on them. He might walk\r\nunarmed and unattended through Ireland from end to end with perfect\r\nsafety. But which of the Nationalist members could do that? Not one.\r\nThe city scum, the criminal, irreclaimable class, shout 'Hell to\r\nBalfour,' but these poor readers of the _Freeman's Journal_ and\r\nsuch-like prints, prepared for their special use and written down to\r\ntheir level, must not be classed with the people of Ireland at all.\r\nEvery country has its ruffian element, every country has its poisonous\r\npress. Ireland is no worse than other countries in these respects.\"\r\n\r\nMy Irish Conservative Home Ruler would have gone on indefinitely,\r\nfurnishing excellent matter, for he improved as he warmed up, but\r\nunhappily a priest called on him to make some purchase, and he had to\r\nleave me without much notice. \"Over the way,\" he said. \"Trip across to\r\nthe opposite shop, and you'll find another Tory Home Ruler.\"\r\n\r\nAs I \"tripped\" across I thought of the Pills and Ointment man who\r\namassed a colossal fortune by fifty years' advertising of the fact\r\nthat wonders never will cease. Mr. Overtheway was not quite so Tory as\r\nmight be supposed, after all. He said:--\r\n\r\n\"I have no objection to Home Rule, but, although a Catholic, I have\r\nthe greatest objection to Rome Rule, which is precisely what it means.\r\nI object to this great Empire being ruled from Rome. The greatest\r\nEmpire that the world ever saw to be bossed by a party of priests! Do\r\nthe English know what they are now submitting to?\r\n\r\n\"Let me put the thing logically, and controvert me if you can.\r\n\r\n\"If Mr. Gladstone wished to go to war to-morrow, is he not at the\r\nmercy of the Irish Nationalist party? Could he get votes of supply\r\nwithout their aid? In the event of any sudden, or grave emergency, any\r\nserious and critical contingency, would they not hold the key of the\r\nposition, would they not have the power to make or mar the Empire?\r\nSurely they would. And are not these men in the hands of the priests?\r\nSurely they are. That is a matter of common knowledge, as sure as that\r\nwater will drown and fire will burn. A pretty position for a sensible\r\nman like John Bull to be placed in by a blethering idiot, who can\r\nargue with equal volubility on either side, but with more conviction\r\nwhen in the wrong. Bull must have been drunk, and drunk on stupid\r\nbeer, when he placed his heart strings between the finger and thumb of\r\na quack like that, who, whatever the result, whether we get Home Rule\r\nor not, has ruined the country for five-and-twenty years.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am a Home Ruler. But for heaven's sake don't thrust\r\nself-government on an unfortunate country that is not ready for it.\r\nThat country cries for it, you say. The snuffling old air-pump across\r\nthe Channel says the same thing. Says he: 'Beloved brethren, I greet\r\nyou. I fall on your neck and kiss your two ears, and give you all you\r\nask. For why, beloved brethren? Why do I this thing. Let us in a\r\nspirit of love enquire. Because it is the wish of the country; because\r\nit is the aspiration of the people; because I feel a deep-seated,\r\ninternal affection for your beautiful land, in whose affairs, during\r\nmy eighty-four years' pilgrimage in this vale of tears, I have, as you\r\nknow, always shown the strongest, the warmest, the most passionate\r\ninterest, and on whose lovely shores I have during my seven dozen\r\nyears spent (altogether) nearly a week. It has been said that I have\r\nnever been in Ulster, and that, therefore, I am unable to appreciate\r\nthe situation. An atrocious falsehood. I have spent two hours (nearly)\r\nin the northern province, having landed from Sir Somebody's yacht to\r\nsee the Giant's Causeway. I have studied the Irish question by means\r\nof mineral specimens gathered from the four provinces, and I am,\r\ntherefore, competent to settle the Irish question for ever. Do you\r\nknow a greater man than myself? I confess I don't. Bless you, my\r\nchildren. You ask for Home Rule. Enough. The fact that you ask proves\r\na Divine right to have what you ask for. You are a people rightly\r\nstruggling to be free,' says owld Gladstone. 'Hell to my sowl,' says\r\nhe, 'but that's what ye are,' says he.\r\n\r\n\"And he starts to murder us by giving what the most ignorant,\r\nunthinking, unpatriotic, self-seeking people in the country have asked\r\nfor, and swears that because they ask they must have.\r\n\r\n\"As well give a razor to a baby that cried for it.\r\n\r\n\"Ireland must be treated as an infant.\r\n\r\n\"An Irish Legislature would lead to untold miseries. We might arrive\r\nthere some day, but not at a jump. The change is too sudden. We want a\r\nlittle training. We want to grow, and growth is a thing that cannot be\r\nforced. It takes time. Give us time for heaven's sake. Give us Home\r\nRule, but also give us time. Give us milk, then fish, then perhaps a\r\nchop, and then, as we grow strong, beefsteak and onions. A word in\r\nyour ear. This is certain truth, you can go Nap on it. Tell the\r\nEnglish people that the people are getting sick of agitation, that\r\nthey want peace and quietness, that they are losing faith in\r\nagitators, having before them a considerable stretch of history,\r\nwhich, notwithstanding the scattered population, is filtering down\r\ninto the minds of the people, with its morals all in big print. The\r\nIrish folks are naturally quick-witted. They are simple and confiding,\r\nmany of them very ignorant, if you will, but they find out their\r\nfriends in the long run. Look at Balfour. Not a man in the whole world\r\nfor whom the people have so much affection. Which do you think would\r\nget the best welcome to-morrow--Balfour or Morley? Balfour a hundred\r\nthousand times. Ah, now; my countrymen know the real article when they\r\nsee it. Home Rule we want for convenience and for cheapness. We don't\r\nwant to be compelled to rush to London before we can build a bridge.\r\nBut rather a million times submit to expense and inconvenience than\r\nhand the country over to a set of thieves who'd sell us to-morrow.\r\nWe're not such fools as ye take us for. Don't we know these heroes?\r\nAnd when we see them and Gladstone and Morley and Humbug Harcourt with\r\nhis seventeen chins, all rowling together in Abraham's bosom (as ye\r\nmay say)--Harcourt licking Harrington's boots, when only yesterday Tim\r\nwas spittin' in his eye--we say to ourselves 'Wait yet awhile, my\r\nBoys, wait yet awhile.' But when ye've finished yer slavering and\r\nsplathering, and when Tim Healy can find time to take his heel off\r\nMorley's neck, then, and not before, we'll have something to say to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\"But you should call on my friend on the right. He is also a Home\r\nRuler--like myself.\"\r\n\r\nNumber three had powerfully-developed opinions. He said--\"Home Rule on\r\nConservative lines is my ticket. We'll get it on no other. I console\r\nmyself with that idea. Otherwise it would be a frightful business, and\r\nwhat would become of us, I cannot tell. But I do not believe that even\r\nGladstone would be so insane as to give it us. I cannot believe that\r\nthe middle class voters of England would stand by and see the\r\ncorresponding class in this country exterminated. Home Rule as much as\r\nyou like, if we had the right men. The very poorest peasants are\r\nbecoming alive to the fact that under present circumstances the thing\r\nwould never do for them. They want the right men, that is, men of\r\nmoney and character, to come forward. And I declare most solemnly,\r\nthat I am convinced that the Irish people would fall into line, and\r\nsee the bill thrown out with perfect quietude. Now the push has come,\r\nthey really do not want Home Rule, and, what is more, they absolutely\r\ndread it, and I firmly believe that a general election at the present\r\nmoment would send a majority of Unionists to power. The priests are\r\nworking for life and death. They see that this is their best chance,\r\nperhaps their very last opportunity. I am a Catholic; but then I am a\r\nParnellite, a Tory Parnellite. And I have no intention of bartering\r\naway my political freedom to my Church, which, in my opinion, should\r\nkeep clear of politics. The clergy have now advised payment of rent,\r\nso that the Government may not be embarrassed at a very critical\r\njuncture. And the tenants are paying their rent, although the present\r\nperiod is one of great agricultural depression. Look at this: The\r\nUlster farmers are terribly hard up, are complaining that they cannot\r\npay. This is the Protestant province, where the priests have little\r\nscope. But in Leinster, Munster, and Connaught, the people are paying\r\nthe landlord. The word has gone round--pay the landlord, whomever else\r\nyou don't pay! The oilcake man, the implement man, the shopkeeper, are\r\nnot getting their dues, but notwithstanding the pinch of the present\r\nmoment, the landlord (who knows all about it) is paid. And the priests\r\nin some cases are actually remitting the clerical dues to enable the\r\nsmall men to pay the rint. Pay the rint, say they, if you pledge your\r\nvery boots, if you have to go to the gombeen man (money-lender), if\r\nyou have almost to rob the Church. They want to get possession, they\r\nwant to get power, they want to get Home Rule; and then they know\r\nthat, as Scripture says, 'All these things shall be added unto them.'\r\nLet them once get the upper hand, and they can very soon recoup\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\"The priests are showing England their power, with a view to future\r\ngood bargains. 'You see what we can do,' say they. Arrange the matter\r\nwith us. We are the boys. The Reverend Father O'Codling is the man.\r\nHave no dealings, except such as are authorised by us, with the\r\nred-headed Tim Healy Short. The Clergy have only one idea; that is, of\r\ncourse, the predominance of their Church. Very natural, and, from\r\ntheir point of view, very proper. I find no fault with them, but I say\r\ntheir object hardly commends itself to my undivided admiration, and,\r\nbeing still friendly, we on this subject part company. I wish to let\r\nthe priests down easy. They are mostly very good men, apart from\r\npolitics. They are good customers to me, and they pay very promptly.\r\nThey spend their money in the country, and I'd have no fault to find\r\nif they'd lave politics alone. Mind that owld Gladstone doesn't become\r\na Papist all out. 'Twould be better for him, no doubt, and as the\r\nwhole jing-bang that turned round with him before would no doubt\r\nstill follow at his heels, we'd get a considerable quantity of\r\nconverts, if we could say little about the quality. D'ye hear what\r\nthat owld woman's singing?\"\r\n\r\nI listened with interest. The minstrelsy of Ireland seems to have\r\ndrifted into the hands of the most unpoetical people in the green\r\nisle. The poor old creature walked very, very slowly along the gutter,\r\never and anon giving herself a suggestive twitch, which plainly\r\nindicated some cutaneous titillation--the South is a grazing country.\r\nThis was all I heard--\r\n\r\n    Owld Oireland was Owld Oireland\r\n      Whin England was a pup.\r\n    Oireland will be Owld Oireland\r\n      Whin England's bur-r-sted up!\r\n\r\nIf my friends are right as to the change of feeling _re_ Home Rule,\r\nthe dear old lady was hardly up to date. But the great author of\r\n\"Dirty Little England\"--I judge of the author by the internal evidence\r\nof sentiment, style, and literary merit--certainly composed the above\r\nbeautiful stanza in the sure and certain hope that the present bill\r\nwould become law.\r\n\r\nNumber Three qualified his remarks on rent, when speaking of the\r\nCounty Clare. \"There they embarrass the Government by refusing to pay,\r\nand by shooting people in the good old way, just at the most ticklish\r\ntime.\" He said, \"Clare has always been an exceptional county. Clare\r\nreturned Daniel O'Connell, by him secured Catholic Emancipation, and\r\nfrom that time has called itself the premier county of Ireland. They\r\nare queer, unmanageable divils, are the Clare folks, and we are only\r\ndivided from them by the Shannon. So the Kerry folks go mad sometimes\r\nby contagion. I should advise you to keep away from Clare. You might\r\nget a shot-hole put into you. Every visitor is noticed in those lonely\r\nregions, and the little country towns only serve to disseminate the\r\narrival of a stranger to the rural districts. Suppose you walk five\r\nmiles out of Ennis the day after you arrive there, I would wager a\r\npound the first woman that sees you pass her cottage will say, 'That's\r\nthe Englishman that Maureen O'Hagan said was staying at the Queen's\r\nHotel.' The servants are regular spies, every one of them. I couldn't\r\nspeak politics in my house because I've a Catholic nurse. Good bye, I\r\nhope ye won't get shot.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked him for the interest expressed, but failed to share his\r\nnervousness. After having mingled with the Nationalist crowd that\r\nfollowed the Balfour column in the Dublin torchlight procession, after\r\nhaving escaped unhurt from the blazing Nationalists who swarm in the\r\nRoyal Victoria Hotel, Cork, having walked down the Limerick entrance\r\nto the balmy Tipperary, a little shooting, more or less, is unworthy a\r\nmoment's consideration. Besides which, my perpetual journeying and\r\ninterviewing and scribbling have made me so thin that Captain\r\nMoonlight himself would be bound to miss. However, it is well to be\r\nprepared for the worst, so--_Pax vobiscum_, and away to County Clare.\r\n\r\nTralee (Co. Kerry), April 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 12.--ENGLISH IGNORANCE AND IRISH PERVERSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA most enchanting place when you have time to look at it. My flying\r\nvisit of ten days ago gave the city no chance. Let me redeem this\r\nerror, so far as possible. There are two, if not three Limericks in\r\none, a shamrock tripartition, a trinity in unity,--English-town,\r\nIrish-town, and New Town Perry. New Limerick is a well-built city,\r\nwhich will compare favourably with anything reasonable anywhere. Much\r\nof it resembles the architecture of Bedford Square, London. The streets\r\nare broad and rectangular, the shops handsome and well furnished. But\r\nit is the natural features of the vicinity which \"knock\" the\r\nsusceptible Saxon. The Shannon, the classic Shannon, sweeps grandly\r\nthrough the town, winding romantically under the five great bridges,\r\nwashing the walls of the stupendous Castle erected by King John, the\r\nonly British sovereign who ever visited Limerick--serpentining through\r\nmeadows backed by mountains robed in purple haze, reflecting in its\r\nbroad mirror many a romantic and historic ruin, its banks dotted with\r\nsalmon-fishers pulling out great fish and knocking them on the head,\r\nits promenades abounding with the handsomest women in the world. For\r\nthe Limerick ladies are said to be the most beautiful in Ireland, and\r\ncompetent English judges--I know nothing of such matters--assure me\r\nthat the boast is justified. Get to Cruise's Royal Hotel, which for a\r\nhundred years has looked over the Shannon, take root in its airy, roomy\r\nprecincts, pleasant, clean, and sweet, with white-haired servitors like\r\nnoble earls in disguise to bring your ham and eggs, Limerick ham, mind\r\nyou, which at this moment fetches 114s. per cwt. in London; and with\r\nthe awful cliffs of Kilkee within easy distance, where the angry\r\nAtlantic Ocean, dashing with gigantic force against the rock-bound\r\ncoast, sends spray two or three miles inland, the falls of Castleconnel\r\nwith the salmon-fisheries under your very nose, and the four hours\r\nriver-steamer to Kilrush, with more Cathedrals, statues, antiquities,\r\ncuriosities, novelties, quaintnesses than could be described in a\r\nthree-volume novel--do all those things, and, while on your back in the\r\nsmoke room, after a hard day's pleasure, you will probably be heard to\r\nmurmur that in the general Fall some of us dropped easily enough, and\r\nthat, all things considered, Adam's unhappy collapse was decidedly\r\nexcusable.\r\n\r\nThe Limerick folks are said to be the most Catholic people in Ireland.\r\nThey are more loyal than the Corkers. Why is this? The more Catholic,\r\nthe more disloyal, is the general experience. Nobody whose opinion is\r\nworth anything will deny this, and however much you may wish to\r\ndissociate religion from politics, you cannot blink this fact. In\r\ndealing with important matters, it is useless to march a\r\nhair's-breadth beside the truth. Better go for it baldheaded, calling\r\nthings by their right names, taking your gruel, and standing by to\r\nreceive the lash. You are bound to win in the long run. I say the\r\nCatholic priests are disloyal to the Queen. Men of the old school, the\r\nfew who remain, are loyal, ardently loyal. The old-timers were\r\ngentlemen. They were sent to Douai or some other Continental\r\ntheological school, where they rubbed against gentlemen of broad\r\nculture, of extensive view, of perfect civilisation. They returned to\r\nIreland with a personal weight, a cultivation, a refinement, which\r\nmade them the salt of Irish earth. These men are still loyal. The\r\nMaynooth men, sons of small farmers, back-street shopkeepers,\r\npawnbrokers, and gombeen men, aided by British gold, these half-bred,\r\nhalf-educated absorbers of eleemosynary ecclesiasticism, are deadly\r\nenemies to the Empire. This is Mr. Bull's guerdon for the Maynooth\r\ngrant. My authority is undeniable. The statement is made on the\r\nassurance of eminent Catholics. Two Catholic J.P.'s yesterday\r\nconcurred in this, and no intelligent Irish Catholic will think\r\notherwise. Surely this consideration should be a factor in arguments\r\nagainst Home Rule.\r\n\r\nThen why are the Limerick Catholics loyal? Because the Limerick Bishop\r\nis loyal. Bishop O'Dwyer is opposed to Home Rule. Said Mr. James\r\nFrost, J.P., of George's Street: \"When the Bishop first came here he\r\ninvited some four hundred Catholics to a banquet at the palace. After\r\ndinner he proposed the health of the Queen, and all the company save\r\ntwo or three rose and received the toast with enthusiasm, waving their\r\nhandkerchiefs and showing an amount of warmth that was most gratifying\r\nto me. I need not tell you that an average Home Rule audience would\r\nnot have accepted the toast at all. This shows you the feeling of the\r\nmost intelligent Catholics. The people of education and property are\r\nloyal. It shows also that they are opposed to Home Rule.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if the best Catholics are opposed to Home Rule, why don't they\r\nsay so publicly?\"\r\n\r\n\"A fair question, which shall have a precise answer. But first, we\r\nmust go back to Mr. Balfour's great Land Act, and the lowering of the\r\nfranchise, and observe the effect of these two enactments.\r\n\r\n\"The people were at one time terribly ill-used. That is all over now,\r\nbut the memory still rankles. The Irish are great people for\r\ntradition. The landlords have for ages been the traditional embodiment\r\nof tyranny and religious ascendency. The Irish people have long\r\nmemories, very long memories. Englishmen would say: 'No matter what\r\nhappened to my great-grandfather; I am treated well, and that is\r\nenough for me.' Irishmen still go harping on the landlord, although he\r\nno longer has any power. The terrible history of the former\r\nrelationship between landlord and tenant is still kept up and\r\nremembered, and will be remembered for ages, if not for ever.\r\nPresently you will see the bearing of all this on your question--Why\r\ndo not the best Catholics come forward and speak against Home Rule?\r\n\r\n\"When the franchise was lowered the rebound from repression was\r\ntremendous, like a powerful spring that has been held down, or like an\r\nexplosive which is the more destructive in proportion as it is more\r\nconfined. People newly made free go to the opposite extreme.\r\nEmancipate a serf and he becomes insolent, he does not know how to use\r\nhis freedom, and becomes violent. The great majority of the people are\r\nsmarting from the old land laws, which have left a bitter animosity\r\nagainst English rule, which is popularly denounced as being\r\nresponsible for them.\r\n\r\n\"To speak against Home Rule is to associate yourself with the worst\r\naspects of the land question. The bulk of the people are incapable of\r\nmaking a distinction. And while they entertain some respect for a\r\nProtestant opponent, they are irreconcilable with Unionist Catholics,\r\njust as the English Gladstonians have a far more virulent dislike for\r\nthe Liberal Unionists than for the rankest Tories. They say to the\r\nProtestants, 'We know why you uphold Unionism'--that is, as they\r\nbelieve, landlordism--'for the landlords are English and Protestant;\r\nyour position is understandable.' But to the Catholic they say, 'You\r\nare not only an enemy, but a renegade, a traitor, and a deserter.' And\r\nwhatever that man's position may be, the people can make things\r\nuncomfortable for him.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Catholic living near, said: \"'How would Home Rule work?' you\r\nask. Most destructively, most ruinously. Under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, whether Home Rule passes or not, the country will not\r\nrecover the shock of the present agitation for many a year; not, I\r\nthink, in my lifetime. I was over in the North of England last year,\r\nand I found that the people there knew nothing of the question,\r\nliterally nothing. Clever men, intelligent men, men who had the ear of\r\nthe people, displayed a profundity of ignorance on Irish questions,\r\nconjoined with a confidence in discussing them, surpassing belief.\r\nThey changed their minds on hearing my statements, and on obtaining\r\nexact information. I must give them credit for that. I believe the\r\nEnglish Gladstonians are only suffering from ignorance. Their leader\r\nis certainly not less ignorant than the bleating flock at his heels.\r\nThey smugly argue from the known to the unknown on entirely false\r\npremises. They know that when Englishmen act in this or that way, such\r\nand such things will happen. They know what they themselves would do\r\nin certain conjunctures, and when they are told by Irishmen that\r\nIrishmen under similar conditions would act quite differently, they\r\nsnort and say 'nonsense.' They are too dense to appreciate the radical\r\ndifference between the two races. The breeds don't mix and don't\r\nunderstand each other. It was miserable to hear these men--I am sure\r\nthey were good men--prattling like bib-and-tucker babies about Irish\r\naffairs, and speaking of Gladstone as possessing a quality which we\r\nCatholics only ascribe to the Pope. Ha! ha! They think that vain old\r\ncataract of verbiage to be infallible. He knows nothing of the matter,\r\ndoes not understand the tools he is working with, any one of whom\r\ncould buy and sell him and simple, clever Morley twenty times over.\r\nBoth Gladstone and Morley _are_ clever in books, in words, in\r\ntheories, adepts in debating, smart and adroit in talk. But they know\r\nno more of Paddy than the babe unborn. I say nothing of Harcourt and\r\nthe other understrappers. They'll say anything that suits, whatever it\r\nmay be. We reckoned them up long since. Cannot the English people see\r\nthrough these nimble twisters and time-servers, this crowd of lay\r\nVicars of Bray?\"\r\n\r\nCatholic Home Ruler Number Three said, \"I agree with all who say that\r\nthe priests would do their best to secure a dominating influence in\r\npolitical affairs. And although I think we ought to have an Irish\r\nLegislature, although I believe it would be good for us, yet if the\r\npriestly influence were to become supreme for one moment of time--if\r\nyou tell me that the Catholic Church is to hold the reins for one\r\nsecond, then I say, away with Home Rule, away with it for ever! Better\r\nstay as we are.\"\r\n\r\nThis gentleman seems to have about as much logical foresight as some\r\nof those he criticises. He dreads priestly domination above\r\neverything, and yet would approve of giving the priests a chance of\r\nbeing masters. He continued:--\r\n\r\n\"The present Irish leaders are the curse of the movement, which,\r\nshould it succeed, would in their hands bring untold sorrows on the\r\ncountry. As a Catholic Home Ruler, I put up my hands in supplication,\r\nand I beg, I implore of the English people to withhold their assent.\r\nFor God's sake don't give it us at present. We must have it sooner or\r\nlater, but wait till we have leaders we can trust. Have you met a\r\ndecent Home Ruler who trusts the present men? No. I knew you would say\r\nso. Such a man cannot be found in Ireland. Then why send them to\r\nParliament, say you? That is just what you Englishmen do not\r\nunderstand. That is one of the points old Gladstone is wrecking the\r\ncountry on. You think it unanswerable. Listen to me.\r\n\r\n\"When the franchise was lowered, then the mistake was made. You let in\r\nan immense electorate utterly incapable of discussing any question of\r\nState; and, rushing from the extreme of abject servility to a sort of\r\ntyrannical mastery, they elected as their representatives, not the\r\nmost able men, not the most orderly men, not the men of some training\r\nand education, not the men who had some stake in the country, but the\r\nmost violent men, the glibbest men, the most factious, the most\r\ncontumacious, the most pragmatical men were the men they elected. Look\r\nat the Poor-Law Boards. See the set sent there. Those are the men who\r\nwill be sent to the Dublin Parliament. Are they men to be trusted with\r\nthe affairs of State? Look up your Burke, and observe the\r\nqualifications he thinks necessary to a statesman. Then look at the\r\nblacksmith who represents the county Tipperary, the mason who\r\nrepresents Meath, the drapers' assistants and bacon factors' clerks\r\nwho represent other places. You don't quite see this in England. These\r\nmen perhaps tell you that they are kings in their own country.\r\nIreland is a long way off, and far-away hills are green.\r\n\r\n\"Reverse the situation. Let Dublin be the seat of Empire and London\r\nwanting Home Rule. You really want it, and think it would be best for\r\nboth--a convenience for yourself and a saving of time for all. Would\r\nyou not draw back at the last moment if under the circumstances I have\r\nnamed, your country was to be handed over to fellows whose sole income\r\nwas derived from their political work, artisans, clerks, and\r\nshopkeepers' assistants? What would these men do with their power?\r\nMake haste to be rich--nothing more. Patriots are they? Rubbish; they\r\nare mere mercenaries. Parnell knew that. He said to me:--\r\n\r\n\"'Under the circumstances I must use these men, whom I would not\r\notherwise touch with a forty-foot pole. Adversity makes us acquainted\r\nwith strange bedfellows. Any port is good in a storm. These men will\r\nfight well--for their pay, and will work the thing up. But when we get\r\nthe bill, when we come into power, their work is done. They will be\r\ndropped at once, or furnished with places where they may get an honest\r\nliving.'\"\r\n\r\nCatholic Home Ruler Number Four said: \"The Meath election shows the\r\nfeeling of the priests, and what they would do if they could. They\r\nloathed Parnell, but he was too strong for them. And weren't they glad\r\nto give him the slip on the ground of morality. Home Rule was\r\ncomparatively a safe thing while Parnell lived. Now I would not advise\r\nit for some years. We must have better men to the fore. We in Limerick\r\nare loyal, although Catholics and Home Rulers. Don't laugh at that. It\r\nis a fact, though I admit it is hard to believe. Put it down, if you\r\nlike, to the influence of the Bishop. The young priests I say nothing\r\nabout. Their loyalty is a negligeable quantity. They do not object to\r\nProtestants _qua_ Protestants, but they object to them as\r\nrepresentatives of English rule.\"\r\n\r\nThis reminded me of Dr. Kane, of Belfast, who said to me, \"They hate\r\nus, not because we are Protestants, not because we are Orangemen, not\r\nbecause we are strangers in the land, but because we are the hated\r\nEnglish garrison.\"\r\n\r\nHere I am bound to interpolate a word of qualification. The Mardyke\r\npromenade of Cork, a mile-long avenue of elms, has many comfortable\r\nseats, whereon perpetually do sit the \"millingtary\" of the\r\nsacrilegious Saxon, holding sweet converse with the Milesian\r\ncounterparts of the Saxon Sarah Ann. The road is full of them, Tommy's\r\nyellow-striped legs marching with the neat kirtle of Nora, Sheela, or\r\nMaureen. As it was in the Isle of Saints, so it was in Ulster, is now\r\nin Limerick, and shall be in Hibernia _in sæcula sæculorum_. A\r\nLimerick constable said, \"A regiment will come into the city at four\r\no'clock, and at eight they'll every man walk out a girl. The\r\ninfatuation of the servant-girl class for the military is surprisin'.\r\nOnly let them walk out with a soldier, and they 'chuck' everything,\r\neven Home Rule.\" The hated garrison are not among the people who\r\nnever will be missed. Wherever Tommy goes he seems to be able to\r\nsample the female population. The soldiers always have a rare good\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nA carman who drove me to Castleconnel proved the most interesting\r\npolitician since Dennis Mulcahy, of Carrignaheela. He knew all about\r\nthe average English voter, and resented his superior influence in\r\nIrish affairs. \"Shure, we're all undher the thumb o' a set o' black\r\nmen that lives undher the bowils o' the airth. Yer honner must know\r\nall about thim miners in the Black Counthry, an' in Wales, an' the\r\nNarth o' England? Ye didn't? Ah, now, ye're jokin' me, ye take me for\r\nan omadhaun all out. Ye know all about it; ye know that these poor men\r\ngoes down, an' down, an' down, till ye'd think they'd niver shtop, an'\r\nthat they stay there a whole week afore they come up agin. An' then\r\nthey shtand in tubs while their wives an' sweethearts washes an'\r\nscrubs thim, an' makes white men out o' the black men that comes up,\r\nan' thin walks thim off home. Now, shtandin' in a tub at the mouth o'\r\nthe pit to be washed by yer wimmenfolks is what we wouldn't do in this\r\ncounthry--'tisn't black naygurs we are--an' these men that lives in\r\nthe dark and have no time to think, an' nothin' to think wid, these\r\nare the men ye put to rule this counthry, men that they print sich\r\nrubbish as _Tit-Bits_ for, because they couldn't understand sinse. An'\r\nthe man that first found out that they couldn't understand sinse, an'\r\ngave thim somethin' that wanted no brains, they say has made a\r\nfortune. Is that thrue, now?\r\n\r\n\"As for owld Gladstone, I wouldn't trust him out o' me sight. We'll\r\nget no Home Rule, the owld thrickster doesn't mane it. 'Tis like a man\r\nI knew that was axed to lind a friend £100. He didn't like to lind,\r\nan' he was afeared to say No, an' he was in a quondairy intirely. So,\r\nsays he 'I'll lind ye the money,' says he, 'if ye'll bring the\r\nsecurities down to the bank,' says he, 'an' get the cash off me\r\nbanker.' Thin he went saycretly to the banker, an' says he, 'This\r\nthievin' blayguard,' says he, 'wants the money, and he'll never repay\r\nme; I wouldn't thrust him,' says he. 'Now, will ye help me, for I\r\ncouldn't say No, by raison he's a relative, an' an owld acquaintance,'\r\nsays he.\r\n\r\n\"'An' how'll I do that?' says the banker.\r\n\r\n\"'Ye can tur-rn up yer nose at the securities.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ha, Ha,' says the banker, 'is it there ye are? Ye're a deep one;\r\nbegorra ye are. Nabocklish,' says he, 'I'll do it for ye,' says he.\r\n\r\n\"So whin the borrower wint for the money, the banker sent out word\r\nthat the securities wor not good enough, an' that he wouldn't advance\r\na farden.\r\n\r\n\"Then the borrower goes to his frind an' complains, an' thin the frind\r\nacts all out the way Gladstone'll act when the bill's refused at the\r\nLords, or may be at the Commons. 'Hell to him,' he roars, 'the\r\nblayguard thief iv a thievin' banker. I'll tache him to refuse a\r\nfrind, says he. 'Sarve him right,' says he, 'av I bate his head into\r\na turnip-mash an' poolverise him into Lundy Foot snuff. May be I\r\nwon't, whin I meet him, thrash him till the blood pours down his\r\nheels,' says he. That'll be the way iv it. That's what Gladstone will\r\nsay whin the bill's lost, which he manes it to be, the conthrivin'\r\nowld son o' a schamer.\r\n\r\n\"A gintleman axed me which o' them I like best o' the two Home Rule\r\nBills, an' I towld him that whin I lived at Ennis, an' drove a car at\r\nthe station there, the visithors, Americans an' English, would be\r\naxin' me whin they lepped on the car which was the best hotel in\r\nEnnis. Now, whiniver I gave them my advice they would be cur-rsin' an'\r\nsinkin' at me whin they met me aftherwards in the sthreet, be raison\r\nthat there was only two hotels in the place, an' nayther o' thim was\r\nat all aiqual to what they wor used to in their own counthries. So I\r\ngot to know this, an' iver afther, whin they would be sayin' to me,\r\n\r\n\"'Which is the best hotel in Ennis?' says they, an' I would answer,\r\n\r\n\"'Faix, there's only two o' thim, an' to whichiver one ye go ye will\r\nbe sorrowin' that ye didn't go to the other,' says I.\r\n\r\n\"An' that's my reply as to which of the two Home Rule Bills I like\r\nbest.\"\r\n\r\nIn the city of Limerick itself all is quiet and orderly. Outside,\r\nthings are different. Disturbed parts of the County Clare are\r\ndangerous to strangers, and, what is more to the point, somewhat\r\ndifficult of access. The country is not criss-crossed with railways as\r\nin England, and vehicles for long journeys are rather hard to get.\r\nHowever, I have chartered a car for a three-day trip into what may be\r\ncalled the interior, have fired several hundred cartridges from a\r\nWinchester repeating rifle, and written letters to my dearest friends.\r\nI start to-morrow, and if I do not succeed in bottoming the recent\r\noutrages--which are hushed up as much as possible, and of which the\r\nlocal newspaper-men, both Nationalist and Conservative, together with\r\nHead-Constable MacBrinn, declare they cannot get at the precise\r\nparticulars--if I cannot get to the root of the matter, I shall in my\r\nnext letter have the honour of stating the reason why.\r\n\r\nLimerick, April 22nd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 13.--THE CURSE OF COUNTY CLARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce again the difference between Ireland and England is forcibly\r\nexemplified. It was certain that several moonlighting expeditions had\r\nrecently been perpetrated in the neighbourhood of Limerick, which is\r\nonly divided by the Shannon from the County Clare. You walk over a\r\nbridge in the centre of the city and you change your county, but\r\nnobody in Limerick seems to know anything about the matter. The local\r\npapers hush up the outrages when they hear of them, which is seldom or\r\nnever. The people who know anything will not, dare not tell, and even\r\nthe police have the utmost difficulty in establishing the bare facts\r\nof any given case. English publicity is entirely unknown. Local\r\ncorrespondents do not always exist in country towns, and the distances\r\nare so great, in comparison with the facilities for travel, that\r\nnewspaper-men seldom or never visit the scene of the occurrence. And\r\nbesides the awkward and remote position of the country hamlets and\r\nmountain farms, there are other excellent reasons for journalistic\r\nreticence. The people do not wish to read such news, the editors do\r\nnot wish to print these discreditable records, and the police,\r\nalthough eminently and invariably civil and obliging, are debarred by\r\ntheir official position from disclosing what they know. The very\r\nvictims themselves are often silent, refusing to give details, and\r\nalmost always declining to give evidence. That the sufferers usually\r\nknow and could easily identify the cowardly ruffians who so cruelly\r\nmaltreat them is a well-ascertained fact. That they usually declare\r\nthey have no clue to the offenders is equally well known. The\r\ndifficulty of arresting suspected men is enhanced by the fact that the\r\nmoonlighters have a complete system of scouts who in this bare and\r\nthinly populated district, descry the police when miles away, giving\r\ntimely warning to the marauders; these, besides, are readily concealed\r\nby their neighbours and friends, who in this display an ingenuity and\r\nenthusiasm worthy a better cause. Suppose the villains are caught\r\nred-handed; even then the difficulties are by no means over. In\r\nIreland a felon once in the hands of the police, by that one\r\ncircumstance at once and for ever becomes a hero, a martyr, a man to\r\nbe excused, to be prayed for, to be worshipped. No matter how black\r\nhis offence, the touch of the constabulary washes him whiter than\r\nsnow, purifies him from every earthly taint, surrounds him with a halo\r\nof sanctity. Those whom he has injured will not bear witness against\r\nhim, because their temerity might cost them their lives, the loss of\r\ntheir property, the esteem of their fellow-men. What this means we\r\nshall shortly see. The cases I have examined will speak for\r\nthemselves. And let it be remembered that close proximity to the\r\nscenes described produces an incomparably stronger effect than any\r\ndescription, however minute, however painstaking. The utter\r\nlawlessness of the districts I have visited since penning Monday's\r\nletter has produced a profound, an indelible impression. I pass over\r\nthe means employed to get over the ground, merely stating that\r\nhorseflesh has borne the brunt of the business. That and pedestrianism\r\nare the only means available, with untold patience and perseverance to\r\nworm out the true story. People will not show the way, or will direct\r\nyou wrongly. Their ignorance, that is, their assumed ignorance, is\r\nwonderful, incredible. They are all sthrangers in those parts. They\r\nnever knew a family of that name, never heard of any moonlighting,\r\nswear that the amusement is unknown thereabouts, assert that the\r\nwhole thing is a fabrication of the police. All the people round are\r\ndecent, honest, hard-working folks, without a fault; pious, virtuous,\r\nimmaculate. You push on, and your friend runs after you. Stay a\r\nmoment, something has struck him. Just at the last distressing hour,\r\nhis brain displayed amazing power. Now he comes to think of it,\r\nsomething was said to have happened over there, at Ballygammon, ten\r\nmiles in the opposite direction. A stack was fired, and they said it\r\nwas the Boys. It was the police who burnt the hay, but they deny it\r\n\"av coorse.\" He is suspiciously anxious to afford all the information\r\nhe can. Ballygammon is the spot, and Tim Mugphiller your man. Mention\r\nMike Delany and you will get every information, and--have ye a screw\r\nof tobacky these hard times. You pursue your way certain that at last\r\nyou are on the right track, and Mike's jaw drops to his knees. Too\r\nlate he sees that his only chance of altering your course was to point\r\nout the right one.\r\n\r\nDropping for once scenery and surroundings, let us at once plunge, as\r\nHorace advises, _in medias res_. The district in Mr. Balfour's time\r\nwas pleasant and peaceable. Curiously enough its troubles commenced\r\nwith the change of Government. From March 18 to April 18 the police of\r\nNewcastlewest received tidings of fifteen outrages. How many have been\r\nperpetrated no man living can tell, for people often think it wisest\r\nto hold their peace. Ireland is often said to be almost free from\r\ncrime, except of the agrarian kind, and moonlighting is partly\r\ncondoned by reason of its alleged cause. How must we class the\r\nfollowing case?\r\n\r\nOn February 19, 1893, four armed men with blackened faces and dressed\r\nas women, attacked the dwelling of T. Donoghue, of Boola, not far from\r\nNewcastle. They burst open the door and entered, not to revenge any\r\nreal or fancied wrong, but purely and simply to obtain possession of a\r\nsum of £150, which Donoghue's daughter had brought from America. They\r\nbelieved they would have an easy prey, but they were mistaken; there\r\nwere two or three men in the house, and the heroes decamped instanter,\r\nfollowed, unknown to themselves, by one of Donoghue's family. Having\r\nduly run them to earth, he informed the police, who caught them neatly\r\nenough, their shoes covered with fresh mud, and with every\r\ncircumstance of guilt. The Donoghue folks identified them. The case\r\nwas perfectly clear--that is the expressed opinion of everybody I have\r\nmet, official and otherwise. It was tried at the Limerick Spring\r\nAssizes, and the jury returned a verdict of \"Not guilty!\" These\r\npatriotic jurors had doubtless much respect for their oaths, more for\r\nthe interests of justice, more still for their own skins. This case is\r\npublic property, and is only cited to prove that when the difficulty\r\nof arrest and the greater difficulty of obtaining evidence are with\r\ninfinite pains overcome, the jury will not convict, no matter what the\r\ncrime. Before he commences his career of crime, the moonlight marauder\r\nknows the chances of being caught are immensely in his favour, that\r\nshould luck in this matter be against him, his very victim will\r\ndecline to identify him, nay, will affirm that he is not the man, and\r\nthat when the worst comes to the worst, no jury in the counties of\r\nKerry, Clare, or Limerick will convict.\r\n\r\nHere are some results of my researches. The particulars of these cases\r\nnow first appear in print.\r\n\r\nA man named James Dore, who keeps a public-house in Bridge Street,\r\nNewcastlewest--I can vouch for his beer--also held a small farm of\r\nforty-nine acres from the Earl of Devon, for which he paid the modest\r\nrent of £11 10s. per annum--the land maintaining sixteen cows and\r\ncalves, which, on the usual local computation of £10 profit on each\r\ncow, would leave a gain of £148 10s.--not a bad investment, as Irish\r\nfarming goes. So it was considered, and when the tenant-right was\r\nannounced as for sale by auction, two cousins of Dore, who held farms\r\ncontiguous, agreed to jointly bid for the tenant-right, and having\r\nsecured the land, to arrange its partition between themselves. They\r\nwent to £400, but this was not regarded as enough, and the\r\ntenant-right was for a specified time held over for purchase by\r\nprivate agreement. A farmer named William Quirke offered £590, which\r\nwas accepted, and the money paid. After this, the two cousins came\r\nforward and said they would purchase the tenant-right, offering £40\r\nmore than Quirke had paid. They were told that they were too late, and\r\nthe Earl's agent (Mr. Curling) said nothing could now be done. This\r\nwas on the 13th of the present month of April. On the 14th, Mr. James\r\nCooke, Lord Devon's bailiff, was seen showing the purchaser Quirke\r\nover the newly-acquired holding. Poor Quirke little knew what was at\r\nthat moment hanging over him. He had not long to wait. The dastard\r\ndemon of moonlight ruffianism was on his track.\r\n\r\nQuirke had a son aged fourteen years, but looking two years younger, a\r\nsimple peasant lad, who cannot have injured his country very much. He\r\nwas tending a cow, which required watching, his father and mother\r\ntaking their rest while the child sat out the lonely hours in the\r\ncowhouse. He heard something, and listened with all his ears. Not\r\nvoices, but a subdued whispering. It was the dead hour of night, two\r\nor half-past two, and the boy was frightened. The place is lonely,\r\nseven miles or more from Newcastlewest, and up towards the mountains.\r\nHe listened and listened, and again heard the mysterious sounds. He\r\nsays he \"thought it was the fairies.\" He stole from the byre and went\r\nto the house. A horrible dread had crept over him, and father and\r\nmother were there. As he opened the door a terrible blow from behind\r\nstruck him down. He was not stunned, though felled by the butt-end of\r\na gun. They beat and kicked him as he lay. He gave an anguished cry.\r\nThe mother heard and recognised her boy's voice, and, waking the\r\nfather, said \"Go down, they're killing my lad.\" The old man, for he is\r\nan old man, went down the stairs naked and unarmed. The foul marauders\r\nmet him half-way up, and served him as they had served the boy,\r\nthrowing him down, kicking him, and beating him with butt-ends of\r\nguns; with one terrible blow breaking three of his ribs; and saying,\r\n\"Give it up, give it up.\" He said he would \"give it up\"; promised by\r\nall he held sacred, begged hard for his life, and implored them at\r\nleast to spare the young lad. Their reply to this was to fire a charge\r\nof shot into the boy's legs, a portion of the charge entering the\r\nlimbs of an old woman--his grandmother, I think--who was feebly trying\r\nto shield the lad. This was such excellent sport that more was thought\r\nexpedient. A charge of shot was fired into the father's legs, and as\r\none knee-joint is injured, the elder Quirke's condition is precarious\r\neven without his broken ribs and other injuries. The cowardly hounds\r\nthen left, in their horrid disguise adding a new terror to the lonely\r\nnight. The evening's entertainment was not yet over. They crossed a\r\ncouple of fields to a house where dwelt Quirke's married son. They\r\nburst open the door of his cottage and dragged the young fellow--he is\r\nabout twenty-five--from his bed, beating him sorely, and in the\r\npresence of his wife firing a charge of shot into his legs. Then they\r\nwent home, each man to his virtuous couch, to dream fair dreams of the\r\ncoming Paradise, when they and their kind may work their own sweet\r\nwill, free from the fear of a hireling constabulary, and under the\r\nægis of a truly national senate, given to a grateful country by a\r\nGrand Old Man.\r\n\r\nThe Quirkes know their assailants, but they will not tell. \"What good\r\nwould it do me to have men imprisoned?\" says William Quirke, senior.\r\n\"My lad's life might pay for it, and perhaps my own.\" The most\r\ninfluential people of the district have remonstrated with him, argued,\r\npersuaded, all in vain. William Quirke has a wish to remain in this\r\nsublunary sphere. His spirit is not anxious to take unto itself the\r\nwings of a dove, that it may fly away and be at rest. Like the dying\r\nMethodist, whose preacher reminded him of the beauties of Paradise, he\r\nlikes \"about here pretty well.\" Mr. Heard, Divisional Commissioner in\r\ncharge of the constabulary organisation of the Counties of Cork,\r\nLimerick, and Kerry can get nothing out of William Quirke.\r\nCounty-inspector Moriarty can stir nothing, nor Major Rolleston,\r\nResident Magistrate, nor Inspectors Wright, Pattison, and Huddy, all\r\nof whom have done their level best. These gentlemen assert that\r\nobviously Quirke knows the moonlighters, and for my own part, I am\r\ncertain of it. The married son is equally dumb. \"They were disguised,\"\r\nhe says. \"But you would recognise their voices.\" Then comes the\r\nstrangest assertion, \"They never spoke a word.\" In other words, he\r\naffirms that a number of men, not less than seven or eight, burst open\r\nhis door, dragged him from bed, maltreated and shot him, to the\r\naccompaniment of his wife's terrified screaming and his own\r\nprotestations, without uttering a single syllable! The bold\r\nGladstonians whose influence removed Mr. Balfour from office and\r\ndelivered the country into ruffian hands, will say: And serve the\r\npeople right! If they will not bear witness let the victims suffer.\r\nYou cannot help people who will not help themselves. The police are\r\nthere, the magistrates are there, the prisons are there, the hangman,\r\nif need be, is there. If they will not avail themselves of the\r\nprotection provided, let them suffer. Let them go at it. All their own\r\nfault. Nobody but themselves to blame.\r\n\r\nAll very plausible and reasonable--in theory. Let us look a little\r\ncloser into this matter. What does William Quirke say:--\"Nobody can\r\nhelp an Irish farmer in a lonely part of Ireland. There are too many\r\nways of getting at him. Suppose I gave such evidence as would satisfy\r\nanybody--I do not say I could--I don't know anything; but suppose I\r\nknew and told, would a Limerick jury convict? Certainly not. Everybody\r\nknows that. The police, the magistrates, will tell you that, every one\r\nof them. Nobody will say anything else. Then, why rouse more enmity? I\r\nshall give up the land even if I lose the money, the savings of a\r\nlife-time, added to a loan, which I can repay in time. That is\r\nsettled. What good would the land do me, once I were dead? I value my\r\nlife more than my money, and more especially do I think of those\r\nbelonging to me. Suppose I held on, and kept the land. Every time the\r\nlad went out I'd expect him to be brought in shot to his mother and\r\nme. And when I saw the lad's dead face, what would I think? And what\r\nwould I say when his mother turned round and said, 'Ye have the land,\r\nhaven't ye, William?' Our lives would not be worth twopence if I held\r\non. Do you remember Carey, the informer? The British Empire couldn't\r\nprotect him, though it shipped him across the world. How would I be\r\namong the mountains here? I could be shot going to or coming from\r\nmarket, my cattle houghed or mutilated, nobody would buy from me,\r\nnobody would sell to me, nobody would work on my farm. My stacks would\r\nbe burnt. Look at the hay burnt in the last few weeks! You say I'd get\r\na presentment against the county--and if I did I'd have to wait till\r\nnext March for the money. Where's the capital to carry on? Suppose I\r\nwanted thirty tons of hay between this and that. That would cost £90.\r\nWhere would I get the money? But that's not it. Life is dear, and life\r\nmight at any moment be taken. If my stacks were burnt in July I'd have\r\nto wait a year for my money. I'd be cut off from all communication\r\nwith the people, and shunned as if I'd the plague. If I went to market\r\nthe people would leave the road to me, would cross over to the other\r\nside when they saw me coming. You never saw boycotting; you don't know\r\nwhat it means.\"\r\n\r\nIn a lonely stretch of gorse-bordered road, steep and rough, I came\r\nupon two members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, with rifles,\r\nsword-bayonets, and bâtons. We had a chat, and I examined their short\r\nSniders while they admired the humble Winchester I carried for\r\ncompany, and which on one occasion had acted like a charm. They\r\ncarried buckshot cartridges and ball, and had no objection to express\r\ntheir views. \"Balfour was the man to keep the country quiet. Two\r\nresident magistrates could convict, and the blackguards knew that, if\r\ncaught, it was all up with them. They are the most cowardly vermin on\r\nthe face of the earth, for although if any of our men (who never go\r\nsingly, but always in twos or threes) were to appear unarmed, they'd\r\nbe murdered at sight. Yet although they often fire on us, they mostly\r\ndo it from such distances that their bullets have no effect, so that\r\nthey can run away the moment they pull the trigger. Lately things have\r\nbeen looking rather blue over there.\" One pointed to the hills\r\ndividing the county from Kerry. \"The Kerry men are getting rifles. I\r\nknow the 'ping' of the brutes only too well. Let them get a few men\r\nwho know their weapons, and we'll be potted at five hundred yards\r\neasily enough. Yes, they have rifles now, and what for? To shoot\r\nsparrows? No. You can't guess? Give it up? Ye do? Then I'll tell you.\r\nTo carry out the Home Rule Bill. Yes, I do think so. Will you tell me\r\nthis? Who will in future collect rates and taxes? The tenants do not\r\nthink they will have any more rent to pay. Lots of them will tell you\r\nthat. These very men have the members of the Irish Parliament in their\r\nhands. That is; they can return whomsoever they choose. The\r\nrepresentation of the country is in their hands. And the priests agree\r\nwith them. No difference there, their object is one and the same, and\r\nwhen the priests and the farmers unite, who can compel them to pay up?\r\nIs the Irish Legislature which will be returned by these men--is it a\r\nlikely body to compel payment of tribute to the hated Saxon at the\r\npoint of the bayonet? When the British Government, with all the\r\nresources of Gladstonian civilisation, failed to put down boycotting,\r\nhow do you suppose a sympathetic Government, returned by the farmers,\r\nconsisting of farmers' sons, with a sprinkling of clever attorneys,\r\nmore smart than honest, will proceed with compulsory action? Why they\r\ncould do nothing if they wished, but then they will have no desire to\r\ncompel. The English people are only commencing their troubles. They\r\ndon't know they're born yet. Gladstone will have some explaining to\r\ndo, but he can do it, he can do it. He'd explain the shot out of the\r\nQuirke family's legs. Ah! but he's a terrible curse to this country.\"\r\n\r\nThe other officer said:--\"Our duty is very discouraging. We are\r\nhindered and baffled on every side by the people, whose sympathies are\r\nalways against the law. Now in England your sympathies are with the\r\nlaw, and the people have the sense to support it, knowing that it will\r\nsupport them, so long as they do the right thing. It was bad enough to\r\nhave the people against us, but now things are a hundred times worse.\r\nWhen Balfour was in power, we felt that our labour was not in vain. We\r\nfelt that there was some chance of getting a conviction--not much,\r\nperhaps, but still a chance. Now, if we catch the criminals redhanded,\r\nwe know no jury will convict. We try to do our duty, but of course we\r\ncan't put the same heart into it as we could if we thought our work\r\nwould do any good. And another thing--we knew Balfour, so long as we\r\nwere acting with integrity, would back us up. Now we never know what\r\nwe're going to get--whether we shall be praised or kicked behind. This\r\nGovernment is not only weak but also slippery. Outrages are\r\nincreasing. News of three more reached the Newcastlewest Barracks this\r\nvery day. We had a man on horseback scouring the mountains for\r\ninformation. The outraged people sometimes keep it close. What's the\r\ngood, they say. We hear of the affair from other people, and the\r\nprincipals, so to speak, ask us to make no fuss about it, as they\r\ndon't want to be murdered. The country is getting worse every day.\r\nWe'll have such a bloody winter as Ireland never saw.\"\r\n\r\nAnother small moonlighting incident, now appearing for the first time\r\non this or any other stage. Some tenants years ago were evicted on the\r\nLangford estates. Negotiations were proceeding for their proximate\r\nrestoration, but nothing could be settled. A few days ago a small\r\nfarmer named Benjamin Brosna, aged 55, agreed with the proper\r\nauthorities to graze some cattle on the land in question pending the\r\narrangement of the matter. A meeting at Haye's Cross was immediately\r\nconvened by two holy men of the district, to wit, Father Keefe, P.P.,\r\nand Father Brew, C.C., both of Meelin, and under the guidance of these\r\ngood easy men, it was resolved that any man grazing cattle on the\r\nLangford land was as bad as the landlord, and must be treated\r\naccordingly. On the same day, April 18, or rather in the night\r\nsucceeding the day of the meeting, eleven masked and armed men entered\r\nBrosna's house, and one of them, presenting a gun, said, \"We have you\r\nnow, you grass-grabber.\" Brosna seized the gun, and being hale and\r\nactive, despite his 55 years, showed such vigorous fight that he fell\r\nthrough the doorway into the yard along with two others, where he was\r\nbrutally beaten, and must have been killed--it was their clear\r\nintention--but for the pitchy darkness of the yard and the number of\r\nhis assailants, who in their fury fell over each other, enabling\r\nBrosna, who being on his own ground knew the ropes better than they,\r\nin the darkness to glide under a cart and escape over an adjacent\r\nwall, where he hid himself. They lost him, and returned to the house,\r\nfiring shots at whatever they could damage, and smashing everything\r\nbreakable, from the windows upwards. Brosna will lose the sight of one\r\neye, which is practically beaten out. His servants, named Larkin, have\r\nbeen compelled to leave by means of threatening letters. Their father\r\nhas also been threatened with death unless he instantly removes them\r\nfrom Brosna's house.\r\n\r\nI could continue indefinitely, continuing my remarks to the\r\noccurrences of one month or so; and if I abruptly conclude it is\r\nbecause time presses, my return to civilisation having been effected\r\nat 3.30 this morning, after a ten miles' mountain walk, followed by\r\nthree hours' ride in the blissful bowels of an empty cattle-truck.\r\nBut for the good Samaritan of a luggage train I must last night have\r\ncamped beneath the canopy of heaven. No scarcity of fun in\r\nIreland--which beats the world for sparkling incident.\r\n\r\nRathkeale (Co. Limerick), April 24th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 14.--LAWLESSNESS AND LAZINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fruits of Gladstonian rule are ripening fast. Mr. Morley's visit\r\nto Cork _en route_ for Dublin corresponds with Inspector Moriarty's\r\nvisit to the Irish capital. Mr. Moriarty is the county inspector in\r\nwhose district most of the recent outrages have been perpetrated, and\r\nis therefore able to give the Irish Secretary plenty of news. His\r\nreport will doubtless remain secret, as it is sensational. Mr. Morley\r\nhas too much regard for the sensibilities of Mr. and Mrs. Bull, and\r\nwhen the Limerick inspector, entering the State confessional of Dublin\r\nCastle, advances and says, \"I could a tale unfold whose lightest word\r\nWould harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes,\r\nlike stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks\r\nto part, And each particular hair to stand on end, Like quills upon\r\nthe fretful porcupine,\"--when Mr. Moriarty utters the familiar and\r\nappropriate words the Irish Secretary will say with deprecatory\r\ngesture, \"Enough, enough. 'Twas ever thus. This is the effect of\r\nkindness. What ho, my henchmen bold! A flagon, a mighty flagon of most\r\nancient sack. I feel that I am about to be prostrated. Such is the\r\nfate of greatness. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown. It is a\r\ngreat and glorious thing, To be an Irish Sec. But give to me my hollow\r\ntree, A crust of bread and liberty. The word is porpentine, not\r\nporcupine, Mr. Inspector. A common corruption. Verify your quotations.\r\nHave them (in future) attested by two resident magistrates. And now to\r\nwork. All in strict confidence. Let not the world hear of these\r\nthings. Let not the people know that violence and rapine walk\r\nhand-in-hand with my administration. Nameless in dark oblivion let it\r\ndwell. Let it be _sub rosâ, sub sigillâ confessionis, sub-auditer,\r\nsub_ everything. Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in Askalon, for\r\nbehold, if the people heard, they would marvel, and fear greatly;\r\nand--be afraid.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer would then produce his budget, with its horrors, its\r\nindecencies, its record of trickery, treachery, cowardly revenge, and\r\nmidnight terrorism. The local press correspondents of the rural\r\ndistricts are nearly all Nationalists, and they either furnish garbled\r\nreports, or none at all. The reporters of Conservative papers,\r\ncomparatively Conservative, I mean, are also Nationalists. The Irish\r\nthemselves know not what is taking place ten miles away. How is\r\nEngland to learn the precise state of things? I have fished up a few\r\nrecent samples of minor occurrences which will form part of Mr.\r\nMoriarty's news. These smaller outrages invariably lead up to murder\r\nif the victim resist. They are so many turns of the screw, just to let\r\nthe recalcitrant feel what can be done. In the large majority of cases\r\nhe gives way at the first hint. Let us relate some neighbouring\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nDavid Geary, of Castlemahon, late in the evening heard an explosion at\r\nthe door of his cottage. He ran out, and found a fuse burning, lying\r\nwhere it had been cast, while a volley of large stones whizzed past\r\nhis head. There had been some litigation between a man named Callaghan\r\nand a road contractor, and Geary had allowed the road contractor's men\r\nto take their food in wet weather under his roof.\r\n\r\nOn April 15, at two in the morning, a party of masked moonlighters\r\nvisited the cottage of Mrs. Breens, of Raheenish, and having fired two\r\nshots through the parlour window, shattering the woodwork by way of\r\nletting the widow know they were there, fired a third through her\r\nbed-room window to expedite the lady's movements. Almost paralysed\r\nwith fear, she parleyed with the besieging force, which, by its\r\nspokesman, demanded her late husband's gun, threatening to put\r\n\"daylight through her\" unless it were instantly given up. It was in\r\nher son's possession, and she hurried to his room. The young dog came\r\non the scene, and instead of handing out the gun, fired two shots from\r\na revolver into the darkness. Whereupon the band of Irish\r\nhero-patriots outside fled with electric speed, and returned no more.\r\nAt Ardagh the police found a haystack burning. They saved about ten\r\ntons, but Patrick Cremmin claims £88 from the county. He had offended\r\nsomebody, but he declares he knows not the motive. In other words, he\r\nwants to let the thing drop--bar the £88. Another stack of hay, partly\r\nsaved by the police, was burnt because evictions had taken place:\r\ndamage £20, which the county must pay. R. Plummer, a labourer with\r\nBrosna, whose case was given in my last, has received a letter\r\nthreatening him with death unless he left Brosna's employ. Some say\r\nthe name is Brosnan or Bresnahan. Beware of the quibbling of Irish\r\nmalcontents, who on the strength of a misprint or a wrongly-spelt\r\nname, boldly state that no such person ever existed, and that\r\ntherefore the case is a pure invention. Here is a specimen of the\r\ntoleration Loyalists and Protestants may expect:--A special train\r\nhaving been run from Newcastle to Limerick to enable people to attend\r\na Unionist meeting in the latter city, the Nationalists took steps to\r\nmark their sense of the railway company's indiscretion, and a train\r\nsoon afterwards leaving Newcastle for Tralee, they hurled a great\r\nstone from the Garryduff Bridge, smashing the window of the guard's\r\nvan and doing other injury. At Gurtnaclochy, to deter a witness in a\r\nlegal case, a threatening letter was sent, sixty yards of a sod fence\r\nthrown down, and a coffin and gun neatly cut on the field. On the\r\nRoman Catholic Chapel wall at Ashford a notice was posted threatening\r\nwith death anyone who bought hay or turnips from a boycotted man, and\r\nthe same day a man named Herlihy received a threatening letter. On\r\nApril 15 a party of armed, disguised men with blackened faces, called\r\non a poor man at Inniskeen, and having smashed the windows, tried to\r\nforce the door, but stopped to parley. They called on \"Young Patrick\"\r\nto hand out the father's gun, and the young man complied. Being\r\ntwitted with this he said, \"I want to live. If I had refused the gun\r\nmy life would not be worth twopence. I would be 'covered' from a bush\r\nor a fence when I walked out, or shot dead in the door as I looked\r\ndown the lane, as was done in another case. I know the parties well,\r\nbut I would not give evidence. Neither will I give the police any more\r\ninformation. It would not hurt the criminals, but it would hurt me.\r\nFor while the jury would not convict, the secret tribunal that sat on\r\nme would not be so merciful, and many a man would like the distinction\r\nof being singled out to execute the secret decrees of the Moonlight\r\nfraternity.\" Another person standing by said, \"What happened at\r\nGalbally, near Tipperary? A priest denounced a Protestant named Allen\r\nfrom the altar, and a week after the man was shot dead in his tracks.\r\nEverybody knew perfectly well who did the deed. All knew the man who\r\nwanted Allen's land, and it was thought that there was evidence enough\r\nto hang him twenty times. He is alive and well, and if you go any\r\nSaturday to the Tipperary market Father Humphreys will introduce you\r\nto him. He was discharged without a stain on his character, and brass\r\nbands met him on his return, also a torchlight procession.\"\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, even more than in England, brass bands are necessary to\r\nthe expression of the popular emotion. Brass bands met Egan, the\r\nliberated, everywhere. Brass bands accompanied the march of O'Brien's\r\nmourners at the Cork funeral last week. Not a murderer in Ireland\r\nwhose release would not be celebrated with blare of brass bands, and\r\nglare of burning grease. Mr. Morley could not land in Cork, however\r\nprivately, for he did not wish to speak, without a brass band being\r\nloosed on his heels. The great philosophical Radical, the encyclopædia\r\nof political wisdom, the benefactor, the saviour, the regenerator of\r\nIreland, left Cork to the strains of the Butter Exchange Band--_con\r\namore_, _affetuoso_, and doubtless _con spirito_. Yet some will say\r\nthat the Irish are not grateful! Mr. Morley stayed at the hotel I had\r\njust left, the Royal Victoria, which I justly described as a hot-bed\r\nof sedition. It was here, in room No. 72, that Dalton so terribly\r\npunched the long-suffering head of Tim Healy. At the Four Courts,\r\nDublin, I saw a waiter who witnessed the famous horsewhipping in that\r\ncity. I asked him if it were a severe affair, or whether, as the\r\nNationalist papers affirmed, only a formality, a sort of\r\nConsider-yourself-flogged. How that waiter expanded and enjoyed the\r\nPleasures of Memory! \"It was a most thrimindious affair, Sorr.\r\nMcDermott was a fine, powerful sthrip of a boy, an' handled the\r\nhorsewhip iligant. Ye could hear the whack, whack, whack in the\r\nrefreshment room wid the doors closed, twenty yards away. It was for\r\nall the world a fine, big, healthy kind of batin' that Tim got. An'\r\nthe way he wriggled was the curiousest thing at all. 'Twas enough to\r\nmake yer jump out of yer skin wid just burstin' with laffin'.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving outrages and violence to Messrs. Morley and Moriarty, let me\r\nnarrate the effect of the impending Home Rule Bill on some of the\r\ncommercial community. A well-known tradesman says: \"A man in\r\nNewcastlewest owed me £24 for goods delivered. He had a flourishing\r\nshop and also an excellent farm. He was so slow in paying, and\r\napparently so certain that in a little while he would escape\r\naltogether, that I sued him for the amount. It was a common action for\r\na common debt, between one Irish tradesman and another. But I am a\r\nUnionist, and therefore fair game. I got judgment, but no instalments\r\nwere paid. I remonstrated over and over again, and was from time to\r\ntime met with solemn promises, the debtor gaining time by every delay.\r\nAt last I lost patience, and determined to distrain. Everybody laughed\r\nat me. 'Where will you get an auctioneer, and who will bid? they\r\nasked. I determined to carry through this one case, if it cost a\r\nhundred pounds. I got a good revolver, and succeeded in bringing an\r\nauctioneer from a distance. The debtor said he would brain me with a\r\nbill-hook if I put my foot on his ground, and another man promised to\r\nshoot me from a bed-room window. It was necessary, to carry out the\r\nsale at all, to have police protection. I went to the barracks and\r\nsubmitted the case. Had I a sheriff's order, &c., &c., &c.? All\r\ndifficulties overcome I went to the 'sale.' We seized a cow, a watch,\r\nand some of my own goods, and commenced the auction. Nobody bid but\r\nmyself, and when I had covered the amount due the sale ceased, the\r\naspect of the people being very menacing. Remember, this was not\r\nagrarian at all. The debt was for goods delivered to be sold in the\r\nway of trade. Most of them were there before my face. The debtor came\r\nand said, 'You can't take the things away. But we like your pluck, and\r\nif you will settle the matter for £5 I will give you the money.' I\r\ndeclined to take £5 for £24 and costs, although the police looked on\r\nthe offer as unexpectedly liberal, and the bystanders shed tears of\r\nemotion and said that Gallagher was 'iver an' always the dacent boy.'\r\nWhen I wished to remove the things the troubles began. I had my\r\nrevolver, the police their rifles, but things looked very blue. I\r\ndrove the cow to the station and got her away, but the other things\r\ncould not walk aboard, and how to get them there was hard to know. I\r\nasked people I knew to lend me their carts--people who were under some\r\nobligation to me, men I had known and done business with for years.\r\nThey all refused; they feared the evil eye of the vigilance committee\r\nof a Fenian organisation still in full swing among us, and keeping\r\nregular books for settlement when they have the power. I was\r\ndetermined not to be beat, so I went to Limerick, nearly thirty miles\r\naway, to get a float or wagon. The news was there before me, not a\r\nwheel to be had in the city. At last, by means of powerful influence,\r\nI got a cart, on condition that the owner's name should be taken off,\r\nand my name painted on. Then I returned to Newcastle and bore away the\r\ngoods in triumph. Alas! my troubles were only beginning! I had been\r\ntold that the goods were not the debtor's, but belonged to someone\r\nelse. The cow, they said, was a neighbour's, who had 'lent' it to my\r\ndebtor. The watch, they said, was the property of a friend, who had\r\nhanded it to my debtor that he might take it somewhere to be repaired.\r\nThe landlord of the house claimed that he had previously seized\r\neverything, but had allowed things to remain out of kindness. I was\r\ncited in four actions for illegal distraint, all of which were so\r\nevidently trumped-up that they were quashed. But the time they took!\r\nAnd the annoyance they caused. The expense also was considerable, and\r\nthe idea of getting expenses out of these people--but I need add\r\nnothing on that score.\r\n\r\n\"There were six witnesses in one case, and they could never be found,\r\nso long as the judge could have patience to wait. Every lie, trick,\r\nsubterfuge you can imagine, was practised on poor me. At last all was\r\nover, but at what a cost! The big chap who had threatened me with the\r\nbill-hook came humbly forward and said: \"Plase yer honner's worship,\r\nI'm very deaf, an' I'm short sighted, and I'm very wake intirely, an'\r\nye must give me toime to insinse meself into the way of it.\" And that\r\nrascal had everything repeated several times, until I was on fifty\r\noccasions on the point of chucking up the whole thing.\r\n\r\n\"Before the Home Rule Bill had implanted dishonest ideas in his head,\r\nbefore the promises of unscrupulous agitators had unsettled and\r\ndemoralised the people, that man was a straightforward, good, paying\r\nfellow. Only he thought that by waiting till the bill was passed he\r\nwould have nothing to pay. The ignorant among us harbour that idea,\r\nand the disloyalty of the lower classes is so intense that you could\r\nnot understand it unless you lived here at least two years.\"\r\n\r\nEnglish friends who praise the affection of the Irish people, and who\r\nspeak of the Union of Hearts, may note the lectures of the popular\r\nMiss Gonne, who is being enthusiastically welcomed in Nationalist\r\nIreland. No doubt the local papers expurgated the text; at the present\r\nmoment the word has gone round:--\"Let us get the bill, let us get the\r\nbill, and then!\" But enough remains to show the general tone.\r\nAddressing the Irish National Literary Society, of Loughrea, Miss\r\nGonne said that she must \"contradict Lord Wolseley in his statement\r\nthat England was never insulted by invasion since the days of William\r\nthe Conqueror. It would be deeply interesting to the men and women of\r\nConnaught to hear once again how a gallant body of French troops,\r\nfighting in the name of Liberty and Ireland, had conquered nearly the\r\nwhole of that province at a time when England had in her service in\r\nIreland no less than one hundred and fifty thousand trained troops.\r\nShe would remind them that France was the one great military nation of\r\nEurope that had been the friend of Ireland\"--a remark which was\r\nreceived with loud and prolonged applause. \"And it would be a matter\r\nof some pride to us to reflect that in these military relations the\r\nrecord of the Irish brigades in the service of France compared not\r\nwithout advantage with the military services which France had been\r\nable to render to Ireland.\" This passage clearly refers to the aid the\r\ntwo countries have afforded each other as against England, and the\r\nwhole lecture seems to have aimed at the heaping of ignominy on the\r\nBritish name. The stronger the denunciation of England, the more\r\npopular the speaker. The Union of Hearts gets \"no show\" at all. The\r\nphrase is unknown to Irish Nationalists. However deceitful they may\r\nbe, it cannot yet be said that they have sunk thus low.\r\n\r\nLooking over Wednesday's _Cork Examiner_, I observe that amid other\r\nthings the Reverend John O'Mahony attributes the fact that \"The\r\nteeming treasures of the deep were almost left untouched,\" that is,\r\noff the Irish coast, and that this is \"a disgrace and a dishonour to\r\nthe people through whose misrule and misgovernment the unhappy result\r\nwas brought about.\" Father O'Mahony is a Corker, and should know that\r\nhe is talking nonsense. Let me explain.\r\n\r\nIn Cork I met a gentleman for twenty-five years engaged in supplying\r\nfishermen with all their needs. He said, \"The Irish fishermen are the\r\nlaziest, most provoking beggars under the sun.\" He showed me two sizes\r\nof net-mesh and said, \"This is the size of a shilling, this is the\r\nsize of a halfpenny. The Scotsmen and Shetlanders use the shilling\r\nsize. The difference seems small, but it is very important. The\r\nIrishmen use the halfpenny size, and will use no other. They say that\r\nwhat was good enough for their fathers is good enough for them. When\r\nthe fish are netted they make a rush, and many of them escape the\r\nlarger mesh, which they can get through, unless of the largest size.\r\nThe small mesh catches them by the gills and hangs them. This,\r\nhowever, is a small matter. The most important thing is the depth of\r\nfishing. The Scotsmen and Shetlanders come up to the Irish coast,\r\nwhich is remarkably rich in fish, and when they meet a school of fish\r\nthey fish very deep and bring them up by tons, while the Irishmen are\r\nskimming the tops of the shoals, and drawing up trumpery dozens,\r\nbecause their fathers did so. Years ago I used to argue the point, but\r\nI know better now. When the water is troubled, when the wind is\r\nblowing, and things are a trifle rough, then is the time to fish. The\r\nherrings cannot see the net when the water is agitated. The Scotsmen\r\nare on the job, full of spirits and go, but Paddy gets up and takes a\r\nlook and goes to bed again. He waits for fine weather, so as to give\r\nthe fish a chance. The poor Shetlanders come over long leagues of sea,\r\ncatch ling a yard long, under Paddy's nose, take it to Shetland, cure\r\nit, and bring it back to him, that he may buy it at twopence a pound.\r\nAt the mouth of the Blackwater are the finest soles in the world, but\r\nthe Irish are too lazy to catch them;--great thick beggars of fish\r\nfour inches thick, you never saw such soles, the Dover soles are lice\r\nto them, they'd fetch a pound apiece in London if they were known.\r\nChange the subject. Every time I come round here I get into a rage.\r\nThe British Government finds these men boats. The Shetlanders\r\nsometimes land, and when they contrast the fat pastures and teeming\r\nsouth coast of Ireland with their own cold seas and stony hills they\r\nsay with the Ulstermen, 'Would that you would change countries!'\"\r\n\r\nI asked him how he accounted for this extraordinary state of things.\r\nHe said:--\r\n\r\n\"As an Irishman I am bound to answer one question by asking another.\r\nWas there ever a free and prosperous country where the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion was predominant?\"\r\n\r\nI could not answer him at the moment, but perhaps Father O'Mahony, who\r\nknows so much, may satisfy him on the point. Or in the absence of this\r\neloquent kisser of the Blarney Stone some other black-coated Corker\r\nmay respond. Goodness knows, they are numerous enough. All are well\r\nclothed and well fed, while the flock that feed the pastor are mostly\r\nin squalid poverty, actually bending the knee to their greasy\r\ntask-masters, poor ignorant victims of circumstances.\r\n\r\nAmong the many nostrums offered to Ireland, nobody offers soap. The\r\ngreatest inventions are often the simplest, and with all humility I\r\nmake the suggestion. Ireland is badly off for soap, and cleanliness is\r\nnext to godliness. Father Humphreys, of Tipperary, boasts of his\r\ninfluence with the poor--delights to prove how in the matter of rent\r\nthey took his advice, and so on. Suppose he asks them to wash\r\nthemselves! The suggestion may at first sight appear startling. All\r\nnovelties are alarming at first; but the mortality, except among old\r\npeople, would probably prove less than Father Humphreys might expect.\r\nHe would have some difficulty in recognising his flock, but the\r\nresources of civilisation would probably be sufficient to conquer this\r\ndrawback. Persons over forty might be exempted, as nothing less than\r\nskinning would meet their case, but the young might possibly be\r\ntrained, against tradition and heredity, to the regular use of water.\r\nBut I fear the good Father will hardly strain his authority so far. An\r\nedict to wash would mean blue ructions in Tipperary, open rebellion\r\nwould ensue, and the mighty Catholic Church would totter to its fall.\r\nThe threat to wash would be an untold terrorism, the use of soap an\r\noutrage which could only be atoned by blood. And Father Humphreys (if\r\nhe knew the words) might truly say _Cui bono_? Why wash? Is not soap\r\nan enemy to the faith? Do not the people suit our purpose much better\r\nas they are? _Thigum thu_, brutal and heretic Saxon?\r\n\r\nKillaloe (Co. Clare), April 27th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 15.--THE PERIL TO ENGLISH TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the great object of public interest in the city of Limerick is the\r\nTreaty Stone, a huge block of granite, raised on a pedestal on the\r\nClare side of Thomond Bridge, to commemorate the Violated Treaty so\r\ngraphically described by Macaulay, and to keep in remembrance of the\r\npeople the alleged ancient atrocities of the brutal Saxon--so the\r\nkey-note of Ennis is the memorial to the Manchester Martyrs, erected\r\noutside the town to commemorate the people who erected it. That is how\r\nit strikes the average observer. For while the patriotic murderers of\r\nthe Manchester policemen, to wit, O'Brien, Allen, and Larkin, have\r\nonly one tablet to the three heroes, the members of the committee who\r\nwere responsible for this Nationalist or rather Fenian monument have\r\nimmortalised themselves on three tablets. But although party feeling\r\nruns high, and the town as a whole appears to be eminently disloyal\r\nand inimical to England, there are not wanting reasonable people who\r\nlook on the proposed change with grave suspicion, even though they\r\nnominally profess to support the abstract doctrine of Home Rule.\r\nNaturally, their main opinions are very like those I have previously\r\nrecorded as being prevalent in the neighbouring counties of Limerick,\r\nCork, and Kerry. They believe the present time unseasonable, and they\r\nhave no confidence in the present representatives of the Nationalist\r\nparty. They believe that the Irish people are not yet sufficiently\r\neducated to be at all capable of self-government, and they fail to see\r\nwhat substantial advantages would accrue from any Home Rule Bill. More\r\nespecially do they distrust Mr. Gladstone; and although in England the\r\nNationalist leaders speak gratefully of the Grand Old Man, it is\r\nprobable that such references would in Ireland be received in silence,\r\nif not with outspoken derision. A well-known Nationalist thus\r\nexpressed himself on this point:--\r\n\r\n\"Gladstone's recent attack on Parnell was one of the meanest acts of a\r\nnaturally mean and cowardly man, whose whole biography is a continuous\r\nstory of surrender, abject and unconditional. Parnell was his master.\r\nWith all his faults, Parnell was much the better man. He was too cool\r\na swordsman for Gladstone, and, spite of the Grand Man's tricky\r\ndodging and shifting, Parnell beat him at every point, until he was\r\nthoroughly cowed and had to give in. What surprises me is that the\r\nEnglish people are led away by a mere talker. They claim to be the\r\nmost straightforward and practical people in the world. Answer me\r\nthis:--Did you, did anybody, ever know Gladstone to give a\r\nstraightforward answer to any one question? Straight dealing is not in\r\nhim. He is slippery as an eel--with all his 'honesty,' his piety, his\r\nbenevolence. But as he reads the Bible in Hawarden Church, the English\r\nbelieve in him. They have no other reason that I can see. Have you\r\nheard any Irishman speak well of Gladstone? No, and you never will.\r\nHow long in the country? Five weeks only? You may stay five years, and\r\nyou will not hear a word expressing sincere esteem. About separation?\r\nWell, most of the unthinking people, that is, the great majority,\r\nwould vote in favour of it to-morrow. All sentiment, the very romance\r\nof sentimentality. I have been in England, I have been in America, and\r\nyou could hardly believe the difference in the people's views. The\r\nIrish are not practical enough. 'Ireland a nation' is bound to be the\r\nnext cry, if Home Rule become law under the present leaders of the\r\nNationalist party.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about the pledges, the solemn and reiterated pledges, of\r\nMichael Davitt and the rest?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you ask me seriously? You do? An Irishman would regard the\r\nquestion as a joke. The pledges are not worth a straw. Their object is\r\nto deceive, and so to carry the point at issue. Would John Bull come\r\nwith an injured air and say, with tears in his voice, 'You said you'd\r\nbe good. You promised to be loyal. You really did. Did you not, now?'\r\nDon't you think John would cut a pretty figure? Davitt knows where to\r\nhave him. He knows that a quiet, moderate, reasonable tone fetches\r\nhim. Parnell, too, knew that the method with John was a steady, quiet\r\npersistence without excitement. John listens to Davitt, and says to\r\nhimself, 'Now this is a calm, steady fellow. Nothing fly-away about\r\n_him_. No shouting and screaming there. This is the kind of man who\r\n_must_ boss the show. Give him what he wants.'\r\n\r\n\"Look how Morley was taken in. And so, no doubt, was many another.\r\n\r\n\"If England trusts the assurances of these men, and if the bill under\r\npresent conditions becomes law, we shall have two generations of\r\nexperiment, of corruption, of turmoil, of jobbery such as the British\r\nEmpire has never seen.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am a Home Ruler--at the proper time. But Home Rule in our\r\npresent circumstances would mean revolution, and, a hundred to one,\r\nthe reconquest of Ireland. And in the event of any foreign\r\ncomplication you would have all your work cut out to effect your\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\nA gentleman from Mallow said, \"The Gaelic clubs all over the country\r\nare in a high state of organisation, and a perfect state of drill. The\r\nsplendid force of constabulary which are now for you would be against\r\nyou. The Irish Legislature, from the first, would have the power to\r\nraise a force of Volunteers, and the Irish are such a military nation\r\nthat in six months they could muster a very formidable force. I am a\r\nUnionist, a Protestant too, but I find that my Catholic and Home Rule\r\nfriends, that is, the superior sort, the best-read, the most thinking\r\nmen, agree with me perfectly. But while I can understand Irish Home\r\nRulers, even the most extreme sort, I cannot understand any sensible\r\nEnglishman entertaining such an insane idea. As manager of one of the\r\nlargest concerns in Cork I have made many visits to England, and I\r\nfound the supporters of Mr. Gladstone so utterly misinformed, so\r\ncredulous, so blankly ignorant of the matter, that I forbore to debate\r\nthe thing at all. And their assumption was on a level with their\r\nignorance, which is saying a good deal.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Manley, the great horse dealer, a famous character\r\nthroughout the three kingdoms, said to me, \"The Limerick horse fair of\r\nThursday last was the worst I ever attended in forty years. There is\r\nno money in the country. The little that changed hands was for horses\r\nof a common sort, and every one, I do believe, was bought for England\r\nand Scotland, tramcar-horses and such like. Home Rule is killing the\r\ncountry already. I farmed a thousand acres of land in Ireland for many\r\na long year, and since I went more fully into the horse-dealing\r\nbusiness I kept two hundred and fifty acres going. I have horsed the\r\nsix crack cavalry regiments of the British army, and I know every nook\r\nand corner of Ireland; know, perhaps, every farmer who can breed and\r\nrear a horse, and I also know their opinions. Give me the power and I\r\nwould do four things. Here they are:--\r\n\r\n\"I would first settle the land question, then reform the poor-laws,\r\nthen rearrange the Grand Jury laws, then commence to reclaim the land,\r\nwhich would pay ten per cent.\r\n\r\n\"The Tories should undertake these measures. They would then knock the\r\nbottom out of the Home Rule agitation. The people are downright sick\r\nof the whole business. They expected to be well off before this. They\r\nfind themselves going down the nick.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Abraham P. Keeley said: \"There is much fault found with the\r\nlandlords, but they are by no means so much to blame as is supposed.\r\nPut the saddle on the right horse. And the right horse is the steam\r\nhorse. The rapid transit of grain and general farm produce has lowered\r\nthe value of land more rapidly than the landlords could lower the\r\nrent. Every year the prairie lands of America are further opened up by\r\nrailways; India and Egypt and Australia are now in the swim, and\r\nIreland, as a purely agricultural country, must suffer. A curious\r\nillustration of the purely rural condition of the country was\r\nmentioned the other day. Nearly all the great towns drink the water of\r\nthe rivers upon which they stand. Cork drinks the Lee; Limerick drinks\r\nthe Shannon; you can catch trout from the busiest quay in Limerick.\r\nNow, the towns of England don't drink their own rivers. You don't\r\ndrink the Rea at Birmingham, I think?\"\r\n\r\nI was obliged to admit that the pellucid waters of the crystal Rea\r\nwere not the favourite table beverage of the citizens of Brum, but\r\nsubmitted that Mr. Joseph Malins, the Grand Worthy Chief Templar, and\r\nhis great and influential following might possibly use this innocent\r\nmeans of dissipation.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Manley continued: \"The tenant farmer has cried himself up,\r\nand the Nationalists have cried him up as the finest, most\r\nindustrious, most honest, most frugal, most self-sacrificing fellow\r\nin the world. But he isn't. Not a bit of it. The landlords and their\r\nagents have over and over again been shot for rack-renting when the\r\nrents had been forced up by secret competitions among neighbours and\r\neven relations.\r\n\r\n\"Ask any living Irish farmer if I am right, and he will say, Yes, ten\r\ntimes yes.\r\n\r\n\"The Irishman has a land-hunger such as is unknown over the water. And\r\nwhy? Because the land is his sole means of living. We have no\r\nenterprise, no manufactures to speak of. The Celtic nature is to\r\nhoard. The Englishman invests what the Irishman would bury in his back\r\ngarden, or hang up the chimney in an old stocking. So we have no big\r\nworks all over the country to employ the people. And as we are very\r\nprolific, the only remedy is emigration. Down at Queenstown the other\r\nday I saw 250 Irish emigrants leaving the country. A Nationalist\r\nfriend said, 'If they'd only wait a bit till we get Home Rule, they\r\nneedn't go, the crathurs.' What's to hinder it? How will they be\r\nbetter off? Will the land sustain more with Home Rule than without it?\r\nAnd when capital is driven away, as it must and will be the moment we\r\npass the bill, instead of more factories we'll have less, and England\r\nand Scotland will be over-run with thousands of starving Irish folks\r\nwhose means of living is taken away.\r\n\r\n\"As an Irish farmer, and an Irish farmer's son, living on Irish farms\r\nfor more than sixty years, having an intimate acquaintance with the\r\nwhole of Ireland, and almost every acre of England, I deliberately say\r\nthat the Irish farmer is much better off than the English, Scotch, or\r\nWelsh farmer, not only in the matter of law, but in the matter of\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n\"In many parts of England the soil must be manured after every crop.\r\nEvery time you take out you must put in. Not so in Ireland. Nature has\r\nbeen so bountiful to us that we can take three, and even six, crops\r\noff the land after a single dose of manure. Of course the farmer\r\ngrumbles, and no wonder. The price of stock and general produce is so\r\ndepressed that Irish farmers are pinched. But so they are in England.\r\nAnd yet you have no moonlighting. You don't shoot your landlords. If\r\nthe land will not pay you give it up and take to something else. An\r\nIrishman goes on holding, simply refusing to pay rent. His neighbours,\r\nwho are in the same fix, support him. When the landlord wishes to\r\ndistrain, after waiting seven years or so, he has to get a decree. The\r\ntenants know of it as soon as he, and they set sentinels. When the\r\npolice are signalled the cattle are driven away and mixed with those\r\nof other farmers--every difficulty that Irish cleverness can invent is\r\nplaced in the way. Then the landlord, whether or not successful in\r\ndistraining, is boycotted, and the people reckon it a virtue to shoot\r\nhim down on sight. Conviction is almost, if not quite, impossible, for\r\neven if you found a willing witness--a very unlikely thing I can tell\r\nyou--even then the witness knows himself marked for the same fate. If\r\nhe went to America or Australia he would be traced, and someone would\r\nbe found to settle him. Such things have happened over and over again,\r\nand people know the risk is great. But about rack-rents.\r\n\r\n\"I have told you of Irish avariciousness in the matter of land, and\r\nhave explained the reason of it. Rents have been forced up by people\r\ngoing behind each other's backs and offering more and more, in their\r\neagerness to acquire the holding outbidding each other. Landlords are\r\nhuman; agents, if possible, still more human. They handed over the\r\nland to the highest bidder. What more natural? The farmers are not\r\nbusiness men. They offered more than the land could pay. You know the\r\nresults. But why curse and blaspheme the landlords for what was in\r\nmany cases their own deliberate act?\"\r\n\r\nOn Friday last I had a small object-lesson in Irish affairs. Colonel\r\nO'Callaghan, of Bodyke, went to Limerick to buy cattle for grazing on\r\nhis estate. The cattle were duly bought, but the gallant Colonel had\r\nto drive them through the city with his own right hand. I saw his\r\nmartial form looming in the rear of a skittish column of cows, and\r\neven as the vulture scenteth the carcase afar off, even so, scenting\r\ninteresting matter, did I swoop down on the unhappy Colonel, startling\r\nhim severely with my sudden dash. He said, \"I'm driving cows now,\"\r\nand, truth to tell, there was no denying it. Even as he spoke, a\r\nperverse beast of Nationalist tendencies effected a diversion to the\r\nright, plainly intending a charge down Denmark Street, _en route_ for\r\nIrish Town, and the gallant Colonel waiving ceremony and a formidable\r\nshillelagh, hastened by a flank movement to cut off this retreat, and\r\nto guide the erring creature in the right way to fresh woods and\r\npastures new. I fired a Parthian arrow after the parting pair.\r\n\"Appointment?\" I shouted, but the Colonel shook his head. It was no\r\ntime for gentle assignations. The cursed crew in front of him absorbed\r\nhis faculties, and then he half expected to be shot from any street\r\nabutting on his path. Perhaps I may nail him yet. He has been\r\nattempting to distrain. If the Colonel refuses to speak I will\r\ninterview his tenants. I have said I will pursue, I will overtake, I\r\nwill divide the spoil--with the readers of the _Gazette_. _Dixi._ I have\r\nspoken! There is much shooting on the Bodyke estates, and in Ennis\r\nthey say that sixty policemen are stationed there to pick up the game.\r\nNobody has been bagged as yet, but the Clare folks are still hoping.\r\nTo-morrow a trusty steed will bear me to the spot. Relying on a\r\ncarefully-considered, carefully-studied Nationalist appearance, an\r\nanti-landlord look, and a decided No-Rent expression in my left eye, I\r\nfeel that I could ride through the most dangerous districts with\r\nperfect impunity. \"Base is the slave that pays,\" says Ancient Pistol.\r\nThat is my present motto. One touch of No Rent makes the Irish kin.\r\n\r\nThe English people should be told that nearly all Irishmen, whether\r\nUnionist or otherwise, are strong Protectionists. The moment Home Rule\r\nbecomes law a tremendous attempt will be made to shut out English\r\ngoods. \"The very first thing we do,\" said to me an influential\r\nDubliner I met here, \"is to double the harbour dues; you can't prevent\r\nthat, I suppose? The first good result will be the choking-off of all\r\nthe Scotch and Manx fishermen who infest our seas. At present they\r\nbring their fish into Dublin, whence it is sent all over Ireland,\r\ncompeting against Irish fishermen. Then we'll tax all manufactured\r\ngoods. We will admit the raw material duty-free, but we must be\r\npermitted to know what suits us best, and we must, and will, tax\r\nflour, but not wheat. We in Ireland, forsooth, must submit to having\r\nall our flour mills closed to suit the swarming populations of\r\nManchester and Birmingham. They must have a cheap loaf. Dear me! and\r\nso flour comes here untaxed, having given employment to people in\r\nAmerica, while our folks are walking about idle. Go down the river\r\nBoyne, from Trim to Drogheda. What do you see? Twelve mills, with\r\nmachinery worth £100,000 or more, lying idle. One of those mills once\r\nemployed fifty or sixty men. Now it employs none. Tax flour, I say,\r\nand so says everybody. We must have Protection, and very stringent\r\nProtection. Irish manufacturers must be sustained against English\r\ncompetition. Twenty years ago Dublin was a great place for cabinet\r\nwork. Now nothing is done there, or next to nothing. Everything must\r\ncome from London. At the same period we did a great trade in leather.\r\nThe leather trade is gone to the devil. We did a big turnover in boots\r\nand shoes. Now every pair worn in the city comes from Northampton.\r\nIreland and Irish goods for the Irish, and burn everything English but\r\nEnglish coals. Give us Home Rule, and all these trades will be\r\nrestored to us.\"\r\n\r\nThus spoke the great Home Ruler, who declined to permit his name to\r\nappear, as he said it might affect his business. His sentiments are\r\nuniversal, and, as I have said, his opinions are shared by the great\r\nmajority of Irishmen, even though professedly Unionist.\r\n\r\nA word of comment on the patriotic sentiments of my friend. I went to\r\nDelany, of George Street, Limerick, for a suit of Blarney tweed. He\r\nhad not a yard in the place. He was indicated as the leading clothier\r\nand outfitter of the city, but the Mahony Mills were not represented\r\namongst his patterns. He had Scotch tweeds, Yorkshire tweeds, West of\r\nEngland tweeds, but although the Blarney tweeds are said to be the\r\nbest in the world as well as the handsomest, I had to seek them\r\nelsewhere. An English friend says, \"The Irish politicians are rather\r\ninconsistent. They came into this hotel one evening, six of them,\r\nred-hot from a Nationalist meeting, cursing England up hill and down\r\ndale, till I really felt quite nervous. I hadn't got a Winchester like\r\nthat. (I hope it won't go off.) They agreed that to boycott English\r\ngoods was the correct thing, and of course they were for burning all\r\nbut English coals, when the leader of the gang said, 'Now, boys, what\r\nwill you drink,' and hang me! if they didn't every one take a bottle\r\nof Bass's bitter beer! Did you ever know such inconsistency?\"\r\n\r\nThe quirks and quips of the Irish character would puzzle a\r\nPhiladelphia lawyer. Spinning along the lane to Killaloe, with Mr.\r\nBeesley, of Leeds, and Mr. Abraham Keeley, of Mallow, balanced on\r\nopposite sides of a jaunting car, we came on a semi-savage specimen of\r\nthe genuine Irish sort. Semi-savage! he was seven-eighths savage, and\r\nsemi-lunatic, just clever enough to mind the cows and goats which,\r\nwith a donkey or two, grazed by the way-side. He might be\r\nfive-and-twenty, and looked strong and lusty. His naked feet were\r\nblack with the dirt of his childhood, and not only black, but shining\r\nand gleaming in the sun. His tattered trousers were completely worn\r\naway to the knee, showing his muscular legs to perfection. The rags\r\nthat clothed his body were confusing and indefinite. You could not\r\ntell where one garment ended and another began, or whether there were\r\nmore than one at all. Cover a pump with boiling glue, shake over it a\r\nsack of rags, and you will get an approximate effect of his costume.\r\nHis tawny, matted hair and beard had never known brush, comb, or\r\nsteel. It was a virgin forest. He scratched his head with the air of\r\nthe old woman who said \"Forty years long have this generation troubled\r\nme;\" and ran after the car with outstretched hand. I threw him a\r\npenny, upon which he threw himself at full length, his tongue hanging\r\nout, a greedy sparkle in his eye. My Irish friend instantly stopped\r\nthe car.\r\n\r\n\"Now I'll show you something. This man is more than half an idiot, but\r\nwatch him.\" Then he cried:\r\n\r\n\"Come here, now, I'll toss you for the penny.\"\r\n\r\nThe man came quickly forward.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, put down your penny, and call. What is it? Head or harp,\r\nspeak while it spins!\"\r\n\r\n\"Head,\" shouted the savage, and head it was.\r\n\r\nHe picked up the second penny with glee, and said with a burst of wild\r\nlaughter. \"Toss more, more, more; toss ever an' always; toss agin,\r\nagin, agin.\"\r\n\r\nThe car-driver was disgusted. \"Bad luck to ye for a madman. Ye have\r\nthe gamblin' blood in ye. Bedad, ye'd break Monty Carly, ye would.\"\r\n\r\nThen looking at the gambler's black and polished feet, he said:--\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, now, honey, is it Day an' Martin's ye use?\"\r\n\r\nEnnis (Co. Clare), April 29th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 16.--CIVIL WAR IN COUNTY CLARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Bodyke is famous throughout all lands, but few people know\r\nanything about the place or the particulars of the great dispute. The\r\nwhole district is at present in a state of complete lawlessness. The\r\ncondition of matters is almost incredible, and is such as might\r\npossibly be expected in the heart of Africa, but hardly in a civilised\r\ncountry, especially when that country is under the benignant British\r\nrule. The law-breakers seem to have the upper hand, and to be almost,\r\nif not quite, masters of the situation. The whole estate is divided\r\ninto three properties, Fort Ann, Milltown, and Bodyke, about five\r\nthousand acres in all, of which the first two comprise about one\r\nthousand five hundred acres, isolated from the Bodyke lands, which\r\nlatter may amount to some three thousand five hundred acres. Either by\r\nreason of their superior honesty, or, as is sometimes suggested, on\r\naccount of their inferior strategic position, the tenants of the Fort\r\nAnn and Milltown lands pay their rent. The men of Bodyke are in a\r\nstate of open rebellion, and resist every process of law both by\r\nevasion and open force. The hill-tops are manned by sentries armed\r\nwith rifles. Bivouac fires blaze nightly on every commanding eminence.\r\nColonel O'Callaghan's agent is a cock-shot from every convenient\r\nmound. His rides are made musical by the 'ping' of rifle balls, and\r\nnothing but the dread of his repeating rifle, with which he is known\r\nto be handy, prevents the marksmen from coming to close quarters. Mr.\r\nStannard MacAdam seems to bear a charmed life. He is a fine athletic\r\nyoung man, calm and collected, modest and unassuming, and, as he\r\ndeclares, no talker. He has been described as a man of deeds, not\r\nwords. He said, \"I am not a literary man. I have not the skill to\r\ndescribe incident, or to give a clear and detailed account of what has\r\ntaken place. I have refused to give information to the local\r\njournalists. My business is to manage the estate, and that takes me\r\nall my time. You must get particulars elsewhere. I would rather not\r\nspeak of my own affairs or those of Colonel O'Callaghan.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it but to turn my unwilling back on this\r\nveritable gold mine. But although Mr. MacAdam could not or would not\r\nspeak, others were not so reticent, and once in the neighbourhood the\r\nstate of things was made plainly evident. The road from Ennis to\r\nBodyke is dull and dreary, and abounds with painful memories.\r\nHalf-an-hour out you reach the house, or what remains of it, of\r\nFrancis Hynes, who was hanged for shooting a man. A little further and\r\nyou reach the place where Mr. Perry was shot. A wooded spot,\r\n\"convaynient\" for ambush, once screened some would-be murderers who\r\nmissed their mark. Then comes the house of the Misses Brown, in which\r\non Christmas Eve shots were fired, by way of celebrating the festive\r\nseason. From a clump of trees some four hundred yards from the road\r\nthe police on a car were fired upon, the horse being shot dead in his\r\ntracks. The tenantry of this sweet district are keeping up their rifle\r\npractice, and competent judges say that the Bodyke men possess not\r\nless than fifty rifles, none of which can be found by the police. Said\r\none of the constabulary, \"They lack nerve to fire from shorter\r\ndistances, as they think MacAdam is the better shot, and to miss him\r\nwould be risky, as he is known to shoot rabbits with ball cartridge.\r\nAt the same time, I remember Burke of Loughrea, who was shot, had\r\nalso a fine reputation as a rifleman, but they settled him neatly\r\nenough. I saw him in the Railway Inn, Athenry, just before he was\r\nkilled, with a repeating rifle slung on his back and a revolver on his\r\nhip. I saw him ride away, his servant driving while Burke kept the\r\ncocked rifle ready, the butt under his armpit, the trigger in his\r\nhand. He sat with his back to the horse, keeping a good look-out, and\r\nyet they shot both him and his servant as they galloped along. The\r\nhorse and car came in without them. To carry arms is therefore not a\r\ncomplete security, though no doubt it is, to some extent, a deterrent.\r\nBut my opinion is that when a man is ordered to be shot he will be\r\nshot. Clare swarms with secret societies, and you never know from one\r\nmoment to another what resolutions they will pass. I don't know what\r\nthe end of it will be, but I should think that Home Rule, by giving\r\nthe murderers a fancied security, would in this district lead to\r\nwholesale bloodshed. The whole country would rise, as they do now, to\r\nmeet the landlord or his agent, but they would then do murder without\r\nthe smallest hesitation.\"\r\n\r\nHis companion said--the police here are never alone--\"The first thing\r\nMorley did was to rescind the Crimes Act. When we heard of that we\r\nsaid 'Now it's coming.' And we've got it. Every man with a head on\r\nhim, and not a turnip, knew very well what would happen. The police\r\nare shot at till they take no notice of it. Sometimes we charge up the\r\nhills to the spot where the firing started, but among the rocks and\r\nravines and hills and holes they run like rabbits, or they hand their\r\narms to some fleet-footed chap to hide, while they stay--aye, they do,\r\nthey actually stand their ground till we come, and there they are\r\nworking at a hedge or digging the ground, and looking as innocent and\r\nstupid as possible. They never saw anybody, and never heard any\r\nfiring--or they thought it was the Colonel shooting a hare. We hardly\r\nknow what to do in doubtful cases, as we know the tenants have the\r\nsupport of the Government, and it is as much as our places are worth\r\nto make any mistake under present circumstances. The tenants know that\r\ntoo, so between them and Morley we feel between two fires.\"\r\n\r\nThe trouble has been alive for fifteen years or so, but it was not\r\nuntil 1887 that Bodyke became a regularly historic place. The tenants\r\nhad paid no rent for years, and wholesale evictions were tried, but\r\nwithout effect. The people walked in again the next day, and as the\r\ngallant Colonel had not an army division at his back he was obliged to\r\nconfess himself beaten at every point. He went in for arbitration, but\r\nbefore giving details let us first take a bird's eye view of his\r\nposition. I will endeavour to state the case as fairly as possible,\r\npremising that nothing will be given beyond what is freely admitted by\r\nboth parties to the dispute.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel, who is a powerfully-built, bronzed, and active man,\r\nseemingly over sixty years old, left the service just forty years ago.\r\nFour years before that his father had died, heavily in debt, leaving\r\nthe estate encumbered by a mortgage, a jointure to the relict, Mrs.\r\nO'Callaghan, now deceased (the said jointure being at that time\r\nseveral years in arrear), a head rent of a hundred guineas a year to\r\nColonel Patterson, with taxes, tithe rent-charges, and heaven knows\r\nwhat besides. In 1846 and 1847 his father had made considerable\r\nreductions in the rents of the Bodyke holdings, but the tenants had\r\ncontrived to fall into arrears to the respectable tune of £6,000, or\r\nthereabouts. Such was the state of things when the heir came into his\r\nhappy possessions.\r\n\r\nA Protestant clergyman said to me--\"Land in Ireland is like\r\nself-righteousness. The more you have, the worse off you are.\" Thus\r\nwas it at Bodyke.\r\n\r\nSomething had to be done. To ask the tenants for the £6,000 was mere\r\nwaste of breath. The young soldier had no agent. He was determined to\r\nbe the people's friend. Although a Black Protestant, he was ambitious\r\nof Catholic good-will. He wanted to have the tenants blessing him. He\r\ncoveted the good name which is better than rubies. He wished to make\r\nthings comfortable, to be a general benefactor of his species; if a\r\nProtestant landlord and a Roman Catholic tenantry can be said to be of\r\nthe same species at all, a point which, according to the Nationalist\r\npress, is at least doubtful. He called the tenants together, and\r\nagreed to accept three hundred pounds for the six thousand pounds\r\nlegally due, so as to make a fresh start and encourage the people to\r\nwalk in the paths of righteousness. When times began to mend, the\r\nColonel himself a farmer, commenced to raise the rents until they\r\nreached the amount paid during his father's reign. The people stood it\r\nquietly enough until 1879, when the Colonel appointed agents. This\r\nyear was one of agricultural depression. A Mr. Willis succeeded the\r\ntwo first agents, but during the troubles he resigned his charge. The\r\npopular opinion leans to the supposition that his administration was\r\nineffective, that is, that he was comparatively unused to field\r\nstrategy, that he lacked dash and military resource, and that he\r\nentertained a constitutional objection to being shot. The rents came\r\nunder the judicial arrangement, and reductions were made. Still things\r\nwould not work smoothly, and it was agreed that bad years should be\r\nfurther considered on rent days. This agreement led to reductions on\r\nthe judicial rent of 25 to 30 per cent., besides which the Colonel, in\r\nthe arbitration of 1887, had accepted £1,000 in lieu of several\r\nthousand pounds of arrears then due. After November, 1891, the tenants\r\nceased to pay rent at all, and that is practically their present\r\nposition. The Colonel, who being himself an experienced farmer is a\r\ncompetent judge of agricultural affairs, thinks the tenants are able\r\nto pay, and even believes that they are willing, were it not for the\r\nintimidation of half-a-score village ruffians whose threatened\r\nmoonlighting exploits, when considered in conjunction with the bloody\r\ndeeds which have characterised the district up to recent times, are\r\nsufficient to paralyse the whole force of the British Empire, when\r\nthat force is directed by the feeble fumblers now in office.\r\n\r\nThat they can pay if they will, is clearly proved by recent\r\noccurrences. Let us abandon ancient history and bring our story down\r\nto date. The number of incidents is so great, and the complications\r\narising from local customs and prejudices are so bewildering that only\r\nafter much inquiry have I been able to sort from the tangled web a few\r\nclear and understandable instances, which, however, may be taken as a\r\nfair sample of the whole.\r\n\r\nNew brooms sweep clean. The new agent, Mr. MacAdam, began to\r\nnegotiate. Pow-wows and palavers all ended in smoke, and as meanwhile\r\nthe charges on the estate were going on merrily, and no money was\r\ncoming in to meet them, writs were issued against six of the best-off\r\nfarmers; writs, not decrees, the writ being a more effective\r\ninstrument. One Malone was evicted. He was a married man, without\r\nencumbrances, owed several years' arrears, had mismanaged his farm, a\r\nreally good bit of land, had been forgiven a lot of rent, and still he\r\nwas not happy. A relative had lent him nearly £200 to carry on, but\r\nMalone was a bottomless pit. What he required was a gold mine and a\r\nman to shovel up the ore, but unhappily no such thing existed on the\r\nfarm. The relative offered to take the land, believing that he could\r\nsoon recoup himself the loan, but Malone held on with iron grip,\r\nrefusing to listen to the voice of the charmer, charmed he never so\r\nwisely. The relative wished to take the place at the judicial rent,\r\nand offered to give Malone the house, grass for a cow, and the use of\r\nthree acres of land. Malone declined to make any change, and as a last\r\nresort it was decided to evict him. On the auspicious day MacAdam\r\narrived from Limerick, accompanied by two men from Dublin, whom he\r\nproposed to instal as caretakers in Malone's house. The Sheriff's\r\nparty were late, and MacAdam, waiting at some distance, was discovered\r\nand the alarm given. Horns were blown, the chapel bell was rung, the\r\nwhole country turned out in force. Anticipating seizure, the people\r\ndrove away their cattle, and shortly no hoof nor horn was visible in\r\nthe district. A crowd collected and, observing the caretakers, at once\r\ndivined their mission, and perceived that not seizure, but eviction,\r\nwas the order of the day. They rushed to Malone's house, and, with his\r\nconsent and assistance, tore off the roof, smashed the windows, and\r\ndemolished the doors. The place was thus rendered uninhabitable.\r\n\r\nThis having been happily effected, the Sheriff's party arrived an hour\r\nor so late, in the Irish fashion. Possession was formally given to the\r\nagent, who was now free to revel in the four bare walls, and to enjoy\r\nthe highly-ventilated condition of the building. The crowd became more\r\nand more threatening, and if they could have mustered pluck to run in\r\non the loaded rifles, Sheriff, agent, and escort must have been\r\nmurdered without mercy. The shouting and threatening were heard two\r\nmiles away. But the tenants had taken other measures. A firing party\r\nwas posted on a neighbouring hill, and as the Sheriff left the shelter\r\nof the walls a volley was poured in from a clump of trees four\r\nhundred yards away, one bullet narrowly missing a man who ducked at\r\nthe flash. The riflemen were visible among the trees, and the Sheriff\r\nreturned the fire. Several policemen also fired into the clump, but\r\nwithout effect, and their fire was briskly returned from the hill,\r\nthis time just missing the head of a policeman covered by a bush, a\r\nbullet cutting off a branch close to his ear. The police then prepared\r\nto charge up the hill, when the firing party decamped. No arrests were\r\nmade, although the marksmen must have been dwellers in the\r\nneighbourhood. A policeman said, \"We know who they are; you can't\r\nconceal these things in a country place; but we have no legal\r\nevidence, and although we saw them at four hundred yards, who will\r\naccept our identification at such a distance? And of course no jury\r\nwould convict. We have no remedy in this unfortunate country. So long\r\nas Gladstone and such folks are bidding for the people's votes so long\r\nwe shall have lawlessness. But for the change of Government all would\r\nlong have been settled amicably. But I heard a young priest say to the\r\npeople, 'Hold on a bit till the new Government goes in.'\"\r\n\r\nTo return to the Malone affair, Mr. MacAdam applied to the police for\r\nresident protection not for himself, but for the caretakers, whom he\r\nnow proposed to instal in a farmhouse in the occupation of one of the\r\nColonel's servants, and from which no one had been evicted. The\r\nauthorities refused protection on the very remarkable plea that the\r\nsituation of the aforesaid premises was so dangerous! so that had the\r\nplace been quite safe, they would have consented to protect it.\r\nMacAdam determined to carry out his plan, with or without protection.\r\nHe left Limerick at midnight with an ammunition and provision train of\r\nseven cars, with two caretakers and four workmen, with materials to\r\nfortify the place. He had previously given the authorities notice that\r\nhe meant to occupy Knockclare, the house in question, and before he\r\nstarted they sent a police-sergeant from Tulla, a twenty miles drive,\r\nto formally warn him off, for that his life would assuredly be taken,\r\nand the officer also demanded that he should be permitted to\r\npersonally warn the caretakers of the risk they ran. This was granted,\r\nbut the men stuck to their guns. At the eviction a man had funked,\r\nfrightened out of his seven senses. The police declined all\r\nresponsibility, but offered to guard the farm for a shilling per man\r\nper day. MacAdam thought this proposal without precedent, and left the\r\npolice to their own devices, driving along the twenty miles of hilly\r\nroad, with sorry steeds that refused the last hill, so that the loads\r\nhad to be pushed and carried up by the men. This was at eight or nine\r\nin the morning, after many hours' toilsome march. The fun was not over\r\nyet. Like the penny show, it was \"just a-goin' to begin.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd turned out and with awful threats of instant death menaced\r\nthe lives of the party, who, with levelled rifles, at last gained the\r\nbuilding. The people brought boards, and showed the caretakers their\r\ncoffins in the rough. They spoke of shooting, and swore they would\r\nroast them alive that night by burning the house in which they were\r\nsheltered. A shot was fired at MacAdam. A sergeant with one man\r\narrived from Tulla police-barracks and urged the party to leave before\r\nthey were murdered. MacAdam would hold his post at all risks. Later\r\neight armed policemen arrived, and then two carmen started to go home.\r\nA wall of stones blocked the road. They somehow got over that, and\r\nfound a second wall a little further on. Here was a menacing crowd,\r\nand the police who followed the car drew their revolvers, and with\r\ngreat determination advanced on the mob, saving the carmen's lives,\r\nfor which they were publicly praised from the Bench. But the jarveys\r\nreturned, and by a circuitous route reached Limerick viâ Killaloe,\r\nthanking Heaven for their whole skins, and vowing never to so risk\r\nthem again. The County Inspector who refused the party police\r\nprotection explained that he did so \"out of regard for the safety of\r\nhis men.\" He said, \"I had more than Mr. MacAdam and his party to\r\nconsider. I must preserve the lives of the men in my charge.\"\r\n\r\nAt present the two caretakers hold the citadel, which is also\r\ngarrisoned by a force of sixteen policemen regularly relieved by day\r\nand by night, every man armed to the teeth. Now and then the foinest\r\npisintry in the wuruld turn out to the neighbouring hills and blaze\r\naway with rifles at the doors and windows of the little barn-like\r\nstructure. The marksmen want a competent instructor. Anyone who knows\r\nanything of shooting knows the high art and scientific knowledge\r\nrequired for long-range rifle practice. These men are willing, but\r\nthey lack science. Knowledge to their eyes her ample page, Rich with\r\nthe spoils of time, has ne'er unrolled. Mr. Gladstone might bring over\r\nfrom the Transvaal a number of the Boers whose shooting impressed him\r\nso much to coach these humble Kelts in the mysteries of rifle\r\nshooting. Such a measure would perceptibly accelerate the passage of\r\nthe Home Rule Bill.\r\n\r\nSuch is the state of things in Bodyke at this moment. Colonel\r\nO'Callaghan has had no penny of rent for years--that is, nothing for\r\nhimself. What has been paid by the tenants of Fort Ann and Milltown\r\nhas been barely sufficient to meet the charges on the estate. The\r\nColonel thinks that the more he concedes the more his people want. He\r\nhas had many narrow escapes from shooting, and rather expects to be\r\nbagged at last. He seems to be constitutionally unconscious of fear,\r\nbut the police, against his wish, watch over him. In the few instances\r\nin which Mr. MacAdam, his agent, has effected seizures, the people\r\nhave immediately paid up--have simply walked into their houses,\r\nbrought out the money, and planked down the rent with all expenses,\r\nthe latter amounting to some 20 or 25 per cent. They _can_ pay. The\r\nColonel, who lives by farming, having no other source of income, knows\r\ntheir respective positions exactly, and declines to be humbugged. The\r\ntenants believe that they will shortly have the land for nothing, and\r\nthey are content to remain in a state of siege, themselves\r\nbeleaguering the investing force, lodged in the centre of the\r\nposition. The fields are desolate, tillage is suspended, and the whole\r\nof the cattle are driven out of sight. Armed men watch each other by\r\nnight and by day, and bloodshed may take place at any moment. The\r\nfarming operations of the whole region are disorganised and out of\r\njoint. Six men have been arrested for threats and violence, but all\r\nwere discharged--the jury would not convict, although the judge said\r\nthe evidence for the defence was of itself sufficient to convict the\r\ngang. A ruffian sprang on MacAdam with an open knife, swearing he\r\nwould disembowel him. After a terrible struggle the man was disarmed\r\nand secured, brought up before the beak, and the offence proved to the\r\nhilt. This gentleman was dismissed without a stain on his character.\r\nMacAdam asked that he should at least be bound over to keep the peace.\r\nThis small boon was refused. Comment is needless. How long are the\r\nEnglish people going to stand this Morley-Gladstone management?\r\n\r\nI have not yet been able to interview Colonel O'Callaghan himself, but\r\nmy information, backed by my own observation, may be relied on as\r\naccurate. The carman who drove me hither said \"The Bodyke boys are\r\ndacent fellows, but they must have their sport. Tis their nature to be\r\nshootin' folks, an' ye can't find fault with a snipe for havin' a long\r\nbill. An' they murther ye in sich a tinder-hearted way that no\r\nraisonable landlord could have any objection to it.\"\r\n\r\nI have the honour of again remarking that Ireland is a wonderful\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBodyke (Co. Clare), May 2nd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 17.--RENT AT THE ROOT OF NATIONALISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tenants of the Bodyke property stigmatise Colonel O'Callaghan as\r\nthe worst landlord in the world, and declare themselves totally unable\r\nto pay the rent demanded, and even in some cases say that they cannot\r\npay any rent at all, a statement which is effectually contradicted by\r\nthe fact that most of them pay up when fairly out-generalled by the\r\ndashing strategy of Mr. Stannard MacAdam, whose experience as a racing\r\nbicyclist seems to have stood him in good stead. The country about\r\nBodyke has an unfertile look, a stony, boggy, barren appearance. Here\r\nand there are patches of tolerable land, but the district cannot\r\nfairly be called a garden of Eden. Being desirous of hearing both\r\nsides of the question, I have conversed with several of the\r\ncomplaining farmers, most of whom have very small holdings, if their\r\nsize be reckoned by the rent demanded. The farmers' homes are not\r\nluxurious, but the rural standard of luxury is in Ireland everywhere\r\nfar below that of the English cottar, who would hold up his hands in\r\ndismay if required to accommodate himself to such surroundings.\r\nBriefly stated, the case of the tenants is based on an alleged\r\nagreement on the part of Colonel O'Callaghan to make a reduction of\r\ntwenty-five per cent. on judicial rents and thirty-seven and a half\r\nper cent. on non-judicial rents, whenever the farming season proved\r\nunfavourable. This was duly carried out until 1891, when the question\r\narose as to whether that was or was not a bad year. The tenants say\r\nthat 1891 was abnormally bad for them, but that on attending to pay\r\ntheir rent, believing that the reductions which had formerly been\r\nmade, and which they had come to regard as invariable, would again\r\ntake place, they were told that the customary rebate would now cease\r\nand determine, and that therefore they were expected to pay their\r\nrents in full. This they profess to regard as a flagrant breach of\r\nfaith, and they at once decided to pay no rent at all. The position\r\nbecame a deadlock, and such it still remains. They affect to believe\r\nthat the last agent, Mr. Willis, resigned his post out of sheer\r\nsympathy, and not because he feared sudden translation to a brighter\r\nsphere. They complain that the Colonel's stables are too handsome, and\r\nthat they themselves live in cabins less luxurious than the lodgings\r\nof the landlord's horses. There is no epithet too strong to express\r\ntheir indignation against the devoted Colonel, who was described by\r\none imaginative peasant, who had worked himself up to a sort of\r\ndescriptive convulsion, as a \"Rawhacious Vagabone,\" a fine instance of\r\nextemporaneous word-coining of the ideo-phonetic school, which will\r\ndoubtless be greedily accepted by Nationalist Parliamentarians who,\r\nlong ago, exhausted their vocabulary of expletives in dealing with Mr.\r\nGladstone and each other.\r\n\r\nThe Bodykers have one leading idea, to \"wait yet awhile.\" Home Rule\r\nwill banish the landlords, and give the people the land for nothing at\r\nall. The peasantry are mostly fine-grown men, well-built and\r\nwell-nourished, bearing no external trace of the hardships they claim\r\nto have endured. They are civil and obliging, and thoroughly inured to\r\nthe interviewer. They have a peculiar accent, of a sing-song\r\ncharacter, which now and then threatens to break down the stranger's\r\ngravity. That the present state of things is intolerable, and cannot\r\nlast much longer, they freely admit, but they claim to have the tacit\r\nsympathy of the present Government, and gleefully relate with what\r\nunwillingness police protection was granted to the agent and his men.\r\nThey disclaim any intention of shooting or otherwise murdering the\r\nlandlord or his officers, and assert that the fact that they still\r\nlive is sufficient evidence in this direction. Said one white-headed\r\nman of gentle, deferential manner:--\r\n\r\n\"The days o' landlord shootin' is gone by. If the Boys wanted to shoot\r\nthe Colonel what's to hinder them? Would his double-barrel protect\r\nhim, or the four dogs he has about him, that he sends sniffin' an'\r\ngrowlin' about the threes an' ditches. If the word wint out he\r\nwouldn't live a day, nor his agint nayther. An' his durty emergency\r\nmen, that's posted like spies at the house beyant, could be potted any\r\ntime they showed their noses. An' couldn't we starve thim out?\r\nCouldn't we cut off their provisions? Why would we commit murther whin\r\nwe have only to wait till things turn round, which wid the help of God\r\nwill be afore long. We're harassed an' throubled, always pullin' the\r\ndivil by the tail, but that won't last for ever. We'll have our own\r\nmen, that ondershtands Oireland, to put us right, an' then O'Callaghan\r\nan' all his durty thribe'll be fired out of the counthry before ye can\r\nsay black's the white o' my eye; an' black curses go wid thim.\"\r\n\r\nThe caretakers are not accessible. Stringent orders forbid the giving\r\nof information to any person whatever. This is unfortunate, as a look\r\nat their diaries would prove amusing. They must feel like rabbits\r\nliving in a burrow bored in a sporting district, or the man in the\r\niron mask, or the late respected Damocles, or the gentleman who saw\r\nthe handwriting on the wall. Their sleep must be troubled. They must\r\nhave ugly dreams of treasons, stratagems, and spoils, and when they\r\nwake, swearing a prayer or two, they doubtless see through the gloom,\r\nMENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN (I quote from memory), in lurid letters on\r\nthe ceiling of their stronghold. Their waking visions and their daily\r\ntalk must be of guns and pikes, of graves and coffins, shrouds and\r\nskeletons. Perhaps they, like Mr. MacAdam and some others, have\r\nreceived missives sprinkled with blood, and ornamented with skulls and\r\ncross-bones, those famous national emblems which the Irish tenant\r\nsketches with a rude, untutored art; bold, freehand drawings, done in\r\ngore by hereditary instinct. It may be that they see the newspapers,\r\nthat they learn how the other day the house of a caretaker at\r\nTipperary was, by incendiaries, burned to the ground, the poor fellow\r\nat the time suffering from lockjaw, taking his food with difficulty,\r\nowing to his having some time previously been shot through the face.\r\nOr they may read of the shooting case at Castleisland, and how Mr.\r\nMagilicuddy suggests that such cases be made public, that the people\r\nmay know something of the present lawlessness of the country, or of\r\nthe narrow squeak of Mr. Walshe, a schoolmaster, living just outside\r\nEnnis, who barely escaped with his life from two bullets, fired at\r\nhim, because his wife had been appointed mistress of the girls; or the\r\nsad affair of Mr. Blood of the same district, who being an admittedly\r\nkind and amiable man, is compelled to be always under the escort of\r\nfour armed policemen for that he did discharge a herdman without first\r\nasking permission from the local patriots. Or they may meditate on the\r\nfate of the old man near Clonmel, who was so beaten that he has since\r\ndied, his daughter, who might have aided him, having first been\r\nfastened in her room. These and a hundred similar instances of outrage\r\nand attempted murder have crept into print during the last few days.\r\nRed ruin and the breaking-up of laws herald the Home Rule Bill. And\r\nif the premonitory symptoms be thus severe, how shall we doctor the\r\ndisease itself?\r\n\r\nThe other day I stumbled on Mr. Lynn, of Dublin, whom I first met at\r\nthe Queen's Hotel, Portadown, County Armagh. He said, \"We ought to\r\nknow what the Home Rule Bill will do. We know the materials of which\r\nthe dish is composed, we have seen their preparation and mixing, we\r\nnow have the process of cooking before us, and when we get it it will\r\ngive us indigestion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bodykers have a new grievance, one of most recent date. They had\r\nfound a delightful means of evasion, which for a time worked well, but\r\nthe bottom has been knocked out of it, and their legal knowledge has\r\nproved of no avail. To pay rent whenever a seizure was effected was\r\nvoted a bore, a calamitous abandonment of principle, and a loss of\r\nmoney which might be better applied. So that when MacAdam made his\r\nlatest seizures, say on the land of Brown and Jones, these\r\nout-manoeuvred tenants brought forward friends named Smith and\r\nRobinson who deeply swore and filed affidavits to the effect that the\r\ncattle so seized belonged to them, Smith and Robinson to wit, and not\r\nto the afore-mentioned Brown and Jones, on whose land they were found.\r\nHere was a pretty kettle of fish. Colonel O'Callaghan, or his agent,\r\nwere processed for illegal distraint, and the evidence being dead\r\nagainst the landlord, that fell tyrant had on several occasions to\r\ndisgorge his prey, whereat there was great rejoicing in Bodyke. The\r\nnew agent, however, is a tough customer, and in his quality of Clerk\r\nof Petty Sessions dabbles in legal lore. He found an Act which\r\nprovides that, after due formalities, distraint may be made on any\r\ncattle found on the land in respect of which rent is due, no matter to\r\nwhom the said cattle may belong. The tenants are said to have been\r\narranging an amicable interchange of grazing land, the cows of Smith\r\nfeeding on the land of Brown, and _vice versâ_, so that the affidavit\r\nagreement might have some colour of decency. The ancient Act\r\ndiscovered by the ardent MacAdam has rendered null and void this\r\nproposed fraternal reciprocity, and the order to conceal every hoof\r\nand horn pending discovery of the right answer to this last atrocity\r\nhas been punctually obeyed, the local papers slanging landlord and\r\nagent, but seemingly unable to find the proper countermine. No end of\r\ndetails and of incident might be given, but no substantial increase\r\ncould be made to the information, given in this and my preceding\r\nletter. The tenants say that the landlord perversely refuses the\r\nreductions allowed in better times, and the landlord says that as a\r\npractical farmer he believes that those upon whom he has distrained or\r\nattempted to distrain are able to pay in full. He declares that he has\r\nnot proceeded against those who from any cause are unable to meet\r\ntheir obligations, but only against the well-to-do men, who, having\r\nthe money in hand, are deliberately withholding his just and\r\nreasonable due, taking advantage of the disturbed state of the country\r\nand the weakness of the Government to benefit themselves, regardless\r\nof the suffering their selfishness entails on innocent people.\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast to the turbulence of the Bodyke men is the\r\npeaceful calm of the Castleconnel people. I have had several pleasant\r\ninterviews with Lady de Burgho, whose territory embraces some sixty\r\nthousand acres, and who, during a widowed life of twenty-two years,\r\nhas borne the stress and strain of Irish estate administration, with\r\nits eternal and wearisome chopping and changing of law, its\r\nlabyrinthine complications, its killing responsibilities. Lady de\r\nBurgho is, after all, very far from dead, exhibiting in fact a\r\nmarvellous vitality, and discoursing of the ins and outs of the\r\nvarious harassing Land Acts, and the astute diplomacy needful to save\r\nsomething from the wreck, with a light, airy vivacity, and a rich\r\nnative humour irresistibly charming. The recital of her troubles,\r\nlosses, and burdens, the dodgery and trickery of legal luminaries, and\r\nthe total extinction of rent profits is delivered with an easy grace,\r\nand with the colour and effervescence of sparkling Burgundy. To be\r\ndeprived of nine-tenths of your income seems remarkably good fun; to\r\nbe ruined, an enviable kind of thing. Lady de Burgho commenced her\r\nreign with one fixed principle, from which nothing has ever induced\r\nher to deviate. Under no conceivable circumstances would she allow\r\neviction. No agent could induce her to sign a writ. \"I could not sleep\r\nif I had turned out an Irish family,\" says Lady de Burgho, adding,\r\nwith great sagacity, \"and besides eviction never does any good.\" So\r\nthat this amiable lady has the affections of her people, if she\r\nhandles not their cash. And who shall estimate the heart's pure\r\nfeelings? Saith not the wisest of men that a good report maketh the\r\nbones fat? Is not the goodwill of the foinest pisintry in the wuruld\r\nmore to be desired than much fine gold? Is it not sweeter also than\r\nhoney or the honeycomb?\r\n\r\nCertain mortgagees who wished to appropriate certain lands offered\r\nliberal terms to Lady de Burgho on condition that she would for three\r\nyears absent herself from Ireland, holding no communication with her\r\ntenants during that period. Lady de Burgho objected. She said, \"If I\r\naccepted your terms my people on my return would believe, and they\r\nwould be justified in believing, that I had been for three years\r\nincarcerated in a lunatic asylum.\" Tableau! Three American gentlemen\r\nvisiting Castleconnel told Lady de Burgho that the success of the\r\npresent agitation in favour of Home Rule would be the first step\r\ntowards making Ireland an American dependency, a pronouncement which\r\nis not without substantial foundation. The feeling of the masses is\r\ntowards America, and away from England. To the New World, where are\r\nmore Irish than in Ireland (so they say) the poorer classes look with\r\nsteadfast eye. To them America is the chief end of man, the earthly\r\nParadise, the promised land, the El Dorado, a heaven upon earth. Every\r\nable-bodied man is saving up to pay his passage, every good-looking\r\ngirl is anxious to give herself a better chance in the States. Nearly\r\nall have relatives to give them a start, and glowing letters from\r\nfortunate emigrants are the theme of every village. The effect of\r\nthese epistles is obvious enough. Home Rule, say the Nationalists,\r\nwill stop emigration. That this is with them a matter of hope, or\r\npious belief, is made clear by their conversation. They give no good\r\nreason for their faith. They are cornered with consummate ease. The\r\nplausibilities gorged by Gladstonian gulls do not go down in Ireland.\r\nThey are not offered to Irishmen. \"Made in Ireland for English gabies\"\r\nshould be branded upon them. The most convincing arguments against the\r\nbill are those adduced by Home Rulers in its favour. Here is a\r\nfaithful statement of reasons for Home Rule, as given by Alderman\r\nDowning, of Limerick, and another gentleman then present whose name I\r\nknow not:--\r\n\r\n\"When you allow the Irish Legislature to frame its own laws, disorder\r\nand outrage will be put down with an iron hand. We have no law at\r\npresent. Put an Irish Parliament in Dublin, and we would arrange to\r\nhang up moonlighters to the nearest tree. Everybody would support the\r\nlaw if imposed from Dublin. They resent it as imposed by Englishmen in\r\nLondon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not in favour of handing over the government of Ireland to the\r\npresent leaders of the Irish party. I believe that, once granted Home\r\nRule, they would disappear into private life, and that we should\r\nreplace them by better men. What reason for believing this? Oh, I\r\nthink the people would begin to feel their responsibility. Do I think\r\nthe idea of 'responsibility' is their leading idea? Perhaps not at\r\nthis moment, but they will improve. You think that the people may be\r\nfairly expected to return the same class of men? Perhaps so. I hope\r\nnot. I should think they would see the necessity of sending men of\r\nposition and property. Why don't they send them now? Simply because\r\nthey won't come forward; that class of men do not believe in Home\r\nRule.\"\r\n\r\nI humbly submitted that this would prevent their coming forward in\r\nfuture, and that if Home Rule were admittedly bad under the present\r\nleaders, there was really no case to go to a jury, as there was no\r\nevidence before the court to show that the leaders would be dropped.\r\nOn the contrary, there was every probability that the victorious\r\npromoters of the bill would be returned by acclamation. Further, that\r\nif Home Rule be gladly accepted as a pearl of great price, to drop the\r\ngainers thereof, to dismiss the men who had borne the burden and heat\r\nof the day, would be an act of shabbiness unworthy the proverbial\r\ngratitude and generosity of the Irish people.\r\n\r\nAlderman Downing would only exclude them from Parliamentary place, and\r\nwould not exclude all even then. The bulk of them might be found some\r\nsort of situation where decent salaries would atone for the dropping.\r\nWould that be jobbery? \"Ah, you ask too many questions.\"\r\n\r\nLet it be noted that although the greater part of the Irish\r\nNationalist members are everywhere rejected beforehand by superior\r\nHome Rulers, as unfit for an Irish Parliament, they are apparently for\r\nthat very reason sent to the House of Commons as the best sort to\r\ntease the brutal Saxon. The bulldog is not the noblest, nor the\r\nhandsomest, nor the swiftest, nor the most faithful, nor the most\r\nsagacious, nor the most pleasant companion of the canine world, but he\r\nis a good 'un to hang on the nose of the bull.\r\n\r\nThe Great Unknown said:\r\n\r\n\"You must admit that English Rule has not been a success. Home Rule is\r\nadmittedly an experiment--well, yes, I will accept the word risk--Home\r\nRule is admittedly, to some extent, a risk, but let us try it. And if\r\nthe worst comes to the worst we can go back again to the old\r\narrangement.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a kindly gentleman of sixty or sixty-five years, and,\r\nlike Alderman Downing, spoke in a reasonable, moderate tone. Doubtless\r\nboth are excellent citizens, men of considerable position and\r\ninfluence, certainly very pleasant companions, and, to all appearance,\r\nwell-read, well-informed men. And yet, in the presence of Unionist\r\nIrishmen, the above-mentioned arguments were all they ventured to\r\noffer. Arguments, quotha? Is the hope that the ignorant peasantry of\r\nIreland will return \"the better class of men,\" who \"do not believe in\r\nHome Rule\" an argument? Is the as-you-were assertion an argument? What\r\nwould the Irish say if Mr. Bull suggested this movement of\r\nretrogression? We should have Father Hayes, the friend of Father\r\nHumphreys, again calling for \"dynamite, for the lightnings of heaven\r\nand the fires of hell, to pulverise every British cur into\r\ntop-dressing for the soil.\" We should have Father Humphreys himself\r\nwriting ill-spelt letters to the press, and denouncing all liars as\r\npoachers on his own preserves. We should have Dillon and O'Brien and\r\ntheir crew again leading their ignorant countrymen to the treadmill,\r\nwhile the true culprits stalked the streets wearing lemon-coloured kid\r\ngloves purchased with the hard-earned and slowly-accumulated cents of\r\nIrish-American slaveys. The Protestants would be denounced as the\r\nblackest, cruellest, most callous slave-drivers on God's earth. And\r\nthis reminds me of something.\r\n\r\nDoctor O'Shaughnessy, of Limerick, is the most wonderful man in\r\nIreland. His diploma was duly secured in 1826, and Daniel O'Connell\r\nwas his most intimate friend, and also his patient. The Doctor lived\r\nlong in London, and was a regular attendant at the House of Commons up\r\nto 1832. Twice he fought Limerick for his son, and twice he won\r\neasily. The city is now represented by Mr. O'Keefe, and Mr.\r\nO'Shaughnessy is a Commissioner of the Board of Works in Dublin. The\r\nDoctor has conferred with Earl Spencer on grave and weighty matters,\r\nand doubtless his opinion on Irish questions is of greatest value. His\r\npupil and his fellow-student, Dr. Kidd and Dr. Quain (I forget which\r\nis which), met at the bedside of Lord Beaconsfield, and medical men\r\nadmit the doctor's professional eminence. His eighty-four years sit\r\nlightly upon him. He looks no more than fifty at most, is straight as\r\na reed, active as a hare, runs upstairs like a boy of fourteen, has\r\nthe clear blue eye and fresh rosy skin of a young man. He would give\r\nthe Grand Old Man fifty in a hundred and beat him out of his boots. He\r\nmight be Mr. Gladstone's son, if he were only fond of jam. The Doctor\r\nsaid several hundred good things which I would like to print, but as\r\nour many conferences were unofficial this would be hardly fair.\r\nHowever, I feel sure Doctor O'Shaughnessy will forgive my repeating\r\none statement of his--premising that the Doctor is a devout Catholic,\r\nand that he knows all about land.\r\n\r\n\"The Protestants are not the worst landlords. The hardest men, the\r\nmost unyielding men the tenants have to meet are the Roman Catholic\r\nlandlords, the new men.\"\r\n\r\nHere is some food for thought. These few words, properly considered,\r\ncover much ground. The Doctor is a Home Ruler, an ardent lover of his\r\ncountry, one of the best of the many high-minded men I have met in\r\nIreland. Were such as he in the forefront of the battle, John Bull\r\nmight hand the Irish a blank cheque. The consciousness of trust is of\r\nall things most binding on men of integrity. But for Mr. Gladstone to\r\nhand the honour of England to Horsewhipped Healy and Breeches O'Brien,\r\nshowing his confidence in them by permitting it to be taken round the\r\ncorner--that is a different thing. I forgot to mention a remarkable\r\nfeature in the history of Limerick City, a parallel of which is found\r\nin the apocryphal castle in England for which the unique distinction\r\nis claimed that Queen Elizabeth never slept there. And so far as I can\r\nlearn, Tim Healy has not yet been horsewhipped in Limerick.\r\n\r\nBodyke (Co. Clare), May 2nd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 18.--HARD FACTS FOR ENGLISH READERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCort is a quiet wayside country town about forty miles from Limerick,\r\na little oasis of trees and flowers, with a clear winding trout-stream\r\nrunning all about it. The streets are wide, the houses well-built, the\r\npavements kerbed and in good condition. Trees are bigger and more\r\nnumerous than usual, and the place has a generally bowery appearance\r\nsuch as is uncommon in Ireland, which is not famous for its timber.\r\nTrees are in many parts the grand desideratum, the one thing needful\r\nto perfect the beauty of the scenery, but Ireland as compared with\r\nEngland, France, Holland, Belgium, or Germany may almost be called a\r\ntreeless country. Strange to say, the Home Rule Bill, which affects\r\neverything, threatens to deprive the country of its few remaining\r\ntrees. A Scotsman resident thirteen years in Ireland said to me:--\r\n\r\n\"The timber you see lying there is not American, but Irish. The people\r\nwho have timber are in many cases cutting it down, because they\r\nforesee a state of general insecurity and depression, and they need\r\nall the cash they can command. But there is another reason for the\r\ndeforesting of the country, which is--that if Home Rule becomes law,\r\nthe landowners are disposed to believe that no allowance will be made\r\nfor the timber which may be on the land when the land is sold to the\r\ntenant under some unknown Act to be passed at some future day.\" This\r\nfits into the point raised by a tenant farmer living just outside the\r\ntown, an extraordinary character said to rise at seven o'clock in the\r\nmorning. He said:--\r\n\r\n\"They say the farmer is to get the land--but what then? Somebody must\r\nown the land, and whoever has it will be reckoned a bloody tyrant.\r\nWon't the owner be a landlord? No, say they, no more landlords at all,\r\nat all. But isn't that nonsense, says I? If ye split up the land into\r\npatches as big as yer hand and give every man a patch, wouldn't some\r\nmen have twenty or a hundred, or maybe a thousand patches in five\r\nyears? An' thin, thim that was lazy an' wasteful an' got out o' their\r\nland would be for shootin' the savin', sthrivin' man that worked his\r\nway up by buying out the drones. For wouldn't he be a landlord the\r\nmoment he stopped workin' all the land himself. An' that would be sure\r\nto happen at wanst. Lord Gough is landlord here, an' ye'll not better\r\nhim in Ireland. Look at the town there--all built of stone an' paved,\r\nwid a fine public well in the square, an' a weigh-house, an' the\r\ngroves of lilac an' laburnums all out in flower an' dippin' in the\r\nwather; where ye may catch mighty fine trout out iv yer bedroom\r\nwindow, bedad ye may, or out of yer kitchin, an' draw them out iv the\r\nwather an' dhrop thim in' the fryin' pan off the hook with the bait in\r\ntheir mouths, an' their tails waggin', finishing their brakefasts\r\nthimselves while they get yours ready! Throth ye can. None iv us that\r\nhas any sinse belaves in Home Rule. 'Tis only the ignorant that'll\r\nbelave anything. No, we're quiet hereabouts, never shot anybody, an'\r\nnot likely to. Yes, the Protestant Church is iligant enough, but\r\nthere's very few Protestants hereabouts. It's the gentry an' most\r\nrespectable folks that's Protestants. Protestants gets on because they\r\nkape their shops cleaner, an' has more taste, an' we'd sooner belave\r\nthim an' thrust thim that they'd kape their word an' not chate ye,\r\nthan our own people. Yes, 'tis indeed quare, but it's thrue. The very\r\npriests won't deny it. An' another thing they wouldn't deny. The\r\nmurtherin', sweatin' landlords that'll grind the very soul out of\r\nye--who are they? Tell me now. Just the small men that have got up out\r\nof the muck. 'Tisn't the gintry at all. The gintry will wait a year,\r\nthree years, five years, seven years for rint. The man that bought his\r\nfarm or two wid borrowed money won't wait a day. 'Out ye go, an'\r\nbloody end to ye,' says he. Ye don't hear of thim evictions. The man\r\nthat sint it to the paper would get bate--or worse.\r\n\r\n\"An' some of the little houldhers says, 'Pat,' says they, 'what'll we\r\ndo wid the money whin we've no taxes to pay?' 'Tis what they're tould,\r\nthe crathurs. God help them, but they're mighty ignorant.\"\r\n\r\nThose who ridicule the assertions of Protestants and Catholic\r\nUnionists with reference to the lack of liberty may explain away what\r\nwas told me by Mr. J.B. Barrington, brother of Sir Charles Barrington,\r\na name of might in Mid-Ireland. He said, \"Someone in our neighbourhood\r\nwent about getting signatures to a petition against the Home Rule\r\nBill. Among others who signed it was Captain Croker's carpenter, who\r\nsince then has been waylaid and severely beaten. Another case\r\noccurring in the same district was even harder. A poor fellow has\r\nundergone a very severe thrashing with sticks for having signed the\r\nbill when, as a matter of fact, he had refused to sign it! Wasn't that\r\nhard lines? Both these men know their assailants, but they will not\r\ntell. They think it better to bear those ills they have than fly to\r\nothers that they know not of. They are quite right, for, as it is,\r\nthey know the end of the matter. Punish the beaters, and the relations\r\nof the convicted men would take up the cause, and if they could not\r\ncome on the principal, if he had removed, or was awkward to get at,\r\nthey would pass it on to his relations. So that a man's rebelling\r\nagainst the village ruffians may involve his dearest friends in\r\ntrouble, may subject them to ill-usage or boycotting. A man might\r\nfight it out if he only had himself to consider; but you see where the\r\nshoe pinches.\"\r\n\r\nA decent man in Ennis thus expressed himself anent the Bodyke affair.\r\n(My friend is a Catholic Nationalist.) \"The Bodyke men are not all out\r\nso badly off as they seem. But their acts are bad, for they can pay,\r\nand they will not. No, I do not call the Colonel a bad landlord. We\r\nknow all about it in Ennis; everybody agrees, too. The farmers meet in\r\nthis town and elsewhere. Two or three of the best talkers lead the\r\nmeeting, and everything is done _their_ way. The more decent, sensible\r\nmen are not always the best talkers. Look at Gladstone, have ye\r\nanybody to come up to him? An' look at his character--one way to-day\r\nan' another way to-morrow, an' the divil himself wouldn't say what the\r\nday afther that. But often the most decent, sensible men among these\r\nfarmers can't express themselves, an they get put down. An' all are\r\nbound by the resolutions passed. None must pay rent till they get\r\nleave from all. What would happen a man who would pay rent on the\r\nBodyke estate? He might order his coffin an' the crape for his\r\nberryin, an' dig his own grave to save his widow the expense. Perhaps\r\nye have Gladstonian life-assurance offices in England? What praymium\r\nwould they want for the life of a Bodyke man that paid his rint to the\r\nColonel?\"\r\n\r\nThe \"praymium\" would doubtless be \"steep.\" Boycotting is hard to bear,\r\nas testified by Mr. Dawson, a certain Clerk of Petty Sessions. He\r\nsaid:--\"The Darcy family took a small farm from which a man had been\r\nevicted after having paid no rent for seven years. The land lay waste\r\nfor five years, absolutely derelict, before the Darcys took it in\r\nhand. They were boycotted. Their own relations dare not speak to them\r\nlest they, too, should be included in the curse. A member of the Darcy\r\nfamily died.\r\n\r\n\"Then came severe inconveniences. Friends had secretly conveyed\r\nprovisions to the Darcys, and, at considerable risk to themselves, had\r\nafforded some slight countenance and assistance. But a dead body, that\r\nwas a terrible affair. No coffin could be had in the whole district,\r\nand someone went thirty miles and got one at the county town by means\r\nof artful stratagem. Then came the funeral. It was to take place at\r\ntwelve one day, but we found there would be a demonstration, and\r\nnobody knew what might happen. The corpse, that of a woman, might have\r\nbeen dragged from the coffin and thrown naked on the street. In the\r\ndead of night a young fellow went round the friends, and we buried the\r\npoor lady at four in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe laziness of the Irish people was here exploited with advantage. A\r\ngreat French chief of police, who had made elaborate dispositions to\r\nmeet a popular uprising, once said, \"Send the police home and the\r\nmilitary to their barracks. There will be no Revolution this evening\r\non account of the rain.\" A very slight shower keeps an Irishman from\r\nwork, and you need not rise very early to get over him. A police\r\nofficer at Gort said to me, \"The people are quiet hereabouts, but I\r\ncouldn't make you understand their ignorance. They do just what the\r\npriest tells them in every mortal thing. They believe that unless they\r\nobey they will go to Hell and endure endless torture for ever. They\r\nbelieve that unless they vote as they are told they will be damned to\r\nall eternity. But oh! if you could see their laziness. They lie abed\r\nhalf the day, and spend most of the rest in minding other people's\r\nbusiness. Before you had been in the town half-an-hour every soul in\r\nthe place was discussing you. They thought you had a very suspicious\r\nappearance, like an agent or a detective or something. Laziness and\r\nignorance, laziness and ignorance, that's what's the matter with\r\nIreland.\"\r\n\r\nThe farmers of this truly rural district distinctly state that they do\r\nnot want Home Rule. They only want the land, and nearly all are\r\nfurnished with Tim Healy's statement that \"The farmer who bought his\r\nown land to-day would, when a Home Rule Parliament was won, be very\r\nsorry that he was in such a hurry.\" Just as the men of Bodyke are\r\ngetting the rifles for which Mr. Davitt wished in order to chastise\r\nthe Royal Irish Constabulary, by way of showing these \"ruffians, the\r\narmed mercenaries of England, that the people of Ireland had not lost\r\nthe spirit of their ancestors.\" Well may a timid Protestant of Gort\r\nsay, \"These men are deceiving England. They only want to get power,\r\nand then they will come out in their true colours. All is quiet here\r\nnow, but the strength of the undercurrent is something tremendous. The\r\nEnglish Home Rulers may pooh-pooh our fears, but they know nothing\r\nabout it. And, besides, _they_ are quite safe. That makes all the\r\ndifference. The change will not drive them from all they hold dear. I\r\ndo not agree with the nonsense about cutting our throats in our beds.\r\nThat speech is an English invention to cast ridicule on us. But we\r\nshall have to clear out of this. Life will be unendurable with an\r\nIrish Parliament returned by priests. For it _will_ be returned by\r\npriests. Surely the Gladstonian English admit that? To speak of\r\nloyalty to England in connection with an Irish Parliament is too\r\nabsurd. Did not the Clan-na-Gael circular say that while its objects\r\nlay far beyond anything that might openly be named, the National\r\nParliament must be first attained by whatever means? Then it went on\r\nto say that Ireland would be able to command the working plant of an\r\narmed revolution. Do you not know that the Irish Army of Independence\r\nis already being organised? What do you suppose the men who join it\r\nthink it means? Did not Arthur O'Connor say that when England was\r\ninvolved in war, that would be the time? Did he not say that 100,000\r\nmen were already prepared, and that at three days' notice Ireland\r\ncould possess double that number, all willing to fight England for\r\nlove, and without any pay? If the English Home Rulers lived in Galway\r\nthey would remember these things as I do. _You think the Bill can\r\nnever become law. If you could assure me of that, I would be a happy\r\nman this night._ I would go to my pillow more contented than I have\r\nbeen for years. _I and my family would go on our knees and thank God\r\nfrom our hearts._\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wakely, of Mount Shannon Daly, said:--\"I live in one of the\r\nwildest parts of Galway, but all went on well with us until this Home\r\nRule Bill upset the country. Now I am completely unsettled. Whether to\r\nplant the land or let it lie waste, I cannot tell. I might not be able\r\nto reap the harvest. Whether to buy stock to raise and fatten, or\r\nwhether to keep what cash we have with a view to a sudden pack-up and\r\nexit, we do not know. And I think we are not the only timid folks, for\r\nthe other day I took a horse twenty-four miles to a fair where I made\r\nsure of selling him easily. I had to take him back the twenty-four\r\nmiles, having wasted my trouble and best part of two days. The\r\nfranchise is too low, that is what ruined the country.\"\r\n\r\nAnother desponding Galwegian found fault with the Liberal party of\r\n1884. He said, \"They were actuated by so much philanthropy. Their\r\nmotto was \"Trust the people.\" We know what was their object well\r\nenough, They let in the flood of Irish democracy. The Radicals got\r\nforty, but the Nationalists gained sixty, and then part of the\r\nRadicals--the steady, sensible party among them--ran out a breakwater\r\nto prevent both countries being swamped. A break-water is a good\r\nthing, but there was no necessity for the flood. They cannot\r\naltogether repair the damage they have done. Look at the Irish members\r\nof twenty years ago, and look at them now. Formerly they were\r\ngentlemen. What are they to-day? A pack of blackguards. Their own\r\nsupporters shrink from entrusting them with the smallest shred of\r\npower. Mr. Gladstone must be as mad as a March hare. The idea of a\r\nDublin Parliament engineered by men whom their own supporters look\r\nupon as rowdies would be amusing but for the seriousness of the\r\nconsequences. Have you been in Ennis? Did you see the great memorial\r\nto the Manchester murderers--'Martyrs' they call them? Their lives\r\nwere taken away for love of their country, and their last breath was\r\nGod save Ireland! That's the inscription, and what does it mean?\r\nLoyalty to England? Would such a thing be permitted on the Continent?\r\nWhy, any sensible Government would stamp out such an innuendo as open\r\nrebellion. It teaches the children hatred of England, and they are fed\r\nwith lies from their very cradle. Every misfortune--the dirt, the\r\nrags, the poverty of the country, are all to be attributed to English\r\nrule. Take away that and the people believe they will live in laziness\r\ncombined with luxury.\"\r\n\r\nThe lying of the Home Rulers is indeed unscrupulous. An Irish\r\nnewspaper of to-day's date, speaking of the opening of the Chicago\r\nExposition, says that \"it is fitting to remember that our countrymen\r\nhave in the United States found an asylum and an opportunity which\r\nthey have never found at home, that there they have been allowed\r\nuntrammelled to worship God as they thought right,\" clearly implying\r\nthat in Ireland or in England they have no such liberty. A car driver\r\nof Limerick, one Hynes, a total abstainer, and a person of some\r\nintelligence, firmly believed that England prevented Ireland from\r\nmining for coal, which disability, with the resulting poverty, would\r\ndisappear with the granting of Home Rule. Everywhere this patent\r\nobliqueness and absurd unreason. A fiery Nationalist in white heat of\r\ndebate shook his fist at an Ulsterman, and said, \"When we get the\r\nbill, you'll not be allowed to have all the manufactories to\r\nyourselves,\" an extraordinary outburst which requires no comment. This\r\nburning patriot looked around and said, with the air of a man who is\r\nposing his adversary, \"Why should they have all the big works in one\r\ncorner of the island?\" In opposition to the melancholy carman was the\r\ndictum of Mr. Gallagher, the great high-priest of Kennedy's tobaccos.\r\nHe said--\r\n\r\n\"The poverty of Ireland is due to the fact that she has no coal.\r\nGeologists say that tens of thousands of years ago a great ice-drift\r\ncarried away all the coal-depositing strata.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another injustice to Ireland,\" interrupted a sacrilegious Unionist.\r\n\r\n\"And doubtless due to the baleful machinations of the Base and Bloody\r\nBalfour,\" said another.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to bear other people's troubles. He jests at scars who\r\nnever felt a wound. That the Irish nation has untold wrongs to bear is\r\nevidenced by a Southern Irish paper, which excitedly narrates the\r\ninjuries heaped on the holy head of Hibernia by the scoffing Yankee,\r\nthe wrongful possessor of the American soil. A meeting of\r\ndistinguished Irish emigrants, who have from time to time favoured\r\nthe States with their notice, was recently convened in New York, not\r\non this exceptional occasion to metaphorically devour the succulent\r\nSaxon, nor to send his enemies a dollar for bread, and ten dollars for\r\nlead, nor yet to urge the Gotham nurses and scullerymaids to further\r\ncontributions in favour of patriot Parliamentarians, but to protest\r\nwith all the fervour of the conveners' souls, with all the eloquence\r\nof their powerful intellects, with all the solemnity of a sacred deed,\r\nagainst the irreverent naming of the animals in the Central Park\r\nZoological Gardens after Irish ladies, Irish gentlemen, Irish saints.\r\nMisther Daniel O'Shea, of County Kerry, stated that the great\r\nhippotamus had actually been named Miss Murphy! A hijeous baste from a\r\ndissolute counthry inhabited wid black nagurs, to be named after an\r\nOirish gyurl! Mr. O'Shea uncorked the vials of his wrath, and poured\r\nout his anger with a bubble, the meeting palpitating with hair-raising\r\nhorror. Some other animal was called Miss Bridget. And Bridget was the\r\nname iv an Oirish saint! This must be shtopped. Mr. O'Shea declared he\r\nwould rather die than allow it to continue. No further particulars are\r\ngiven, but it is understood that the viper had been christened \"Tim\r\nHealy,\" the rattlesnake \"O'Brien,\" the laughing hyæna John Dillon, and\r\nso on. The Chairman wanted to know why the Yankees did not call the\r\nugly brutes after Lord Salisbury and Colonel Saunderson? Nobody seemed\r\nto know, so eight remonstrants were appointed a committee of inquiry.\r\n\r\nMr. O'Shea also denounced the American people as unlawfully holding a\r\ncountry which properly belonged to the Irish, an Irish saint, St.\r\nBrengan, having discovered the New World in the _sixteenth_ century!\r\n\r\nEnough of Ireland's wrongs; there is no end to them. As one of her\r\npoets sings, \"The cup of her bitterness long has overflowed, And still\r\nit is not full.\"\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the intelligent people of Ireland regard Home Rule\r\nwith dread, and this feeling grows ever deeper and stronger. The\r\ncountry is at present exploited by adventurers, paid by the enemies of\r\nEngland, themselves animated by racial and religious prejudices,\r\nwilling to serve their paymasters and deserve their pay rather by\r\ndamaging England than by benefiting Ireland, for whose interests they\r\ncare not one straw. Ignorance manipulated by charlatanism and bigotry\r\nis, in these latter days, the determining factor in the destinies of\r\nthe British Empire. Intelligence is dominated by terrorism, by threats\r\nof death, of ill-usage, of boycotting--the latter I am told an outcome\r\nof an old engine of the Roman Catholic Church, improved and brought up\r\nto date. Humphreys, of Tipperary, may know if this is true. It was\r\nfrom one of the \"Father's\" feculent family, in the heart of his own\r\nputrescent parish, that I heard of the local chemist who dare not\r\nsupply medicine urgently needed by a boycotted person, who was\r\nsuspected of entertaining what the learned Humphreys would spell as\r\n\"Brittish\" sympathies.\r\n\r\nGort (Co. Galway), May 6th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 19.--INDOLENCE AND IMPROVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. James Dunne, of Athenry, is an acute observer and a shrewd\r\npolitical controversialist. He said: \"The people about here, the poor\r\nfolks such as the small farmers and labourers, have really no opinion\r\nat all. They know nothing of Home Rule, one way or the other. If they\r\nsay anything, it is to the effect that they will obtain some advantage\r\nin connection with the land. Beyond that they care nothing for the\r\nmatter. Not one has any sentiment to be gratified. They only want to\r\nlive, if possible, a bit more easily. If they can get the land for\r\nnothing or even more cheaply, then Home Rule is good. They can see no\r\nfurther than their noses, and they cannot be expected to follow a long\r\nchain of argument. They believe just what they are told. Yes, they go\r\nto the priest for advice under all circumstances. They ask him to name\r\nthe man for whom they are to vote, or rather they would ask him if he\r\nwaited long enough. They vote as they are told; and as the Catholic\r\npriest believes that the Catholic religion is the most important thing\r\nin the world, which from his point of view is quite proper and right,\r\nhe naturally influences his people in the direction which is most\r\nlikely to propagate the true faith, and give to it the predominance\r\nwhich he believes to be its rightful due.\r\n\r\n\"The people round here are harmless, and will continue so, unless the\r\nagitators get hold of them. They are ignorant, and easily led, and an\r\ninfluential speaker who knew their simplicity could make them do\r\nanything, no matter what. No, I couldn't say that they are\r\nindustrious. They do not work hard. They just go along, go along,\r\nlike. They have no enterprise at all, and you couldn't get them out of\r\nthe ways of their fathers. They'd think it a positive sin.\r\n\r\n\"Look at the present fine weather. This is a very early season. No\r\nliving man has seen such a spring-time in Ireland. Two months of fine\r\nwarm weather, the ground in fine working condition, everything six\r\nweeks before last year. Not a man that started to dig a day earlier.\r\nNo, the old time will be adhered to just as if it was cold and wet and\r\nfreezing. You could not stir them with an electric battery. They moon,\r\nmoon, moon along, in the old, old, old way, waiting for somebody to\r\ncome and do something for them.\r\n\r\n\"If they had the land for nothing they would be no better off. They\r\nwould just do that much less work. They live from hand to mouth. They\r\nhave no ambition. The same thing that did for their fathers will do\r\nfor them, the same dirtiness, the same inconvenience. If their father\r\nwent three miles round a stone wall to get in at a gate they'll do it\r\ntoo. Never would they think of making another gate. They turn round\r\nangrily and say, 'Wasn't it good enough for my father, an' wasn't he a\r\nbetther man than ayther me or you?' If you lived here, you would at\r\nfirst begin to show them things, but when you saw how much better\r\nthey like their own way you'd stop it. You'd very soon get your heart\r\nbroke. You couldn't stir them an inch in a thousand years. What will\r\nHome Rule do for them? Nobody knows but Gladstone and the Divil.\"\r\n\r\nA bystander said: \"Down at Galway there was a man wid a donkey goin'\r\nabout sellin' fish, which was carried in two panniers. Whin he had\r\nonly enough to fill one pannier, he put a load o' stones into the\r\nother pannier to balance the fish an' make the panniers stick on, an'\r\nride aisier.\r\n\r\n\"Well, one day an Englishman that had been watchin' Barney for some\r\ntime comes up to him an' he says, says he--\r\n\r\n\"'Whin ye have only fish for one pannier why do ye fill up the other\r\nwid stones off the beach?' says he.\r\n\r\n\"'Sure, 'tis to balance it,' says Barney, mighty surprised an' laffin\r\nwidin himself at the Englishman's ignorance. 'Sure,' says Barney, 'ye\r\nwouldn't have a cock-eyed load on the baste, all swingin' on one side,\r\nlike a pig wid one ear, would ye?' says he.\r\n\r\n\"But this Englishman was one of thim stiff sort that doesn't know whin\r\nhe's bate, an' he went on arguin'. Says he--\r\n\r\n\"'But couldn't you put the half of the fish in one pannier, and the\r\nother half in the other pannier, instead of putting all the fish in\r\none, and filling up the other with stones?' says he. 'Wouldn't that\r\nbalance the load?' says he. 'And wouldn't that be only half the load\r\nfor the poor baste?' says he. An' Barney sthruggled a bit till he got\r\na fair grip iv it, d'ye see, but by the sivin pipers that played\r\nbefore Moses, he couldn't see the way to answer this big word of the\r\nEnglishman; so he says, says he, 'Musha, 'twas me father's way, rest\r\nhis sowl,' says he. 'An' would I be settin' meself up to be bettherin'\r\nhis larnin'?' says he. 'Not one o' me would show him sich impidence\r\nand disrespect,' says he. 'An' I'll carry the rocks till I die, glory\r\nbe to God,' says he.\r\n\r\n\"Now what could ye do with the like iv _him_?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Armour, who lived five years near Sligo, said:--\"The Connaught\r\nfolks have no idea of preparing for to-morrow. They are almost\r\nentirely destitute of self-reliance. So long as they can carry on from\r\none day to another they are quite content. The bit of ground they live\r\non is not half cultivated. In the summer time you may see two or even\r\nthree crops growing up together. If they had potatoes on last, they\r\ngot them up in the most slovenly way, leaving half the crop in the\r\nground. They just hoak out with a stick or a bit of board what they\r\nrequire for that day's food, picking the large ones and leaving the\r\nsmall ones in the ground. Oats or something else will be seen\r\nhalf-choked with weeds and the growth from the potatoes so left. The\r\nslovenliness of these people is most exasperating. Of course they are\r\nall Home Rulers in effect, though not in theory. By that I mean that\r\nthey have no politics, except to produce politicians by their votes.\r\nThey know no more of Home Rule than they know of Heidsieck's\r\nchampagne, or Christmas strawberries, or soap and water, or any other\r\nunknown commodity. They are precisely where their ancestors were,\r\nexcept for the crop of potatoes, which enables them to exist in\r\ngreater luxury and with less trouble. Their way is to plant the\r\npotatoes, dig them as required, and live on them either with the aid\r\nof a cow or with the butter-milk of a neighbour who has a cow. No\r\nprovision for the future is attempted, because the relatives are sure\r\nto provide for the worn-out and sickly. That shows their\r\ngoodheartedness, but it does away with self-dependence. There are some\r\nthings so deeply ingrained in the Irish character that nothing and\r\nnobody can touch them. The very priests themselves cannot move them.\r\nAlthough these people believe that the priests could set them on fire\r\nfrom head to heel, or strike them paralytic, or refuse them entrance\r\ninto heaven, yet the force of habit is so great, and the dread of\r\npublic opinion is so powerful, that the people, so long as they remain\r\nin Ireland, will never depart a hair's-breadth from the old ways.\"\r\n\r\nA woman who washed and tidied her children would be a mark for every\r\nbitter tongue in the parish. A striking case came under my own\r\nobservation. A woman of the place was speaking most bitterly of\r\nanother, and she finished up with,--\r\n\r\n\"She's the lady all out, niver fear. Shure, she washes and dhresses\r\nthe childer ivery mornin', and turns out the girls wid hats on their\r\nheads an' shoes on their feet. Divil a less would sarve her turn! She\r\nhas a brick flure to her house, an' she washes it--divil a lie I tell\r\nye--she washes it--wid wather--an' wid soap an' wather, ivery\r\nSattherday in the week! The saints betune us an' harm, but all she\r\nwants now is to turn Protestant altogether!\"\r\n\r\nFour miles away is the village of Carnaun, and there I met Philip\r\nFahy, with his son Michael, and another young fellow, all three\r\nreturning from field work, wearily toiling along the rocky road which\r\nruns through the estate of Major Lobdell. The party stopped and sat\r\ndown to smoke with me. The senior took the lead, not with a brogue but\r\nwith an accent, translating from the Irish vernacular as he went on.\r\n\"Long ye may live! We're glad we met ye, thanks be to God. Yer\r\nhonner's glory is the foinest, splindidist man I seen this twinty\r\nyear. May God protect ye! 'Tis weary work we does. That foine, big boy\r\nye see foreninst ye, has eighteenpence a day, nine shillin' a week.\r\n'Tis not enough to support him properly. I have a son in England, the\r\ncliverist lad ye seen this many a day. Sich a scholar, 'twould be no\r\ndiscredit to have the Queen for his aunt, no it wouldn't. No, he's\r\nonly just gone, an' I didn't hear from him yet. I didn't tell ye where\r\nhe'd be, for I wouldn't know meself. But me other boys is goin', for\r\nthey tell me things will be afther getting worse. God help us, an'\r\nstand betune us an harm! Did ye hear of the Home Rule Bill? What does\r\nit mane at all, at all? Not one of us knows, more than that lump of\r\nstone ye sit on. Will it give us the land for nothin'? for that's all\r\nwe hear. We'd be obliged av ye could axplain it a thrifle, for sorra\r\na one but's bad off, an' Father O'Baithershin says, Howld yer whist,\r\nsays he, till ye see what'll happen, says he. Will we get the bit o'\r\nground without rint, yer honner's glory?\"\r\n\r\nPhilip was dressed for agricultural work in the following style, which\r\nis clearly considered the correct thing in Galway. One tall \"top-hat,\"\r\nwith a long fur like that of a mangy rabbit, waving to the jocund\r\nzephyrs of Carnaun; one cut-away coat of very thick homespun cloth,\r\nhaving five brass buttons on each breast; breeches and leggings and\r\nstout boots completed the outfit, which fitted like a sentry-box, and\r\nbore a curiously caricatured resemblance to the Court suit of a\r\nCabinet Minister in full war-paint. The spades with which the\r\nlabourers till the ground are strange to the English eye, and seem\r\ncalculated to get through the smallest amount of work with the\r\ngreatest amount of labour. That they were spades at all was more than\r\nI could make out. \"What are those implements?\" I asked, to which the\r\nanswer came, \"Have ye no shpades in England thin!\"\r\n\r\nThe business end is about two feet long and not more than three inches\r\nbroad, with a sort of shoulder for the foot. The handles are about six\r\nfeet long and end like a mop-stick, without any crossbar. A slight\r\nalteration would turn these tools into pikes, a much more likely\r\noperation than the beating of swords into plough-shares and spears\r\ninto pruning-hooks. Meanwhile the length of the handle keeps the\r\nworker from too dangerous proximity to his work. There is a broader\r\npattern of blade, but the handle is always of the same sanitary\r\nlength. The children of the soil turn it over at a wholesome distance.\r\nThey keep six feet of pole between the earth and their nobility. Small\r\nblame to them for that same! Shure the wuruld will be afther thim.\r\nShure there's no sinse at all, at all, in workin' life out to kape\r\nlife in.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, no,\" said Misther Fahy. \"That tobacky has no strinth in it. We\r\nget no satisfaction out iv it. We shmoked a pipe iv it to make frinds,\r\nbut we'd not shmoke another. 'Tis like chopped hay or tay-leaves, it\r\nis. Will we walk back wid yer honner's glory? 'Tis only four miles, it\r\nis. No, we bur-rn no powdher here. But on the other side, above\r\nAthenry, 'tis there ye'll see the foin shootin'. Thims the boys for\r\npowdher an' shot! 'Tis more than nine they shot, aye, and more than\r\ntin it was. An' sarve thim right, if they must turn the people out,\r\nan' have their own way. May the Lord protect ye! May angels make yer\r\nbed this night! Long may ye live, an' yer sowl to glory!\"\r\n\r\nI had written so far, when glancing through the window, I saw a\r\nfamiliar form, a rosy, healthy, florid gentleman parading on the lawn\r\nwhich fronts the Railway Hotel, puffing a cigarette, briskly turning\r\nand returning with something of the motion of a captive lion. I knew\r\nthat pinky cheek, I knew that bright blue eye; yet here, in the wilds\r\nof Galway who could it be? He plays with two sportive spaniels, and\r\ncries \"Down, Sir, down.\" Thy voice bewrayeth thee, member for North\r\nGalway! The Parnellitic Colonel Nolan, thou, _in propriâ personâ_.\r\nWhat makes he here? When the great Bill impends, why flee the festive\r\nscene? I'll speak a little with this learned Theban. I board him, as\r\nthe French say. For a moment he regards me with suspicion--with a kind\r\nof vade-in-retro-Satanas air--but presently he goes ahead. A fair at\r\nTuam, which he never misses. Has paired with somebody, Pierpoint he\r\nthinks is the name. His vote will therefore not be lost to his side.\r\n\"Nothing will now be done before Whitsuntide. Both parties will be on\r\ntheir best behaviour. The Conservatives and obstruction, the Liberals\r\nand closure. Strategy to obtain some show of advantage at the recess\r\nis now the little game. Knows not what will happen _re_ Home Rule. The\r\nEnglish Liberals not now so confident as they were. The Government may\r\nbe ruined by liquor. 'Tis the fate of Liberal Governments to be ruined\r\nby drink. The Government of 1874 and the next Liberal Cabinet went to\r\nthe dogs on liquor. And if the English people are called upon to give\r\na verdict on a local option bill, the result is rather uncertain.\r\nChances perhaps against Mr. Gladstone. The Home Rule question is now\r\nquite worked up. The English people are now satisfied to have Home\r\nRule, but some intervening question might delay its final settlement.\r\nNo, the agitation of the past four or five months had not changed the\r\nposition one bit. No amount of agitation would now make any difference\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the probable wrecking of the Gladstonian Cabinet on \"liquor\" to\r\nthe question of Customs, or, as Colonel Nolan preferred to call it, of\r\nExcise, was but an easy step. By a simple _adagio_ movement I\r\nmodulated into the Customs question, mentioning the opinion given to\r\nme by Mr. John Jameson himself. The Colonel did not deny, nor admit,\r\nthat the Irish people were excellent smugglers, but thought the fears\r\nof the Unionists exaggerated. He was well aware that smuggling might\r\nbe carried on--say, on the coast of Connemara and elsewhere, where\r\nwere roads and bays and natural harbours galore, with a wild and\r\nlonely shore far from the centres of Government. Probably at first\r\nsome money might be lost that way; some little chinks would doubtless\r\nbe found; there would be some little leakage. But suppose an initial\r\nloss of £100,000 or £200,000, it was not likely that such a state of\r\nthings would be allowed to continue. As to the argument that the rural\r\npolice would not then assist the 1,300 coastguards, who with the\r\npolice have been sufficient, there was little or no solidity in this\r\nassumption. The Irish Parliament would order the police to assist, and\r\nif they did not execute their orders, or if they allowed themselves to\r\nbe bribed, and the Irish Parliament did not prosecute them for\r\naccepting bribes, then the English Government would step in and put\r\nmatters right. This is just a typical Home Rule argument, the\r\nconfidence trick all over. The Colonel thought that after a certain\r\namount of shaking down, everything would work sweetly enough. He said\r\nnothing about the Union of Hearts, nor have I yet heard the phrase\r\nfrom an Irishman.\r\n\r\nA keen observer resident at the Athenry Hotel says:--\"Of those who\r\ncome here the proportion against Home Rule is not less than twenty to\r\none. Now mark my figures, because they are based on careful notes\r\nextending over the last six months. When you have all the money in the\r\ncountry, and all the best brains in the country, against the bill,\r\nwhat good could the bill do if it became law? And while I can see, and\r\nall these people can see, no end of risk, disturbance, upset, loss,\r\nruin, and everything that is bad, we cannot see anything at all to\r\ncompensate for the risk. Nobody can put his finger on anything and\r\nsay, 'There, that's the advantage we'll get from the bill.' 'Tis all\r\nfancy, pure fancy. Ireland a nation, and a Roman Catholic nation, is\r\nthe cry. We may get that, but we'll be bankrupt next day. 'Tis like\r\nputting a poor man in a grand house without food, furniture, or money,\r\nand without credit to raise anything on the building. There now, ye\r\nmight say, ye have a splendid place that's all your own. But wouldn't\r\nthe poor man have to leave it, or die of starvation? Of course I wish\r\nto respect my clergy, but I think they should not interfere with\r\npolitics.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Nolan said to me: \"The priests wield an immense, an\r\nincalculable power. All are on the same path, all hammer away at the\r\none point. It is the persistency, the organisation, that tells. In\r\nsome cases they have been known to preach for a year and a half at a\r\nstretch on political subjects. What is going to stand against that?\"\r\n\r\nWith these golden words I close my letter. The priest holds the\r\nsceptre of the British Empire. Circumstances have placed in his hands\r\nan astonishing opportunity. Nearly every priest in Ireland is using\r\nhis supernatural credit with one solitary aim. We know their\r\ndisloyalty, we know they are no friends of England--we know their\r\ninfluence, their organisation, their perseverance, their\r\nunscrupulousness, their absolute supremacy in Ireland--and it is high\r\ntime that England asked herself, in the words of Colonel Nolan--\r\n\r\n    \"What is going to stand against that?\"\r\n\r\nAthenry (Co. Galway), May 6th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 20.--RELIGION AT THE BOTTOM OF THE IRISH QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTuam has two cathedrals but no barber. You may be shriven but you\r\ncannot be shaved. You may be whitewashed but you cannot be lathered.\r\n\"One shaves another; we're neighbourly here,\" said a railway porter.\r\nThey cut each other's hair by the light of nature, in the open street,\r\nwith a chorus of bystanders. The Tuamites live in a country of\r\nantiquities, but they have no photographer. Nor could I find a\r\nphotograph for sale. The people are sweetly unsophisticated. A\r\nbare-footed old lady sat on the step of the Victoria Hotel, sucking a\r\nblack dhudeen, sending out smoke like a factory chimney, the picture\r\nof innocent enjoyment. The streets were full of pigs from the rural\r\nparts, and great was the bargaining and chaffering in Irish, a\r\nlanguage which seemed to be composed of rolling r's and booming\r\ngutturals. A sustained conversation sounds like the jolting of a\r\ncountry cart over a rocky road, a sudden exclamation like the whirr of\r\na covey of partridges, an oath like the downfall of a truck-load of\r\nbricks. I arrived in time for the great pig fair, and Tuam was very\r\nbusy. It is a poor town, of which the staple trade is religion. The\r\ncountry around is green and beautiful, with brilliant patches of gorse\r\nin full bloom, every bush a solid mass of brightest yellow, dazzling\r\nyou in the sunshine. Many of the streets are wretchedly built, and the\r\nGalway Road shows how easily the Catholic poor are satisfied. Not only\r\nare the cabins in this district aboriginal in build, but they are also\r\nindescribably filthy, and the condition of the inmates, like that of\r\nthe people inhabiting the poorer parts of Limerick, is no whit higher\r\nthan that obtaining in the wigwams of the native Americans. The hooded\r\nwomen, black-haired and bare-footed, bronzed and tanned by constant\r\nexposure, are wonderfully like the squaws brought from the Far West by\r\nBuffalo Bill. The men look more civilised, and the pig-jobbers, with\r\ntheir tall hats, dress coats, and knotty shillelaghs, were the pink of\r\npropriety. Now and then a burst of wild excitement would attract the\r\nstranger, who would hurry up to see the coming homicide, but there was\r\nno manslaughter that I could see. A scene of frantic gesticulation\r\nnear the Town Hall promised well, but contrary to expectation, there\r\nwas no murder done. Two wild-eyed men, apparently breathing slaughter,\r\nsuddenly desisted, reining in their fury and walking off amicably\r\ntogether. An Irish-speaking policeman explained that one having sold\r\nthe other a pig the buyer was asking for twopence off, and that they\r\nnow departed to drink the amount between them. People who had done\r\ntheir business went away in queer carts made to carry turf--little\r\nthings with sides like garden palings four or five feet high. Three or\r\nfour men would squat on one, closely packed, looking through the bars\r\nlike fowls in a hen-coop. The donkeys who drew these chariots had all\r\ntheir work cut out, and most of their backs cut up. The drivers laid\r\non with stout ash-plants, sparing no exertion to create the donkey's\r\nenthusiasm. Prices ruled low. \"'Tis not afther sellin' thim I am,\"\r\nsaid a peasant who had got rid of his pigs, \"'tis bestowin' thim I\r\nwas, the craythurs. The counthry is ruinated intirely, an' so it is.\r\nBy the holy poker of Methesulum, the prices we got this day for\r\nlowness bangs Banagher, an' Banagher bangs the divil.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tuamites spare a little time for politics and boycotting. The\r\npublic spirit and contempt for British law are all that could be\r\ndesired by Irish patriotism. Mr. Strachan has recently bought some\r\nland. The previous owner, Mr. Dominick Leonard, brother of Dr. Leonard\r\nof Athenry, and of Judge Leonard of London, had raised money on the\r\nproperty, and failed to pay interest or principal. An English\r\ninsurance company determined to realize, and the affair went into the\r\nLand Court, Mr. Strachan buying part of the estate for £2,765. It was\r\neasy enough to buy, and even to pay, but to get possession was quite\r\nanother thing. Precise information is difficult to get, for while some\r\ndecline to say a word, others are mutually contradictory, and a State\r\nCommission would hardly sift truth from the confusing mass of details,\r\ndenials, assertions, and counter-assertions. This much is clear\r\nenough. A tenant named Ruane was required to leave a house, with\r\nground, which he had held on the estate bought by Mr. Strachan. He had\r\npaid no rent for a long time. Of course he refused to leave, and, a\r\ndecree having been obtained, he was duly evicted. But, as Lady de\r\nBurgho said, evictions do no good. When the officers of the law went\r\nhome to tea, Mr. Ruane went home also, breaking the locks, forcing the\r\ndoors, reinstating himself and his furniture, planting his Lares and\r\nPenates in their old situations, hanging up his caubeen on the\r\nancestral nail, and crossing his patriotic shin-bones on the familiar\r\nhearth. Pulled up for trespass, he declared that if sent to prison\r\nfifty times he would still return to the darling spot, and defied the\r\nBritish army and navy--horse, foot, and artillery--ironclads, marines,\r\nand 100-ton guns, to keep him out. For three acts of trespass he got\r\nthree weeks imprisonment. The moment he was released Mr. Ruane walked\r\nback home, and took possession once again. There he is now, laughing\r\nat the Empire on which the sun never sets. When a certain bishop read\r\n\"Paradise Lost\" to a sporting lord, the impatient auditor's attention\r\nwas arrested by some bold speech of Satan, whereupon he exclaimed\r\n\"Dang me, if I don't back that chap. I like his pluck, and I hope\r\nhe'll win.\" Something like this might be said of Ruane.\r\n\r\nAnd Ruane will stick to his land. A public meeting held on Sunday week\r\ndetermined to support him, and to show forth its mind by planting the\r\nground for him. Mr. Strachan seems to have seen the futility of\r\nlooking to the law, on the security of which he invested his money.\r\nToo late he finds that his savings are not safe, and he endeavours to\r\nmake friends with the mammon of unrighteousness. He has offered Ruane\r\nfive acres of land and a house, and Ruane would have accepted with\r\nthanks had he been allowed. But he went to a meeting in some outlying\r\nvillage, and received his orders from the Land League. For, be it\r\nobserved, that the people of these parts speak of the Land League as\r\nexisting in full force. Ruane declined the handsome offer of the\r\nkind-hearted Strachan. Ruane will hold the house and land from which\r\nhe has been evicted, _because_ he had been evicted, and that the\r\npeople may see that they have the mastery. Ruane would prefer the\r\nproffered land, but private interests must give way to the public\r\nweal. England must be smashed, treated with contumely; her laws, her\r\nofficers, her edicts treated with contempt, laughed at by every naked\r\ngutter-snipe, rendered null and void. That this can be done with\r\nperfect impunity is the teaching of priests, Fenians, Nationalists,\r\nFederationists--call them what you will--all alike flagrantly disloyal\r\nto the English Crown. Not worth while to differentiate them. As the\r\nsailor said of crocodiles and alligators, \"There's no difference at\r\nall. They're all tarnation varmint together.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Strachan is boycotted, and goes about with a guard of three\r\npolicemen. What will happen from one day to another nobody can tell.\r\nSince I last mentioned Mr. Blood, of Ennis, that most estimable\r\ngentleman has been again fired on, this time at a range of 400 yards,\r\nand when guarded by the four policemen who accompany him everywhere.\r\nThree shots were fired, and the police found an empty rifle cartridge\r\nat the firing point. A Protestant in Tuam said to me:--\r\n\r\n\"Home Rule would mean that every Protestant would have to fly the\r\ncountry. Why should there not be a return to the persecutions of years\r\nago? When first I came to the place the Protestants were hooted as\r\nthey went to church, and I can remember seeing this very Strachan\r\ngoing to worship on Sunday morning, his black go-to-meeting coat so\r\ncovered with the spittle of the mob that you would not know him. His\r\nwife would come down with a Bible, and the children would run along\r\nshouting 'Here comes mother Strachan, with the devil in her fist.'\r\nWhy, the young men got cows' horns and fixed them up with strings, so\r\nthat they could tie them on their foreheads. Then with these horns on\r\nthey would walk before and behind the Protestants as they went to\r\nchurch or left it, to show that the devil was accompanying them. They\r\nalways figure the devil as being horned. One of the little barefooted\r\nboys who ran after these Protestants is now a holy priest in Tuam. And\r\nwhat the people were then, so they will be now, once they get the\r\nupper hand. The educated Catholics are excellent people, none better\r\nanywhere, none more tolerant. Nothing to fear from them. But how many\r\nare there? Look at the masses of ignorant people around us. The\r\ndensity of their ignorance is something that the people of England\r\ncannot understand. They have no examples of it. The most stupid and\r\nuninformed English you can find have some ray of enlightenment. These\r\npeople are steeped in ignorance and superstition. Their religion is\r\nnothing but fetichism. Their politics? well, they are blind tools of\r\nthe priests: what else can be said? And the priests have but one\r\nobject. In all times, in all countries, the Roman Catholic Church has\r\naimed at absolute dominion. The religious question is at the bottom of\r\nit all.\"\r\n\r\nNo matter where an educated Irishman begins, that is where he always\r\nends. Catholics and Protestants alike come round to the same point at\r\nlast, though with evident reluctance. The Protestant Unionists\r\nespecially avoid all mention of religion as long as possible. They\r\nknow the credal argument excites suspicion. They attack Home Rule from\r\nevery other point of view, and sometimes you think you have\r\nencountered a person of different opinion. Wait till he knows you a\r\nlittle better, has more confidence in your fairness, stands in less\r\nfear of a possible snub. Sooner or later, sure as the night follows\r\nthe day, he is bound to say--\r\n\r\n\"The religious question is at the bottom of it all.\"\r\n\r\nThe people of Ireland do not want an Irish Parliament, and the failure\r\nof the bill would not trouble them in the least. They do not care a\r\nbrass farthing for the bill one way or the other. The great heart of\r\nthe people is untouched. The masses know nothing of it, and will not\r\nfeel its loss. They are in the hands of priests and agitators, these\r\npoor unlettered peasants, and their blind voting, their inarticulate\r\nvoice, translated into menace and mock patriotism. Everybody admits\r\nthat the people would be happy and content if only left alone.\r\nHalf-a-dozen ruffians with rifles can boss a whole country side, and\r\nthe people must do as they are told. They do not believe in the\r\nsecrecy of the ballot. They believe that the priests by their\r\nsupernatural powers are able to know how everybody voted, and I am\r\nassured on highly respectable authority that the secrecy of the ballot\r\nin Ireland is, in some parts, a questionable point. At the same time,\r\nthere is everywhere a strong opinion that another election will give\r\nvery different results in Ireland. And everywhere there is a growing\r\nfeeling that the Bill will not become law. This explains the slight\r\nrise in the value of Irish securities.\r\n\r\nJust outside Tuam I came upon a neatly built, deep-thatched villa,\r\nwith a flower garden in front, a carefully cultivated kitchen garden\r\nrunning along the road, trim hedges, smart white palings, an orchard\r\nof fine young trees, a general air of neatness, industry, prosperity,\r\nwhich, under the circumstances, was positively staggering. I had\r\npassed along a mile of cabins in every stage of ruin, from the\r\nsolitary chimney still standing to the more recent ruin with two\r\ngables, from the inhabited pig-sty to the hut whereon grew crops of\r\nlong grass. I had noted the old lady clad in sackcloth and ashes, who,\r\nhaving invested the combined riches of the neighbourhood in six\r\noranges and a bottle of pop, was sitting on the ground, alternately\r\ncontemplating the three-legged stool which held the locked-up capital\r\nand her own sooty toes, immersed in melancholy reflections anent the\r\npresent depression in commercial circles. The Paradisaic cottage was\r\nstartling after this. I stopped a bare-legged boy, and found that the\r\nplace belonged to a Black Protestant, and, what was worse, a\r\nPresbyterian, and, what was superlatively bad, a Scots Presbyterian.\r\nPresently I met a tweed-clad form, red-faced and huge of shoulder,\r\nfull of strange accents and bearded like the pard. Berwickshire gave\r\nhim birth, but he has \"done time\" in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\"I'm transported this forty-three years. I thought I'd end my days\r\nhere, but if this bill passes we'll go back to Scotland. We'll have\r\nCatholic governors, and they'll do what they like with us. Ye'll have\r\na tangled web to weave, over the Channel there. Ye'll have the whole\r\nisland in rebellion in five-and-twenty minutes after ye give them\r\npower. Anybody that thinks otherwise is either very ignorant of the\r\nstate of things or else he's a born fule. No, I wouldn't say the folks\r\nare all out that lazy, not in this part of Galway. They will work weel\r\nenough for a Scots steward, or for an Englishman. But no Irish steward\r\ncan manage them. Anybody will tell you that. No-one in any part of the\r\ncountry will say any different. Now, that's a queer thing. An Irish\r\nsteward has no control over them. They don't care for him. And he runs\r\nmore risk of shooting than an English or Scots steward.\r\n\r\n\"There was an Irish bailiff where I was steward, and he saw how I\r\nmanaged the men, and thought he'd do it the same way. So once when he\r\nand a lot of diggers went in for the praties and buttermilk, the\r\npraties were not ready, and he gives the fellow who was responsible a\r\nbit of a kick behind with the side of his foot, like.\r\n\r\n\"The very next night he got six slugs in his head and face and one of\r\nhis front teeth knocked out. That taught him to leave kicking to\r\nforeigners. Once two men were speaking of me. I overheard one say,\r\n'Ah, now, Micky, an' isn't it a pity that Palmer's a Black Protestant,\r\nan' that his sowl will blaze in hell for ever, like a tur-rf soddock\r\nye'd pick up in the bog?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Settle the land question and you settle Home Rule. The bad times made\r\nParnell's success. He was backed by the low prices of produce, and the\r\ngeneral depression of agricultural interests. The rent has been\r\nreduced, but not enough to compensate the drop in the prices of\r\nproduce. Why, cattle have been fetching one-half what they fetched a\r\nshort time ago. Potatoes are twopence-halfpenny a stone! Did you ever\r\nhear of such a thing? Yes, it enables the people to live very cheaply,\r\nbut how about the growers? If every man grew his own potatoes and\r\nlived on them, well and good, but he must have no rent to pay. That\r\nprice would not pay for labour and manure. Oats are worth sixpence to\r\nninepence a stone,--a ridiculous price; and we have not yet touched\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\n\"The land question should be settled. No, it is not satisfactory.\r\nPeople have to wait seven years for a settlement, and meanwhile they\r\ncould be kicked out of their holdings at one day's notice. The people\r\nwho bought under Ashbourne's Act are happy, prosperous, and contented.\r\nThe people who are beside them are the contrary. Home Rulers, bosh!\r\nFarmers know as much about Home Rule as a pig knows about the Sabbath\r\nDay. The land, the land, the land! Let the Tories take this up and\r\ndish the Liberals. Easiest thing alive. How? Compulsory sale,\r\ncompulsory purchase. Leave nothing to either party. Then you'll hear\r\nno more of Home Rule. Let the Unionists hold their ground a bit, till\r\nit dies out, or until the rival factious destroy each other. Loyalty?\r\nWhy those Nationalist members have themselves told you over and over\r\nagain that they are rebels. Don't you believe them? Some few may be\r\ninspired with the idea that the thing is impracticable, but they will\r\nall preach separation when the right time comes. 'Pay no taxes to\r\nEngland,' they'll cry. The people can follow that. Tell them that any\r\ncourse of action means non-payment of anything, and they're on it like\r\na shot. Why, the Paying of Tribute to England is already discussed in\r\nevery whiskey shop in Galway, and every man is prepared to line the\r\nditches with guns and pikes rather than pay one copper. When you can't\r\ngive Strachan the farm for which he paid last February, when you can't\r\nkeep a small farmer who won't pay rent from occupying his farm and\r\ngetting his crops as usual, for he _will_ do so, how are you going to\r\nraise the famous Tribute Money?\"\r\n\r\nNear the Town Hall was a great crowd of people listening to a couple\r\nof minstrels who chanted alternate lines of a modernised version of\r\nthe _Shan van vocht_. \"Let me make the songs of a people, and I care\r\nnot who makes its laws.\" Mr. Gladstone is appreciated now. The heart\r\nof the Connaughtman throbs responsive to his pet appellation. This is\r\npart of the song--\r\n\r\n    Oi'm goin' across the say, says the Grand Old Man,\r\n    Oi'll be back some other day, says the Grand Old Man;\r\n              When Oireland gets fair play\r\n              We'll make Balfour rue the day,--\r\n    Remimber what I say, says the Grand Old Man.\r\n    Whin will ye come back? says the Grand Old Man,\r\n    Whin will ye come back? says the Grand Old Man,\r\n              Whin Balfour gets the sack\r\n              Wid Salisbury on his back,\r\n    Or unto hell does pack, says the Grand Old Man.\r\n    Will ye deny the Lague? says the Grand Old Man,\r\n    No, we'll continue to the Lague, says the Grand Old Man.\r\n              John Dillon says at every station,\r\n              'Twill be his conversation\r\n    Till Oireland is a nation, says the Grand Old Man.\r\n\r\nThere are three more verses of this immortal strain. The _Shan van\r\nvocht_ was the great song of the '98 rebellion, and possibly the\r\nG.O.M.'s happy adaptability to the music may put the finishing touch\r\nto his world-wide renown. Other songs referred to the arrest of Father\r\nKeller, of Youghal. \"They gathered in their thousands their grief for\r\nto revale, An' mourn for their holy praste all in Kilmainham Jail.\"\r\nThese ballads are anonymous, but the talented author of \"Dirty little\r\nEngland\" stands revealed by internal evidence. The voices which\r\nchanted these melodies were discordant, but the people around listened\r\nwith reverential awe, from time to time making excited comments in\r\nIrish. Altogether Tuam is a depressing kind of place, and but for the\r\nenterprise of a few Protestants, the place would be a phantasmagoria\r\nof pigs, priests, peasants, poverty, and \"peelers.\" Perhaps Galway\r\nwould have more civilization, if less piety. You cannot move about an\r\nIrish country town after nightfall without barking your shins on a\r\nRoman Catholic Cathedral. This in time becomes somewhat monotonous.\r\n\r\nTuam (Co. Galway), May 9th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 21.--MR. BALFOUR'S FISHERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA clean, well-built town, with a big river, the Corrib, running\r\nthrough the middle of it, splashing romantically down from the salmon\r\nweir, not far from the Protestant Church of Saint Nicholas, a\r\nmagnificent cathedral-like structure over six hundred years old. There\r\nis a big square with trees and handsome buildings, several good\r\nhotels, a tramway, and, _mirabile dictu!_ a veritable barber's shop.\r\nThe Connaught folks, as a whole, seem to have fully realised the old\r\nsaying that shaving by a barber is a barbarous custom, but there is no\r\nrule without an exception, and accordingly Mr. McCoy, of Eyre Square,\r\nrazors and scissors her Majesty's lieges, whether gentle or simple,\r\nrebel or loyal, Unionist or Separatist, Catholic or Protestant. The\r\ngood Figaro himself is an out-and-out Separatist. He swallows complete\r\nIndependence, and makes no bones about it. He believes in Ireland a\r\nNation, insists on perfect autonomy, and, unlike the bulk of his\r\nfellow Nationalists, has the courage of his opinions. His objection to\r\nEnglish interference with Irish affairs is openly expressed, and with\r\nan emphasis which leaves no doubt of his sincerity. According to Mr.\r\nMcCoy, the woes of Ireland are each and all directly attributable to\r\nEnglish rule. The depopulation of the country, the lack of enterprise,\r\nof industry, of the common necessaries of life, of everything to be\r\ndesired by the sons of men--all these disagreeables are due to the\r\nselfishness, the greed, the brutality of Englishmen, who are not only\r\ndevoid of the higher virtues, but also entirely destitute of common\r\nfairness, common honesty, common humanity. Mr. McCoy holds that\r\nEngland exploits Ireland for her own purposes, is a merciless sucker\r\nof Hibernia's life-blood, a sweater, a slave-driver, a more than\r\nEgyptian taskmaster. Remove the hated English garrison, abolish\r\nEnglish influence, let Ireland guide her own destinies, and all will\r\nat once be well--trade will revive, poverty will disappear, emigration\r\nwill be checked, a teeming population will inhabit the land, and the\r\nEmerald Isle will once more become great, glorious, and free, Furst\r\nflower o' the airth, Furst gem o' the say. No longer will the gallant\r\nmen of Connaught bow their meek heads to American shears, no longer\r\npresent their well-developed jaws to Yankee razors; but, instead of\r\nthis, flocking in their thousands on saints' days and market days to\r\ntheir respective county towns, and especially to Galway, will form _en\r\nqueue_ at the door of Mr. McCoy, to save the country by fostering\r\nnative industries. No longer will it avail the Chinaman of whom he\r\ntold me to sail from New York to Ireland, because the latter is the\r\nonly country wherein Irishmen do not monopolise all the good things,\r\ndo not boss the show--have, in fact, no voice at all in its\r\nmanagement. \"But,\" said my friend, \"we'll get no Home Rule, we'll get\r\nno Parlimint, we'll get nothin' at all at all till Irishmen rise up\r\nin every part o' the wuruld an thrash it out o' ye. What business have\r\nthe English here at all domineering over us? Didn't one o' their great\r\nspakers get up in Parlimint an' say we must be kept paupers? Didn't he\r\nsay that 'the small loaf was the finest recruiting sergeant in the\r\nwuruld?' There ye have the spirit o' the English. We want the counthry\r\nto ourselves, an' to manage it our way, not yours. An' that thievin'\r\nowld Gladstone's the biggest scut o' thim all. No, I'm not grateful to\r\nGladstone, not a bit iv it. Divil a ha'porth we have to thank him for.\r\nSure, he was rakin Parnell out iv his grave, the mane-spirited scut,\r\nthat cringed and grinned whin Parnell was alive. Sure, 'twas Gladstone\r\nbroke up the party wid his morality. 'Ah,' says he, 'I couldn't\r\nassociate wid such a person, alanna!' An' he wouldn't let it be a\r\nParlimint at all--it must be a leg-is-la-ture, by the hokey, it must,\r\nno less. Let him go choke wid his leg-is-la-ture, the durty,\r\nmane-spirited owld scut.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McCoy declines to regard Mr. Gladstone as a benefactor of Ireland,\r\nbut in this he is not alone. His sentiments are shared by every\r\nIrishman I have met, no matter what his politics. The Unionist party\r\nare the more merciful, sparing expletives, calling no ill names. They\r\nadmire his ability, his wonderful vitality, versatility, ingenuity of\r\ntrickery. They sincerely believe that he is only crazy, and think it a\r\ngreat pity. They speak of the wreck of his rich intellect, and say in\r\neffect _corruptio optimi pessima est_. There is another monkish\r\nproverb which may strike them as they watch him in debate,\r\nparticularly when he seems to be cornered; it runs, _Non habet\r\nanguillam, Per caudam qui tenet illam_, which may be extemporaneously\r\nrendered, He has not surely caught the eel, Who only holds him by the\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nEvery Nationalist I have met entertains similar opinions, but few\r\nexpress them so unguardedly. Mr. McCoy must be honoured for his\r\ncandour and superior honesty. If his brethren were all as frankly\r\noutspoken as he England would be saved much trouble, much waste of\r\nprecious time. The secret aspirations of the Irish Nationalist\r\nleaders, if openly avowed, would dispose of the Home Rule agitation at\r\nonce and for ever. No risk of loss, no possible disadvantage, daunted\r\nMr. McCoy. He accepted the statement of a rabid Separatist, quoted in\r\na previous letter, that the Irish would prefer to go to hell their own\r\nway. That was his feeling exactly. Not that there was any danger.\r\nGreat was his confidence, implicit, sublime, ineffably Irish. His was\r\nthe faith that removes mountains. Not like a grain of mustard seed,\r\nbut like the rock of Cashel. _Floreat_ McCoy!\r\n\r\nMr. Athy, of Kinvarra, has very little to say. He thinks the bill\r\nwould make Ireland a hell upon earth for all Protestants living in\r\nCatholic communities, and that a settlement of the land question would\r\nsettle the hash of the agitators. Mr. Kendal, of Tallyho, an\r\nEnglishman twenty-five years resident in Ireland, agrees in the latter\r\nopinion. I forgot to question him _re_ toleration. He thinks the Home\r\nRule Bill simply insane, absurd, not worth serious discussion by\r\nsensible men. \"No intelligent man who knows the country would dream of\r\nsuch madness. The simplicity of the English people must be incredible.\r\nPity they cannot come over and examine for themselves.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Beddoes, traffic manager of the Limerick and Waterford Railway,\r\ncame to Ireland an enthusiastic Gladstonian. He had worked with might\r\nand main to send Mr. Price to Parliament, and was largely instrumental\r\nin returning him. He is now a staunch Unionist, admits the error of\r\nhis ways, and rejoices that a personal acquaintance with the subject\r\nat once led him into the true fold. I had this confession of faith\r\nfrom Mr. Beddoes himself, a keen, successful man of eminently\r\nConservative appearance, a scholar, a traveller, and a great favourite\r\nwith his men.\r\n\r\n\"How long were you in Ireland before you changed your mind?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Beddoes, \"to tell the truth, I began to have my\r\ndoubts during the first week.\"\r\n\r\nA prosperous Presbyterian of Galway said:--\"To say that the Irish\r\npeople, the masses, want an Irish Parliament is the height of\r\nabsurdity; and to argue that their aspirations are expressed by their\r\nvotes is a gross perversion of the truth. The ignorance of the people\r\nexplains everything. They voted as the priests told them to vote,\r\nwithout the smallest conception of what they were voting for, without\r\nthe smallest idea of what Home Rule really means. They are quite\r\nincapable of understanding a complicated measure of any kind, and they\r\nnaturally accept the guidance of their spiritual advisers, whom they\r\nare accustomed to regard as men of immense erudition, besides being\r\ngifted with power to bind and loose, and having the keys of heaven at\r\ncommand. You know how they canvass their penitents in the\r\nconfessional, and how from the altar they have taught the people to\r\nlie, telling them to vote for one man and to shout down the streets\r\nfor another. The Irish priests are wonderfully moral men in other\r\nrespects, and cases of immorality in its ordinary sense are so rare as\r\nto be practically unknown. I could forgive their politics, and even\r\ntheir confessional influence, if they were not such awful liars. Their\r\nwant of truthfulness reacts on the people, and if you send a man to do\r\na job, he will return and get his money when he has only half done it.\r\n'Oh, yes,' he'll say, as natural as possible, 'I've done it well, very\r\nwell.' And they are not ashamed when they are proved to be liars. They\r\nthink nothing of it. And the way they cheat each other! A few days ago\r\nI met a man who pulled out a bundle of one-pound notes, and said, 'I'm\r\nafther selling thirteen cows, an' I'm afther buying thirteen more. I\r\nsowld me cows to Barney So-and-So, afther givin' him six noggins of\r\npoteen, an' I got out of him twenty per cint. more than the price that\r\nwas goin', thanks be to God!' They are so pious--in words.\"\r\n\r\n\"What they want is emancipation from the priests and from the\r\nsuperstitions of the dark ages. They believe in the fairies still, and\r\nattribute all kinds of powers to them. Look at the _Tuam News_ of\r\nyesterday evening. Perhaps the English people would hesitate before\r\nconferring self-government on the poor folks who read that paper, if\r\nthey could only see the rag for a week or two.\"\r\n\r\nI secured the _Tuam News_ for Friday, May 12, 1893, and found the\r\nsheet instructive, suggestive, original. There is a big advertisement\r\nin Irish, an ancient Irish poem with translation, and a letter from\r\nMr. Henry Smyth, of Harborne, Birmingham, addressed to the National\r\nLiterary Society of Loughrea, under whose auspices Miss Gonne the\r\nother day delivered the rebel lecture quoted in the Killaloe letter.\r\nOur fellow-citizen speaks of \"the spirit of revival that is abroad\r\namongst you, of your new society rising phoenix-like from the ashes of\r\nthe old, not uninspired, we may suppose, by the project of your being\r\nin the near future masters in your own house, the arbiters of your own\r\ndestiny, for you will be governed by the men of your own choice.\" Side\r\nby side with this heart-felt utterance let us print another letter\r\nappearing in the same issue of the same hebdomadal illuminator:--\r\n\r\n                  TO THE EDITOR OF THE TUAM NEWS.\r\n\r\n    Sir,--Permit me a little space in the next issue of the _Tuam\r\n    News_, relative to my father being killed by the fairies which\r\n    appeared in the _Tuam News_ of the 8th of April last. I beg to\r\n    say that he was not killed by the fairies, but I say he was\r\n    killed by some person or persons unknown as yet. Hoping very\r\n    soon that the perpetrators of this dastardly outrage will be\r\n    soon brought to light, I am, Mr. Editor, yours obediently,\r\n\r\n                                                 DAVID REDINGTON.\r\nKilcreevanty, May 8th, '93.\r\n\r\nWhat would be thought of an English constituency which required such a\r\ncontradiction? The people who believe in the fairies form the bulk of\r\nthe Irish electorate. Their votes have sent the Nationalist members to\r\nParliament; their voice it is which directs the action of Gladstone,\r\nMorley, and Tail; their influence ordains the course of legislation;\r\nin their hands are the destinies of England and Englishmen. The people\r\nthemselves are innocent enough. If they hate England it is because\r\nthey have been so taught by priests and agitators for their own ends.\r\nThe only remedy is enlightenment, but the process must be slow. The\r\naccursed influences are ever at work, on the platform, in the press,\r\nat the altar, and I see no countervailing agency. The people are 'cute\r\nenough, and would be clever, if once their bonds were broken. They are\r\nnot fettered by English rule. They are bound down by Ignorance, rank\r\nIgnorance, in an Egyptian darkness that may be felt. They are poor in\r\nthis world's goods, although seemingly healthier and stronger than the\r\nEnglish average. Much of their poverty is their own fault. Much more\r\nis due to the teachings of agitators. The Land League has mined whole\r\ncommunities. Poverty and Ignorance made the Irish masses an easy prey.\r\nTheir ancient prejudices are kept alive, their ancient grievances\r\nindustriously disinterred, their imagination pleased with an\r\nillimitable vista of prosperity artfully unrolled before their\r\nuntutored gaze. We have the result before us. The Gladstonian party in\r\nEngland are responding to the dictates of a handful of hirelings and\r\nsacerdotalists, and not to the aspirations of a people. Credulity is\r\nthe offspring of Ignorance, and accordingly we see that the Irish\r\npeople believe in Tim Healy and the priests, the Grand Old Man and the\r\nfairies. They must be saved from themselves.\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Galway is very picturesque. A massive ivy-covered arch\r\nmarks the boundary line of the ancient walls, some of which are still\r\nextant. The raggedness and filthiness of the fisher-wives and children\r\nmust be seen to be understood. A few sturdy fishermen sat gloomily\r\nbeside two great piles of fish, thrown out of the boats in heaps.\r\nLarge fish, like cod, and yet not cod; bigger than hake, but not\r\nunlike the Cornish fish. To ask a question at a country station or in\r\nthe street is in Connaught rather embarrassing, as all the people\r\nwithin earshot immediately crowd around to hear what is going on. Not\r\nimpudent, but sweetly unsophisticated are the Galway folks, openly\r\nregarding the stranger with inquiring eye, not unfriendly, but merely\r\ncurious. Having no business of their own, they take the deepest\r\ninterest in that of other people. And they make a fuss. They are too\r\npolite. They load you with attentions. No trouble is too great. Give\r\nthem the smallest chance and they put themselves about until you wish\r\nyou had not spoken. However, I wanted to know about the fish, so I\r\nstrolled up to two men who were lying at full length on the quay, and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"What do you call those fish?\"\r\n\r\nBoth men sprang hastily to their feet, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Black pollock, Sorr.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you catch them?\"\r\n\r\nAt this juncture two or three dozen urchins galloped up, most of them,\r\nsave for a thick skin of dirt, clad in what artists call the nude.\r\nThey surrounded us, and listened with avidity.\r\n\r\n\"Outside the Aran Islands.\"\r\n\r\nHere several women joined the group, and more were seen hastening to\r\nthe scene of excitement from every point of the compass.\r\n\r\n\"How far away is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty miles, Sorr.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they worth?\"\r\n\r\n\"A shilling a dozen.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, a penny a pound?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but a shilling for a dozen fish, and there's thirteen to the\r\ndozen.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how heavy is the average fish?\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up one by the jaws, and weighing him on his hand, said--\r\n\r\n\"That chap would be nigh-hand fourteen pounds. Some's more, some's\r\nless.\"\r\n\r\nIt was even so. The agent of the Congested Districts Board, Mr.\r\nMichael Walsh, of Dock Street, confirmed this startling statement.\r\nThirteen huge codlike fish for a shilling! More than a hundredweight\r\nand a half of fish for twelve pence sterling! And, as Father Mahony\r\nremarks, still the Irish peasant mourns, still groans beneath the\r\ncruel English yoke, still turns his back on the teeming treasures of\r\nthe deep. The brutal Balfour supplied twenty-five boats to the poor\r\npeasants of the western seaboard, and these, all working in\r\nconjunction under direction, have proved both a boon and a blessing.\r\n\"Yesterday I sent sixty boxes of mackerel to Messrs. Smith, of\r\nBirmingham, and to-day I think I shall send them a hundred,\" said Mr.\r\nWalsh. \"These Balfour boats have been a wonderful success. You'll hear\r\nthe very ignorant still cursing him, but not the better-informed, nor\r\nthe people he has benefited. I think him a great man, a very great\r\nman, indeed. I am no politician. I only look at the effect he produced\r\nand the blessing he was to the people. On Wednesday last the Duras\r\nsteamer brought in 400 boxes of fish, which had been caught in one\r\nday. We thought that pretty good, but Thursday's consignment was\r\nsimply astonishing, 1,100 boxes coming in. We sent them all to\r\nEngland. Mackerel have fetched grand prices this year. Early in the\r\nseason we sold them to Birmingham at tenpence apiece wholesale, with\r\ncarriage and other expenses on the top of that. Better price than the\r\npollock? Well, that fish is not very good just now. Sometimes it\r\nfetches six shillings a dozen fish, nearly sixpence each. No, not much\r\nfor twelve or fourteen pounds of good fish. Half-a-crown a dozen is\r\nmore usual. There's no demand. Yes, they're cheap to-day. A dozen\r\npounds of fish for a penny would be reckoned 'a cheap loaf' in\r\nBirmingham.\"\r\n\r\nA shopkeeper near the harbour complained of the unbusiness-like ways\r\nof the Galway townsmen:--\"They have no notion of business management.\r\nTake the Galway Board of Guardians. They resolved that any contractor\r\nfurnishing milk below a certain standard should have his contract\r\nbroken if he were caught swindling the authorities three times in six\r\nmonths. What would they think of such a resolution in England? Well,\r\none fellow was caught three times or more. His milk was found to\r\ncontain forty-four per cent. of water. Instead of kicking him out at\r\nonce there was a great debate on the subject. It was not denied that\r\nthe facts were as I have stated them. His friends simply said, 'Ah,\r\nnow, let the Boy go on wid the conthract; shure, isn't he the dacent\r\nBoy altogether? An' what for would ye break the conthract whin he put\r\nin a dhrop of clane wather, that wouldn't hurt anybody. Shure, 'tis\r\nvery wholesome it is intirely.' As Curran said, 'we are ruined with\r\nto-day saying we'll do some thing, and then turning round and saying\r\nto-morrow that we won't do it.' Another Guardian named Connor stuck up\r\nfor the right thing, and another named Davoren gave the contractor's\r\nfriends a good tongue-thrashing. The milkman was sacked by fifteen\r\nvotes to nine. The right thing was done, but my point is that a lot\r\nof time was wasted in trying to bolster up such a case, and nine men\r\nactually voted for the defaulter, whose action was so grossly\r\nfraudulent, and who had been caught at least three times in six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\"The bag factory has just been closed. The Home Rule Bill is at the\r\nbottom of this mischief. It was the only factory we had in Galway, and\r\nwhat the people here are to do now God only knows. It gave employment\r\nto the working classes of the town, who will now have to go further\r\nafield. Some are off to America, some to England, some to Scotland.\r\nCurious thing I've noticed. A Scotsman lands here with twopence, next\r\nday has fourpence, in five years a house and farm of his own, in\r\ntwenty-five years an estate, in thirty years is being shot at as a\r\nlandowner, in forty years has an agent to be deputy cock-shot for him.\r\nBut Irishmen who go to Scotland nearly always return next year\r\nswearing that the country is poor as the Divil. Now, how is that?\r\n\r\n\"The bag works was just short of money and management. Irishmen are\r\nnot financiers. They are always getting into holes, and waiting for\r\nsomebody to get them out. They have no self-reliance. You may hold\r\nthem up by the scruff of the neck for years and years, and the moment\r\nyou drop them they hate you like poison. Many shooting cases would\r\nshow this if impartially looked into. Pity the English do not come\r\nover here more than they do. The people get along famously with\r\nindividual Englishmen, and sometimes they wonder where all the\r\nmurdering villains are of whom they hear from their spiritual and\r\npolitical advisers. A priest said in my hearing, 'Only the best men\r\ncome over here. They are picked out to impose on you.' And the poor\r\nfolks believed him. We want to know each other better. The English are\r\njust as ignorant as the Irish, in a way. They know no more of the\r\nIrish than the Irish know of them. The poor folks of Connaught firmly\r\nbelieve that they would be well off and able to save money but for the\r\nEnglish that ruin the country. And here this Jute Bag Company is\r\nbursted up because it had not capital to carry on with. Belfast men or\r\nEnglishmen would have made it a big success. It stopped because it\r\ncould not raise enough money to buy a ship-load of jute, and was\r\nobliged to buy from hand to mouth from retailers.\r\n\r\n\"Take the wool trade. Everywhere over Ireland you will see Wool, Wool\r\nin big letters on placards for the farmers--notices of one sort or\r\nanother. We are the centre of a wool district. Not a single wool\r\nfactory, although the town is in every way fitted for excelling in the\r\nwoollen trade. We have a grand river, and the people understand wool.\r\nThey card and spin, and make home-made shawls and coat-pieces at their\r\nown homes, just for themselves, and there they stop. They are waiting\r\nfor Home Rule, they say. Pass the bill, and factories will jump out of\r\nthe ground like mushrooms. Instead of taking advantage of the means at\r\ntheir disposal, they are looking forward to a speculative something\r\nwhich they cannot define. The English are the cause of any trouble\r\nthey may have, and an Irish Parliament will totally change the aspect\r\nof things. Everybody is going to be well off, and with little or no\r\nwork. The farmers are going to get the land for nothing, or next to\r\nnothing, and all heretics will be sent out of the country, or kept\r\ndown and in their proper place.\"\r\n\r\nThus spake a well-to-do Protestant, born in Galway some sixty years\r\nago, a half-breed Irish and Scotchman. I have now heard so many\r\nexasperating variations of this same tune, that I should be disposed,\r\nhad I the power, to take a deep and desperate revenge by granting the\r\ngrumblers Home Rule on the spot. It would doubtless serve them right,\r\nbut England has also herself to consider.\r\n\r\nGalway Town, May 13th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 22.--THE LAND LEAGUE'S REIGN AT LOUGHREA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the most depressing town I have seen as yet. Except on market\r\nand fair days, literally nothing is done. The streets are nearly\r\ndeserted, the houses are tumbling down, gable-ends without side-walls\r\nor roofs are seen everywhere, nettles are growing in the old chimney\r\ncorners, and the splendid ruins of the ancient abbey are the most\r\ncheerful feature of the place. A few melancholy men stand about, the\r\npicture of despondent wretchedness, a few sad-eyed girls wander about\r\nwith the everlasting hood, hiding their heads and faces, a few\r\nmiserable old women beg from all and sundry, and the usual swarm of\r\nbarefooted children are, of course, to the fore. The shopkeepers\r\ndisplay their wares, waiting wearily for market day, and dismally\r\nhoping against hope for better times. Everybody is in the doleful\r\ndumps, everybody says the place is going down, everybody says that\r\nthings grow worse, that the trade of the place grows smaller by\r\ndegrees and gradually less, that enterprise is totally extinguished,\r\nthat there is no employment for the people, and no prospect of any.\r\nThose whose heads are just above water are puzzled to know how those\r\nworse off than themselves contrive to exist at all, and look towards\r\nthe future with gloomiest foreboding. Like the man who quoted\r\nChristmas strawberries at twelve dollars a pound, they ask how the\r\npoor are going to live. The young men of the place seem to have quite\r\nlost heart, and no longer muster spirit enough to murder anybody.\r\nLoughrea is disloyal as the sea is salt. The man in the street is full\r\nof grievances. His poverty and ignorance make him the mark of lying\r\nagitators, who arouse in his simple soul implacable resentment for\r\nimaginary wrongs. A decent civil working-man named Hanan thus\r\nexpressed himself:--\r\n\r\n\"The town was a fine business place until a few years ago, whin the\r\nLand League ruined it. Ah, thim was terrible times. We had murthers in\r\nthe town an' all round the town. Perhaps the people that got shot\r\ndesarved it, they say here that they did; but, all the same, the\r\nplace was ruined by the goin's on. It's no joke to kill nine or ten\r\npeople in and about a quiet little place like this. An' ever since\r\nthin the place is goin' down, down, down, an' no one knows what will\r\nbe the ind iv it. 'Tis all the fault of the English Governmint. The\r\ncounthry is full of gowld mines, an' silver mines, an' copper mines,\r\nan' we're not allowed to work thim. Divil a lie I spake. The\r\nGovernment wouldn't allow us to bore for coal. Sure, we're towld by\r\nthim that knows all about it, men that's grate scholars an' can spake\r\nout iligant. Why wouldn't we be allowed to sink a coal mine in our own\r\ncounthry? Why wouldn't we be allowed to get the gowld that's all\r\nthrough the mountains? 'Tis the English that wants iverything for\r\nthimsilves, an' makes us all starvin' paupers intirely.\"\r\n\r\nThis serves to indicate the kind of falsehoods palmed off upon these\r\npoor people in order to make them agitators or criminals. Hanan went\r\non--\r\n\r\n\"Look at the Galway Bag Factory. I'm towld that's shutting up now.\r\nWhat'll the people do at all, at all, that was employed in it? An' the\r\nEnglish Parlimint ordhers it to be closed because it turns out bags\r\nchaper than they can make thim in England, an' betther, and the\r\nEnglish maker couldn't compate. Ye know betther? I wouldn't\r\nconthradict yer honour's glory, ye mane well; but I have it from them\r\nthat knows. Look at the Galway marble quarries. There's two sorts o'\r\nmarble in one quarry, an' tis grand stone it is, an' the quarries\r\nwould give no ind iv imploymint to the poor men that's willin' to\r\nwork. God help thim, but they're not allowed to cut a lump of stone in\r\ntheir own counthry. What stops them? Sure 'tis the English Government,\r\nan' what would it be else? A gintleman isn't allowed to cut a stone on\r\nhis own land. All must come from England. Ye make us buy it off ye,\r\nan' us wid millions of pounds' worth of stone. Ah, now, don't tell me\r\n'tis all rubbish. Sure, I have it sthraight from mimbers of Parlimint.\r\nDidn't the English Governmint send out soldiers an' policemen, wid\r\nguns an' swords, an' stop the men that wint to cut the stone in the\r\nmarble quarries I was afther mintionin' to yer honour? Yes, 'twas the\r\nLand League that ruined this place, but 'twas the Governmint that made\r\nthe Land League by dhriving the people into it. No, I wouldn't trust\r\nGladstone or any other Englishman. They'll take care of thimselves,\r\nthe English. We'll get no more than they can help. What we got out o'\r\nGladstone we bate out o' him. We get nothing but what we conquered.\r\nSmall thanks we owe, an' small thanks we'll give.\"\r\n\r\nA small farmer said, \"The rints isn't low enough. The judicial rints\r\nis twice too much, an' the price of stock what it is. We must have a\r\nsliding scale, an' pay rint according to the price of produce. We must\r\nhave the land for half what we pay now. I wouldn't say anythin' agin'\r\nthe English. I have two brothers there an' they come over here\r\nsometimes, an' from what they tell me I believe the English manes\r\nwell. An' the English law isn't bad at all. 'Tis the administhration\r\nof the law that's bad. We have the law, but 'tis no use to us because\r\nthe landlords administhers it. Divil a bit o' compinsation can we get.\r\nAn' if we want a pump, or a fence, or a bit o' repairs, we may wait\r\nfor seven years, till our hearts break wid worryin' afther it. Thin\r\nwe've our business to mind, an' we've not the time nor the money to go\r\nto law, even whin the law is with us an we have a clear case. The\r\nlandlord has his agint, that has nothin' else to do but to circumvint\r\nus, so that the land laws don't do us the good that ye think over in\r\nEngland. Ye have grand laws, says you, an' 'tis thrue for you; but who\r\nworks the laws? says I. That's where the trouble comes in. Who works\r\nthe laws? says I.\r\n\r\n\"Thin ye say, ye can buy your farms all out, says you. But the\r\nlandlords won't sell, says I. Look at the Monivea disthrict. French is\r\na good landlord enough, but he won't sell. The tinants want to buy,\r\nbut if ye go to Monivea Castle ye'll have your labour for your pains.\r\nThe agint is the landlord's brother, an' a dacent, good man he is. I\r\nhave a relative over there, an' sorra a word agin aither o' thim will\r\nhe spake. But when he wint to buy his farm, not an inch would he get.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement was so diametrically opposed to that of Mr. John Cook,\r\nof Londonderry, who said that the farmers had ceased to buy, owing to\r\ntheir belief that the land would shortly become their own on much\r\nbetter terms than they could at present obtain, that I tramped to\r\nMonivea, a distance of six miles from Athenry, for the purpose of\r\nascertaining, if possible, how far my Loughrea friend's assertion was\r\nborne out by facts. Monivea is a charming village, built round a great\r\ngreen patch of turf, whereon the children play in regiments. Imagine\r\nan oblong field three hundred yards long by one hundred wide, bounded\r\nat one end by high trees, at the other by a great manor house in\r\nruins, the sides closed in by neat white cottages and a pretty\r\nProtestant Church, and you have Monivea, the sweetest village I have\r\nseen in Ireland. Here I interviewed four men, one of whom had just\r\nreturned by the Campania from America, to visit his friends after an\r\nabsence of many years. This gentleman was a strong Unionist, and\r\nridiculed the idea of Home Rule as the most absurd and useless measure\r\never brought forward with the object of benefiting his countrymen.\r\n\"What will ye do wid it when ye've got it?\" he said; \"sure it can\r\nnever do ye any good at all. How will it put a penny in yer pockets,\r\nan' what would ye get by it that ye can't get widout it?\" Two farmers\r\nthought they would get the land for a much lower rent. They said that\r\nalthough the landowner, Mr. French, was an excellent, kind, and\r\nliberal man, and that no fault at all could be found with his brother,\r\nthe agent, yet still the land was far too dear, and that a large\r\nportion of it was worth nothing at all. \"I pay eight and sixpence an\r\nacre for land that grows nothing but furze, that a few sheep can\r\nnibble round, an', begorra, 'tis not worth half-a-crown. Most iv it is\r\nworth just nothin' at all, an' yet I have to scrape together eight\r\nand sixpence an acre,\" said he. \"'Tis not possible to get a livin' out\r\niv it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thin why don't ye lave it?\" said the man from Missouri.\r\n\r\n\"Why thin, how could I lave the bit o' ground me father had? Av ye\r\noffered me a hundhred acres o' land for nothin' elsewhere, I vow to\r\nGod I would rather stay on the bit o' rock that grows heath and gorse,\r\nif I could only get a crust out iv it, far sooner,\" said the grumbler.\r\n\r\n\"An' d'ye think Home Rule will enable ye to do betther? Ye'll believe\r\nanythin' in Monivea. Ye are the same as iver ye wor. It's no use\r\nraisonin' wid yez at all. Sure, the counthry won't be able to do\r\nwidout loans, an' who'll lind ye money wid an Irish Parlimint?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why would we want money whin there's gowld to be had for the diggin',\r\nav we got lave to dig it?\" said the man of Monivea.\r\n\r\nThe villagers believe that England prevents their mining for coal,\r\ngold, silver, copper; that the British Government tyrannically puts\r\ndown all enterprise; that Home Rule will open mines, build railways,\r\nfactories, institute great public works; that their friends will flock\r\nback from America; that all the money now spent out of the country\r\nwill be disbursed in Ireland for Irish manufactures; that the land\r\nmust and will become their own for nothing, or next to nothing; and in\r\nshort, that simultaneously with the first sitting of an Irish\r\nParliament an era of unprecedented prosperity will immediately set in.\r\nThe two farmers confirmed what I have been told of the reluctance of\r\nthe landlords to part with an acre of the land, and said that men had\r\nreturned from America with money to buy farms, and after having\r\nwandered in vain over Ireland were fain to go back to the States,\r\nbeing unable to purchase even at a fancy price. They have been told\r\nthis by persons in whom they had implicit trust, and I am sure they\r\nbelieved it. A fairly educated man, who had travelled, and from whom I\r\nexpected better things, has since assured me that the stories about\r\ncompulsory closing of mines and quarries had been dinned into him from\r\ninfancy, and that he was of opinion that these assertions were well\r\nfounded, and that they could not be successfully contradicted.\r\nEverywhere the same story of English selfishness and oppression. He\r\ncited a case in point. \"Twenty years ago there was a silver mine in\r\nKinvarra. It gave a lot of employment to the people of those parts,\r\nand was a grand thing for the country at large. The Government stepped\r\nin and closed it. I'm towld by them I can believe that 'twas done to\r\nkeep us poor, so that they could manage us, because we'd not be able\r\nto resist oppression and tyranny, we'd be that pauperised. England\r\ndoes everything to keep us down. They have the police and the soldiers\r\neverywhere to watch us that we'd get no money at all. So when they see\r\nus starting a factory, or a fishery, or opening a mine or a quarry,\r\nthe word comes down to stop it, and if we'd say No, this is our own\r\ncountry, and we'll do what we like in it, they'd shoot us down, and we\r\ncouldn't help ourselves. I'm not sayin' that I want Home Rule or\r\nanything fanciful just for mere sentiment. We only want our own, and\r\nHome Rule will give us our own.\"\r\n\r\nThe Home Rule party, the Nationalist patriots who know full well the\r\nfalsity of these and such-like beliefs, are responsible for this\r\ninvincible ignorance. Hatred and distrust of England are the staple of\r\ntheir teachings, which the credulous peasantry imbibe like mother's\r\nmilk. The peripatetic patriots who invade the rural communities seem\r\nto be easy, extemporaneous liars, having a natural gift for\r\ntergiversation, an undeniable gift for mendacity, an inexhaustible\r\nfertility of invention. Such liars, like poets, are born, not made,\r\nthough doubtless their natural gifts have been improved and developed\r\nby constant practice. Like Parolles, they \"lie with such volubility\r\nthat you would think Truth were a fool.\" The seed has been\r\nindustriously sown, and John Bull is reaping the harvest. Is there no\r\nmeans of enlightenment available? Is there no antidote to this poison?\r\nI am disposed to believe that if the country were stumped by men of\r\nknown position and integrity much good would be done. Leaflets bearing\r\ngood names would have considerable effect. The result might not be\r\nseen at once, but the thing would work, and the people have less and\r\nless confidence in their leaders. The most unlettered peasant is a\r\nkeen judge of character, and, given time, would modify his views. The\r\ntruth about the mines, given in clear and simple language, would have\r\na great effect. Education is fighting for the Union. Time is all the\r\nLoyalists require. The National Schools must, in the long run, be\r\nfatal to political priestcraft and traitorous agitation.\r\n\r\nTo return to Loughrea. I walked a short distance out of the town to\r\nsee the place where Mr. Blake, Lord Clanricarde's agent, was so foully\r\nmurdered. A little way past the great Carmelite Convent I encountered\r\nan old man, who showed me the fatal spot. A pleasant country road with\r\nfair green meadows on each side, a house or two not far away, the\r\nfields all fenced with the stone walls characteristic of the County\r\nGalway. \"'Twas here, Sorr, that the guns came over the wall. Misther\r\nBlake was dhrivin' to church, at about eleven o'clock o' a foin\r\nsummer's mornin'. His wife was wid him, an' Timothy Ruane was runnin'\r\nthe horse--a dacent boy was Tim, would do a hand's turn for anybody.\r\nThe childer all swore by Tim, be raison he was the boy to give them\r\nhalf-pince for sweets and the like o' that. So they dhrove along, and\r\nwhin they came tin yards from this, says Tim, sittin' in front wid the\r\nreins, says he, 'Misther Blake, I see some men at the back iv the\r\nditch,' says he. 'Drive on, Tim,' says Misther Blake, 'sure that's\r\nnothin' to do with aither you or me.' An' the next instant both of\r\nthim wor in Eternity! Blake and poor Tim wor kilt outright on the\r\nspot, an' nayther of them spoke a word nor made a move, but jist\r\ndhropped stone dead, God rest their sowls. An' the wife, that's\r\nMisthress Blake, a good, kind-hearted lady she was, was shot in the\r\nhip, an' crippled, but she wasn't kilt, d'ye see. Blake was a hard\r\nman, they said, an' must have the rint. An' poor Tim was kilt the way\r\nhe wouldn't tell o' the boys that did it. 'Twas slugs they used, an'\r\nnot bullets, but they fired at two or three yards, an' so close that\r\nthe shot hasn't time to spread, an' 'tis as good as a cannon ball. Who\r\nwere they? All boys belongin' to the place. Mrs. Blake dhropped, an'\r\nthey thought she was dead, I believe. Some thinks she was shot by\r\naccident, an' that they did not mane to kill a wake woman at all. But\r\nwhin they shot Tim, to kape his mouth shut, why wouldn't they shoot\r\nthe woman?\"\r\n\r\nSeven men were arrested, and everybody in the place was believed to\r\nknow the murderers. The police had no doubt at all that they had the\r\nright men. All were acquitted. No evidence was offered. No witness\r\ncared to meet the fate of Blake. Silence, in this case, was golden,\r\nand no mistake about it.\r\n\r\nWalking from the railway station along the main street, in the very\r\nheart of the town, you see on your left the modest steeple of the\r\nProtestant church, some fifty yards down Church Street. The town is\r\nbuilt on two parallel streets, and Church Street is the principal\r\nconnecting artery, about a hundred yards long. Exactly opposite the\r\nchurch the houses on the right recede some five or six feet from the\r\nrank; and here poor Sergeant Linton met his death. He was an Antrim\r\nman, a Black Presbyterian, and a total abstainer. His integrity was so\r\nwell known that he was exempted from attendance at the police\r\nroll-call. He was death on secret societies, and was thought to know\r\ntoo much. In the soft twilight of a summer's eve he left the main\r\nstreet and sauntered down Church Street. When he reached the\r\nindentation above-mentioned a man shot him with a revolver, and fled\r\ninto the main street. The unfortunate officer gave chase, pursuing the\r\nassassin along the principal thoroughfare, his life-blood ebbing fast,\r\nuntil, on reaching the front of Nevin's Hotel, he fell dead. Arrests\r\nwere made, and, as before, the criminal was undoubtedly secured. Again\r\nno evidence. The murderer was liberated, but he wisely left the\r\ncountry, and will hardly return. A policeman said: \"There was no doubt\r\nabout the case. The criminal was there. Everybody spotted the man,\r\neven those who did not see him shoot. But nobody spoke, and if they\r\nhad spoken he would have got off just the same. The people of this\r\nhappy country have brought the art of defeating the law to its highest\r\nperfection. The most ignorant peasants know all its weak spots, and\r\nthey work them well, very well indeed, from their own point of view.\r\nSuppose ten of Linton's comrades had seen the shot fired, and that\r\nthey had immediately caught the assassin, with the revolver in his\r\nhands. The jury would not have convicted him. Yes, I know that the\r\njudge in certain cases can set aside the verdict of the jury. If you\r\ndid that in Ireland it would cost some lives. Wouldn't there be a\r\nshindy! And then there's strong judges and weak judges. Judges don't\r\nlike being shot more than other people. And Irish judges are made of\r\nflesh and blood. Look at O'Halloran's case. I was in the Court when it\r\nwas tried. A moonlighting case. The police caught a man on the spot,\r\nwith a rifle having a double load. The thing was clear as the sun at\r\nnoonday. Acquitted. The jury said, 'Not guilty'; and the man went\r\nquietly home. The administration of justice with a weak judge, or with\r\na strong judge who feels a weak Government behind him, is a farce in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n\"What will happen if we do not get the Bill? I think there will be\r\nsome disturbance--the ruffians are always with us--although the people\r\ndo not want Home Rule. I mean, they don't care about it. The bulk of\r\nthe people would not give sixpence for Home Rule. They have been told\r\nit will pay them well, and they go in for that. Not one of them would\r\nhave Home Rule if it cost him a penny, unless he believed he'd get\r\ntwopence for his outlay. It's the land, and nothing else. The party\r\nthat puts the land question on a comfortable footing will rule Ireland\r\nfor ever. That's the opinion of every man in the force, in Loughrea or\r\nelsewhere. We have a curiosity here--a priest who goes against Home\r\nRule. A very great man he was, head of a college or something, not one\r\nof the common ruck, and he's dead against it, and says so openly. The\r\n_Tuam News_ used to pitch into him, but he didn't care, so they got\r\ntired of it. No good rowing people up when they laugh at you.\"\r\n\r\nAn old woman of the type too common in Ireland came up as the officer\r\nleft me, and said:--\r\n\r\n\"Musha, now, but 'tis the foin, handsome man ye are, an' ye've a\r\ngintleman's face on ye, bedad ye have, an,'\" here she showed a\r\nhalfpenny in her withered claw, \"this is all I got since I kem out,\r\nand me that's twistin' wid the rummatacks like the divil on a hot\r\ngriddle; the holy Mother o' God knows its thrue, an' me ould man,\r\nthat's seventy or eighty or more--the divil a one o' him knows his own\r\nage--he's that sick an' bad, an' that wake intirely, that he couldn't\r\nlift a herrin' wid a pair o' hot tongs; 'tis an ulster he has, that\r\ndoes be ruinin' him, the docthor says; bad luck to it for an ulster\r\nwid a powltice, an' he's growlin' that he has no tobacky, God help\r\nhim. (Here I gave her something.) Almighty God open ye the gates in\r\nheaven, the Holy Mother o' God pour blessin's upon ye. 'Tis Englishmen\r\nI like, bedad it is; the grandest, foinest, greatest counthry in the\r\nwuruld, begorra it is--an' why not?\"\r\n\r\nThis outburst somehow reminded me of a certain gentleman I met at the\r\nRailway Hotel, Athenry. He said, \"I'm a Home Ruler out and out. The\r\ncounthry's widin a stone's throw o' Hell, an' we may as well be in it\r\nalthegither.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Kelly,\" said the charming Miss O'Reilly, \"you are most\r\ninconsistent; you sometimes say you are a Conservative----\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye,\" assented Mr. Kelly, \"but that's only when I'm sober!\"\r\n\r\nThe Loughreans are quiet now, but the secret societies which dealt so\r\nlightly with human life are still at work, and the best-informed\r\npeople believe that the murderous emissaries of the Land League, whose\r\nterrorism ruined the town, are only kept down by a powerful and\r\nvigilant police. I have only described three of the murders which took\r\nplace in the town and neighbourhood during a comparatively short\r\nperiod. Add Mr. Burke and driver Wallace; both shot dead near\r\nCraughwell. J. Connor, of Carrickeele, who had accepted a situation as\r\nbog-ranger, _vice_ Keogh, discharged. Shot. Three men arrested. No\r\nevidence. Patrick Dempsey, who had taken a small farm from which\r\nMartin Birmingham had been evicted. Shot dead in the presence of his\r\ntwo small children, with whom he was walking to church. No evidence.\r\nNo convictions, but many more crimes, both great and small. So many\r\nmurders that outrages do not count for much.\r\n\r\nIt is to the men who are directly responsible for all these horrors\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone proposes to entrust the government of Ireland.\r\n\r\nLoughrea, May 16th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 23.--THE REIGN OF INDOLENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just returned from Innishmore, the largest of the Aran islands,\r\nthe population of which have been lifted from a condition of chronic\r\nstarvation and enabled to earn their own livelihood by the splendid\r\norganisation of Mr. Balfour for the relief of the congested districts.\r\nPostal and other exigences having compelled a hasty return to the\r\nmainland, I defer a full account of this most interesting visit until\r\nmy next letter, when I shall also be in possession of fuller and more\r\naccurate information than is attainable on the island itself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, let us examine the state of Irish feeling by the sad sea\r\nwaves of Galway Bay. Salthill is a plucky little bathing place; that\r\nis, plucky for Ireland. It is easily accessible from Galway town, and\r\nlooks over the bay, but it is more like a long natural harbour without\r\nships. There is a mile or so of promenade with stone seats at\r\nintervals, a shingle dotted with big rocks, a modicum of\r\nslate-coloured sand, like that of Schevening, in Holland, and blue\r\nhills opposite, like those of Carlingford Lough. The promenade is\r\nkerbed by a massive sea wall of limestone, and here and there flights\r\nof stone steps lead to the water's edge. Facing the sea are handsome\r\nvillas, with flower gardens, tidy gravelled walks, shrubberies, snowy\r\nwindow blinds and other appurtenances of a desperately Protestant\r\nappearance. No large hotels, no villas with \"Apartments\" on a card in\r\nthe fanlight, no boatmen plying for hire, no boats even, either ashore\r\nor afloat; no bathing-machines no anything the brutal Saxon mostly\r\nneeds, except fresh air and blazing sunshine. The Galway end of this\r\nfashionable resort has a few shady houses, aggressively Anglicised\r\nwith names like Wave View House and Elm Tree View, the first looking\r\nat a whitewashed wall, the second at a telegraph post. But although\r\nsome of these houses announce \"Furnished Lodgings,\" no English\r\ntourists would \"take them on.\" If you want to bathe you walk into the\r\nsea as you stand, or hand your toga virilis to the bystanders, if any.\r\nThe Connaught folks have no false modesty.\r\n\r\nA white-haired gentleman descends from a wagonette and promenades for\r\na while. Then he sits down beside me. The conversation turns on Home\r\nRule. My friend is impatient, has been spending a few days in Belfast.\r\nThe ignorance of the poor people is astonishing. A Roman Catholic of\r\nthe Northern city told him that the first act of the Irish Parliament\r\nwould be to level Cave Hill, and on the site thereof to build cottages\r\nfor the poor. The hill was full of diamonds, which Queen Victoria\r\nwould not allow the poor Irish folks to get. The country would be full\r\nof money. Didn't Mr. Gladstone say we'd have too much?--a clear\r\nallusion to the \"chronic plethora.\" The people would have the upper\r\nhand, as they ought to have, and the first thing would be to evict the\r\nevictors. The only question was, would they clear out peaceably, or\r\nwould it be necessary to call in the aid of the Irish Army of\r\nIndependence?\r\n\r\n\"This poor man evidently believed that every respectable person,\r\neverybody possessing means and property, was an enemy to the\r\ncommonwealth. An ardent Home Ruler asked me if the majority had a\r\nright to rule. He thought that was a triumphant, an unanswerable\r\nquestion. I replied that during a long and busy life I had always\r\nobserved how, in successful enterprises, the majority did not rule.\r\nThe intelligent minority, the persons who had shown their wisdom,\r\ntheir industry, their sagacity, their integrity, that they were\r\ncompetent and reliable, those, I said, were the people who were\r\nentrusted with the management of great affairs, and not the\r\nmany-headed mob. The management of Irish affairs promises to be a task\r\nof tremendous difficulty, and those to whom you propose to entrust\r\nthis huge and complicated machinery stand convicted of inability to\r\nmanage with even tolerable success such comparatively simple affairs\r\nas the party journal, or the rent collection of new Tipperary. Both\r\nthese enterprises turned out dead failures owing to the total\r\nincapacity of the Irish Parliamentary party. And we are asked to\r\nentrust the future of the country to these men, whose only\r\nqualifications are a faculty for glib talk and an unreasonable hatred\r\nof everything English.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone has shown to demonstration that statesmen are no longer\r\nto direct the course of legislation; are no longer to lead the people\r\nonward in the paths of progressive improvement. The unthinking,\r\nuneducated masses are in future to signify their will, and statesmen\r\nare to be the automata to carry out their behests, whatever they may\r\nbe. The unwashed, unshorn incapables who have nothing, because they\r\nlack the brains and industry to acquire property, are nowadays told\r\nthat they, and they alone, shall decide the fate of empires, shall\r\ndecide the ownership of property, shall manipulate the fortunes of\r\nthose who have raised themselves from the dirt by ability,\r\nself-denial, and unremitting hard work. Look at the comparative\r\nreturns of the illiterate electorate. In Scotland 1 in 160, in England\r\n1 in 170, in Ireland 1 in 5. In one quarter of Donegal, a Catholic\r\none, more illiterates than in all Scotland. Not that there is so much\r\ndifference as these figures would seem to show. But if men who can\r\nwrite declare themselves illiterate, so that the priests and village\r\nruffians may be satisfied as to how they individually voted, is not\r\nthis still more deplorable? The conduct of the English Gladstonians\r\npasses my comprehension. They do not examine for themselves. They say\r\nMr. Gladstone says so-and-so, and for them this is sufficient. Do they\r\nsay their prayers to the Grand Old Man?\"\r\n\r\nAnother Salthill malcontent said:--\"An English visitor sneeringly\r\nasked me how it was that the Irish could not trust one another. I\r\nsaid, 'We cannot trust these men, and we can give you what ought to be\r\na satisfactory reason for our distrust. They have been condemned as\r\ncriminals by a competent tribunal, presided over by three English\r\njudges, one of them a Roman Catholic. They have been found guilty of\r\ncriminal conspiracy, of sympathy with crime, and of having furnished\r\nthe means for its committal, and that after the fairest trial ever\r\nheld in the world. By a law passed in 1787 by Grattan's Parliament\r\nthey would have suffered the punishment of death for this same\r\ncriminal conspiracy. And, apart from Home Rule, leaving the present\r\nagitation altogether out of the question, the respectable classes of\r\nIreland entirely object to be represented by such men, either at\r\nWestminster or College Green. Their conduct has done more to ruin\r\nIreland than any other calamity which the country has endured for long\r\nages. They have displayed an ingenuity of torture, and a refinement of\r\ncruelty, worthy of the Inquisition. Look at the case of\r\nDistrict-inspector Murphy, of Woodford, in this county. Not by any\r\nmeans the worst of the tens of thousands of cases all over the\r\ncountry, but impressive to me because it came under my own\r\nobservation. At the trial of Wilfrid Blunt, Mr. Murphy deposed upon\r\noath that so severely was he boycotted for the mere performance of his\r\nduty, that his children were crying for bread, and that he was unable\r\nto give them any. Policemen had to bring milk from miles away. In\r\nother cases the pupils of these patriots, the preachers of the Land\r\nLeague, poured human filth into the water supply of their victims, who\r\nwere in many cases ladies of gentle birth and children of tender\r\nyears. Go up to Cong, and walk out to the place where Lord Mountmorres\r\nwas murdered, near Clonbur. His whole income was £150 or £200, a poor\r\nallowance for a peer, one of the noble house of De Montmorency. He was\r\nshot in broad daylight, a dozen houses within call, and an open\r\nuncovered country, save for low stone walls, all around. The people\r\ndanced in derision on the spot where he fell, and threw soil stained\r\nwith his life blood in the air. He wanted his due, and, goodness\r\nknows, he was poor enough to satisfy oven an Irish agitator. His name\r\nwas down for the next vacancy among the resident magistrates. The\r\npeople who were guilty of inciting to those outrages are the most\r\nprominent of the Nationalist party. Is this the class of men you wish\r\nto set over us as governors?\"\r\n\r\nAn artist named Hamilton, a Guernsey man, said, \"The English people do\r\nnot understand what stonethrowing means in Ireland. They read of rows,\r\nand so long as no shooting is done, they do not think it serious. The\r\nmen of Connaught are wonderful shots with big stones, and you would be\r\nsurprised at the force and precision with which they hurl great lumps\r\nof rock weighing three or four pounds. Poor Corbett, a man in Lord\r\nArdilaun's employ, was killed outright by one of these missiles, and\r\nonly the other day I was reading of the Connaught Rangers in Egypt,\r\nthe old 88th, how they were short of ammunition at the battle of\r\nAboukir, and how they tore down a wall and actually stopped the\r\nFrench, who were advancing with the bayonet.\"\r\n\r\nA Galway merchant said:--\"Balfour is the man for Ireland. A\r\nNationalist member told me he was the cleverest man in the House. He\r\nsaid, 'Chamberlain goes in for hard hitting, and he is very effective,\r\nbut nobody ever answered the Irish members so readily and smartly as\r\nBalfour. We thought twice before we framed our questions, and although\r\nwe of course disapprove of him, we are bound to admire him immensely.'\r\nAnd as a business man I think Balfour was fully up to the mark. He it\r\nwas who subsidised the Midland and Western Railway to build the light\r\nline now being made between Galway and Clifden. No company would have\r\nundertaken such a concern. As a mere business transaction it could not\r\npay. But look at the good that is being done. The people were starving\r\nfor want of employment, and no unskilled labour is imported to the\r\ndistrict, so that the Connemara folks get the benefit of the work, and\r\nalso a permanent advantage by the opening up of the Galway fisheries,\r\nwhich are practically inexhaustible. We have the Atlantic to go at.\r\nAnd the fish out of the deep, strong, running water are twice as big\r\nas those just off the coast, on herring-banks and shoals. The\r\nfishermen know this, and they call these places the mackerel hospitals\r\nand infirmaries. These fishermen always knew it, but they had no boats\r\nto go out to the deep seas, no nets, no tackle. They have them now,\r\nand they got them from Balfour. They get nothing but Home Rule from\r\nMorley and Gladstone, and they find it keeps them free from\r\nindigestion, although it puts their livers out of order. Amusing\r\nchaps, these fishermen. I was in a little country place on the coast,\r\nwhere the judicial and magisterial proceedings are of a very primitive\r\ncharacter, and where most of the people speak Irish as their\r\nvernacular. One old chap declined to give evidence in English, and\r\nasked for an interpreter. The magistrate, who knew the old wag, said,\r\n'Michael Cahill, you speak English very well,' to which the old man\r\nreplied, ''Tis not for the likes o' me to conthradict yer honner, but\r\ndivil resave the word iv it I ondhersthand at all, at all.' There was\r\na great roar from the Court, and the interpreter was trotted forward.\r\nAnother witness was said to have been drunk, but he claimed to be a\r\ntemperance man. 'What do you drink,' said the magistrate. 'Wather, yer\r\nhonner,' said the total abstainer. 'Jist pure wather from the spring\r\nthere beyant,' and then he looked round the Court, and slyly added,\r\n'Wid jist as much whiskey as will take off the earthy taste, yer\r\nhonner.' He was like the temperance lecturer who preached round\r\nGalway, and was afterwards seen crushing sugar in a stiff glass of the\r\ncrathur at Oughterard. When he was caught redhanded, as it were, he\r\nsaid, 'To be sure I'm a timprance man, but, bedad, ye can't say that\r\nI'm a bigoted one'!\r\n\r\n\"We want Morley to give us a light railway from Clifden to Westport,\r\nand then we'd have the whole coast supplied. But he's a tight-fisted\r\none as regards practical work. We've no chance with him, except in\r\nmatters of sentiment. He wants to give Home Rule, but we can't eat\r\nthat. And my impression is that we are fast drifting into the position\r\nof the man who has nothing, and from whom shall be taken the little\r\nthat he hath. As to arguments against Home Rule, I do not think it a\r\ncase for argument. That the thing is bad is self-evident; and\r\nself-evident propositions, whether in Euclid or elsewhere, are always\r\nthe most difficult to prove. Ask me to prove that two added to two\r\nmake four, ask me how many beans make five, and I gracefully retire.\r\nAsk me to show that Home Rule will be bad for Ireland, and I will make\r\nbut a slight departure from this formula. I say, on the supporters of\r\nHome Rule rests the _onus probandi_; they are the people who should\r\nshow cause, let them prove their case in its favour. Here I am, quite\r\nsatisfied with the laws as they now are. Show me, say I, how I shall\r\nbenefit by the proposed change. That knocks them speechless. In\r\nEngland they may make a pretence of proving their case, but in this\r\ncountry they are dumb in the presence of Unionists. They cannot argue\r\nwith enlightened people. They have not a leg to stand upon, and they\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\n\"Consider the fulminations of Archbishop Walsh with regard to that\r\nDublin Freemason Bazaar in aid of orphan children. As you must have\r\nheard, the Sacraments were refused to any Catholic attending this\r\npurely charitable movement. The Church said in effect--Any one who\r\naids the orphans of freemasons by going to this bazaar, or by\r\npatronising the function, whether directly or indirectly, will be\r\ndamned everlastingly. And the Catholics kept away, frightened by this\r\nthreat. What would you expect of a people who believe such rubbish? Do\r\nyou think that a people powerfully influenced, supremely influenced,\r\nby the word of a priest are fit to govern themselves? Can you depend\r\non the loyalty of the Catholic priesthood? You surely know better than\r\nthat. Suppose you gave Ireland Home Rule, and the Church turned rusty?\r\nWith matters in the hands of an Irish Parliament, who would have the\r\npull in weight of influence, John Bull or the priests? You are\r\nwalking into a snare with your eyes open. Soon you will be punching\r\nyour own head and calling yourself a fool. And you will be quite\r\nright. England is giving herself away at the bidding of a crowd of\r\nfellows who in Ireland are not received into decent society, and few\r\nof whom could get 'tick' for a week's board or a week's washing. Not\r\nthat the latter would be much hardship. Clean linen is a novelty to\r\nthe bulk of them. And seventy-one out of eighty of these upstarts must\r\ndo the bidding of the priests.\r\n\r\n\"Poor old Bull! The fine fellow he was. Respected by everybody. Strong\r\nbut good-humoured, never hurting a soul. Slapping his breeches pocket\r\nnow and then, and looking round the world with an eye that seemed to\r\nsay, 'I could buy and sell the lot of ye; look what a fine fellow I\r\nam!' And he was. And he knew it, too. His only fault. Ready to lend a\r\ndeserving friend a trifle, and apt to poke his nose into what didn't\r\nconcern him, especially when a small country was being put upon. Then\r\nJohn would come up and say, 'Let him alone, will yer.' A\r\nlaughing-stock in his old age. But yesterday he might have stood\r\nbefore the world: now none so poor to do him reverence,--Shakespeare!\r\nThat's what's coming. Poor old Bull! In his dotage making a rod to\r\nwhip himself. Well, well.\"\r\n\r\nThere are Presbyterians at Salthill. Wherever they are they always\r\nwear good coats, have good houses, well-clad children. To be\r\ncomfortably off seems part of their creed. One of them said, \"There\r\nnever was a more faithful worshipper of the Grand Old Man than\r\nmyself,--up to a certain time, I mean. I dropped him before he went\r\nover to Parnell. I gave him up on account of his inconsistency. What\r\nstaggered me was a trick he tried to play the Queen's College\r\narrangements in Ireland. It was a supplemental charter really changing\r\nthe whole constitution of the thing, and he tried to carry his point\r\nby a dodge. I did not care much about the matter one way or the other,\r\nbut I thought his underhanded trickery unworthy a statesman, or any\r\nother man. I tried not to believe it; that is, I would rather not have\r\nbelieved it. I had a sort of feeling that it couldn't be. But it was\r\nso. Then his pamphlet about Vaticanism, in which he said no Roman\r\nCatholic could be loyal, after which he appointed the Marquess of\r\nRipon, a Catholic convert, or pervert, to the Governor-Generalship of\r\nIndia, the most important office in the gift of the Crown. Again, I\r\nhad no objection to the action in itself, but I considered it from Mr.\r\nGladstone's point of view, and then it dawned on me that he would say\r\nanything. You never know what he'll do next. What he says is no guide\r\nat all nowadays to what he'll do. He was my hero, but a change has\r\ncome over him, and now he cannot be trusted. He ought to be looked\r\nafter in some public institution where the keepers wouldn't contradict\r\nhim. He was a great man before his mind gave way.\"\r\n\r\nA bustling Belfaster of fatiguing vitality told me this little story\r\nwhich my friends the Catholic clergy may disprove if they can. He\r\nsaid:--\"Mr. McMaster, of the firm of Dunbar, McMaster and Co., of\r\nGilford, County Down, conceived the idea of aiding his fellow-countrymen\r\nand women who were starving in the congested districts. This was some\r\ntime ago, but it is a good illustration of the difficulty you have in\r\nhelping people who will not help themselves. He drew up a scheme, well\r\nthought-out and workable, such as a thorough business man might be\r\nexpected to concoct, and sent down his agent to the districts of\r\nGweedore in Donegal and Maam in Galway, with instructions to engage as\r\nmany families as possible to work in the mills of the firm, noted all\r\nover the world for thread, yarn, and linen-weaving. An enormous affair,\r\nemploying a whole township. The agent was provided with a document\r\nemanating from the priest of the district into which they were invited\r\nto migrate, setting forth that no proselytism was intended, and that\r\nthe migrants would be under the care of Catholic clergy. As they had\r\nneither money nor furniture worth moving, it was agreed to pay the cost\r\nof transit, and to provide clean, sweet cottages, ready furnished, and\r\nwith every reasonable convenience. The furniture was to be paid for by\r\ninstalments, but the cost of removal was to be a gift from Mr.\r\nMcMaster, who was desirous of aiding the people without pauperising\r\nthem. They were to work the ordinary factory hours, as enacted by\r\nstatute, and to be paid the ordinary wages. But they were required to\r\nwork regularly. No saints' days, no lounging about on the \"pattherns\"\r\n(patron saints' days), no in-and-out running, but steady, regular\r\nattendance. People who knew the Keltic Irish laughed at Mr. McMaster,\r\nbut he had seen their poverty, their filth, their mud cabins, their\r\nsemi-starvation, and he thought he knew. He offered them work, and\r\neverything they seemed to want, out of pure humanity.\r\n\r\n\"How many people moved to Gilford out of the two counties?\"\r\n\r\n\"Peradventure there might be a hundred found, peradventure there might\r\nbe fifty, thirty, twenty, ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess again. Give it up? Not a single solitary soul accepted Mr.\r\nMcMaster's offer. These are the people who are waiting for Home Rule.\r\nMuch good may it do them.\"\r\n\r\nA little Galway man became irate. \"'Tis our birthright to hate\r\nEngland. That's why we want Home Rule that we may tache thim their\r\nplace. I'd fight England, an' I'd do more.\" Here he looked sternly at\r\nthe Ulsterman. \"I'd do more, I say, I'd fight thim that'd shtand up\r\nfor her. D'ye see me now?\"\r\n\r\nThe Belfast man proved an awkward customer. He said, \"You're too busy\r\nto fight anybody just now, you Nationalists. Wait till you've settled\r\nyour differences, wait till you've cut each other's throats, wait till\r\nyou've fought over the plunder, like the Kilkenny cats, till there's\r\nnothing left of you but the tail. Then we'll send down an army of owld\r\nwomen with besoms to sweep ye into the Atlantic. 'Twill be the first\r\nbath your Army of Independence ever got. 'Twill cool their courage and\r\nclean their hides at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nThe small Separatist was about to make an angry reply, when I\r\ninterposed with an inquiry as to his estimate of Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the little man, with a pucker of his little nose, and a\r\ngrand gesture of contempt, \"sure he's not worth as much powdher as\r\nwould blow him to hell.\"\r\n\r\nHis sentiment lacks novelty, but I quote him for the picturesqueness\r\nof his style.\r\n\r\nSalthill, May 18th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 24.--THE ARAN ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Aran Islanders seem to have passed most of their time in a state\r\nof chronic starvation. The land seems to grow little but rock, and the\r\nburning of seaweed, the kelp trade, does not seem to have helped them\r\nmuch. True, the Atlantic was all before them, where to choose, but\r\nwhat Father Mahony would call the teeming treasures of the deep were\r\npractically left untouched. If we accept the plain meaning of the good\r\npriest's speech, we must believe that the Aran Islanders and Irish\r\nfishermen generally preferred to starve rather than to catch fish,\r\nunless an Irish Parliament were fixed on College Green. They had no\r\nobjection to accept charitable aid, no matter from what quarter it\r\ncame, and the Araners required assistance every other year. They were\r\nnot unwilling to catch fish, but they had nothing to catch them with;\r\nand, strange as it may seem, these islanders, who could scarcely move\r\nfive yards in any direction without falling into the sea, these\r\namphibious Irishmen, did not know the art of catching fish! They\r\ntinkered and slopped around the shoals in the vicinity of the island,\r\nbut they were never able to catch enough fish to keep themselves from\r\nstarvation, much less to supply the Dublin and London markets. Their\r\nboats were the most primitive affairs imaginable, and showed the Irish\r\nspirit of conservatism to perfection. These coraghs are practically\r\nthe same boat as the Welsh coracle, but much larger. Those I examined\r\nwere from ten to fifteen feet long and three feet wide. Oak ribs, over\r\nwhich are nailed laths of white deal, two inches wide and half an inch\r\nthick. Cover this slight skeleton with tarred canvas, and the ship is\r\nnearly complete. It only needs two pairs of wooden thole-pins, and two\r\npairs of oars, long, light, and thin, coming nearly to a point at the\r\nwater-end, having a perforated block which works on the thole-pins\r\nbefore-mentioned. You want no keel, no helm, no mast. Stay! You need a\r\nboard or two for seats for the oarsmen. With these frail cockleshells\r\nthe Araners adventure themselves twelve miles on the Atlantic, and\r\nmostly come home again. These makeshift canoes are almost useless for\r\ncatching fish. Having no helm, it is hard to keep them straight;\r\nhaving no keel, it is needful to sit still, or at any rate to maintain\r\na perfect balance, or over you go. A gust of wind spins the canoe\r\nround like a top. These primeval boats are made on the island, thrown\r\ntogether out of fifteen-pennyworth of wood, a few yards of canvas, and\r\na pitch-pot. They have some virtues. They are cheap, and they will not\r\nsink. The coraghs always come back, even if bottom up. And when they\r\nreach the shore the two occupants (if any) invert the ship, stick a\r\nhead in the stem and another in the stern, and carry her home to tea.\r\nThis process is apt to puzzle the uninformed visitor, who sees a\r\nstrange and fearful animal, like a huge black-beetle, crawling up the\r\ncliffs. He begins to think of \"antres huge and deserts vast, and\r\nanthropophagi, and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders.\"\r\nHe hesitates about landing, but if he be on the Duras, Captain Neal\r\nDelargy, who equally scoffs at big beetles and Home Rule, will\r\nexplain, and will accompany him to the tavern on the cliff side, where\r\nthey charge ordinary prices for beer and give you bread-and-cheese for\r\nnothing. And yet the Araners profess to be civilised.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of his policy of helping the people to help themselves,\r\nMr. Balfour determined to educate the Araners, and to give them\r\nsufficient help in the matter of boats and tackle to make their\r\neducation of some avail. It was useless to give them boats and nets,\r\nfor they knew not how to use them, and it is certain that any boat\r\nclub on the Birmingham Reservoir, or any tripper who has gone mackerel\r\nfishing in Douglas Bay, could have given these fishermen much valuable\r\ninformation and instruction. Having once determined to attempt on a\r\ntolerably large scale the establishment of a fresh mackerel and fresh\r\nherring trade with England, Mr. Balfour set about the gigantic and\r\ndiscouraging task of endeavouring nothing less than the creation of\r\nthe local industry. But how were the people to be taught the\r\nmanagement of large boats, and the kind of nets that were used? After\r\nmuch inquiry, it was decided to subsidise trained crews from other\r\nparts of Ireland to show the local fishermen what earnings might be\r\ntheirs, and at the same time to impart needful instruction to the\r\nConnemara and Aran people. It was also arranged to make loans for the\r\npurchase of boats and tackle to such persons as might prove likely to\r\nbenefit by them. Accordingly arrangements were made with the crews of\r\nseven Arklow boats to proceed to the Aran Islands, and in order to\r\nindemnify them for the risk of working on an untried fishing ground,\r\neach crew received a bounty of £40 from the Congested Districts Board.\r\nBut there was no use in catching fish unless it could be quickly put\r\non the market, and again the necessary plant proved a matter involving\r\nconsiderable expenditure. A derelict Norwegian ship, which two or\r\nthree years ago had been discovered at sea and towed into Queenstown\r\nHarbour, was purchased from the salvors, and anchored in Killeany Bay,\r\noutside the harbour of Kilronane, the capital city of the biggest\r\nAran, as an ice-hulk. The Board then entered into an agreement with\r\nMr. W.W. Harvey, of Cork, to market the mackerel at a fixed rate of\r\ncommission, it being also arranged that he should pay the fishermen\r\nthe English market price less by a deduction of 7s. a box to cover\r\nthe cost of ice-packing, carriage, and English salesman's commission.\r\nThe ice-hulk and boxes were provided by the Board, but Mr. Harvey was\r\nto purchase the ice and defray all the cost of labour except the\r\nsalary of a manager.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the seven Arklow crews two boats were fitted out by\r\nMiss Mansfield for training crews from the parish of Carna, in\r\nConnemara; and Miss Skerritt also placed two English-built boats at\r\nthe Board's disposal for the training of crews from the pretty\r\nwatering place of Clifden, also in Connemara. An Aran hooker,\r\nbelonging to Innishmore, joined the little fishing fleet, bringing up\r\nthe number to exactly a dozen boats. The Rev. W.S. Green, a Protestant\r\nparson, who is said to have first discovered these fishing grounds,\r\nand who threw himself into the work with wonderful enthusiasm,\r\nsuperintended the experiment in the steamer Fingal, which was\r\nspecially chartered for the purpose. Mr. Green as a skilled Fisheries\r\nInspector, knew what he was about, and he was empowered to lend nets,\r\nwhere advisable, to the Aran beginners. Away they went to sea, to\r\nstart with a fortnight's heart-breaking luck. The water in those\r\nregions was cold, and the fish were amusing themselves elsewhere. The\r\nice-hulk with its two hundred tons of Norwegian ice was waiting, and\r\nits staff of packers might cool their ardour in the hold. The mackerel\r\nwould not come to be packed, and the dozen boats, with their master\r\nand apprentice crews, cruised up and down on the deep blue sea, with\r\nthe blue sky overhead, and hope, like Bob Acres' valour, gradually\r\noozing out of their finger-ends. The Arklow men began to talk of going\r\nhome again. Altogether it was a blue look-out.\r\n\r\nAt last the luck turned. On April 6th, 1892, six thousand mackerel\r\nwere despatched to the English market. The weather during much of the\r\nseason was stormy and unfavourable, but on May 18th, seventy-three\r\nthousand three hundred and fifty mackerel were sent to Galway, thirty\r\nmiles away by sea, and were forwarded thence by two special trains.\r\nThe Midland and Western Railway, under the management of Mr. Joseph\r\nTatlow, has been prompt, plucky, and obliging, and runs the fish to\r\nDublin as fast as they arrive in Galway. During the season of ten\r\nweeks the experienced Arklow crews made on an average £316 per boat,\r\nand the greenhorns who were learning the business earned about £70 per\r\nboat, although they could not fish at all at the beginning of the\r\nseason. The total number of mackerel packed on the ice-hulk amounted\r\nto the respectable total of two hundred and ninety-nine thousand four\r\nhundred and eighty. The \"teeming treasures of the deep\" were not left\r\nuntouched on this occasion, though, doubtless, \"still the Irish\r\npeasant mourns, still groans beneath the cruel English yoke.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour's benefactions have not been confined to the Aran Islands.\r\nEvery available fishing place from top to bottom of the whole west\r\ncoast has been similarly aided, and the value of their produce has\r\nincreased from next to nothing to something like fifty thousand\r\npounds per month. This on the authority of Father P.J. McPhilpin,\r\nparish priest of Kilronane, Innishmore, who said:--\r\n\r\n\"We never had a Chief Secretary who so quickly grasped the position,\r\nwho so rapidly saw what was the right thing to do, and who did it so\r\nthoroughly and so promptly. Strange to say the Liberals are always the\r\nmost illiberal. When we get anything for Ireland it somehow always\r\nseems to come from the Tories.\"\r\n\r\nHaving been carried from Galway to the ice-hulk in Killeany Bay, and\r\nhaving been duly put ashore in a boat, one of the first persons I saw\r\nwas Father Thomas Flatley, coadjutor of Father McPhilpin, an earnest\r\nHome Ruler, like his superior, and like him a great admirer of Mr.\r\nBalfour. Father Flatley wore a yachting cap, or I might have sheered\r\noff under all sail--the biretta inspires me with affright--but his\r\nnautical rig reassured me, and yawing a little from my course, I put\r\nup my helm and boarded him. Too late I saw the black flag--I mean the\r\nwhite choker--but there was nothing of the pirate about Father Tom. He\r\nwas kindly, courteous, earnest, humorous, hospitable, and full of\r\nLatin quotations. Before our acquaintance was two minutes old he\r\ninvited me to dinner. Then I ran aground on an Arklow boatman, James\r\nDoyle by name, a smart tweed-suited sailor, bright and gay. The Post\r\nOffice was near, and the letters were being given out. Three\r\ndeliveries a week, weather permitting. The parish priest was there,\r\ngrave, refined, slightly ascetic, with the azure blue eyes so common\r\nin Connaught, never seen in England, although frequently met with in\r\nNorway and North Germany. The waiting-women were barefoot, but all the\r\nmen were shod. The Araners have a speciality in shoes--pampooties, to\r\nwit. These are made of raw hide, hair outwards, the toe-piece drawn\r\nin, and the whole tied on with string or sinew. The cottages are\r\nbetter built than many on the mainland. Otherwise the winter gales\r\nwould blow them into the Atlantic main. The thatch is pegged down\r\nfirmly, and then tied on with a close network of ropes. The people are\r\nclean, smart, and good-looking. Miss Margaret Flanagan, who escorted\r\nme in my search after pampooties, would pass for a pretty girl\r\nanywhere, and the Aran Irish flowed from her lips like a rivulet of\r\ncream. She spoke English too. An accomplished young lady, Miss\r\nMargaret Kilmartin, aged nineteen, said her father had been wrongfully\r\nimprisoned for two and a half years for shooting a bailiff. The\r\nnational sports are therefore not altogether unknown in the Arans.\r\nMiss Kilmartin was _en route_ for America, per Teutonic, first to New\r\nYork, and then a thousand miles by rail, alone, and without a bonnet.\r\nShe had never been off the island. This little run would be her first\r\nflutter from the paternal nest.\r\n\r\nThe Araners know little of politics, save that the Balfour Government\r\nlifted them out of the horrible pit and the miry clay, and set their\r\nfeet upon a rock and established their goings. The Balfour boats are\r\nthere, the Balfour nets are full of fish, the Balfour boys are\r\nlearning a useful occupation, and earning money meanwhile. If there is\r\nanything in the Aran cupboards, the Araners know who enabled them to\r\nput it there. If the young ladies have new shoes, new shawls, new\r\nbrooches; if the Aran belles make money by mending nets; if the men\r\nsometimes see beef; if they compass the thick twist; if they manage\r\nwithout the everlasting hat going round, they have Mr. Balfour to\r\nthank, and they know it. They own it, not grudgingly or of necessity,\r\nbut cheerfully. One battered old wreck raised his hat at every mention\r\nof the name. I saw no Morley boats. I saw no Gladstone nets. I saw no\r\nHome Rule fish. The Araners do not care for the Grand Old Mendacium.\r\nPerhaps they lack patriotism. It may be that they do not share what\r\nMr. Gladstone calls the Aspirations of a people. So far as I could\r\njudge, their principal aspiration is to get something to eat. A\r\npampootied native who has often visited the main-land, and is\r\nevidently looked upon as a mountain of sagacity and superior wisdom,\r\nsaid to me--\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit they care but to look afther the wife and childher an' pray\r\nto God for good takes o' fish. An' small blame to thim. Before Balfour\r\nthe people were starvin', an' ivery other year Father Davis that's\r\ndead this six months would go round beggin' an' prayin' for a thrifle\r\nto kape life in thim. The hardships and the misery the poor folks had,\r\nGod alone knows. An' would ye say to thim, 'tis Home Rule ye want?\r\n\r\n\"There was a young fellow fishin' here from Dublin. He went out in the\r\nhookers an' injoyed himself all to pieces, a dacent sthrip of a boy,\r\nbut wid no more brains than a scalpeen (pickled mackerel). He got me\r\nto be interpreter to an owld man that would spake wid him over on\r\nInnishmair, an' the owld chap wos tellin' his throubles. So afther a\r\nbit, the young fellow says, says he,\r\n\r\n\"''Tis Home Rule ye want,' says he.\r\n\r\n\"'No,' says the owld chap, shakin' his head, 'tis my dinner I want,'\r\nsays he.\r\n\r\n\"An' that young fellow was mad whin I thranslated it. But 'twas thrue,\r\nivery word iv it. 'Ah! the ignorance, the ignorance,' says he. But\r\nthen he was spakin' on a full stomach, an' 'tis ill arguin' betwixt a\r\nfull man and a fastin'.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't say but they'd take more notice afther a while. But\r\nthey're not used to bein' prosperous, an' they don't know themselves\r\nat all. Ye can't cultivate politics on low feed. 'Tis the high livin'\r\nthat makes the Parliamint men that can talk for twenty-four hours at a\r\nsthretch. An' these chaps is gettin' their backs up. In twelve months'\r\ntime they'll be gettin' consated. 'Tis Balfour that's feedin' thim\r\ninto condition. Vote against him? Av coorse they will, ivery man o'\r\nthim. Sure they'll be towld to vote for a man, an' they'll do it. How\r\nwould they ondhersthand at all? Av 'twas Misther Balfour himself that\r\nwanted their vote he'd get it fast enough. But 'tisn't. An' they'll\r\nvote agin' him without knowin' what they're doin'.\"\r\n\r\nFather McPhilpin said, \"It is very hard to get them to move. The\r\nIrish people are the most conservative in the world. They will not\r\nstir for telling, and they will not stir when you take them by the\r\ncollar and haul them along. They are wedded to the customs of their\r\nancestors; and yet, when once they see the advantage to be obtained by\r\nany given change, no people are so quick to follow it up. The\r\ndifficulty is to start them. The Araners had actually less knowledge\r\nof the sea, of boats, nets, and fishing, than people coming here from\r\nan inland place. Surprising, but quite true.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking on the general question of Home Rule, I asked Father\r\nMcPhilpin if the people of Ireland would be loyal.\r\n\r\n\"Loyal to what?\" said the Father, replying quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Loyal to England, to the Crown, to Queen Victoria.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Irish people have always been loyal--much more loyal than the\r\nEnglish people. You have only to look at English history. How far\r\nshall I go back, Father Tom?\" said my genial host to the coadjutor,\r\nwho just then entered the room. \"Shall we go back to Henry II.? Where\r\nshall we begin, Father Tom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Father Tom, \"I'd not be for going back quite so far. I\r\nthink if we began with Charles I.----\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good. Now, were not the Irish loyal when the English people\r\ndisloyally favoured their Oliver Cromwell and their William the\r\nThird?\"\r\n\r\nI proceeded with the imbibition of Father McPhilpin's excellent tea.\r\nThe answer was obvious, but Father Tom clearly believed that his\r\nsenior had me on the hip, and good-naturedly came in with a Latin\r\nquotation or two. Both clerics were deeply interested in the condition\r\nof the poor in their charge, and indeed all over Ireland, and their\r\nprofound belief that a Home Rule Bill would benefit the poorer\r\nclasses, by changing the conditions affecting the tenure or ownership\r\nof land, was apparently their chief reason for advocating a College\r\nGreen Parliament. Father McPhilpin holds some honorary official\r\nposition in connection with the Aran fisheries, and from him I derived\r\nmost of my information. Another authority assured me that the Araners\r\nwere not grateful to England nor to Mr. Balfour, and spoke of the\r\nviper that somebody warmed in his bosom with disagreeable results.\r\nBut, as Father Tom would say, _Omnis comparatio claudicat_, and all my\r\nexperience points to a proper appreciation of the great ex-Secretary's\r\ndesire to do the country good. The people know how thoroughly he\r\nexamined the subject; how he spent weeks in the Congested Districts;\r\nhow he saw the parish priests, the head men of the districts, the\r\ncotters themselves. Every Irishman, whatever his politics, will\r\nreadily agree that Mr. Balfour knows more about Ireland than any\r\nEnglishman living, and most of them credit him with more knowledge of\r\nthe subject than any Irishman. My thorough-going friend, Mr. McCoy, of\r\nGalway, hater of England, avowed Separatist, longing to wallow in the\r\nbrutal Saxon's gore, thinks Mr. Balfour the best friend that Ireland\r\never had. \"I'd agree with you there,\" said Mr. McCoy. \"I don't agree\r\nwith charity, but I agree with putting people in a way to do things\r\nfor themselves, which is what Mr. Balfour has done.\"\r\n\r\nBack on the ice-hulk by favour of Thomas Joyce, of Kilronane, skipper\r\nand owner of a fishing smack. Mr. William Fitzgerald showed the\r\nfactory, the great hold with the ice, the windmill which pumps the\r\nhulk, the mountains of boxes for fish, the mackerel in process of\r\npacking, sixty in a box, most of them very large fish. An unhappy\r\nhalibut, which had come to an untimely end, stood on his tail in a\r\nnarrow basket, his mouth wide open, looking like a Home Rule orator\r\ndescanting on the woes of Ireland. He was slapped into a box and\r\ninstantly nailed down, which summary process suggested an obvious\r\nwish.\r\n\r\nMr. Fitzgerald said: \"The fisheries have been a great success, and\r\nhave done much good. The spring fishery paid well on account of the\r\ngreat price we got for the mackerel. It is not customary to catch fish\r\nso early, but when you can do it it pays splendidly. Just now the\r\nprice is not up to the mark, but we hope for better times. The Arklow\r\nmen are not subsidised this year. They didn't need it. The ground\r\nproved productive, and they were glad to come on their own hook. If\r\nthey had required a second subsidy they would not have got it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm no politician,\" said Mr. Fitzgerald. \"The Araners are so strong\r\nand hardy that they would surprise you. They will stand all day on the\r\nice, with nothing on but those pampooties, and you would think they'd\r\nneed iron soles, instead of a bit of skin. They work hard, and come\r\nregularly and give no trouble. No, I could not find any fault with\r\nthem. They mostly speak Irish among themselves. It's Greek to me, but\r\nI can make out that they think a great deal of Mr. Balfour.\"\r\n\r\nA week on the hulk would be refreshing, for on one side there is no\r\nland nearer than America. However, I have to go, for the Duras is\r\ngetting uneasy, so I leave the hulk, the mackerel, the big sea trout\r\nwhich are caught with the mackerel, and steam back to Galway. A\r\nsplendid fellow in the cabin discloses his views. \"We must have\r\ncomplete independence. We shall start with 120,000 men for the Army of\r\nIndependence. That will be only a nucleus. We shall attract all the\r\nbrave, chivalrous, adventurous spirits of America. England has India\r\nto draw from. Trot your niggers over, we'll make short work of them.\r\nWe draw from America, Australia, every part of the world. We draw from\r\n24,000,000 of Irishmen all willing to fight for nothing, and even to\r\npay money to be allowed to fight against England. An Irish Republic,\r\nunder the protection of America. That's the idea. It's the natural\r\nthing. Work the two countries together and England may slide. We'll\r\nhave an Independent Irish Republic in four years; perhaps in three\r\nyears. Rubbish about pledges of loyalty. The people must be loyal to\r\nthemselves, not to England. Our members will do what the people want,\r\nor they will be replaced by men who will. We have the sentiments of\r\nthe people, backed by the influence of religion, all tending to\r\ncomplete independence. Who's going to prevent it? We'll have a\r\nDeclaration of Independence on Saint Patrick's Day, 1897, at latest.\r\nWho'll stop it? Mr. Gladstone? Why long before that time we'll convert\r\nhim, and ten to one he'll draw up the document. What'll you bet that\r\nhe doesn't come over to Dublin and read it in THE HOUSE?\"\r\n\r\nGalway, May 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 25.--THE PRIESTS AND OUTRAGE. THEY NEVER CONDEMNED IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Moycullen with whom I have spent a day are hardly\r\npatriotic. So far as I can gather, they have always paid their rents\r\nand worked hard for their living. They know nothing of Home Rule, and\r\nthey do not murder their friends and neighbours. They send forth a\r\nstrong contingent of men to work on Mr. Balfour's railway between\r\nGalway and Clifden, and find the weekly wages there earned very\r\nconvenient. They vote as they are told, and do not trouble themselves\r\nwith matters which are too high for them. If a candidate proposes to\r\nmake the land much cheaper, or even to spare the necessity of paying\r\nany rent at all, the Moyculleners give him their voice. Like every\r\nCatholic villager in Ireland they look to Father Pat, Tom, Dick, or\r\nHarry for advice, and the good priest gives them the right tip. He\r\npoints out that Micky O'Codlin promises to support such legislation as\r\nshall place the land in the hands of the tillers of the soil, while\r\nthe Protestant Short declares that the thing is not honest, and cannot\r\nbe done. The result is precisely what might be expected. The\r\nNationalist members are returned, and Mr. Gladstone, with his most\r\ngrandiose manner, and with the abject magnanimity he always shows when\r\nthoroughly beaten, comes forward and declares he can no longer resist\r\nthe aspirations of a people. The Separatist sheep tumble over each\r\nother in their nervous anxiety to keep close on the heels of the\r\nbell-wether, and the Empire is threatened with disintegration to suit\r\nthe convenience of a party of priests. An eminent Roman Catholic\r\nlawyer of Dublin, a Home Ruler, said to me:--\r\n\r\n\"I vote for Home Rule because the sooner the thing is settled the\r\nbetter, and it will never be settled until we get Home Rule in some\r\nform or other. The country is weary of the agitation of the last\r\ntwenty years, and I am of opinion that Home Rule would do much to\r\nrestore the freedom of Ireland. For Ireland is in a state of\r\nslavery--not to England, but to the priesthood. I believe in the\r\nfundamental doctrines of the faith, but I don't believe everything the\r\npriests choose to tell me. I am ready to admit that they have more\r\nspiritual gifts and graces than anybody else, but I will not believe\r\nthat they know more about politics, and I will not submit to their\r\ndictation. They control the course of affairs both sacred and secular.\r\nAt the present moment they are running the British Empire. You cannot\r\nget away from the fact that they return the Irish majority, and you\r\nwill admit that the Irish majority is now the ruling power. Let me\r\nillustrate my point.\r\n\r\n\"You in England think we have the franchise in Ireland. Nothing of the\r\nkind. There may be a hundred thousand in the North who vote as they\r\nthink proper, but an overwhelming majority of the South are absolutely\r\nin the hands of the clergy, who in many cases lead or drive them in\r\nhundreds to the poll.\"\r\n\r\nHere an English civil engineer said:--\"When I was engaged on a line at\r\nMayo I actually saw the priest walking in front of some hundreds of\r\nvoters brought into the town from the rural districts. I was driving\r\nalong in a car, and my driver shouted 'Parnell for ever!' He was\r\nstruck on the head and face, his cheek cut open, and himself knocked\r\noff the car. How the priestly party do hate the Parnellites! I wonder\r\nwhat would happen if the Nationalists got into power.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would exterminate each other, if possible,\" said the Dublin man.\r\n\"We should have an awful ferment, a chaos, an immediate bankruptcy.\r\nBut let us have it. Let us make the experiment, and thus for ever\r\nsettle the question. To return to the priests. The people of Ireland\r\nhave not the franchise, which is monopolised by a few thousand priests\r\nand bishops. The Nationalist members, the dauntless seventy-one, are\r\nas much the nominees of the Catholic clergy as the old pocket-borough\r\nmembers were nominees of the local landlords. And the same thing will\r\nhold good in future. People tell you it will not be so, but that's all\r\nhumbug. It may be different in five-and-twenty years, when the people\r\nare educated, when the National Schools have done their work, but half\r\nthat time is enough to ruin England. Thanks to agitators, Ireland\r\ncannot be any worse off than she is.\"\r\n\r\nSome time ago there was a Convention in Dublin, a Home Rule\r\nConvention. There were five hundred delegates, sent up by the votes of\r\nthe people. Four hundred and nine were priests, who had returned\r\nthemselves. Can the English Gladstonians get away from the\r\nsuggestiveness of this fact? Is it sufficiently symptomatic? Can they\r\nnot diagnose the progress of the disease?\r\n\r\nOne of the Galway Town Commissioners, also a Roman Catholic, declared\r\nthat the Irish people, once the kindliest, most honest, most\r\nconscientious amongst the nations of the earth, had for years been\r\ntaught a doctrine of malevolence. \"They were naturally benevolent, but\r\ntheir nature has been changed, and I regret to say that in a large\r\nmeasure the priests are responsible for the change. Where once mutual\r\nhelp and perfect honesty reigned, you now find selfishness and mutual\r\ndistrust. The priests have made the altar a hustings, and even worse\r\nthan electioneering has been done on that sacred spot. From the altar\r\nhave been denounced old friends and neighbours who had dared to have\r\nan opinion of their own, had dared to show an independent spirit, and\r\nto hold on what they thought the true course in spite of the\r\nblackguard population of the district. Take the case of O'Mara, of\r\nParsonstown. He was the principal merchant of the place, a very kindly\r\nman, of decided politics, a Catholic Conservative, like myself. He\r\nsold provisions to what the local priest called the 'helmeted minions\r\nof our Saxon taskmasters.' In other words, he sold bread to the\r\nconstabulary at a time when outrage and murder were being put down\r\nwith a strong hand. The priest threatened him with boycotting, his\r\nfriends urged him to give way, and let the police get their 'prog'\r\nfrom a distance, but O'Mara, who was an easy-going man, and who had\r\nnever obtruded his politics on anyone, showed an unexpected obstinacy,\r\nand said he would do as he chose, spite of all the priests on earth.\r\nThey denounced him from the altar, but, although they tried hard, they\r\nfailed to ruin him. In other cases, clerical influence has dragged men\r\nfrom positions of competency and caused them to end their days in the\r\nworkhouse. Then, again, the priests never denounced outrage. They\r\nmight have stopped the fiendish deeds of the murderous blackguards\r\nwhose evil propensities were fostered and utilised by the Land League,\r\nbut they said no word of disapproval. On the contrary they tacitly\r\nfavoured, or seemed to favour, the most awful assassinations. When the\r\nPhoenix Park murders took place, a Galway priest whom I will not\r\nname said that he had been requested to ask for the prayers of the\r\nfaithful in favour of Mr. Burke, one of the murdered men, who belonged\r\nto an old Galway family. And what was the remark made by that follower\r\nof Jesus Christ? He said, 'I have mentioned the request. You can pray\r\nfor his soul--_if you like_.' What he meant was plain enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you of something even worse,\" said the Dublin lawyer. \"In\r\na certain Catholic church which I regularly attend, and on a Sunday\r\nwhen were present two or three eminent Judges, with a considerable\r\nnumber of the Dublin aristocracy, a certain dignitary, whom I also\r\nwill not name before our Sassenach friend, actually coupled the names\r\nof honest people who had died in their beds with the names of Curley\r\nand the other assassins who were hanged for the Phoenix Park murders.\r\nWe were invited to pray for their souls _en bloc_! And this, mind you,\r\nnot at the time of the execution, but a year afterwards, on the\r\nanniversary of the day, and when the thing might well have been\r\nallowed to drop. Did you ever hear of anything more outrageous than\r\nthe conduct of this priest, who took upon himself to mention these\r\nbrutal murderers in the same breath with the blessed departed, whose\r\nfriends and relations were kneeling around? The fact that this cleric\r\ncould so act shows the immunity of the Irish priesthood, and their\r\nconfidence in their influence over the people. Don't forget that this\r\nwas in the capital of Ireland, and that the congregation was\r\naristocratic. How great must be priestly influence over the unlettered\r\npeasantry. You see my point? What would the English say to such an\r\nexhibition? What would the relatives of decent people in England do\r\nif they had been submitted to such an insult by a Protestant parson?\"\r\n\r\nI disclaimed any right to speak for the brutal Saxon with any degree\r\nof authority, but ventured to say that to the best of my knowledge and\r\nbelief the supposititious reverend gentleman, when next he took his\r\nwalks abroad, might possibly become acquainted with a novel but\r\nvigorous method of propulsion, or even might undergo the process so\r\nfamiliar to Tim Healy, not altogether unconnected with a horsewhip.\r\n\r\nThe Galway Town Commissioner said:--\"We respectable Catholics are in a\r\nvery awkward position. We have to live among our countrymen who are of\r\na different way of thinking, and unhappily we cannot express our\r\nhonest opinions without embarassing consequences. In England, where\r\npeople of opposite politics meet on terms of most sincere friendship,\r\nyou do not understand our difficulties. We are denounced as\r\nunpatriotic, as enemies to our native land, and as aiders and abettors\r\nof the hated English rule. Now we know very well--my friend from\r\nDublin, who understands law, will bear me out--we know very well that\r\nthe English laws are good, excellent, liberal. We know that the\r\nEnglish people are anxious to do what is fair and right, and that they\r\nhave long been doing their best to make us comfortable. But we must\r\nkeep this knowledge to ourselves, for such of us who are in business\r\nwould run great risk of loss, besides social ostracism, if we ventured\r\nto boldly express our views. Moreover, we do not care to put ourselves\r\nin open conflict with the clergy, upon whom we have been taught to\r\nlook from earliest childhood with reverence and awe. It is almost, if\r\nnot quite, a matter of heredity. I declare that, in spite of what I\r\nmight call my intellectual convictions, I am to some extent overawed\r\nby any illiterate farmer's son, who has been ordained a priest. I feel\r\nit in my blood. I must have imbibed it with my mother's milk. No use\r\nfor Conservative Catholics to kick against it. We are too few, and we\r\nare bound hand and foot.\"\r\n\r\nSo did the Galway man deliver himself. I was reminded of Mr. O'Ryan,\r\nof Larne, a devoted Catholic, who said, \"I protest from my innermost\r\nheart against Home Rule. I protest not only for myself, but also on\r\nbehalf of my co-religionists that dare not speak, because if they did\r\nspeak their lives might not be worth an hour's purchase, not being\r\nsituated, as I am, in the midst of a loyal, and law-abiding\r\npopulation. I believe that all that Ireland requires is a just\r\nsettlement of the land question, and a fair, reasonable measure of\r\nlocal self-government. For several generations past England has been\r\ndoing all the good she could for Ireland, and none have more reason\r\nthan the Roman Catholics of Ireland to be thankful for that good. The\r\nloyal Roman Catholics of Ireland are convinced that Home Rule would be\r\nthe ruin of Ireland in particular and of the British Empire in\r\ngeneral, which would find itself deprived in a few hours of a\r\nConstitution the workmanship of centuries, and the admiration of the\r\nwhole nineteenth-century civilisation.\"\r\n\r\nThis is tolerably outspoken for an Irish Roman Catholic, but Mr.\r\nO'Ryan lives in Ulster, where people do not shoot their neighbours for\r\ndifference of political opinion. He said more: \"We loyal Catholics\r\ncould never submit to Mr. Gladstone's ticket-of-leave men placed in\r\npower over us in this country, and rather than submit to them we are\r\nprepared for the worst, and ready, if need be, to die with the words,\r\n'No surrender,' on our lips.\"\r\n\r\nArchbishop Walsh cursed the Dublin Bazaar for the Irish Masonic\r\nOrphanage until he was black in the face, but neither he nor any other\r\nCatholic Bishop denounced the perpetrators of outrage, of mutilation,\r\nof foul assassinations. When Inspector Martin was butchered on the\r\nsteps of the presbytery at Gweedore; when Joseph Huddy and John Huddy\r\nwere murdered and their bodies put in sacks and thrown into Lough\r\nMask; when Mrs. Croughan, of Mullingar, was murdered because she had\r\nbeen seen speaking to the police, four shots being fired into her\r\nbody; when Luke Dillon, a poor peasant, was shot dead as he walked\r\nhome from work; when Patrick Halloran, a poor herdsman, was shot dead\r\nat his own fireside; when Michael Moloney was murdered for paying his\r\nrent; when John Lennane, an old man who had accepted work from a\r\nboycotted farmer, was shot dead in the midst of his family; when\r\nThomas Abram met precisely the same fate under similar circumstances;\r\nwhen Constable Kavanagh was murdered; when John Dillon had his brains\r\nbeaten out and his ears torn away; when Patrick Freely was murdered\r\nfor paying his rent; when John Curtin was shot dead by moonlighters,\r\nto whom he refused to give up his guns; when John Forhan, a feeble old\r\nman of nearly seventy years, was murdered for having induced labourers\r\nto work on a boycotted farm; when James Ruane, a labourer who worked\r\nfor a boycotted farmer, was murdered by three shots; when James Quinn\r\nwas wounded by a bullet, and while disabled, killed by having his\r\nthroat cut; when Peter McCarthy was murdered because it was thought he\r\nmeant to pay rent; when James Fitzmaurice, aged seventy, was shot dead\r\nin the presence of his daughter Norah, because he had taken a farm\r\nwhich his brother had left, the latter declining to pay rent, although\r\nthe landlord offered a reduction of 66 per cent.; when Margaret\r\nMacmahon, widow, and her little children were three times fired at\r\nbecause the poor woman had earned a few pence by supplying turf to the\r\npolice; when Patrick Quirke, aged seventy-five, was murdered for\r\ntaking a farm which somebody else wanted; when the wife of John\r\nCollins was indecently assaulted while her husband was being brutally\r\nbeaten for caretaking; when John Curtin (another John Curtin), a\r\nschool-master, was shot, and his wife received forty-two slugs in her\r\nface, neck, and breast for something they had not done, the school\r\nalso being fired into, and all children attending it boycotted; when\r\nJohn Connor's wife was shot in the head by moonlighters who wished to\r\nvex the husband; when Cornelius Murphy was shot dead while sitting at\r\nhis \"ain fireside\" chatting with his wife and children; when Daniel\r\nO'Brien, aged seventy-five, talking with his wife, aged seventy, was\r\nmurdered by a shot; when Patrick Quigley had the roof of his skull\r\nblown away for taking some grazing; when David Barry was shot in the\r\nmain street of Castleisland; when Patrick Taugney was murdered in the\r\npresence of his wife and daughters; when Edmund Allen was shot dead\r\nbecause of a right-of-way dispute--he was a Protestant; when young\r\nCashman, aged twenty, was beaten to death for speaking to a policeman;\r\nwhen poor Spillane was murdered for acting as a caretaker; when\r\nPatrick Curtin, John Rahen, and a farmer named Tonery were murdered;\r\nwhen James Spence, aged sixty-five, was beaten to death; when Blake,\r\nRuane, Linton, Burke, Wallace, Dempsey, Timothy Sullivan, John Moylan,\r\nJames Sheridan, and Constable Cox were shot dead; when James Miller,\r\nMichael Ball, Peter Greany, and Bridget McCullagh were murdered--the\r\nlast a poor widow, who was beaten to death with a spade; when Ryan\r\nFoley was brutally murdered; when Michael Baylan was murdered; when\r\nViscount Mountmorres was murdered, and the dead body left on the road,\r\nthe neighbouring farmers being afraid to give the poor corpse the\r\nshelter of a barn; when a car-driver named John Downey was killed by a\r\nbullet intended for Mr. Hutchins, J.P.; when young Wheeler, of Oolagh,\r\nwhence I dated a letter, was shot dead, to punish his father, who was\r\nan agent--when all these murders took place, every one of them, and as\r\nmany more, the work of the Land League, which also was responsible for\r\nmore outrages, filthy indecencies, and gross brutalities than the\r\nentire _Gazette_ would hold, and which would in many cases be unfit\r\nfor publication--then were the clergy SILENT. No denunciations from\r\nthe altar; no influence exerted in the parish. In many cases a direct\r\nencouragement to persevere in the good path. When John Curtin's\r\ndaughters attended church after their father's murder they were\r\nattacked by a hostile crowd. The police were compelled to charge the\r\ninfuriated mob. Otherwise the pious Papists would in all probability\r\nhave consummated the good work by murdering the remainder of the\r\nfamily, after having, in the presence of daughters who nobly fought\r\nthe murderers, assassinated the father.\r\n\r\nWhat did the good priest, Father O'Connor, say to all this; how\r\nexpress his deep sense of this abject cowardice, this atrocious\r\nsavagery, this unheard-of-sacrilege?\r\n\r\nHe \"took no notice of the occurrence\"--good, easy man. But I am\r\nforgetting something. Mr. Curtin was killed by a gang of moonlighters,\r\nwho knocked him up, and, presenting loaded rifles at the children,\r\nasked for the father's arms. Before the terrified boys and girls could\r\ncomply the father appeared and shot a moonlighter dead in his tracks.\r\nThe rest fled precipitately, but unhappily Curtin gave chase and was\r\nkilled. Good Father O'Connor attended the funeral of the moonlighter,\r\nwho did not belong to his parish, and refused to attend that of Mr.\r\nCurtin, who did!\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Bishops of Ireland stood by and looked on all this\r\nwithout a word of censure. Silence gives consent. Had they fulminated\r\nagainst outrage and secret wholesale murder of poor working men, for\r\nnearly all those I have cited were of this class; had they used their\r\nimmense influence to stem the murderous instincts of ruffians who in\r\nmany cases took advantage of the prevailing disregard for human life\r\nto wreak their private revenge on their neighbours, satisfied that no\r\nman dare testify, and that the clergy would aid them to frustrate the\r\nlaw--had the Bishops done this, even the dull and sluggish brain of\r\nthe brutal Saxon could have understood their action. They uttered no\r\nsingle word of condemnation. An eminent Catholic, a clever\r\nprofessional man, who reveres the faith in which he was bred, but\r\nholds its priesthood in lowest contempt, said to me:--\"You cannot find\r\na word of condemnation uttered by any Bishop during the whole period\r\nwhen brutal murders were of daily occurrence. I give you your best. I\r\nwould stake anything on my statement. I have challenged people over\r\nand over again, but nobody has ever been able to produce a syllable of\r\ncensure, of warning, of reprobation. The Bishops were strangely\r\nunanimous in their silence.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the Irish Masons try to provide for the orphans of their\r\nbrethren the Archbishop's back is up at once; for Masons have secrets\r\nwhich they may not tell even to priests; and therefore Dr. Walsh\r\ndeclares that whosoever gives sixpence to this cause of charity, or\r\nassociates with its promoters, shall be cast into hell, there to abide\r\nin torture everlastingly--unless previously whitewashed by himself in\r\nperson. And as I have clearly shown, the influence of Archbishop Walsh\r\nand his kind is at this moment supremely powerful in matters affecting\r\nthe prestige and integrity of England and her people. Wherefore I do\r\nnot wonder at the saying of an earnest Irishman of famous name, a\r\nbaronet of long descent, whom I saw yesterday--\r\n\r\n\"When I see how the thing is being worked, and when, as a Catholic, I\r\nrecognise the progress and character of the Church policy, and when I\r\nsee England walking so stupidly into the trap, I don't know what to\r\ndo--whether to swear, or to go out and be sick.\"\r\n\r\nMoycullen (Connemara), May 23rd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 26.--THE CONNEMARA RAILWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour's railway from Galway to Clifden will be exactly fifty\r\nmiles long, and will run through Crooniffe, Moycullen, Ross,\r\nOughterard, and the wildest and most desolate parts of Connemara. The\r\nline has been in contemplation for thirty years at least, but the\r\nstrong suit of its Irish projectors was talking, not doing, and the\r\nproject might have remained under discussion until the crack of doom\r\nbut for Mr. Balfour's energy and administrative power. The Irish\r\npatriots had no money, or they would not invest any. The Galway\r\nauthorities would not authorise a county rate. Anybody who chose might\r\nmake the line, but the local \"powers that be\" refused to spend a\r\nsingle penny on an enterprise which would for years provide employment\r\nfor the starving people of Connemara, and would afterwards prove of\r\nincalculable benefit to the whole West of Ireland by opening up an\r\nattractive, an immense, an almost inaccessible tourist district,\r\nbesides affording facilities of transit for agricultural stock and\r\ngeneral market produce, and powerfully aiding the rapidly-developing\r\nfish trade of the western sea-board. Not a bit of it. The Western\r\nIrish are always standing about waiting for something. They talked\r\nabout the line for a generation or two, but they cut no sod of turf.\r\nThey harangued meetings convened to hear the prospective blessings of\r\nthe line, but they declined to put any money on their opinions. The\r\nstarving peasants of Connemara might have turned cannibals and eaten\r\neach other before Irishmen had commenced the railway. The people of\r\nthe congested districts were unable to live on the sympathy of their\r\nfellow-countrymen, and nothing else was offered to them. The\r\nConnemarans have an occasional weakness for food. They like a square\r\nfeed now and again. Their instincts are somewhat material. They think\r\nthat Pity without Relief is like Mustard without Beef. They like\r\nSentiment--with something substantial at the back of it. Their\r\npatriot-brethren, those warm-hearted, dashing, off-hand,\r\ndevil-may-care heroes of whom we read in Charles Lever, sometimes\r\nvisited the district, to rouse the people against the brutal Saxon,\r\nbut they did no more than this. Sometimes, I say, not often, did the\r\npatriots patrol Connemara. There were two reasons for this. First, the\r\nIrish patriots do not speak their native language; and the Connemarans\r\nare not at home with English. Secondly, and principally, the\r\nConnemarans had nothing to give away. They cannot pay for first-class\r\npatriotism like that of Davitt, Dillon, O'Brien, and Tim Healy, who\r\nlatterly have never performed out of London.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Galway folks went on with their railway discussions, and\r\nthe poor Connemarans went on with their starving. Suddenly Mr. Balfour\r\ntook the thing up, and the turf began to fly. The Midland and Western\r\nRailway Company, in consideration of a grant of £264,000, agreed to\r\nmake the line, and to afterwards run it, whether it paid or not. The\r\ncontractors were not allowed to import unskilled labour. The\r\nConnemarans were to make the line whether they knew the work or not.\r\nThey had never seen navvy labour. They knew nothing outside the\r\nmanagement of small farms. They had never done regular work. Their\r\nusual form is to plant their bit of ground and then to sit down till\r\nthe crops come up, on which they live till next season. A failure of\r\ncrops means starvation. This was their normal condition. They enjoyed\r\nwhat Mr. Gladstone would call a \"chronic plethora\" of hunger. The\r\nliverish tourist who adventured himself into these barbarous regions\r\nin hopeless quest of appetite for his breakfast, would see the\r\nConnemarans in hopeless quest of breakfast for their appetites. The\r\nregion is healthy enough. As Justice Shallow would say, \"Beggars all,\r\nbeggars all. Marry, good air.\"\r\n\r\nThe first thing you see is a twenty-thousand-pound bridge across the\r\nCorrib, not very far from the salmon weir, where are more fish than\r\nyou can count splashing up the salmon stairs, which are arranged to\r\nsave the salmon the effort of a long jump. Then the line running along\r\nthe Corrib Valley on a high embankment, past the ruins of what was\r\nfirst a convent, then a whiskey distillery, now a timekeeper's office.\r\nAn entire field is being dug up and carted away, the soil being\r\nexcavated to a depth of eight or ten feet, over an area of several\r\nacres required for sidings and railway buildings. A strolling Galway\r\nman of Home Rule tendencies imparts information. He is eminently\r\ndiscontented, and thinks the way in which the work is conducted\r\nanother injustice to Ireland. \"The people are working and getting\r\nwages, but what wages! Thirteen and sixpence a week! Would English\r\nnavvies work for that? You are getting the labour at starvation\r\nprices, and even then you bully the men. They work in gangs, each with\r\na ganger swearing at them in the most offensive and outrageous way.\r\nSee that gang over there. You can hear the ganger shouting and\r\nswearing even at this distance. The poor men are treated like dogs,\r\nand even then they can hardly keep body and soul together. They have\r\nto come miles and miles to the work, and some live so far away that\r\nthey can only return home once a week. So they have to camp out in\r\nhovels. You are going down the line? Then you will be shocked at the\r\nslave-driving you'll see. It reminds me of Legree in 'Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin.' I am surprised that the men do not drop dead over the work.\r\nNot a moment's rest or relaxation. Work, work, work from morning to\r\nnight, for next to nothing. It ought not to be allowed in a civilised\r\ncountry. And on the top of all this slavery we are expected to be very\r\nmuch obliged for the opportunity of working at all. You chuck us a\r\ncrust just as you would chuck a bone to a dog, and then you want us to\r\ngo down on our knees and pour blessings on Balfour's head. We're tired\r\nof such stuff; but, thank God, we shall soon have things in our own\r\nhands. All these men are small farmers, or small farmers' sons. They\r\ncan't get a living out of the land, and they are obliged to come to\r\nthis. Bullied and driven from week's end to week's end, they are the\r\nvery picture of starvation. A shame and disgrace to the English\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nI may as well say at once that all this proved to be untrue. No doubt\r\nthe Galway Home Rulers invent and circulate these falsehoods to\r\ndiscount the effect of the good work of a Conservative Government, and\r\nit is, therefore, well that the facts should be placed on record. I\r\npushed on to a cutting where fifty men were busily engaged in loading\r\nearth into trucks, having first dug it from a great bank of gravelly\r\nsoil. An Irish ganger walked to and fro along the top, keeping his eye\r\non the men, and occasionally shouting in an excited tone. But he was\r\nnot swearing at, or otherwise abusing, the men, who were as fine a\r\ncompany of peasants as you could see anywhere, well-built, well-grown,\r\nand muscular. Not a trace of starvation, but, on the contrary, a\r\nwell-fed, well-nourished look. The ganger, Sullivan, seemed\r\ngood-tempered enough, only shouting to let off his superfluous\r\nvitality. He used no bad language. \"Cheer up, my lads,\" he cried. \"In\r\nwid the dirt. Look alive, look alive, look alive. Whirroo! Shove it\r\nup, my lads, shove it up. Away ye go. Look out for that fall of earth.\r\nThere she goes. Whirroo!\" English navvies would have preferred\r\nsilence, would have requested him to hold his condemned jaw, would\r\nhave spent some breath in applying an explosive mining term to his\r\neyes, but these Irish labourers seemed to understand their superior\r\nofficer, and to cheerfully accept the situation. Mr. Sullivan was\r\ncivil and good-humoured. \"These are a picked lot. Splendid set of\r\nfellows, and good workers. No, they do not walk for miles before they\r\nreach their work. The engine runs along the line to pick them up in\r\nthe morning, and to drop them again in the evening. They have\r\nhalf-an-hour for dinner, and half-an-hour for tea. They get about\r\nfifteen shillings a week. Boys get less, but thirteen shillings and\r\nsixpence is the very bottom. Rubbish about low wages. Nine bob a week\r\nis the regular farmer's wage, and these men would have been glad to\r\nwork for six bob. All have some land, every man of them. They have\r\njust come back from planting it. We have been very short of men. They\r\nwent away at the beginning of April, and they were away for a\r\nfortnight or three weeks. Small blame to them. Half or three-quarters\r\nof them went to look after their bits of ground. But, barrin' that,\r\nthey turn up very regularly. They get fifteen shillings a week, where\r\nthey got nothing. And every man knows the convenience the line will be\r\nto him to get his bit of stuff to Galway market, and also that it will\r\nbring money into a country where there was none. They are as contented\r\nas can be, and we never hear a word of complaint. We have not heard a\r\ngrumble since the line was started a year or two ago. These Home\r\nRulers will say anything but their prayers, and them they whistle.\r\nSince the work came from the Tories it must be bad. There must be a\r\ncurse on it. Now, my lads, shove it up, shove it up! (Excuse me, Sir.)\r\nWhirroo, my boys. Look out! In wid it, thin! Whirroo!\"\r\n\r\nA big tank for engine water was being filled by an old man in shirt\r\nand trousers, his naked chest shining a hundred yards away. Luke\r\nWhelan was his name; a vigorous pumper, he. \"'Tis hard work it is, ye\r\nmay say it. I have another tank or two to fill, an' keep filled, but I\r\nhave long rests, and time for a grain o' baccy, glory be to God!\r\nThirteen-an'-sixpence it is, but I lost my place at Palmer's flour\r\nmills, the work gave out, an' but for this I'd have nothin' at all.\r\nWas in the Fifth Fusiliers, but lost me sight (partly) in Injee. Was\r\nin the army long enough to get a pension of ninepence a day. Me rint\r\nis two pounds a year, and I've only the owld woman to kape. Ah, but\r\nBalfour was a blessin' to us altogether! They talk about Home Rule,\r\nbut what good will that do us? Can we ate it, can we dhrink it, can we\r\nshmoke it? The small farmers thinks they'll have the land for nothin',\r\nbut what about the labourers? Everything that's done is done for the\r\nfarmers, an' the workin' men gets nothin' at all. In England 'tis the\r\nworkin' men gets all the consideration; but in this counthry 'tis the\r\nfarmers, an' the workin' men that have no land may hang themselves.\r\nWhen the big farms is all done away who'll employ the labourers? The\r\ngintry that spint money an' made things a bit better is all driven out\r\nof the counthry by the Land League. Ye see all around ye the chimneys\r\nof places that once was bits of manufactories. All tumblin' down, all\r\ntumblin' down. Nobody dares invest money for fear he'd be robbed of\r\nhis property, the same as the landlords was robbed, an' will be\r\nrobbed, till the end of the chapther. 'Tis nothin' but robbery ye hear\r\nof, an' gettin' other people's property for nothin'. The Home Rule\r\nBill would dhrive all the workin' men out of the counthry to England\r\nand America. They must have employment, an' they must go where it is\r\nto be had. Engineers have been threatenin' this line for forty years,\r\nfirst one route an' then another, but divil a spade was put in it.\r\nEngland found us the money to build the line, an' the labourers get\r\nwork. Where will we get work whin nobody would lend us money to build\r\nlines? An Irish Parlimint wouldn't build a line in a thousand years.\r\nFor nobody would thrust thim wid the cash. Yes, wid ninepence a day\r\nand thirteen shillings and sixpence a week, I'm comfortable enough.\r\nBut begorra, the pump leaks, an' I have to pump a quarther more than I\r\nshould. Av the pump worked right 'tis little grumblin' ye'd hear from\r\nLuke Whelan.\"\r\n\r\nMr. George William Wood, contractors' agent, said:--\"The men work as\r\nwell as they can, but they do not get over the ground like English\r\nnavvies. They are very regular, very quiet, very sober, and never give\r\nthe least trouble. Of course, they had to be taught, and they did not\r\nlike the big navvy shovels. They were used to the six-foot spades with\r\nno cross-bar. Yes, you might think it harder work with such tools, but\r\nthen the Irish labourer dislikes to bend his back. The long handle\r\nlets him keep his back straight, there's the difference. However, we\r\ninsist on the big, short shovels, and they have taken to them all\r\nright. These men are not so strong as they seem, and they are not\r\nworth nearly so much as English navvies. They may be willing, but they\r\nhave not the same stamina. The English navvy eats about two pounds of\r\nbeef for his dinner and washes it down with about two quarts of ale.\r\nThese men never see meat from one year's end to another. They live on\r\npotatoes, and bits of dry bread and water. At three in the afternoon\r\nthey are not worth much, clean pumped out--might almost as well go\r\nhome. No, they don't live in hovels. Those who go home but once a\r\nweek are housed in good wooden sheds, or corrugated iron buildings,\r\nwith good beds and bedclothes. There are about forty of them in a hut,\r\nwith a hut-keeper to look after them and to keep order. For this\r\nexcellent lodging they are charged sixpence a week, and all their prog\r\nis supplied at wholesale prices. We buy largely in Dublin, bring it\r\ndown, of course, carriage free, and both the men and their wives and\r\nfamilies are supplied to any amount. They effect a saving of at least\r\ntwenty per cent., but probably much more, as village stores are\r\nterribly dear. The whole district has found out this advantage, and\r\nthey flock to the hut-store from all parts. So Balfour is a boon to\r\nthe country at large.\"\r\n\r\nNext day I went down sixteen miles of line to a spot about a mile from\r\nOughterard. It was pay-day, and I clung to the engine along with the\r\nengineer, Mr. Wood, and a pay-clerk, armed with several yards of\r\npay-sheet, and a couple of black tin cash-boxes. A wild and stony\r\ncountry, a range of high mountains on the left, wide, flat plains on\r\nthe right, through which the Corrib serpentined, with big rocks rising\r\nfrom the channel brilliantly white. \"They whitewash the rocks, so that\r\nthey can be seen by the boats and the Cong steamer. Englishmen would\r\nblow them up and have done with them, but Irishmen prefer to whitewash\r\nthem and sail round them. More exciting I suppose, matter of taste.\"\r\nThis from the engineer, a Saxon of the usual type. On through bogs,\r\npast nameless lakes, and a chaos of limestone rocks and huge granite\r\nboulders, lakes, bogs, rocks, in endless succession, with the long\r\nmountain reek beside us, and a still higher range in the purple\r\ndistance. Now and then a green patch sternly walled in, a few cows\r\ngrazing, a lonely donkey, a few long-tailed black sheep, or a couple\r\nof goats. Here and there acres of white blossom, looking like a\r\nsnowfall. This was the bog bean, growing on a stem a foot high, a\r\nsilvery tuft of silky bloom hanging downward, two inches long and the\r\nbigness of a finger. Sometimes we dashed past walled enclosures so\r\nfull of stone that they looked like abandoned graveyards, and the only\r\nuse of the fences, so far as I could see, was to keep thoughtless\r\ncattle out. Very little tillage. Just a few ridges of potatoes, but\r\nthe people who had planted them seemed to have vanished for ever. At\r\nlong intervals a diminutive white cot, but nothing else to break the\r\nsuccession of lake, rock, and bog. Moycullen, six miles from Galway,\r\nis to have a station; another will be built at Ross, ten miles, a\r\nthird at Oughterard, sixteen and a half miles. Not a stone laid as\r\nyet. At Ross a great excavation. The men had just laid bare a huge\r\nboulder of granite, weighing some thirty tons, and Mr. Wood, observing\r\nmy interest in this relic of the ice-age, gave it to me on the spot.\r\n\"No granite _in situ_ hereabouts, the living rock is mountain\r\nlimestone, but no end of granite boulders, which are blasted to the\r\ntune of half-a-ton of tonite per week.\" Ten miles from Galway a\r\ncutting was being regularly quarried for building purposes, and most\r\nof the sixteen or seventeen miles of line I saw was fenced with a\r\nGalway wall of uncemented stone four feet six inches high and\r\neighteen inches thick. \"The men build stone walls with great skill,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Wood, \"but half the number of English navvies would do more\r\nexcavating.\"\r\n\r\nThe pay-clerk stopped the engine at every gang, and the men came\r\nforward for their money. All had the same well-nourished sturdy look,\r\nand all seemed well satisfied with their wages. They conversed in\r\nIrish, but they mostly understood English, even if they could not\r\nspeak it themselves. Whole villages were there seemingly of the same\r\nname, and strange were the distinctive appellations. There was John\r\nToole and John Toole Pat, John Pat Toole and Pat Toole John.\r\nPermutation was the order of the day. There was Tom Joyce Pat and Pat\r\nTom Joyce, Tom Joyce Sally and Tom Joyce boy. Besides this change\r\nringing a little colour was thrown in, and we had Pat Tom Joyce Red\r\nand Pat Tom Joyce Black, Red Pat Tom Joyce and Black Tom Joyce Pat.\r\nThis is called Joyce's country, before Balfour's time depopulating to\r\ndesolation, now thriving and filling up, re-Joyceing in fact. Nearly\r\nseventeen hundred men are at work here and at the other end, and in\r\n1894 the great civiliser will steam from Galway to Clifden,\r\ninaugurating (let us hope) a new era of prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn Oughterard I met an American tourist who said, \"I should think Home\r\nRule would about settle Old England. The Irish people show a most\r\nunfriendly spirit, and I have come to the conclusion that there is no\r\nsuch word as gratitude in the Irish language. There is some change in\r\nthis district, and the people seem willing to work, but wherever the\r\nagitators have been everything is going to the bad. Nothing but\r\ndistrust and suspicion. No Irishman would invest in Irish securities.\r\nThey prefer South Americans! That startled me. I am told that Tim\r\nHealy is worth £30,000, all got out of Home Rule, and my informant\r\nsays that Tim would not risk a penny in his own country. Tim is a\r\nblackguardly kind of politician, but he is mighty cute, and shirks\r\nIrish securities. Where are the business managers of the Irish nation\r\ncoming from? That's what I want to know.\"\r\n\r\nI told him of the Galway Harbour Commissioners, who, having been\r\nforgiven a Government debt of nearly £10,000, conceived the idea of\r\nbuilding a new, grand, splindid, iligant, deep dock, which should\r\nincrease the trade of the place by allowing ships of great draught to\r\nunload in the harbour. Let me repeat the story for the readers of the\r\n_Gazette_.\r\n\r\nThe Harbour Board consulted an eminent engineer, who said the right\r\nthing would cost £80,000. They sent him to the right about, and called\r\nin another man. \"Now,\" said they, \"we can only raise £30,000 by loans\r\nfrom the Board of Works. Will not that suffice? We give you 5 per\r\ncent. on the outlay, &c., &c., &c.\" The new man said £30,000 was\r\nample, took the job, and the work was commenced. Ultimately they\r\nborrowed £40,000, which they spent, along with the £10,000 in hand.\r\nThen it was found that big ships could not get to the dock at all! No\r\nuse in a deep dock unless you can swim up to it. To get the big\r\nvessels in you required to hoist them out of the water, carry them a\r\nfew hundred yards, and drop them into the dock. As the Galway men\r\nstill groan beneath the cruel English yoke, this operation was found\r\nimpracticable. During some blasting operations a big rock was tumbled\r\nout of the dock in process of manufacture, dropping in front of\r\nanother dock in full working order. The stone was just in the way of\r\nthe vessels, but as there was no Parliament in College Green, the\r\nHarbour Board had not the heart to fish it up. So it crashed through\r\nthe bottom of a Henderson collier, the owner of which sued the Harbour\r\nBoard for damages, and was awarded a thousand pounds. The money never\r\nwas paid, and never will be. The fortunate winner of the suit will\r\nsell his claim for £5 in English gold. He was thought to have done\r\nwell in winning, and my informant, a typical Irishman, admired the\r\ncomplainant's successful attack on the Harbour Board. \"But what good\r\ncome of it at last,\" I ventured to put in. \"Nay, that I cannot tell,\"\r\nsaid he, \"But 'twas a glorious victory.\"\r\n\r\nThe Galway Harbour Board spent £50,000 or so on a deep dock which they\r\nhave not got, and the harbour is in pawn to the Board of Works, which\r\ncollects the tolls, and otherwise endeavours to indemnify itself. The\r\nHarbour Board meets as usual, but it has no powers, no money, no\r\ncredit, no anything. This is a fair specimen of the business\r\nmanagement which characterises the breed of Irishmen who favour Home\r\nRule. The party paper, once a fine property, has in their hands sunk\r\nbelow zero, and they built New Tipperary on land to which they had no\r\ntitle; so that the money was completely thrown away. Almost every\r\nBoard of Guardians in the country is insolvent, except in those cases\r\nwhere the Government has kicked out the Poor Law Guardians elected by\r\nthe Parish, and restored solvency by sending down paid men to run the\r\nconcern for a couple of years. This has been done in several\r\ninstances, and in every case the paid men, drawing salaries of several\r\nhundred a year, have in two years paid off debts, leaving all in good\r\nworking order, with a balance in the bank. The inference is obvious.\r\nWould the Belfast folks have made such a fiasco of a dock? Would\r\nEnglishmen have exposed themselves to the ridicule of a story which is\r\ncuriously remindful of Robinson Crusoe and his big canoe? Would the\r\nGalway folks ever have built the railway they wanted so badly; or sans\r\nEngland and Mr. Balfour, would not the Connemara men have proceeded to\r\nstarve until the end of time? A keen old railway man who had\r\nthravelled, and who had done railway work in California, said to me,\r\n\"Whin we get an Oirish Parlimint the labourers may jist put on their\r\nhats and go over to England. Thank God, we'll know something besides\r\nfarm work now, the whole of us. We can get railroad work in England.\r\nThere'll be none in Oireland, for every mother's son that has money\r\nwill cut the country. I could take ye fourteen Oirish miles from\r\nGalway, along a road that was spotted wid great jintlemen's houses,\r\nan' ivery one of thim's in ruins. The owners that used to live in\r\nthem, and be a blessin' to the counthry, is all ruined by the land\r\nagitation. All are gone, an' their foin, splindid houses tumblin'\r\ndown, an' the people worse off than iver. If the Bill becomes law the\r\nyoung men will all be off to England and America. There'll be no work,\r\nno money in the counthry. Did ye hear what the cyar-dhriver said to\r\nMr. Morley?\"\r\n\r\nI confessed that the incident escaped my recollection.\r\n\r\n\"Why the cyar-man was a dacent boy, an Mister Morley axed him how was\r\nthrade, an' av he was busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" says the dhriver, \"things is quite, very quite,\" says he.\r\n\r\n\"Ye'll be busy when ye get Home Rule,\" says Mister Morley.\r\n\r\n\"But that'll only last a week,\" says the cyar-man.\r\n\r\n\"An' why so?\" says the Irish Secretary, bein' curious an' lookin'\r\nround at the dhriver.\r\n\r\n\"Och,\" says Pat; \"'twill only take a week to dhrive thim to the\r\nboats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who d'ye mane, wid yer dhrivin' to the boats?\" says owld Morley.\r\n\r\n\"All the dacent folks that has any money to pay for dhrivin',\" says\r\nPat, \"for bedad they'll be lavin' the counthry.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a thriminjus rap for owld Morley, but 'twas thrue, an' the\r\nDivil himself couldn't deny it.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' can ye tell me why the farmers should have all the land an' not\r\nthe labourers? An' could ye say why them murdherin' Land Leaguers in\r\nParliament wasn't hung up, the rampagious ruffians?\"\r\n\r\nI could throw no light on these points. My friend had much to say\r\nabout the Land League M.P.'s, and a score of times asked me why they\r\nhad not been hanged.\r\n\r\nA hard question to answer, when you come to think of it. Does anybody\r\nknow?\r\n\r\nOughterard (Connemara), May 23rd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 27.--CULTIVATING IRISH INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of kings. Pronounced Athen-rye, with a bang on the last\r\nsyllable. A squalid town, standing amid splendid ruins of a bygone\r\ntime. \"Look what English rule has brought us to,\" said a village\r\npolitician, waving his hand from the ivy-covered gateway by which you\r\nenter the town to the mean-looking houses around. \"That's what we\r\ncould build when we were left to ourselves, an' this is what we can do\r\nafther sivin hundhred years of the Saxon.\" The ruins in question are\r\nthe remains of fortifications erected after the Norman Conquest of\r\nIreland by the Normans, a great entrance gate, and a strong, oblong\r\nkeep. The ruins of the Dominican Friary, founded in 1241 by Meyler, of\r\nBirmingham, have a thrilling interest of their own, which has its\r\npendant in the story of a Mayence verger, who holds British visitors\r\nto the cathedral of that city in breathless rapture as he tells how it\r\nis said that a Mayence bishop of eight hundred years ago was said to\r\nbe of English extraction, or like the Stratford mulberry tree, which\r\nis said to be a cutting of a tree said to have grown on the spot where\r\na tree is said to have stood which is said to have been planted by\r\nShakespeare. Galway abounds in ruined fortalices, tumble-down abbeys,\r\nivied towers and castles, none of which were built by the Irish race.\r\nThe round towers which dot the country here and there, with a few\r\nruined churches, are all that the native Irish can claim in the way of\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nThe people here are full of interest. The fair at Athenry is something\r\nto remember. A very good time it was, cattle selling higher than of\r\nyore. The men were queerly, quaintly dressed, speaking Irish, getting\r\nextremely drunk on vilest whiskey, leaving the town in twos and\r\nthrees, tumbling in groups by the roadside, reeking heaps of imbruted\r\nhumanity. The women were numerous, tall, decent, and modest. All wore\r\nthe shawl as a hood, the shawls of strange pattern unknown in England.\r\nAll tucked up the dress nearly to the waist, showing the invariable\r\nred kirtle. All, or nearly all, were shod with serviceable shoes, such\r\nas would astonish the Parisian makers of bottines. But these shoes\r\nwere only for show. The ladies walked painfully about in the\r\nunaccustomed leather. They seemed to have innumerable corns, to\r\nwrestle with bunions huge and dire, to suffer from unknown pedal\r\ninfirmities. Outside the town the ladies put on their shoes. Outside\r\nthe town, after the fair, they took them off again, sitting on the\r\nroadside, stripping their shapely feet, bundling the obnoxious,\r\ncrippling abominations into Isabella-colour handkerchiefs, which they\r\ntucked under their arms as they bounded away like deer. It was\r\npleasant to watch their joy, their freedom, their long springy step as\r\ntheir feet once more struck their native heath. They do not spare\r\ntheir shoes by reason of economy, but because they walk better without\r\nthem. Donned for propriety, doffed for convenience. The young lady who\r\nis \"on the market\" is expected to wear leather on high days and\r\nholidays, and she submits--another martyr to fashion. Yet even as the\r\nhart panteth for the water-brooks, so longeth her sole after her\r\nnative turf.\r\n\r\nIt was at Athenry that I first obtained a precise legal definition of\r\nthe term Congested District, to the effect that wherever the land\r\nvaluation amounts to less than 30s. per head of the population the\r\ndistrict is held to be congested, and may receive assistance under the\r\nAct of 1891. The chief item of the Board's income is the sum of\r\n£41,250 a year, being interest at 2-3/4 per cent. per annum on the sum\r\nof £1,500,000 referred to in the Act as the Church Surplus Grant. The\r\nBoard may, under certain conditions, use the principal, if needful.\r\nTwo other smaller sums are also available, and the unexpended balance\r\nof the Irish Distress Fund has been applied to the completion of the\r\nBealdangan Causeway in Connemara. This was Mr. Balfour's suggestion.\r\nThere is a widespread idea that only the sea-board is touched, and\r\nthat only fishermen have reaped the benefit of the Act. This is\r\nentirely erroneous. The Board works unceasingly at the development of\r\nagriculture, the planting of trees, the breeding of live stock and\r\npoultry, the sale of seed potatoes and seed oats, the amalgamation of\r\nsmall holdings, migration, emigration, weaving and spinning, and any\r\nother suitable industries, as well as in aid of fishing and fishermen.\r\nBesides the innumerable direct and indirect methods by which\r\nagriculture and industries are assisted in production, the Board has\r\nlaboured successfully in the establishment of such means of\r\ncommunication, by railway, steamship, or otherwise, as will enable\r\ngoods to be imported and exported at rates sufficiently low to make\r\ntrade possible and profitable to producers and consumers in remote\r\ncongested districts. Another popular error arises from regarding the\r\nwork of the Board as merely a means of relief during periods of\r\nexceptional distress. Mr. Balfour would be the first to deprecate this\r\nnotion. His scheme was constructed with a view to bringing about a\r\ngradual and lasting improvement in the poor districts of Ireland, by\r\nputting the people in a way to help themselves, and not by doling out\r\nlarge sums in charity. The works, which are wrongly called \"relief\r\nworks,\" are in every instance a well-considered effort to permanently\r\nand materially improve the trade and resources of a given area in\r\nconnection with agriculture and miscellaneous industries. Such was the\r\ninvariable principle of every action of the Board while under Mr.\r\nBalfour's administration. The people have been taught better methods,\r\nand helped to carry out the instruction they had received. The Royal\r\nDublin Society has in some instances employed an instructor, whose\r\nduty it has been to teach the people the best system of cultivating\r\nportions or plots of their holdings, and to encourage them by gifts of\r\nseed and by giving prizes to those who were most successful in\r\ncarrying out the instructions of their teacher. It is conceded that by\r\nproper management, by the adoption of modern methods of farming such\r\nas are well within the grasp of the smallest landowner, the produce of\r\nIrish farms might be increased from one-third to one-half. Consider\r\nthe effect of this unassailable proposition on the eternal question of\r\nrent. The question can hardly be over-estimated. Compare the solidity,\r\nthe practicability, the substantial usefulness of this kind of help,\r\nwith the weak pandering to sentiment displayed by the present\r\ngovernment. The Board admits that no matter how vigorously and\r\nconstantly agricultural improvements are inculcated, the tenants of\r\nIreland are tardy in their adoption. The small farmers dislike change,\r\nand at the present moment they are rapidly slipping back into their\r\nold grooves. They believe that the old system will pay when they have\r\nno rent-days to meet. The Balfour Administration encouraged honesty,\r\nindustry, self-reliance. The Morley Government puts a premium on\r\nidleness, unthrift, retrogression, and dishonesty. It is easier to\r\nhalf-till the land, paying small rents or none at all, than to get the\r\nutmost out of the land with the object of paying the landlord his\r\ndue.\r\n\r\nThe Board is carrying on the afforestation of Ireland, which in many\r\nparts is almost without trees. When the potato crop failed in 1890 Mr.\r\nBalfour commenced to plant trees on the western sea-board. In 1891 a\r\nsum of £1,970 was spent in draining, fencing, and roadmaking, and in\r\nplanting 90 acres of 960 acquired by the Tory Government for the\r\npurpose. In 1892 a further sum of £1,427 was spent in carrying on the\r\nwork. It is said that a previous Liberal Government had rejected the\r\nscheme on the ground that trees would not grow in a situation exposed\r\nto the salt gales of the Atlantic, but Mr. Balfour's trees have\r\nthriven remarkably well. He tried all sorts, convinced that something\r\nshould be done, and that an ounce of experiment was worth a pound of\r\ntheory. Sycamore, ash, elm, beech, birch, poplar, alder, larch, Scotch\r\nfir, spruce, silver fir, sea buckthorn, elder, and willow--he gave\r\nthem all a chance, some as main plantations, some as shelter belts.\r\nAll proved successful except the silver fir. Besides this, three\r\nhundred and fifty holdings have been planted with shelter belts, and\r\nabout six hundred and fifty more were being planted when Mr. Balfour\r\nloosed the reins.\r\n\r\nAn eminent Irishman, a great authority on this subject, assures me\r\nthat he could dictate similar facts for a week without stopping to\r\nsearch his memory. Mr. Gladstone proposes to place the poor people of\r\nIreland under a Government utterly inexperienced in the administration\r\nof great matters, utterly unreliable where the handling of money is\r\nconcerned, utterly ignorant of business methods and business routine.\r\nThe fate of the destitute poor and the fortunes of the well-to-do\r\nclasses are to be at the mercy of men whose business ventures have\r\nbeen absurdly unsuccessful, who believe that to aid the poor you must\r\nrob the rich, and that the No-rent Manifesto, the Plan of Campaign,\r\nand the Land League, with its story of outrage and murder, were the\r\nperfection of modern statesmanship. The Balfour system teaches men to\r\nhelp themselves. The Morley system teaches men to help themselves to\r\ntheir neighbour's goods.\r\n\r\nMy friend gave a few more instances of useful assistance rendered by\r\nwhat the poor folks call the Blessed Board. Special arrangements have\r\nbeen made to enable the farmers to improve the breed of horses. The\r\nQueen presented an Arabian horse named Tirassan to the County Donegal.\r\nBulls of superior breed have been sold to decent, honest farmers at\r\none-third of their cost, and this small figure was payable in two\r\nyearly instalments. About two hundred black-faced Scotch rams and\r\nCheviot rams have been located in Donegal and Galway free of charge,\r\nand young boars of the pure Yorkshire breed are sold to certain\r\nselected farmers at a nominal charge on certain conditions calculated\r\nto prove useful to the neighbourhood. The breeding and rearing of\r\npoultry has received a world of attention, and the poor folks who make\r\na little money by the sale of eggs have been supplied with the best\r\ninformation and substantial assistance.\r\n\r\nIn a former letter I described the Aran sea-fisheries, and before that\r\nI adverted to the fact that the Shetland fishermen came to the Irish\r\nCoast, caught ling, and brought it back salted to sell to Irish\r\nfishermen. The Board has engaged an experienced fish-curer from Norway\r\nto show Irishmen how the thing is done, and English and Scotch\r\nfish-curers have been sent to several stations to give instruction in\r\nmackerel and herring-curing. Fifteen fish-curing stations are now in\r\nfull swing, and the poor Irish fishermen, instead of buying salt ling\r\nat 2d. a pound, are now selling it at £18 to £20 per ton. A big\r\nsteamer has been chartered to carry the salt, the fish, and for other\r\nuseful purposes.\r\n\r\nContrast this work and these results with the work of the Irish\r\nagitators and with that of Messrs. Gladstone, Morley, and Co.\r\nSentiment and starvation versus salt fish and satiety. A red-faced\r\nYorkshireman who knows all about fish-curing, said:--\"When first I\r\ncame here I'm blest if the men wasn't transparent. You could see\r\nthrough 'em like lookin' through the rungs of a ladder. Now the\r\nbeggars are growin' double chins. Now they're a-gettin' cheeky.\r\nThey're like a hoss as has had a feed of corn. They was meek an' mild\r\nenough when I come over. Now they're a-gettin' perky, an' a-talkin'\r\npolitics. They usen't to see no agitators. They never had no meetin's;\r\nwhy? there was no chance of a collection. Sometimes I gets down on 'em\r\nproper. 'Tother day I says, 'You chaps, wi' yer Home Rule, I says,\r\nreminds me of a character in the Bible, I says.' Bein' Catholics, they\r\ndon't read the Bible for theirselves. The priests read it for 'em. But\r\none of 'em cocks up his nose, an' he says, 'We're like a character in\r\nthe Bible, are we? Well,' he says, 'who was he?'\r\n\r\n\"'You're like the wild ass that sniffed up the wind instead of goin'\r\nin for sommat more substantial,' I says. That's what I told 'em. They\r\ndid look down their noses, I tell you. An' they fell to talkin' i'\r\nIrish. They couldn't answer me, do what they would.\"\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Connemara district I paid a second visit to\r\nOughterard in order that I might see the progress made by Irishmen in\r\nthe art of railway making. A gang or two were engaged in the\r\ncomparatively skilled work of rail-laying, and the way they got over\r\nthe ground was truly surprising. Two trucks stood on the line already\r\nlaid, one bearing sleepers, the other loaded with steel rails. Four or\r\nfive couples of men shouldered sleepers and laid them on the track at\r\nspots marked by a club-footed Irishman, who swore at everything with a\r\nvigour which spoke well for his wind. Several men lifted a thirty feet\r\nlength of rail, weighing nearly six hundred-weight, and laid it on the\r\nsleepers, when it was instantly bolted and secured. The same having\r\nbeen done on the other side, the trucks were pushed along the\r\nnewly-laid ten yards, and the process was repeated, the Irish ganger\r\nabove-mentioned swearing till the surrounding bogs seemed to quake. An\r\nunhappy Connemaran having dropped his end of the sleeper a few inches\r\nfrom the right spot, was cursed through the entire dictionary, the\r\nganger winding up a solemn declaration that he had not seen anything\r\nso Blankly and Double-Blankly and forty times Blankly idiotic since\r\n\"the owld goat died.\" An English ganger hard by never spoke at all,\r\nbut no doubt his men felt lonely. A labourer who had hurt his foot,\r\nand was awaiting a friendly truck to take him home, said of the\r\nswearer:--\r\n\r\n\"He manes no harm, an' the Boys doesn't care a rap for his swearin'.\r\nThese men want no elbowin' on, for they are paid by the piece, so that\r\nthe harder they work the more they get. All Irish gangers swear like\r\nthat. An' Irish farm bailiffs is jist the same. Onless they're cussin'\r\nan' rippin' an' tearin' they don't think they're doin' the work for\r\nwhich they're paid, an' they don't think their masthers would be\r\ncontint wid thim. Av an Irish landlord that kept a bailiff didn't hear\r\nhim swearin' three miles away, he'd discharge him for not workin'.\r\nEnglish gangers an' bailiffs says very little, an' ye wouldn't think\r\nthey wor doin' anythin'. 'Tis quare at first, but ye get used to it in\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nTravelling in any country is always instructive, no matter how much\r\nabout that country you previously knew. My lame friend may have\r\nunconsciously suggested an explanation of the speeches and conduct of\r\nthe Irish Nationalist Parliamentary contingent. Unless they kept up\r\nthe cursin' an' swearin', an' rippin' an' tearin', so that they can be\r\nheard across the Atlantic, their American paymasters might not be\r\ncontint wid thim, and might withhold the sinews of war. Once it is\r\nunderstood that the Irish patriots must revile all and sundry to earn\r\ntheir pay, the situation is to some extent explained. Few of them are\r\nlikely to fail in this supreme requirement. Six pounds a week for\r\nabusing the brutal Saxon is far better than the pound or thirty\r\nshillings of their pre-political days. They have no inducement to earn\r\nan honest living.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Galway Bag Factory may serve as a pendant to the\r\nstory of Mr. McMaster's effort to benefit the Catholic peasantry of\r\nthe counties of Galway and Donegal. The concern had stopped for lack\r\nof funds, and Father Peter Dooley went round the town endeavouring to\r\ninduce people to take shares in the concern, in order that the poor\r\nfolks of the district might have employment. The mills were reopened,\r\nand at first, just at first, the people attended work with tolerable\r\nregularity. They then fell off, coming for half a day, coming not at\r\nall. The management actually instituted prizes for regularity of\r\nattendance. The people, who professed to be dying for employment, had\r\nto be bribed to come to work. Even this was ineffectual, and as a\r\ncertain number of people were required to work a loom, the absence of\r\none or two made the loom and the other workpeople idle, and as, in\r\norder to pay expenses, every loom required to be constantly worked,\r\nthis skulking was not only annoying, but also a ruinous loss. Mr.\r\nMiller, the manager, was compelled to get people over from Scotland,\r\nafter having long placarded the walls of Galway with notices of\r\nvacancies which no Galway girls attempted to fill up. Father Peter\r\nremonstrated, and pointed out that as he had been instrumental in\r\nreopening the factory, he thought Mr. Miller should oblige him by\r\nengaging Galway girls. The manager showed him the placards, and said\r\nthat if Father Peter would bring the people he would find them\r\nemployment. Father Peter Dooley went into the highways and hedges, but\r\nnot a soul could he bring in, although Mr. Miller seems to have been\r\nso desperately beset that he would have jumped at the blind, the\r\nmaimed, the halt, and the lame. The good Father was beaten, but then\r\nhe had a reason--an excellent reason. When things go wrong in Ireland,\r\nit is always some other fellow's fault, just as when the French are\r\nbeaten in battle they always scream _Nous sommes trahis_! Bad\r\ncharacters had been admitted to the looms. Manager was surprised. Let\r\nFather Peter point them out, and away they go--if Father Peter did not\r\nhesitate to cast them again on the streets of Galway. Two girls were\r\ndismissed. Some of the old workpeople returned to work intermittently,\r\nas before. Father Peter wanted the two girls reinstated. The manager\r\ndeclined to see-saw in this way, and sacrilegious Scotsman as he was,\r\ndared to say that nothing went well when bossed by priests! From that\r\nmoment that manager was blighted. His sight grew dim, his hearing\r\nbecame dull, his liver got out of order, his corns grew more numerous\r\nand more painful, and a bald spot was seen on his crown. The people\r\nworked as before, by fits and starts, but more fitty and starty than\r\never. The factory was closed, and the manager died. They buried him\r\nabout a week ago, a sort of human jackdaw of Rheims without the curse\r\ntaken off. Protestants say the Galway workpeople wore him down, broke\r\nhis spirit and broke his heart, but Catholics know better. The only\r\nwonder was that instead of being instantly consumed by fire from\r\nheaven, Miller was permitted to waste away by slow degrees. But that\r\nwas Father Dooley's good nature.\r\n\r\nThe Galwegians say that a Belfast firm has taken the mill, and that\r\ntherefore its future success is assured. The cutest citizens say that\r\nthis entirely depends on the manager's theory as to workpeople. If he\r\nbrings them with him, well and good. The work will be done although\r\nthe workpeople may be boycotted. And then the Irish will have another\r\ngrievance. They will be able to point to the fact that of a large\r\nnumber of workpeople only a small proportion of Catholics are\r\nemployed. This is the trick of Nationalists when speaking of the\r\nintolerance of Belfast. The officials of that city, and indeed, of\r\nevery city in Ireland, are mostly Protestants, not because of this,\r\nbut because they are better men. The Belfast merchants and the Belfast\r\nCorporation have a keen eye to the main chance, as is abundantly\r\nproved by their success, and in business matters they will have the\r\nbest men, whether Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Turks, or Infidels.\r\nWhatever the cause, it is certain that Protestantism turns out a far\r\nlarger proportion of able men, and in Ulster, at any rate, you rarely\r\nmeet a Catholic who is worth his salt. The Catholics of Ulster lack,\r\nnot toleration, but brains, industry, and business capacity. Anyone\r\nwho compares the harbours of Cork and Galway with Belfast will at once\r\nappreciate the situation. Wherefore let not the Keltic Irish waste\r\ntheir time in clamouring for the redress of non-existent grievances,\r\nbut buckle to and make their own prosperity. The destinies of nations,\r\nlike those of individuals, are in their own hands. Honest work is\r\nnever wasted work. Selah.\r\n\r\nAthenry, May 27th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 28.--COULD WE RECONQUER IRELAND?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe country people call this place \"the back of God-speed,\" \"the back\r\nof the world,\" and \"the divil's own hunting ground,\" but why they do\r\nit nobody seems to know. The village is on the road to nowhere, and I\r\ndropped on it, as it were, accidentally, during a long drive to the\r\nremotest end of Galway Bay. Yet even here I found civilised people who\r\nregard the proposed College Green Parliament with undisguised\r\naversion. Not the inhabitants, but Irish tourists, bent on exploring\r\nthe wildest and remotest nooks of their native land, among them a\r\nDublin barrister, whose critical analysis of the powers proposed to be\r\nentrusted to the unscrupulous and self-seeking promoters of the Land\r\nLeague may prove useful and interesting to non-legal English readers.\r\nA Galway gentleman having during the drive pointed out a large number\r\nof desolate mansions rapidly falling into ruin, the conversation\r\nturned on the universal subject, and my legal friend embarked on a\r\ndissertation on the iniquity of the Gladstone land laws, which have\r\nhad the effect of ruining a large number of the country gentry of\r\nIreland, driving them from their native shores, impoverishing the\r\nlandlords without any perceptible benefit to the tenants, who appear\r\nto be no better off than ever. What surprised him most was the arrant\r\nnonsense talked by the English Gladstonians, and the blindness and\r\napathy of the English people generally, who in his opinion were being\r\ngradually led to the brink of a frightful abyss, which threatened to\r\nswallow up the prestige and prosperity of the British people. He\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Have Englishmen forgotten the previous history of the men she is now\r\non the point of entrusting with her future? Are Englishmen\r\nunacquainted with the traditional hatred of the Irish malcontents? Do\r\nthey not know the aspirations of the Catholic clergy, and are they\r\nignorant of their immense influence with the masses? Surely they are,\r\nor they would rise in their might and instantly trample out the\r\npresent agitation, which has for its aim and end, not the benefit of\r\nIreland, not the pacification of the people, who are perfectly\r\npeaceful if left alone, not the convenience of Ireland in matters\r\nwhich should be managed by local self-government, but the absolute\r\nindependence of the country, the creation of a national army, and the\r\naffiliation of Ireland with some foreign Power hostile to England,\r\nsuch as either America or France, as occasion might serve. America is\r\nlargely in the hands of the Irish electorate, and American politicians\r\nwould not be particularly scrupulous how they purchased Irish support.\r\nNo need to point out the embarrassing complications likely to result\r\nfrom giving large powers to men who are essentially inimical to\r\nEngland. You can do justice without putting your own head on the\r\nblock. It has been my business to analyse the bill, in conjunction\r\nwith other lawyers, Home Rule and otherwise in political colour, and\r\nwe are all agreed that the so-called safeguards amount to nothing, and\r\nit would be incomparably safer for England to throw over the country\r\naltogether. Because that is what it must ultimately come to, and we\r\nthink it would be better to avoid the inevitable agitation, the\r\nterrible difficulties foreshadowed by the measure, difficulties which\r\nwould assuredly lead to the reconquest or the attempted reconquest of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n\"Gladstonians say this is an absurd idea, that Ireland could offer no\r\nresistance worth mentioning, that the British arms would prove\r\ninstantly victorious over any show of resistance. But would you have\r\nIreland alone to reckon with? Once give her the prestige of a spurious\r\nindependence, once give to your enemies control over the resources of\r\nthe country, and you would find the task of reconquest much more\r\narduous than you think. The fact that England's distress would be\r\nIreland's opportunity has been so often insisted upon, both by\r\nUnionists and the Nationalists themselves, that I need say nothing on\r\nthis point, which, besides, is so obvious as to be in itself a\r\nsufficient answer to the Home Rule agitation under present\r\ncircumstances. But even supposing that you had no Eastern and European\r\ndifficulty--and we know not from one moment to another when war may\r\nbreak out--supposing you only had Ireland to reconquer, do you think\r\nthis an agreeable prospect? Do you think that reconquest would settle\r\nthe Irish question? Do you believe that the shooting of a few hundred\r\npatriots by the British Grenadiers would further what they call the\r\nUnion of Hearts?\r\n\r\n\"These followers of Mr. Gladstone who say, 'Let them have Home Rule to\r\nquiet the country, to relieve the House from the endless discussion of\r\nthe Irish Question so that we can proceed with the disestablishment of\r\nthe Church, the Local Option Bill, and the thousand-and-one other fads\r\nfor which English Home Rulers have sold themselves'--the men who say\r\nthis, and who also say 'If they kick over the traces we can instantly\r\ntighten the reins and reduce them to order,' surely these folks cannot\r\nbe aware that the Gladstone-Morley Government is unable to give\r\nStrachan, of Tuam, the land which he has bought and paid for in the\r\nLand Courts. The British Government cannot collect the rents of\r\nColonel O'Callaghan, of Bodyke; nor can it prevent the daily cases of\r\nmoonlighting and outrage which are so carefully hushed up, and which\r\nhardly ever get into Irish newspapers. When the British Government\r\ncannot make a few farmers either pay their rent or leave the land, the\r\nsaid Government having control over the police and civil officers of\r\nthe law, how is it going to collect the purchase money of the farms,\r\nin the form of rent, when it has not this control?\r\n\r\n\"The new police will be in the hands of a Parliament, elected by these\r\nvery farmers, who, so to speak, have tasted blood, have ceased to make\r\nefforts to pay rent, have been encouraged in their refusal to pay by\r\nthe very men Mr. Gladstone proposes to entrust with the whole concern!\r\nWill these farmers suddenly turn round and say, 'We declined to pay\r\nwhen English rule would have forced payment, we shall be delighted to\r\npay when nothing could make us do so?' I have been connected with\r\nIrish farmers and landowners for thirty years as a land specialist,\r\nand I tell you that the thing will work exactly as I have said. Put\r\nthe Rebel party in power, and see what will happen to you. It is hard\r\nto believe that Englishmen will act so stupidly in a matter so vitally\r\naffecting their own interests. That is why educated people both in\r\nIreland and England do not believe the bill will ever become law. They\r\ncannot conceive the final acceptance of anything so utterly\r\npreposterous. But call on me to-morrow, and I will go into the legal\r\npossibilities of the question.\"\r\n\r\nSo I gathered posies of bog-bean bloom and walked round the big\r\nboulders with which this sterile region is thickly strewn. The natives\r\nknow nothing of Home or any other Rule, and you might as well speak to\r\nthem of the Darwinian theory, or the philosophy of Herbert Spencer, or\r\nthe Homeric studies of the Grand Old Man, or the origin of the\r\nSanskrit language. The only opinion I could glean was the leading idea\r\nof simple Irish agriculturists everywhere. A young fellow who appeared\r\nto be in a state of intellectual advancement so far beyond that of the\r\nother Barnans as to be almost out of sight, said:--\r\n\r\n\"I'm towld that there's to be a Parlimint in Galway city that's to\r\nfind imploymint for the people, an' that ivery man is to have five\r\nacres of good land for nothin', and that if it isn't good land he is\r\nto have ten acres, and that there's to be an Oirish King in Dublin,\r\nan' that all the sojers an' pleecemen is to be put out o' the\r\ncounthry, an' all Protestants is to go to England, an' that's all very\r\ngood, but the Protestants might be allowed to stay, for they're dacent\r\nfolks, but thin they say that nobody's to howld land but the\r\nCatholics.\"\r\n\r\nI met an old lady clad in the short skirt of the Connaught peasantry,\r\nwalking bare-headed, bare-footed, and almost bare-legged from chapel,\r\ncarrying a bottle of holy water, probably destined for some important\r\npurpose within the sacred precincts of the domestic circle. Perhaps\r\nthe old man was rheumatic, or it may be that the fairies had spoilt\r\nthe butther, or that the cow was bewitched, or that the shadow of a\r\nblack Protestant had fallen across the threshold. She was a promising\r\nsubject for original conversation, but unhappily she could speak no\r\nEnglish. My Galway friend explained the bottle, and said \"Here we have\r\ntrue religion. If you want the genuine, unadulterated article you must\r\ncome to Galway, and especially to Barna. Look how she clings to it,\r\nhow she holds it to her breast, how reverentially she looks down on\r\nit. Suppose she caught her foot on a stone, stumbled, and broke the\r\nbottle! Horrid thought, involving (perhaps) eternal damnation, (unless\r\nshe were quickly absolved by the priest). There is piety for you! As a\r\ngood Catholic I am ashamed of myself when I think how little religion\r\n(comparatively) there is in me. Education has been a curse. How happy\r\nI should be if I had that old woman's simple, strong belief in the\r\nvirtues of holy water, especially when carried home in a well-washed\r\nwhiskey bottle. But, somehow, the more we Catholics know the less we\r\nbelieve. We go regularly to mass, at any rate I do (my wife is very\r\ndevout), but I fear that Catholics have less and less faith in\r\nproportion to their culture. But for the women Catholicism would not\r\nhold its ground among the higher classes of Irishmen for so much as\r\nfive-and-twenty minutes.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the belief of uncultured Irishmen as to the\r\nimmense benefits to be derived from Home Rule is exactly on a par with\r\nthe belief of uncultured Irishwomen as to the immense benefits to be\r\nderived from the sprinkling of holy water. No reasonable man, who has\r\ncarefully examined the subject, will for one moment assert that there\r\nis a pin to choose between the two. The votes of these poor folks,\r\nadmitted by thousands to the electorate, have sent to Westminster the\r\nhireling orators whose persistent clamour has turned a slippery\r\nstatesmen from the paths of patriotism and propriety, and whose\r\nsubterranean machinations--aided and abetted by men versed in\r\nJesuistic and Machiavellian strategy, and who believe that the end\r\njustifies the means--threaten to undermine the British Empire, and to\r\ninvolve the citizens of England in political and financial ruin. A\r\npretty pass for a respectable individual like John Bull. England to be\r\nworked by the wire-pulling of a few under-bred, half-educated priests!\r\nwhose tincture of learning John himself has paid for--poor Bull, who\r\nseems to pay for everything, and who would gladly have paid for\r\ngentility, too, if the Maynooth professors could have injected the\r\ncommodity by means of a hypodermic syringe, or even by hydraulic\r\npressure. No use in attempting impossibilities. As well endeavour to\r\ncommunicate good manners or gratitude to a Nationalist M.P.\r\n\r\nMy legal friend was full of matter, but many of his points were too\r\ntechnical for the general reader. He said:--\"Absurd to ask what an\r\nIrish Parliament _will_ do, because we know the tendencies of the\r\npresent men. We must ask what it _can_ do, for it is certain that its\r\nmembers will from time to time be replaced by men of more 'advanced'\r\nopinions. Appetite grows by what it feeds on, and the Irish people\r\nwant to pose as an independent nation. Englishmen and Scotchmen say\r\nIreland would never be so foolish, and I am not surprised that they\r\nshould say this. But when did Irishmen act on the lines of Englishmen\r\nor Scotchmen? They never did; they never will. The peoples are\r\nactuated by entirely different motives. Englishmen look at what is\r\ngoing to pay. They act on whatever basis promises the most\r\nsubstantial return. Irishmen are swayed by sentiment.\"\r\n\r\nHere I remembered a remark of Father McPhilpin, parish priest of\r\nKilronane, Aran Isles. He said:--\"The Irish people act more for fancy\r\nand less for money than any nation on earth. The poorest classes have\r\nless sentiment than the middle classes. They are too closely engaged\r\nin securing a livelihood. But the great difficulty of the English in\r\nmanaging the Irish lies in the fact that the English people work on\r\nstrictly business principles, and that the Irish do not. The English\r\npeople do not at all understand the Irish; and the reason is perfectly\r\nclear to me. They do not appreciate the extent to which mere sentiment\r\nwill move the Irish race, mere sentiment, as opposed to what you would\r\ncall business principles.\"\r\n\r\nReturning to my barrister. He continued:--\"The Dublin bar has\r\ndecided--has formally decided--that so far as the action of the\r\nExecutive is concerned the Irish Parliament will be a supreme and\r\nirresponsible body. The action of its officers will not be in any way\r\nsubject to the review of the English Government. What does this mean?\r\nSimply that the life, the liberty, the property of every citizen will\r\nbe entirely in the hands of the Irish Government. Do the English\r\npeople know this? I think not. For if they did know, surely they would\r\nthink twice before they committed decent people to the tender mercies\r\nof the inventors and supporters of the Land League, with its ten\r\nthousand stories of outrage and murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give instances of what they can do, say you? They can refuse police\r\nprotection to persons whose lives are in danger from the National\r\nLeague. And, as you know, scores of persons are at this moment under\r\nprotection in Ireland. Mr. Blood, of Ennis, would be shot on sight;\r\nMr. Strachan, of Tuam, would be torn to pieces, if without the three,\r\nor four policemen who watch over him day and night; the caretakers on\r\nthe Bodyke estate would get very short shrift, once the sixteen\r\npolicemen who guard the two men were removed. Blood discharged a\r\nlabourer, Strachan bought a farm. If, under the now _régime_, a farmer\r\npaid rent against the orders of the National League; if a man\r\npersisted in holding land from which someone had been evicted years\r\nago; if a man worked for a boycotted person or in any way supported\r\nhim, although it were his own father, he would be in danger of his\r\nlife. Would the new Government give police protection to such people?\r\nTo do so would be to stultify themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Then again the Irish Executive can refuse police protection to\r\nSheriffs' officers who desire to execute writs for non-payment of\r\nrent. No, I do _not_ think they would refuse a police escort to\r\nSheriffs' officers proceeding to distrain on the Belfast\r\nmanufacturers. I think they would order a strong force to proceed,\r\nfully armed, and I am of opinion that the police would require all the\r\nweapons they could carry. Not a stiver would they get in Belfast,\r\nuntil backed by the Queen's troops. Then the Ulstermen would pay--to\r\nrefuse next year. So the process will go on and on, with bloodshed\r\nand slaughter every time, the British army enforcing the demands of\r\nrebels, against loyalists who sing 'God save the Queen,' Quite in the\r\nopera bouffe style of Gilbert and Sullivan, isn't it? Can't you get\r\nGilbert to do a Home Rule opera comique? The absurdities of the\r\nsituation are already there. No invention required. Immense hit. Wish\r\nI knew Gilbert. Money in it. English people might see the thing in the\r\ntrue light, if presented in comic songs, with a rattling chorus.\r\nFriend of mine bringing out a Gladstone Suppression Company Unlimited,\r\nforty million shares at twopence-halfpenny each. At a premium already.\r\nMoney subscribed ten times over.\"\r\n\r\n\"And won't the new Parliament have a high old time with the new Land\r\nCommission. Messrs. Healy and Co. will have the appointment of the\r\nLand Commissioners, whose function will be to fix rent. Wouldn't you\r\nlike to be a landlord under such conditions? Don't you think that the\r\nrents will be reduced until the landlords are used up? Remember that\r\nthe total extinction of the landlords and their expulsion from the\r\ncountry have been over and over again promised by the very men in\r\nwhose hands you, or rather Mr. Gladstone will place them. No; I\r\nexculpate the English people from returning him to power, I know that\r\nthe brains of England as well as those of Ireland are against him. But\r\nthe English people stand by and see the thing pressed forward, hoping\r\nfor the best. They rely on their immense wealth and energy to get them\r\nout of any hole they may get into. I am reminded of Captain Webb, who\r\nsaid, 'I am bound to have a go at the Niagara rapids. I know it's\r\ninfernal risky and therefore infernally foolish, but I must have cash,\r\nand I expect I shall pull through somehow.' And I once met a sailor\r\nwho said that his skipper had not his equal for getting the ship out\r\nof a scrape, nor yet his equal for getting into one. Same with\r\nEngland. Webb did not come up again. Might be the same with Bull.\r\nEngland is risking all for peace, just as Webb risked all for money.\r\n\r\n\"The Irish Parliament may, after three years, break every contract\r\nhaving regard to land, no matter when or how made. Think of the\r\nferment during that three years of waiting. Think of the situation of\r\nfarmers as well as that of landowners. Who will work the land and do\r\nthe best for the country without security? Then the College Green\r\nfolks will have power to establish an armed and disciplined force. The\r\nIrish Army of Independence is already recruiting all over the country.\r\nFor what? Is it to assist England? Is it friendly to England? Why, the\r\nvery foundation of its sentiment is undying animosity to England. And\r\nyour English Home Rulers say, 'Quite right, too, the Irish have good\r\nreason for their hatred!' Gladstonians come over here, mingle with\r\nhaters of their native land, and earn a little cheap popularity by\r\nslanging John Bull. They get excellent receptions when they speak in\r\nthat vein, especially if they have any money to spend. But what do the\r\nIrish think of them? The poor fools make me sick, splashing their cash\r\nabout and vilifying England for the cheers of Fenians and the\r\npatronage of Maynooth priests. A lady from Wolverhampton, a good, kind\r\nlady, was woefully imposed upon somewhere in Connemara. A priest told\r\nme; a priest you have met.\" Here the name was given. \"He laughed at\r\nthe simplicity of this well-meaning benefactor, who was shown nineteen\r\nprocesses for rent, and who shelled out very liberally at the sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seventeen of them were old ones! The rent had already been paid. But\r\nwhenever an English _gobemouche_ called around out came the old writs\r\nuntil they were clean worn out. They were a splendid source of income\r\nwhile they lasted.\"\r\n\r\nThis reminded me of a Bodyker, who said:--\"A man named Lancashire came\r\nhere from Manchester or Birmingham--I think it was Birmingham--and\r\nsaid he was going into the next Parliament, and that he was a great\r\nfriend of Mr. Gladstone. He was very kind, and seemed made of money,\r\nand said he'd make England ring with our wrongs. My son had his name\r\non a card, but a lawyer in Limerick said the name hadn't got in. I\r\nforget it now. D'ye know anybody, Sorr, of the name of Lancashire\r\nthat's a great friend o' Misther Gladstone, an' that lives in\r\nBirmingham, an' that didn't get in?\"\r\n\r\nThese Irish peasants ask more questions than anybody can answer. They\r\nhave a keen scent for cash, especially when the coin is in the keeping\r\nof English Gladstonians. They believe with the Claimant that \"Sum\r\nfolks has branes, and sum folks has money, and them what has money is\r\nmade for them what has branes.\" The Bodyke farmers and the peasantry\r\nof Connemara believe that English Home Rulers have money. Impossible\r\nto escape the natural inference.\r\n\r\nBarna (Co. Galway), May 30th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 29.--WHAT RACK-RENT MEANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am disposed to call this quiet inland place a fishing village. The\r\npeople not only sell fish and eat fish, but they talk fish, read fish,\r\nthink fish, dream fish. The fishing industry keeps the place going.\r\nAnglers swarm hither from every part of the three kingdoms. Last year\r\nthere were five fishing Colonels at the Greville Arms all at once.\r\nBrown-faced people who live in the open air, and who are deeply versed\r\nin the mysteries of tackle, cunning in the ways of trout, pike, perch,\r\nand salmon, walk the streets clad in tweed suits, with strong shoes\r\nand knickerbockers. The Mullingar folks despise the dictum of the\r\nAmerican economist who said that every town without a river should buy\r\none, as they are handy things to have. They boast of three magnificent\r\nlakes, and they look down on the Athlone people, thirty miles away,\r\nwith their trumpery Shannon, of which they are so proud, but which the\r\nMullingar folks will tell you is not worth the paper it is written\r\non. Lough Owel, five miles long by two or three wide; Lough\r\nDerravarra, six miles by three or four; and Lough Belvidere, eight\r\nmiles by three, all of which are in the immediate vicinity, may be\r\nconsidered a tolerable allowance of fishing water for one country\r\ntown. Lough Belvidere, formerly called Lough Ennell, with its\r\nthousands of acres of water, would perhaps meet with the approval of\r\nthe Yankee who called the Mediterranean \"a nice pond,\" not for its\r\nsize, but for its exceeding beauty. And the most remarkable feature\r\nabout the fisher-enthusiasts of Mullingar, is the fact, the undoubted,\r\nwell-attested fact, that they actually catch fish. English anglers,\r\nwho in response to the inquiries of new arrivals at any Anglican\r\nfishing resort state that they have caught nothing yet, having only\r\nbeen fishing for a fortnight, will hardly believe that at Mullingar\r\ntheir countrymen catch fish every day, and big fish too. The lake\r\ntrout vary from five to twenty pounds in weight, but the latter are\r\nnot often seen. Nine-pounders are reckoned fairly good, but this\r\nweight excites no remark. How big the pike may be I know not, but Mr.\r\nHerring, of London, on Monday last, fishing in Lough Derravarra,\r\nhauled out a specimen which looked more like a shark than a pike. He\r\nweighed over thirty-six pounds, and measured four feet three inches\r\nover all. _Hoc egomet oculis meis vidi._ Birmingham anglers who win\r\nprizes with takes of four-and-a-half ounces would have recoiled in\r\naffright from the monster, even as he lay dead in the entrance hall of\r\nthe Greville Arms. Old women stand at the street corners with silver\r\neels like boa-constrictors, for which they wish to smite the Saxon to\r\nthe tune of sixpence each. I vouch for the pike and eels, but confess\r\nto some dubiety _re_ the story of a fat old English gentleman, who\r\nsaid, \"I don't care for fishing for the sake of catching fish. I go\r\nout in a boat, hook a big pike, lash the line to the bow, and let the\r\nbeggar tow me about all day. Boating is my delight. Towards evening I\r\ncut my charger loose, and we part with mutual regret. Inexpensive\r\namusement; more humane than ordinary fishing.\"\r\n\r\nMullingar is a thriving town situate in a fertile district. The land\r\nis very rich, and the rents are reasonable. The farmers are well off,\r\nand admit the soft impeachment. They are Home Rulers to a man, and\r\nthey boldly give their reasons. \"Did ye ever know a man who was\r\ncontint wid a good bargain when he has a prospect of a better bargain\r\nstill?\" said a prosperous agriculturist residing a mile outside the\r\ntown. The country around has a decidedly English appearance. Fat land,\r\ngood roads, high hedges, daisied meadows, and decent houses\r\neverywhere. The main street is long, wide, clean, well-paved,\r\nwell-built. The shopkeepers who live in the surrounding district make\r\nmoney, and when they \"go before,\" cut up for surprising sums. Said Mr.\r\nGordon, \"Everybody here has money. The people are downright well off.\r\nLiving in constant communication with Dublin, fifty miles away on the\r\nmain line of the Midland and Western Railway, they have adopted the\r\nprevailing politics of the metropolis. They do not understand what\r\nHome Rule means, and they blindly believe that they will do better\r\nstill under a Dublin Parliament. I am quite certain of the contrary.\r\nSuppose we want £500 for some improvement, who will lend us the money?\r\nI am satisfied that the prosperity of the place would immediately\r\ndecline. The priests influence the people to an extent Englishmen can\r\nnever understand. The Protestant clergy do not intervene in mundane\r\nmatters, but the Catholic clergy consider it their duty to guide the\r\npeople in politics as well as in religion. Given Home Rule,\r\nProtestantism and Protestants would be nowhere. There is no doubt in\r\nmy mind on this point.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mason said:--\"The whole agitation would be knocked on the head by\r\nthe introduction of a severe land measure, which would have the effect\r\nof further reducing the rents. No doubt all previous land legislation\r\nhas been very severe, and I do not say that a further measure would be\r\njust and equitable. I merely say that the people do not want Home\r\nRule, but they want the advantages which they are told will accrue\r\nfrom Home Rule. If the measure is not to benefit them in a pecuniary\r\nsense, then they do not care two straws about it. Do the English\r\npeople grasp the present position of landowner and tenant\r\nrespectively? Let me state it in a very few words.--\r\n\r\n\"Formerly the landowner was regarded as the owner of the land. At the\r\npresent moment, and without a line of further legislation, the tenant\r\nis the real owner, and not the nominal landlord at all. For owing to\r\nreduction of rent, fixity of tenure, free sale, and the tenant-right,\r\nthe tenant is actually more than two-thirds owner. This is a matter of\r\ncash and not of theory, for the tenants' rights are at this moment\r\nworth more than double the fee-simple of the land itself. What will\r\nthe Gladstonian party who prate about Rack-rents say to this?\"\r\n\r\nThis seems a suitable opportunity for calling attention to the term\r\nRack-rents, which in England is almost universally misunderstood.\r\nSeparatist speakers invariably use the term as denoting an excessive\r\nrent, an impossible rent--a rent, which is, as it were, extorted by\r\nmeans of the Rack. The term is purely legal, and denotes a rent paid\r\nby ALL yearly tenants, whether their rent, as a whole, be high or low.\r\nThe lowest-rented yearly tenant in the country is paying Rack-rent.\r\nThe whole case for the farmers has been obscured and a false issue\r\nraised by the constant use of this term, to which a new meaning has\r\nbeen given. Another common term is found in the word Head-rent, of\r\nwhich Gladstonians know no more than of Rack-rent. When Head-rent\r\ncomes to be discussed in England we shall have Home Rulers explaining\r\nthat the term refers to decapitation of tenants for non-payment of\r\nRack-rent. This explanation will not present any appreciable departure\r\nfrom their usual vein. An English Home Ruler who supports Mr.\r\nGladstone \"because his father did,\" and who first landed in Ireland\r\nyesterday, said, \"I do not approve of ascendency. Hang the rights of\r\nproperty! Give me the rights of intellect. Let us have equality.\r\nTreat the Irish fairly, even generously. They should have equal rights\r\nwith Englishmen. Why keep them down by force of bayonets? Live and let\r\nlive, that's what I say. Equal laws and equal rights for all.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the usual patter of the self-satisfied Separatist, who, having\r\ndelivered himself, looks around him with an air which seems to\r\nsay--\"What a fine fellow I am, how generous, fair, disinterested. Have\r\nI not a noble soul? Did you ever see such magnanimity? Can anybody say\r\nanything against such sentiments? Thank heaven that I am not as other\r\nmen, nor even as this Unionist.\" He is plausible, but no more. The mob\r\nwhich applauds the hero and hisses the villain of a melodrama pats him\r\non the back, while he looks upward with his hand on his heart and a\r\nheaven-is-my-home expression in his eye. Put him under the\r\nmicroscope--he needs it, and you will see him as he is. The platitudes\r\nin which he lives, and moves, and has his being have no foundation in\r\nfact. His talk is grand, but it lacks substance. It is magnificent,\r\nbut it is not sense. Listen to what a statesman has said:--\r\n\r\n\"I have looked in vain for the setting forth of any practical scheme\r\nof policy which the Imperial Parliament is not equal to deal with, and\r\nwhich it refuses to deal with, and which is to be brought about by\r\nHome Rule.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing Ireland has asked, and which this country and this\r\nParliament has refused. This Parliament has done for Ireland what it\r\nwould have scrupled to do for England or Scotland.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are the inequalities of England and Ireland? I declare that I\r\nknow none, except that there are certain taxes still remaining, which\r\nare levied over Englishmen and Scotchmen, and which are not levied\r\nover Irishmen; and, likewise, that there are certain purposes for\r\nwhich public money is freely and largely given in Ireland, and for\r\nwhich it is not given in England and Scotland.\"\r\n\r\nI read this deliverance to my Gladstonian friend, who was staggered to\r\nlearn upon incontrovertible evidence, to wit, the printed report of\r\nhis speech, that these were the publicly expressed opinions of the\r\nGrand Old Man, whose pandering to Irish opinion as expressed by\r\noutrage dates from the time of the Clerkenwell explosion. That his\r\nconversion to Home Rule is entirely attributable to the endless\r\nmurders and atrocities of the Land League, the Invincibles, and other\r\nFenian organisations, is universally admitted in Ireland by Unionists\r\nand Nationalists alike. And once an Irish Parliament is granted, how\r\nwill he resist the demand for Irish independence, for the Irish\r\nRepublic affiliated with America? Query--if a given number of murders\r\nwere required to bring about Home Rule, how many murders will be\r\nrequired to effect complete separation? A mere question in arithmetic.\r\n\r\nConcurrently with the compulsory withdrawal of the Union Jack\r\ndisplayed by my friend Mrs. Gibson, of Northern Hotel, Londonderry,\r\nanother occurrence, this time in the South, will serve to attest the\r\nprogress made by the inventor and patentee of the Union of Hearts.\r\nDuring the progress of a cricket match on the Killarney Athletic\r\nGrounds, between the clubs of Limerick and Kerry, on Whit-Monday, a\r\nUnion Jack was hoisted, not as a political banner, but as an ornament,\r\nand the only banner available for the purpose. It was left flying when\r\nthe cricketers went home, but in the morning it lay prone and\r\ndishonoured. The forty-foot spar had been sawn through, and in falling\r\nhad smashed the palings. Let a chorus of musical Gladstonians march\r\nthrough Ireland bearing the Union Jack and singing \"God save the\r\nQueen,\" let them do it, with or without police protection, and I will\r\ngladly watch their progress, record their prowess, and will have great\r\npleasure in writing their obituary notice. The people, as a whole, are\r\nenemies to England. They are filled with a blind, unreasoning,\r\nimplacable resentment for injuries they have never received, their\r\ndislike engendered and sustained by lying priests and selfish\r\nagitators, who are hastening to achieve their ends, alarmed at the\r\nprospect of popular enlightenment, which would for ever hurl them from\r\npower. The opinions of Cardinal Logue have been quoted by Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill. The _Freeman's Journal_ is still more absolute.\r\nDoes this sound like the Union of Hearts? Does this give earnest of\r\nfinal settlement, of unbroken peace and contentment, of eternal\r\nfraternity and friendship? The _Freeman_ says, \"We contend that the\r\ngood government of Ireland by England is _impossible_, not so much by\r\nreason of natural obstacles, but because of the radical, essential\r\ndifference in the public order of the two countries. This, considered\r\nin the abstract, makes a gulf profound, impassible--_an obstacle no\r\nhuman ingenuity can remove or overcome_.\"\r\n\r\nThis promises well for the success of the Home Rule Bill; but why is\r\nthe thing \"impossible\"? Why is the gulf not only profound but also\r\n\"impassible\"? Why is the good government of Ireland by England\r\nprevented by an obstacle beyond human ability to remove, and which, as\r\nMr. Gladstone would say, \"passes the wit of man.\" The _Freeman_ has no\r\nobjection to tell us. The writer assumes a high moral standpoint,\r\naddressing the eminently respectable and religious Mr. Bull more in\r\nsorrow than in anger, but notwithstanding this, in a style to which\r\nthat highly moral and Twenty-shillings-in-the-pound-paying person is\r\nnot at all accustomed. The _Freeman_ goes on--\r\n\r\n\"We find ourselves bound by reason and logic to deny to English\r\ncivilisation the glorious title of Christian.\"\r\n\r\nThis is distinctly surprising. John always believed himself a\r\nChristian. The natural pain he may be expected to undergo after this\r\ndisagreeable discovery is luckily to some extent mitigated by the\r\ninformation that although England is not Christian, Ireland is\r\nextremely so. The one people (the Irish) \"has not only accepted but\r\nretained with inviolable constancy the Christian civilisation;\" the\r\nother (the English) \"has not only rejected it, but has been for three\r\ncenturies the leader of the great apostacy, and is at this day _the\r\nprincipal obstacle to the conversion of the world_.\"\r\n\r\nDo the English Separatists see daylight now? Will they any longer deny\r\nwhat all intelligent Irishmen of whatever creed readily admit, namely,\r\nthat religion is at the bottom of the Home Rule question? And is not\r\nMr. Bull surprised to find that after all his missionary collections,\r\nhe is without the right balm of Gilead, that his civilisation is not\r\nChristian, and that he is the principal obstacle to the salvation of\r\nthe world? Is he not surprised to find that Ireland, with its thousand\r\nand ten thousand tales of horror, its brutal outrages on helpless\r\nwomen, its chronic incendiarism, its myriads of indecent anonymous\r\nletters addressed to young girls, such as I have seen filed by the\r\nream in Irish police-stations--Ireland with its moonlighting\r\natrocities, its barbarous boycotting of helpless children, its\r\npoisoning of wells and water supply, its mutilation of cattle, its\r\nunnumbered foul and cowardly murders, its habitual sheltering and\r\nprotection of unspeakable felons--Ireland, one of the few remaining\r\nstrongholds of the Catholic faith, has the true Christianity? Ireland\r\nwould convert the world, but England stops her. The No-rent manifesto,\r\nthe Plan of Campaign, and the Land League were sample productions of\r\nthe genuine faith, to say nothing of Horsewhipped Healy, Breeches\r\nO'Brien, and T.D. Sullivan, who composed a eulogy on the murderers of\r\nPolice-sergeant Brett, of Manchester (Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien),\r\n\r\n    High upon the gallows tree\r\n    Swung the noble-hearted three.\r\n\r\nThat is all I can remember, but it may serve to show that Irish\r\nChristianity is the real stingo, and no mistake.\r\n\r\nA Mullingaringian who wishes to be nameless desires to know\r\nparticulars of the gorging capacity of the average Gladstonian\r\nelector. The particular item that excites his wonder is the letter of\r\nMr. J.W. Logan, M.P., on Irish rents. Briefly stated, Mr. Logan's\r\npoint is this: That notwithstanding the complaints of Irish landlords\r\nthey are getting more rent than ever! And he proceeds to adduce\r\ntestimony thus: Income-tax valuation in Ireland, on land, in three\r\nyears selected by himself stands as follows:--\r\n\r\n    1861            £8,990,830\r\n    1877            £9,937,681\r\n    1891            £9,941,368\r\n\r\nThen, after showing the amount of increase, he says:--\"Rents continue\r\nto rise in Ireland as far as is indicated by the income-tax.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend says:--\"Mr. Logan is both culpably ignorant and flagrantly\r\ndishonest. He seems incapable of understanding the difference between\r\nan assessment, a mere valuation, and the actual payment of income-tax.\r\nHe is dishonest, because he deliberately suppresses the explanation of\r\nthe difference between the first and second row of figures. When I saw\r\nthe curiously-selected years, I said, why 1861, 1877, and 1891? I knew\r\nthere was some thimble-rigging. I looked at the twenty-eighth annual\r\nreport of her Majesty's Commissioners, that for 1885, the latest I\r\nhave, and behold, the year 1877 had an asterisk! It was the only\r\nstarred number on the page. It referred to a foot-note, and that\r\nfoot-note read as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"'_The large difference as compared with prior years is due to the\r\nvalue of farmhouses having been previously included under the head of\r\nmessuages._'\r\n\r\n\"The land up to '77 was called land, and the farm buildings were\r\ncalled messuages. But in '77 they began to reckon the buildings as\r\nland, shifting an amount from one column of figures to another. A mere\r\nmatter of book-keeping. Mr. Logan writes to the papers for an\r\nexplanation which is given in a footnote. He carries his point, for\r\nhundreds of people will follow his figures. Give a lie twenty-four\r\nhours' start and you can never overtake it. Thrice is he armed who\r\nhath his quarrel just, But four times he who gets his blow in fust. I\r\nsuppose the Gladstonians claim that the Land Commission reduced rents\r\nby 25 to 30 per cent. But here Mr. Logan is proving that the landlords\r\nare drawing more money than ever! They wish they could believe it.\r\nValuation is a queer thing. It fluctuates in the most unaccountable\r\nway. What an increase shows is the prosperity of the tenant who is\r\nputting up buildings and making other improvements. Mr. Logan's third\r\nfigures show a further increase. Look at the figures in the authorised\r\nReport, not for '77 and '91, but between the two. What do you see\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\nI looked, and this is what I saw:--\r\n\r\n    1880            £9,980,543\r\n    1881            £9,980,650\r\n    1882            £9,980,215\r\n    1883            £9,981,156\r\n    1884            £9,982,072\r\n    1885            £9,982,031\r\n    1886            £9,954,535\r\n\r\nSo that Mr. Logan might have shown from these figures that during the\r\nNo-Rent Campaign the landlords were enjoying an untold period of\r\nprosperity, for his chosen year, 1891, shows a _decrease_ as compared\r\nwith any one of the seven years above-mentioned. The truth is that the\r\nfigures prove nothing in support of Mr. Logan's case, which is based\r\non fallacy and suppression of material facts. His comparison of 1861\r\nwith 1877, without reference to the explanatory footnote, is of itself\r\nsufficient to shoulder him out of court, and stamps him as little more\r\nscrupulous than Father Humphreys, of venerated memory. Mr. Logan's\r\nbelief that assessment and tax-paying are one and the same thing is\r\nhere regarded as ridiculous, and my friend thinks that if Mr.\r\nGladstone should impose a tax on Brains, the Grand Old Man's followers\r\nwill escape with an easy assessment.\r\n\r\nMullingar (Co. Westmeath), June 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 30.--THE \"UNION OF HEARTS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was strange to hear the tune of \"Rule Britannia\" in the streets of\r\nMullingar. The Irish madden at \"God Save the Queen,\" and would make\r\nshort work of the performer. It was market day, and the singer was\r\nselling printed sheets of poesy. The old tune was fairly correct, but\r\nthe words were strange and sad. \"When Britain first at Hell's command\r\nPrepared to cross the Irish main, Thus spake a prophet in our land,\r\n'Mid traitors' scoff and fools' disdain, 'If Britannia cross the\r\nwaves, Irish ever shall be slaves.' In vain the warning patriot spoke,\r\nIn treach'rous guise Britannia came--Divided, bent us to her yoke,\r\nTill Ireland rose, in Freedom's name, and Britannia boldly braves!\r\nIrish are no longer slaves.\" The people were too busily engaged in\r\nselling pigs to pay much attention to the minstrel who, however, was\r\nplainly depending on disloyalty for custom. Westmeath was once the\r\nhome of Whiteboyism, Ribbonism, Fenianism, and all the other isms\r\nwhich have successively ruined the country by banishing security; and\r\na spice of the old leaven still flavours the popular sentiment. \"They\r\nmay swear as they often did our wretchedness to cure, But we'll never\r\ntrust John Bull again nor let his lies allure. No we won't Bull, we\r\nwon't Bull, for now nor ever more; For we've hopes on the ocean, we've\r\ntrust on the shore. Oh! remember the days when their reign we did\r\ndisturb, At Limerick and Thurles, Blackwater and Benburb. And ask this\r\nproud Saxon if our blows he did enjoy When we met him on the\r\nbattlefield of France, at Fontenoy. Then we'll up for the green, boys,\r\nand up for the green! Oh! 'tis still in the dust and a shame to be\r\nseen! But we've hearts and we've hands, boys, full strong enough, I\r\nween, To rescue and to raise again our own unsullied green.\" A group\r\nof farmers standing hard by paid some attention to this chant, and one\r\nof them, in answer to my inquiry as to how the Union of Hearts was\r\ngetting on, chuckled vociferously and said, \"Aye, aye, Union iv\r\nHearts, how are ye? How are ye, Union iv Hearts?\" The group joined in\r\nthe laugh, and I saw that the joke was an old one.\r\n\r\nThe Invincibles had a few recruits in Mullingar and district, and the\r\nLand Leaguers also made their mark. The stationmaster sued somebody\r\nfor travelling without a ticket. He was shot dead in the street\r\nimmediately afterwards. Miss Croughan did not meet popular opinion in\r\nthe matter of farm management. She was shot as she walked to church\r\none fine Sunday morning. Patrick Farrelly took land which somebody\r\nelse wanted. Shot as he walked home from work. Mr. Dolan, of a flour\r\nmill in the neighbourhood, had some misunderstanding with his workmen.\r\nShot, on the chance that his successor would take warning, and\r\naccommodate himself to the public sentiment. Miss Ann Murphy, who with\r\nher two brothers lives at a small farm a mile or two away, supplied a\r\njug of milk, and said that things were quiet for the moment, but there\r\nwas no telling what might happen. The house was roofed with corrugated\r\niron. \"Ah,\" said Miss Murphy, \"we were nearly burned to death, myself\r\nan' my two brothers. An' this was the way iv it. Tramps and ruffians\r\nwould call here at nightfall, an' would ask for a shelter an' a lie\r\ndown, an' I would lay a few bags or something on the flure over\r\nbeyant, an' they would sthretch themselves out till mornin', an' often\r\nand often I would wash their cheeks an' heads where they had been\r\nfightin', an' would be all cut an' hacked. One fellow was often here,\r\nan' my brothers had reason to refuse him free lodgin's, an' so the\r\nnext mornin' we found the gate lifted off the hinges an' carried away\r\ndown the lane. My brothers spoke to the police-sergeant about this,\r\nan' the very next thing was to try to burn us alive in our beds. Some\r\nruffian came in the night an' put a match in the thatch, an' I woke\r\nalmost suffocated. I ran out, an' there was the house on fire, and the\r\ncow-house, with a beautiful, lovely cow, all a solid piece of blazin'\r\nflames, till ye could see nothin' else. We saved the four walls an'\r\nsome of the furniture, an' we got £50 from the County. That's the sort\r\nof people the Land League brought out all over the country.\"\r\n\r\nA sturdy farmer living near said:--\"An' that's what we'll have to\r\nsuffer again, once ye let Home Rulers have the upper hand. The only\r\nway ye can manage these scamps is to make them feel the lash. No good\r\ntomfooling with these murdherin' ruffians. With Home Rule they expect\r\nto do as they like. If I go into a whiskey shop on a market day, what\r\ndo I hear? Ever an' always the same things. There is to be no\r\nlandlords, no policemen, no means of enforcing the law. There ye have\r\nit, now. The respectable people who work and make money will be a mark\r\nfor every robber in the country. An' in Ireland ye can rob and murther\r\nwidout fear of consequences. See that hill there? Mrs. Smith had her\r\nbrains blown out as she drove by the foot of it. They meant the shot\r\nfor her husband, who was with her. They don't make many mistakes. They\r\nbide their time, avoid hurry, and do the work both nately an'\r\ncomplately. They track down their victims like sleuth hounds, an'\r\nthere's one thing they never go in for,--that's executions. Mrs.\r\nSmith, Farrelly, Dolan, Miss Croughan, and the stationmaster, were all\r\ncomfortably shot without anyone incurring evil consequences. It's\r\ndevilish hard to catch an Irishman, an' when ye've caught him it's\r\nharder still to convict him. They're improvin' in their plannin', but\r\nthey are not so sure o' their shootin' as they used to be. They fired\r\nat Moloney from both sides of the road at once. That was a good idea.\r\nBut they failed to kill him, and seven of them are arrested. Of\r\ncourse, we'll have no convictions, but it looks better to arrest them,\r\nan' it ensures the man that's arrested a brass band an' a collection.\r\nSo everybody's pleased an' nobody hurt. An' what would ye ask for\r\nmore?\"\r\n\r\nOn Thursday last, at eleven in the morning, Mr. Weldon C. Moloney,\r\nsolicitor, of Dublin, was driving near Milltown, on the Bodyke\r\nproperty, when he was wounded from the ankle to the thigh by several\r\nsimultaneous shots from both sides of the road, and the horse so badly\r\ninjured that it must probably be destroyed. Mr. Moloney believes that\r\nhe will be able to identify his assailants, and the police are sure\r\nthey have the right men. Nothing, therefore, is now wanting to the\r\nformalities accompanying the Morley administration of Justice but the\r\nmarch to Court, the cheers of the crowd, the twelve good men and\r\ntrue--who, having sworn to return a verdict in accordance with the\r\nevidence, will assuredly say Not Guilty--and the brass band to\r\naccompany the marksmen home. If the heroes of this adventure be\r\nliberated in the evening a torchlight procession will make the thing\r\ncomplete, and will be handy for burning the haystacks of anyone who\r\nmay not have joined the promenade.\r\n\r\nAthlone is well built and beautifully situated. The Shannon winds\r\nround the town, and also cuts it in two, so that one-half is in County\r\nWestmeath, province of Leinster, the other in County Roscommon,\r\nprovince of Connaught. The people are fairly well clad, but dirt and\r\nsqualor such as can hardly be conceived are plentiful enough. The\r\nShannon Saw Mills, which for twenty years have given employment to two\r\nhundred men, will shortly be removed to Liverpool, and the Athloners\r\nare sad at heart and refuse to be comforted. The concern belongs to\r\nWilson, of Todmorden, Lancashire; and the manager, Mr. Lewis Jones,\r\nsays that all the timber within reasonable distance is used up,\r\nbesides which the place is not well fixed for business purposes. The\r\nworkpeople are manageable enough, but somewhat uncertain in their\r\nattendance. They require a half-hour extra at breakfast time every now\r\nand then, perhaps twenty times a year or more, that they may attend\r\nmass, on the saints' days and such like occasions.\r\n\r\nThis reminded me of my first entrance to Galway. All the bridges and\r\nother lounging places were covered with men who looked as if they\r\nought to be at work. It was Ascension Day, and nobody struck a stroke.\r\nMy invasion of Athlone afforded a similar experience. There were\r\nsixty-five able-bodied men lounging on the Shannon bridge at three in\r\nthe afternoon--all deeply anxious to know whence I came and whither I\r\nwas going, all with an intense desire to learn my particular business.\r\nOther pauper factories were in full swing, and at the first blush it\r\nseemed that the Athloners lived by looking at the river and discussing\r\nthe affairs of other people. It was Corpus Christi Day, and none but\r\nheathen would work. The brutal Saxon with his ding-dong persistency\r\nmay be making money, but how about his future interests? When the last\r\ntrump shall sound and the dead shall be raised, where will be the\r\nworkers on saints' days? Among the goats. But the men who spend these\r\nholy seasons in smoking thick twist, with the Shannon for a spittoon,\r\nwill reap the reward of their self-denial.\r\n\r\nMr. Lewis Jones has always taken a strong interest in politics, and\r\nhis present opinion is remarkable. \"I came to Ireland a Gladstonian, a\r\nHome Ruler, and, what is more, a bigoted Home Ruler. How the change to\r\nmy present opinion was brought about I hardly know. It was not\r\nrevolution, but rather evolution. No-one can remain a Home Ruler when\r\nhe understands the subject. The change in myself came about through\r\nmuch travelling all over the country and mixing with the people. I do\r\nnot blame the English Home Rulers a bit. How can I do so, when I\r\nmyself was just as ignorant? Had I remained in Liverpool I should have\r\nremained a Home Ruler. I am certain of that. Unless you actually live\r\nin the country you cannot gauge its feeling, and the Irish people are\r\nvery difficult to understand. I have always got along with them\r\nfamously, and I shall take ninety per cent. of our workmen with me to\r\nEngland. No, Home Rule has nothing to do with the removal of the\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n\"My cousin and I worked like horses to get in Mr. Neville for the\r\nExchange Division of Liverpool. We actually won, for by a piece of\r\nadroit management we polled a number of votes which would certainly\r\nhave remained unpolled, and we polled them all for our man, who won by\r\na very small majority, eleven, I think. I would willingly go to\r\nLiverpool to undo that work, as I now see how completely I was\r\nmistaken in my views of the Irish question. I was always a great\r\nRadical, and such I shall always remain; but as a Radical I am bound\r\nto support what is best for the masses of the people, and I am\r\nconvinced that Home Rule would reduce the country to beggary.\r\nBankruptcy must and will ensue, and with the flight of the landowners\r\nand the destruction of confidence, employment will be unobtainable.\r\nWho will embark capital in Ireland under present circumstances?\"\r\n\r\nA financial authority told me that poor Ireland has thirty-six\r\nmillions of uninvested money lying idle in the banks. The Irish not\r\nonly lack enterprise, but they will not trust each other. Great\r\nopportunities are lying thickly around, but they seem unable to avail\r\nthemselves of the finest openings. Mr. Smith, of Athlone, makes twelve\r\nand a half miles of Irish tweed every week, and sells it rather faster\r\nthan he can make it. He commenced with two shillings a week wages, and\r\nnow he owns a factory and employs five hundred people. A Black\r\nProtestant, of course. Mr. Samuel Heaton, of Bradford, is about to go\r\nand do likewise. I went over his place an hour ago, and this is what\r\nhe said:--\"This was a flour mill which cost £10,000 to build. The\r\nmachinery would cost £10,000 more, I should think. It did well for\r\nmany years, and then it was left to three brothers, who disputed about\r\nit until the concern was ruined as a paying business, and the place\r\nwas allowed to lie derelict. The water power alone cost them £100 a\r\nyear, and goodness knows what these splendid buildings would be worth.\r\nThe Board of Works had got hold of it, and it was understood that\r\nanybody might have it a bargain, but nobody came forward. I offered\r\nthem £30 a year for the whole of the buildings, the waterpower, and\r\nthe dwelling house hard by, also that other immense building yonder,\r\nwhich might prove handy for a store-house; and my offer was accepted.\r\nI took all at that rent for sixty years, with six months' free tenancy\r\nto start with, and I was also to have a free gift of all machinery and\r\nfittings in the place. Here we are going nicely, only in a small way,\r\nbut we shall do. We make blankets, tweeds for men's suits and ladies'\r\ndresses. When the Athlone people saw us knocking about they were\r\nsurprised they had never thought of it before. There are hundreds of\r\nderelict flour mills going to ruin all over the country, and the\r\nowners would gladly let anyone have them and grand water power for\r\nnothing for two or three years, just to get a chance of obtaining rent\r\nat some future day. We work from morning till night, and neither I nor\r\nmy sons have ever tasted a spot of intoxicating liquor. Now there are\r\nmany small mills going in the country, the proprietors of which go on\r\nthe spree three days a week. If they can do, we can do. This is going\r\nto be a big thing. The only difficulty I have is to turn out the\r\nstuff. Irish tweeds have such a reputation that we simply cannot meet\r\nthe demand. Mills and water power may be had for next to nothing, but\r\nthe Irish have no enterprise, and the English are afraid to put any\r\nmoney in the country under present circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lock Mills above mentioned are three or four stories high, with\r\nperhaps a hundred yards of front elevation, a grandly built series of\r\nstone buildings close to the Shannon, which is here about a hundred\r\nand twenty yards wide, and carries tolerably large steamers and\r\nlighters. Six months' occupancy for nothing, the old machinery a free\r\ngift, water power and buildings for sixty years at £30 a year. I have\r\npreviously mentioned the twelve big mills abandoned on the Boyne.\r\nTwelve openings for small capitalists--but Irishmen put their money in\r\nstockings, under the flure, in the thatch. _They_ will not trust\r\nIrishmen, although they have no objection to John Bull's doing so. A\r\nbank manager of this district said:--\r\n\r\n\"Poor Connaught, as they call the province, is a great hoarder. And\r\nwhen Irishmen invest they invest outside Ireland. Seventy-eight\r\nthousand pounds in the Post Office savings bank in Mayo, the most\r\npoverty-stricken district--as they will tell you. There is Connaught\r\nmoney in Australia, in America, in England, and in all kinds of\r\nforeign bonds. Irishmen want to keep their hoardings secret. They like\r\nto walk about barefoot and have money in their stocking. An old woman\r\nwho puts on and takes off her shoes outside the town has three sons\r\nhigh up in the Civil Service, and could lend you eight hundred pounds.\r\nYou would take her for a beggar and might offer her a penny, and she'd\r\ntake it. Have you noticed the appalling mendicancy of Ireland? Have\r\nyou reflected on the 'high spirit' of the Irish people? Have you\r\nremembered their pride, their repugnance to the Saxon? And have you\r\nnoticed the everlastingly outstretched hands which meet you at every\r\ncorner? Beggary, lying, dirt, and laziness invariably accompany\r\npriestly rule, and are never seen in Ireland in conjunction with\r\nProtestantism? I wish somebody would explain this. The Irish masses\r\nare the dirtiest and laziest in the world, but there are no dirty,\r\nlazy Protestants. Nobody ever heard of such a thing. And yet because\r\nthere are more dirty, lazy Catholics than clean, industrious\r\nProtestants Mr. Gladstone would give the Catholic party the mastery,\r\nand England in future would be ruled from Rome.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone is not responsible for his actions. The Civil Service\r\nwill not employ a man after sixty-five. The British Government forbids\r\na man to work in its service after that time. The consensus of\r\nscientific opinion has fixed sixty-five as the limit at which the\r\ncontrol of an office or the execution of routine office work should\r\ncease. Slips of memory occur, and the brain has lost its keen edge,\r\nits firm grip, its rapid grasp of detail. At sixty-five you are not\r\ngood enough for the Civil Service, but at eighty-four, when you are\r\nnineteen years older, you may govern a vast empire. It is an anomaly.\r\nEven the Nationalists think Mr. Gladstone past his work.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement was fully borne out by a strong anti-Parnellite of\r\nAthlone. He said:--\"The bill is a hoax, but it is better than nothing.\r\nWe'll take what we can get, an' we'll get what we can take--afterwards.\r\nYe wouldn't be surprised that the people's bitter about the bill. Sure,\r\n'tis no Home Rule it is at all, even if we got it as it first stood.\r\n'Tis an insult to offer such a bill to the Irish nation. We want\r\ncomplete independence. We have a sort of a yoke on us, an' we'll never\r\nrest till we get it off. Ye say 'This'll happen ye, and That'll happen\r\nye,' an' ye care the divil an' all about it. We don't care what\r\nhappens, once we get rid of that yoke. A friend of mine said yesterday,\r\n'I never see an Englishman but I think I'd like to have him under my\r\nfeet, an' meself stickin' somethin' into him.' There's murther in their\r\nhearts, an' ye can't wonder at it. An' owld Gladstone's a madman, no\r\nless. I'm towld he ordhers a dozen top hats at once, an' his wife gets\r\nthe shop-keeper to take thim back. An' I'm towld he stales the spoons\r\nwhin he goes out to dine wid his frinds, an' that his wife takes thim\r\nback in a little basket nixt mornin'. And I thought that was all\r\nnonsinse till I seen the bill. An' thin I felt I could believe it; for,\r\nbedad, nobody but a madman could have drawn up sich a measure, to\r\noffind everybody, an' plaze nobody. 'Tis what ye'd expect from a\r\nlunatic asylum. But, thin, 'tis Home Rule. 'Tis the principle; an' as\r\nthe mimber for Roscommon says, ''Tis ourselves will apply it, an' 'tis\r\nourselves will explain it. That's where we'll rape the advantage,' says\r\nhe.\"\r\n\r\nThe Athlone market is \"now on,\" and several hundred cows and calves\r\nare lowing in front of the Royal, Mrs. Haire's excellent caravanserai.\r\nSheep are bleating, and excited farmers are yelling like pandemonium\r\nor an Irish House of Commons. Athlone is a wonderful place for\r\ndonkeys, which swell the nine-fold harmony with incessant cacophonous\r\nbraying, so that the town might fairly claim the distinction of being\r\nthe chosen home, if not the _fons et origo_, of Nationalist oratory.\r\n\r\nAthlone, June 3rd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 31.--THE \"UNION OF HEARTS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce again the Atlantic stops me. The eighty-three miles of country\r\nbetween here and Athlone have brought about no great change in the\r\nappearance of the people, who, on the whole, are better clad than the\r\nGalway folks. The difference in customs, dress, language, manners, and\r\nlooks between one part of Ireland and another close by is sometimes\r\nvery considerable. There is a lack of homogeneity, a want of fusion,\r\nan obvious need of some mixing process. The people do not travel, and\r\nin the rural districts many of them live and die without journeying\r\nfive miles from home. The railways now projected or in process of\r\nconstruction will shortly change all this, and the tourist, with more\r\nconvenience, will no longer be able to see the Ireland of centuries\r\nago. The language is rapidly dying out. Not a word of Irish did I hear\r\nin Athlone, even on market day. The Westporters know nothing about it.\r\nThe tongue of the brutal Saxon is everywhere heard. The degenerate\r\nIrish of these latter days cannot speak their own language. They\r\npreach, teach, quarrel, pray, swear, mourn, sing, bargain, bless,\r\ncurse, make love in English. They are sufficiently familiar with the\r\nBritish vernacular to lie with the easy grace of a person speaking his\r\nmother-tongue. They are a gifted people, and a patriotic--at least\r\nthey tell us so, and the Irish, they say, is the queen of languages,\r\nthe softest, the sweetest, the most poetical, the most sonorous, the\r\nmost soul-satisfying. And yet the patriot members speak it not.\r\nWilliam O'Brien is said to know a little, but only as you know a\r\nforeign language. He could not address the people on the woes of\r\nIreland, could not lash the brutal Saxon, could not express in his\r\nnative tongue the withering outpourings of his patriotic soul. He\r\nalways speaks in English, of which he thinks foul scorn. He is the\r\nbest Gaelic scholar of the rout, and yet he could not give you the\r\nIrish for breeches.\r\n\r\nWestport is splendidly situated in a lovely valley watered by a\r\nnameless stream which empties itself into Clew Bay. A grand range of\r\nmountains rises around, the pyramidal form of Croagh Patrick\r\ndominating the quay. It was from the summit of this magnificent height\r\nthat Saint Patrick sent forth the command which banished from the\r\nGreen Isle the whole of the reptile tribe. \"The Wicklow Hills are very\r\nhigh, An' so's the hill of Howth, Sir; But there's a hill much higher\r\nstill, Aye, higher than them both, Sir! 'Twas from the top of this\r\nhigh hill Saint Patrick preached the sarmint, That drove the frogs out\r\nof the bogs An' bothered all the varmint. The toads went hop, the\r\nfrogs went flop, Slap-dash into the water, An' the snakes committed\r\nsuicide to save themselves from slaughter.\" Pity there is no modern\r\nsuccessor of Saint Patrick to extirpate the reptilia of the present\r\nday, the moonlighters and their Parliamentary supporters, to wit.\r\n\r\nThe Westport people are very pious. As I have previously shown by\r\nquotations from Irish authorities, Ireland has the true Christianity\r\nwhich England so sadly needs. Unhindered by England, Ireland would\r\nevangelise the world, and that in double-quick time. Every town I\r\nvisit is deeply engaged in religious exercises. In Limerick it was a\r\nTriduum with some reference to Saint Monica. In Cork it was something\r\nelse, which required much expenditure in blessed candles. In Galway\r\nthe Confraternity of the Holy Girdle was making full time, and in\r\nWestport three priests are laying on day and night in a mission. A few\r\ndays ago they carried the Corpus Christi round the place, six hundred\r\nchildren strewing flowers under the sacerdotal feet, and the crowds of\r\nworshippers who flocked into the town necessitated the use of a tent,\r\nfrom which the money-box was stolen. On Sunday last the bridge\r\nconvaynient to the chapel was covered with country folks who could not\r\nget into the building, and a big stall with sacred images in plaster\r\nof Paris and highly-coloured pictures in cheap frames was doing a\r\nroaring trade. Barefooted women were hurrying to chapel to get\r\npictures blessed, or walking leisurely home with the sanctified\r\ntreasure under their shawls. A brace of scoffers on the bridge\r\nexplained the surging crowd, and advised instant application, that\r\nevening being the last. \"Get inside, wid a candle in yer fist, an' ye\r\ncan pray till yer teeth dhrop out iv yer head.\" This irreverence is\r\nprobably one of the accursed fruits of contact with the sacrilegious\r\nSaxon. \"The people here are cowardly, knavish, and ignorant,\" said an\r\nIrishman twenty years resident in Westport. \"They believe anything the\r\npriests tell them, and they will do anything the priests may order or\r\neven hint at. They would consider it an honour if the priests told\r\nthem to lie down that they might walk over them. Politically they are\r\nentirely in the hands of the Roman Catholic clergy. They are totally\r\nunable to understand or to grasp the meaning of the change now\r\nproposed, which would place the country entirely at the mercy of the\r\nclerical party. We see the result of popular election in the return of\r\nPoor Law Guardians, who spend most of their time in calling each other\r\nbeggars and liars. Patronage under the Home Rule Bill would mean the\r\ninstalment of the relatives of priests in all the best offices. Once\r\nwe have an Irish Parliament, a man of capacity may leave the country\r\nunless he have a priest for his uncle.\r\n\r\n\"We want a liberal measure of Local Government, and a final settlement\r\nof the land question. The poor people are becoming poorer and poorer\r\nthrough this eternal agitation which drives away wealth and capital,\r\nand undermines the value of all Irish securities. Poor as we were, we\r\nwere much better off before the agitation commenced. The poor\r\nthemselves are becoming alive to the fact that continuous agitation\r\nmeans continuous poverty. We must now have some sort of Home Rule, but\r\nwe shall be ruined if we get it from a Liberal Government. If we get\r\nit from a Tory Government, the English will run to lend us money, but\r\nif from a Morley-Gladstone combination they won't advance us a stiver.\r\nThe present Irish Parliamentary representatives have the confidence\r\nof no single Irish party. They were well enough for their immediate\r\npurpose, and no better men would come forward. To entrust them with\r\nlarge powers is the very acme of wild insanity. Admitting their\r\nhonesty, which is doubtful, they have had no experience in business\r\naffairs, and their class is demonstratedly devoid of administrative\r\ncapacity. The Poor Law Guardians of Cork, Portumna, Ballinasloe,\r\nSwinford, Ballyvaughan, and many other towns and cities, have by their\r\nmismanagement brought their respective districts to insolvency. That\r\nevery case was a case of mismanagement is clearly proved by the fact\r\nthat the Government having superseded these Boards in each case by two\r\npaid Guardians, a period of two years has sufficed to wipe off all\r\ndebts, to reduce expenses, and to leave a balance in hand. They then\r\nbegin to drift again into insolvency. And where the guardians have not\r\nbeen superseded, where they have not yet become bankrupt, they still\r\nhave a bank balance against them. You will scarcely hear of a solvent\r\nparish, even if you offer a reward. And that is the class of persons\r\nMr. Gladstone would entrust with the administration of Irish finance.\r\nThe result would be the country's bankruptcy, and England would have\r\nto pay the damage. Serve England right for her stupidity.\"\r\n\r\nWhat my friend said anent the class of men who compose the ranks of\r\nthe Irish Parliamentary party reminds me of something I heard in\r\nAthlone. A great anti-Parnellite said:--\"Poor Mat Harris was the\r\nsplindid spaker, in throth! Parnell it was that sent him to the House\r\nof Commons. Many's the time I seen him on the roof of the Royal Hotel,\r\nfixin the tiles, an' puttin things sthraight, that the rain wouldn't\r\nrun in. 'Tis a slater he was, an' an iligant slater, at that. An' when\r\nhe came down for a big dhrink, the way he'd stand at the bar and\r\ndiscoorse about Ireland would brake yer heart. Many's the time I seen\r\nthe ould waiter listenin' to him till the wather would pour out iv his\r\ntwo good-lookin' eyes. An, thin, 'twas Mat Harris had the gab, rest\r\nhis sowl! Ye haven't anybody could come up to him barrin' owld\r\nGladstone, divil a one.\" Another Athloner, speaking of an Irish\r\nNationalist M.P., who luckily still lives, said:--\"Mr. Parnell took\r\nhim up because he was a wonderful fellow to talk, and so was popular\r\nwith the mob of these parts. I think he was a blacksmith by trade.\r\nParnell got him made M.P., and set him up with a blue pilot coat, but\r\nforgot to give him a handkerchief. So he used the tail of his coat\r\nalternately with his coat sleeve. He never had a pocket-handkerchief\r\nin his life, but he was a born legislator, and the people believed he\r\ncould do much to restore the vaunted ancient prestige and prosperity\r\nof Ireland. He came to Athlone, and went to the Royal, but the waiter,\r\nwho did not know he was speaking to a member of Parliament, and\r\nmoreover one of his own kidney, declined to take him in, and\r\nrecommended a place where he could get a bed for Thruppence! And the\r\nM.P. actually had to take it. This was only inconsistent with his new\r\ndignity, and not with his previous experiences. This is the kind of\r\nperson who is to direct Irish legislation more efficiently than the\r\neducated class, who unanimously object to Home Rule as detrimental to\r\nthe interests of both countries, and as likely to further impoverish\r\npoor Ireland. The men who now represent the 'patriotic' party will\r\nfeather their own nests. They care for nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nThe Westport folks may not deserve the strictures of their friend of\r\ntwenty years, but two things are plainly visible. They are dirty, and\r\nthey have no enterprise. The island-dotted Clew Bay and the sublime\r\npanorama of mountain scenery, the sylvan demesne of the Earl of Sligo,\r\nand the forest-bordered inlets of Westport Bay, form a scene of\r\nsurpassing loveliness and magnificence such as England and Wales\r\ntogether cannot show. The town is well laid out, the streets are broad\r\nand straight, and Lord Sligo's splendid range of lake and woodland,\r\nfree to all, adjoins the very centre. And yet the shops are small and\r\nmean, the houses are dirty and uninviting, and dunghills front the\r\ncottages first seen by the visitor. A breezy street leads upward to\r\nthe heights, and all along it are dustheaps, with cocks and hens\r\ngalore, scratching for buried treasure. At the top a stone railway\r\nbridge, the interstices facing the sea full of parsley fern, wild\r\nmaidenhair, hart's-tongue, and a beautiful species unknown to me. The\r\nbracing air of the Atlantic sweeps the town, which is sheltered withal\r\nby miles of well-grown woods. The houses are dazzling white, and like\r\nthe Rhine villages look well from a distance. Beware the interiors, or\r\nat least look before you leap. Then you will probably leap like the\r\nstricken hart, and in the opposite direction. You will be surprised at\r\nyour own agility. Flee from the \"Lodgings and Entertainment\" announced\r\nin the windows. Your \"Entertainment\" is likely to be livelier than you\r\nexpected, and you will wish that your Lodgings were on the cold, cold\r\nground. The Westporters are too pious to wash themselves or their\r\nhouses. \"They wash the middle of their faces once a month,\" said a\r\nBlack Methodist. For there are Methodists here, likewise Presbyterians\r\nand Plymouth Brethren--besides the Church of Ireland folks, who only\r\nare called Protestants. All these must be exempted from the charge of\r\ndirtiness. Cleanliness, neatness, prosperity, and Protestantism seem\r\nto go together. Father Humphreys himself would not deny this dictum.\r\n\r\nFor the other clause of the indictment--lack of enterprise--the\r\nWestporters are no worse and no better than their neighbours. The\r\nCorkers make nothing of their harbour, spending most of their time in\r\ntalking politics and cursing England. Commercial men speak of the\r\ndifficulty of doing business at Cork, which does not keep its\r\nappointments, is slippery, and requires much spirituous lubrication.\r\nCork ruins more young commercial men than any city in Britain, and\r\nowing to the unreliability of its citizens, is more difficult to work.\r\nGalway has scores of ruined warehouses and factories, and has been\r\ndiscussing the advisability of building a Town Hall for forty years\r\nat least. Limerick has a noble river, with an elaborate system of\r\nquays, on which no business is done. The estuary of the Shannon, some\r\nten miles wide, lies just below, opening on the Atlantic; and a little\r\nenterprise would make the city the Irish head-quarters for grain. The\r\nquays are peopled by loafers, barefooted gossiping women, and dirty,\r\nragged children playing at marbles. Great buildings erected to hold\r\nthe stores that never come, or to manufacture Irish productions which\r\nnobody makes, are falling into ruin. I saw the wild birds of the air\r\nflying through them, while the people were emigrating or complaining,\r\nand nothing seemed to flourish but religious services and\r\nfowl-stealing. It was during my sojourn in Limerick that somebody\r\ncomplained to the Town Council of poultry depredations, which\r\ncomplaint drew from that august body a counter-complaint to the effect\r\nthat the same complainant had complained before, and that he always\r\ndid it during a Retreat, that is, when the town was full of people\r\nengaged in special religious services--so that the heretic observer,\r\nand especially the representative of the _Gazette_, referred to by\r\nname, might couple the salvation of souls with the perdition of hens,\r\nto the great discredit of the faith. But this is a digression.\r\n\r\nWestport should brush itself up, cleanse its streets, tidy up its\r\nshops, sanitate its surroundings, and offer decent accommodation to\r\ntourists. The latter does exist, but is scarce and hard to find. The\r\npeople of Cork, Limerick, and Galway blame England and English rule\r\nfor the poverty which is their own fault alone. They hate the\r\nNortherners as idle unsuccessful men hate successful industrious men.\r\nBelfast is a standing reproach. The people of Leinster, Munster, and\r\nConnaught have had the same government under which Ulster has\r\nflourished, with incomparably greater advantages of soil and climate\r\nthan Ulster, with better harbours and a better trading position. But\r\ninstead of working they stand with folded hands complaining. Instead\r\nof putting their own shoulders to the wheel they wait for somebody to\r\nlift them out of the rut. Instead of modern methods of agriculture,\r\nfishing, or what not, they cling to the ancient ways, and resent\r\nadvice. The women will not take service; the men will not dig, chop,\r\nhammer. They are essentially bone-idle--laziness is in their blood.\r\nThey will not exert themselves. As Father McPhilpin says, \"They will\r\nnot move. You cannot stir them if you take them by the shoulders and\r\nhaul at them.\" What will Home Rule do for such people? Will it serve\r\nthem instead of work? Will it content the grumblers? Will it silence\r\nthe agitators? Will it convert the people to industry? Will it imbue\r\nthem with enterprise? Will it make them dig, chop, fish, hammer? Will\r\nit make the factory hands regular day by day? Will it cause the women\r\nto wash themselves and cleanse their houses? Will it change their\r\ningrained sluttishness to tidiness and neatness and decency? Father\r\nMahony, of Cork, said that the Irish fisherman turned his back on the\r\nteeming treasures of the deep, because he groaned beneath the cruel\r\nEnglish yoke. Since then I have seen him fishing, but I did not hear\r\nhim groan. He wanted boats, nets, and to be taught their use. Mr.\r\nBalfour supplied him with plant and instructions. Father Mahony and\r\nhis tribe of wind-bags feed the people on empty air. The starving poor\r\nask for bread, and they get a speech. They are told to go on\r\ngrumbling, and things will come all right. Nobody ever tells them to\r\nwork. Murder and robbery, outrage and spoliation, landlord-shooting\r\nand moonlighting, are easier ways of getting what they want. The Plan\r\nof Campaign, the No Rent combination, the Land League brotherhood when\r\nrightly considered, were just so many substitutes for honest work.\r\nIreland will be happy when Ireland is industrious, and not a moment\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nNo need to say that the Westporters are Home Rulers. The clean and\r\ntidy folks, the Protestant minority, are heart and soul against the\r\nbill, but the respectable voters are swamped all over Ireland, by\r\ndevotees of the priests. \"We think the franchise much too low,\" said a\r\nPresbyterian. \"We think illiterate Ireland, with its abject servility\r\nto the Catholic clergy, quite unfit to exercise the privilege of\r\nsending men to Parliament. We think the intelligent minority should\r\nrule, and that the principles which obtain in other matters might well\r\nbe applied to Parliamentary elections. These ignorant people are no\r\nmore fit to elect M.P.'s than to elect the President of the Royal\r\nSociety or the President of the Royal Academy. And yet if mere numbers\r\nmust decide, if the counting of heads is to make things right or\r\nwrong, why not let the people decide these distinctions? The West of\r\nIreland folks know quite as much of art or science as of Home Rule, or\r\nany other political question. They have returned, and will in future\r\nreturn, the nominees of the priests.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the highest legal authorities in Ireland, himself a Roman\r\nCatholic, said to me:--\r\n\r\n\"You saw the elections voided by reason of undue priestly influence.\r\nThat was because, in the cases so examined, money was available to pay\r\nthe costs of appeal. If there had been money enough to contest every\r\ncase where a Nationalist was returned, you would have seen every such\r\nelection proved equally illegal, and every one would have been\r\nadjudicated void.\"\r\n\r\nThe Westport folks are looking for great things from the great\r\nParliament in College Green. A Sligo man who has lived in Dublin was\r\nyesterday holding forth on these prospective benefits, his only\r\nauditor being one Michael, an ancient waiter of the finest Irish\r\nbrand. Michael is both pious and excitable, and must have an abnormal\r\nbump of wonder. He is a small man with a big head, and is very\r\ndemonstrative with his hands. He abounds with pious (and other)\r\nejaculations, and belongs to that popular class which is profuse in\r\nexpressions of surprise and admiration. The most commonplace\r\nobservation evokes a \"D'ye see that, now?\" a \"D'ye tell me so, thin?\"\r\nor a \"Whillaloo! but that bates all!\" As will be seen, Michael\r\nartistically suits his exclamations to the tone and matter of the\r\nprincipal narrator, mixing up Christianity and Paganism in a quaintly\r\ncomposite style, but always keeping in harmony with the subject. The\r\nSligo man said:--\r\n\r\n\"I seen the mails go on the boat at Kingstown, an' there was hundhreds\r\nof bags, no less.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavenly Fa-a-ther!\" said Michael, throwing up eyes and hands.\r\n\r\n\"Divil a lie in it. 'Twas six hundhred, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy Moses preserve us!\"\r\n\r\n\"An' the rivinue is millions an' millions o' pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"The saints in glory!\"\r\n\r\n\"An' wid Home Rule we'd have all that for Oireland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Julius Saysar an' Nibuchadnizzar!\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty millions o' goolden sovereigns, divil a less.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thunder an' ouns, but ye startle me!\"\r\n\r\n\"An' we're losin' all that\"--\r\n\r\n\"Save _an'_ deliver us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Becase the English takes it\"--\r\n\r\n\"Holy Virgin undefiled!\"\r\n\r\n\"To pay peelers an' sojers\"--\r\n\r\n\"Bloody end to thim!\"\r\n\r\n\"To murther and evict us\"--\r\n\r\n\"Lord help us!\"\r\n\r\n\"An' collect taxes an' rint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell's blazes!\"\r\n\r\nTen minutes after this conversation under my window Michael adroitly\r\nintroduced the subject of postal profits in Ireland. I told him there\r\nwas an ascertained loss of £50,000 a year, which the new Legislature\r\nwould have to make up somehow. Michael bore the change with fortitude.\r\nThe loss of forty millions plus fifty thousand would have upset many a\r\nman, but Michael only threw up his eyes and said very softly--\r\n\r\n\"Heavenly Fa-a-ther!\"\r\n\r\nWestport, June 6th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 32.--HOME RULE AND IRISH IMMIGRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bright country town with a big green square called The Mall,\r\nbordered by rows of great elm trees and brilliantly whitewashed\r\nhouses. The town is about a mile from the station, and the way is\r\npleasant enough. Plenty of trees and pleasant pastures with thriving\r\ncattle, mansions with umbrageous carriage-drives, and the immense mass\r\nof Croagh Patrick fifteen miles away towering over all. The famous\r\nmountain when seen from Castlebar, is as exactly triangular as an\r\nEgyptian pyramid, or the famous mound of Waterloo. Few British heights\r\nhave the striking outline of Croagh Patrick, which may be called the\r\nMatterhorn of Ireland. Castlebar is always dotted with soldiers, The\r\nBuffs are now marching through the town, on their way to the exercise\r\nground, but the sight is so familiar that the street urchins hardly\r\nturn their heads. The Protestant Church, square-towered, fills a\r\ncorner of The Mall, and there stands a statue of General O'Malley,\r\nwith a drawn sword of white marble. Lord Lucan, of the Balaklava\r\nCharge, hailed from Castlebar. The town and its precincts belong to\r\nthe Lucans. There is a convent with a big statue of the Virgin Mary,\r\nand the usual high wall. The shops are better than those of Westport,\r\nand the streets are far above the Irish average in order and\r\ncleanliness. The country around is rich in antiquities. Burrishoole\r\nAbbey and Aughnagower Tower, with the splendid Round Tower of\r\nTurlough, are within easy distance, the last a brisk hour's walk from\r\nCastlebar. There in the graveyard I met a Catholic priest of more than\r\naverage breadth and culture, who discussed Home Rule with apparent\r\nsincerity, and with a keener insight than is possessed by most of his\r\nprofession. He said:--\r\n\r\n\"When the last explosion took place at Dublin, the first to apprise me\r\nof the affair was the Bishop of my diocese, whose comment was summed\r\nup in the two words 'Castle job!' Now that riled me. I am tired of\r\nthat kind of criticism.\"\r\n\r\nHere I may interpolate the critique of Colonel Nolan, who was the\r\nfirst to apprise me of the occurrence.--\"I do not say that the Irish\r\nGovernment officials are responsible for the explosion. That would not\r\nbe fair, as there is no evidence against them. But I do say that if\r\nthey did arrange the blow-up they could not have selected a better\r\ntime, and if some mistaken Irish Nationalist be the guilty person he\r\ncould not have selected a worse time from a patriotic point of view.\"\r\nThus spake the Colonel, who has an excellent reputation in his own\r\ndistrict. The stoutest Conservatives of Tuam speak well of him. \"All\r\nthe Nolans are good,\" said a staunch Unionist; and another said, \"The\r\nNolans are a good breed. The Colonel is good, and Sebastian Nolan is\r\njust as good. Nobody can find fault with the Nolans apart from\r\npolitics.\" The Colonel is one of the nine Parnellites accursed of the\r\npriests. Perhaps he was present at the Parnellite meeting at Athenry,\r\nregarding which Canon Canton, parish priest of Athenry, declared from\r\nthe altar that every person attending it would be guilty of mortal\r\nsin. English readers will note that the Parnellites resent priestly\r\ndictation.\r\n\r\nAnother interpolation anent \"the Castle job.\" I thought to corner a\r\ngreat Athlone politician by questions _re_ the recent moonlighting,\r\nincendiarism, and attempted murders in Limerick and Clare. He said--\r\n\r\n\"All these things are concocted and paid for by the Tories of England.\r\nThe reason Balfour seemed to be so successful was simple enough when\r\nyou know the explanation. Balfour and his friends kept the\r\nmoonlighters and such like people going. They paid regular gangs of\r\nmarauders to disturb the country while the Liberals were in power.\r\nWhen the Tories get in, these same gangs are paid to be quiet. Then\r\nthe Tories go about saying, 'Look at the order we can keep.' Every\r\nshot fired in County Clare is paid for by the English Tories. Sure, I\r\nhave it from them that knows. Ye might talk for a month an' ye'd never\r\nchange my opinion. There's betther heads than mine to undershtand\r\nthese things, men that has the larnin', an' is the thrue frinds of\r\nIreland. When I hear them spake from the altar 'tis enough for me. I\r\nlave it to them. Ye couldn't turn me in politics or religion, an' I\r\nwouldn't listen to anybody but my insthructors since I was twelve\r\ninches high.\" Well might Colonel Winter, who knows the speaker\r\nabove-mentioned, say to me, \"He has read a good deal, but his reading\r\nseems to have done him no good.\"\r\n\r\nIt is time I went back to Turlough's Tower and my phoenix priest who\r\nwas riled to hear his Bishop speak of the Dublin explosion as a\r\n\"Castle job.\" He claimed that \"the clergy are unwilling instruments in\r\nthe hands of the Irish people, who are unconquerable even after seven\r\nhundred years of English rule. The Irish priesthood is so powerful an\r\nelement of Irish life, not because it leads, but because it follows.\r\nPowerful popular movements coerce the clergy, who are bound to join\r\nthe stream, or be for ever left behind. No doubt at all that, being\r\nonce in, they endeavour to direct the current of opinion in the course\r\nmost favourable to the Catholic religion. To do otherwise would be to\r\ndeny their profession, to be traitors to the Church. They did not\r\ncommence the agitation. The Church instinctively sticks to what is\r\nestablished, and opposes violent revolutionary action. History will\r\nbear me out. The clergy stamped out the Smith-O'Brien insurrection.\r\nThe Catholic clergy of the present day, mostly the sons of farmers,\r\nare perhaps more ardently political than the clergy of a former day, a\r\nlittle less broad in view, a little more hot-headed; yet in the main\r\nare subject to the invariable law I laid down at first--that is, they\r\nonly follow and direct, they do not lead, or at any rate they only\r\nplace themselves in the front when the safety of the Church demands\r\nit. The bulk of the clergy believe that the time to lead has now come.\r\nMy own opinion, in which I am supported by a very few,--but I am happy\r\nto say a very distinguished few,--is this: The Roman Catholic Church\r\nis making immense progress in England; a closer and closer connection\r\nwith England will ultimately do far more for the Church than can be\r\nhoped from revolutionary and republican Ireland. We should by a Home\r\nRule Bill gain much ground at first, but we should as rapidly lose it,\r\nwhile our hold on England would be altogether gone. Many of the\r\nso-called Catholic Nationalists are atheists at heart, and the\r\ntendency of modern education is decidedly materialistic. So that\r\ninstead of progressive conquest the Church would experience\r\nprogressive decline, which would be all the more striking after the\r\ngreat but momentary accession of prestige conferred by the Home Rule\r\nBill. My theory is--Let well alone. The popular idea is to achieve\r\ncommanding and lasting success at a blow.\"\r\n\r\nThe Castlebar folks have diverse opinions, the decent minority, the\r\nintelligence of the place, being Unionist, as in every other Irish\r\ntown. A steady, well-clad yeoman said:--\"I've looked at the thing in a\r\nhundred ways, and although I confess that I voted for Home Rule, yet\r\nwhen we have time to consider it, and to watch the debate on every\r\npoint, we may be excused if we become doubtful as to the good it will\r\ndo. The people round here are so ignorant, that talking sense to them\r\nis waste of time. They will put their trust in coal mines and the like\r\nof that. Now, I have gone into the subject of Irish mines. I have read\r\nthe subject up from beginning to end. Wicklow gold would cost us a\r\npound for ten shillings' worth. The silver mines wouldn't pay, and the\r\nlead mines are a fraud; while the copper mines would ruin anybody who\r\nput their money into them. I know something about Irish coal. Lord\r\nRanfurly did his best for Irish coal at Dungannon. Mines were sunk and\r\ncoal was found, but it was worthless. Well, it fetched half a crown a\r\nton, and people on the spot went on paying a guinea a ton for\r\nNewcastle coal because it was cheaper in the end. We may have iron,\r\nbut what's the good when we have no coal to smelt it? The Irish\r\nforests which formerly were used for this purpose are all gone. Then\r\nthe people put their trust in wool and cotton manufactures. They may\r\ndo something with the wool, because England is waking up to the\r\nsuperior quality of Irish woollen productions; but in the cotton\r\nEngland is here, there and everywhere before us. 'Oh,' say some who\r\nshould know better, 'put a duty on English goods, and make the Irish\r\nbuy their own productions.' What rubbish! when England buys almost\r\nevery yard of Irish woollen stuff, and could choke us off in a moment\r\nby counter-tariffs. Without English custom the Irish tweed mills would\r\nnot run a single day.\r\n\r\n\"As an Irishman, I should like to have a Parliament of my own. I\r\nsuppose that is a respectable ambition. At the same time, I cannot see\r\nwhere it would do us any substantial good. No, I do not think the\r\npresent Nationalist members loyal to the English Crown. Nor are they\r\ntraitors. A priest explained that very well. There's a distinction. 'A\r\nman may not be loyal and yet not be a traitor, for how can a man be a\r\ntraitor to a foreign government?' said he. That sounded like the\r\ntruth. I thought that a reasonable statement. For, after all, we _are_\r\nunder foreign rule, and we have a perfect right to revolt against it\r\nand throw off the English yoke if we could do it, and if it suited us\r\nto do it. How to do it has been the talk since my childhood, and many\r\na year before. It is the leading idea of all secret societies, and\r\nhardly any young man in Kerry and Clare but belongs to one or other of\r\nthem. The idea is to get rid of the landlords who hold the country for\r\nEngland. There it is, now. We'll never be a contented conquered\r\nprovince like Scotland. We'd be all right if we could only make\r\nourselves content. But the Divil is in us. That's what ye'll say. The\r\nDivil himself is in Irishmen.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mayo folks are great temporary migrants. From the County Mayo and\r\nits neighbour Roscommon come the bands of Irish harvesters which\r\nannually invade England. Latterly they are going more than ever, and\r\nthe women also are joining in large numbers. The unsettled state of\r\nthe country and the threat of a College Green Parliament have made\r\nwork scarcer and scarcer, and the prevailing belief among the better\r\nclasses that the bill is too absurd to become law, is not sufficient\r\nto counteract the chronic want of confidence inspired by the presence\r\nof Mr. Gladstone at the helm of state. Five hundred workers went from\r\nWestport Quay to Glasgow the other evening. More than two-thirds were\r\nwomen from Achil Island, sturdy and sun-burnt, quaintly dressed in\r\nshort red kirtle, brilliant striped shawl, and enormous lace-up boots,\r\nof fearful crushing power. Though not forbidding, the women were very\r\nplain, ethnologically of low type, with small turn-up noses, small\r\neyes, large jaws, and large flat cheekbones. The men were ugly as sin\r\nand coarse as young bulls, of which their movements were remindful. A\r\npiper struck up a jig and couples of men danced wildly about, the\r\nwomen looking on. Five shillings only for forty hours' sea-sickness,\r\nwith permission to stand about the deck all the time. Berths were, of\r\ncourse, out of the question, and the boat moved slowly into the\r\nAtlantic with hundreds of bareheaded women leaning over the sides.\r\nAnother boat-load will land at Liverpool, to return in September and\r\nOctober. The best-informed people of these parts think that under the\r\nproposed change the young female population of Mayo would be compelled\r\nto stay in England altogether, and that their competition in the\r\nEnglish labour market would materially lower the rate of factory wage.\r\n\"They live hard and work like slaves when away from Ireland,\" said an\r\nexperienced sergeant of the Royal Irish Constabulary. \"And yet they\r\nare lazy, for on their return they will live somehow on the money they\r\nbring back until the time comes to go again, and during the interval\r\nthey will hardly wash themselves. They will not work in their own\r\ndistricts, nor for their friends, the small farmers. Partly pride,\r\npartly laziness; you cannot understand them. The man who attempts to\r\nexplain the inconsistencies of the Irish character will have all his\r\nwork before him. Make the country a peasant-proprietary to suit the\r\nsmall farmers, and the labouring class will go to England and Scotland\r\nto live. The abolition of the big farmers will cut the ground from\r\nunder their feet. You will have Ireland bossing your elections, as in\r\nAmerica, and cutting the legs from under your artisans. For let me\r\ntell you that once Paddy learns mechanical work he is a heap smarter\r\nthan any Englishman.\"\r\n\r\nIf Home Rule should become law, and if England should be over-run by\r\nthe charming people of Connaught, the brutal Saxon will be interested\r\nto observe some of the ancient customs to which they cling with a\r\ntouching tenacity. Marriage with the Connaught folks is entirely a\r\nmatter of pecuniary bargain. The young folks have no act or part in\r\nthe arrangements. The seniors meet and form a committee of ways and\r\nmeans. How much money has your son? How much has your daughter? The\r\ndetails once understood, the parties agree or disagree, or leave the\r\nmatter pending while they respectively look about for a better\r\nbargain. And even if the bargain be ostensibly agreed to, either party\r\nis at liberty to at once break the match, on hearing of something\r\nbetter. The prospective bride and bridegroom have nothing to say in\r\nthe negotiations, and may never have seen each other in their lives.\r\nPrevious acquaintance is not considered necessary, and the high\r\ncontracting parties are frequently married without having met before\r\nthey meet at the altar. This was hard to believe, but careful inquiry\r\nestablished the fact. Never was a case of rebellion recorded. The lady\r\ntakes the goods the gods provide her, and the gentleman believes that\r\nthe custom yields all prizes and no blanks. Marriage is indeed a\r\nlottery in Connaught. The system works well, for unfaithfulness is\r\nsaid to be unknown. The Connaught funerals are impressive. One of\r\nthese I have seen, and one contents me well. The coffin arrived on a\r\ncountry cart, the wife and family of the deceased sitting on the body,\r\nafter the fashion attributed to English juries. To sit elsewhere than\r\non the coffin would in Connaught be considered a mark of disrespect.\r\nThe children sit on the head and feet, the wife jumps on the chest of\r\nthe dear departed, and away goes the donkey. The party dismount at the\r\nchurchyard gates, and as the coffin enters they raise the Irish cry, a\r\nblood-curdling wail that makes your muscles creep, while a cold chill\r\nruns down your spine, and you sternly make for home. You may as well\r\nsee it out, for you can hear the \"Keen\" two miles away against the\r\nwind. The mourners clasp their hands and move them quickly up and\r\ndown, recounting the deceased's good deeds, and exclaiming, in Irish\r\nand English, \"Why did ye die? Ah, thin, why did ye die?\" To which very\r\nreasonable query no satisfactory answer is obtainable. The widow is\r\nexpected to tear her hair, if any, and to be perfectly inconsolable\r\nuntil the churchyard wall is cleared on leaving. Then, and not before,\r\nshe may address herself to mundane things. Good \"Keeners\" are in much\r\nrequest, and a really efficient howler is sure of regular employment.\r\nThe Connaught folks are somewhat rough-and-ready with their dead.\r\nColonel Winter, of the Buffs, told me that he came across a\r\ndonkey-cart in charge of two men, who were waiting at a cross-road. A\r\ncoffin had been removed from the cart, and stood on its end hard by.\r\n\"I thought it was an empty coffin,\" said the Colonel, \"but it wasn't.\r\nThe men were waiting, by appointment, for the mourners, and meanwhile\r\nthe old lady in the coffin was standing on her head. Wonderful country\r\nis Ireland.\r\n\r\n\"An old woman died in the workhouse of typhus fever, or some other\r\ncontagious disorder. The corpse was placed in a parish coffin, and\r\nwas about to be buried, when a relative came forward and offered to\r\ntake charge of the funeral, declining to accept the workhouse coffin.\r\nThe authorities consented, on condition that the proposed coffin\r\nshould be large enough to enclose the first one, explaining that the\r\nbody was dangerously contagious. The relative, a stout farmer, duly\r\narrived at the workhouse with the new coffin, which was found to be\r\ntoo small to include the first one, and the authorities thereupon\r\nrefused to have the coffins changed. So the mourner knocked down two\r\nmen, and, making his way into the dead-room, burst open the receptacle\r\ncontaining his revered grandmother, whipped her out of the parochial\r\nbox, planked her into the family coffin, and triumphantly walked her\r\noff on his shoulder. There was filial piety for you! They arrested\r\nthat man, locked him up, and, for aught I know, left the old lady to\r\nbury herself, which must have been a great hardship. What Englishman\r\nwould have done as much for his grandmother? And yet they say that\r\nConnaught men have no enterprise!\"\r\n\r\nA Protestant of Castlebar said:--\"If the English people fail to\r\ncorrectly estimate the supreme importance of the present crisis it is\r\nall over with us, and, I think, with England. If the Unionist party\r\npersevere they must ultimately win. The facts are all with them.\r\nEnlightenment is spreading, and if time to spread the truth can be\r\ngained Home Rule will be as dead as a door-nail. If, on the other\r\nhand, the English people fail to see the true meaning of Home Rule,\r\nwhich is revolution and disintegration, England, from the moment an\r\nIrish Parliament is established, must be classed with those countries\r\nfrom which power has dwindled away; her glory will have commenced to\r\nwane, her enemies will rejoice, and she will present to the world the\r\naspect of a nation in its decadence. The Irish leaders and the Irish\r\npeople alike, who support Home Rule, are ninety-nine hundredths\r\ndisloyal. Already the leaders are cursing England more deeply than\r\nbefore, this time for deceiving them about the Home Rule Bill. Their\r\nmost respectable paper is already preparing the ground for further\r\nagitation. The _Irish Independent_ says that the Irish people are\r\nbeing marched from one prison to another, and told that is their\r\nliberty. Such is the latest criticism of the Home Rule Bill, as\r\npronounced by the Nationalist party. The same paper ordered the Lord\r\nMayor of Dublin and the City Council to refuse an address of\r\ncongratulation on the marriage of the Duke of York and Princess May,\r\nand they refused by more than four to one. They refused when it was\r\nthe Duke of Clarence. We could understand that, but why refuse now,\r\nwhen Home Rule is adopted as the principal measure of the Government\r\nwhose only aim is the Union of Hearts? The English people must indeed\r\nbe fools if they cannot gauge the feeling that dictated a vote so mean\r\nas this. Surely the English will at the eleventh hour draw back and\r\nsave us and our country, and themselves and their country from unknown\r\ndisaster. If they allow this ruinous measure to become law I shall\r\nalmost doubt the Bible where it says, 'Surely the net is set in vain\r\nin the sight of any bird.'\"\r\n\r\nI met a very savage Separatist in Castlebar. They are numerous in Mayo\r\nand Galway. The more uncivilised the district, the more ignorant the\r\npeople, the more decided the leaning to Home Rule. My friend was not\r\nof the peasant class, but rather of the small commercial traveller\r\nbreed, such as, with the clerks and counterskippers of the country\r\nstores, make up the membership of the Gaelic clubs by which the\r\nexpulsion of the Saxon is confidently expected. He said, \"I am for\r\ncomplete Independence, and I do not believe in what is called\r\nconstitutional agitation. Who would be free, themselves must strike\r\nthe blow. Every country that has its freedom has fought for it. I\r\nwould not waste a word with England, which has always deceived us and\r\nis about to deceive us once again. England has always wronged us,\r\nalways robbed us. England has used her vast resources to ruin our\r\ntrade that her own might flourish. The weakest must go to the\r\nwall--that is the doctrine of England--which thrives by our beggary\r\nand lives by our death. You have heaps of speakers in England who\r\nadmit this. Gladstone knows it is true. The Irish people have let the\r\nEnglish eat their bread for generations. The Irish people have seen\r\nthe English spending their money for centuries. This must be stopped\r\nas soon as possible, and Ireland grows stronger every day. Every\r\nconcession we have obtained has been the result of compulsion, and I\r\nam for armed combination. Every Irishman should be armed, and know the\r\nuse of arms. The day will come when we shall dictate to England, and\r\nwhen we may, if we choose, retaliate on her. We shall have an army and\r\nnavy of our own; all that will come with time. We must creep before we\r\nwalk, and walk before we run. The clubs already know their comrades;\r\neach man knows his right and left shoulder man, and the man whose\r\norders he is to obey. Merely a question of athletic sports, at\r\npresent. But when we get Home Rule the enthusiasm of the people will\r\nbe whetted to such an extent that we shall soon enroll the whole of\r\nthe able-bodied population, and after then, when we get the WORD, you\r\nwill see what will happen. Where would be your isolated handfuls of\r\nsoldiery and police, with roads torn up, bridges destroyed, and an\r\nentire population rising against them? Yes, you might put us down, but\r\nwe'd first have some fun. In a week we'd not leave a red coat in the\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\nThe gratitude, the warm generosity of the Irish people is very\r\nbeautiful. The Union of Hearts, however, as a paying investment seems\r\nto have fallen considerably below par.\r\n\r\nCastlebar, June 8th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 33.--TUAM'S INDIGNATION MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere I am, after two hours' journey by the Midland and Great Western\r\nRailway, which leads to most of the good things in Ireland, and is\r\nuncommonly well managed, and with much enterprise. By the Midland and\r\nGreat Western Railway you may cover the best tourist districts in\r\nquick time and with great comfort. By it you may tackle Connemara\r\neither from Galway or Westport, and the company, subsidised by Mr.\r\nBalfour, will shortly open fifty miles of line between Galway and\r\nClifden. Then we want a thirty-mile continuation from Clifden by\r\nLetterfrack and Leenane to Westport, and the circle will be complete.\r\nFor that, Paddy must wait until the Tories are again in office. As he\r\nwill tell you, the Liberals spend their strength in sympathetic talk.\r\nMr. Hastings, of Westport, said:--\"I care not who hears me say that\r\nthe Tories have instituted the public works which have so much\r\nbenefited the country. The Liberals have always been illiberal in this\r\nrespect. Mr. Balfour did Ireland more good than any Liberal Irish\r\nSecretary.\" Mr. Hastings is as good a Catholic Home Ruler as Father\r\nMcPhilpin, who said substantially the same thing. Ballina is on the\r\nMoy--every self-respecting town in Ireland has a salmon river--and the\r\nMidland and Great Western Railway gives fishing tickets to tourists,\r\nwho anywhere on this line should find themselves in Paradise. From the\r\nthree lakes of Mullingar to the Shannon at Athlone, from the Moy at\r\nBallina to the Corrib at Galway, the waters swarm with fish. The\r\nsalmon weir at Galway is worth a long journey to see. The fish\r\nliterally jostle each other in the water. They positively elbow each\r\nother about. Sometimes you may stand against the salmon ladder in the\r\nmiddle of the town, and although the water is clear as crystal you\r\ncannot see the bottom for fish--great, silvery salmon, upon whose\r\nbacks you think you might walk across the river. The Moy at Ballina is\r\nperhaps fifty yards wide, and the town boasts two fine bridges, one of\r\nwhich is flanked by a big Catholic church. The streets are not\r\nhandsome, nor yet mean. Whiskey shops abound, though they are not\r\nquite so numerous as in some parts of Ennis, where, in Mill Street,\r\nabout three-fourths of the shops sell liquor. Castleisland in Kerry\r\nwould also beat Ballina. Mr. Reid, of Aldershot, said:--\"The\r\npopulation of Castleisland is only one thousand two hundred, but I\r\ncounted forty-eight whiskey-shops on one side of the street.\" Of a row\r\nof eleven houses near the main bridge of Ballina I counted seven\r\nwhiskey-shops, and one of the remaining four was void. There were\r\nseveral drink-shops opposite, so that the people are adequately\r\nsupplied with the means of festivity. The place has no striking\r\nfeatures, and seems to vegetate in the way common to Irish country\r\ntowns. It probably lives on the markets, waking up once a week, and\r\nimmediately going to sleep again. The Post Office counter had two\r\nbottles of ink and no pen, and the young man in charge was whistling\r\n\"The Minstrel Boy.\" The shop-keepers were mostly standing at their\r\ndoors, congratulating each other on the fine weather. A long, long\r\nstreet leading uphill promised a view of the surrounding country, but\r\nthe result was not worth the trouble. It led in the direction of\r\nArdnaree, which my Irish scholarship translates \"King's Hill,\" but I\r\nstopped short at the ruins of the old workhouse, and after a glance\r\nover the domain of Captain Jones went back through the double row of\r\nfairly good cottages, and the numerous clans of cocks and hens which\r\nscratched for a precarious living on the King's highway. The people\r\nturned out _en masse_ to look at me, and to discuss my country, race,\r\nbusiness, appearance, and probable income. The Connaught folks have so\r\nlittle change, are so wedded to one dull round, that when I observe\r\nthe interest my passage evokes I feel like a public benefactor. A bell\r\nrings at the Catholic church. Three strokes and a pause. Then three\r\nmore and another pause. A lounger on the bridge reverently raises his\r\nhat, and seeing himself observed starts like a guilty wretch upon a\r\nfearful summons. I ask him what the ringing means, and with a\r\ndeprecatory wag of his head he says:--\r\n\r\n\"Deed an' deed thin, I couldn't tell ye.\"\r\n\r\nThe Town Crier unconsciously launched me into business, and soon I was\r\nfloating on a high tide of political declamation. What the crier cried\r\nI could not at all make out, for the accent of the Ballina folks is\r\nexceedingly full-flavoured. When he stopped I turned to a well-dressed\r\nyoung man near me and said, \"He does not finish, as in England, with\r\nGod save the Queen.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said my friend with a laugh, \"he has too much regard for his\r\nskin.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would happen if he expressed his loyalty?\"\r\n\r\n\"He would be instantly rolled in the gutter. The people would be on\r\nhim in a moment. He'd be like a daisy in a bull's mouth. He might say\r\n\"God save Ireland,\" just to round the thing off, but \"God save the\r\nQueen\"!\r\n\r\nMy friend was a Home Ruler, and yet unlike the rest. He said: \"I am a\r\nHome Ruler because I think Home Rule inevitable now the English people\r\nhave given way so far. Give Paddy an inch and you may trust him to\r\ntake an ell. We must have something like Home Rule to put an end to\r\nthe agitation which is destroying the country. It is now our only\r\nchance, and in my opinion a very poor chance, but we are reduced so\r\nlow that we think the bottom is touched. The various political\r\nagencies which have frightened away capital and entirely abolished\r\nenterprise will continue their work until some measure of Home Rule is\r\ngiven to the country, and then things will come to a head at once. It\r\nis barely possible that good might ultimately result, but young men\r\nwould be gray-headed before things would work smoothly. The posture of\r\nthe poorer classes is simply absurd. They will have a dreadful\r\nawakening, and that will also do good. They are doing nothing now\r\nexcept waiting for the wonderful things they have been told will take\r\nplace when Irishmen get into power. You must have heard the\r\nextraordinary things they say about the mines and factories that will\r\nbe everywhere opened. Some of their popular orators tell them of the\r\nprosperity of Ireland before the Union. That is true enough, but the\r\nconditions are totally changed. We did something in the way of\r\nmanufacturing, but we could not do it now. We had no Germany, no\r\nAmerica to compete against. Those who tell us to revive that period of\r\nprosperity by the same means might just as well tell us to revive the\r\nsystem of tribal lands or the chieftainship of Brian Boru.\r\n\r\n\"The people need some tremendous shock to bring them to their senses.\r\nThey used to work much better, to stand, as it were, on their own\r\nfeet. Now they make little or no exertion. They know they will never\r\nbe allowed to starve. They know that at the cry of their distress\r\nEngland and America will rush to their succour. And they have tasted\r\nthe delights of not paying. First it was the rent, the impossible\r\nrent. In this they had a world-wide sympathy, and a very large number\r\nof undeserving persons well able to pay chummed in with the deserving\r\npeople who were really unable to meet their engagements. And at the\r\nmeetings of farmers to decide on united action, the men who could pay\r\nbut would not were always the most resolute in their opposition to the\r\nlandlord. This was natural enough, for they had most to gain by\r\nwithholding payment. The landlords always knew which was which, and\r\nwould issue ejectment processes against those able to pay, but what\r\ncould be done against a whole county of No-rent folks? And never have\r\nthese people been without aid and sympathy from English politicians.\r\nWe have had them in Ireland by the dozen, going round the farmers and\r\nencouraging them to persevere.\r\n\r\n\"The great advantage of Home Rule in the eyes of the farmers is this\r\nand this only--that an Irish House would settle the land question for\r\never. The people would take a good bill from the House of Commons at\r\nWestminster if they could get it, but they can't. They believe that\r\ntheir only hope is with an Irish Parliament. The most intelligent are\r\nnow somewhat doubtful as to the substantial benefits to come. They\r\nfear heavy taxation. They say that everything must come out of the\r\nland, and they wonder whether the change would pay them after all. On\r\nthe whole, they will risk it, and under the advice of the clergy, who\r\nhave their own little ideas, they will continue to vote for Home Rule.\r\nThrow out this bill, let Mr. Balfour settle the land question, and the\r\nagitators will not have a leg left to stand on.\"\r\n\r\nAll this I steadfastly believe. No farmer wants Home Rule for anything\r\nbeyond his personal interests. Mr. Patrick Gibbons, of Carnalurgan, is\r\none of the smartest small farmers I have met, and he confirms the\r\nstatements of his fellows. \"Give the farmers the land for a reasonable\r\nrent,\" said he, \"and they would not care two straws for Home Rule.\"\r\nThe small traders admit that they would like it, as a mere matter of\r\nfancy, and because they have been from time to time assured that the\r\nEnglish Parliament is the sole cause of Ireland's decadence. They are\r\nassured that an Irish Parliament by instituting immense public works\r\nwould prevent emigration, and that the people staying at home and\r\nearning money would bring custom to their shops. Nearly everybody\r\ninsists on an exclusive system of protective tariffs. England, they\r\nsay, competes too strongly. Ireland cannot stand up to her. She must\r\nbe kept out at any cost.\r\n\r\nAccording to a Ballina Nationalist this is where the \"shock\" will come\r\nin. He said:--\r\n\r\n\"The bill is being whittled down to nothing. Gladstone is betraying\r\nus. It is doubtful if he ever was in earnest. 'Twould be no Home Rule\r\nBill at all, if even it was passed. An' what d'ye mane by refusing us\r\nthe right to put on whatever harbour dues we choose? An' what d'ye\r\nmane by sayin' we're not to impose protective tariffs to help Irish\r\nindustries? Ye wish to say, 'Here's yer Parlimint. Ye're responsible\r\nfor the government of the counthry, for the advancement of the\r\ncounthry, for the prosperity of the counthry; but ye mustn't do what\r\nye think best to bring about all this. When we have a Parlimint we'll\r\ndo as _we_ choose, an' not as _you_ choose, Ye have no right to\r\ndictate what we shall do, nor what we shan't do. We'll do what we\r\nthink proper, an' England must make the best of it. England has always\r\nconsidered herself: now we'll consider ourselves. If we're not to\r\ngovern the counthry in every way that _we_ think best, why on earth\r\nwould we want a Parlimint at all? Tell me that, now. If Ireland is to\r\nbe governed from England, if we are to have any interference, what\r\nbetther off will we be? An' Protection is the very first cry we shall\r\nraise.\"\r\n\r\nThe good folks at Tuam have held an indignation meeting to protest\r\nagainst the statements contained in my Tuam letter, which they\r\ncharacterise as \"vile slanders\" which they wish to \"hurl back in my\r\nteeth\" (if any). The meeting took place in the Town Hall on Sunday,\r\nwhich day is usually selected by the Tuamites to protest against the\r\nbrutal Saxon, and to hold meetings of the National League, a\r\ncolourable successor to the Land League. All these meetings are\r\nconvened by priests, addressed by priests, governed by priests. The\r\nTuamites are among the most priest-ridden people in Ireland, and,\r\nafter having seen Galway and Limerick, this is saying a good deal. The\r\nmeeting was from beginning to end a screaming farce, wherein language\r\nwas used fit only for an Irish House of Commons. The vocabulary of\r\nIrish Town Commissioners and Irish Poor Law Guardians was laid under\r\nheavy contribution. The speakers hurled at the _Gazette_ the pet terms\r\nthey usually and properly reserve for each other. The too flattering\r\nterms which in a moment of weakness I applied to Tuam and its people\r\nare described as \"lying, hellish, mendacious misrepresentations.\"\r\nMisther MacCormack said the English people would know there was \"not\r\na wurrud of thruth in these miserable lies.\" The report of the _Tuam\r\nHerald_ reads like a faction fight in a whiskey-shop. You can hear the\r\ntrailing of coats, the crack of shillelaghs on thick Irish skulls, the\r\nyells of hurroosh, whirroo, and O'Donnell aboo! Towards the end your\r\nhigh-wrought imagination can almost smell the sticking plaister, so\r\nvivid is the picture. \"The bare-faced slanders of this hireling scribe\r\nfrom the slums of Birmingham\" were hotly denounced, but nobody said\r\nwhat they were. The clergy and their serfs were equally silent on this\r\npoint. I steadfastly adhere to every syllable of my Tuam letter. I\r\nchallenge the clergy and laity combined to put their fingers on a\r\nsingle assertion which is untrue, or even overstated. Let them point\r\nout a single inaccuracy, if they can. To make sweeping statements, to\r\nsay that this \"gutter-snipe,\" this \"hireling calumniator,\" this\r\n\"blackguard Birmingham man\" has made a series of \"reckless calumnies,\"\r\n\"devoid of one particle of truth,\" is not sufficiently precise. I\r\nstand by every word I have uttered; I am prepared to hold my ground on\r\nevery single point. Most of my information was obtained from Catholics\r\nwho are heart-weary of priestly tyranny and priestly intimidation; who\r\nare sufficiently enlightened to see that priestly power is based on\r\nthe ignorance of priestly dupes, that priestly influence is the real\r\nslavery of Ireland, the abject condition of the poor is its\r\nunmistakable result, and that where there are priests in Ireland there\r\nare ignorance and dirt in exact proportion. They have compared the\r\nclean cottages of the North with the filthy hovels of the South, and\r\nthey have drawn their own conclusions. But to descend to detail. What\r\ndo the Tuamites deny? \"Not a particle of truth in the whole letter!\"\r\nFather Humphreys said my Tipperary letter was \"a pure invention,\"\r\nwithout a syllable of truth. Since then Father Humphreys has been\r\ncompelled to admit, in writing, that all I said was true, and that he\r\n\"could not have believed it possible.\" That was his apology.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Tuam letter, I find these words--\r\n\r\n\"The educated Catholics are excellent people--none better anywhere,\r\nnone more tolerant.\" This is construed into \"a gross insult on our\r\nholy priests, and particularly on our Archbishop,\" who, by the way,\r\nwas not mentioned or made the subject of any allusion, however remote.\r\nDo the Tuamites deny that \"many of the streets are wretchedly built,\"\r\nand \"the Galway road shows how easily the Catholic poor are\r\nsatisfied?\" Do they deny that the cabins in this district are\r\n\"aboriginal in build, and also indescribably filthy,\" and that \"the\r\ncondition of the inmates is not one whit higher than that obtaining in\r\nthe wigwams of the native Americans?\" Do they deny that \"the hooded\r\nwomen, barefooted, bronzed, and tanned by constant exposure, are\r\nwonderfully like the squaws brought from the Far West by Buffalo\r\nBill?\"\r\n\r\nAll this I reiterate and firmly maintain, with the addition of the\r\nstatement that the squaws were in a condition of compulsory\r\ncleanliness the like of which seems never to be attained by the ladies\r\nof the Galway Road, Tuam. The meeting is called a \"monster\" meeting.\r\nHow many people does the Tuam Town Hall hold? The fact is that the\r\nTown Hall of Tuam, with the entire population of Tuam thrown in, could\r\nbe put into the Town Hall of Birmingham. Do the Tuamites deny that Mr.\r\nStrachan, one of their most worthy citizens, is unable to walk the\r\nstreets of the town wherein live the people he has benefited, without\r\na guard of policemen to protect him from the cut-throat emissaries of\r\nthe Land League? So it was when I visited Tuam, Mr. Strachan's crimes\r\nbeing the purchase of a farm in the Land Court and his Protestant\r\ncreed. Do they deny the scenes of persecution I described as having\r\ntaken place in former days? All this I had from a source more reliable\r\nthan the whole Papist hierarchy. The Tuamites can deny nothing of what\r\nI have written. The tumbledown town is there, the filthy cabins and\r\ndegraded squaws of the Galway Road are still festering in their own\r\nputridity, and probably the police are still preserving Strachan from\r\nthe fate of the poor fellow so brutally murdered near Tuam a few weeks\r\nago. The priests called a town meeting to protest against insult to\r\nthe Church. Great is Diana of the Ephesians! When the tenants refused\r\nto pay their lawful dues the priests called no meeting. When the\r\ncountry from end to end echoed with the lamentations of widows and the\r\nwailing of helpless children whose natural protectors had been\r\nmurdered by the Land League, the Tuamites suppressed their\r\nindignation, the Tuam priests made no protest. When scores of men were\r\nbutchered at their own firesides, shot in their beds, battered to\r\npieces at their own thresholds, these virtuous sacerdotalists never\r\nsaid a word, called no town's meeting, used no bad language, spoke not\r\nof \"hirelings,\" \"calumniators,\" \"blackguards,\" and \"liars.\" Two of the\r\nspeakers threatened personal injury should I again visit the town.\r\nThat is their usual form,--kicking, bludgeoning, outraging, or\r\nshooting from behind a wall. When they do not shoot they come on in\r\nherds, like wild buffaloes, to trample on and mutilate their victim.\r\nFrom the strong or armed they run like hares. Their fleetness of foot\r\nis astonishing. The _Tuam News_, owned and edited by the brother of a\r\npriest, exhibits the intellectual status of the Tuam people. Let us\r\nquote it once again:--\r\n\r\n               TO THE EDITOR OF THE \"TUAM NEWS.\"\r\n\r\n  Sir--Permit me a little space in the next issue of the _Tuam\r\n  News_, relative to my father being killed by the fairies which\r\n  appeared in the _Tuam News_ of the 8th of April last. I beg to say\r\n  that he was not killed by the fairies, but I say he was killed by\r\n  some person or persons unknown as yet. Hoping very soon that the\r\n  perpetrators of this dastardly outrage will be soon brought to\r\n  light, I am, Mr. Editor, yours obediently,\r\n\r\n                                            DAVID REDINGTON.\r\n  Kilcreevanty, May 8th, '93.\r\n\r\nAfter this I need add nothing to what I have said except a\r\npronouncement of Father Curran, who said that \"Tuam could boast as\r\nfine schools as Birmingham, and that he would then and there throw\r\nout a challenge that they boast more intelligence in Tuam than\r\nBirmingham could afford.\" Poor Father Curran! Poor Tuam! Poor Tuamites\r\nwith their rags, pigs, filth, priests, fairies, and Intelligence! I\r\nshall visit them once more. A few photographs from the Galway Road\r\nwould settle the dispute, and render null and void all future Town's\r\nmeetings. They have sworn to slay me, but in visiting their town I\r\nfear nothing but vermin and typhoid fever. Their threats affect me\r\nnot. As one of their own townsmen remarked,--\r\n\r\n\"You cannot believe a word they say. They never speak the truth except\r\nwhen they call each other liars. And when they are in fear, although\r\ntoo lazy to work, they are never too lazy to run. They have no\r\nindependence of thought or action. Their religion crushes all manhood\r\nout of them. They are the obedient servants of the priests, and no man\r\ndare say his soul's his own. Any one who did not attend that meeting\r\nwould be a marked man, but if it had been limited to people who know\r\nthe use of soap it would necessarily have been small, even for the\r\nTuam Town Hall.\"\r\n\r\nEverywhere in Connaught I hear the people saying, \"When you want to\r\nroast an Irishman you can always find another Irishman to turn the\r\nspit.\"\r\n\r\nThrue for ye, ma bouchal!\r\n\r\nBallina, June 10th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 34.--WHY IRELAND DOES NOT PROSPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nA community of small farmers with a sprinkling of resident gentry. All\r\nsorts of land within a small compass, rock, bog, tillage, and\r\nexcellent grazing. The churchyard is a striking feature. A ruined\r\noratory covered with ivy is surrounded by tombstones and other\r\nmortuary memorials strange to the Saxon eye. The graves are dug east\r\nand west on a rugged mound hardly deserving to be called a hill,\r\nalthough here and there steep enough. Huge masses of sterile mountain\r\nform the background, and from the ruin the Atlantic is seen, gleaming\r\nin the sun. Patches of bog with diggers of turf, are close by the\r\nuntouched portions covered with white bog-bean blooms, which at a\r\nshort distance look like a snowfall. On a neighbouring hill is a fine\r\nold Danish earthwork, a fort, called by the natives \"The Rath,\" fifty\r\nyards in diameter, the grassy walls, some ten feet high and four yards\r\nthick, reared in a perfect circle, on which grow gorse and brambles.\r\nThe graveyard is sadly neglected. Costly Irish crosses with elaborate\r\ncarving stand in a wilderness of nettles and long grass. Not a\r\nsemblance of a path anywhere. To walk about is positively dangerous.\r\nRuined tombstones, and broken slabs which appear to cover family\r\nvaults, trip you up at every step. Every yard of progress is made with\r\ndifficulty, and you move nervously among the tall rank nettles in\r\nmomentary fear of dislocating your ankle, or of being suddenly\r\nprecipitated into the reeking charnel house of some defunct Mayo\r\nfamily. The Connaught dead seem to be very exclusive. Most of the\r\nground is enclosed in small squares, each having a low stone wall,\r\nhalf-a-yard thick, with what looks like the gable-end of a stone\r\ncottage at the west end. Seen from a distance the churchyard looks\r\nlike a ruined village. At first sight you think the place a relic of\r\nsome former age, tenanted by the long-forgotten dead, but a closer\r\ninspection proves interments almost up to date. Weird memorials of the\r\nolden time stand cheek by jowl with modern monuments of marble; and\r\ntwo of suspiciously Black Country physiognomy are of cast-iron, with\r\nI.H.S. and a crucifix all correctly moulded, the outlines painted\r\nvermilion, with an invitation to pray for the souls of the dead in the\r\nsame effective colour. The graveyard shows no end of prayer, but\r\nabsolutely no work. No tidiness, order, reverence, decency, or\r\nconvenience. Nothing but ruin, neglect, disorder, untidiness,\r\nirreverence, and inconvenience. _Ora et labora_ is an excellent\r\nproverb which the Irish people have not yet mastered in its entirety.\r\nTo pray _and_ work is as yet a little too much for them. They stop at\r\nthe first word, look round, and think they have done all. This\r\ngraveyard displays the national character. Heaps of piety, but no\r\nexertion. Any amount of talk, but no work. More than any people, the\r\nIrish affect respect for their dead. You leave the graveyard of\r\nOughewall smarting with nettle stings, and thankful that you have not\r\nbroken your neck. The place will doubtless be tidied, the nettles\r\nmowed down and pathways made, when the people get Home Rule. They are\r\nclearly waiting for something. They wish to be freed from the cruel\r\nEnglish yoke. When this operation is happily effected, they will clean\r\ntheir houses, move the dunghills from their doors, wash themselves,\r\nand go to work in earnest. The Spanish Queen vowed she would never\r\nwash herself till Gibraltar was retaken from the English. Seven\r\nhundred years ago the Irish nation must have made a similar vow--and\r\nkept it.\r\n\r\nA passing shower drove me to the shelter of a neighbouring farmhouse,\r\nwhere lived a farmer, his wife, and their son and daughter. The place\r\nwas poor but tolerable, the wife being far above the Irish average. The\r\nliving room, about ten feet square, was paved with irregularly-shaped\r\nstones of all sizes, not particularly flat, but in places decidedly\r\nhumpy; the interstices were of earth, the whole swept fairly clean, but\r\ncertainly not scrubbed. The rafters, of rough wood, were painted black,\r\nand a rough ladder-like stair, open at the sides, led to the upper\r\nregions. To have an upstairs is to be an aristocrat. The standard of\r\nluxury is much lower than in England, for almost any English\r\nagricultural labourer would have better furniture than that possessed\r\nby this well-to-do but discontented farmer. An oak cupboard like a\r\nwardrobe, a round deal table, and four rough rush-bottomed chairs of\r\nunstained wood comprised the paraphernalia. The kitchen dresser, that\r\nindispensable requisite of English farm kitchens, with its rows of\r\nplates and dishes, was nowhere to be seen. The turf fire on the hearth\r\nneeded no stove nor grate, nor was there any in the house. A second\r\nroom on the ground floor, used as a bed room, had a boarded floor, and\r\nalthough to English notions bare and bald, having no carpet, pictures,\r\ndressing table, or washstand, it was clean and inoffensive. The\r\nchurning and dairy operations are carried on in the room first\r\ndescribed, where also the ducks and hens do feed. The farmer holds\r\nfifty acres of good land, for which he pays fifty pounds a year. His\r\nfather, who died thirty years ago, paid twenty-four pounds, which he\r\nthinks a fair rent to-day. Has not made application to the Court,\r\nalthough he _might_ benefit by twenty-five to thirty-five per cent. Is\r\naware that the Judicial Rent is sometimes fixed at a sum above what the\r\ntenant had been paying, and admits that this might happen to him. \"Yes,\r\nthe land round the house is very good, very good indeed, but what can\r\nbe seen from here is by far the best of it. That is always the way in\r\nthis world, the best at the front.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this and other remarks of like tendency I gather that the noble\r\nlandlord is in the habit of placing all the best land of his estate\r\nalong the high read, concealing the boggy, rocky portions in the\r\nremote interior, fraudulently imposing on the public, and alienating\r\nsympathy from the tenant, thereby inflicting another injustice on\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n\"The English laws are right enough, as far as they go,\" said the\r\nfarmer, \"but the English will not do the right thing about the land.\r\nNow we know that an Irish Parliament will settle the matter\r\nforth-with. That's why we support Home Rule. We know the opinions of\r\nthe men who now represent us, and we can trust them in this matter if\r\nin no other. The land is the whole of it. If that were once put on an\r\nunchangeable bottom I would rather be without Home Rule. Some say that\r\neven if our rents are reduced by one-half, the increased taxes we must\r\npay would make us nearly as poor as ever, and that all this bother and\r\ndisturbance would not really save us a penny piece. And I think this\r\nmight be true. So that if something could be done by the English\r\nParliament I should prefer it to come that way. And so would we all, a\r\nhundred times. For with the English Parliament we know where we are,\r\nand what we're doing. I'm not one to believe that the land will be\r\nhanded over to us without payment. Plenty of them are ignorant enough\r\nto believe even that. My view is just this: If the English Parliament\r\nwould settle the land question, I would prefer to do without an Irish\r\nParliament. That's what all the best farmers say, and nothing else.\r\nNo, I wouldn't invest money in Ireland. No, I wouldn't trust the bulk\r\nof the present members for Ireland. Yes, I would prefer a more\r\nrespectable class of men who had a stake in the country. But we had to\r\ntake what we could catch, for people who have a stake in the country\r\nare all against Home Rule. What could we do? We had no choice. We sent\r\nHome Rulers because an Irish Parliament is pledged to meet our views\r\nabout the land. We know they will fulfil their pledges, not because\r\nthey have promised, nor because they wish to benefit us, but because\r\nthey wish to abolish landlordism and landlords from the country. The\r\nlandlord interest is English interest, and that they want to get rid\r\nof. Their reasons for settling the land question are not the farmers'\r\nreasons, but so long as it _is_ settled the farmer will reap the\r\nbenefit, and will not care _why_ it was settled. Give us compulsory\r\nsale and compulsory purchase, at a fair price, and you will find the\r\nfarmers nearly all voting against Home Rule. No, the priests would not\r\nbe able to stir us once we were comfortably settled. Why, we'd all\r\nbecome Conservatives at once. Sure anybody with half-an-eye could see\r\nthat in a pitch-dark night in a bog-hole.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend assured me that secret societies are unknown in Mayo, or at\r\nany rate, in the Westport district. The young men of Clare, he\r\nthought, were Fenians to a man. \"They are queer, blood-thirsty folks,\r\nenemies to Ireland. Why, they object to other Irishmen. They will not\r\nallow a poor fellow from another county to work among them as a\r\nharvest-man. They would warn him off, and if he would not go, they'd\r\nbeat him with sticks, and when once they begin, you never know where\r\nthey'll stop. They should be put down with a strong hand.\"\r\n\r\nBut where is the strong hand? Mr. Morley, recently replying to Mr.\r\nArnold Forster, said that \"it was admitted that the police were\r\nworking as faithfully and as energetically under the present as under\r\nthe late Government, and added that the authorities concerned were\r\ntaking all the steps which experience and responsibility suggested.\"\r\nMr. Morley is right in attributing faithfulness to the police, and\r\ntheir energy is doubtless all that can be reasonably expected under\r\nvery discouraging auspices. Mr. Morley speaks more highly of the\r\npolice than the police speak of Mr. Morley. From Donegal to Bantry\r\nBay, from Dublin to Galway and Westport, north, south, east, west,\r\nright, left, and centre, the police of Ireland condemn Mr. Morley's\r\nadministration as feeble, vacillating, and as likely to encourage\r\ncrime. They speak of their duties in despondent tones. I have from\r\ntime to time given their sentiments, which are unvarying. They know\r\nnot what to do, and complain that while they continue to be held\r\nresponsible they dare not follow up their duties with the requisite\r\nenergy. Only yesterday an experienced officer said:--\"The men are\r\ndisheartened because they do not know how their action will be taken,\r\nand because they feel that anything in the nature of enterprise is\r\nvery likely to injure themselves individually. They feel that in the\r\nmatter of arrests it is better to be on the safe side, and then they\r\nknow how unavailing all their efforts must be in the disturbed\r\ndistricts of Kerry, Clare, and Limerick, where the arm of the law has\r\nbeen paralysed by Mr. Morley's rescision of the salutary provisions so\r\nnecessary in those counties. Outrages and shooting are every-day\r\noccurrences, for many cases are never reported to the police at all.\r\nIf the police caught the criminals in the act there would be no\r\nresult, for the juries of those three counties would not convict, and\r\nthe venue cannot now be changed to Cork.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the Nationalist members were the other day asking in the\r\nHouse whether the Cork magistrates had not been presented with white\r\ngloves, and so on, to bring out the fact that there was no crime to\r\npunish on a recent occasion; but what does this prove? Merely that Mr.\r\nBalfour's action in changing the venue of three counties to the city\r\nof Cork, where moonlighters are tried by a jury of independent traders\r\nof Patrick Street was wise and sagacious. The white gloves of Cork\r\nwere a tribute to Tory administration. The Cork juries convicted their\r\nmen, and stood by the consequences. They have escaped so far, as all\r\nbold men escape. If the Limerick moonlighters must have been tried in\r\nCork there would have been no moonlighting. The police can always\r\ncatch them, when there is any use in catching them. In country\r\ndistricts the movements of people are pretty well known, and these\r\nfellows are always ready to betray each other. Mr. Morley may talk\r\nfine, and may mean well, but the people who have been riddled with\r\nshot have Mr. Morley to thank. Of course he is under compulsion. He\r\nhas to please the Irish Separatists. Old women and children are\r\noutraged and shot in the legs because of Mr. Morley's political\r\nnecessities.\"\r\n\r\nI think my friend was right as to the effect of boldness in action.\r\nThere is too much truckling to the ruffian element, not only by Mr.\r\nMorley, but by most Unionists resident in Ireland. Opinions on this\r\npoint vary with varying circumstances. Several shopkeepers in a Mayo\r\ntown were utterly ruined for expressing their political opinions, or\r\nfor being suspected of harbouring opinions contrary to the feeling of\r\nthe majority. They were boycotted, and had to shut up shop. Others,\r\nolder-established, or in possession of a monopoly, weathered the\r\nstorm, but their opinions cost them something. These are the milder\r\ncases. Yet shooting or bludgeoning are likely enough to follow overt\r\npolitical action, such as refusing to join a procession or to\r\nilluminate.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to find a Protestant farmer in this district, but I\r\nsucceeded at last. His notions were strange, very strange indeed. He\r\nthought his rent fair enough, and was of opinion that the tenant must\r\nbe prepared to take the good years with the bad years. \"These\r\ncountrymen of mine, like somebody I've read of, never learn anything\r\nand never forget anything. They do not half farm the land. They don't\r\nunderstand any but the most elementary methods. They do not put the\r\nland to its best use. When they had prosperous years, and many a one\r\nthey had, they put nothing by for a rainy day. They are very\r\nimprovident. I have been in both England and Scotland, and I know the\r\ndifference in the people. They have more self-reliance, and they are\r\nkeen after improvements. They are not satisfied to have just enough,\r\nto live from hand to mouth. They must have comfort, and they like to\r\nbe independent. Now, Paddy is content to just scrape along. If he can\r\nbarely exist he's quite satisfied. He's always on the edge of the\r\nnest, but he feels sure that when the worst comes to the worst,\r\nsomebody or something will step in and save him from starvation.\r\n\r\n\"Nearly every man in this county has been in England, many of them\r\ntwenty times or more, working for months and months in the best farmed\r\ndistricts. Have they got any wrinkles? Divil a one. They have not\r\nplanted a gooseberry or currant tree, they have no pot-herbs, no\r\ncarrots or parsnips--nothing at all but potatoes and turnips. The\r\nfarmers have no system of winter feeding, and they won't learn one.\r\nThere is a great and growing demand in England for Irish butter,\r\nwhich, properly put up in a tasty way, would fetch fine figures, but\r\nthe lack of system in winter feeding and winter calving prevents the\r\nsupply from being kept up. The farmers will make no change in their\r\nhabits, and they don't work as if they meant it. They lounge about all\r\nday, waiting for the crops to grow and the cattle to get fat, and then\r\nthey wonder they are so poor. The only hope of the Irish people is\r\ntheir absorption in America. They work well enough when surrounded by\r\nnew influences. Once get them away from the priests, and away they go;\r\nyou can't stop them. They have great natural abilities, but somehow\r\nthey won't bloom in Ireland. If they put forth the same energy in\r\nIreland as in America they would do well. But they never will. Their\r\nreligion keeps them down, and they can't get out of their old habits.\"\r\n\r\nI observed that the Earl of Sligo had obtained eighty-two decrees of\r\npossession against tenants for non-payment of rent, and that the _Mayo\r\nNews_, while censuring his action, admitted that most of the tenants\r\nowed two years' rent at least. My Black Protestant friend might tell\r\nme whether the heading \"Another Batch of Death Sentences\" was a fair\r\ndescription of this legal action, and whether the tenants were, in his\r\nopinion, totally unable to pay the rent.\r\n\r\n\"To call them sentences of death is absurd, The people are not evicted\r\nand left homeless, but merely deprived of their rights as tenants. In\r\nEngland, if a man does not pay his rent, he is thrown out, and nobody\r\nsays Nay. In Ireland a man may pay no rent for seven years, and yet,\r\nwhen he is evicted, the people cry Shame on the landlord, who, in most\r\ncases, has been patient to the limit of human endurance. The landlord\r\nhas watched the tenant neglecting the land, and living more\r\nexpensively on the money he ought to have paid as rent. Now, let me\r\nsubmit a point which never seems to strike the English Unionist\r\nspeakers. And yet it is plain enough. The Separatists say evictions\r\nare cruel and tyrannical because the people cannot pay the awful,\r\nexorbitant rents. Now notice my point!\r\n\r\n\"A rent may be too high, but the land must be worth _something_. Now\r\nthese people have paid _nothing at all for two years or more_.\r\n\r\n\"Talk to these defaulters, and they will usually say 'The land is\r\nworth just one-half.'\r\n\r\n\"Why don't they pay that half?\r\n\r\n\"Then they would be only one year behind, instead of two, and they\r\nwould get no notice to quit.\r\n\r\n\"But instead of paying the one-half which they themselves say the land\r\nis worth, they pay nothing at all. Does that look honest? Does it look\r\ngenuine? Don't you think anybody could see that they are taking\r\nadvantage of the unsettled state of things to avoid any payment\r\nwhatever? They await Home Rule, which is to give them the land, and\r\nthey are anticipating its advantages.\r\n\r\n\"They all know Hennessy's brandy, and can tell you the difference\r\nbetween the one-star and the three-star brands.\r\n\r\n\"In England everybody is at work. In Ireland most are at play. A man\r\nwho has been taught to work in England feels inclined to follow them\r\nup here with a whip, they look so idle even when at work. They move\r\nabout as if half-dead. They are as lazy as Lambert's dog, that leaned\r\nhis head against the wall to bark. The young women won't work either.\r\nMy sister in Athlone is obliged to give her servants three nights a\r\nweek off from five to ten, or she could have nobody. Then they are\r\nalways going to mass or keeping some festival of the Church. Speak a\r\nword of reproof and away they go. They are as proud as Lambert's other\r\ndog, that took the wall of a muck-cart and got squelched for his\r\npains.\r\n\r\n\"Home Rule would never do Ireland any good. Quite the contrary. What\r\ncan do a man good who tries to get his dinner by standing about and\r\nsaying how hungry he is?\r\n\r\n\"As to the agitators, they will always agitate. When one source is\r\ndried up they'll invent another. They have their living to get, and\r\nagitation is their trade. And a paying trade it is. Are they disloyal\r\nto England? I believe them Fenians at heart--that is, Fenians in the\r\nmatter of loyalty. They would use any power they might get to damage\r\nEngland, and if England gives them power she'll bitterly rue the day.\r\nPaddy may be lazy, but put your finger in his mouth and he'll bite.\r\nThe English Separatists don't see this, but when I see the fox in the\r\nhen-roost I can guess what brought him there. If I put the cat in the\r\ndairy I should expect her to taste the cream. Trust the Irish\r\nNationalist members! I'd as soon trust a pack of wolves with my\r\nlambs.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend is a scientific gardener, and descanted on the wonderful\r\nclimate of Ireland, where plants that will not grow in England nourish\r\nluxuriously. I told him I had seen bamboo growing in the open air at\r\nDundalk, and asked him if the Bonds of Brotherhood (_Humbugis\r\nMorleyensis_) or the Union of Hearts (_Gladstonia gammonica\r\ngigantica_) would come to perfection in Hibernia. He thought the soil\r\nand climate unsuitable, and was sure they would never take root. The\r\n_gammonica_ had been tried, but it withered and died. It could not be\r\n\"budded\" for want of an Irish \"stock.\"\r\n\r\nA scrap-book, fifty years old, revealed a condition of things so\r\nstrangely like that of the present day that I obtained permission to\r\ncopy the following skit, which, but for the mention of the old convict\r\ncolony, might have been written last week. It is headed \"Extract from\r\nthe forthcoming history of the Irish Parliament.\" The Home Rule\r\nproject is therefore ancient enough:--\r\n\r\n    One blow and Ireland sprang from the head of her Saxon\r\n    enslaver like a new Minerva!\r\n\r\n    Proudly and solemnly she then sat down to frame a Republic\r\n    worthy of Plato and Pat. Her first\r\n\r\n    President had been a workhouse porter, who was also a night\r\n    watchman. He was, therefore, eminently fitted for both civil\r\n    and military administration. The speech of President Pat on\r\n    opening Congress developes his policy and his well-digested\r\n    plans of legislative reform. Here are a few quotations:--\r\n\r\n    The Key-stone of Government is the Blarney-stone.\r\n\r\n    Political progress may always be accelerated by a bludgeon.\r\n\r\n    Our institutions must be consolidated by soft-soap and whacks.\r\n\r\n    The People's will is made known by manifesto, and by many\r\n    fists too.\r\n\r\n    Every man shall be qualified to sit in Congress that is a\r\n    ten-pound pig-holder, provided that the pig and the member\r\n    sleep under the same roof.\r\n\r\n    Members of Congress will be paid for their services. Gentlemen\r\n    wearing gloves only to have the privilege of shaking the\r\n    President's hand. The unwashed members to be paid at the door.\r\n\r\n    Pipes will not be allowed on the Opposition benches, nor may\r\n    any member take whiskey until challenged by the President.\r\n\r\n    Under no circumstances will a member be suffered to sit with\r\n    his blunderbuss at full cock, nor pointed at the President's\r\n    ear.\r\n\r\n    Our Ambassadors will be chosen from our most meritorious\r\n    postmen, so that they may have no difficulty in reading their\r\n    letters.\r\n\r\n    The Foreign Office will be presided over by a patriotic editor\r\n    who has travelled in New South Wales and is thoroughly\r\n    conversant with the language.\r\n\r\n    Instead of bulwarks, the island will be fortified with Irish\r\n    Bulls, our engineers being of opinion that no other horn-works\r\n    are so efficient.\r\n\r\n    To prevent heartburnings between Landlord and Tenant, a\r\n    Government collector of rents shall be appointed, and\r\n    Tenant-right shall include a power to shoot over the land and\r\n    at anyone on it.\r\n\r\n    And this was written half-a-century ago. It reads like\r\n    yesterday!\r\n\r\nOughewall, June 10th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 35.--IN A CONGESTED DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first station on the Balfour line which is to run from\r\nWestport to Achil Sound--now in process of construction by Mr. Robert\r\nWorthington, the great Dublin contractor, who has built about a\r\nmillion pounds' worth of Irish railway, and who is of opinion that\r\nHome Rule means the bankruptcy of Ireland, and that the labouring\r\npopulation of the country would by it be compelled to emigrate to\r\nEngland, bringing their newly-acquired skill as railway workers into\r\ncompetition with the navvies and general working population. The seven\r\nmiles of line between here and Westport are not yet packed and\r\nballasted, and the ride hither on an engine kindly placed at the\r\ndisposal of the _Gazette_, was not lacking in pleasurable excitement.\r\nThe bogey engine kicked and winced and bucked and cavorted in a\r\nfashion unique in my experience. She seemed to be exhilarated by the\r\npure mountain air, charged with ozone from the Atlantic main. Watching\r\nher little eccentricities, it was hard to believe her not endued with\r\nanimal vitality. She walked the railway like a thing of life. She\r\nducked and dived and plunged and snorted and reared and jibbed like a\r\nveritable cocktailed nag of the true old Irish breed. Sometimes she\r\nseemed to go from under you as she suddenly dipped into a slight\r\ndepression. Sometimes she rolled like a ship at sea, and you began to\r\nwonder if sea-sickness were possible on land. The scenery is not\r\nstriking, and the surrounding country, though poor and desolate, is by\r\nno means sterile. No tracts of black bog, no impassable morasses, no\r\nmiles of rocks and boulders, but a fairly good grazing country, with\r\nhere and there, at long intervals, a white cottage. The engine slows\r\nat one point, where the rails are twisted into serpentine convolutions\r\nby yesterday's tropical heat. Both sides are considerably displaced,\r\nbut they still bear the right relation to each other, and the faithful\r\nmachine, sniffing and picking her way carefully, glides safely over\r\nthe contorted path. A short tunnel, with sides of solid masonry and\r\nroof-arch of brick, again demands extra care, and it is well that the\r\npace is slowed, for half-way through, a man becomes dimly visible\r\nrunning a trolley off the line. Mountains arise on the left and in\r\nfront, and my old friend Croagh Patrick puts in his Nationalist\r\nappearance. Then Newport heaves in sight, a cemetery on high ground\r\nopposite the site of the station, and overhanging the line, kept in\r\nits place by an immense retaining wall, without which the \"rude\r\nforefathers of the hamlet\" would fall from their narrow cells and\r\nblock the progress of the civilising train. A handsome viaduct ends\r\nthe run, _finis coronat opus_, and I walk a hundred yards to see the\r\nawkward spot which at first seemed to have no bottom, but which energy\r\nand industry have conquered, as they conquer everything. The line was\r\ngoing on happily until this point was reached, when a soft bog was\r\nbroached, which threatened to swallow everything, opening its\r\ncavernous jaws with appetite which long seemed insatiable. The\r\nengineer choked it off with a hundred thousand cubic yards of earth, a\r\nquantity which to the untechnical ear sounds like a little kingdom, or\r\nat least like a decent farm, and the bog cried, Hold! enough. The\r\ntotal length of the line will be twenty-six-and-a-half miles, the\r\ncost, exclusive of the permanent way, which is an extra of some £1,800\r\na mile, being £110,000, most of which is dispensed among the labourers\r\nof the district, who thank the Balfour Administration for a great work\r\nwhich would never have been undertaken as a merely commercial\r\nspeculation. The congested areas here, as elsewhere, have been\r\npowerfully assisted and benefited by the sagacity which at once\r\nafforded relief, improved the country, and opened the way to great\r\nmarkets. Temporary assistance is succeeded by a solid and permanent\r\nbenefaction.\r\n\r\nAnd still the people are not happy. Most of them are rather below the\r\nIrish average. Their isolated position in the extreme west, and their\r\nwant of means of communication, may partly account for this. Few ever\r\nsee a newspaper, and when they do they only read stuff concocted for\r\nthem by unscrupulous people who write down to their level, and\r\ndeliberately endeavour to keep them in total darkness. The men\r\nemployed on the line work well, and Mr. William Ross, civil engineer,\r\ntells me they are even better workers than the Galway men, to whom I\r\ngave due credit for industry. The townsfolk are great politicians.\r\nThat is, they echo the absurdities they hear, and are ready to believe\r\nanything, provided it is unlikely enough. The country papers of\r\nIreland are poor and illiterate beyond belief, but their assumption of\r\nknowledge and superior information is amazing. One of the Galway rags\r\nrecently treated its readers to a confidential communication having\r\nreference to the real sentiments of Lord Salisbury and Mr. Balfour as\r\nopposed to those ostensibly affected by those statesmen and to those\r\nwith which they are popularly credited. Lord Salisbury is really dying\r\nfor Home Rule, and Mr. Balfour would depart in peace if he could once\r\nbehold a Dublin Parliament bossed by Tim Healy and William O'Brien.\r\nLord Salisbury is not so bad as he seems, nor is Balfour altogether\r\nbeyond hope of salvation. Both are under a kind of Tory terrorism\r\nwhich makes them say the thing that is not, compels them against their\r\nwishes to fight, forces them reluctantly to make a show of opposition.\r\nBut both of them wink the other eye and have doubtless unbosomed\r\nthemselves--in strict confidence--to the editor of the Galway paper.\r\nThe poor folks of Ireland swallow this stuff, and will quote it\r\ngravely in argument. The _Irish Catholic_ has a large circulation, and\r\na glance over its columns, particularly its advertising columns, is\r\nhighly suggestive at the present juncture. People offer to swop\r\nprayers, just as in _Exchange and Mart_ people wish to barter a pet\r\nhedgehog for a lop-eared rabbit, or a cracked china cup for a gold\r\nwatch and chain. Gentleman wishes someone to say fifteen Hail Marys\r\nevery morning at eight o'clock for a week, while he, in return, will\r\nknock off a similar number of some other good things. The trade in\r\nmasses is surprising. For a certain sum you get one mass a week for a\r\nyear, for a higher figure you get two masses a week _and_ an\r\noleograph, for a trifle more you get mentioned in special prayers for\r\nbenefactors, with a rosary that has touched the relics of\r\nThomas-a-Becket or has been laid on the shrine of Blessed Thomas More.\r\nOne advertisement sets forth the proviso that unless the payment is\r\nregular the supplications will be stopped. No pay, no prayer. _Point\r\nd'argent, point de prêtre._ Prayers and advice, political or\r\notherwise, at lowest terms for cash. No discount allowed. A reduction\r\non taking a quantity.\r\n\r\nA very knowing Newport man explained the present political position.\r\n\"'Tis as simple as Ah, Bay, Say. Parnell wint over to France an'\r\nAmerikay, an' explained to thim how the English was oppressin' and\r\nruinin' the poor Irish people; an' whin the Saxon seen he was found\r\nout, an' whin the Americans sent thousands an' thousands of pounds to\r\npay the cliverist men in Ireland to fight the English in Parlimint,\r\nthin the English begun to give us back part of what they robbed us of.\r\nEvery bite ye get in England manes that much less in an Irish mouth,\r\nan' the counthry is all starvin' becase England is fattenin'. All the\r\nyoung folks is gone out of the counthry; an' why did they go? Becase\r\nEngland makes the laws, an' becase she makes the laws to suit herself,\r\nan' to ruin us. Sure nine-tenths of the land is owned by Englishmen,\r\nwho make us pay twice, aye, an' four times the rint the land is worth;\r\nan' that's what England thinks us good for, an' nothin' else. We're\r\njust slaves to the Saxon, as many's the time I heard the priest sayin'\r\nit. An' it was thrue for him. Sure, the counthry is full of coal, an'\r\nif we wor allowed to get it we'd be as rich as England in five years.\r\nSure, Lord Sligo's estate is made of coal, an' although he's a\r\nConservative, an' a Unionist, an' a Protestant, the English Parlimint\r\nwouldn't allow him to get it because it was in Ireland, an' they wor\r\nafraid the Irish would get betther off. An' sure they want to keep us\r\npaupers, so that we'll be compelled to 'list for sojers, an' fight for\r\nEngland against Rooshia and Prooshia, an' Injy, an' foreign parts,\r\nthat the English is afraid to do for themselves.\"\r\n\r\nHis opinions are not below the intellectual average of those held by\r\nthe majority of the Irish electorate. The ignorance of the rank and\r\nfile of the Irish voters is exasperating to Englishmen, who are quite\r\nunable to understand their credulity, to combat their bitter\r\nprejudices, or to make headway against their preconceived notions.\r\nEnglish Gladstonians who believe that Home Rule ought to be a good\r\nthing will stagger with dismay when confronted with the people who\r\nwill rule the roost. For the intelligent are nowhere in point of\r\nnumbers. The thick-witted believers in charms, in fairies, in the\r\ncurative and preservative virtues of holy water, will have the country\r\nin their hands. The poor benighted peasants, who firmly believe that\r\nMr. Balfour has the moonlighters in his pay, and that the murders of\r\nthe Land League were ordered by Lord Salisbury to cast discredit on\r\nthe national cause--these are the people who, voting as they are told\r\nby the priests, would govern the action of the Irish Parliament. They\r\nbelieve that Home Rule by some magic process will supply the place of\r\nindustry and enterprise, will open up innumerable sources of boundless\r\nwealth, and will bring about Mr. Gladstone's \"chronic plethora\" of\r\nmoney. But, above all, the people are to be for ever delivered from\r\nthe \"English yoke.\" What the phrase means they know not. They only\r\nrepeat what they have heard. The dogs around Newport are muzzled. It\r\nwould be well for the people if their advisers were muzzled too.\r\n\r\nPublic feeling is well organised in Ireland. Although the people are\r\nnot readers of daily news, the kind of sentiment ordered at\r\nhead-quarters is immediately entertained. How it spreads nobody knows,\r\nunless it is spread from the altar. A change has come over the public\r\nsentiment. Among the more intelligent farmers there is a revolt\r\nagainst Home Rule. At a Unionist meeting held the other day at\r\nAthenry, all the speakers agreed on this point. One said that the\r\nchange might be inoperative, because the farmers dare not avow their\r\ntrue opinions, because they have little or no faith in the secrecy of\r\nthe ballot, and because they dread the unknown consequences of ruffian\r\nvengeance. The ignorant masses have also experienced a change. They\r\nhave been undergoing a process of preparation for the next agitation.\r\nThe poor folks at first believed that when they got Home Rule all\r\nwould be well. That consummation devoutly to be wished, was to enrich\r\nthem all. The agitators have to guard against the resentment of the\r\ndisappointed people. They are hedging industriously. If Home Rule\r\nshould come it will do no good, because it is not the right brand.\r\nJohn Bull has spoilt it all, as he spoils everything. Home Rule would\r\nhave done all they promised, but this is not the Home Rule they meant!\r\nThey took it at first as a small instalment of what they would\r\nafterwards kick out of the Saxon, but those outrageous Unionists have\r\nshaved it down to almost nothing. It is not worth having, and the only\r\nthing to do, say some Newport politicians, is for the Irish\r\nNationalist party to rise in a body an' lave the House, an' not put a\r\nfut back into it till they get what they want. I wish my Newport\r\nfriends could make their counsel prevail.\r\n\r\nThe latest phase of feeling, then, is an affected indignation at this\r\nsupreme treachery of the English people. Over and over again I have\r\nquoted the opinions of people who said Mr. Gladstone meant to hoax\r\nIreland again. This was when all seemed to be going quite smoothly.\r\nThe Government concessions and the moderate use of the closure have\r\nconvinced the doubters that they were right, and they breathe battle\r\nand slaughter. Irishmen like fighting debates, decided measures,\r\ntremendously hard hitting. As a people they do not believe in\r\nconstitutional agitation. They would prefer sudden revolutions,\r\ncannons roaring, blood and thunder. They openly avow their preference,\r\nand say that this would have been their method, but that England has\r\nelaborately disarmed the country, which declaration clashes with the\r\npopular opinion, often exultantly expressed, that Ireland is full of\r\narms. The truth is with the revolutionaries, who would certainly\r\nprefer battle but for its well-known danger. If Ireland could be freed\r\nby moonlighters firing at long ranges from behind stone walls, with an\r\ninaccessible retreat within easy reach, the English yoke would have\r\nbut a short shrift.\r\n\r\nA frantic Newporter said:--\"We never got anything by love, but always\r\nby fear, and compulsion should be our motto. I've no patience wid thim\r\nthat'll stand hat in hand, or be going down on their knees to England\r\nfor every bit an' sup. John Mitchel an' James Stephens was the only\r\nmen of modern times who properly understood how to manage the English.\r\nOf coorse, Parnell did something to advance the cause, an' 'tis thrue\r\nthat he had no revolution nor insurrection of the old sort. But the\r\nLand League was arranged to include all the secret associations and to\r\nmake use of thim all. Ye had Whiteboys, an' Fenians an' Ribbonmen agin\r\nye, an' ye can't say but what the secret societies did the business,\r\nan' not what they call the constitutional agitation. Ye might have\r\ntalked to the English Parlimint till doomsday an' ye'd not make it\r\nmove a hair's-breadth for Ireland. But follow up yer talk wid a bit of\r\nshootin' an' then ye'll see what ye will see. 'Twas very bad, an' no\r\nman could agree wid it; but it did what no talkin' would ever have\r\ndone. Compulsion is the right idea. An' what about dynamite? If ye\r\nlook properly at the thing, why wouldn't we use dynamite? Haven't we a\r\nright to do as _we_ choose in Ireland? Ought not the Irish people to\r\nbe masters of Ireland? We say clear out--lave us to ourselves, take\r\naway yer landlords, yer sojers, yer police, an' _thin_ we'll not have\r\nrecoorse to dynamite. We have a right to free ourselves by any means\r\nthat comes handy. All's fair in love an' war. No, I'm not sayin' that\r\nI'd do it meself personally. But whin ye come to look into it, why\r\nwouldn't we be justified in usin' dynamite? Ye pitched shells into\r\nAlexandria whin it suited ye. Why wouldn't we blow up London wid\r\ndynamite, if it suited us?\"\r\n\r\nThe Newport people have not heard of the Union of Hearts. A decent old\r\nman who was trying to sell home-spun tweed of his own making,\r\nsaid:--\"The English has been hittin' us for many a year, but whin we\r\ngit Home Rule we'll be able to hit thim back. God spare me to see that\r\nday!\" And he raised his hat, just as the people mentioned by Mr. A.M.\r\nSullivan, M.P., \"raised their hats reverentially\" when they heard that\r\na landlord or agent was shot. Whenever I hear a friendly sentiment, a\r\nfriendly wish, a friendly aspiration in connection with England from\r\nthe lips of any Nationalist I will gladly record it, if possible, in\r\nletters of gold. I do not expect this to happen. Speakers who attack\r\nEngland are most popular. The more unscrupulous and violent they are,\r\nthe better their reception. Nationalist M.P.'s who in England have\r\nspoken well of Mr. Gladstone or of the English people are sharply\r\nhauled over the coals. The fighting men are the patriot's glory. The\r\nIrish people believe that the introduction of a Home Rule Bill is due\r\nto the action of their bullies, rather than to the persuasive argument\r\nof their civilised men. A very small minority desire to give John Bull\r\nsome credit for fair play, an opinion hotly resented by the mob.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, now, listen to me, thin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, I'm lookin' at ye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't I know we bate the Bill out of Bull.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' how would ye know, at all, at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"How would I know, is it? D'ye take me for a fool?\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah, thin, sure I would not judge ye by yer looks!\"\r\n\r\nThat is a model bar spar, the combatants drinking dog's-nose,\r\nsometimes called \"powdher an' ball\"--a drink of neat whiskey washed\r\ndown by a pot of porter. The Connaught folk drink whiskey neat, but\r\nusually follow the spirit with water. They take up both glasses at\r\nonce, and after a loving sniff at the poteen they pour it slowly down,\r\nthe shebeen stuff tasting like a torchlight procession. Then they\r\nhastily toss off the water, making a wry face, and mostly addressing\r\nto the despised fluid the remark--\r\n\r\n\"Ye'll find IT gone on before!\"\r\n\r\nThe desperate appeal of the Parnellite party for funds has evoked much\r\nmerriment among Irish Unionists, and much burning scorn from\r\nanti-Parnellites--who themselves have much need of the money. A young\r\nfriend has sent me the following parody, adapted from an old and\r\nwell-known, melody:--\r\n\r\n    The patriot came down like a wolf on the fold,\r\n    And all that he asked was their silver and gold;\r\n    And he pocketed all that he got, as his fee,\r\n    From the shores of the Liffey to rocky Tralee.\r\n    Tho' Pat looked as naked and bleak as his soil,\r\n    Yet there stood the patriot to sack up the spoil.\r\n    And from parish to parish the box went its rounds--\r\n    If we give you our speeches you must give us your pounds.\r\n\r\nThe coming golden time is neatly hinted at. Home Rule will pay for\r\nall:--\r\n\r\n    When it comes, you no longer shall lie in a ditch,\r\n    Every beggar among you at once shall be rich;\r\n    The hedger and ditcher shall have an estate,\r\n    And drive his four horses, and dine off his plate.\r\n    What! you won't? And your champion in want of a meal,\r\n    With his coat out at elbows, his shoes down at heel;\r\n    With his heart all as black as his speeches in print!\r\n    Boys, I know what you'll do: you'll just keep back the Rint.\r\n    Now down with your cash, never think of the jail,\r\n    For Erin's true patriots the Virgin is bail;\r\n    She'll rain down bank notes till the bailiff is blind--\r\n    Still you're slack! Then I'll tell you a piece of my mind.\r\n\r\nThe priest is invoked to compel unwilling subscribers:--\r\n\r\n    Would you like to be sent, in the shape of a ghost,\r\n    To be pokered by demons and browned like a toast?\r\n    Or be hung in a blaze with a hook in your backs,\r\n    Till you all melt away like a cake of bees'-wax?\r\n    Would you like to be pitchforked down headlong to Limbo,\r\n    With the Pope standing by with his two arms akimbo?\r\n    No matter who starves, plank down on the spot,\r\n    Pounds, shillings, and pence; we'll take all that you've got.\r\n\r\nThe poem breathes the true spirit of Separatism-cum-Sacerdotalism.\r\n\r\nNewport (Co. Mayo), June 15th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 36.--IRISH IMPROVIDENCE THE STUMBLING BLOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe further journey from Newport to Mulranney on the _Gazette_ special\r\nengine was yesterday delayed for a few hours by the announcement that\r\nduring the night part of the line had sunk into a bog--a circumstance\r\nwhich might have seemed unusual and ominous to English engineers, but\r\nwhich Mr. Lionel Vaughan Bennett regarded as a mere matter of daily\r\nroutine, hardly worth more than a passing mention. There was nothing\r\nfor it but to take another walk round Newport, and after further\r\nadmiring the great wall holding up the embankment opposite the\r\nstation--a colossal work executed under great difficulties--to look at\r\nthe surrounding landscape. Those who are interested in engineering may\r\nlike to know the dimensions of this wall, which is two hundred feet\r\nlong, thirty-five feet high, and ten feet thick at the base, tapering\r\noff to a thickness of five feet at the top, and is built of a fine\r\nlimestone quarried from the railway cutting a little further out. The\r\nview from either of the ridges between which the town is built, is\r\nmagnificent, mountain, valley, sea, and river contributing to the\r\neffect. From one ridge you see Clew Bay and the Croagh Patrick range,\r\nwith an immense tract of country of varied appearance. From the other,\r\nimmediately above the station, an enormous valley stretches away to\r\nthe Bogagh mountain in front and the peaked summit of Lettermoughra on\r\nthe left. At the latter point of view are some wooden cabins which the\r\nSaxon might mistake for pigsties or small cowsheds until he discovered\r\nthey were inhabited by patriots, keen on Home Rule and charitable\r\ncoppers. Beware of civility in these parts. From casual passers-by it\r\nnearly always means an appeal for alms, and after a few days'\r\nexperience you are apt to fall into misanthropy. Some of these beggars\r\nhave a fine dramatic way of opening the conversation. A hale and\r\nseemingly able-bodied man of fifty or thereabouts came up carrying a\r\nwheel, which he dropped when about ten yards away with the fervently\r\nuttered exclamation--\r\n\r\n\"God help the poor--owld--man!\"\r\n\r\nThis adjuration falling short of its aim, he came up and asked for \"a\r\nfew coppers,\" at the same time invoking about sixpennyworth of\r\nblessings in advance, a sort of sprat to catch a mackerel.\r\n\r\n\"Got no coppers,\" I said, rather impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"May ye never have one till the day of yer death,\" said the good old\r\nman, this time with an unmistakable accent of sincerity. He hobbled\r\noff with the wheel, muttering something which may have been blessings,\r\nand a fine healthy young fellow came up. \"Good mornin', an' 'tis a\r\nfoin bit of scenery, but we can't ate it, an' we'd die afore we'd go\r\ninto the poorhouse, an' a thrifle of money for a dhraw at the pipe\r\nwould be as welkim as the flowers of May, an' 'tis England is the\r\ngrate counthry, and thim that was in it says that Englishmen is tin\r\nper cint. betther than Irishmen, aye, twinty per cint.\"--and so\r\nforth, and so forth. There were six more applications in a hundred\r\nyards, one of them from a well-dressed boy of fourteen or fifteen, who\r\ngracefully reclined on a bank with his legs crossed, his arms under\r\nhis head. Begging to the Irish race is as natural as breathing. They\r\nhave an innate affinity for blessing and begging, and they beg without\r\nneed. Anything to avoid work. They are for the most part entirely\r\ndestitute of a spirit of independence. They will not dig, and to beg\r\nthey are not ashamed. According to a Newport authority they are\r\ngrowing worse than ever. While I awaited the fishing up of the line he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"The conduct of the poorer classes is becoming more and more a\r\ndisgrace to the country. There is poverty, of course, but not so much,\r\nnor in so great a proportion, as in England. This line has been in\r\nprogress for two years and a half, and the people of this district\r\nhave received many thousands of pounds without any perceptible\r\nimprovement of position, either as to solvency or personal appearance.\r\nThey are as ragged as ever, as dirty as ever, and decidedly more\r\ndishonest than ever. They are more extravagant in their eating and\r\ndrinking, and the women spend more in ridiculous finery; but in spite\r\nof the wages they have earned, they have not paid their way one bit\r\nbetter than before. They usually sow the land and live on the crops,\r\nselling the surplus to pay the rent, which is usually very moderate,\r\nand well within what the land will pay. For thirty months many\r\nhundreds of them, thanks to Mr. Balfour, have enjoyed an additional\r\nincome of fifteen shillings a week, but they have not paid their rents\r\nany better than before. They have so many people agitating for them,\r\nboth here and in England, that whatever they do or fail to do, they\r\nknow they are sure of substantial support. While Irishmen only were\r\nworking for them, they felt less secure, but now Mr. Gladstone and his\r\nfollowing have taken their cause in hand, they feel more sure of their\r\nground, and accordingly they have lapsed into confirmed laziness and\r\ndishonesty. They have found out the strength of combination, and the\r\npossibility of withholding payment of rent, and year by year they are\r\nfalling lower and lower. Their morality is sapped at the root. They\r\nhave the utmost confidence in their clergy, and their conduct being\r\nsupported, and even advised from the altar, they spend all their money\r\nquite comfortably, sure that in case of eviction the country will be\r\nup in arms for their assistance, and that weak but well-meaning\r\nEnglish tourists, seeing their apparent condition, will help them\r\nliberally. The English tourist has much to answer for. He couples dirt\r\nand nakedness with misfortune and poverty, and nine times out of ten\r\nhe is altogether wrong. People with five hundred pounds in the bank\r\nwill go about barefoot, unwashed, and in rags. No Englishman can\r\npossibly know his way about until he has lived for some time in the\r\ncountry, remaining in one spot long enough to find out the real state\r\nof things. He runs about hurriedly from place to place, observing\r\ncertain symptoms which in England mean undeserved poverty and\r\nsuffering. His diagnosis would be right for England, but for Ireland\r\nit is hopelessly wrong. What he sees is not so often symptomatic of\r\nundeserved misfortune, as of laziness, improvidence, and rank\r\ndishonesty. The Irish are a complaining people. Self-help is\r\npractically unknown among them, at any rate, among the Catholic\r\npopulation. They have reduced complaining to a system, or, if you\r\nwill, they have elevated it to the level of a fine art. The recent\r\nagitations have demolished any rudimentary backbone they ever had, and\r\nthe No-rent Campaign, with its pleas of poverty and financial\r\ninability, has done more to pauperise the people than all the famines\r\nIreland ever saw.\r\n\r\n\"You can do nothing for them. One great argument for Home Rule is the\r\nfact that the people are leaving the country. Best thing they can do.\r\nLet them get to some country where they must work or starve. Then they\r\nwill do well enough. They work like horses in America, and their\r\nnative cuteness conies out in trade with surprising results. The Irish\r\nrace make a splendid mixture, but you must not take them neat. I am\r\nlooked upon as a monster when I say, Let them go. I think it would be\r\nbest. Let them clear out of the country, and leave it to people who\r\ncan make it pay. Let Ireland be populated by Englishmen or Scotsmen,\r\nor both, and in twenty years the country would be one of the most\r\nprosperous in the world. Those are my opinions, and few Irishmen will\r\ngainsay them. They think them cruel, but their truth is generally\r\nadmitted. Mr. Balfour has helped the people, and in a way which was\r\nbest calculated to put them permanently on their feet. All to no\r\npurpose. You can't go on making lines that will not pay. You can't go\r\non doling out charity for ever. Take the boats, nets, and so on, given\r\nto the congested districts. When those are gone you may give them\r\nmore. The people will be exactly where they were. A few have been\r\ntaught fishing, you say. But it will not spread. Those who have\r\nlearned the art have been taught almost by compulsion, and at the\r\nfirst opportunity they will fall back into their own ways. The farmers\r\nwill not change their methods. If one among them did so he would be a\r\nmark for derision. No Irish villager has the pluck to say, I will do\r\nthis or that because it is the best thing to do. He must do as the\r\nothers do, even to planting his farm, selling the produce, and also in\r\ndisposing of the proceeds. Nowhere is public opinion so powerful, so\r\ntyrannical, or so injuriously conservative as in Ireland. I challenge\r\ncontradiction. Any intelligent Irishman who has lived in an\r\nagricultural and Roman Catholic neighbourhood will admit every\r\nstatement I have made.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the day I laid these observations before three Irish\r\ngentlemen dining at the Mulranney Hotel. All three readily and fully\r\nconcurred, and there can be no doubt that these sentiments will be\r\nunanimously confirmed by any competent tribunal in or out of Ireland,\r\nSuch being the case, the absurdity of the Home Rule agitation becomes\r\nevident at once.\r\n\r\nAt last the sportive young engine whose playfulness and prankishness\r\nwere mentioned in my last, came whinnying up, harnessed to an empty\r\ntruck in which was a bench with a green cloth, emblematic of Ireland.\r\nThis was better than convulsively clinging to the engine while she\r\nmadly careered along narrow and dizzy precipices, every kick\r\nthreatening to be your last, and emerging from the fiery ordeal,\r\nbegrimed and swarthy, your knees half cooked by the engine fire. All\r\nthis happened on my journey from Westport to Newport, but now the\r\ntruck promised Sybaritic luxury, and if the rail should again give\r\nway, if the bog-hole, \"still gaping to devour me, opened wide,\" I\r\nshould at least disappear with dignity, should take my _holium cum\r\ndignitatis_ in a truck, on a green-covered seat, and with the\r\nconsciousness that I was doing something to fill up the gap, to solace\r\nthe aching void in Ireland's bosom. Away we went, thundering along\r\nbetween the quivering bogs, as through a land of brown-black\r\ncalves'-foot jelly. The line itself is sound, well-made and firm. I\r\nhad this from Mr. Hare, engineer of the Board of Works, who said that\r\nMr. Worthington's railways have an excellent name for solidity and\r\nthorough, conscientious work. Mr. Hare was formally taking over the\r\nlast bit of line, that between Mulranney and Achil Sound, with which\r\nthe Midland and Great Western Company will at present have nought to\r\ndo. The company will work from Westport to Mulranney, although some\r\nportions of the line have a gradient of one in sixty, and the\r\ndirectors are shy of anything steeper than one in a hundred by reason\r\nof the wear and tear involved to rolling stock and permanent way by\r\ngradients requiring so much brake power. But the last seven miles they\r\ndecline to touch on the terms offered by the Government at present. No\r\ndoubt the line will be worked, and by the company aforesaid, but the\r\ncontracting parties are for the moment at a deadlock. No line between\r\nMulranney and the Sound could possibly pay. England is building Irish\r\nrailways to give the people a chance, as the splendid quays of\r\nNewport, Limerick, and Galway were built.\r\n\r\nNothing, or next to nothing, is done on these quays. The Channel, as\r\nit is called at Newport, is a fine expanse of water about one hundred\r\nand twenty yards wide, leading through Newport Bay directly into the\r\nAtlantic. Only one boat, I was told, comes into the port. I saw it\r\nthere, unloading a hundred and eighty tons of Indian corn--a Glasgow\r\nvessel, the Harmony, a sailer, which had taken three weeks to the\r\nvoyage, which a steamer easily runs in thirty six to forty hours.\r\nGalway was busier, but not by Irish enterprise, and Limerick was\r\nmostly fast asleep. The people cry aloud and shout for quays,\r\nharbours, piers, and railways; and when they are built they ask for\r\nsomething else. They are without the faculty of industrial enterprise.\r\nThey are always waiting for weather, wind, and tide. They lack\r\nresourcefulness, energy, invention. When the flour mills ceased to pay\r\nthey had no notion of using the buildings and water-power for some\r\nother purpose. When the Coventry ribbon trade went to the dogs the\r\npeople found salvation in bicycles. If Coventry had been in Ireland\r\nthe people would have starved and murmured to the end of time.\r\n\r\nTwo miles out we came to Deradda, where eighty men were at work. Next\r\ncame Shellogah and the squeamish bit of bog. A number of men were busy\r\non the line, and right in front of us was a gap in the rails, the\r\nplatelayers laying the steel for dear life while the engine came up.\r\nWe slackened speed, but made no stop, and the last rail was finally\r\nbolted as we ran upon it. Carefully and gingerly we pushed along, my\r\ntriumphal chariot in front of the engine, over the shivering\r\nembankment, on each side of which were deep-cut channels which seemed\r\nto have been hewn through acres of Day and Martin's blacking, so jetty\r\nand oily seemed this Irish bog. The subsidence of yesterday had forced\r\nthe boundary walls of the line into wide semicircles, and it seemed\r\nlikely to be touch-and-go with the engine, truck, and your humble\r\ncommissioner. I took a last look at the landscape, and made a final\r\nnote, but, while inly wondering whether I should be ultimately\r\nconsumed in the form of peat or dug up and exhibited to future ages as\r\na bog-preserved brutal Saxon, with a concluding squash we passed the\r\nrotten spot, and it was permissible to breathe again. \"We prefer it to\r\nsink at once,\" said Mr. Bennett. \"Then we know the 'hard' is not far\r\noff, and we can fill up till the line becomes solid as a rock. When it\r\ngoes down by degrees, sinking a foot to-day and a foot to-morrow, we\r\nfind our work more difficult. We never leave a bad bit till we are\r\nassured, by careful examination and severe and repeated tests, that\r\nall is solid and secure.\" He told me how much earth had been dumped on\r\nthis spot, which, like the soft place mentioned in my last, has given\r\nMr. Balfour's _protégés_ a world of employment. I forget the quantity,\r\nbut it sounded like an island or a small range of mountains. Soon on\r\nthe left we saw the great expanse of Clew Bay, with its three hundred\r\nand sixty-five considerable islands, nearly all with cottages, cattle,\r\nand pasture, but without a tree. The Yankee breezes blew refreshingly,\r\nand the scenery around became of wildest grandeur. High mountains\r\nhemmed us in on every side, rising one over another, huge masses of\r\nrock impending over untrodden passes, unknown to any guide-book, and\r\nleading no man knows whither. Some mountain sheep on the line scaled\r\nthe embankment and leaped the five-foot wall like squirrels. Then a\r\ngroup of obstinate black cattle, one of which narrowly escaped sudden\r\ntransformation into beef. Then the station of Mulranney, or rather its\r\nsite, for the foundations are not yet dug out. Some neat wooden\r\ncottages attested the contractor's care for his workmen, and the\r\nbeautiful bay with its extensive sands and lovely surroundings came\r\ninto view far below. A steep descent brought us to the hotel, an\r\nunlicensed house kept by a Northern Protestant. A quaint and charming\r\nplace, known and prized by a select few. The Board of Works gave\r\nMulrannoy a pier, but the whole bay boasted only a single boat. The\r\npeople make no use of their pier. It stretches into the sea in a\r\nlonely, melancholy way, and, so far as I could see, without a boat\r\nnear it, without a soul upon it or within half-a-mile. The Mulranians\r\ncannot do anything with the pier until they get Home Rule. In Limerick\r\none day I saw a dead cat before a cottage door, in a crowded part of\r\nIrishtown. A week later pussy was diffusing an aromatic fragrance from\r\nthe self-same spot. The denizens of this locality are waiting for Home\r\nRule. They cannot move their dead cats while smarting 'neath the cruel\r\nEnglish yoke.\r\n\r\nThe Home Rulers of Mulranney are not original. They say the same\r\nthings over and over again, merely echoing what they have been told by\r\nothers. They believe that their country has unlimited good coal, and\r\nthat the English Parliament prevents the mines being sunk for fear of\r\nlosing Irish custom. \"We wish it were trap,\" said Mr. Bennett. \"We are\r\nalways looking for it, but although we have made a million's worth of\r\nrailway, we have never seen a vestige of coal. It is safe to say that\r\nthere is no coal in Ireland, except in one or two well-known spots,\r\nwhere it exists, and is mined, in small quantities.\" Another\r\nenlightened Irishman, of wide experience in many lands, expressed the\r\nconviction of the majority of his countrymen that the proposed\r\nParliamentary change will never take place.\r\n\r\n\"The thing is too ridiculous to be possible. The respectable portion\r\nof the community were alarmed at first, as well they might be, knowing\r\nas they do precisely what it means. But as time went on that alarm has\r\nto a great extent subsided, not, as some will say, because the people\r\nare in any degree reconciled to the idea, but purely and simply\r\nbecause they see that the bill must perish when exposed to the light\r\nof criticism. The people as a whole do not want the bill. The poorer\r\nclasses do not know in the least what it means, nor what all the\r\nbother is about. They are told that they will be hugely benefited, but\r\nnobody can tell them how. Of course they vote for Home Rule, because\r\nin these parts the priest stands at the door of the polling booth and\r\ntells them as they go in how they are to vote. He also questions them\r\nas they come out, and they know beforehand that he will do so, and act\r\naccordingly. They dare not tell him a lie, for fear of spiritual\r\ntrouble. They believe that the priest has their eternal future in his\r\nhands, and this belief is encouraged by the well-known argument used\r\nby the Roman Catholic clergy, a very familiar phrase in Ireland, \"You\r\nmust do as I tell you, for _I_ am responsible. God will require your\r\nsoul of _me_ at the day of judgement!\" What can the poor folks do?\r\nEven the higher classes are not exempt from this superstitious fear.\r\nThey may be more or less freethinkers--freethinking is common among\r\neducated Catholics who are yet compelled by custom to conform to the\r\noutward observances of their faith--but yet, when the pinch comes,\r\nthey are influenced by the prepossessions of their childhood and\r\nenvironments, and they mostly vote as they are told. They dread to\r\noffend the priest, though not to the same extent as the poor\r\npeasantry, who believe that confession of a wrong vote would entail\r\nthe refusal of extreme unction, and that this would mean untold and\r\nendless torture in the world to come. And the priests preach politics\r\nevery Sunday. The people like it better than the old style of\r\nInstruction. They call their sermons Instructions, you know, and they\r\ninstruct the people to some tune. No doubt they have a right to\r\npersuade their flocks to follow a certain course. The temptation to\r\npreach something which at once catches the people's attention and\r\nfurthers their own views is very great, and perhaps excusable. But is\r\ntheir teaching designed or calculated to suit England? The English may\r\nnot understand the Irish question, but they may be sure that whatever\r\nsuits the Papal power does not suit them. The modern Irish priest is a\r\nsworn foe to England. It cannot be otherwise. He springs from the\r\nsmall farmer class, which has sworn to extirpate landlordism, which,\r\nto their minds, is synonymous with British rule. The English\r\nParliament, hoping to win over the farmers, who are the strength of\r\nIreland, has made one concession after another, with what result?\r\nAbsolutely none. The property of the landlord has been sacrificed bit\r\nby bit, in fruitless endeavour to please these people, who are more\r\ndiscontented than ever. And so they will continue to be as long as\r\ndiscontent pays. In Ireland the landlord is nothing, the tenant is\r\neverything. The policy of England with regard to Irish landlords\r\nreminds me of the man who, having to dock a dog's tail, cut off\r\nhalf-an-inch every day to gradually accustom him to the loss, and to\r\nminimise the 'suffering of the baste.'\"\r\n\r\nYou can go nowhere in Ireland without meeting an Ulsterman. There was\r\none at Mulranney. You may know them by their accent, by their size, by\r\na general effect of weight, decision, and determination. They are\r\nmostly big men, large-boned and large-limbed, of ruthless energy, of\r\ninexhaustible vitality. They are demons in argument, tenacious and\r\ncrushing. They bowl straight over-hand and dead on the middle stump.\r\nThe lithe and sinuous Celt is no match for them. No matter how he\r\ntwists and turns they grab him up, and, will he, nill he, fix him in\r\nfront of the argument. They are adepts in cornering an opponent by\r\nkeeping him to the point. You cannot catch them napping, and you\r\ncannot turn their flank. They are contented enough, except that they\r\nsigh for more worlds to conquer. They delight in difficulties, and\r\ndemolish Home Rulers with a kind of contempt as if the work were only\r\nfit for children. They seem to be fighting with one hand, with great\r\nreserve of power, and, after doubling up an opponent, they chuck him\r\nover the ropes, and look around, as if, like Oliver, asking for\r\n\"more.\" My Mulranney friend said:--\r\n\r\n\"Bull confessedly does not know what to do, and he calls in two sets\r\nof Irish experts (we'll say) and asks for their opinions. One set of\r\nIrishmen never quarrel with anybody and always pay their debts. The\r\nother set quarrel with everybody and don't pay what they owe. One set\r\nare successful in everything, the other set are successful in nothing.\r\nOne set have always been friendly and helpful to Bull, the other set\r\nhave always been unfriendly and obstructive to him. He proposes to\r\nreject the advice of the successful, amicable, helpful men, who have\r\nalways stuck up for him, and to follow the advice of the quarrelsome,\r\nunsuccessful, unfriendly men, who have always spoken ill of him and\r\nhave spent their energies in trying to damage him. Bull must be a\r\nfool--or rather he would be if he meant to act in this foolish way. He\r\nwill not do so; that can never be. But why waste so much time?\"\r\n\r\nI submitted that this waste was due to Mr. Gladstone, and not to\r\nEngland at all. He said--\r\n\r\n\"There is no England now. There's nothing left but Gladstone.\"\r\n\r\nOf course he was wrong, but the mistake is one that under present\r\ncircumstances any loyal Irishman might easily make.\r\n\r\nMulranney (Co. Mayo), June 17th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 37.--ON ACHIL ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final spurt from Mulranney to Achil Sound was pleasant, but devoid\r\nof striking incident. This part of the line is packed and ballasted,\r\nand the _Gazette_ engine sobered down to the merely commonplace,\r\ndropping her prancing and curveting, with other deplorable excesses of\r\nthe first two runs, and pushing my comfortable truck with the\r\nsteadiness of a well-broken steed. No holding on was required, as we\r\nran between the two ranges of mountains which guard the Sound, and\r\nalong the edge of a salt-water creek, which seemed to be pushing its\r\ninvestigations inland. Barring the scenery the ride became\r\nuninteresting by its very safety. The line for the most part is based\r\nupon the living rock, and there were no exciting skims over\r\ntreacherous bogs, no reasonable chance of running off the line, no ups\r\nand downs such as on our first flight were remindful of the switchback\r\nrailway, no hopping, jumping, or skipping. Anybody could have ridden\r\nfrom Mulranney to Achil. There was no merit in the achievement. All\r\nyou had to do was to sit still and look about. You could no longer\r\nwitch the world with noble truckmanship. We ran over a bridge built to\r\nreplace one washed away by a mountain torrent. The engineer who\r\nconstructed the first had failed to realise that the tinkling rivulet\r\nof summer became in winter a fiercely surging cataract. The Achil\r\nMountains loomed in full view, Croaghaun to the left, Sliebhmor\r\n(pronounced Slievemore) the Great Mountain, in front, with many others\r\nstranger still of name. Then the Sound came in sight, with the iron\r\nviaduct-bridge which has turned the island into a peninsula. Then the\r\nfinal dismount, and a scramble among rusty rails, embankments,\r\nsleepers, and big boulders strewn about in hopeless chaos. Then the\r\nlittle inn, with a stuffed fox and a swan in the porch. A glance at\r\nthe day-before-yesterday's paper, which has just arrived, and is\r\nconsidered to serve up news red-hot; and then invasion of the island.\r\nA few hookers are anchored near the swivel-bridge of the viaduct, in\r\nreadiness for their cargoes of harvesters for England and Scotland,\r\nand now and then big trout and salmon throw themselves in air to see\r\nwhat is going on in the world around them. A group of men who are\r\nbusily engaged in doing nothing, with a grace and ease which tells of\r\nlong experience, manifest great interest in the stranger, whom they\r\ngreet civilly and with much politeness. Men, women, and children are\r\ndigging turf in a bog beside the road. All suspend operations and look\r\nearnestly in my direction. This is one of the amenities of Irish life.\r\nDriving along a country road you see men at work in a field. They stop\r\nat the first rumble of the car, and leaning on their spades they watch\r\nyou out of sight. Then they resume in leisurely style, for work they\r\nwill tell you is scarce, and, to their credit be it observed, they\r\nshow no disposition to make it scarcer still. They husband it, hoard\r\nit up, are not too greedy, leave some for another day. They dig\r\neasily, with a straight back, and take a long time to turn round. The\r\nsavage energy of the Saxon is to them unknown. Why wear themselves\r\nout? \"Sweet bad luck to the man that would bur-rst himself as if the\r\nwuruld wouldn't be afther him. Divil sweep the omadhaun that would\r\nmake his two elbows into a windmill that niver shtops, but is always\r\ngoing. Fair an' aisy goes far in a day. Walkin' is betther than\r\nrunnin', an' standin' is betther than walkin', an' sittin' is betther\r\nthan standin', an' lyin' is betther than any o' thim. Twas me owld\r\nfather said it, an' a thrue wurud he shpoke, rest his sowl in glory.\"\r\n\r\nThe Achil folks are ardent politicians. They have been visited by\r\nMichael Davitt, Dr. Tanner, and others, and most of the population,\r\nall the Catholics in fact, became members of the Land League. The area\r\nof the island is about forty thousand acres, a vast moorland, with\r\nmiles of bog, and hills and mountains in every direction. There are\r\nalso several large lakes, which abound with white trout. The\r\ncultivated portions of the land only seem to dot the great waste,\r\nwhich nevertheless supports a population of some five thousand\r\npersons. The houses are mostly filthy, the people having cattle which\r\nlive with the family. I approached a house to make inquiries, and was\r\ndriven from the open door by the smell issuing from the interior. The\r\nnext was sweeter, having perhaps been more recently cleaned out. Only\r\none room, with a big turf fire, creating an intolerable atmosphere. A\r\nbed filled one-third of the floor, most of the remainder being\r\noccupied by two cows. A rough deal table near the bed comprised the\r\nfurniture, and visitors, therefore, must sit on the sleeping\r\narrangement. A civilised Irishman said:--\"Two cows, two clean cows\r\nonly, and you're surprised at that! Where have you been? Where have\r\nyou been brought up? Let me tell you something, and when you get to\r\nDugort ask the doctor there whether I am correct. A family not far\r\naway were stricken down with typhus fever. The people are mostly\r\nhealthy and strong, although living under circumstances which would\r\nsoon kill people not used to them, or not enjoying the same splendidly\r\npure air. Well, the poor folks, eight of them, were all down at once,\r\nand no wonder, for when I visited them I never saw such a sight in my\r\nlife. There were three in one bed in one corner, three in one bed in\r\nanother corner, and two in shake-down beds on the floor. In the same\r\nroom were a mare and foal, three cows, one pig under a bed, and a\r\nhenroost above, on the ceiling. What would the sanitary authorities of\r\nBirmingham say to that menagerie in a sick room? Somebody wrote to the\r\nLocal Government Board, and the Board referred the matter to the Poor\r\nLaw Guardians. But the Guardians themselves kept cattle in their\r\nhouses. It is the prevailing custom. Wherever you go in Achil, you\r\nwill find cattle in the houses, along with the family, sharing the\r\nsame room. The people cannot be moved from this custom. A large\r\nlandowner built some good cottages for them, and offered them rent\r\nfree, on condition that they would not live with the cattle. The\r\npeople would not accept, so they got the houses at last on their own\r\nterms, and took the cows with them as before. They say that the cows\r\nenjoy the warmth and give better milk. They also say that the big turf\r\nfire stands them in lieu of feed to some extent. The Achil folks are\r\nhopeless in the direction of improvements. They have had the\r\nProtestant Colony at Dugort before them for more than sixty years--a\r\nwell-housed, well-clad community, living clearly and respectably,\r\npaying their way, and keeping at peace with all men, but they have not\r\nmoved an inch in the same direction. They bury their dead in the old\r\nsavage way, without any funeral rites, except such as the relatives\r\nmay have in their minds. The priest says no prayer, reads no service,\r\ndoes not attend in his official character, unless specially engaged\r\nand paid. Usually he does not attend funerals at all, although he may\r\nsometimes join the procession as a mark of respect. And the weddings\r\nare arranged in a way you might think barbarous. A young man fancies a\r\ngirl he sees at mass, or at a funeral. He gets a bottle of whiskey and\r\ngoes to see the father, who nearly always wishes to get the daughter\r\noff his hands, without any regard whatever for the poor girl's\r\nfeelings. I was present at one of these negotiations. 'What will you\r\ngive with her?' said the young fellow, a boy of eighteen or so. 'Three\r\ncows and a calf,' said the father. 'So-and-so got three cows and a\r\ncalf and a sheep.' said the suitor. The father pondered a bit, but\r\neventually, not to be behind, conceded the sheep. The lover tried a\r\nbit further. Somebody else had three cows and a calf and a sheep and a\r\nlamb, but the old man stood firm, and the bargain was struck, with\r\nmutual esteem, after several hours' haggling and a second bottle of\r\nwhiskey. I called in the evening to learn the girl's fate. She had\r\nbeen two years in service and had got unorthodox notions. She\r\nscreamed with affright when the father brought the fellow forward and\r\ntold her what was arranged. She had seen him before, but had never\r\nspoken to him, and the sight of him had always been most repugnant to\r\nher. She ran away into the bogs, but the country was up, and she was\r\nsoon found. Then after a sound beating she was handed over to the\r\nardent swain along with the cows, and so forth, nominated in the bond.\r\n\r\n\"They marry early or go to America. The boy is usually seventeen or\r\neighteen, the girl fifteen or sixteen. I have known girls marry at\r\nthirteen. Not long ago a boy I knew well, a mere weakling, unable to\r\ndo even a boy's work, got married. He was seventeen, or nearly\r\nseventeen, but he didn't look it. They believe that their poverty,\r\nsuch as it is, is due to the predominance of England. Their hatred of\r\nthe English is very pronounced, but a casual visitor will not see it.\r\nHe has money to spend, and they flock round him in a friendly way. But\r\nlet him live among them! They tried to boycott the Protestant\r\nsettlement, and if their priests had ruled on that occasion they would\r\nhave starved us out or would have made things so unpleasant that we\r\nmust have left the field. That was during the Land League agitation.\r\nThe Protestants declined to join and vengeance was declared, but\r\nBonaventure, head of the monastery, forbade it. He is a splendid\r\nfellow, not like the ordinary priests at all. So they were saved. But\r\nlet this change come about, once let that bill become law, and all\r\nProtestants must leave the island, must give up the land they have\r\ntilled and tended until it is like a garden, and seek their fortunes\r\nelsewhere. That is a certainty. Ask everyone you meet, and you will\r\nfind that each will say just the same thing.\"\r\n\r\nA smart car driver, named Matthew Henay, was dubious as to the\r\nbenefits accruing from Home Rule. His driving was a study, and his\r\nconversations with Maggie, his little mare, were both varied and\r\nvigorous. \"Now me little daughter, away ye go. That's the girl now. Me\r\nlittle duck, ye go sweetly. There's the beauty, now. Maggie me love,\r\nme darlint, me pride; ye know ivery word I spake. Yes, she does, Sorr.\r\nShe ondhershtands both English an' Irish. I can dhrive her in both,\r\nbut I have an owld woman o' me own that can only dhrive her in Irish.\r\nHome Rule will do no good at all. Twinty years I wint to England to\r\nharvest, an' eighteen iv it to the same masther an' on the same farm.\r\nAn' ye don't get me to belave all I hear widout thinkin' a bit. An' I\r\nsay, get out o' that wid yer talk o' mines an' factories, an' rubbish.\r\nWhere's the money to come from? says I. That's what nobody knows.\r\nSure, we'd be nothin' widout England. A thousand goes from this part\r\nevery year, an' even the girls brings back ten to fifteen pounds each.\r\nThat's all the circulation of money we have. An' as all we get's from\r\nEngland, I say, let us stick to England, but nobody agrees wid me.\r\nThere's the girl, now. Away ye go, me little duck, me daughter, me\r\nbeauty, me--bad luck to ye, _will_ ye go? What are ye standin' there\r\nfor? Will ye get out o' that, ye lazy brute? Take that, an' that, an'\r\n_that_, ye idle, good-for-nothin', desavin', durty daughter of a pig.\r\n_Now_ d'ye ondhershtand who's masther, ye idle, skulkin', schamin',\r\ndisrespictable baste?\"\r\n\r\nMisther Henay was favourably disposed towards the Protestant settlers\r\nof Dugort, but another Sounder was very bitter indeed. \"A set of\r\nSoupers an' Jumpers an' Double-Jumpers. What's the manin' iv it ye\r\nask? Soupers is Catholics that's turned Protestants for the sake of\r\nsmall pickin's sich as soup. That's what they are at Dugort. An'\r\nJumpers is worse than Soupers. For Soupers only changed once, but\r\nJumpers is thim that turned once an' then turned back again, jumpin'\r\nabout from one religion to another. Ye can have Jumpers in anythin'.\r\nYe can have thim in politics. Owld Gladstone is a Jumper and a\r\nDouble-Jumper an' a Double-Thribble Jumper. An' if we get a Parlimint\r\nfor ourselves, 'tis because he daren't for the life of him say No--an'\r\ndivil thank him. Yes, we'll take the bill; what else will we do? We\r\ncan amend it whin once we get it. But afther so much jumpin', owld\r\nGladstone's a man I wouldn't thrust. A man that would make so many\r\nchanges isn't to be thrusted. I wouldn't be surprised if he wouldn't\r\nbring in a coercion bill at any minute. Ah, the thricks an' the dodges\r\niv him! An' the silver tongue he has in his head! Begorra, I wouldn't\r\nlave him out o' me sight. 'Tis himself would stale the cross off a\r\ndonkey's back.\"\r\n\r\nThe Achil ditches are full of ferns, and a hundred yards from the sea\r\nare clumps of _Osmunda regalis_--otherwise known as the Royal\r\nfern--spreading out palm-like fronds four feet long. Other ferns,\r\nusually regarded as rare, abound in every direction, and potatoes and\r\ncabbages grow at the very water's edge. The vast plains are treeless\r\nsave for the plantations round the house of Major Pike, who has shown\r\nwhat can be done to reclaim the land, but his excellent example has\r\nattracted no imitators. Except in the Major's grounds there is not a\r\ntree on the island, unless we count the hedges of fuchsias, twelve to\r\nfifteen feet high, which fence in some of the gardens. The Post\r\nOffice, engineered by Mr. Robins, of Devonshire, an old\r\ncoastguardsman, is surrounded by fuchsia bloom, and every evidence of\r\ncareful culture. Here I met some Achil folks who did not understand\r\nEnglish, and a mainland man who does not believe in the future of the\r\nrace. He said:--\r\n\r\n\"I think their civilisation has stood still for at least five\r\ncenturies. They are so wedded to their ancient customs that nothing\r\ncan be done for them. They are not so poor as they look, and the\r\nstarvation of which you hear in England is totally unknown. As an\r\nobject of charity Achil is a gigantic swindle. When the seed potatoes\r\nwere brought here in Her Majesty's gunboats the people were too lazy\r\nto fetch them ashore. I was there and heard an Irish bluejacket\r\ncursing them as a disgrace to his country. They do just what the\r\npriests tell them from week to week. Every Sunday they get their\r\ninstructions. They keep up the cry of distress when there is no\r\ndistress, for fear of breaking through the custom. They have been\r\nhelped on all sides, but they will not utilise their advantages. The\r\nsea is before them, swarming with fish, which they will not catch.\r\nThey said, we have no pier, no quay. They were set up with these and\r\neverything they needed. What did they do with them? Nothing at all.\r\nThe work is falling to pieces and they let it go. They sometimes go\r\nout in coraghs, and catch enough fish for the day's food, but that is\r\nall. They don't pay their rents, and their rents would amuse you.\r\nTwenty-five shillings a year for a decent house and a good piece of\r\nland is reckoned a heavy responsibility. One man I know named McGreal\r\nhas twenty acres of good land and a house for seventeen shillings and\r\nsixpence a year. They will not sell you butter, they will not sell you\r\nmilk. They say they want it for themselves. None of them has ever paid\r\na cent for fuel. All have turf for the digging, and much of the Achil\r\nturf is equal to coal. The sea is in front of them, and all round\r\nthem, and the lakes are full of fish. And yet the hat is sent round\r\nevery other year.\r\n\r\n\"They used to pay their debts. Now they will pay nothing, and their\r\naudacity is something wonderful. A gentleman over there has bought\r\nsome land, and the people turn their cattle on it to graze. He\r\nremonstrates, and they say, 'What business have you here? Keep in your\r\nown country.' He sued them for damages. They had nothing but the\r\ncattle aforesaid, and, as he could not find heart to seize, he had no\r\nremedy. They keep their cattle on his land, although he has, since\r\nthen, processed them for trespass. They have already divided the\r\nspoils of the Protestants; that is, in theory. They are anticipating\r\nthe Home Rule Bill in their disposal of the land. They have marked out\r\nthe patches they will severally claim, and are already disputing the\r\nfuture possession of certain desirable fields.\r\n\r\n\"English Gladstonians ridicule the fears of Irish Protestants, who\r\ndeclare unanimously their conviction that Home Rule means oppression.\r\nThis ridicule is absurd in face of the fact that every Protestant\r\nsect, without exception, has publicly and formally announced its\r\nadherence to this opinion. The Church of Ireland believes in Catholic\r\nintolerance; the Methodists believe it; the Baptists believe it; the\r\nPlymouth Brethren believe it; the Presbyterians believe it; the\r\nUnitarians, the most radical of all the sects, believe it; the\r\nQuakers, who never before made a public deliverance of opinion in any\r\npolitical matter, believe it; and all these have issued printed\r\ndeclarations of their belief. The Roman Catholic laity, the best of\r\nthem, believe it; but the Catholic Bishops say No, they will not admit\r\nthe soft impeachment. And Englishmen who are Gladstonians believe\r\nthese Bishops in preference to all the sects I have enumerated. Could\r\nanything be more unreasonable? But it is of a piece with the whole\r\nconception of the bill, which seems to contain every possible\r\nabsurdity, and is based on extravagant assumptions of amity on the\r\npart of Irish Catholics, of which there is not one particle of\r\nevidence in existence. All the evidence points the other way, and\r\nIrish Protestants know that under Home Rule their fate is sealed.\r\nThere would be no open persecution, but we should be gently elbowed\r\nout of the country. All who could leave Ireland would do so at once,\r\nand England would lose her most powerful allies in the enemy's camp.\r\nFor it is the enemy's camp, and this fact should be borne in mind. Mr.\r\nGladstone and his followers would be horrified to hear such a\r\nstatement, which they would regard as rank blasphemy. But every\r\nIrishman knows it, and every Englishman knows it who lives here long\r\nenough to know anything. Irish Nationalists have two leading ideas--to\r\nget as much out of England as possible, and to damage her as much as\r\npossible by way of repayment. Mr. Gladstone wants to put England's\r\nhead on the block, to hand an axe to her sworn enemy, and to say, 'I'm\r\nsure you won't chop.' People who have common sense stand amazed,\r\ndumbfounded at so much stupidity.\"\r\n\r\nA pious Catholic bore out the statements of my first Achil friend with\r\nreference to the comparative comfort of the Islanders. He said:--\"We\r\nlive mostly on bread and tea. Of course we have plenty of butter and\r\neggs, and now and then we go out and get some fish. I had a go at a\r\nfive-pound white trout to-day, with plenty of butter and potatoes. At\r\nDugort people who live in cabins have money in the bank, aye, some of\r\nthem have several hundred pounds. And yet they took the seed potatoes\r\nsent by England. Well, they wanted a change of seed, and they must do\r\nthe same as their neighbours. It would not do to pretend to be any\r\nbetter off than the rest. They are compelled to do as the majority do\r\nin everything, or they would be boycotted at once. They cease work\r\nwhen a death occurs in the parish. If an infant three days old should\r\ngive up the ghost, every man shoulders his spade and leaves the field.\r\nAnd he does not return till after the funeral. If another death\r\noccurred on the funeral day, he would leave off again, and so on. No\r\nmatter how urgent the state of the crop, he must leave it to its fate,\r\nor leave the country, for no one would know a person who would work\r\nwhile a corpse lay in the parish. They would look upon him as an\r\ninfidel, and, if possible, worse than a Protestant. Luckily we don't\r\noften die hereabouts, or we'd never get the praties set or the turf\r\ncut. Sometimes they won't go to work because someone is expected to\r\ndie, and they say it isn't worth while to begin. I have known a\r\nlingering case to throw the crops back a fortnight or more. Oh, they\r\ndon't grumble; any excuse for laziness is warmly welcomed. They\r\ncomplain when people die at inconvenient times, and will say the act\r\nmight have been delayed till a more convenient season, or might have\r\nbeen done a little earlier. The whole population turn out for the\r\nfuneral, but they don't dig the grave until the procession reaches the\r\ngraveyard. Then the mourners sit around smoking, both men and women,\r\nwhile a couple of young chaps make a shallow hole, and cover the\r\ncoffin with four to six inches of earth. No, it is not severely\r\nsanitary, but we are not too particular in Achil.\"\r\n\r\nThese unsophisticated islanders are decidedly interesting. Their\r\ncustoms, politics, manners, morals, odours seem to be strongly\r\nmarked--to have character, originality, individuality. I fear they are\r\nmostly Home Rulers, for in Ireland Home Rule and strong smells nearly\r\nalways go together.\r\n\r\nAchil Sound, June 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 38.--THE ACHIL ISLANDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDugort, the capital city of Achil, is twelve miles from the Sound, a\r\nterrible drive in winter, when the Atlantic storms blow with such\r\nviolence as to stop a horse and cart, and to render pedestrianism\r\nwell-nigh impossible; but pleasant enough in fine weather,\r\nnotwithstanding the seemingly interminable wastes of bog and rocky\r\nmountain, dotted at infrequent intervals with white cottages, single\r\nor in small clusters of three or four. After Major Pike's plantations,\r\nnear the Sound, not a tree is visible all the way to Dugort, although\r\nat some points you can see for ten miles or more. Here and there where\r\nthe turf has been cut away for fuel, great gnarled roots of oak and\r\nfir trees are visible, bleached by exposure to a ghastly white,\r\nshowing against the jetty soil like the bones of extinct giants, which\r\nindeed they are. The inhabitants say that the island was once covered\r\nby a great forest, which perished by fire, and Misther Patrick Toolis,\r\nwith that love of fine words which marks the Irish peasant, said that\r\nthe charred interior of the scattered remains proves that the trees\r\nwere \"desthroyed intirely by a grate confiscation.\" The heather, of\r\ntwo kinds, is brilliantly purple, and the Royal fern grows everywhere\r\nin profusion, its terra-cotta bloom often towering six feet high. The\r\nmountains are effectively arranged, and imposing by their massiveness,\r\nheight, and rugged grandeur. Some of the roads are tolerable, those\r\nmade by Mr. Balfour being by far the best. Others are execrable and\r\ndangerous in the extreme, and in winter must be almost impassable.\r\nSometimes they run along a narrow ridge which in its normal condition\r\nwas of barely sufficient width to carry the car, and it often happens\r\nthat part of this has fallen away, so that the gap must be passed by\r\nleading the horse while the car scrapes along with one wheel on the\r\ntop and one clinging to the side of the abyss. The natives make light\r\nof such small inconveniences, and for the most part ride on horseback\r\nwith saddles and crupper-bands of plaited rye-straw. Every householder\r\nhas a horse or an ass, mostly a horse, and young girls career adown\r\nthe mountain sides in what seems the maddest, most reckless way,\r\nguiding their half-broken, mustard-coloured steeds with a single rein\r\nof plaited straw, adjusted in an artful way which is beyond me to\r\ndescribe. Very quaint they look, on their yellow horses, which remind\r\nyou of D'Artagnan's orange-coloured charger, immortalised by Dumas in\r\nthe \"Three Musketeers;\" their red robes floating in the breeze, their\r\nbare feet hanging over the horse's right flank. When they fall off\r\nthey simply get on again. They seldom or never are hurt. They are hard\r\nas nails and lissom as cats. Dr. Croly, of Dugort, saw a girl thrown\r\nheels over head, turning a complete somersault from the horse's back.\r\nShe alighted on her feet, grabbed the rein, bounded up again, and\r\ngaily galloped away. During my hundred miles riding and walking over\r\nthe island I saw many riderless horses, fully accoutred in the Achil\r\nstyle, plodding patiently along the moorland roads, climbing the steep\r\nmountain paths. At first I thought an accident had occurred, and spent\r\nsome time in looking for the corpse. There was no occasion for fear.\r\nThe Achil harvesters going to England and Scotland ride over to the\r\nSound, where lie the fishing smacks which bear them to Westport, and\r\nthen turn their horses loose. The faithful beasts go home, however\r\nlong or devious the road, sometimes alone, sometimes in company, only\r\nstaying a moment at the parting of the ways to bid each other\r\ngood-bye, then going forward at a brisker pace to make up for lost\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe hamlet of Cashel, not to be confused with Cashel of the Rock, is\r\nthe first sign of life after leaving the Sound. A ravine, with white\r\ncabins, green crops, and huge boulders, on one of which seven small\r\nchildren were sitting in a row, unwashed, unkempt, with little calico\r\nand no leather. Bunnacurragh has a post-office run by a pensioner who\r\ngrows roses, and keeps his place like a picture, the straw ropes which\r\nsecure the thatch against the western gales taut and trig, each loose\r\nend terminated by a loop holding a large stone. The stones are used in\r\nplace of pegs, and very queer they look dangling all round over the\r\neaves. Not far from here is an immense basin-like depression of dry\r\nbog. Then a monastery, in the precincts of which the ground is\r\nreclaimed and admirably tilled, the drainage being carried over\r\ningenious turf conduits, the soil lacking firmness to hold stone or\r\nbrick. The vast bulk of Slievemore soon looms full in front, and after\r\na long stretch of smooth Balfour road and a sharp turn on the edge of\r\na deep ravine on the right with a high ridge beyond it, the Great\r\nmountain on the left, Dugort, with Blacksod Bay, heaves in sight. A\r\nfinal spurt up the hilly road and the weary, jolted traveller, or what\r\nis left of him, may (metaphorically) fall into the arms of Mr. Robert\r\nSheridan, of the Sea View Hotel, or of Mrs. Sheridan, if he likes it\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThere are two Dugorts, or one Dugort divided against itself. The line\r\nof demarcation is sharp and decided. The two sections stand but a\r\nshort distance apart, each on an opposite horn of the little bay, but\r\nthe moral distance is great enough for forty thousand leagues. The\r\nDugort under Slievemore is Protestant, the Dugort of the opposite\r\ncliff is intensely Roman Catholic. The one is the perfection of\r\nneatness, sweetness, cleanliness, prettiness, and order. The other is\r\ndirty, frowsy, disorderly, and of evil odour. The Papists deny the\r\nright of the Protestants to be in the island at all, speak of them\r\nwith acerbity, call them the Colonists, the perverts, the Soupers, the\r\nJumpers, the heretics; and look forward to the time when a Dublin\r\nParliament will banish law and order, so that these interlopers may be\r\nfor ever swept away, and their fields and houses become the property\r\nof the Faithful. They complain that the Protestants have all the best\r\nland, and that the Papist population were wrongfully driven from the\r\nground now occupied by the colony. Like other Catholic poor all over\r\nIreland they will tell you that they have been ground down, harried,\r\noppressed, grievously ill-used, habitually ill-treated by the English\r\nGovernment, which has never given them a chance. They explain the\r\nprosperity of their Protestant neighbours by knowing winks and nods,\r\nand by plain intimations that all Irish Protestants are secretly\r\nsubsidised by England, that they have privileges, that they are\r\nfavoured, petted, kept in pocket money. To affect to doubt this is to\r\nprove yourself a dissembler, an impostor, a black-hearted enemy of the\r\npeople. Your Achil friend will drop the conversation in disgust, and\r\nby round-about ways will call you a liar. He is sure of his facts, as\r\nsure as he is that a sprinkling of holy water will cure rheumatism,\r\nwill keep away the fairies from the cow, will put a fine edge on his\r\nrazor, will keep the donkey from being bewitched. He knows who has had\r\nmoney and how much, having reasoned out the matter by inference. He\r\ncould sell himself to-morrow, but is incorruptible, and will remain a\r\nstrong rock to the faith, will still buttress up the true hierarchy of\r\nheaven. He cannot be bought, and this is strange, for he never looks\r\nworth twopence.\r\n\r\nIt was during a famine that one Mr. Nangle, a Protestant parson from\r\nthe North, went to Achil and found the people in deepest distress.\r\nThey were dying of starvation, and their priests had all fled. Mr.\r\nNangle had no money, but he was prompt in action. He sent a thousand\r\npounds' worth of meal to the island on his own responsibility, and\r\nweighed down by a sense of the debt he had incurred, went to London to\r\nbeg the money. He was successful, and afterwards founded the Achil\r\nmission at Dugort, now called the Colony. Needless to say that all the\r\nland belonging to the mission was duly bought and paid for, and that\r\nthe Protestants have been the benefactors of Achil. The stories of\r\nwrong-doing, robbery, and spoliation, which the peasantry repeat, are\r\nof course totally untrue. The example of a decently-housed community\r\nhas produced no perceptible effect on the habits of the Achilese. The\r\nvillages of Cabawn, Avon (also known by its Anglicised name of River),\r\nBallyknock, Slievemore, and Ducanella are dirty beyond description.\r\nSome of the houses I saw in a drive which included the coastguard\r\nstation of Bull's Mouth were mere heaps of stones, with turf sods for\r\ntiles, whereon was growing long grass which looked like a small\r\ninstalment of the three acres and a cow. Some had no windows and no\r\nchimney, the turf reek filling the hovel, but partly escaping by a\r\nhole in the roof. The people who live in this look as it painted in\r\number by old Dutch masters. These huts are small, but there is always\r\nroom for a pig or two, which stalk about or stretch themselves before\r\nthe fire like privileged members of the family. This was very well for\r\nthe Gintleman that paid the Rint. But he merits the title no longer.\r\nHis occupation's gone.\r\n\r\nA sturdy Protestant said:--\"Suppose Home Rule became law, then we must\r\ngo away. We are only here on sufferance, and every person in the\r\nColony knows it and feels it only too well. Our lives would not be\r\nendangered: those times are over, but we could not possibly stay in\r\nthe island. Remove the direct support of England, and we should be\r\nsubject to insult and wrong, for which we should have no earthly\r\nremedy. What could they do? Why, to begin with, they could pasture\r\ntheir cattle on our fields. If we turned them out they could be turned\r\nin again; if we sue them we have a day's journey to take to get the\r\ncause heard, and if we get the verdict we can recover nothing. Shoot a\r\ncow or two! Then we should ourselves be shot, or our children. No,\r\nthere has been no landlord-shooting on the island. This kind of large\r\ngame has always been very scarce on Achil. Just over the Sound we had\r\na little sport--a really merry little turn it was--but the wrong man\r\nwas shot.\r\n\r\n\"A Mr. Smith came down to collect rents. The Land League was ruling\r\nthe country, and its desperadoes were everywhere. It was decided to\r\nshoot Mr. Smith, after duly warning him to keep away. Smith was not to\r\nbe deterred from what he thought his duty (he was a Black Protestant),\r\nand away he went, with his son, a neat strip of a lad about seventeen\r\nor so. When they got half-way to the house which Smith had appointed\r\nas a meeting-place a man in the bog which bordered the road called\r\nout, and waved a paper, which he then placed on a heap of turf. Young\r\nSmith went for it, and it read. YOU'LL NOT GO HOME ALIVE THIS NIGHT.\r\n'Drive on, Tom,' said the father. 'We'll do our work, whether we go\r\nhome alive or dead.' Coming back the same evening the father was\r\ndriving, the son, this young lad, sitting at the side of the car,\r\nwhich was furnished with a couple of repeating rifles and a revolver.\r\nSuddenly three men spring up from behind a fence and fire a volley at\r\nthe two Smiths, but as they rose the horse shied and plunged forward,\r\nand hang me! if they didn't all miss. The elder Smith still struggled\r\nwith the frightened horse, which the shooting had made ungovernable,\r\nbut the boy slipped off the car, and, seizing one of the rifles,\r\nlooked out for a shot in return. It was growing dusk, and the bog was\r\nfull of trenches and ups and downs, of which the three fugitives\r\ncleverly availed themselves. Besides, to be shot at from a point-blank\r\nrange of three or four yards, scrambling down afterwards from behind a\r\nfrantic horse, is not the best Wimbledon method of steadying the\r\nnerves. The boy put the rifle to his shoulder, and bided his time.\r\nPresently up came one of the running heroes, and young Smith shot him\r\nthrough the heart, as neat a kill as ever you saw. The dead man was\r\nidentified as a militiaman from Crossmolina, up Sligo way. The League\r\nalways brought its marksmen from a distance, and it is known that most\r\nof them were persons who had received some military training. Then the\r\nyoungster covered another, but missed, and was about to fire again when\r\nhis father shouted, 'Hold hard, Tom, that's enough sport for one day.'\"\r\n\r\nMy friend was wrong. The second shot lacerated the man's shoulder, and\r\nlaid him up for many a long week. I had the fact, which is now first\r\nrecorded, on _undoubted authority_. Young Smith may be gratified to\r\nlearn, for the first time, that his second bullet was not altogether\r\nthrown away. This may console him for the loss of the third reprobate,\r\nwhom he had got \"exactly between the shoulders,\" when the elder Smith\r\nordered him to desist. The occurrence was such a lesson to the Land\r\nLeague assassins that they for ever after forswore Achil and its\r\nimmediate surroundings. As Dennis Mulcahy remarked, \"The ruffians only\r\nwant shtandin' up to, an' they'll not come nixt or near ye.\" Mr.\r\nMorley would do well to apply this moral to the County Clare.\r\n\r\nThe best authority in Achil said:--\"The hat is always going round for\r\nthe islanders, who are much better off than the poor of great English\r\ncities. They have the reputation of being in a state of chronic\r\nfamine. This has no foundation in fact. They all have land, one, two,\r\nor three cows, and the sea to draw upon. For their land and houses\r\nthey pay nothing, or next to nothing; for good land in some cases is\r\nto be had for a shilling an acre. The lakes also abound with fish.\r\nThey glory in their poverty, and hail a partial failure of crops with\r\ndelight. They know they will be cared for, and that provisions will be\r\nshowered upon them from all sides. They say, 'Please God, we'll have a\r\nfamine this year,' and when the contributions pour in they laugh and\r\nsing, and say, 'The distress for ever! Long live the famine!' The word\r\ngoes round at stated intervals that they are to 'have a famine.' They\r\njump at the suggestion, act well together, and carry out the idea\r\nperfectly. The Protestants never have any distress which calls for\r\ncharitable aid. They live on the same soil, under the same laws, but\r\nthey never beg. They pay their rents, too, much more regularly than\r\nthe others, who of late years can hardly be got to pay either rent or\r\nanything else. The Protestants are all strong Unionists. The Catholics\r\nare all strong Home Rulers. Their notions of Home Rule are as\r\nfollows:--No rent, no police, a poteen still at every door, and\r\npossession of the land now held by Protestants, which is so much\r\nbetter than their own because so much more labour has been expended on\r\nit, and for no other reason. Who tells them to 'have a famine'? Why,\r\nthe same people who arouse and keep alive their enmity to the\r\nProtestants; the same people who tell them lies about the early\r\nhistory of the Colony--lies which the tellers know to be lies, such as\r\nthe stories of oppression, spoliation, and of how the mission took the\r\nproperty of the islanders with the strong hand, aided by England, the\r\nhome of robbery, tyranny, and heresy. The people would be friendly\r\nenough but for their priests. Yet they have marched in procession\r\nbefore our houses, blowing defiance by means of a drum and fife band,\r\nbecause we would not join one or other of their dishonest and illegal\r\ncombinations. They opened a man's head with a stone, producing a\r\ndreadful scalp wound, and when Doctor Croly, the greatest favourite in\r\nthe whole island, went to dress the wound, five or six of them stopped\r\nhis horse, with the object of giving him a 'bating,' which would have\r\nended nobody knows how. The doctor produced a revolver, and the heroes\r\nvanished like smoke.\"\r\n\r\nThe good doctor is himself a Unionist, but more of a philanthropist\r\nthan a politician. He is the parish doctor, with eight thousand people\r\nto look after, the whole being scattered over an immense area. I\r\naccompanied him on a twenty-mile drive to see a girl down with\r\ninfluenza, much of the road being almost impracticable. Some of his\r\nexperiences, coming out incidentally, were strange and startling. He\r\ntold me of a night when the storm was so wild that a man seeking him\r\napproached the surgery on all-fours, and once housed, would not again\r\nstir out, though the patient was his own wife. The doctor went alone\r\nand in the storm and blackness narrowly escaped drowning, emerging\r\nfrom the Jawun, usually called the Jordan, after an hour's struggle\r\nwith the flood, to sit up all night in his wet clothes, tending the\r\npatient. On another occasion a mountain sheep frightened his horse\r\njust as the doctor was filling his pipe. The next passer-by found him\r\ninsensible. Nobody might have passed for a month. A similar\r\nmisadventure resulted in a broken leg. Then on a pitchy night he\r\nwalked over the cliffs, and was caught near the brink by two rocks\r\nwhich held him wedged tightly until someone found him and pulled him\r\nup, with the bag of instruments, which he thinks had saved him. And it\r\nwas as well to pause in his flight, for the Menawn Cliffs, with their\r\nthousand feet of clean drop, might have given the doctor an ugly fall.\r\nTwo girls, whose male relations had gone to England, had not been seen\r\nfor three days. Nobody would go near the house. The doctor found them\r\nboth on the floor insensible, down with typhus fever, shut up with the\r\npigs and cows, the room and its odour defying description. The\r\nneighbours kept strictly aloof. Dr. Croly swept and garnished, made\r\nfires, and pulled the patients through. \"Sure, you couldn't expect us\r\nto go near whin 'twas the faver,\" said the neighbourly Achilese. Mr.\r\nSalt, the Brum-born mission agent, was obliged to remain all night on\r\none of the neighbouring islands--islands are a drug hereabouts--and\r\nnext morning he found an egg in his hat. Fowls are in nearly all the\r\nhouses. Sometimes they have a roost on the ceiling, but they mostly\r\nperch on the family bed, when that full-flavoured Elysium is not on\r\nthe floor. I saw an interior which contained one black cow, one black\r\ncalf, some hens, some ducks, two black-and-white pigs, a mother, and\r\neleven children. Where they all slept was a puzzle, as only one bed\r\nwas visible. The hens went whir-r-r-up, and perched on the bedstead,\r\nwhen the lady smiled and wished me Good Evening. She looked strong and\r\nin good going order. The Achilese say Good Evening all day long. A\r\nyoung girl was grinning in the next doorway, a child of fourteen or\r\nfifteen she seemed. \"Ye wouldn't think that was a married woman, would\r\nye now,\" said a neighbour, with pardonable pride. \"Aye, but she is,\r\nthough, an' a foin lump iv a son ye have, haven't ye, Maureen.\" Mr.\r\nPeter Griffin, once a land commissioner, told me that a boy having\r\napplied for the fixing of a judicial rent, the commissioners expressed\r\ntheir surprise upon learning that he was married. \"Arrah, now,\" said\r\nthe applicant, \"sure 'tis not for the sake of the bit that the crathur\r\nwould ate that a boy need be widout one o' thim!\"\r\n\r\nIn Achil, as elsewhere, the better people are certain that the Home\r\nRule Bill will never become law. From their point of view, the thing\r\nseems too absurd to be possible. They are face to face with a class of\r\nIrishmen, among whom civilisation seems to have made no perceptible\r\nprogress for centuries, who scorn every improvement, and are so tied\r\nand bound down by aboriginal ignorance and superstition as to be\r\ninsensible to everything but their ancient prejudices. It cannot be\r\npossible, they argue, that Ireland should be given over to the\r\ndominion of these people, who, after all, are in the matter of\r\nadvancement and enlightenment fairly representative of the bulk of the\r\nvoters for Home Rule all over the country. The civilised community of\r\nAchil are unable to realise the possibility of such a surrender. They\r\ndo not discuss the measure, but rather laugh at it. An able business\r\nman said:--\r\n\r\n\"We get the daily papers a little old, no doubt, but we follow them\r\nvery closely, and we concur in believing that Mr. Gladstone will in\r\nthe long run drop the bill. We think he will turn round and say,\r\n'There now. That's all I can do. Haven't I done my best? Haven't I\r\nkept my promise? Now, you can't blame me. The Irishmen see it coming,\r\nand they will get out of it as much dramatic effect as possible. The\r\nparty organs are already urging them to open rupture with the\r\nGovernment. Compulsion is their game, and no doubt, with Gladstone, it\r\nis the most likely game to pay. But he might rebel. He might grow\r\ntired of eating Irish dirt; he might pluck up spirit enough to tell\r\nthese bullies who are jockeying him, and through him the British\r\nEmpire, to go to the Divil. Then we'd have a fine flare-up. Virtuous\r\nindignation and patriotic virtue to the fore! The Irish members will\r\nrush over to Ireland, and great demonstrations will be the order of\r\nthe day. The Irish love demonstrations, or indeed anything else which\r\ngives a further excuse for laziness. The priests will orate, the\r\nmembers will prate, the ruffians elate will shoot or otherwise murder\r\na few people, who will have Mr. Gladstone to thank for their death.\r\nFor what we wanted was twenty years of resolute government, just as\r\nLord Salisbury said, and if Mr. Balfour had been left to carry it out\r\nIreland would have come her nearest possible to prosperity and\r\ncontentment. But with steady rule one day, and vacillation, wobbling,\r\nand surrender the next, what can you expect? The Irish are very smart,\r\ncute people, and they soon know where they can take advantage of\r\nweakness. The way these poor Achil folks, those who have been to\r\nEngland, can reckon up Mr. Gladstone! They call him a traitor now. And\r\nyet he promises to let the Irish members arrange their own finance!\r\n'Here, my boys,' says he, 'take five millions and spend it your own\r\nway.' Will John Bull stand that? Will he pay for the rope that is to\r\nhang himself? Will he buy the razor to cut his own throat? Where are\r\nhis wits? Why does he stand by to witness this unending farce, when he\r\nought to be minding serious business? This Irish idiocy is stopping\r\nthe progress of the Empire. Why does not Bull put his foot on it at\r\nonce? He must do so in the end. Where are the working men of England?\r\nSurely they know enough to perceive that their own personal interests\r\nare involved.\r\n\r\n\"In Achil we have practically peasant proprietary and nothing else.\r\nEleven hundred men and women are at this moment in England and\r\nScotland from Achil alone. They will return in October, each bringing\r\nback ten, fifteen, or twenty pounds, on which they will live till next\r\nseason. The Irish Legislature would begin by establishing peasant\r\nproprietary all over Ireland. The large farmers would disappear, and\r\nmen without capital, unable to employ labour, would take their place.\r\nInstead of Mayo, you would have the unemployed of the whole thirty-two\r\ncounties upon you. Ireland would be pauperised from end to end, for\r\neverybody who could leave it would do so--that is, every person of\r\nmeans--and as for capital and enterprise, what little we have would\r\nleave us. Which of the Irish Nationalist party would start factories,\r\nand what would they make? Can anybody tell me that?\"\r\n\r\nI submitted that Mr. William O'Brien, the member for Cork, might open\r\na concern for the making of breeches, or that Mr. Timothy Healy, the\r\nmember for Louth, who was reared in a tripe shop, might embark his\r\nuntold gold in the cowheel and trotter business, or might even prove a\r\nkeen competitor with Walsall in the manufacture of horsewhips, a\r\nproduct of industry of which he has had an altogether exceptional\r\nexperience. \"Is not this true?\" I enquired.\r\n\r\nMy friend admitted the fact, but declined to believe in the factory.\r\n\r\nDugort (Achil Island), June 22nd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 39.--IRISH UNFITNESS FOR SELF-GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere stands a city neither large nor small, Its air and situation\r\nsweet and pretty. It matters very little if at all. Whether its\r\ndenizens are dull or witty. Whether the ladies there are short or\r\ntall, Brunettes or blondes--only there stands a city. Perhaps 'tis\r\nalso requisite to minute, That there's a castle and a cobbler in it.\r\nIt is not big enough to boast a barber. These indispensable adjuncts\r\nof civilisation exist in Connaught, but only at rare intervals.\r\nRoughly speaking, there is a space of about a hundred miles between\r\nthem. From Athlone to Dugort, a hundred and thirty miles, there is\r\nonly one, both towns inclusive. Castlereagh is a deadly-lively place\r\nfor business, but keenly awake to politics. The distressful science\r\nabsorbs the faculties of the people, who care for little else. Like\r\nall the Keltic Irish, they are great talkers, and, surely, if talking\r\nwere working the Irish would be the richest nation in the world.\r\n\"Words, words, words,\" and no deeds. The Castlereagh folks are growing\r\ndespondent. The Irish Parliament that was to remit taxation, present\r\nevery able-bodied man with a farm, do away with landlords and police,\r\nand reduce the necessity for work to a minimum, seems to them further\r\noff than ever. They complain that once again the people of Ireland\r\nhave been betrayed. Mr. Gladstone has done it all. To be sure they\r\nnever trusted him, but they thought him an instrument in the hands of\r\nFate and the Irish Parliamentary party. Spite of all he is supposed to\r\nhave done for the Irish, Mr. Gladstone is not popular in Ireland, and,\r\nas I pointed out months ago, they from the first declined to believe\r\nin his sincerity. They rightly regarded his action anent Home Rule as\r\nthe result of compulsion, and, rightly or wrongly, believed that he\r\nwould take the first opportunity of throwing over the whole scheme.\r\nThat he should act thus treacherously (they say) is precisely what\r\nmight be expected from an impartial review of his whole career, which\r\npresents an unequalled record of in-and-out running--consistent only\r\nin its inconsistency. Having apparently ridden straight for awhile, it\r\nis now time to expect some \"pulling.\" His shameful concessions to the\r\nUnionist party may be taken as a clear indication of his congenital\r\ncrookedness, and the refusal of the Nationalists at Killybegs, on the\r\nvisit of Lord Houghton, the other day, to give a single shout for the\r\nGrand Old Man, bears out my previous statement as to the popular\r\nfeeling. Amid the carefully organised show of enthusiasm and mock\r\nloyalty which greeted the visit of the Viceroy, not a cheer could be\r\nraised for Mr. Gladstone. The local wirepullers did their best, but\r\nthe priests who for weeks have been arranging their automata, at the\r\nlast moment found that the dummies would not work. There were rounds\r\nof cheering for this, that, and the other, and when the mob were in\r\nfull cry, someone shouted, \"Three cheers for Mr. Gladstone.\" Dead\r\nsilence. The Gladstonian Viceroy and his following were left high and\r\ndry. The flood of enthusiasm instantly receded, and the beating of\r\ntheir own hearts was the only sound they heard. Mr. Morley's name\r\nwould have obtained a like reception. The people were doubtless\r\nwilling to obey their leaders, and to make some slight sacrifice to\r\nexpediency, but every man left that particular cheer to his neighbour.\r\nHence the fiasco for which the people have already been severely\r\nreprimanded. Someone should have called for cheers for Balfour. Anyone\r\nwho knows the West of Ireland knows there would have been an outburst\r\nof hurrahs, hearty and spontaneous. The Irish are delightfully\r\nillogical.\r\n\r\nA respectable old Fenian had a poor opinion of the present Home Rule\r\nagitation. He said:--\"I am of the school of Stephens and Mitchel. When\r\na people or nation is radically discontented with its rulers it should\r\nthrow them off by force. If the Irish could hold together long enough\r\nto maintain an armed insurrection for two weeks only, help would be\r\nforthcoming from all quarters. When a young man I cherished the hope\r\nthat this would be accomplished, but I have long abandoned the notion\r\nthat anything of the kind will be possible in my time. For individual\r\nEnglishmen I have as much friendship as anybody, not being himself an\r\nEnglishman, can entertain. What I dislike is English rule, and the\r\npresent movement does not interest me, because its leaders profess\r\nallegiance--for the present, anyhow. No doubt the general idea is to\r\nobtain as much advantage as possible, and to gradually increase the\r\nstrength of Ireland; but, in my opinion, the Fenian movement was the\r\ntrue and legitimate method, and the one best suited to the genius of\r\nthe Irish nation. Notwithstanding all that has been said and written\r\nby English speakers and writers, the movement was worthy of honour,\r\nand had it been successful, would have received high praise and\r\ncommendation from every country except England. To be respectable,\r\nrevolutions or insurrections must be successful, or at any rate, must\r\nhave a certain amount of success to commence with. The English people\r\nnever properly understood the Fenian movement. To begin with, the name\r\nof Fenians was not assumed by the Irish body of conspirators. The\r\nFenians proper were entirely confined to America, where they acted\r\nunder the instructions of John O'Mahony, with Michael and Colonel\r\nCorcoran as lieutenants. The Colonel commanded the Irish brigade of\r\nthe American army, and was pledged to bring over a strong contingent\r\nat the right moment. The Irish party in Ireland under Stephens was\r\ncalled the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood, to which I am proud to say\r\nI belonged. That is all over now, and I am content to be loyal, under\r\ncompulsion. There is nothing else for it. The young men are all gone\r\nto America, and the failure of the enterprise has damaged the prestige\r\nof the cause. The organisation was very good, and you might say that\r\nthe able-bodied population belonged to it, almost to a man. England\r\nnever knew, does not know even now, how universal was the movement.\r\nThe escape of James Stephens, the great Number One, from Richmond\r\nBridewell, was something of an eye-opener, but not half so astonishing\r\nas some things that would have happened if the general movement had\r\nbeen successful. It was Daniel Byrne and James Breslin, who let him\r\nout. Byrne was a turnkey, Breslin was hospital superintendent, and\r\nboth held their posts on account of their well-known loyalty. Byrne\r\nwas found out, or rather it was discovered that he was a Fenian, but\r\nthey could not prove his guilt in the Stephens affair, and he never\r\nrounded on Breslin, who went on drawing his screw from the British\r\nGovernment for many a long day, until he took a trip to America, where\r\nhis services to the cause landed him in a good situation. So he stayed\r\nthere, and told everything, and that was the first the British\r\nGovernment knew about it, beyond suspicion of Byrne.\r\n\r\n\"If Stephens had made up his mind for an outbreak the funeral of\r\nMacManus was the right occasion. He missed his tip then, and no\r\nmistake. There never was another chance like that. He said the\r\narrangements were not complete, and from that moment the thing\r\ndwindled away, and we who were working it up in the rural districts\r\nbegan to think he did not really mean business. We were short of arms,\r\nbut a small success would have improved our condition in that respect.\r\nLots of the country organisers went to Dublin to see his funeral, and\r\nwhen we saw the crowds and the enthusiasm we all agreed that such a\r\nchance was not likely to occur again. MacManus had been a chief of the\r\ninsurrectionary movement of 1848, and had been transported for life to\r\nBotany Bay, I think. He escaped to America, and died there in 1861.\r\nMahony, the Fenian commander-in-chief, proposed to spend some of the\r\nrevolutionary funds in bringing the body to Ireland, there to give it\r\na public funeral. This was a great idea, and as the Government did not\r\ninterfere, it turned out a greater success than anyone had\r\nanticipated. There were delegates from every city in America, and from\r\nevery town in Ireland. It took about a month to lug MacManus from the\r\nFar West to Dublin, and the excitement increased every day. In my\r\nlittle place we collared all the timid fellows who had been holding\r\nback before, until there was not a single man of the peasant class\r\noutside the circle. MacManus was worth more dead than alive.\r\n\r\n\"A hundred thousand men followed the hearse through the streets of\r\nDublin. At the critical moment Number One held back. If the streets\r\nhad been barricaded on the evening of the funeral the country would\r\nhave stood an excellent chance of obtaining its independence. The\r\nmoment was missed, and such chances never come twice. The French would\r\nhave made a big thing of that affair. Stephens was great at\r\norganisation, but he had not the pluck to carry out the enterprise. He\r\nhad not the military training required, nor the decision to act at the\r\nright moment. So here we are and here we shall remain, and I am your\r\nhumble, obedient, loyal servant to command.\r\n\r\n\"No, I do _not_ believe in the present leaders at all. I think they\r\nwant to be paid big salaries as Irish statesmen, and that they are\r\nunfit to clean the boots of the men with whom I acted thirty years\r\nago. The Fenians, or rather the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood, had\r\nno wish to make money by their patriotism, and what is more, they were\r\nready to risk their skins, whenever called upon to do so. They were\r\nwilling to fight. These chaps do nothing but spout. The I.R.B. agreed\r\namong themselves, and obeyed orders. These fellows can't agree for\r\nfive minutes together, and their principal subject of quarrel is--Who\r\nshall be master? Gladstone is fooling them now, and good enough for\r\nthem. A pretty set of men to attempt to govern a country! They don't\r\nknow what they want. We did. We swore every man to obedience to the\r\nIrish Republic. That was straightforward enough. The young 'uns round\r\nhere have the same aspirations, but they dislike the idea of fighting.\r\nThey expect to get round it some other way.\r\n\r\n\"John Kennedy, of Westport, damaged the cause in Mayo more than any\r\nman in Ireland. He was a young fellow of about five-and-twenty, only a\r\nfew years in the constabulary, but somehow he got into sworn meetings\r\nin disguise, and burst the whole thing up. The queerest feature about\r\nthis business is the fact that although everybody knew the man not a\r\nshot was ever fired at him. That shows the fairness of the Fenians. A\r\nmember of the Brotherhood would have been promptly dealt with, you\r\nbet. But Kennedy was an open enemy, and had a right to circumvent us\r\nif he could. Give us credit for some chivalrous feeling. We certainly\r\ndeserved it, as this case amply proves.\r\n\r\n\"The Land League? The Ruffian League, the Burglar League, the\r\nPickpocket League, the Murder League--that's what I always called it.\r\nA hole-and-corner way of carrying on the fight, which had been begun\r\nby MEN, but which the latest fashion of Irishmen have not the courage\r\nto canduct as men. The Fenian conception was high-souled, and had some\r\nromance about it. We had a green flag with a rising sun on it, along\r\nwith the harp of Erin. Our idea was an open fight against the British\r\nEmpire. There's as much difference between the Fenians and their\r\nsuccessors as between the ancient Romans and the Italian organ-grinders\r\nwith monkeys. Good morning, Sir, and--God save the Queen.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a jocosity if not a mockery, but it was the first time I had\r\nheard the words in Ireland. The tune is almost unknown, and the\r\ncurrent issue of _United Ireland_ ridicules the notion that the Irish\r\nare going to learn it. The band of the Royal Irish Constabulary,\r\nplaying in front of their barracks in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, on\r\nFriday evenings, sometimes include the tune in their programme, but\r\nwhen I heard them it was led up to and preceded by \"St. Patrick's Day\r\nin the Mornin',\" to which it was conjoined by one intervening chord. A\r\nCastlereagh Protestant said:--\r\n\r\n\"The children here are taught to curse the Queen in their cradles.\r\nDon't know how it is, but hatred to England seems bred in the bone of\r\nthe Catholic Irish. They make no secret of their hopes of vengeance.\r\nThe Protestants will have to levant in double-quick time. The people\r\nhere hate Protestants, whether English or Irish, likewise anybody who\r\nholds a Government appointment. Some few days ago I was at Westport,\r\nand while in the post office there, a beggar asked Mr. Hildebrand for\r\nalms. You know that every western town swarms with beggars. He said\r\nNo, and this tramp immediately turned round and said:--\r\n\r\n\"'We'll very soon have ye out o' that, _now_.'\r\n\r\n\"A relative of mine, who holds a sub-office, has been told the same\r\nthing fifty times. There you have the spirit of the poorer people. And\r\ndon't forget that the illiterates have the power in their hands. Just\r\nthink what this means.\r\n\r\n\"In England, with all your agricultural districts, with all your back\r\nslums of cities, there was only one person in each hundred and seventy\r\nwho could not write his name, or at all events, one in a hundred and\r\nseventy who was unable to manage his voting paper.\r\n\r\n\"In Ireland the figures were one in every five, and of the remainder\r\ntwo at least were barely able to perform so simple an operation as\r\nmaking a cross against the right name. Are these people fit to govern\r\nthemselves?\r\n\r\n\"There were two polling booths in Westport. There were three priests\r\nat each door. Tell the English people that, and see what they think of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"A Scotch gentleman staying in Westport during the late 'mission' was\r\nstopped at the door of the Roman Catholic Church. He was not permitted\r\nto enter, because the priests are ashamed to show civilised people the\r\ncredulity and crass ignorance of their congregation. At one of these\r\nservices everybody held a lighted candle, and at a given signal, Puff!\r\nout went out the lights, and with them away went the sins of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\"A priest was sent for in Achil. The case was urgent. A man was dying,\r\nand without Extreme Unction his chances in the next world were\r\nreckoned shady. The priest was enjoying himself in some festivity, and\r\nthe man died before his salvation arrived. A relative declared he\r\nwould tell the bishop. The priest reassured him with a scrap of paper,\r\nwhereon were written these words, signed by himself, 'Saint Peter.\r\nAdmit bearer.' 'Stick that in the dead man's fist,' said he. The man\r\nwent away delighted. These are the intelligent voters whose influence\r\nis now paramount in the Parliament of England. It is by these poor\r\nuntutored savages, manipulated by their priests, that the British\r\nEmpire is now worked. The semi-civilised peasants of Connaught, with\r\nthe ignorant herds of Leinster and Munster, at the bidding of their\r\nclergy have completely stopped the course of legislation, and left the\r\nlong-suffering and industrious working men of England and Scotland to\r\nwait indefinitely for all the good things they want. The cry is,\r\nIreland stops the way. Why doesn't England kick it out of the way?\r\n\r\n\"Turn about is fair play. Let England have a turn now. Fair play is a\r\njewel, and Ireland has fair play. Ireland has privileges of which\r\nneither England nor Scotland can boast. The Protestants of Ireland are\r\neverywhere prosperous and content. The Catholics of Ireland are\r\neverywhere impoverished and discontented. Wherever you go you find\r\nthis an invariable rule. The two sects may hold their farms from the\r\nsame landlord, on precisely similar terms, and you will find that the\r\nProtestants pay their rent, and get on, while the Catholics don't pay,\r\nand go from bad to worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this extraordinary difference the result of British rule?\"\r\n\r\nMany a time I have asked Catholics this question. They cannot explain\r\nthe marked difference on the ground of alien government, as both are\r\nsubject to the same. They will say, 'Oh, Protestants are always well\r\noff,' as if the thing were a matter of course, and must be looked upon\r\nas inevitable. But why? I ask. That they can never tell.\r\n\r\nStand on a big hill near Tipperary and you will see four Roman\r\nCatholic churches of modern build, costing nearly a hundred thousand\r\npounds. Father Humphreys will tell you how the money was raised, will\r\nshow you over Tipperary Cathedral, and will let you see the pig-styes\r\nin which the people are housed. That is the man of God who wrote to\r\nthe papers and complained that it had been reported that the Catholic\r\nclergy of Tipperary had done all they could to stop boycotting. Father\r\nHumphreys said:--\"I protest against this libel on me. _I am doing\r\nnothing to stop boycotting._\"\r\n\r\nA neighbour of my friend spoke of many changes he had witnessed in the\r\npolitical opinions of people who had become resident in Ireland,\r\nhaving previously been Gladstonians in England. He said:--\"When the\r\nAchil Sound viaduct was opened, chiefly by the efforts of a Northern\r\nProtestant who gave £1,500 towards the cost, a Scotchman named Cowan\r\nwas chief engineer. He came over a rabid Home Ruler, and such a\r\nworshipper of Mr. Gladstone as cannot be found out of Scotland. In six\r\nmonths he was Unionist to the backbone, and not only Unionist but\r\nConservative. The Achil folks, when once the bridge was built and\r\ngiven to them, decided to call it Michael Davitt Bridge. It had not\r\ncost them a penny, nor had they any part in it. At the priest's orders\r\nthey rushed forward to christen it; it was all they were good for.\r\nThey put up a big board with the name. Cowan went down alone, he could\r\nnot get a soul with pluck to go with him, and chopped the thing down,\r\nthe Achil Nationalists looking on. In the night they put up another\r\nboard, a big affair on the trunk of a tree, all well secured. Cowan\r\nwent down and felled it as before, watching it drift away with tide.\r\nThen they gave it up. They wouldn't go Three! Carnegie, the Customs\r\nman, came here a strong Home Ruler. Looking back, he says he cannot\r\nconceive how he could be such an ass. A very cute Scotchman, too. Some\r\nof the Gladstonians mean well. I don't condemn them wholesale, like\r\nfather does. You should hear him drop on English Home Rulers. He\r\nunderstands the Irish agitator, but the English Separatist beats him.\r\nI have been in England, and several times in Birmingham, and I have\r\nheard them talk. Father is very peppery, but I moderate his\r\ntransports. Speaking of the English Home Rulers he'll say--\r\n\r\n\"'Pack o' rogues.'\r\n\r\n\"'No, no,' says I, 'only fools.'\r\n\r\n\"'Infernal idiots,' says he.\r\n\r\n\"'No, no,' says I, 'only ignorant.'\r\n\r\n\"As I said, I have been in England, and have heard them talk, so I\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nHe asked me if I had noticed the external difference between Irish\r\ncommunities which support Home Rule and those which support the Union.\r\nI said that a contrast so striking must impress the most casual\r\nobserver, for that, on the one hand, Unionism is always coupled with\r\ncleanliness and decency, while on the other the intimate relationship\r\napparently existing between Home Rule and dunghills is most suggestive\r\nand surprising.\r\n\r\nUnionism and order: Separatism and ordure--that is about the sum.\r\n\r\nCastlereagh, June 24th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 40.--OBJECT LESSONS IN IRISH SELF-GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA small town with a great name, about one hundred miles west of\r\nDublin. There is a ruined castle, and one or two ruined abbeys, but\r\nnothing else of interest, unless it be the herons which stalk about\r\nthe streams in its environs, and the Royston crows with white or gray\r\nbreast and back, which seem to be fairly numerous in these parts.\r\nIreland is a wonderful country for crows and ravens, which hop about\r\nthe village streets as tame as barndoor fowls. A King of Connaught is\r\nburied in Saint Coenan's Abbey, but dead kings are almost as common as\r\ncrows, and Phelim O'Connor seems to have done nothing worthy of\r\nmention beyond dying in 1265. I had hardly landed when I met a very\r\npronounced anti-Home Ruler, a grazier, apparently a smart business\r\nman, and seemingly well up in the controversy. He said:--\"I have\r\nargued the question all over Ireland, and believe I have made as many\r\nconverts as anybody. Many of my countrymen have been carried away by\r\nthe popular cry, but when once they have the thing put to them from\r\nthe other side, and have time to think, they begin to have their\r\ndoubts. Naturally they first lean to the idea of an Irish Parliament.\r\nIt flatters Irish feeling, and when men look around and see the\r\ncountry so poor and so backward they want to try some change or other.\r\nThe agitators see their opportunity, and say, 'All this results from\r\nEnglish interference. If we managed our own affairs we should be\r\nbetter off all round.' This sounds plausible, and agrees with the\r\ntraditional distrust of England which the people have inherited from\r\npast ages. Men who are fairly intelligent, and fairly reasonable, will\r\nsay, 'We can't be worse off than we are at present.' That is a stock\r\nargument all over the country. The people who use it think it settles\r\nthe business. The general poverty of the people is the strength of the\r\nHome Rule position. The priests tell them that a Government composed\r\nof Irishmen would see them right, and would devote itself to looking\r\nafter their interests; and really the people have nobody to tell them\r\nanything else. Nor are they likely to hear the other side, for they\r\nare only allowed to read certain papers, and if Englishmen of\r\ncharacter and ability were to attempt to stump the country they would\r\nnot get a hearing. The clergy would make it warm for anybody who dared\r\nto attend a Unionist meeting. So _that_ process is altogether out of\r\nthe question. Isolated Roman Catholic Unionists like myself need to be\r\nin a very strong and independent position before they dare to express\r\ntheir views. Roman Catholics of position are nearly all Unionists at\r\nheart, but comparatively few of them dare avow their real convictions.\r\nTo do so is to couple yourself with the obnoxious land question. The\r\npeople, as a whole, detest landlords and England, and they think that\r\nan opponent of Home Rule is necessarily a sympathiser with British\r\nrule and landlordism, and therefore a foe to his country and a traitor\r\nto his countrymen. Few men have the moral courage to face this\r\nindictment. That is why the educated Catholic party, as a whole, hang\r\nback. And then, they dislike to put themselves in direct opposition to\r\ntheir clergy. Englishmen do not care one jot what the parson thinks of\r\ntheir political opinions, but in Ireland things are very different. I\r\nam against Home Rule because I am sure it would be bad for Ireland.\r\nThe prosperity of the country is of some importance to me, and for my\r\nown sake and apart from sentimental considerations, and for the credit\r\nof Ireland, I am against Home Rule. We should be poorer than ever. I\r\nwould not trust the present Irish party to manage anything that\r\nrequired management. They have not the training, nor the business\r\ncapacity, nor sufficient consistency to work together for a single\r\nweek. They cannot agree even at this critical moment, when by their\r\nown showing, the greatest harmony of action is required in the\r\ninterests of Ireland. I say nothing about their honesty, for the most\r\nscrupulously honest men could not succeed without business ability and\r\nunited action. They are a set of talkers, good for quibbling and\r\nsquabbling and nothing more.\r\n\r\n\"They are M.P.'s because they can talk. Paddy loves a glib talker, and\r\na fellow with a good jaw on him would always beat the best business\r\nman, even if Paddy were allowed his own choice. Of course he has no\r\nchoice--he votes as the priest tells him; but then the selected men\r\nwere all good rattling talkers, not in the House, perhaps, but in\r\ntheir own country district in Ireland. Paddy thinks talking means\r\nability, and when a fellow rattles off plenty of crack-jaw words and\r\nred-hot abuse of England, Paddy believes him able to regenerate the\r\nworld. These men are not allowed to speak in the House. They only\r\nvote. But let me tell you they are kings in their own country.\r\n\r\n\"Since Parnell ordered his followers to contest all the elective\r\nBoards in Ireland, the Nationalist party have almost monopolised the\r\nPoor Law Boards, with the result that nearly every one has been openly\r\nbankrupt, or else is in a state of present insolvency. Mr. Morley has\r\nbeen asked for particulars but has declined to give them. He knows\r\nthat the list of insolvent Poor Law Boards in Ireland, if once given\r\nwith particulars, to the British public, would show up the prospects\r\nof Home Rule in such a damaging way that 'the cause' would never\r\nsurvive the shock. Why does not the Unionist party bring about this\r\nexposure? Surely the information is obtainable, if not from Mr.\r\nMorley, then from some other source.\r\n\r\n\"Why are they bankrupt? you ask. Partly through incompetence; partly\r\nthrough corruption. In every case of declared bankruptcy Government\r\nhas sent down vice-Guardians receiving three hundred pounds to five\r\nhundred pounds a year, and notwithstanding this additional burden to\r\nthe rates the vice-Guardians in every case have paid off all debts and\r\nleft a balance in hand inside of two years. Then they retire, and the\r\nhonorary Guardians come back to scuttle the ship again. Tell the\r\nEnglish people that. Mr. Morley cannot deny it. You have told them?\r\nThen tell them again, and again.\r\n\r\n\"In the Killarney Union the Nationalists ran up the rates from one\r\nthousand seven hundred pounds to three thousand six hundred pounds.\r\nMore distress? Not a bit of it. But even admitting this, how would you\r\naccount for the fact that the cost ran up from sixteen shillings a\r\nhead to twenty-five shillings a head for every person relieved?\r\n\r\n\"The Listowel Union was perhaps the biggest scandal in the country.\r\nThe Unionist Guardians relieved the people at a cost of five shillings\r\na head. The Nationalists got in and relieved them at a cost of fifteen\r\nshillings a head. And there wasn't a reduction on taking a quantity,\r\nfor the Unionists only had two hundred on the books, while the\r\nNationalists had two thousand or more.\r\n\r\n\"At the same period exactly those Unions which remained under the old\r\nrule showed little or no increase in the rates. Kenmare remained\r\nUnionist, and when the great rise in poor-law expenses followed the\r\nelection of Nationalist Guardians Kenmare spent less money than ever.\r\n\r\n\"The Nationalist Guardians have been vising the poor rates to reward\r\ntheir friends and to punish the landlords. They have been fighting the\r\nlandlords with money raised from the landlords by means of poor rates.\r\nEvicted tenants generally received a pound or twenty-five shillings a\r\nweek out-door relief. This punishes the landlords, and saves the funds\r\nof the Land League, now called the National League. Ingenious, isn't\r\nit? These are the men who form the class furnishing the Irish\r\nParliamentary party. These bankrupt, incompetent, and fraudulent\r\nGuardians are the men with whom English Gladstonians are closely\r\nallied. The Board meetings are usually blackguardly beyond\r\ndescription. You have no idea to what extremes they go. No Irishman\r\nwho loves his country would trust her to the tender mercies of these\r\nfellows.\"\r\n\r\nI have not yet been present at any meeting of an Irish Poor Law Board,\r\nand probably, as my friend remarked, I \"do not know to what extremes\r\nthey go.\" The _Mayo News_ of a week or two ago reported an ordinary\r\nmeeting of the Westport Board, and I noticed that one Guardian accused\r\nhis colleagues of stealing the potatoes provided out of the rates for\r\nthe paupers. This was reported in a Nationalist print edited by a\r\ngentleman who has had the honour of being imprisoned for Land League\r\nbusiness. The report was evidently verbatim, and has not been\r\ncontradicted. The Westport folks took no notice of the affair, which\r\nmay therefore be assumed as representing the dead level of an Irish\r\nPoor Law debate. To what sublime altitudes they may occasionally rise,\r\nto \"what extremes\" they sometimes go, I know not. The College Green\r\nParliament, manned by such members, would have a peculiar interest.\r\nThe Speaker might be expected to complain that his umbrella (recently\r\nre-covered) had mysteriously disappeared. The Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer might accuse the President of the Board of Trade of having\r\nappropriated the National stationery, and the Master of the Rolls\r\nmight rise to declare that a sanguinary ruffian from Ulster had\r\n\"pinched his wipe.\" The sane inhabitants of the Emerald Isle affirm\r\nthat Home Rule would be ruinous to trade, but the vendors of\r\nshillelaghs and sticking-plaster would certainly have a high old time.\r\n\r\nAn Englishman who has had exceptional opportunities of examining the\r\nmatter said:--\"I don't care so much for Irish interests as for English\r\ninterests, and I am of opinion that no Englishman in a position to\r\nform a correct judgment would for one moment support the bill. The\r\ntension is off us now, because we feel that the danger to a great\r\nextent is over. The bill could not be expected to survive a public\r\nexamination. The Gladstonians themselves must now see that the scheme\r\nwas not only absurd and impossible, but iniquitous. Under a Home Rule\r\nBill their native land would cut a sorry figure, such as would almost\r\nshame the milk-sop Radical party, 'friends of every country but their\r\nown.' A Government with a sufficient majority to carry a British\r\nmeasure might at any time be turned out of office by the eighty Irish\r\nmembers, who could at any time make their votes the price of some\r\nfurther concession. And you know the character of the men, how\r\nthoroughly unscrupulous they are. All are enemies of England, and yet\r\nwe who know them and the feeling of their constituencies are asked to\r\nbelieve that they would never abuse their powers. Why give them the\r\ntemptation? Then, whatever debts Ireland might incur England would\r\nhave to pay, should Ireland repudiate them? The bill provides that\r\nEngland shall be ultimately responsible for three-quarters of a\r\nmillion annually for the servants of the Crown in Ireland, such\r\nservants being at the orders of the Irish Legislature. It is a divorce\r\ncase, wherein the husband is to be responsible for the wife's debts\r\nincurred after separation. This is Mr. Gladstone's fine proposition.\r\nAnd then England will have no police under her control to make\r\ndefaulters pay up. You can't make the people pay rent and taxes with\r\nall your present force. How are you going to collect the two or three\r\nmillions of Ireland's share in Imperial expenditure without any force\r\nat all? The police will be at the orders of the Irish Parliament,\r\nwhich will be returned by the very men who will owe the money. 'Oh\r\nyes!' say Dillon, Healy, O'Brien, and all the rest of the No Rent and\r\nLand League men. 'We'll see that the money is paid.' The previous\r\nhistory of these men ought to be enough for Englishmen. But if Tim\r\nHealy and Co. wished the money to be paid, they would have no power.\r\nThey must take their orders from the people. How would you collect the\r\ninterest on the eighteen or twenty millions Ireland now owes? The\r\npolice and civil officers would, under a Home Rule Bill, be the\r\nservants of the Irish Government, and would have no sympathy with\r\nEngland. A hitch would very soon arise between the two Parliaments\r\neither on the interpretation of this or that clause, or else because\r\nthe Irish Parliament fell short of its duty in collecting the tribute.\r\nThe Irish Government would stand firm, and would be supported by\r\npriests and people. The British Grenadiers would then come in, and\r\nwhere would be the Union of Hearts? Irishmen are fond of a catch-word.\r\nLike the French, they will go to death for a phrase. But the Union of\r\nHearts never tickled them. The words never fell from Irish lips except\r\nin mockery.\r\n\r\n\"Protection would be the great rallying cry of a Home Rule Government.\r\nThe bill refuses power to impose protective duties, but Ireland would\r\ncommence by conceding bounties to Irish manufacturers, who would there\r\nand then be able to undersell English traders. No use going further\r\ninto the thing, there is not a good point in it for either country. No\r\nuse flogging a dead horse. There never will be any Home Rule, and\r\nthere's no use in discussing it. A liberal measure of Local\r\nSelf-Government will be the upshot of this agitation, nothing more.\r\nAnd that will come from the Tory party, the only friends of poor\r\nIreland.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parnellites are strong in Roscommon, and to hear them revile the\r\npriests is both strange and sad. These are the only Catholics who\r\nresent clerical dictation. They seem in a quandary. Their action seems\r\ninconsistent with their expressed sentiments. They plainly see that\r\nHome Rule means Rome Rule, and, while deprecating priestly influence,\r\nthey do their best to put the country into priestly hands. They speak\r\nof the Anti-Parnellites with contempt and aversion, calling them\r\nrogues and vagabonds, liars and traitors, outside the pale of\r\ncivilisation, and yet they work for Home Rule, which would put their\r\nbeloved Ireland in the power of the very men whose baseness and crass\r\nincompetence they cannot characterise in terms sufficiently strong.\r\nFor the Anti-Parnellites outnumber the Parnellites by eight to one; so\r\nthat the smaller party, although monopolising all virtue, grace and\r\nintellect, would have no show at all, unless, indeed, the Nationalists\r\nwere further subdivided, on which contingency the Parnellites probably\r\ncount with certainty. I interviewed a champagny little man whose views\r\nwere very decided. He said:--\r\n\r\n\"I think the seventy-three Federationists, as they want to be called,\r\nare not only traitors to the greatest Irishmen of the age, but also\r\nmean-spirited tools of the Catholic bishops. A man may have proper\r\nrespect for his faith, and may yet resent the dictation of his family\r\npriest. I admit his superior knowledge of spiritual matters, but I\r\nthink I know what politics suit me best, and I send him to the\r\nrightabout. Let him look after the world to come. That's his business.\r\nI'm going to look after this world for myself. The main difference\r\nbetween the Parnellites and the Anti-Parnellites is just this--the\r\nParnellites keep themselves independent of any English party; the\r\nAnti-Parnellites have identified themselves with the English Liberals,\r\nand bargain with them. My view is this, that the English Radicals will\r\nuse the Irish party for their own ends, that they want to utilise them\r\nin carrying out the Newcastle programme, and that having so used them\r\nthe Irishmen may go and hang themselves. 'We give you Home Rule and\r\nyou give us the Newcastle budget'--that's the present arrangement. But\r\nafter that? What then? Ireland will want the Home Rule Bill amended.\r\nThe first bill (if ever we get it) must be very imperfect, and will\r\nwant no end of improvement. It is bound to be a small, mean affair,\r\nand will want expansion and breadth. Then the Radicals will chuck over\r\nthe Anti-Parnellites, who will be equally shunted by the Tories, and\r\nwe shall be left hanging in the air. The Parnellites aim at getting\r\neverything on its merits, and decline to identify themselves with any\r\nparty. They wish to be called Independents. And they one and all\r\ndecline to be managed by the priests. The seventy-three\r\nAnti-Parnellites are entirely managed by the Clerical party. They have\r\nno will of their own any more than the pasteboard men you see in the\r\nshop windows, whose legs and arms fly up and down, when you pull a\r\nstring. They are just like Gladstonians in that respect.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parnellites are hard up, and their organ asks America for cash.\r\nThe dauntless nine want six thousand pounds for pocket-money and hotel\r\nexpenses. The cause of Ireland demands this sacrifice. After so many\r\ncontributions, surely America will not hold back at the supreme\r\nmoment. The Anti-Parnellites are bitterly incensed. To act\r\nindependently of their faction was of itself most damnable, but still\r\nit could be borne. To ask for money from America, to put in a claim\r\nfor coppers which might have flowed into Anti-Parnellite pockets,\r\nshows a degradation, an unspeakable impudence for which the _Freeman_\r\ncannot find adequate adjectives. The priest-ridden journal speaks of\r\nits fellow patriots as caluminators and liars, tries to describe their\r\n\"baseness,\" their \"inconceivable insolence and inconceivable\r\nstupidity,\" and breaks down in the effort. A column and a half of\r\nspace is devoted to calling the Parnellites ill names such as were\r\nformerly applied by Irish patriots to Mr. Gladstone. And all because\r\nthey compete for the cents of Irish-American slaveys and bootblacks.\r\nThe Parnellites are not to be deterred by mere idle clamour. Both\r\nparties are accustomed to be called liars and rogues, and both parties\r\naccept the appellations as a matter of course. Nothing can stop them\r\nwhen on the trail of cash. Is Irish sentiment to be again disappointed\r\nfor a paltry six thousand pounds? Is the Sisyphean stone of Home Rule,\r\nso laboriously rolled uphill, to again roll down, crushing in its fall\r\nthe faithful rollers? Will not some American millionaire come forward\r\nwith noble philanthropy _and_ six thousand pounds to rescue and to\r\nsave the most beautiful, the most unfortunate country in the world\r\nfrom further disappointment? Only six thousand pounds now required for\r\nthe great ultimate, or penultimate, or antepenultimate effort. Another\r\ntwopence and up goes the donkey!\r\n\r\nRoscommon, June 27th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 41.--THE CHANGED SPIRIT OF THE CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dubliners have quite given up the bill. The Unionist party have\r\nregained their calm, and the Nationalists are resigned to the\r\nposition. Nobody, of whatever political colour, or however sanguine,\r\nnow expects the measure to become law. The Separatist rank and file\r\nnever hoped for so much luck, and their disappointment is therefore\r\nanything but unbearable. My first letter indicated this lack of faith\r\nand also its cause. The Dublin folks never really believed a British\r\nParliament would so stultify itself. The old lady who, on my arrival,\r\nsaid \"We'll get Home Rule when a pair of white wings grows out o' me\r\nshoulders, an' I fly away like a big blackburd,\" finds her pendant in\r\nthe jarvey, who this morning said, \"If we'd got the bill I would have\r\nbeen as much surprised as if one o' me childhren got the moon by\r\nroarin' for it.\" Distrust of Mr. Gladstone is more prevalent than\r\never, and the prophets who all along credited that pious statesman\r\nwith rank insincerity are now saying \"I towld ye so.\" The\r\nLord-Lieutenant is making his Viceregal progress in an ominous\r\nsilence. The Limerick people let him go without a cheer. At Foynes\r\nsomething like a procession was formed, with the parish priest at its\r\nhead; but the address read by his Rivirince reads very like a\r\nscolding. It points out that \"our rivers are at present without\r\nshipping, our mills and factories are idle, and it is a sad sight to\r\nsee our beautiful Shannon, where all her Majesty's fleet could safely\r\nride on the estuary of its waters, without almost a ship of\r\nmerchandise on its surface on account of the general decay of our\r\ntrade and commerce.\" The address further shows that \"we enjoy a\r\ncombination of natural advantages in the shape of a secure, sheltered\r\nanchorage, together with railway and telegraph in immediate proximity\r\nto the harbour and the pier, and postal service twice daily, both\r\ninwards and outwards, and a first-class quality of pure water laid on\r\nto the pier. The facility for landing or embarking troops, or for\r\ndischarging or loading goods or stores is as near perfection as\r\npossible, and having a range of depth of water of twenty-five feet at\r\nlow-water spring tide, the harbour can accommodate ships of deep\r\ndraught at any state of the tide.\" These advantages, mostly owing to\r\nBritish rule, with others, such as the \"unique combination of mountain\r\nand river scenery,\" were not enumerated as subjects for thankfulness,\r\nbut rather by way of reproach, the effect of the whole address being a\r\nveiled indictment of British rule. No doubt Lord Houghton's first\r\nimpulse would be to exclaim, \"Then why on earth don't you use your\r\nadvantages? With good quays, piers, storehouses, and a broad deep\r\nriver, opening on the Atlantic, why don't you do some business?\" But\r\nhe promised to do his best to send them a guard-ship, in order that\r\nthe crew might spend some money in the district. The Galway folks\r\nasked him to do something for them. My previous letters have shown the\r\nincapacity of the Galwegians to do anything for themselves, and how,\r\nbeing left to their own devices--having, in fact, a full enjoyment of\r\nlocal Home Rule--their incompetence has saddled the city with a debt\r\nof fifty thousand pounds for which they have practically nothing to\r\nshow, except an additional debt of one thousand pounds decreed against\r\nthem for knocking the bottom out of a coaling vessel during their\r\n\"improving\" operations, which sum they never expect to pay, as the\r\nharbour tolls are collected by the Board of Works, which thus\r\nendeavours to indemnify itself for having lent them the \"improvement\"\r\nfunds. The Killybegs folks showed the poor Viceroy their bay and told\r\nhim what wonderful things they could do if they only had a pier, or a\r\nquay, or something. The Achil folks formerly said the same thing. Two\r\npiers were built but no man ever goes near them. The Mulranney folks\r\npointed out that while Clew Bay, and particularly the nook of it\r\ncalled Mulranney Bay, was literally alive with fish, the starving\r\npeasants of the neighbourhood could do nothing for want of a pier. The\r\nbrutal Saxon built one at once--a fine handsome structure, at once a\r\npier, a breakwater, and a harbour, with boat-slips and three stages\r\nwith steps, so that boats could be used at any tide. I stepped this\r\nmassive and costly piece of masonry, and judged it to be a hundred\r\nyards long. There were six great mooring posts, but not a boat in\r\nsight, nor any trace of fishing operations. A broad new road to the\r\npier was cut and metalled, but no one uses it. The fishing village of\r\nMulranney, with its perfect appointments, would not in twelve months\r\nfurnish you with one poor herring. The pier of Killybegs would\r\nprobably be just as useful to the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe Dublin Nationalist prints make some show of fight, but the people\r\nheed them not. They know too well that their inward conviction that\r\nHome Rule is for the present defunct is founded on rock. In vain the\r\nparty writers use the whip. Your Irishman is cute enough to know when\r\nhe is beaten. The new-born regard of the Irish press for Parliamentary\r\npurity is comical enough. Obstruction is the thing they hate.\r\nUngentlemanly conduct in the House stinks in their nostrils. Fair play\r\nis their delight, and underhand dealing they particularly abhor. Mr.\r\nGladstone is too lenient, and although his failings lean to virtue's\r\nside, his action is too oily altogether. He is old and weak, and\r\nlubricates too much. They in effect accuse him of fatty degeneration\r\nof the brain. Something heroic must be done. Those low-bred ruffians,\r\nthe Unionists, must be swept from the path of Erin, while her eloquent\r\nsons, actuated by patriotism and six pounds a week, and spurred on by\r\nthe hope of even a larger salary, obtain after seven centuries some\r\nshow of justice to Ireland. The Irish wire-pullers demand decisive\r\naction. They declare that they will no longer submit to the\r\n\"happy-go-lucky policy of the gentlemen who survey life from the\r\nMinisterial benches.\" They must \"put themselves in fighting form and\r\nshow their supporters that they mean business.\" \"Unless the Ministry\r\nmean to throw up the sponge they had better begin the fighting at\r\nonce.\" The Irish party \"are looking for the action of the Government\r\nwhich is to make it evident to the Opposition that the majority mean\r\nto rule in the House of Commons, for unless this be done Parliamentary\r\ngovernment becomes a farce.\" If Mr. Gladstone continues the policy of\r\nhesitation and waiting on Providence, the fate of Home Rule, and with\r\nit the fate of the Liberal party, are sealed. \"Obstruction\" (says the\r\nParnellite paper) cannot be permitted!\" It is the revelation of the\r\nimpotency of Parliament, and Parliamentary procedure must be replaced\r\nby some quicker means of effecting reform. Mr. Gladstone's feebleness\r\nis an incitement to revolution. The Dublin press would manage these\r\nthings better. An autumn session must not be adventured. If the House\r\nshould rise before the bill has passed the Commons such a confession\r\nof weakness would fatally damage the Government prestige. The House\r\nmust \"be kept in permanent session, and not kept too long,\" which\r\nsounds like a bull, but the next sentence is plain enough.\r\n\r\n\"The obvious policy is to at once take the Opposition by the throat.\r\nThat will excite enthusiasm, and convince the people that a Liberal\r\nGovernment is good for something.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nationalist prints are assuming the office of candid friend, a\r\npart which suits them admirably, and in the performance of which they\r\nmake wonderful guesses at truth. The Gladstonian Ministry \"are\r\nhelpless and impotent in the hands of their opponents. The reforms so\r\nardently desired by the people are seen to be mere mirages, called up\r\nto win the votes of the people for men who, once in office, make no\r\nreal effort to enforce the mandate given to them by the country.\" The\r\nLiberal Ministry will be \"swept out of existence because the people\r\nwill come to recognise that their promises and programmes are so many\r\nhollow phrases, incapable of ministering to the needs or satisfying\r\nthe aspirations of the multitude.\" \"The real tug of war,\" says this\r\nHome Rule sheet, \"will come in the next election.\" If Irish\r\nSeparatists talk like this, what do Irish Unionists say?\r\n\r\nVery little, indeed. They are disposed to rest and be thankful. They\r\nonly want to be let alone. They are quiet and reserved, and thank\r\ntheir stars that the worst is over. The nervousness, the high-strung\r\ntension of three months ago, is conspicuous by its absence. They\r\nfeared that the thing would be rushed, and that Mr. Bull would stamp\r\nthe measure without looking at it, would be glad to get rid of it at\r\nany price, would say to Ireland, \"Take it, get out of my sight, and be\r\nhanged to ye!\" Thanks to the Unionist leaders, whose ability and\r\ndevotion are here warmly recognised, the Dubliners know no fear. The\r\nridiculous abortion has been dragged into the sunlight, and ruthlessly\r\ndissected. John's commonsense can be trusted, once he examines for\r\nhimself, and worthy Irishmen lie down in peace. The graver Dubliners\r\nprefer to speak of something else. The young bloods still make fun of\r\nthe \"patriots,\" and conjure up illimitable vistas of absurd\r\npossibilities under an Irish Government. They invariably place the\r\nhypothetic Cabinet under the direct orders of Archbishop Walsh, and\r\ncontinue to make fun of that great hierarch's famous malediction on\r\nFreemasonry. The good Archbishop, they say, takes a large size in\r\ncurses. They declare that his curse on the Masonic bazaar for orphans\r\nwas a marvel of comprehensive detail; that it cursed the\r\nstall-holders, the purchasers, the tea-pot cosies and fender-stools,\r\nthe five-o'clock tea-tables and antimacassars, the china ornaments,\r\nand embroidered slippers, with every individual bead; the dolls, both\r\nlarge and small; the bran that stuffed the dolls, and the very squeaks\r\nwhich resulted from a squeeze on the doll's ribs. Never was heard such\r\na terrible curse. But what gave rise to no little surprise, nobody\r\nseemed one penny the worse. These scoffers propose to discontinue the\r\nhabit of swearing. When the Archbishop produces no effect, what's the\r\ngood of a plain layman's cursing? They declare that the dentists of\r\nDublin are all Home Rulers, and that the selfishness of their\r\npolitical faith is disgustingly obvious. These mocking Unionists\r\ndiscuss probable points of etiquette likely to arise in the\r\nLegislature of College Green, and dispute as to whether members will\r\nbe allowed to attend with decidedly black eyes, or whether they will\r\nbe excluded until the skin around their orbs has arrived at the pale\r\nyellow stage. Some are of opinion that no Cabinet Minister should be\r\nallowed to sit while wearing raw beefsteak, and a story is going the\r\nrounds to the effect that some of the Irish members recently wished to\r\ncross the Channel for half-a-crown each, and to that end called on a\r\nboat agent, a Tory, who knew them, when the following conversation\r\ntook place:--\r\n\r\n\"Can we go across for half-a-crown each?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, ye can't, thin.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because 'tis a cattle boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that, sure we're not particular.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but the cattle are.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a great rush for Dynamitard Daly's letter, and some of his\r\nsentences were made subjects of leading articles in the Nationalist\r\npress. One paragraph seems to have been neglected. He writes--\"Friend\r\nJack, you amazed me when you mentioned the names of ex-felons now\r\nhonourable members of the Imperial Parliament. And so they seem to\r\nforget the days when _they_ were felons? Ah, well, thank God, the\r\npeople did not forget them in their hour of need, and though some of\r\nthem may try to palm off their own selfish ambitions on the people to\r\nwhom they owe everything as genuine patriotism--oh, it won't do!\" John\r\nDaly holds the same opinion of his fellow patriots as is expressed in\r\na remarkable letter to the Separatist _Dublin Evening Herald_, wherein\r\nthe writer says that his party is \"disgusted with the duplicity of Mr.\r\nGladstone,\" and goes on to say that \"No one now believes that the bill\r\nwill pass, and almost everyone believes it was never intended to pass.\r\nI have not yet met anybody who expressed themselves as even remotely\r\nsatisfied with it. Peace to its ashes.\" I quote this as proving two\r\npoints I have always endeavoured to urge--first, that the Irish\r\ndistrust Mr. Gladstone, and are not grateful to him or his party; and,\r\nsecond, that no bill short of complete independence will ever satisfy\r\nthe Irish people. It is what they expect and look forward to as the\r\ndirect outcome of Home Rule, which they only want as a stepping-stone.\r\nThis cannot fail to impress itself on any unbiassed person who rubs\r\nagainst them for long. The teaching of the priests is eminently\r\ndisloyal, and although the utmost care is taken to prevent their\r\ndisloyalty becoming public, instances are not lacking to show the\r\ngeneral trend. Father Sheehy, an especial friend of the Archbishop\r\nWalsh aforesaid, thus delivered himself anent a proposed visit of the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales to Ireland:--\"There is no need for a\r\nforeign prince to come to Ireland. The Irish people have nothing to\r\nsay to the Prince of Wales. He has no connection with Ireland except\r\nthat link of the Crown that has been formed for the country, which is\r\nthe symbol of Ireland's slavery.\" This priest said he hated\r\nlandgrabbers; all except one. \"There is but one landgrabber I like,\r\nand that is the Tsar of Russia, who threatens to take territory on the\r\nAfghan border from England.\" Father Arthur Ryan, of Thurles, the seat\r\nof Archbishop Croke, has printed a manifesto, in which he\r\nsays:--\"Ever since the Union the best and most honourable of Irishmen\r\nhave looked on rebellion as a sacred duty, provided there were a\r\nreasonable chance of success. It has never occurred to me to consider\r\nacquiescence to the Government of England as a moral obligation or as\r\nother than a dire necessity. We have never, thank God, lied to our\r\noppressors by saying we were loyal to them. And when we have condemned\r\nthe rebels whose heroism and self-sacrifice we have loved and wept\r\nover, we condemned not their want of loyalty, but their want of\r\nprudence. We thought it wrong to plunge the land into the horrors of\r\nwar with no hope of success.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for our trusty and well-beloved fellow-subjects of this realm\r\nof England. Father Ryan is candid, truthful, and outspoken, and\r\ncommands respect. Better an open enemy than a false friend. His\r\nsumming-up of Irish feeling to England is both concise and accurate,\r\nbut one of his sentences is hardly up to date. He thanks God that the\r\nIrish have never lied by saying they were loyal. How many Irish\r\nmembers can make this their boast? Compared with them, the Ribbonmen\r\nwere heroes. The glorious prototypes of the modern member murdered\r\ntheir foes themselves, did their slaughtering in person, and took the\r\nrisk like men. They hated Englishmen, _qua_ Englishmen, and made no\r\nsecret of it. The modern method is easier and more convenient. To\r\nmurder by proxy, to have your hints carried out without danger to\r\nyourself, and to draw pay for your hinting, is a triumph of\r\nnineteenth-century ingenuity. To pose as loyal subjects and to disarm\r\nsuspicion by protestations of friendship and brotherly love may be a\r\nmore effective means of attaining your end, but it smacks too much of\r\nthe serpent. The Ribbonmen were rough and rugged, but comparatively\r\nrespectable. The Irish Separatists are just as disloyal, and\r\ninfinitely more treacherous. The parchment \"loyalty to Her Most\r\nGracious Majesty the Queen,\" which Lord Houghton is in some places\r\nreceiving, is revolting to all who know the truth. The snake has\r\nsucceeded the tiger, and most people hate sliminess. Nationalist\r\nIreland is intensely disloyal from side to side, and from end to end.\r\nDisloyal and inimical she has been from the first, and disloyal and\r\ninimical she remains, and no concessions can change her character. She\r\nis religious with a mediæval faith, and she follows her spiritual\r\nguides, whose sole aim is religious ascendancy. So long as the Roman\r\nCatholic Church is not predominant so long the Irish people will\r\ncomplain. You may give them the land for nothing; you may stock their\r\nfarms--they will expect it; you may indemnify them for the seven\r\nhundred years of robbery by the English people--they say they ought to\r\nbe indemnified; you may furnish every yeoman with a gun and\r\nammunition, with _carte blanche_ as to their use with litigious\r\nneighbours; you may lay on whiskey in pipes, like gas and water, but\r\nwithout any whiskey rate; you may compel the Queen to do Archbishop\r\nWalsh's washing, and the Prince of Wales to black his sacred boots,\r\nwhile the English nobility look after the pigs of the foinest pisintry\r\nin the wuruld, and still the Irish would be malcontents. The Church\r\nwants absolute predominance, and she won't be happy till she gets it.\r\nParnell was Protestant and something of a Pope. Tim Healy tried to\r\nwear the leader's boots, but Bishop Walsh reduced him to a pulp. This\r\ngood man rules Dublin, and through Dublin, Ireland. You cannot walk\r\nfar without running against his consecrated name. At present the city\r\nis labelled as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"By direction of his Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, the annual\r\ncollections for our Holy Father the Pope will take place on July the\r\nsecond.\" The National League and Our Holy Father the Pope between them\r\ncut very close. No wonder that poor Paddy has hardly a feather left to\r\nfly with.\r\n\r\n\"An ardent Nationalist\" thus expresses himself in the Separatist\r\n_Herald_:--\"I fear we must reluctantly abandon hope of a Home\r\nParliament for a few more years. For the present we will have to\r\ncontent ourselves with Local Government, an ample measure of which\r\nwill be given by the _Conservatives_. On the whole, ardent Nationalist\r\nas I am, I do not look on this as an unmixed evil. What kind of\r\nGovernment would be possible under six or seven factions?\" This should\r\nbe a staggerer for the English Home Rule party. The italics are in the\r\noriginal, and the writer goes on to say, \"It is open to doubt that we\r\nshould be able to at once manage our own affairs without some\r\npreliminary training.\" The whole letter is a substantial repetition of\r\nthe sentiments emanating from a Home Ruler of Tralee, recounted in my\r\nletter from that town of Kerry.\r\n\r\nParnell is still worshipped in Dublin. He looks big beside his\r\nsuccessors. His grave in the splendid cemetery of Glasnevin is well\r\nworth a visit, although there is no monument beyond a cast-iron Irish\r\ncross painted green, which serves to hang flowers upon. The grave is\r\nin a rope-enclosed circle, some twenty yards in diameter, and most of\r\nthe space is occupied by big glass shades, with flowers and other\r\ntributes of respect and affection. I counted more than a hundred, many\r\nof them elaborate. The Corkmen send the biggest, a small greenhouse\r\nwith two brown Irish harps and the legend DONE TO DEATH. An Irish harp\r\nworked in embroidery lies sodden on the earth. Green shamrock leaves\r\nof tin, with the names of all the donors--this is important--obtrude\r\nthemselves here and there. A six-foot cross of white flowers, like a\r\nbadge of purity, lies on the grave, labelled Katherine Parnell, in a\r\nlady's hand. The place is swamped with Irish harps, and it occurs to\r\nme that the badge would not be so popular if the patriots knew that\r\nthe harp was imposed as an emblem of Ireland by English Henry the\r\nSecond. The name PARNELL in iron letters is on the turf, flowers\r\ngrowing through them, a poetical idea. As I walk past they vibrate\r\nwith a metallic jingle, which reminds me of the shirt of mail the\r\nliving man wore to preserve himself from his fellow-patriots. Tay\r\nPay's life of the dead leader proves that his sole secret of success\r\nwas inflexible purpose, and that his notion of party management was to\r\ntreat the patriot members as dirt. Parnell was an authority in Irish\r\nmatters, and his example should be useful to Messrs. Gladstone,\r\nMorley, and Co. An eminent Irishmen to-day said:--\"With your\r\nwibble-wobble and your shilly-shally, your pooh-pooh and your pah-pah,\r\nyou are ruining the country. Put down your foot and tell the Irish\r\npeople that they will not now nor at any future time get Home Rule,\r\nand not a word will come out of them.\" A word (to the wise) is enough.\r\n\r\nDublin, June 29th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 42.--AT A NATIONALIST MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature of Dundalk life is the fact that the\r\npeople are doing something. Not much, perhaps, but still something.\r\nThe port is handy for Liverpool and Glasgow, and a steam packet\r\ncompany gives a little life to the quays. The barracks, not far from\r\nthe shore, indicate one large source of custom, for wherever you find\r\na British regiment you find the people better off. The Athlone folks\r\nsay that but for the soldiers the place would be dead and buried, and\r\nthe Galway people are complaining that the garrison, the hated English\r\ngarrison, has been withdrawn. This inconsistency at first surprises\r\nyou, but you soon grow familiarised with the strange inconsistencies\r\nof this wonderful island. Dundalk has vastly improved during the three\r\ndozen years which have elapsed since first I visited the town. There\r\nis a Catholic church for every hundred yards of street, and on\r\nThursday last one of them at least was full to overflowing. It was the\r\nfestival of Saints Peter and Paul, and England was being solemnly\r\ndedicated to Rome. There was no getting inside to witness the\r\noperation, for the kneeling crowds extended into the street and\r\nflopped down on their marrow-bones on the side walks. The men with the\r\ncollection plates could hardly hold their ground in the portals, and\r\nmany worshippers were sent empty away, raising their hats as they\r\nreluctantly turned from the sacred precincts. This was between eleven\r\nand twelve in the forenoon, so that the day's work was hopelessly\r\nbroken. Ireland has endless customs demanding cessation of labour, but\r\nnone demanding the pious to go to work. The Methodist and Presbyterian\r\nchurches were closed, and possibly their adherents were stealing a\r\nmarch on the Catholics in the matter of business. The Church of\r\nIreland has a bright green spire, which at first puzzles the\r\nunlearned. Its hoisting of the national colour is due to the fact that\r\nthe whole structure is covered with copper, which in its turn is\r\ncovered with verdigris. The surroundings of the town are pleasant,\r\nand, although thatched cottages abound, they are very superior to the\r\ndirty dens of Tipperary. Nearly all have the half-doors so convenient\r\nfor gossiping, and the female population of these cabins spend much\r\nof their time in leaning over the lower half. The superiority of\r\nDundalk is by most people attributed to the strong mixture of\r\nNortherners there resident, and the favourable position of the port.\r\nEarnest Unionists are by no means scarce, and, as usual, they are the\r\npick of the population. The Parnellites are also present in strong\r\nforce, and this may account for the fact that Mr. Timothy Healy, the\r\nrespected member for North Louth, is unable to visit the chief town of\r\nhis constituency without a guard of two hundred policemen, paid and\r\ncommanded by his life-long foe--the base and brutal Saxon. A prominent\r\ncitizen said:--\r\n\r\n\"We have a number of Englishmen coming over here, and most of them are\r\nUnionists. But a few birds of passage I have seen have vexed me with\r\ntheir confident ignorance, and caused me to believe that English\r\nGladstonians are the densest donkeys under the sun. They are so\r\nself-opiniated, and so full of self-satisfaction, that it is hard to\r\nbe patient with them. Not a few say simply that they are content to\r\nleave the matter in the hands of Mr. Gladstone, and that as they\r\nfollowed him so far, they will follow him to the end. They decline to\r\nexamine for themselves, although facilities are offered on the spot.\r\nThis must be the ruling temper of the English Home Rule party, for if\r\nthey stopped to examine for themselves, or even to hear the evidence\r\nsubmitted by men of position and integrity they could never tolerate\r\nthe insane proposition of an Irish Parliament for a day. They\r\nsometimes say that Irishmen should govern their own land, and that no\r\none could venture to dispute this proposition. This is their principal\r\nargument, and some are led away by its show of reason. But what is the\r\ntruth?\r\n\r\n\"Irishmen _do_ govern Ireland. Listen. Is England governed by\r\nEnglishmen? Now Ireland has a far greater number of members in\r\nproportion to her population than England has. These men have far more\r\npower in the English Parliament than England herself, for they hold\r\nthe balance of parties. In every question, Irish or English, they have\r\nthe casting vote. So that they can almost always decide what is to\r\nbecome law.\r\n\r\n\"Dundalk is at this moment placarded with a request that all men\r\nshould join in the glorious struggle for freedom. Unless the Irish\r\npeople were constantly told they were slaves, they would never know\r\nit. They are fed on lies from their infancy. The current issue of\r\n_United Ireland_ states in a leader that the prison authorities have\r\nthree times tried to get rid of John Daly, the dynamitard, by\r\npoisoning him in prison. As if they could not do it if they liked! And\r\na few weeks ago, at an amnesty meeting at Drumicondra, a speaker\r\nstated, in the presence of two or three members of Parliament, that\r\nfive of the thirteen political prisoners still locked up had been\r\ndriven mad by horrible tortures. What freedom do the Irish want? Have\r\nthey not precisely the same freedom as that enjoyed by England, the\r\nfreest country in the world? Have they not the same laws, except where\r\nthose laws have been relaxed in favour of Ireland? Have they not\r\nreligious equality, free trade, a free press, and vote by ballot? And\r\nwith all this they are told at every turn that they are the most\r\ndown-trodden nation of slaves on earth. Supposed they groaned under\r\nconscription like France and Germany, what then?\r\n\r\n\"The English people have seen the results of the influence exercised\r\nby the present Irish leaders. One would think that sensible Britons\r\nwould decline to entrust such men with power. Did they not bring about\r\nthe rule of the Land League, with its stories of foul murder which\r\nsound like a horrible dream of the tyranny of the Middle Ages? Are\r\nthese men not hand and glove with the clerical party, which hates\r\nEngland as heretic and excommunicate? It is not proposed by Home Rule\r\nto put in office men who are the mere tools of the Catholic church,\r\nthe most unyielding and intolerant system in the world!\"\r\n\r\nI remembered the leader in the _Irish Catholic_, which sings a pæan of\r\ntriumph over alleged successes against the Freemasons of Italy.\r\nBritish Masons may be interested to learn that this authority couples\r\nthem with Atheists, Fenians, and Ribbonmen, and holds up the craft to\r\ncontumely and scorn. The acceptance by Mr. Gladstone of the principle\r\nof Home Rule seems to rejoice the Papist heart. \"Never was it more\r\nclear than it now is that the indestructible Papacy exercises an\r\nauthority over the hearts and minds of humanity which nothing, neither\r\nfraud, nor oppression, nor misrepresentation, can weaken or destroy.\r\nHow near may be the day of its inevitable triumph no man can say,\r\nwhile that its coming is as certain as the rising of the morning sun\r\n... none will doubt or deny. That in the moment when the Vicar of\r\nChrist is vindicated before the nations, and the reign of right and\r\ntruth and justice re-established throughout Christendom, Ireland can\r\nclaim to have been faithful when others were untrue, will be the\r\nproudest trophy of an affection which no temptation and no tyranny was\r\never able to weaken or destroy.\" The Freemasons are expressly stated\r\nto lie under \"the terrible penalty of excommunication,\" but they are\r\nafterwards lightly dealt with. They are regarded with an amused\r\ntolerance by Irish Catholics, who only laugh to see them \"hung with a\r\nnumber of trumpery glass and Brummagem metal trinkets about their\r\npersons, and generally indulging in an amount of fantastic and\r\nchildish adornment which would turn the King of the Cannibal Islands\r\ngreen with envy.\" Their profanation of God's holy name and their\r\nsacrilegious oaths are regretted, but they will never do much harm in\r\nIreland, where the people laugh at their \"fantastic tomfoolery.\" A\r\nparallel column advises the public to join in the present pilgrimage\r\nto Saint Patrick's Purgatory, where the saint saw, by special favour\r\nof God, the purgatorial fires. Another column advertises prayers at\r\nfixed prices--a reduction on taking a quantity. The men who hold these\r\nbeliefs and opinions are the sole governors of Irish action, the sole\r\ncreators of Irish opinion. For the lay agitators who from time to time\r\nhave dared to oppose the clerics have been mostly suppressed, and the\r\nfew still in existence will probably disappear before long. Colonel\r\nNolan must hold this opinion, for when canvassing in Headford, the\r\nparish priest came up and cut his head open with a bludgeon. The\r\ngallant militarian submitted to this, and would fain have passed the\r\naffair in silence. How many Englishmen would have stood it? This\r\nincident, properly considered, should enlighten Britons on the\r\ndominant influences of Irish Parliamentary action.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Dundalk I met Major Studdert, of Corofin, County Clare.\r\nHe spoke of the disturbed state of the district, and thought the\r\npresent condition of things scandalous and intolerable. He mentioned\r\nthe case of Mr. J. Blood, who has been four times fired at for\r\ndismissing a herdsman. He said:--\"Mr. Blood is universally admitted to\r\nbe one of the most amiable and benevolent of men. His herdsman had a\r\nson who would not work, and who was reckoned one of the greatest\r\nblackguards in the county, which is saying a good deal in County\r\nClare. Mr. Blood told him to send away this son, or he himself must\r\nleave his situation. He refused, and Mr. Blood discharged his\r\nherdsman, but with an extraordinary liberality gave him one hundred\r\npounds as consolation money. Since then Mr. Blood is everywhere\r\nprotected by four policemen. One of the bullets aimed at him passed\r\nbetween his back and the back of the chair he was sitting in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have only one argument for the country folks who talk of Home Rule.\r\nI challenge them to show me a single industrious man in the whole\r\ncountry who is not well off. They can't do it. What Ireland wants is\r\nnot Home Rule but industry. When they are at work they do not go at it\r\nlike Englishmen. I go over to Cheshire every year for the hunting\r\nseason, and it is a treat to see the English grooms looking after the\r\nhorses. They pull off their coats and roll up their sleeves in a way\r\nthat would astonish Irishmen. It is worth all they get to see them at\r\nwork. They get twice as much as Irish grooms, and they are worth the\r\ndifference. The people around me, the working people, do not perform\r\nfive months' work in a year.\"\r\n\r\nAnd these are the people who are surprised at their own poverty, and\r\nwho monopolise the attention of the British Parliament, which toils in\r\nvain to give them an Act which will improve their worldly position.\r\nThe Irish farmer is petted and spoiled, and a victim of\r\nover-legislation. Do what you will you can never please him. Mr.\r\nWalter Gibbons, of South Mall, Westport, told me of a case which came\r\nunder his own observation, as follows:--Rent, five pounds a year.\r\n_None_ paid for seven years. Tenant refused possession. Landlord paid\r\ntenant twenty pounds in cash, and formally remitted all the rent,\r\nthirty-five pounds to wit.\r\n\r\n\"I saw the money paid,\" said Mr. Gibbons, a fine specimen of the\r\nBritish sailor, present in the Cornwallis at the bombardment of\r\nSebastopol.\r\n\r\n\"And was the landlord shot?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Not that I know of,\" said the old sailor.\r\n\r\nMost people will agree that if ever a landlord deserved shooting this\r\nwas the very man.\r\n\r\nThe walls of Dundalk were placarded with a flaming incitement to\r\nIrishmen to meet in the Labourers' Hall at eight o'clock, to \"join in\r\nthe onward march to freedom.\" The meeting was to be held under the\r\nauspices of the Irish National Federation--Featheration, as the\r\nParnellites call it and most of its members pronounce it--and\r\ntherefore it was likely to be a big thing, especially considering the\r\nParliamentary tension existing at the present moment. I determined to\r\nbe present, To beard the lion in his den, The Douglas in his hall; to\r\nsee the labouring Irish in their thousands marching onward to Freedom.\r\nA friend attempted to dissuade me from the project. \"You'll be spotted\r\nin a moment, and as you are very obnoxious to the priests, to be\r\nrecognised at such a meeting might be unpleasant.\" A public official\r\nwho pointed out the place followed me up with advice. \"Unless you are\r\nconnected with the party, it would be better to keep away. These\r\npeople are very suspicious.\" These were fine preliminaries of a public\r\nmeeting. The building is poor, but not squalid, and seems to have been\r\nbuilt within the last few years. A gateway leads to the yard and the\r\nHall blocks the way. All the rooms are small, and I looked in vain for\r\nanything like an assembly chamber. Two roughish-looking men, who\r\nnevertheless had about them a refreshing air of real work, stood at\r\nthe gateway, and from them I learned that the meeting would take place\r\nupstairs. Twenty-four steps outside the building almost gave me pause.\r\nAt the top was an open landing, whence the Saxon intruder might be\r\nprojected with painful results. Trusting in my luck, I entered a\r\nnarrow corridor, some fifteen feet long, with doors on each side, and\r\none at the opposite end. That must open on the assembly room. No, it\r\nonly led to another flight of outside steps, and here it was\r\ncomforting to observe that the drop might be into the soft soil of a\r\ngarden, instead of a bricked yard. But where was the great meeting?\r\n\r\nOnce more I left the Hall and spoke my rugged friends. Yes, it was\r\nafter eight, but the people wanted a bit of margin. Half-past eight\r\nwas the time intended. Half-an-hour's march around, and back again.\r\nThe crowd was swelled from two to three persons. Fifteen minutes more,\r\nand further inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"When will the meeting begin.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the people comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they're an hour late already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure ye can't hurry thim.\"\r\n\r\nAt 9.15 I went again.\r\n\r\n\"Meeting begun yet?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Just startin' now. The praste's afther goin' in.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're rather unpunctual.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah, how would we begin widout his Rivirince!\" This was\r\nunanswerable. Once more into the breach, up the lonely shivery steps.\r\nThis time I heard voices, and opening a door found a narrow room with\r\nabout twenty people therein. The show was just agoing to begin, for,\r\nas I entered, somebody proposed that the Priest should take the chair.\r\nA short, stout, red faced man, with black coat and white choker,\r\nseemed to expect no less, and moved into the one-and-ninepenny Windsor\r\nwith alacrity. He spoke with the vilest, boggiest kind of brogue, and\r\nthe hideous accent of vulgar Ulster; calling who \"hu\" with a French u,\r\nshould \"shoed,\" and pronouncing every word beginning with un as if\r\nbeginning with on--ontil, onless, ondhersthand, ondhertake. \"Ye'll\r\nexcuse me makin' a spache, fur av I did I'd make a varry bad one,\"\r\nsaid the holy man, and the audience seemed to believe him. Enrolment\r\nwas the order of the day, and the thousands were requested to come\r\nforward. A man next me went to the front and paid a shilling,\r\nreceiving in return a green ticket, with Ireland a Nation printed at\r\nthe top. He twirled it round and round, and seemed disappointed to\r\nfind there was nothing on the other side. The secretary encouraged the\r\nmeeting by the official statement that the local Featheration now\r\nnumbered nearly sixty members, whereat there was great rejoicing, the\r\nmasses (to the number of twenty) working off their emotion by thumping\r\ntheir heels on the floor. The meeting, after this exultant outburst,\r\ngot slower and slower, and threatened to expire of inanition. Divil a\r\nmother's son could be got to shpake a single wurud. Some malevolent\r\ninfluence overhung the masses. His Rivirince sent down a messenger to\r\nme with the request that I would say a few wuruds. Declined, with\r\nthanks, as being no speaker. Uncertainty as to my colour and object\r\nstill prevailed; and silence, not loud, but deep, succeeded this\r\nartful feeler. Father O'Murtagh (or words to that effect) to the\r\nrescue! The Rivirind Gintleman arose and delivered a bitter attack on\r\nParnell, whom he characterised as mean, base, untruthful, treacherous,\r\nand contemptible. The foinest pisintry in the wuruld could not be\r\nsoiled by contact with anybody like Parnell, and therefore the\r\nCatholic bishops had been compelled to give him up, and to say, Get\r\nthee behind me, Satanas. The dear Father did not tell the meeting why\r\nthe bishops waited sixteen days after the verdict of the Court, and\r\nuntil Mr. Gladstone had delivered judgment, before deciding to cut\r\nParnell adrift. Father O'Murtagh (I think that was the name) made some\r\nallusion to the present crisis of public affairs--(he called it\r\ncresses)--and assured his masses that the Tories were about to be for\r\never plucked from the pedestal on which they had long been planted by\r\nascendency and greed! This was not so racy as the mixed metaphor of a\r\nGalway paper, which assures its readers that \"the Unionist party will\r\nsoon be compelled to disgorge the favouritism which for so long has\r\nbeen centred in their hands;\" but it might pass. His Rivirince made\r\nsome feeble jokes, and the audience tried to laugh, but failed. \"They\r\nsay that whin we luck at ourselves in the lucking lass, we see nothin'\r\nbut Whigs,\" said the funny Father, and the audience sniggered. This\r\nwas his masterpiece. He finished with \"It's wondherful what a spache\r\nye can make whin ye have nothin' to say;\" and the masses sniggered\r\nagain. Ten minutes more of silence broken only by whispered\r\nconfabulations of the secretary and chairman, and I grew tired of\r\nobstructing the march to Freedom. I left the chair, the only one at my\r\nend of the room, with considerable regret. Part of the back, one\r\nupright, was still remaining, and although the thing had evidently\r\nbeen used in argument at some previous meeting, it hung together, and\r\ngood work might still have been done with the legs. A gentleman with a\r\ncomplexion like a blast furnace, and a facial expression which looked\r\nlike a wholesale infraction of the Ten Commandments, was smoking\r\nmoodily on the steps.\r\n\r\n\"Did ye injy the matein?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Thought it rather dead,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Faix, 'twas yerself that kilt it.\"\r\n\r\nI feared as much. What happened after I left no man will tell, though\r\ndoubtless the resolutions adopted by the twenty men sitting on the\r\nforrums of ellum would vibrate through the Empire, and shake the\r\nBritish monarchy to its iniquitous base. Irish meetings must be taken\r\nwith a grain of salt. A Westport man long drew fees for reports of\r\nmass meetings which never took place. Three or four Nationalists met\r\nin a back parlour, and their speeches, reported verbatim, rang through\r\nIreland. Gallant Mayo was praised as heading the charge of Connaught,\r\nand Westport was lauded for its public spirit. And all the while the\r\nWestport folks knew nothing about it. The Dundalk folks will doubtless\r\nbe equally astonished to learn that the cause is advancing so\r\npowerfully in their midst. This hole-and-corner meeting, waiting for\r\nthe priest, addressed by the priest, bossed by the priest, is a fair\r\nsample of the humbug which seems inseparable from the Irish question.\r\nA very short acquaintance with the country and its people is\r\nsufficient to convince any reasonable person that the whole movement\r\nis based on humbug, sustained by humbug, and is itself a humbug from\r\nbeginning to end. To see the English Parliament managed and exploited\r\nby these groups of low-bred and ignorant peasants, nose-led by\r\nignorant and illiterate priests, is enough to make you ashamed of\r\nbeing an Englishman. The country has come to something when Britons\r\ncan be worked like puppets by mean-looking animals such as I saw in\r\nthe Dundalk Labourers' Hall, where the only respectable thing was an\r\niron safe bearing the stamp of Turner, of Dudley. And this meeting, in\r\nstatus, numbers, and enthusiasm, was quite representative of\r\nNationalist meetings all over Ireland. The English people are waiting\r\nfor their turn while Papal behests are executed. John Bull stands hat\r\nin hand, taking his orders from Father O'Baithershin. The Irish say\r\nthat England is in the first stage of her decadence, and they say it\r\nwith some reason. England, the land of heroes, sages, statesmen, is\r\nthe mere registrar of the parish priest and his poor, benighted dupes.\r\nRaleigh, Cromwell, Burleigh, Pitt, Palmerston, are succeeded by Healy,\r\nMorley, Sexton, Harcourt, Gladstone. England is Ireland's lackey, and\r\nmust wait till her betters are served, must toil and moil in her\r\nservice, receiving in return more kicks than halfpence. Britannia is\r\nthe humble, obedient servant of Papal Hibernia. To what base uses we\r\nmay return!\r\n\r\nDundalk, July 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 43.--IN THE PROSPEROUS NORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a blessed change from dirt and poverty to tidiness and\r\ncomfort. After the West of Ireland the North looks like another world.\r\nAfter the bareheaded, barelegged, and barefooted women and children of\r\nMayo and Galway, the smartly-dressed people of Newry come as a\r\nsurprise. You can hardly realise that they belong to the same country.\r\nThere are no mud cabins here, no pigs under the bed, no cows tethered\r\nin the living room, no hens roosting on the family bedstead. The\r\npeople do not follow the inquiring stranger about, as in Ennis or\r\nTuam, where they seem to have nothing better to do. The Newry folks\r\nare minding their own business, and they have some business to mind.\r\nThree extensive flax spinning mills, two linen weaving factories, and\r\nan apron factory, give large employment to girls. There are several\r\nflour mills, some of them possessing immense power, and having the\r\nmost modern machinery. Two iron foundries of long-established\r\nreputation, two mineral water factories, salt works, stone polishing\r\nmills, seven tanneries, cabinet furniture manufactories, and\r\ncoachbuilding works cater for the town and surrounding district.\r\nGranite quarries of high repute, such as the Rostrevor green granite,\r\nexist in the vicinity, and are worked energetically, the products\r\nforming a valuable addition to the exports. The town is beautifully\r\nsituated on a continuation of Carlingford Lough, the choicest bit of\r\nsea around Great Britain. Thackeray says that if England possessed\r\nthis beautiful inlet it would be reckoned a world's wonder. Twenty\r\nmiles of winding sea running inland like a league-wide river,\r\nmountains on both sides, many of them wooded to the furthest height.\r\nRostrevor is a bijou watering place such as only France here and there\r\ncan boast. You walk on the cliff side, steep verdurous heights above\r\nand below, looking through tree-tops on the shimmering sea and the\r\npurple mountains beyond, for ten miles at a stretch, wondering why\r\nnobody else is there. Newry is encompassed by mountains, one range\r\nabove another. Even as the hills stand round about Jerusalem, so stand\r\nthe hills about Newry. A big trade is done with Liverpool and Glasgow\r\nby means of the Dundalk and Newry Packet Company's fine service of\r\nboats. For this inland place has been made into a thriving seaport,\r\nand these Northerners make the water hum. At low tide the artificial\r\ncutting of the navigation works looks unpromising enough, but the\r\npeople of these parts would be doing business if they had to float\r\nthe boats on mud. The hills are cultivated to the topmost peak, or\r\nplanted with trees where tillage is impossible. The people seem to\r\nhave made the most of everything. They are digging, hammering,\r\nchopping, excavating, building, mining, and generally bustling around.\r\nThey break up the mountains piece-meal, and sell the fragments in\r\nother lands. To make you buy they show you how it looks when polished,\r\nand they are ready to earn an extra profit by polishing all you want\r\nby steam power. The streets are clean, well-paved, kept in perfect\r\norder. The houses are well-built and far superior to the English\r\naverage. A little cockney from 'Ackney, who has sailed the six hundred\r\nand seventeen miles between London and Cork and has explored most of\r\nthe South and West, is quite knocked over by Newry. Leaning on the\r\n\"halpenstock\" with which he was about to tackle Cloughmore, he\r\nconfessed that Newry hupset his hideas of Hireland and the Hirish.\r\n\"The folks round 'ere,\" he said, \"are hexactly like hus.\" He would\r\nhave accorded higher praise, had he known any.\r\n\r\nWhy this great difference? Look around the shop-keepers' signs in\r\nTipperary or Tuam and note the names. Ruane, Magrath, Maguire,\r\nO'Doherty, O'Brien, O'Flanagan, O'Shaughnessy, and so _in sæcula\r\nsæculorum_. In Newry you see a striking change. Duncan, Boyd, Wylie,\r\nMacAlister, Campbell, McClelland, McAteer, and so on, greet you in all\r\ndirections. You are in one of the colonies. The breed is different.\r\nYou are among the men who make railways, construct bridges, invent\r\nengines, bore tunnels, make canals, build ships, and sail them over\r\nunknown seas. You are among a people who have the instincts of\r\nachievement, of enterprise, of invention, of command, who depend upon\r\nthemselves, who shift for themselves, and believe in self-help rather\r\nthan in querulous complaint. The Newry folk belong to Ulster, where as\r\na whole the people can take care of themselves. A careful perusal of\r\nthe addresses presented to Lord Houghton on his current Viceregal tour\r\naccentuates the difference in the Irish breeds. The aborigines all\r\nwant to know what is going to be done for them. We want a pier, we\r\nwant a quay, we want a garrison or a gunboat to spend some money in\r\nthe district. Will your Excellency use your influence with the powers\r\nthat be to get us something for nothing? And let it be something to\r\nenrich us, or at least to keep us alive without work. We can't be\r\nexpected to do anything while groaning 'neath the cruel English yoke.\r\nThe Newry folks, and all of their breed, abstain from whining and\r\ncadging. The Westport people have endless quarries of hard blue\r\nmarble, which they are too lazy, or too ignorant, or both, to cut. The\r\nUlster breed would have quarried, polished, exported a mountain or two\r\nlong since. The universal verdict of employers of labour proves that a\r\nnorthern Irishman is worth two from any other point of the compass,\r\nwill actually perform double the amount of work, and is, besides,\r\nincomparably superior in brains and general reliability. The worthless\r\nhordes who approach the Viceroy with snuffling petitions are\r\ninvariably headed by Father Somebody, without whose permission they\r\nwould not be there, and without whose leave they dare not raise the\r\nfeeble and intermittent cheers which here and there have greeted the\r\nQueen's representative. The lying expressions of loyalty referred to\r\nin a previous letter are severely censured by the Nationalist papers.\r\nOne of the leading lights says: \"Judging from a sentence in the\r\naddress presented by the Mullingar Town Commissioners to the\r\nLord-Lieutenant on Thursday last, it would appear that these gentlemen\r\nare looking forward eagerly to the day when they can write themselves\r\ndown West Britons. This is what they said: 'In your presence as the\r\nrepresentative in this island of her Most Gracious Majesty Queen\r\nVictoria, we wish to give expression to our fealty to the throne,\r\nconvinced as we are that the day will soon be at hand when we can with\r\nless restraint, and in a more marked manner, testify our admiration\r\nfor the Sovereignty of the British Isles.'\" The more sincere newspaper\r\nwhich falls foul of these expressions goes on to say:--\r\n\r\n\"It is true that Ireland is described in the map made by Englishmen as\r\none of the British Isles, but it is not so written in the true\r\nIrishman's heart, _and never will be_, in spite of the toadyism of\r\ngentlemen like the Town Commissioners of Mullingar.\"\r\n\r\nThis pronouncement embodies the sentiments of every Nationalist\r\nIrishman. The Union of Hearts is not expected to succeed the Home\r\nRule, or any other bill, and to do Irishmen justice, they never use\r\nthe phrase, neither do they profess to look forward to friendliness\r\nwith England. I have conversed with hundreds of Home Rulers, and all\r\nlooked upon the bill as a means of paying off old scores. The tone of\r\nthe Nationalist press should be enough for sensible Englishmen. Nobody\r\nwho regularly reads the leading Irish Separatist papers can ever\r\nbelieve in the friendship supposed to be the inevitable result of the\r\nproposed concession. Once the present agitation is crowned with\r\nsuccess, a tenfold more powerful agitation will at once arise. The\r\nIrish people will have more grievances than ever. Already they are\r\ncomplaining of insult and betrayal. And their reproaches are directed\r\nagainst the G.O.M. and his accomplices, or rather against Mr.\r\nGladstone and Mr. Morley, for they know as well as Englishmen know\r\nthat the rest count for nothing; that, in fact, they resemble the\r\nfaithful and unsophisticated baa-baa of whom we heard in our early\r\ninfancy. \"Mary had a little lamb, Whose fleece was white as snow, And\r\neverywhere that Mary went, The lamb was sure to go.\" This is the\r\nattitude of the English Gladstonian party, and the Irish people know\r\nit. A Home Ruler I met to-day disavowed loyalty except to Ireland, and\r\nasked what was the Queen and the rest of the British Royal pauper\r\nparty to him or to Ireland that he should be loyal? He said:--\r\n\r\n\"All interest is over here, whether among Nationalists or Unionist.\r\nThe fate of the bill affects us no longer. The new financial proposals\r\nare the last straw that breaks the camel's back. Where is the\r\nmanaging of our own affairs? Where does the Nationalism come in? And\r\nGladstone, in allowing himself to make in the first proposal a mistake\r\nof one thousand pounds a day, damaged his prestige as the framer of\r\nthe bill, and fatally damaged the bill itself. Anybody can now say\r\nthat if he was so grossly mistaken in an ascertainable matter like\r\nrevenue and figures he stands to be equally wrong (at least) in\r\nmatters which are not demonstrable, but which are at present only\r\nmatters of opinion and argument. I am not sure that he ever intended\r\nto give us any Home Rule at all. We are being fooled because we have\r\nno leader. The bill, as it stood at first, would never have been\r\nprepared for a man like Parnell. Gladstone dare not have done it. The\r\nwhole bill is a series of insults. As a reasonable, fair-minded man\r\nyou will not deny that. It purports to come from friends who confide\r\nin us, and yet every line bristles with distrust and suspicion. There\r\nis not one spark of generosity in the whole thing from beginning to\r\nend. Better have no bill at all. For as a business man, I foresee that\r\nthe passing of any such bill would lead to a complete upset of trade.\r\nWe should have a most tremendous row. The safeguards would only invite\r\nto rebellion. Tell a man he must not have something, must not do\r\nsomething, and that is the very thing he wants to do. He might not\r\nhave thought of it if you had not mentioned it; but the moment you\r\npoint it out, and particularise the forbidden fruit, from that very\r\nmoment he is inspired with a very particular wish for that above all\r\nthings. So with a nation. We want our independence. We want to do as\r\nwe like. Otherwise, why ask for a Parliament? Gladstone says, Yes, my\r\npretty dear, it shall have its ickety-pickety Parliament; it shall\r\nhave its plaything. And it shall ridy-pidy in the coachy-poachy too;\r\nall round the parky-warky with the cock-a-doodle-doo. But it mustn't\r\ntouch! Or if it touches it mustn't be rough, for its plaything will\r\nbreak so easily. We don't want this tomfoolery, nor to be treated like\r\nchildren. We want a real Parliament, and not one that can be pulled up\r\nevery five minutes by London. For if the English Parliament have the\r\npower to veto our wishes, where's the difference? We might have just\r\nas well stayed as we were. That's perfectly clear.\r\n\r\n\"So that I for one will be glad when the farce is over. The present\r\nbill at best was but a fraud, a tampering with the national sentiment.\r\nAnd I am beginning to think that we have no chance of a National\r\nLegislature until the coming of the next great Irishman. I am not so\r\ndisappointed or broken-hearted as you might suppose. For the prospect\r\nof an Irish Parliament under present auspices is not very enticing.\r\nThe country might be made to look ridiculous, and the thing, by\r\nbursting up in some absurd way, might make a repetition of the attempt\r\nimpossible for a century. I would rather wait for a better bill, and\r\nalso for better men to work it. We are not proud of the Irish members.\r\nBut we didn't want Tories, and all the propertied men are Tories. What\r\nwere we to do? We know the want of standing and breeding which marks\r\nmost of our men, but we did the best we could, and came within an ace\r\nof succeeding. Let me tell you the exact feeling of the respectable\r\nHome Rule party of Ireland at this moment.\r\n\r\n\"Having exerted ourselves with enthusiasm, and having undergone\r\nconsiderable pecuniary sacrifice with good chances of success, we now\r\nsee clearly that all our efforts are for the present thrown away. It\r\nis the fortune of war. The fates were against us, and we rest content\r\nwith the hope that we have furthered the ultimate success of the\r\nmovement. For the moment, we make our bow, and hope to call on Mr.\r\nBull at a more propitious season. Of course we expect to win in the\r\nend.\"\r\n\r\nThe next politician whose opinions I noted was a horse of quite a\r\ndifferent colour. He bore a Scottish name, and had the incisive,\r\nargumentative style of the typical Ulsterman, who unites the cold\r\ncommon-sense and calculating power of the Scot with the warmth and\r\nimpulse of the Irish nature. He said:--\r\n\r\n\"The bare existence of Belfast is, or should be, enough to negative\r\nall arguments in favour of Home Rule. The agitators say that Ireland\r\nis decaying from political causes, while all the while this Ulster\r\ntown is getting richer and more powerful and influential. While the\r\npeople of Cork are begging the Viceroy to please to do something for\r\ntheir port, to please to be so kind as to ask Mr. Bull to favour the\r\ncity with his patronage, the Belfast people, with a far inferior\r\nharbour, an inferior climate, an incomparably inferior position,\r\nsurrounded by far worse land, are knocking out the Clyde for\r\nshipbuilding, and running the Continent very close in linen-weaving.\r\nBelfast is actually the third in order of the Customs ports in the\r\nUnited Kingdom. The Belfast people flourish without Home Rule, and\r\nwhat is more, they know their neighbours. They've reckoned these\r\ngentry up.\r\n\r\n\"How is it that the Catholic population, as a rule, are merely the\r\nhewers of wood and drawers of water? They have precisely the same\r\nopportunities as their Protestant countrymen. Where-ever you go you\r\nwill find the Protestants coming to the top. Cork is a very bigoted\r\nCatholic city, and the huge majority of the population are Catholics.\r\nHow is it that most of the leading merchants are Protestants? Why do\r\nheretics flourish where the faithful starve? Transfer the populations\r\nof Cork to Belfast and _vice versâ_, and, as everybody knows perfectly\r\nwell, Belfast would at once begin to decay, while Cork would at once\r\nbegin to prosper. Therefore it is absurd to say that Home Rule would\r\ncure the poverty existing in Catholic districts. Yes, there is a party\r\nof ascendency. The Protestants are distinctly the party of ascendency.\r\nThey have the ascendency which ability and education and industry will\r\nalways have over incapacity and ignorance and laziness. Now, I know\r\nsomething about the linen trade, and also something about the growth\r\nand preparation of flax.\r\n\r\n\"Linen has made the North, and flax is grown in the North. But it\r\nwould grow much better in the South. If they would grow it we would be\r\nvery glad to buy it. But they won't. And why not? Because it needs\r\ncare and skill, and a lot of watching and management. The beggars are\r\ntoo lazy to grow anything that wants tending from day to day. It would\r\npay them splendidly, and the advantages of flax growing and dressing\r\nhave over and over again been drummed into them without effect. The\r\nclimate and soil of Southern Ireland are far more suitable for flax\r\ngrowing than the North, and as about three-quarters of all the flax\r\nwoven in Belfast is grown on the Continent, it is clear that the\r\nmarket is waiting for the stuff. The Belfast merchants have done all\r\nthat in them lay to bring about flax cultivation in the South. They\r\nhave sent out lecturers and instructors, they have planted patches and\r\ngrown the stuff, and shown the pecuniary results, and with what\r\neffect? Absolutely none. The people won't do anything their\r\ngrandfathers didn't do. They won't be bothered with flax, which wants\r\nno end of attention. Why, if they grew flax, they'd have to work\r\nalmost every day! And nobody who knows Irishmen, real Keltic Irishmen,\r\never expects them to do that, or anything like it. I've been in India,\r\nand I deliberately say that I prefer the Hindoo to the Southern\r\nIrishman for industry and reliability.\r\n\r\n\"These people, who are too lazy to wash themselves, expect their\r\ncondition to be improved by a Home Rule Parliament. Can anything be\r\nmore unreasonable or more unlikely? And because there are more of\r\nthem, their wishes are to be taken into account, and the opinions and\r\nwishes of men of whom each one is worth a hundred are to be\r\ndisregarded. Where is the English sense of the eternal fitness of\r\nthings?\r\n\r\n\"What the Irish really seek is some effective substitute for work.\r\nThey have no idea of developing the resources which lie nearest to\r\nthem. Carlyle says a country belongs to the people who can make the\r\nbest use of it, and not the people who happen to be found there.\r\nIreland for the Irish is a favourite cry. Why? Is not England for the\r\nIrish, America, Australia, New Zealand? My ancestors came here in the\r\ntime of Henry the Second, and I am told that I have no business in the\r\ncountry. Wherever English and Scots settlers have been located, there\r\nthe country is well worked and the people are thriving. If we can\r\nthrive, why can't they thrive? If we can get on without Home Rule, why\r\ncan't they get on without Home Rule? If it were going to be a good\r\nthing for the country we'd all be on it like a shot. If it were good\r\nfor them, it ought to be good for us. We have shown by our success\r\nthat our judgment is sound. Their failure in everything they\r\nundertake, their dirt, their general habits and character, should\r\ncause their statements and opinions to be looked upon with very great\r\nsuspicion. Does it stand to reason that merely by Home Rule, by the\r\nexercise of the privilege of making Irish laws by Irishmen in Dublin,\r\nthat these people would gain all we have attained by hard and honest\r\nlabour? That is what they expect up here.\r\n\r\n\"The Catholics are our servants, and in selecting them we seldom ask\r\ntheir religion. Our employés in most cases expect by the bill to take\r\nthe place of their masters. That is their conception of Home Rule.\r\nThey have been told from infancy that the British Government keeps\r\nthem down because of their religion. They know that the British\r\nGovernment is Protestant, and they believe that in some occult way the\r\nsuperior position held by the Protestants in Ireland is due to\r\nfavouritism. Under a Home Rule Parliament, that is, a Catholic\r\nParliament, this condition of things will be reversed, and they will\r\nat once, and by their own innate force, as faithful believers, spring\r\nto the top of the tree, and exchange positions with their former\r\nmasters and mistresses.\"\r\n\r\nThe general effect of my friend's discourse was well summed up by Mr.\r\nJames Mack, of Galway, who said:--\r\n\r\n\"When I see that the Belfast men who would make fortunes out of river\r\nmud, and who would skin a flea for his hide and tallow, turn their\r\nbacks on Home Rule, and declare they will have nothing to do with it,\r\nI feel sure it can be no good. Then my own experience and observation\r\nassure me that, instead of a settlement, it will only be the beginning\r\nof trouble for both countries. Firmness is wanted, and equal laws for\r\nall. At present everything is in favour of Ireland.\" _United Ireland_\r\nsays:--\"It would be better to go on for twenty years in the old\r\nmiserable mill-horse round of futile and feverish and wasting\r\nagitation than to accept this bill as a settlement of national claims.\r\nAnd if the bill passes now it cannot deflect the national agitation by\r\na hair's breadth, or cause its intermission for a day.\"\r\n\r\nNobody who knows the Irish people ever expected anything else.\r\nAgitators who live by agitation will always agitate, and only a few\r\nnamby-pamby Radicals ever thought otherwise. Those who would fain have\r\nsold their souls for the Newcastle Programme also stand to be taken\r\nin. This Home Rule Bill will not do. Another must be brought forward\r\nimmediately. Where is this dreary business going to end? When will Mr.\r\nGladstone consider that England has eaten dirt enough?\r\n\r\nNewry, July 4th\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 44.--THE PROSPEROUS NORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis famous historical city must be eminently offensive to Irish\r\nNationalists. It is so clean and sweet and neat and tidy that you can\r\nat once see the hopelessness of expecting Home Rule patriotism from\r\nthe place. There are no dunghills for it to grow in, and my somewhat\r\nextensive experiences have long ago taught me that Home Rule and\r\nNationalist patriotism will not flourish in Ireland without manure,\r\nand plenty of it. Anyhow, it is mostly associated with heaps of refuse\r\nand pungent odours arising from decomposing matter, and in the south\r\nand west is scarcely ever found flourishing side by side with modern\r\nsanitation. Home Rule not only, like pumpkins and vegetable marrows,\r\nrequires a feculent soil, but like them, and indeed like all watery\r\nand vaporous vegetables, it needs the forcing-frame. Left to its own\r\ndevices the movement would die at once. There is nothing spontaneous\r\nabout it. It is a weedy sort of exotic, thriving only by filth and\r\nforcing. It cannot live an hour in the climate of Armagh. The cold,\r\nkeen air of these regions nips it in the bud. The peculative patriots\r\nwho are now monopolising Westminster have from time to time made\r\ndescents on the district, to sow the good seed, as it were, by the\r\nwayside. But next day came a frost, a killing frost. The Northerners\r\nare too mathematical. They have taken Lord Bacon's advice. They \"weigh\r\nand consider.\" They want logic, and will not be content with mere\r\nrhetoric. They require demonstrations, and have opinions of their own.\r\nBefore accepting a theory they turn it round and round, and test it\r\nwith the square, the level, and the line. They care nothing for\r\noratory unless there is sense at the back of it. They know that fine\r\nwords butter no parsnips, and they know the antecedents of the\r\npatriotic orators. They do not believe that a paid Parliament-man is\r\nnecessarily a self-sacrificing patriot, and they note that Nationalist\r\nmembers are making their patriotism much more profitable than their\r\noriginal and legitimate pursuits, if any. The Armagh folks believe in\r\nwork, and in keeping things in order. The Scots element is dominant.\r\nNot so much in numbers, as in influence. The Kelts are easily\r\ntraceable, but the races are partly amalgamated, and the genuine Irish\r\nare greatly improved. I paraded the streets for many hours, but I saw\r\nno dirt, rags, wretchedness. It was market day, and the country people\r\ncame streaming in from all sides, everyone well dressed and\r\nrespectable, and in every way equal to the farmers and their wives who\r\non market days drive into Lichfield or Worcester. It was a pleasure to\r\nsee them, and my Cockney friend, quoted in the Newry letter, might\r\nhave been tempted to discard his affected superiority, and drawing\r\nhimself proudly up, to smite himself on the chest, and to say \"And hi,\r\ntoo, ham a Hirishman.\"\r\n\r\nThe country between Newry and Armagh is very beautiful from a pastoral\r\npoint of view. After the savage deserts of the West it \"Comes o'er my\r\nsoul like the sweet south That breathes upon a bank of violets.\" Every\r\nyard of ground is going at its best pace. The valleys stand so thick\r\nwith corn that they laugh and sing. Immense vistas of highly\r\ncultivated country unroll themselves in every direction. The land is\r\nrichly timbered, and tall green hedges spring up everywhere. You are\r\nreminded of Dorsetshire, of Cheshire, of Normandy, of Rhineland. The\r\npeople at the wayside stations are all well-dressed and well-shod.\r\nAchil Island seems to be at an immeasurable distance. The semi-savages\r\nwho in Mayo demand autonomy have no supporters here. The Ulster folks\r\neschew them and all their works, and would no more associate with them\r\nthan with Hottentots. I use the term because the Irish people have ten\r\nthousand times been told, and told untruthfully, that Lord Salisbury\r\nhad applied the term to the nation at large. The people of Mayo and\r\nsome other parts of Connaught are for the most part worthy of the\r\nname, if, indeed, it be not a libel on the Africans. The disgusting\r\nsavagery of their funeral customs is of itself sufficient to stamp\r\nthem as lowest barbarians. I am prepared to prove this to the hilt.\r\nLet their defenders come forward if they dare.\r\n\r\nAnd so it happens that the inhabitants of Armagh city are mostly\r\nConservatives. They ought to be religious, too, for they have not only\r\ntwo cathedrals and an archbishop, but also a cardinal archbishop, Dr.\r\nLogue, to wit. I saw this distinguished ecclesiastic at Newry. He wore\r\nthe scarlet robe, the extraordinary hat, the immensely thick gold ring\r\nof the cardinalate, in a railway carriage. An ordinary sort of man,\r\nwith the round face and mean features of the typical Keltic farmer. He\r\nholds that the people should take their political faith from their\r\npriests, but the Northerners hardly agree, and are not so proud of\r\ntheir cardinal as they should be, seeing that he has been raised from\r\nthe ranks, his father (so they say) having been Lord Leitrim's\r\ncoachman, and the coachman who was driving when Lord Leitrim was shot.\r\nThe Roman Catholic Cathedral of Armagh has an imposing position on the\r\nsummit of a steep hill. The portal is approached by sixty or seventy\r\nsteps in flights of five and ten with steep terraces between,\r\nextending over a great space, so that the flights of steps, seen from\r\nthe bottom of the hill, seem continuous, and have a fine Gustave Doré\r\neffect of vastness and majesty. On a neighbouring steep stands the\r\nProtestant Cathedral, with its sturdy square tower, memorial of remote\r\nantiquity. The city is piled up between the two cathedrals, but mostly\r\naround the heretic structure, and away from the Papist pile, which\r\nstands among the fields. The Presbyterians have a very beautiful\r\nchurch, apparently of the Armagh marble of which the city is built,\r\nthe perennial whiteness of the stone making the old place appear\r\neternally young. The market-place, behind the market-hall, and on the\r\nsteep slope to the Protestant Cathedral, was very busy indeed. Market\r\ngardeners were there with young plants, useful and ornamental, for\r\nsale. Home-made chairs with rushen seats were offered by their rural\r\nmakers. Wooden churns, troughs for cattle, and agricultural implements\r\nwere there galore. Crockery was artfully disposed in strategetical\r\ncorners, and gooseberry stalls were likewise to the fore. None of\r\nthese features are visible in the Western markets. A vendor of\r\nsecond-hand clothing stood on a cart well loaded with unconsidered\r\ntrifles, and this gentleman was especially interesting. A number of\r\npoor women stood around while the salesman, who knew his clientèle to\r\ntheir smallest tricks, displayed his wares and recklessly endeavoured\r\nto ruin himself for the good of the country. Holding up an article, he\r\nwould turn it round and round, expatiating on its excellent\r\nqualities, and then, after naming the very lowest price consistent\r\nwith common business principles, would run down the figure to\r\none-tenth or less, with a pause or two here and there for critical\r\ncomment on his audience, of which he professed to entertain the most\r\nunfavourable opinion. Then with a final thump, punching the article\r\ncontemptuously, he would offer it, regardless of consequences, for\r\nhalf his previous offer. Sometimes he refused to accept the money\r\nbecause the customer was not quick enough. Neither might the people\r\nexamine his goods. He was master, and more, and found his account in\r\nit. He took up a frowsy old gown. \"There ye are. Ten shillin's worth\r\nof stuff in that. An' ten for the makin'. An' that's twinty. I'll take\r\nten, an' I couldn't afford to take a penny less. Will ye have it?\r\nDon't all spake at once. Ye won't. But I'll make ye. I'll take five\r\nshillin', four, three, two, one, I'll take sixpence. (Thump.) Take it\r\naway. Here! Have it for thruppence.

Will ye be plazed to take what ye want\r\nfor nothin'? Tis charity ye want, ye poor misguided crathurs. 'Tis a\r\npack of paupers I'm discoorsin', God help me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Armagh shopkeepers are prosperous and content. \"No Home Rule,\"\r\nthey say. They are no longer angry with the Nationalists. The snake is\r\nscotched, if not killed outright, they think. The whole absurdity has\r\nreceived such a damning exposure that it cannot be revived for another\r\ngeneration. The Separatist party will be perforce compelled to wait\r\nuntil the people have forgotten what Home Rule really means.\r\nTherefore, to work again! Useless to waste more time. Ulster will\r\nsleep with one eye open, bearing in mind the favourite Northern saying\r\nwhich advises men to put their trust in Providence, but to keep their\r\npowder dry. For, like the Achilese, they believe that prayer is\r\neffective in shaving, only the Ulstermen prefer to pray over a keen\r\nrazor. A genial citizen of Armagh said:--\r\n\r\n\"We would be as ready for Home Rule as any other Irishmen if it meant\r\nwhat we are asked to believe it means. But we know better. We are\r\nconvinced that it will bring, not prosperity and peace, but bankruptcy\r\nand war, intolerance and social retrogression, robbery and spoliation,\r\nnot only of the landlord but also of everybody else who has anything.\r\nThe propertied Roman Catholics are just as dead against Home Rule as\r\nany Protestants. Only they dare not say so.\r\n\r\n\"England ought to have sense enough to see that instead of freedom\r\nfrom Irish difficulties, the old grievances will be intensified, and\r\nany bill whatever will at once generate a fresh series of\r\ncomplications, so that the English Parliament will be crippled in\r\nperpetuity, to the detriment of British interests. The Empire, as a\r\nwhole, must be weakened, because the Irish masses are most unfriendly,\r\nand the more England concedes the more unfriendly Ireland becomes. For\r\nIreland regards all concessions as being wrung from England by\r\nsuperior force and skill, and as being, in short, the fruits of\r\ncompulsion. Therefore, the more Ireland gets the more exacting she\r\nwill always become. Ask any Englishman or Scotsman resident in Ireland\r\nif the Irish masses are friendly, and everyone will laugh at you. The\r\nEnglish Home Rule party say, 'Just so. Let us cure this. This is the\r\nprincipal argument for Home Rule.' They think this sounds very fine.\r\nJust as if in private life, a man to whom you have given his due, and\r\nmore than his due, should continue to abuse you, while you strain\r\nevery nerve to satisfy him, and go out of your way to obtain peace and\r\nquietness, he all the time becoming more and more exacting and more\r\nand more discontented. And then as if you were to say, 'I must\r\ncontinue my concessions, my efforts, my sacrifices. I _must_ contrive\r\nto satisfy this amiable person.' What a fool any man would be to adopt\r\nsuch a course. A sensible man would say 'You have your due, and you'll\r\nget no more.' Treat Ireland so, and all will be well. Be firm and the\r\ntrouble will amount to nothing. Paddy will soon drop shouting when he\r\nsees it has no effect. The agitators will soon dry up, or waste their\r\nsweetness on the desert air. But so long as there is a prospect of\r\nsuccess, so long as you have a weak-kneed old lunatic in power, so\r\nlong as Paddy sees a prospect of obtaining substantial advantages,\r\nsuch as reduction of rent or rent-free farms, so long the row will be\r\nkept up. If Englishmen could only realize that, the whole movement\r\nwould cease. For Gladstonian Englishmen mistakenly think that they can\r\nsettle the thing by further concession and get to their own business.\r\nFew of them care for Home Rule on its own merits. They want Ireland\r\nout of the way. They are going the wrong way about it. To give this is\r\nto give everything. And let me tell you something new. Once the bill\r\nbecomes law, and the exactions of a Home Rule Government were enforced\r\nby England a great part of Ulster would in pure self-protection, being\r\nno longer bound to England by the ties of loyalty, sympathy, and\r\nmutual dependence--a great part, practically the whole of Ulster,\r\nwould box the compass and go in for complete independence, as the best\r\nthing possible under the circumstances. England would then feel\r\nsomething in her vitals, something serious and something astonishing.\r\nThe only rebellion that ever gave England any trouble was worked by\r\nUlstermen. The most effective agitators have nearly always been\r\nrenegade Protestants. Let England think what she is about before she,\r\nat the bidding of a foolish old man, turns her back on her faithful\r\nfriends to throw herself into the arms of her sworn enemies.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Conservative, for I met none other in Armagh, said:--\"Surely\r\nthe minority are worth some consideration. There are one million two\r\nhundred thousand loyal Protestants, and certainly many thousand Roman\r\nCatholics, who are against the Bill. As Sir George Trevelyan said, 'We\r\nmust never forget that there are two Irelands,' and as John Bright\r\nsaid, 'There are more loyal men and women in Ireland than the whole\r\npopulation of men and women in Wales.' Yet Mr. Gladstone is so very\r\nconsiderate of Wales. Ireland can point to fully one-third of the\r\nentire population, who view with abhorrence the very name of Home\r\nRule, and are pledged to resist it to the last. These people have been\r\nand are the friends of England, and England can be proud of them as\r\nhaving flourished under her rule. They have been and are the English\r\ngarrison in Ireland, and England sorely needs a garrison here. Mr.\r\nGladstone cares nothing for their opinions. On the other hand, he\r\nspends his life in pandering to disloyal Ireland, led by men who have\r\nopenly avowed and gloried in their hatred of England, and who have\r\nhundreds of times publicly declared their determination to secure\r\ncomplete independence; men who have broken the law of the land, and\r\nhave incited others to break it; men who turned a peaceful country\r\ninto a perfect hell, and have for ever upset the people's notions of\r\nhonesty. Parnellites and anti-Parnellites have only one end and aim,\r\nand only one sentiment. They hate British rule and British loyalists,\r\nand aim at the ultimate repeal of the Union, and the absolute\r\nseparation of the two countries. And they would always be unfriendly.\r\nThe party of lawlessness, outrage, and rebellion would never hold\r\namicable relations with a law-abiding and peaceful commercial country.\r\nThere would be no peace for Ireland either. The factions of the Irish\r\nparty are yearly becoming more and more numerous. In all except hatred\r\nto England they are bitterly opposed. All very well to set up Ulster\r\nas being the ugly duckling, as being the one dissentient particle of a\r\nunited Ireland. If every Protestant left the country Ireland would\r\nstill be divided, and hopelessly divided. Personal reviling, riot, and\r\nblackguardism are already common between the factions, united though\r\nthey try to appear, so far as is necessary to deceive the stupid\r\nSaxon. And if the Saxon cannot see the result of trusting the low\r\nblackguards who form the working plant of the Nationalist party he is\r\nstupid indeed, and deserves all that will happen to him.\r\n\r\n\"Have you noticed how the Irish people are gulled?\"\r\n\r\nYes, I have noticed it. The _Freeman's Journal_, as the representative\r\npaper of the party and the chosen organ of the Church, is run on a\r\npabulum of falsehood. Englishmen would hardly believe such lying\r\npossible, but the _Freeman_, as a liar, has, by constant practice,\r\nattained virtuosity. What Rubinstein is on the piano, what Blondin was\r\non the tight-rope, what the Bohee Brothers are on the banjo, what Sims\r\nReeves was in the ballad world, what Irving is in histrionic art, what\r\nSpurgeon was as a preacher, what Patti is in opera, what Gladstone is\r\nas a word-spinner, what Tim Healy is as a whipping-post, what the\r\nIrish peasant is as a lazybones, what Harcourt is as a humbug, what\r\nthe member for Kilanyplace is as a blackguard, so is the _Freeman's\r\nJournal_ as a liar. When quoting great masters examples of their work\r\nare always interesting.\r\n\r\nThe late Chamberlain-Dillon episode is fresh in the minds of all\r\nnewspaper readers. Dillon wanted the date. The date was given him. He\r\npromised to answer the charge, but anybody can see that no answer was\r\npossible. He failed to come up to time. Being lugged to the front by\r\nthe scurf of the neck, he explained that he _had_ used the words,\r\nnamely, that when the Irish party got power they would remember their\r\nenemies, but--much virtue in But--he used the words under the\r\ninfluence of exasperation arising from the Mitchelstown affair--which\r\ntook place a year later!\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain pointed this out, and referring to this incident the\r\n_Freeman_ says:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chamberlain literally grew pale under the succession of\r\nexposures, and wriggled in his seat, while he attempted to meet them,\r\nnow by wriggling equivocations, now by reckless denial.\" \"Mr. Goschen,\r\nprompted by Mr. Bolton,\" horrified the _Freeman's_ delicate taste by\r\n\"jocose allusions to watertight compartments and to the vessel's\r\ntoppling over, which grated horribly on the members of the House, with\r\nthe memory of the recent terrible calamity fresh in their minds.\" I\r\nwas in Dublin when the news of the Victoria disaster arrived, and I\r\nheard a typical Nationalist express a wish that the whole fleet had\r\nperished. Such sentiments are the natural result of the lying\r\nliterature provided by the \"patriot\" press of Dublin and the\r\nprovinces. Well may Home Rule opinion in Ireland be rotten through and\r\nthrough! Mirabeau said of a very fat man that his only use was to show\r\nhow far the skin would stretch without bursting. The _Freeman_ exists\r\nto show to what lengths human fatuity can go. Lying and slander and\r\nall uncleanness, envy and hatred and malice and all uncharitableness,\r\nare its daily bread. With Home Rule in Ireland, this sheet would be\r\nthe ruling power. To support Home Rule is for the _Freeman_ to breathe\r\nits native air. Under an Irish Parliament, nutriment \"thick and slab\"\r\nwould abound, and the patriot print would wax in strength and stature\r\nday by day. Enlighten the popular mind, and the _Freeman's_ hours are\r\nnumbered. It would vanish as a dream, forgotten by all except some\r\nold diver into the history of the past, who having read its pages,\r\nwill shake his head sadly when he hears of Liars, and remembering its\r\nParliamentary notes will say--\r\n\r\n\"There were Giants in those days.\"\r\n\r\nArmagh, July 6th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 45.--A PICTURE OF ROMISH \"TOLERATION.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe country from Armagh to Monaghan is a very garden of Eden,\r\nundulating, well wooded, well watered, and in a high state of\r\ncultivation. The intervening towns and villages are neat and sweet,\r\nand the people seem to be hard workers. Monaghan itself, during the\r\nlast generation, has wonderfully improved. It suffers by reason of its\r\nposition on an almost inaccessible branch line, and the complete\r\nabsence of manufactories, but it has no appearance of poverty. The\r\nDiamond is a well-built square, and the whole town, mostly built of\r\nstone, some of the streets on terraces, many of them thickly planted\r\nwith trees, has a shady and sylvan look. The gaol, an enormous\r\nbuilding crowning a steep hill, looks like the capitol of a fortress,\r\nand appears to have exercised a salutary effect on the neighbourhood,\r\nfor it has long been disused. The district did not furnish malefactors\r\nenough to make the establishment pay. The gaol officials stood about\r\nwith folded hands wishing for something to do, and probably locked up\r\neach other in turn by way of keeping up a pretence of work. The\r\ngovernor had nothing to govern, and the turnkeys sighed as they\r\nthought of old times. The thing was growing scandalous, and the\r\never-diminishing output of convicts marked the decadence of the\r\ncountry. Day by day the officials climbed to the topmost battlement in\r\nthe hope that rural crime-hunters might be descried bringing in some\r\nturnip-stealer, some poacher, some blacker of his neighbour's eye, and\r\nday by day these faithful prison-keepers sadly descended to renew the\r\nweary round of mutual incarceration, so necessary if they wished to\r\nkeep their hands in, and to apply somebody's patent rust-preventer to\r\nthe darling locks, which formerly in better times they had snapped\r\nwith honest pride. At last the authorities intervened, discharged the\r\nturnkeys, and locked up the place. It was a case of _Ichabod_. The\r\nfine gold had become dim and the weapons of war had perished. The\r\nofficials departed in peace, each vowing that the country was going to\r\nthe Divil, and each convinced that such a state of things would never\r\ncome to pass under Home Rule. All became earnest Nationalists in the\r\nsure and certain hope that under an Irish Parliament business would\r\nrevive, that the old place would be re-opened, that its venerable\r\nwalls would again re-echo the songs of happy criminals, that the\r\noakum-picking industry would revive and flourish, and that the\r\ntreadwheel (which they identify with the weal of the country) would\r\ncontinuously revolve. Meanwhile, Armagh extends hospitality to stray\r\nwrong-doers and Monaghan boards them out to the manifest injury of the\r\nlocal turnkey industry.\r\n\r\nThe new Roman Catholic Cathedral is said to be the finest in Ireland.\r\nIt was over thirty years in building, and although the stone of the\r\nmain fabric cost nothing, the structure cost more than a hundred\r\nthousand pounds. The interior is more gorgeous than beautiful, and the\r\nmoney seems to have been expended with execrable taste. The marble\r\nmosaic of the chancel floor is beautifully done, the work having been\r\nentrusted to Italian workmen, who were engaged on it for several\r\nyears. The numerous statues of Carrara marble are well executed, and\r\nother items are also of the best. But the effect of the whole is\r\ninharmonious, and the great lines are obscured by over-ornamentation.\r\nYou are reminded of an over-dressed woman. The pulpit, surmounted by a\r\nlofty conical canopy richly gilt, is supported on four lofty pillars\r\nof coffee-coloured marble highly polished. The baldacchino is a\r\nglittering affair, forty or fifty feet high, and big enough for a\r\nmission church. This also rests on marble columns. The sacristy,\r\nchapter-house and other offices are splendidly furnished, and the\r\nfurniture of the doors, brass branches spreading all over them,\r\nmassive as mediæval work, were remindful of Birmingham. The oak\r\ndrawers of the robing room contain sacerdotal raiment to the tune of\r\ntwo thousand pounds, and the banners, many in number, and of richest\r\nwork, must also represent a small fortune. Beautiful oil paintings\r\nfrom Italy hang around, and the bishop's throne is a marvel of gold\r\nlace and luxury. A queer-looking utensil, like a low seat, but with\r\nround brass bosses at each corner, proved to be merely a sort of\r\ncrinoline whereon the bishop might extend his robes, so as to look\r\ninflated and imposing. So does the noble turkey-cock extend himself\r\nwhen bent on conquest of his trustful mate, gobbling the while\r\nstrange-sounding incantations. To describe in detail would require a\r\nbook. The confessionals are snug, with rich external carving. Plenty\r\nof accommodation for penitents here. Amid such surroundings to be a\r\nmiserable sinner must be indeed a pleasure. The spire is two hundred\r\nand fifty feet high. I mounted and saw the great bell, over three tons\r\nin weight. I also saw the bishop's robes of wondrous richness and\r\npenetrative virtue, the consecrated slippers which the acolytes wear,\r\nwith their scarlet robes, remindful of Egyptian flamens and African\r\nflamingoes; the blessed candle-box and the seven-times blessed\r\ncandles, which at once drop tallow on the holder's clothes and benison\r\non his sin-struck soul. All this expense in poor Ireland, all these\r\nadvantages for poor Ireland. And still the Irish are not happy. With\r\nRoman Catholic cathedrals on every hand, with monasteries, nunneries,\r\nseminaries, confraternities, colleges, convents, Carmelites, Christian\r\nbrothers, and collections whichever way they turn, the Irish people\r\nshould be content. What could they wish for more?\r\n\r\nThe principal shopkeepers of Monaghan have unpatriotic names.\r\nCrawford, Jenkins, Henry, Campbell, Kerr, McEntee, Macdonald, and\r\ntheir like must in some way be accountable for the smartness of the\r\ntown and for the emptiness of the prison on the hill. And you soon see\r\nthat the Cathedral was needed, for besides the Protestant church, the\r\ntown is polluted by two Presbyterian churches, to say nothing of a\r\nschism-shop used by the Wesleyan Methodists. A Monaghan man said:--\r\n\r\n\"The respectable people are nearly all Protestants, and all the\r\nProtestants, and most of the respectable Catholics, if not all, are\r\nUnionists. In point of numbers the Catholics have the pull, and in the\r\nevent of a Home Rule Parliament, which, God forbid, our position as\r\nProtestants would be no longer tenable. We should have to knock under,\r\nand to become persons of no consideration. The small farmers among the\r\nProtestant population would have an especially hard time of it. They\r\nmostly held aloof from the Land League and such-like associations; and\r\nwhen the other party get the upper hand they will have to smart for\r\nit. What Mr. Dillon said about remembering in the day of their power\r\nwho had been their enemies, is always present to the minds of the\r\nlower classes of the Irish people. It is that they may have the power\r\nof punishing all sympathisers with England that some of them say they\r\nwant Home Rule. No doubt they have other temptations, but certainly\r\nthat is one great incentive. So keenly are they bent on getting power\r\nthat they in some cases quite disregard any possible disadvantages\r\naccruing from the success of the movement. 'Let us get the power,'\r\nthey say, 'never mind the money.' I have heard the remark made more\r\nthan once, and it represents the dominant feeling in the minds of\r\nmany. Rubbish about struggling for equal rights. Where are the\r\ndisabilities of Irish Catholics?\r\n\r\n\"Ascendency is their game. Would they be tolerant? Why ask such a\r\nquestion? When was Roman Catholicism tolerant, and where? Is not the\r\nwhole system of Popery based on intolerance, on infallibility, on\r\nstrict exclusiveness? Let me give you a few local facts to show their\r\n'tolerance.'\r\n\r\n\"In the old times the Monaghan Town Commissioners were a mixed body.\r\nCatholics and Protestants met together in friendly converse, and the\r\nvoting went anyhow, both religions on both sides, according to each\r\nman's opinion of the business. Nowadays, wherever in Ireland the two\r\nsects are represented the thing is worked differently, and you may\r\nknow the voting beforehand by reference to the members' religion. We\r\nare not troubled with this in Monaghan, and for the very best of\r\nreasons--all the members but one are Roman Catholics, and the solitary\r\nProtestant is a lawyer who has always been identified with them, and\r\nhas always managed their legal business. He is practically one of\r\nthemselves, having always acted with them.\r\n\r\n\"When the modern political agitation became rife, the Romans of\r\nMonaghan, under the orders of their priests, at once ousted all\r\nProtestants, except the one I have mentioned, who does not count, and\r\nmonopolised the Town Council ever since. They forgot something--Lord\r\nRossmore has a claim on the market-tolls and other similar payments\r\nwhich amount to about three hundred pounds a year, but so long as the\r\nTown Council was worked by a mixed body of Catholics and Protestants\r\nhe consented to forego this claim, and made the town a present of the\r\nmoney, which was expended in various improvements. Three hundred a\r\nyear is a large sum in a small country town where labour is cheap, and\r\nin fifty years this sum, carefully laid out in ornamental and sanitary\r\narrangements, quite changed the aspect of the place. When, however,\r\nthe priests came on the scene and determined to have things\r\nexclusively in their own hands, Lord Rossmore did not quite see why he\r\nshould any longer give the money to the town. And let it be understood\r\nthat his agent had always been a prominent figure on the Monaghan Town\r\nCouncil, which was very right, having regard to the three hundred\r\npounds given by Lord Rossmore, and to the agent's superior knowledge\r\nand business experience. He had been kicked out with the rest, and so\r\nit was made known that in future my lord would keep the money in his\r\nown pocket. They were astonished and suddenly cast down. 'Fear came\r\nupon them, and sorrow even as upon a woman,' &c.--you know the text.\r\nThey said the money belonged to them, and really they had had it so\r\nlong that they might be excused for believing this. Lord Rossmore was\r\nfirm. They fought the thing out; but where was the good? They were\r\nbeaten at every point. They had no case. So the town is three hundred\r\npounds a year worse off, and Lord Rossmore three hundred pounds\r\nbetter. And still they will not allow a Protestant on the Council,\r\nalthough nearly all the best business men are of that persuasion.\r\nHow's that for tolerance? And if such a thing be done in the green\r\ntree what will be done in the dry? If they flog us now with whips,\r\nwon't they flog us then with scorpions?\"\r\n\r\nAnother thraitor to his counthry's cause, said:--\"A great idea with\r\nthe priests is this--to get hold of the education of the country. They\r\ndo not like the present system of National education. They do not\r\napprove of their youthful adherents growing up side by side with\r\nProtestant children. At first the Catholic bishops welcomed the scheme\r\nof National education, but now they are averse to it. They have seen\r\nhow it works. It goes against them. It has been weighed in the balance\r\nand found wanting. The Catholic children grew up in amity with their\r\nneighbours, and got dangerously liberal ideas on the subject of\r\nreligion. They were getting to believe that it mattered little whether\r\nCatholic or Protestant so long as a man's life was right. I went to\r\nschool with Catholics, grew up with them, was always friendly with\r\nthem, and we keep up the friendship to this day. The Catholic bishops\r\ndisapprove of this. They want the line of cleavage sharp and distinct.\r\nFifty years ago mixed marriages were common enough. Such a thing never\r\nhappens now-a-days. It is most stringently forbidden by the Catholic\r\nChurch. A priest told me that emigrants to America, such as had been\r\neducated in Irish National schools, along with Protestant children,\r\nwere very apt to drop their Romanism when once separated from their\r\nnative parish, and to become Protestants. I suppose he meant to say\r\nthat long familiarity with the unclean thing had undermined the\r\nwholesome dislike of heresy which every Catholic should feel, and that\r\ntherefore such familiarity should be, if possible, avoided. Years ago\r\nthe priest would be friendly with his Protestant neighbours. We all\r\nlived together pretty comfortably. Of late a great change has taken\r\nplace. The clergy as far as possible leave us, and cause us to be\r\nleft, out in the cold. The question of Home Rule is entirely a\r\nreligious question. Parnell was actuated by what might fairly be\r\ncalled patriotism; that is, comparatively speaking. The clergy saw in\r\nhis fall a grand opportunity to use the movement he had created for\r\nthe furtherance of their own ends. Home Rule is a purely Roman\r\nCatholic movement, and has had the most regrettable results on the\r\namity of neighbours everywhere. Formerly the question of religion\r\nnever arose. Now nothing else is considered. The Papists are almost\r\nunbearable, while they as yet have only the hope of power. What they\r\nwould become if once they grasped the reality God only knows. I am not\r\nprepared to stand it, whatever it be. My arrangements to leave the\r\ncountry have long been made. At my age it will be a great grief, but I\r\nhave always lived in a free country, and I will die in a free country.\r\nI was born in the town, and hoped to end my days at my birthplace. But\r\nI shall go, if it almost broke my heart, rather than see myself and\r\nthe worthy men who have made the place domineered over and patronised\r\nby Maynooth priests. _Ubi bene, ibi patria._ Where I'm most happy,\r\nthat will be my country.\"\r\n\r\nThe road to Kilmore is through a beautiful park-like country heavily\r\ntimbered with oak, ash, beech, chestnut, and fir. Tall hedgerows\r\ntwenty feet high line most of the way, which in many parts is\r\ncompletely overhung with trees in green arches impervious to rain. The\r\ncountry is undulating, with sharp descents and long clumps of beeches\r\nand imposing pine woods, bosky entrances to country seats and grassy\r\nhills, covered with thriving kine. From the church itself an extensive\r\nlandscape is seen on every side. A deep valley intervenes between the\r\nchurch and a pretty farmhouse. I find a narrow lane with high hedges,\r\ncovered with honeysuckles, which seems to lead thitherward. A man is\r\ntoiling in a field hard by, digging for dear life, bare-armed and\r\nswarthy. I mount the gate and make for him. He remains unconscious,\r\nand goes on digging like mad. His brow is wet with honest sweat, and\r\nhe seems bent on earning whate'er he can. Perhaps he wishes to look\r\nthe whole world in the face, having an ambition to owe no rent to any\r\nman. I woke him and asked why the flags were flying on Kilmore\r\nsteeple.\r\n\r\n\"To the pious, glorious, and immortal memory of William of Orange, who\r\ngave us an open Bible, and delivered us from Popery brass money, and\r\nwooden shoes. We put them up on the first of July and fly them till\r\nthe twelfth, when we walk in procession through Monaghan.\"\r\n\r\n\"An Orangeman, and a black Protestant, I fear?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed merrily, and said he was proud and thankful to be both. \"If\r\nwe didn't hold together, and associate in some way, we might quit the\r\ncountry at once. By banding together we hold our ground, and we will\r\ndo so until Home Rule comes on us. Then we'll have to give in, about\r\nhere. We're in a minority.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think the Papists would be tolerant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye! Toleration indeed. As tolerant as a cat to a mouse. As\r\ntolerant as I am to this thistle, bad scran to it,\" said my friend,\r\nfetching up the obnoxious weed with a vigorous stroke, and chopping it\r\nto pieces with the spade, after which he shovelled it to the bottom of\r\nthe trench. \"Why, sir, the Papists are beginning to assume mastership\r\nalready. Before this Government had been a fortnight in office the\r\ndirty scum began to give themselves airs. I mean, of course, the\r\nlowest of them. They were not so civil as before. Tolerant, ye say!\r\nSure anybody that heard ye say the like of that would know ye were a\r\nstranger in the counthry.\"\r\n\r\nThe farm house was a model of cleanliness and neatness, James Hanna a\r\nmodel of a hard-working, debt-paying, honourable farmer. The living\r\nrooms had every accommodation required for the decent bringing-up of a\r\nfamily; and the parlour, with its carpets, knick-knacks, and\r\nhighly-polished solid furniture, showed both taste and luxury. Mrs.\r\nHanna, a buxom lady of middle age, was hard at work, but for all that,\r\nthe picture of comeliness and neatness. The children were just coming\r\nin from school, well clad and good-looking, the boys ruddy and strong,\r\nthe girls modest and lady-like. Mr. Hanna was hard at it in some\r\ncontiguous field, but he came round and told me that he held twenty\r\nacres of land, that the rent was £24 10s., that his father had the\r\nfarm for more than fifty years, that he was a Protestant, a Unionist,\r\nand a strong opponent of Home Rule. I have visited two other farms of\r\nthe same size in Mayo and Achil, both held by Catholic Home Rulers.\r\nThe rent of the Achil farm described by its holder, Mr. McGreal, as\r\n\"very good land,\" was seventeen-and-sixpence for the whole twenty\r\nacres. McGreal was very poor, and looked it. His house was of the type\r\ndescribed in my previous letters. Mr. James Hanna pays more for each\r\nacre than McGreal for his whole farm, and yet the Kilmore man is\r\nprosperous, his house, his family, all his belongings suggestive of\r\nthe most enviable lot. A gun was hanging over the fire-place, which\r\nwas a grate, not a turf-stone. I asked him if he used the\r\nshooting-iron to keep his landlord in order. He said No, he was no\r\nhunter of big game. I may be accused of too favourable an account of\r\nthis farmhouse and its inmates, but I have (perhaps somewhat\r\nindiscreetly) given the name and address, and Monaghan people will\r\nagree with me. A more delightful picture of Arcadia I certainly never\r\nsaw. Cannot Englishmen reckon up the Home Rule agitation from such\r\nfacts as these, the accuracy of which is easily ascertainable by\r\nanybody? Everywhere the same thing in endless repetition. Everywhere\r\nlaziness, ignorance, uncleanliness, dishonesty, disloyalty, ask for\r\nHome Rule. Everywhere industry, intelligence, cleanliness, honesty,\r\nloyalty, declare that to sanction Home Rule is to open the floodgates\r\nto an inrush of barbarism, to put back the clock for centuries, to put\r\na premium on fetichism, superstition, crime of all kinds, to say\r\nnothing of roguery and rank laziness. What are Englishmen going to do?\r\nWhich party will they prefer to believe? When will John Bull put on\r\nhis biggest boots and kick the rascal faction to the moon?\r\n\r\nMonaghan, July 8th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 46.--A BIT OF FOREIGN OPINION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe military call and spell the name Inniskilling, which corruption is\r\nprobably due to the proverbial stupidity of the brutal Saxon, and is\r\nundoubtedly another injustice to Ireland. The Inniskilling Dragoons\r\nhave won their fame on many a stricken field, and to them the town\r\nowes any celebrity it may possess. From a tourist's point of view it\r\ndeserves to be better known. It is a veritable town amidst the waters,\r\nand almost encircled by the meandering channels that connect Upper and\r\nLower Lough Erne. It consists almost entirely of one long, irregular,\r\nbut tolerably-built street, at both ends of which you cross the river\r\nErne. A wooded knoll, crowned by a monument to Sir Lowry Cole, who did\r\ngood service under Wellington, is a conspicuous object, and through\r\nopenings purposely cut through the trees, affords some very pleasing\r\nviews. A hundred steps lead to the top, and the ascent repays the\r\nclimb. The Cuilgach range, source of the Shannon, the Blue Stack\r\nmountains of Donegal, the ancient church and round tower of Devenish,\r\nan island in the Great Lough Erne, and due west the Benbulben hills,\r\nare easily visible. Devenish island is about two miles away, and,\r\nalthough without a tree, is very interesting. Some of the Priory still\r\nremains, and I have found a Latin inscription in Lombardic characters\r\nwhich, being interpreted, reads Mathew O'Dughagan built this,\r\nBartholomew O'Flauragan being Prior, A.D. 1449. There is a graveyard\r\nnext the ruins, and a restored Round Tower, eighty-five feet high, not\r\nfar away, the door of which is ten feet from the ground. These towers\r\nare sprinkled all over the country, and in nearly all the door is\r\neight feet to twenty feet from the ground. The process of eviction\r\nseems to have been present to the minds of the builders. The sheriffs'\r\nofficers of a thousand years ago must have been absolutely powerless\r\nin presence of a No Rent manifesto. Steamers are running on the Lower\r\nLough from Enniskillen to Belleek, about twenty-two miles. You can\r\nsail there and back for eighteen-pence. The Upper Lough is said to be\r\nstill more beautiful, the tourist agents have recently been trying to\r\nopen up this lovely island-studded lake. The beauties of Ireland are\r\nas unspeakable as they are unknown. The strip of sea holds some\r\ntourists back, and others seek the prestige of holiday on the\r\nContinong. A German traveller, hight Bröcker, declares that Ireland\r\nbeats his previous record, and that the awful grandeur of the Antrim\r\ncoast has not its equal in Europe, while the wild west with its heavy\r\nAtlantic seas, is finer far than Switzerland. Germans are everywhere.\r\nThe Westenra Arms of Monaghan boasted a waiter from the Lake of\r\nConstanz, and I met a German philologist at Enniskillen who had his\r\nown notions about Irish politics. He ridiculed the attitude of\r\nEngland, or rather of Gladstonian England, and rated Home Rulers\r\ngenerally in good set terms.\r\n\r\n\"The business of England is to rule Ireland. Justly, of course, but to\r\nrule. That is if England has any regard for her own reputation. A\r\ncolonel must rule his regiment, a teacher must rule his class, the\r\ncaptain must rule his crew, or disorder and damage to all parties will\r\nbe the inevitable result. England stands to her acquisitions, whether\r\nconquered or peacefully colonised, in the relationship of head of the\r\nfamily. She has one member who is troublesome. There is always one\r\nblack sheep in the flock. There was a Judas among the twelve. England\r\nhas one, only one, at present, of her numerous family who gives\r\nextraordinary anxiety. And why?\r\n\r\n\"Difference of race and difference of religion. The double difference\r\nis too much. The races would amalgamate but for the religious\r\ndifference. They would intermarry, and in time a sufficient mixture\r\nwould take place; would have taken place long since but for the action\r\nof Rome. Rome keeps open the old wound, Rome irritates the old sores.\r\nRome holds the two nations apart. We in Germany see all this quite\r\nplainly. We have no interests at stake, and then, you know, lookers-on\r\nsee better than players. Rome keeps Ireland in hand as a drag on the\r\nmost influential disseminator of Protestantism in the world. Ireland\r\nsuits her purpose as a backward nation. We have quite snuffed out the\r\nPope in Germany. Education is fatal to the political power of Rome.\r\nIreland is not educated, and suits her purpose admirably. You will not\r\nsucceed in satisfying Ireland, because Rome will not allow the Irish\r\nto remain quiescent. Rome will not permit Ireland to rest and be\r\nthankful, to fraternise with England, to take the hand of friendship,\r\nand to work together for good. This would not do for the Church. Any\r\nRomish priest will tell you that his Church is destined to overspread\r\nand conquer every country in the world, and that of all possible\r\nevents that is a thousand times the most desirable. An independent\r\nIreland, whose resources would be in the hands of the Romish Clergy,\r\nand whose strategetical position would be the means of aiding some\r\nCatholic power to crush the prestige of England--that is not a\r\npossibility too remote for the imagination of Romish wirepullers. Are\r\nEnglishmen acquainted with the history of Papal Rome? Have they\r\nadequate knowledge of the subtlety, the craft, the dissimulation, the\r\nforesight of this most wonderful religious system? I think not, or\r\nthey would be more on their guard against her Jesuitical advances. The\r\nidea of your Gladstone going to your Parliament to hand over this\r\ncountry to Rome under the specious pretence of remedying Irish\r\ngrievances, is too ridiculous. I ask myself where is the English\r\ncommonsense of which we have heard so much in Germany?\r\n\r\n\"England must be master. Not with tyranny; of that there is no danger,\r\nbut with a judicial firmness. Your system of party government has good\r\npoints, but it has weak points, and the Irish make you feel them. You\r\npay too much attention to Irish clamour. I have been partly living in\r\nEngland for twenty-two years, and I have seen your Gladstone 'finally'\r\ncontenting the Irish three or four times. Now, if he understood the\r\nsubject at all, he ought to know that for the reason I have stated\r\nsatisfaction is impossible. No use healing and dressing a wound which\r\nis constantly re-opened. No use in dressing a sore which is\r\ndeliberately irritated. Rome will keep England going. With your Home\r\nRule Bills, your Irish Church Bills, your successive Land Bills, how\r\nmuch have you done? How far have you succeeded in pacifying Ireland?\r\nAre you any nearer success now than ever you were? On the other hand,\r\ndoes not appetite grow with what it feeds on? The more you give, the\r\nmore they want. They are far more discontented than they were before\r\nthe passage of the three Land Bills, by each of which your Gladstone,\r\nyour amusing Gladstone, declared he would pacify and content the\r\nIrish. And now your Gladstone is at it again. Funny fellow! He is like\r\nthe Auctioneer with his Last time, for the Last time, for the very\r\nLast time, for the very _very_ Last time. And the grave English nation\r\nallows itself to be made a sport. It is mocked, derided, by a number\r\nof lawyers' clerks and nonentities from third-rate Irish towns. It is\r\nbullied by a handful of professional politicians, paid by your\r\nAmerican enemies, and governed by the flabby-looking priests you see\r\nskulking about the Irish railway stations and parks and pleasure\r\nresorts. As I said before, England must be master, as the captain is\r\nof his crew, as the tutor of his class, as the colonel of his\r\nregiment; or she will go down, and down, and down, until she has no\r\nplace nor influence among the nations. And she will deserve none, for\r\nshe knew not how to rule.\r\n\r\n\"England is at present like a ship's captain, who in his futile\r\nendeavours to please one of his crew first neglects the management of\r\nthe ship, and, then (if she grants Home Rule) allows the discontented\r\nperson to steer the course. And all to please one silly old man, who\r\nshould long ago have retired from public life. What man at eighty-four\r\nwould be reckoned competent to manage a complicated business\r\nenterprise such as a bank, or an insurance business, or a big\r\nmanufacturing affair, or a newspaper office? Yet you allow Gladstone\r\nto manage an Empire! Where, I ask is the English sense, of which we\r\nhear so much in Germany? You want a Bismarck to make short work of\r\nthese Popish preachers of sedition. You want a Bismarck to rid your\r\ncountry of the Irish vermin that torment her. The best Irishmen are\r\nthe most brilliant, polite, scholarly men I ever met. None of them are\r\nHome Rulers. That should be enough for England without further\r\nargument. Your House of Lords has sense. That will be your salvation\r\nagainst Gladstone and Rome.\"\r\n\r\nAt the _Imperial_ was a warm discussion anent the propriety of keeping\r\nalive the memory of the Battle of the Boyne, which the Orangemen\r\ncelebrate with great pomp on July 12. \"The counthry's heart-sick of\r\nOrange William an' his black-mouths,\" said a dark-visaged farmer. By\r\nblack-mouths he meant Protestants.\r\n\r\n\"The blayguards are not allowed to shout To Hell wid the Pope\r\nnow-a-days. In Belfast they'd be fined forty shillin's. An' they know\r\nthat, and they daren't shout To Hell wid the Pope, so they roar To\r\nHell wid the Forty Shillin's. That's what I call a colourable evasion.\r\nBut the law favours them.\"\r\n\r\nA man of mighty beard looked on the speaker with contempt. \"Sure, 'tis\r\nas raisonable to celebrate King William, who _did_ live as a Saint\r\nlike Patrick, Phadrig as ye call him, who never existed at all. At\r\nlaste, that's what some of them say. Ye mix the life an' work of\r\nhalf-a-dozen men, an' ye say 'twas all Saint Patrick. Sure, most of\r\nhim is a myth, a sort of a fog, jist. Ye can't agree among yerselves\r\nas to whin he was born.\" Turning to me, the bearded man said, \"Did ye\r\never hear the pome about Saint Patrick's birthday?\"\r\n\r\nI regretfully admitted that the masterpiece in question had escaped my\r\nresearch, but pleaded in extenuation that I came from England, where\r\nthe rudiments of polite larnin' and the iliments of Oirish litherature\r\nhave not yet permeated the barbarian population. Barbatus then recited\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"On the eighth day iv March, as sum people say,\r\n    St. Patrick at midnight he furst saw the day.\r\n    While others declare on the ninth he was born,\r\n    Sure, 'tis all a mistake between midnight and morn!\r\n    Now, the furst faction fight in Oireland, they say,\r\n    Was all on account of St. Patrick's birthday.\r\n    Some fought for the eighth, for the ninth more would die--\r\n    Who didn't say right, they would blacken his eye.\r\n    At length both the parties so positive grew,\r\n    They each kept a birthday, so Patrick got two.\r\n    Till Father Mulcahy (who showed them their sins)\r\n    Said, No man can have two birthdays (barrin' he was twins).\r\n    An' boys, don't be fightin' for eight or for nine;\r\n    Don't be always disputin', but sumtimes combine.\r\n    Combine eight wid nine, seventeen is the mark,\r\n    Let that be his birthday.\" \"AMEN,\" said the clerk.\r\n    \"Tho' he wasn't a twin, as history does show--\r\n    Yet he's worth any other two saints that we know.\r\n    So they all got blind drunk, which complated their bliss,\r\n    An' they kept up the custom from that day to this.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' why wouldn't we remimber King William? An' why wouldn't we\r\nremimber that the Enniskillen Protestants went out an' smashed up the\r\nPapists under Lord Mountcashel, at Newtownbutler, on August 1, 1689?\r\nThe very day of the relief of Derry--so it was. An' more than ever now\r\nwe need to keep our heads above wather. Ye've an old fule over there\r\nthat's thryin' to upset the counthry wid his fulery an' his Home Rule.\r\nBut we'll not have it! Never will we bow the neck to Rome. In the name\r\nof God, we'll resist to the last moment. Every man will stand to his\r\narms. Leave us to settle with the Papists, and we'd hunt them like\r\nflies. Thim an' their Army of Independence! 'Twas an' Army of\r\nIndependence they levied to help the French invasion. The poor\r\nparleyvoos landed at Killala (ye can see where they entrenched their\r\ncamp), and marched with the Irish Army of Independence to Castlebar,\r\nwhere the English smashed them up, the Irish Catholic levies bolting\r\nat first fire or before it.\" Four or five nameless stones mark the\r\ngraves of French officers killed in this engagement. I saw them on my\r\nway from Castlebar to Turlough's Tower. My Orange friend went\r\non:--\"We'll send a hundred Orangemen to fight their Army of\r\nIndependence. They shall be armed with dog-whips, to bring the brutes\r\nto heel. No, we'll not send a hundred, either. We'll send thirty-two,\r\none for each county of Ireland. 'Twould be a trate to see the Army of\r\nIndependence hidin' thimsilves in the bogs, an' callin' on the rocks\r\nan' hills to fall down an' cover thim, an' the airth to swallow them\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\nA political tradesman recommended to me as a perfect encyclopædia of\r\nargument on the Home Rule question, said:--\"The great difficulty is to\r\nget the English people to understand the duplicity of this sacerdotal\r\nmovement. Of course, you understand that the agitation is really\r\nreligious, and not, strictly speaking, political at all. In England\r\nthe Romish priests are a better class of men, and no doubt they are\r\nloyal enough for practical purposes. And then they have neither\r\nnumbers nor influence. You look upon the Catholic laity of England\r\nvery much as we look upon the Plymouth Brethren of Ireland--that is,\r\nas a well-meaning, well-conducted body of people with whom you don't\r\nagree. The Catholic laity of Ireland would be all right if they were\r\nleft alone, if they were allowed to follow the dictates of their\r\nnatural humanity. My Catholic neighbours were very good, none better,\r\nuntil this accursed agitation began. Left to themselves the Irish\r\npeople would agree better and better every year. But that would not\r\nsuit Rome. The Church, which is very astute, too much so for England,\r\nsees in agrarian agitation a means of influence and the acquisition of\r\npower; and once an Irish Parliament became dominant, intolerance would\r\nmake itself felt. Not as of old by the fires and tortures of the\r\nInquisition, for nineteenth-century public opinion would not stand\r\nthat; and not by manifestly illegal means either, but by boycotting,\r\nby every species of rascality. How can you expect tolerance from a\r\nchurch the very essence of whose doctrine is intolerance? When\r\neverybody outside the pale of that Church is outside the pale of\r\nsalvation, condemned beforehand to eternal damnation, anything and\r\neverything is permissible to compel them to come in. That is their\r\ndoctrine, and they, of course, call it benevolence.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone has said,--'My firm belief is that the influence of\r\nGreat Britain in every Irish difficulty is not a domineering and\r\ntyrannising, but a softening and mitigating influence, and that were\r\nIreland detached from her political connection with this country and\r\nleft to her own unaided agencies, it might be that the strife of\r\nparties would then burst forth in a form calculated to strike horror\r\nthrough the land.' There is the passage, in my scrap-book. The speech\r\nwas made in the House. The English Home Rulers believe that their\r\ntroubles will be over when once Irishmen rule from College Green, and\r\nthey trust the Irish Catholic members, who from childhood have been\r\ntaught that it is not necessary to keep faith with heretics. That is a\r\nfundamental tenet of the Church of Rome. Still, England will have no\r\nexcuse for being so grossly deceived, for these men have at one time\r\nor other been pretty candid. William O'Brien said that the country\r\nwould in the end 'own no flag but the Green Flag of an independent\r\nIrish nation,' and J.E. Redmond in March last said that it was the\r\nutmost folly to talk of finality in connection with the Home Rule\r\nBill. Then you must remember what Parnell said about taking off his\r\ncoat. He would not have done it for anything short of independence.\r\nMr. Gladstone himself saw through this, and with all other Liberals\r\nconsistently and determinedly opposed every demand for Home Rule until\r\nhis desire for power compelled him to surrender unconditionally to\r\nParnell. At Aberdeen the G.O.M. said,--'Can any sensible man, can any\r\nrational man, suppose that at this time of day we are going to\r\ndisintegrate the great capital institutions of the country for the\r\npurpose of making ourselves ridiculous in the eyes of all mankind?' No\r\nsane man ever supposed it, no honest man ever believed that Mr.\r\nGladstone would ever sell himself to Irish traitors for a short period\r\nof power. The thing was incredible. In another speech Mr. Gladstone\r\nsaid he would never consent to give Ireland any principle which could\r\nnot be given on equal terms to Scotland or any other part of the\r\nKingdom. So we may expect Scotch and Welsh Home Rule bills after this,\r\nand then a separate Parliament for every country that wants it.\r\nThere's the speech, you can copy the reference.\r\n\r\n\"England is like an old-established business with a shop over the way\r\nwhich only just pays, and is an awful lot of trouble; in fact, more\r\ntrouble than it's worth. You might say, let it go then. But if you let\r\nit go somebody else will take it, and run in opposition. Home Rule\r\nmeans the immediate return of the Irish-American ruffians who were\r\nhere during the Fenian agitation, or their successors. Home Rule means\r\nthat armed rebellion can be organised with much more reasonable\r\nchances of success. The police will be under the control of traitors,\r\nand it took you all your time to keep the country in order when the\r\npolice were in your own hands. Whatever happens to John Bull will be\r\nthe proper reward of his asinine stupidity. He'll have his hands full,\r\nwith an Irish Parliament against him. And if he gets a big quarrel on\r\nhis hands with Russia or France, or any other powerful military\r\nnation, that is the time he'll feel it. Are you going to put into the\r\nhands of your enemies the power to ruin you merely by biding their\r\ntime?\"\r\n\r\nI saw several other Enniskilleners, but they added nothing to the\r\ndisquisitions of those already quoted. A feeling of deep disgust was\r\nthe prevailing sentiment. Encamped in the enemy's country, from\r\nchildhood conversant with the tortuous windings of Papal policy, and\r\nthe windy hollowness of the popular cries, they stand amazed that\r\nEnglishmen can be deceived by such obvious imposture, that they will\r\nlisten to such self-convicted charlatans, that they will repose\r\nconfidence in such ten-times-exposed deceivers. The history of the\r\nHome Rule movement will in future ages be quoted as the most\r\nextraordinary combination of knavery, slavery, and credulity the world\r\nhas ever seen. And yet some Englishmen believe in it. After all, this\r\nis not so wonderful. There were people who believed in Cagliostro,\r\nMormon Smith, Joanna Southcote of Exeter, Mrs. Girling, the Tichborne\r\nClaimant, General Boulanger, electric sugar, the South Sea Bubble, and\r\na thousand other exploded humbugs. No doctrine could be invented too\r\nabsurd for human belief. No impostor would fail to attract adherents,\r\nexcept through lack of audacity. Thousands of people believe in the\r\nwinking virgin of Loretto, and tens of thousands, a few months ago,\r\nwent to worship the holy coat of Tièves. So people are found who vote\r\nfor Home Rule as a means of settling the Irish Question, and rendering\r\njustice to Ireland. _Populus decipi vult._ Doubtless the pleasure is\r\nas great, In being cheated as to cheat.\r\n\r\nEnniskillen, July 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 47.--THE LOYALISTS AND THE LAWLESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nClones, which must be pronounced as a dissyllable, is a city set upon\r\na hill which cannot be hid. Viewed from the railway the clustered\r\nhouses surround the church spire like an enormous beehive. Like other\r\nancient Irish towns, it possesses the ancient cross, the ancient round\r\ntower, and the ancient abbey, without which none is genuine. It has\r\nnot the sylvan, terraced, Cheltenham-cum-Bath appearance of its\r\nneighbour Monaghan, though it somewhat resembles Bath in its general\r\noutline. The ruins want tidying up, and no doubt they will be looked\r\nafter when the demand is greater. Ruins are a drug in Ireland, and as\r\nMark Twain would say--most of them are dreadfully out of repair. The\r\nIrish have no notion of making them attractive, of exploiting them, of\r\nturning an honest penny by their exhibition. The inhabitants of any\r\ngiven neighbourhood can never give information as to their date, use,\r\ndecay, general history, beyond the stereotyped \"They were built by the\r\nowld ancient folks long ago.\" The Clones people are no exception to\r\nthe general rule. The town is on the main line from Dublin to\r\nLondonderry, but is little troubled by tourists. The place is quiet\r\nand tidy enough, and like many other Irish country towns seems to live\r\non the surrounding country, which sends in a strong contingent on\r\nmarket days. The people are also quiet, civil, and decent, and the\r\nland in the neighbourhood seems fertile and well cultivated. Industry\r\nis evident on every side. Everybody has something to do. A farmer\r\nliving just outside the town said he experienced the greatest\r\ndifficulty in getting extra hands for harvest time. In his opinion the\r\npeople were incomparably better off than in the days of his youth,\r\nsome thirty years ago. He said \"The labouring classes are far better\r\nhoused, better clothed, and better fed, than in old times. They live\r\nfar better than the well-to-do farmers of a generation ago. And the\r\nqueerest thing about it is the fact that the better off they are, the\r\nmore discontented they seem; and during the last few months they are\r\nbecoming unbearable. They are giving themselves airs in advance. And\r\nno wonder, when they see the British Parliament entirely occupied with\r\ntheir affairs, to the exclusion of all English business. They may well\r\nfeel important. They boast that they have compelled this attention,\r\nand that they shortly will have their own way in everything. Last\r\nSunday a drunken fellow was making a row near my house. I told him to\r\ngo away, and he said, 'Before long you'll have to go away and every\r\nBlackface in the country. We'll be masters in another month.' He was\r\nalluding to Mr. Gladstone's gagging motion, which the poor folks here\r\nin their ignorance believe to mean that Home Rule will set in about\r\nthe beginning of August. They are acting accordingly, and they expect\r\nto have the land which the Protestant farmers now hold--at once. It is\r\nto be divided amongst them by ballot. We feel very anxious about here,\r\nfor we feel that we are only staying on sufferance, and we have no\r\nconfidence in the support of the present Government. We have expended\r\nour labour and our substance on the land, and if we lose these we lose\r\nall. You may say there is no fear of that, as such a piece of iniquity\r\nwould never be tolerated by the English people. But when I see them\r\ntolerating so much, I think we have good reason to feel uneasy and\r\nunsettled. For my part, I have no heart for hard work, when I feel\r\nthat somebody else may reap the reward. And with a Catholic Parliament\r\nin Dublin we should very soon have to give up. They can get at the\r\nfarming class in so many ways. We Protestants are pretty strong about\r\nhere, and all the way to Monaghan, but still we are in a considerable\r\nminority. The mountain folks are Catholics, every one, and that is\r\nwhere we are outnumbered. We could hold our own if the country were\r\nlike the town. We should be bound under Home Rule to suffer a large\r\nincrease of taxation, because all grants from Imperial sources are to\r\ncease upon the passing of the bill. Then the country will be more\r\ndisturbed than over, because the bill is only valued as a\r\nstepping-stone to an Irish Republic, and the success of the agitators\r\nin obtaining the bill will encourage them and their supporters to\r\npersevere. Instead of the end of the trouble it would only be the\r\nbeginning. It is a black look-out for both Ireland and England.\r\n\r\n\"Most of the Protestant farmers think that land purchase would be\r\nstopped. If that could go steadily on, there would be in time\r\nprosperity and contentment. The people would like this well enough,\r\nand would be quiet enough, if they were let alone. But where is the\r\nmoney to come from to purchase land? Who would lend money on Irish\r\nsecurities? Who would trust an Irish Parliament with millions? Then\r\nthe better classes, who have money to spend, would leave the country,\r\nand we should be poorer all round.\r\n\r\n\"The loyal party in an Irish Parliament would always be in a minority,\r\nand for any good they could do, might as well stay away. For no matter\r\nhow the Nationalist factions might quarrel among themselves, the\r\npriestly party would always have the pull. The English Protestants\r\nought to believe that we know the reality of the danger that threatens\r\nus better than they can possibly do. There are nearly three thousand\r\nProtestant ministers in Ireland, and only six or seven are in favour\r\nof Home Rule. Are these men all infatuated? Are they all liars? Are\r\nthey in a position to know the facts? Of course they are truthful men,\r\nand they understand if anybody does. Then why not take their advice?\r\nThe Meath election petitions ought to have settled Home Rule.\r\nEnglishmen cannot have read the reports of these trials. Mr. Gladstone\r\nis fooling the people on both sides the water. He is satisfying\r\nnobody, whether Home Rulers or not. The Nationalists round here say\r\nthe bill is an insult, but that they will take it as an instalment.\r\nThe end will be that both loyalists and traitors will be more\r\ndiscontented than ever--a poor result after so much fuss and waste of\r\nprecious time.\"\r\n\r\nIf my friend had known of it he might have quoted Mr. William Heath,\r\nan Englishman resident for six months in Tyrone. He arrived in Ireland\r\na bigoted Home Ruler, but six months in the country knocked his\r\nnonsense out of him. He said:--\"I have seen enough of Romanism to\r\nconvince me that Protestantism would be crushed if Home Rule became\r\nlaw. I have seen the men who demand it, and I have seen the men who\r\nare determined to oppose Home Rule--the one set idle, dissolute,\r\npoverty-stricken, disloyal, and priest-ridden; the other industrious,\r\nthrifty, comfortable, and loyal to England. I go back to England a\r\nUnionist, and will do all I can to spread the light on the true state\r\nof affairs in this unhappy country. If the people of England and\r\nScotland saw Nationalists as I have seen them they would not force\r\nHome Rule on the Loyalists of Ulster so as to leave them at the mercy\r\nof such a party.\" A Primitive Methodist Minister, the Rev. J.\r\nAngliss, who came to Ireland a faithful follower of Mr. Gladstone,\r\nchanged his mind when acquainted with the facts, and confessed himself\r\na convert to Unionism. He said that he had used his influence against\r\nthe return of Sir Richard Webster, the late Attorney-General, but\r\nsince his visit to Ireland he had come to the conclusion that the Bill\r\nwould be a tremendous evil. He was \"prepared to go back to the very\r\nplatform in the Isle of Wight from which he had supported Home Rule\r\nand to tell the people he was converted. English people who come here\r\nto investigate for themselves must be forced to the conclusion that\r\nthe Bill means confiscation and robbery.\"\r\n\r\nA thriving tradesman of Clones said:--\"I am surprised that any\r\nEnglishmen can be found to pin their faith to Mr. Gladstone, or to any\r\nman with such an extraordinary record of change. Mr. Bright used to\r\nsay he could not turn his back on himself, but Mr. Gladstone spins\r\nround and round like a teetotum. I should think that such an instance\r\nhas never been known since that good old parson who sung, 'Whatsoever\r\nking may reign, Still I'll be Vicar of Bray, Sir.' Downing Street is\r\nthe Grand Old Man's vicarage, and he endeavours to cling to it at all\r\ncosts. In 1886 he said, 'I will not be a party to giving Ireland a\r\nlegislative body to manage Irish concerns and at the same time have\r\nIrish members in London acting and voting on English and Scottish\r\nconcerns.' In seven years and one month he insists on that very thing,\r\nand votes for it, with his crowd of noughts behind him. For I reckon\r\nall his Parliamentary supporters as noughts, to which a value is given\r\nby the figure 1 at their head. Isn't that true? What would the rest be\r\nwithout him? The bulk of his adherents are precisely the kind of men\r\nnobody ever pays any attention to. There's Morley, a good writer, but\r\nnot a man of business. Then there's Harcourt. How can Englishmen stand\r\nsuch a hollow humbug? He'll say anything, any blessed thing. I prefer\r\nTim Healy, even, to Harcourt. Tim was roughly brought up, and, as he\r\ngets his living by politics, he is to some extent excusable. The way\r\nthat Harcourt attacked the Irish party, so long as Mr. Gladstone\r\nattacked them! The things he said, the strong language he used so long\r\nas that course pleased Mr. Gladstone! Now he turns round and calls\r\nthem beauties; and for that matter so they are. It's what I mostly\r\ncall them myself. Beauties.\r\n\r\n\"The arrangement to keep the Irish Nationalists at Westminster is\r\nsomething for Englishmen to consider. If they can swallow that they\r\ncan swallow anything. They can have no pride about them, or else they\r\nare taking no further interest in their own affairs. To give the Irish\r\nmembers power to vote on all questions coming before the Imperial\r\nParliament, while conceding to them the privilege of managing their\r\nown affairs without interference, is indeed an eye-opener. The British\r\nParliament had sunk low enough when it began to heed the clamour of a\r\nset of American-paid blackguards such as the bulk of the Irish members\r\nare, by their own supporters, admitted to be. But how much lower has\r\nEngland sunk when she accepts the dictation of these men, and says,\r\n'You can manage your own affairs and direct my business too.' These\r\nfellows are to be masters of Ireland _and_ masters of England. For of\r\ncourse, they can always exert a preponderating influence in British\r\naffairs, holding as they do the balance of voting power. And\r\nEnglishmen will submit to this; and will let their members be gagged\r\nand the clauses shoved through the House by hydraulic power.\r\nEnglishmen are so fond of boasting of their Freedom and Independence.\r\nWhy, they are being treated like fools and slaves. And by such a low\r\nset of fellows. Some of the Nationalist members wipe their noses on\r\nthe tails of their coats, and when those are worn out they use their\r\ncoat-sleeves. One of them was staying in an hotel where I was, and I\r\nsaw him eat eggs. He cut off the top, and worked up the yolk with the\r\nhandle of his spoon, mixing pepper and mustard. Then he cut his bacon\r\ninto dice, and dipped each square in the egg before stoking himself.\r\nThat is a sample of the class now working the British Parliament.\r\nThere was an Irish patriot M.P.\r\n\r\n\"Dillon is comparatively respectable, and if you knew Dillon you\r\nwouldn't think that meant much. Chamberlain showed him up, but why\r\nstop at one quotation? I see the judge is now in Tipperary. That was\r\nthe place Dillon, along with O'Brien, got to conspire against the law\r\nwith such frightful results. You remember they were sentenced to six\r\nmonths' imprisonment, but breaking their bail they both ran away,\r\nwhile the poor men who had got into trouble, without funds to bolt\r\nwith, went to hard labour. Dillon once said that if certain people had\r\ncattle on land '_the cattle wouldn't prosper very much_,' and sure\r\nenough a number of cattle near Tipperary have had their tails cut off.\r\nDillon, I say, is reckoned one of the most respectable. That does not\r\nsay much for the others. You are giving these men power. Will they use\r\nthat power to wring further concessions? They have often declared that\r\nthey will. The English Home Rulers say that they won't, that Irishmen\r\nwill be too grateful. They know not what they say. You'll have a\r\nhostile Government at your very doors. What did Parnell say? 'When\r\nEngland is at war and beaten to her knees, the idea of the Irish\r\nNationalists may be realised.' And Sexton, this very Sexton who is now\r\nso much to the front, said that the 'one prevailing and unchangeable\r\npassion between Ireland and England is the passion of hate.' Then what\r\nhope is there of friendship in a Home Rule Bill which will infinitely\r\nincrease the number of points of dispute? And these men don't mean to\r\nbe pleased, either. They don't mean to try to be content. It wouldn't\r\npay them. They have their living to get. Well, they have shown\r\nthemselves clever. They can work England.\"\r\n\r\nA friend has furnished me with a few gems from the orations of the\r\nDillon aforesaid, whose threat of what would be done to loyalists\r\nunder an Irish Parliament has recently attracted so much notice. He\r\ntried to show that this was said in a moment of warmth, in a fit of\r\nexasperation at the \"Mitchelstown massacre,\" which took place a year\r\nafterwards. What had annoyed him when at Limerick he said that any man\r\nwho stood aside from the national movement was \"a dastard and a\r\ncoward, and he and his children after him would be remembered in the\r\ndays that are near at hand, when Ireland was a free nation?\"--Date\r\nSeptember 20th, 1887. Dillon delights in dates. Again, what had\r\nruffled the patriot soul, when at Maryborough he spoke of dissentients\r\nin the following terms:--\"When the struggle is ended and the people of\r\nthis country have obtained that control over their own affairs which\r\nmust come very soon, he will be pointed out to his neighbours as a\r\ncoward and a traitor?\"--January 15th, 1889. It was on November 1st,\r\n1887, at Limerick, that the same friend of England said \"let the\r\npeople of Ireland get arms in their hands,\" and promised to \"manage\r\nUlster.\" It was at Dublin on August 23rd, 1887, that Mr. Dillon\r\nsaid:--\"If there is a man in Ireland base enough to back down, to turn\r\nhis back on the fight, I will denounce him from public platforms _by\r\nname_, and I pledge myself to the Government that, let that man be who\r\nhe may, his life will not be a happy one, either in Ireland or across\r\nthe seas.\" All this, be it observed, was after the promulgation of the\r\nUnion of Hearts. Well might Mr. Gladstone, speaking of Mr. Dillon, who\r\nis now one of his closest allies, say in the House of Commons:--\r\n\r\n\"The honourable gentleman comes here as the apostle of a creed which\r\nis a creed of force, which is a creed of oppression, which is a creed\r\nof the destruction of all liberty, and of the erection of a despotism\r\nagainst it, and on its ruins, different from every other despotism\r\nonly in this,--that it is more absolutely detached from all law, from\r\nall tradition, and from all restraint.\" Sir William Harcourt also\r\nreferring to Mr. Dillon in the House once said, \"The doctrine of the\r\nLand League, expounded by the man who has authority to explain it, is\r\nthe doctrine of treason and assassination;\" and in addition to this\r\nstrong pronouncement Sir William called it \"a vile conspiracy.\" Both\r\nMr. Gladstone and Sir William Harcourt are now hand-and-glove with the\r\nmen of whom Mr. Gladstone said at Leeds:--\"They are not ashamed to\r\npoint out in the press which they maintain how the ships of her\r\nmajesty's navy ought to be blown into the air, and how gentlemen they\r\nare pleased to select ought to be the object of the knife of the\r\nassassin and deprived of life because they do not conform to the new\r\nIrish Gospel.\" Mr. Chamberlain's exposure of Dillon has brought down\r\nthe thunders of the Nationalist press. Did he ever say anything\r\nstronger than this? One Nationalist paper, speaking of the member for\r\nWest Birmingham, says:--\"There was something devilish in the\r\nexultation of the strident voice and pale malignant face.\" The Home\r\nRule penmen are always describing him as \"livid with impotent rage,\"\r\n\"trembling with ill-concealed vindictive passion,\" \"hurrying from the\r\nHouse to escape the mocking laughter of the amused Senate.\" The\r\nmember for Bordesley is dealt with more lightly. \"Mr. Jesse Collings\r\noccupied some minutes with his usual amusing inanity\" and so forth.\r\nAccording to these writers the House rapidly empties when Mr. Balfour\r\nor Mr. Chamberlain would fain hold forth, and fills to suffocation to\r\nhear the noble periods of Dillon, Sexton, and Healy. Mr. Deasy, M.P.\r\nfor West Mayo, has recently been before the public rather prominently,\r\nand his opinion of the Irish question may be interesting at the\r\npresent juncture. I heard much of this gentleman at Westport, where he\r\nis well known. He is disgusted with the show of loyalty to which his\r\ncolleagues have treated Mr. Gladstone, who boasts of their\r\n\"satisfactory assurances.\" He knew that the Nationalist members,\r\nspeaking in England, made use of amicable expressions which no Irish\r\nNationalist audience would tolerate, and speaking of this he said:--\"I\r\nhave never said on an English platform what I would not say here this\r\nnight. I have not been saying that we all want to be part and parcel\r\nof the British Empire--with the lie on the top of my tongue, I am not\r\ngoing to disgrace my constituency by going over to England and\r\nuttering falsehoods there, and coming back and saying that I was\r\ndeceiving England at the time.\" This speech was made in 1891, only two\r\nyears ago. Is not this big print enough? Surely no reasonable person\r\nwill any longer believe in the loyal friendship of Nationalist\r\nIreland. To do so is to violate common sense. Only the fatuous\r\nGladstonians, Whose eyes will scarcely serve at most To guard their\r\nwearers 'gainst a post, can be expected to take it in.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to find a decent person in favour of the bill. Its\r\nsupporters are eminently unsatisfactory, inasmuch as they furnish no\r\nreadable matter, and content themselves with saying that Ireland will\r\nhave her freedom, and that prosperity will follow, as the night the\r\nday, in the wake of the bill. But they can never indicate wherein is\r\ntheir want of freedom, nor can they ever say _how_ the bill will bring\r\nabout prosperity. Then, as a rule, the voters for the bill are persons\r\nwhose opinion no sane person would act upon in the most unimportant\r\nmatter. They never know the population of their own town, nor the\r\ndistance to the next. They are mostly sunk fathoms deep in blackest\r\nignorance, and characterised by most cantankerous perversity, now\r\nrapidly merging, as the bill proceeds, into insolent bumptiousness.\r\nThe Lord-Lieutenant has returned to Dublin after having endured such\r\nsnubs and slights as Mr. Balfour never encountered. And yet Lord\r\nHoughton waved the olive-branch. Everybody seems to have asked him for\r\na pier. I have given many instances of useless piers on the Western\r\nIrish Coast. The parish priests who met the Viceroy asked for more,\r\nand again more. Mr. Morley has been asked in the House what is going\r\nto be done about the piers the priests have asked for. Let him appoint\r\na Commission to inquire into the history of Western Irish piers. The\r\nreport will be startling, and also instructive. A Glengariff man\r\nadmitted to me that the people of that famous town would make no use\r\nof the pier if they had it. \"But,\" said he, \"the building of it would\r\nbring a thousand pounds into the village.\" The English people are said\r\nto dearly love a lord. The Irish people dearly love a pier.\r\n\r\nClones, July 13th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 48.--A SEARCH FOR \"ORANGE ROWDYISM.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBelfast is still of the same mind. Its citizens will not have Home\r\nRule. They are more than ever determined that the fruits of their\r\nindustry shall not be placed at the mercy of men who have consistently\r\nadvocated the doctrine of plunder. The law-abiding men of Belfast will\r\nnever submit to the rule of law-breakers, many of whom have expiated\r\ntheir offences in the convict's cell. This debt-paying community will\r\nnot consent to be under the thumb of men whose most successful\r\ndoctrine has been the repudiation of legal contracts. The famous\r\nmerchants and manufacturers of the true capital of Ireland decline to\r\nplace their future fortunes in the hands of the unscrupulous and\r\nbeggarly adventurers who would form the bulk of a College Green\r\nParliament. The hard-working artizans of Belfast are firm in their\r\ndetermination to resist the imposition of a legislature which will\r\ndrive capital from the country, diminish the sources of employment,\r\nstrangle all beneficial enterprise, and by destroying security\r\nundermine and wreck all Irish industry. They know how the agitation\r\noriginates, and by whom it is directed. They have the results of Papal\r\ninfluence before their eyes. While Belfast as a whole is clean, open,\r\nairy, with splendid streets and magnificent buildings, the Catholic\r\nportions of the city are as much like the pestilent dens of Tuam and\r\nTipperary as the authorities will permit. The uninstructed stranger\r\ncan pick out the Home Rule streets. In Belfast as elsewhere,\r\nsweetness, light, and loyalty are inseparably conjoined, while evil\r\nsmells and dinginess are the invariable concomitants of disloyalty and\r\nseparatism. Fortunately for the Ulster city, the loyalists number\r\nthree to one, which fact accounts for its general cleanliness, the\r\nthriving aspect of its commercial concerns, the decency and order of\r\nits well-kept thoroughfares. And whatever Belfasters want they pay for\r\nthemselves. Belfast receives no Government grants for any municipal\r\npurpose, while disloyal Dublin, screaming for equality of treatment,\r\nis largely subsidised from Imperial sources. The Belfast people\r\nentirely support their hospitals. The Dublin hospitals are largely\r\nsupported out of the public revenues. The Belfast Botanic Gardens are\r\nkept going by Belfast. The Dublin Botanical Gardens are wholly\r\nsupported by Government. Further examples are needless, the facts\r\nbeing simple as they are undeniable. Dublin gets everything. Belfast\r\ngets absolutely nothing. Disloyalty is at a premium. Motley's the only\r\nwear. The screamers are always getting something to stop their\r\nmouths, a sop, not a gag. Steady, quiet, hard-working folks are of no\r\naccount. The Belfast men ask for nothing, and get it. They want no\r\npecuniary aid, being used to self-help, and liking it best. Stiff in\r\nopinion, they know their own minds, and are accustomed to victory.\r\nThey do not in turn threaten and complain and cringe and curse and\r\nfawn. They keep a level course and run on an even keel. They are bad\r\nto beat, and can do with much letting alone. They are pious in their\r\nway, and talk like Cromwell's Puritans. They abhor Popery, judging the\r\ntree by its fruits, a test recommended by their chiefest classic. They\r\nbelieve that Protestantism is daylight, that Popery is darkness, and\r\nthat the sun is rising. They believe with Carlyle that \"Popery cannot\r\ncome back any more than paganism, which also lingers in some\r\ncountries.\" They also believe with the sage that \"there is a perennial\r\nnobleness and even sacredness in Work. Were he never so benighted,\r\nforgetful of his high calling, there is always hope in a man who\r\nactually and earnestly works; in Idleness alone is there perpetual\r\ndespair.\" So they work every day and all the day, save on rare\r\noccasions, and for these holidays they make up by overtime. They think\r\nHome Rule is useless at best, and not only useless, but dangerous.\r\nThey declare it would affect their liberties, and this notion is\r\nineradicable. Touch them in their freedom and the secold Northerners\r\nbecome aflame. And while the Irish Kelts burn like straw--a flame and\r\na puff of smoke, and there an end--these Scots settlers are like oaken\r\nlogs, slow to take fire, but hard to extinguish. They prosper under\r\nthe Union, and therefore, say they, the Union is good. What the poor\r\nIrish need is industry, not Acts of Parliament. The land is rich, the\r\nlaws are just, the judges are honest, and industry is encouraged. The\r\nfault is in the people themselves, and in their pastors and masters.\r\nThe convergence of Ulster opinion reminds me of an old line, which\r\nfitly illustrates the position of the Irish malcontent party--\r\n\r\n_Heu mihi! quam pingui macer est mihi taurus in arvo._ Quaint old\r\nThomas Fuller (as I remember) has rendered this--\r\n\r\n    My starveling bull,\r\n      Ah, woe is me,\r\n    In pasture full\r\n      How lean is he!\r\n\r\nI am almost disposed to believe that Horace anticipated the case; or\r\nthat, like Mr. John Dillon, he had the gift of remembering occurrences\r\nbefore they took place.\r\n\r\nMuch has been spoken and written in England concerning \"Orange\r\nrowdyism.\" I saw the twenty thousand Orangemen who walked through\r\nBelfast to Knocknagoney on Wednesday last. They had nearly five miles\r\nto march on a hot day before they reached the meeting-place, some\r\nhours to stand there listening to speeches, and then the long march\r\nback again. Large numbers went to the Orange Halls, there to conclude\r\nthe day. I followed them thither, heard their speeches, noted their\r\nmodes of enjoyment, watched them unnoticed and unknown, save in one\r\ninstance, until they finally dispersed. Next day I went to Scarva,\r\nforty miles away, to see the great sham fight which annually takes\r\nplace there between representatives of King James and King William of\r\nOrange. There were sixty-four special trains, at cheap fares, running\r\nto Scarva, besides the ordinary service, and let it be remembered that\r\nScarva is on the main line from Dublin to Belfast. Now let me state\r\nprecisely what I saw.\r\n\r\nThe Belfast procession was very like the tail of the Belfast Balfour\r\ndemonstration, and with good reason, for both consisted of twenty\r\nthousand Orangemen. But on Wednesday the Orangemen, instead of being\r\npreceded by a hundred thousand citizens of Ulster, had it all to\r\nthemselves. The authorities know the character of Orangemen. They know\r\nthat scorching weather and long dusty marches are apt to lead to\r\ncopious libations, especially in holiday time. They know that\r\npolitical feeling runs high, and that the present moment is one of\r\nundue excitement. They know that the Papist party have taunted\r\nOrangemen with the supposed progress of the bill, and that the same\r\npeople say daily that Orangeism will be at once abolished, and that\r\nthis year sees the last Orange procession in Belfast. \"This is yer\r\nlast kick before we kick ye to hell,\" said a broken-nosed gentleman at\r\nthe corner of Carrick Hill. The authorities knew all these things, and\r\ntaking into account the known character of Orangeism, with the special\r\nexasperation of the moment, and remembering their own responsibility\r\nin the matter of order, how many extra policemen were drafted into the\r\ncity?\r\n\r\nNot one. The men who really know Orangemen knew that no precautions\r\nwere needed.\r\n\r\nThere were brass bands, drum and fife bands, and bands of bagpipes.\r\nThe drums were something tremendous. The Belfast drumming is a thing\r\napart, like a Plymouth Brother. We have nothing like it in England.\r\nThe big drums run in couples, borne by stout fellows of infinite\r\nmuscle, and tireless energy. The kettle-drums hunt in packs, like\r\nbeagles. The big drums are the biggest the climate will grow, and the\r\ndrummers lash them into fury with thin canes, having no knob, no\r\nwrapper of felt, no softening or mitigating influence whatever. The\r\nbands played \"God save the Queen,\" \"Rule Britannia,\" \"The Boyne\r\nWater,\" and \"The Death of Nelson.\" The fifes screamed shrilly, the\r\nbrass tubes blared, and every drummer drummed as if he had the Pope\r\nhimself under his especial care. The vigour and verve of these\r\nmarching musicians is very surprising. You cannot tire them out. The\r\ntenth mile ended as fresh as the first, though every performer had\r\nworked like a horse. There is a reason for this. Their hearts are in\r\nthe work. To them it means something. The scarves and busbies and\r\nuniforms and desperate paroxysms of drumming are somewhat comical to\r\nstrangers, but the people looked earnest, and as if engaged in serious\r\nbusiness. Thousands of well-dressed people walked with the procession,\r\nor looked gravely on. There was no horse-play, and no noise other\r\nthan the music. No bare feet, no bare heads, no rags, no dirt, no\r\ndisorder. A Papist sprang from his lair in a side street and tried to\r\nsnatch the scarf from a young man, who promptly drove him back to his\r\nden. Nothing else happened. At midnight there were for the whole city\r\ntwenty police cases against thirty-nine for last year's twelfth. So\r\nmuch for Orange rowdies in the streets. Let us look upon their private\r\norgies.\r\n\r\nAt seven o'clock I went to the Orange Hall, Clifton Street, the\r\nheadquarters of the body. The various lodges were dispersed in several\r\nrooms, where they seemed to be taking tea with their sisters and their\r\ncousins and their aunts. A turn outside landed me opposite Saint\r\nPatrick's Roman Catholic Church, and here was a strong guard of\r\npolice. The neighbouring streets of Carrick Hill, North Street, and\r\nanother, literally swarmed with filthy, bare-footed women, wearing the\r\nhooded shawl of Limerick, of Tuam, of Tipperary. The men had a\r\ndangerous look. Many were drunk, and some had bandaged heads. More\r\npolicemen half-way down Carrick Hill, and more still at the end. The\r\npeople who pay no taxes cost most to keep in order. I have somewhere\r\nseen a body of returns showing that while the Unionist population\r\nrequires only ten or twelve policemen to every ten thousand people,\r\nthe Home Rule provinces take from forty-eight to fifty-two to manage\r\nthe same number. Returning to the Orange Hall a number of dirty,\r\nbare-footed children walked in procession past the door singing\r\nvociferously. They sung with great spirit to the tune of \"Tramp,\r\ntramp, tramp, the boys are marching,\" and seemed to enjoy it\r\namazingly. I did not catch the words. They stopped as I came up, but a\r\nyoung fellow on guard at the hall said, \"They grind up the children in\r\nsongs of a party nature, and send them here to annoy us. Of course, we\r\ncan't notice little children.\"\r\n\r\nThis time I dropped in the thick of the entertainment. A mild, mild\r\nman occupied the chair, young men and maidens, old men and children\r\nsitting around. They were inebriating on ginger beer and biscuits, and\r\ntheir wildest revelry was the singing of \"The Old Folks at Home\" by a\r\nyoung lady in white. Mr. E.J. Fullwood, of Birmingham, who was there\r\nas a visitor, made a rattling speech, and received a great ovation. A\r\nquiet gentleman, by special request, made a few remarks on the\r\npolitical situation. He said:--\"We will resist a Home Rule Parliament\r\nat any cost and at every cost. We will not have it. Our faith is\r\nplighted, and we are not the men to go back of our word.\" His manner\r\nwas very subdued, and the audience also kept very quiet. What these\r\nmen say they say in their sober senses, and not by reason of\r\nexcitement. Another room was livelier. An English gentleman was\r\nholding forth. Then the band played \"No surrender,\" after which a lady\r\nsang \"Killarney's hills and vales.\" In a third room a brother was\r\ncalling on the brethren to give three cheers for \"our beloved Queen,\"\r\nunder whose benignant reign blessings had been shed upon the British\r\nEmpire, \"to which we belong, and to which we still belong, so long as\r\nthey will have us.\" In a fourth room the listening Orangemen sat under\r\na discourse on the efficacy of prayer, which they were urged to make a\r\nliving part of their everyday life. All this was very disappointing,\r\nand when in Royal Avenue the helmeted watchman of the night assured me\r\nthat nothing had happened, and that nothing was likely to happen, I\r\nabandoned all hope of Orange rowdyism.\r\n\r\nNext day at ten, I went to Scarva, or, as the natives spell it,\r\nScarvagh. A neat little place full of Black Protestants. The houses\r\nare clean and tidy, and the people have a well-to-do look. There was a\r\ngreat crowd at the station, and a band of drummers were laying on with\r\nsuch thundering effect that my very coat sleeves vibrated with the\r\nconcussion. A big arch of orange lilies bore the one word WELCOME, and\r\nthe roadside was lined with stalls selling provisions and ginger beer.\r\nThe church on the hill flew the Orange flag with the Union Jack. The\r\nPresbyterian meeting-house and a Methodist Chapel complete the tale of\r\nworship-houses. The place is without rags, dirt, beggars, or any other\r\nsymptoms of Home Rule patriotism. Neither is there a Roman Catholic\r\nChapel. The signboards bore Scots and English names. Mr. J. Hawthorne\r\nstood at his door, big-boned and burly, with a handsome good-humoured\r\nface. \"Ye'll gang up the brae, till ye see an avenue with lots of folk\r\nintil it,\" said this \"Irishman,\" whose ancestors have lived at Scarva\r\nfrom time immemorial.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we pit up the airch o' lilies to welcome our friends. They come\r\nevery year, and a gude mony o' them too, so we pit up that bit thing\r\noot o' friendship like.\"\r\n\r\nI told him this was to be the last occasion, as Mr. Dillon was\r\ndetermined to manage Ulster. He laughed good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n\"Mon alive, d'ye tell me that any mon said sic a fuleish speech? Mon,\r\nits borne in on me that we'll tak a dooms lot of managin'. These chaps\r\ndinna ken ower weel what they're talkin' aboot. An' they maun say\r\nsomethin' to please the fellows that keep them in siller. These things\r\nhae gane on in Scarva sin' auld lang syne, an' nothin' e'er stappit\r\nthem. They went on when the Party Processions Act was law, an' tho'\r\nthe sojers ance cam frae Dublin to stop the demonstration, the\r\nOrangemen mustered in sic force that they never interfered aifter all.\r\nAn' in Ulster we'll hauld our own, d'ye mind that? We've tauld them\r\noor mind, an' that we wunna hae Home Rule. We've tauld them that, an'\r\nwe'll stand by it. They've gotten oor ultimatum, an' they can mak a\r\nkirk or a mill o' it.\"\r\n\r\nI gangit up the brae through dense crowds constantly increasing as the\r\nsixty-four specials gradually came in. The way was sylvan and pretty,\r\nbig beech trees and elms meeting overhead, the road running along the\r\nside of a steep hill sloping down to a small river, the slope\r\ncarefully tilled, and showing good husbandry. Then a beautifully\r\nwooded and extensive demesne, and a mile of avenue, with many\r\nthousands of well-dressed orderly people, the ladies forming about\r\nhalf the company. Then a large low, brown mansion with a gravelled\r\nquadrangle, around which marched fife and drum bands playing \"No\r\nSurrender\" and \"The Boyne Water.\" And everywhere incessant drumming\r\nand drinking of ginger beer. Banners were there of every size, shape,\r\nand colour, many with painted devices, more or less well done. The\r\nLurgan Temperance Lodge exhibited Moses in the wilderness, holding up\r\nthe brazen serpent. \"Three-fourths of the Orange Lodges are based on\r\ntemperance principles,\" said an Orange authority standing by, \"and\r\nwhat is more, they don't allow smoking. We Orange rowdies are to a\r\ngreat extent temperance men.\" I remembered that the three meetings of\r\nthe night before were smokeless concerts, and that the fourth\r\nresembled a Methodist love-feast, with an old brother telling his\r\nexperiences. Also that Captain Milligen, a leading Plymouth Brother of\r\nWarrenpoint, had told me that he had been present at a Scarva meeting,\r\nand that from beginning to end he never heard a bad word, nor saw\r\nanything objectionable. The sham fight took place on a hill hard by.\r\nTwo fine young fellows fenced with old cavalry swords, and King James,\r\nwith green coat and plumes, succumbed to King William with orange coat\r\nand plumes, while their respective armies to the number of about\r\nthirty, fifteen on each side, fired in the air. I noticed that while a\r\nfew had ancient brass-bound muskets, which looked as if converted from\r\nflint locks, most were armed with Snider rifles of army pattern. The\r\ndrums excelled themselves, and the fifers shrieked martial airs. The\r\npeople waved their hats and cheered, and that was the whole of it.\r\nReturning to the station, a good young man gave me a tract, wherein I\r\nfound myself addressed as a Dear Unsaved Reader, and later as a\r\nHell-deserving Sinner. Then a Salvation Army man telling a crowd to\r\nEscape for their lives, which I was just doing, and that once he had\r\nloved pleasure, which seemed likely enough. Then a big banner whereon\r\nwas depicted David in the act of beheading Goliath with a yeomanry\r\nsword, the Wicklow mountains in the distance. Then an old man on the\r\nbridge declaring to the multitude that he would not be a Papist for\r\nall that earth could give, and that nothing could induce his\r\nfellow-citizens to submit to Home Rule for one second of time. \"No,\r\nnever, never, never. Rather than accept of Popish rule, we'll take\r\narms in our hands as our fathers did, and like them we will conquer.\r\nHave we not their example before us? Are we such dastards as to give\r\nup that for which they shed their blood? Shall the sons be unworthy of\r\nthe sires? Never shall it be said that the children were unworthy\r\ntheir inheritance of Freedom. Old as I am, I would take a musket, and\r\ngo forth in the name of the Lord. Shame on the Scots and English if\r\nthey desert us in our hour of need. Are they not our own kith and kin?\r\nBut whether they aid us, or whether they desert us, we will stand\r\nfirm, and be true to ourselves. Our cause is good, and we are bound to\r\nwin, as we won before. Only stand firm, shoulder to shoulder. Shall\r\nwe bow down to Popery? No, by the God that made us, No. Shall we\r\ntruckle to Rome, shall we become slaves to Popish knaves, shall we\r\nbecome subservient to priestcraft and lying and roguery and trickery?\r\nNever shall it be said of us. We claim to be part and parcel of the\r\nglorious British Empire. We have helped to upbuild that Empire, and we\r\nclaim our inheritance. We will NOT sell our birthright, we will NOT\r\nconnive at the destruction of Britain's greatness, we will NOT have\r\nHome Rule. 'Shall we from the Union sever? By the God that made us,\r\nnever!'\"\r\n\r\nThe people listened silently, with grave, earnest faces. They mean\r\nbusiness. During my first visit to Belfast I interviewed the leading\r\ncitizens, the clergy, nobility, and gentry. This time I spoke with\r\nartisans and craftsmen, and I found the same feeling, a deep and\r\nimmovable resolve to fight till the last extremity. It should be\r\nremembered that all Ulstermen are not Orangemen. But the religious\r\nbodies which have held aloof from Orangeism are just as determined. On\r\nthe Irish Church question the Orange body stood alone. The dissenting\r\nsects were against them everywhere. All are united now, and the\r\nattempt to force Home Rule on these resolute men would be attended by\r\nthe most awful consequences. They are not of a breed that easily\r\nknocks under. They remind you of the Scottish Covenanters. They are\r\nmen with whom you would rather dine than fight. In Belfast, besides\r\nMr. Fullwood, of Birmingham, previously mentioned, I met with Mr.\r\nLyons, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, who in his walks abroad in the city had\r\nput down in his pocket-book the names of all streets he judged to be\r\nexclusively Catholic. He was right save in three cases, where the\r\npeople were mixed. He also observed that in the poorer quarters the\r\nwindows of all Protestant places of worship were protected by wire\r\nnetting, but that the Catholic chapels were not so protected. As the\r\nProtestants are three to one, he thought this a curious commentary on\r\nthe statements anent Orange rowdyism. Mr. Deacon, of Manchester, and\r\nthe Englishmen hereinbefore mentioned were present at the Orange Hall,\r\nand all saw what I have related. Mr. Henry Charlton, J.P., of\r\nGateshead-on-Tyne, agrees with them that the religious question is the\r\nsecret of the whole agitation, and that the sooner a leading statesman\r\nmeets the Home Rule movement on this, the true ground, the better for\r\nthe country. \"We are too squeamish in England. We fear to offend our\r\nCatholic friends, with whom there is no fault to be found. But we want\r\nan influential speaker to say at once that the conflict is reality\r\nbetween Protestantism and Popery. The best plan would be to state\r\nthings as they are, and to meet the enemy directly.\" So spoke one of\r\nthese visitors, a gentleman of great political experience. Is this\r\nopinion not well worth consideration? Is not the time for soft\r\nspeaking nearly over?\r\n\r\nMr. Dillon says he will manage Ulster. He will need the British Army\r\nat his back. His Army of Independence will not avail him much. The\r\nposition of the Nationalist members towards Ulster is not unlike that\r\nof the Chinaman who wanted an English sailor punished. \"There he\r\nstands,\" said the skipper, \"go and punch his head.\" \"No, no,\" said the\r\nCelestial complainant, \"me no likee-pikee that way. But spose three,\r\nfive, 'leven big sailors tie him up, hold him fast, then very much me\r\nbamboo he.\" And that is how the Dillonites would hope to manage\r\nUlster.\r\n\r\nBelfast, July 15th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 49.--THE CONSTITUTION OF THE ORANGE LODGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPortadown is another of the clean, well-built towns of Ulster\r\ndependent for its prosperity on the linen trade. The River Bann flows\r\nthrough it, a fine stone bridge spanning its waters in the principal\r\nstreet. Everybody seems comfortably off, and dirty slums are nowhere\r\nto be found. Some of the shops are very much larger than the size of\r\nthe town would seem to warrant, and one ironmonger's store is far\r\nlarger than any similar shop in Birmingham. The Presbyterian\r\nmeeting-house, on the right as you enter, and the Protestant Church,\r\nwhich occupies a conspicuous position at the meeting of two main\r\nthoroughfares, are plain, substantial buildings without any striking\r\narchitectural pretensions, and the Orange Hall, which seems an\r\nindispensable adjunct of all \"settler\" towns, is also modest and\r\nunassuming. The meadows bordering the Bann are spread with miles of\r\nbleaching linen, for which the river is especially famous, its waters\r\nhaving a very superior reputation for the production of dazzling\r\nwhiteness. The town is half-a-mile from the station, which is an\r\nimportant junction, and the number of cars in waiting show that the\r\npeople expect the coming of business men. When first I visited the\r\ntown, placards announcing drill meetings at the Orange Hall were\r\neverywhere stuck up, but I saw none during my last march round.\r\nPerhaps the Orangemen have completed their arrangements. The Portadown\r\npeople have no intention of accepting Home Rule. On the contrary they\r\nare determined to have none of it. At present they are quiet enough,\r\nbecause they are confident that the bill can never pass, and they do\r\nnot wish to meet trouble halfway. The House of Lords is their best\r\nbower anchor, and for the present they leave the matter with the\r\npeers. So they mind their work, and spend their time in making linen.\r\nWhen they demonstrate they do it with a will, but they cannot live by\r\ndemonstrations, and they are used to paying their way. They see what\r\nhappens in so-called \"patriotic\" districts, how neglect of duty\r\naccompanies eternal agitation, and how the result is poverty and\r\nfailure to meet the ordinary obligations of social life. The artisans\r\nof Portadown go to work every day, and the farmers do their level best\r\nwith the land, which all about this region is highly cultivated. They\r\nclaim to belong to the party of law and order, and they agree with the\r\ngreat orator who once said:--\"The party of law and order includes\r\nevery farmer who does not want to rob the landlord of his due and who\r\ndoes not want to be forced to pay blackmail to agitation--every poor\r\nfellow who desires to be at liberty to earn a day's wages by\r\nwhomsoever they are offered him, without being shunned, insulted,\r\nbeaten, or too probably murdered.\" The orator in question bears the\r\nwell-known name of William Ewart Gladstone, now intimately associated\r\nwith the names of Dillon, O'Brien, Sexton, O'Connor, Tim Healy, and\r\nthe rest of the agitators to whom he was referring in the above-quoted\r\nspeech, delivered at Hawick just ten years ago.\r\n\r\nA Portadown Orangeman complained bitterly of the attitude of the\r\nEnglish Gladstonian party with reference to his order. He said:--\"We\r\nhave been denounced as rowdies and Orange blackguards until the\r\nEnglish people seem to believe it. They never think of comparing our\r\nrecord with the record of the party denouncing us, nor do they know\r\nanything of the history and constitution of the order. We have always\r\nbeen loyal, always friends of England, and that is why the Nationalist\r\nparty so strongly disapprove of us. We have never occupied the time of\r\nthe English Parliament, nor have we leagued ourselves with the enemies\r\nof England. We have maintained order, and taken care of English\r\ninterests in Ireland, besides looking after our own personal affairs.\r\nWe have not stood everlastingly hat in hand, crying, like the daughter\r\nof the horse-leech, Give, give. And great is our reward. We are to be\r\nhanded over to a pack of Papist traitors and robbers, who for years\r\nhave made the country a perfect Hell. Mr. Gladstone would fain give\r\nrich, industrious Ulster into the hands of lazy, improvident\r\nConnaught. Let them try it on. Let them impose their taxes, and let\r\nthem try to collect them. They'll find in Ulster something to run up\r\nagainst. We prefer business to fighting and disturbance, but when once\r\nwe make up our minds for a row we shall go in for a big thing. Most of\r\nour people have a deep sense of religion, and they will look upon it\r\nas a religious war. It will be the sword of the Lord and of Gideon. We\r\nnever will bow down to Popery. And that is what Home Rule means. We\r\nsee the abject condition of the Papists, and we know their slavish\r\nsuperstitions. The bulk of them are body and soul in the hands of the\r\npriests, and that is the secret of their non-success in life. The\r\npoorest among them are taxed to death by the Church. A fee must be\r\npaid for christening, and unless you pay a stiff figure you won't have\r\na priest at your funeral. The poor Catholics are buried without any\r\nreligious service whatever. They are taken to the churchyard by their\r\nfriends and put in a hole, like a dog. Pay, pay, pay, from the cradle\r\nto the grave. And when the priests wish to raise money, they dictate\r\nhow much each person is to give. They do not believe in free-will\r\nofferings, otherwise their receipts would be very small indeed. There\r\nyou have one explanation of Papist poverty. Are we to put our necks\r\nunder the heels of a Parliament worked by Bishop Walsh of Dublin?\r\nNever, as long as we can strike a blow for freedom. We look to England\r\nat present. If England fails us, we shall look to ourselves. Our\r\nfathers died to preserve us from King James and Popery, and we are not\r\ngoing back to it at this time of day.\r\n\r\n\"English Home Rulers have actually taken up the cry of Equality, and\r\ndown with Protestant ascendency. Such foolish ignorance almost amounts\r\nto crime. Where are the Roman Catholic disabilities? For two\r\ngenerations the Papists have had absolute equality. Every office is\r\nopen to them on the judicial bench. There have been Roman Catholic\r\nLord Chancellors, and Lord Chief Justices. O'Laughlin, O'Hagan, Naish,\r\nPallas, Barry, O'Brien, Keogh, and many others are all Roman Catholic\r\njudges. The Papists have an overwhelming preponderance in\r\nParliamentary representation. They are looked after in the matter of\r\neducation, whether elementary, intermediate, or University. The system\r\nof the National Board was introduced to meet the objections of the\r\nRoman Catholics. They objected to the use of the Bible. As you know\r\nthe Papists object very strongly to the Bible, and as it came out some\r\ntime since, before the Commissioners of Education, of four hundred\r\nMaynooth students only one in forty had a Bible at all. Theological\r\nstudents without a Bible! But each was compelled to have a copy of\r\nsome Jesuit writer.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the inequality? The Romanists have their own college, this\r\nvery Maynooth, entirely under the control of their own bishops, where\r\nthey educate the sons of small farmers and peasants and whiskey-shop\r\nkeepers by means of funds very largely taken from the Protestant\r\nChurch of Ireland. They do not desire equality, they are resolved on\r\nascendency. We who live in Ireland know and feel the spirit of\r\nintolerance which marks the Romanist body. It is proposed to make of\r\nIreland a sort of Papal state. We have the declarations of Cardinal\r\nLogue, of Archbishop Walsh, of Archbishop Croke before us. We need to\r\nknow no more. The English people pay no attention to them, or have\r\nforgotten them. We bear them in mind, and we shall act accordingly.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend's statements anent the raising of money by the Roman\r\nCatholic clergy and the alleged poverty of Ireland reminded me that a\r\nyear ago at the opening of the Redemptorist Church of Dundalk the\r\ncollections of one day realised twelve hundred pounds, and that in the\r\nsame town a priest refused to baptise the child of a poor woman for\r\nless than five shillings. She tendered four shillings and sixpence,\r\nbut the man of God sent her home for the odd sixpence. She then went\r\nto the Protestant minister, who baptised the child for nothing. In\r\nWarrenpoint the priest decided what subscriptions each and every\r\nperson should pay to the funds of the new Catholic Church, and in\r\nMonaghan three well-to-do Papists had their cheques returned, as being\r\ninsufficient. The Romanist Cathedral of that poor little town is\r\ncurrently reported to have cost half a million, but that it cost at\r\nleast a hundred thousand pounds, exclusive of the stone, which was\r\ngiven by the Protestant landowner, Lord Rossmore, is admitted by the\r\nmost reliable authorities. The landlord agreed to give the stone on\r\ncondition that the quarry should be filled up and the land levelled as\r\nit was found at first. Stone for the cathedral, a convent, and many\r\nother buildings was taken, but the conditions were not fulfilled, and\r\na hole with forty feet of water was left, so that the field was\r\ndangerous for cattle. The Catholic party refused to level, and a\r\nlawsuit was the result. My Monaghan letter related the total exclusion\r\nof Protestants, including Lord Rossmore's agent, from the Town\r\nCouncil. So much for Papal tolerance and gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe English prejudice against Orangemen is ill-founded. Their\r\nsheet-anchor is an open Bible, and their principles, as expressed by\r\ntheir constitution, are such as ought to ensure the approval and\r\nsupport of Englishmen. They read as follows:--\"The institution is\r\ncomposed of Protestants resolved to the utmost of their power to\r\nsupport and defend the rightful Sovereign, the Protestant religion,\r\nthe laws of the country, the Legislative Union, and the succession to\r\nthe Throne being Protestant, and united further for the defence of\r\ntheir own persons and properties and the maintenance of the public\r\npeace. It is exclusively an association of those who are attached to\r\nthe religion of the Reformation, and _will not admit into the\r\nbrotherhood persons whom an intolerant spirit leads to persecute,\r\ninjure, or upbraid any man on account of his religious opinions_. They\r\nassociate also in honour of King William the Third, Prince of Orange,\r\nwhose name they bear, as supporters of his glorious memory.\" I have\r\nitalicised a few words which clear the association from the charge of\r\norganised intolerance, which is made alike by English and Irish Home\r\nRulers. The Portadown folks are especially well-versed in the history\r\nof the movement, and in the perils which impelled their forefathers to\r\nband themselves together. According to Froude, it was on the 18th\r\nSeptember, 1795, that a peace was formally signed at Portadown between\r\nthe Peep-o'-Day Boys and the Defenders, and the hatchet was apparently\r\nburied. But the incongruous elements were drawn together only for a\r\nmore violent recoil. The very same day Mr. Atkinson, a Protestant, one\r\nof the Defender subscribers, was shot at. The following day a party of\r\nProtestants were waylaid and beaten. On the 21st both parties\r\ncollected in force, and at a village in Tyrone, from which the event\r\ntook the name by which it is known, was fought the battle of the\r\nDiamond. The Protestants won the day, though outnumbered. Eight and\r\nforty Defenders were left dead on the field, and the same evening was\r\nestablished the first lodge of an institution which was to gather into\r\nit all that was best and noblest in Ireland. The name of Orangemen had\r\nlong existed. It had been used by loyal Protestants to designate those\r\nof themselves who adhered most faithfully to the principles of 1688.\r\nThreatened now with a general Roman Catholic insurrection, with the\r\nExecutive authority powerless, and determined at all events not to\r\noffer the throats of themselves and their families to the Roman\r\nCatholic knife, they organised themselves into a volunteer police to\r\nprevent murder, and to awe into submission the roving bands of\r\nassassins who were scaring sleep from the bedside of every Protestant\r\nhousehold. They became the abhorrence of traitors whose crimes they\r\nthwarted. The Government looked askance at a body of men who\r\ninterfered with the time-honoured policy of overcoming sedition by\r\ntenderness and softness of speech. But the lodges grew and multiplied.\r\nHonest men of all ranks sought admission into them as into spontaneous\r\nVigilance Committees to supply the place of the constabulary which\r\nought to have been, but was not, established; and if they did their\r\nwork with some roughness and irregularity, the work nevertheless was\r\ndone. By the spring of 1797 they could place twenty thousand men at\r\nthe disposition of the authorities. In 1798 they filled the ranks of\r\nthe Yeomanry, and beyond all other influences the Orange organisation\r\ncounteracted and thwarted the progress of the United Irishmen in\r\nUlster, and when the moment of danger arrived, had broken the right\r\narm of the insurrection. After this brief sketch of the origin of the\r\nmovement it would not be surprising if the constitutions of the body\r\ninculcated intolerance, or even revenge. On the contrary, both these\r\nthings are sternly prohibited, and their contraries expressly insisted\r\non. A pious Brother of Portadown said:--\"As Protestants we endeavour\r\nto make the Bible our rule and guide. We endeavour to love our\r\nneighbour as ourselves, we obey the constituted authorities, we\r\nmaintain and uphold the law, we fear God and honour the Queen. We are\r\nfirmly resolved to maintain our present position to the British Crown,\r\nand we deny the right of Mr. Gladstone to give us away, or to barter\r\nus for power. By the confession of his own followers, all his previous\r\nlegislation for Ireland has been a failure, for if it be not so, why\r\nthe present measure? We claim no ascendency, and we will submit to\r\nnone. It was from our ancestors that ascendency received its\r\ndeath-blow. Ever since 1681 our leading doctrine has been equality for\r\nall, without distinction of class or creed. By thrift and industry we\r\nhave created a state of commercial prosperity which is a credit and an\r\nhonour to the empire, while the Nationalist party under precisely\r\nsimilar conditions have discredited the empire, and by perpetual\r\nagitation, and not sticking to business, have brought every part of\r\nthe country under their influence to degradation and poverty; besides\r\nwhich they have, by their repudiation of contracts, undermined the\r\nmorality of their supporters all over Ireland. The Nationalist farmers\r\nprefer to have twenty-five per cent. off their rent by agitation or\r\nintimidation rather than to double or treble the productiveness of\r\ntheir land by hard work and the application of modern principles of\r\nfarming. We have seen from the first that the whole movement was\r\noriginated in roguery and sustained by roguery, and we see that it is\r\ncarried on by roguery. We not only know the men who keep up the\r\nagitation, but we know the influences at work behind them. All their\r\ntalk is of Protestant ascendency. Can they point out a single instance\r\nin which we have the upper hand, or state anything in which we as\r\nProtestants have any advantage whatever? Mr. Gladstone himself cannot\r\ndo it. He has said so in as plain terms as he can be got to use. But\r\nthe time for talking is over. We have said our say, and we are\r\nprepared to do our do. The Papists round here are very confident that\r\nbefore long they will have a marked ascendency. They expect no less.\r\nLet them attempt it. We shall be ready to stand our ground. As the\r\npoet says, Now the field is not far off When we must give the world a\r\nproof Of deeds, not words, and such as suit Another manner of\r\ndispute.\"\r\n\r\nA Home Ruler encountered casually showed some temper. He said:--\"All\r\nthe prosperity of which the Protestants boast is due to the fact that\r\nfor centuries they have been the favoured party. England has petted\r\nthem, and helped them, and encouraged them in every way. We were a\r\nconquered people, and these settlements of Methodists, and\r\nPresbyterians, and Quakers, and all the tag-rag-and-bob-tail of\r\ndissent, were thrown into the country to hold it for England, and to\r\nact as spies on the real possessors of the land, in the interests of\r\nEngland. They were, and are, the English garrison. They have no part\r\nwith the natives, the original sons of the soil. What right, moral or\r\nlegal, have these Colquhouns, these Galbraiths, these Andersons, to\r\nIrish soil? None but the right of the sword, the right of superior\r\nforce. Other nations have succumbed to the yoke of England, the\r\ngreatest tyrant with which the earth was ever cursed. The Scots and\r\nWelsh lick the boots of the English because it pays them to do so. The\r\nIrish have never given in, and they never will. For seven hundred\r\nyears we have rebelled, and as an Irishman I am proud of it. It shows\r\na spirit that no tyranny can break. What tyranny do we now undergo?\r\nThe tyranny of a master we do not like, and in whom we have no\r\nconfidence. We never agreed to accept the yoke of England. Now all we\r\nask is to be allowed to govern Ireland according to Irish ideas, and\r\nafter promising that we shall do so a bill is brought in which is a\r\nperfect farce, and which puts us in a far worse condition than ever.\r\nSome say that when once we get an Irish Parliament we can arrange\r\nthese small details. And mind this, we shall exact considerably more\r\nbecause of English distrust and English meanness.\"\r\n\r\nI note in Saturday's issue of the party sheets a quotation from an\r\nIrish-American paper, the _Saint Louis Republic_, which thus opines as\r\nto the policy of the Irish leaders:--\r\n\r\n\"They would better hold off until they have the bill out of the woods\r\nbefore they start a scrimmage over small details. Ireland and America\r\nwill think any bill which establishes local government a progressive\r\nstep of glory enough for one year. If Ireland cannot improve the law\r\nafter it gets a Legislature it needs a few American politicians, more\r\nthan an extra fund.\" How does this promise for the peace that is to\r\nfollow this great measure of \"Justice\" to Ireland? With the improved\r\nmethods of the Irish-American politicians, who, on the establishment\r\nof an Irish Parliament, would inundate the country, finding in its\r\nchaotic and helpless state a fit subject for plunder, the\r\nmeek-and-mild Radicals of the bread-and-butter type, who trollop\r\nthrough the lobbies after the Grand Old Bell-wether, would be highly\r\ndelighted. How did the Items get into Parliament at all? Why did they\r\ndesert the mothers' meetings, the Band-of-Hope committees, the five\r\no'clock tea parties at which they made their reputations? There,\r\nindeed, they found congenial society, there they were listened to with\r\nrapt attention, there they could coruscate like Tritons among minnows.\r\nAmong the blind a one-eyed man is King. The English Home Rule members\r\nare a collection of intellectual Cyclops. They can vote, though. They\r\ncan walk about, and that suffices their leader. If weak in the head,\r\nthey are strong in the legs. Legislation must in future be pronounced\r\nwith a hard g, or to avoid confusion of terms, and to preserve a pure\r\netymology, a new term is needed to describe the law-making of the Home\r\nRule members. Pedislation might serve at a pinch. I humbly commend the\r\nterm to the attention of my countrymen.\r\n\r\nJudged by classification of its friends and enemies, Home Rule comes\r\nout badly indeed. The capitalists, manufacturers, merchants,\r\nindustrial community, professional men are against it. Six hundred\r\nthousand Irish Churchmen are against it. Five hundred thousand\r\nMethodists and Presbyterians are against it. Sixty thousand members of\r\nsmaller denominations are against it. A hundred and seventy-four\r\nthousand Protestants in Leinster, and a hundred and six thousand in\r\nMunster and Connaught are against it. The educated and loyal Roman\r\nCatholic laity are against it. All who care for England and are\r\nwilling to join in singing \"God save the Queen\" are against it. On the\r\nother hand amongst those who are for it, and allied with them, we find\r\nthe dynamiters of America, the Fenians and Invincibles, the illiterate\r\nvoters of Ireland, the idlers, the disloyal, the mutilators of cattle,\r\nthe boycotters, the moonlighters and outragemongers, the murderers,\r\nthe village ruffians, the city corner boys, and all the rest of the\r\nblackguards who have flourished and been secure under the Land\r\nLeague's fostering wing. Are we to stand quietly aside and see the\r\ndestinies of decent people entrusted to the leaders of a movement\r\nwhich owes its success to such supporters? Are Englishmen willing to\r\nbe longer fooled by a Government of nincompoops?\r\n\r\nThose who have studied the thing on the spot will excuse a little\r\nwarmth. And then, I am subject to a kind of Dillonism. I am\r\nexasperated at the recollection of what may possibly take place next\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nPortadown, July 18th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 50.--THE HOLLOWNESS OF HOME RULE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis beautiful watering place cannot be compared with the celebrated\r\nholiday resorts of England, Wales, Scotland, or France without doing\r\nit injustice. It is unique in its characteristics, and globe-trotters\r\naver that earth does not show a spot with an outlook more beautiful.\r\nFrom the beach the view of the mountain-bordered Lough extends for\r\nmany miles seaward. On the opposite slopes to the right are the fresh\r\ngreen pastures and woods of Omeath, backed by the Carlingford\r\nmountains. On the left are wooded hills a thousand feet high which\r\nlead the eye to the Mourne Mountains at Rostrevor, where is the famous\r\nCloughmore (Big stone), a granite block nine feet high by fifteen feet\r\nlong, poised on the very apex of the mountain in the most remarkable\r\nway. How it got there is indeed a puzzle, as it stands on a bed of\r\nlimestone nine hundred and fifty-seven feet above sea level. You can\r\nsee it from the square of Warrenpoint, four miles away, and no doubt\r\ngood eyes would make it out at a much greater distance. Geologists\r\ntalk about the glacial age, and say that the boulder was left there by\r\nan iceberg from the north; but the mountain peasants know better. They\r\nknow that Fin McCoul heaved it at Brian Boru, jerking it across the\r\nLough from the opposite mountain five or six miles away, as an\r\nindication that he didn't care a button for his rival. These modern\r\nmountaineers are almost as easily gulled as their ancestors. They\r\nbelieve in Home Rule because they will, under an Irish Legislature,\r\n\"get all they want.\" They have votes, and they use them under clerical\r\nadvice. \"I don't know anything about Home Rule except that we are to\r\nget all we want.\" Those are the very words of an enlightened and\r\nindependent elector resident near Cloughmore. Never was there more\r\nsimple faith, or more concise _credenda_. The Newcastle programme is\r\ncomparatively unpromising. The wildest Radical, the most advanced\r\nSocialist, never came up to this. The Grand Old Man himself in his\r\nmost desperate struggles for place and power, never exactly promised\r\neverything that everybody wished. To get all you want is, indeed, the\r\n_summum bonum_, the Ultima Thule, the _ne plus ultra_ of political\r\nmanagement. After this the old cries of peace, retrenchment, and\r\nreform sound beggarly indeed. Never was there such a succinct and\r\ncomplete compendium of political belief. Nobody can outbid the man who\r\noffers \"all you want.\" For compactness and simplicity and general\r\nsatisfactoriness this phase of Home Rule diplomacy takes the cake.\r\nFailure to fulfil the promise is of course to be charged to the brutal\r\nSaxon. Meanwhile the promise costs nothing, and like sheep's-head\r\nbroth is very filling at the price.\r\n\r\nNot long ago the point in the Lough was a rabbit warren, whence the\r\nname. Before that the situation was too exposed to the incursions of\r\nrovers to tempt settlers, and Narrow-water Castle, built to defend the\r\npass, was (and is) between the town and Newry. But times have\r\nchanged. Settlers flocked across from Ayr, from Troon, from Ardrossan,\r\nand other Scots ports lying handy. A smart, attractive town has sprung\r\nup, starting with a square a hundred yards across. Big ships which\r\ncannot get up to Newry discharge in the Lough by means of lighters. An\r\neight-hundred-ton barque from Italy is unloading before my window.\r\nThere is a first-rate quay, with moorings for many vessels. The\r\nharbour is connected by rail with all parts of Ireland, and in it\r\nseven hundred to eight hundred ships yearly discharge cargoes. The\r\ngrassy beach-promenade is half-a-mile long, and an open tramcar runs\r\nalong the shore for three miles. The residents are alive to the\r\nimportance of catering for visitors, and the Town Commissioners, a\r\nmixed body, have provided bathing accommodation for both sexes.\r\nGalway, with thrice the population, a fine promenade, good sands, and\r\na grand bay, has no such arrangements; and Westport has very little\r\naccommodation for tourists. The contrast between the North of Ireland\r\nand the South and West comes out in everything.\r\n\r\nThe Methodists and Presbyterians are strong in the town, to say\r\nnothing of the two Protestant Churches, one in Warrenpoint and another\r\nin the Clonallon suburb. The Catholic Chapel is counterbalanced by the\r\nMasonic Hall. Wherefore it is not surprising to learn that the bulk of\r\nthe townsmen are staunch Unionists. The Nationalist papers have little\r\nsale hereabouts, the _Belfast News Letter_ and the _Irish Times_\r\nhaving the pull. A business man, who has lived here for forty years,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"We are fairly matched in numbers but the Conservatives have the\r\nwealth and respectability. The fishermen and labourers are nearly all\r\nHome Rulers, simply because they are Catholics. They are quite\r\nincapable of saying _why_ they are Home Rulers, and some of them even\r\nprofess to regard the proposed change with alarm, and say they prefer\r\nthat things should remain as they are. But although they speak so\r\nfairly, yet when the time comes to vote, they vote as the priest tells\r\nthem. They have no option, with their belief. I don't blame the poor\r\nfellows one bit. I followed the report of the South Meath election\r\npetition very closely, and I know that the same kind of pressure was\r\nexerted here. At Castlejordan Chapel Father O'Connell commanded the\r\npeople, in a sermon, to go to a Nationalist meeting, and said he would\r\nbe there, and that their parish priest expected them to go. He said\r\nthat if any were absent he would expect them to give a good and\r\nsufficient reason for their absence. On another occasion a priest met\r\na number of men who were going to an opposition meeting, and turned\r\nthem back with threats. These priests not only threatened to refuse\r\nextreme unction to persons who voted against the clerical party, but\r\nthey also threatened personal violence, and then said, 'Don't hit\r\nback, for I have the holy sacrament on me.' Father John Fay, parish\r\npriest of Summerhill, County Meath, told his people that they must not\r\nlook on him as a mere man; if they did they might have some prejudice\r\nagainst him, for all had their shortcomings. 'The priest is the\r\nambassador of Jesus Christ, and not like other ambassadors. He carries\r\nhis Lord and Master about with him, and when the priest is with the\r\npeople Almighty God is with them.' That is what Father Fay reckoned\r\nhimself. Almighty God, no less. He alluded to the consecrated wafers\r\nhe had in his pocket. The doctrine of transubstantiation is here\r\ninvoked to assist in carrying a Home Rule candidate of the right\r\nclerical shade. And all the awful language used from the altar, in the\r\nconfessional, all the threats of eternal damnation, and burning in the\r\nfires of hell, all the refusals of mass, and to hear dying\r\nconfessions, were directed against another section of the Home Rule\r\nparty, and not against a Unionist at all. How does this promise for\r\nthe working of an Irish Parliament?\r\n\r\n\"I note that the English Home Rule papers say nothing good of the\r\nbill. They are always praising the management of the Old Parliamentary\r\nHand. They beslaver him with fulsome adoration. They cannot point out\r\nanything good in the provisions of the bill, nor in the central idea\r\nof the bill, but they must fill up somehow, and they praise his\r\nartfulness, how he dodged this, and dexterously managed that. They\r\nhave nothing but admiration for his jugglery and House-of-Commons\r\ntricks. They bring him down to the level of a practised conjuror or a\r\nthimblerigger. But, with all his wonderful cleverness, he is not\r\nadmired or supported by any intelligent body of public men. The\r\ngag-trick ought to settle him. We in Ulster feel sure that a general\r\nelection to-morrow would for ever deprive him of power. Of course the\r\nOld Hand knows that, and will not give the country an opportunity of\r\npronouncing judgment. He and his flock of baa-lambs will put off the\r\nday of reckoning as long as ever they can. Either on the present or\r\nnext year's register he is bound to be badly beaten. His course is\r\nclear. He used to have three courses open to him, but now he has only\r\none. He must try to weather the storm until he has a chance of faking\r\nthe voters' lists so as to improve his own chances. It is said that\r\nMr. Henry Fowler is already preparing such a scheme. Like enough. If\r\ntricks will win, I back the G.O.M. There are more tricks in him than\r\nin a waggon-load of monkeys. The strangest thing I ever saw or ever\r\nheard of is the calmness with which the English people take the\r\nproposition that Ireland shall manage English affairs, while Ireland\r\nis to manage her own without any interference. I should have expected\r\nthe British workman to processionise about this. I should have thought\r\nthe British middle-classes would have been up in arms at the bare\r\nthought of so monstrous a proposition. And so they would if they\r\nthought it would become law. But, like us, they know there will never\r\nbe any Home Rule. Then, they are not so nervous as we in Ireland are,\r\nbecause they don't know as we do what Home Rule really means.\r\n\r\n\"No earthly power can assist the Irish peasantry so long as they\r\nremain under the dominion of the priests. Popery is the vampire that\r\nis sucking the life-blood of the country. It is fashionable nowadays\r\nto abstain from denouncing other religious systems, on the plea of\r\ntoleration. I agree with perfect toleration, and I am not desirous of\r\nmaking reference to Romanism. But they force it upon us. The Papist\r\nclergy say that the poverty of the country is due to English rule. We\r\nwho live here know that it is due to Romish rule. How is it that all\r\nProtestants are well off, and make no complaint? How is it that their\r\nchildren never run barefoot? How is it that their families are well\r\neducated, that their dwellings are clean, and that they pay their way?\r\nHome Rule may impoverish those whom the teachings and habits of\r\nProtestantism have enriched, but neither Home Rule nor anything else\r\nwill enrich those whom Popery has impoverished. England should turn a\r\ndeaf ear to the cry for Home Rule, which means the ruin of her only\r\nfriends in Ireland, and unknown damage to herself. To give her enemies\r\nthe means wherewithal to damage her is very midsummer madness.\"\r\n\r\nThe difference between Protestant and Roman Catholic farmers was shown\r\nin striking contrast on the Marquess of Lansdowne's estate in Queen's\r\nCounty. Most of the tenants were non-judicial, and the total rents\r\namounted to £7,000, of which the Marquess allowed £1,100 to be\r\nannually expended on the estate. In 1886 the tenants demanded\r\nthirty-five per cent. reduction on non-judicial and twenty-five per\r\ncent. on judicial rents, threatening as an alternative to adopt the\r\nPlan of Campaign. The Marquess refused to comply with this exorbitant\r\ndemand, but offered reductions of fifteen to twenty-five per cent. on\r\nnon judicial rents. The tenants declined to pay anything, and the\r\nlandlord enforced his rights, Mr. Denis Kilbride, M.P., declaring that\r\n\"these evictions differed from most of the other evictions to this\r\nextent,--that they were able to pay the rent. It was a fight of\r\nintelligence against intelligence, a case of diamond cut diamond.\" Mr.\r\nKilbride, who held a large farm at a rental of seven hundred and sixty\r\npounds was one of the evicted. Another of these poor destitute,\r\nhomeless tenants, brutally turned out on the roadside to starve, or\r\ndie like a dog from exposure, was no sooner evicted than he entered a\r\nracehorse for the great contest of the Curragh. This victim of Saxon\r\ntyranny was named John Dunne, and his holding comprised more than\r\nthirteen hundred acres. Let us hope the colt did him credit. Let us\r\ntrust that the evicted quadruped carried off the blue ribbon of\r\nKildare. For under the Lansdowne \"Rack-rents\" the struggling farmer\r\ncould barely keep one racehorse, which, like the fabled ewe-lamb of\r\nancient story, was his little all. Perhaps Mr. Dunne's colt was\r\nrelated to that well-bred travelling horse, of which the picture\r\nadorned the walls of Limerick and its vicinity, and which gloried in\r\nthe name of Justice to Ireland. There were no evicted Protestants on\r\nthe Lansdowne estate. Every Protestant farmer paid his rent and\r\nsteadfastly refused to join the Plan of Campaign.\r\n\r\nThe injustice of an Irish rent largely depends on the question, To\r\nwhom is it due? A good Nationalist may draw a higher rent than a\r\nLoyalist. A sound Home Ruler may ask for and insist on an exorbitant\r\nrent, but he is never denounced by the Nationalist press. The\r\nCorporation of Dublin is red-hot in the matter of patriotism. Its\r\nParnellite members have from time to time comprised the pick of the\r\nNationalist agitators. The Dublin \"patriot\" press has ever been\r\nforemost in denouncing Rack-rents. But the city of Dublin is a\r\nlandlord. It has agricultural tenants who are never allowed under pain\r\nof eviction to get into arrears. The members of the Corporation fixed\r\nthe rents, and, strange to say, the tenants at the first opportunity\r\nappealed to the Land Commissioners. Six of them holding four hundred\r\nand twenty-seven acres of land, were paying £883 16s. 4d. The rent was\r\ntherefore over £2 an acre, which is perhaps double the average. The\r\nGovernment valuation was £625 10s. The new rent was finally settled at\r\n£683, being an all-round reduction of twenty-three per cent. Lord\r\nClanricarde is frequently denounced by Nationalists for excessive\r\nrents, lack of conscience, and non-residence. The Land Commissioners\r\nwere unable to deduct anything like twenty-three per cent. from the\r\nClanricarde rent-roll. The Councillors of Dublin were never upbraided,\r\nnor put in danger of their lives. The Loughrea people shot Lord\r\nClanricarde's agent, his driver, his wife, and several other people,\r\nin protest against the Clanricarde rents and to encourage the landlord\r\nto live on the estate. About a dozen were murdered altogether. Surely\r\nthese parallel cases should demonstrate the utter hollowness of the\r\nHome Rule agitation.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants of Warrenpoint, like those of Newry and Belfast, are\r\nconfident of their ability to hold their own. Their attitude is very\r\ndifferent from that of the trembling heretics of Tuam or Tipperary.\r\nThey are strong in numbers, discipline, and resolution, and in\r\naddition to upholding their own personal cause they declare that their\r\nisolated co-religionists in Leinster, Munster, and Connaught shall not\r\nbe forsaken nor left to their own shifts. A rough and ready farmer\r\nthus spoke forth his mind:--\"England may give the Papists a Parliament\r\nto manage Papists, but not to manage Protestants. We should never\r\nbegin to consider the advisability of submitting to it. The thing's\r\nclean impossible. What! Let Papists tax us! Pay for the spread of\r\nPopery! Did you ever hear anything so absurd? Not one farthing would\r\n_I_ ever pay. I'd leave the country first. So would all the decent,\r\nindustrious folks. We know what happens in every country where Popery\r\ngets the mastery. Look at Spain, Italy, and the Catholic parts of\r\nIreland. If England sends an army of redcoats to punish us for our\r\nloyalty, we shall give way at once. We've sense enough to know that we\r\ncould do nothing against the Queen's troops, even if we wished to\r\nfight them. But to take arms against the soldiers of England would be\r\nquite against our principles. What we should ultimately do, under\r\nmilitary compulsion, we have not yet decided, but we should never\r\nunder any circumstances show fight against the Queen. We don't think\r\nthe day will ever come when England would send the military to shoot\r\nus for sticking to England. As for the police of the Irish Parliament,\r\nthat's another thing. They would have no assistance in Ulster. The\r\nsheriff's officers, when engaged in the compulsory raising of taxes,\r\nwould have a lively time, and I am sure they would never get any\r\nmoney. We don't take it seriously yet. If the bill were actually on\r\nthe statute book and an Irish House of Commons doing the Finnigan's\r\nwake business with the furniture legs of the College Green Lunatic\r\nAsylum, even then we would not take it seriously. We shall never think\r\nit worth while to be serious until we see the British army firing on\r\nus. It's too ridiculous. We pay no attention to the Irish Nationalist\r\nmembers, whom we regard as a bankrupt lot of bursted windbags. Why,\r\nhardly one of them could be trusted with the till of a totty-wallop\r\nshop. To how many of them would Gladstone lend a sovereign? How many\r\nof them could get tick in London for a new rig-out? Dublin is out of\r\nthe question, of course, because in Dublin these statesmen are known.\r\nWould Englishmen let such men govern their country? Not likely. Nor\r\nwill we.\"\r\n\r\nI submitted that, so far as at present enacted, these very heroes were\r\nreally going to govern both England and Ireland. The great organ of\r\nEnglish Roman Catholicism objecting to this has given great offence to\r\nthe Irish Papists, and the Nationalist press is shrieking with futile\r\nrage. English Catholicism and Irish Catholicism seem to be entirely\r\ndifferent politically. Englishmen are Englishmen first, and Catholics\r\nnext. Irishmen look first to Rome, and cordially hate England,--there\r\nis the difference. The Conservative Catholic organ says, referring to\r\nthe retention of members at Westminster:--\r\n\r\n\"With just as much reason might we import a band of eighty South\r\nAfricans, and whether they were eighty Zulus or eighty Archangels in\r\ndisguise, their presence in the British House of Commons would be a\r\ngross violation of the principles of representative government. At\r\npresent, as members of the common Parliament of an United Kingdom,\r\nEnglish and Irish members have correlative rights, but when Irish\r\naffairs are withdrawn from the Parliament at Westminster, on that day\r\nmust the Irish members cease to take part in purely British\r\nlegislation. We are asked to grant Home Rule to Ireland in deference\r\nto the wishes of the local majority, and then we are told we must let\r\nthe local majority in Great Britain be dictated to by eighty men who\r\nhave neither stake in the country nor business in her Parliament, and\r\nwho do not represent so much as even a rotten borough between them.\"\r\n\r\nMy Warrenpoint friend may well say that he cannot take it seriously.\r\nThe dignity of the English Parliament is, however, a matter of great\r\nconcern to Englishmen, and that for the present seems consigned to the\r\ncharge of Dillon, Healy, and Co. And all to further the Union of\r\nHearts. Yet Misther Tay Day Sullivan, not content with the management\r\nof both England and Ireland, proposes to oust us from India! The Irish\r\nfaction will boss the wuruld from ind to ind. Begorra, they will. Tay\r\nDay says:--\r\n\r\n    England fears for India,\r\n      For there her cruel work\r\n    Was just as foul and hateful\r\n      As any of the Turk.\r\n    But when God sends us thither\r\n      Her rule to overthrow,\r\n    With fearless hearts rejoicing\r\n      To work His will we'll go.\r\n    Stupid little England\r\n      Thinks to say us nay,\r\n    But paltry little England\r\n      Shall never stop our way.\r\n\r\nThere is a tribute of affection! There is an outpouring of loyalty!\r\nThere is an anthem to celebrate the Union of Hearts! It should be sung\r\nround a table, Gladstonians and Irish Home Rulers hand in hand, as in\r\n\"Auld Lang Syne,\" and given out by Pastor W.E. Gladstone, as short\r\nmetre, two lines at a time. Why not? Stranger things are happening\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nWarrenpoint, July 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 51.--THE IRISH PRESS ON \"FINALITY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglishmen who have any doubt remaining anent Home Rule should read\r\nthe Irish Nationalist press. Those who propose to concede the measure\r\nfor the sake of peace and finality should read, mark, learn, and\r\ninwardly digest the _United Ireland_ leader, which commences: \"Let it\r\nbe pretended no more that the fate of the present Home Rule Bill is\r\nhenceforth a matter of vital interest to us,\" and afterwards says, \"We\r\nshall have to go on fighting--to go on fighting--without even a\r\ntemporary intermission, and whether this bill pass or not, this year\r\nor next, or the year after, no matter what becomes of it.\" \"Mr.\r\nGladstone's bill in its present form is exactly such a Central Council\r\nas Mr. Chamberlain would have agreed to at the time of the Round Table\r\nConference. If it pass it can be no more than a milestone on our\r\nmarch. To talk of finality any more would be simply grotesque, and yet\r\nthe Gladstonians have urged, in season and out of season, that the\r\nbill would be nothing if not 'final, reasonably final.'\" The English\r\nHome Rulers are dealt with as severely as the most hardened Unionist\r\ncould wish. The writer speaks of their \"disastrous fatuity in\r\nconsuming the whole of this session of the Imperial Parliament, and\r\nthe greater part of one or two more, over a Home Rule Bill which will\r\nsettle nothing, no, not even for three years.\" Disastrous fatuity is a\r\ngood phrase, an excellent good phrase, in sooth. I thank thee, Jew,\r\nfor teaching me that word. Those who believe in the security of the\r\nGladstonian safeguards, and the pacific disposition of the Nationalist\r\nparty, will perhaps be able to put a friendly construction on the\r\npassage which begins:--\"And it is already settled that no man in\r\nIreland is to bear a rifle unless he be a soldier of the army of\r\noccupation, which will still be encamped on our soil 'to mak siccare.'\r\nThis hateful and degrading prohibition is what no Parnellite can\r\npretend to consent to for any reasonable or unreasonable fraction of a\r\nperiod of reasonable finality.\" Those who believe in the severe\r\ncommercial morality and rigid honesty of the authors of the Plan of\r\nCampaign will doubtless find their favourable opinion confirmed by the\r\nsucceeding remarkable complaint. \"And the Irish Legislature--would it\r\nnot be better policy now to refuse to regard it as a Parliament and to\r\nrefuse to call it so?--is forbidden to take away any person's property\r\nexcept by process of law, in accordance with settled principles and\r\nprecedents. There's trouble here.\" There is indeed trouble here. An\r\nIrish Parliament which could not \"take away any person's property\r\nexcept by process of law\" would be shorn of its principal functions,\r\nwould fail to justify its existence, would fall immeasurably short of\r\nthe popular expectation, would have, in fact, no earthly _raison d'\r\nêtre_. An Irish Parliament without power to take from him that hath,\r\nand give unto him that hath not, would be without functions, and the\r\nfoinest pisintry in the wuruld would instantly rebel against such a\r\nnonentity. The farmers remember the oft-repeated statements of Mr.\r\nTimothy Healy to the effect that \"landlordism is the prop of the\r\nBritish Government, and it is that we want to kick away.\" And the\r\nbenefit accruing from this vigorous action was by the same eloquent\r\npatriot very plainly stated. \"The people of this country ought never\r\nto be satisfied so long as a single penny of rent is paid for a sod of\r\nland in the whole of Ireland.\" And they never will be satisfied, with\r\nor without rent. Their dissatisfaction has enabled Mr. Healy to put\r\nmoney in his purse. The wail of a great people whose Parliament will\r\nnot be allowed to rob from all and sundry is accounted for towards the\r\nclose of the article. There will be trouble \"as soon as the Dublin\r\nLegislature becomes hard pushed for money, which will be desperately\r\noften from the beginning, as is now plain.\"\r\n\r\nThese considerations are closely observed by the people of Strabane,\r\nthe best of whom are steady loyalists. The town is bright, brisk,\r\nthriving, and Scotch. Or rather the Scottish element is conspicuous in\r\nthe main street, with its McCollum and Mackey, its Crawford and Aikin,\r\nits Colhoun and Finlay, its Lowry and McAnaw. There are several shirt\r\nfactories, of which the biggest is run by Stewart and Macdonald. A\r\nnumber of names which may be either English or Scotch are equally to\r\nthe front, Taylor, White, and Simms, cheek by jowl with doubtful cases\r\nlike McCosker and McElhinney, which, however, smack somewhat of the\r\ntartan. Macfarlane issues a notice, which is printed by Blair, and\r\nbesides White I notice Black and Gray. The establishment of Mr.\r\nSnodgrass, near the Scotch Boot Stores, was remindful of Charles\r\nDickens, and the small flautist piping \"Annie Laurie,\" put me in mind\r\nof Robert Burns, the hairdresser of Warrenpoint. It became difficult\r\nto realise that this was Ireland. Not far away are two mountains,\r\nnamed respectively Mary Gray and Bessie Bell. The hills round Strabane\r\nretain their Irish names, but the genius of the place is distinctly\r\nScottish. There are Irish parts of Strabane, but they are unpleasant\r\nand unimportant. The Unionists pay three-fourths of the rates, but\r\nthere is only one Loyalist on the Town Council, which has nine\r\nmembers, of which number three retire annually in rotation. The Town\r\nCommissioners, as a whole, are not highly esteemed by the people of\r\nStrabane. One of them, the leading light of the local Nationalist\r\nparty, is rated at £8. Another, a working plasterer, is the accredited\r\nagent of the Home Rule party in this division of Tyrone, and is\r\nplayfully called the Objector-General, on account of his\r\ncharacteristic method of working in the Registry Court. The Chairman,\r\nwho occupies the position of Mayor, but without the title, is rated at\r\n£13. Two small publicans are rated at £12 and £27 respectively. The\r\nremainder, including the Conservative member, are rated sufficiently\r\nhigh to be regarded as having some stake in the country, and no\r\nobjection is taken on this score. But the Strabane Town Commissioners\r\nare intolerant. Apart from the fact that they admit only one Unionist\r\nto a body which derives three-fourths of its funds from Unionists,\r\nthey are distinctly intolerant in the matter of employment. They\r\nemploy no Protestants. Their solicitor, Mr. William Wilson, is indeed\r\nof the proscribed faith, but he seems to have inherited the office\r\nfrom his father. No Protestants need apply for any situation, however\r\nsmall, under the Strabane Town Council, which pays its servants with\r\nthe money of Protestants. This is the party which clamours for\r\nequality of treatment, and eternally complains of the exclusiveness of\r\nProtestantism. A well-known Strabaner said:--\r\n\r\n\"If we are shut out from the Town Council, it is, to some extent, our\r\nown fault. Two causes mainly contributed to this result--the apathy of\r\nthe Unionist voters, and the unwillingness of our best men to rub up\r\nagainst some of the men put forward by the other party. I say some\r\nonly, not all. We did not care to be mixed up with fellows of low\r\nclass, especially when they are as ignorant as possible. Then again,\r\nwe are well represented on the Poor Law Board, which really has all\r\nthe power, attending as it does to sanitation and so forth. The\r\nNationalists greedily snap at every shred and semblance of power, and\r\nleave no stone unturned to get the mastery. There has come a sad\r\nchange over the poor folks, that is, the Roman Catholics. Formerly\r\nthey were civil and kind, and we all got on famously together. If a\r\nProtestant was out in the country a mile or two away, and rain came\r\non, they were hospitable with that beautiful old courtesy which was\r\none of the best things the nation possessed. It was something to\r\nboast of. It was unique, and could not be found in such perfection out\r\nof Ireland. It's all over now. Since Mr. Gladstone commenced to\r\ndestroy the country the poor folks hereabouts have changed very much\r\nfor the worse, and if you now got caught in a shower while out in the\r\ncountry you might be drowned before they would ask you to take\r\nshelter. They expect to be enjoying our property very shortly. They\r\nfully believe that they will soon have the land and goods that we have\r\nworked for and earned by the sweat of our brows, while they have stood\r\nby complaining, instead of doing their best to get on. What shall I do\r\nif Home Rule becomes law? Just this--I shall get out of the country in\r\ndouble-quick time. There will be no security for life or property. The\r\ncountry will be a perfect Hell upon Earth.\"\r\n\r\nThere are three rivers at Strabane, which, notwithstanding the neglect\r\nof the guide-books, is well worth the tourist's attention. The Mourne,\r\na really beautiful river, runs beside the town, washing the very\r\nhouses of a long street, and meeting the Finn, another fine river, in\r\nthe meadows near Lifford, which is in Donegal, but for all that only\r\nten minutes' walk from Strabane. From the confluence the river is\r\ncalled the Foyle, so that from the splendid bridge leading into\r\nLifford may be seen the rare spectacle of three considerable rivers in\r\none meadow. Lifford is very clean and very pretty. The gaol is the\r\nmost striking building, and I wandered through its deserted corridors,\r\ndesolate as those of Monaghan. There were some strange marks in the\r\nprincipal square; a number of parallel lines which puzzled me. I\r\nturned to the gaoler who had just liberated me for some explanation.\r\n\r\n\"Faith, thin, it's the militia officers that made them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Studying fortification?\"\r\n\r\n\"Divil a fortification, thin. 'Tis lawn tennis it is, jist.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was. Two courts of lawn tennis in the square of the county\r\ntown of Donegal! That will give some idea of the business traffic.\r\n\r\nAn experienced electioneerer said:--\"We had an awful fight before we\r\ncould return Lord Frederick Hamilton for North Tyrone. We had all our\r\nwork cut out, for although we have on paper a majority of about one\r\nhundred, many of our people are non-resident landlords, or army and\r\nnavy men, and they are not here to vote for us. So that our majority\r\nof forty-nine was a close thing, though not so close as we expected.\r\nThe other side do not fight fair. Their tricks in the Registry Court\r\nare most discreditable. Both parties fight the register, the\r\nNationalists expending any amount of time and money, and showing such\r\nenthusiasm as our people never show. And this is the reason. Our Scots\r\nfarmers--for they are as Scottish as their ancestors of two hundred\r\nyears ago--_will_ stick to their work, and persist in making their\r\nwork the paramount concern of their lives. They cannot believe that\r\nobjections will be made to their names on the register, and when such\r\nobjections have been raised they must appear in person, and there\r\ncomes the difficulty. For if it's harvest time, or if engaged on any\r\nnecessary work, you cannot get them to the Court. At Newtonstewart\r\nwhere the bulk of the voters are Protestant, no less than five\r\nsubstantial farmers were objected to successively. The inspector, that\r\nis, the Nationalist agent who is supposed to look into the claims of\r\nthe Unionist party, said that one had assigned the farm to his son, or\r\nthat another was not the real tenant, or that something else was\r\nwrong, and as this statement established a _primâ-facie_ case, it\r\nbecame necessary for the persons whose votes were questioned to come\r\ninto Court. Now, there is the rub. The objector calculates that some\r\nwill not come, for he knows how hard it is to get them to come. Then\r\nthey stuff the register with bogus names. They put down dozens of\r\npeople who don't exist, with the object of polling somebody for\r\nthem--if any of them should escape the scrutiny of the opposite\r\nparty--and with the further object of causing the Unionist party\r\nexpense and loss of time. For there is a stamp duty of threepence to\r\nbe paid for every objection, and then the Loyalist lawyer and his\r\nstaff are kept at work for six weeks, instead of a fortnight or three\r\nweeks, which should be the outside time taken. Then the annoyance and\r\nloss of time to the industrious Unionist voters, who have to leave\r\ntheir work. This does not hurt the opposite party, who have nothing\r\nelse to do, and who in these wrangling affairs are in their native\r\nelement, thoroughly enjoying themselves. What makes the work so hard\r\nfor the Loyalist lawyer is the fact that our folks are all for\r\nbusiness and look upon politics as a nuisance, while the other side\r\nmake politics the principal business of their lives. They are\r\ntremendously energetic in this, but wonderfully supine in everything\r\nelse. In politics they spare neither time nor money, nor (for the\r\nmatter of that) swearing. The lying that goes on in the Registry Court\r\nwould astonish Englishmen. The Papist party themselves admit that they\r\nare awful liars, but they laugh it off, and plead that all is fair in\r\nlove and war.\r\n\r\n\"The priest sits in the Revision Court all day long. In these Revision\r\nCourts every priest is an agent of the Separatist party. They watch\r\nthe inspectors and witnesses, keeping a keen eye on those who do not\r\nswear hard enough, ready to reward or censure, as the case may be.\r\nEvery Sunday the people are instructed from the altar as to their\r\npolitical action. This eternal elbowing-on keeps them up to their\r\nwork, as well as the promises of the good things to come. Our folks\r\nare never worked up. That makes it very hard for us. They came up\r\npretty well last time, though. But when one side is all for business,\r\nand the other side all for politics, the business folks are\r\nhandicapped.\r\n\r\n\"The Nationalists ran John Dillon on one occasion. We smashed him up.\r\nNo respectable constituency would ever return any of his class, and we\r\nresented the attempt to couple us with a man of that stamp. He was\r\nbeaten by several hundreds. Then they ran a Mr. Wylie, who had been a\r\nLand Commissioner for this district. We thought that positively\r\nindecent, and we wondered that any gentleman would put himself in such\r\na position. He had been round here reducing rents, and then he came\r\nforward as a candidate. We accuse him of bad taste, nothing worse. He\r\nonly made one speech, though, and that was to thank the people for\r\nplacing him at the bottom of the poll. He confined himself to\r\ncanvassing. If he had once mounted the hustings we would have heckled\r\nhim about the Land Commission business. He knew that and never gave us\r\na chance. It was a cute stroke of policy to bring him forward. He was\r\na Presbyterian, and might be Land Commissioner again. At least the\r\npeople thought so. Then they tried a Professor Dougherty, of\r\nLondonderry, another Home Rule Presbyterian; for there are a few,\r\nthough you could count them off on your fingers, and they are a\r\nhundred times outnumbered by the Conservative Catholics. He belonged\r\nto Magee College, and we trotted out the whole of his co-professors\r\nagainst him. We never had a meeting without one or other of his\r\ncolleagues pitching into him--a great joke it was.\r\n\r\n\"Over the water Mr. E.T. Herdman tried to get in for East Donegal, a\r\nvery popular man who pays thirty or forty thousand pounds a year in\r\nwages. The people promised to support him. The priests promised to\r\nsupport him. They asked what would they do else, and what did he take\r\nthem for? They are so anxious about employment, these good men. All\r\nthey want is the good of the people. You saw how they ran after the\r\nLord Lieutenant saying: Only find us work! You see how they run after\r\nthe Countess of Aberdeen, who is encouraging industry (and about whom\r\nthere are some pickings). What did the people of East Donegal do,\r\nunder the guidance of their clergy? They returned Arthur O'Connor, who\r\nnever did anything for them, who never darkens their doors, and who is\r\nutterly unknown to them. What can you say for them after that?\"\r\n\r\nThe politician who was preferred to Mr. Herdman probably promised to\r\ngive the people \"all they want,\" while the Unionist was only paying\r\nthem wages for working all the year round. And besides this, Mr.\r\nO'Connor's speeches were probably more full-flavoured, more\r\nsoul-satisfying, than those of Mr. Herdman, who, being a practical man\r\nof business, and having a sense of responsibility, would only talk\r\ncommon-sense, and would promise no more than he could hope to perform.\r\nMr. O'Connor speaks in the epic style. He reminds you of Bombastes\r\nFurioso, or Ancient Pistol, with a subtle admixture of Falstaff and\r\nParolles. He belongs to the lime-light and blue fire school of\r\noratory, and backs up a vivid imagination with a virulent hatred of\r\nEngland. The raging sea of sedition which surged around us is now\r\nsilent enough. It Now hath quite forgot to rave While birds of calm\r\nsit brooding on the charmed wave. The reason why is plain or should be\r\nplain to anything above the level of a Gladstonian intellect. It\r\ncannot be amiss, though, to recall a specimen of Mr. Arthur O'Connor's\r\nstyle, that so we may judge of his superior acceptability to the\r\npeople of East Donegal. Speaking after the Union of Hearts had been\r\ninvented and patented (provisionally), Mr. O'Connor said:--\r\n\r\n\"I know it to be a fact that in whatever war Great Britain may be\r\ninvolved, whatever Power she may have to struggle with, that Power can\r\ncount on a hundred thousand Irish arms to fight under her flag against\r\nGreat Britain--(great cheering). Does not the Government of the United\r\nStates know perfectly well that at three days' notice it could have a\r\nforce, of which one hundred thousand would only be a fraction, a force\r\nwilling to serve against Great Britain for the love of the thing,\r\nwithout any pay?--(renewed applause). And it is not amiss that the\r\nGovernment of England should know it also\"--(continued applause). The\r\nM.P. who made this speech is one of the politicians now dominating the\r\nEnglish Parliament at Westminster. It is in response to the clamour of\r\nhim and his sort that the gag is put on men like Balfour, Goschen,\r\nChamberlain. This little gem set in the silver sea, this isle, this\r\nrealm, this England, is becoming a paltry concern, is fast being\r\nGladstoned into drivelling imbecility. What does O'Connor mean by the\r\n100,000 Irish arms? Does he mean 50,000 Irishmen? The point is\r\nobscure, as will be seen from the oratory of another distinguished\r\npatriot, who said, \"Ten millions of Irish hearts are beating with high\r\nanticipation, ten millions of eyes are looking forward to the passing\r\nof the bill.\" A very large number of one-eyed Irishry.\r\n\r\nThe _Irish Catholic_ makes a slip. The journal approves of Mr.\r\nGladstone's closure, but with reference to the refusal of a newspaper\r\nto print a Dr. Laggan's letter about, something delivers itself\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n  The application of the gag in polities has always been the resort\r\n  of the stupid, incapable, and tyrannical politician. Whether\r\n  tried in Russia, in France, or in England of old, it has\r\n  invariably failed in its purpose. The stifling of the individual\r\n  voice becomes of small advantage when the object-lesson of its\r\n  possessor with a bandage across his mouth, and his hands tied\r\n  behind his back, is presented to the populace. Just as the gag\r\n  has failed elsewhere it is, we are glad to think, destined to\r\n  fail in Ireland also, and, indeed, if it were not so destined,\r\n  Ireland would be precisely the best country to live out of.\r\n\r\nSo much for absent-mindedness. It is pleasant to be able to agree with\r\nthe _Irish Catholic_ for once.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the confusion is deepening. The Grand Juries of Ireland\r\nare passing unanimous resolutions condemning the bill. The Nationalist\r\nparty condemns the bill. The Scottish Covenanters, who have not\r\ndelivered a political pronouncement for more than two hundred years,\r\nand who never vote either way, have risen in their might and cursed\r\nthe bill, smiting the Papists hip and thigh with great slaughter, and\r\ndenouncing the movement as purely in the interests of Romanist\r\nascendency. Be it understood that these religionists live in Ireland\r\nand date their malediction from Coleraine. But nothing will stop the\r\nG.O.M.'s gallop over the precipice. Let him go, but let him not drag\r\nthe country after him. And in after years his Administration will be\r\ndescribed in words like those of Burke, who, speaking of the Gladstone\r\nof his day, said, \"He made an Administration so checked and speckled,\r\nhe put together a piece of joinery so crossly indented and whimsically\r\ndovetailed, a cabinet so variously inlaid, such a piece of diversified\r\nmosaic, such a tesselated pavement without cement, that it was indeed\r\na curious show, but utterly unsafe to touch and unsure to stand upon.\r\nThe colleagues whom he had assorted at the same boards, stared at each\r\nother, and were obliged to ask, 'Sir, your name?' 'Sir, you have the\r\nadvantage of me. Mr. Such-a-one, I beg a thousand pardons.' I venture\r\nto say that persons were there who had never spoken to each other in\r\ntheir lives until they found themselves together they knew not how,\r\npigging together heads and points in the same truckle bed.\" This is\r\nprophecy.\r\n\r\nHave you heard that Mr. Balfour, who went through Ireland without an\r\nescort, is unable to move about England without the protection of a\r\nhundred and fifty mounted police to save him from English Home Rulers\r\nwho are burning to avenge the wrongs of Ireland? No? England is badly\r\nserved in the matter of news. They manage these things better in\r\nIreland. A leading Dublin Nationalist print has a number of prominent\r\nheadlines referring to the \"facts.\" \"The Arch-Coercionist Protected by\r\nPolice. Caught in His Own Trap.\" The writer even goes into particulars\r\nand tells how \"effusively\" the ex-Secretary thanked the police for\r\nprotecting his \"frail personality.\" The Irish moonlight patriots are\r\ngratified. Balfour was their aversion. During his reign it could no\r\nlonger be said that the safest place in Ireland, the one spot where no\r\nharm could befall you, was the criminal dock. Balfour stamped out\r\nmidnight villainy, and helped the industrious poor. Wherefore he is\r\nhonoured by honest Irishmen and hated by all rascalry. Ireland needs\r\nhim again with his _suaviter in modo, fortiter in re_; his fairness\r\nand firmness, his hatred of tyranny, his determination to do right\r\nthough the heavens should fall. With Balfour in office the Irish\r\nagitators have hard work to keep the broil agoing. They hate him\r\nbecause of the integrity which won the confidence of the Irish people,\r\nand because of the substantial benefit arising from his rule, a\r\nbenefit there was no denying because it was seen and known of all men.\r\nThe return of Balfour to power threatens to cut the ground from under\r\nthe feet of those who live by agitation. They dread him above\r\neverything. They are horror-stricken at the prospect of a return to\r\nhis light railways and heavy sentences. Hence this attempt to damage\r\nhis prestige. Unhappy Mr. Balfour! To be protected by one hundred and\r\nfifty mounted police, and not to know of it! And the venal English\r\npress which conceals the fact, what shall be said of it? Where would\r\nEngland be but for Irish newspaper enterprise?\r\n\r\nStrabane, July 22nd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 52.--HOW THE PRIESTS CONTROL THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a terribly Protestant place. The people are unpatriotic and do\r\nnot want Home Rule. They speak of the Nationalist members with\r\ncontempt, and say they would rather be represented by gentlemen. They\r\nare very incredulous, and refuse to believe in the honesty of \"honest\"\r\nJohn Dillon. They say that Davitt is a humbug and Healy a blackguard.\r\nThey speak of O'Brien's breeches without weeping, and opine that\r\nDavitt's imprisonments and Healy's horse-whipping served them both\r\nright. These misguided Irishmen affect to believe that the English\r\nlaws are good, that Ireland is a splendid country, and that things\r\nwould be far better as they are. Raphoe is on the road to nowhere, and\r\nyet it runs a rattling tweed mill--the proprietor is a Unionist, of\r\ncourse. Queer it is to see this flourishing affair in the wilds of\r\nDonegal. Blankets, travelling rugs, and tweed for both sexes, of\r\nexcellent quality and pretty patterns. Raphoe has a cathedral, but\r\nwithout features of note. The bishop's palace is in ruins. In 1835 the\r\nbishopric was annexed to Derry. The police of this district are sad at\r\nheart. There are but few of them, very few indeed, and they have no\r\nwork to do. These Protestant districts afford no pleasurable\r\nexcitement. Work, work, work, without any intervals of moonlighting\r\nand landlord shooting. These Saxon settlers have no imagination. Like\r\nmill horses, they move in one everlasting round, unvaried even by a\r\nmodicum of brigandage. An occasional murder, a small suspicion of\r\narson, might relieve the wearisome monotony of their prosaic\r\nexistence, but they lack the poetic instinct. They have not the\r\nsporting tastes of their Keltic countrymen. They are not ashamed of\r\nthis, but even glory in it. An Orangeman asked me to quote a case of\r\nshooting from behind a wall by any of his order. He says no such thing\r\never took place, and actually boasted of it! He declared that if the\r\nbody had in future any shooting to do they would do it in the open.\r\nThe Nationalist patriots are more advanced. They know a trick worth\r\ntwo of that. The Protestant party have no experience in premeditated\r\nmurder, and must take a back seat as authorities in the matter. They\r\nhave not yet discovered that shooting from behind a wall is\r\ncomparatively safe, and safety is a paramount consideration. Landlords\r\nand agents carry rifles, and should they be missed unpleasant results\r\nmight ensue. The case of Smith, quoted in a Mayo letter, shows the\r\ndanger of missing. It is not well to place the lives of experienced\r\nand valuable murderers at the mercy of a worthless agent. The\r\nNationalist party cannot afford to expose to danger the priceless\r\nruffians whose efforts have converted Mr. Gladstone and his Tail. The\r\npatriots need every man who can shoot, and the stone walls of Ireland\r\nare a clear dispensation of Providence. To shoot in the open is a\r\nflying in the face of natural laws. The patriots are wedded to the\r\nwalls, or, as they call them in Ireland, ditches. The \"back iv a\r\nditch\" is a proverbial expression for the coign of vantage assumed for\r\nthe slaying of your enemy. Like General Jackson, the Irish are\r\nStone-wallers, but in another sense. They have brought the Art of\r\nMurder with Safety to its highest pitch of perfection. They are the\r\nleading exponents of mural musketry.\r\n\r\nA moderate Unionist said:--\"To speak of tolerance in the same breath\r\nwith Irish Roman Catholicism is simply nonsense. You will not find any\r\nbelievers in this theory among the Protestants of this district,\r\nalthough being more numerous they are not so much alarmed as the\r\nunfortunate residents in Romanist centres. We cannot believe anything\r\nso entirely opposed to the evidence of our senses. A Protestant farmer\r\nof my acquaintance, the only Protestant on a certain estate, has\r\nconfided to me his intention of leaving the district should the bill\r\npass, because he thinks he could not afterwards live comfortably among\r\nhis old neighbours. A woman who had occupied the position of servant\r\nin a Protestant family for forty years, recently went to her mistress\r\nwith tears in her eyes, and said her clergy had ordered her to leave,\r\nas further continuance in the situation would be dangerous to her\r\neternal interests. A girl who had been four years in another situation\r\nhas also left on the same plea. The progress of Romanism is distinctly\r\ntowards intolerance. It becomes narrower and narrower as time goes on.\r\nThis is proved by the fact that formerly dispensations were granted\r\nfor mixed marriages--that is, Catholic and Protestant--on the\r\nunderstanding that the children should be brought up, the boys in the\r\nfather's faith, the girls in the mother's. All that is now changed,\r\nand dispensations are only granted on condition that all the children\r\nshall be Roman Catholics. The absolute despotism of the Catholic\r\nclergy is every year becoming more marked. They rule with a rod of\r\niron. A bailiff of my acquaintance who had paid all his clerical dues,\r\nwas very badly treated because he was a bailiff and for no other\r\nearthly reason. No priest in Ireland would perform the marriage\r\nceremony for his daughter, who actually went to America to be married.\r\nShe was compelled to this, the bridegroom going out in another boat.\r\nThe ceremony being performed, they returned to Ireland, and the girl's\r\nfather assures me that the affair cost him fifty pounds. The case of\r\nMrs. Taylor, of Ballinamore, was a very cruel one, which a word from\r\nthe priest of the district would have altogether prevented. But that\r\nword was not spoken, for she was a Protestant. Her brother had\r\ndischarged a cotter, I do not know whether justly or unjustly, but\r\nalthough Mrs. Taylor had nothing whatever to do with the affair--and\r\nit was not asserted that she had--she was severely boycotted. The\r\nbrother, who was the guilty party, if anybody was guilty, was rather\r\nout of the way, and being a substantial farmer, quite able to hold his\r\nown, could not be got at. But Mrs. Taylor was a widow, and lived by\r\nrunning a corn mill. Nobody went near it, nobody would have anything\r\nto do with the widow, who, however, struggled on, until the mill was\r\nburnt to the ground. She was compensated by the County, and rebuilt\r\nthe mill. This spring it was again burnt down, and she is ruined. Her\r\nproperty is now in the Receiver's hands, and she is going through the\r\nBankruptcy Court.\r\n\r\n\"The Home Rule Bill has produced, with much that is tragic, some\r\ncomical effects. Since the passing of the Second Reading our servant\r\nhas become unmanageable. She is evidently affected in the same way as\r\nmany of the most ignorant Papists, believing that the time will soon\r\ncome when, by the operation of the new Act, she will so far rise in\r\nthe social scale as to be quite independent of her situation. This\r\nkind of thing is visible all around. There is work for everyone about\r\nhere, but the farmers cannot get labourers. In many parts of Ireland\r\nthe cry is 'There is no employment,' but here it is not so. There is\r\nplenty of work at good wages, waiting to be done, but men cannot be\r\ngot to do it. The Sion Mills, which employ twelve hundred people,\r\neight hundred Catholics and four hundred Protestants, would employ\r\nmany more if they could be had. The labourers of this district are\r\nCatholic, and they prefer to stand loafing about to the performance of\r\nregular work. They believe that a perpetual holiday is coming, and\r\nthat they may as well have a foretaste of the ease which is to come.\r\nUp to the times of the Home Rule Bill they were industrious enough.\r\nThe Catholics of Tyrone and Donegal are not like those of the South\r\nand West. They are very superior, both in cleanliness and industry.\r\nHaving for so long mingled with the Saxon settlers of the North, they\r\nhave imbibed some of their industrial spirit, and until lately there\r\nwas no reasonable ground of complaint. Their morale is unhappily now\r\nsadly shaken, and whether the bill passes or not it will be long, very\r\nlong, before they resume their industrial pursuits with the energy and\r\nregularity of men who have nothing on which to depend but their own\r\nexertions. And whatever happens to the bill, the country will be the\r\npoorer for its introduction. Ireland is now an excellent country to\r\nlive out of, and those who can leave it have the most enviable lot.\"\r\n\r\nA man of few words said:--\"Under Home Rule the landlords may take\r\ntheir hook at once. Their property will disappear instanter. The\r\ntenant has already more lien on the land than the fee-simple _in toto_\r\nis worth, and with a Nationalist Parliament he would pay no rent at\r\nall. The judges would not grant processes, and if they did their\r\nwarrants could not be enforced. The destruction of the landlord class\r\nmeans the destruction of English influence in Ireland. A short time\r\nago two men were talking together. One was doubtful, and said,\r\n'Michael Davitt says we must have only five acres of land. Now you\r\nhave twenty-five acres, you'll lose twenty.' 'Ye didn't read it\r\nright,' said the other. ''Tis the landlords and them that holds a\r\nthousand and two thousand acres that'll be dispossessed, and their\r\nland divided among the people. In six years we'll have the counthry\r\nindependent, and then we'll do as we like. Every Saxon will be\r\ncleared out of the counthry. Only keep yer tongue between yer teeth.\r\nBe quiet and wait a bit till ye see what happens.'\r\n\r\n\"'But,' said the objector, 'them Ulster fellows'll give us no peace.\r\nThey have arms, and I'm towld they have a lot of sojers among them,\r\nand that they're drilled, and have officers, regular military\r\nofficers. Sure, how would we do as we liked, wid an army of them\r\nfellows agin us? And they're devils to fight, they say.'\r\n\r\n\"'Arrah now, sure, ye're mighty ignorant, thin. Sure, they say they'll\r\nnot pay taxes. Thin the sojers comes in and shoots them down, and you\r\nand I stands by wid our tongues in our cheeks. 'Tis no consarn of\r\nours. We have nothin' to say to it, one way or another. The Orangemen\r\ncan shoot the troops, and the troops can shoot the Orangemen, and they\r\ncan murdher each other to their heart's contint, and fight like\r\nKilkenny cats, till there's nothin' left but the tail. And good enough\r\nfor the likes of them. Sure, twill be great divarshun for them that\r\nlooks on. And that's the way of it, d'ye mind me?'\"\r\n\r\nThis worthy politician must have been a perfect Machiavelli. His\r\nfavourite saying was doubtless 'A plague on both your houses,' and\r\nwith equal certainty his favourite quotation the bardic 'Whether\r\nRoderigo kill Cassio, or Cassio kill Roderigo, or each kill the other,\r\nevery way makes my gain.' His theory of Nationalist progress was\r\nfour-square and complete, and showed a neat dovetailing of means with\r\nthe end. There is some justification for his simple faith. He has seen\r\nMr. Gladstone and his supporters, converted _en bloc_, including the\r\ngreat Sir William Harcourt, styled by the Parnellite sheet \"the\r\nnew-born, emancipator of Ireland,\" the unambitious and retiring\r\nLabouchere, the potent Cunninghame Graham, the profound Conybeare, and\r\nthe pertinacious Cobb--he has seen these great luminaries throwing in\r\ntheir lot with the sworn enemies of England, and doing all that in\r\nthem lies to disintegrate and destroy the Empire, and the rude peasant\r\nmay be pardoned for expecting that the British army will, at his call,\r\ncomplete what these worthies have so well begun. To narrow loyalist\r\nliberties, to tax loyalist industry, to create a loyalist rebellion,\r\nand to have the loyalists shot by other loyalists is an excellent\r\nall-round scheme. This is indeed a high-souled patriotism.\r\n\r\nContinuing, my friend said:--\"A Romanist neighbour of mine had\r\npromised to vote for Lord Frederick Hamilton, for, as he said, he had\r\nno confidence in any Irish Parliament. Just before the battle he\r\ncalled and said he must vote the other way, for Father Somebody had\r\ncalled on him and said, 'I hear you are going to vote for Lord\r\nFrederick Hamilton.' Admitted. 'Then you may call in Lord Frederick\r\nHamilton to visit you on your death-bed. You can get him to administer\r\nthe Sacraments of the Church.' 'What could I do?' said the farmer. 'I\r\ncouldn't go against the priest. I could not incur the anger of my\r\nclergy without imperilling my immortal soul. Besides that, I'd be made\r\na mark and a mock of. Perhaps I'd be refused admission to Mass, like\r\nthe men in South Meath who voted contrary to the orders of the\r\npriest. So to save my soul I'll have to vote against my conscience. No\r\nuse in telling me we will vote by ballot. Them priests knows\r\neverything. They fix themselves in the polling booths, and they can\r\nread what way ye went in your face. Sure, they know us all inside and\r\nout, since we were So high. We couldn't desave them.' Then they always\r\nact as personation agents, and they order people who can read and\r\nwrite to say they can't do either. So they have to declare aloud whom\r\nthey will vote for, and the priest hears for himself. This is the true\r\nexplanation of the fearful illiteracy of Donegal, as revealed by the\r\nvoting papers. Is it likely that in one quarter of Donegal--that is,\r\nin one-fourth part of one county--there should be more illiterates\r\nthan in the whole of Scotland? Yet according to the election returns,\r\nit was even so. The fact that the people declared themselves\r\nilliterate at the orders of the priest, when they were not illiterate,\r\nshows how degraded are the people, and how completely they are under\r\nthe thumb of the priests.\"\r\n\r\nA Protestant clergyman on his holidays, and not belonging to these\r\nparts, was very eloquent on the subject of political popery. In all my\r\njourneyings I have never interviewed a Protestant parson, save and\r\nexcept Dr. Kane, whom I met in the Royal Avenue, Belfast, along with\r\nthe Marquess of Londonderry and Colonel Saunderson, as recorded in an\r\nearly letter. I was disposed to believe that the English public might\r\nregard their evidence as being prejudiced, and therefore of little\r\nvalue. But my Raphoe acquaintance was a singularly modest and moderate\r\nman, upon whose opinion you at once felt you could rely. He said:--\"My\r\nCatholic neighbours were friends until lately. Nobody could have been\r\nmore kind and obliging. There was no sensible difference between us,\r\nexcept that they did not come to church. They would do anything for me\r\nand my family; we would do anything for them. Lately they have changed\r\ntheir manner. They have grown cold. Their children playing with mine\r\nhave let out the secret. Through them we learn that the days of the\r\nProtestants are numbered. Father says this, and mother says that. My\r\nland is disposed of among my Papist neighbours. All my congregation\r\nhave similar experiences. This makes things very unpleasant, and\r\nnothing can ever bring back the kind, neighbourly feeling of old. The\r\nPapist clergy are the cause of it all. Their church is nothing if not\r\nabsolute, and dominancy is their aim. The Protestant party will get no\r\nquarter. I do not say we shall be murdered, or even personally\r\nmaltreated. But when the large majority of a district want to see the\r\nback of you, with the idea of dividing your farm or your Church lands,\r\nthey have many ways of making things so unpleasant that you would soon\r\nbe glad to go. For my own part, I should endeavour to leave the\r\ncountry at the earliest possible moment. And that is what 999\r\nProtestants out of 1,000 would tell you. The clergy are inimical to\r\nEngland. Here and there you find a Conservative, and, strange to say,\r\nthe scholarly men, what you might call the gentlemanly party, are\r\nagainst Home Rule. These, unhappily, are very few. The Maynooth men\r\nare violently against England.\" This cleric called attention to the\r\nopinion of Dr. Wylie, of Edinburgh, who has made a special study of\r\nthe matter. The learned professor says the more palpable decadence of\r\nIreland dates from the erection of Maynooth. Before the institution of\r\nthis school the Irish priests were educated in France, then the least\r\nultramontane country in popish Europe. They could not be there without\r\nimbibing a certain portion of the spirit of \"Gallican liberties.\" It\r\nwas argued that by educating them at home, we should have a class of\r\npriests more national and more attached to British rule; at least we\r\nwould have gentlemen and scholars, who would humanise their flocks.\r\nThese have since been shown to be miserable sophisms. \"Maynooth is a\r\nthoroughly ultramontane school. We have exchanged the French-bred\r\npriest, illread in Dens, with low notions of the supremacy, and\r\nproportionally high notions of the British Crown, for a race of\r\ncrafty, Jesuitical, intriguing, thorough-trained priests of the\r\nultramontane school, who recognise but one power in the world--the\r\nPontifical--and who are incurably alienated from British interests and\r\nrule. The loud and fearful curses fulminated from the altar, which\r\ncome rolling across the Channel, mingled with the wrathful howls of a\r\npriest-ridden and maddened people, proclaim the result. These are your\r\nMaynooth scholars and gentlemen! These are your pious flocks, tended\r\nand fed by the lettered priests of Maynooth! Better had we flung our\r\nmoney into the sea, than sent it across the Channel, to be a curse in\r\nthe first place to Ireland, and a curse in the second place to\r\nourselves, by the demoralising and anti-national sentiments it has\r\nbeen employed to propagate. The better a priest, the worse a citizen.\r\nAnd whom have Government found their bitterest enemies? Who are the\r\nparties who have invariably withstood all their plans for civilising\r\nIreland? Why, those very priests whom they have clothed, and educated,\r\nand fed.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, according to an expert, are the men who now manipulate the\r\nvoting powers of the Irish people. The priests do not deny that they\r\nhave this full control; they merely say they have a right to it.\r\nBishop Walsh, of Dublin, says that as priests, and independent of all\r\nhuman organisations, they have an inalienable and indisputable right\r\nto guide the people in this momentous proceeding, as in every other\r\nproceeding where the interests of Catholicity as well as the interests\r\nof Irish nationality are involved. He suggested, and the suggestion\r\nwas adopted, that at all the political conventions held in the various\r\nIrish counties an ex-officio vote should be given to the priests! This\r\nembodied the principle that if Home Rule became law the Irish\r\npriesthood would have privileges which would make them absolute rulers\r\nof Ireland. Cardinal Logue says:--\"We are face to face at the present\r\nmoment with a great disobedience to ecclesiastical authority.\" This\r\nwas in view of the Parnellite rebellion against priestly dictation.\r\n\"The doctrines of the present day,\" said the good Cardinal, \"are\r\ncalculated (horror!) to wean the people from the priests' advice, to\r\nseparate the priests from the people, and (here the Cardinal must have\r\nshivered with unspeakable disgust) TO LET THE PEOPLE USE THEIR OWN\r\nJUDGMENT.\" These are Cardinal's words, not mine. To make any comment\r\nwould be to gild refined gold, to paint the lily, to throw a perfume\r\no'er the violet. Well might Mr. Gladstone say nineteen years ago:--\"It\r\nis the peculiarity of Roman theology, that by thrusting itself into\r\nthe temporal domain, it naturally, and even necessarily, comes to be a\r\nfrequent theme of political discussion.\" Archbishop Croke was the\r\ninspirer of the Tipperary troubles, worked out by his tools, Dillon,\r\nO'Brien, and Humphreys. Dr. Croke helped to found the Gaelic Athletic\r\nAssociation, which is well-known to be the nucleus of a rebel army.\r\nDr. Croke gave £5 to the Manchester Murderers' Memorial Fund, and\r\naccompanied the gift with a letter stating that the men who murdered\r\nPolice-sergeant Brett were \"wrongfully arrested, unfairly tried,\r\nbarbarously executed, and went like heroes to their doom.\" It was Dr.\r\nCroke who supported a movement to raise a pension for James Stephens,\r\nthe Fenian Head-centre, the famous Number One, the general of the\r\nIrish Revolutionary Brotherhood. We are asked to believe that this\r\ngentleman and his crew of subordinate clergy are eminently loyal, and\r\nthat the moment a Home Rule Bill puts it into their power to injure\r\nEngland, from that very moment they will become friendly indeed, will\r\ncease to do evil and learn to do well, and that the altars from which\r\nEngland is now every Sunday hotly denounced will in future vibrate\r\nwith the resonant expression of sacerdotal affection.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen must have a wonderful opinion of the gullibility of\r\nthe great Saxon race. But as they see a certain portion believe in Mr.\r\nGladstone they may expect them to believe in anything. To swallow the\r\nG.O.M. plus Harcourt, Healy, Conybeare, Cobb, O'Brien, and the Home\r\nRule Bill is indeed a wonderful feat of deglutition.\r\n\r\nRaphoe, (Co. Donegal), July 25th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 53.--WHAT THEY THINK IN COUNTY DONEGAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stranorlar people can be excessively funny. In a well-known public\r\nresort yesterday I witnessed a specimen of their sportive style. A\r\nyoung fellow was complaining that the examining doctor of some\r\nrecruiting station had refused him \"by raison of my feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heerd tell they wouldn't take men wid more than fifteen inches of\r\nfoot on thim,\" remarked a bystander. \"The Queen couldn't shtand the\r\nexpinse at all at all in leather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah, now, will ye be aisy,\" said another. \"Sure, Micky isn't all\r\nout so bad as Tim Gallagher over there beyant, that has to get up an'\r\ngo downstairs afore he can tur-rn round in bed. An' all on account iv\r\nthe size iv his feet. 'Tis thrue what I spake, divil a lie I tell ye.\r\nThe boy has to get up and go down shtairs, an' go into the sthreet,\r\nan' come up the other way afore he can tur-rn round, the crathur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hould yer whist, now, till I tell ye,\" said another. \"Ye know\r\nKerrigan's whiskey-shop. Well, one day Kerrigan was standin' chattin'\r\nwid his wife, when the shop-windy all at once wint dark, an' Kerrigan\r\nroars out, 'What for are ye puttin' up the shutters so airly?' says\r\nhe. An' faix, 'twas no wondher ye'd think it, for ould Hennessy of\r\nBallybofey had fallen down in the street, an' it was the two\r\ngood-lookin' feet of him stickin' up that was darkenin' the shop. Ax\r\nKerrigan himself av it wasn't.\"\r\n\r\nA roar of laughter followed this sally, and the rejected recruit was\r\ncomforted.\r\n\r\nStranorlar is pleasantly situated on the river Finn, in a fertile\r\nvalley surrounded by an amphitheatre of green hills, beyond which may\r\nin some direction be seen the more imposing summits of the Donegal\r\nhighlands. The walk to Meenglas, Lord Lifford's Irish residence, would\r\nbe considered of wonderful beauty if its extensive views were visible\r\nanywhere near Birmingham; but in Ireland, where lovely scenery is so\r\nuncommonly common, you hardly give it a second glance. The tenantry\r\nare mostly Nationalist, if they can be said to be anything at all.\r\nThey one and all speak highly of Lord Lifford, whose kindness and\r\nlong-suffering are administered _con amore_ by genial Captain Baillie.\r\nThey have no opinions on Home Rule or, indeed, on any other political\r\nsubject, and will agree with anything the stranger may wish. Whatever\r\nyou profess as your own opinion is certain to be theirs, and like\r\nArtemus Ward they might conclude their letters with \"I don't know what\r\nyour politics are, but I agree with them.\" Every man Jack of the\r\nCatholic peasantry votes as he is told by his priest, and no amount of\r\nargument, no amount of most convincing logic, no earthly power could\r\nmake him do otherwise. He will agree with you, will swear all you say,\r\nwill go further than you go yourself, will clinch every argument you\r\noffer in the most enthusiastic way. Then he will vote in the opposite\r\ndirection. He thinks that in voting against the priest he would be\r\nvoting against God, and his religion compels him to conscientiously\r\nvote against his conscience, if any. A burning and shining light among\r\nthe Home Rulers of Stranorlar having been indicated, I contrived to\r\nmeet him accidentally as it were, and after some preliminary remarks\r\nof a casual nature my friend informed me that he was agin Home Rule,\r\nas, in his opinion, it would desthroy the counthry; that the farmers\r\nbelieved they would get the land for nothing, and that they were told\r\nthis by \"priests and lawyers;\" that he believed this to be a delusion\r\nfrom which the people would have a dreadful awakening; that\r\nProtestants were better off, cleaner, honester than Catholics; that\r\nthey were much more industrious and far better farmers, and so forth,\r\nand so forth. This man is a red hot Nationalist, and was under the\r\nimpression he was \"having his leg pulled,\" hence his accommodating\r\nspeech. When taxed with flagrant insincerity he only smiled, and\r\ntacitly admitted the soft impeachment. Farmers you meet in rural lanes\r\nwill profess earnest Unionism, but--find out their religion--you need\r\nask no more. Whatever they may say, whatever their alleged opinions\r\nmay be, matters not a straw. They must and will vote as the priest\r\ntells them. So that the last franchise Act endows every priest with a\r\nthousand votes or so. Will anybody attempt to disprove this? Will any\r\nliving Irishman venture to contradict this statement? The fact being\r\nadmitted, Englishmen may be trusted to see its effect. Is there any\r\nclass or trading interest which would be by working men entrusted with\r\nsuch enormous power? And these thousand-vote priests are unfriendly to\r\nEngland, as is proved by their own utterances and by innumerable overt\r\nacts. All of which merits consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Stranorlar folks are warm politicians. At the present moment\r\nfeeling runs particularly high, on account of the riot on King\r\nWilliam's Day, to wit, July twelfth. Two Orangemen were returning from\r\nCastlefinn, a few miles away, where a demonstration had taken place,\r\nand passing through Stranorlar, accompanied by their sisters, they\r\nwere set upon by the populace, and brutally maltreated. Several shots\r\nwere fired, and some of the rioters were slightly wounded or rather\r\ngrazed by snipe shot, but not so seriously as to stop their daily\r\navocations. The Catholic party allege that the Orangemen assaulted the\r\nvillage in general, firing without provocation. The Protestant party\r\nsay that this is absurd, and that it is not yet known who fired the\r\nshots. A second case, less serious, is also on the carpet. A solitary\r\nOrangeman returning from the same celebration is said to have been\r\nwaylaid, beaten, and robbed by a number of men who went two miles to\r\nmeet with him. This also is claimed as Orange rowdyism.\r\n\r\nA Protestant handicraftsman said:--\"If we had a Catholic Parliament in\r\nDublin we should not be able to put our head out of doors. Those who\r\nin England say otherwise are very ignorant. I have no patience with\r\nthem. Only the other day I heard an Englishman who had been in the\r\ncountry six hours, all of which he had spent in a railway train,\r\narguing against an Irish gentleman who has spent all his life in the\r\ncountry. 'Give 'em their civil rights,' says this English fellow. He\r\ncould say nothing else. Give 'em their civil rights,' says he. 'What\r\ncivil rights are they deprived of?' says the other. 'Give 'em their\r\ncivil rights,' says he. That was all he could say. He was for all the\r\nworld like a poll-parrot. He was one of these well-fed fellows, with\r\nabout three inches of fat on his ribs and three inches of bone in his\r\nskull, and a power of sinse _outside_ his head. He turned round on me\r\nand asked me to agree with him. When I didn't he insulted me. 'I see\r\nby your hands,' says he, 'that you've been working with them, and not\r\nwith your brains,' says he. Well, he was a man with a gray beard, but\r\nnot a sign of gray hair on his head, so says I, 'Your beard,' says I,\r\n'is twenty-five years younger than the rest of your hair, and it looks\r\ntwenty-five years older.' I see,' says I, 'that _you_ have been\r\nworking with your jaws and not with your brains.' That made him vexed.\r\nHe didn't know what to say next, and 'twas well for him. He was too\r\nignorant for this counthry, though he might do very well for them\r\nplaces where they vote for such men as Harcourt or the like of him.\r\n\r\n\"The people of these parts are skinned alive by their religion. Not a\r\nhand's turn can be done without money. Money for christening, for\r\nconfession, for everything from the cradle to the grave. And when\r\nthey're dead the poor folks are still ruining the counthry, for their\r\nrelatives run up and down begging money to get their souls out of\r\npurgatory. I have no objection to that; let them do it if they like,\r\nbut let them not say they are poor because of England. The more money\r\nthey pay the sooner their father's or mother's soul is out of torment.\r\nOf course they spend all they have. I was speaking with a priest\r\nlately, and I said, 'Suppose I fell into Finn-water, and a man who saw\r\nme drowning said, \"I'll pull ye out for half-a-crown or a sovereign,\"\r\nwhat would ye think of him?' Says the priest, 'I'd think him a brute\r\nand a heathen.' 'But suppose, instead of Finn-water it was purgatory I\r\nwas in, and the priest said, \"I'll pull ye out for five pounds,\" what\r\nabout him?' 'Good morning to ye,' says the sogarth aroon (dear\r\npriest). There was no answer for me.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Stranorlar man said:--\"When the bill passed the second\r\nreading, there was not a hill round about, for many a mile, without a\r\nblazing tar-barrel on it, and the houses were lit up till ye'd think\r\nthe places were on fire. The people were rejoicing for they knew not\r\nwhat. Says one to me, 'Ye can pack up yer clothes,' says he. They\r\nthink they will now get rid of the English, and have things all their\r\nown way. That's their general idea. All their rejoicing passed off\r\nwithout a word of dissent from any Unionist. But if we rejoiced--!\r\nSuppose the bill were thrown out, and we lit a tar-barrel. We'd be\r\nstoned, and, if possible, swept off the very face of the earth. On St.\r\nPatrick's Day, March 17, they march over the place, flags flying,\r\ndrums beating, bands playing, and nobody says a word against it. But\r\nif we started an Orange procession on July 12 in Stranorlar, we'd be\r\nknocked into smithereens. And yet in the town we are about\r\nhalf-and-half. Of course, when you get out into the wild districts the\r\nRomanists greatly outnumber us. The plea of reduction of rent being\r\nrequired is very absurd when you come to examine the matter. Many of\r\nthem pay three or four pounds a year only. What reduction on that sum\r\nwould do them any real good?\"\r\n\r\nA land agent of Donegal showed me one page of a rent book, that I\r\nmight bear witness to indisputable facts. There were twenty-one\r\nannual rents on the page, and eleven of them were under two\r\npounds--most of them, in fact, were under thirty shillings. One man\r\nheld thirty-three acres for thirty-three shillings per annum. He had\r\npaid no rent for two years. Another estate in Donegal has two thousand\r\ntenants for a total rent of £2,800. The agent has to look after all\r\nthese \"farmers\"--to conciliate, threaten, soother, bully, beg, pray,\r\npromise, cajole, hunt, treat, fight, curse, and comether the whole two\r\nthousand a whole year for, and in consideration of, the princely sum\r\nof a hundred and forty pounds. Many of the farmers have the privilege\r\nof selling turf enough to clear the rent several times over, and of\r\ncourse every man can shoot at the agent as much as he chooses, his\r\nsport in this direction being only limited by his supply of\r\nammunition. Of late their powder has given out. Could not something be\r\ndone for these deserving men?\r\n\r\nA superior Home Ruler, one of those honest visionaries sometimes met\r\nin Ireland, said:--\"For my own part, I confess that I aspire to\r\ncomplete independence. Then, and not till then, would the two\r\ncountries be friendly. We in Ulster are ten times more patriotic than\r\nIrishmen elsewhere, for it is in Ulster that we have been most deeply\r\nwronged. The Hamiltons of Abercorn planted the country round here with\r\nScotch settlers, and various agencies between 1688 and 1715 are said\r\nto have brought over more than fifty thousand Scottish families to\r\nUlster, which was already populated to its utmost extent. The Irish\r\nwere dispossessed, kicked out, and they have been out ever since. The\r\nEarls of Tyrone and Tyrconnel took flight to save their heads, and six\r\ncounties were declared confiscated--Londonderry, Donegal, Tyrone,\r\nFermanagh, Cavan, and Armagh. These were all 'planted' with English\r\nand Scotch colonists. The land was given to certain favourites by the\r\nEnglish Government, which at that time was the stronger, and has\r\nremained so ever since When we ask for our own again you cry out\r\n'Robbery, robbery!' _We_ are the people to say 'Stop thief!' You say\r\nthe owners of the land rebelled, and their property was rightly\r\nconfiscated. We say they had a right to rebel, and that rebellion was\r\nan honourable action. You took the country at first by force and\r\nfraud. We have, and always had, a right to regain what belongs to us,\r\nby any means in our power. We have never expressed affection for the\r\nEnglish Crown. We have never affected loyalty. We have been open,\r\nhonourable enemies, and have always said we were biding our time. We\r\nare accused of fraud, of duplicity. Never was any accusation so\r\nill-founded. I can refer to a hundred, aye, to a thousand utterances\r\nof my countrymen which clearly set forth the sentiments which animate\r\nevery single individual Irishman. These settlers are not Irishmen.\r\nTheir best friends would never claim for them Irish nationality. Most\r\nof them came from the South-west of Scotland, where the most rigid and\r\nbigoted Presbyterianism flourished. Their creed, as well as ours,\r\nforbade any intermarrying. Separate they were, and separate they\r\nremain. You might as well try to mix dogs and cats. And the attitude\r\nof the two races is mutually antagonistic--exactly like dogs and\r\ncats. They have led a dog and cat life from the first, and if the\r\nScots have thriven while the Kelts have made little progress, it is\r\nbecause the Scots have been favoured by the English Government, which\r\nis composed of Teutons like themselves. Let the Scots stick to\r\nEngland. It suits them, it does not suit us. The Welsh don't like you\r\neither, but they have not the pluck to spit it out. They will tell\r\nIrishmen what they think, and it is not flattering to England. They\r\nare quite as bitter as Irishmen, and, like them, look on England as\r\nthe biggest humbug, hypocrite, and robber in the world. I never heard\r\na Welshman speak well of England, and I have spoken with scores of\r\nthem. Now, we have a religious difference with England, which Taffy\r\nhas not.\r\n\r\n\"We claim that our nation is more talented than stupid England, more\r\nsparkling, more brilliant. But we also say that as we are more\r\nsentimental, and as sentiment is to us a matter of life and death, we\r\ncannot develop our industries, we cannot do ourselves justice, while\r\nsubjugated by England. Freedom is our watchword. We want an army, a\r\nnavy, a diplomacy of our own. We do not admit that England has any\r\nright to control our action, and we defy any man to prove that any\r\ncountry has a right to dictate our laws. Independence must come in the\r\nlong run. Everything is tending in that direction. We may not get Home\r\nRule at present, but we _shall_ get it. Then we shall be able to\r\nreport progress. I believe that the material prosperity of this\r\ncountry will increase by leaps and bounds in exact proportion to the\r\nloosening of Saxon restraint, and freedom from selfish English\r\ninterference. Our trade has been deliberately strangled, our\r\nmanufactures deliberately ruined, by English influence on behalf of\r\nEnglish interests. Then you ask us to believe that we have benefited\r\nby our union with England! We do not believe it. England has been the\r\ngreatest modern curse, spreading her octopus arms over every weak\r\ncountry in the world. She goes to make money, and says she only wishes\r\nto push forward civilisation. Read Labouchere's opinion of England,\r\nand you will see what she is--a greedy, whining hypocrite. She holds\r\nIndia by fear, at the point of the bayonet--all for greed. Then her\r\nspeakers get up on their philanthropic platforms, and after shooting a\r\nfew thousand niggers and poisoning off the rest with rum, they say\r\nthat such and such a country is now under the blessed rule of England,\r\nwhich is established merely for the propagation of the truth as it is\r\nin Jesus. You make out that your rum, rifles, and missionaries are\r\nonly instruments in the hands of the Society for the Propagation of\r\nthe Gospel in Foreign Parts. Away with such hypocrisy! England is a\r\nbig bully, crushing the weak and truckling to the strong--truckling to\r\nthe weak, even, when fairly taken to. Look at the Transvaal. When I\r\nsee what a handful of Dutch farmers did with your grand army--when I\r\nsee how a country with less than a quarter of the population of\r\nIreland freed itself and knocked your bold army into a cocked hat, I\r\nam ashamed to be an Irishman submitting to foreign rule. You will at\r\nany rate see why we Irishmen in Ulster are even more rebellious than\r\nour southern countrymen. It is because these devilish plantations were\r\nin the North, and because we are outnumbered in the North by men who\r\nare really foreigners. Let them be loyal. No doubt it suits them best.\r\nBut we will only be loyal to our country, which is Ireland, not\r\nEngland. And if these Scots, wrongly called Ulstermen, don't like the\r\nnew arrangement, they can leave the country. No obstacle will be\r\nplaced in the way of their departure. That I can promise you. They\r\nwill leave the land, I suppose? That being so, we can spare the\r\nsettlers. And as they got the land for nothing, they must be content\r\nto part with it on the same terms. Now you understand the No Rent cry.\r\nNow you understand the No Landlord cry. The land was stolen from the\r\npeople, and the people carefully remember the fact. You hear\r\nNationalists speaking ill of the Irish members. The members have done\r\nwell for us. They have done grandly. Fourscore Irishmen have conquered\r\nthe British Empire, and without firing a shot. That after all beats\r\nthe record of the Boers, but they got complete independence. We are\r\nnot yet there; but it will come, it will come.\"\r\n\r\nAn equally intelligent Unionist, who bore a Scottish name,\r\nsaid:--\"Does it suit England to throw us overboard? Because that means\r\nthe giving up of the country. You can't hold Ireland without a friend\r\nin it. Twice the Protestant population have saved it for you. Its\r\ngeographical position forbids you to give it up. That would ruin you\r\nat once. And yet immediate separation would be far better than a\r\nwasting agitation. Better plunge over a precipice than be bled to\r\ndeath. Better blow out your brains than be roasted at a slow fire.\r\nEngland is being kicked to death by spiders. And all in the interests\r\nof Rome. If the people here had any opinions I would not say a word\r\nagainst anything they might do, but they have none at all. They show\r\ntheir teeth because they are told to do so. All the disturbances which\r\ndisgrace the country are excited by the priests, who pretend to\r\ndisapprove of them, but who secretly approve. For the priests have the\r\npeople thoroughly in hand, and whatever they really disapprove they\r\ncan stop in one moment.\r\n\r\n\"There is an organised clerical conspiracy to resist the law and to\r\nkeep the agitation on foot, with the object of obtaining a complete\r\nCatholic ascendency. They bleed the poor people to death with their\r\nexactions, and the number of new buildings they have lately erected in\r\nIreland almost exceeds belief. We have a splendid new Romanist Church\r\nin this little place. Well may the people say they can't pay rent.\r\nWhen Cardinal Logue's father died there was a collection for the\r\ngeneral Church which realised more than eight hundred pounds. When a\r\npriest dies or when a priest's relative dies there is always a\r\ncollection for the cause. Eight hundred pounds out of the starving\r\npeasantry of Donegal, for whose relief the English are always\r\ncollecting money! Cardinal Logue's father was Lord Leitrim's coachman,\r\nand was on the spot when my lord was shot. The horse fell lame at the\r\nright moment. Curious coincidence--very. This Home Rule farce is\r\ngrowing rather stale. Cannot the English see that it is urged by a set\r\nof thieves and traitors? Cannot they see that brains and property are\r\neverywhere against it? And Gladstone's speeches show such ignorance of\r\nthe subject that no Irishman can read or listen with common patience.\r\nTo judge from his Irish orations I should say that he is not fit to be\r\nPrime Minister to a Parliament of idiots. What do you think?\"\r\n\r\nI was sorry to dissent, but I said that to the best of my knowledge\r\nand belief Mr. Gladstone was of all men best fitted for such a post.\r\n\r\nStranorlar (Co. Donegal), July 27th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 54.--A SAMPLE OF IRISH \"LOYALTY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe country round here seems especially rich in minerals of all sorts.\r\nBog-ore, to be spoken of as bog ore, is abundant, and manganese is\r\nknown to exist in large quantities. Soapstone of excellent quality is\r\nalso plentiful, and the peasantry will tell you that on the passing of\r\nthe Home Rule Bill they will at once proceed to dig out the\r\ninexhaustible stores of gold, silver, lead, iron, tin, and coal, with\r\nwhich the district abounds. Ireland is a perfect El Dorado, and when\r\nthe brutal Saxon shall have taken his foot off her throat, when\r\nParlimint and the sojers allow the quarries to be worked, the mines to\r\nbe sunk, the diamonds under Belfast to be dug up, the country will\r\nonce more be prosperous, as in the owld ancient times, when the\r\nO'Briens and O'Connells cut each other's throats in peace, and harried\r\ntheir respective neighbourhoods without interference. Captain Ricky,\r\nof Mount Hall, is exploiting the bog-ore, and sending it to England by\r\nthousands of tons. The stuff is an oxide of iron and is used for\r\npurifying gas. The queerest feature of the use of bog-ore is the fact\r\nthat when used up it is worth twenty-five per cent. more than before.\r\nDelivered to the gas companies at thirty shillings a ton, it fetches\r\nforty shillings when the gas-men have done with it. It seems to be\r\ncomposed of peat which by a few millions of years of saturation in\r\nwater containing iron has become like iron-rust. The soapstone of\r\nKillygordon is used instead of fire-clay, and is also made into French\r\nchalk. Or rather it might be, but that the Captain declines to proceed\r\nwith its extraction pending the Home Rule scare. There is much alder\r\non the estate, which is watered by the river Finn. This is the right\r\nwood for the manufacture of clogs for the people of Lancashire and\r\nYorkshire. Captain Ricky sends tons of these interesting articles to\r\nthe sister isle. Men are turning out these favourite instruments of\r\nfeminine correction, in a rough state, by boat loads. When the\r\ncoster's done a-jumping on his mother, he should thank Ireland for\r\nhis clogs. When the festive miner rejoices, his dancing would lack the\r\ndistinguishing clatter which is its richest charm, without alder grown\r\non the banks of the Donegal Finn. The countries were made to run in\r\nharness. One is the complement of the other. The brainy dwellers of\r\nHibernia know this, and stick like limpets to England. Only the\r\nvisionary, the lazy, the ne'er-do weels, the incompetent, the\r\ndisorderly, the ignorant, the ambitious, want Home Rule. The\r\ncontemners of law and order want to flourish and grow fat. The Healys\r\nand Sextons and all of that ilk know that while under an Irish\r\nParliament their country would be ruined, yet that they themselves\r\nwould pick up something in the general confusion, while Dillon, like\r\nMrs. Gargery, could be ever on the rampage, carrying out his promises\r\nof dire revenge, and flourishing like a young bay tree. Nobody here\r\nrejoiced when the bill was reported amended. They are losing faith in\r\nits merits. Their simple faith received a severe shock after the\r\nreturn to power of the Three-acres-and-a-Cow Government. Then the\r\nLabourers' Dwellings Act proved a fraud. The peasantry asked the\r\nneighbouring landowners for an acre of ground and a new cottage. A\r\nneighbouring J.P. to-day told me that he had more than twenty\r\napplications from people who are now awaiting the gold mines, the\r\ngreat factories which the new Irish Government are about to open. If\r\nyou would remain poor, vote for the Unionist candidate. If you would\r\nbecome rich beyond the dreams of avarice, if you would occupy the\r\nplace of the Protestant landlords, if you would preserve your immortal\r\nsoul from eternal flames, vote as instructed by Father Gilhooly. A\r\npatriot priest yesterday said that the Day of Independence would be\r\nthe \"Day of Ireland.\" He should have called it the _Dies Iræ_.\r\n\r\nA Scottish Covenanter, not of the straitest sect, has no faith in the\r\nHome Rule Bill. He said:--\"The people up in the mountains, those who\r\nwant Home Rule, or rather those who have voted for it and expect to\r\nbenefit by it, are all of the class no Act of Parliament would ever\r\nhelp. They don't farm their land, and they don't want to farm it. Half\r\nof it lies to waste every year, and they cut turf which they get for\r\nnothing, and sell it in the small towns about for three or four\r\nshillings a load, instead of making the land produce all it will. Go\r\nto their houses at ten in the morning, and you will find them smoking\r\nover the fire. My people are up and at work by six o'clock every\r\nmorning in the week. The Scots farmers round Strabane are that keen on\r\ngetting on that you can't get them away from their work, which is\r\ntheir pleasure. They are so keen on making the most of the ground that\r\nthey are doing away with the hedges, and substituting barbed wire,\r\nmerely to gain the difference in area of ground to till. Look at yon\r\nbrae-face. Every yard tilled right up to the top. The Papist peasantry\r\nwould never do that. You want to know what's the reason? Goodness\r\nknows. All the Protestants round here have got on till they have\r\nfarms. There are no Protestant labourers. If English working men,\r\nagricultural fellows, would settle in Ireland, they would soon get\r\ntheir Three acres and a cow. The people who can and will do the best\r\nwith the land ought to have it, that's my theory. Ireland everywhere\r\nillustrates the principle of the survival of the fittest. The only way\r\nto succeed is by work. The Catholic Irish are so accustomed to leave\r\neverything to the priest that they have no self-reliance, and in\r\nworldly matters they always ask, who will help us? They are all\r\nbeggars by nature. The Duchess of Marlborough and other kind but\r\nmistaken ladies have pauperised some districts of Donegal. The people\r\nhave a natural indisposition to work, and a natural disposition to\r\nbeg. As for loyalty and tolerance, they have none of either. You never\r\nsaw industry without other virtues, you never saw laziness without\r\nother vices. These everlasting grumblers are a generation of vipers.\r\nThey are a peevish and perverse set of lazy, skulking swindlers. They\r\ncan pay. Every man could pay his rent and be comfortably off if he\r\nliked. The Protestant farmers pay and get along. And we agree that the\r\nlandlords favour the other sect. They know that we will do the right\r\nthing, and they let us do it, but the Papists may do less--for less\r\nthan the right thing is what the landlord expects from them. He thinks\r\nhimself lucky if his Papist tenants come anyway near the mark.\r\nTherefore I say, and any Protestant will say, the Papists are favoured\r\nby the landlords.\"\r\n\r\nA staunch Conservative, though not a land-owner, said:--\"We want\r\namendment of the Parliamentary voting regulations. No clergyman should\r\nbe allowed to sit in the Revision Court. Scandals without end could be\r\ncited to show the necessity of this. I would, of course, exclude all\r\nsects, though no Protestant preacher ever takes part directly or\r\nindirectly in any of our political meetings. When a man has to make\r\noath as to the validity of his claim to the suffrage he will often\r\nlook at the priest who sits watching him. He gets a nod, and he goes\r\non with his swearing. The perjury of the Irish Revision Courts is\r\nsomething fearful, and no one pays any attention to it. The Papists\r\nswear just anything. They get absolved, but a Protestant has not this\r\ngreat advantage and that holds him back. That is the Papist\r\nexplanation. In my presence the Home Rule inspector of this\r\ndistrict--we call the people who watch and work the registers the\r\ninspectors--swore that James Kelly, of Cross Roads, Killygordon, was\r\nthe present tenant, the holder of the license, and the freeholder of a\r\npublic-house at the spot mentioned. Besides this he swore that the\r\nname James Kelly was on the signboard. He therefore proposed to poll a\r\nJames Kelly. Now the person in question went to America in 1888, and\r\nnever returned. His name was not on the signboard, and the license was\r\nfor another person. The Judge declined to hear any further evidence\r\nfrom Inspector Francis McLaughlin. That was the only penalty enforced.\r\nSuch things happen every day in Irish Revision Courts.\r\n\r\n\"A man named James Burns put in a claim for a vote on behalf of land\r\nheld at Stroangebbah. He had none there. What he had was at\r\nAughkeely, and this was not sufficient to entitle him to vote. Yes,\r\nhis name should be spelt Byrnes, but the Irish often prefer the\r\nProtestant form of the name. Well, nobody believed that he was the\r\ntenant of Stroangebbah; he was said to be a lodger only. The Judge\r\nasked him for proof. He presented a paper purporting to be a receipt\r\nfor rent for Stroangebbah, but in reality the receipt was for the\r\nground at Aughkeely, which did not qualify. He curled up the paper so\r\nas to show that his name was on it, and the Judge instantly passed his\r\nclaim, and placed him on the roll. A young fellow named Robert Ewing\r\nat once exposed the trick, but the Judge declared that having placed\r\nBurns on the roll, he must remain there until next revision. Judge\r\nKeogh was his name. Yes, you would think an Irishman and a good\r\nCatholic would have seen through such a trumpery trick.\r\n\r\n\"When an illiterate declares for whom he will vote, we sometimes have\r\nfrom twenty to thirty outsiders in the polling-booth. In England the\r\nCourt is cleared, and even the policeman has to go outside. But in\r\nthis favoured country any blackguard who likes to fill up a\r\ndeclaration of secrecy, and go before a magistrate, can be present at\r\nthe whole of the proceedings. There is no secrecy for the illiterates.\r\nAny corner-boy, any ruffian, any blackguard in the district can come\r\nin and hear for whom men vote. These corner boys all get declarations\r\nin their fists, and they march in gangs from one booth to another.\r\nIt's intimidation, no less. Get some M.P. to mention this as having\r\ntaken place at Stranorlar. The people of whom I complain were not even\r\nvoters. Anybody could be present. Ridiculous to talk of the ballot-box\r\nin Ireland.\r\n\r\n\"The Morley magistrates are in many cases a disgrace to the country.\r\nWe used to have an idea in these parts that a small publican could not\r\nlegally sit on the Bench. James McGlinchy, J.P., is a small publican\r\nof Brockagh. Barring his trade, he's not so bad, as he can read and\r\nwrite. But if you saw the lists, and if you knew the men\r\nrecommended----! Englishmen have no idea what low scoundrels have been\r\nplaced on the Bench in this country. Imperfect education we do not so\r\nmuch mind when conjoined with character. O'Donnell is not a bad sort,\r\nbut he couldn't write 'adjourned.' Two magistrates were needed, and\r\nnobody else arrived. Therefore the difficult word was necessary, and\r\nO'Donnell felt it was beyond him. He called up a policeman, and\r\nordered him to do it. Whereat the county makes merry. There should be\r\nan education test. Can all the English magistrates spell 'adjourned'?\r\nYou think so? That's very good. Not right that a man who can't spell\r\n'adjourned' should give another man a spell of imprisonment.\"\r\n\r\nA Roman Catholic gentleman thus summed up the character of his\r\nparticular neighbourhood:--\"The upper classes of both sects are in\r\nevery way equal. Among the lower classes I observe that the\r\nProtestants do as much work as they can, while the Papists do as\r\nlittle as they can. This accounts for the difference in their\r\nappearance and position. Then the Protestants are far better educated,\r\nand have arrived at the knowledge that everything that is good must be\r\ngained by exertion, and that there is for them at least no substitute.\r\nThe others talk as if after the establishment of an Irish Parliament\r\nmoney would be found growing on the bushes. No one need try to change\r\ntheir opinion. When the time comes to vote they will vote as their\r\npriest tells them. Someone has said that the British Government might\r\nsubsidise the Church, and so buy her off. It could not be done. The\r\nbishops want power. I do not agree with them, and I do not support or\r\nadmit their claim to direct their flocks in political matters.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquess of Conyngham, whom I met at Strabane, said:--\"The people\r\nof Donegal are pleasant, kind, and civil. Taking them all round, they\r\nare much more energetic than the Southerners, and we were making fair\r\nprogress until these Home Rule Bills were brought in. The country was\r\nbeing opened up, and things were beginning to improve, when the bill\r\ncame and blighted everything. Now the people are growing idle and\r\ndiscontented. They are all right when left alone. Everybody likes the\r\nDonegal peasants, and they deserve to be liked. Only leave them alone;\r\nthat's what they want; and not Home Rule nor any other quackery.\"\r\n\r\nStrange things continue to happen in Ireland. This does not refer to\r\nthe continuous cutting-off of cows' tails, the slitting of horses'\r\ntongues, and other similar expressions of impatience for the good time\r\ncoming, but to some strange things that have happened in connection\r\nwith agricultural affairs. Sir Samuel Hayes decided to abandon a farm\r\nwhich would not pay, although he had no rent to meet. He was his own\r\nlandlord, but he did not work the farm. That was done by a bailiff,\r\nwho, curiously enough, was the highest bidder for the land. He of all\r\nmen should have known that if the farm would not pay expenses when\r\nthere was no rent, it would not reward the man who had rent to pay.\r\nThis reasoning proved fallacious. The farm which without rent proved a\r\nloss, in the same hands turned out when rent was charged a perfect\r\ngold-mine. In another case, a bailiff on leaving his employ expended\r\non land the accumulated savings of his thrifty years, and--strange to\r\nsay--his savings amounted to about three times the sum of his wages\r\nduring his life's service. A man who, having a pound a week, can save\r\nthree pounds, would in England be regarded as a prodigy. In Ireland\r\nsuch things happen every day. Particulars as to the cases\r\nhereinbefore-mentioned can be obtained from anybody in Killygordon,\r\nwhich is altogether a remarkable place--to say nothing of its name,\r\nwhich for obvious reasons has the misfortune to be unpleasant to the\r\nGrand Old Man. _Nomen, Omen?_\r\n\r\nAn octogenarian J.P. said:--\"They talk of gold and silver mines, and\r\nlead and copper mines, and iron and quicksilver mines, but mining in\r\nIreland cannot, as a rule, be made to pay. Everything exists in\r\nIreland, but in such small quantities. The seams and veins are so\r\nsmall. Mr. Ritchie, of Belfast, spent several fortunes in mining for\r\ncoal, iron, and other things. There was iron at Ballyshannon, but what\r\nwas the good? It cost less to bring iron to England from Algiers. We\r\nhad no railway to Donegal, fifteen miles away, and cartage was too\r\nexpensive. So far from Home Rule doing us any good, it would be a\r\ncruel blow to the country, and especially to the poor. Employment\r\nwould become very scarce, as everybody who had money invested in\r\nIreland would be in haste to realise and get it away. There would be\r\nno new enterprises, although the poor folk say, \"We'll get employment\r\nin big factories and mines.\" Where's the money to come from? From the\r\nIrish Parliament, they say. And where will they get it from? Oh, a\r\nParliament always has money. All the money comes from Parliament,\r\nwhich, in fact, actually makes money. The English Parliament makes all\r\nthe goold sovereigns, and when the Irish Parliament commences to\r\nmanufacture goold sovereigns at Dublin, then Ireland must be rich. Did\r\nnot Mr. Gladstone say there would be too much money? Did not he say\r\nthat in Parliament? That's what the poorest and most ignorant people\r\nof Donegal say. The English Home Rulers, by their support of the\r\nmovement are inflicting injury on the Irish poor. We want the country\r\nopening up with railways. The tourist district is unequalled in\r\nEurope. Good hotels now, but you reach them mostly by cars. Balfour\r\nwas giving us rails. That one man in five years did more good to\r\nIreland than all other agencies operating for the previous forty\r\nyears. I have thought the thing out, and I can speak for that period\r\nwith certainty. Why could not they let him alone? The blackguards of\r\nthese parts still shout 'Hell to Balfour.'\r\n\r\n\"Home Rule means to England a weakening, a loss of prestige, a new and\r\na terrible danger. The _Independent_ says, 'When Ireland next fights\r\nEngland she will not fight alone?' Very true. There is a strong\r\nanti-English feeling among the lower American classes, who are largely\r\nIrish, who have votes, and by their votes can influence American\r\npolicy. Let me point out the opinion of Lieutenant-Colonel Butler as\r\nrecorded in 'The Great Lone Land.' Here it is:--\r\n\r\n\"You will be told that the hostility of the inhabitants of the United\r\nStates is confined to one class, and that class, though numerically\r\nlarge, is politically insignificant. Do not believe it for one\r\ninstant; the hostility to England is universal, it is more deep-rooted\r\nthan any other feeling, it is an instinct and not a reason, and\r\nconsequently possesses the dogged strength of unreasoning antipathy. I\r\ntell you, Mr. Bull, that were you pitted to-morrow against a race that\r\nhad not one idea in kindred with your own, were you fighting a deadly\r\nstruggle against a despotism the most galling on earth, were you\r\nengaged with an enemy whose grip was around your neck and whose foot\r\nwas on your chest, that English-speaking cousin of yours over the\r\nAtlantic, whose language is your language, whose literature is your\r\nliterature, whose civil code is begotten from your digests of law,\r\nwould stir no hand, no foot, to save you, would gloat over your\r\nagony, would keep the ring while you were being knocked out of all\r\nsemblance of motion and power, and would not be very far distant when\r\nthe moment came to hold a feast of eagles over your vast, disjointed\r\nlimbs. Make no mistake about it, and be not blinded by ties of kindred\r\nor belief.\" And, further, \"You will find them the firm friend of the\r\nRussian, because that Russian is likely to become your enemy in Herat,\r\nin Cabul, in Kashgar, in Constantinople. Nay, even should any\r\nwoman-killing Sepoy put you to sore strait by indiscriminate and\r\nruthless slaughter, he will be your cousin's friend for the simple\r\nreason that he is your enemy.\" Without accepting the gallant Colonel's\r\ndictum, it is as well to bear it in mind.\r\n\r\nA pensive youth in Ballybofey was deeply engaged with a scrap of\r\nballad literature, not by any means without literary merit. For and in\r\nconsideration of a Saxon sixpence I became the proprietor of the lay,\r\nwhich is being circulated by thousands throughout Ireland. Those who\r\nuphold the reputation of their Irish allies for loyalty to the Queen,\r\nand friendship to the English nation, will, doubtless, find their\r\nconvictions deepened and strengthened by the following sample verses\r\naddressed to intending recruits:--\r\n\r\n    Ye whose spirits will not bow\r\n      In peace to parish tyrants longer,\r\n    Ye who wear the villain brow,\r\n      And ye who pine in hopeless hunger,\r\n    Fools, without the brave man's faith,\r\n      All slaves and starvelings who are willing\r\n    To sell yourselves to shame and death,\r\n      Accept the fatal Saxon shilling.\r\n    Ere you from your mountains go\r\n      To feel the scourge of foreign fever,\r\n    Swear to serve the faithless foe\r\n      Who lures you from your land for ever,\r\n    Swear henceforth its tools to be\r\n      To slaughter trained by ceaseless drilling,\r\n    Honour, home, and liberty\r\n      Abandoned for a Saxon shilling.\r\n    Go--to find 'mid crime and toil\r\n      The doom to which such guilt is hurried,\r\n    Go--to leave on Indian soil\r\n      Your bones to bleach, accursed, unburied,\r\n    Go--to crush the just and brave\r\n      Whose wrongs with wrath the world are filling,\r\n    Go--to slay each brother slave,\r\n      Or spurn the blood-stained Saxon Shilling.\r\n    Irish hearts! why should you bleed,\r\n      To swell the tide of English glory?\r\n    Aiding despots in their need,\r\n      Who've changed our green so oft to gory?\r\n    None save those who wish to see\r\n      The noblest killed, the meanest killing,\r\n    And true hearts severed from the free,\r\n      Will take again the Saxon Shilling.\r\n\r\nThe British soldier is the meanest killing the noblest. The poet's\r\nname is Buggy. All this is very surprising. Painted by Paddy Mr. John\r\nBull, J.P., will hardly recognise himself. Throughout the Nationalist\r\nliterature he is represented as a liar, a coward, a bully, a\r\nhypocrite, a tyrant, and a robber. If he now consented to be made the\r\ninstrument of persons whose ascertained opinions exactly harmonise\r\nwith those enunciated above, the epithets of Fool and Idiot will\r\ndoubtless be added to the list. And in this instance the evil speakers\r\nwould be quite right. _Quod demonstrandum est._\r\n\r\nKillygordon, July 29th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 55.--A TRULY PATRIOTIC PRIEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rhythmical rocking of the little engine of the West Donegal line\r\nrunning across from Killygordon seemed to say ceaselessly--\r\n\r\n    Here's a health to ye, Father O'Flynn,\r\n    Slainthe (health), and slainthe, and slainthe agin--\r\n    Powerfullest pracher, an' tinderest tacher,\r\n    An' kindliest crature in ould Donegal!\r\n\r\nFather O'Flynn must have been like a priest I met on Sunday, a\r\nLoyalist and a Conservative. Priests of the old school are becoming\r\nscarcer and scarcer every year, but one or two still exist. They do\r\nnot \"get on.\" It is understood that their political attitude forbids\r\npromotion. A priest who confesses to a respect for the Queen is not\r\nlikely to be acceptable to the multitude. A priest who believes that\r\nthe British laws are just and equitable, and that things would be\r\nbetter remaining as they are, is looked upon as a _lusus naturæ_. He\r\nsaid:--\"I am a South of Ireland man, and was educated at Douai. I have\r\nno sympathy with the great bulk of the Maynooth men, who are mostly\r\npeasants and the sons of peasants. I do not think that the Maynooth\r\ncourse is sufficient in one generation to lift the sons to any great\r\nintellectual height above the besotted ignorance of the parents. I\r\nbelieve in heredity, and I say that most of my colleagues are only\r\nshaved labourers, stall-fed for three years. The low-bred men are now\r\nthe dominant power. Instead of tranquillising the people, which I hold\r\nto be the duty of the clergy, they have done all they could to awaken\r\nand keep alive their most dangerous passions. And to rouse the Irish,\r\nespecially the Southern Irish, is a matter of the greatest facility. I\r\nhold that the clergy by degenerating into mere political agents are\r\nstrangely short-sighted. Their spiritual influence will in time be\r\ndangerously undermined, and in the long run they will take nothing by\r\ntheir motion. The Parnellite party will grow stronger and stronger,\r\nand the extreme party, the party of Revolution, which now lacks a\r\nleader, would on the passing of a Home Rule bill become the dominant\r\npower. That is a great and salient factor of which up to the present\r\nEnglish politicians have taken no account. The party of Revolution is\r\nthe party which under an Irish Parliament would be master of the\r\nsituation. Leaders will not be lacking. But at present the party must\r\nfrom the necessity of the case be amorphous, and therefore,\r\npolitically and as a power, practically non-existent. Pass the bill,\r\nand then you will see something. A new party, the party of\r\nIndependence, or, as they will call it, of Freedom, will take shape\r\nand formidably influence events. The temptation to take the lead will\r\nbe great. Independence and Separation will be a most popular cry. The\r\npresent men must either join the swim or be denounced as traitors, and\r\nas Healy cannot now visit Dundalk without two hundred policemen to\r\nprotect him, while William O'Brien was nearly torn to pieces at\r\nCork--would, in fact, have been murdered but for the police--you may\r\nconceive what would be the state of things when we have a\r\nRevolutionary party and when the police were no longer under the fair\r\nand judicial control of the British Government. Pass the bill and look\r\nout for the Revolutionary party. They will have an immense backing in\r\npoint of numbers. And numbers rule in Ireland, not intelligence. The\r\nbill will, of course, give nothing that the peasants expect. The fault\r\nwill assuredly lie with John Bull. The expectations of the ignorant,\r\nthat is, the great mass of the people, will be woefully disappointed.\r\nWho is to blame? they will ask. Numbers of politicians are waiting to\r\ntell them. Who but the brutal, greedy, selfish, perfidious Saxon? An\r\nagitation will succeed, compared with which the worst times of the\r\nLand League were preferable. I shudder to think of the chaos, the\r\nseething and weltering confusion of the time to come. The Irish\r\npeople, the poor ignorants, will suffer most. And yet they are\r\ninnocent in this matter. They have, indeed, been blamed with the\r\nexcesses of a few of their number, but they are, if left to\r\nthemselves, a most kindly and law-abiding people. The Donegal peasants\r\nare the best in the country. You will see poverty, but the degradation\r\nof filthiness and laziness is not nearly so marked as in the South and\r\nWest, where the climate is warm, moist, enervating.\r\n\r\n\"What, then, are my opinions, expressed in a concise form? I will tell\r\nyou. They are what _you_ would call sound. They are the opinions of\r\nBalfour, of Lord Salisbury. I hold Mr. Balfour in profound esteem as a\r\nwise and sagacious administrator, a terror to evil-doers, and an\r\nencourager of those who do well. I have a real affection for Mr.\r\nBalfour, as for a great benefactor of my beloved country. For I love\r\nmy country so well that I feel the keenest personal interest in her\r\nwelfare. Perhaps I have a deeper affection for Ireland than even Tim\r\nHealy or Sexton or Harcourt or O'Brien. What do I think of Gladstone?\r\nI think him a scourge of Ireland, a curse, a destroyer far worse than\r\nOliver Cromwell. A heaven-born statesman? Do his followers call him\r\nthat? Well, I can only say that I hope and trust that heaven will not\r\nbe blessed with any further family.\"\r\n\r\nA military officer resident in this region, an Irishman bred and\r\nborn, said, \"It's all a matter of religion. I was the other day\r\nreading Maxwell's account of the Irish rebellion of 1798, and I\r\nobserved that although the Northern rebellion, which was the most\r\ndangerous, as being the best organised, was mainly led by Protestants,\r\nyet in other parts of Ireland, when a suspected person was captured by\r\nthe rebels, the first question was, not are you in favour of the Irish\r\nRepublic, but what is your religion? And the Protestants generally had\r\ntheir throats cut. The same thing would occur again, under similar\r\ncircumstances. Religion would be the test. If a general state of\r\nlawlessness should at any time arise, the Protestants in lonely\r\ndistricts would not be safe from murder. Yes, I _do_ say it, and I\r\nstick to it. A very large number of outrages have been committed which\r\nwould not have taken place but for the religion of the offending\r\nparty. It is a virtue to lie to a heretic, to cheat him, to damage\r\nhim, to keep him out of heaven if possible. Anybody who knows Catholic\r\nIreland would agree with this most heartily. They believe that\r\nwhosoever killeth heretics doeth God service.\r\n\r\n\"Irish folks are better than the people of other nations, and also\r\nmuch worse. When they are good they are very good, and when they are\r\nbad they are very bad. They run to extremes in a way which cool-headed\r\nBritons do not understand. They are impulsive, and they jump to\r\nconclusions. Their great disadvantage is a crushing clerical\r\ninfluence. What's the use of thinking about anything when Father Pat\r\ndoes it for them? What's the use of listening to argument when you\r\nmust in the end vote as Father Pat orders?\r\n\r\n\"Englishmen have no idea what a splendid fellow the Irish peasant\r\nreally is when his mind is not poisoned and his unfortunate ignorance\r\nexploited. I could give you instances of fidelity, affectionate\r\nself-sacrifice and devotion which would astonish you. Not isolated or\r\nsporadic cases, but arising from the average level of the Irish\r\ncharacter. After considerable travel, and a painstaking study of the\r\ncharacteristics of various nations, I have come to the conclusion\r\nthat, taking one consideration with another, I prefer Paddy, ignorant\r\nas he is. For after all his ignorance is not his own fault. He sees no\r\nnewspapers except an occasional local sheet, which is almost certain\r\nto be a wretched, lying, priest-inspired rag. If he were seen looking\r\nat any other it would be bad for him. But newspapers are practically\r\nunknown in the agricultural districts. And men do not meet in crowds\r\nas in England. They have not the attrition which wears away the\r\nangularities. They live solitary among the mountains, or away in the\r\nfields, and they never hear lectures, have no Institutes, get no\r\nchance of improvement. The priest is their Clan Chieftain, their\r\nspiritual adviser, their temporal adviser, their newspaper, their only\r\nchannel of superior information.\" At this point a tall, red-bearded\r\nman who was passing touched his hat to the Colonel, who said, \"My\r\ngamekeeper. A fine, rough-coated Scotsman. Came over here a mad\r\nGladstonian. Pinned his faith to the G.O.M. Followed him blindly, and\r\nowned he was content to do it. Get into conversation with him. Observe\r\nthe change, the decided change in his opinions.\"\r\n\r\nSoon I had Velveteens in full cry. His opinions were indeed decided.\r\nHaving admitted that they had boxed the compass during a six months'\r\nresidence in this down-trodden country, he went on to say, \"The only\r\nway ye could cure the discontent is to make no attempt at it. Then the\r\nagitation would stop. The people are the biggest fules I ever saw.\r\nInstead of returning a sound, advanced Radical like Emerson T.\r\nHerdman, a man who pays them thirty or forty thousand a year, and who\r\nspends all his money in their midst, the fules go and vote for a thing\r\nlike Arthur O'Connor, who never was here but once, and who never did\r\nthem the compliment of issuing an address. When Mr. Herdman came to\r\nStranorlar the people stoned him and his friends. And yet nobody ever\r\nsaid, or could say, a word against the Herdmans, who are among the\r\nmost popular people in Ireland, and who deserve the best that can be\r\nsaid of them. O'Connor costs these poor folks two hundred pounds a\r\nyear. They raise it in the constituency. Mr. Herdman would have cost\r\nthem nothing, and might have spent even more than he does at present.\r\nHe has opened up the greatest industry in the North-west of Ireland,\r\nkeeps a whole country-side going, and is an out-and-out Liberal. The\r\ngreatest exertions were made to secure his return, and the Catholics\r\npromised to vote for him. He stumped the country, and left no stone\r\nunturned. The Nationalist candidate never came here till the last\r\nmoment, and, as I said, issued no address. The people knew nothing of\r\nhim, and had never heard of him. But they voted as the priests told\r\nthem, and they would have voted for a stick. Ought such people to have\r\nthe franchise?\r\n\r\n\"What would I do to settle the Irish question? I've heard that\r\nsomebody proposed sinking the country for twenty-four hours. That\r\nmight do. Or you could withdraw the police and military, and in every\r\nmarket town open a depôt for the gratuitous distribution of arms and\r\nammunition. In ten days there would only be a very small population,\r\nand you could then plant the country with people who would make the\r\nbest of it, and mind their work, instead of spending their time\r\nstanding about waiting for Home Rule to make them rich without work.\r\nOr you could make a law which required every priest in the country to\r\nclear out in twenty-four hours, on penalty of death. That is as\r\nimpossible as sinking the island, but it would be quite as sure a\r\ncure. Those are my opinions, and those must be the opinions of every\r\nman who has lived here and looked about him for a reasonable length of\r\ntime. The Scots Gladstonians are very decent folk. They mean well, and\r\nthey are friendly to Ireland. Their only fault lies in following their\r\nhero, and in thinking that he cannot do wrong. If they knew what I\r\nknow, they would be of my mind. For I was as great a Gladstonian as\r\nany of them.\"\r\n\r\nA Presbyterian farmer said:--\"On this estate the whole of the tenants\r\nare Presbyterians. The agent told me that early in June the whole of\r\nthe rents up to May were paid, and that he would think that there was\r\nnot such another case in Ireland. How is that? Well, if the tenants\r\nhad been Romanists they would have so many things to pay. The priests\r\nlive like fighting cocks. Father McFadden, of Gweedore, makes from a\r\nthousand to fifteen hundred a year. That is the man on whose door-step\r\nInspector Martin was murdered. The crowd beat out his brains with\r\npalings, and when he tried to get into the priest's house, the door\r\nwas shut in his face. The clergy live well, and drink like troopers.\r\nThe easiest job in Ireland, and--if your conscience would allow\r\nit--the best in every way. You are treated with great respect, you\r\nhave great influence, you have nothing to do, and you are extremely\r\nwell paid for it. Sometimes I think that humbug pays better than hard\r\nwork. The priests do _not_ look after the poor. They do _not_ work\r\namong the destitute and ignorant after the fashion of the English\r\nclergy. They are always extracting, extracting, extracting. The poor\r\nare ground down by their exactions till they can't pay their rent. And\r\nthat is why the agent said that probably no other estate in Ireland\r\ncould show such a record as ours.\r\n\r\n\"Home Rule will not satisfy the people. An Irish Parliament will do\r\nthem no good, no, nor fifty Irish Parliaments. They are unfriendly to\r\nEngland because she is Protestant. People of the only true faith\r\ncannot bear to be governed by a heretic nation. The laws are all\r\nright, and they know it, but their animosity is excited by stories of\r\nwrong-doing in their forefathers' days, and while on the one hand they\r\nfeel that they might easily be better off, on the other they are told\r\nthat the brutal Saxon keeps them poor. All this is done by the\r\npriests. They actually admit that the English laws are excellent, but\r\nthen they fall back on the allegation that their administration is\r\ncorrupt. In vain you point to the Roman Catholic judges. In vain you\r\ngo over England's successive attempts to pacify Ireland by\r\nconciliatory measures. The priest ruins all, for while your friend\r\nseems to agree with you--they are so easily led--yet the priest will\r\nsecure his vote to a certainty. So long as a heretic power is at the\r\nhead, so long Ireland will be discontented. If the country were under\r\nthe rule of a Roman Catholic power, the people of Ireland would be\r\nsatisfied with any laws whatever. They would not grumble at anything.\r\nThe only alternative is the spread of education, and that goes on very\r\nslowly in Ireland. We are very, very backward in Donegal, but not\r\nnearly so bad as in the south and west. We have a bad name for poverty\r\nand ignorance, but we do not deserve it in the same degree as the\r\nMunster and Connaught folks. We dislike the Connaught people just as\r\nmuch as you do in England. We hate dirt, and lawlessness and disorder,\r\nand therefore we claim to be superior to the rest of the poor\r\ncounties. This is, of course, the civilised part of Donegal. But\r\nwherever you go, you see nothing like the dirt of counties Galway and\r\nMayo.\r\n\r\n\"We want railways to open up the country. Balfour was building them\r\nfor us, and his institution of the Congested Districts Board did\r\nwonderful things for us. Why, if he had done nothing but improve the\r\nbreed of fowls he would still have been worthy of remembrance as a\r\nbenefactor of this country. Before the Congested Board Committee\r\nintroduced superior breeds of fowls, the chickens were like\r\nblackbirds. You could sit down and eat half-a-dozen of them. They were\r\nno bigger than your thumb. But now we can get fowls equal to anything\r\nyou have in England. The same may be said of the horses, the pigs, the\r\ncows, and all kinds of domestic animals and poultry. The fishing\r\nindustry has saved whole districts from starvation, and has done good\r\nall round. When we get an Irish Parliament the grants for all these\r\npurposes will be discontinued, and the tide of progress will be\r\nchecked. The poor folks are quite unable to see that by sticking to\r\nEngland we have a wealthy neighbour to borrow from, and that this is\r\nan inestimable advantage to a poor country like Ireland. Not long ago\r\nI mentioned this to a priest, but he said, 'When we have a Parliament\r\nof our own we'll not need to borrow money, for we'll have more than we\r\nknow what to do with. Did not Mr. Gladstone say we should have a\r\nchronic plethora of money? John Bull certainly sends some money over\r\nhere, but he had it from here to begin with. He stole it from Ireland,\r\nand he is only like a thief whose conscience urges him to restore a\r\nportion, a very small portion, of the stolen goods. When we get\r\nIndependence--he used the word Independence--we shall be in a position\r\nto lend money instead of needing to borrow!' The person who said all\r\nthis is the most influential politician of this district. His word to\r\nhis flock is law. Not one of them dare for his life vote otherwise\r\nthan as he tells them. They do not think this a hardship. They have no\r\npolitical convictions, and would just as soon vote any one way as any\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nA Donegal Home Ruler said that the poor folks were quite right in\r\nfollowing the priests, and wanted to know if they would be right in\r\nfollowing the Tories. He said:--\"They are no more ignorant than the\r\nBritish working men, and not less independent. Don't the working\r\nclasses follow their leaders, voting in heaps, just as they are told,\r\nwithout any notion of the Empire's greatness, and entirely with a view\r\nto their own interests? Could anybody be more stupid, more totally\r\nincapable of giving a valid reason for his action than your vaunted\r\nBritish workman? Why, if the specimens we get over here are any guide,\r\nif the samples are anything like the bulk, you might as well poll a\r\nflock of sheep as a crowd of British working men. I say the Irish\r\npeasantry are superior in intellect, conduct, and chayracther, and\r\nthat in following the priest they are acting as reasonable as your\r\nBritish working-man, who follows his strike leaders and trade\r\nagitators, and is perpetually cutting off his nose to spite his face.\r\nNo, we shall not get Home Rule now, but we must have it later on. Then\r\nwe shall demand more. Every time we have to ask we shall want more\r\nand more. We shall wring it from England, and we shall make her pay\r\nfor the trouble she gives. She must be charged a sort of war\r\nindemnity.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dundalk press is on my track. I heard of this in Newry, but the\r\nDundalk papers do not reach the next town to Dundalk, and not a sheet\r\ncould be had for love or money. A friend having told me that the\r\n_Gazette_ was reviled, great efforts were made to obtain the reviling\r\nprint, but in vain. At last I saw the _Dundalk Democrat_, which in a\r\ntwo-column comment on its colleague's maledictions of your humble\r\ncommissioner cleared me of the charges brought by the original\r\nthunderer, which I have not yet been able to see. One of the said\r\ncharges is based on the statement that I asked to be allowed to be\r\npresent at the meeting, which permission was readily accorded. The\r\nmeeting was public and was placarded from one end of Dundalk to the\r\nother. The public were invited to assemble in their thousands, and to\r\njoin in the onward march to freedom. Not more than twenty people\r\nanswered to the call, and the meeting was therefore a dead failure.\r\nThe idea of asking leave to be present at a public meeting is absurd.\r\nThe vituperative print says that I was _not_ asked to deliver an\r\naddress, but was told that I could \"do so if I liked.\" The truth is\r\nmanifest by the admitted fact that I declined, as being no speaker.\r\nSuch is the minute hair-splitting of Irish argumentation. The quips\r\nand cranks of Tipperary Humphreys will be remembered, the paltry\r\nquibbles by which he sought to establish a case, and his final retreat\r\nunder cover of the statement that he could not have believed that\r\n\"such a state of things was possible.\" The Dundalk marchers to freedom\r\n(to the number of twenty) were not precisely the pick of the local\r\nrespectability, and my escape must be regarded as providential. As to\r\ntheir outpourings of abuse, my philosophy resembles that of the old\r\nwhipper-in of the Meynell-Ingram Hounds:--\"I bain't a cruel chap, I\r\nbain't. But when I puts the lash among the hounds I _dew_ like to hear\r\n'em yowl; I _dew_ like to see 'em skip, and writhe, and look mad. For\r\nif ye don't make 'em feel, and if ye can't hear 'em yowl, there's\r\nrailly no pleasure in thrashin' of 'em.\"\r\n\r\nDonegal, August 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 56.--DO-NOTHING DONEGAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDonegal improves on acquaintance. At first dull, dreary, and\r\ndisappointing, a more extended examination reveals much that is\r\ninteresting. The river Eske runs through the town, rippling over a\r\nrocky bed of limestone like the Dee at Llangollen. Mountains arise on\r\nevery hand, some in the foreground, green and pleasant, backed by\r\nsterile ranges having serrated summits, dark and frowning. The harbour\r\nhas an old-world look, with its quaint fishing boats and groves of\r\ntrees running down to the water's edge. The land is decidedly humpy,\r\nand the sea meanders among the meadows in long fillets like trout\r\nbrooks, sometimes tapering off to narrow ditches over which you can\r\neasily step at highest tide. The land is fertile, mostly grazing, and\r\nthe cattle are of large and superior breed. The country is well\r\nwooded, and the hedgerows are tall and well-kept. The ancient abbey,\r\nlike Mr. Gladstone's reputation, is in ruins. There is a ruined castle\r\non the river bank, and on the other side, exactly opposite, a\r\nMethodist church, bearing the legend, ALL ARE WELCOME. The principal\r\n\"square\" is triangular, and has some good shops, which do most of\r\ntheir business on market-days. An enormous anchor, half embedded in\r\nthe mud of the harbour, was left there by the French fleet during \"the\r\nthroubles of the ruction.\" It is rather in the way, but three\r\ngenerations of Irishmen have not found time to remove it. \"Like\r\nourselves and our counthry it will stick in the mud until the end of\r\ntime,\" said a native. There is much lounging at corners by men who are\r\nprobably waiting for the Home Rule Bill, but the people compare\r\nfavourably with those of the South and West. They have more grit, more\r\nindustry, more perseverance. They are simple, civil, and obliging.\r\nThey are also cleaner and more tidy than the Southerners, though\r\ndecidedly poorer. \"They get no price for their produce, no reasonable\r\nwages for their industry. Their patience and contentment are\r\nsurprising, considering their circumstances. You can get work done for\r\ntwopence a day. The Southerners get thrice the money for their farm\r\nproduce. We have no ready means of getting things on the market. I\r\nhave thirty tons of hay to sell, and nobody in the district would give\r\nme a pound for it.\" Thus spake one of the leading citizens, a Roman\r\nCatholic, dead against Home Rule. \"The resident gentry are all we have\r\nto depend upon. Once plant a Parliament in Dublin, and there will be a\r\ngeneral exodus of the moneyed classes. Then the poor folks will have\r\nnobody to look to, and they must follow them to England--which will\r\ncertainly be overrun with destitute Irish. Things have grown worse and\r\nworse during the last ten years. Under a steady Government the country\r\nwould gradually improve until the comfort of the people would give the\r\nagitators nothing to work upon. But with change upon change, with one\r\nfinal settlement upon another final settlement, we don't know where we\r\nare, nor what is going to happen next. How can we settle down to work?\r\nHow can we launch out into industrial enterprises? Every man who has\r\nanything holds his hand for fear of loss. An Irish Parliament would be\r\na Parliament of confiscation, and nobody knows where they would draw\r\nthe line. Mr. Gladstone's land legislation has been a succession of\r\nswindles. The principle of judicial rents is an atrocious violation of\r\nthe principles of business, one of which lays down the dictum that a\r\nthing is worth as much as it will fetch. Surely the landlord ought to\r\nbe allowed to accept the offer of the highest bidder. And if you take\r\nfrom him that right, and say to him you shall only accept such a\r\nprice, then you should at least guarantee the payment. But no, Mr.\r\nGladstone says you shall only have a certain price, and you must\r\nrecover the money as best you can. The judicial rent law, so much\r\nvaunted, is not so good as it looks. It is often a premium on\r\nindolence and a punishment of industry, and therefore grossly unjust.\r\nLet me tell you how it works in Donegal.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty years ago two men took contiguous farms of exactly the same\r\nextent, at the same rent. There was not a pin to choose in the land,\r\neither. One of them worked continuously, improving the farm until he\r\nalmost wrought himself to pieces. He and his children were at it night\r\nand day, and their industry did wonders, as it always does. The other\r\nwas a lazy fellow, who lay in bed till mid-day and spent half his\r\nwaking hours at fairs and dances. The land in his occupation\r\ndeteriorated until it seemed to want reclaiming. The rent of both\r\nfarms was ten pounds a year. The Land Commission had both cases before\r\nthem, and, of course, based their estimate on the present value of the\r\nland, without reference to any other considerations. Now mark what\r\nhappened--\r\n\r\n\"The industrious man, who should have received a premium as a\r\nbenefactor of his country, had his rent raised from ten pounds to\r\neighteen.\r\n\r\n\"The lazy man, who should have been kicked out of the country as\r\nworthless, and an enemy to progress, had his rent reduced from ten\r\npounds to two pounds fifteen shillings.\r\n\r\n\"The judicial reductions have hardly ever been of real benefit. The\r\naverage Irish peasant is so constituted that when he has less to pay\r\nhe simply makes less effort, or spends the difference, and more than\r\nthe difference, in extra whiskey.\r\n\r\n\"The Donegal peasantry derive much benefit from the Irish practice of\r\ncon-acre. Con-acre means that the land is rented for one crop. It pays\r\nthe landowner well, and he always gets his money. The man who has no\r\nland hires a piece for his potatoes, or for his oats, takes possession\r\nwhen he puts in his seed, and delivers up possession when he gets his\r\ncrop off the ground. They pay, I think, because they have not the land\r\nlong enough to long for it altogether.\"\r\n\r\nI climbed the hill behind the Arran Hotel in company with the\r\nproprietor, Mr. Timony, who also runs several large shops in Donegal.\r\nThe view is magnificent, extending in one direction to Carnowee and\r\nthe Blue Stack mountains, in another far over the wood-fringed bay,\r\nand southward to the Benbulben range, terminated by a steep descent\r\nlike the end of a house. Mr. Timony is a Romanist, but is strongly\r\nopposed to Home Rule, which in his opinion would lead to endless\r\ntrouble and confusion, and would, bring distress on the district, and\r\nnot prosperity. The hill was covered with mushrooms, which were\r\nrotting unregarded. Mine host confessed that he did not know the\r\nedible from the poisonous fungi, and said that the peasants of Donegal\r\nwere in the same case. \"There are tons of these things on the\r\nmountains, but no one gathers them. They would be afraid to go near\r\nthem for fear they would drop down dead on the spot.\" He showed me a\r\nlarge stock of hand-woven cloth made by the peasantry, who, to their\r\ncredit, have mastered the process from beginning to end, and with\r\ntheir rude appliances produce a good-looking article, of which the\r\nonly fault is that it can never be worn out. Irishmen will not buy it,\r\nbut England is an excellent customer, and the trade, already large, is\r\nrapidly increasing. Good tweed, twenty-seven inches wide, may be\r\nbought in Donegal for a shilling a yard, and stout twills for\r\none-and-sixpence. The people shear the wool, card it, spin it, dye the\r\nyarn made from herbs growing on the sea-shore, on the rocks, in the\r\nmeadows, and weave it into cloth, which is much in vogue for shooting\r\nsuits and ladies' dresses. The pieces run from twenty to seventy yards\r\nlong, and whole families are engaged on the work, which commands a\r\nready sale at the wholesale depôts, the price being regulated by the\r\nfineness, evenness of texture, and equality of tint throughout. The\r\nNationalist advice to burn everything English except English coals, is\r\nas hollow as other patriotic utterances. But for England the Donegal\r\npeasantry would have no market for their goods. \"It isn't fine enough\r\nfor Irishmen,\" said Mr. Timony. \"They prefer English shoddy. They like\r\nthe smooth-looking cloth such as I have seen made in Yorkshire,\r\nmanufactured out of rags. There's not ten pounds of wool in a thousand\r\nyards of it. It looks more eyeable, but there is no length nor\r\ntoughness in the thread, which is made out of old worn-out cloth. Our\r\nfolks couldn't spin it. They must use good new yarn, or they couldn't\r\nwork at all. The Yorkshire folks have machinery, and you can do\r\nanything with machinery.\"\r\n\r\nA good old Methodist said:--\"The English people ought now to realise\r\nthe pass their Grand Old Gagger has brought them to. The finest\r\nassembly of gentlemen in the world are bandying evil names and\r\npunching each other's heads. Just what you might expect when the Prime\r\nMinister has allied himself with blackguards and law-breakers. I used\r\nto be one of his staunchest supporters, but I draw the line at lunacy.\r\nWhen I saw him truckling to low-bred adventurers who are not worth\r\nsixpence beyond what they can wring from their dupes, I thought it\r\ntime to change my course. When I saw the class of men with whom he\r\nacts and under whose orders he works, I changed my opinion of the man.\r\nFor evil communications corrupt good manners, and a man is known by\r\nthe company he keeps. The whole session has been a degradation of the\r\nBritish Parliament. Things have been going from bad to worse until we\r\nhave reached the climax. If Mr. Gladstone remains in power we must\r\nchange the qualifications of our members, and send the best fighting\r\nmen and the hardest hitters. We must heckle candidates as to their\r\n'science,' and ascertain if their wind is good, and whether they are\r\nactive on their pins. And in course of time, if the G.O.M. still\r\npresides, we shall have the Speaker acting as referee, and calling out\r\n'Time, gentlemen, Time!' Some Gladstonian or other will doubtless\r\naccept the post, and in that case we may expect him to sport a long\r\nchurchwarden and a glass of beer. That is what Mr. Gladstone is\r\nbringing on the House, and the tendency has been visible for a long\r\ntime. When you hear of people continually shouting 'Judas, Judas,'\r\nwithout a word of protest from the Prime Minister, you must admit that\r\nthe dignity of the House is a thing of the past. When you see the\r\ngeneral trend, you can judge what will be the result. When you see in\r\nwhich direction a man is going, you can judge where he will arrive at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\"For my part, and I can speak for all my friends, we have the greatest\r\nconfidence in the English people's commonsense, and in the long run we\r\nknow it will not fail. The Scotsmen, who are honest politicians and\r\nkeen, are throwing over Mr. Gladstone and all his works, although he\r\nwas for so long their greatest pride. And we are sure that the few\r\nEnglishmen who at the last election followed in his wake will see\r\ntheir error, and that they will joyfully seize the first opportunity\r\nof repairing their mistake. What would happen if the bill became law?\r\nNothing but evil. The Methodists would leave these parts in a body. We\r\ncould not remain with a Catholic Parliament in Dublin. We should not\r\nbe safe but for the English shield that covers us. The people, as a\r\nwhole, are quiet enough--when left alone. But they are very excitable.\r\nKind and civil as they may seem, they turn round in a moment. They\r\nwill believe anything they are told, their credulity is wonderful, and\r\ntheir clergy have them entirely in their hands. The people might be\r\ntolerant, but the clergy never. And Irish priests are very bitter and\r\nvery prejudiced. They say that we have bartered eternity for time, and\r\nthat, although we all thrive and do well, we have sold our souls for\r\nearthly prosperity. My mind is made up. Once that bill becomes law you\r\nmust find room for me in England. We shall be able to live in peace on\r\nthe other side of the Channel.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Methodist believed that the poverty of the people was somehow\r\ndue to their religion. He knew not precisely why this was the case,\r\nbut his observations left him no other conclusion. He instanced\r\nStrabane, the Scots settlement over the border, and although in\r\nTyrone, yet only divided from Donegal by the river Mourne. \"They have\r\nat Strabane an annual agricultural and horticultural exhibition, which\r\ndoes a great amount of good in educating the people. Last week they\r\ndistributed eight hundred pounds in prizes, and there were two\r\nthousand two hundred entries. We have talked about a similar show in\r\nDonegal, but we never do more than talk. We shall never have a show\r\nuntil we get a sufficient number of Scotsmen to organise it and work\r\nit up. The necessary energy for such a big affair seems to be the\r\nprivate property of people holding the Protestant faith, for when we\r\nsee an energetic Romanist we look upon it as something so remarkable\r\nas to merit investigation, and in nearly every case we find the person\r\nin question is, although Catholic, either Saxon or half-breed. Nearly\r\nall the Papists are Kelts. Is their want of energy due to breed, to\r\nreligion, or to both? We hardly know. But I know a man's religion a\r\nmile off, so to speak. Only let me see him at work in a field. His\r\nreligion comes out in his action. A Papist never works hard. He seems\r\nto be always doing as little as ever he can. Then he's very much\r\nsurprised to find himself so poor, when the hard-working Protestant is\r\ngetting on. Presently the Black-mouth gets a farm, while the other\r\nremains a labourer. Then the agitator comes round and says, 'Look how\r\nheretic England favours Protestants. _You_ are the children of the\r\nsoil, but who has the farms?' 'Begorra,' says Michael, 'an' that's\r\nthrue, bedad it is now,' and thenceforward he cherishes a secret\r\nanimosity against the successful man, instead of blaming his own want\r\nof industry. That's human nature. So he votes for Home Rule, for\r\nanything that promises the land to himself, as the son of the soil. He\r\nlooks on the other man as an interloper, and his priest encourages\r\nthat view. That is their feeling, as they themselves express it every\r\nday, and are we to believe against the evidence of our senses that\r\nwhen they have the power to injure us, to drive us out of the country,\r\nby making it too hot to hold us--are we to believe that they will not\r\nexert their power, but on the contrary, will treat us considerably\r\nbetter than before? That is what English Home Rulers ask us to\r\nbelieve. That is what Irish Nationalist speakers say in England: they\r\nwould be laughed at here. Do not trust these men. They are what the\r\nScripture calls 'movers of sedition'--and nothing better.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some search I found a fine young Parnellite, who roundly\r\ndenounced the clergy of his own faith as enemies of their country. He\r\nsaid:--\"I _was_ a Home Ruler, but although I hold the same opinion in\r\ntheory, I would not at this juncture put it into practice. I am\r\nconvinced that it would be bad for us. We are not ripe for\r\nself-government. We want years of training before we could govern\r\nourselves with advantage. The South Meath election petition finally\r\nconvinced me. When I saw how ignorance was used by the clergy for the\r\nfurtherance of their own ends, I decided that we were not yet\r\nsufficiently educated to be entrusted with power; and if Home Rule\r\nwere now offered to us, and the Home Rule that we ourselves have\r\nadvocated, I for one would dread to accept it. We must serve an\r\napprenticeship to the art of self-government. We must have a Local\r\nGovernment Bill, and see how we get on. Then it can from time to time\r\nbe made larger and more liberal, entrusting us as we grow stronger\r\nwith heavier tasks. Give us Home Rule at this moment and you ruin us.\r\nWe should have several factions, more intent on getting power and in\r\ndamaging each other, than on solving all or any of the very\r\ncomplicated and difficult questions which would come before them.\r\nThere would be no spirit of mutual accommodation such as prevails in\r\nEnglish assemblies. And our troubles would be your troubles. Keep it\r\nback for a few years, and lead us up to Home Rule by easy gradations.\r\n\r\n\"My anti-Parnellite friends say they will not return the members now\r\nrepresenting them. I believe they will. And if not, then they will\r\nsend others of no better social standing, and with no Parliamentary\r\ntraining at all. They will send worse men, extreme men, men who have\r\nnot pledged themselves to the British Government. The pledges of\r\nDillon and Davitt--what are they worth? Surely nobody is so foolish as\r\nto rely on such 'safeguards' as these.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure that three-fourths of the educated Catholics of Ireland are\r\nat this moment opposed to Home Rule in any shape or form, but--they\r\ndare not say so. Ireland is a land of tyranny, clerical tyranny.\r\nIreland will not be free until the clergy withdraw their influence\r\nfrom politics. If they continue in their present course, there will be\r\na reaction as education advances, and their last state will be worse\r\nthan the first. I know that some of them would gladly drop politics,\r\nbut they have to look to their bishops.\"\r\n\r\nA Nationalist tradesman said:--\"The Protestants are favoured in every\r\nway. Statistics recently given in the _Freeman_ show that the money\r\nannually paid to the favoured few, who hold appointments which ought\r\nto be open to all, amount to five pounds a head for every Protestant\r\nman, woman, and child in the country. The same favouritism runs\r\nthrough everything. If a Catholic bids for a field of grass a\r\nProtestant bid is taken, even if lower. I saw it done yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend lost his temper when I asked him to say why the heretic\r\nfarmers were thriving while those of the true faith were starving, why\r\nthe heretics were clean while the others were dirty. He at last said\r\nthat the British Government subsidised all Soupers out of the secret\r\nservice money, and making a contemptuous grimace, to express his\r\nopinion of such miscreants, curled up his hand and passed it behind\r\nhis back, thus dramatically indicating the underhand way in which the\r\nmoney is conveyed to the favoured recipients.\r\n\r\nThese people _will_ believe anything. But who tells them this? And why\r\ndo not the clergy undeceive them?\r\n\r\nA final Black-mouth must be quoted. He said that the seller of the\r\nstanding grass preferred the heretical bid, although lower, \"because\r\nhe felt more sure of the money,\" and pointing across the triangular\r\nsquare, yclept the Diamond, said:--\"All those corner-men are Home\r\nRulers. You never see a Unionist idling the day away at\r\nstreet-corners. We have no Protestant corner-boys in Donegal, nor\r\nanywhere else, so far as I know.\" The townsfolk are fairly\r\nindustrious, that is, when compared with the people of Southern Irish\r\ntowns, but there is a residuum--a Home Rule residuum. It sometimes\r\nhappens that jaded men, worn out with overwork, are recommended to go\r\nto some quiet place and to do absolutely nothing. They can't do\r\nnothing, they don't know how to begin. They should go to Donegal. The\r\nplace is silent as the tomb, and if they would learn to do nothing\r\nthey will there find many eminent professors of the science, who,\r\nhaving devoted to it the study of a lifetime, have attained a virtuoso\r\nproficiency.\r\n\r\nDonegal, August 3rd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 57.--BAREFOOTED AND DILATORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Ballyshannon foundered on the coast of Cariboo, And down in\r\nfathoms many went the captain and his crew. Down went the owners,\r\ngreedy men whom hope of gain allured. O, dry the starting tear, for\r\nthey were heavily insured.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thereby hangs a tale.\r\n\r\nProfessor Crawford, of Trinity College, Dublin, says that when walking\r\ndown Regent Street, London, with William Allingham, then editor of\r\n_Fraser's Magazine_, and a native of this Donegal town, the pair met\r\nCharles Dickens, who advanced with beaming countenance, and taking\r\nboth Allingham's hands in his own, said in a hearty voice:\r\n\r\n\"Well done, Ballyshannon!\"\r\n\r\nThis was in allusion to a recent article written by the _Fraser_\r\neditor, who among his intimate friends and brother litterateurs was\r\nplayfully named after his birthplace. W.S. Gilbert was especially fond\r\nof the sonorous appellation, and in the above-quoted Bab Ballad, his\r\ngem of gems, named the ship Ballyshannon in remembrance of Allingham.\r\n\r\nThe Ballyshannon folks are \"going to\" erect a memorial to Allingham,\r\nof whose poems they have often heard. They are \"going to\" advertise\r\ntheir town, and make its beauties known to the world--some day. They\r\nare \"going to\" charter a steam dredger, and so improve the harbour,\r\nwhich is dangerous. They are \"going to\" utilise the enormous\r\nwater-power of the River Erne, which runs to waste from Lough Erne to\r\nthe sea. They are \"going to\" run a few tweed and blanket factories\r\nwhen they see their way quite clearly. They are \"going to\" start a\r\nfishery fleet and a number of fish-curing sheds, to give employment to\r\nthe poor folks of the district. They need almost everything that man\r\n_can_ need, and they have especial facilities for supplying needs, but\r\nas yet they have lacked time and opportunity. The town is only a\r\nthousand years old, and its inhabitants have not yet had time to look\r\nabout them. A number of English anglers stroll about with long salmon\r\nrods, or float their little barks on the broad bosom of the Erne, the\r\npopulation looking dreamily on from the long bridge over the river,\r\nwhich, like the Shannon at Athlone, flows through the heart of the\r\ntown. Nobody seems to be doing anything, except a few old beggar woman\r\nsqualid and frowsy as the mendicant hordes of Tuam, Tipperary,\r\nLimerick, and Galway. The beggars are pertinacious enough for\r\nanything, but theirs is the only enterprise the stranger sees.\r\nCompared with that of Donegal the salmon-fishing seems expensive. The\r\nlandlord of the Arran Hotel in that town offers the Eske at\r\nhalf-a-crown a day, but in Ballyshannon you must pay four pounds a\r\nweek and give up all the take except two. Salmon are scarce all over\r\nIreland this year. Three English fishers on the Erne shared the\r\nuniversal bad luck, for in three days they had only captured one\r\nfive-pounder. The unusual drought has made the water low. The weather\r\nof the past five months has been finer and dryer than any season for\r\nsixty years. Ballyshannon looks dirty and dingy in any weather. It\r\nlacks the smartness, the cleanliness, the width of thoroughfare, which\r\nmark the heretic towns. It lacks the factories, the large shops, the\r\nshipping which would infallibly be to the fore if its inhabitants were\r\nmainly of Teuton origin. On the other hand, the Ballyshannon folks are\r\nreligious. They go to mass regularly, and confess themselves at\r\nfrequent intervals. The confessional box is their only place to spend\r\na happy day, and the act of confession, with the following penance,\r\ntheir pleasantest mode of passing away the time. They are mostly Home\r\nRulers, and are deferring special effort to better themselves until\r\nthe Irish Parliament does away with the necessity. That blessed\r\ninstitution once fairly settled at College Green will spare them the\r\npains of enterprise, and will show how large industries can be created\r\nand sustained without capital, without business knowledge, without\r\ntechnical skill, and for the sole purpose of affording the shiftless\r\npopulation of Ballyshannon regular wages at the week's end. The\r\ngentlemen who lean over the quaint bridge, with its twelve arches and\r\nsharply-pointed buttresses, are merely waiting for the factories,\r\nwhich are to spring from the earth fully-equipped at a wave of the\r\nenchanter's hand, to be a blessing to the whole world while fulfilling\r\ntheir chief mission of finding employment for the people of Ireland.\r\nMeantime the Ballyshannoners are bitterly wroth with England because\r\nshe has not hurried up with the desired factories long ages ago. They\r\nsmoke thick twist and expectorate into the river, talking moodily of\r\nthe selfish Saxon, who instead of looking after them looks after\r\nhimself, and praising Tim Healy, whose spare cash is invested in a\r\nfactory in Scotland. Tim knows his countrymen; but, although his\r\ncleverness is by them much admired, they do not know how really clever\r\nhe is. If they could realise the fact that Tim declines to invest in\r\nIreland they might admire him still more. The great drawback to Irish\r\nenterprise lies in the fact that Irishmen who have brains enough to\r\nmake money have brains enough to invest it out of Ireland. They will\r\nnot trust Irishmen, nor will they rely on Irish industry. Ballyshannon\r\nis waiting for the impersonal Somebody or the shadowy Something that\r\nis to come forward and put everything right. Galway is so waiting,\r\nLimerick is so waiting, Cork is so waiting, Westport, Newport, Donegal\r\nare so waiting. It never occurs to them to do something for\r\nthemselves. When the suggestion is made they become irate, and\r\nexcitedly ask, What could we do? How are we to begin? Where are we to\r\nfind the money? Who is to take the first step? They fail to see that\r\nthe settlement towns have long since answered these queries, and that\r\nthe capacity to do so marks the difference in the breeds. These\r\nhopeless, helpless, Keltic Irishmen are unfit for self-government.\r\nThey require the india-rubber tube and the feeding-bottle. They want\r\nto be spoon-fed and patted on the back when they choke. To instance\r\nthe Scots settlements is to madden them. These thriving communities\r\nare a standing reproach, and cannot be explained away. Saxon Strabane\r\nflourishes, while Keltic Donegal declines, the latter having all the\r\nadvantages of the former with the addition of a harbour and good\r\nfishing grounds. \"Look at the condition of the country,\" say the Home\r\nRulers. \"Behold the poverty of the peasantry,\" they continually do\r\ncry. The visible nakedness of the land is their chief and most\r\neffective argument. The Unionist answer is conclusive, and of itself\r\nshould be enough to demolish the Nationalists. See the Protestant\r\ncommunities of Ireland,--all, without exception, advancing in\r\nprosperity. They have no advantages which are denied to the\r\nNationalists. On the contrary, they live in the comparatively bleak\r\nand unfertile North, which by their unceasing industry they have\r\ndeveloped to its fullest extent. They have tilled the ground until it\r\nresembles a garden, they have deepened the rivers, built harbours,\r\ncreated industries, been in every way successful. And all under\r\nprecisely the same laws, the same government. The richest spots of\r\nIreland, if inhabited by Keltic Irish, are steeped in poverty. The\r\npoorest spots, if inhabited by men of Saxon blood, become fat and\r\nwell-liking. The fate of men lies mostly in themselves. This comes out\r\nforcibly in Ireland. Race, breed, heredity, call it what you will, in\r\nIreland thrusts its influence on you, whether you will or no.\r\nNeighbouring towns, neighbouring farms, neighbouring cottages, present\r\na series of striking contrasts, ever in favour of the Saxon, ever\r\nagainst the Kelt. The latter has not yet discovered that the secret\r\nword, the open sesame of the difficulty, the charm which only can give\r\npermanent comfort, is--Work. Nor has his race the spirit of mechanical\r\ninvention or industrial enterprise, without which College Green\r\nParliaments may sit in vain. The pure-blooded Kelt is easily\r\ndiscouraged, and no man sooner knows when he is beaten. More than\r\nthis, he always expects to be beaten, so that he is beaten before he\r\nbegins. As a talker he is unequalled, and in this long-eared age, when\r\nthe glibbest gabbler is reckoned the greatest man, his agitators have\r\nfloated to the front. The Ballyshannon people can talk with the\r\nvolubility of a Hebrew cheap Jack, but their jaw-power, like their\r\nwater-power, mostly runs to waste. They have the silly suspicion and\r\nthe childish credulity of the Donegal rural districts. A fluent\r\npolitician said, \"Why are all the Protestants Unionists? Perfectly\r\nsimple, that. Because they are all well off. There you are. And being\r\nwell off, they want no change. That's their selfishness. Now we, who\r\nare not Protestants (thank God), are for the most part poor. Our\r\nliving is precarious. We don't know where to look, nor what to do, to\r\nimprove our worldly position. We think it likely that an Irish\r\nParliament would do something for us. In what way? Why, in the\r\ndirection of public works and in the building of factories. Also in\r\nthe protection of Irish industries. Where would the money come from?\r\nWhy, from England, to be sure. And if England wouldn't lend it, plenty\r\nof other nations would; America, for instance. We shall have heaps of\r\nmoney. Mr. Gladstone has said it, and he is famous as a financier.\r\nThere you have the reason why we want Home Rule, while the Protestants\r\ndon't. They are well enough off already.\r\n\r\n\"_Why_ are they well off, you ask? Also easy to answer. They have been\r\nthe spoiled children of fortune. They have been petted and pampered by\r\nEngland for more than two hundred years. And although you will not of\r\ncourse admit it, yet we know, everybody here knows, that they have\r\nbeen secretly subsidised by every Tory Government. If they pay their\r\nrents, where do they get the money? From the Tory party. And Tory\r\nlandlords give the best farms to Protestants, who having the pick of\r\nthe land, ought to be well off. Wherever you go you will find the\r\nProtestants living on good land.\"\r\n\r\nI submitted that authentic records show that Ulster was formerly the\r\nmost sterile, barren, unpromising part of Ireland, and that the change\r\nwas entirely due to the two centuries of unremitting labour which the\r\nScots settlers and their descendants had bestowed on the land; but,\r\nwaiving this point, I asked him why the Unionist, that is, the\r\nProtestant, party were so much better educated, and why the heretics\r\nwere so much cleaner. He had stated that the Black-mouths were\r\nsubsidised by the Tory Party. Did the British Government also supply\r\nthem with soap?\r\n\r\nAt this point my friend's explanations became unintelligible, but his\r\ngeneral drift seemed to indicate that the people were too downtrodden,\r\ntoo much oppressed, were groaning too painfully under the cruel\r\nBritish yoke, to have the spirit to look after the duties of the\r\ntoilet. In other words, the Irish people will wash themselves when\r\nthey get Home Rule. At the next election Mr. Gladstone will doubtless\r\nbring forward this aspect of the case as a sop to the soap-making\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nAnother Ballyshannoner was of a diametrically opposite opinion. \"We\r\nare poor because we have no notion of making money by modern methods.\r\nWe have always lived on the land, selling our superfluity to pay the\r\nrent, and now that our arrangements are disturbed, we don't know which\r\nway to turn. The blame rests with America, whose competition has so\r\nlowered the price of produce that the farmer's superfluity, that is,\r\nwhat he does not consume himself, will no longer suffice to pay the\r\nrent. That is a general statement only. Landlords are generally\r\nreasonable, and meet their tenants fairly enough when the tenants are\r\nwell-disposed and honest. The tenant-farmers of Ireland have no more\r\nto complain of than the tenant-farmers of England--much less in\r\nfact--but they have an army of agitators, an ignorant English press,\r\nand the G.O.M. on their side. That makes all the difference. We have\r\noccasional cases of unfair landlordism, but they are so rare as to be\r\nthe talk of a county or two.\r\n\r\n\"A Mrs. Hazlitt holds, with her farm, about twenty or thirty acres of\r\nslobland reclaimed from the Atlantic. Slobland is land reclaimed from\r\nthe sea. This piece is on Donegal Bay. It was protected by a great\r\ndyke after the Dutch style. But the Atlantic is sometimes angry, and\r\nthen he becomes unmanageable. He was ill-tempered one night (being\r\ntroubled with wind), and he just washed down the dyke and inundated\r\nthe reclaimed meadows, upon, which I have seen the most beautiful\r\ncrops. The landlord, the Reverend James Hamilton, a Protestant rector,\r\ninsists on rent being paid for this washed-away land. He does not\r\nrebuild the dyke, and the land lies waste--the widow paying rent for\r\nacres of useless salt marsh. That is pointed to by all the malcontents\r\nin Donegal as a specimen of landlordism, and Protestant landlordism,\r\nand more especially reverend Protestant landlordism. Nobody but a\r\nparson would exact the rent. These isolated examples are cited to\r\nbring discredit on Protestant landlords in general.\r\n\r\n\"This town is asleep, and it will not awake till the last Judgment. In\r\n1885 we had a manufacturer from Belfast looking about for the best\r\nplace for a big cloth mill on the river. The town was in a ferment of\r\nexcitement, and everybody began to wonder what he would do with his\r\nadditional income. The shop-keepers expected that their customers\r\nwould have twice the money to spend in future, and the working folks\r\nbegan to be cocky with their employers, saying that they would get\r\nmuch better wages at the great factory. Then Mr. Gladstone brought out\r\nhis '86 bill, and the Belfast man drew in his horns. He told me that\r\nhe would not risk a farthing in any speculative venture while the\r\nthreat of Home Rule was held over us. He was quite right. The\r\nBallyshannon men were relieved from the trouble of deciding how they\r\nwould spend their surplus money, and they ranged themselves on the\r\nbridge or at their usual corners, where you may now see them, propping\r\nup the old houses with their lazy backs, and discussing the wrongs of\r\nIreland. What they would do without their supposed, wrongs nobody\r\nknows. In English hands this would be a money-making place. We have\r\nenormous advantages of situation, and the water power is almost\r\nunequalled in Ireland. Yet from here to Belleek, a distance of four\r\nmiles, there is nothing whatever being done with it.\r\n\r\n\"The backwardness of the Irish and their poverty are, in my opinion,\r\ndue to their inferiority as a race of men. Wherever there is a\r\nfactory, you will find all the foremen Protestants--that is, Saxons.\r\nAnd Irishmen expect it. They will not work under Irish foremen, if\r\nthey can help it. The Catholic labourer will work for the Protestant\r\nfarmer, for choice, every time. The Catholic housekeeper goes to the\r\nProtestant shop, by preference. Where their own personal and earthly\r\ninterests are concerned, the Papist population always prefer the\r\nguidance of the cursed heretic. And yet they express for the\r\nBlack-mouths the greatest contempt and aversion, and would willingly\r\nput them out of the country to-morrow. That is because they wish to\r\npossess our goods. They vote for Home Rule in the belief that they are\r\npaving the way for a dismissal of Protestants, and the division of\r\ntheir property. They do not know the name of the man who represents\r\nthem, the title of the Parliamentary division for which he sits, or\r\neven, in many cases, the name of the county in which they themselves\r\nreside. To talk reason to such people would be absurd. Trained from\r\ntheir infancy to regard England as an enemy, they would not listen to\r\nanyone speaking on her behalf. They declare that they are barefoot\r\nbecause England wears their shoes, that they are starving that England\r\nmay be over-fed. The how, the why, the wherefore are not within their\r\nken, but they are sure of the facts. They had them from Father Dick,\r\nTom, or Harry, and the holy man would not tell a lie. Stupid people\r\nover the Channel, listening to this iterated complaint, are acting as\r\nthough it were true. Gladstone took it up, and his followers followed.\r\nNo doubt it was all that most of them could do. Result,--tumult,\r\ndisturbance, confusion worse confounded. Home Rule means that the\r\ncountry will be deluged with blood, that civilisation will receive a\r\nshock which will send back the island for a century. The causes of\r\nIreland's poverty are laziness and lack of enterprise, the latter\r\naccentuated by everlasting disturbance. Before the Nationalists we had\r\nthe Fenians, the Whiteboys, the Ribbon-men, the United Irishmen, the\r\nDefenders, the goodness-knows-what, running back in continuous line up\r\nto the dawn of history. No wonder we are poor. Cannot Gladstonians\r\nread the records? If they did so, and if they were acquainted with the\r\ncharacter of the Irish when in their native land, they would agree\r\nwith my cook, herself a Kelt of Kelts, who says that Irishmen are\r\nleather, good leather, but fit only for the sole, and not for the\r\nuppers.\r\n\r\n\"I used to regard Mr. Gladstone as an honest man. Now I think\r\notherwise. As for the ruck that follow him--well, if they were\r\nintelligent when honest, or honest when intelligent, nobody could\r\nunderstand their deviation from the path of reason and rectitude. But\r\nthe rogues will of course do anything they think will suit them best,\r\nno matter what befalls their country; and as for the rest, why of\r\ncourse no reasonable man would blame people for not thinking, when\r\nProvidence has not provided them with the requisite machinery.\"\r\n\r\nBallyshannon, August 5th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 58.--THE TRUTH ABOUT BUNDORAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no railway between Donegal and Ballyshannon, fifteen miles\r\naway. The largest town in the county is not connected with the\r\nprincipal port. But you can steam from Ballyshannon to Bundoran, the\r\nfavourite watering-place of Donegal, quaint and romantic, with a deep\r\nbay and grassy cliffs. The bathing-grounds have a smooth floor of\r\nlimestone, and the Atlantic rolls in majestically, sending aloft\r\ncolumns of white spray as its waters strike the outlying islands of\r\nrock, each with a green crown of vegetation. The bare-headed and\r\nbare-legged natives walk side by side with the fashionably-dressed\r\ncitizens of Dublin, Belfast, and Londonderry. The poorest folks are\r\ntolerably clean, and, unlike the Southerners, occasionally wash their\r\nfeet. The town is small, but there is plenty of good accommodation for\r\nholiday makers. Bundoran is Catholic and intolerant. Although\r\ndepending on their Protestant countrymen for nine-tenths of their\r\nlivelihood, the people of Bundoran object to Protestantism, and the\r\nintensity of their antipathy to the Black-mouths has impelled them to\r\nquarrel with their bread-and-butter. Of late the question of tolerance\r\nhas been much discussed. Sapient persons whose assumption is equal to\r\ntheir ignorance of the subject, affect to despise the fears of the\r\nscattered Protestant population whose alarm is based on the experience\r\nof a lifetime. English Home Rulers who wish to create effect\r\nunblushingly affirm that the Protestants are the only intolerants, and\r\nthat the Papists are as distinguished for affectionate toleration as\r\nfor industry and honesty. In direct opposition to daily experience and\r\nthe evidence of history, they assert that the Papists are the\r\npersecuted party, and that they only practise their religion with fear\r\nand trembling. Notwithstanding the well-known doctrine of the Roman\r\nChurch, which preserves heaven exclusively for those within its own\r\npale, these eccentric politicians aver that under a Roman Catholic\r\nParliament, elected by the clergy alone, the isolated Protestants of\r\nCatholic Ireland, known in the Papist vernacular as Black-faces,\r\nBlack-mouths, Heretics, Soupers, and Jumpers, would be treated with\r\nperfect consideration, would enjoy the fullest freedom, the most\r\nindulgent toleration, would, in short, be placed in a position of\r\nequality with the predestined inhabitants of Paradise, or, to quote\r\nCatechism, the inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven. The persons most\r\nnearly concerned know better. The shrewd farmers of Ulster, like the\r\nPuritan brethren of Leinster, Munster, and Connaught, are entirely\r\ndevoid of faith in the promised Papist toleration. Protestant equality\r\nunder a Home Rule Parliament! You might as well tell them to plant\r\npotatoes and expect therefrom a crop of oats. Men do not gather grapes\r\noff thorns nor figs off thistles.\r\n\r\nThe Bundoran Protestants have evidence to offer. The date is recent.\r\nNot two hundred years ago, but in the year of grace\r\neighteen-hundred-and-ninety-three. Seeing that the little seaside\r\nresort was full of holiday-makers from the Protestant counties of\r\nFermanagh and Tyrone, two young Protestant clergymen determined to hold\r\nGospel services in a tent which was pitched in a field the property of\r\nMr. James A. Hamilton, J.P. For about a week beforehand handbills\r\nannouncing the services for July 21 had been distributed in the town\r\nand suburbs, but no controversial topic was mentioned, nor was it\r\nintended that the services should be other than strictly evangelical.\r\nThe tent was erected solely to accommodate the great influx of\r\nvisitors, after the manner so familiar in England. Here was a test of\r\nPapal toleration. The tent was on private ground, and if Papists did\r\nnot like it they could easily keep away, making a wry face and spitting\r\nout the abomination as they passed, after their liberal custom. This,\r\nhowever, was not enough. No sooner had the handbills been issued, than\r\na most scurrilous placard appeared, calculated to inflame the passions\r\nof the ignorant, and to make them act after their kind. The Gospellers\r\nwere accused of an attempt to poach on the Papal preserves, and it was\r\nmockingly stated that they had at last come to Christianise the\r\nbenighted Papists. The effect of this placard was soon evident. It\r\nbecame known that the Roman Catholics of the district had determined\r\nthat they would allow no Gospel services in Bundoran. The police\r\nauthorities, who know all about Papist \"tolerance,\" increased the small\r\nvillage force to twenty-five men, but, as the result proved, these were\r\nabsolutely useless. A mob of more than a thousand pious ruffians\r\ngathered early in the evening, and attacked in a brutal and merciless\r\nmanner every person they suspected of being on the way to the meeting.\r\nThe two Evangelists went to the tent under the escort of the\r\ntwenty-five policemen, but before they could commence the service the\r\napostles of toleration made a desperate rush on the congregation, most\r\nof whom were struck with bludgeons and stones, knocked down, kicked,\r\nand otherwise maltreated. The constabulary with great determination,\r\nbut with much difficulty, protected the two young clergymen, upon whom\r\na most venomous attack was made. The Protestants defended themselves\r\nwith umbrellas, walking-sticks, and the like, but being strongly\r\ncharged these proved of little avail against the wild onslaught of the\r\nparty of toleration. Well may the local paper say that \"a regular panic\r\npervades the resident and visiting Protestant families.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Morley, replying to a question in the House, said the reports were\r\nexaggerated. The hapless Irish Secretary, unable to meet this and\r\nsimilar charges with denial, always relies on the plea of\r\n\"exaggeration.\" The statement given above is derived from\r\neye-witnesses of both creeds, and from an official source. One word as\r\nto the plea of exaggeration.\r\n\r\nWhen I had investigated the fifteen moonlighting atrocities of four\r\nweeks in County Limerick, the County Inspector, who had just returned\r\nfrom a conference with Mr. Morley, said to me:--\r\n\r\n\"Everything is ve-ry quiet. We're going on very nicely now.\" But the\r\n_Gazette_ gave particulars of the shooting in the legs of the four\r\nmembers of the Quirke family, and Mr. Morley was obliged to admit the\r\nfifteen outrages which constituted County Inspector Moriarty's idea of\r\n\"quiet.\" Subordinates will say there is peace when there is no peace,\r\nif the master requires it. The Bundoran outrage is not susceptible of\r\nexaggeration. Call another witness.\r\n\r\nThe _Sligo Independent_, which being published on the spot can speak\r\nwith authority, says that \"the intolerant and bigoted Roman Catholics\r\nof Bundoran and surrounding districts look upon Protestantism as a\r\nkind of leprosy which ought at all hazards to be stamped out,\" and\r\nfurther states that \"even the ladies did not escape their fanatical\r\nhatred and fury. Several people were severely injured, and a clergyman\r\nwho was coming to the meeting with his Bible in his hand, was thrown\r\ndown and badly beaten, the Book being torn from him and destroyed.\r\nWhat may Protestants expect should the Home Rule Bill ever become law,\r\nwhen such disgraceful outbursts of religious bigotry are quite common\r\nunder the existing _régime_? The natural conclusion is that all such\r\nGospel meetings would be put down with a strong hand, and Protestant\r\nreligious liberty trampled under foot by their unscrupulous Roman\r\nCatholic fellow-countrymen. And yet Loyalists are told to trust in\r\nthem and all will be well!\" Thus the Sligo journal; and its editor may\r\nperhaps, under the circumstances, be pardoned for suggesting that \"it\r\nwere better for Loyalists not to put themselves in the power of men\r\nwho have proved themselves unfit even to associate with civilised\r\nbeings. Bundoran will feel the evil effects of these insane attacks\r\nupon defenceless people next season when tourists and pleasure-seekers\r\nwill avoid this seat of stupid bigotry, and visit some other summer\r\nresort where they will at least be allowed to worship their Maker\r\naccording to their own desires.\" Exactly. Many visitors left at once,\r\nand will never return. During my six hours' stay I heard complaints of\r\nthe falling-off of business. If the place be empty next summer the\r\npeople will attribute the loss to the British Government, and\r\nespecially to the machinations of the Tory party. An old fisherman\r\nsaid the fish had left the bay. I assured him they would return under\r\na Dublin Parliament. He refused to be comforted, because they were\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThere is no railway from Bundoran to Sligo, that is, no direct\r\nrailway. The great lines mostly run from east to west, but the west\r\nlacks connecting links. Look at the map of Ireland. Cast your eye on\r\nthe west coast. If you would go by rail from Westport to Sligo, you\r\nmust first go east to Mullingar. If you would go by rail from Sligo to\r\nBundoran, you must first go east to Enniskillen. If from Bundoran to\r\nDonegal, less than twenty miles, you must again go to Enniskillen,\r\nthence to Strabane, where you arrive after the best part of a day's\r\njourney, ten miles further away than when you started, thence to\r\nStranorlar, changing there to the narrow-gauge railway for your final\r\ntrip. Travelling on the west coast is tedious and expensive, whether\r\nyou go round by rail or drive direct. Many of the most attractive\r\ntourist districts are almost inaccessible. To open them up is to\r\nenrich the neighbourhood. Few Englishmen know what the Balfour\r\nrailways really mean. The following statement gives particulars\r\nrespecting the Light Railways authorised by the Salisbury Government,\r\nand constructed either wholly or in part by the nation. These\r\nrailways introduce tourists to those parts of Ireland which are best\r\nworth visiting, and the economy of time, money, and muscular tissue\r\neffected by them would be hard to overestimate. But this is not all,\r\nnor was this their primary purpose. They gave and still give\r\nemployment to the people of the district, and besides bringing the\r\nmoney of the tourists into the country, enable the natives to send\r\ntheir produce out of it, to place it on the market, to turn it into\r\ngold. There is no railway from Dugort, in Achil, to any market. Fish\r\ncaught in Blacksod Bay are therefore worth nothing except as food for\r\nthe fisherman's family. Large crabs were offered to me for one\r\nhalfpenny each. Does this fact impress the usefulness of Balfour's\r\nrailways? Here they are complete:--\r\n\r\n                              Length in    Balfour's\r\n              Name.           miles.       contribution.\r\n  Donegal and Killybegs        17-3/4       £115,000\r\n  Stranorlar and Glenties      24-1/2        116,000\r\n\r\nOn this line you run for twelve miles from Stranorlar without seeing a\r\nsingle cottage. There are none within sight on either side.\r\n\r\n  Downpatrick and Ardglass      7-1/4        £30,000\r\n  Galway and Clifden           50            264,000\r\n\r\nThis will run in connection with the splendid system of the Midland\r\nand Western Railway, opening up the grand scenery of Connemara, which\r\nto the average Britisher is like a new world. No end of fishing here\r\namong virgin shoals of trout and salmon, and nearly always for\r\nnothing. It was along the first sixteen miles of this line, still\r\nunopened, that I ran on the engine to Oughterard.\r\n\r\n  Westport to Mulranney        18-1/4       £131,400\r\n      To which is added the\r\n  Achil Island extension        8-1/4         65,000\r\n\r\nThis will enable travellers to steam from Dublin to Achil Island viâ\r\nMidland and Western, instead of the ten hours on an open car, which on\r\ntheir arrival at Westport now awaits visitors to Dugort. It was on\r\nthis line that I had the startling adventures on a fiery untamed bogey\r\nengine, lent to the _Gazette_ by Mr. Robert Worthington, of Dublin.\r\nBut I must condense.\r\n\r\n  Claremorris and Collooney                   47         £150,000\r\n  Ballina and Killala                          6-1/2       44,000\r\n  Bantry extension                             2           15,000\r\n  Baltimore extension                          8           56,700\r\n  West Kerry and Valentia                     27           85,000\r\n  Headford and Kenmare                        20           50,000\r\n  Milltown, Malbay, Kilkee, and Kilrush       26   2% on  120,000\r\n  Tuam and Claremorris                        17   2  \"    97,000\r\n  Ballinrobe and Claremorris                  12   2  \"    71,664\r\n\r\nBesides these, similar lines have been constructed, and are now\r\nworking between Tralee, Dingle, and Castlegregory; Skibbereen and\r\nSkull; Ballinscarty, Timoleague, and Courtmacsherry. The Cork and\r\nMuskerry Railway, which runs through the groves of Blarney, owes its\r\ncompletion and success to Mr. Balfour's administration.\r\n\r\nDriving from Bray to the Dargle, my jarvey pointed to the ruins of a\r\nlight railway undertaken without the aid of the British intellect.\r\n\"'Tis a nice mess they made iv it, the quarrelin' pack o' consated\r\neejits! They must run a chape little thing to the Dargle, about two\r\nmiles away, along the roadside, just as Balfour showed them the way.\r\nWhat have they done? Desthroyed the road. Lost all the money they\r\ncould raise. Got the maker to take back the rails (for they bought\r\nthim afore they wanted thim), an' the only thing they now have in the\r\nshape of shareholders' property is a lawsuit wid the Wicklow folks\r\nabout desthroyin' the road. Faix, an iligant dividend is that same.\r\nAn' them's the chaps that's to rule the counthry. That's the sort of\r\nthim, I mane. Many's the time I seen the Irish mimbers. Sorra a thing\r\ncan they do, barrin' dhrink an' talk. I wouldn't thrust one of thim to\r\nrub down a horse, nor wid a bottle of poteen. Divil a one of thim but\r\nwould dhrink as much whiskey as would wash down a car, an' if they\r\ncould run as fast as they can talk, begorra, ye might hunt hares wid\r\nthim. Rule the counthry, would ye. Whe-w-w-w!\" He whistled with a\r\n\"dying fall,\" like the strain in _Twelfth Night_.\r\n\r\nI drove from Bundoran to Sligo, the sea on the right, the Benbulben\r\nmountains on the left, singularly shaped but splendid. The round\r\ntowers and ancient Irish crosses, the lakes and rivers of Sligo, are\r\nfull of interest and beauty. The Abbey ruins are exceptionally fine.\r\nThe town is fairly well built, but it is easy to realise that once\r\nmore it is Connaught. During a turn round Bridge Street, a country\r\ncart heaves alongside, steered by a stalwart man in hodden gray. He\r\nnotes the stranger, and politely says,\r\n\r\n\"Can I be of any use? I see you are a visitor.\"\r\n\r\nWe fell into conversation. Presently I said, \"Everything will be well\r\nwhen you get Home Rule.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped the cart and protested against this statement. Unknowingly\r\nI had tapped a celebrity. My hodden-gray friend was none other than\r\nthe famous Detective James Magee, who arrested James Stephens, the\r\nNumber One, the Head Centre of the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood;\r\nalso John O'Leary, editor of the Fenian _Irish People_, of which\r\nO'Donovan Rossa was business manager. O'Leary was a doctor hailing\r\nfrom Tipperary. He asked Magee if he might have his \"night-cap,\" and\r\nhis captor allowed him to call for the whiskey at a well-known Dublin\r\nresort, on parole of honour. Later, as a crowded street was reached,\r\nO'Leary said, \"There are three thousand of my friends there. If you go\r\nthat way I cannot save you. Better try a back street.\" \"That was\r\nhandsome,\" said Mr. Magee. \"O'Leary was a gentleman. Stephens was only\r\na 'blower.'\" My friend was unalterably set against Home Rule, which he\r\nregards as an empty, foolish cry. Being a pensioner he wishes to be\r\nreticent, but his opinion is pronounced, and the Sligo people know it.\r\nHe has a high opinion of the law-abiding instincts of his compatriots,\r\nand believes that \"if they were left to themselves\" the district\r\nwould need no police. \"A better-hearted, kinder, more obliging people\r\nnever lived,\" said this excellent judge, who after twenty-seven years\r\nof police service, returned to end his days among them. And my short\r\nexperience of the Sligo folks confirms this statement. They were not\r\nall so reserved as Detective-sergeant Magee. A thriving shopkeeper\r\nsaid:--\"The majority, if you count noses, are for Home Rule, but if\r\nyou count only brains and intelligence you would find an overwhelming\r\nmajority against it. Mr. Gladstone and his set of blockheads seem\r\nquite impervious to reason, and even the constituencies of England\r\nseem to lack information. The reason is plain. While we have been\r\nminding our work the Nationalists have been agitating. For thirteen\r\nyears they have been on the stump, and have stolen a march on us and\r\nthey take a lot of catching up. We allowed them to empty their\r\nwind-bags, forgetting that the English people were not so conversant\r\nwith the facts or with the character of the orators as we are. We\r\nthought that no precautions were required, and that their preposterous\r\nstatements would be received in England as intelligent, enlightened\r\npeople would receive them here. Their strength in Ireland is almost\r\nentirely among the illiterates, who in the polling booths are coerced\r\nby their priests. I have seen a man crying because he had not been\r\nallowed to vote for the candidate supported by his employer. Such a\r\nridiculous thing could not happen in England, and Englishmen who do\r\nnot know Ireland and the Irish will scarcely credit it. This shows how\r\nunable most Saxons are to understand Irish character and motive.\r\n\r\n\"All our civilisation is from England, all our progress, all our\r\nenlightenment, and nearly all our money. As a poor, helpless,\r\nsemi-barbaric country, we ought to cleave to England with all our\r\nmight and main. A more and more complete and perfect unity is our best\r\nhope. To ask for separation is the wildest absurdity. And just as we\r\nwere beginning to go along smoothly! That was entirely due to the just\r\nbut firm administration of the Balfour period.\r\n\r\n\"Among Irishmen justice with firmness is always appreciated in the\r\nlong run. An Irish Secretary needs the hand of iron in the velvet\r\nglove. Paddy spots the philanthropic fumbler in a moment, and uses\r\nhim, laughing the while at what he rightly calls his 'philandering.'\r\nMorley means well, but nobody here respects him. He knows no more of\r\nIrish character than a blind bull-pup. His master in my opinion is\r\nworse, if possible. He is deaf to all the arguments of Irish sense and\r\nIrish culture, and proposes to finally resolve the unresolvable, to\r\nsettle the Irish difficulty by a Catholic Parliament. As well go out\r\nwith a net to catch the wind. He listens to the representatives of\r\nruffianism, counting them first. We kept silent too long. We thought\r\nthe donkeys might bray for ever without shaking down the stars. We\r\nwere wrong. Now we are almost powerless. For what are a handful of\r\nreasonable men against a crowd of blackguards with big sticks?\"\r\n\r\nWhile conversing with Detective Magee, that astute gentleman pointed\r\nout The O'Connor, lineal King of Connaught, and a staunch Unionist! A\r\ndevout Catholic and intensely Irish, yet the uncrowned King is a\r\nloyalist. But The O'Connor is a man of superior understanding. After\r\nthis I saw three Home Rulers--yea, I conversed with four, one a\r\npositive person whom I mistook for a farm labourer, but who proved to\r\nbe a National schoolmaster who absorbed whiskey like the desert sands.\r\nA decent farmer who thought the Land League the finest thing in the\r\nwuruld, complained that while the British Government have contracted\r\nfor hay at £8 15s., yet he and his friends could only get £3 for \"best\r\nsaved.\" His idea of Home Rule was--No Rent to pay. A ferocious\r\ncommercial traveller, whose jaw and cheekbones were as much too large\r\nas his eyes and forehead were too small, wanted to know \"what right\r\nhad England to rule Ireland? Ye have no more right to rule Ireland\r\nthan to rule France.\" This was his only idea. He was a patriot of the\r\nsentimental type, and wished that Ireland might take her place as an\r\nindependent nation with Belgium, Switzerland, Holland. His hero was\r\nPaddy O'Donnell, of Bedlam--_clarum et venerabile nomen_--who for five\r\ndays held his house, since called the Fort, against a strong force of\r\npolice. \"If all was like O'Donnell, we'd soon have the counthry to\r\nourselves,\" said my commercial friend. \"An' if ye don't let us go,\r\nwe'll make ye wish ye did. Wait till ye get into throuble with France.\r\nThe Siam business may yet turn up thrumps.\" He was very voluble, very\r\nloud, very illiterate, and I declined to discuss the question except\r\nin Irish, which he did not speak. Like most of the patriot orators of\r\nIreland, he was as ignorant of his native language as of his native\r\nliterature, and every other. This is the class from whom the political\r\nspeakers who infest country places are drawn. At first sight they seem\r\nunworthy of notice, but contempt may be pushed too far. Even wasps\r\nbecome dangerous when in swarms. And Hatred is like fire: it makes\r\neven light rubbish deadly.\r\n\r\nSligo, August 8th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 59.--IRISH NATIONALISM IS NOT PATRIOTISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy tour through Ireland having now come to an end, I propose to sum up\r\nthe conclusions I have formed in this and the three following\r\narticles. In connection with the Home Rule Bill, we have heard much of\r\nthe \"aspirations of a people.\" Mr. Gladstone has taken up the cry, and\r\nhis subservient followers at once brought their speeches and facial\r\nexpressions into harmony with the selected sentiment. These\r\nanti-English Englishmen would fain pose as persons in advance of their\r\ntime, determined to do justice though the heavens should fall. They\r\nagree with Mr. Labouchere that John Bull is a tyrant, a robber, and a\r\nhypocrite, and that it is high time justice should be done to Ireland.\r\nAs no substantial injustice exists, it is necessary to fall back on\r\nsentiment, and to quote the \"aspirations of a people.\" The desire for\r\na system of Irish autonomy is praised as a manifestation of patriotism\r\nwhich in all ages of the world has been honoured by worthy men. The\r\nEnglish supporters of Mr. Gladstone, with their assumption of superior\r\nvirtue, their Pharasaic We are not as other men, nor even as these\r\nTories, would have us believe that with the granting of self-rule\r\nIreland will be satisfied, that the gratification of a laudable\r\nsentiment is all that is now required to bind together the peoples in\r\nan infrangible Union of Hearts, and that peace and prosperity will at\r\nonce follow in the wake of this merely sentimental concession.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of the Irish electorate know nothing of all this. Tap\r\nthem wherever you will, north, south, east, or west, and you find one\r\ndominant thought--that of pecuniary gain. They know nothing of the\r\nproposed bill, and are totally incapable of comprehending its scope\r\nand effect. The peasantry of Ireland are actuated by motives entirely\r\ndifferent from those affecting the rural constituencies of England.\r\nThe Briton is proud of his country, believes in its might, justice,\r\nsupremacy; and despite occasional grumbling is satisfied that the\r\npowers that be will do him right in the long run. The Irish peasant is\r\nessentially inimical to England. He is always \"agin the\r\nGovernment\"--that is, the rule of England. He regards the landlord as\r\ntrebly an enemy--firstly as a heretic, secondly as the representative\r\nof British rule, and last, but by no means least, as the person to\r\nwhom rent is due. He desires to abolish the landlord, not in the\r\ninterests of religion--I speak now of the peasantry, and not the\r\nclergy--and not in the interests of patriotism, for if a Dublin\r\nParliament were to cost him sixpence, the priests themselves could\r\nhardly drag him to the poll; but purely and simply to avoid any\r\nfurther payment of what he regards as the accursed impost on the land.\r\nPhillip Fahy, the leading light of Carnaun, near Athenry, is exactly\r\ntypical of rural Irish Patriotism. \"Did ye hear of the Home Rule Bill?\r\nWhat does it mane, at all, at all? Not one o' us knows more than that\r\nlump o' stone ye sit on. Will it give us the land for nothin', for\r\nthat's all we hear? We'll be obliged av ye could explain it a thrifle,\r\nfor sorra one but's bad off, an' Father O'Baithershin says 'Howld yer\r\nwhist,' says he 'till ye see what'll happen,' says he. Will we get the\r\nbit o' ground widout rint, yer honner's glory?\" Mr. Tynan, of Monivea,\r\nsaid that his landlord was liberal and good, and admitted that his\r\nland was not too highly rented, but, said he, \"We have no objection to\r\ndo better still.\" The run on the Irish Post Office Savings Banks at\r\nonce illustrates the patriotism of the people and their confidence in\r\nthe proposed Dublin Parliament. It was well known and understood, so\r\nfar as the poorer classes are capable of understanding anything, that\r\nthe floating balance of the Post Office Banks would constitute the\r\nonly working capital of the Irish Legislature. Here was an\r\nopportunity for self-sacrifice. Here was a chance of manifesting the\r\nfaith animating the lovers of their country. But at the same time it\r\nwas made known that the Post Office would pass from the British\r\ncontrol to that of the Irish people's chosen representatives. It might\r\nhave been supposed that the electors would rejoice thereat with\r\nexceeding great joy, and that in order to show their trust in an Irish\r\nParliament they would increase their deposits, and at considerable\r\npersonal inconvenience refrain from withdrawals. Nothing of the kind.\r\nThe \"aspirations of a people\" were at once strongly defined, but this\r\ntime not in the direction of patriotism. It availed not to urge upon\r\nthem the argument that the four millions of the Post Office Savings\r\nBanks were absolutely necessary to the successful administration of an\r\nIrish Parliament. In patriotic Dublin the run on the Post Office was\r\ntremendous. The master of a small sub-office told me that the\r\nwithdrawals over his counter had for some time amounted to £200 per\r\nweek, and that they were increasing to £70 per day. There was not\r\nenough gold in Dublin to meet the demands, and cash was being\r\nforwarded from London. The patriots who had no money deposited in the\r\nPost Office made no secret of their indignation, stigmatising their\r\nfellow-countrymen as recreants and traitors, but without perceptible\r\neffect. The Dublin Savings Bank became the trusted depositary of the\r\nmoney. This institution is managed by an association of Dublin\r\nmerchants, not for profit, but for the encouragement of thrift, and\r\nthe confidence reposed in them was doubtless due to the fact that the\r\ndirectors, on the introduction of the Home Rule Bill, had publicly\r\nannounced their intention, on the bill becoming law, to pay twenty\r\nshillings in the pound and at once to close the bank. The patriot\r\ndepositors were not deterred by this announcement, nor by the\r\ndirectors' letter to Mr. Gladstone, in which they declared that their\r\ndetermination to wind up the affairs of the bank was due to the fact\r\nthat in the interest of their depositors they felt themselves unable\r\nto accept the security of an Irish Legislature. Patriotism would\r\nsurely have resented this imputation. But Nationalism in its present\r\nphase is nothing more than selfish cupidity and lust of gain. This is\r\nmade abundantly manifest by the freely-uttered sentiments of all\r\nclasses of the Nationalist party. The first answer I received to an\r\ninquiry as to what advantages would be derived from a patriot\r\nParliament was elicited from an ancient Dubliner, whose extraordinary\r\ncredulity was equal to anything afterwards met with in the rural\r\ndistricts:--\"The millions an' millions that John Bull dhrags out iv\r\nus, to kape up his grandeur, an' to pay sojers to grind us down, we'll\r\nput into our own pockets, av you plaze.\" The complaint about the\r\nBritish Government veto on Irish mining, which I fondly believed to be\r\nsporadic, proved to be chronic, universal. Here again the notion of\r\neasily acquired wealth was the impulse, and not the pure and\r\nself-denying influence of patriotism. \"The British Government won't\r\nallow us to work the gold mines in the Wicklow mountains. Whin we get\r\nthe bill every man can take a shpade, an', begorra! can dig what he\r\nwants. The Phaynix Park is all cram-full o' coal that the Castle folks\r\nwon't allow us to dig, bad scran to them! Whin we get the bill we'll\r\nsink them mines an' send the Castle to blazes.\" The coal under the\r\nPhoenix Park is a matter of pious belief with every back-slum\r\nDubliner. The gold of the Wicklow mountains is proverbial all over\r\nIreland. There is not a nobleman's demesne that does not cover untold\r\nwealth in some shape or form. It may be gold, silver, copper, lead, or\r\nonly coal or iron. But it is there, and the people of the\r\nneighbourhood want an Irish Parliament in order that the treasures may\r\nbe turned into money. The more intelligent Nationalists foster these\r\nbeliefs, although they know them to be without foundation. They know\r\nthat the treasures do not exist in paying quantities, and also that if\r\nthey did exist their fellow-countrymen are too lazy to dig them up.\r\nThe Nationalist orators never rely on patriotic sentiment. They\r\npromise the land for nothing. Mr. William O'Brien has unceasingly\r\noffered as a bribe the promise of prairie rents for the farmers, but\r\nTim Healy went one better when at Limerick he said that \"The people of\r\nthis country never ought to be satisfied so long as a single penny of\r\nrent is paid for a sod of land in the whole of Ireland.\" Well might\r\nSir George Trevelyan say that Irish agitators have done much to\r\ndemoralise the country, and that in many parts of Ireland they gained\r\ntheir livelihood by criminal agitation. The same authority tells us\r\nthat \"an Irish Parliament will be independent of the Parliament of\r\nthis country, but will be dependent on the votes of the small farmers,\r\nwho have been taught that rent is robbery.\" That is a precise\r\nstatement of the position so far as the agricultural voters are\r\nconcerned. Their patriotism is nothing more nor less than a sure and\r\ncertain hope of pecuniary advantage. The green flag of Ireland has no\r\ncharms for them. The ancient glories of Hibernia are sung to them in\r\nvain. They care not for the Onward march to Freedom. They will make no\r\nsacrifices on the shrine of their country. The subscriptions furnished\r\nby the Irish peasantry for the furtherance of the cause amount to\r\nalmost nothing, although extorted partly by compulsion and partly by\r\nthe hope of future profit. The following facts will show how\r\nspontaneous is their patriotism. At a Sunday meeting at Gurteen in\r\n1887, the Very Reverend Canon O'Donohoe in the chair, it was resolved,\r\n\"That a collection for the defence of Messrs. Dillon and O'Brien be\r\nmade during the ensuing week in this locality, and that not less than\r\nsixpence be accepted from any person. _Anyone not subscribing will be\r\nconsidered not in sympathy with the Branch._\" Those only who know\r\nIreland well will be able to appreciate the terrible significance of\r\nthe last sentence of this resolution, which for the information of the\r\npeasantry was made public in the Nationalist _Sligo Champion_. A\r\nsimilar incentive to patriotism seems to have been required by the\r\nKilshelan Branch, for at another Sunday Meeting, the Reverend Father\r\nDunphy in the chair, it was unanimously resolved, \"That all members\r\nwho do not pay in subscriptions on or before the next meeting, which\r\nwill be held on the last Sunday of this month, shall have their names\r\npublished and posted on the chapel gate for two consecutive Sundays.\"\r\nThis quotation is from the _Munster Express_, published in Limerick.\r\nAt a meeting reported by the _Kerry Sentinel_ \"the conduct of several\r\nmembers, who had not renewed their subscriptions, was strongly\r\ncondemned, the reverend president, Father T. Enright, giving orders to\r\nhave a list, with their names, sent to him before the next meeting.\"\r\nThe chapel doors are used as instruments of boycotting. The priest\r\nsits in judgment on all who are not sufficiently patriotic. The people\r\nare compelled to subscribe to the cause, whether they like it or not.\r\nThese cases could be multiplied to infinity. They not only give an\r\nexcellent illustration of the conduct of the Irish clergy in political\r\naffairs, but they also furnish a curious commentary on the enthusiasm\r\nwhich is supposed to mark the Aspirations of a People, who, as Mr.\r\nGladstone might say are \"rightly struggling to be free.\" I have\r\nconversed with hundreds of Irish farmers and I never yet met one who\r\nwas willing to sacrifice a sixpence on \"the altar of his country,\" or\r\nto trust an Irish Parliament with his own property, or to invest a\r\npenny on purely Irish security. He loves his ease, no man likes it\r\nbetter, and No Rent means less exertion. Mr. O'Doherty, of County\r\nDonegal, a Catholic Home Ruler, said the landlords were all right now\r\nunder compulsion, but what the tenantry demanded was to be released\r\nentirely from the landlords' yoke. The farmers, he said, cared nothing\r\nfor Home Rule, but the Nationalists had preached prairie value, and\r\nthe people expected to drive out the landowners and Protestants. Mr.\r\nJohn Cook, of Londonderry, a Protestant Home Ruler and a man of\r\nculture, did not claim patriotism for the Nationalists, and\r\nunconsciously put his finger on the real incentive when he said:--\"The\r\nlandlords will be wronged under the present bill. It is a bad bill, an\r\nunjust bill, and will do more harm than good. England should have a\r\nvoice in fixing the price of the land, for if the matter be left to\r\nthe Irish Parliament gross injustice will be done. The tenants were\r\nbuying their land, aided by the English loans, for they found that\r\ntheir two-and-three-quarter per cent. interest came lower than their\r\nrent. But they have quite ceased to buy, because they expect the Irish\r\nLegislature to give them even better terms--or even to get the land\r\nfor nothing.\" Patriotism had meanwhile received another sop. Mr. Healy\r\nadvised the farmers to think twice before they bought their land, and\r\nhinted that their patience was likely to be well rewarded. Father J.\r\nCorcoran at Mullahoran, when consulted by a body of tenant farmers\r\nwhose landlord offered to sell, distinctly advised them not to\r\npurchase, and gave a practical instruction on the subject, in which he\r\nendeavoured to prove that seventeen or eighteen years' purchase was at\r\npresent unworthy of consideration, and advising the greatest caution\r\nin buying at all under present circumstances. The farmers' conception\r\nof Nationalism is plunder and confiscation. They vote for Home Rule\r\nbecause they thereby expect to make money, to become freeholders,\r\nlandlords themselves, in short. They are taught that they have an\r\ninherent right to the land, and that an Irish Parliament will restore\r\nthem their own. Father B. O'Hagan, addressing a meeting in company\r\nwith William O'Brien, said:--\"We have two classes of landlords, in\r\nbrief. We have the royal scoundrels who took the land of our\r\nforefathers. I ask any of those noble ruffians to show me the title by\r\nwhich they lay claim to the soil of my ancestors. Then we have the\r\nlandlords who have purchased their estates in the Land Courts. But\r\nthey bought stolen goods, and they knew that the land was stolen. We\r\nmust get rid of the landlords.\" Paddy is perfectly safe. The landlords\r\nwho claim in descent and those who buy in the open market are equally\r\ndenounced. Let him support the Nationalist party, and the land becomes\r\nhis own. He does so, and his motive is by the unthinking called\r\npatriotism and by Mr. Gladstone the Aspirations of a People.\r\n\r\nThere are of course other classes of Nationalists, but in comparison\r\nwith the immense preponderance of rural voters they do not count for\r\nmuch. Mr. McGregor, of Anglesea Street, Dublin, once an earnest\r\nGladstonian, said:--\"The corner-men are Home Rulers because they want\r\nto spend what they never earned, and the farmers because they hope to\r\nget the land for nothing.\" The Dublin hotel-keepers are mostly Home\r\nRulers, and the proprietor of Jury's, next door to the proposed House\r\nin College Green, is supposed to be consumed with patriotic fire. The\r\nhotel has recently been refitted. The Dublin shopkeepers, \"those of\r\nthe largest size,\" are strangely lacking in patriotism, and mostly\r\nsupport the Union. Patriotism is claimed for the Nationalist members,\r\nwho, according to Nationalist sheets, were lifted from bog-holes,\r\ntripe shops, and small whiskey shops to decide the destinies of\r\nempires, to revel in comparative luxury, to enjoy a certain social\r\ndistinction, to exchange their native bogs for the British metropolis,\r\nand to draw a salary beyond their wildest dreams. These questionable\r\ngentlemen, with the horse's tongue and cow's tail cutters, the\r\nfirebrand priests and landlord-shooters, the moonlight marauders who\r\nshoot old women and children in the legs, burn the haystacks of their\r\nneighbours, refuse coffins and decent burial for the dead, apply the\r\nfiendish tortures of boycotting to innocent women and children,\r\nrefusing them the means of subsistence, and poisoning their water\r\nsupply with human filth--these _are_ patriots. Only their patriotism\r\nmust cost them nothing, It must be cultivated at the expense of\r\nothers. The patriots subscribe only under compulsion, and yet hope to\r\nmake a profit by the transaction. As of a certain party of old, it may\r\nbe said of them, \"License they mean when they cry Liberty.\" Plunder\r\nthey mean when they cry Patriotism. The sober and industrious portion\r\nof the Irish people, the pick of every part of Ireland, being opposed\r\nto Nationalism, are denied the virtue of patriotism. The merchants and\r\nmanufacturers of Dublin and Belfast, the leading professional men of\r\nIreland, the most learned scholars of her great University, her great\r\nsoldiers, White, Wolseley, Roberts, her greatest living authors, the\r\nwhole of her Protestant clergy of whatever sect, with their\r\ncongregations, the pith and marrow of everything that is strong,\r\nstable, cultured, enlightened, prescient, must be pronounced\r\nunpatriotic--if Nationalism is Patriotism. Contrary to all human\r\nexperience and to the course and constitution of nature, the people of\r\nEngland are asked to believe that love of their native land and desire\r\nto do the best for the commonweal, are the sole possession of the\r\nignorant and rowdy classes of Irishmen, and notwithstanding the\r\nundeniable fact that Nationalist Irishmen of every colour accuse the\r\nNationalist members of self-seeking, and of absolute indifference to\r\neverything: outside their own interests, we are asked to give to them\r\nexclusively the honour due to men who sacrifice all for their country\r\nand care for nothing but her welfare. Gladstonians themselves, in the\r\ndeepest depths of their credulity, cannot in their hearts believe in\r\nNationalist patriotism, except, perhaps, such as that of Mr. Kelly, of\r\nAthenry, who said, \"I'm a Home Ruler out and out. The counthry's\r\nwithin a stone-throw of hell, and we may as well be in it altogether.\"\r\n\r\nBirmingham, August 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 60.--LAND HUNGER: ITS CAUSE, EFFECT, AND REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Irish Nationalism is not Patriotism has been demonstrated by an\r\nappeal to admitted facts. The farmers hope to be relieved from payment\r\nof rent, the labourers hope to be employed in the mining of treasure\r\nat remunerative wages, the agitators hope for place and power, and\r\neveryone who has nothing hopes in the general confusion to make off\r\nwith something. There is, in short, a shrewd popular notion that the\r\nfoundering of the British ship of state would yield good wreckage. The\r\nfalse lights have done excellent service. Dillon, Davitt, O'Brien.\r\nHealy, and the rest of the would-be wreckers are shivering with\r\nexcitement at the prospect of the crash which they fondly believe to\r\nbe imminent. The helmsman is under their orders--will he be heaved\r\noverboard before he has done his work? If so, farewell to hope of\r\nplunder, farewell to hope of religions domination, to freehold farms\r\nfor nothing, to gold mines, to every hope that made life pleasant, to\r\nall the fatuous beliefs that are the basis of Irish Nationalism. It\r\nhas been shown that \"patriotic\" subscriptions could only be raised by\r\nthreats, that the names of non-subscribers were posted on chapel\r\ngates, that resolutions fixing the minimum were passed, with a rider\r\nto the effect that persons not subscribing would be considered \"out of\r\nsympathy,\" and that this fund was for the defence of the patriots\r\nDillon and O'Brien, who afterwards ran away. The rush of the \"patriot\"\r\ndepositors on the Post Office Savings Banks so soon as it was known\r\nthat in the event of Home Rule the floating balance would constitute\r\nthe working capital of the new Parliament, and would therefore be in\r\nthe hands of brother \"patriots,\" has been adduced as a fair measure of\r\npatriotic sincerity, and endless minor examples might have been given.\r\nWe might have mentioned Delany, the principal clothier and outfitter\r\nof intensely patriotic Limerick, who had not a yard of Irish tweed in\r\nhis stores; or the Dungannon folks, who think foul scorn of their own\r\ncoal, and persist in buying the English product at double the cost; or\r\nMr. Timony, of \"patriotic Donegal,\" might have been quoted.\r\n\"Irishmen,\" said the great draper, \"will not wear Donegal tweed. But\r\nfor England we should have no market at all.\" The patriots will not\r\n\"part.\" \"I'm sorry for you,\" said the kind old lady. \"_How much_ are\r\nyou sorry?\" said the tramp. Tried by this test, Irish patriotism comes\r\nout very small. If \"patriot\" members had to live on the voluntary\r\nofferings of their constituencies, the trade would expire of\r\ninanition. The members would return to their bogs, their tripe shops,\r\ntheir shebeens, and patriotism would become a lost art. Irishmen will\r\napplaud with enthusiasm. They like a red-hot patriotic speech. But,\r\nlike the crowd listening to the harp and fiddle at the street corner,\r\nthey begin to shuffle off when the bag comes round.\r\n\r\nIrish land hunger is easy to understand and simple to define. The bulk\r\nof the population are agricultural, and closely wedded to custom.\r\nTheir fathers lived on the land and by the land, and they expect to do\r\nlikewise. _Sæva paupertas, et avitus apto cum lare fundus._ Their\r\nideas of existence are inseparably connected with the land. Whatever\r\nknowledge they have relates to the land. Their farming skill is very\r\nlimited; indeed, it may almost be said that they have none beyond that\r\npossessed by savages--but it is their only possession. They have no\r\nturn for mechanics. The rural Irishman is uneducated, and knows little\r\nbeyond what he sees around him. So far as his experience goes, to be\r\nwithout land is to be without the one means of livelihood. The English\r\nsmall farmer is differently situated. If farming will not pay he has\r\nother resources. He can migrate to fifty towns having factories or\r\ngreat public works. And besides this, the Saxon is not crippled by an\r\nignorant conservatism and a congenital inability to adapt himself to\r\nchanged circumstances. Paddy is content with little, if he have his\r\nease. He loves to put in the seed and then to sit down and wait for\r\nthe crop, varying the proceedings with fairs and festive gatherings.\r\nSuch is his conception of life. The ding-dong regularity of factory\r\nwork does not suit him, so he clings to the land, which provides him\r\nwith a bare subsistence, and that is all he wants. No ambition to be\r\nmore luxurious than his father troubles him at all. Short spells of\r\nwork, and long spells of play, are ensured to the fortunate holder of\r\nland. This is Paddy's conception of Paradise. Suppose the land held\r\nwere at first sufficient to maintain his family. The boys grow up,\r\nand, according to custom, the paternal farm is divided, in the next\r\ngeneration again subdivided, until at last the amount of land\r\nremaining to each family is insufficient for its maintenance. Then the\r\ndistrict becomes congested. The poverty of the people is attributed to\r\nthe landlords, who are denounced as non-resident, notwithstanding the\r\ndemonstrations of an affectionate tenantry, who now and then shoot one\r\nor two, _pour encourarger les autres_. If the people have food they\r\nhave little or no money. The agitator comes and promises No Rent, the\r\nopening of gold mines and mighty factories, paying liberal wages,\r\nunder the fostering wing of an Irish Parliament. The people are\r\nignorant and credulous. They are, however, certain as to their own\r\npoverty, and they desire a change. The Roman Catholics regard\r\nthemselves as the chosen people, the true sons of the soil, but they\r\nsee that most of the great landowners are Protestant, that the\r\nProtestant farmers often hold uncommonly good land, and that if these\r\nwere once dispossessed the righteous might again flourish as green bay\r\ntrees. For while Papal Ireland is largely rock and bog, the heretical\r\nportion is reclaimed and tilled, the bogs drained, the primeval\r\nboulders rolled away, broken up, and made into fences. All this is\r\ntempting. Irish land hunger is foreshadowed in the story of Naboth and\r\nhis vineyard.\r\n\r\nAnd Irish land hunger is largely responsible for Irish rents. Friends\r\nand neighbours--aye, even relatives near as brothers and sisters,\r\ncompete against each other, and eagerly force up the price. Every\r\nIrish land agent will tell you of underhand intrigue in connection\r\nwith land. Not only do brothers secretly strive to obtain advantage\r\nover each other by means of higher bidding, but bribery is tried. Mr.\r\nRobert Hare, of the Dublin Board of Works, said:--\"My father was an\r\nagent, and on one occasion he was weighing the respective claims of\r\ntwo brothers to a piece of land which was about to become vacant and\r\nperhaps considering their respective offers, when one sent him a\r\nten-pound note. He cut it in two and returned one-half, with an\r\nintimation that on receiving a receipt he would forward the other.\" I\r\nnever met anyone in Ireland who would not readily admit that high\r\nrents were mainly due to the action of the tenants themselves, who,\r\nbeing actuated by what is called land-hunger, which is nothing more in\r\nthe majority of cases than the necessity to live, had in their\r\ndesperation bid more than the land was worth. Mr. Thomas Manley, of\r\nTrim, County Meath, said:--\"The tenant farmer has cried himself up,\r\nand the Nationalists have cried him up as the finest, most\r\nindustrious, most self-sacrificing fellow in the world. But he isn't.\r\nNot a bit of it. The landlords and their agents have over and over\r\nagain been shot for rack-renting when the rents had been forced up by\r\nsecret competition among neighbours and even relations. Ask any\r\nliving Irish farmer if I am right, and he will say, Yes, ten times\r\nyes.\" As an Irish farmer and the son of an Irish farmer, living for\r\nsixty years on Irish farms, and from his occupation as a horse-dealer,\r\nclaiming to have an intimate acquaintance with the whole of Ireland,\r\nand with almost every farmer who can breed and rear a horse, Mr.\r\nManley is worth a hearing. Continuing, in the presence of several\r\nintelligent Irishmen, some of them Home Rulers, but all agreeing with\r\nthe speaker, Mr. Manley said:--\"Rents have been forced up by people\r\ngoing behind each other's backs and offering more and more, in their\r\neagerness to acquire the holding outbidding each other. Landlords are\r\nhuman; agents, if possible, still more human. They handed over the\r\nland to the highest bidder. What more natural? The farmers offered\r\nmore than the land could pay. But why curse the landlords for what was\r\ntheir own deliberate act?\" Mr. Manley's knowledge of England enabled\r\nhim to say that \"the Irish farmer is much better off than the English,\r\nScotch, or Welsh farmer, not only in the matter of law, but also in\r\nthe matter of soil.\" The legal point is demonstrable. Let us see how\r\nthe Irish tenant stands. The disinclination of the Irish for factory\r\nwork, as exemplified in the closing of the Galway jute factory,\r\nbecause of irregularity of attendance, and the refusal of the starving\r\npeasantry of congested Donegal and Connemara to accept regular\r\nemployment in the thread factory of Dunbar, MacMaster and Co.,\r\nnotwithstanding the most tempting inducements, as set forth in my\r\nletters from Ireland, has strangled enterprise, except in the North.\r\nThe ceaseless agitation of the revolutionary party has given rise to a\r\nfeeling of insecurity which deters capitalists from investing money in\r\nIreland. And it is only fair to say that a large majority of the most\r\nintelligent men of every political colour concur in attributing much\r\nof the poverty of Ireland to unrestricted Free Trade. Thus a variety\r\nof causes have created land hunger, with its resulting land clamour,\r\nwhich has brought about extraordinary legislation--extraordinary\r\nbecause going far beyond the principles recognised by Republican\r\nAmerica, which in the first article of its Constitution draws the line\r\nthus:--\"_No State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of\r\ncontracts._\" Well might Lord Salisbury, in extending the Land Purchase\r\nAct, carefully dissociate the Conservative party from the principle of\r\ninterference with free contract in the open market. In England a thing\r\nis worth what it will fetch. It is not so in Ireland.\r\n\r\nA tenant can never be evicted unless a whole year's rent is due. The\r\nlandlord might want the land for himself or for his son, but he cannot\r\nhave it. The tenant must have six months' notice of eviction, and when\r\nactually evicted can recover possession by paying what he owes, and in\r\nthat case the landlord becomes liable to the tenant for the crops on\r\nthe land, and for the profits he (the landlord) _might_ have made. In\r\nAmerica the length of notice preceding eviction varies from three days\r\nto thirty, the latter only in the State of Maine. Yet in Ireland, where\r\nwe hear so much of brutal evictions, six months' notice is required, a\r\nyear's rent being due, this boon having been conferred by a \"Coercion\"\r\nGovernment. An Irish tenant even when voluntarily leaving his farm must\r\nbe compensated by the landlord for all improvements made by himself or\r\nhis predecessors, or must be permitted to sell his improvements to the\r\nincoming tenant. The tenant-right of a small farm is sometimes a\r\nsurprising sum. The moonlighting case I investigated at Newcastlewest,\r\nCo. Limerick, arose from a tenant-right transaction, William Quirke\r\nhaving bid £590 for the tenant-right of forty-nine acres formerly held\r\nby J. Dore who was selling, as against £400 bid by Dore's cousin.\r\nQuirke and three of his family were therefore shot in the legs, by way\r\nof impressing the advisability of joining in the Onward march to\r\nFreedom. But although the tenant is settled on the land for ever, and,\r\nso long as he owes less than a year's rent, cannot be molested, it must\r\nnot be supposed that the rent he agreed to is unchangeable. Suppose the\r\ntenant to be paying a judicial rent, which is decided by three persons,\r\none of them a lawyer, the other two acting respectively in the\r\ninterests of landlord and tenant, having examined and valued the farm.\r\nAssume that the tenant gets more than a year behindhand. The landlord\r\ndesires to evict. Even then the tenant, by applying for another \"Fair\r\nRent,\" can stay eviction. But while the rent may be lowered, the\r\nlandlord can never raise it under any circumstances. The law is\r\ndecidely one-sided. Leases may be broken. All leaseholders whose leases\r\nwould expire within ninety-nine years after the passing of the Land Act\r\nof 1887 may go to Court, have their contracts broken, and a judicial\r\nrent fixed. No countervailing advantage is given to the landlords. When\r\na tenant's valuation does not exceed £50, the Court before which\r\nproceedings are being taken for the recovery of any debt, whether for\r\nbeef, bread, groceries, clothes, or whiskey, is empowered to stay\r\neviction, can allow the debtor to pay by instalments, and can extend\r\nthe time for such payment without limit. To the average British mind\r\nthis will smack of over-legislation, and serious Irishmen make the same\r\ncomplaint. And still, to quote Father Mahony, of Cork, \"still the Irish\r\npeasant mourns, still groans beneath the cruel English yoke.\" The fact\r\nis, he is almost killed with kindness. He is weighed down by the\r\nmultitude of benefactions. He reminds you of the tame sparrow you once\r\nsuffocated by overfeeding. So much has been done for him that he\r\nnaturally expects more, and instead of being grateful he grumbles more\r\nthan ever. He regards Mr. Gladstone as having acted under compulsion,\r\nand as being an opportunist. The peasantry of Ireland have no respect\r\nfor the Grand Old Man. \"Shure, we bate the bills out iv him. Shure, he\r\nnever gave us anythin' till we kicked it out iv his skin. Divil thank\r\nhim for doin' what we ordhered him to do.\"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the Tory Land Purchase Acts are most promising in, the\r\ndirection of finality. Lord Ashbourne's Act, as it was called (1885),\r\nconferred on Irish tenants opportunities of purchasing their holdings\r\nof quite an exceptional kind, and its scope and advantages were\r\nenormously increased under the Land Purchase Act passed in 1891. If a\r\ntenant wishes to buy his holding and arranges with his landlord as to\r\nterms, he can change his position from an ordinary rentpayer into that\r\nof a payer of an annuity, terminable in forty-nine years, and actually\r\nless in amount than the rent! Most Irish landlords are willing to take\r\nless than twenty years' purchase, but the tenants are by their leaders\r\nadvised not to buy. Otherwise the Government is prepared to advance\r\nthe necessary purchase money, to be repaid at the rate of four per\r\ncent. per annum, which covers both principal and interest. Suppose the\r\ntenant's rent to be £50, and that he agreed to buy at the seventeen\r\nyears' purchase so strongly discountenanced by the priest quoted in my\r\nlast. His rent or rather the annual payment substituted for rent,\r\nwould amount to £34, being a reduction of thirty-two per cent. If he\r\nbought at fifteen years' purchase, rent £50, he would only pay £30 a\r\nyear, a reduction of forty per cent. If he bought at twenty years,\r\nrent £50, he would have £40 a year to pay, being a reduction of twenty\r\nper cent. In forty-nine years the holding would belong to him, or to\r\nhis children. In any case he must largely benefit. His rent is lower,\r\nhis share in the ownership is always becoming larger, and, if he\r\nchooses, he can at any time sell his interest in the concern. Mr.\r\nPalmer, of Tuam, said that those who had purchased under this Act were\r\nhappy and prosperous. Lord Shannon's tenants bought at twelve years'\r\npurchase. In other words they exchanged their rent for one-half the\r\namount, payable to Government, the land to be their own in forty-nine\r\nyears. Lord Lansdowne's tenants agreed to buy at eighteen years'\r\npurchase, all arrears to be forgiven on payment of half a year's rent.\r\nThese buyers are quiet and apparently contented. Their payments are\r\nregular, and if they were left alone they would doubtless continue in\r\nthe path of rectitude. But the agitators, who find nick-names for\r\neverything, have already begun to call this repayment of\r\npurchase-money a Tribute to England; and the past history of Irish\r\nleaders leads honest Irishmen, as well as Englishmen, to the\r\nconviction that, once an Irish Parliament were established, with an\r\nIrish constabulary under its rule, a No Tribute campaign would ensue,\r\nwhich would lead to deplorable results. The privileges of Irish\r\ntenants are far more numerous than I have space to indicate, but\r\nperhaps enough has been said to give a clear idea of the chief causes\r\nand effects of land hunger in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe remedy, in the opinion of many advanced and enlightened Home\r\nRulers, must come from a Tory Government. From the multitude of\r\ncounsellors I met in the thirty-two counties of Ireland, I will select\r\ntwo who represent the vast majority of able men of every political\r\nparty. Mr. Thomas Manley said:--\"Settle the land question, reform the\r\nPoor Laws and the Grand Jury laws, and reclaim the land, which would\r\npay ten per cent.\" Mr. Mason, of Mullingar, said:--\"The whole\r\nagitation would be knocked on the head by the introduction of a\r\nsevere land measure. Previous legislation has been very severe, and I\r\ndo not say that a further measure would be just and equitable. I\r\nmerely say that the people do not want Home Rule, but that they want\r\nthe advantages which they are told will accrue from Home Rule.\" And so\r\nsaid everyone.\r\n\r\nTo settle the land question is to settle everything. Religious\r\nanimosity would be silenced by self-interest. The operation of the\r\nLand Purchase Act has undoubtedly done much to turn the people using\r\nits provisions into good Conservatives--law-abiding and\r\nlaw-supporting, as having a stake in the country. The people have not\r\nthe land for nothing but they look forward to its becoming honestly\r\ntheir own, and meanwhile they enjoy the security insured by the\r\nGovernment of England. In any attempt to settle this great problem, a\r\nConservative Government would probably be largely supported by the\r\nlandlords themselves, while the rank and file of Ireland would look\r\nwith respect and confidence on any bill bearing the honoured name of\r\nBalfour. But how shall we decide the scope and character of such a\r\nfinal Land Bill? I do not hesitate to say that it must contain a very\r\nstrong infusion of the compulsory element. The great measure of 1891\r\nis generous to a fault, but it is voluntary, and the result is that\r\nthe tenants who give greatest trouble--the poor, idle, ignorant dupes\r\nof a scheming priesthood and a corrupt political conspiracy--never\r\ncome under its benefits, because they unquestioningly accept the\r\nadvice given them to wait until an Irish Parliament lets them have the\r\nland for nothing.\r\n\r\nCompulsion is not required for the landlords half so much as it is for\r\nthe tenants. The conclusion arrived at may be stated in a few words.\r\nPerhaps it may be worthy the consideration of our brilliant and\r\nfar-seeing Unionist leaders:--\r\n\r\n    The Land Purchase Act, 1891, should be amended by a Bill\r\n    providing (1) That the existing Land Commission shall be\r\n    strengthened in order to form a Court to which either Landlords\r\n    or Tenants shall have the right to apply for an order of the\r\n    Court placing them under the provisions of the Act of 1891, or\r\n    such extension of that Act as may hereafter be made. (2) It\r\n    should be the duty of the Court to inquire into the relations of\r\n    landlord and tenant, the condition of the estate and of the\r\n    tenants, and such other circumstances as may in the wisdom of the\r\n    Court seem necessary. (3) If the Court decides to issue an order,\r\n    the parties shall at once be placed in the same position as if\r\n    they had entered into a mutual agreement under the Land Purchase\r\n    Act, 1891; but it shall be the duty of the Court to fix the\r\n    number of years' purchase; and it shall have power either to\r\n    restrict or to enlarge the number of holdings over which its\r\n    order shall take effect.\r\n\r\nThis is offered as the mere germ of a suggestion. I am familiar with\r\nthe arguments that may be brought against it. For the most part they\r\ncan be urged with equal effect against the whole system of\r\ninterference with that freedom of contract which prevails in England\r\nand Scotland, but which, as I have pointed out, has already been\r\ndestroyed in Ireland. What I claim is that there _must_ be a means of\r\ndefeating such a conspiracy to make the law inoperative as that\r\npractised--to the grave detriment of Irish tenants' interests--by the\r\nomnipresent agencies of the National League, ever since the Unionist\r\nparty set itself to solve the agrarian sources of Irish discontent.\r\n\r\nBirmingham, August 14th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 61.--CLERICAL DOMINATION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who play at bowls must expect rubbers. The Roman priesthood of\r\nIreland having assumed the manipulation of Irish politics, have laid\r\nthemselves open to mundane criticism. Said Mr. Gladstone:--\"It is the\r\npeculiarity of Roman theology that by thrusting itself into the\r\ntemporal domain, it naturally, and even necessarily, comes to be a\r\nfrequent theme of political discussion.\" Priestly pretensions to\r\nauthority are without limit. The Catholic clergy of Ireland claim the\r\nright to coerce the laity in political matters, themselves remaining\r\nexempt from public criticism. They also claim to be exempt from civil\r\njurisdiction, and to have the right of overruling the law of the land,\r\nwith every moral obligation, when clashing with the interests of the\r\nChurch. They distinctly teach that every political question is a\r\nquestion of morals, and that to vote against the priest's instructions\r\nis a deadly sin. Such being a few of the claims advanced by the Irish\r\npriesthood, let us see on what rests the hope of these extraordinary\r\ndemands being recognised. A.M. Sullivan, a Roman Catholic Nationalist\r\nM.P., says:--\"Of all Catholic nations or countries in the world--the\r\nTyrol alone excepted--Ireland is perhaps the most Papal, the most\r\nultramontane. In Ireland religious conviction--what may be called\r\nactive Catholicism--marks the population, enters into their daily life\r\nand thought and action. The churches are crowded as well by men as by\r\nwomen, and in every sacrament and ceremony of their religion\r\nparticipation is extensive and earnest. Reverence for the sacerdotal\r\ncharacter is so deep and strong as to be called superstition by\r\nobservers who belong to a different faith; and devotion to the Pope,\r\nattachment to the Roman See, is probably more intense in Ireland than\r\nin any other part of the habitable globe, the Leonine city itself not\r\nexcluded.\" In other words, the Irish are more Roman than the Romans\r\nthemselves. Here we have on the one hand the claims of the Romish\r\npriesthood, and on the other the disposition of the Irish people. But\r\nas the alleged claims will to the majority of Englishmen appear\r\nmonstrous and incredible, it becomes necessary to prove that these\r\nclaims are actually made.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Parnell brought the clergy into striking prominence. The\r\npowerful personality of the Irish leader, his great popularity, and\r\nhis determination to rule alone, had to some extent forced the Church\r\ninto the background. Parnell once removed, the Church at once aimed at\r\nundivided rule, directing all her energies to this end mercilessly and\r\nwithout scruple. Her instruments were worthy of the work. The modern\r\nIrish priest is usually low-bred, vulgar, and ignorant. The priest of\r\nLever's novels, brimming over with animal spirits, full of _bonhomie_,\r\nsparkling with wit and abounding with jovial good-nature, is nowhere\r\nto be found. The men of the olden time were educated in France, and by\r\nrubbing against the cultured professors of Douai or Saint Omer, had\r\nacquired a polish, a breadth of view, a _savoir faire_, denied to the\r\nilliterate hordes of Maynooth. The olden priest was loyal, just as\r\ncultured Irishmen who have travelled, whether in America, England, or\r\nelsewhere, are loyal and averse to Home Rule. The modern priest,\r\nusually the son of an Irishman such as visits England at harvest time,\r\nbrought up amidst squalor and filth, is in full sympathy with the\r\nlimited ideas of the peasantry among whom he was reared. The\r\nconversation of his parents and associates would relate to the burden\r\nof the Saxon yoke, and his surroundings would perpetually re-echo the\r\nstories of Ireland's wrongs and woes. Any literature he might absorb\r\nwould be a priest-written history of Ireland, with the rebel doggerel\r\nof 1798 and the more seductive sedition of later years. At Maynooth he\r\nmeets a crowd of students like himself, crammed to the throat with his\r\nown prejudices, viewing everything from the same standpoint. He\r\nreturns to the people a full blown ecclesiastic, saturated with a\r\nsense of his own importance and the absolute supremacy of the Church\r\nhe represents; knowing nothing of mankind outside his own narrow\r\nsphere, profoundly ignorant of the world's political systems, and\r\nintensely inimical to England. Average Keltic priests fully bear out\r\nthe description furnished by a loyal priest of Donegal, who, on\r\nalluding to their social status and Maynooth course, said:--\"They are\r\nmerely shaved labourers, stall-fed for three years.\"\r\n\r\nAs to their exceptional claims. The attitude of omniscience and\r\nomnipotence has often been crudely stated by the Catholic hierarchy.\r\nArchbishop Walsh, of Dublin, has declared that there is no dividing\r\nline between religion and politics. Dr. Walsh has also laid down the\r\ndictum that, \"As priests and independent of all human organisations,\r\nwe have an inalienable and indisputable right to guide our people in\r\nevery proceeding where the interests of Catholics as well as the\r\ninterests of Irish nationality are involved.\" This prelate rescinded\r\nthe wholesome rule enforced by his predecessors, forbidding the clergy\r\nto take part in political demonstrations. He went further. He ordered\r\nthat at all political conventions an _ex-officio_ vote should be given\r\nto the priests. It is in view of this fact that the Unionists of\r\nIreland not unreasonably declare that under a Home Rule Bill the Roman\r\nCatholic clergy would become endowed with civil privileges which\r\nwould make them absolute rulers of Ireland. It may be urged that\r\nBishop Walsh is discredited at Rome, and that therefore his utterances\r\nmay be somewhat discounted. But what of the new Irish Cardinal,\r\nArchbishop Logue, of Armagh? He agrees with Dr. Walsh, and with\r\nreference to the Parnellite split, thus delivers himself:--\"We are\r\nface to face with a grave disobedience to ecclesiastical authority!\r\nThe doctrines of the present day are calculated to wean the people\r\nfrom the priests' advice, to separate the priests from the people, and\r\n_to let the people use their own judgment_!\" Surely nothing could be\r\nclearer or more uncompromising than this. Bishop Nulty, alluding to\r\nthe refusal of Mr. Redmond's political party to accept without\r\nquestion the political commands of the Church, thus hinted at the\r\nconsequences to recalcitrant Papists:--\"It is exclusively through us\r\nthat the clean and holy oblation of the mass is offered daily for the\r\nliving and the dead on the thousands of altars throughout our country.\r\nIt is through our ministry that the poor penitent gets forgiveness of\r\nhis sins in the Sacrament of Penance. The dying Parnellite will hardly\r\ndare to face the justice of his creator till he has been prepared and\r\nanointed by us for the last awful struggle and for the terrible\r\njudgment that will immediately follow it.\" This threat of eternal\r\ndamnation was eagerly taken up and re-echoed by the inferior clergy.\r\nFather Patrick O'Connell speaking from the altar at Ballinabrackey\r\nsaid that no Parnellite could receive the sacrament worthily, and\r\nwarned all parents against allowing their sons or daughters to attend\r\na Parnellite meeting, as it was not a merely political matter, but a\r\nmatter of their holy religion. In his sermon he referred to a meeting\r\nof the political party favoured by the Church, and said that every\r\nman, woman, and child must be present. All must assemble at the\r\nchapel, and all must be in time to walk in procession to the place of\r\nmeeting. He would be there with Father McLoughlin, and the pair would\r\ngo round to see who was absent. All absentees must let him know the\r\nreason why, and if the reason did not satisfy him he would meet them\r\nin the highways and in the byways, at the Communion rails, and would\r\n\"set fire to their heels and toes.\" He would make it hot for them.\r\nThere would be no compromise. All voters against clerical instruction\r\nhe denounced as \"infidels and heretics.\" Mr. Edward Weir, who was\r\nsuspected of having opinions of his own, was denounced in Castlejordan\r\nChapel as a 'Pigotted Guardian.' He was a member of the Poor Law\r\nBoard. He was threatened to be 'met at the communion rails,' by which\r\nhe understood that the sacrament would be refused to him. Two nights\r\nafterwards the hedge around his house was set on fire, and fire was\r\nplaced on the gate in front of it. This was a gentle hint that the\r\npeople were backing the priest, and that unless he complied his house\r\nmight be next destroyed. When Mr. Michael Saurin, J.P., a member of\r\nthe Ballinabrackey congregation, went to vote, the door of the booth\r\nwas crammed to keep him out. The crowd booed and shouted at him, and\r\nhe was spat upon. The priests were present in force. Nicholas Cooney\r\nwas also spat upon, and so was his brother, both on their clothes and\r\nin their faces. Father Woods was looking on. Matthew Brogan, who was\r\nalso thought to be against clerical dictation, was refused admission\r\nto mass; and not only poor Matthew himself, but his son,\r\ndaughter-in-law, her children, and two friends who were suspected of\r\nsympathy. The woman insisted on entering the chapel, when one of the\r\ncrowd of true believers \"near cut the hand off her.\" Michael Kenny and\r\nPeter Fagan were served with the same sauce by these enthusiastic\r\npreachers of the Onward March to Freedom, poor Fagan exhibiting the\r\ntouching devotion of the Irish peasantry by kneeling outside during\r\nthe whole of the service. Englishmen do not realise what these\r\nrefusals mean to Irish Catholics. They constitute the cruellest and\r\nmost effective coercion possible. To be refused the sacraments, to be\r\nturned away from the door of his chapel, is to the Irish peasant a\r\nturning away from the gates of Paradise, a denial of the Kingdom of\r\nHeaven, a condemnation to everlasting torment, to say nothing of the\r\naccompanying odium in which he is held by his neighbours and\r\nassociates, and the ever present dread of boycotting. Thomas Brogan\r\ndare not leave the polling-booth for his life, until Mr. Carew took\r\nhim on his car. He had been threatened by the priest, who drew a\r\ncircle round him with a walking stick, to show that he was cut off\r\nfrom his fellows, and that contamination must be feared. Patrick\r\nHogan, whose views were not in accordance with those of the priest,\r\nwas afraid to vote. He went to the booth, but feared to proceed.\r\nThomas Dunn was more plucky, but his temerity resulted in a cut face\r\nand a black eye for his wife at the hands of a patriot named James\r\nMitchell. Father McEntee tore down a party flag belonging to the\r\nstation-master of Drumree, a Parnellite, and jumped on it, in a\r\ntowering rage, saying that the owner must follow the instructions of\r\nthe Bishop. He then threw the flag into a field. Father Crinnion, of\r\nBatterstown, standing in his vestments at the altar, called out the\r\nnames of all persons supposed to be disaffected to the clerical cause,\r\nand ordered them to meet him in the vestry after mass. He asked for\r\ntheir votes, and showed a ballot paper. He had previously read in\r\nchapel the opinion of Bishop Nulty, quoted above. Father Tynan told\r\nPatrick King that unless he voted \"straight\" he would not receive the\r\nsacraments on his deathbed. The same priest told John Cowley, of\r\nKilcavan, that unless he voted for the right candidate he would be\r\nexpelled from the Church, and would be deprived of Christian burial\r\nwhen he died. Cases of this kind might be multiplied _ad infinitum_.\r\nFather Shaw, of Longwood, accentuated the horrible condition of the\r\nparty who refused to vote under his orders by asking his congregation\r\nto pray for them. Father Cassidy sailed on the same tack, and besides\r\nthanked God that the \"wrong 'uns\" were so few. Father Fay, of Cool,\r\nsaid (between the Gospels) that his political opponents should be\r\n\"treated like wild beasts,\" and that he would never forget the men who\r\nvoted against his orders. Thomas Darby was canvassed by his priest,\r\nwho, on finding that his parishioner was pledged the other way, curtly\r\nsaid, \"Then you'll go to hell,\" to which Darby replied that he would\r\nat any rate have a few companions. James Guerin has no confidence in\r\nthe secrecy of illiterate voting, for after voting in the presence of\r\na priest he had to jump a wall and hide in a wood to escape the\r\nvengeance of the people. When he came out, at ten o'clock at night, he\r\nwas stoned. Father O'Donnell, presumably in the interests of peace,\r\nadvised his congregation to take their sticks to a certain meeting,\r\nand promised to be there with his own faithful blackthorn. The peasant\r\nFagan, who said his prayers outside the chapel, was burned in effigy,\r\nbut priestly displeasure was not satisfied until his cowshed, with a\r\ncart and harness were also destroyed by fire. To have independent\r\nopinions costs something substantial in Ireland. The aspirations of a\r\nPeople and the Onward March to Freedom are not kept up for nothing.\r\nThe patriots are not afraid of their trouble. They will not spoil the\r\nUnion of Hearts for want of a little incendiarism. Now and then, but\r\nvery seldom, the priests meet their match. They presume on their\r\nspiritual immunity. The priest who refused to leave a house into which\r\nhe had intruded was threatened by Colonel Dopping with expulsion.\r\n\"Dare to touch my consecrated body,\" said the \"shaved labourer.\" \"Your\r\nconsecrated body be hanged!\" said the Colonel, and out went Father\r\nMcFadden. Father Fay, of Summerhill, said in a sermon delivered at\r\nDangan:--\"You must not look upon me as a mere man! The priest is the\r\nambassador of Jesus Christ, and not like other ambassadors either. He\r\ncarries his Lord and master about with him, and when the priest is\r\nwith the people, Almighty God is with them!\" Father Fagan, of\r\nKildalkey, was so vexed with the refusal of John Murtagh to vote\r\naccording to clerical instructions that he said:--\"May the landlords\r\ncome and hunt the whole of ye to hell's blazes.\" Murtagh said, \"Ye\r\nwish yer neighbour well, Sorr!\" The man of God threatened to kick poor\r\nMurtagh into the ditch, to which the erring parishioner replied that\r\nin that case he would kick the good shepherd like a puppy. \"Ah,\" said\r\nFather Fagan, \"you ruffian, you'll want me at the Last Day,\" and\r\nrefused to hear his wife's confession. The woman was dying, the\r\nhusband had been for the priest, and on the way to what proved a\r\ndeath-bed, Father Fagan improved the shining hour by trying to nobble\r\na straying vote. The clergy make the most of their opportunities. At\r\nBoardmills Father Skelly spread out a ballot paper on the altar at\r\nSunday service. Having described the situation of the names, he\r\npointed out where they were to make the cross. He then went on with\r\nthe mass. He thought of something else! Some of them, he hinted, were\r\npledged to the other side. They could shout for this candidate, but\r\nwhen they went to vote they must \"wink the other eye,\" as advised by\r\nthe music-hall song. Colonel Nolan, M.P., when canvasing at Headford,\r\nwas violently assaulted by a priest, who cut open the Parnellite head\r\nwith a stout blackthorn. Like a good Catholic, the Colonel would fain\r\nhave endured this clerical argument; but the police authorities\r\ninsisted on the matter seeing the light.\r\n\r\nClerical domination and the means by which it is attained are\r\ntherefore proven by undeniable evidence. The Papal hierarchy and their\r\nsubordinates are resolved to be supreme. _Aut Cæsar, aut nullus._ And\r\nit is a striking fact that by none is this doctrine so strongly\r\ndeprecated, so bitterly resented, as by the educated and enlightened\r\nportion of Roman Catholic Ireland. _Their_ aspirations are all on the\r\nside of toleration, harmony and peaceful progress. _They_ are not only\r\nlaw-abiding, but loyal, and unlike the ignorant clergy and their still\r\nmore ignorant dupes, are ever ready to join in singing \"God Save the\r\nQueen.\" From an English, even a Conservative point of view, the\r\neducated Catholics of Ireland, like all classes of English Catholics,\r\nare everything that can be desired. But what are they among so many?\r\n\r\nThe consequences of clerical domination, obtained by spiritual and\r\nphysical intimidation, are obvious enough. I have not space to show\r\nhow the system has been carried into the confessional, but numerous\r\nexamples are on record. Neither was it within the scope of this\r\narticle to prove, as could easily be done, that the clergy of Rome\r\nclaim to be above and outside the action of the statute law, and that\r\ntheir action is calculated to make the position of Protestants\r\nuntenable. The moral degradation of the people, as exemplified by\r\ntheir dread of the priest, who escorts them in hundreds to the\r\npolling-booth, and by his persistent action and untiring vigilance\r\nexploits their electoral power for his own aggrandisement, and for the\r\nacquisition of Papal supremacy in Ireland, is to Englishmen of all\r\nconsiderations the most important. Recent events have demonstrated the\r\nfact that the politics of Ireland--and therefore the politics of\r\nEngland--can be almost completely controlled for any purpose by the\r\nthirty prelates who practically command the votes of an entire people.\r\nA Roman Catholic barrister said to me:--\"I do not blame the priests\r\nfor doing the best they can for themselves. They have the power, and\r\nthey use it for their own purposes. I say they use it unfairly, and\r\nthe Meath election petition has proved that they use it illegally.\r\nThey think otherwise, but without arguing this point, I say that\r\nclerical domination will ruin the country. Irish election returns are\r\nfor the most part worthless as an expression of public opinion.\"\r\nAnother talented Irishman said:--\"The glorious British Empire is now\r\nbossed by a party of priests.\" And that this is unhappily true must be\r\nconceded by every observant and impartial Englishman.\r\n\r\nYet some there are, blind followers of the blind, obtuse to every\r\nargument, impregnable to incontrovertible facts, who have cast in\r\ntheir lot with the avowed enemies of England. They have their\r\nday--every dog has it--but their day is far spent, and their night is\r\nat hand. For England will never again submit to Romish rule. Nor will\r\nIreland when her eyes are opened.\r\n\r\nBirmingham, August 16th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 62.--CIVIL WAR A CERTAINTY OF HOME RULE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish supporters of Mr. Gladstone affect to ridicule the fears of\r\narmed and organised conflict between the rival races and religions of\r\nIreland. Their attitude in this respect is doubtless due to a slavish\r\nfollowing of their master. They keep their eye upon their figure-head.\r\nWhen it frowns they become serious. When it smiles they try to be\r\nfunny. When it assumes an aspect of virtuous indignation, the tears\r\nimmediately spring to their eyes, and they go about saying what a\r\nshame it is. They remind you of Professor Anderson and his\r\nInexhaustible Bottle. Like Paddy Byrne's barometer, they are \"stuck\r\nfast at Changeable.\" They are always on the move. Like Virgil's lady,\r\nthey are _varium et mutabile_. Like Shakespeare's gentlemen, they are\r\nDeceivers ever, One foot on shore and one foot on sea, To one thing\r\nconstant never. Every morning they nervously scan the journals to see\r\nwhat change of sentiment is required. Without this precaution they\r\nwould run the risk of meeting their political friends with the wrong\r\nfacial expression. The reason for all this is well known. Their motto\r\nis _ad exemplum regis_. To-day Mr. Gladstone believes (or says he\r\nbelieves) that if Ireland were left to herself, and the disturbing,\r\ndomineering, tyrannising influence of England were removed, the rival\r\nraces and religions would live together in perfect harmony and\r\nbrotherly love. His followers eagerly adopt this belief. But yesterday\r\nMr. Gladstone believed (or said he believed) \"That the influence of\r\nGreat Britain in every Irish difficulty is not a domineering and\r\ntyrannising, but a softening and mitigating influence, and that were\r\nIreland left to her own unaided agencies, it might be that the strife\r\nof parties would then burst forth in a form calculated to strike\r\nhorror through the land.\" His followers believed that too, and they\r\nwould believe it again to-morrow if their leader harked back. The\r\nquotation is from Hansard, and commences, \"It is my firm belief.\" What\r\ndo Mr. Gladstone's infirm beliefs resemble?\r\n\r\nPutting aside the changeable Premier, gyrating like a dancing dervish,\r\nand his Penny-in-the-slot party, let us call respectable evidence; let\r\nus hear the opinion of competent and trustworthy witnesses; let us\r\nexamine the character of the forces which will be brought into\r\nantagonism; let us observe what steps have been taken in view of\r\npossibilities more or less remote; and then let us form our own\r\nconclusions. And first as to opinions and evidence, let us hear Mr.\r\nJ.A. Froude, of all English historians the most famous expert on Irish\r\nsubjects. \"The effect of Grattan's Constitution was to stimulate\r\npolitical agitation and the conflict of the two races.\" That was a\r\nHome Rule Parliament. And again Mr. Froude says:--\"Ireland is\r\ngeographically and politically attached to this country, and cannot be\r\nallowed to leave us if she wishes. In passing over the executive power\r\nto an Irish Parliament we only increase the difficulty of retaining\r\nIreland. We shall alienate the loyal part of the population, who will\r\nregard themselves as betrayed. The necessity of reconquest will\r\nremain, but the evils of it and the bloodshed to be occasioned by it\r\nwill be infinitely enhanced. Such respect for law and order as exists\r\nin Ireland is entirely due to English authority. Remove it, and the\r\nold anarchy will and must return. If the Home Rule Bill is passed\r\nthere will be a dangerous and desperate war, in which other countries\r\nmay take part who would gladly see our power broken.\" In Mr. Froude's\r\nopinion, there would be war between England and Ireland, as well as\r\nbetween Ulster and the South. His last sentence is curiously confirmed\r\nby the _Irish Daily Independent_, which says:--\"What England forgets\r\nis the fact that when next Ireland fights she will not fight alone.\"\r\nThis is not a warning, like the prophecy of Mr. Froude, it is a\r\nthreat, for the _Independent_ is not only a Nationalist, but an\r\nintensely anti-English paper. Another great historian, Mr. Lecky, thus\r\nexpresses himself:--\"The Parliament Mr. Gladstone proposes to set up\r\nwould be in violent hostility to the richest and most industrious\r\nportion of the community. It is regarded with horror by nearly every\r\nman who is a leader of industry in Ireland. All the great names in\r\nIrish finance, manufacture, and trade are against it, and the men who\r\nwould undoubtedly lead it are men whom Mr. Gladstone not long ago\r\ndescribed with great justice as preaching the doctrine of public\r\nplunder.\" The state of feeling here indicated could have but one\r\nresult; but Mr. Lecky is still more precise. \"The assertion that Irish\r\nCatholics have never shown any jealousy of Irish Protestants is of a\r\nkind which I find it difficult to characterise with proper moderation.\r\nJealousy, unhappily, is far too feeble a word to describe adequately\r\nthe fierce reciprocal animosity which has dislocated Ireland for\r\ncenturies. It blazed into a furious flame in the religious wars of\r\nElizabeth, in the great rebellion of 1642, in the Jacobite struggle of\r\n1689, in the religious war into which the rebellion of 1798 speedily\r\ndegenerated. These facts are about as conspicuous in the history of\r\nIreland as Magna Charta and the Commonwealth in the history of\r\nEngland. No one who knows Ireland will deny that the policy of Mr.\r\nGladstone has contributed more than any other single cause to revive\r\nand deepen the divisions which every good Irishman deplores.\" Mr.\r\nLecky believes that history repeats itself, and that the establishment\r\nof an Irish Parliament would lead to a great Irish convulsion, similar\r\nto those which he refers. My experience among Irish Churchmen\r\nconvinces me that their feeling is understated in the petition signed\r\nby nearly fifteen thousand select vestrymen, and adopted by the\r\ngeneral Synod, \"That we regard the measure as fraught with peril to\r\nour civil and religious liberties, which are our prized inheritance;\r\nthat conflicts of interest and collisions of authority would create a\r\ncondition of frequent irritation and intolerable strain.\" The\r\nMethodists in full Conference gave it as their opinion \"That in the\r\njudgment of this committee the bill, if it were to become law, so far\r\nfrom being a message of peace to Ireland, would be a most fruitful\r\noccasion of distressing discord and strife; that class would be\r\narrayed against class and party against party with a virulence now\r\nrare and unknown; and that the inevitable result would be the\r\noverturning of all order and good government.\" What does this mean if\r\nnot civil war? Be it understood that the existing feeling is now being\r\ndemonstrated by appeal to the most reliable authorities, all speaking\r\nunder a due sense of responsibility, and therefore with a studied\r\nmoderation. The Presbyterians, a numerous and powerful body, speaking\r\nin the General Assembly, after declaring that the proposed measure\r\nimperils their civil and religious liberties, and expressing their\r\ndetermined opposition to an Irish Legislature and Executive,\r\ncontrolled by men \"marching through rapine to the dismemberment of the\r\nEmpire,\" whom a Special Commission found to be guilty of a criminal\r\nConspiracy, and who invented, supported, and tried to justify the Land\r\nLeague, the Plan of Campaign, and boycotting--after this preamble, the\r\nPresbyterians declare that the bill is \"calculated to embitter the\r\nhostility of conflicting creeds and parties in Ireland.\" The United\r\nPresbyterian Church of Scotland resolved at a meeting of its Irish\r\nPresbytery \"that Home Rule would greatly intensify the antagonism now\r\nexisting between the two peoples inhabiting Ireland.\" The Quakers come\r\nout pretty strong. They first ask to be believed. They hope that\r\nEnglishmen will give credence to the sincerity of their convictions\r\nand the disinterestedness of their motives, and then they say that\r\nHome Rule \"cannot fail to be disastrous to Ireland, and must tend to\r\nperpetuate and intensify the strife and discord which we have so long\r\nlamented and which we earnestly desire, so far as in us lies, to\r\nmitigate and allay.\" These protests are not all from Ulster. Every\r\nGrand Jury in Ireland has expressed itself in similar terms. The\r\nleading mercantile men of the three southern provinces of Ireland have\r\ndeclared in writing that \"the Bill of the Government throws amongst us\r\na new apple of discord, and plunges Ireland again into a state of\r\npolitical and party ferment.\" Pages of quotation might be added. But\r\nif those already adduced are not sufficient to satisfy my readers as\r\nto the feeling of the Irish Unionist party, they would hardly be\r\npersuaded though one rose from the dead.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of the other party is still stronger, and has been so\r\noften and openly expressed as to stand in no need of proof. Mr. Dillon\r\nhas threatened to \"manage Ulster;\" and others have over and over again\r\ndeclared that the Protestant settlers are not Irishmen, and therefore\r\nhave no right in the country. The lower classes of Irish Nationalists\r\nregard an Irish Legislature as an instrument to secure ascendency and\r\nplunder. The ruling idea is loot. The Unionists are determined at all\r\ncosts to maintain religious equality and to hold their own. In Ulster\r\nmasters and men, landlords and tenants, are of one mind. They do not\r\nbluster and brag. Those who represent them as rowdies do them\r\ngrievous wrong. They are sober, thrifty, industrious, pious. In\r\ncharacter they resemble Cromwell's Puritans, or the Scottish\r\nCovenanters of old, and no wonder, for they are of the same stock.\r\nThey are by nature kindly and peaceful, but they become dangerous\r\nindeed on the points of liberty, religion, and property. We can partly\r\njudge their future by their past. In the dark and troublous days of\r\nrebellion they held the country for England, established a police, did\r\nfor Ireland all that Government neglected to do, and then, having\r\nrestored order, the small but mighty minority threw aside their arms\r\nand went back to their work. They are before everything industrial.\r\nWars and rumours of wars they detest, as injurious to trade, as well\r\nas to higher interests. But when they take off their coats they always\r\nwin. They put into their efforts, whether in war or peace, such a\r\nstrenuous determination, such an unwavering resolution to succeed,\r\nthat they become invincible. They have the confidence inspired by\r\ninvariable success. Their opponents have the flabbiness and the lack\r\nof self-reliance resulting from seven hundred years of whining and\r\nquerulous complaint. If Mr. Gladstone were to offer complete\r\nseparation to-morrow the Irish leaders dare not take it. They know\r\nwhat would happen if Ulster took the field. Spite of their boasting,\r\nDillon & Co. know full well that their vaunted numbers would avail\r\nthem naught.\r\n\r\nThe venerable William Arthur, a Nonconformist minister, says:--\"We\r\nwill not be put under a Parliament in Dublin. The Imperial franchise\r\nand all which that guarantees is our birthright. No man shall take it\r\nfrom us. We will never sell it. If Englishmen and Scotchmen will not\r\nlet us live and die in the freedom we were born to, they will have to\r\ncome and kill us. On that ground stands the strongest party in\r\nIreland. For as sure as the Home Rule party is the larger, so surely\r\nis the Unionist party the stronger. Ask any military man who has spent\r\na few years in the country. Settle the Irish question by putting the\r\nstronger party under the weaker! You would only change a count of\r\nheads into a trial of strength. Instead of the polling-booth, where\r\nnothing counts but heads, you would set for the two parties another\r\ntrysting place. There brains count, education counts, purses count,\r\nhabits of hard work count, habits of command and habits of obedience\r\ncount, habits of success count, delight in overcoming difficulties\r\ncount, northern tenacity counts, and there are other things which I do\r\nnot mention that would count. Let not the two parties be summoned to\r\nthat trysting place!\"\r\n\r\nDuring my visit to Belfast I had exceptional opportunities of\r\nascertaining the probabilities of armed resistance to the authority of\r\na Dublin Parliament. I visited what might fairly be called the Ulster\r\nWar Department, and there saw regular preparation for an open\r\ncampaign, the arrangements being under the most able and expert\r\nsuperintendence. The tables were covered with documents connected with\r\nthe sale and purchase of rifles and munitions of war. One of them set\r\nforth the particulars of a German offer of two hundred and forty-five\r\nthousand Mauser rifles, the arm lately discarded by the Prussian\r\nGovernment, with fifty million cartridges. As I had frequent\r\nopportunities of observing the manufacture of a hundred and fifty\r\nthousand of these weapons by the National Arms and Ammunition Company\r\nof Sparkbrook, I noted the present quotation, which was 16s. each, the\r\ncartridges to be thrown in for nothing. Another offer referred to a\r\nhundred and forty-nine thousand stand of arms with thirty million\r\ncartridges. There were numerous offers from Birmingham, and a large\r\nconsignment of rifles and bayonets were about to be delivered in\r\nIreland, the entire freight of a small steamer, at a place which I was\r\nthen forbidden to mention, but which I may now say was Portaferry. An\r\nenormous correspondence was submitted to me in confidence, and I was\r\nsurprised to see how deep and sincere was the sympathy of the working\r\nmen of England, who with gentlemen of position and influence, and\r\nrifle volunteers by thousands were offering their aid in the field\r\nshould the bill become law. I saw a letter from a distinguished\r\nEnglish soldier with an offer of five hundred pounds and two hundred\r\nmen. Money was coming in plentifully, and all the correspondence was\r\nunsought. The office had over fifty thousand pounds in hand, and\r\npromises for more than half a million. The forces at that moment,\r\norganised and drilled, numbered 164,614, all duly enrolled and pledged\r\nto act together anywhere and at any time, many of them already well\r\narmed, and the remainder about to be furnished with modern weapons.\r\nThe Government was becoming nervous. An order from headquarters\r\nrequired a complete survey of the three barracks of Belfast, with an\r\nexhaustive report as to their defensive capabilities. Plans of\r\nexisting musketry loopholes were to be made, and commanding officers\r\nwere to state if it would be advisable to add to them. Suggestions\r\nwere invited, and Mr. Morley, who at that very moment was telling\r\nParliament that no precautions were being taken, wanted to know if the\r\nsaid barracks could be held against an organised force of civilians,\r\narriving unexpectedly, and when Tommy Atkins was taking his walks\r\nabroad. At the same time, military officers were being secretly sworn\r\nin as magistrates. Does this look like the fear of civil war? These\r\nstatements, made in the _Gazette_ five months ago, have not been\r\ncontradicted. The rank and file of the English Home Rule party know\r\nnothing of this--and by what their priestly allies would call\r\n\"invincible ignorance\" they may be excused their inability to believe\r\nin stern resistance to anything. The party of surrender are totally\r\nincapable of understanding that men exist who would lay down their\r\nlives for a principle. Mr. Gladstone and his Items, like the Irish\r\nleaders and their dupes, are easily overmastered. You have only to\r\nstand up to them, and they curl up like mongrel curs. But for this\r\nfact were would be no Home Rule Bill. Of the two parties the Irish\r\nwere the stoutest, and the weakest went to the wall. The English Home\r\nRulers cannot conceive that their conquerors could be easily beaten,\r\nor even that men can be found to meet them on the field. On the\r\ncontrary, the men of Ulster who know these heroes hold them in deepest\r\ncontempt, and in the event of an appeal to arms would treat them as so\r\nmany mice. Spite of their Army of Independence, the Nationalists\r\ntacitly admit this, and would defer separation until they have first\r\nby legislative enactments driven away \"the English garrison,\" or\r\ncompelled Ulster in self-defence to declare against English rule. And,\r\nstrange to say, they propose to use to this end the force of English\r\narms. They calculate on the resistance of Ulster as a measure of\r\nassistance to their own ultimate purposes. \"All we have to do is to\r\nstand by while British soldiers shoot them down like dogs.\" That is\r\ntheir expectation, as expressed by one of themselves. Their plans are\r\nwell hid. But \"The best-laid schemes o' mice and men Gang aft agley,\"\r\nas the priest-governed schemers may find to their cost.\r\n\r\nA second and more recent sojourn in Ulster deepened the impression\r\ngiven by my first visit. Throughout the province the feeling is still\r\nthe same--an immovable determination to resist at all hazards the\r\nimposts of a Dublin Parliament. They will have no acts or part in it.\r\nThey will send no members, they will pay no taxes, they will not\r\naccord to it one jot or tittle of authority. They will offer armed\r\nresistance to any force of police or Sheriff's officers acting under\r\nwarrants issued by the College Green legislators. Resistance to the\r\nQueen's authority they regard as altogether out of the question. But\r\nit remains to be seen whether British troops will \"shoot them down\r\nlike dogs.\" The Ulstermen think not, and they have good reasons for\r\nthis opinion. The mere threat of Home Rule in 1886 cost forty lives in\r\nthe streets of Belfast alone. Who can say what would be the results of\r\nthe bill becoming law? Surely every reliable test points in one\r\ndirection. The Gladstonian party, without a shadow of reason, have\r\naffected to doubt the courage and resolution of the Northerners, but\r\nthe breed of the men and their long history are a sufficient answer to\r\nthese cavillers. True it is that their courage has not been\r\ndemonstrated by murder, by shooting from behind a wall, or the\r\nbattering out of a policeman's brains, a hundred against one, or the\r\ndischarging of snipe-shot into the legs of old women and young\r\nchildren, after the fashion so popular with the party with whom Mr.\r\nGladstone and his heterogeneous crew are now acting. But for all that,\r\nthe pluck and tenacity of Ulstermen are undeniable. Their cause is\r\ngood, and left to themselves they would win hands down.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore demonstrated by a consensus of the weightiest\r\nauthorities and by the results of personal investigation that not only\r\nwould civil war between Irish parties be the inevitable result of Home\r\nRule, but that there would also be war between Ireland and England;\r\nthat Irish Unionists are determined to resist to the last, and that\r\nthey possess the means of resistance. They are touched on the\r\nsubjects they hold most sacred--religion, freedom, property; and\r\ndespite the assurances of Mr. Gladstone, who desires to judge the\r\nNationalist party by their future, the keen Ulstermen prefer to judge\r\nthem by their past. And bearing these things in mind, it is not\r\nunreasonable to say that Englishmen who support the present policy of\r\nthe Separatist party are at once enemies of Ireland and traitors to\r\ntheir native land.\r\n\r\nAnd now my task as your Special Commissioner in Ireland is at an end.\r\nWithout fear or favour I have described the country as I found it, and\r\nhave exposed the character and the motives of the men to whom Mr.\r\nGladstone would entrust its future government. I was no bigoted\r\npartisan when my task began, but in a period of six months I have\r\ntraversed the country from end to end, and at every step my first\r\nimpressions have been deepened. It would be a folly--yea, it would be\r\na crime--to withdraw from Ireland that mitigating influence of British\r\nrule which alone prevents a lovely island becoming the foul and\r\nblood-stained arena of remorseless sectarian strife.\r\n\r\nBirmingham, August 18th.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nACHIL ISLANDS, 244.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE, Mr. Balfour's aids to, 179 and 370.\r\n\r\n\"ALL YOU WANT,\" an Irish Programme, 331.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN Tourist's Opinion, 7 and 31;\r\n  Help for Ireland, 329.\r\n\r\nARAN ISLANDS, 156.\r\n\r\nARMAGH, 291.\r\n\r\nASHBOURNE ACT, Happy results of, 133.\r\n\r\nATHENRY, 177.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALFOUR, Right Hon.
