JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe basis of most of these chapters is composed of letters contributed\r\nduring the current year to the _Morning Post_, by whose kind permission\r\nthey are here republished. They reflect the fleeting ideas, the passing\r\nmoods of the moment; but as the various moments of which they reflect\r\nsome kind of image form part of what must constitute an eventful chapter\r\nof Russian history, I have thought that it would be worth while to\r\nrepublish them, so as to furnish some kind of record of what people were\r\nthinking and saying while the interesting things—which history will\r\nrelate—were happening, and so as to give a few sidelights showing the\r\nattitude of “the man in the street,” during the hours of crisis. Such\r\nsidelights tend to show how little even the greatest crises in the lives\r\nof States affect the daily life of the average man. The people who cry\r\nout that the state of things is intolerable and not to be borne are, for\r\nthe most part, well-to-do people who work up their indignation towards\r\nthe end of a good dinner. The people who to the far-off looker-on seem\r\nto be undergoing intolerable oppression are themselves lookers-on, and\r\nthey scarcely look, hardly realise and seldom say anything.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured in these chapters to present impartially the widely\r\ndivergent points of view of various people; at the same time I have made\r\nno attempt to disguise the whereabouts of my sympathies, being mindful\r\nof the sage, who, as Renan translates him, says: “Ne sois pas trop\r\njuste, et n’affecte pas trop de sagesse de peur d’être un niais.”\r\n\r\nThese sidelights being the reflections of fugitive phases, I have made\r\nno attempt to introduce an element of consistency into them, nor have I\r\nin the light of subsequent events tried to modify the effect of the\r\nhopes which proved to be illusory or of the fears which were\r\ngroundless—hopes and fears which I myself shared with those by whom I\r\nheard them expressed.\r\n\r\nTo those who take a serious interest in the Russian evolution I would\r\nsuggest two valuable books, “The Crisis in Russia,” by Professor\r\nMilioukov (London: Fisher Unwin, 1905), and “La Crise Russe,” by Maxime\r\nKovalevsky (Paris: Giard & E. Brière, 16, Rue Souflot, 1906).\r\n\r\n“Modern Customs and Ancient Laws of Russia,” by the same author (Nutt,\r\n1891), will be useful to the student of the past history of Russia. Nor\r\ncan one too often recommend “L’Empire des Tsars,” by M. Leroy-Beaulieu.\r\nSir Donald Mackenzie Wallace’s work on Russia needs no recommendation.\r\nAll these books, which deal with the past of Russia, will help the\r\nstudent to understand what is happening at present; for without some\r\nknowledge of the past history of Russia, what is now taking place cannot\r\nbut be incomprehensible.\r\n\r\n  ST.

It lays no claim to\r\nbe either exhaustive or even of any practical use to the serious student\r\nof the Russian Evolution. It is written for the ignorant, and with the\r\nobject of helping them to decide whether they wish to take an interest\r\nin what is now happening in Russia, or not. I cannot take them into the\r\nhouse and show them all over it from floor to ceiling with the knowledge\r\nand authority of a master-builder; all I can do is to open a small\r\nwindow and ask them to look through it and observe certain things,\r\npointing out how far these things are typical of the whole; and my hope\r\nis that the glimpses I have given them will enable them to decide\r\nwhether they wish to go and knock at the front door and investigate for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThis book consists solely of a record of things I have seen and heard\r\nmyself in Russia during an interesting year of the history of that\r\ncountry. My experience of English opinion on Russian things has\r\nconvinced me that in order to make such a record as intelligible as\r\npossible, a great deal of introduction and explanation would be\r\nnecessary. The reason of this is that the ignorance in England about\r\nRussia is extraordinary; and most of the current literature—I mean the\r\nbooks published on Russian affairs—instead of dispelling that ignorance,\r\nsucceed rather in increasing it. Russia and Russian affairs are so\r\nlittle known in England that the country has proved a happy hunting\r\nground for sensational writers of fiction and still more sensational\r\npurveyors of facts. Leaving the writers of fiction out of the question,\r\nthe chief bar which seems to separate writers about Russia from a just\r\nestimate and a valuable appreciation of that country is the language. It\r\nis possible to convey information about Russia if you are ignorant of\r\nthe Russian language; and such information may prove to be not only\r\nuseful, but of surprising interest to people who are totally ignorant of\r\nthe country. But unless you are acquainted with the Russian language it\r\nis impossible to acquire an intimate knowledge of the Russian people,\r\nand it is difficult to understand many things which happen in Russia.\r\n\r\nI had, therefore, the intention, before proceeding to a record of any\r\nthings I had seen myself, to collect and convey the impressions I had\r\nreceived of the Russian character and of Russian life in various\r\nclasses, correcting and illustrating my impressions by those of others\r\nwho have worked in the same field, and by evidence drawn from Russian\r\nliterature. I meant to try and illustrate books by examples taken from\r\nlife, and throw light on events and people by examples taken from\r\nliterature; but I found when I began to do this that the writing of such\r\nan introduction was equivalent to the writing of two large books, one on\r\nthe Russian people and one on Russian literature, a task which I still\r\nhope to accomplish some day, but for which I do not at present feel\r\nsufficiently equipped. Moreover, even were I sufficiently equipped, the\r\nwriting of two such books cannot be accomplished in a hurry in a country\r\nwhich is in a state of political effervescence. I have therefore sadly\r\nresigned myself to work backwards, and give to the public my record of\r\nraw facts first and the explanation at a later date.\r\n\r\nNevertheless in giving this collection of scraps to the public I still\r\nhave an aim and a purpose. As I have said, Englishmen are amazingly\r\nignorant of Russia; not only because they deliberately prefer the works\r\nof sensation-mongers to those of really well-informed writers like Sir\r\nD. M. Wallace or M. Leroy-Beaulieu, but also because, when they honestly\r\nseek for truth in the newspapers which are by way of being serious, they\r\nare almost invariably misled. On the other hand Englishmen who live in\r\nRussia, even if only for a short period—such as officers from the Indian\r\nArmy who come out on leave to learn the language—find no difficulty in\r\nforming a just appreciation of the country and its people. It has always\r\nstruck me that if any such person were to write a record of what he saw\r\nand thought, that record would have a real value because it would\r\nconstitute an aspect of the truth and not an aspect of the lie. This is\r\ntherefore my aim, and it is the only merit I claim for this work. It\r\ncontains aspects of things, seen by some one whose object was to try and\r\nunderstand the ordinary and not to invent the extraordinary. And\r\ntherefore, although my work has no sort of claim to be taken seriously,\r\neither as history, or as a manual of useful information, it will have\r\nthe negative merit of being free from any attempt at sensationalism,\r\nand, I hope, the positive merit of containing some aspects of the truth,\r\nsome unvarnished record of _la chose vue_.\r\n\r\nIf what I have written leads others to take an interest in Russia and to\r\ngo and see for themselves, and to treat exhaustively in a masterly\r\nfashion the things at which I have hinted incompletely and haltingly, I\r\nshall feel amply rewarded.\r\n\r\nSomebody might object that even if we are totally ignorant of Russia in\r\nEngland there is no great harm done, that Russia is a far-off country\r\nwith an impossibly difficult language; why should we bother about it? To\r\nthis I would reply that the British people have shown themselves to be\r\ngravely concerned about the increasing competition with which the\r\nEnglishman has to contend in all branches of life, and at the alarming\r\nimprovement in the methods of his neighbours, which is met by no similar\r\nimprovement at home. British trade, British influence, are rapidly, it\r\nis said, being outstripped. Remedies, such as protection, are suggested.\r\nAs to whether such a remedy would prove efficacious or not I have no\r\nidea; but one practical reason of our stagnation in certain matters\r\ncannot fail to strike the most indolent observer. Our neighbours are\r\nwell and practically educated. We are not. Is not this fact the cause of\r\na great many things? If we want to remedy an evil we must look for the\r\ncause. I firmly believe that the unpractical education which is given to\r\nso many of us is largely responsible for the comparative stagnation of\r\nEnglishmen in matters of trade and enterprise, compared with the\r\nsedulous efforts of the citizens of other countries. I am not advocating\r\nthe introduction of a purely continental system of education, nor would\r\nI like to see our system of athletics disappear; but it is obvious that\r\nthere is not and never will be any danger of either of these two things\r\nhappening. But I never mean to lose an opportunity of advocating a\r\nradical reform in the old-fashioned strictly classical education given\r\nand received at our public schools and rendered necessary by the\r\nobstinacy of our universities, owing to which Greek and Latin are taught\r\n(but no longer learned except by a slender minority), to the exclusion\r\nof all other useful knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe mass of boys who now learn nothing because Greek and Latin mean\r\nnothing to them, would gladly assimilate something which would be useful\r\nto them in after life: for instance, some smattering of their own\r\nhistory, some mastery of the English tongue, or the knowledge of a\r\nmodern language.\r\n\r\nThere is no country where the disadvantage at which an Englishman finds\r\nhimself compared to his continental rivals is made so plain as in\r\nRussia. In Russia there is, and there will be even more in the future,\r\nan immense field for foreign enterprise. The Germans have taken, are\r\ntaking, and will take the utmost advantage of this fact. The English are\r\ncontent to send advertisements here, written in the English language,\r\nand never dream of trying to learn Russian themselves.\r\n\r\nA working knowledge of the Russian language is acquired here by the\r\naverage British officer, working for an examination, in the course of\r\nsix months. Therefore this difficulty, though serious, is not\r\ninsurmountable. This, then, is the practical reason which I advance for\r\nthe furthering of knowledge about Russia. I say that such knowledge is\r\nuseful and advantageous to Englishmen. I have another reason for wishing\r\nsuch knowledge to be propagated, which is personal and moral, but not\r\nsentimental. It is this. I confess that I entertain perhaps a foolish\r\ndesire for goodwill among nations. Of course I know very well that\r\nrivalries and conflicts must exist. Sometimes such rivalries and\r\nconflicts are the result of a fundamental antagonism and of the struggle\r\nfor existence. But sometimes they are merely the outcome of\r\nmisunderstanding and prejudice.\r\n\r\nOne of the wickedest things which shelters itself under the holy name of\r\npatriotism is the spirit which stirs up such prejudice and incites one\r\ncountry against another groundlessly by playing on ignorance and popular\r\npassion. With regard to Russia this has been done with considerable\r\nsuccess. So far from considering such action to be patriotic, I consider\r\nit to be criminal; and although it may not be of the slightest interest\r\nto any one to hear this opinion expressed, to express it is a pleasure\r\nwhich I cannot deny myself. Whatever faults this book may contain, I\r\nmean to make up for the disappointments which it has caused me by\r\nindulging to the full in the luxury of saying exactly what I think in\r\nits pages. I cannot, unfortunately, hope to be among those masters who,\r\nspeaking with inspired authority and unerring skill, compel the crowd to\r\nlisten to their message, and at the sound of whose clarion-like\r\nutterance the “forts of folly” fall to the ground like the walls of\r\nJericho. Mine is a humbler task, a more inglorious ambition. I hope to\r\nbe like an obscure mouse who nibbles in the darkness at the net which\r\nholds the lion captive. The mouse in his lifelong effort succeeds\r\nperhaps only in gnawing away a little; and I shall be content if I\r\nsucceed in nibbling through the most tenuous thread of this great net of\r\nerror, misunderstanding, and falsehood. There are other mice who will\r\ncome after me, and who knows? perhaps one day the lion will be set free.\r\n\r\nFinally, if it be asked from what point of view I approach my study of\r\nRussia, I would answer that I have no political views whatever in the\r\nmatter; I have tried to make it my business to discover, understand, and\r\nexplain the points of view of the people with whom I have met; with some\r\nof these views I sympathise, with others I do not. I have already said\r\nthat I have not disguised my sympathies, but I have attempted to\r\nunderstand even what repelled me; my attitude is that of a sympathetic\r\nfriend, for whether the Frenchman who said “L’intelligence est presque\r\ntoujours la sympathie” was right or wrong, I am convinced that the\r\nconverse is true, and that the spirit of carping is nearly related to\r\nstupidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A YEAR IN RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n                      ST. PETERSBURG TO GODZIADAN\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _August 8, 1905._\r\n\r\nI left St. Petersburg this evening for Manchuria. The one absorbing\r\ndiscussion in St. Petersburg is the question of the peace negotiations.\r\nWill there be peace or not?\r\n\r\n\r\n                  IN THE TRAIN ON THE WAY TO IRKUTSK,\r\n\r\n                                                          _August 11th_.\r\n\r\nI started for Irkutsk on the 9th from Moscow. The train is crowded with\r\npeople—officers going to the war, men of business going to Siberia,\r\nwomen and children. It is exceedingly hot. The last time I travelled in\r\nthis Trans-Siberian express the winter had just given way to the\r\nleafless and bare aspect of early spring. Now we travel through great\r\nstretches of green plains, past huge fir-woods which are burnt and\r\nbrowned by the heat. The topic of the peace negotiations continues to\r\nprevail above all other topics. I am constantly asked my opinion. We\r\nhave just received the latest telegrams from Portsmouth. A man of\r\nbusiness asked me if I thought there would be peace. I said “Yes.”\r\n“There won’t be,” he replied. The railway line is fringed all the way\r\nwith pink flowers, which, not being a botanist, I take to be ragged\r\nrobin. At night the full moon shines spectral and large over the dark\r\ntrees and marshes, and every now and then over stretches of shining\r\nwater. The officers discuss the war from morning till night. They abuse\r\ntheir generals mercilessly. They say that it is impossible for Russians\r\nto look foreigners in the face. In my compartment there is an army\r\ndoctor. He assisted at the battle of Mukden and is now returning for the\r\nsecond time to the war. He tells me that he wrote a diary of his\r\nexperiences during the battle and that he is unable to re-read it now,\r\nso poignantly painful is the record. He trusts there will not be peace.\r\nHe is sanguine as to the future. He loathes the liberal tendencies in\r\nRussia and detests Maxim Gorki. Yet he is no Jingo.\r\n\r\nA gentleman from Moscow, and his wife, on the contrary, inveigh bitterly\r\nagainst the Government and the war. (I saw these same people again at\r\nMoscow after the December rising. Their house was situated in a street\r\nwhere the firing had been heavy and abundant. They had had enough of\r\nrevolution and blamed the revolutionaries as severely then as they now\r\nblamed the Government.) We constantly pass trains full of troops going\r\nto the war. The men all ask the same question: “When is peace going to\r\nbe?” They ask for newspapers and cigarettes. I gave some of them some\r\nbottles of whisky, which they drank off then and there out of the\r\nbottle. An amusing incident happened last evening. We had stopped at a\r\nsiding. Everybody had got out of the train. I was walking up and down\r\nthe platform with one of the passengers. We saw a soldier throwing big\r\nstones at the window of the washing compartment.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing that for?” we asked.\r\n\r\n“I want to speak to his Honour,” the soldier said; “he is washing his\r\nface in the washing-room.” And through the window of the compartment,\r\nlit by electric light, we could see the silhouette of an officer washing\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you go and knock at the door?” we asked.\r\n\r\n“They are” (to speak of a person in the third person plural is\r\nrespectful in Russian, and is always done by inferiors of their\r\nsuperiors)—“they are ‘having taken drink’ (_Oni Vipimshi_),” he replied,\r\nand then he added, lest we should receive a false impression, “His\r\nHonour is very good.”\r\n\r\nAs we passed train after train of troops I reflected on the rashness of\r\nprophecy. How often I had heard it said in London, when the war broke\r\nout, that the line would break down immediately. Even when I reached\r\nMukden I heard people say that the line could not possibly last through\r\nthe summer, and here it is supporting gaily train after train in the\r\nsecond year of the war.\r\n\r\n                                     ON THE WAY TO CHITA, _August 20th_.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Irkutsk on the morning of the 17th and took the train for\r\nBaikal. At Irkutsk station there was a train of sick soldiers returning\r\nfrom the war. They begged for newspapers. The tedium of their long\r\njourney is, they say, intolerable. They say there has been a good deal\r\nof typhus in Manchuria.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the lake in the steamer. Its summer aspect is far less\r\nstriking than the strange glory which it wears when it is frozen, and\r\nthe distant mountains seem like “a sunny pleasure dome with caves of\r\nice.” In summer the waters are blue, the nearer hills grey and the\r\ndistant mountains blue, but with nothing strange or unreal about them.\r\nYet when the sunset silvered the grey tints and spread a ragged golden\r\nbanner in the sky, the lake was extremely beautiful in another way. At\r\nBaikal station there was the usual struggle for places in the train. How\r\nwell I remembered the desperate struggle I had gone through to get a\r\nseat in a third-class carriage at this same place last year! This time\r\nit was in the first-class carriage that the conflict took place. An\r\nengineer got into the same carriage as I did. He occupied one of the\r\nlower berths and I the other. Presently a lady arrived, bound for Chita,\r\nand looking for a place. She came into our carriage and asked to be\r\nallowed to have one of the lower berths. The engineer flatly refused and\r\nsaid that he had occupied his seat and had a right to keep it. I told\r\nher I would let her have mine with pleasure. She occupied it and went\r\nout. I moved my things into the upper berth. “Why on earth did you give\r\nup your seat?” the engineer asked. “You had a _right_ to keep it.” When\r\nthe lady came back she said to me: “Ah! you are evidently not a Russian;\r\nno Russian would have given up his place.” The engineer turned out to be\r\nquite a good-natured sort of person, but there is something about trains\r\nwhich makes people who are by nature mild and good-natured turn into\r\nsavages, and instils into them a passionate determination to cleave to\r\ntheir rights. The next morning another man arrived in our carriage, with\r\na large basket and a second-class ticket. This upset the engineer, who\r\ncomplained to the “Controller” of the train, and the poor man was turned\r\nout. The engineer snorted and said: “There’s an insolent fellow for\r\nyou.” The lady was the wife of an engineer who was employed at Chita;\r\nand she told me much about life in Chita: how hard times were, owing to\r\nthe war, how scarce food was getting—\r\n\r\n                     “Und wie so teuer der Kaffee,\r\n                     Und wie so rar das Geld!”\r\n\r\nThe “Controller” of the train, an official in plain clothes, whose exact\r\nduties I was not able to determine, except that he was able to turn the\r\nsecond-class passenger out of our carriage, spent a day and a night with\r\nus. He and the engineer talked without ceasing of the meetings of the\r\nZemstva all over the country; of the discontent of the public servants\r\nand of the imminence of a strike. They told me there would be a big\r\nrailway strike, but I did not pay much attention to this, nor did I in\r\nthe least realise the importance of what they were discussing. In one of\r\nthe second-class carriages I made friends with two young officers who\r\nwere going out to the war as volunteers, and two ladies, one the wife of\r\nan officer already out there, and the other a hospital nurse. With them\r\nalso was the son of the officer’s wife, a student from Odessa, who told\r\nme many interesting things. He described to me in great detail the\r\nmutiny of the Black Sea Fleet, and he prophesied, if not a revolution,\r\nat least a great change in Russia in the immediate future. One of the\r\ncarriages of the train was barred, and in it sat a political prisoner, a\r\nschoolmaster from Irkutsk. Some of my friends went to speak to him, but\r\nthey came back in melancholy and disappointment, since they said this\r\nprisoner was hissing hatred and rage through the bars in an undignified\r\nand painful manner.\r\n\r\nSoon after we left Baikal a young man joined us who said he was employed\r\nin a firm at Chita. He had brought with him some flowers from Irkutsk.\r\nThese he carried in a large basket full of wet sand. They were a kind of\r\npathetic stock but not “in fragrant blow”; poor, feeble, starved and\r\nrather dirty flowers they were. But in Transbaikalia flowers were rare,\r\nand he had paid 18 roubles, he said (£1 8s.), for this nosegay, and he\r\nwas bringing them to Chita as a gift to the girl to whom he was engaged\r\nto be married. He looked after these flowers with the utmost care; the\r\nbasket was put in my berth and, as it was full of water, a constant\r\nstream trickled down from it and made a small pond on the floor of the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n                                                   _August 20th. Later._\r\n\r\nWe are nearing Chita; the husband of the lady to whom I gave my place\r\nhas arrived to meet her and take her home. He is an engineer. They are\r\ndeeply engaged in discussing local politics. The husband talks of a\r\ncoming strike, and tells me that if I wish to see political meetings I\r\nhad better stay in Chita. There are meetings every evening; some of them\r\nare dispersed by the police. I now realise the importance of flowers in\r\nthis country; it is “a land of sand and ruin and gold.” The young clerk\r\nhas produced two perforated bouquetholders (is there such a word?) and\r\nhas carefully placed the flowers in them, with a sigh of relief. They\r\nhave not quite faded, although they droop sadly. At Chita the lady and\r\nher husband get out. The engineer also. I am now alone in my carriage.\r\nBeyond Chita the country is mountainous and fledged with fir-trees.\r\n\r\n                                                          _August 21st._\r\n\r\nThe hilly country has ceased and we have once more reached the flat\r\nplains. This morning the guard brought a man into my carriage and asked\r\nme if I minded his sitting there. I said I did not mind. I offered him\r\nsome tea. The man made no answer, and looked at me with a vacant stare.\r\nThen the guard laid him down at full length, and said, “This man is the\r\nassistant station-master at Manchuria station. He is drunk, but you need\r\nnot be alarmed; he will be quite quiet.” He was quiet; at Manchuria\r\nstation he woke up from his stupor automatically, as though from\r\nfrequent habit.\r\n\r\n                                                          _August 22nd._\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Manchuria station last night. The chaos that always reigns\r\nthere is terrific. I had the utmost difficulty in obtaining permission\r\nto continue my journey. The officials said I needed an extra paper,\r\nbesides those I had with me, from the Chief of the Staff in Kharbin. The\r\ninitial difficulty was to get one’s ticket, as the crowd was dense and\r\nlong. What quantities of people seem to be drawn to Manchuria, like\r\nfilings to a magnet! An officer got me my ticket, and just when I had\r\nutterly despaired of being able to travel further, the gendarme brought\r\nme my permission to proceed. Then came the struggle for a place in a\r\nthird-class carriage. This was successfully got through. I obtained an\r\nupper berth across the window. The compartment is crammed with people.\r\n\r\n                                                          _August 23rd._\r\n\r\nWe are travelling through the hills of northern Manchuria. News has\r\narrived of the summoning of a new Duma. Now people say there will not be\r\npeace, and the war will become a national war because it will have the\r\nconsent of the people. Others contest this; there are hot discussions. I\r\nhave moved into a second-class carriage in which there is a photographer\r\nand a captain. I had my fortune told with cards by a lady in the train.\r\nShe said I should soon meet a lot of friends and experience a change of\r\nfortune for the better.\r\n\r\n                                                          _August 28th._\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Kharbin the day before yesterday. The town seems to have\r\ngot much bigger than when I left it last year. The climate has not\r\nimproved, nor have the prices at the hotel diminished. I have already\r\nmet some old friends of last year at the bank and at the staff. There is\r\na new restaurant opposite the bank, where a band plays the overture to\r\n“William Tell” without ceasing. Kharbin is empty. It appears that\r\nLinievitch does not allow officers to come here except on pressing\r\nerrands. I dislike Kharbin more than any place I have ever seen in the\r\nworld. The one topic is, of course, the peace negotiations. The matter\r\nis hotly discussed; some are in favour of peace, others vehemently\r\nagainst it. The news is contradictory. I have asked for leave to go to\r\nthe front. I shall have to wait some days before I receive it.\r\n\r\n                                                          _August 31st._\r\n\r\nI am laid up in bed, and Mr. Ostrovski of the Russo-Chinese bank has\r\njust been to see me. He has come from the staff, where they told him\r\nthat news had been received from St. Petersburg that there would not be\r\npeace. Orders had come to dispatch everything available to the front\r\nwith all possible speed and to get ready for an offensive movement.\r\n\r\n                                                        _September 1st._\r\n\r\nPeace has been officially announced. Among the officers I have seen,\r\nopinions vary, but the men are delighted. They are tearing the telegrams\r\nfrom each other.\r\n\r\n                                                        _September 7th._\r\n\r\nI arrived at Gonchuling yesterday. Gonchuling is now what Mukden used to\r\nbe before the battle of Mukden was fought. It consists of dozens and\r\ndozens of small grey brick houses, with slate roofs, on one side of the\r\nline, and on the other side of the line is a small Chinese town. The\r\nMilitary Attachés are here in their car. I am living with the Press\r\nCensors. People talk about peace as if it was not yet a fact. An\r\nofficer, whose wife I met in the train coming out, has been sent to\r\nfortify positions. Kouropatkin’s army is said to have received orders to\r\nadvance. People express doubts as to whether the peace will be ratified,\r\nand there is talk of a revolution in Japan.\r\n\r\nI have the intention of joining the 2nd Transbaikal Cossack battery,\r\nwith which I lived last year. I have telegraphed to them to send horses\r\nto meet me at Godziadan, the Head Quarters of the Staff.\r\n\r\n                                                       _September 10th._\r\n\r\nI have arrived at Godziadan. In the station is the train of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief. There is also a correspondents’ car, where I have\r\nbeen put up and hospitably entertained by Boris Nikolaievitch\r\nDemchinsky, correspondent of a Russian newspaper. The news has come of\r\nthe first _pour-parlers_ which are to take place between the Russian and\r\nJapanese Commanders-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                             JEN-TZEN-TUNG\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _September 13th._\r\n\r\nI arrived at the quarters of the battery this morning. It is quartered\r\nin a village near the large Chinese town of Jen-tzen-tung on the\r\nMongolian frontier. I started from Godziadan at eight o’clock in the\r\nmorning on the 11th, when I found two Cossacks waiting for me, with a\r\nthird pony for me to ride, saddled with my own English saddle, which I\r\nhad left behind me last year. As we started one of the Cossacks said:\r\n“You must be careful with that pony, he throws himself.” I wondered what\r\nthis meant; whether the pony ran away, or bit, or kicked, or stumbled,\r\nor bucked, or fell, my experience of Chinese ponies being that they do\r\nall these things. I was not long in finding out; it meant that the pony\r\ntook a sort of dive forward every now and then, tearing the skin off\r\none’s fingers in the effort to hold it up.\r\n\r\nAfter we had ridden for about two hours, one of the Cossacks asked the\r\nother if he knew the way. The other answered that he did not. The first\r\none told him he was a fool. “But,” I interrupted, “as you have just come\r\nfrom Jen-tzen-tung, surely you know the way back.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” they answered, “we came by quite a different way along the lines.\r\nBut, _nichevo_, it doesn’t matter. We shall get there somehow.” We\r\nstopped for luncheon at an encampment of the Red Cross. I was\r\nentertained by the doctors and the hospital nurses. They expressed the\r\nmost bitter and violently revolutionary sentiments. After luncheon we\r\nwent on, asking the way of the Chinese in each village, our destination\r\nfor the evening being the large town of Oushitai. At every village we\r\nasked, the Chinese answered by telling us how many lis (a li is 1⅓ of a\r\nmile) Oushitai was distant, and the accuracy with which they determined\r\nthe distance was, as far as I could judge, amazing. We arrived at\r\nOushitai at moonrise. We went into a yard where there was tea, and straw\r\nto lie on, and provisions, but the Cossacks refused to stay there\r\nbecause there were “soldiers” there. The Cossacks, being Cossacks and\r\nnot “soldiers,” often consider it beneath their dignity to mix with\r\nsoldiers. So we had to find another yard, where we drank tea and slept\r\nuntil dawn the next morning, when we started once more. We halted at\r\nmidday in a small Chinese village for our midday meal. It was a small,\r\nrather tumble-down village, with a large clump of trees near it. A\r\nChinaman came out of a house, and seeing the red correspondent’s badge\r\non my arm, asked me if I was a doctor. To save the bother of explanation\r\nI said I was a doctor. Then he conveyed the information in\r\npidgin-Russian that his son was ill, and requested me to cure him. I\r\nwent into the house and he showed me a brown and naked infant with a fat\r\nstomach. I made him put out his tongue. It was white. I asked what he\r\nhad been eating lately. The Chinaman said raw Indian corn. I prescribed\r\ncessation of diet and complete repose. The Chinaman appeared to me to be\r\nmuch satisfied, and asked me if I would like to hear a concert. I said\r\nvery much. Then he bade me sit down on the khan—the natural divan of\r\nevery Chinese house—and to look (“_smotrì, smotrì_” he said). Presently\r\nanother Chinaman came into the room and, taking from the wall a large\r\nand twisted clarion (like the wreathed horn old Triton blew), he blew on\r\nit one deafening blast and hung it up on the wall again. There was a\r\nshort pause, I waited in expectation, and the Chinaman turned to me and\r\nsaid: “The concert is now over.”\r\n\r\nI then went to have luncheon with the Cossacks under the trees. The\r\nluncheon consisted of hard rusks (hard as bricks), made of black bread,\r\nswimming in an earthen bowl of boiling water on the top of which tea was\r\nsprinkled. When we had finished luncheon, and just as we were about to\r\nresume our journey, the Chinaman in whose house I had been entertained\r\nrushed up to me and said: “In your country, when you go to a concert, do\r\nyou not pay for it?” The concert was paid for and then we started once\r\nmore to ride along the mountainous roads, a flat green country, with few\r\ntrees, and great pools of water caused by recent rain, through which we\r\nhad to wade and sometimes to swim. Towards the afternoon the aspect of\r\nthe country changed; we reached grassy and flowery steppes. It was the\r\nbeginning of the Mongolian country. We met Mongols sitting sideways on\r\ntheir ponies, and dressed in coats of many colours. I have never felt\r\nquite so tired in my life as while that interminable afternoon wore on.\r\nThe distance from Godziadan to Jen-tzen-tung is eighty miles, and when\r\nthe sun set, and the Cossacks announced that after arriving at\r\nJen-tzen-tung we should have to ride yet two miles further to find the\r\nbattery, I inwardly resolved that no force on earth should make me ride\r\nanother inch that night. We arrived at Jen-tzen-tung at eight o’clock in\r\nthe evening. There I found my old friend Kizlitzki, of the battery, who,\r\nas usual, was living by himself in Chinese quarters of immaculate\r\ncleanliness. His servant being the former cook of the battery who used\r\nevery day to make “Boeuf Stroganoff,” Kizlitzki gave me an excellent\r\ndinner and a most comfortable bed. The next morning I rode to the\r\nvillage, two miles distant, where the battery was quartered, and here I\r\nfound all my old friends: Glinka, the doctor, Hliebnikoff, and others.\r\n\r\nThe house is a regular Chinese house, or series of one-storeyed houses\r\nforming a quadrangle, in which horses, donkeys, and hens disport\r\nthemselves. We occupy one side of the house. Opposite us the owner\r\nlives. In the evening one hears music from the other side. I went to see\r\nwhat it was; a Chinaman lying on his back plays on a one-stringed lute,\r\n“und singt ein Lied dabei, das hat eine wundersame gewaltige Melodei.”\r\nSomething like this:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Music]]\r\n\r\nThe first question everybody asked me was whether peace had been\r\ndeclared or not. There has been some fighting here at the outposts since\r\npeace was declared.\r\n\r\n                                                       _September 15th._\r\n\r\nThis village is exceedingly picturesque. It lies in a clump of\r\nwillow-trees and hard by there is a large wood which stretches down to a\r\nbroad and brown river. Next to our quarters there is a small house where\r\nan old Chinaman is preparing three young students for their examination\r\nin Pekin. One of these Chinamen came this morning and complained that\r\ntheir house had been ruined by the Cossacks. We went to inspect the\r\ndisaster. It turned out that one of the Cossacks had put his finger\r\nthrough one of the paper windows of the house, making thereby a small\r\nhole in it. The old teacher is quite charming. He recited poetry to us.\r\nWhen the Chinese recite poetry they half sing it. I had lately read a\r\ntranslation of a Chinese poem by Li-Tai-Po, which in the translation\r\nruns thus:—\r\n\r\n           “You ask me what my soul does away in the sky;\r\n           I inwardly smile but I cannot make answer;\r\n           Like the peach blossom carried off by the stream,\r\n           I soar away to a world unknown to you.”\r\n\r\nBy means of a small piece of wood, a flower, and some water I made the\r\nChinaman understand what poem I was alluding to, and he recited it for\r\nus. The Chinese asked me to tell them their fortunes by their hands. I\r\nsaid to one of them, at random, that I saw great riches in his hand,\r\nthinking it would please him. The Chinaman said nothing, but later, when\r\nthis Chinaman, who was a visitor, had gone, the others said to me: “You\r\nspoke true words. That man is a ‘Koupeza’ (pidgin-Russian for merchant)\r\nand he is enormously rich.” These Chinamen take an acute interest in the\r\nresult of the peace negotiations, and wish to be informed as to all\r\nsorts of details of which we are ignorant. The impression among the\r\nofficers here is that it is a very good thing that peace has been\r\nconcluded. “We ought to thank Heaven that our men have not been beaten\r\nagain,” one of them said, and he added: “It is silly to say that the\r\nhigher authorities are the only guilty ones; we are all equally guilty.”\r\n\r\n                                                       _September 16th._\r\n\r\nWe spend the time riding, reading, bathing, sleeping, and playing\r\npatiences.\r\n\r\nJen-tzen-tung is a large and most picturesque town. A constant stream of\r\nMongols flows in and out of it. They wear the most picturesque clothes,\r\nsilks and velvets of deep orange and luminous sea-green, glowing like\r\njewels. We ride into the town to buy provisions, fish mostly. The wines\r\nsold at the shops are all sham and horribly nasty. At the corner of one\r\nof the streets there is a professional wizard, dressed in black silk\r\nembroidered with silver moons, and wearing the conical cap that wizards\r\nalways do wear. You ask a question, pay a small sum and shake coins out\r\nof a cup three times, and according as the coins make an odd or even\r\nfigure, the wizard writes down a sign on a piece of paper, and then he\r\ntells you the answer to your question. The Chinese consult him before\r\nstriking a bargain or setting out on a journey. I asked him whether I\r\nshould get back all right? He answered that I could go home either by\r\nthe East or the West, and that the West would be better, though I should\r\nmeet with obstacles.\r\n\r\nHe refused to prophesy for more than a hundred days ahead.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, after dinner, we discussed politics and the Duma (that\r\nis to say the Duma as originally planned by the decree of August 6th).\r\nThe doctor said that unless there were to be a constitution in Russia,\r\nhe would emigrate abroad, as he did not choose that his children should\r\nbe brought up in a country which was politically inferior to Turkey. He\r\nis hopeful about the Duma; he says Witte will be a national hero; and\r\nthat a constitution is a foregone conclusion. Somebody said the peasants\r\nwere hopeless. He hotly contested this, and said there was far more\r\npolitical sense among the peasants than among the rest of the\r\npopulation. He has had great experience of the peasants.\r\n\r\n                                                       _September 19th._\r\n\r\nI had a long talk with Kizlitzki this afternoon. He is like a round peg\r\nin a square hole in this army. Strict discipline and impeccable order\r\nseem to him the first essentials of military life. The others don’t\r\nunderstand this, although they are conscientious; but they like doing\r\nthings in their own way, which is a happy-go-lucky way, and they think\r\nKizlitzki is rather mad. Kizlitzki told me that at the battle of\r\nTa-shichiae, where he was in command of the battery, when he had made\r\nall the necessary arrangements, placed his guns, &c., he received orders\r\nto go and speak to a general; before he went, he warned his subordinates\r\nto leave everything as it was. When he came back he found that the\r\nbattery, owing to the fancy of one of the subordinates, had been moved\r\ntwo miles from where he had placed it. So he had to fetch it back and\r\narrange everything over again. The result was that it did not open fire\r\nuntil two in the afternoon, a fact which I had noticed at the time,\r\nalthough I was not with the battery then. He said he had never made such\r\nan effort of self-control as not to lose his temper when he saw what had\r\nbeen done. In the French or German, and I trust also in our army,\r\nKizlitzki’s methods would be taken as a matter of course. Here they are\r\nconsidered to be an unnecessary pose. On the other hand he is not in the\r\nleast a formalist, a lover of red-tape, or a pedant; he merely considers\r\nelementary discipline to be necessary.\r\n\r\nI had tea with a Chinese Mandarin. I do not know which was the more\r\nexquisite, his tea or his manners. In the evening we discussed writers\r\nof books. Hliebnikoff said he knew who was the greatest writer in the\r\nworld, and when some one else asked who, he answered Dostoievski of\r\ncourse. The doctor vehemently disagreed with this. Hliebnikoff went out\r\nof the room in disgust. It is astonishing what a quantity of English\r\nnovels these people have read in translations: Mrs. Humphry Ward, Rider\r\nHaggard, Stevenson, Kipling, Conan Doyle, Mark Twain, Jerome K. Jerome.\r\nThe doctor admires Jerome enormously. I think there is a human element\r\nin him which especially appeals to Russians.\r\n\r\n                                                       _September 21st._\r\n\r\nA fine, hot, and glorious September day. The evening was one of those\r\nthings that linger in one’s mind like music. The sky was a very faint\r\nmauve, something between mauve and pink, like a hydrangea, or as Dante\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n                  “Men che di rose e più che di viole\r\n                  Colore aprendo,”\r\n\r\nand, hanging over the delicate willow-trees, silvery in the half-light\r\nand faintly rustling, a large and misty moon—a moon made of ghostly\r\nfire. The days pass in pleasant monotony; visitors come from other\r\ndivisions; but we go to bed about nine in the evening and get up very\r\nearly. It is a delicious life. We often visit the Chinese professor in\r\nhis peripatetic school. One of the students asked me whether in my\r\ncountry “you write and a big captain comes to look-see, and if all was\r\nnot well, beats you.” I said that practically this was the procedure of\r\nour competitive examinations.\r\n\r\n                                                       _September 27th._\r\n\r\nAutumn has come and it is too cold now for the men to be encamped here\r\nout of doors, so we have moved into quarters in the town.\r\n\r\n                                                          _October 1st._\r\n\r\nI left for Gunchuling, _en route_ for Kharbin, with Hliebnikoff and\r\nanother, and bade goodbye to the friends who had so hospitably\r\nentertained me. (Two of them I was never to see again, for they died\r\nshortly after I left, one of typhoid and one of dysentery.) We arrived\r\nat Oushitai at five in the evening. The country is said to be infested\r\nby Hung-Hutzes, and some men were wounded by them yesterday in the\r\nenvirons of this place. At Jen-tzen-tung I met a merchant, whom I had\r\nknown at Liaoyang, who had been caught by the Hung-Hutzes, but—\r\n\r\n                   “As no one present seemed to know\r\n                   His use or name, they let him go.”\r\n\r\nJen-tzen-tung was on the extreme right flank of the Russian army. The\r\narmy therefore extended eighty miles from the extreme right flank to the\r\ncentre, and again another eighty miles from the centre to the extreme\r\nleft flank. Oushitai was connected with Gunchuling by a kind of\r\ntram-railway drawn by horses.\r\n\r\n                                                          _October 6th._\r\n\r\nIn this tram we travelled to Gunchuling, and thence I proceeded to\r\nKharbin by train.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n          THE STRIKE AND THE MANIFESTO OF OCTOBER (30TH) 17TH\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 MOSCOW, _November 3rd_.\r\n\r\nMy return journey from Kharbin to Moscow was entirely uneventful until\r\nwe arrived at Samara. At Irkutsk I had got a place in the Trans-Siberian\r\nexpress, which was crowded with all sorts and conditions of men:\r\nofficers, merchants, three Germans, three Americans who had returned\r\nfrom working a mine in Siberia, a Polish student, and some ladies.\r\n\r\nThe first inkling that I received of the fact that a revolution was\r\ngoing on in Russia came to me in the following manner. We had crossed\r\nthe Urals and had only been travelling thirteen days. We had arrived at\r\nSamara, when the attendant, who looked after the first-class carriage,\r\ncame into my compartment and heaved a deep sigh. I asked him what was\r\nthe matter. “We shan’t get further than Toula,” he said. “Why?” I asked.\r\n“Because of the unpleasantnesses” (_niepriyat nosti_). I asked, “What\r\nunpleasantnesses?” “There is a mutiny,” he said, “on the line.” We\r\npassed the big station of Sisran and arrived at the small town of\r\nKouznetsk. There we were informed that the train could not go any\r\nfurther because of the strike. Nobody realised the extent of the strike,\r\nand we expected to go on in a few hours. By the evening the passengers\r\nbegan to show some signs of restlessness. Most of them telegraphed to\r\nvarious authorities. A petition was telegraphed to the Minister of Ways\r\nand Communications, saying that an express train full of passengers,\r\novertired by a long and fatiguing journey, was waiting at Kouznetsk, and\r\nasking him to be so good as to arrange for them to proceed further.\r\nThere was no answer to this telegram. The next day a sense of\r\nresignation seemed to come over the company. Although every evening,\r\ntowards dinner-time, one heard innumerable complaints such as “only in\r\nRussia could such a _bezobrazie_ (literally an ugliness, _i.e._, a\r\ndisgraceful thing) happen,” and one passenger suggested that Prince\r\nKilkoff’s portrait, which was hung in the dining-car, should be turned\r\nface to the wall. The Polish student, who had accompanied the Americans\r\nand made music for them, playing by ear any tune they whistled to him,\r\nand consequently a great many tunes from the Gaiety repertoire, played\r\nthe piano with exaggerated facility and endless fioriture and runs. I\r\nasked an American mechanic who was with the mining managers whether he\r\nliked the music. He said he would like it if the “damned hell” were\r\nknocked out of it, which was exactly my feeling. But on the second day\r\nafter our arrival my American friends left by road for Samara, to\r\nproceed thence by water to St. Petersburg. The passengers spent the time\r\nin exploring the town, which was somnolent and melancholy in the\r\nextreme. Half of it was a typical Russian village built on a hill, a\r\nmass of brown huts; the other half, on the plain, was like a village in\r\nany country. The idle guards and railway officials sat on the steps of\r\nthe station-room whistling. Two more trains arrived: a sanitary train\r\nand an ordinary slow passenger train.\r\n\r\nThe passengers from these trains wandered about the platform, mixing\r\nwith the idlers from the town population. A crowd of peasants and\r\ntravellers, engineers, and Red Cross attendants, soldiers, and merchants\r\nsauntered up and down in loose shirts and big boots, munching sunflower\r\nseeds and spitting out the husks till the platform was thick with\r\nrefuse. A doctor who was in our train, and who was half a German, with\r\nan official training and an orthodox official mind, talked to the\r\nrailway servants like a father. It was very wrong to strike, he said.\r\nThey should have put down their grievances on paper and had them\r\nforwarded by the proper channels. The officials said that that would be\r\nwaste of ink and caligraphy. “I wonder they don’t kill him,” said my\r\ntravelling companion, and I agreed with him. Each passenger was given a\r\nrouble a day to buy food. The third-class passengers were given checks,\r\nin return for which they could receive meals. However, they deprecated\r\nthe idea, and said that they wanted the amount in beer. They received\r\nit. Then they looted the refreshment room, broke the windows, and took\r\naway the food. This put an end to the check system. The feeling among\r\nthe first-class passengers deepened. Something ought to be done, was the\r\ngeneral verdict; but nobody quite knew what. They felt that the train\r\nought to be placed in a position of safety. The situation on the evening\r\nof the second day began to resemble that described in Maupassant’s\r\nmasterpiece, “Boule de Suif.” Nothing, however, could be done except to\r\nexplore the town of Kouznetsk. It was warm autumn weather. The roads\r\nwere soft and muddy, and there was a smell of rotting leaves in the air.\r\nIt was damp and grey, with gleams of pitiful weak sunshine. In the\r\nmiddle of the town was a large market-place where a brisk trade in geese\r\nwas carried on. One man whom I watched failed to sell his geese during\r\nthe day, and while driving them home at night talked to them as if they\r\nhad been dogs, saying, “Cheer up, we shall soon be home.” A party of\r\nconvicts who belonged to the passenger train were working hard by the\r\nstation, and implored the passing tribute of a sigh and a cigarette.\r\nBoth were freely given. Convicts in Russia are always alluded to as\r\n“unfortunates.” I met them near the station and they at once said, “Give\r\nthe unfortunates something.” In the evening, in one of the third-class\r\ncarriages, a party of Little Russians, assistants in the Red Cross, sang\r\nsongs in parts—melancholy, beautiful songs, with a strange trotting\r\nrhythm and no end and no beginning; and opposite their carriage on the\r\nplatform a small crowd of moujiks gathered together and listened, saying\r\nthat the men sang with cunning (_lovko paiout_).\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fourth day after we had arrived the impatience of\r\nthe passengers increased to fever pitch. A colonel who was with us, and\r\nwho knew how to use the telegraph, communicated with Piensa, the next\r\nbig station. For although the telegraph clerks were on strike they\r\nremained in the office conversing with their friends on the wire all\r\nover Russia. The strikers were most affable. They said they had not the\r\nslightest objection to the express proceeding on its journey, that they\r\nwould neither boycott nor beat anybody who took us, and that if we could\r\nfind a friend to drive the engine, well and good. We did. We found a\r\nfriend, an amateur engine-driver, and an amateur engine, and on the 28th\r\nof October we started for Piensa. We broke down on the way. The\r\nengine-driver was supported by public contributions. The moment the\r\nengine stopped work all the passengers volunteered advice as to how it\r\nshould be mended, one man producing a piece of string for the purpose.\r\nHowever, another stray engine was found, and we arrived at last at\r\nPiensa. There I saw mentioned in the telegrams the words “rights of\r\nspeech and assembly,” and I knew that the strike was a revolution. At\r\nPiensa the rage of the military—who had had their return journey from\r\nthe Far East delayed—against the strikers was indescribable. They were\r\nlurching about the station in a state of inebriate frenzy, using\r\nlanguage about strikes and strikers which is not fit to repeat. One of\r\nthem asked me if I was a striker. We stopped at Piensa for the night. We\r\nstarted again the next morning for Moscow, but the train came to a dead\r\nstop at two o’clock the next morning at Riansk, and when I woke up the\r\nfirst-class attendant came, with many deep sighs, and said that we\r\nshould go no further until the unpleasantnesses were at an end. But an\r\nhour later news came that we could go to Riazan in another train, which\r\nwe did. Riazan station, when we arrived, was guarded by soldiers. A\r\ntrain was ready to start for Moscow, but the scuffle for places in it\r\nwas terrific. I found a place in a third-class carriage. Opposite me was\r\nan old man with a grey beard. He attracted my attention by the\r\nextraordinary courtesy with which he prevented a woman, with many\r\nbundles, from being turned out of the train by another moujik. I asked\r\nhim where he came from. “Eighty versts from the other side of Irkutsk,”\r\nhe said. “I was sent there, and I am returning home now after thirteen\r\nyears at the Government’s expense. I was a convict.” “What were you sent\r\nthere for?” I asked. “Murder!” he answered very gently. The other\r\npassengers asked him to tell his story. “It’s a long story,” he said.\r\n“Tell!” shouted the other passengers. His story briefly was this: He had\r\ngot drunk, set fire to a barn, and when the owner interfered he had\r\nkilled him. He had served two years’ hard labour and eleven years’\r\nbanishment. He was a gentle, humble creature, with a very mild\r\nexpression, like an apostle in disguise. He had no money, and lived on\r\nwhat other passengers gave him. I gave him a cigarette. He smoked a\r\nquarter of it and said he would keep the rest for the journey, as he had\r\nstill got five hundred versts to travel. We arrived at Moscow at eleven\r\no’clock in the evening and found the town in darkness, save for the\r\nglimmer of oil lamps. The next morning we woke up to find that Russia\r\nhad been given a Magna Charta; that the railway and other officials had\r\nobtained the same concessions from the Government as the Barons had won\r\nfrom King John seven hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nMOSCOW, _October 30th_ (Old Style, _October 17th_).\r\n\r\nThe first thing which brought home to me that Russia had been granted\r\nthe promise of a Constitution was this. I went to the big Russian baths.\r\nSomebody came in and asked for some soap, upon which the barber’s\r\nassistant, aged about ten, said with the air of a Hampden, “Give the\r\n‘citizen’ some soap” (_Daite grajdaninon mwilo_). Coming out of the\r\nbaths I found the streets decorated with flags, and everybody in a state\r\nof frantic and effervescing enthusiasm. I went to one of the big\r\nrestaurants. There old men were embracing each other and drinking the\r\nfirst glass of vodka to free Russia. After luncheon I went out into the\r\nTheatre square. There is a fountain in it, which forms an excellent\r\npublic platform. An orator mounted it and addressed the crowd. He began\r\nto read the Emperor’s Manifesto. Then he said: “We are all too much used\r\nto the rascality of the Autocracy to believe this; away with the\r\nAutocracy!” The crowd, infuriated—they were evidently expecting an\r\nenthusiastic eulogy—cried: “Away with you!” But instead of attacking the\r\nspeaker who had aroused their indignation they ran away from him! It was\r\na curious sight. The spectators on the pavement were seized with panic\r\nand ran too. The orator, seeing his speech had missed fire, changed its\r\ntone and said: “You have misunderstood me.” But what he had said was\r\nperfectly clear. This speaker was an ordinary Hyde Park orator, and not\r\nto be confused with the University professors who afterwards spoke from\r\nthe same platform. Later in the afternoon a procession of students\r\narrived opposite my hotel with red flags, and collected outside the\r\nGovernor-General’s house. He appeared on the balcony and made a speech,\r\nin which he said that now there were no police he hoped that they would\r\nbe able to keep order themselves. He asked them also to replace the red\r\nflag which was hanging on the lamp-post opposite the palace by the\r\nnational flag. One little student climbed like a monkey up the lamp-post\r\nand hung a national flag there, but did not remove the red flag. Then\r\nthe Governor asked them to sing the National Anthem, which they did; and\r\nas they went away they sang the Marseillaise.\r\n\r\n            “On peut très bien jouer ces deux airs à la fois\r\n            Et cela fait un air qui fait sauter les rois.”\r\n\r\nAt one moment a Cossack arrived, but an official came out of the house\r\nand told him he was not needed, upon which he went away amidst the\r\njeers, cheers, hoots, and whistling of the crowd. The day passed off\r\nquietly on the whole, the only untoward incidents being the death of a\r\nwoman and the wounding of a student and a workman while trying to rescue\r\na student from the prisoners’ van. A veterinary surgeon called Bauman\r\nwas also shot on this day.\r\n\r\nTo-day for the first time I heard the phrase “Black Gang” used. I was\r\nstanding on the doorstep of the Hôtel de France, when a woman rushed\r\nfrantically up and said the “Black Gang” were coming. A student,\r\nbelonging to a very good family, who was standing there, also explained\r\nthat the “Black Gang” consisted of roughs who supported the autocratic\r\ncause. His hand, which was bandaged, had been severely hurt while he was\r\nin the act of taking off his hat that day, by a Cossack who had beat it\r\nwith a whip, thinking he was about to make a disturbance. He came up to\r\nmy room and from the hotel window we had a good view of the crowd which\r\nproceeded to—\r\n\r\n                           “attaquer la Marseillaise en _la_\r\n           Sur les cuivres, pendant que la flûte soupire\r\n           En _mi bèmol_: Veillons au salut de l’Empire.”\r\n\r\n                                                 MOSCOW, _November 7th_.\r\n\r\nI went to see Maxim Gorki’s new play at the Artistic Theatre of Moscow,\r\n“The Children of the Sun.” It was the second night that it had been\r\nperformed. M. Stanislavoshi, one of the chief actors of the troupe and\r\nthe stage manager, gave me his place. The theatre was crammed. There is\r\na scene in the play, where a doctor, living in a Russian village, and\r\ndevoting his life to the welfare of the peasants, is suspected of having\r\ncaused an outbreak of cholera. The infuriated peasants pursue the doctor\r\nand bash some one on the head. On the first night this scene had reduced\r\na part of the audience to hysterics. It was too “actual.” People said we\r\nsee enough of our friends killed in the streets without going to the\r\nplay for such a sight. On the second night it was said that the\r\noffensive scene had been suppressed. I did not quite understand what had\r\nbeen eliminated. As I saw the scene it was played as follows. A roar is\r\nheard as of an angry crowd. Then the doctor runs into a house and hides.\r\nThe master of the house protests; a peasant flies at his throat and half\r\nstrangles him until he is beaten on the head by another peasant who\r\nbelongs to the house. The play is full of interesting moments, and was\r\nplayed with the finished perfection which makes this theatre famous and\r\nunique. But M. Gorki has not M. Tchekoff’s talent of representing on the\r\nstage the uneventful passage of time, the succession of the seemingly\r\ninsignificant incidents of people’s everyday lives, chosen with such\r\nskill, depicted with such an instinct for mood and atmosphere that the\r\nresult is enthrallingly interesting. M. Gorki’s plays have the faults\r\nand qualities of his stories. They are unequal, but contain moments of\r\npoignant interest and vividness. I do not think, however, that his gifts\r\nare pre-eminently suited for the stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n                       MOSCOW AFTER THE MANIFESTO\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               _Wednesday, October 1st._\r\n\r\nAt dinner at the Métropole Restaurant a strange scene occurred. At the\r\nend of dinner the band played the Marseillaise, and after it the\r\nNational Anthem. Everybody stood up except one mild-looking man with\r\nspectacles, who went on calmly eating his dinner, upon which a man who\r\nwas sitting at the other end of the room, and was rather drunk, rushed\r\nup to him and began to pull him about and drag him to his feet. He made\r\na display of passive resistance, which proved effectual, and when he had\r\nfinished his dinner he went away.\r\n\r\n                                               _Thursday, November 2nd._\r\n\r\nThe outward aspect of the town during these days is strange. Moscow\r\nseems like a city which has been undergoing a siege. Many of the shops\r\nhave got great wooden shutters. Some of the doors have a large red cross\r\non them. The distress, I am told, during the strike was terrible. There\r\nwas no light, no gas, no water, all the shops were shut; provisions and\r\nwood were scarce. This afternoon I went to see Bauman’s funeral\r\nprocession, which I witnessed from many parts of the town. It was one of\r\nthe most impressive sights I have ever seen. A hundred thousand men took\r\npart in it. The whole of the “Intelligenzia” (the professional and\r\nmiddle class) was in the streets or at the windows. The windows and\r\nbalconies were crowded with people. The order was perfect. There was not\r\na hitch nor a scuffle. The men walking in the procession consisted of\r\nstudents, doctors, workmen, people in various kinds of uniform. There\r\nwere ambulances, with doctors dressed in white in them, in case there\r\nshould be casualties. The men bore great red banners and the coffin was\r\ncovered with a scarlet pall. As they marched they sang in a low chant\r\nthe “Marseillaise,” “Viechni Pamiat,” and the “Funeral March”[1] of the\r\nfighters for freedom. This last tune is the most impressive. From a\r\nmusician’s point of view it is a shockingly bad tune; but then, as Du\r\nMaurier said, one should never listen to musicians on the subject of\r\nmusic any more than one should listen to wine merchants on the subject\r\nof wine. But it is the tune which to my mind is exactly fitting for the\r\nRussian revolution, with its dogged melancholy and invincible passion,\r\nas fitting as the “Marseillaise” (which, by the way, the Russian sings\r\nin parts and slowly) is totally unfitting. The “Funeral March” has\r\nnothing defiant in it; but it is one of those tunes which, when sung by\r\na multitude, make one’s flesh creep; it is commonplace if you will; and\r\nit expresses—as it were by accident—the commonplaceness of all that is\r\ndetermined and unflinching, mingled with an accent of weary pathos. As\r\nit grew dark torches were brought out, lighting up the red banners and\r\nthe scarlet coffin of the unknown veterinary surgeon, who in a second,\r\nby a strange freak of chance, had become a hero, or rather a symbol, an\r\nemblem and a banner, and who was being carried to his last resting place\r\nwith a simplicity which eclipsed the pomp of all royal funerals, and to\r\nthe sound of a low song of tired but indefatigable sadness stronger and\r\nmore formidable than the pæans which celebrate the triumphs and the\r\npageants of kings.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  By a strange irony of fate, this tune, which the revolutionaries have\r\n  made their own, was originally an official tune, composed probably by\r\n  some obscure military bandmaster, and played at the funerals of\r\n  officers and high officials.\r\n\r\nThe impression left on my mind by this funeral is deep. As I saw these\r\nhundred thousand men march past so quietly, so simply, in their\r\nbourgeois clothes, singing in careless, almost conversational fashion, I\r\nseemed nevertheless to hear the “tramping of innumerable armies,” and to\r\nfeel the breath of the\r\n\r\n                 “Courage never to submit or yield,\r\n                 And what is else not to be overcome.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for the Government or for any one else to accuse these\r\npeople of displaying a provoking attitude, of badgering or insulting the\r\nsoldiers or the authorities, or of not being able to keep order among\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n                                                         _November 3rd._\r\n\r\nLast night, after Bauman’s funeral, which passed off without an\r\nincident, at eleven o’clock a number of students and doctors were shot\r\nin front of the university, as they were on their way home, by Cossacks,\r\nwho were stationed in the Riding School, opposite the university. The\r\nCossacks fired without orders. They were incensed, as many of the troops\r\nwere, by the display of red flags, and they disliked processions.\r\n\r\n                                                         _November 6th._\r\n\r\nThe last three days have been days of curious disorder and anarchy. I\r\nwill try and note briefly what has been taking place.\r\n\r\nThe day after Bauman’s funeral (November 3rd) was the anniversary of the\r\nEmperor’s accession, and all the “hooligans” of the city, who are now\r\ncalled the “Black Gang,” used the opportunity to make counter\r\ndemonstrations under the ægis of the National flag. The students did\r\nnothing, they were in no way aggressive; but the hooligans when they\r\ncame across a student beat him and in many cases killed him. The police\r\ndid nothing; they seemed to have disappeared. These hooligans paraded\r\nthe town in small groups, sometimes uniting, blocking the traffic,\r\ndemanding money from well-dressed people, killing students, and making\r\nthemselves generally objectionable. When the police were appealed to\r\nthey shrugged their shoulders and said: “Liberty.” The hooligans\r\ndemanded the release of the man who had killed Bauman. “They have set\r\nfree so many of their men,” they said, referring to the revolutionaries,\r\n“we want our man set free.” Practically the town was in a state of\r\nanarchy; anybody could kill any one else with impunity. In one of the\r\nbiggest streets a hooligan came up to a man and asked him for money; he\r\ngave him ten kopecks. “Is that all?” said the hooligan, “Take that,” and\r\nhe killed him with a Finnish knife. I was myself stopped by a band on\r\nthe Twerskaia and asked politely to contribute to their fund, the fund\r\nof the “Black Gang,” which I did with considerable alacrity. However,\r\nstudents, or those whom they considered to be students in disguise, were\r\nthe people they mostly attacked. The citizens of the town in general\r\nsoon began to think that this state of things was intolerable, and\r\nvigorous representations were made to the town Duma that some steps\r\nshould be taken to put an end to it. The hooligans broke the windows of\r\nthe Hôtel Métropole and those of several shops. There was a general\r\nimpression among them that liberty meant doing as much damage as they\r\npleased. This state of things lasted three days, and now it has been\r\nstopped—utterly and completely stopped. A notice is published forbidding\r\nall demonstrations in the streets with flags. The police have\r\nreappeared, and everything has resumed its normal course. These bands of\r\nhooligans were small and exceedingly easy to deal with. The disorders\r\nwere completely unnecessary. But they have done some good in one way;\r\nthey have brought home to everybody the necessity for order and the\r\nmaintenance of order, and the conviction that if the police are removed\r\nthe result will be anarchy. However, considering the state of\r\nlawlessness that existed, it is remarkable how little damage was done.\r\n\r\nThe night before last, as I was walking back to the hotel after dinner,\r\nI met two omnibuses full of wounded students being driven to the\r\nhospital. One student was torn to pieces by a hooligan crowd yesterday\r\nafternoon; and a friend of mine from the windows of the Hôtel National\r\nsaw another trampled to death.\r\n\r\nThe general tenour of opinion among the Liberals is that the Government\r\nmust prove their good intentions by deeds and not by words, and that\r\nsoothing Manifestoes are of no use now. There are three points on which\r\nthey insist. First, they demand that the partial amnesty should be made\r\ncomplete; that there should be an amnesty for all political offenders\r\nwithout exception. Secondly, they say that they have no guarantee for\r\nthe new reforms, because the Ministers are taken from the Bureaucracy.\r\nThey demand new Ministers taken from the Zemstva. Thirdly, they demand\r\nthe resignation of General Trepoff. With regard to the first point it\r\nwould be a wise step on the part of the Government to satisfy the\r\nLiberals. The concessions will probably be made gradually, and I suppose\r\ntheir maxim is not to give too much at once or the demands will\r\nincrease. It is a pity, if the Government have decided to give in on\r\nthis point, that they did not do so at once. Every concession seems, as\r\nit is, to have been extorted by force. That is the general impression of\r\nthe Liberals: “We have been given nothing; everything we have obtained\r\nwe have extorted by force.” With regard to the resignation of General\r\nTrepoff, if I were a Russian and guarantees were given that the police\r\nwere no longer going to interfere with individuals, and that the secret\r\npolice force was to be abolished—and I believe this is being done—I\r\nshould make a demonstration for the retention of General Trepoff. If\r\nthere are to be police at all to keep order, somebody must manage them.\r\nThe Russian police are a hopelessly incompetent body, and General\r\nTrepoff is a thoroughly competent man. He may have used too heavy a hand\r\nsometimes, and I can understand the people being indignant that he\r\nshould rule Russia like a dictator. On the other hand he knows how to\r\nkeep order; he knows how to manage the police, and if the liberty of\r\nindividuals is respected—and, so far, since the publication of the\r\nManifesto it has been—I cannot see why any one should desire his\r\nretirement. However, the discussion of this point is futile. General\r\nTrepoff has become a symbol, like General Galliffet in France after the\r\nCommune. To the ordinary Russian Liberal he represents the Bureaucracy\r\nand all the evils of the old régime, and nothing can change that\r\nimpression. His position is probably untenable, and he will be forced to\r\nresign, though, as far as liberty is concerned, at present the people do\r\nexactly what they like in the way of political meetings, the newspapers\r\nwrite what they please, and the prisons at Moscow and St. Petersburg\r\nhave been partially emptied of their political prisoners. The Russians\r\nhave, in fact, got the two boons which Matthew Arnold said were so\r\ndearly cherished by the English middle class—liberty to make fools of\r\nthemselves, and publicity to show the world how they are doing it. The\r\nextreme revolutionary party wish to do away with the Emperor altogether\r\nand to have a Republic. If this is done some people say there will be a\r\ncivil war in every town and village in the Russian Empire. As it is,\r\nhalf the people do not understand what a Constitution means. A soldier,\r\nfor instance, asked whether it meant that the Emperor had resigned; and\r\nsome of the educated class understand it still less.\r\n\r\nAltogether the Liberals seem to me to be in too great a hurry;\r\nnevertheless things are apparently calming down. The question is—Will\r\nCount Witte between now and then succeed in thoroughly gaining the\r\nconfidence of the Liberals and of the representatives of the Zemtsva? If\r\nhe succeeds all will be well. The extreme Conservative Party,\r\nrepresented by the _Moskovski Viedomosti_, is really of no practical\r\naccount. Its point of view was admirably represented by the hall porter\r\nof one of the old and conservative families at Moscow, who on the day of\r\nthe publication of the Manifesto said: “The Emperor has deserted us.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n                ST. PETERSBURG BEFORE THE SECOND STRIKE\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         ST. PETERSBURG, _November 9th_.\r\n\r\nI arrived here this morning from Moscow. The chief piece of news which\r\nis being discussed is the dismissal of Trepoff. Of Trepoff one always\r\nhears contradictory accounts: some people saying he is an inveterate\r\nreactionary, a Jew-baiter, &c.; others that he is a man of great common\r\nsense, liberal in policy as far as this is compatible with common sense,\r\nand never afraid of speaking his mind. I heard from people who ought to\r\nknow that he was strongly in favour of the granting of the Manifesto of\r\nOctober 17th. What aroused the general hatred against him was his “order\r\nfor the day” telling the soldiers not to spare cartridges, should there\r\nbe disorders. I met him once here before the war broke out. I thought he\r\nseemed a sensible, strong-willed person. When he was Chief of the Police\r\nat Moscow he had the reputation of being sensible, of keeping order\r\nwell, of being rather heavy-handed, and of committing foolish _gaffes_\r\nfrom time to time. I am certain he is neither the monster he is made out\r\nby the Liberal press here and abroad, nor yet the Cromwellian genius\r\nother people would have us believe him to be. I expect that his strength\r\nlies in the fact that he does not mind saying what he thinks. In St.\r\nPetersburg this quality is so rare that people who possess it appear to\r\nbe geniuses.\r\n\r\n                                                        _November 12th._\r\n\r\nI went this afternoon to hear a performance of Beethoven’s “Fidelio.” I\r\ndon’t think the young lions in the gallery realised that this opera was\r\nthe complete expression of the “Liberation movement” in Germany!\r\n\r\nThe number of hooligans who now infest the streets is great. A story is\r\ncirculating of a hooligan who stopped a man and demanded his watch. He\r\ngave it. The hooligan then asked for his coat. He gave it also, the\r\nhooligan giving him his own coat in exchange. When the man who had been\r\nrobbed got home he found his own watch and 170 roubles in the pocket of\r\nthe hooligan’s coat.\r\n\r\n                                                        _November 14th._\r\n\r\nThe official declaration of the postponement of the Polish\r\nconstitutional liberties is causing a good deal of talk and excitement.\r\n\r\nOne point with regard to Poland which people sometimes overlook is that\r\nthere are Poles in Germany; Poles in the North of Germany besides those\r\nin German Poland; and moreover a great many Poles. German Poland also is\r\nan important factor in itself. The situation therefore is analogous to\r\nwhat would happen if Ireland were a country shared between France and\r\nEngland, and if England had been at war with Germany or any Power, just\r\nas Russia has been at war with Japan, and if while that war lasted\r\nFrance had promised to cause no trouble on our Irish frontier. Whether\r\nthe German Emperor made any definite promise not to interfere on the\r\nPolish frontier during the Japanese War it is impossible to say; what at\r\nall events is certain is that an independent Poland would not be viewed\r\nfavourably in Germany, because it would tend to produce an independent\r\nGerman Poland and a discontented and rebellious Polish population in\r\nNorth Germany. One has only to read Bismarck’s Memoirs to see that one\r\nof the keynotes of his policy was a friendship with Russia based on\r\ncommon interests and action with regard to Poland. It is unlikely that\r\nthe German Emperor has departed from this traditional policy. However\r\nthat may be, at this moment the situation in Poland, the prolonged\r\nstrike which has continued steadily long after the strikes have ceased\r\nin other parts of Russia, calls for some immediate action. Two courses\r\nwere open to the Government: either to grant autonomy at once or to\r\nenforce order by martial law. There is a rumour current here that the\r\nGerman Emperor, who would, as has already been explained, be strongly\r\nopposed to anything like Polish autonomy, had come to an agreement with\r\nthe Russian Emperor on this point. The Russian newspapers to-day say\r\nthat German troops are being moved to the frontier. In any case we are\r\nface to face with the fact that martial law has been proclaimed in\r\nPoland; and any sentimental sympathy with the Poles which one might feel\r\nis counteracted by the fact that had they only waited until the Duma or\r\nthe Constituent Assembly met in Russia they would probably have got\r\nautonomy without any trouble. Whether the enforcement of martial law in\r\nPoland is a wise measure or not is another question; but it is one of\r\ntwo necessary courses.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the Poles, like the Liberals here, are in a great\r\nhurry. They wish everything to be done at once, and changes which have\r\ntaken some centuries to elaborate in other and calmer countries to be\r\nbrought about here in a few days. The Liberals are now crying loudly\r\nthat nothing will satisfy them but a Constituent Assembly based on\r\nuniversal suffrage. They are unwilling to wait a few months until order\r\ncan be restored, and until the Duma can meet and vote on the adoption or\r\nthe non-adoption of such an assembly. They wish it to come straight into\r\nexistence, like Pallas from the brain of Zeus. All that is written in\r\nthe Liberal papers here must not be taken as an absolutely impartial and\r\ndispassionate record of facts. A well-informed, sensible, and Liberal\r\nRussian told me yesterday that some of these papers—and among them not\r\nthe most Radical, some of which, he said, were managed by sincere and\r\nable men—were merely for opposition for the sake of opposition, and that\r\nwhatever Count Witte said or did they would say it was wrong; some of\r\nthem act the part of deliberate inciters and wish merely to add fuel to\r\nthe general excitement. I am not of course alluding to Liberal\r\nnewspapers which have an old-established and solid reputation such as\r\nthe _Russkie Viedomosti_ of Moscow. There is a newspaper here which was\r\nespecially violent in insisting on the fact that not only General\r\nTrepoff but also all the military should be removed from the town; these\r\nviolent articles did not prevent them from sending privately to General\r\nTrepoff to ask for a squadron of Cossacks to protect their office,\r\nbegging at the same time that this request might be kept secret.\r\n\r\nThe “Intellectuals” of Russia have many qualities, but everything they\r\nsay must not be taken as being irrefutable; they are human, like the\r\nrest of us. They are less practical than some of us, even if we do not\r\nagree with a well-known French manager of a _café_ here, who said: “Les\r\nIntelligents!” (with a snort of disgust). “Ce sont les intelligents les\r\nplus bêtes que j’aie jamais vus.” What one is hearing constantly said by\r\nsensible people is that before any political theory or system is carried\r\ninto effect order must be restored; that the reforms which have been\r\ngranted cannot be carried out in detail in a day; that there is one man\r\ncapable of carrying these reforms out, and that he is Count Witte; that\r\nto oppose Count Witte for the sake of opposition is merely criminal,\r\nbecause if Count Witte throws up the sponge the game will be lost and\r\nthe result will be universal anarchy, the only remedy for which will be\r\nuniversal and drastic repression. The trouble is that Count Witte is a\r\nman of business, and no one else in Russia is. It seems to me that the\r\nLiberals by their action are in danger of creating a party of reaction.\r\nFor the so-called “reactionary party” did not up to the present moment\r\nexist. That is to say, there was practically nobody of any importance\r\nwho wished to revert to the state of things before the granting of the\r\nConstitution. On the other hand, there are a great many people who think\r\nthat the maintenance of order is all important.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of the Government, however, say that it is making for\r\ndisorder, and point to the massacres of the Jews in the provinces. The\r\nKronstadt mutiny is said not to have been political; nevertheless if the\r\nsailors had not got drunk, nothing could have prevented their blowing\r\nPeterhof to bits. A universal strike is threatened immediately.\r\n\r\n                                                        _November 17th._\r\n\r\nLast night, while I was at the Opéra Bouffe, where the “Country Girl”\r\nwas being given, the electric light went out. The performance continued\r\nall the same; the actors holding bedroom candles in their hands, while\r\nthe auditorium remained in the dimmest of twilights. This is owing to\r\nthe strike.\r\n\r\n                                                        _November 21st._\r\n\r\nI started for London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n                       MOSCOW—THE DECEMBER RISING\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                MOSCOW, _December 12th_.\r\n\r\nWhen one is in England it is very difficult to form an idea of what is\r\ntaking place in Russia, and this is not owing to the absence but to the\r\nsuperabundance of news concerning Russian events. One cannot see the\r\nwood for the trees. In Russia there is also a superabundance of news and\r\nof rumours; but merely by walking about in the streets one is brought\r\nface to face with certain facts, enabling one to check the news to some\r\nextent. I have been in Russia a week, at St. Petersburg, and I arrived\r\nhere yesterday. In St. Petersburg the impression that a stranger\r\nreceives on arriving is that everything is going on exactly the same as\r\nusual. The streets are crowded, the shops are all open, and there is\r\nnothing to show that the country is in a state of revolution.\r\n\r\nThe postal strike was over in St. Petersburg when I arrived, and it is\r\nnow over here, although, owing to the dislocation and the arrears, the\r\npostal service is at this moment almost imperceptible.\r\n\r\nWith regard to political matters, the main impression one receives is\r\nthat the revolutionary party is admirably organised, and although there\r\nare dissensions among it—as, for instance, between the Social\r\nRevolutionaries and the Social Democrats—they are willing if not ready\r\nto coalesce at any given moment against the Government, whereas the body\r\nof people who do not side with the revolutionaries are split up into\r\nvarious groups, differing on some of the most important points of\r\npolicy. Perhaps the most important of these groups is the Constitutional\r\nDemocratic Party, which is in favour of universal suffrage and a\r\nNational Assembly.\r\n\r\nEspecially remarkable are the various shapes taken by the criticism\r\ndirected against Count Witte by the various parties. Roughly speaking,\r\nthis criticism may be divided into three heads:\r\n\r\n1. The revolutionaries (including the Constitutional Democrats) say that\r\nCount Witte is a Bureaucrat; that nothing good can come of him, and that\r\nhe and his _régime_ must go.\r\n\r\n2. The Moderates—I call them Moderates for want of a better word—say\r\nthat Count Witte has not proved himself to be equal to his task; that\r\nsince the publication of the Manifesto he has not formulated a single\r\nlaw save an ineffectual one with regard to the Press.\r\n\r\n3. The reactionary Nationalists say that Count Witte is a traitor, that\r\nhe has been bought by the Jews and is playing for a Republic. There is a\r\nsentence of Napoleon’s which perhaps may occur to Count Witte under the\r\npresent circumstances: “Un homme d’état est-il fait pour être sensible?\r\nN’est-ce pas un personnage complètement excentrique, toujours seul d’un\r\ncôté, avec le monde de l’autre?” Count Witte is at this moment\r\ncompletely “excentric.” If he succeeds—and by succeeding I mean\r\nremaining in power until the Duma meets—his triumph will be great. To\r\ngive some idea of the atmosphere which we vaguely call public opinion, I\r\nwill quote some of the _obiter dicta_ I have heard since I have been\r\nhere. That Count Witte is a cunning old fox, worse than Plehve. That\r\nCount Witte is not what he was; that he is merely incapable of executing\r\nwhat he undertook. That Count Witte is the most far-seeing man in\r\nRussia; that he centralised Russia in order to lead to a revolution, and\r\nthus make radical changes easier; that he placed the railways in the\r\nhands of the State and created the spirit monopoly in order to have no\r\nprivate interests to deal with when the crash should come. That Count\r\nWitte is a Radical of the type of Robespierre, and will only declare\r\nhimself to be on the side of popular representation when the upper\r\nclasses are entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\nThat the Government is too weak, and that it all comes from having been\r\ntoo weak from the first and from not having hanged the Kronstadt\r\nmutineers. That the Government was too reactionary from the first, and\r\nthat it destroyed the confidence of the people by establishing martial\r\nlaw in Poland directly after the Manifesto. That the _régime_ of Plehve\r\nwas better than the present state of anarchy. That the present _régime_\r\nis more reactionary than the system of Plehve. That with a Government as\r\nrevolutionary as the existing one nothing good can be expected; that the\r\nConstitution should be withdrawn, the Emperor should be deposed and\r\nanother appointed, and that Count Witte should be hanged. That the\r\nGovernment has not been explicit enough; that a programme including two\r\nLegislative Chambers—an Upper and Lower Chamber—should be published and\r\nsworn to by the Emperor, and that the utmost severity should be\r\nemployed, after that, in case of necessity. That no Government at all is\r\nnecessary in Russia; only a _Bund_, a Council of Empire, which should\r\nmeet once a year and manage the railways; that the Army should be\r\ndisbanded and the country entirely decentralised. That a Dictator should\r\nbe appointed at once, and 10,000 “intellectuals” arrested.\r\n\r\nThat the revolutionaries merely want to destroy any form of government\r\nas an act of revenge; that they are as the Irish, “agin the Government”;\r\nthat this act of revenge is not surprising, considering they are\r\nsmarting under the monstrous wrong which has been done them for years,\r\n_i.e._, misgovernment carried to the extreme. That nothing can possibly\r\nrestore peace to Russia except universal suffrage, and that Russia being\r\nby nature more democratic than other European countries need not feel\r\nherself bound to follow their example, but must proceed straight to\r\nuniversal suffrage. That the Emperor should go to Moscow. That if the\r\nEmperor goes to Moscow it would excite the peasants to kill the middle\r\nand upper classes. That this would be a bad thing. That this would be a\r\ngood thing. That if the Emperor goes to Moscow he will be killed. That\r\nit is nonsense to think the Emperor would be killed at Moscow; that his\r\nposition cannot be worse than it is, but might be improved by such a\r\nstep. That the Kremlin would be a safer residence than the Tsarskoe\r\nSelo. That the Emperor must take an oath to the Constitution, and give\r\nguarantees that it will not be withdrawn. That the Emperor should put\r\nhimself at the head of the peasants and the Army and snap his fingers at\r\nthe Socialists and the landlords and give the peasants the land.\r\n\r\nAll these opinions I have heard from Russians since I have been here. In\r\nSt. Petersburg considerable anxiety was felt as to what would happen in\r\nMoscow on the occasion of the Emperor’s birthday (to-day), since the\r\nreactionary party—the “Alliance of Russian People”—had requested and\r\nbeen allowed to organise a demonstration opposite the Kremlin. These\r\nfears, however, proved groundless. I was present at the demonstration.\r\nThe holy banners were carried in procession from the Kremlin to the\r\npublic place outside the Kremlin walls, where a service was held. The\r\nprocession then returned into the Kremlin at twelve o’clock. There was a\r\nsmall crowd looking on, and one man (a butcher) made a speech, saying\r\nthat the Emperor had been terrorised into giving a Constitution, but\r\nthat he would be requested to take it back again. The crowd cheered, and\r\none policeman repeated five times that the speaker was a fine fellow.\r\nThe crowd then marched in procession to the Governor-General’s house,\r\nand Admiral Dubassoff spoke to the crowd. This crowd was a ridiculously\r\nsmall one; it dispersed at noon. The population of Moscow was\r\nconspicuous by its absence.\r\n\r\nA great deal is talked at present about the doings of the hooligans in\r\nSt. Petersburg and Moscow. In St. Petersburg the number of beggars in\r\nthe street is remarkable; here the doings of the hooligans are said to\r\ntake place mostly at night. One hears on all sides that the state of\r\nthings is impossible and that the streets are unsafe, yet they are\r\ncrowded with people all day long. There appears also to be some danger\r\nfrom the reckless way in which the population toy with “Browning”\r\npistols in self-defence, but except for this and the hooligans there is\r\nno kind of danger for foreigners here.\r\n\r\nThe state of the Army here has caused the Government a good deal of\r\nalarm. The mutiny in the Rostov Regiment came to an abrupt end\r\nyesterday, and to-day news has arrived of a manifesto granting the\r\nsoldiers extra pay, extra meat, and soap. The discontent among the\r\nsoldiers and sailors has been up to now in every case economical and not\r\npolitical, therefore it is thought that if the economical demands are\r\nsatisfied the discontent will disappear. It will be well for the\r\nGovernment if it does, for in the long run the ultimate issue of the\r\nconflict must depend on the Army, and the symptoms which have declared\r\nthemselves up to now are not reassuring. It is quite possible, however,\r\nthat the soap and the blankets which are to be given to the men may\r\nallay their political restlessness. The Cavalry is said to have been all\r\nalong thoroughly reliable.\r\n\r\n                                                MOSCOW, _December 28th_.\r\n\r\nWednesday, the 20th of December, punctually at midday the strike began\r\nin Moscow. The lift ceased working in the hotel, the electric light was\r\nturned off and I laid in a large store of books and cigarettes against\r\ncoming events. The strike was said to be an answer to the summary\r\nproceedings of the Government and its action in arresting leaders of the\r\nrevolutionary committee, &c., and its watchword was to be: “A\r\nConstituent Assembly based upon universal suffrage.” Beyond the electric\r\nlight going out nothing happened on this day. On Thursday, the 21st,\r\nmost of the shops began to shut. The man who cleaned the boots in the\r\nhotel made the following remark: “I now understand that the people enjoy\r\ngreat power.” I heard a shot fired somewhere from the hotel at nine\r\no’clock in the evening. I asked the hall porter whether the theatres\r\nwere open. He said they were shut, and added: “And who would dream of\r\ngoing to the theatre in these times of stress?”\r\n\r\nThe next day I drove with a friend into the country to a village called\r\nChernaia, about 25 versts from Moscow on the Novgorod road, which before\r\nthe days of railways was famous for its highway robberies and assaults\r\non the rich merchants by the hooligans of that day. We drove in a big\r\nwooden sledge drawn by two horses, the coachman standing up all the\r\nwhile. We went to visit two old maids, who were peasants and lived in\r\nthe village. One of them had got stranded in Moscow, and owing to the\r\nrailway strike was unable to go back again and so we took her with us,\r\notherwise she would have walked home. We started at 10.30 and arrived at\r\n1.30. The road was absolutely still—a thick carpet of snow, upon which\r\nfresh flakes drifting in the fitful gusts of wind fell gently. Looking\r\nat the drifting flakes which seemed to be tossed about in the air, the\r\nfirst old maid said that a man’s life was like a snowflake in the wind,\r\nand that she had never thought she would go home with us on her sister’s\r\nname-day.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the village we found a meal ready for us, which,\r\nalthough the fast of Advent was being strictly observed and the food\r\nmade with fasting-butter, was far from jejune. It consisted of pies with\r\nrice and cabbage inside, and cold fish and tea and jam, and some vodka\r\nfor me—the guest. The cottage consisted of one room and two very small\r\nante-rooms—the walls, floors, and ceilings of plain deal. Five or six\r\nrich ikons hung in the corner of the room, and a coloured oleograph of\r\nFather John of Kronstadt on one of the walls. A large stove heated the\r\nroom. Soon some guests arrived to congratulate old maid No. 2 on her\r\nname-day, and after a time the pope entered, blessed the room, and sat\r\ndown to tea. We talked of the strike and how quiet the country was and\r\nof the hooligans in the town. “No,” said the pope with gravity, “we have\r\nour own hooligans.” A little later the village schoolmaster arrived, who\r\nlooked about twenty years old, and was a little tiny man with a fresh\r\nface and gold-rimmed spectacles, with his wife, who, like the æsthetic\r\nlady in Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Patience,” was “massive.” I asked the\r\npope if I could live unmolested in this village. He said, “Yes, but if\r\nyou want to work you won’t be quiet in this house, because your two\r\nhostesses chatter and drink tea all day and all night.” At three o’clock\r\nwe thought we had better be starting home; it was getting dark, the snow\r\nwas falling heavily. The old maids said we couldn’t possibly go. We\r\nshould (1) lose our way, (2) be robbed by tramps, (3) be massacred by\r\nstrikers on the railway line, (4) not be allowed to enter the town, (5)\r\nbe attacked by hooligans when we reached the dark streets. We sent for\r\nVassili, the coachman, to consult with him. “Can you find your way\r\nhome?” we asked. “Yes, I can,” he said. “Shall we lose our way?” “We\r\nmight lose our way—it happens,” he said slowly, “it happens times and\r\nagain; but we might not—it often doesn’t happen.” “Might we be attacked\r\non the way?” “We might—it happens—they attack; but we might\r\nnot—sometimes they don’t attack.” “Are the horses tired?” “Yes, the\r\nhorses are tired.” “Then we had better not go.” “The horses can go all\r\nright,” he said. Then we thought we would stay; but Vassili said that\r\nhis master would curse him if he stayed unless we “added” something.\r\n\r\nSo we settled to stay, and the schoolmaster took us to see the village\r\nschool, which was clean, roomy, and altogether an excellent home of\r\nlearning. Then he took us to a neighbouring factory which had not\r\nstruck, and in which he presided over a night class for working men and\r\nwomen. From here we telephoned to Moscow and learned that everything was\r\nquiet in the city. I talked to one of the men in the factory about the\r\nstrike. “It’s all very well for the young men,” one said, “they are\r\nhot-headed and like striking; but we—we have to starve for a month.\r\nThat’s what it means.” Then we went to the school neighbouring the\r\nfactory where the night class was held. There were two rooms, one for\r\nmen presided over by the schoolmaster and one for women presided over by\r\nhis wife. They had a lesson of two hours in reading, writing, and\r\narithmetic. The men came to be taught in separate batches; one batch\r\ncoming one week, one another. This day there were five men and two boys\r\nand six women. The men were reading a story about a bear—rather a\r\ntedious tale. “Yes, we are reading,” one of them said to me, “and we\r\nunderstand some of it.” That was, at any rate, consoling. They read to\r\nthemselves first, then aloud in turn, standing up, and then they were\r\nasked to tell what they had read in their own words. They read\r\nhaltingly, with difficulty grasping familiar words. They related\r\nfluently, except one man, who said he could remember nothing whatsoever\r\nabout the doings of the bear. One little boy was doing with lightning\r\nrapidity those kind of sums which, by giving you too many data and not\r\nenough—a superabundance of detail, leaving out the all that appears so\r\nimperatively necessary—seem to some minds peculiarly insoluble. The sum\r\nin question stated that a factory consisted of 770 hands—men, women, and\r\nchildren, and that the men received half as much again as the women, &c.\r\nThat particular proportion of wages seems to exist in the arithmetic\r\nbooks of all countries to the despair of the non-mathematical, and the\r\nlittle boy insisted on my following every step of his process of\r\nreckoning; but not even he with the wisdom and sympathy of babes\r\nsucceeded in teaching me how to do that kind of sum. He afterwards wrote\r\nin a copybook pages of declensions of Russian nouns and adjectives. Here\r\nI found I could help him and I saved him some trouble by dictating them\r\nto him; though every now and then we had some slight doubt and\r\ndiscussion about the genitive plural. In the woman’s class, one girl\r\nexplained to us, with tears in her eyes, how difficult it was for her to\r\nattend this class. Her fellow-workers laughed at her for it, and at home\r\nthey told her that a woman’s place was to be at work and not to meddle\r\nwith books. Those who attend this school show that they are really\r\nanxious to learn, as the effort and self-sacrifice needed are great.\r\n\r\nWe stayed till the end of the lesson and then we went home, where an\r\nexcellent supper of eggs, &c., was awaiting us. We found the two old\r\nmaids and their first cousin, who told us she was about to go to law for\r\na legacy of 100,000 roubles which had been left her, but which was\r\ndisputed by a more distant relation on the mother’s side. We talked of\r\nlaw suits and politics and miracles, and real and false faith-healers,\r\ntill bedtime came. A bed was made for me alongside of the stove. Made is\r\nthe right word, for it was literally built up before my eyes. A sleeping\r\nplace was also made for the coachman on the floor of the small\r\nante-room; then the rest of the company disappeared to sleep. I say\r\ndisappeared, because I literally do not know where in this small\r\ninterior there was room for them to sleep. They consisted of the two old\r\nmaids, their niece and her little girl, aged three, and another little\r\ngirl, aged seven. My travelling companion slept in the room, but the\r\nrest disappeared, I suppose on the top of the stove, only it seemed to\r\nreach the ceiling; somewhere they were, for the little girl, excited by\r\nthe events of the day, sang snatches of song till a late hour in the\r\nnight. The next morning, after I got up, the room was transformed from a\r\nbedroom into a dining-room and aired, breakfast was served, and at ten\r\nwe started back again in the snow to Moscow.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd we arrived in the town at one o’clock. The streets of the\r\nsuburbs seemed to be unusually still. My companion said to me: “How\r\nquiet the streets are, but it seems to me an uncanny, evil quietness.”\r\nMy companion lived in the Lobkovski Pereoolok, and I had the day before\r\nsent my things from the hotel to an apartment in the adjoining street,\r\nthe Mwilnikov. When we arrived at the entrance of these streets we found\r\nthem blocked by a crowd and guarded by police and dragoons. We got\r\nthrough the other end of the streets, and we were told that the night\r\nbefore Fielder’s School, which is a large building at the corner of\r\nthese two streets, had been the scene of a revolutionary meeting; that\r\nthe revolutionaries had been surrounded in this house, had refused to\r\nsurrender, had thrown a bomb at an officer and killed him, had been\r\nfired at by artillery, and had finally surrendered after killing one\r\nofficer and five men, with 17 casualties—15 wounded and two killed. All\r\nthis had happened in my very street during my absence. An hour later we\r\nagain heard a noise of guns, and the armed rising (of which some of the\r\nleaders, who were to have seized the Governor-General of the town and\r\nset up a provisional Government, had been arrested the night before in\r\nmy street) had nevertheless broken out in all parts of the town. A\r\nlittle later I saw a crowd of people on foot and in sledges flying in\r\npanic down the street shouting “Kazaki!” I heard and saw nothing else of\r\nany interest during the day. There were crowds of people in the streets\r\ntill nightfall.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, Christmas Eve, I drove to the hotel in the centre of Moscow\r\nto see a friend. The aspect of the town was extraordinary. The streets\r\nwere full of people—_flâneurs_ who were either walking about or gathered\r\ntogether in small and large groups at the street corners. Distant, and\r\nsometimes quite near, sounds of firing were audible, and nobody seemed\r\nto care a scrap; they were everywhere talking, discussing, and laughing.\r\nImagine the difference between this and the scenes described in Paris\r\nduring the street fighting in ’32, ’48, and ’71.\r\n\r\nPeople went about their business just as usual. If there was a barricade\r\nthey drove round it. The cabmen never dreamt of not going anywhere,\r\nalthough one said to me that it was very frightening. Moreover, an\r\ninsuperable curiosity seemed to lead them to go and look where things\r\nwere happening. Several were killed in this way. On the other hand, at\r\nthe slightest approach of troops they ran in panic like hares, although\r\nthe troops do not do the passers-by any mischief. Two or three times I\r\nhave been walking in the streets when dragoons galloped past, and come\r\nto no harm. We heard shots all the time, and met the same groups of\r\npeople and passed two barricades. The barricades are mostly not like\r\nthose of the Faubourg St. Antoine, but small impediments made of\r\nbranches and an overturned sledge; they are put there to annoy and wear\r\nout the troops and not to stand siege. The method of warfare that the\r\nrevolutionaries have adopted is a guerilla warfare of the streets. They\r\nfire or throw bombs and rapidly disperse; they have made some attempts\r\nto seize the Nikolaiev Railway Station, but have in all cases been\r\nrepulsed. The attitude of the man in the street is curious: sometimes he\r\nis indignant with the strikers, sometimes indignant with the Government.\r\nIf you ask a person of revolutionary sympathies he will tell you that\r\nsympathy is entirely with the revolution; if you ask a person of\r\nmoderate principles he will tell you that the “people” are indignant\r\nwith the strikers; but the attitude of the average man in the street\r\nseems to me one of sceptical indifference in spite of all, in spite of\r\ntrade ceasing, houses being fired at, and the hospitals being full to\r\noverflowing of dead and wounded. The fact is that disorders have lost\r\ntheir first power of creating an impression; they have become everyday\r\noccurrences.\r\n\r\nHere are various remarks I heard. One man, a commissionaire, asked\r\nwhether I thought it was right to fire on the revolutionaries. I\r\nhesitated, gathering my thoughts to explain that I thought that they\r\nthoroughly deserved it since they began it, but that the Government\r\nnevertheless had brought it about by their dilatoriness. (This is\r\nexactly what I think.) Misunderstanding my hesitation, he said: “Surely\r\nyou, a _foreigner_, need not mind saying what you think, and you know it\r\nis wrong.” (This was curious, because these people, commissionaires,\r\nporters, &c., are often reactionary.) A cabman said to me: “Who do you\r\nthink will get the best of it?” I said, “I don’t know, what do you\r\nthink?” “Nothing will come of it,” he said. “There will still be rich\r\npeople like you and poor people like me, and whether the Government is\r\nin the hands of the _chinovniks_ or the students is all one and the\r\nsame.” Another man, a porter, an ex-soldier, said it was awful. You\r\ncouldn’t go anywhere or drive anywhere without risking being killed.\r\nSoldiers came back from the war and were killed in the streets. A bullet\r\ncame, and then the man was done for. Another man, a kind of railway\r\nemployee, said that the Russians had no stamina, that the Poles would\r\nnever give in, but the Russians would directly. Another man, fond of\r\nparadox, said to me that he hoped all the fanatics would be shot, and\r\nthat then the Government would be upset. A policeman was guarding the\r\nstreet which led to the hotel. I asked if I could pass. “How could I not\r\nlet a Barine with whom I am acquainted pass?” he said. Then a baker’s\r\nboy came up with a tray of rolls on his head, also asking to pass—to go\r\nto the hotel. After some discussion the policeman let him go, but\r\nsuddenly said, “Or are you a rascal?” Then I asked him what he thought\r\nof it all. He said: “We fire as little as possible. They are fools.” The\r\nfact is that among the wealthier and educated classes the feeling is\r\neither one of intense sympathy or violent indignation with the\r\nrevolutionaries; among the lower classes it is a feeling of sceptical\r\nresignation or indifference. “Things are bad—nothing will come of it for\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n                                                        _Christmas Day._\r\n\r\nAt midnight the windows of our house had been rattled by the firing of\r\nguns somewhere near; but on Christmas morning (this is not the Russian\r\nChristmas) one was able to get about. I drove down one of the principal\r\nstreets, the Kouznetski Most, into another large street, the Neglinii\r\nProiesd (as if it were down Bond Street into Piccadilly), when suddenly\r\nin a flash all the cabs began to drive fast up the street. My cab went\r\non. He was inquisitive. We saw nothing. He shouted to another cab,\r\nasking him what was the matter. No answer. We went a little further\r\ndown, when along the Neglinii Proiesd we saw a patrol and guns\r\nadvancing. “Go back,” shouted one of the soldiers, waving his rifle—and\r\naway we went. Later, I believe there was firing there. Further along we\r\nmet more patrols and ambulances. The shops are not only shut but boarded\r\nup.\r\n\r\nNext day I walked to the Nikolaiev Station in the afternoon. It is from\r\nhere that the trains go to St. Petersburg; the trains are running now,\r\nbut how the passengers start I don’t know, for it was impossible to get\r\nnear the station. Cabs were galloping away from it, and the square in\r\nfront of it had been cleared by Cossacks. I think it was attacked this\r\nafternoon. I walked into the Riansh Station, which was next door. It was\r\na scene of desolation: empty trains, stacked-up luggage, third-class\r\npassengers encamped in the waiting-room. There was a perpetual noise of\r\nfiring. Practically the town is under martial law. Nobody is allowed to\r\nbe out of doors after nine o’clock under penalty of three months’\r\nimprisonment or 3,000 roubles fine. Householders have been made\r\nresponsible for people firing out of their windows. The idea of\r\ncollective responsibility is a shock to some Russians. During the last\r\ntwenty years the system has led, through the perpetual shifting of\r\nresponsibility, to the annihilation of responsibility; and this in its\r\nturn has produced a revolution of irresponsibility. Some people talk as\r\nif the revolution were an evil element which had sprung from hell\r\nwithout any cause, a sudden visitation like the plague, as if it were\r\nnot the absolutely logical and inevitable result of the particular form\r\nof bad government which has obtained in Russia during the last twenty\r\nyears. These people pass a sponge over this fact. They say to people of\r\nliberal ideas: “You have brought this about,” then, asked if they are in\r\nfavour of the Constitution, assent; which should prove them to be\r\nopportunists. They do not like being called opportunists.\r\n\r\nThis morning, December 27th, there is considerable movement and traffic\r\nin the streets; the small shops are open, and the tobacconists. News has\r\ncome from St. Petersburg of the Electorate Law. The question is now\r\nwhether it will satisfy the people. Firing is still going on; they say a\r\nfactory is being attacked. The troops who were supposed to be\r\ndisaffected have proved absolutely loyal. The one way to make them loyal\r\nwas to throw bombs at them. The policemen are now armed with rifles and\r\nbayonets. I asked an educated man this afternoon if he thought the\r\nElectorate Law would satisfy people. He said he thought not. He said\r\nthat the people demanded a far wider suffrage law. “Are you in favour\r\nyourself of universal suffrage?” I asked. “No,” he answered; “but when I\r\nsee that the whole people demand it, I submit to the majority. The\r\nGovernment has as yet _given_ nothing; everything has been torn from it,\r\nand more will have to be torn from it.” One learns here at any rate not\r\nto generalise and not to prophesy. A cabman said this afternoon: “There\r\nis an illness abroad, we are sick, it will pass—but God remains.” I\r\nagree with him.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that it is a case of bricks falling out of a wall until\r\nthe wall falls down, but of a young tree shedding bark. The illness,\r\nhowever, is a severe one, and it is idle to blame the patient for the\r\nviolence of his symptoms and the doctor for the inadequacy of his\r\nremedies. The people to blame are those who made the patient ill by\r\nfeeding him on poison. And some of these have already met with their\r\njust reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n                        MOSCOW AFTER THE RISING\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              MOSCOW, _January 1, 1906_.\r\n\r\nIf it is difficult—and it seems to be difficult to the verge of\r\nimpossibility—for the historian of the present day to write impartially\r\nabout political movements which happened in the days of Queen Elizabeth\r\nand of Mary Queen of Scots, how infinitely more difficult must it be to\r\narrive at an impartial view of events when one is oneself in the centre\r\nof them and living among the actors who are contributing to what is\r\nafterwards called history! The historian solves the question by frankly\r\naffiliating himself to one side (like Froude or Macaulay or Taine), and\r\nhe is probably right in doing this; I notice, also, that our most\r\neminent correspondents do the same. Therefore I confess at once that I\r\nam in no way free from prejudices, and I make no pretence of invincible\r\nimpartiality; only I have seen and heard enough of both sides to learn\r\none thing—that the two parties who are now engaged in strife in Russia\r\nare both right or both wrong. I will try to the best of my ability to\r\nstifle my own feelings, and, like a piece of blotting-paper which\r\nabsorbs red or black ink indiscriminately, try to reproduce as best I\r\ncan fragments of what I absorb.\r\n\r\nThe strike is over, although I believe some revolutionaries are still\r\nholding out in a factory near the Zoological Gardens. The shops are\r\nopen, the electric light is shining on the hard, snowy, ice-cold\r\nstreets, and life is going on, in the Russian expression, in its old\r\nrut. I suppose the first question which will present itself to people\r\nabroad anxious for information is: What did it all amount to? The second\r\nquestion: What is the result of it? The third is possibly: What do the\r\npeople in Moscow, the inhabitant, the man in the street, think of it?\r\nPractically, it did not amount to very much; a general strike was\r\nproclaimed which was to take place all over Russia with the object of\r\nobtaining universal suffrage. The strike was not universal. It was\r\nclosely followed by an armed rising of the revolutionary party in Moscow\r\nwith the object of arresting the Governor-General and establishing a\r\ntemporary Government. It resulted in complete and utter failure; and\r\nthis seems to point to one of two things: either that the revolutionary\r\nparty is less well organised than we supposed it to be, or that it\r\nwrongly gauged popular feeling and no longer found such strong support\r\nin public opinion as it did before. If it be judged by its recent action\r\nit cannot be said to have given proof of any good organisation, since it\r\nwas obviously a mistake to foment a movement among the military—using\r\neconomic needs and demands as a weapon—a week before the strike began.\r\nThe economic demands were made by the soldiers, and satisfied\r\nimmediately, and their mutiny ceased. It is nonsense to pretend that the\r\nsoldiers have any revolutionary tendencies, and the revolutionaries made\r\na great mistake in trying to undermine their belief in the Emperor. The\r\nsame thing holds good as regards the peasants; and only yesterday a\r\nperson with ultra-Radical convictions said to me: “The peasant, if he is\r\nhungry, can easily be made to loot and burn; but if he is replete he\r\nwill send anybody who talks politics to him to the devil, and if any one\r\nattacks the Emperor before him he will tear him to pieces; possibly in\r\ntwenty or thirty years things will be different and he will be an\r\nenlightened man; at present he is not, and there is no use in not facing\r\nthe fact. The revolutionaries have made a cardinal error in attacking\r\nthe peasants’ and the soldiers’ only ideal—call it ideal, idol, or what\r\nyou like.” Therefore I say that in this case the behaviour of the\r\nrevolutionaries showed neither insight nor statesmanship nor good\r\norganisation. It is possible, of course, that the strike may have been\r\nbrought about, as I wrote before, by the workmen forcing the leaders’\r\nhands, being unwilling to starve for a month but ready to rise in arms\r\nand fight for several days.\r\n\r\nNow, as to what actually happened. With regard to the loss of life most\r\npeople seem to be agreed in thinking that neither the revolutionaries\r\nnor the soldiers suffered very great losses, but that nine-tenths of the\r\npeople killed were the onlookers among the public. Sometimes, of course,\r\nit was their own fault; sometimes it was not. When firing was going on\r\nit was as a rule difficult to get anywhere near it because the police\r\nwarned you “off the course.” But then one must take into account that\r\nthe streets in which the firing happened were inhabited, and that\r\nsometimes the unfortunate inhabitants were shot through no fault of\r\ntheir own. I think it is quite evident that there was a great deal of\r\nentirely unnecessary and absolutely futile bombarding of private houses.\r\nNo doubt the revolutionaries fired from such houses; but they fired and\r\nwent away, and then the house was battered and the revolutionaries were\r\nnot caught. It must not be thought that Moscow is a heap of cinders as\r\nin 1812. For the most part the actual traces of bombardment are slight.\r\nThe damage done to Fielder’s School, for instance, which is in my\r\nstreet, amounts to this: that the windows are broken and there is one\r\nhole in the wall. On the other hand, several houses have been entirely\r\ndestroyed, and the printing offices of the _Russkoe Slovo_ and some\r\nfactories burnt—it is difficult to ascertain by which side, but possibly\r\nby both. This afternoon I went to a hospital to see some wounded\r\nsoldiers, and in one of the wards the windows had been shattered by a\r\nbullet which had lodged in the cornice. Nothing will prevent me from\r\nbelieving that it must be possible to ascertain whether you are firing\r\nat a hospital, which is in one of the big streets of the town, or not.\r\nThe complaints of the inhabitants are universal. Some blame the soldiers\r\nand some blame the revolutionaries, and one hears bitter stories from\r\nboth parties about the conduct of their adversaries. Those on the\r\nGovernment side say: “What can you do against guerilla bands who dart\r\nround corners, shoot policemen, and run away?” The others say: “What can\r\nyou think of people who shoot down the Red Cross doctors and bombard\r\nprivate houses?” Again, the supporters of the Government say the\r\nrevolutionaries use and exploit the Red Cross and, under the guise of\r\nRed Cross men, do murder. The others say again “The Government hires a\r\nMilitia drawn from the Black Hundred to shoot indiscriminately from the\r\ntops of church steeples.” Again you hear a story like this (I do not\r\nvouch for its truth): A student was surrounded by a mob, and on the\r\npoint of being lynched, when he was rescued by a policeman, and on the\r\nway to the police station he shot the policeman. Or you hear that a\r\nnumber of peaceable citizens were walking up a street when the soldiery\r\nsuddenly appeared and fired up the street indiscriminately. It must be\r\nborne in mind that the people of Moscow had been fully warned to stay at\r\nhome as much as possible, that after six o’clock it was dangerous to go\r\nout, and that groups of three or more people would be fired on at sight,\r\nsince the revolutionaries, who wear no uniform and are indistinguishable\r\nfrom the ordinary passer-by, took shelter among such groups. A man in a\r\nfur coat may, for all you know, have his pockets full of bombs. I know\r\nthree cases of people being accidentally killed: a little boy ran out of\r\nhis house, not into the street, but into the yard of his house to make a\r\nslide. As he did so he was shot by a stray bullet. The proprietor of the\r\nErmitage Restaurant was also shot on his doorstep by a stray bullet.\r\nThirdly, Metrofan, a kind of porter who was a friend of mine, and about\r\nwhom I wrote in my last letter, has disappeared, and is not to be found\r\nin any of the hospitals. He was the man—an ex-soldier—who said that it\r\nwas impossible to walk about safely (I laughed at him as he said it),\r\nand if he has been killed—which I trust is not true—he seems to have had\r\nthe clearest presentiment of his fate. He was sent with a letter to a\r\nplace where firing was going on. It is just this sort of people who\r\nsuffered most: door-keepers and commissionaires who had to go about\r\ntheir ordinary business and take the risk of being in dangerous places.\r\nOne extraordinarily typical incident was told me by an eye-witness. A\r\nman was walking up the Neglinii Proiesd, a big street, in which the\r\nErmitage Restaurant is situated; he was deaf and could not hear the\r\nnoise of the firing; after a time he was wounded in the leg. He saw the\r\nblood trickling on the snow, and he made the sign of the cross and lay\r\ndown and folded his arms together, resigning himself to fate. After a\r\ntime a poodle came along the street and began sniffing at his head; this\r\nwas more than he could bear, and he jumped up again and, not noticing\r\nanything particular going on, pursued his way quietly home. I think the\r\npolice behaved exceedingly well and the soldiers as well as could be\r\nexpected. They were not, of course, responsible for indiscriminate\r\nbombardments, which were entirely due to the military in authority, and\r\nnot, as is loosely stated, to the Governor-General, Admiral Dubassov. In\r\nsome cases the authorities showed almost inspired ineptness. For\r\ninstance, there is a large weaving factory in Moscow, the workmen of\r\nwhich had not struck. The police, with Cossacks, made a raid on it at\r\nnight to search for arms. They found none; they ransacked the barracks\r\nof the men, and the men among whose chattels they found leaflets or any\r\npapers they beat. On the next day two-thirds of these men went on\r\nstrike. This happened yesterday. Another case of the sort of thing which\r\nhappens is worth mentioning. There is a house in which a Jew, a Liberal\r\nfamily, and a rich pork butcher dwell. The Liberal family have a boy of\r\ntwelve, who had been talking about the revolution with pardonable boyish\r\nexcess of zeal. The pork butcher said that the whole place was going to\r\nbe blown up. On the following day soldiers arrived and began to shoot at\r\nthe house. The owner, on inquiring the reason, received the reply: “You\r\nhave got a Jew in the house, and we shall go on firing till you give us\r\na nachai (a _pourboire_).” They did this every day. What the trouble\r\nreally amounted to was this: an organised street fight, which lasted a\r\nweek (nothing at all approaching either 1832 or 1848 or 1871 in Paris),\r\nand which caused a vast deal of damage to the inhabitants, and inflicted\r\non them a considerable loss of life, besides pecuniary losses resulting\r\nfrom the stoppage of trade, &c. In the Paris Commune it should be\r\nremembered that a great many people were shot in cold blood after it was\r\nover, as a punishment, quite apart from the losses which occurred during\r\nthe fighting.\r\n\r\nI am perfectly convinced, perhaps wrongly, that the Government is in\r\nreality responsible for the troubles, owing to its dilatoriness in\r\nmaking laws. I know the answer to this. It is said: “How can you carry\r\nout reforms when the people won’t let you do so—when the moment they are\r\nundertaken a series of strikes and disturbances begin, and public\r\nservants behave in a manner which would not for a moment be tolerated in\r\nthe most progressive of Western nations?” On the other hand it is\r\nobvious that all the strikes and disturbances which occurred during last\r\nyear arose from the fact of the delay in the granting of reforms. And\r\nnow when the people see this delay still existing, and, rightly or\r\nwrongly, argue that nothing has been given them till they extorted it,\r\nit is perhaps natural that their frame of mind should be one of excited\r\nexasperation. The Government expects them to behave reasonably, act\r\nreasonably, and think reasonably. They are in a frame of mind when\r\nreasonable action or thought is difficult of attainment, and the cause\r\nof their demented attitude is the action of the Government in the past.\r\nI do not defend them, but I understand them. My heart is with them; my\r\nhead is against them. Their situation seems to me to resemble that of a\r\nman who for years has been kept on the verge of starvation, and is\r\nsuddenly given champagne (liberty of the Press), and is promised a fixed\r\nand daily system of meals, consisting of wholesome food (Parliament).\r\nThen the same people who starved him begin to be dilatory in starting\r\nhis new _régime_. Is it not easy to understand that the conduct of such\r\na man would not be likely to be reasonable? I hope that one of the\r\nresults of the events in Moscow will be to make the Government realise\r\nthe pressing necessity of taking some steps to win the confidence of all\r\nthat is “Moderate” in Russia. I hope also that it will impress on all\r\nthe “Moderates” the necessity of combination and co-operation; because\r\nthe revolutionaries declare that they will strike again in March if they\r\ndo not get what they wish, and that the events of Moscow will be\r\nrepeated in St. Petersburg. If they decide on this, no amount of arrests\r\nand repression will prevent them, and if the private houses of St.\r\nPetersburg are to be subjected to indiscriminate bombardment the outlook\r\nis indeed serious. Other results are these. The soldiers have been\r\nproved to be loyal, but a Government cannot subsist on bayonets alone.\r\nAgain, there will be a large number of workmen out of work; these men\r\nwhen they go back to their villages will be met with some such remarks\r\nas these: “No money. You struck? What for? Get out.”\r\n\r\nThese two last mentioned facts should make strikes in the future more\r\ndifficult. Some people say that nothing will pacify the revolutionaries;\r\npossibly, but the important question is, how far will the\r\nrevolutionaries be supported by public opinion? That depends entirely on\r\nthe action of the Government. It is certainly untrue to say that public\r\nopinion in Moscow was against the revolutionaries, if it is an\r\nexaggeration to say that it supported them. This leads us to another\r\nquestion: What do the people here think of it all? In answer I can only\r\nrepeat what I said in my last letter: there exists violent and bitter\r\npartisanship on both sides; there exists also a large class of onlookers\r\nwhich is half-indifferent, half-resigned, and half-sceptical—in the main\r\nindifferent. But if one is to go by facts one can point to the small\r\ncrowd—a selected and, in some parts, I believe, a paid crowd of men—who\r\nattended the manifestation for the Emperor’s birthday, the vast crowd\r\nwhich attended Bauman’s funeral, and the great numbers of working men\r\nand others who have been fighting against the Government these last few\r\ndays. When I was talking to the wounded soldiers to-day in the hospital\r\nthey told me that they had heard from men returning from the Far East\r\nthat the reports of a large mutiny in the Army there were untrue, that\r\nthere had been discontent about not coming home and a small rising, but\r\nnothing like what was reported. One man said to me: “We may ask for more\r\nsoup and meat, but is it likely we are going to mutiny for that? They\r\nwill give us more if we ask for it; soldiers can’t strike, it is as if\r\nthe whole population were to strike.” I refrained from pointing out that\r\nthis is what exactly had occurred in October. I answered by my simile of\r\nthe starving man who is suddenly given champagne.\r\n\r\nTo-day I tried the Sortes Virgilianæ with regard to the present\r\nsituation and the chief actors of the drama of Russia. The result was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. (For Count Witte)\r\n\r\n                       “dextra discedens impulit altam\r\n                 Haud ignara modi puppim.”—Æ. x. 245.\r\n\r\n2. (The general situation)\r\n\r\n           “Extemplo turbati animi, concussaque vulgi\r\n           Pectora, et arrectæ stimulis haud mollibus iræ.\r\n           Arma manu trepidi poscunt; fremit arma juventus,\r\n           Flent mæsti mussantque patres. Hic undique clamor\r\n           Dissensu vario magnus se tollit in auras.”\r\n\r\n           Æ. xi. 451.\r\n\r\n                                                          _January 2nd._\r\n\r\nI went this afternoon, for the second time to-day, to the Soldiers’\r\nHospital. One of them asked me whether Paris was in Turkey. He said the\r\nTurks were nice. Another asked me whether there wasn’t a place where it\r\nwas all water. I described Venice as best I could. On my way to the\r\nhospital I went to the Hôtel Dresden. Metrofan has been killed. His\r\nsister and his wife arrived in tears and in a terrible state. He was\r\nshot by a shell.\r\n\r\n                                                          _January 3rd._\r\n\r\nIn the hospital a soldier told me two fairy tales; one was about a\r\nwizard, and the other was in octosyllabic verse. It took twenty-five\r\nminutes to tell. When he alluded to the “cloak of darkness” he called it\r\na “waterproof” cloak.\r\n\r\n                                                          _January 4th._\r\n\r\nA cabman who drove me home last night drove me again to-day. He said it\r\nwas lucky I had taken him yesterday, because he had not had another\r\nfare; and that he had told his comrades all about it, and had said he\r\nwould have been lost had not the Lord sent him a Barine, and such a\r\nBarine too! (I had heavily overpaid him.) I said, “I suppose you said,\r\n‘God sent you a fool.’” “Oh! Barine, don’t offend God,” he answered. The\r\ncabmen are a constant source of amusement to me here. The other day,\r\nwhen I was driving, the cabman stopped and made another one stop to\r\nadmire his horse. After we drove on again, we kept on meeting again, and\r\nevery time we met we slowed down, and the conversation about the horse\r\nand how much it had cost was continued.\r\n\r\n                                                          _January 5th._\r\n\r\nI taught a soldier at the hospital the Latin alphabet. He said he would\r\nwrite me a letter soon in Latin letters; only he did not understand the\r\nuse of the letters W and X; but he added, I will somehow or other find\r\nletters which will serve as equivalents to these in the Russian\r\nalphabet.\r\n\r\nFrom having had much conversation with people who defend the\r\nrevolutionaries with what seems to me nonsensical exaggeration, I feel a\r\nwave of reaction coming over me. I can never resist this subtle spirit\r\nof contradiction when I am with people who belong to a party, and hear\r\nthem express party feeling in unmeasured and exaggerated terms. If I am\r\nwith violent Conservatives a subtle spirit of Liberalism rises within\r\nme, and _vice versâ_. Besides this, I hate political _parties_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n                          THE “INTELLIGENZIA”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          _January 6th._\r\n\r\nI arrived at St. Petersburg this morning. I have been trying to\r\nformulate my reactionary feelings. I will put them on paper; although I\r\nknow I shall only have to spend a very short time with real\r\nreactionaries to be driven straight back into the opposite camp. But\r\nlately at Moscow I have had a heavy dose of anti-governmental\r\nunfairness. Too heavy for the present, although perhaps I shall one day\r\nin the future think that it was not unfair at all.\r\n\r\nI asked a man the other day, who is employed in the “Zemstva,” what\r\nparty he belonged to. “I belong to the party of common sense,” he\r\nanswered; “unfortunately it does not exist.” This exactly sums up, I\r\nthink, the impression that any impartial observer must necessarily\r\nderive from the present situation in Russia. Common sense has gone.\r\nHysteria and undisciplined rant have taken its place.\r\n\r\nFirst, the revolutionaries. There are two kinds of revolutionaries: the\r\nactive, who throw bombs at policemen and soldiers, who are ready to dare\r\nanything and sacrifice themselves; and the passive revolutionaries who\r\nsit at home and sympathise and talk a great deal. What is their point of\r\nview?\r\n\r\n1. They consider that all classes who are not definitely enrolled under\r\ntheir flag are violent reactionaries and are fit to be classed with the\r\n“Black Hundred.” The Duma that is to be, they say, will be a “Black\r\nHundred” Duma; the present Government is purely and simply a reactionary\r\nGovernment composed of bureaucrats, and no good can come to Russia until\r\nthe ulcer is pierced to the core, and all bureaucrats, together with the\r\nEmperor and all his family, and all his Court, are removed. The\r\nobjection that the present Government is merely temporary until the Duma\r\nassembles, they meet with the counterargument that the Government, with\r\nthe franchise law as it is, is capable of influencing the elections to\r\nany extent, and that the result will be a reactionary Duma.\r\n\r\n2. The second question is—What do they want? They say they want a\r\nConstituent Assembly and universal suffrage, and no doubt they do want\r\nthis. But whether they would be satisfied with this if they were given\r\nit is another question. Personally, my experience has so far led me to\r\nbelieve that they would in no wise be satisfied with this; I would lay\r\nodds to this effect. I may, no doubt, be mistaken. I believe what they\r\nreally want is for Russia to become a federation of autonomous States\r\nrepresented by a Republic. Some of the more moderate are either opposed\r\nto this or refrain from stating any opinion in favour of it, owing to\r\nthe fact that they know that the Army and ninety million peasants are\r\nready to kill any one within reach if the “Gasudar” is to be tampered\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThey fear that if the question of a Republic is brought forward there\r\nwill be a general massacre of the educated bourgeoisie, the so-called\r\n“Intelligenzia.” Nothing is more probable. Some people say that nothing\r\nwill really change the attitude of these people: no more than any amount\r\nof measures which one of Lord Salisbury’s Cabinets might have adopted\r\nwould have changed the opinion of the supporters of Mr. Gladstone or Sir\r\nHenry Campbell-Bannerman, or _vice versâ_. That it is utterly futile to\r\nexpect common sense or common fairness from them. That they have their\r\nparty feeling, to which they are ready to sacrifice everything, and that\r\nit is infinitely stronger and more bitter, and necessarily stronger and\r\nmore bitter, than anything of which we have had experience in England\r\nduring the last century.\r\n\r\nSome people object that they understand the militant revolutionaries\r\nbeing in this frame of mind, but they do not understand the more\r\nintelligent passive and detached supporters of the advanced party\r\nsharing such childish views. The more intelligent and detached\r\nsupporters are even more violent in their talk than the militant\r\nfighters. At present the kind of argument one hears used is like the\r\nfollowing, which I have heard with my own ears. I have heard intelligent\r\ncultivated people say: “How wicked and cowardly of the Government to\r\nfire upon the revolutionaries, since they have guns and the\r\nrevolutionaries haven’t got any.” The English mind, which, be it Liberal\r\nor Conservative, tends to common sense, revolts against such reasoning.\r\nIt is rare to find in Russia an Englishman who sympathises with the\r\nrevolutionaries. English common sense revolts at the hysterical\r\nimpatience which demands the immediate fulfilment of measures more\r\nradical and socialist than exist in any European state, and the common\r\nBritish sense of fairness is violated at hearing of the wanton murder of\r\npolicemen, who earn a poor living and are in no way responsible for the\r\nmisdeeds of the Government, exalted as a patriotic execution worthy of\r\nHarmodius and Aristogiton.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I think we fail—I am alluding to Englishmen who visit\r\nRussia, and not to those who live here permanently—to realise that the\r\nRussians have been up to now destitute of certain guarantees which\r\nEnglishmen regard as a matter of course, and that they do not consider\r\nthey have obtained these guarantees yet; and here it is difficult to\r\ncontradict them.\r\n\r\nLately an incident happened which has proved a kind of focussing glass\r\nconcentrating the opinions of both parties. The revolutionaries walked\r\ninto the house of the head of the detective police service, dragged him\r\nfrom his family circle and shot him. Somewhat later a police officer\r\nnamed Ermolov walked into the house of a doctor and shot him before his\r\nwife’s eyes. The officer gave himself up to the authorities and said his\r\nact was due to momentary aberration. Around these incidents both parties\r\nwage a war of tongues. The sympathisers with the revolutionaries talk of\r\nthe martyrdom of the doctor; whereas their opponents say that the fuss\r\nthey are making is unjustifiable since they did the very same thing.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think that the weak side of the Government case is this:\r\nthat the revolutionaries are sure of punishment if caught; whereas the\r\nofficial who does wrong is not punished, and his wrong-doing is surely\r\nmore heinous because he is the representative of the law. On the other\r\nhand I think the wanton murder of policemen has nothing of the heroic in\r\nit, and when I hear it spoken of in terms of admiration I am disgusted.\r\n\r\nAs to the opponents of the revolutionaries, they also attack the\r\nGovernment, and especially Count Witte. They say that the only\r\nsupporters of Count Witte are foreigners. The _Slovo_ newspaper said,\r\nfor instance, that foreigners only supported Count Witte because they\r\ndesired the enfeeblement of Russia. But reactionaries say that the\r\nRussian revolution is entirely fostered and supported by a foreign\r\nGovernment. Now it cannot be to the French Government’s interest for\r\nRussia’s credit to collapse, nor can it be to the German Government’s\r\ninterest for Russia to become a federation of autonomous States;\r\ntherefore it must be the English Government, and, when pressed, they\r\nadmit this. But if the English Press is trying to ruin Russia by\r\nsupporting Count Witte, it is obvious that it cannot be at the same time\r\ntrying to ruin Russia by supporting the revolutionaries. One of these\r\ntwo statements must be untrue; quite apart from the question as to\r\nwhether the collapse of Russia’s credit would prove a material advantage\r\nto England. The fact is that the reactionaries who talk in this strain\r\nare politically limited in their ideas; they know practically nothing\r\neither of England or of any other country, they merely repeat old\r\ncatchwords and musty traditions which have been proved to be absurd.\r\n\r\nNow apart from these reactionary Jingoes, who are really of no\r\nimportance whatsoever now, there is a large class of people who six\r\nmonths ago would have been called red revolutionaries, and who now call\r\nthemselves “Moderates,” and are called by the revolutionaries members of\r\nthe “Black Gang.”\r\n\r\nThese people wish for the most speedy fulfilment of the Manifesto of the\r\n17th of October; they blame the Government for its delay in making laws,\r\nand they blame Count Witte. But they look upon the Duma as being\r\ncompetent to settle the various aspirations of the various parties. They\r\nshould be a strong party; the trouble is that up to the present time\r\nthey have never seen their way either to support the Government or to\r\nform a homogeneous party among themselves. It is possible that the\r\nrecent events at Moscow may have the effect of causing them to coalesce.\r\nIt is to be hoped that this will happen; for in them lies the safe _via\r\nmedia_ between the two extremes of reaction and anarchy.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that all these various parties are united with regard\r\nto one detail, that is in their blame of Count Witte. It is also worth\r\nmentioning that in all the innumerable attacks made on Count Witte\r\nnobody has so far had the ingenuity or the perspicacity to name his\r\npossible successor. Would the revolutionaries really like him to go? I\r\ndoubt it. They would have, in the first place, nobody to attack; in the\r\nsecond place, they would risk having a more reactionary successor. For\r\nthat reason I have never up to now believed in any of the countless\r\nreports regarding Count Witte’s immediate resignation.\r\n\r\nAt present the Government is feeling extremely confident owing to the\r\nway in which recent events have turned out; the revolutionaries also\r\nprofess to be in no wise disheartened; they say that the Moscow rising\r\nis nothing in comparison with what they will do in March, and that\r\nseeing that they have exhausted the efficacy of strikes and armed\r\nrisings they will adopt the method of terrorism and blow up Government\r\nbuildings with dynamite (in March). I have heard intelligent\r\nsympathisers with the revolutionaries talking of such a policy with\r\nenthusiasm, saying that this is the only way to deal with the\r\nGovernment, and that the Duma, such as it will be, is not only of no\r\naccount but will never come into existence.\r\n\r\nThese people are members of the Russian “Intelligenzia,” or middle\r\nprofessional class. They have many admirable qualities, and I live among\r\nthem and like them; but I think that sometimes some of their members\r\ntalk most wildly and ought to know better. Up to now, of course, they\r\nhave been carefully prevented by the Government from taking any part in\r\npolitics whatsoever, and they feel now that vast possibilities have been\r\nopened to them; that it is they who made the revolution, and that it is\r\nthey who are going to rule the country.\r\n\r\nOnly at present they have not succeeded in producing a great man. They\r\narrogate to themselves the position of sole spokesmen and\r\nrepresentatives of the Russian people, and at this also common sense\r\nrevolts. For apart from the fact of the peasants distrusting them, and\r\nthe Army hating them, what have they done for Russia? Possibly it was\r\nnot they who brought about the Constitution. They class the whole gentry\r\nand aristocracy with the Bureaucrats under one sweeping ban of blame and\r\nabuse; but the gentry laid the foundations of reform and revolution long\r\nbefore they existed as a class at all (_vide_ the Decembrists, 1825).\r\nMoreover, the gentry gave to Russia Poushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Tolstoi,\r\nTurgeniev, Tchaikovski, and Dostoievski; in fact, her literature, her\r\nart, her music, her poetry; all her great men and men of genius. In the\r\nsphere of the arts they have made Russia hideous by importing a debased\r\n_art nouveau_ from Munich; and in the sphere of literature they have\r\nproduced some excellent writers of short stories. In verse (the verse of\r\nsuch writers as “Skitaletzt” is weaker than the prose of Andreev and\r\nCo.) the English equivalent would be the political poetry of Mr. Alfred\r\nAustin; the political tendencies of the Russian writers, of course,\r\ndiffer widely from that of the English Laureate, whose work, although it\r\nhas met with public recognition, would, perhaps, have made England less\r\nfamous as a literary nation were it the sole representative of our\r\npoetical literature.\r\n\r\nNow that I have disburdened myself on the subject of the unfairness of\r\nthe “Intelligenzia,” I feel better. According to the oriental fashion I\r\nshould at once add counter-arguments giving all that there is to be said\r\nin their favour. This I will do another day.\r\n\r\n                                                 MOSCOW, _January 13th_.\r\n\r\nI came back to Moscow on the 10th. I saw the old year out (it is the\r\nRussian New Year’s Eve) with the kind family who live on the floor above\r\nmine, and with whom I always have my meals. They played Vindt all night.\r\nWhen the New Year came “A happy New Year” was drunk in champagne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n                     THE BEGINNING OF THE REACTION\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 MOSCOW, _January 14th_.\r\n\r\nTo-day is the Russian New Year’s Day. To-day is also Sunday, so it would\r\nseem a fitting occasion to preach a long sermon on Russia. I have been\r\namusing myself by finding suitable texts for such a sermon. They are all\r\nfrom the works of Renan, a man who gave a good deal of thought to the\r\nvarious political movements and phases of the world’s history, and\r\nexpressed himself with that nice lucidity and divine ease which we call\r\na perfect style.\r\n\r\nThe first is this: “La Révolution française fut la gageure d’un petit\r\nnombre d’énergumènes qui réussirent à faire croire qu’ils avaient\r\nentraîné la nation.”\r\n\r\nNo. 2: “Éternelle puérilité des répressions pénales, appliquées aux\r\nchoses de l’âme.”\r\n\r\nNo. 3: “Dans ses accès de vertu, l’homme croit pouvoir se passer\r\nentièrement de l’égoisme et de l’intérêt propre; l’égoisme prend sa\r\nrevanche, en prouvant que l’absolu désintéressement engendre des maux\r\nplus graves que ceux qu’on avait cru éviter par la suppression de la\r\npropriété.”\r\n\r\nThese are my texts, and, as is usually the case when the text is good,\r\nthe sermon is superfluous.\r\n\r\nNew Year’s Day is, we are so often told, a good occasion to look forward\r\nand behind. What, then, is the outlook at present? Life is going on at\r\nSt. Petersburg and Moscow exactly as usual, and here, save in the\r\nsmouldering ruins of the factory of the Presnaya and various broken\r\nwindows and damaged cornices, there is nothing to tell one that anything\r\nunusual has occurred. The Government is said to be confident. Foreign\r\nloans are in the air. The revolutionaries, it is said, have been crushed\r\nand dispersed. Electioneering work is beginning; in fact, all is going\r\nas well as can be expected. That is one view—an optimistic view which I\r\ndo not altogether share. In the first place, when people say that the\r\nRevolutionary Party or its leaders are a minority I would reply by\r\nquoting text No. 1. “Laws, in a country which is following an idea, are\r\nalways made by the minority,” says Renan, immediately before the\r\nsentence I have quoted.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Moscow episode does not seem to me to have affected the\r\nrevolutionary movement in the slightest degree. The numbers of the\r\nkilled among the insurgents were trifling; all the important and real\r\nleaders of the Revolution had left Moscow before this affair, which was,\r\nin fact, conducted by boys and girls; and if a number of boys and girls\r\ncan, at the head of a mass of workmen, bring the garrison to\r\ndistraction, take guns from the troops, and force the authorities to\r\nbombard the houses of the inhabitants without raising universal\r\nindignation, things must be fairly serious.\r\n\r\nTo say that they have alienated public sympathy is certainly untrue; for\r\nalthough they started the fighting, as soon as the authorities answered\r\nwith artillery the common ordinary man in the street began in many cases\r\nto say that it was the fault of the Government and the authorities.\r\nSympathy in Russia is always certain to be with the people who are shot,\r\nbe they right or wrong.\r\n\r\n                   “Whatever happens, we have got\r\n                   The Maxim-gun and they have not.”\r\n\r\nThat is, they argue, the motto of the authorities, and that is exactly\r\nthe sentiment which arouses the indignation of the citizen. A cabman\r\nasked some one the other day when they were going to punish “him.” Who\r\nis “him”? he was asked. “Admiral Dubassov,” was the answer. “Surely the\r\nEmperor will punish him for shooting at the houses.” The energetic\r\nmanner in which the rising was suppressed has, I am told, produced a\r\ngood effect in Europe; doubtless energetic measures were not only\r\nnecessary but imperative in the first instance; whether the continuation\r\nof them now is a mistake or not only the future can show. One fact,\r\nhowever, is certain, and that is that these measures are being conducted\r\nwith the same arbitrariness which has characterised the action of the\r\nRussian police in the past, and are causing intense exasperation. There\r\nis a word in Russian, “Proisvol,” which means acting, like Wordsworth’s\r\nriver, according to your “own sweet will,” unheedful of, and often in\r\ndefiance of, the law. It is precisely this manner of acting which has\r\nbrought about the revolution in Russia. It is against the “Proisvol”\r\nthat all the educated classes and half the official class rebelled. And\r\nit is this very “Proisvol” against which the whole country rose on\r\nstrike, which the Government promised should henceforth disappear, and\r\nwhich is at the present moment triumphantly installed once more as the\r\nruling system.\r\n\r\nOf course it may be objected that anarchy and lawless revolution can\r\nonly be met by severe repression; but the question is: Must it be met by\r\narbitrary and lawless repression? Hang the insurgents if you like, but\r\nwhy shoot a doctor who has got nothing to do with it before you know\r\nanything about him? To stop a newspaper like the _Russkie Viedomosti_,\r\nfor instance, is an act of sheer “Proisvol,” the reason given being that\r\nit had subscription lists for workmen’s unions, which it denies, saying\r\nthat the money was for the wounded. Here I point to my second text. All\r\nthis repression seems to me utterly futile. The future, however, can\r\nshow whether this is indeed so.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime election programmes are appearing. That of the\r\nConstitutional Democrats has come out, and is moderate in tone, although\r\nits clauses are extensive. It insists, among other things, on universal\r\nsuffrage and an eight-hours’ day for the workmen. Here I would point to\r\ntext 3. Everybody whom I have seen in Russia in any way connected with\r\nthe working man is agreed in saying that an eight-hours’ day is an\r\nabsolute impossibility. That a Russian workman’s eight hours means in\r\nreality about six hours. That no factory in Russia could exist on these\r\nterms. The Constitutional Democrats seem in this case to have omitted\r\nthe factor of human egoism and interest.\r\n\r\nOne of the gravest factors of the general situation is that Eastern\r\nSiberia seems to be entirely in the hands of the revolutionaries, who\r\nare apparently managing the railway and everything else with perfect\r\norder, while the troops, anxious only to get home, are taking any\r\nengines they can lay hands on and racing back, one train literally\r\nracing another!\r\n\r\nAltogether it cannot be said that the outlook is particularly cheerful.\r\nThere is one bright point so far, and that is that all parties seem\r\nanxious to convoke the Duma. The Liberals want it, the Conservatives\r\nwant it, the Extreme Radicals sanction the elections. The Radicals say\r\nit will be packed by the Government; but I do not see how this is\r\npossible. They say they will let it meet, and that if it proves “a Black\r\nHundred Duma” they will destroy it. They call everything which is not\r\nRadical “Black Hundred.” But, as I have said before, and as I cannot\r\ntire of saying, it is useless to blame these extreme parties for talking\r\nnonsense. They have been driven to this nonsense by the still greater\r\nwant of sense on the part of the Government of Russia during the last\r\ntwenty years, and in wanting to wipe out this system altogether they\r\nare, after all, in the right. Unfair they may be, hysterical, and\r\nabsurd. So were the Jacobins; but the absurdity, extravagance, and\r\nviolence of the Jacobins were only the logical result of the “Ancien\r\nRégime.” So it is here, although it is misleading to compare the present\r\nmovement in Russia with the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nAnd behind all the rumours and conflicts of various parties looms the\r\nagrarian question; the ninety million peasants who till the land in the\r\nsame manner in which they tilled it four hundred years ago; whose land\r\nfrom generation to generation dwindles by partition, while the\r\npopulation increases. How and when is this question going to be solved?\r\nIt can only be solved by the education of the peasants themselves; but\r\nthe question is what can be done to gain time and to make this education\r\npossible. My outlook is, perhaps, too pessimistic. I do not know. I only\r\nfeel that the whole revolutionary movement is beyond all forces of\r\ncontrol, and that no measures in the world can put it back now; whether\r\nit could by wisdom be led into safe channels is another question. Such a\r\nthing has seldom been seen in the history of the world, and it is, after\r\nall, only out of the past that we make the future.\r\n\r\nTo get rid of these gloomy ideas I went to the hospital, where New\r\nYear’s Day was celebrated with great gusto; there was a Christmas-tree,\r\ndancing and song, and it was delightful to see a little tiny boy and a\r\nhuge soldier dancing opposite each other. The Russian peasants dance to\r\neach other, and separately, of course, like Highlanders when they dance\r\na reel or a schottische. It was gay and yet rather melancholy; there\r\nwere so many cripples, and it reminded me a little of the Christmas\r\nfeast described in Dostoievski’s “Letters from a Dead House.”\r\n\r\n                                                         _January 18th._\r\n\r\nTo-day I heard a characteristic story. A student told it to me. A\r\npeasant was looking at a rich man’s house in one of the streets of\r\nMoscow. An agitator went up to him and said: “Think of the rich man\r\nliving in that great house, and think of your miserable position.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the peasant cheerfully, “it’s a big house; he’s a proper\r\nBarine.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said the agitator, much irritated, “it’s most unjust that he\r\nshould live in such a big house and that you should live in a small\r\nhouse. You should turn him out of it.”\r\n\r\n“How could that be?” answered the peasant. “He is used to being rich.\r\nAll his life he has lived in plenty. What would he do in poverty? We are\r\nused to poverty, and we must have pity on those who are not used to it.”\r\n\r\nThe agitator then gave the peasant up and went away in disgust.\r\n\r\n                                                         _January 20th._\r\n\r\nI arrived in St. Petersburg this morning. Yesterday a Russian friend of\r\nmine discussed with me my ideas on the “Intelligenzia” and their\r\nrevolutionary sympathies which I had embodied in a letter to the\r\n_Morning Post_. My friend said that I had committed a gross injustice to\r\nthe Russian “Intelligenzia,” and that my letter, by reflecting the\r\nopinion of Englishmen who had spent but a short time in Russia, and\r\njudged everything from the point of view of a country where political\r\nliberty had long since been an established fact, gave a wrong\r\nimpression. There is some truth in this, no doubt. It is difficult here\r\nto keep a cool head and not to be swayed by circumambient influence. The\r\ndanger does not lie in being influenced by those who immediately\r\nsurround one, but rather in being influenced inversely by their\r\nopinions. I mean one has only to talk to a revolutionary or to a\r\nconservative long enough, at the present moment, to be convinced that\r\nhis adversary is right. I still hold, however, to what I wrote about the\r\nunfairness and exaggerations of the sympathisers with the revolution\r\namong the “Intelligenzia.” I think they are incapable of looking at the\r\nmatter impartially, and no wonder. Moreover, the Government past and\r\npresent is responsible for their frame of mind. Again, I still hold to\r\nwhat I said, that the “Intelligenzia” have not produced a great man; but\r\ninstead of retracting what I said, I will, as I said I would do, after\r\nthe oriental fashion, having stated all that there was to be said\r\nagainst them, try and set forth all that is to be said in favour of the\r\n“Intelligenzia.”\r\n\r\nIn the first place, what is the “Intelligenzia”? Properly speaking, it\r\nis composed of every one who can read or write. But the term is\r\ngenerally used to designate those members of the middle class who belong\r\nto the professional classes—doctors, professors, teachers, journalists,\r\nand literary men. In its largest sense it is the whole middle class,\r\nfrom which nine-tenths of the officials are drawn. But when Russians\r\nspeak of it they generally mean the middle class, excluding officials.\r\nSuch as it is, it contains, as well as the most hot-headed\r\nrevolutionaries and violent youths, all that is best and most\r\nintelligent and cultivated in Russia, all men of science who have done\r\nremarkable work in various branches, all doctors, whose life in the\r\ncountry is a life of difficulty and self-sacrifice which it would be\r\ndifficult to exaggerate, all the professors and the teachers, the\r\nactors, the singers, the musicians, the artists, the writers. These\r\npeople have for years been the absolute prey of the irresponsibility and\r\nblundering stupidity of the higher bureaucrats. They have with\r\ndifficulty been able to obtain foreign books (Matthew Arnold’s “Essays\r\non Criticism” was one of the books on the index two years ago); in\r\nteaching, half the facts of history have been forbidden them; and at the\r\nslightest suspicion of not being “well-intentioned” they have been\r\nplaced under police surveillance and often been subjected to gross\r\nindignities. Is it to be wondered at that they are bitter now? The\r\naverage man and woman of the Russian middle class is incomparably better\r\neducated than the average English man or woman of the same class. They\r\nare saturated with the foreign classics. They often speak two languages\r\nbesides Russian; and they are conversant with modern thought in the\r\nvarious European countries as far as it is allowed to reach them. When\r\none sees the average Englishman abroad one is aghast at his ignorance\r\nand his want of education in comparison with these people. I have\r\nconstantly, both here and in Manchuria, found to my shame that I knew\r\nnothing of English history in comparison with the Russians I met. The\r\nreason is very simple: they are taught at school things which will be\r\nuseful to them. Every one is given a general foundation of knowledge. I\r\ndo not believe the average Englishman to be more stupid than the average\r\nforeigner, but he is not educated. A man may go through a public school\r\nand even a university in England and come out at the end ludicrously\r\nignorant of everything except the classical books he was obliged to “get\r\nup,” and at our public schools, with a few brilliant exceptions, the\r\neducation of the average boy amounts to this: that he does not learn\r\nLatin and Greek, and he certainly learns nothing else. I never heard\r\nEnglish history mentioned at Eton, and all the English history I know I\r\nlearnt in the nursery. The average Russian boy knows far more about\r\nEnglish history than the average English boy, let alone European\r\nhistory; and a cultivated Russian of the middle class is saturated with\r\nJohn Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer, Ruskin, John Morley, Buckle, and\r\nCarlyle; whereas Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, and Shelley are treated as\r\nRussian classics. Only yesterday I travelled with a man who, although he\r\ncould not speak English, was intimately conversant with our whole\r\nliterature, and told me that the whole generation to which he belonged\r\nhad been taught to find their intellectual food in England and not in\r\nFrance and Germany. “How is it,” he asked me, “that we Russians who live\r\non English thought, and admire and respect you as a nation far more than\r\nother nations, have been so long at loggerheads with you politically?” I\r\nsaid that I thought the reason was that, although the cultivated and the\r\naverage educated Russian knows our literature well, the nation as a\r\nwhole does not know us, and we do not know Russia at all—for most\r\nintelligent Englishmen are ludicrously ignorant of Russia. Besides this,\r\nthe bureaucratic _régime_ has acted like a barrier between the two\r\ncountries and fostered and fed on the misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nAs far as politics are concerned things have moved on. Some weeks ago it\r\nwas possible to believe that the Government had been wantonly hampered\r\nin its well-intentioned efforts, now it is only too plain that by their\r\nacts they are doing their best to justify the violence of the\r\nrevolutionaries. The “Proisvol” (arbitrariness) continues on an\r\nextensive scale. People in Moscow are arrested every day and without\r\ndiscrimination. Influential people do not dare to inscribe their names\r\non the lists of the Constitutional Democratic Party for fear of being\r\narrested. The police have unlimited powers, and all the methods of the\r\nold _régime_ are flourishing once more. I do not believe, as is sure to\r\nbe objected, that the action of the revolutionaries has rendered this\r\nnecessary. I do not believe that the best way to fight revolution is by\r\nlawless and arbitrary repression. Lastly, and most important, it is not\r\nthe immorality or the illegality of the methods that I find\r\nreprehensible, but their stupidity and ineffectiveness. If all this\r\nrepression were the iron working of one great central mind, which\r\nruthlessly imposed its will on the nation, breaking down all obstacles\r\nand restoring order, it would be excusable. But it is not. I do not\r\nbelieve the Government is responsible for what happens in Moscow; and in\r\nMoscow itself the various authorities shift the responsibility on to\r\neach other. It is the old story of the bureaucratic system—no\r\nresponsibility and no individual efficiency, but a happy-go-lucky,\r\ndrifting, and blind incompetence, striking where it should not strike,\r\nbeing lenient too late, and never foreseeing what is under its very\r\nnose. When one comes to think, it is not surprising, considering that\r\nthe instruments with which Count Witte has to deal are of the old\r\nregulation bureaucratic pattern. How, for instance, can the Minister of\r\nthe Interior, M. Durnovo, be expected to adopt any other methods than\r\nthose which are ingrained in him? It is as if the Liberals persuaded Mr.\r\nChamberlain to speak at a public meeting and then expressed surprise at\r\nfinding that he was in favour of Tariff Reform. When some of the\r\nrevolutionaries were summarily executed after the recent troubles in\r\nMoscow, a sentence of Tacitus came back to me which is peculiarly\r\napplicable to the old Russian bureaucratic methods: “Interfectis Varrone\r\nconsule designate et Petronio Turpiliano consulari ... inauditi atque\r\nindefensi tamquam innocentes perierunt” (Varro and Turpilianus were\r\nexecuted without trial and defence, so that they might just as well have\r\nbeen innocent).\r\n\r\nThe whole system of arresting doctors and professors, prohibiting\r\nnewspapers and plays, censoring books and songs, is now, whatever may\r\nhave been its effect in the past, childishly futile. Moreover, even this\r\nis blunderingly done. The harmless newspapers are suppressed and more\r\nviolent ones appear. But the point is the futility of it all; as soon as\r\na serious newspaper is stopped it reappears on the next day under\r\nanother name. Each repressed satirical newspaper (and these journals are\r\noften exceedingly scurrilous) finds a successor. It is not as if the\r\nrevolutionaries were the result of the newspapers; it is the newspapers\r\nwhich are the reflection of the revolutionaries; and until you can\r\nrepress every revolutionary the spirit which finds its vent in these\r\norgans will exist. To repress the Liberal spirit altogether it will be\r\nnecessary to suppress nearly all the thinking population of Russia. The\r\nonly hope is that all this is, after all, only temporary, and that the\r\nmeeting of the Duma will put an end to this riot of lawlessness and\r\ninefficiency. One competent man like Count Witte is not enough to deal\r\nwith things which are happening all over the country in so large a place\r\nas Russia, and he is bound to trust himself to minor authorities—and\r\nthese in many cases prove themselves unfit for their task. “Why are they\r\nchosen?” it may be asked. The answer is: “Who else is there to choose\r\nuntil the whole pack of cards is thoroughly reshuffled or rather\r\ndestroyed, and a new pack, men chosen by the Duma, is adopted?”\r\n\r\n“But,” it is objected, “however much you reshuffle the cards, the pack\r\nwill be the same.” This is true; but one radical change would make all\r\nthe difference in the world, and that would be the introduction of the\r\nsystem of responsibility. Whenever there has been in a Russian town a\r\ngovernor who had declared his firm intention of holding his subordinates\r\nresponsible for their acts, and has put such a declaration into\r\npractice, things have always gone well. There was for years a chief of\r\nthe police at Moscow, who was just such a man. The trouble is now, that\r\nhowever good a subordinate official may be, there is no guarantee that\r\nhe may not be removed at any minute owing to the passing whim of those\r\nwho are above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n                    CURRENT IDEAS IN ST. PETERSBURG\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         ST. PETERSBURG, _January 27th_.\r\n\r\nPeople are now saying that the revolutionary movement in Russia has\r\nsuffered a complete defeat. I do not share this point of view; my reason\r\nis not based upon prophetic discernment into the future, but on what has\r\nhappened in the past.\r\n\r\nIf we are in the presence of a stream and note the beginnings of its\r\nturbulent course, and then observe that it has met with the obstacle of\r\na dam and burst through that obstacle, and that this occurrence has been\r\nrepeated six times, with the result that every time the dam has been\r\nburst the stream has gathered in strength, when this dam is made a\r\nseventh time we are justified in concluding that as the dam is the same\r\nin kind as it was before, and the stream also, the stream will break\r\nthrough it a seventh time, although every time the dam was made the\r\nonlookers made the observation that the progress of the stream was\r\ndefinitively impeded. Now this is precisely what has happened with\r\nregard to the Russian revolutionary movement up to the present time. And\r\nwe are now witnessing an act of a drama which began in 1895.\r\n\r\nThe course of events was like this: When the Emperor Nicholas II. came\r\nto the Throne a deputation of the Zemstva were told that their moderate\r\ndemands for the beginning of reform were senseless dreams. Upon these\r\nwords the first dam was built, and it took the form of universal\r\nrepression.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1904, the ukase, embodying the nullified projects of Prince\r\nMirsky, was immediately followed by a threatening Manifesto, and a\r\nsecond dam was made. This dam, however, was ineffectual, and it was\r\nfollowed by the rising of the workmen of the 9th of January, and when\r\nthis meeting was dispersed by the troops, and a third dam constructed,\r\npeople said—and among them people who lived here and ought to have known\r\nbetter—that the Russian revolution was over. February 18th saw the\r\npublication of the two contradictory Manifestoes and the Boulygin\r\nproject, and during this time the dam took the shape of the Trepoff\r\ndictatorship, which, as General Trepoff is a competent man, proved to be\r\nfor the time being more effectual than the obstacles which had hitherto\r\nbeen employed.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of this there came the incidents of the mutiny on\r\nboard the _Kniaz Potemkin_ and at Kronstadt and Libau. This was followed\r\nby the concession of the law giving the Duma on August 6th, which was\r\naccompanied by a law forbidding public meetings. A fourth dam had been\r\nmade. But the current only increased in strength. The Agrarian movement\r\nbegan. The Labour movement increased. Meetings took place everywhere\r\ntill the dam burst, owing to the fact that the whole of Russia went on\r\nstrike in October, 1905.\r\n\r\nThen the Manifesto of the 17th of October was given—a Manifesto granting\r\nfreedom of meeting and of speech, but no laws. It was followed by the\r\ndeclaration of martial law in Poland. This measure was in its turn\r\nsucceeded by the St. Petersburg strike, the Sevastopol mutiny, and a\r\nviolent agrarian agitation in the province of Saratov, which spread all\r\nover the “black soil” country in Russia. Repressive measures followed.\r\nThe Zemstvo leaders then addressed themselves to Count Witte, and asked\r\nfor a cessation of repressive measures, the control of irresponsible\r\nbureaucrats in the provinces, and the right of universal suffrage. This\r\nwas refused. The postal officials, who had formed a union, were\r\narrested; there ensued postal strikes in St. Petersburg and Moscow.\r\nThereupon a law was promulgated—this was the fifth dam—by which each\r\nprovincial governor could declare his government to be outside the law.\r\nThis was followed by the armed rising in Moscow, and after this a sixth\r\ndam was made by the adoption of repressive measures of arrest all over\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nNow, such questions as whether the revolutionary party was right or\r\nwrong; whether they were too much in a hurry, and too impulsive and\r\nviolent in their methods; whether postal officials and Government\r\nservants are justified in striking, &c., are altogether beside the mark.\r\nThe fact is that they have six times been successful in bursting the\r\nbarrier which has been placed to oppose them. And now once again people\r\nare saying that because the movement has been temporarily\r\nchecked—because a dam has been made—the movement is over; that the\r\nstream will not be able to continue its course. This is where I take\r\nleave to differ from those who have from the first predicted the\r\nultimate collapse of the revolutionary movement. I differed then—in\r\nJanuary, 1905—and I continue to differ now. I am aware that I am laying\r\nmyself open to the charge of prophesying. “When you keep a diary,” said\r\na shrewd observer of a past generation, “don’t write down public events\r\nwhich you can find in any record, but put down what you think will\r\nhappen, and then you will be astonished to see how wrong you have been.”\r\n\r\n                                         ST. PETERSBURG, _February 1st_.\r\n\r\nI have been amusing myself by putting down some current ideas—those of\r\nsome people I have met here and some of my own, in the form of a\r\ndialogue. The people represented are not real people. They are scarcely\r\neven types, but mere mouthpieces of current ideas. I have not tried to\r\ndescribe a conversation such as one now hears in Russia, but I have\r\nattempted to put in the form of dialogue certain ideas I have heard\r\nexpressed by my friends and certain opinions which have occurred to\r\nmyself during such intercourse.\r\n\r\n“There are three parties I could belong to,” said the small landlord;\r\n“the alliance of October 17th, the alliance of Right and Order, and the\r\nConstitutional Democratic Party. I would be willing to support any one\r\nof these three, in the hope that they would lead directly or indirectly\r\nto the disappearance of the present dynasty and to the establishment of\r\na real autocracy.”\r\n\r\nThe student laughed. “The Constitutional Democrats will not lead you to\r\nan autocracy of any kind,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I am not so sure,” said the landlord. “Napoleon was the child of the\r\nRevolution, and so was Cromwell. I support the Radicals in the same way\r\nin which I would have supported the Puritans to get rid of Charles I.,\r\nand make way for Cromwell.”\r\n\r\n“And Charles II.?” asked the professor, who had just returned from a\r\nprolonged stay in England.\r\n\r\n“Precisely, and Charles II.,” said the landlord. “The Charles the Firsts\r\nof history are invincibly ignorant, whereas the Charles the Seconds have\r\nlearned the lesson and make ideal monarchs. One cannot always be\r\ngoverned by men of genius, and in the intervening period, when the\r\ngenius is absent, I prefer to be governed by a man of the world, such as\r\nCharles II. or Louis XVIII., rather than by demagogues and idealists.”\r\n\r\n“It is better to be governed by honest demagogues and idealists than by\r\ndishonest Bureaucrats,” said the student. “The Bureaucrats made the\r\nwar.”\r\n\r\n“When the war was declared you students marched cheering into the\r\nstreets, and I myself happening to be in uniform that day—I am in the\r\nReserve—was carried in reluctant triumph on the shoulders of an\r\nenthusiastic crowd. The war can be blamed, not because it was immoral,\r\nfor it was not more immoral than any other war, but because it was made\r\ntoo late, and because it was unsuccessful.”\r\n\r\n“The war,” said the professor, “was a war made by irresponsible\r\ncapitalists, in the same way as the South African War was the work of a\r\ngang of financiers, and had a true Englishman of genius, such as\r\nGladstone or Bright, been alive, the war would not have been possible.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the student, “the feeling here was never so great against\r\nEngland during this war as during the war in South Africa.”\r\n\r\n“The English,” answered the landlord, “made the same mistake as we did;\r\nthey knew nothing about South Africa, and made the war later than they\r\nshould have done; had they waited longer the Afrikander element would\r\nhave probably turned them out of South Africa altogether, and they would\r\nhave lost their prestige and their Colonies. Bismarck foresaw this, and\r\nhoped that it might happen.”\r\n\r\n“The English have gained nothing by having betrayed their ancient\r\ntradition, and sacrificed to false gods,” said the professor, “but now\r\nthey are returning to the true path, and it is to Liberal England that\r\nwe must look for example and support.”\r\n\r\n“You mean,” said the landlord, “that one set of men, including some\r\nbright intellects and a number of average, that is to say, mediocre men,\r\nhave been replaced by another set of men containing exactly the same\r\nproportion of capacity, mediocrity, and incompetence. By what miracle\r\nare they to govern the country better or worse than their opponents?\r\nHave they shown that they could do so in the past? And I would apply\r\nthis argument to the situation here. Do you imagine that a Ministry\r\ncomposed of intellectuals would be radically different from a Ministry\r\ncomposed of Bureaucrats? The intellectuals will be merely Bureaucrats\r\nwho have not learnt their business, and when they have learnt their\r\nbusiness they will be Bureaucrats; that is, perhaps, why the Zemstvo\r\nleaders were reluctant to enter the Cabinet.”\r\n\r\n“The Zemstvo leaders were reluctant to join Count Witte because they\r\ndisapproved of his programme,” said the student, “and, whether they\r\nbecome Bureaucrats or no, they will be under the control of society.”\r\n\r\n“The Bureaucrats are blamed for lawlessness,” said the landlord, “but\r\nthe revolutionaries seem to me so entirely incapable of controlling\r\nthemselves that they do not lead one to believe in their capacity for\r\ncontrolling other people. The fact is that we Russians are all a mixture\r\nof lawlessness and apathy. We are blamed for our apathy, for our want of\r\nco-operation, but I thank Heaven for it, for did it not exist, the\r\nlawlessness would lead to excesses of a dangerous character; as it is,\r\nthere is no country where an individual can enjoy such a degree of\r\npersonal freedom as in Russia. Russia is the only country where the\r\nwords liberty, fraternity, and equality have any reality. These things\r\nare facts in Russia. But they are not facts in England. First, as\r\nregards liberty. There is no liberty either of thought or _mœurs_ in\r\nEngland. Liberty of thought flourishes under an autocracy; in the reign\r\nof Nero, Renan tells us, ‘la liberté de penser ne fit que gagner. Cette\r\nliberté-là se trouve toujours mieux d’avoir affaire à un roi ou à un\r\nprince qu’à des bourgeois jaloux et bornés.’ I do not consider my\r\nliberty of thought to be violated if I can only read an eclipsed version\r\nof the leading articles of the English and French halfpenny Press; but I\r\ndo consider it violated if I am forbidden to witness a masterpiece full\r\nof thought and moral import, such as Ibsen’s ‘Ghosts’ or a beautiful\r\nplay like Mæterlinck’s ‘Monna Vanna.’ This is the case in England. The\r\nEnglish fetter themselves with convention, and ostracise those who\r\nrevolt against the convention. You cannot smoke in a railway refreshment\r\nroom in England. You must dress for dinner. You cannot have supper after\r\n12.30 a.m. at a restaurant. You cannot go to a theatre on Sunday. You\r\ncannot admire anything unless it is the fashion, and once it is the\r\nfashion you must admire it. As to equality, the whole of English life is\r\na struggle to belong to the layer of society immediately above your own,\r\nand not to be suspected of belonging to that immediately beneath your\r\nown. Hence England is the paradise of snobbery, social and intellectual.\r\nThere is a mad race to be ‘in the swim’ socially and ‘in the know’\r\nintellectually, and to read the right books and admire the right\r\npictures. As to equality I will give you a concrete instance. Let two\r\nmen get drunk in London, one a rich man and the other a poor man. If\r\nthey make a disturbance and get taken up, the rich man, by taking a\r\nlittle trouble, will get the matter hushed up. The poor man will not get\r\noff. You will say that there is one law for the rich and one for the\r\npoor in every country. But I say that here in Russia nobody cares if you\r\ngo drunk in the street, and that, whether you are rich or poor, if you\r\ndo so the same thing will happen to you; you will be taken to the\r\n_uchastok_ and kept there till you get sober. Whereas in England they\r\ncare very much; you have to appear before a magistrate—but the rich man\r\nwill get out of this. As to fraternity, the English hedge themselves\r\nround with every kind of social prejudice and barrier they can devise.\r\nTheir clubs are like their prisons, places where it is forbidden to\r\nspeak to your neighbour, except under special circumstances, and where\r\nyou have to wear a special costume. A Russian convict enjoys a greater\r\nfreedom of social intercourse than an English shopman. I judge from\r\ntheir books. Read ‘Kipps,’ by H. G. Wells. It is a record of leaden\r\nsocial tyranny.”\r\n\r\n“What you call convention,” said the professor, “is merely the\r\nmaintenance of order. It may be exaggerated, but an exaggeration in this\r\nsense is preferable to one in the other. You can sup here at a\r\nrestaurant all night, but a man may shoot you for not being brisk enough\r\nin your manifestation of loyalty.”\r\n\r\n“Many Englishmen would gladly shoot Mr. Bernard Shaw for the same\r\noffence,” said the landlord, “but they have not the courage of their\r\nconvictions.”\r\n\r\n“What you call freedom,” said the professor, “is precisely the opposite\r\nof freedom. It is lawlessness. Your neighbour can kill you with\r\nimpunity. Where does your freedom come in the matter? What freedom is\r\nthere in not being allowed to read a foreign newspaper unless it is\r\nexpurgated, or in being sent to Siberia for disapproving of the methods\r\nof Government officials?”\r\n\r\n“The people who were sent to Siberia,” said the landlord, “were those\r\nwho wished to overturn the existing form of government, under which the\r\nordinary individual enjoyed peculiar liberty. And even here how mildly\r\nthe Government acted! Really remarkable agitators like Tolstoi were left\r\nalone. The English acted more drastically, and hounded Byron and Shelley\r\nfrom the country. But when it is a question of expressing their\r\nconvictions they would never throw a bomb; they cannot go further than\r\nthrowing a herring at Mr. Balfour. The fact is that the English are a\r\nnation of shopkeepers, and they have the shopkeeper’s aversion from a\r\nmess in the shop.”\r\n\r\n“If that means having shopmen,” said the professor, “such as Chatham,\r\nFox, Burke, Gladstone, Bright, and Morley, I wish we were also a nation\r\nof shopkeepers. If a nation’s destinies are controlled by men like\r\nAlexeiev and Bezobrassov it does not seem to me to make it less like a\r\nshop, only the shop is managed on dishonest principles.”\r\n\r\n“The greatest of all English thinkers,” answered the landlord, “was a\r\ndishonest official, Lord Bacon; her greatest soldier a general who\r\npeculated, the Duke of Marlborough. The man who made England’s prestige\r\ndwindle to its lowest depth was Gladstone.”\r\n\r\n“We cannot reach a lower depth than that to which the Bureaucracy has\r\nbrought us,” said the student.\r\n\r\n“As a remedy you want liberal demagogues,” said the landlord. “What we\r\nwant is not a change of kind, but of quality; not a Liberal Cabinet and\r\na Liberal autocrat, but a capable Cabinet and a capable autocrat; and,\r\ntherefore, I support the revolutionaries, in the hope that out of the\r\nruins and ashes of what they will destroy the phœnix may arise.”\r\n\r\n“And we,” said the student, “can do without phœnixes, which we regard as\r\na doubtful blessing; on the other hand, what we want, and what we are\r\ndetermined to get, are laws, not manifestoes—laws guaranteeing the\r\nelementary rights of liberty and equality; and these we are determined\r\nto attain, even at the sacrifice of the peculiar liberty, equality, and\r\nfraternity which you say we enjoy; even if the ultimate result be that\r\nthe Emperor ceases to call us _Bratzi_ (little brothers) and the\r\ntheatres are closed on Sunday.”\r\n\r\n                                         ST. PETERSBURG, _February 4th_.\r\n\r\nTo-day I had a long conversation with X, one of the most enlightened\r\nLiberals in the service of the Russian Government. He said that the\r\naction of the Government in proclaiming the Manifesto of October 17th\r\ncould only be compared to the Declaration of the Rights of Man by the\r\nFrench Revolution before any constitution was defined. The Manifesto had\r\nproclaimed in Russia principles unknown in that country, and the fact\r\nremained, although it was sometimes overlooked, that it was the\r\nGovernment and not a National Assembly which had taken the momentous\r\nstep. Whatever circumstances may have provoked this step, it is none the\r\nless true that Count Witte by taking it retained the control over the\r\ngeneral situation, and still retains it in spite of all appearances to\r\nthe contrary. This was a merit not recognised by his detractors, who are\r\nnow universal. Then he went on to say that the source of the trouble and\r\nconfusion now was that the Manifesto formed the programme and the basis\r\nof a Constitution; it was not a Constitution in itself (since it had\r\nbeen conferred by an Autocrat and could be taken back again); this fact\r\nhad been slow in dawning on the people, unused to abstract political\r\ndiscussion, and most people, probably the majority, considered the\r\nManifesto to be equivalent to an established Constitution. The trouble\r\nis, he added, that some of the most intelligent of the moderate Liberals\r\nof the upper classes do not know what a Constitution is. If the\r\nManifesto had been immediately followed by a Constitution, the questions\r\nwhich at the present time were giving rise to heated debate would never\r\nhave been raised. They would have been settled before they were\r\ndiscussed by the public. As it was the Manifesto contained a collection\r\nof principles which all parties sought to interpret and to exploit to\r\ntheir own advantage. The reactionary party sees in the preservation of\r\nthe word “Autocrat” the key of the situation. He added that though his\r\nparty was not large, and had lost a great deal of its influence, none\r\nthe less it possessed a deep root in the Conservative element in Russia.\r\nCount Witte, he said, is supposed, and rightly, to interpret the word\r\n“Autocrat” historically, and to substitute for the word “Limited” that\r\nof “Independent” (International). He then spoke of the Octobrists, the\r\nparty of the 17th of October. He said that they showed conciliatory\r\ntendencies, which although obviously well meaning in times of\r\nRevolution, made for weakness. They avoid the question of title and that\r\nof the oath of the sovereign, and declare themselves satisfied with the\r\nclear and precise act guaranteeing the oath on the part of the successor\r\nto the throne; and they remain content with the Manifesto as far as the\r\nactual sovereign is concerned. The Radical parties take no interest in\r\nthis question, the Social Democrats take even less, since they look to\r\nRevolution and to Revolution only for the ultimate decision of the\r\ndestiny of their country. There are two other questions, he continued,\r\nwhich up to the present have been scarcely mentioned, nor is there much\r\nhope that the Government will have the courage to face them unaided. One\r\nis that of the relations among the different nations of which the\r\nRussian Empire is composed, the other is the Agrarian question. This\r\nlast question is not a constitutional or a legislative question. The\r\npower of the autocrat, while it existed, could alone have solved it. The\r\nautocratic power exists no longer now in fact, although its place has\r\nnot yet been taken by a definite new _régime_. He said that among the\r\nmass of conflicting conjectures and rumours with regard to the future,\r\ntwo important things were clear: (1) that the Government was determined\r\nto retain in its hands the power to give a Constitution; (2) that it was\r\ndetermined to grant a Constitution and to proceed to the elections. He\r\nsaid it was impossible to say more at the present; everything depended\r\non the nature of the future Assembly, and whether it would be possible\r\nfor the Moderate elements to exercise any preponderating influence. Up\r\nto now they had been widely divergent and discordant among themselves.\r\nIf their efforts to gain a solid majority were successful, the greatest\r\ndanger would be over; if not, the Revolution was in its infancy, for if\r\nthe Moderates were to fail, the two extreme parties would be left face\r\nto face, as different from one another as possible, yet both at one for\r\ndifferent reasons in their uncompromising opposition to all temperate\r\nand constitutional reform. He said he made no allusion to the various\r\nrisings and repressions, because these events exercised, in reality,\r\nonly an indirect influence on the progress of the ideas he had\r\nmentioned, sometimes by facilitating their spread, and sometimes by\r\nimpeding it. It had neither produced nor stopped them. There were two\r\nparallel and different currents of events now in progress in Russia. One\r\nforced itself on the attention, the other was exceedingly difficult to\r\ntrace. For that reason it was futile to discuss exclusively the progress\r\nof revolutionary feeling and the ultimate success of repressive\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to look back on this conversation now in December,\r\n1906, since it shows the illusions which Russian Liberals cherished a\r\nyear ago.\r\n\r\n                                        ST. PETERSBURG, _February 11th_.\r\n\r\nI have put into the form of a dialogue some of the many conflicting\r\nviews I have lately heard expressed with regard to Count Witte.\r\n\r\n“We have no right,” said the Moderate Liberal, “to doubt the good faith\r\nof the Government at the present moment as regards the promise of the\r\nConstitution and the elections for the Duma. Until the Government proves\r\nto us that it does not intend to keep its word we are bound to believe\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“It has never kept its word in the past,” said the student, “and\r\neverything which it is doing at present tends to show that it has no\r\nintention of doing so now.”\r\n\r\n“Count Witte knows what he is doing,” said the man of business. “When\r\nour grandchildren read of this in books they will wonder why we were so\r\nblind and so obstinate, just as we now wonder at the blindness which\r\nprevailed when the opposition to Bismarck was absolutely universal.”\r\n\r\n“I share the scepticism of our young friend,” said the Zemstvo\r\nrepresentative, “but for different reasons. I do not share your\r\nconfidence in Count Witte. The basis of that confidence is in your case\r\nthe fact that Count Witte is a man of business. I maintain that a man of\r\nbusiness can only exert a real and lasting influence in the affairs of a\r\nnation in times of revolution, convulsion, and evolution, or what you\r\nplease to call it, on one condition, namely, that of recognising and\r\ntaking into account the force of ideas and of moral laws. You smile, and\r\nsay that this is nonsense. But I say this, not because I am an idealist,\r\nfor I am not one, but because I have got an open mind, which seeks the\r\ncauses of certain phenomena and finds them in the existence of certain\r\nfacts. One of these facts is this: that you cannot set at naught certain\r\nmoral laws; you cannot trample on certain ideas without their rebounding\r\non to you with invincible force. You men of business deny the existence\r\nof these moral laws, and scoff at the force of ideas; but it is on\r\npractice and facts that I base my argument, and not on theory. That is\r\nwhy men like Cromwell succeed, and why men like Metternich fail.”\r\n\r\n“And Napoleon?” asked the man of business.\r\n\r\n“Napoleon slighted one of these laws by invading Spain, and this was the\r\ncause of his overthrow, although Napoleon was a soldier, which is an\r\nincalculable advantage.”\r\n\r\n“And Bismarck?” asked the man of business.\r\n\r\n“Bismarck,” said the Zemstvo representative, “is a case in point. He\r\nfollowed and used ideas. He worked for the great national ideal, the\r\nideal of united Germany. He incarnated the national idea. What is Count\r\nWitte’s ideal? A national loan or the expansion of the Russo-Chinese\r\nBank? It is not enough to say that the revolution is merely the work of\r\nenemies financed by foreigners, and then _Schwamm darüber_, as the\r\nGermans say. Whoever supports it, it is there; and if it were merely an\r\nartificial forced product, surely you, as a man of business, must admit\r\nthat it would have died a natural death by this time. You say that the\r\npeople can only be actuated by their own interests. I say that the\r\npeople are often actuated by something which has nothing to do with\r\ntheir interests. History affords me countless examples which prove I am\r\nright. When people have been killed, tortured, and burnt for an idea, it\r\nis absurd to say they were interested. Interested in what? In the\r\npossible rewards of a future life? But people have been tortured and\r\nburnt not only for their faith but for their opinions: Giordano Bruno,\r\nDe Witt, and many others. There are some, too, whose outward enthusiasm\r\nhas been lined with scepticism, and who have died for a cause in which\r\nthey did not even believe. And when a person now throws a bomb at a\r\ngovernor it may explain the fact to say he is mad, but it does not\r\nexplain the fact to say that he is bought, because he knows quite well\r\nhe is going to certain death. To deny this is a sign, in my opinion, of\r\na limited intelligence. ‘Il n’a pas l’intelligence assez large,’ a\r\nFrench writer once said, ‘pour concevoir que l’intérêt n’est pas seul à\r\nmener le monde, qu’il se mêle souvent et qu’il cède parfois à des\r\npassions plus fortes, voire à des passions nobles.’ This is why I\r\ndisbelieve in Count Witte. I believe he suffers from this limitation,\r\nthe limitation from which Bismarck did not suffer. In times of peace it\r\nwould not signify; in times such as these it makes all the difference.\r\nHave you read a book by H. G. Wells called the ‘Food of the Gods’? I do\r\nnot know what the English think of Wells; but we, some of us at least,\r\nand the French, take him seriously as a thinker. Well, in this book\r\nthere is an argument between a Prime Minister and the representative of\r\nthe giant race. All the Prime Minister’s arguments are excellent, but\r\nthey are fundamentally wrong, because his action is morally wrong. This\r\nstory applies to the situation here. A race of giants has grown up.\r\nCount Witte, with conviction and eloquence, repeats again and again that\r\ntheir action is impossible, that he must be helped, that the existence\r\nof mankind is at stake. But all the time he is denying to this race the\r\nright of existence. And they know they have the right to live. He is\r\ndenying the moral law and saying that his opponents are only hirelings,\r\nor madmen. His arguments are specious, but the giants are there, and\r\nthey will not listen; he sends troops and police against them; they\r\nanswer by bombarding the country with their giant food, which causes\r\ngigantic growth to spring up wherever it falls. In our case this food\r\ntakes the shape of ideas and the rights of man.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but since he has promised a Constitution,” said the Moderate\r\nLiberal, “you cannot prove that he does not mean to keep his promise.”\r\n\r\n“I feel certain he will give some kind of a Constitution,” answered the\r\nZemstvo representative. “I feel equally certain that it will mean\r\nnothing at all. I am not convinced for a moment that he believes in\r\nConstitutional Government for Russia. And if he disbelieves in it, why\r\nshould he give it?”\r\n\r\n“But what makes you think he disbelieves in it?” asked the Liberal.\r\n\r\n“His present action,” remarked the student.\r\n\r\n“His past actions,” said the Zemstvo representative. “Why did he not\r\nsupport Prince Mirsky’s reforms? And apart from this, has he not said in\r\nthe past, again and again, that a strong autocracy is the only\r\nGovernment suitable for Russia?”\r\n\r\n“He is quite right there,” said the man of business.\r\n\r\n“Then you agree with me,” said the Zemstvo representative, “in thinking\r\nthat he does not believe in a Constitution. I think myself that a\r\ncapable and wise autocracy may very well be the ideal Government. But\r\nthe position now is that the autocracy has for a long time past shown\r\nitself to be neither capable nor wise, and therefore the enormous\r\nmajority of thinking Russians are quite determined to do away with it.\r\n‘Absolute Princes,’ Dr. Johnson said, ‘seldom do any harm, but those who\r\nare governed by them are governed by chance.’ We are tired of being\r\ngoverned by chance. We may be unreasonable, but we are determined to try\r\nsomething else.”\r\n\r\n“We will see,” said the man of business, “assuming what you say to be\r\ntrue, who is the stronger, you and your giant food of ideas and moral\r\nlaws, or Count Witte and his practical sense. We have the bayonets on\r\nour side.”\r\n\r\n“The bayonets of a defeated army,” said the Zemstvo representative. “We\r\nwill see how long you will be able to sit upon them.”\r\n\r\n“I do not pretend to be a prophet or a philosopher,” answered the man of\r\nbusiness, “but I note certain facts; one of these is this, that ever\r\nsince October I have been told by your friends that Count Witte’s\r\nposition is untenable, and his resignation a question of hours. It has\r\nnot come about yet. He still retains the direction of affairs. Should we\r\nmeet in five years’ time I will discuss Count Witte’s policy with you.\r\nAt present we are too near to it.”\r\n\r\n“And it too far from us,” said the student.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of this conversation, a man who belonged to no party\r\ncame into the room and overheard the talk. When they had finished\r\ntalking he said: “As to Witte, the question seems to me to lie in this:\r\nis he acting consciously and with foresight or is he merely making the\r\nbest of chance? We are all praying for a genius to appear in Russia.\r\nBut, when geniuses do come, nobody ever recognises the fact until it is\r\ntoo late and they are dead. If Witte is acting consciously then he is a\r\ngenius indeed. If he has foreseen all along what would happen, and, in a\r\nfew years’ time, is President of the Federation of Russian United\r\nStates, having decentralised what he has so capably centralised, then I\r\nthink he will be one of the greatest men who have ever lived; but, if he\r\nis merely acting as the occasion presents itself, I do not rate him\r\nhigher than a Boulanger with a head for figures.”\r\n\r\n“In any case,” said the Zemstvo representative, “he will provide\r\nglorious food for discussion for the future historian, and even at\r\npresent the world would be a duller and greyer place without this\r\nenigmatical chameleon.”\r\n\r\n                                        ST. PETERSBURG, _February 17th_.\r\n\r\nI have frequently heard the opinion expressed that the Russian\r\nRevolution can inspire nothing but disgust owing to the fact that it has\r\nproduced no great men, and to its lack of big, stirring epic events, in\r\ncontradistinction to the French Revolution, which was so rich in all\r\nthese things. It is, therefore, interesting to note what impression the\r\nevents of the French Revolution produced on impartial foreign\r\ncontemporary opinion.\r\n\r\nWe derive one definite impression of the French Revolution by reading\r\nCarlyle, or Mignet, or Taine; but the foreign contemporaries who were\r\nnot themselves mingled in the tragic events received a very different\r\nand far more fragmentary series of impressions. Horace Walpole, in his\r\nletters, gives us interesting glimpses into the contemporary opinion of\r\nthe period. At the time of the storming of the Bastille he wrote as\r\nfollows: “If the Bastille conquers, still is it impossible, considering\r\nthe general spirit in the country, and the numerous fortified places in\r\nFrance, but some may be seized by the _dissidents_, and whole provinces\r\nbe torn from the Crown? On the other hand, if the King prevails, what\r\nheavy despotism will the _États_, by their want of temper and\r\nmoderation, have drawn on their country! They might have obtained many\r\ncapital points, and removed great oppression. No French monarch will\r\never summon _États_ again if this moment has been thrown away.” It is\r\ninteresting to note how doubtful he considers the success of the\r\nrevolutionaries to be. Again, he adds in the same letter: “One hears of\r\nno genius on either side, nor do symptoms of any appear. There will,\r\nperhaps; such times and tempests bring forth, at least bring out, great\r\nmen. I do not take the Duke of Orleans or Mirabeau to be built “du bois\r\ndont on les fait”; no, nor M. Necker. He may be a great traitor if he\r\nmade the confusion designedly; but it is a woful evasion if the promised\r\nfinancier slips into a black politician.” A criticism similar to that\r\npassed on Necker I have myself heard applied to Count Witte on several\r\noccasions in St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1790, he again returns to the charge: “Franklin and Washington\r\nwere great men. None have appeared yet in France, and Necker has only\r\nreturned to make a wretched figure.... Why, then, does he stay?” This is\r\nthe question which the _Russ_, the anti-Governmental newspaper, is\r\nasking every day in like terms about Count Witte. In August, 1790, he\r\nsays about the French: “They have settled nothing like a Constitution;\r\non the contrary, they seem to protract everything but violence as much\r\nas they can in order to keep their louis a day.” This might be applied\r\nnot without appositeness to certain of the Bureaucrats here. In\r\nSeptember, 1791, Horace Walpole is even more pessimistic. He thinks that\r\ntwenty thousand men could march from one end of France to the other. But\r\nhe apprehends the possibility of enthusiasm turning to courage against a\r\nforeign enemy. What he disbelieves in is a set of “military noble lads,\r\npedantic academicians, curates of villages, and country advocates amidst\r\nthe utmost confusion and altercation amongst themselves” composing a\r\nsystem of government that would set four and twenty millions of people\r\nfree. “This, too,” he adds, “without one great man amongst them. If they\r\nhad had, as Mirabeau seemed to promise to be—but as we know that he was,\r\ntoo, a consummate villain, there would soon have been an end of their\r\nvision of liberty. And so there will be still, unless, after a civil\r\nwar, they split into small kingdoms or commonwealths. A little nation\r\nmay be free.... Millions cannot be so; because, the greater the number\r\nof men that are one people, the more vices, the more abuses there are,\r\nthat will either require or furnish pretexts for restraints.” It is\r\nplain from the above quotations that whatever contemporary foreign\r\nwriters thought of the French Revolution there was one thing which they\r\ndid not think, and that was that the prominent actors in it were big\r\nmen; or that the whole movement was anything but disgusting and futile.\r\n\r\nLater, in 1793, Horace Walpole’s horror and disgust, as was natural,\r\nknew no bounds. He thinks, moreover, that the proceedings of the French\r\nRepublicans had wounded the cause of liberty and shaken it for\r\ncenturies. Now the popular atmosphere of legend that has grown up round\r\nthe Revolution takes as its keynote a phrase of Victor Hugo’s: “Les\r\nhommes de 1793 étaient des géants.” In Russia we have not got so far as\r\n1793. We are still at the beginning of 1789, and it is quite possible\r\nthat the future Carlyle who writes the history of this period will say\r\nthe men of 1905 were giants. The Duma will give opportunities for\r\npopular tribunes, and apart from and in contradistinction to great\r\norators or tribunes, it may be doubted whether revolutions, while they\r\nare going on, ever produce great men. The great men come afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut when people point to the seemingly effectual repression that is now\r\ntaking place here, and ask how it is possible for the Revolution to\r\ncontinue, they forget that there is a difference—a small but vastly\r\nimportant difference—between the present state of affairs and the period\r\nof the late M. Plehve’s _régime_. The difference consists in the fact\r\nthat before the general strike and the October Manifesto, before even\r\nthe taking of Port Arthur, Prince Mirsky opened a little window in the\r\ntight-closed room of Russian politics by relaxing the stringent Press\r\nregulations and letting loose public opinion. The light came in like a\r\nflood, and nothing can now drive it out. Repression when public opinion\r\nwas crushed was a very different thing from repression when every case\r\nof it is reported in detail in the newspapers, as now happens. For\r\npeople can say what they like about the unreality or the non-existence\r\nof the liberty of the Press; one has only to buy the Radical newspapers\r\nto be convinced that if the Press is not free it is certainly more\r\nexplicit and more unrestrained in its violence than the Press of any\r\nother European country, and some of the comic satirical newspapers might\r\nhave Marat for editor.\r\n\r\nSomebody once said that he would have given anything in the world to\r\nhave half an hour’s private interview with the late Lord Beaconsfield\r\nwith a pistol, and to obtain from him under the threat of death an exact\r\nand complete account of his views and convictions. It would be\r\ninteresting to perform a similar experiment on Count Witte; whatever the\r\nresult of it might be, I doubt if there would be found a trace of the\r\nplacid optimism which is sometimes attributed to him. Count Witte may be\r\nattacked for many things; he cannot be accused of a lack of\r\nclear-sightedness: not, that is, if he be judged by the utterances which\r\nhe is known to have made before the outbreak of the war, or by those\r\nwhich he made publicly before entering office, and while the war was\r\nstill going on. Mirabeau was, in the opinion of Horace Walpole, a\r\nruffian; he was certainly distrusted by both parties, but we know now,\r\nthough the fact escaped the notice of his contemporaries, that he gauged\r\nthe forces at work and the probable trend of events with surprising\r\naccuracy. We now consider Mirabeau to have been something like a great\r\nman. Count Witte has perhaps inspired among all parties a greater\r\ndistrust than that which was the lot of Mirabeau; but in times such as\r\nthese clear-sightedness, self-confidence, and capacity for hard work are\r\nprecious qualities indeed. Nobody denies the possession of these\r\nqualities to Count Witte. It is not, therefore, impossible that the\r\nfuture historian may place him in the same niche as Mirabeau in the\r\nPantheon of the world. This, as Horace Walpole says, is speculation, not\r\nprophecy. And I revert, or rather arrive, at these conclusions, that a\r\nlull in events does not necessarily imply their final cessation; that so\r\nfar in Russia revolutionary matters have succeeded one another, if\r\nanything, with greater rapidity than they did in France, and that what\r\nseems to be the unmistakable dawn of revolution to the historian may\r\nvery well appear to be a false dawn to the contemporary observer; and\r\nthat, whatever happens, nothing can ever shut the little window which\r\nPrince Mirsky opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n                       DOSTOIEVSKY’S ANNIVERSARY\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        ST. PETERSBURG, _February 24th_.\r\n\r\nThey are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the death of Dostoievski,\r\nand this fact has brought back to my mind, with great vividness, a\r\nconversation I had with the officers of the battery at Jen-tzen-tung\r\nlast September, and which I have already noted in my diary.\r\n\r\nWe were sitting in the ante-room of the small Chinese house which formed\r\nour quarters. This ante-room, which had paper windows and no doors, a\r\nfloor of mud, and a table composed of boards laid upon two small\r\ntressels, formed our dining-room. We had just finished dinner, and were\r\ndrinking tea out of pewter cups. Across the courtyard from the part of\r\nthe dwelling where the Chinese herded together, we could hear the\r\nmonotonous song of a Chinaman or a Mongol singing over and over to\r\nhimself the same strophe, which rose by the intervals of a scale more\r\nsubtle than ours and sank again to die away in the vibrations of one\r\nprolonged note, to the accompaniment of a single-stringed instrument.\r\n\r\nThe conversation had languished. Somebody was absorbed in a patience, we\r\nwere talking of books and novels in a vague, desultory fashion, when\r\nsuddenly Hliebnikov, a young Cossack officer, said: “Who is the greatest\r\nwriter in the world?” Vague answers were made as to the comparative\r\nmerits of Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, and Molière, but Hliebnikov\r\nimpatiently waived all this talk aside. Then turning to me he said: “He\r\nknows; there is one writer greater than all of them, and that is\r\nDostoievski.”\r\n\r\n“Dostoievski!” said the doctor. “Dostoievski’s work is like a clinical\r\nlaboratory or a dissecting-room. There is no sore spot in the human soul\r\ninto which he does not poke his dirty finger. His characters are either\r\nmad or abnormal. His books are those of a madman, and can only be\r\nappreciated by people who are half mad themselves.”\r\n\r\nThe young Cossack officer did not bother to discuss the question. He\r\nwent out into the night in disgust. We continued the argument for a\r\nshort time. “There is not a single character,” said the doctor, “in all\r\nDostoievski’s books who is normal.” The doctor was a cultivated man, and\r\nseeing that we differed we agreed to differ, and we talked of other\r\nthings, but I was left wondering why Hliebnikov was so convinced that\r\nDostoievski was the greatest of all writers, and why he knew I should\r\nagree with him. I have been thinking this over ever since, and in a\r\nsense I do agree with Hliebnikov. I think that Dostoievski is the\r\ngreatest writer that has ever lived, if by a great writer is meant a man\r\nwhose work, message, or whatever you like to call it, can do the\r\ngreatest good, can afford the greatest consolation to poor humanity. If\r\nwe mean by the greatest writer the greatest artist, the most powerful\r\nmagician, who can bid us soar like Shelley or Schubert into the seventh\r\nheaven of melody, or submerge us like Wagner beneath heavy seas until we\r\ndrown with pleasure, or touch and set all the fibres of our associations\r\nand our æsthetic appreciation vibrating with incommunicable rapture by\r\nthe magic of wonderful phrases like Virgil or Keats, or strike into our\r\nvery heart with a divine sword like Sappho, Catullus, Heine, or Burns,\r\nor ravish us by the blend of pathos and nobility of purpose with\r\nfaultless diction like Leopardi, Gray, and Racine, or bid us understand\r\nand feel the whole burden of mankind in a thin thread of notes like\r\nBeethoven or in a few simple words like Goethe, or evoke for us the\r\nwhole pageant of life like Shakespeare to the sound of Renaissance\r\nflutes, or all Heaven and Hell like Dante, by “thoughts that breathe and\r\nwords that burn”?\r\n\r\nIf we are thinking of all these miraculous achievements when we say a\r\ngreat writer or the greatest writer, then we must not name Dostoievski.\r\nDostoievski is not of these; in his own province, that of the novelist,\r\nhe is as a mere workman, a mere craftsman, one of the worst, inferior to\r\nany French or English ephemeral writer of the day you like to mention;\r\nbut, on the other hand, if we mean by a great writer a man who has given\r\nto mankind an inestimable boon, a priceless gift, a consolation, a help\r\nto life, which nothing can equal or replace, then Dostoievski is a great\r\nwriter, and perhaps the greatest writer that has ever lived. I mean that\r\nif the Holy Scriptures were destroyed and no trace were left of them in\r\nthe world, the books where mankind, bereft of its Divine and inestimable\r\ntreasure, would find the nearest approach to the supreme message of\r\ncomfort would be the books of Dostoievski.\r\n\r\nDostoievski is not an artist; his stories and his books are put together\r\nand shaped anyhow. The surroundings and the circumstances in which he\r\nplaces his characters are fantastic and impossible to the verge of\r\nabsurdity. The characters themselves are also often impossible and\r\nfantastic to the verge of absurdity; yet they are vivid in a way no\r\nother characters are vivid, and alive, not only so that we perceive and\r\nrecognise their outward appearance, but so that we know the innermost\r\ncorners of their souls. His characters, it is said, are abnormal. One of\r\nhis principal figures is a murderer who kills an old woman from ambition\r\nto be like Napoleon, and put himself above the law; another is a victim\r\nto epileptic fits. But the fact should be borne in mind that absolutely\r\nnormal people, like absolutely happy nations, have no history; that\r\nsince the whole of humanity is suffering and groaning beneath the same\r\nburden of life, the people who in literature are the most important to\r\nmankind are not the most normal, but those who are made of the most\r\ncomplex machinery and of the most receptive wax, and who are thus able\r\nto receive and to record the deepest and most varied impressions. And in\r\nthe same way as Job and David are more important to humanity than George\r\nI. or Louis-Philippe, so are Hamlet and Falstaff more important than Tom\r\nJones and Mr. Bultitude. And the reason of this is not because Hamlet\r\nand Falstaff are abnormal—although compared with Tom Jones they are\r\nabnormal—but because they are human: more profoundly human, and more\r\nwidely human. Hamlet has been read, played, and understood by succeeding\r\ngenerations in various countries and tongues, in innumerable different\r\nand contradictory fashions; but in each country, at each period, and in\r\neach tongue, he has been understood by his readers or his audience,\r\naccording to their lights, because in him they have seen a reflection of\r\nthemselves, because in themselves they have found an echo of Hamlet. The\r\nfact that audiences, actors, readers, and commentators have all\r\ninterpreted Hamlet in utterly contradictory ways testifies not merely to\r\nthe profound humanity of the character but to its multiplicity and\r\nmanysidedness. Every human being recognises in himself something of\r\nHamlet and something of Falstaff; but every human being does not\r\nnecessarily recognise in himself something of Tom Jones or Mr.\r\nBultitude. At least what in these characters resembles him is so like\r\nhimself that he cannot notice the likeness; it consists in the broad\r\nelementary facts of being a human being; but when he hears Hamlet or\r\nFalstaff philosophising or making jokes on the riddle of life he is\r\nsuddenly made conscious that he has gone through the same process\r\nhimself in the same way.\r\n\r\nSo it is with Dostoievski. Dostoievski’s characters are mostly abnormal,\r\nbut it is in their very abnormality that we recognise their profound and\r\npoignant humanity and a thousand human traits that we ourselves share.\r\nAnd in showing us humanity at its acutest, at its intensest pitch of\r\nsuffering, at the soul’s lowest depth of degradation, or highest summit\r\nof aspiration, he makes us feel his comprehension, pity, and love for\r\neverything that is in us, so that we feel that there is nothing which we\r\ncould think or experience; no sensation, no hope, no ambition, no\r\ndespair, no disappointment, no regret, no greatness, no meanness that he\r\nwould not understand; no wound, no sore for which he would not have just\r\nthe very balm and medicine which we need. Pity and love are the chief\r\nelements of the work of Dostoievski—pity such as King Lear felt on the\r\nheath; and just as the terrible circumstances in which King Lear raves\r\nand wanders make his pity all the greater and the more poignant in its\r\npathos, so do the fantastic, nightmarish circumstances in which\r\nDostoievski’s characters live make their humanness more poignant, their\r\nlove more lovable, their pity more piteous.\r\n\r\nA great writer should see “life steadily and see life whole.”\r\nDostoievski does not see the whole of life steadily, like Tolstoi, for\r\ninstance, but he sees the soul of man whole, and perhaps he sees more\r\ndeeply into it than any other writer has done. He shrinks from nothing.\r\nHe sees the “soul of goodness in things evil”: not exclusively the evil,\r\nlike Zola; nor does he evade the evil like many of our writers. He sees\r\nand pities it. And this is why his work is great. He writes about the\r\nsaddest things that can happen; the most melancholy, the most hopeless,\r\nthe most terrible things in the world; but his books do not leave us\r\nwith a feeling of despair; on the contrary, his own “sweet\r\nreasonableness,” the pity and love with which they are filled are like\r\nbalm. We are left with a belief in some great inscrutable goodness, and\r\nhis books act upon us as once his conversation did on a fellow prisoner\r\nwhom he met on the way to Siberia. The man was on the verge of suicide;\r\nbut after Dostoievski had talked to him for an hour—we may be sure there\r\nwas no sermonising in that talk—he felt able to go on, to live even with\r\nperpetual penal servitude before him. To some people, Dostoievski’s\r\nbooks act in just this way, and it is, therefore, not odd that they\r\nthink him the greatest of all writers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n                         THE POLITICAL PARTIES\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   MOSCOW, _March 11th_.\r\n\r\nThe political parties which are now crystallising themselves are the\r\nresult of the Liberal movement which began in the twenties, and\r\nproceeded steadily until the beginning of the war in 1904, when the\r\nLiberal leaders resolved, for patriotic reasons, to mark time and wait.\r\nThis cessation of hostilities did not last long, and the disasters\r\ncaused by the war produced so universal a feeling of discontent that the\r\nliberation movement was automatically set in motion once more.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of June, 1905, a deputation of the United Zemstva, at the\r\nhead of which was Prince S. N. Troubetzkoi, was received by the Emperor.\r\nPrince Troubetzkoi, in a historic speech, expressed with the utmost\r\nfrankness and directness the imperative need of sweeping reform and of\r\nthe introduction of national representation. The coalition of the\r\nZemstva formed the first political Russian party, but it was not until\r\nafter the great strike, and the granting of the Manifesto in October,\r\nthat parties of different shades came into existence and took definite\r\nshape. During the month which followed the Manifesto the process of\r\ncrystallisation of parties began, and is still continuing, and they can\r\nnow roughly be divided into three categories—Right, Centre, and Left,\r\nthe Right being the extreme Conservatives, the Centre the Constitutional\r\nMonarchists, and the Left consisting of two wings, the Constitutional\r\nDemocrats on the right and the Social Democrats and Social\r\nRevolutionaries on the left. Of these the most important is the party of\r\nthe Constitutional Democrats, nicknamed the “Cadets.” “Cadets” means\r\n“K.D.,” the word “Constitutional” being spelt with a “K” in Russian, and\r\nas the letter “K” in the Russian alphabet has the same sound as it has\r\nin French, the result is a word which sounds exactly like the French\r\nword “Cadet.” Similarly, Social Revolutionaries are nicknamed “S.R.’s”\r\nand the Social Democrats “S.D.’s.”\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the origin of the Constitutional Democrats one\r\nmust understand the part played by the Zemstva. In 1876 a group of\r\nCounty Councillors, or Zemstvoists, under the leadership of M.\r\nPetrunkevitch devoted themselves to the task of introducing reforms in\r\nthe economical condition of Russia. In 1894 their representatives,\r\nheaded by M. Rodichev, were summarily sent about their business, after\r\nputting forward a few moderate demands. In 1902 these men formed with\r\nothers a “League of Liberation.” M. Schipov tried to unite these various\r\n“Zemstva” in a common organisation, and some of the members of the\r\nLiberation League, while co-operating with them, started a separate\r\norganisation called the Zemstvo Constitutionalists. Among the members of\r\nthis group were names which are well known in Russia, such as Prince\r\nDolgoroukov, MM. Stachovitch, Kokoshkin, and Lvov. But these\r\n“Zemstvoists” formed only a small group; what they needed, in order to\r\nrepresent thinking Russia, was to be united with the professional\r\nclasses. In November, 1904, the various professions began to group\r\nthemselves together in political bodies. Various political unions were\r\nformed, such as those of the engineers, doctors, lawyers, and\r\nschoolmasters. Then Professor Milioukov, one of the leading pioneers of\r\nthe Liberal movement, whose name is well known in Europe and America,\r\nunited all professional unions into a great “Union of Unions,” which\r\nrepresented the great mass of educated Russia. Before the great strike\r\nin October, 1905, he created, together with the best of his colleagues,\r\na new political party, which united the mass of professional opinion\r\nwith the small group of Zemstvo leaders. He had recognised the fact that\r\nthe Zemstvoists were the only men who had any political experience, and\r\nthat they could do nothing without enrolling the professional class.\r\nTherefore it is owing to Professor Milioukov that the experienced\r\nZemstvo leaders in October had the whole rank and file of the middle\r\nclass behind them, and the Constitutional Democrats, as they are at\r\npresent, represent practically the whole “Intelligenzia,” or\r\nprofessional class, of Russia. This party is the only one which is\r\nseriously and practically organised. This being so, it is the most\r\nimportant of the political parties.\r\n\r\nThose of the Right have not enough followers to give them importance,\r\nand those of the Left have announced their intention of boycotting the\r\nelections. These various parties are now preparing for the elections.\r\n\r\nWe are experiencing now the suspense of an _entr’acte_ before the\r\ncurtain rises once more on the next act of the revolutionary drama. This\r\nwill probably occur when the Duma meets in April. People of all parties\r\nseem to be agreed as to one thing, that the present state of things\r\ncannot last. There is at present a reaction against reaction. After the\r\ndisorders here in December many people were driven to the Right; now the\r\nreactionary conduct of the Government has driven them back to the Left.\r\n\r\nSo many people have been arrested lately that there is no longer room\r\nfor them in prison. An influential political leader said to me yesterday\r\nthat a proof of the incompetence of the police was that they had not\r\nforeseen the armed rising in December, whereas every one else had\r\nforeseen it. “And now,” he said, “they have been, so to speak, let loose\r\non the paths of repression; old papers and old cases, sometimes of forty\r\nyears ago, are raked up, and people are arrested for no reason except\r\nthat the old machine, which is broken and thoroughly out of order, has\r\nbeen set working with renewed energy.” The following conversation is\r\nrelated to me—if it is not true (and I am convinced that it is not true)\r\nit is typical—as having taken place between a Minister and his\r\nsubordinate:—\r\n\r\nThe Subordinate: There are so many people in prison that there is no\r\npossibility of getting in another man. The prisons are packed, yet\r\narrests are still being made. What are we to do? Where are these people\r\nto be put?\r\n\r\nThe Minister: We must let some of the prisoners out.\r\n\r\nThe Subordinate: How many?\r\n\r\nThe Minister: Say five thousand.\r\n\r\nThe Subordinate: Why five thousand?\r\n\r\nThe Minister: A nice even number.\r\n\r\nThe Subordinate: But how? Which? How shall we choose them?\r\n\r\nThe Minister: Let out any five thousand. What does it matter to them?\r\nAny five thousand will be as pleased as any other to be let out.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that last November the Minister of the\r\nInterior was reported to have said that if he could be given a free hand\r\nto arrest twenty thousand “intellectuals,” he would stop the revolution.\r\nThe twenty thousand have been arrested, but the revolution has not been\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nSo far, in spite of the many manifestoes, no guarantee of a Constitution\r\nhas been granted. The Emperor has, it is true, declared that he will\r\nfulfil the promises made in his declaration of the 17th of October, and\r\nit is true that if these promises were fulfilled, the result would be\r\nConstitutional Government. But at the same time he declared that his\r\nabsolute power remained intact. At first sight this appears to be a\r\ncontradiction in terms; but, as the Power which granted the Manifesto of\r\nOctober 17th was autocratic and unlimited, and as it made no mention of\r\nthe future limiting of itself, it is now, as a matter of fact, not\r\nproceeding contrarily to any of its promises. The liberties which were\r\npromised may only have been meant to be temporary. They could be\r\nwithdrawn at any moment, since the Emperor’s autocratic power remained.\r\nThe Manifesto might only have been a sign of goodwill of the Emperor\r\ntowards his people. It promised certain things, but gave no guarantee as\r\nto the fulfilment of these promises. The whole of Russia, it is true,\r\nunderstood it otherwise. The whole of Russia understood when this\r\nManifesto was published that a Constitution had been promised, and that\r\nautocracy was in future to be limited. What Count Witte understood by\r\nit, it is difficult to say. Whether he foresaw or not that this\r\nManifesto by its vagueness would one day mean much less than it did\r\nthen, or whether he only realised this at the same time that he realised\r\nthat the Conservative element was much stronger than it was thought to\r\nbe, it is impossible to determine. The fact remains that the Emperor has\r\nnot withdrawn anything; he has merely not done what he never said he\r\nwould do, namely, voluntarily abdicate his autocratic power.\r\n\r\nThe Conservatives are opposed to any such proceeding; not in the same\r\nway as the extreme reactionaries, some of whom relegated the portrait of\r\nthe Emperor to the scullery on the day of the Manifesto from sheer\r\nConservative principle, but because they say that if the autocratic\r\npower is destroyed the peasant population will be convulsed, and the\r\ndanger will be immense. To this Liberals—all liberal-minded men, not\r\nrevolutionaries—reply that this supposed danger is a delusion of the\r\nConservatives, who have unconsciously invented the fact to support their\r\ntheory and have not based their theory on the fact; that many peasants\r\nclearly understand and recognise that there is to be a constitutional\r\n_régime_ in Russia; that if this danger does exist, the risk incurred by\r\nit must be taken; that in any case it is the lesser of two evils, less\r\ndangerous than the maintenance of the autocracy.\r\n\r\nCount Witte’s opponents on the Liberal side say that the course of\r\nevents up to this moment has been deliberately brought about by Count\r\nWitte; that he disbelieved and disbelieves in Constitutional Government\r\nfor Russia; that he provoked disorder in order to crush the\r\nrevolutionary element; that the Moderate parties played into his hands\r\nby not meeting him with a united front; that, Duma or no Duma, he\r\nintends everything to remain as before and the power to be in his hands.\r\nWhat his supporters say I do not know, because I have never seen one in\r\nthe flesh, but I have seen many people who say that what has happened so\r\nfar has been brought about with infinite skill and knowledge of the\r\nelements with which he had to deal. Further, they add that Count Witte\r\nhas no principles and no convictions; that he has always accommodated\r\nhimself to the situation of the moment, and worked in harmony with the\r\nmen of the moment, whatever they were; that he has no belief in the\r\nforce or the stability of any movement in Russia; that he trusts the\r\nRussian character to simmer down after it has violently fizzed; that he\r\nintends to outstay the fizzing period; that he has a great advantage in\r\nthe attitude of the Moderate parties, who, although they do not trust\r\nhim, play into his hands by disagreeing on small points and not meeting\r\nhim with clear and definite opposition. They add, however, that he has\r\nmiscalculated and wrongly gauged the situation this time, because the\r\nsimmering down period will only be temporary and the fizzing will be\r\nrenewed again with increasing violence, until either the cork flies into\r\nspace or the bottle is burst. The cork is autocracy, the bottle Russia,\r\nand the mineral water the revolution. The corkscrew was the promise of a\r\nConstitution with which the cork was partially loosened, only to be\r\nscrewed down again by Count Witte’s powerful hand.\r\n\r\nAmong all the parties the most logical seem to be the Extreme\r\nConservatives and the Extreme Radicals. The Extreme Conservatives have\r\nsaid all along that the talk of a Constitution was nonsensical, and the\r\nManifesto of October 17th a great betrayal; that the only result of it\r\nhas been disorder, riot, and bloodshed. They are firmly based on a\r\nprinciple. The Extreme Radicals are equally firmly based on a principle,\r\nnamely, that the autocratic _régime_ must be done away with at all\r\ncosts, and that until it is swept away and a Constitution based on\r\nuniversal suffrage takes its place there is no hope for Russia.\r\nTherefore the danger that the Moderate parties may eventually be\r\nsubmerged and the two extremes be left face to face, still exists. As a\r\ngreat quantity of the Radicals are in prison they are for the time being\r\nless perceptible; but this era of repression cannot last, and it has\r\nalready created a reaction against itself. But then the question arises,\r\nwhat will happen when it stops? What will happen when the valve on which\r\nthe police have been sitting is released?\r\n\r\nThe influential political leader with whom I dined last night, and who\r\nis one of the leading members of the party of October 17th, said that\r\nthere was not a man in Russia who believed in Witte, that Witte was a\r\nman who had no convictions. I asked why he himself and other Zemstvo\r\nleaders had refused to take part in the administration directly after\r\nthe Manifesto had been issued, when posts in the Cabinet were offered to\r\nthem. He said their terms had been that the Cabinet should be\r\nexclusively formed of Liberal leaders; but they did not choose to serve\r\nin company with a man like Durnovo, with whom he would refuse to shake\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nHe added that it would not have bettered their position in the country\r\nwith regard to the coming Duma, which he was convinced would be Liberal.\r\nTalking of the Constitutional Democrats he said they were really\r\nrepublicans but did not dare own it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n                             IN THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   SOSNOFKA, GOVERNMENT OF TAMBOV,\r\n                                                           _March 25th_.\r\n\r\nWhen one has seen a thing which had hitherto been vaguely familiar\r\nsuddenly illuminated by a flood of light, making it real, living, and\r\nvivid, it is difficult to recall one’s old state of mind before the\r\ninrush of the illuminating flood; and still more difficult to discuss\r\nthat thing with people who have not had the opportunity of illumination.\r\nThe experience is similar to that which a child feels when, after having\r\nworshipped a certain writer of novels or tales, and wondered why he was\r\nnot acknowledged by the whole world to be the greatest author that has\r\never been, he grows up, and by reading other books, sees the old\r\nfavourite in a new light, the light of fresh horizons opened by great\r\nmasterpieces; in this new light the old favourite seems to be a sorry\r\nenough impostor, his golden glamour has faded to tinsel. The grown-up\r\nchild will now with difficulty try to discover what was the cause and\r\nsecret of his old infatuation, and every now and then he will receive a\r\nshock on hearing some fellow grown-up person talk of the former idol in\r\nthe same terms as he would have talked of him when a child, the reason\r\nbeing that this second person has never got farther; has never reached\r\nthe illuminating light of new horizons. So it is with many things; and\r\nso it is in my case with Russia. I find it extremely difficult to recall\r\nexactly what I thought Russia was before I had been there; and I find\r\nRussia difficult to describe to those who have never been there. There\r\nis so much when one has been there that becomes so soon a matter of\r\ncourse that it no longer strikes one, but which to the newcomer is\r\nprobably striking.\r\n\r\nThe first time I came to Russia I travelled straight to the small\r\nvillage where I am now staying. What did I imagine Russia to be like?\r\nAll I can think of now is that there was a big blank in my mind. I had\r\nread translations of Russian books, but they had left no definite\r\npicture or landscape in my mind; I had read some books about Russia and\r\ngot from them very definite pictures of a fantastic country, which\r\nproved to be curiously unlike Russia in every respect. A country where\r\nfeudal castles, Pevenseys and Hurstmonceuxs, loomed in a kind of\r\nRhine-land covered with snow, inhabited by mute, inglorious Bismarcks,\r\nand Princesses who carried about dynamite in their cigarette-cases and\r\nwore bombs in their tiaras; Princesses who owed much of their being to\r\nOuida, and some of it to Sardou.\r\n\r\nThen everything in these books was so gloriously managed; everybody was\r\nso efficient, so powerful; the Bismarcks so Machiavellian and so mighty;\r\nthe Princesses so _splendide mendaces_. The background was also\r\ngorgeous, barbaric, crowded with Tartars and Circassians, blazing with\r\nscimitars, pennons, armour, and sequins, like a scene in a Drury Lane\r\npantomime; and every now and then a fugitive household would gallop in\r\nthe snow through a primæval forest, throwing their children to the\r\nwolves, so as to escape being devoured themselves. This, I think, was\r\nthe impression of Russia which I derived before I went there from\r\nreading French and English fiction about Russia, from Jules Verne’s\r\n“Michel Strogoff,” and from memories of many melodramas. Then came the\r\nimpressions received from reading Russian books, which were again\r\ntotally different from this melodramatic atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFrom Russian novels I derived a clear idea of certain types of men who\r\ndrank tea out of a samovar and drove forty versts in a vehicle called a\r\n_Tarantass_. I made the acquaintance of all kinds of people, who were as\r\nreal to me as living acquaintances; of Natascha and Levine, and Pierre\r\nand Anna Karenine, and Basaroff, and Dolly, and many others. But I never\r\nsaw their setting clearly, I never realised their background, and I used\r\nto see them move before a French or German background. Then I saw the\r\nreal thing, and it was utterly and totally different from my\r\nimaginations and my expectations. But now when I try to give the\r\nslightest sketch of what the country is really like the old difficulty\r\npresents itself; the difficulty which arises from talking of a thing of\r\nwhich one has a clear idea to people who have a vague and probably false\r\nidea of the reality. The first thing one can safely say is this:\r\neliminate all notions of castles, Rhine country, feudal keeps, and stone\r\nhouses in general. Think of an endless plain, a sheet of dazzling snow\r\nin winter, an ocean of golden corn in summer, a tract of brown earth in\r\nautumn, and now in the earliest days of spring an expanse of white\r\nmelting snow, with great patches of brown earth and sometimes green\r\ngrass appearing at intervals, and further patches of half-melted snow of\r\na steely-grey colour, sometimes blue as they catch the reflection of the\r\ndazzling sky in the sunlight. In the distance on one side the plain\r\nstretches to infinity, on the other you may see the delicate shapes of a\r\nbrown, leafless wood, the outlines soft in the haze. If I had to\r\ndescribe Russia in three words I should say a plain, a windmill, and a\r\nchurch. The church is made of wood, and is built in Byzantine style,\r\nwith a small cupola and a minaret. It is painted red and white, or white\r\nand pale-green. Sometimes the cupola is gilt.\r\n\r\nThe plain is dotted with villages, and one village is very like another.\r\nThey consist generally of two rows of houses, forming what does duty for\r\na street, but the word street would be as misleading as possible in this\r\ncase. It would be more exact to say an exceedingly broad expanse of\r\nearth: dusty in summer, and in spring and autumn a swamp of deep soaking\r\nblack mud. The houses, at irregular intervals, sometimes huddled close\r\ntogether, sometimes with wide gaps between them, succeed each other (the\r\ngaps probably caused by the fact that the houses which were there have\r\nbeen burnt). They are made of logs, thatched with straw; sometimes (but\r\nrarely) they are made of bricks and roofed with iron. As a rule they\r\nlook as if they had been built by Robinson Crusoe. The road is strewn\r\nwith straw and rich in abundance of every kind of mess. Every now and\r\nthen there is a well of the primitive kind which we see on the banks of\r\nthe Nile, and which one imagines to be of the same pattern as those from\r\nwhich the people in the Old Testament drew their water. The roads are\r\ngenerally peopled with peasants driving at a leisurely walk in winter in\r\nbig wooden sledges and in summer in big wooden carts. Often the cart is\r\ngoing on by itself with somebody in the extreme distance every now and\r\nthen grunting at the horse. A plain, a village, a church, every now and\r\nthen a wood of birch-trees, every now and then a stream, a weir, and a\r\nbroken-down lock. A great deal of dirt, a great deal of moisture. An\r\noverwhelming feeling of space and leisureliness, a sense that nothing\r\nyou could say or do could possibly hurry anybody or anything, or make\r\nthe lazy, creaking wheels of life go faster—that is, I think, the\r\npicture which arises first in my mind when I think of the Russian\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThen as to the people. With regard to these, there is one fact of\r\ncapital importance which must be borne in mind. The people if you know\r\nthe language and if you don’t are two separate things. The first time I\r\nwent to Russia I did not know a word of the language, and, though\r\ncertain facts were obvious with regard to the people, I found it a\r\nvastly different thing when I could talk to them myself. So different\r\nthat I am persuaded that those who wish to study this country and do not\r\nknow the language are wasting their time, and might with greater profit\r\nstudy the suburbs of London or the Isle of Man. And here again a fresh\r\ndifficulty arises. All the amusing things one hears said in this\r\ncountry, all that is characteristic and smells of the Russian land, all\r\nthat is peculiarly Russian, is like everything which is peculiarly\r\nanything, peculiarly English, Irish, Italian, or Turkish,\r\nuntranslatable, and loses all its savour and point in translation. This\r\nis especially true with regard to the Russian language, which is rich in\r\npeculiar phrases and locutions, diminutives, and terms which range over\r\na whole scale of delicate shades of endearment and familiarity, such as\r\n“little pigeon,” “little father,” &c., and these phrases translated into\r\nany other language lose all their meaning. However, the main impression\r\nI received when I first came to Russia, and the impression which I\r\nreceived from the Russian soldiers with whom I mingled in Manchuria in\r\nthe war, the impression which is now the strongest with regard to them\r\nis that of _humaneness_. Those who read in the newspapers of acts of\r\nbrutality and ferocity, of houses set on fire and pillaged, of huge\r\nmassacres of Jews, of ruthless executions and arbitrary imprisonments,\r\nwill rub their eyes perhaps and think that I must be insane. It is true,\r\nnevertheless. A country which is in a state of revolution is no more in\r\nits normal condition than a man when he is intoxicated. If a man is\r\nsoaked in alcohol and then murders his wife and children and sets his\r\nhouse on fire, it does not necessarily prove that he is not a humane\r\nmember of society. He may be as gentle as a dormouse and as timid as a\r\nhare by nature. His excitement and demented behaviour are merely\r\nartificial. It seems to me now that the whole of Russia at this moment\r\nis like an intoxicated man; a man inebriated after starvation, and\r\npassing from fits of frenzy to sullen stupor. The truth of this has been\r\nillustrated by things which have lately occurred in the country.\r\nPeasants who have looted the spirit stores and destroyed every house\r\nwithin reach have repented with tears on the next day.\r\n\r\nThe peasants have an infinite capacity for pity and remorse, and\r\ntherefore the more violent their outbreaks of fury the more bitter is\r\ntheir remorse. A peasant has been known to worry himself almost to\r\ndeath, as if he had committed a terrible crime, because he had smoked a\r\ncigarette before receiving the Blessed Sacrament. If they can feel acute\r\nremorse for such things, much more acute will it be if they set houses\r\non fire or commit similar outrages. If you talk to a peasant for two\r\nminutes you will notice that he has a fervent belief in a great, good,\r\nand inscrutable Providence. He never accuses man of the calamities to\r\nwhich flesh is heir. When the railway strike was at its height, and we\r\nwere held up at a small side station, the train attendant repeated all\r\nday long that God had sent us a severe trial, which He had. Yesterday I\r\nhad a talk with a man who had returned from the war; he had been a\r\nsoldier and a surgeon’s assistant, and had received the Cross of St.\r\nGeorge for rescuing a wounded officer under fire. I asked him if he had\r\nbeen wounded. He said, “No, my clothes were not even touched; men all\r\naround me were wounded. This was the ordinance of God. God had pity on\r\nthe orphan’s tears. It was all prearranged thus that I was to come home.\r\nSo it was to be.” I also had tea with a stonemason yesterday who said to\r\nme, “I and my whole family have prayed for you in your absence because\r\nthese are times of trouble, and we did not know what bitter cup you\r\nmight not have to drink.” Then he gave me three new-laid eggs with which\r\nto eat his very good health.\r\n\r\n                                                           _March 29th._\r\n\r\nTo-day I went out riding through the leafless woods and I saw one of the\r\nmost beautiful sights I have ever seen, a sight peculiarly\r\ncharacteristic of Russian landscape. We passed a small river that up to\r\nnow has been frozen, but the thaw has come and with it the floods of\r\nspring. The whole valley as seen from the higher slopes of the woods was\r\na sheet of shining water. Beyond it in the distance was a line of\r\ndark-brown woods. The water was grey, with gleaming layers in it\r\nreflecting the white clouds and the blue sky; and on it the bare trees\r\nseemed to float and rise like delicate ghosts, casting clearly defined\r\nbrown reflections. The whole place had a look of magic and enchantment\r\nabout it, as if out of the elements of the winter, out of the snow and\r\nthe ice and the leafless boughs, the spring had devised and evoked a\r\nsilvery pageant to celebrate its resurrection.\r\n\r\n                                                    MOSCOW, _April 6th_.\r\n\r\nI have spent twelve instructive days in the country; instructive,\r\nbecause I was able to obtain some first-hand glimpses into the state of\r\nthe country, into the actual frame of mind of the peasants; and the\r\npeasants are the obscure and hidden factor which will ultimately decide\r\nthe fate of Russian political life. It is difficult to get at the\r\npeasants; it is exceedingly difficult to get them to speak their mind.\r\nYou can do so by travelling with them in a third-class carriage, because\r\nthen they seem to regard one as a fleeting shadow of no significance\r\nwhich will soon vanish into space. However, I saw peasants; I heard them\r\ndiscuss the land question and the manner in which they proposed to buy\r\ntheir landlords’ property. I also had some interesting talks with a man\r\nwho had lived among the peasants for years. From him and from others I\r\ngathered that their attitude at present was chiefly one of expectation.\r\nThey are waiting to see how things turn out. They were continually\r\nasking my chief informant whether anything would come of the “levelling”\r\n(_Ravnienie_); this is, it appears, what they call the revolutionary\r\nmovement. It is extremely significant that they look upon this as a\r\nprocess of equalisation. The land question in Russia is hopelessly\r\ncomplicated; it is about ten times as complicated as the land question\r\nin Ireland, and of the same nature. I had glimpses of this complexity.\r\nThe village where I was staying was divided into four “societies”; each\r\nof these societies was willing to purchase so much land, but when the\r\nmatter was definitely settled with regard to one society two\r\nrepresentatives of two-thirds of that society appeared and stated that\r\nthey were “Old Souls” (_i.e._, they had since the abolition of serfage a\r\nseparate arrangement), and wished to purchase the lands separately in\r\norder to avoid its partition; upon which the representatives of the\r\nwhole society said that this was impossible, and that they were the\r\nmajority. The “Old Souls” retorted finally that a general meeting should\r\nbe held, and then it would be seen that the majority was in favour of\r\nthem. They were in a minority; and in spite of the speciousness of their\r\narguments it was difficult to see how the majority, whose interests were\r\ncontrary to those of the “Old Souls,” could be persuaded to support\r\nthem. This is only one instance out of many.\r\n\r\nAnother element of complication is that the peasants who can earn their\r\nliving by working on the landlords’ land are naturally greatly averse\r\nfrom anything like a complete sale of it, and are alarmed by the\r\npossibility of such an idea. Also there is a class of peasants who work\r\nin factories, and therefore are only interested in the land inasmuch as\r\nprofit can be derived from it while it belongs to the landlord. Again,\r\nthere are others who are without land, who need land, and who are too\r\npoor to buy it. If all the land were given to them as a present\r\nto-morrow the result in the long run would be deplorable, because the\r\nquality of the land—once you eliminate the landlord and his more\r\nadvanced methods—would gradually deteriorate and poverty would merely be\r\nspread over a larger area. One fact is obvious: that many of the\r\npeasants have not got enough land, and to them land is now being sold by\r\na great number of landlords. To settle the matter further, a radical\r\nscheme of agrarian reform is necessary; many such schemes are being\r\nelaborated at this moment, but those which have seen the light up to the\r\npresent have so far proved a source of universal disagreement. The fact\r\nwhich lies at the root of the matter is of course that if the land\r\nquestion is to be solved the peasant must be educated to adopt fresher\r\nmethods of agriculture than those which were employed in the Garden of\r\nEden; methods which were doubtless excellent until the fall of man\r\nrendered the cultivation of the soil a matter of painful duty, instead\r\nof pleasant recreation.\r\n\r\nI asked my friend who had lived among the peasants and studied them for\r\nyears what they thought of things in general. He said that in this\r\nvillage they had never been inclined to loot (looting can always arise\r\nfrom the gathering together of six drunken men), that they are perfectly\r\nconscious of what is happening (my friend is one of the most impartial\r\nand fair-minded men alive); they are distrustful and they say little;\r\nbut they _know_. As we were talking of these things I mentioned the fact\r\nthat a statement I had made in print about the peasants in this village\r\nand in Russia generally reading Milton’s “Paradise Lost” had been\r\nreceived with interest in England and in some quarters with incredulity.\r\nIt was in this very village and from the same friend, who had been a\r\nteacher there for more than twenty years, that I first heard of this. It\r\nwas afterwards confirmed by my own experience.\r\n\r\n“Who denies it?” he asked. “Russians or Englishmen?” “Englishmen,” I\r\nanswered. “But why?” he said. “I have only read it myself once long ago,\r\nbut I should have thought that it was obvious that such a work would be\r\nlikely to make a strong impression.”\r\n\r\nI explained that at first sight it appeared to Englishmen incredible\r\nthat Russian peasants, who were known to be so backward in many things,\r\nshould have taken a fancy to a work which was considered as a touchstone\r\nof rare literary taste in England. I alluded to the difficulties of the\r\nclassicism of the style—the scholarly quality of the verse.\r\n\r\n“But is it written in verse?” he asked. And when I explained to him that\r\n“Paradise Lost” was as literary a work as the Æneid he perfectly\r\nunderstood the incredulity of the English public. As a matter of fact,\r\nit is not at all difficult to understand and even to explain why the\r\nRussian peasant likes “Paradise Lost.” It is popular in exactly the same\r\nway as Bunyan’s “Pilgrim’s Progress” has always been popular in England.\r\nWas it not Dr. Johnson who said that Bunyan’s work was great because,\r\nwhile it appealed to the most refined critical palate, it was understood\r\nand enjoyed by the simplest of men, by babes and sucklings? This remark\r\napplies to the case of “Paradise Lost” and the Russian peasant. The fact\r\ntherefore is not surprising, as would be, for instance, the admiration\r\nof Tommy Atkins for a translation of Lucretius. It is no more and no\r\nless surprising than the popularity of Bunyan or of any epic story or\r\nfairy tale. When people laugh and say that these tastes are the\r\ninventions of essayists they forget that the epics of the world were the\r\nsupply resulting from the demand caused by the deeply-rooted desire of\r\nhuman nature for stories—long stories of heroic deeds in verse; the\r\nfurther you go back the more plainly this demand and supply is manifest.\r\nTherefore in Russia among the peasants, a great many of whom cannot\r\nread, the desire for epics is strong at this moment. And those who can\r\nread prefer an epic tale to a modern novel.\r\n\r\nBesides this, “Paradise Lost” appeals to the peasants because it is not\r\nonly epic, full of fantasy and episode, but also because it is\r\nreligious, and, like children, they prefer a story to be true. In\r\ncountries where few people read or write, memory flourishes, and in\r\nRussian villages there are regular tellers of fairy tales (_skashi_) who\r\nhand down from generation to generation fairy tales of incredible length\r\nin prose and in verse.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my friend the schoolmaster. I asked him if “Paradise\r\nLost” was still popular in the village. “Yes,” he answered, “they come\r\nand ask me for it every year. Unfortunately,” he added, “I may not have\r\nit in the school library as it is not on the list of books which are\r\nallowed by the censor. It is not forbidden; but it is not on the\r\nofficial list of books for school use.” Then he said that after all his\r\nexperience the taste of the peasants in literature baffled him. “They\r\nwill not read modern stories,” he said. “When I ask them why they like\r\n‘Paradise Lost’ they point to their heart and say, ‘It is near to the\r\nheart; it speaks; you read and a sweetness comes to you.’ Gogol they do\r\nnot like. On the other hand they ask for a strange book of adventures,\r\nabout a Count or a Baron.” “Baron Munchausen?” I suggested. “No,” he\r\nsaid, “a Count.” “Not Monte Cristo?” I asked. “Yes,” he said, “that is\r\nit. And what baffles me more than all is that they like Dostoievski’s\r\n‘Letters from a Dead House.’” (Dostoievski’s record of his life in\r\nprison in Siberia.) Their taste does not to me personally seem to be so\r\nbaffling. As for Dostoievski’s book, I am certain they recognise its\r\ngreat truth, and they feel the sweetness and simplicity of the writer’s\r\ncharacter, and this “speaks” to them also. As for “Monte Cristo,” is not\r\nthe beginning of it epical? It was a mistake, he said, to suppose the\r\npeasants were unimaginative. Sometimes this was manifested in a curious\r\nmanner. There was a peasant who was well known as a great drunkard. In\r\none of his fits of drink he imagined that he had sold his wife to the\r\n“Tzar of Turkey,” and that at midnight her head must be cut off. As the\r\nhour drew near he wept bitterly, said goodbye to his wife, and fetching\r\nan axe said with much lamentation that this terrible deed had to be done\r\nbecause he had promised her life to the “Tzar of Turkey.” The neighbours\r\neventually interfered and stopped the execution.\r\n\r\nWhen one is searching for curious types it generally happens that you\r\nfind one under your very nose. This was my case the other day. There is\r\nin the village another school which has lately been built for the\r\nfactory children by the Government. I strolled into it and was received\r\nby a young schoolmaster with long black hair who was conducting, in the\r\nsame room, three separate classes of children of different ages, to\r\nwhich he was respectively and simultaneously teaching reading, writing,\r\nand arithmetic (_i.e._, reading to one class, writing to the second, and\r\narithmetic to the third). In the interval between two lessons he took me\r\ninto his room and talked. His room was next to the schoolroom. It was\r\nlike the school, made of oak boards, neither papered nor carpeted. There\r\nwas no furniture in his sitting-room, except a tiny table and a stool,\r\nand in a further room no furniture at all except a violin on the floor.\r\nThe Government had given the wood with which to build the school, he\r\nsaid; and when it arrived the peasants whose children were to go to the\r\nschool had begun to saw and build, and then had refused to go on with\r\nthe work. However, it was eventually built. “Who supports it?” I asked.\r\n“Well,” he answered, “at present the Government have no funds for\r\nschools, and the peasants refuse to pay for it, so I have to support it\r\nmyself. The expenses are not great.” His salary consists of £36 a year,\r\nout of which he supplies the school-books and paper, pens, &c. He seemed\r\nto like his work and to take a great interest in the peasants. “The\r\nfactory peasants are far more developed than the ordinary peasants,” he\r\nsaid. “Some of them take an interest in astronomy. But the peasants are\r\ndark people, difficult to get to know, and infinitely cunning.” “Do you\r\nplay the violin?” I asked, pointing to the violin case. “Yes,” he\r\nanswered, “but I don’t know how I play.” I have never seen so poignant a\r\nsymbol of loneliness and the absence of the comforts of life as this\r\nyoung schoolmaster in his bare wooden room. He seemed, however,\r\nperfectly cheerful, and said that his present situation was a great\r\nimprovement on the last one, which had been a mastership in a school\r\nnear Morshansk, where he slept in the same room as forty other people,\r\nand where in winter the atmosphere was so thick at night that they had\r\nto open the door. To this the bare room with the violin on the floor\r\nseemed indeed preferable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n                             THE ELECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   MOSCOW, _March 19th_.\r\n\r\n“Public affairs,” Dr. Johnson once said, “vex no man.” And when Boswell\r\nobjected that he had seen Dr. Johnson vexed on this account the sage\r\nreplied thus: “Sir, I have never slept an hour less, nor ate an ounce\r\nless meat. I would have knocked the factious dogs on the head, to be\r\nsure; but I was not vexed.” This seems to me to be an exact definition\r\nof the attitude of the Russian public towards politics at this moment.\r\nThey are not vexed, but they are anxious to knock the factious dogs on\r\nthe head. The trouble is that each party considers the other parties to\r\nbe the factious dogs, and the Government considers nearly all the\r\nparties to be factious dogs; and all parties without exception (Radical,\r\nExtreme, and Conservative) consider the Government to be a factious dog.\r\nI will describe briefly the present position of principal parties and\r\ntheir more important subdivisions.\r\n\r\nThe Right (the monarchical party and the Alliance of Russian People) is\r\nfor the Throne and the Altar and against all compromise. They consider\r\nconstitutional promises to have been exacted by the terrorism of\r\nfactious dogs.\r\n\r\nIn the Centre there are, slightly towards the Right, the party of Law\r\nand Order, the party of Commerce and Industry, and slightly veering\r\ntowards the Left the Alliance of October 17th. At this moment the two\r\nbranches I have mentioned first (Law and Order and Commerce and\r\nIndustry) have veered from the Right towards the Left; they say that the\r\nGovernment is their common enemy. However, the main fact with regard to\r\nthem is that these three branches of the Centre, of which the Alliance\r\nof October 17th is far the most important, are all constitutional and\r\nall moderate. There are further subdivisions in the Centre about which\r\nwe need not trouble ourselves.\r\n\r\nThese three parties are united in desiring the preservation of the\r\nMonarchy on a thoroughly constitutional basis and that of the Unity of\r\nthe Empire. They differ on various other questions. The Alliance of\r\nOctober 17th is in favour of universal suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Democrats, or Cadets, are in favour of universal\r\nsuffrage, local autonomy for Poland (which they wish placed in the same\r\nposition as Finland), and one Chamber. They say nothing of the Monarchy.\r\nThey are a very strong and active party, and their leaders are notable\r\nmen, such as Professor Milioukov, MM. Struve, Rodichev, and\r\nPetrunkevitch, nearly all of whom are brilliant orators. The Government\r\nhas been so active in repressive measures against this party that it is\r\ndifficult to foresee how strongly they will be represented in the Duma.\r\nThe Moderate parties accuse them of promising more than they can give\r\nand of saying less than they mean; in fact, of being Federalists and\r\nSocialists in disguise, and not having the honesty and the courage to\r\nadmit the fact for fear of arousing hostility among the peasants. On the\r\nLeft of the Left are the Socialists, the Social Democrats, and the\r\nSocial Revolutionaries.\r\n\r\nThe elections are taking place now. I tried during the whole of\r\nyesterday to grasp thoroughly the working of the franchise law. I failed\r\nto grasp it. I asked one Russian how many degrees there were in the\r\nsuffrage. He said four. I asked another; he said three. I asked a third;\r\nhe said two.\r\n\r\nHowever, what has happened in twenty-five Governments as far as the\r\npeasants are concerned is this: the peasants have elected delegates for\r\ntheir districts. Each district elects a delegate. The delegate elects an\r\nelector and the elector elects the member. That is one part of the\r\nprocess. Three degrees. The result of these elections was that out of\r\n222 districts in 23 Ouiezds 99 districts elected supporters of the\r\nGovernment, and 123 more or less Progressive candidates. Yesterday the\r\nsmall landed proprietors elected their representatives in the Government\r\nof Moscow; out of 100 candidates returned 20 Constitutional Democrats\r\nonly were elected. Yesterday also, in St. Petersburg, elections were\r\nheld among the working men of the factories. This led to nothing, since\r\nthe working men boycotted the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe first peasant who was chosen as a delegate for his district in the\r\nGovernment of Moscow was arrested on the 13th inst. It happened like\r\nthis: The peasants met to elect a representative. Amongst them there was\r\none man who, without having any definite political convictions, was able\r\nto make a fair speech. He was unanimously elected. The police, who were\r\npresent, confronted with this apparently unforeseen contingency (that\r\nsome one would be elected), and in doubt as to what to do, arrested him.\r\nHe protested, saying that he had been unanimously chosen as the people’s\r\ndelegate. “Oh!” said the police, “you are a _kreekòon_, are you? The\r\nCircular of the Minister of the Interior tells us to arrest all\r\n_kreekòons_; to prison you go.” A _kreekòon_ means a person who is\r\nturbulent, who cries out, objects, or makes any kind of disturbance. So\r\narrested he was. The peasants, left without a candidate, thought that\r\nthis time they would elect some one who could not possibly be accused of\r\nbeing a _kreekòon_, so they chose a very old man over ninety years of\r\nage. This man, although admirably fitted by the suavity of his demeanour\r\nto fulfil the necessary conditions, could neither read nor write, nor\r\neven hold a pen so as to scratch his mark. So he was disqualified. In\r\nhis place another octogenarian, who still had strength enough left in\r\nhis palsied fingers to scratch a mark on paper, was chosen. In other\r\ndistricts the peasants, hearing of this proceeding, elected the village\r\nelder or the policeman so as to avoid possible trouble. This, however,\r\nis against the rules, so they had to fall back on octogenarians. In\r\nmills and factories the employers encourage this plan so as to avoid\r\nfriction with the authorities. It is perhaps fair to add that the\r\nelections are probably not in all cases so farcical as they are made out\r\nto be. But in one case some workmen who wished to boycott the elections\r\nand were frightened into voting elected a man who was deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\nThe general feeling prevails that the Duma, whatever the result of the\r\nelections may be, will be a profoundly unsatisfactory machine. The\r\nSocialists look upon the situation with hope. They say that the Duma\r\nwill either be red, in which case it will be dissolved by the\r\nGovernment; or black, in which case it will be destroyed by the\r\nRevolutionaries; or moderate, in which case it will be composed of such\r\nconflicting elements that the confusion which will ensue will render its\r\nexistence impossible. Most of the Moderate Central Parties are veering\r\ntowards an alliance with those of the Left, owing to the intense\r\nexasperation which is felt against the Government. At the meetings held\r\nby these Central Moderate Parties violently anti-Governmental speeches\r\nare made, and greeted with thunderous applause.\r\n\r\n                                                    MOSCOW, _April 8th_.\r\n\r\nThe elections have taken place here to-day; and, as in St. Petersburg\r\nlast week, the struggle lies between the Constitutional Democrats or\r\nCadets and the union of the three Moderate parties (the Alliance of\r\nOctober 17th, the Party of Commerce and Industry, and the Party of\r\nRightful Order), which calls itself the “Block.”\r\n\r\nIn Moscow the conservative element, represented by the Party of Commerce\r\nand Industry, is said to be strong; there are strong conservative\r\nelements in the town; on the other hand the Cadets are exceedingly\r\nhopeful. The result of the elections will be known to-morrow night. When\r\nthe results of the elections were made public in St. Petersburg the\r\nattitude of the Right and of the October Party was curious. They said\r\nwith one voice that it was not fair, that many of the electors had not\r\nreceived their voting cards, and that the elections should be cancelled.\r\nIt was pointed out that possibly many of the Cadets had not received\r\ntheir voting cards either, but that they had taken the trouble to go and\r\nfetch them. Every possible explanation was given for the victory of the\r\nCadets save the one that the majority of voters were in sympathy with\r\ntheir programme, and had therefore elected them. The situation recalled\r\nthe state of feeling after the last General Election in England. During\r\nthe weeks that preceded the elections the Cadets complained, and in many\r\ncases with good grounds, that their efforts in canvassing and electoral\r\nagitation generally were being seriously impeded by the police. Their\r\none cry has been all along: “We are not revolutionaries. We are a\r\npolitical party. And we are being treated as revolutionaries.” (The\r\nSocial Revolutionaries are not taking part in the elections at all.)\r\nSomebody lately pointed out to me that if, in spite of all the measures\r\ntaken against the Cadets, they still succeed in obtaining a majority,\r\nthe result of the repressive measures will have been to secure a\r\nrepresentative Duma. He meant that whether the Cadets are right or\r\nwrong, it is evident that they are infinitely more energetic and more\r\ncapable of action than their adversaries, so that if they obtain a\r\nmoderate success we shall be justified in concluding that, had they been\r\nin no way impeded, they would have obtained an overwhelming success; in\r\nwhich case the Duma would have been representative exclusively of the\r\nmore energetic opinion in Russia, and not, therefore, fairly\r\nrepresentative of the whole opinion.\r\n\r\nTo understand their success one has only to read their programme. It is\r\na little book which costs three kopecks, _i.e._, two-thirds of a\r\nhalfpenny. It lays down shortly, precisely, and in perspicuous language\r\neverything which those people desire who wish for a radical change of\r\n_régime_ in Russia: (1) The equality of citizens before the law. (2)\r\nFreedom of religion. (3) Freedom of speech and of the Press. (4) The\r\nright to hold public meetings. (5) The right to form clubs and unions.\r\n(6) The right of petition. (7) The inviolability of the individual and\r\nhis domicile (_habeas corpus_). (8) Abolition of illegal punishments and\r\nextraordinary Courts. (9) Freedom of the citizen to leave his country\r\nand abolition of the passport system. (10) The incorporation of the\r\nabove-mentioned rights in the fundamental laws of the country. These ten\r\nclauses, which could be written on less than half a sheet of notepaper\r\n(I have just copied them from the official programme), form the basis of\r\ntheir creed. Besides these there are further and more detailed articles\r\nconcerning the political organisation of the State; among which there is\r\none which lays down that the representatives of the people should be\r\nelected by universal, equal, direct suffrage carried out by ballot,\r\nwithout distinction of religion, nationality, or sex. (There is a\r\nqualifying clause as to whether the introduction of woman’s suffrage\r\nshall be immediate or not, which is not very clear.) The Cadets\r\nthemselves say that their future behaviour depends entirely on the\r\nGovernment, and that they have no wish to go further to the Left unless\r\nthe Government push them thither.\r\n\r\nI went to look at the voting in one of the districts this morning. It\r\ntook place on the third floor of a minor place of entertainment. A small\r\ncrowd was collected outside, getting thick around the door; at the door\r\nand on the staircase were canvassers of the two camps, those of the\r\nCadets being mostly students. Upstairs a long string of people were\r\nwaiting to vote in alphabetical order, and in a further room, of which I\r\ncould get but a glimpse, I saw a green baize table and some respectable\r\npeople sitting at it. The whole proceeding was orderly in the extreme.\r\nThere has been nothing in the town to-day to tell the casual tourist\r\nthat elections are going on, although the interest in them is keen.\r\n\r\nIt is Palm Sunday, and therefore the customary fair is being held on the\r\nRed Place in front of the Kremlin, and as it has been a lovely day the\r\ncrowd of strollers was immense. This fair is one of the most amusing\r\nsights to be seen in Russia. Two lines of booths occupy the space which\r\nstretches opposite the walls of the Kremlin. At the booths you can buy\r\nalmost anything: birds, tortoises, goldfish, grass snakes, linoleum,\r\ncarpets, toys, knives, musical instruments, books, music, cakes, lace,\r\nikons, Easter eggs, carved woodwork, &c. There are besides these a\r\nnumber of semi-official stalls where kwass is sold to drink, and a great\r\nquantity of itinerant vendors sell balloons, things that squeak, penny\r\nwhistles, trumpets, and chenille monkeys. The trade in goldfish was\r\nbrisk (people often buying one goldfish in a small tumbler), but that in\r\na special kind of whetstone which cut glass and sharpened knives and\r\ncost twenty kopecks was briskest of all. The crowd round this stall, at\r\nwhich the vendor gave a continual exhibition of the practical excellence\r\nof his wares by cutting up bits of glass, was dense, and he sold any\r\nquantity of them. At the bookstall the selection was varied in the\r\nextreme; I bought two cheap copies of “Paradise Lost” in Russian with\r\nwonderful illustrations, but there were also back numbers of _Punch_ to\r\nbe got, some fragments of the _Cornhill Magazine_, and the Irish State\r\nPapers from 1584 to 1588. One man was selling silvered Caucasian whips\r\nwhich, he said, had just missed being silver. One man sold little\r\nsailors made of chenille, which, he said, represented the crew of the\r\n_Potemkin_ without the captain. There was one fascinating booth called\r\nan American bazaar where everything cost five kopecks, and where you\r\ncould buy almost anything.\r\n\r\nI did not, to my regret, find at the bookstall a magazine which, I am\r\ntold, has recently been published for children—children in the nursery,\r\nnot schoolboys. It forms part of a series of publications resembling the\r\n“Bibliothèque Rose” in France. This magazine, I am told, leads off with\r\nan article on Herzen (the famous writer on Socialistic questions), and\r\nthen continues with a cartoon of a man in chains in a dungeon, having\r\ndreamt of freedom, and waking to find he is bound; another cartoon\r\nfollows representing a gallows, or some other such cheerful symbol, and\r\nit ends with an article on America, in which it is explained that the\r\nchildren in the United States have initiated and are carrying on a\r\nmovement and agitation in favour of the extension of suffrage to the\r\nnursery. This is what I think is called a sign of the times.\r\n\r\nCertainly Russia is quite different from all other countries, and by\r\nsaying it is the most Western of Oriental nations you get no nearer an\r\nexplanation of its characteristics than by saying it is the most\r\nOriental of Western nations. You live here, walk about, talk, and forget\r\nthat you are in a place which is quite unique, until some small sight or\r\nepisode or phrase brings home the fact to you, and you say “This is\r\nRussia,” as Vernon Lee in her exquisite book on “The Spirit of Rome”\r\nexclaims, “This is Rome,” when driving towards Monte Maggiore she hears\r\nthe sound of the harmonium, and the school-children’s hymn issuing out\r\nof a piece of broken ruin covered with fennel. Such a moment has just\r\noccurred to me to-night, when driving home through the empty streets at\r\n11 p.m. I passed a church as the clock struck, and I heard a voice\r\nspeaking loud quite close to me; I turned round and saw a policeman\r\nstanding on the pavement, having faced about towards the church. He was\r\nsaying his prayers in a loud singsong; his whole body was swaying as he\r\nrepeatedly crossed himself; in his arms he carried a twig of budding\r\nwillow, which is the symbol of the palm-branches of to-day’s festival;\r\nthese branches yesterday and to-day have been sold and carried about all\r\nover Russia. Palm Sunday here is called the Feast of the\r\nWillow-branches. When I saw this policeman saying his prayers I\r\nexperienced that peculiar twinge of recognition which made me think:\r\n“This is Russia.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n                   EASTER AT MOSCOW—THE FOREIGN LOAN\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   MOSCOW, _April 15th_.\r\n\r\nI have spent Easter in various cities—in Rome, Florence, Athens, and\r\nHildesheim—and, although in each of these places the feast has its own\r\npeculiar aspect, yet by far the most impressive and the most interesting\r\ncelebration of the Easter festival I have ever witnessed is that of\r\nMoscow. This is not to be wondered at, for Easter, as is well known, is\r\nthe most important feast of the year in Russia, the season of festivity\r\nand holiday-making in a greater degree than Christmas or New Year’s Day.\r\nSecondly, Easter, which is kept with equal solemnity all over Russia, is\r\nespecially interesting in Moscow, because Moscow is the stronghold of\r\nold traditions, and the city of churches. Even more than Cologne, it is\r\n\r\n                      “Die Stadt die viele hundert\r\n                      Kapellen und Kirchen hat.”\r\n\r\nThere is a church almost in every street, and the Kremlin is a citadel\r\nof cathedrals. During Holy Week, towards the end of which the evidences\r\nof the fasting season grow more and more obvious by the closing of\r\nrestaurants and the impossibility of buying any wine and spirits, there\r\nare, of course, services every day. During the first three days of Holy\r\nWeek there is a curious ceremony to be seen every two years in the\r\nKremlin. That is the preparation of the chrism or holy oil. While it is\r\nslowly stirred and churned in great cauldrons, filling the room with hot\r\nfragrance, a deacon reads the Gospel without ceasing (he is relieved at\r\nintervals by others), and this lasts day and night for three days. On\r\nMaundy Thursday it is removed in silver vessels to the Cathedral. The\r\nsupply has to last the whole of Russia for two years. I went to the\r\nmorning service in the Cathedral of the Assumption on Maundy Thursday.\r\n“It’s long, but it’s very, very beautiful.” The church is crowded to\r\nsuffocation. Everybody is standing up, as there would be no room to\r\nkneel. The church is lit with countless small wax tapers. The priests\r\nare clothed in white and silver. The singing of the noble plain chant\r\nwithout any accompaniment ebbs and flows in perfectly disciplined\r\nharmonies; the bass voices are unequalled in the world. Every class of\r\nthe population is represented in the church. There are no seats, no\r\npews, no precedence or privilege. There is a smell of incense and a\r\nstill stronger smell of poor people, without which, some one said, a\r\nchurch is not a church. On Good Friday there is the service of the Holy\r\nShroud, and besides this a later service in which the Gospel is read out\r\nin fourteen different languages, and finally a service beginning at one\r\no’clock in the morning and ending at four, which commemorates the Burial\r\nof Our Lord. How the priests endure the strain of these many and\r\nexceedingly long services is a thing to be wondered at; for the fast,\r\nwhich is strictly kept during all this period, precludes butter, eggs,\r\nand milk, in addition to all the more solid forms of nourishment, and\r\nthe services are about six times as long as those of the Roman Catholic\r\nor other Churches.\r\n\r\nThe most solemn service of the year takes place at midnight on Saturday.\r\nFrom eight until ten o’clock the town, which during the day had been\r\ncrowded with people buying provisions and presents and Easter eggs,\r\nseems to be asleep and dead. At about ten people begin to stream towards\r\nthe Kremlin. At eleven o’clock there is already a dense crowd, many of\r\nthe people holding lighted tapers, waiting outside in the square,\r\nbetween the Cathedral of the Assumption and that of Ivan Veliki. A\r\nlittle before twelve the cathedrals and palaces on the Kremlin are all\r\nlighted up with ribbons of various coloured lights. Twelve o’clock\r\nstrikes, and then the bell of Ivan Veliki begins to boom: a beautiful\r\nfull-voiced, immense volume of sound—a sound which Clara Schumann said\r\nwas the most beautiful she had ever heard. Then it is answered by other\r\nbells, and a little later all the bells of all the churches in Moscow\r\nare ringing together. Then from the cathedral comes the procession; the\r\nsingers first in crimson and gold; the bearers of the gilt banners; then\r\nthe Metropolitan, also in stiff robes of crimson and gold, and after him\r\nthe officials in their uniforms. They walk round the cathedral to look\r\nfor the Body of Our Lord, and return to the cathedral to tell the news\r\nthat He is risen. Then the guns go off, rockets are fired, and\r\nilluminations are seen across the river, lighting up the distant cupola\r\nof the great Church of the Saviour with a cloud of fire.\r\n\r\nThe crowd begins to disperse and to pour into the various churches. I\r\nwent to the Manège—an enormous riding school, in which the Ekaterinoslav\r\nRegiment has its church. Half the building looked like a fair. Long\r\ntables, twinkling with hundreds of wax tapers, were loaded with the\r\nthree articles of food which are eaten at Easter; a huge cake called\r\nkoulich; a kind of sweet cream made of curds and eggs, cream, and sugar,\r\ncalled Pascha (Easter); and Easter eggs, dipped and dyed in many\r\ncolours. They are there waiting to be blessed. The church itself was a\r\ntiny little recess on one side of the building. There the priests were\r\nofficiating and down below in the centre of the building the whole\r\nregiment was drawn up. There are two services—the service which begins\r\nat midnight, and which lasts about half an hour, and Mass, which follows\r\nimmediately after it, lasting till about three in the morning. At the\r\nend of the first service, when “Christ is risen” is sung, the priest\r\nkisses the congregation three times and then the congregation kiss each\r\nother, one person saying “Christ is risen” and the other answering “He\r\nis risen, indeed.” The colonel kisses the sergeant; the sergeant kisses\r\nall the men one after another. While this ceremony was proceeding I left\r\nand went to the Church of the Saviour, where the first service was not\r\nyet over. Here the crowd was so dense that it was almost impossible to\r\nget into the church, although it is immense. The singing in this church\r\nis ineffable, and it is worth while coming to Moscow simply for the sake\r\nof hearing it. I waited until the end of the first service and then I\r\nwas borne by the crowd to one of the narrow entrances and hurled through\r\nthe doorway outside. The crowd was not rough, they were not jostling one\r\nanother, but with cheerful carelessness people dived into it as you dive\r\ninto a scrimmage at football, and propelled the unresisting herd towards\r\nthe entrance; the result being, of course, that a mass of people got\r\nwedged into the doorway and the process of getting out took infinitely\r\nlonger than it need have done, and had there been a panic nothing could\r\nhave prevented one’s being crushed to death. After this I went to a\r\nfriend’s house to break the fast and eat koulich, Pascha, and Easter\r\neggs, and finally returned home when the dawn was faintly shining on the\r\ndark waters of the Moscow river, whence the ice disappeared only last\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nThis morning people come to bring one Easter greetings and to give one\r\nEaster eggs and to receive gifts. I was writing in my sitting-room, and\r\nI heard a faint mutter in the next room, a small voice murmuring,\r\n“Gospodi, Gospodi” (“Lord, Lord”). I went to see who it was and found it\r\nwas the policeman, sighing for his tip, not wishing to disturb, but at\r\nthe same time anxious to indicate his presence. He brought me a crimson\r\negg. Then came the doorkeeper and the cook. And the policeman must, I\r\nthink, have been pleased with his tip, because policemen have been\r\ncoming ever since, and there are not more than two who belong to my\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I went to a hospital for wounded soldiers to see them\r\nkeep Easter, which they did by playing blind man’s buff to the sound of\r\na flute played by one poor man who is crippled for life. One of the\r\nsoldiers gave me as an Easter gift a poem, which I will translate\r\nliterally as it is a curious human document. It is called “Past and\r\nPresent.” This one is “Present”:—\r\n\r\n             I lived the quarter of a century\r\n             Without knowing happy days;\r\n             My life went quickly as a cart\r\n             Drawn by swift horses.\r\n             I never knew the tenderness of parents\r\n             Which God gives to all;\r\n             For fifteen years I lived in a shop\r\n             Busied in heaping up riches for a rich man.\r\n             I was in my twentieth year,\r\n             When I was taken as a recruit;\r\n             I thought that the end had come\r\n             To my sorrowful sufferings,\r\n             But no! and here misfortune awaited me;\r\n             I was destined to serve in that country,\r\n             Where I had to fight like a lion with the foe,\r\n             For the honour of Russia, for my dear country.\r\n             I shall for a long time not forget\r\n             That hour, and that date of the 17th,[2]\r\n             In which by the River Liao-he\r\n             I remained forever without my legs.\r\n             Now I live contented with all\r\n             Where good food and drink are given,\r\n             But I would rather be a free bird\r\n             And see the dear home where I was born.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  August 17th, Battle of Liaoyang.\r\n\r\nThis is the sequel:\r\n\r\n                                    “PAST”\r\n\r\n                I will tell you, brothers,\r\n                How I spent my youth;\r\n                I heaped up silver,\r\n                I did not know the sight of copper;\r\n                I was merry, young and nice;\r\n                I loved lovely maidens;\r\n                I lived in clover, lived in freedom,\r\n                Like a young “barine.”\r\n                I slept on straw,\r\n                Just like a little pig.\r\n                I had a very big house\r\n                Where I could rest.\r\n                It was a mouldy barn,\r\n                There where the women beat the flax.\r\n                Every day I bathed\r\n                In spring water;\r\n                I used for a towel\r\n                My scanty leg-cloth.\r\n                In the beer-shops, too,\r\n                I used to like to go,\r\n                To show how proudly\r\n                I knew how to drink “vodka.”\r\n                Now at the age of twenty-six\r\n                This liberty no longer is for me.\r\n                I remember my mouldy roof,\r\n                And I shed a bitter tear.\r\n                When I lived at home I was contented,\r\n                I experienced no bitterness in service.\r\n                I have learnt to know something,\r\n                Fate has brought me to Moscow;\r\n                I live in a house in fright and grief,\r\n                Every day and every hour,\r\n                And when I think of liberty,\r\n                My sight is screwed with weeping.\r\n                That is how I lived from my youth;\r\n                That is what freedom means.\r\n                I drank “vodka” in freedom,\r\n                Afterwards I have only to weep.\r\n                Such am I, young Vanionsia,\r\n                This fellow whom you now see\r\n                Was once a splendid merry-maker,\r\n                Named Romodin.\r\n\r\nThese two poems, seemingly so contradictory, are the sincere expression\r\nof the situation of the man, who is now a cripple in the hospital. He\r\ngives both sides of each situation—that of freedom and that of living in\r\na hospital.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday afternoon I went to one of the permanent fairs or markets in\r\nthe town, where there are a great quantity of booths. Everything is sold\r\nhere, and here the people buy their clothes. They are now buying their\r\nsummer yachting caps. One man offered me a stolen gold watch for a small\r\nsum. Another begged me to buy him a pair of cheap boots. I did so; upon\r\nwhich he said: “Now that you have made half a man of me, make a whole\r\nman of me by buying me a jacket.” I refused, however, to make a whole\r\nman of him.\r\n\r\n                                                           _April 16th._\r\n\r\nTo-day I went out to luncheon with some friends in the “Intelligenzia.”\r\nWe were a large party, and one of the guests was an officer who had been\r\nto the war. Towards the end of luncheon, when everybody was convivial,\r\nhealths were drunk, and one young man, who proclaimed very loudly that\r\nhe was a social revolutionary, drank to the health of the Republic. I\r\nmade great friends with the social revolutionary during luncheon. When\r\nthis health was drunk I was extremely alarmed as to what the officer\r\nmight do. But the officer turned out to be this man’s brother. The\r\nofficer himself made a speech which was, I think, the most brilliant\r\nexample of compromise I have ever heard; for he expressed his full\r\nsympathy with the Liberal movement in Russia, including its\r\nrepresentatives in the extreme parties, and at the same time he\r\nexpressed his unalterable loyalty to his Sovereign.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon the social revolutionary, who had sworn eternal\r\nfriendship to me, was told that I had relations in London who managed a\r\nbank. So he came up to me and said: “If _you_ give our Government one\r\npenny in the way of a loan I shall shoot you dead.”\r\n\r\nAfter that we danced for the rest of the afternoon. The social\r\nrevolutionary every now and then inveighed against loans and expressed\r\nhis hope that the Government would be bankrupt.\r\n\r\n                                                           _April 17th._\r\n\r\nI was looking out of the window this morning and saw the policeman who\r\nwatches over my house, and often helps with the luggage, apparently\r\narrest and walk off with a workman. I ran out of the house and said—\r\n\r\n“Are you taking that man to the police station?”\r\n\r\n“God be with him, no,” said the policeman. “Why should I arrest him? Do\r\nyou want him arrested? He is ‘having taken drink,’ and I am taking him\r\nto a friend’s house, where he can rest.”\r\n\r\nThe policeman had thought I was complaining because he was not going to\r\nbe arrested. This incident amused me, as being typical of the\r\ngood-nature of a class of people who are represented as savage tyrants.\r\n\r\n                                           ST. PETERSBURG, _April 22nd_.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, wishing to talk over the topics of the day and the\r\npolitical outlook, I went to see a friend of mine, a certain Dimitri\r\nNikolaievitch A——. Dimitri Nikolaievitch was a failure. He had started\r\nlife with smiling prospects and the promise of a bright future, but he\r\nwasted his youth and his fortune in dissipation, and after spending some\r\nyears in the Government service as an official he retired and embarked\r\nupon a journalistic venture; but, since he was entirely devoid of\r\nambition, hopelessly unpractical, and fundamentally uncompetitive he\r\nfailed, and was soon forced to abandon an enterprise which left him\r\nburdened with debts. He now earns a scanty income by giving lessons in\r\nRussian to foreigners. His whole literary production is confined to one\r\nor two suggestive literary and historical pamphlets long since out of\r\nprint. I found him at home in his room, which is on the sixth floor of a\r\nlarge barrack in a remote quarter of the town. The landing on which he\r\nlives swarms with inhabitants, and a whole bevy of tailors were busily\r\nat work in the room opposite to his. His room is small, and scantily\r\nfurnished with a chair, a table, a low bed, a few frameless photographs\r\nstuck on the wall, a mandoline, a guitar, and a _babalaika_. The room is\r\nalso inhabited by a bullfinch, a green lizard, and a fox terrier.\r\nDimitri Nikolaievitch himself looks younger than he is; he is rather\r\nfat, with fair, unkempt hair, very light blue eyes lighting up a\r\nwrinkled and rather puffy and unshaved face; his jacket is stained and\r\nlacking in buttons.\r\n\r\n“I know why you have come,” he said to me as I entered the room; “you\r\nhave got to write an article and you want copy.” “Exactly,” I answered.\r\n“Why do you come to me? Why don’t you interview the flower of our\r\nofficialdom or some of our future Robespierres and Dantons?” he asked.\r\n“You know as well as I do why I come to you for ideas,” I said; “with\r\nall those people the wish is father to the thought. You have long ago\r\nceased to wish about political matters, and so your point of view is\r\nquite unbiassed, besides which——” “I know,” he interrupted; “you needn’t\r\ngo on, but before we talk of what is happening I want to tell you that I\r\nhave finished my historical work.” “What work?” I asked. “I think I told\r\nyou,” he said, “that I contemplated—now that forbidden thoughts are\r\nallowed an unwonted freedom—writing a short history of the reign of the\r\nEmperor Nicholas II. I have begun and finished it. It took me ten\r\nminutes. I thought it was going to take longer, but last night I\r\nhappened to open the Old Testament, and I found that the history of the\r\nreign of Nicholas II. had already been written in the First Book of\r\nKings more concisely than I had intended writing it. Listen, I will read\r\nit to you.” He took a Bible from the table and read: “‘And Rehoboam went\r\nto Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him King. And it\r\ncame to pass when Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt,\r\nheard of it ... that they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the\r\ncongregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying, Thy father\r\nmade our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of\r\nthy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we\r\nwill serve thee. And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then\r\ncome again to me. And the people departed. And King Rehoboam consulted\r\nwith the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet\r\nlived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people? And\r\nthey spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people\r\nthis day, and wilt serve them and answer them, and speak good words to\r\nthem, then they will be thy servants for ever. But he forsook the\r\ncounsel of the old men ... and consulted with the young men that were\r\ngrown up with him, ... and he said unto them, What counsel give ye?...\r\nand the young men ... spake unto him saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto\r\nthis people:... My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s\r\nloins. And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will\r\nadd to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will\r\nchastise you with scorpions. So Jeroboam and all the people came to\r\nRehoboam the third day, as the King had appointed.... And the King\r\nanswered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s counsel ... and\r\nspake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made\r\nyour yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised\r\nyou with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. Wherefore the\r\nKing hearkened not unto the people.... So when all Israel saw that the\r\nKing hearkened not unto them, the people answered the King, saying, What\r\nportion have we in David?... To your tents, O Israel.... So Israel\r\ndeparted unto their tents.... Therefore King Rehoboam made speed to get\r\nhim up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. So Israel rebelled against\r\nthe house of David.’\r\n\r\n“That is the whole history of the reign of Nicholas II., and it is the\r\nhistory of many other reigns also. There are no new elements in history.\r\nHistory is a kaleidoscope containing a limited number of bits of\r\nmany-coloured glass, which, by being perpetually shaken, form patterns\r\nwhich recur, and combinations which seem new, but which in reality have\r\nbeen before and will be again. That is why the people who are snubbed\r\nfor saying the revolutionary movement in Russia resembles the French\r\nRevolution are not so far wrong, because the same causes produce the\r\nsame effects, and the situations, though superficially widely different,\r\nare alike in their essentials. Well, what is it you want to talk to me\r\nabout?”\r\n\r\n“I want to know what you think of the present situation,” I answered.\r\n“Providence,” said Dimitri Nikolaievitch, “has been kind to the\r\nGovernment in vouchsafing them a foreign loan, in spite of the German\r\nEmperor’s disapproval.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think that the bitterness it has created among the parties of\r\nthe Left is a serious matter?” I interrupted.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Dimitri Nikolaievitch, “I do not; and for this reason: I\r\nthink that all talk about the loan now is, as Hamlet said, ‘Words,\r\nwords, words.’ What does it all amount to? The Government say that\r\nunless the loan had been made before the Duma had met national\r\nbankruptcy would have ensued. The Liberals say a fortnight more or less\r\ncould not have mattered, and the Government made the loan to be\r\nindependent of the Duma. To which it is answered that the money is\r\nobviously for past deficits and not for present schemes. But, say\r\nothers, the real reason why the loan was made before the Duma met was\r\nthat had it not been made the Government would have been absolutely at\r\nthe mercy of the Duma. ‘That is exactly what we wanted,’ say the Social\r\nrevolutionaries, because, short of such pressure, the Government will\r\nnever do anything constitutional. ‘The Government should have trusted\r\nthe patriotism of the Duma to accept the loan,’ say the Liberals. ‘The\r\nforeign bankers have dealt a dastardly blow at the movement for Russian\r\nfreedom,’ say the Social revolutionaries. I say that this is all ‘Words,\r\nwords, words.’ The money was imperatively necessary. National bankruptcy\r\ncannot be the best springboard for the initial leap of the Duma. And as\r\nto its effect on the movement of liberation—that is, I believe, the\r\npolite term for what I call the Revolution—I do not believe that it\r\nmatters one straw. Supposing the loan had been postponed, the bitterness\r\nagainst the Government would not have been lessened, and national\r\nbankruptcy would not have made the situation any easier for the Cadets.\r\nYou will object that the Social revolutionaries probably would have\r\nwelcomed national bankruptcy. Of course, everything depends on the\r\naction of the Government now. What will happen? This Ministry cannot\r\nface the Duma. M. Durnovo will have to resign. It has been published all\r\nthis week in the newspapers that Count Witte has resigned. We infer from\r\nthis that Count Witte intends either to remain without M. Durnovo or to\r\nleave. But supposing his resignation is accepted and M. Durnovo\r\nremains?”\r\n\r\n“But you do not think——” I interrupted.\r\n\r\n“All things are possible,” rejoined Dimitri Nikolaievitch; “remember\r\nthat; because a course is suicidal that is no guarantee that it will not\r\nbe taken; the contrary rather is true. Remember the story of Rehoboam I\r\nhave just read you: ‘Es ist eine alte Geschichte, doch bleibt sie immer\r\nneu.’”\r\n\r\n“But in any case,” I asked, “how do you think any present or future\r\nGovernment will deal with the Duma?”\r\n\r\n“That depends,” he answered, “of course, on who has to deal with it. If\r\nthe Duma is prorogued after a short session the situation will be\r\nhazardous. On the other hand, the whole thing may go off without any\r\ngreat cataclysm. The Cadets do not believe in the dispersal of the Duma.\r\nBut if we have to take for granted that the higher authorities will\r\nbehave wisely, in order to ensure things going smoothly, our optimism is\r\nput to a high trial. We have so few, we have not one precedent for wise\r\nconduct on the part of our Government. There is one comforting thing I\r\ncan tell you, and that is that I feel certain of this: Whatever\r\ncataclysms may occur, in ten years’ time Russia will be in a flourishing\r\ncondition. Those who talk of Russia being financially unsound talk\r\nnonsense. Look at the country now; in spite of a disastrous war, a\r\nuniversal strike, other strikes, revolution, and armed risings, trade is\r\nsimply humming. The head of one of your biggest English firms here told\r\nme yesterday that except the iron trade all the industries are in a\r\nflourishing condition. Orders come pouring in. Therefore, as regards the\r\nultimate outlook I am optimistic, whatever happens in the immediate\r\nfuture; whether everything goes jolting on somehow, as may very well\r\nhappen in Russia, or whether there is a frightful crash in the month of\r\nMay. Both things are equally possible. So far what has happened is\r\nsimple. The autocracy was made bankrupt by the war—bankrupt morally, I\r\nmean. An attempt was made to pass a sponge over the bankruptcy; this led\r\nto a universal strike; then the bankruptcy was recognised, and Count\r\nWitte was summoned to liquidate the affairs of the old firm. The\r\nliquidation was necessarily a troublous time; nobody was anxious to be\r\nconcerned in it; certainly none of the people who intended to join the\r\nnew firm later. Therefore members of the old firm had to be chosen. They\r\ngot somewhat out of hand. Now the liquidation has come to a close. The\r\nnew firm is going to start business. If it is impeded it will blow up\r\nthe bank with dynamite and build a new house. But such an explosion will\r\nonly affect the staff of the old establishment and not the resources of\r\nthe new firm, which are the kingdoms of Russia—an incredibly rich and\r\nundeveloped concern. If you ask my opinion, I do not think that any such\r\nexplosion is inevitable, but the Government will no doubt take pains to\r\nbring it about. Three years ago a revolution seemed to be an\r\nimpossibility in Russia. The Government have almost succeeded in making\r\nthe reverse an improbability.\r\n\r\n“But all this is, as I told you, ‘Words, words, words,’ and I refuse to\r\nsay another word about politics.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n              THE AGRARIAN QUESTION—ON THE EVE OF THE DUMA\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 SOSNOFKA, _April 29th_.\r\n\r\nTo understand the cause of the present state of agriculture in Russia,\r\nowing to the disastrous nature of which the agricultural question is the\r\nacutest of the problems which have to be settled by the Duma, it is\r\nnecessary to go back to the time of the emancipation of the serfs.\r\n\r\nIt is from this epoch that the ruin of Russian agriculture primarily\r\ndates; it was then that the first crash occurred, and it was due to the\r\nfollowing causes. The landlords, who had been accustomed to obtain\r\nmanual labour for nothing, proved incapable of adapting themselves at\r\nonce to the new conditions, and they did one of two things. They either\r\nspent the money they received from the Government in return for the land\r\nwhich they had given up in fruitless efforts to make agricultural\r\nimprovements—fruitless because, being devoid of practical knowledge,\r\nthey did what was not necessary and left undone what was imperative; or\r\nthey simply spent the money anyhow until they had none left. Hence\r\nagricultural depression. Half the landlords in Russia disappeared, and\r\ntheir vacant places were occupied firstly in a small degree by peasants,\r\nand secondly in a greater degree by merchants, who were determined to\r\nextract the uttermost farthing from their possessions. In this manner\r\nthere came into existence a new and mixed class of landed proprietors,\r\nwho can be divided into two principal sections: (1) Those who let all\r\ntheir land to the peasants; (2) those who endeavoured as far as possible\r\nto carry on agriculture rationally, and arrived, in spite of the\r\nobstacles inherent in the circumstances, at comparatively good results.\r\n\r\nAs everybody is probably now aware, the question of expropriation of\r\nprivate property is being brought forward as a solution of the land\r\nquestion. And the question of expropriation as it is now being discussed\r\napplies to the second as well as the first class of proprietors\r\nmentioned above. With regard to the first class there is no possible\r\nargument against the expropriation of all their land. With regard to the\r\nsecond class, their land, considered from the point of view of the\r\nState, represents a considerable asset. If this land were immediately to\r\nbe handed over in entirety to the peasants, the value that it represents\r\nto the State would cease to exist, because the peasants have not at this\r\nmoment the means of keeping the output of the land up to its present\r\nlevel. And it would be impossible at this moment for the State to\r\nprovide them with the necessary means. It is just because the peasants\r\nare without the necessary means—because, in a word, they are too\r\npoor—that they are asking for more land.\r\n\r\nTherefore, from the point of view of the State, it is clear that if a\r\nplan of wholesale expropriation is put into practice the immediate\r\nresults will be a decrease of public revenue and an increase of\r\nagricultural depression all over Russia. If we look at the question from\r\nthe point of view of the peasants, the relief which they would obtain by\r\nwholesale expropriation would be only of a temporary nature, even if we\r\npresuppose that the distribution of land could be carried out on the\r\nsame scale and in the same proportion as at the time of the emancipation\r\nof the serfs, which is improbable. The relief would be only temporary,\r\nbecause owing to the constant increase of the population the land would\r\ndwindle in an equally constant and increasing process of subdivision,\r\nand the State would be unable to come to the aid of the peasants and to\r\nfurnish them with the means of improving their methods of agriculture,\r\nowing to the fall of revenue occasioned as aforesaid by the\r\nexpropriation.\r\n\r\nBesides the expropriation of private property, what further solutions\r\nare suggested? There are two further schemes which are under discussion:\r\nexpropriation of the lands belonging to the State, and emigration into\r\nthe undeveloped portions of the Russian Empire. There are in Russia\r\nlarge stretches of land belonging to the State and to the Crown; but\r\nthey consist principally of woods, and it is therefore highly\r\nundesirable that they should be touched, for since Russia suffers from\r\nextremes of heat and cold, from dryness, and from the continental\r\nquality of its climate, the woods, which give moisture, are of the\r\nutmost value, especially at the present moment when so many woods\r\nbelonging to private landowners have been and are being cut down.\r\n\r\nNext comes the question of emigration. There exist in Siberia and\r\nTurkestan immense stretches of rich and fertile country; this being so\r\nit is obvious that if an emigration scheme could be carried out on a\r\nlarge scale the land question would be on a fair way towards settlement,\r\nand the State would be in possession of fresh resources.\r\n\r\nThe Left parties in general meet this plan with two objections: they say\r\n(1) that the peasants are not capable of adapting themselves to the new\r\nlocal conditions of agriculture which they would have to face; (2) that\r\nthe expenses entailed by the agricultural installation of the emigrants,\r\nwho would have to be provided with everything, could not possibly be\r\nmet, and that therefore emigration cannot be regarded as a definite\r\nsolution of the land question.\r\n\r\nThese objections are in their turn met with the following\r\ncounter-arguments. It is said that the first objection has been proved\r\nto be groundless by the cases of emigration in Turkestan, where it is\r\nseen that the peasants who emigrate thither adapt themselves with\r\nsurprising facility and rapidity to new conditions, which include a\r\npeculiarly complicated system of irrigation, and have nothing in common\r\nwith the agricultural conditions of Russia proper. It might also be\r\nstated that Russians in general, and the peasants in particular, are a\r\nsingularly adaptable race, as is proved by the ease and the speed with\r\nwhich those who emigrate to Europe and America adapt themselves to their\r\naltered circumstances.\r\n\r\nAs to the second question, that of expense, it is far more serious. But\r\nhere it is objected that the premises on which those who are opposed to\r\nemigration on the grounds of expense base their arguments are derived\r\nfrom the results obtained at an epoch when emigration, like everything\r\nelse, was as badly managed as possible; and that owing to this bad\r\nmanagement hostility towards emigration was aroused among the peasants\r\nthemselves, who as it is, do not care to leave their homes unless they\r\nare obliged to do so. That emigration is one of the possible radical\r\nmethods of solving the land question is obvious. It is further obvious\r\nthat if it is to be adopted a system of investigation into the\r\nsuitability of places for emigration and likewise a system of means of\r\ncommunication must be organised. It is equally obvious that the State\r\nmust not only furnish material aid but moral aid by furthering\r\neducational progress and the amelioration of general culture by every\r\nmeans at its disposal.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say now that up to the present the State has\r\nacted in the contrary sense by every means at its disposal. There was a\r\nmoment after the emancipation under Alexander II. when this was not so,\r\nand efforts towards general improvement were made; this epoch did not\r\nlast long, and progress was definitively checked by the reactionary\r\n_régime_ of Alexander III., which reached its culminating point under\r\nthe reign of M. Plehve. That it is feasible to make for progress in\r\nRussia and that this is not a Utopian ideal is proved by the simple fact\r\nthat in spite of all the obstacles created by the Government, schools,\r\ninstituted by the Zemstva, have flourished, with the result that,\r\nroughly speaking, 40 per cent. of the younger generation in Russia can\r\nnow read and write, whereas at the time of the emancipation of the\r\nserfs, when the Zemstva came into existence, 2 per cent. only could read\r\nand write.\r\n\r\nThis question—the promotion of universal culture by which alone progress\r\ncan come—is the most acute of all the questions now existing in Russia,\r\nbecause the country has been driven by the present system to the extreme\r\nlimits of its endurance—to the very brink of ruin, to the uttermost\r\ndesperation. And it will not, therefore, be surprising if the reaction\r\nin the opposite direction is equally violent, and Russia passes from one\r\nextreme to the other; in which case those who are responsible for not\r\nhaving put an end to the present _régime_, until they felt the knife at\r\ntheir throats, and even then reluctantly, will find food for not\r\naltogether cheerful reflection.\r\n\r\n                                                 SOSNOFKA, _April 30th_.\r\n\r\nI have been ten days in the country and have seen the pageant of early\r\nspring in Russia. The trees are not yet all green, but the blossom is\r\nout everywhere, and the bees are buzzing round it and filling the air\r\nwith their noise. To-day we went to see the examination held in the\r\nschool. The children were examined in Scripture, geography, and reading.\r\nI did not stay the whole time. The children I heard acquitted themselves\r\nsplendidly. I was allowed to look over and mark some of the dictations.\r\nAfter the examination was over we had dinner with the schoolmaster and\r\nplayed “preference.” A neighbour, who looked in at the schoolmaster’s,\r\nsaid that he was pleased to see the Russian Government was coming to its\r\nsenses in one respect, and trying to arrive at an understanding with the\r\nBritish Government.\r\n\r\n                                                      MOSCOW, _May 7th_.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the Russian Parliament will be sitting, the curtain will\r\nhave risen, the drama will be in full swing, and the echoes and\r\nimpressions of to-day will have been forgotten and superseded by the\r\nrumour of more important events. And yet significant things have\r\nhappened in the last few days. The resignation of Count Witte did not\r\ncome as a surprise; we knew during the last ten days that Count Witte\r\nhad sent in his resignation; but the resignation of M. Durnovo was\r\nsomewhat unexpected. It was generally said that Count Witte would go,\r\nand that M. Durnovo would remain.\r\n\r\nThe popular attitude towards Count Witte during the last year must be of\r\nsingular interest to those to whom the contemplation of human affairs\r\naffords a melancholy amusement. The enthusiasm with which the hero of\r\nPortsmouth was received; the further enthusiasm created by his report to\r\nthe Emperor; the Manifesto of October 17th, which everybody knew would\r\nnot and could not have been but for Count Witte; then the gradual tide\r\nof reaction; at first, faults but hinted and dislike but hesitated;\r\ndistrust, latent, but scarcely expressed; then impatient questioning;\r\nconflicting criticism; manifold explanation; and very soon unanimous\r\nblame, and venomous vituperation, hatred, and abuse. When time has swept\r\naway the dust-clouds of partiality, partisanship, and passion, the work\r\nof Count Witte will stand out clear in the impartial light of history. I\r\ndo not think the verdict can be a severe one. Count Witte’s task was to\r\nget to the Duma somehow or other, to keep things going until the Duma\r\nshould meet, without a general breakdown. This task he accomplished, and\r\nhe has managed to get a foreign loan into the bargain. That it was an\r\neasy task not the most fanatical of his opponents would say; that he was\r\nhampered on all sides is obvious; that his instruments broke in his\r\nhands is likewise obvious; that not only no shadow of loyal co-operation\r\nwas shown to him by his colleagues, but that even his subordinates\r\nflatly refused to obey him, was proved by one or two incidents which\r\noccurred during the last fortnight, such as the case of the Kharkov\r\nProfessor, sent to exile by M. Durnovo, in spite of Count Witte’s\r\nexpress and expressed desire, and the case of M. Sipiagin, who was not\r\npermitted to go to Sevastopol, in spite of Count Witte’s categorical\r\ninstructions. Whether Count Witte made the most of his opportunities I\r\ndo not know, and the man who passes a sweeping judgment on this point\r\nwill be bold; but I am convinced of one thing, and that is that no man\r\nin Russia would have performed the task which was Count Witte’s, given\r\nthe peculiar circumstances of the case, better. Count Witte and M.\r\nDurnovo have gone, and their places have been taken by a Cabinet\r\nexclusively bureaucratical and reactionary. What is the meaning of this?\r\nI asked some one yesterday whether this Cabinet was meant to be of a\r\ntemporary nature.\r\n\r\n“It’s put there to be kicked out,” he answered. “Mind you, I mean\r\n_kicked_ out,” he continued, “and not to go of its own accord.” If this\r\nis the case, what my friend Dimitri Nikolaievitch hinted to me at St.\r\nPetersburg—namely, that the fact that a course was fatal, so far from\r\nconstituting a guarantee that it would not be adopted, on the contrary\r\nweighed down the balance of probabilities in its favour—has come true. I\r\ncannot quite bring myself to believe it. It is only when we turn to the\r\npast—to the history of revolutionary movements in every country and at\r\nevery epoch—that we see how, in obedience to some mysterious law, a\r\nfatal mist seems to blind those in authority, and how they deliberately\r\nchoose the disastrous course the perils of which seem to us so obvious,\r\nand the avoidance of which seems to us so simple. In 1769 Junius\r\naddressed the King as follows:—\r\n\r\n“We separate the amiable, good-natured Prince from the folly and\r\ntreachery of his servants, and the private virtues of the man from the\r\nvices of his Government. Were it not for this just distinction I know\r\nnot whether your Majesty’s condition or that of the English people would\r\ndeserve most to be lamented.... Your subjects, Sir, wish for nothing but\r\nthat as _they_ are reasonable and affectionate enough to separate your\r\nperson from your Government; so _you_, in your turn, would distinguish\r\nbetween the conduct which becomes the permanent dignity of a King, and\r\nthat which serves only to promote the temporary interest and miserable\r\nambition of a Minister.”\r\n\r\nIn the same letter he wrote as follows about the Army:—\r\n\r\n“From the uses to which one part of the Army has been too frequently\r\napplied you have some reason to expect that there are no services they\r\nwould refuse. Here, too, we trace the partiality of your understanding.\r\nYou take the sense of the Army from the conduct of the Guards, with the\r\nsame justice that you collect the sense of the people from the\r\nrepresentations of the Ministry. Your marching regiments, sir, will not\r\nmake the Guards their example either as soldiers or subjects. They feel\r\nand resent, as they ought to do, that invariable undistinguishing favour\r\nwith which the Guards are treated; while those gallant troops, by whom\r\nevery hazardous, every laborious service is performed, are left to\r\nperish in garrisons abroad or pine in quarters at home, neglected and\r\nforgotten. If they had no sense of the great original duty they owe\r\ntheir country, their resentment would operate like patriotism, and leave\r\nyour cause to be defended by those on whom you have lavished the rewards\r\nand honours of their profession.”\r\n\r\nFinally, he makes an appeal which has been made at all times and in all\r\ncountries in times of popular dissatisfaction, and has always been made\r\nin vain. The words which I am about to quote embody what has been\r\nthought in this country during all the last months by the vast majority\r\nof thinking people, by all who had brains to think and were not blinded\r\nby fanatical rage.\r\n\r\n“Without consulting your Minister, call together your whole Council. Let\r\nit appear to the public that you can determine and act for yourself.\r\nCome forward to your people; lay aside the wretched formalities of a\r\nking and speak to your subjects with the spirit of a man and in the\r\nlanguage of a gentleman. Tell them you have been fatally deceived: the\r\nacknowledgment will be no disgrace, but rather an honour to your\r\nunderstanding. Tell them you are determined to remove every cause of\r\ncomplaint against your Government; that you will give your confidence to\r\nno man that does not possess the confidence of your subjects; and leave\r\nto themselves to determine, by their conduct at a future election,\r\nwhether or not it be in reality the general sense of the nation that\r\ntheir rights have been arbitrarily invaded....”\r\n\r\nHope, indeed, springs eternal in the human breast; otherwise people\r\nwould not persist in giving such admirable, such simple advice, seeing\r\nhow little chance there is that it will ever be adopted.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning a man threw a bomb at the Governor-General’s carriage,\r\nkilling his _aide-de-camp_ and losing his own life, while the\r\nGovernor-General escaped miraculously. About an hour after the explosion\r\nI went to the Hôtel Dresden with a naval officer who was staying with\r\nme. It appeared that the man who had thrown the bomb was disguised as a\r\nnaval officer; a man in such a costume is seldom seen in Moscow, and is\r\ncertain to attract attention. I and my naval friend had already been to\r\nthe hotel in the morning; when we returned the hotel keeper said to us,\r\n“You are suspected of having thrown the bomb.” It was easy to prove that\r\nwe were not guilty, owing to the presence of the dead man who had done\r\nthe deed. His naked body was lying in a house on one side of the Square;\r\nhe had a horrible wound in his head. The attitude of the general public\r\nwith regard to the attempt was curious. When we got home, people said to\r\nus, “Have you heard the news? What a pity that two men were killed\r\nuselessly, and that the Governor-General escaped!” They talked about it\r\nexactly as if they had narrowly missed backing a winner. Later I heard\r\nof two girls who quarrelled because one of them said that she was sorry\r\nthe _aide-de-camp_ had been killed. The lower classes do not seem to pay\r\nthe slightest attention to the matter. In the middle classes people have\r\nlost all moral sense with regard to these outrages. They consider that\r\nthrowing bombs is a kind of lynch-law; they do not distinguish one\r\nindividual from another, the honest from the dishonest, the harmless\r\nfrom the guilty. But the people who are to be blamed are those who, by\r\nbringing certain things to pass, have created this feeling. When the\r\nGovernment takes no notice of outrages committed on the people, and\r\nallows the perpetrators to go scot free, it is not to be wondered that\r\nthe people are “more than usual calm” when they hear that a governor has\r\nbeen blown up. It is none the less very demoralising for the present\r\nyoung generation in Russia.\r\n\r\n                                                             _May 11th._\r\n\r\nTwo men asked me for some money in the street this morning because they\r\nhad been drunk yesterday. I went to the soldiers’ hospital in the\r\nafternoon, and was much struck by the way in which the soldiers talked\r\nof the Duma. These men, during the epoch which had followed the\r\n“Manifesto,” had been violently against what they called the “Strikers.”\r\nThey had told me that when the procession attending Bauman’s funeral had\r\npassed the windows of their hospital they would have liked to have shot\r\nthe dogs. Now they say that they understand that had there been no\r\nstrike there would have been no Duma, and that on the Duma everything\r\ndepended. One man asked me how long the Duma would last and when the\r\nfirst Parliament was made in England. One of the soldiers asked me for\r\nbooks the other day, and I bought him several of Scott’s novels. He was\r\nso delighted with “Quentin Durward” that the nurse told me he read all\r\nday and would not leave his book for a moment. He told me the whole\r\nstory of “Quentin Durward” with the various conversations between the\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n                        THE OPENING OF THE DUMA\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             ST. PETERSBURG, _May 14th_.\r\n\r\nI had the good fortune to gain admission to the Duma yesterday\r\nafternoon. I think it is the most interesting sight I have ever seen.\r\nWhen you arrive at the Tauris Palace, which outside has an appearance of\r\ndignified stateliness, the stateliness of the end of the Eighteenth\r\nCentury, you walk through a spacious front hall into what looks like a\r\ngigantic white ball-room built in the late Louis XVI. style. This is the\r\nlobby; beyond it is the Hall of the Duma itself. In this long gallery\r\nmembers and visitors were already flocking, walking up and down,\r\ntalking, and smoking cigarettes and throwing away the ashes and the ends\r\non the polished floor. One saw peasants in their long black coats, some\r\nof them wearing military medals and crosses; popes, Tartars, Poles, men\r\nin every kind of dress except uniform. When the sitting began I went up\r\ninto the gallery. The Hall of the Duma itself is likewise white,\r\ndelicate in decoration, an essentially gentlemanlike room. The sitting\r\nbegan about three o’clock. The members go to their appointed places, on\r\nwhich their cards are fixed, and the impression of diversity of dress\r\nand type becomes still stronger and more picturesque.\r\n\r\nYou see dignified old men in frock coats, aggressively\r\ndemocratic-looking “intelligents,” with long hair and pince-nez, a\r\nPolish bishop dressed in purple, who looks like the Pope; men without\r\ncollars; members of the proletariate, men in loose Russian shirts with\r\nbelts; men dressed by Davies or Poole, and men dressed in the costume of\r\ntwo centuries ago. The President walked in to his seat under the\r\nportrait of the Emperor, which is a rather shiny study in blue and\r\nwhite. One thanked Heaven the Duma had not been redecorated in the _art\r\nnouveau_ style, for almost all the modern buildings in Russia, from\r\nMoscow to Kharbin, are built in the mixture of Munich, Maple, and Japan\r\nwhich is called _art nouveau_ (modern style), and in Russia “decadent.”\r\n\r\nThe President, C. A. Muromzev, strikes one as dignity itself. He\r\nexercises his functions with perfect serenity and absolute fairness.\r\nAfter reading congratulatory telegrams from various parts of the Empire\r\nhe proceeded to read a motion proposed by a workman of the Government of\r\nMoscow that before proceeding further a telegram should be sent to the\r\nEmperor asking for a general amnesty for political offenders, and\r\nanother motion asking for an immediate amnesty, proposed by a peasant. A\r\ndebate ensued. The speeches were sensible and moderate. Most of the\r\nmembers spoke against the motion, and it seemed as if the matter was\r\nsettled in the sense that the question of amnesty would be dealt with in\r\nthe Reply to the Address and not before, when Professor Kovolievski\r\nproposed a third course, that the President of the Duma should inform\r\nthe Emperor of the unanimous desire of the Duma for a general amnesty.\r\nWhat struck me most in the speeches I heard was the naturalness of their\r\ntone, and the absence of declamatory emphasis. Several of the speeches\r\nwere eloquent; only one was tedious. Professor Kovolievski began\r\nspeaking in his seat, and went on with his speech quietly and in the\r\nmost natural manner conceivable, as he walked up to the tribune, where\r\nhe continued it, just as if he were engaged in a quiet talk with a few\r\nintimate friends. A second thing which struck me was the respect and the\r\ninstantaneous obedience shown to the President; when he called to order\r\nby ringing his bell the silence was immediate and complete. Soon after\r\nfour o’clock there was an _entr’acte_, and the Duma proceeded to elect\r\nthe thirty-three members by whom the Reply to the Address is to be drawn\r\nup. The members poured into the gallery, and everywhere small groups\r\ncollected discussing various matters; some carried on their discussions\r\nin the adjacent lobbies and rooms; many went to drink tea or have some\r\nfood in the dining-room, where the accommodation is excellent.\r\n\r\nMany of the small groups where the discussion was being carried on were\r\ninteresting. One heard violent ideas and wild words being bandied about.\r\nOne peasant said to a friend of mine: “When I look upon this palace my\r\nblood boils; it was built out of the blood and the sweat of the poor.”\r\nSo it was. “Then you are a person who nurses hatred?” said my friend.\r\n“Yes,” he answered. “I hate, hate, hate the rich!” Another man told a\r\nlady of my acquaintance that he was a Socialist. She asked him if he was\r\nin favour of the land being made over to the State. He said, “No.” He\r\nexplained his views, which were really rather those of an extreme\r\nRadical than of a Socialist, clearly and with intelligence, and at the\r\nend she said to him, “But you are not a Socialist?” “Yes, I am,” he\r\nanswered; and asked her who she was. She said that she was the daughter\r\nof a Count who is a member of the Duma. “I am very pleased to have\r\nspoken with a Countess,” he answered, perfectly simply. I saw a big\r\nlanded proprietor, he came up to me and said, “This is very amusing for\r\nyou; but to me it is life and death.” After the interval the sitting was\r\ncontinued. At 6.45 p.m. the result of the election of the thirty-three\r\nmembers was read out, and Professor Kovolievski’s motion was debated\r\nshortly and rejected. After this the question of closure was discussed\r\nand referred to a committee. Then I left. The sitting came to an end\r\nshortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nMy impression of the whole is that the Duma is far more moderate than I\r\nexpected. I do not think, and I never have thought, that the Cadet\r\nleaders are a set of unpractical idealists or terrorists in disguise.\r\nBoth these ideas seem to me both to be _a priori_ absurd, and to be\r\nconfuted by the facts. Supposing England had been governed for years\r\nsolely by the permanent officials without any control whatsoever—and the\r\nonly difference that I have ever seen between Russian officials and\r\nthose of England or any other country is that the Russian officials are\r\nuncontrolled, and those of other countries are not—supposing that there\r\nwere in England a large party headed, let us say, by men such as Mr.\r\nHaldane, Mr. Asquith, Mr. Birrell, Mr. Balfour, Mr. Keir Hardie, Lord\r\nWemyss, and Lord Percy—I mix up Liberals and Conservatives on purpose,\r\nbecause if in England there were an autocracy, it is probable that all\r\nour Statesmen, whether Liberal or Conservative, would be on the side of\r\nthe opposition—would not the officials and all their supporters with one\r\nvoice say that these men were not practical men? The Cadets are not\r\nidealist professors or men of letters or philosophers. They are educated\r\nmen, some of them learned and experienced lawyers, some of them acute\r\nmen of business, who in any other country would unquestionably play a\r\npart in the government of their country. In Russia (if they have not\r\nbeen lawyers) they have been of necessity professors—if they have wished\r\nto play any part in public life save that of an official—because no\r\nother course has been open to them. On the day of the opening of the\r\nDuma I went to a Cadet meeting of one branch of the party at Moscow, a\r\nbranch representing one small part of the town. The conduct of the\r\nmeeting and the character of the speeches were exactly on the level of\r\nthe best political meetings in other countries. A lawyer made a most\r\nbrilliant speech, based on the soundest common sense. And I am certain\r\nthat if any of our leading political men had been present they would\r\nhave found nothing to criticise and much to praise.\r\n\r\nOf course, the question which is being anxiously asked is whether the\r\nleaders of the Cadets will be able to keep the more violent elements of\r\ntheir party in hand. The violent element does not seem to me to be a\r\nvery large one. And I think that the future violence or moderation of\r\nthe Duma will depend very largely on the action of the higher\r\nauthorities, and of what is at present the official Government.\r\n\r\nWill the Emperor trust M. Muromzev, the President of the Duma? If he\r\ndoes, the two together will save the situation. Unfortunately, the\r\nimpression seems to be prevalent among higher circles in St. Petersburg\r\nthat the Cadets are revolutionaries, Jacobins, and terrorists. If one\r\nhas attended the Cadet meetings, where they are among themselves and\r\nhave no object in concealing either their ideas or their tactics, one\r\nsees that they are entirely separated from the Social Revolutionary\r\nParty, which in its turn looks upon the Cadets with contemptuous scorn.\r\n\r\nYesterday a peasant said in his speech: “We hear it said that we have\r\nmillions of men behind us, and we must demand, not ask; these\r\nhigh-sounding phrases are all very well for a private meeting, but are\r\nout of place in the Duma.” This was a very sensible thing to say; but it\r\nis true, nevertheless, that the Duma has the whole country behind it.\r\nAnother peasant, speaking at a small meeting a few days ago, said:\r\n“Russia has waited for the Duma as the chosen people had waited for the\r\nMessiah. Will they dare to crucify it? No, they will not dare. For who\r\nwould be the Pilate? The Emperor will not be the Pilate, for, if he were\r\nto call for water in which to wash his hands, he would have to wash his\r\nhands, not in the waters of the Neva, but in the blood of the whole\r\nRussian people.”\r\n\r\n                                             ST. PETERSBURG, _May 18th_.\r\n\r\nLast night the second reading of the Address in reply to the Speech from\r\nthe Throne was passed by the Duma. What will be the attitude of the\r\nGovernment with regard to the demands which have been formulated? As far\r\nas I have been able to gauge it, the attitude of the supporters of the\r\nGovernment and of the more Conservative element in the Council of Empire\r\nis this: they say the demands of the Duma are impossible; that the Duma\r\nis not a representative Duma; that no notice must be paid to its\r\nextravagant and foolish talk; that it must be allowed to talk on, and\r\nthat Russia will then see that its demands are preposterous. This I\r\nbelieve to be the attitude of the Government. In support of its\r\ncontention that the Duma is not representative, it alleges that Count\r\nWitte is to blame in having insisted on suffrage by three degrees. Had\r\nthere been universal suffrage, they add, the Duma would have been more\r\nConservative. The day before yesterday I attended the sitting of the\r\nCouncil of Empire, and during the interval I had some conversation with\r\nsome of the members, and these were the kind of things I heard. Then I\r\nwent to the Duma and I talked to the peasants. I asked one of them if he\r\nthought it was true that the Duma was not representative and whether the\r\nopinions it expressed were a faithful reflection of the opinion of the\r\ncountry. He said that the opinion in the country was far stronger than\r\nanything which had been expressed in the Duma. I believe that he was\r\nperfectly right. One can only judge by one’s personal experience, and\r\nwherever I have been during the last month I have found the feeling\r\namong the people dangerously tense and inexpressibly vehement. I said to\r\nthis peasant, who came from the Government of Archangel: “Do they expect\r\nmuch of the Duma in your part of the country?” “They expect nothing at\r\nall,” he answered, “because the Government will never give the Duma what\r\nit wants, and we shall have to disperse.” “And then?” I asked. “Then we\r\nshall take what we want,” he said very calmly. “There has always been a\r\nwall of bureaucracy between us and the Emperor,” he continued, “and that\r\nwall is still there.” Talking to other members I found that they were\r\njust as little illusioned with regard to the attitude of the Government\r\nas the peasant from Archangel. One of them said to me: “Yes; it means\r\nthere will be a conflict.” Another said: “There is no connecting link\r\nbetween us and the Emperor. We must have a responsible Ministry, and it\r\nis on that point that the struggle will be centred.” Another peasant\r\nsaid to me: “We are not opposed to having two Houses; but we are opposed\r\nto the Council of Empire as it now stands, because half of it consists\r\nof the same Bureaucrats who have been the cause of all our trouble.”\r\n\r\nI spent the whole of yesterday and most of the day before in the Duma,\r\nand listened to a great many speeches. The most salient fact about the\r\nsittings of the Duma is their extreme orderliness. People say that this\r\nis because the members are new to their business and that the Duma will\r\nsoon learn to be as disorderly as the House of Commons. It is a fact, of\r\ncourse, that the absence of conflict arising from the friction between\r\nsharply-defined parties contributes to the general harmony. But I doubt\r\nif the Duma will ever be a very turbulent Parliament. Russians have a\r\npeculiar talent for listening to public speaking. I have noticed this\r\nconstantly. I have sometimes wondered, for instance, whether it was\r\npossible for a play to be hissed off the stage in Russia just because it\r\nis tedious. A Russian audience seems to me capable of listening\r\npatiently to act after act of uneventful and colourless dialogue, to\r\nthings which would drive an Italian audience to frenzy in five minutes,\r\nand would bore the British public into throwing a dead cat on the stage.\r\nWhen they act “Julius Cæsar” in Russia the scene in which Mark Antony\r\nmakes his speech loses half its effect by the attitude of the crowd on\r\nthe stage, who stand listening in perfect silence, like moujiks\r\nlistening to a sermon in church.\r\n\r\nYesterday the Duma sat from 11.30 a.m. until past midnight, with a very\r\nshort interval. The weather was stiflingly hot, and yet the House\r\nlistened to a series of not very lively speeches, not only with decorous\r\npatience, but with keen interest. The most striking orators so far seem\r\nto be Professor Kovolievski, and MM. Rodichev and Aladin, the first\r\nbeing remarkable for his perfect naturalness, the second for his rather\r\ntheatrical eloquence, which, I confess, does not appeal to me\r\npersonally, but pleases most people, and the third for his\r\nuncompromising directness of speech and powerful driving force. There\r\nare others besides these, and among them some of the peasants, who speak\r\nextremely well. I asked a peasant who spoke best. He said: “Rodichev\r\nspoke very well, and Jilkin (principal representative of the peasant\r\ngroup) spoke well and quietly.” I mentioned Aladin. “He is an angry\r\nspeaker,” he said. “He knows, but he ought to speak more gently.” M.\r\nAladin has spent many years in England, whither he went as an immigrant.\r\nMirabeau heard Robespierre speak at the States-General (I think), and\r\nsaid: “That young man will go very far, for he believes everything he\r\nsays.” I think this would apply to M. Aladin.\r\n\r\nI heard some one say to a peasant who came from the South of Russia:\r\n“You should think of your common interests; if each class only thinks of\r\nitself what will happen? Do you think that one can be happy just by\r\npossessing land?” Then, in the course of discussion on the state of the\r\npeasants in Russia, he suddenly asked: “How long ago is it since Christ\r\ndied?” When he was told he answered: “When will people begin to be\r\nChristians?”\r\n\r\nLast night, when I was driving home from the Duma, my cabman asked me\r\nmany questions about it, and he said that he had been a soldier himself\r\nand saw a great deal of the soldiers here, and that if the Duma was\r\ndispersed or came to nothing and the Government attempted to exercise\r\nrepressive measures they would refuse to fight, because what applied to\r\nthe peasants applied to them. They were peasants, and the only way in\r\nwhich their lot could be bettered was by the lot of the peasants being\r\nbettered. “The Government,” he added, “does not want things to go\r\nquietly.” It wants a _bunt_ (a rising), so that it can put it down by\r\nforce and then go on as before as in the good old days, but this time it\r\nwill not succeed, because the soldiers will refuse to fire, and there\r\nwill be a row such as there was at Kronstadt, only on a far larger\r\nscale, and St. Petersburg will be looted.\r\n\r\n                                                             _May 20th._\r\n\r\nThis evening, as I was walking home to my lodgings, I was attracted by\r\nsigns of disturbance in a side street off the Big Morskaia, where I\r\nlive. I went to see what was happening. A drunken soldier was lurching\r\ndown the street, making rude remarks to the passers-by. He was arrested\r\nand with difficulty guided to the police station, which happened to be\r\nin that street, by two policemen.\r\n\r\nWhen they went into the police station a small crowd of men, women, and\r\nchildren collected round the door, which was guarded by a small boy of\r\nabout twelve years of age.\r\n\r\nA woman, with a shawl over her head, made an indignant speech to the\r\nassembled public about the arbitrariness of the police in arresting the\r\npoor soldiers. “We know,” she said, “what goes on in there. They’re\r\nbeating him now.”\r\n\r\n“Shame!” cried the crowd, and made a move for the door. But the unkempt\r\nlittle boy who was guarding it said: “You can’t come in here.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, we know you _dvorniks_” (door-keepers), said the woman, “you are\r\nworse than the police.” “Yah!” joined in the crowd, and a child said to\r\nthe boy, with inexpressible contempt, “Ugh! _Satrap!_ Police station\r\nchicken!”\r\n\r\nThen the crowd broke up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n                    FURTHER IMPRESSIONS OF THE DUMA\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             _May 23rd._\r\n\r\nEvery time I pay a fresh visit to the Duma I am struck by the\r\noriginality of the appearance of its members. There is a Polish member\r\nwho is dressed in light blue tights, a short Eton jacket and Hessian\r\nboots. He has curly hair, and looks exactly like the hero of the\r\n“Cavalleria Rusticana.” There is a Polish member who is dressed in a\r\nlong white flannel coat reaching to his knees, adorned with an intricate\r\npattern of dark crimson braid, and he also wears a long, soft, brown\r\nsleeveless cloak hanging from his shoulders, bordered with vermilion\r\nstripes. There are some Socialists who wear no collars, and there is, of\r\ncourse, every kind of head-dress you can conceive. The second, and what\r\nis to me the principal impression of the Duma, is the familiar ease with\r\nwhich the members speak; some of them speak well, and some of them speak\r\nbadly, but they all speak as if they had spoken in Parliament all their\r\nlives, without the slightest evidence of nervousness or shyness. The\r\nsittings of the Duma are like a meeting of acquaintances in a club or a\r\n_café_. There is nothing formal about them. The member walks up to the\r\ntribune and sometimes has a short conversation with the President before\r\nbeginning his speech. Sometimes when he is called to order he indulges\r\nin a brief explanation. The last sitting I attended they did their work\r\nin a most business-like manner and got through it fairly quickly and\r\nwithout many speeches. The peasants think there is too much speaking\r\naltogether. One of them said to me, “There are people here who have no\r\nright to be here.” “Who?” I asked. “Popes, for instance,” he said. “Why\r\nshouldn’t Popes be members?” I asked. “Because they get 200 roubles a\r\nyear,” he answered; “what more can they want?” If this principle were\r\ncarried out in England there would be no members of Parliament at all.\r\n\r\nNobody can possibly say the Duma is disorderly; it takes itself with\r\nprofound seriousness. Only one person has made a joke so far. But there\r\nhave been many dramatic moments; for instance, when the President\r\nannounced that he was not to be received by the Emperor, and when for\r\nthe first time, in breathless silence, one of the Under Ministers spoke\r\nfrom the Ministerial Bench. The beauty of the hall in which the members\r\nsit is increased by its outlook, for the windows form a semicircle\r\nbehind the President’s chair and they look out on a sheet of water and\r\ntrees; a kind of Watteau-Versailles landscape where _fêtes galantes_\r\nwere once probably held. Two peasants cross-questioned me narrowly the\r\nother day about England and English Parliamentary institutions. They\r\nasked me if there was an income tax in England, what sort of education I\r\nhad received, what was the state of agriculture in England, what was the\r\nrotation of the crops (to which question I gave a vaguely complicated\r\nanswer), and how long the House of Commons had existed.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning an amusing incident occurred in the Lobby; on the\r\nnotice-board a telegram from the _Temps_ was pinned, in which it was\r\nsaid that the demands of the Duma were unreasonable. One of the peasants\r\nstrongly objected to this, and said that it might influence the\r\npeasants. It was pointed out to him that telegrams were posted in the\r\nHouse of Commons and in all Parliaments. He then said, “Why don’t they\r\nput up all the telegrams? Why do they choose that telegram in\r\nparticular? Besides, the English House of Commons has existed for\r\ncenturies; our Parliament is being born, and to do that sort of thing is\r\nlike interfering with a woman when she is giving birth to a child.” If\r\nit be urged that the members of the Duma have spoken a great deal, I\r\nshould like to remind my readers that they have got through a great deal\r\nof business in a short time. They passed the rules with regard to\r\nclosure and the Address comparatively quickly, and they have now their\r\nAgrarian Bill ready for discussion.\r\n\r\nLast Sunday I spent the afternoon at Peterhof, a suburb of St.\r\nPetersburg, where the Emperor lives. There in the park amidst the trees\r\nthe splashing waterfalls and the tall fountains, “les grands jets d’eau\r\nsveltes parmi les marbres,” the lilac bushes, and the song of many\r\nnightingales, the middle classes were enjoying their Sunday afternoon\r\nand the music of a band. In this beautiful and not inappropriate setting\r\nsuddenly the Empress of Russia passed in an open carriage, without any\r\nescort, looking as beautiful as a flower. I could not help thinking of\r\nMarie Antoinette at the Trianon, and I wondered whether three thousand\r\nswords would leap from their scabbards on her behalf.\r\n\r\n                                             ST. PETERSBURG, _May 24th_.\r\n\r\nOne is repeatedly told by the best authorities that it is a mistake to\r\ncompare what is taking place now in Russia with the French Revolution.\r\nIt is, I know, misleading, and yet I cannot help thinking that, besides\r\nthe fact of all revolutions having more or less the same fundamental\r\ncauses, and proceeding, broadly speaking, on the same lines, there are\r\ncertain superficial resemblances of detail between the two movements\r\nwhich are startling. What occurred in Russia last year was, properly\r\nspeaking, a prologue; it was not comparable to the events of 1789,\r\nbecause we had not in Russia yet reached the period which corresponds to\r\n1789. But now with the opening of the Duma it seems to me that we are\r\nreaching this point. This evening a Russian friend of mine asked me to\r\nglance at a short manual of French history which was lying on the table\r\nand to notice how striking the resemblance is between the account of the\r\nopening of the States-General and that of the Duma.\r\n\r\nBefore discussing this point there is a greater and more important\r\nresemblance to be noted, namely, that the Constitutional Democrats or\r\nthe Cadets are not only playing the part, but are in their essence the\r\nsame thing, as the Tiers-État in France. The Constitutional Democrats\r\nrepresent the whole of the educated middle class of Russia, and they are\r\nchampioning the rights and the wishes of the peasants. It is, therefore,\r\na case, if ever, of saying like Sieyès: “Qu’est-ce que le Tiers-État?—La\r\nnation. Qu’est-il?—Rien. Que doit-il être?—Tout.” Up to now the\r\nTiers-État in Russia has been politically nothing. In the future it will\r\nprobably be everything.\r\n\r\nWhat do the Cadets want? I find the answer in my French history.\r\n“Établir l’unité politique et sociale de la nation par l’égalité devant\r\nla loi et la garantir par la liberté, c’était là, en deux mots, tout\r\nl’esprit de 1789.” That is also the whole spirit of 1906. People both in\r\nRussia as well as abroad minimise the pretensions of the Cadets because\r\nthey are unaware of the existence, or rather of the nature, of the\r\nmiddle class in Russia. This is not surprising, because the middle\r\nclass, besides having been denied all access to political life, has\r\nproduced no startlingly great men in the branches of production which\r\nobtain popular fame. The great Russian writers and artists came nearly\r\nall from the aristocracy or from the peasantry. Men who have contributed\r\nmuch to modern science have abounded in the middle class, but the fame\r\nof such men is rarely popular. But now the work which the Cadets have so\r\nfar accomplished politically is a work which needs not a few great men,\r\nbut a compact mass of men who are agreed.\r\n\r\nTo go back to the French Revolution. It is striking to read sentences\r\nsuch as the following, describing the opening of the States-General:\r\n“Dès le 2 mai tous les députés furent présentés au roi; le 4, ils se\r\nrendirent en procession solennelle à l’église de Saint-Louis....\r\nL’étiquette avait assigné aux députés du Tiers un modeste vêtement noir;\r\nils furent couverts d’applaudissements. Les habits brodés de la noblesse\r\npassèrent au milieu du silence.... Le 5 mai s’ouvrirent les États.... Le\r\nroi était sur son trône, entouré des princes du sang; sur les degrés se\r\ntenait la cour. Le reste de la salle était occupé par les trois\r\nordres ... le roi exprima, en quelques nobles paroles, ses vœux pour le\r\nbonheur de la nation, convia les États à travailler, en les engageant à\r\nremédier aux maux, sans se laisser entraîner au désir exagéré\r\nd’innovations, qui s’est emparé des esprits.” The powers which were\r\nconferred upon the States-General were similar, both as regards their\r\nextent and their limitations, to those of the Duma, and the spirit in\r\nwhich they were given then was just the same as that in which they have\r\nbeen given here. The members of the States-General cheered the King. And\r\nthe silence with which the members of the Duma met the Emperor recalls\r\nthe phrase of the Bishop of Chartres to the National Assembly, after the\r\ntaking of the Bastille, “Le silence du peuple est la leçon des rois.”\r\nUnhappily the lesson is not generally learnt.\r\n\r\nThe Duma worked hard last week to finish the debate on the reply to the\r\nSpeech from the Throne. The third reading was passed at three o’clock in\r\nthe morning last Friday. It must be noted that the majority of the Duma\r\nseem to have made a grievous mistake in refusing to add a clause to\r\ntheir address deprecating the murder of policemen by anarchists; only\r\nfive members of the Right supported this clause. Later on Friday morning\r\nthe President of the Chamber asked for an audience of the Emperor, and\r\nit was thought that no time would be lost in letting him present the\r\naddress, since all Russia was waiting breathless for the event. Friday\r\npassed, Saturday also, and Sunday, and conflicting rumours as to the\r\nreception of the President by the Emperor were continually spreading in\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nLate on Sunday night it became known that the Emperor had refused to\r\nreceive the President and his deputation, and it was ordained that the\r\naddress should be presented through official channels. The news was not\r\nbelieved at first. The blunder seemed too great. Somebody had prophesied\r\nto me on Sunday that such a course would be adopted, as a joke, never\r\ndreaming that it would really be the case. On Monday morning it was\r\nannounced in the newspapers, and when I arrived at the Duma, I found\r\nthat the place was in a state of agitation. “The Government is defying\r\nus,” was the general expression. An official remarked that the farce was\r\nover; that the Duma would proceed to make a fool of itself by some\r\nexplosion of violence, and discredit itself for ever. This did not\r\noccur. A short meeting of the party was held in one of the Committee\r\nrooms, and Professor Milioukov, in an eloquent speech, pointed out the\r\nextreme folly of any policy of violence, and his party agreed with him\r\nunanimously. This lasted about three-quarters of an hour. Then the\r\ndebate opened; the President announced the intimation he had received as\r\nregards his audience. M. Aladin made a speech in which he gave\r\nexpression to the general resentment at the way in which the Duma had\r\nbeen treated. Professor Kovolievski analysed the situation, and\r\nillustrated it with parallels from the procedure of other countries, and\r\nthen the House went on to the business of the day with unruffled\r\nserenity.\r\n\r\nConsidering the intense bitterness of feeling created by the action of\r\nthe Emperor, the behaviour of the Duma was miraculous in its good sense\r\nand moderation. But the fact that this action was received quietly does\r\nnot wipe out its effect as an irreparable blunder. The peasants were\r\nmore incensed than all, even the most conservative of the peasants. One\r\nof them said to me: “The Emperor would not receive our delegates,” in a\r\ntone of deep resentment, and this evening the telegrams tell us that the\r\nfeeling created in the provinces where the news has arrived is\r\nalarmingly bitter. It is a melancholy fact that if a course is fatal it\r\nwill probably be taken. I have begun to think that the higher\r\nauthorities here are destined to take no single step which is not fatal.\r\nWhen one reads the history of France, one understands people making the\r\nmistakes they made, as they had not the glaring example of the past\r\nbefore them; but it is hard to imagine how people who have read the\r\nhistory of France can persist in making the very same mistakes over\r\nagain. Probably the Government relies—and perhaps rightly—on the troops\r\nwhen the inevitable struggle comes. I asked a peasant member of the Duma\r\nyesterday what he thought about that; he said that he had talked with\r\nmany soldiers, and that they would refuse to fight if it was to be\r\nagainst the Duma. The peasant may be mistaken; he may be cherishing an\r\nillusion. But what is undeniable is the fact that the existence of the\r\nDuma entirely changes the situation of the Army in the event of a great\r\nrising. Because the soldiers now know that, if the Duma falls, the\r\nstruggle of the peasants for land and liberty is lost, and the cause of\r\npeasants is their cause, because they are peasants. In 1789 Paris was\r\nfull of troops for the purpose of keeping order. Paris was like an armed\r\ncamp. Eleven soldiers of the Guard were arrested in July for their\r\nopinions. The National Assembly demanded the dispersal of the troops,\r\n“dont la présence irritait les esprits,” and Mirabeau, commenting on the\r\nline of conduct adopted by the advisers of the King, put the following\r\nquestion: “Ont-ils observé par quel funeste enchainement de\r\ncirconstances les esprits les plus sages sont jetés hors des limites de\r\nla modération, et par quelle impulsion terrible un peuple enivré se\r\nprécipite vers des excès, dont la première idée l’eût fait frémir?”\r\n\r\n                                                             _May 24th._\r\n\r\nI was talking to-night with a very cultivated Russian officer whom I had\r\nknown in Manchuria, who was a great admirer of Rudyard Kipling. He said\r\nthe “Jungle Book” was one of his favourite books. He said he thought\r\nthere was a certain kind of Jingoism to which he considered it weak on\r\nRudyard Kipling’s part to stoop. He did not mean the patriotism which\r\ninspired his work in the sense of praise of England; but the passages\r\nwhich were directed against other countries, such as France or Russia.\r\nHe cited the story “The Man that Was.” He said he knew a true story of\r\nan Englishman made prisoner in the Crimean War. This Englishman had been\r\nvery ill during his captivity and was taken care of by a Russian family.\r\nWhen peace was declared he returned to England. Two years afterwards he\r\ndied, and his mother had been so touched by the way in which he had been\r\nlooked after by the Russians with whom he had lived and by the way he\r\nhad always spoken of them, that she sent them a ring which had belonged\r\nto him and a lock of his hair. He gave me the names. He said he always\r\nwished to write and tell Kipling about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n                              THE DEADLOCK\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             ST. PETERSBURG, _May 27th_.\r\n\r\nEvents here are succeeding one another with such rapidity that by the\r\ntime what one has written reaches England it is already out of date.\r\nYesterday was the most important day there has been up to the present in\r\nthe history of the Russian Parliament. We had been more or less prepared\r\nby the Press for the contents of the Address of the Prime Minister to\r\nthe Duma; nevertheless, its uncompromising character, once it was\r\nrevealed in black and white, was of the nature of a shock, even to the\r\npessimistic. There are certain things in which one prefers not to\r\nbelieve until one sees them. The strangers’ seats in the Duma were\r\ncrowded yesterday, some time before the proceedings began at 2 p.m. The\r\nMinisters’ bench was occupied. There was a feeling of suspense and\r\nrepressed excitement in the air. While the Prime Minister was reading\r\nhis declaration the silence was breathless. One felt that a year ago the\r\ndeclaration would have seemed an excellent one for an autocratic\r\nGovernment to have made. But now, as the expression of the views of a\r\nConstitutional Ministry, it was like a slap in the face. One wondered,\r\nif these were the views of the Government, why it had taken the trouble\r\nto convene a Parliament. Ever since I have been here I have always\r\nderived one and the same impression from Government and Conservative\r\ncircles: that they do not seem to reflect that it follows, if you\r\nconvene a Parliament, that the result must be Parliamentary government.\r\nTheir ideal seems to be Parliamentary institutions and autocratic\r\nGovernment. So far, all attempts that have been made in the history of\r\nthe world to reconcile these two irreconcilable things have met with\r\nfailure. In no wise discouraged by the example of the past, the Russian\r\nGovernment has made a further attempt in this direction. It is to be\r\nfeared that it will be grievously disappointed, judging from the\r\nreception with which the Ministerial declaration was met yesterday\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nM. Nabokov spoke first. He spoke clearly and calmly, without rhetoric or\r\nemphasis, and gave expression to the universal feeling of bitter\r\ndisappointment. He was listened to in silence until he reached the\r\nquestion of amnesty, and then, when he said that the House considered\r\nthis question to be one between itself and the Crown, and did not admit\r\nthe interference or mediation of any third party with regard to it, the\r\npent-up excitement of the House found release in tumultuous and\r\nprolonged applause. Likewise when he said that the House regarded the\r\ndeclaration of the Ministry as a direct challenge of defiance, and that\r\nthey accepted the challenge, he could not continue for some time owing\r\nto the applause and the cheering. It was admitted on all sides that M.\r\nNabokov’s speech was dignified and masterly, and expressed what\r\neverybody felt. He was followed by M. Rodichev, who indulged in\r\nelaborate and effective rhetoric. Too elaborate and too rhetorical, some\r\npeople said; psychologically, however, I think it was wise to let M.\r\nRodichev’s tempestuous rhetoric follow immediately after M. Nabokov’s\r\ncool decisiveness; because when a body of people finds itself in a\r\ntumultuous frame of mind, the tumult must find expression. M. Rodichev’s\r\nspeech reads exceedingly well; and judging by its result it was\r\nsuccessful. M. Anikin spoke for the peasants, and M. Aladin gave vent to\r\nthe feelings of the more violent members of the House. As an orator, he\r\nmade a grave mistake in pitching his key too high; he began at the top\r\nof the pitch, so that when he wished to make a crescendo he overstepped\r\nthe limit, and the whole house cried out “Enough! Enough!” After some\r\nmoments of disorder he was allowed to finish his speech. The general\r\nimpression was that he had gone too far. He would be twenty times as\r\neffective as an orator if he would curb his passion. The _Novoe Vremya_\r\nremarks to-day that it is said that M. Aladin’s oratory is considered to\r\nbe English in style. M. Aladin has spent eight years in England.\r\n\r\nThe most successful speech of the day, judging from its reception, was\r\nthat of Professor Kovolievski, who pointed out that for the Government\r\nto speak of the impossibility of expropriation was an insult to the\r\nEmperor Alexander II., who had carried out the biggest act of\r\nexpropriation the world had ever seen. His speech was at the same time\r\nextremely sensible and passionately eloquent. He said, like Mirabeau of\r\nyore, that the Duma would not go until it was turned out by force, and\r\nthat in reminding the House that an act of amnesty was the prerogative\r\nof the Crown, the Ministry were, as a constitutional body, offending the\r\nMonarch by giving the impression that should no amnesty be given it was\r\nthe Emperor’s will, and that therefore not they, but the Emperor should\r\ninsist on their resignation. The House adjourned at 7.30, after having\r\npassed their momentous vote of censure.\r\n\r\nThe situation is, therefore, now an impossible one. Matters have come to\r\na complete deadlock. The Emperor has promised by his Manifesto of\r\nOctober 17th, and has ratified his promise in his Speech from the\r\nThrone, that no laws shall be passed without the consent of the Duma.\r\nThe Government has made a declaration that it will take legislation into\r\nits own hands, and the Duma has replied by demanding its immediate\r\nresignation. Therefore, the Government will pass none of the Duma’s\r\nlaws, and the Duma will have nothing to do with the laws proposed by the\r\nGovernment. What can be the way out of this situation? The Government\r\ndoes not believe that the Duma is representative of Russia. The Duma\r\nbelieves that it is representative. The Government, I suppose, relies on\r\nthe troops. They say the troops can be depended on for another two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n                                             ST. PETERSBURG, _May 28th_.\r\n\r\nThe following is the translation of a speech made by a peasant deputy\r\nnamed Losev in the Duma on Saturday last. It was the speech which was\r\ncertainly the most appreciated by the peasants:—\r\n\r\n“Until to-day I was moved by a feeling of deep joy. I thought that the\r\nmoment had come when the resurrection day of our tired-out country would\r\ndawn. I thought that the voice of our distressful country would sound\r\nthroughout the land, and would reach the ears of our Monarch. He had\r\nsaid in his graciousness that it was necessary to learn the needs of the\r\ncountry. I have the good fortune to be a representative of the people.\r\nUntil to-day my heart felt joy. Now, I thought, we shall do without that\r\nhour of ruin which threatens the whole country; now, I thought, has come\r\nthe happy time when the worn-out and suffering eyes of the peasant shall\r\nsmile through his tears, the time which shall see the bettering of his\r\ncountry and of his life, when he shall no longer fear the threats of a\r\nPolice Government, when he shall no longer live in poverty and famine.\r\nBut now I will say that my joy was not of long duration. To-day it\r\ndisappeared. To-day from this tribune I heard the terrible words\r\npronounced by the Prime Minister. In clear and brief words he said that\r\nthe solution of the land question proposed by the Duma was altogether\r\nout of the question. What did the Prime Minister pronounce to be out of\r\nthe question? The contentment of the starving country? It is that\r\nMinistry in whose hands we are like dumb animals. And that offended me\r\ndeeply, and I think that not I alone, but the whole country, was\r\noffended.\r\n\r\n“I was glad when I heard the answer to the speech of our Sovereign the\r\nEmperor from the Throne about the resurrection of the country. But I\r\nrepeat that my joy lasted only until to-day. To-day, my dears, I again\r\nlook upon our distressful country. She is once more threatened by a\r\nmenacing cloud of gold uniforms. We see that a whole population, a\r\nhundred millions strong, lies under the yoke of a few individuals and\r\ncan do nothing. Many express their sympathy for us on paper, but nobody\r\ncan help us. They tell us that the fulfilment of our demands is\r\nimpossible. I again put myself in the company of the poor peasantry,\r\nwho, it is true, possess great strength. One can liken the peasantry to\r\nSamson, who possessed exceeding strength. By cunning they discovered\r\nwhat was the secret of his strength, and bereft him of it. They took us,\r\ntoo, by cunning, and by cunning they blinded us. I once more repeat\r\ntherefore that it is a duty not to play tricks with a people a hundred\r\nmillion strong. When Samson felt the power of all the mockery of the\r\nPhilistines he then said: ‘Lead me; let me uphold the columns which\r\nsupport the building,’ and, taking hold of one pillar with his right\r\nhand and one with his left, he said: ‘Perish, my soul, together with the\r\nPhilistines!’ Who forced him to do this? If wicked Dalila had not\r\nblinded him, and had his strength not been impaired, he would not have\r\nwished to do this. They made a laughingstock of him, and he said:\r\n‘Perish, my soul, together with the Philistines!’ And then what? Those\r\nwho played with him perished beneath the crashing building.\r\n\r\n“All the labouring peasantry is in even such a critical situation. They\r\ntreat it like a toy; but, my friends, I cannot guarantee that the\r\nunhappy Samson will support it. He will say: ‘Perish, my soul, with the\r\nPhilistines!’”\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOSITION OF THE DUMA\r\n\r\n                                                            _June 20th._\r\n\r\nThere are in the Duma thirty-five so-called “Moderates,” a hundred and\r\nseventy-six Cadets, eighty-one belonging to no party (mostly peasants,\r\nwith one or two independent gentlemen), about a hundred and twenty\r\nbelonging to the Extreme Left, who now call themselves the Labour Party.\r\nBesides these there are the Autonomists, consisting of twenty-six Poles,\r\nsix Lithuanians, four Esthonians, four Letts, two Ukraine, and ten\r\nMusalmans. If we look into these parties we see that the most prominent\r\nmembers of the Moderates are Count Heyden, a Constitutional Monarchist,\r\nwho corresponds more or less to an English Whig, and has all his life\r\nplayed a prominent part in the Liberal movement, and especially in the\r\nZemstvo meetings last year, and M. A. Stachovitch, also a Constitutional\r\nMonarchist, a member of the noblesse and a prominent Zemstvoist and\r\nchampion of the Liberal movement.\r\n\r\nBesides these two there are prominent men such as Prince Volkonsky, also\r\na Constitutional Monarchist.\r\n\r\nWhen people ask whether these men are capable of managing State affairs,\r\nthe question seems to me to be rather this: Are they less or more\r\ncapable of managing affairs than a man like M. Durnovo?\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent members of the October Party is M. D. Schipov,\r\nwho was not elected to the Duma—a Zemstvoist of great capacity.\r\n\r\nNow let us look at the Cadets. The practical leader of the party is\r\nProfessor Milioukov, the President of the Union of Unions—the founder of\r\nthe party which he still directs. The Government excluded him from the\r\nelections. But although he is not in the Duma, he is a man of\r\nfirst-class ability, practical and moderate; he possesses a complete\r\ngrasp of the political situation. His colleague, M. Hessen, a lawyer of\r\ngreat ability, was also excluded from the elections.\r\n\r\nIn the Duma itself we have M. C. A. Muromtseff: Educated at Moscow and\r\nGöttingen, a professor of law, he was obliged to abandon his\r\nprofessorship in 1864 and take to private practice. He is now the\r\nPresident of the Duma, and there is not a dissentient voice in Russia,\r\nfrom the Court downwards, as to the superlative manner in which he\r\nfulfils his functions. He combines suave urbanity with rigid firmness,\r\nand has at present a complete hold over the Duma. M. I. Petrunkevitch:\r\n“The father of the Zemstvo,” a strong Constitutionalist; one of the best\r\nspeakers in Duma, in my opinion the best, and master of dry sarcasm. He\r\ncorresponds to an English Liberal member of the House of Commons. M. F.\r\nF. Kokoshkin: A privatdocent of Moscow University, a Constitutional\r\nexpert. His speeches are well composed and reasoned. M. V. D. Nabokov:\r\nSon of an ex-Minister of Justice; an expert in criminal law. He was\r\ndismissed from being _Kammerjunker_ for his opinions. He is an excellent\r\nParliamentary tactician and a good, clear speaker. M. F. I. Rodichev: A\r\nbarrister, of Iver; one of the most prominent Zemstvoists; he presented\r\nto the Emperor the famous address of the Zemstva at the beginning of the\r\nreign asking for reforms, and received in answer the command to put away\r\nthese senseless dreams. He was forbidden to live in St. Petersburg for\r\ntwo years. A rhetorical speaker, rather like a rocket, sometimes\r\nbursting into stars, at others falling flat like a stick. M. L.\r\nPetrajitski: Professor of the Philosophy of Law. A lawyer and a writer.\r\nHe speaks the soundest common sense; the temptation to listen to him can\r\nbe resisted easily. M. Hertzenstein: A Russianised Jew. Privatdocent of\r\nMoscow University; took his degree in law; and was employed in the\r\nMoscow Agrarian Bank. An expert on financial and agrarian questions.\r\nM.N. Kareev: A prominent historian. M. Vinaver: An authority on civil\r\nlaw. M. N. N. Lvov: Educated in Switzerland, and took his degree in\r\njurisprudence; a Zemstvoist and a large landed proprietor. Prince\r\nDolgoroukov: The bearer of a historic name. These are, I think, the most\r\nprominent of the Cadets.\r\n\r\nTogether with the Cadets there is another small party who vote with the\r\nCadets, called the Party of Democratic Reform; it contains two of the\r\nmost capable men of the Duma. Professor Kovolievski: A scholar and an\r\nunrivalled authority on Parliamentary traditions. An eloquent speaker,\r\nwho by the charm of his personality has become the most popular member\r\nof the Duma. M. B. V. Kousmin Karavaieff: A Zemstvoist, educated at the\r\nAcademy of Military Law, at which he afterwards became a professor,\r\nuntil he was obliged to resign in 1904. At the request of General\r\nKouropatkin he went to the war, where he held a responsible position; he\r\nis one of the best, if not the best, speaker in the Duma; quiet,\r\npersuasive, logical, and eloquent. Prince Urussoff, formerly employed in\r\nthe Ministry of the Interior, also belongs to this party.\r\n\r\nOn the left is the Labour Party. M. Anikin: A village teacher; a social\r\nrevolutionary, opposed to violence; he speaks eloquently. The abilities\r\nof this party seem to me entirely destructive and in no way\r\nconstructive. M. Zhilkin: A peasant by extraction; subsequently a\r\njournalist; a tall man with big features, light hair, and spectacles.\r\nThe tactical leader of his group. He speaks well and clearly. M. Aladin:\r\nOf peasant extraction, but educated at the University of Kazan, who\r\nemigrated to England. A violent and talented speaker; too violent to\r\nhave influence in the Duma. His speeches are sometimes interrupted by\r\ncries of “Enough.” One of the most interesting revolutionary figures.\r\n\r\nThe peasants either belong to no party at all or to the Labour Party.\r\nThose who belong to no party consider the Labour Party to be foolish.\r\nOne of them said to me that they were anxious to meet the proprietors\r\nhalfway, but the Government thwarted them by being so uncompromising. A\r\ngreat many of these peasants are exceedingly sensible. The Labour Party\r\nis utterly and fundamentally opposed to the Cadets, whom it despises.\r\nThe situation of the Duma as regards the Government, by which it is\r\npractically ignored, continues to be abnormal; for this reason, and\r\nowing to the fact that any active move on the part of the Government\r\nunites the whole Duma in unanimity against it, the creation of further\r\nparties is rendered difficult. The level of speaking in the Duma is\r\nhigh; a competent English Judge here says it is considerably higher than\r\nthe English level. Time has certainly been wasted in talk; but the\r\nRight, and neither the Cadets nor the Labour Party, have been to blame\r\nfor this, and also the abnormal situation of the Duma.\r\n\r\nAs to the current of opinion outside the Duma. The attitude of the\r\nGovernment, that the Duma is merely a revolutionary meeting from which\r\nnothing serious can be expected, is reflected in Conservative circles\r\nwith this difference: that, while holding this opinion, they blame the\r\nGovernment for its action. Analogies with past history may be\r\nmisleading, but, however different the revolutionary element here may be\r\nfrom that which made the French Revolution, the Conservative element\r\nhere is startlingly like the Conservative element in France in 1789.\r\n\r\nProfessor Aulard writes as follows about Louis XVI.: “Ce n’était pas un\r\nesprit supérieur. Les royalistes le disaient bête, parce qu’ils le\r\nvoyaient physiquement épais ... dormeur, mangeur, ... mais il ne\r\nmanquait pas d’intelligence, et sa proclamation aux Français, qui est\r\nbien son œuvre personnelle, offre une critique de la Constitution de\r\n1791 beaucoup plus fine que celle que, de nos jours, Taine en a écrite.\r\nVoici en quoi son intelligence fut inférieure à sa tâche: c’est qu’il ne\r\ncomprit pas qu’avec le système nouveau et le droit populaire, il pouvait\r\nêtre un roi tout aussi puissant, tout aussi glorieux, tout aussi roi,\r\nqu’avec le système ancien et le droit divin.”\r\n\r\nThis last sentence explains the whole attitude of the Conservatives\r\nhere. They do not understand that if you have constitutional\r\ninstitutions you must have a constitutional Government. A man who calls\r\nhimself a Monarchical Liberal said to me the other day that the Duma did\r\nnot represent the majority of Russians, who were moderate, and that the\r\nelections were to blame because the Government had not taken the\r\nnecessary steps to influence them in the right direction, as was always\r\ndone in other countries, including England. This view, which is largely\r\nshared here, revealed to me the truth of what some one else said to me\r\nnot long ago: that Russians of the upper classes here are often more\r\ncultivated than the upper classes of other countries; but they have no\r\nmore idea of the nature of constitutional government than the Turks.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand you have the revolutionaries outside the Duma, who\r\nhave no real notion of constitutional government either, attacking the\r\nCadets with unbridled violence every day, because they say that they are\r\nthe only bulwark against revolution. Therefore between these two dismal\r\nextremes we have only the Cadets; capable and well organised it is true;\r\nthe question is, How long can they remain masters of such a situation?\r\n\r\n                                                             _June 2nd._\r\n\r\nTo-night I had a long talk with M. Aladin, the Radical deputy. He gives\r\nme a totally different impression from the usual Russian “Intelligent.”\r\nHe has been Anglicised. I don’t mean to say this has made him superior\r\nto his countrymen, but it has made him different. He complained of the\r\nwant of practical energy among the Russians. They had not got, he said,\r\nenough to satisfy an English child.\r\n\r\nA friend was sitting with him—a musician, and at one moment they\r\ncompared pistols, when the musician began gesticulating with a revolver.\r\nI felt nervous because Russians are so careless with firearms. M. Aladin\r\nsaid that in England there were precedents and prejudices about\r\neverything; here they were fighting in order to establish their\r\nprecedents and their prejudices.\r\n\r\nI asked him whether, since he knew England well, he thought political\r\nliberty was really a great advantage, and whether the great _liberté de\r\nmœurs_ enjoyed by Russians did not compensate for the _habeas corpus_.\r\nHe said he wasn’t certain whether political liberty was worth having,\r\nbut he was convinced it was worth fighting for.\r\n\r\nNobody can possibly accuse this man either of talking nonsense or of\r\nbeing a _doctrinaire_, but he seems to me a square peg in a round hole,\r\nas Kislitzki was in the war.\r\n\r\nHe does not seem to evaporate in talk. His manner is mild, almost\r\ngentle, and you at once feel he has unlimited energy. That is to say, he\r\nis just the opposite of the ordinary “Intelligent” revolutionary, who is\r\nall words and no deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n                       CURRENT IDEAS ON THE DUMA\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             ST. PETERSBURG, _June 3rd_.\r\n\r\n“The Duma is impossible,” said the Frenchman.\r\n\r\n“In what country of the world are people who commit murder amnestied?\r\nAnd the land question—violent measures such as the Cadets propose will\r\nruin the country. Agrarian reforms can only be gradual.”\r\n\r\nA young man who had lately joined the Cadet party started to his feet.\r\n“You forget,” he said, “that we are in the midst of a Revolution; that\r\nit is not a question of what other countries do in times of peace and\r\nprosperity. What is called amnesty here is called justice in other\r\ncountries, and as for doing things gradually, it is too late. The\r\nMinisters come to the Duma and speak of gradual reform. It is like\r\ntelling a person who has got appendicitis to go to the Riviera and enjoy\r\nthe sunshine. Matters have been brought to such a pass that a drastic\r\nremedy is imperative. The very people who preach to us now that\r\nprevention is better than cure are those who during fifty years refused\r\nto prevent.”\r\n\r\n“As for the amnesty question,” said the man who belonged to no Party, “I\r\nrefuse to discuss it. Both sides tire me with it. You,” he said, turning\r\nto the Cadet, “with your hysterical bomb-throwers, and you,” turning to\r\nthe mild Conservative landlord, “with your bungling police. The question\r\nof amnesty is absurd, because very few criminals are in prison at all.\r\nThe bomb-throwers nearly always either get killed or escape altogether.\r\nThe mass of people who are in prison are there by chance. They might be\r\nin the Duma; it is a mere fluke. At Tambov the other day a clerk whom I\r\nknow of went to take steps about the raising of his wages. He was\r\narrested, together with the man who drove him, and the son of that man.\r\nThey have been in prison ever since. No sort of accusation has been\r\nbrought against them.”\r\n\r\n“And don’t you call that a disgraceful state of things?” said the young\r\nCadet.\r\n\r\n“I was thinking of the amnesty as it affects the Government,” answered\r\nthe man who belonged to no Party, “and I repeat that as far as danger\r\ngoes it makes no difference one way or the other.”\r\n\r\n“But as a question of principle it is impossible,” said the Frenchman.\r\n\r\n“Yes, impossible not to give it,” said the Cadet.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of the Cadets?” said the man who belonged to no Party\r\nto the ex-official who belonged to the landed gentry. “I could not vote\r\nfor them or against them,” he answered. “I feel with regard to them\r\nexactly as I feel with regard to the Japanese; the same combination of\r\nadmiration and disgust. I feel humiliated at recognising myself to be\r\ntheir inferior, and proud at being in some respects their superior. I\r\nbelieve that there is the same difference between myself and a Cadet as\r\nthere is between a Mandarin and a Japanese. Perhaps the social value of\r\nChinese philosophy in not incomparable to the French Eighteenth Century\r\nstrain, which is still so strong in us. At any rate, going back to the\r\nCadets and the Japanese, don’t you see a likeness between the faculty of\r\norganisation that both of them possess, the grasp of technical means,\r\nthe near-sighted enthusiasm? Parallels between the _ci-devant_ Russian\r\nand the Chinese have been worn threadbare. But now we are face to face\r\nwith the extraordinary situation of having, as it were, Japanese and\r\nChinamen in the same country struggling for prevalence. This is why I\r\ncould neither vote for the Cadets nor against them. I feel that they are\r\na superior and at the same time an inferior race, to whom one must leave\r\nthe dirty business of governing the country just as the Merovingian\r\nKings did with the Mayors of the Palace, reserving to themselves the\r\nfaculty of healing scrofula and the divine right of remaining Kings.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t feel that,” said the man who belonged to no Party; “the\r\ndifference between us and all Europeans and the Japanese seems to me to\r\nbe a difference of kind; they are as different from us as bees are\r\ndifferent from men. The difference between you and the Cadets is merely\r\na difference of class and of education.”\r\n\r\n“I could get on perfectly well with the Cadets,” said the ex-official,\r\n“just as I could get on with the clerks who used to be in my office. If\r\nI were the Emperor I would prefer a Cadet Government to a Conservative\r\none. But, for their weal or woe, Russia is not Cadet. The Cadets can\r\nreform Russia if they choose just as the Japanese can reform China. But\r\njust as the Japanese will never make the Chinaman Japanese in character,\r\nso the Cadets will never make Russia Cadet.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t agree with you,” said the Cadet. “The same argument might have\r\nbeen used by an _Intendant_ at the beginning of the French Revolution\r\nwith regard to the Tiers État. They no doubt said then that the Tiers\r\nÉtat represented nothing, because it had not been allowed to represent\r\nanything up to that moment. The same thing is true here. The Tiers État\r\nhas been suppressed politically, and owing to this suppression it has\r\nburst out. It is far bigger than you think, because all your minor\r\nmandarins and some of your major mandarins belong to it and form part of\r\nit. Only yesterday I heard a reactionary complaining bitterly that all\r\nthe officials in St. Petersburg sympathised with the Cadets, which was\r\nscandalous considering that they received Government wages. Besides\r\nthis, the Cadets include all the intellect of the country and all the\r\nmost intelligent men. They have partisans drawn from every class.”\r\n\r\n“I disagree with you,” said the man who belonged to no Party to the\r\nex-official, “on different grounds. I believe the Cadets to be just as\r\nRussian as you are, in the sense of being different from mere\r\nWesterners. The other day a charming old Cadet gentleman whom I know had\r\nsome friends to dinner. They began playing _windt_ at nine o’clock in\r\nthe evening and they went on playing until eleven o’clock the next\r\nmorning without stopping. In what other country would that happen?\r\nCertainly not in England or in France.”\r\n\r\n“Grattez le Cadet et vous trouverez le Russe,” answered the ex-official.\r\n“Perhaps if you scratch the Japanese you will get at the Chinaman.”\r\n\r\n“Surely not,” said the man who belonged to no Party; “but apart from\r\nthis the antagonism between officialdom and the Tiers État is not a\r\nthing exclusively Russian. It has happened in every country. The end of\r\nthe struggle is that officialdom or lawlessness is put under control.\r\nThat is what is happening here. Peter the Great was the first Cadet,\r\nonly he was self-sufficient and had need of no Party.”\r\n\r\n                                             ST. PETERSBURG, _June 9th_.\r\n\r\nThere is a current of opinion which is hostile to the Duma, and I have\r\nlately had the opportunity of seeing manifestations of it. The views of\r\nthe Ministry have now been made plain to us and need no comment; but one\r\nof the ideas which form the basis of their attitude and their action is\r\nsuggestive, namely, that Count Witte is entirely responsible for the\r\npresent state of things, in not having introduced universal suffrage,\r\nwhich, if it had been applied during the elections, say the Ministers,\r\nwould have produced a majority in the Duma infinitely less Radical than\r\nthe present one. I cannot help feeling slightly amused when I hear this\r\ncatchword solemnly repeated, because when I was here before the\r\nelections at Christmas time, the same people who repeat it used equally\r\nsolemnly to explain to me then the utter impossibility and the terrible\r\ndanger of universal suffrage. Personally, I am convinced that whatever\r\nthe system of suffrage had been, the majority would have been Radical,\r\nbecause the majority of the country is Radical. That is to say, there is\r\nin the country a large majority of discontented people. Nobody, I think,\r\ncan refute this proposition. It was confirmed to me the other day by an\r\nintelligent Conservative. When I say Conservative, I mean that he\r\nbelongs to none of the Liberal parties. He explained his point of view\r\nto me thus: “I dislike the Cadets,” he said; “they inspire me with a\r\nprofound antipathy; I think they have played a double game in their\r\ndealings with the Left; I think they drew a line to the Right, and none\r\nto the Left; that they promised more than they could give. They said\r\nmore in their propaganda than they now say in the Duma. On the other\r\nhand, we have nothing better than them. Besides them we have only the\r\nGovernment, which is not worth mentioning, and the Extreme Left, which\r\nis demented. Again, I think they really do contain the most intelligent\r\nmen we have got in Russia now—the best brains, the best workers, and the\r\nbest organisers—and I could only hope for a peaceful issue if the\r\nEmperor were to support them. I consider them the sole bulwark against\r\nAnarchy.”\r\n\r\nI asked him what he thought of their attitude towards the land question.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think the land question can be settled by any one project,” he\r\nanswered, “because the conditions are so different in various parts of\r\nRussia. The Cadets talk of local committees and of the necessity of\r\nexpropriation in principle. I think what the peasants want is capital,\r\nnot land. When the agitation began my peasants came to me and asked for\r\nfive thousand dessiatines. I offered them one thousand, and then they\r\nfound that five hundred was all they could manage to cultivate. I think,\r\nof course, that all the land which is rented should be expropriated, and\r\nI think the folly of the Government in ignoring the question of the land\r\nrented to the peasants was supreme. The Government thinks it can remedy\r\nthe present evils by drastic means, but they leave the cause of the\r\nevils untouched, which is this: there is a mass of discontented people\r\nin Russia, and as long as they remain discontented the disorder will\r\ncontinue. There are some things which could be done at once to render\r\nthe peasants less discontented. They can be given rights if they cannot\r\nbe given land. They are now at the mercy of the local magistrate.”\r\n\r\nThe net result of this man’s opinion was that it is a choice of evils,\r\nand the Cadets are the lesser evil. Yesterday I had a talk with a man\r\nwho bitterly attacked the Cadets and all their ways. He was a member of\r\nthe Duma and belongs to the Left. He spoke in this strain: “The Cadets\r\ninsist on acting legally. It is sheer cowardice. In times of revolution\r\nthe only effective action is illegal action. The Cadets have no right to\r\ncall themselves the Party of the freedom of the people. They are nothing\r\nbut Moderate Liberals.”\r\n\r\n“But what do you think they ought to have done?” I asked. “When the\r\nGovernment refuses to consider our Bills,” he answered, “except\r\naccording to a process and after a space of time which they determine,\r\nwe ought to pass them in defiance of the Ministry and let them dissolve\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“But, supposing they don’t dissolve you?” I asked. I don’t know what his\r\nanswer was, because this conversation took place in the lobby of the\r\nDuma, and the spokesman, who was a Cossack member (not a man with a\r\nshock of hair and golden sequins or silver braid on his coat, but a\r\npale, thin, short man, with large bright eyes and no collar), had such a\r\nfiery and emphatic delivery that a large crowd collected round us, and\r\none of the crowd entered with him into a heated argument, of which I\r\nheard fragments. “We have done nothing,” he said. “We have been here a\r\nmonth and talked.” “What else could we do?” said his interlocutor; “the\r\nGovernment take no notice of us.” “We ought to declare ourselves a\r\nConstituent Assembly. The people of St. Petersburg are like ducks who\r\nhave been fired at. They are afraid of the sight of blood. But the\r\nGovernment needn’t think they have got the best of us, not those silly\r\nlittle gramophones (this to his interlocutor) who repeat what the Cadets\r\nsay, but us, the representatives of the people; we shall have a nice\r\nsurprise for them. We have got terrible means at our disposal without\r\neven appealing to the people. That’s the worst of us Russians: we know\r\nhow to talk, how to write; they translate our books into foreign\r\nlanguages; but we don’t know how to act. I mean the educated Russians,\r\nthe Cadets; but we are going to show that we do know how to act. Every\r\nday for the last month I have acted in a certain direction.”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the philippic was lost to me. One of the arguers, who had\r\njust joined the Cadet Party, and being a young official was frightfully\r\nproud of the fact, seemed somewhat mortified at being called a “little\r\ngramophone.” The temper of the Duma, although its outward behaviour is\r\ndecorous, seems to be rising in temperature. The majority is in favour\r\nof moderation, and at present the majority is powerful. The Government\r\nhas been treating the Duma like a spoilt child which needs humouring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n                       THE BEGINNING OF DISORDER\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            ST. PETERSBURG, _June 16th_.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the political atmosphere has in the last two\r\ndays become sultry. The tension of feeling in the Duma has ominously\r\nincreased, and the feeling of the country has manifested itself in\r\nincreasing disorders. Even among the troops mutinies have been reported\r\nfrom five different towns, and the sailors at the various ports are said\r\nto be in a dangerously excited state. It is now little more than a month\r\nsince the Duma met, and by looking back one can judge to a certain\r\ndegree of the effect its existence has had on the nation at large. Some\r\npeople say the Duma has done nothing but talk. It seems to me it would\r\nbe rather difficult for a Parliament, especially a new one, to pass\r\nmeasures of a complicated and important nature in dumb show. Even the\r\nHouse of Commons, after centuries of experience, has not arrived at\r\nthis. There are four Bills in committee at this moment. The agrarian\r\nquestion is, it is true, being discussed at length before the committee\r\nhas drafted the Bill. But it should be borne in mind that the situation\r\nof the present Duma is abnormal. It proposes to elaborate measures based\r\non certain principles which the Government have declared to be\r\ninadmissible.\r\n\r\nThe Government morally deny the existence of the Duma. A Minister goes\r\nso far as to request a newspaper correspondent to state in the\r\ninfluential organ he represents that the Parliament which has been\r\nsummoned by his Sovereign is no better than a revolutionary meeting, and\r\nthat it is the result of the revolutionary machinations of his immediate\r\npredecessor in office. Besides this, the official organ of the\r\nGovernment publishes telegrams—which, even if they are not (as there is\r\nstrong reason to suppose) manufactured in St. Petersburg or written to\r\norder by willing officials, can only be representative of a small\r\nfraction of popular opinion—inciting the population against the Duma,\r\nand begging the Emperor to dissolve it. When one reads these telegrams\r\none is convinced that they cannot represent a widely-spread opinion, for\r\nthey run somewhat after this fashion: “Great, unlimited autocrat, listen\r\nto us true Russians, dissolve the herd of rebels, who by means of Jewish\r\nmoney have usurped the position of representatives of the people. Pay no\r\nattention to their seditious cries, but listen rather to us, whose only\r\nwish is that thy Heaven-given, anointed, unlimited, multitudinous,\r\nincarnadined autocratitude should remain unlimited. Give us less bread\r\nand more taxes. We are perfectly contented. We have everything our heart\r\ndesires, so long as thou remainest unlimited.”\r\n\r\nIf the British Cabinet were to circulate among the Army an invitation to\r\ndestroy the House of Commons, full of insulting strictures on the\r\nmembers of the House, we should not consider this action to be\r\nconstitutional. But this is what the Russian Government has been doing\r\nduring the last month. The situation of a Parliament which has to deal\r\nwith such a Ministry is abnormal. What guarantee is there that the\r\nMinistry will not dissolve it at any minute and change the electoral\r\nlaw? Not, certainly, the fact that this would be illegal and\r\nunconstitutional. Therefore, on these grounds, and in these\r\ncircumstances, it seems to me that the action of the members of the\r\nDuma, in insisting on having their “say out” on the land question before\r\nanything else happens, is not so needless and not such a waste of time\r\nas it at first appears to be. The speeches of the members are reported\r\nin full, published in the newspapers, and read all over the country, and\r\ntherefore if the Duma is dissolved suddenly the country will be already\r\nacquainted with the opinions and intentions of the Duma on the land\r\nquestion. This is why the fact that the Duma has existed and spoken out\r\nduring a month is in itself one of paramount importance and likely to be\r\nbig with far-reaching results. When the Duma met the Russian people\r\nechoed the French poet’s cry that “une grande espérance a traversé le\r\nmonde,” but they were doubtful as to its efficacy. Now that it has met\r\nduring a whole month, and that people within its walls have really been\r\nable to speak their minds on burning topics without being arrested, and\r\nhave in no uncertain tones expressed their opinion of the present\r\nGovernment, the effect has been enormous.\r\n\r\nLast night I was driven home by a cabman who favoured me with his\r\npolitical views. I attach far more importance to the views of any cabman\r\nin St. Petersburg than to those of any of the Ministers, because they\r\nare more intimately acquainted with popular opinion. The cabman first\r\nexpressed his appreciation of the fact that some people in Russia had\r\ntoo much land and others too little. Count Ignatieff’s estate, he said,\r\nwas a hundred versts long, and he had eight estates. The Duma, he\r\ncontinued, was demanding land and liberty. I objected that the Duma\r\nmight be dissolved. “They won’t dare,” he replied. “But if they do\r\ndare?” I said. “Then we shall kill them,” he answered. “Kill whom?”\r\n“Why, all the rich.” “But will the soldiers be on your side?” I asked.\r\n“The soldiers are peasants, too,” he said. “But before they shot at the\r\npeople,” I said. “Before they did not understand what it was all about.\r\nNow they know,” he said. “Go into any _tractir_ (public-house) you\r\nlike,” he continued, “and you will hear how the people are screaming.”\r\n\r\nSome weeks ago a change in the spirit of the Army, owing to the\r\nexistence of the Duma, was not improbable. It appears to be now on the\r\nway towards realisation. Some of the Guards regiments are said, on the\r\nother hand, to be highly incensed against the Duma. One of the peasant\r\nmembers told me that his brother, who is in a regiment here, informed\r\nhim that the strictest surveillance was being exercised on the movements\r\nand on the correspondence of the soldiers. He said some of the regiments\r\nin St. Petersburg would be for the Duma, but only the minority. I think\r\nit must be difficult for people who have never been here, either in the\r\npast or in the present, to realise that although the old _régime_ has\r\nnot yet been destroyed there is an enormous difference in the general\r\nstate of things owing to the fact that up to last year the expression of\r\npublic opinion was impossible, and that now it is not only re-echoed\r\nunder the protection of the Duma all over Russia but finds a vehicle in\r\ninnumerable newspapers and pamphlets, not one of which is without what\r\nthe Germans call a “Tendenz.” Every bit of fiction, verse, satire,\r\nhistory, anecdote that is now published is definitely and purposely\r\nrevolutionary. The non-political part of every newspaper is therefore\r\npractically devoted to politics. Every day, and twice a day, the same\r\nstring is sounded. Everything in Russia now is tinged with one colour,\r\nand that colour is bright red.\r\n\r\n                                                            _June 14th._\r\n\r\nIn the following dialogue I have tried to formulate the views of those\r\nwho have no sympathy with the Liberal movement in Russia:—\r\n\r\n“I would prefer to hold my tongue,” said the cosmopolitan philosopher\r\nwho had just arrived at St. Petersburg, when he was asked for his\r\nopinion on the political situation. “I do not want to have chairs thrown\r\nat my head.”\r\n\r\n“We never throw chairs,” said the ex-official. “Either bombs or nothing.\r\nBut before you say it I know what you are going to say. There are two\r\nclasses of people in the world: Liberals and Conservatives, if you like,\r\nand there is also a third class. The third class consists of what I call\r\nrecalcitrant Liberals; they become Conservative not because they are\r\nConservative by nature but because they dislike Liberals and enjoy\r\ndisagreeing with them; but say what you think and confirm the truth of\r\nmy diagnosis.” “I will,” said the philosopher, “only don’t throw chairs\r\nat my head. All that is going on in Europe at present seems to me to be\r\ncontained in the formula: Liberty is the tyranny of the rabble. The\r\nequation may work itself out more or less quickly, but it is bound to\r\ntriumph. And as intelligent people favour liberty I have gone over to\r\nthe side of the idiots. They produced an opéra-bouffe in 1870, I think,\r\ncalled ‘Le trône d’Écosse, ou la difficulté de s’asseoir dessus.’ The\r\ntitle was pleasing, but the figure of the King of Scotland was more\r\ndelightful still. He was, I will not say troubled, for it did not\r\ninconvenience him in the least, but let us say characterised, by\r\nsoftening of the brain in an advanced stage, and whatever might be going\r\non he quietly slept through it, only waking up now and then to exclaim\r\nemphatically ‘Pas de concessions!’ I entirely sympathise with him. I\r\nfeel exactly like the King of Scotland, and I don’t care a straw whether\r\nI am right or wrong. Right or wrong concerns our judging faculty, which\r\nis a poor affair at its best, if it concerns anything at all. Siding in\r\npractice with one party or another concerns our passions, our habits,\r\nour tastes, and our private interests. If we have privileges we are\r\nthere to defend them and not to bother, like clergymen and professors,\r\nwhether they are right or wrong. We may be beaten; at least let us be\r\nbeaten fighting. Vive la réaction!” “That is a point of view I can\r\nunderstand,” said the man who belonged to no Party, “but let us ask our\r\nfriend (he pointed to the ex-official) who, although often accused by\r\nhis friends of having regicide principles, has never been insulted by\r\nbeing called a Liberal, whether he feels like that with regard to Russia\r\nnow.” “Yes,” answered the philosopher, “please tell me if you think my\r\nformula applies to the present situation, and whether you agree?” “Let\r\nme start by saying that I entirely agree with your formula,” said the\r\nex-official; “at least I did until a fortnight ago, when I realised (I\r\nwas staying at the Savoy Hotel in London) that I had become (like Kips\r\nat the Grand Hotel) a Socialist. My conversion, however, is so recent\r\nand I have spent so many years in deriding Socialism that I can, without\r\nany difficulty, speak from my ancient standpoint. Well, I think your\r\nformula, with which I so deeply sympathise, is not applicable to Russia\r\nat present. At least it is applicable, if you choose to apply it, but it\r\nis as far removed from what I feel as the diametrically opposed view of\r\nthe English Liberal Press. I do not regard the existing struggle as\r\nbeing one between aristocratic and democratic principles. It is the\r\nstruggle between one half of the middle class, the Mandarins, with the\r\nGovernment and the higher Mandarins at their head, and the other half,\r\nthe professors, the doctors, the lawyers. Above this struggle the\r\naristocracy floats as a nebulous mist, like the gods when they returned\r\nto the Twilight of Valhalla, and beneath it the proletariate and the\r\npeasantry have been roused from their slumbers by the noise of the\r\nfight. My point of view is very simple. I believe, as a statesman once\r\nsaid, that the Russian Government is an autocracy tempered by\r\nassassination. I hope that the professors will, with the help of the\r\npeasantry and the proletariate, create a big enough disturbance to\r\ndestroy the existing Government and prepare the way for a real\r\nautocracy. Then, and not until then, I shall cry ‘Vive la réaction!’\r\nAccording to you I ought to die fighting for my higher Mandarins; but\r\nyou admit it is only a question of one’s passions; well, my passions are\r\nturned against them. I hate them. Of course I would have fought for\r\nLouis XVIII. or Charles II.; but I should have drawn the line at Charles\r\nX., and I should have been rewarded by the result of the subsequent\r\nrevolution.” “I don’t think you either of you realise,” said the man who\r\nbelonged to no Party, “that just as the battle of Valmy (which didn’t\r\nseem very important to contemporaries except to Goethe, who realised\r\nwhat had happened in a flash) was the beginning of a new age, so was the\r\nuniversal strike here in October last the beginning of another. I think\r\nall your talk about autocrats, &c., is amusing, but so very\r\nold-fashioned. I don’t think there will ever be such things—again.”\r\n\r\n“But there are such things,” said the ex-official. “Mr. Balfour ruled\r\nEngland far more despotically than the most unlimited autocrat.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but that is the kind of thing which I believe is on the eve of\r\ndisappearance,” said the man who belonged to no Party. “I believe, and\r\nof course the wish is not only father to the thought—but I wish hard in\r\norder that the thought may come true—I believe that we are on the eve of\r\na social revolution, and that besides this Russia will split up into\r\nseparate parts. I hope this will happen. Had I been an Englishman, I\r\nshould have been a little Englander with a vengeance. I should like to\r\ngo back to the Heptarchy. I admire the England of Shakespeare and Drake,\r\nwhich was little, more than the England of Kipling and Rhodes, which is\r\nbig. I admire the Germany of Goethe and Beethoven more than the Germany\r\nof William II.—and whom? There is no one else to mention. The same with\r\nRussia. All that we have derived from ideals of expansion has ended in\r\ndisaster. If we split up, who knows what the Duchy of Transbaikalia and\r\nthe Kingdom of Kalouga, for instance, and the Republic of Morshansk may\r\nnot produce?” “But,” said the philosopher, “what will happen if the\r\npower falls into the hands of angry demagogues of the Extreme Left? What\r\nif they behave as the Convention behaved, and, more reasonably, what if\r\nyou have all the tyranny of a Convention and none of the terror? All the\r\ninconvenience and none of the excitement? In Russia you boast of the\r\n_liberté de mœurs_ you enjoy; don’t you think you run a risk of losing\r\nit?” “It is true, of course,” said the man who belonged to no Party,\r\n“that we run a risk of losing it, but I have a great faith in the\r\ninvincible plasticity of the Russian character. And liberty of manners\r\nseems to me to depend on national characteristics and not on national\r\ninstitutions. You can prove, of course, that liberty of manners and\r\nliberty of thought flourish abundantly under autocratic _régimes_ such\r\nas those of Nero and Nicholas II., but does it necessarily follow that\r\nit cannot exist under lawful and disciplined administration? Ancient\r\nGreece and Modern England are two cases in point where personal liberty\r\nsuch as that which we enjoy in Russia is nonexistent. ‘Il ne faut pas\r\nl’oublier,’ says Renan, ‘Athènes avait bel et bien l’inquisition.’ As to\r\nAnglo-Saxon countries there is no more amusing spectacle in the world\r\nthan that which is offered to us when a member of the Slav race seeks\r\nrefuge in Anglo-Saxon countries burning with enthusiasm for the mothers\r\nof freedom. Witness Maxim Gorky’s arrival in America. He soon finds out\r\nthat he is enclosed in a brick wall of prohibitions, and perhaps he\r\nthinks with regret of his native country, where, although he was not\r\nallowed to insult his Monarch at a public meeting, he could do exactly\r\nwhat he liked. The rigidity of conventions in England seems to me to\r\narise from the English character, which is rigid and likes convention;\r\nbut the Russian character is not rigid; it is pliant and draws no line\r\nanywhere. That is at once all its strength and all its weakness.\r\nWhatever gets the upper hand in Russia, be it a convention, a board of\r\nSocialists, or a committee of peasants, I am convinced of one thing,\r\nthat the members of this Government will never dress for dinner when\r\nthey feel disinclined or go to bed before they wish to do so.” “But,”\r\nsaid the philosopher, “if you possess personal liberty why bother about\r\nthe rest? After all, free political institutions presuppose a certain\r\namount of order and discipline. If you are without this order and\r\ndiscipline, and if you do not wish for the drawbacks of order and\r\ndiscipline, why do you make a fuss to get what can only exist by order\r\nand discipline?”\r\n\r\n“If we had been properly governed,” said the ex-official, “nobody would\r\nhave thought about it.”\r\n\r\n“The two things are not incompatible,” said the man who belonged to no\r\nParty. “You can have free political institutions sufficiently ordered\r\nand disciplined, and you can also have personal liberty. If these two\r\nthings have never been combined before, we will be the first people to\r\ncombine them.”\r\n\r\n                                            ST. PETERSBURG, _June 19th_.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday last I went by train to a place called Terrioki, in Finland,\r\nwhere a meeting was to be held by the Labour Party of the Duma. The\r\ntrain was crowded with people who looked more like holiday-makers than\r\npolitical supporters of the Extreme Left—so crowded that one had to\r\nstand up on the platform outside the carriage throughout the journey. It\r\nis of no consequence in Russia how many people there are in a train or\r\nwhat they do. In England there is an impressive warning in the railway\r\ncarriages about being fined a sum not exceeding forty shillings. In\r\nRussia there is also a quantity of printed rules. The difference is\r\nthis—in England, if you infringed the rules, something would be sure to\r\nhappen. In Russia nobody pays the slightest attention to any rule and\r\nnothing happens. You are not fined a sum not exceeding forty shillings;\r\non the other hand, a young man not long ago, owing to the habit he had\r\nacquired—a habit universally practised by passengers on the line—of\r\njumping out of the train long before it had reached the station, slipped\r\non the step, and was nearly killed. This is a small instance of what\r\npeople mean when they allude to the personal liberty prevalent in\r\nRussia. It is also an explanation of the existence of the quantity of\r\nprinted regulations you see in Russia. The authorities print a hundred\r\nrules in the hope that one of them may meet with attention. None of them\r\ncommands attention. I will give another small instance. If a stranger to\r\nEurope came to Europe and to England and tried to get into the House of\r\nCommons without a ticket and without being acquainted with a member, he\r\nwould find it, I think, impossible to obtain admittance. If he went to\r\nRussia he could, if he said nothing at all, walk into the Duma without\r\nthe slightest difficulty. The whole secret of avoiding bothers in Russia\r\nis not to bother people who do not wish to be bothered. If you do what\r\nyou wish to do quietly nobody interferes with you. If you ask you will\r\nprobably be told it is impossible—it is in theory, but not in practice.\r\n\r\nBut to go back to the political meeting in Finland. After a journey of\r\nan hour and a quarter we arrived at Terrioki. The crowd leapt from the\r\ntrain and immediately unfurled red flags and sang the “Marseillaise.”\r\nThe crowd occupied the second line, and a policeman observed that, as\r\nanother train was coming in and would occupy that line, it would be\r\nadvisable if they were to move on. “What, police even here in free\r\nFinland?” somebody cried. “The police are elected here by the people,”\r\nwas the pacifying reply, and the crowd moved on, formed into a\r\nprocession six abreast, and started marching to the gardens where the\r\nmeeting was to be held, singing the “Marseillaise” and other songs all\r\nthe way. The dust was so abundant that, after marching with the\r\nprocession for some time, I took a cab and told the driver to take me to\r\nthe meeting. We drove off at a brisk speed past innumerable wooden\r\nhouses, villas, shops (where Finnish knives and English tobacco are\r\nsold) into a wood. After we had driven for twenty minutes I asked the\r\ndriver if we still had far to go. He turned round and, smiling, said in\r\npidgin-Russian (he was a Finn), “Me not know where you want go.” Then we\r\nturned back, and, after a long search and much questioning of\r\npassers-by, found the garden, into which one was admitted by ticket.\r\n(Here, again, any one could get in.) In a large grassy and green garden,\r\nshady with many trees, a kind of wooden semicircular proscenium had been\r\nerected, and in one part of it was a low and exiguous platform not more\r\nspacious than a table. On the proscenium the red flags were hung. In\r\nfront of the table there were a few benches, but the greater part of the\r\npublic stood and formed a large crowd. The inhabitants of the villas\r\nwere here in large numbers; there were not many workmen, but a number of\r\nstudents and various other members of the “Intelligenzia”; young men\r\nwith undisciplined hair and young ladies in large _art nouveau_ hats and\r\n_Reformkleider_. (I wonder whether this last mentioned garment has\r\npenetrated to London.) M. Jilkin, the leader of the Labour Party in the\r\nDuma, took the chair.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was opened by a man who laid stress on the necessity of a\r\nConstituent Assembly. The speeches succeeded one another. Students\r\nclimbed up into the pine-trees and on the roof of the proscenium. Others\r\nlay on the grass behind the crowd. “Land and Liberty” was the burden of\r\nthe speeches. There was nothing new or striking said. The hackneyed\r\ncommonplaces were rolled out one after another. Indignation, threats,\r\nmenaces, blood and thunder. And all the time the sun shone hotter and\r\n“all Nature looked smiling and gay.” The audience applauded, but no\r\nfierceness of invective, no torrent of rhetoric managed to make the\r\nmeeting a serious one. Nature is stronger than speeches, and sunshine\r\nmore potent than rant. It is true the audience were enjoying themselves;\r\nbut they were enjoying the outing, and the speeches were an agreeable\r\nincidental accompaniment; they enjoyed the attacks on the powers that\r\nbe, as the Bank-holiday maker enjoys Aunt Sally at the seaside. Some\r\nFinns spoke in Russian and Finnish, and then M. Aladin, the prominent\r\nmember of the Duma, made a real speech. As he rose he met with an\r\novation. M. Aladin is of peasant extraction. He passed through the\r\nUniversity in Russia, emigrated to London, was a dock labourer, a\r\nprinter’s devil, a journalist, an electrical engineer, a teacher of\r\nRussian; he speaks French and German perfectly, and English so well that\r\nhe speaks Russian with a London accent. M. Aladin has, as I have said, a\r\ngreat contempt for the methods of the Russian revolutionaries, and he\r\nexpressed something of it on this occasion. He said that only people\r\nwithout any stuff in them would demand a Constituent Assembly. “You\r\ndon’t demand a Constituent Assembly, you constitute it,” he said. “It\r\nwas humiliating,” he continued, “that citizens of a big country like\r\nRussia should be obliged to come to Finland in order to speak their\r\nminds freely. It was time to cease being a people of slaves, and time to\r\nbe a revolutionary people. The Russian people would never be free until\r\nthey showed by their acts that they meant to be free.” M. Aladin speaks\r\nwithout any gesticulation. He is a dark, shortish man, with a small\r\nmoustache and grey serious eyes, short hair, and a great command of\r\nincisive mordant language. His oratory is, as I have said before,\r\nEnglish in style. On this occasion it was particularly nervous and\r\npithy. He did not, however, succeed in turning that audience of\r\nholiday-makers into a revolutionary meeting. The inhabitants of the\r\nvillas clapped. The young ladies in large hats chortled with delight. It\r\nwas a glorious picnic; an ecstatic game of Aunt Sally. And when the\r\ninterval came the public rushed to the restaurants. There was one on the\r\nsea-shore, with a military band playing. There was a beach and a pier\r\nand boats and bathers. Here was the true inwardness of the meeting. Many\r\npeople remained on the beach for the rest of the afternoon. The Social\r\nDemocrats who had been present were displeased with M. Aladin’s speech.\r\nGroups formed in the garden. People lay down on the grass, and political\r\ndiscussions were held by recumbent speakers. When they reached a certain\r\npitch of excitement they knelt.\r\n\r\nTwo men attracted my attention by the heated argument in which they were\r\nengaged, kneeling opposite each other in a circle of recumbent\r\nlisteners. Presently a bell rang and the meeting was resumed. I said to\r\none of the arguers: “Why do you all quarrel so much? You are disunited,\r\nand there is only one Government.” He took me aside and explained his\r\nviews. He was a tall, bearded, intelligent-looking man, a native of the\r\nUrals; he had been a soldier and an engineer, and had had to leave the\r\ncountry for his opinions. He had educated himself in France, Germany,\r\nand Belgium, and had attended a Labour Congress in London. He was a\r\nSocial Democrat. He said this meeting was absurd. “You see the real\r\nworkmen can’t come to a meeting like this; it’s too expensive. I was\r\ndisappointed in Aladin’s speech. I think he is unfair in blaming us for\r\nbeing feeble compared with the French revolutionaries. The circumstances\r\nare different. We have the proletariate here, and that important fact\r\nmakes a great difference.” I asked him if he thought there would be a\r\nsocial revolution in Russia. He said he thought Socialism must be\r\nadopted by all countries at the same moment. He thought that the Russian\r\npeople were less capable of introducing it than any people. “When these\r\npeople talk the poverty of their thought appals me,” he said. “And then\r\nthe monotony of the tragic note—never a gleam of humour; never a touch\r\nof irony. Count Heyden is the only man in the Duma who shows any signs\r\nof it. Look at our Government, they lay themselves open to ridicule. By\r\nridicule one can pulverise them; nobody thinks of doing it, and the\r\nstrain of this long-drawn-out tragic emphasis is intolerable. Yes, I was\r\ndisappointed in Aladin. But the first time I saw him I was convinced\r\nthat he would play a part in the Russian Revolution. It is a good thing\r\nthat such men should be. Gapon, however much we may blame him, played a\r\ngreat part.” I found he thoroughly disbelieved in the Cadets and\r\nbelieved only in the proletariate. Later on other speeches were made\r\ndenouncing the Cadets and the foreign loan, and a resolution was passed\r\nrepudiating it. The meeting went on till past seven o’clock, and then\r\nthe mass of people returned to St. Petersburg, having thoroughly enjoyed\r\ntheir picnic.\r\n\r\nI went to the Duma yesterday afternoon and heard some of the speeches of\r\nthe much-abused Cadets. It was like listening to Mr. Asquith and Mr.\r\nHaldane after a dose of Hyde Park oratory. But because people appear to\r\none to talk nonsense that is no proof that they will not get the upper\r\nhand. “Vous êtes des verbiageurs,” said the Duc de Biron to the\r\nrevolutionary tribunal. They guillotined him nevertheless. And Danton\r\nsaid that Robespierre was not capable “de faire cuire un œuf.” Yet\r\nRobespierre played a part in the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n                        PRINCE URUSSOFF’S SPEECH\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            ST. PETERSBURG, _June 22nd_.\r\n\r\nThe speech made by Prince Urussoff last Friday in reply to the Minister\r\nof the Interior is generally considered here to be the most important\r\nutterance which has as yet been made within the walls of the Duma.\r\nPrince Urussoff occupied for a short period a post in the Ministry of\r\nthe Interior during the late Ministry. His speech is not only important\r\nfrom the fact of its being authoritative, and because it throws a\r\nstartlingly interesting light on some of the causes of the Jewish\r\nmassacres, but also because it reveals the evil which is practically at\r\nthe root of all the trouble in Russia.\r\n\r\n“REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE,—I rise to submit to your consideration a\r\nfew observations regarding the question put to the Ministry by the Duma\r\nand the answer to that question which we have just heard. I presume that\r\nwe are considering the information respecting a printing-press concealed\r\nin the recesses of the Police Department, by which proclamations to the\r\npeople are printed inciting them to civil war, not so much in the light\r\nof a fact which belongs to the past and interests us only so far as the\r\nresponsibility of certain individuals is concerned, but rather in the\r\nlight of an alarming question as to a possibility of the further\r\nparticipation of Government officials in the preparation of those\r\nsanguinary tragedies for which we have been notorious during a dismal\r\nepoch, and which, as the events of the last few days have shown,\r\ncontinue to occur, to the indignation of all those to whom human life\r\nand the fair fame of the Russian Empire are precious. Let me state at\r\nthe outset that I do not for a moment doubt of the sincerity of the\r\ndeclaration made by the Minister of the Interior, and that the words\r\nwhich I wish to say to you are not directed against the Ministry.\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, the whole significance, the whole interest, the whole\r\nimportance of the question at issue lie precisely in the fact that\r\nmassacres and civil strife, owing to the circumstances now obtaining,\r\ncontinue and will continue, quite independently of the action taken with\r\nregard to them by one Minister of the Interior or another, or by one\r\nMinistry or another. With regard to this point the declaration of the\r\nMinister of the Interior does not seem to me convincing, and I will now\r\ntry to explain why, with this end in view, I must deal with the question\r\nof the massacres, and try to unravel and explain the part played in them\r\nby the printing-press which was the subject of our question.\r\n\r\n“By a careful investigation of the massacres the enquirer is brought\r\nface to face with certain definite and isolated phenomena. First, the\r\nmassacre is always preceded by reports of its preparation, accompanied\r\nby the issue of inflammatory proclamations, which are uniform both as\r\nregards subject-matter and style. Secondly, when the massacre occurs,\r\nthe facts which are officially stated to be its cause invariably prove\r\nto be false. Thirdly, the action of those who take part in the massacre\r\nreveals a certain organisation, which deprives it of all accidental and\r\nelemental characteristics. Those who take part in the massacre act in\r\nthe consciousness of some right, in the consciousness of impunity, and\r\nthey only continue acting till this consciousness is shaken; when that\r\nmoment arrives the massacre ceases swiftly and easily. Further, in the\r\naction of the police there is never any uniformity, and while certain\r\npolice districts are devastated by the massacres under the eyes of a\r\nconsiderable constabulary force, others remain almost untouched owing to\r\nthe protection of the police, who perform their duties conscientiously\r\nand energetically. Finally, when the massacre is over, arrests are made,\r\nand the authorities who examine the culprits cannot help having the\r\nimpression that those who have been brought before them are less like\r\ncriminals than ignorant people who have been deceived by some definite\r\nthing. Thus we feel that some kind of uniform and widely-planned\r\norganisation exists. Those who affirm that it is simply the doing of the\r\nGovernment, and think that the question is thereby settled, are\r\nmistaken, but they are not wholly mistaken; and the events of the past\r\nwinter, which form the subject of our question, will help us to throw\r\nsome light on these dark proceedings. In January, 1905, a great quantity\r\nof well-printed proclamations, which had been widely circulated in the\r\nchief centres of Southern and Western Russia, together with alarming\r\ncomplaints regarding the preparation of massacres in Vilna, Bielostok,\r\nKieff, &c., came into the hands of some one who occupied a subordinate\r\nposition in the Ministry of the Interior, and who was well known as an\r\nenemy of massacres (I am not speaking of myself).\r\n\r\n“The massacre at Homel in January confirmed the fears which had been\r\nexpressed, and spurred the above-mentioned individual to spare no\r\nefforts to prevent further massacres, which he succeeded in doing owing\r\nto the steps taken by the Prime Minister (Count Witte), who gradually\r\nsucceeded in discovering the working of the hidden organisation. It was\r\nthen that the following facts concerning the action of the\r\nmassacre-mongers came to light. A group of persons, forming the active\r\nmilitia of our own ‘patriotic’ societies, working together with people\r\nclosely related to a certain newspaper (_The Moscow Gazette_) started an\r\nactive anti-revolutionary movement. Being ‘patriots’ in the sense\r\nrecently defined by the member for Tver and ‘full Russians,’ they\r\ndiscovered the cause of the revolution to lie in the non-Russian races,\r\nin the inhabitants of the outlying districts, and among the Jews. They\r\ncalled on the Russian people, and especially the Russian soldiers, to\r\ngrapple with the rebels, in ten thousands of proclamations of the most\r\nrepulsive character. These proclamations were transmitted by members of\r\nthe society to the place of action, and handed over there to their local\r\nallies, who in their turn distributed them with careful interpretations.\r\nThe consequences, judged from the point of view of those who were trying\r\nto maintain central authority intact, were curious. The assistant of the\r\nChief of Police (I take an ordinary example) distributes the\r\nproclamation without informing his chief. Or, for instance, the head of\r\nthe first police station would be confided in, but not the head of the\r\nsecond. Special sums of money came into the possession of some of the\r\nsubordinates of the Gendarmerie; certain obscure persons began to visit\r\nthem; rumours circulated in the town of certain preparations; frightened\r\npeople sought the Governor. The Governor reassured them, feeling,\r\nhowever, that the situation was far from reassuring. From the Ministry\r\ncame telegrams about measures to be taken, and measures were often\r\ntaken, but measures taken in this sense were far from inspiring\r\nuniversal confidence.\r\n\r\n“It happened that members of the police supposed in all good faith that\r\nsuch measures were taken for show, for decency’s sake; but that they\r\nknew the real object of the Government, they read between the lines, and\r\nabove the orders of the Governor they heard a voice from afar in which\r\nthey placed greater faith. In a word the result was incredible\r\nconfusion, utter disorganisation, and the complete demoralisation of\r\nauthority. In the meantime in St. Petersburg, so far back as the autumn\r\nof 1905 (and it appears up to the time when the October Ministry took\r\noffice), in No. 16, Fontanka, in an out-of-the-way room of the\r\nDepartment of Police, a printing-press was at work, bought at the\r\nexpense of the Department. An officer of the gendarmerie in mufti,\r\nKomissaroff, worked the press, and with the help of a few assistants\r\nprepared the proclamation. The secret of the existence of this\r\nprinting-press was so well kept, and the doings of its manager were so\r\ncleverly concealed, that not only in the Ministry but even in the\r\nDepartment of the Police, there were few people who knew of its\r\nexistence. In the meantime the work of the organisation, of which the\r\npress was the instrument, was evidently successful; since Komissaroff,\r\nin answer to some one who stumbled on it by chance and asked him a\r\nquestion about the work, said: ‘We can arrange any massacre you like; a\r\nmassacre of ten or a massacre of ten thousand.’ Sir, this phrase is\r\nhistorical (Sensation.) I can add that in Kiev a massacre of ten\r\nthousand had been arranged to take place on February 3rd, but it was\r\nsuccessfully averted. (Great sensation.)\r\n\r\n“The Prime Minister (Count Witte) had, it is said, a serious fit of\r\nnervous asthma when these facts were communicated to him. He sent for\r\nKomissaroff, who reported as to his actions and the authority which had\r\nbeen given him, and in a few hours neither printing-press nor\r\nproclamations were to be found in the Department, and that is why\r\nnobody, not even the Minister of the Interior, will be able to satisfy\r\nthe wish of the Duma to learn the names of the men who created the\r\norganisation, assured its members of immunity, acted like magic on the\r\npolice and other officials, and even managed to obtain promotion and\r\nreward for the most active among them. I will now proceed to my\r\nconclusions. My first is this: That the declaration of the Minister of\r\nthe Interior affords us no serious guarantee with regard to the\r\ncessation of organisations which take part in the preparation of huge\r\nmassacres and draw Government officials into their sphere of action. It\r\nis clear that the chief organisers and inspirers are outside the sphere\r\nof the Government, and as far as their business is concerned it is\r\nequally indifferent to them whether the Minister of the Interior will\r\nobserve a benevolent neutrality towards them or take a line of\r\nopposition. Further, I affirm that no Ministry, even if it were chosen\r\nfrom the Duma, could restore order in the country so long as certain\r\nunknown persons who stand outside, behind an impassable barrier,\r\ncontinue to lay their brutal fingers on certain parts of the machine of\r\nState, disturbing its political balance with experiments on living\r\norganisations, and performing a kind of political vivisection. My second\r\nconclusion is still more melancholy—it concerns the Duma.\r\n\r\n“Sirs, from all parts of Russia we have come hither not only with\r\ncomplaints and indignation, but with a keen thirst for action, for\r\nself-sacrifice and truth, with true patriotism. There are many among us\r\nhere whose income depends on their property, and have we heard from them\r\none word against compulsory expropriation of the land in the interests\r\nof the working man? And is it not this very ‘revolutionary Duma’ which\r\nfrom the first day of its activity up to the last few days has attempted\r\nto raise the authority of the Crown, to place it above party strife and\r\nabove our errors, and to preserve it from the responsibility for those\r\nerrors? What sort of a Duma is necessary now that the hour of inevitable\r\nreform has struck, if not such a one in which party interests and the\r\nclass-division have given way to the triumph of the union of the welfare\r\nof the people and the welfare of the State? Nevertheless, we feel that\r\nthose dark forces are arming against us, and dividing us from the Crown,\r\nand are preventing the Crown from having confidence in us. They will not\r\nallow us to accomplish that union with the Crown which, according to the\r\nlaw granting us a new order of things, is the indispensable condition\r\nand the only pledge of the peaceful development of the life of our\r\ncountry. Herein lies a great danger, and this danger will not disappear\r\nso long as in the direction of affairs and in the fortunes of our\r\ncountry we continue to feel the influence of men who have the education\r\nof policemen and sergeants, and are massacre-mongers on principle.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n                  NAZARENKO AND OTHER PEASANT MEMBERS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             ST. PETERSBURG, _July 6th_.\r\n\r\nAfter a week’s absence in England I returned to St. Petersburg to find\r\nthe situation much as I had left it, except that the tension has perhaps\r\nimperceptibly grown greater. The main factors of the situation are\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nRumours are current that a change of Ministry is probable, but it is\r\ngenerally considered that the appointment of a Ministry chosen from the\r\nMinistry itself is out of the question. One fact should be borne in mind\r\nin considering the rumours with regard to the latest phase of Court\r\nopinion and Government policy, namely, that there is probably no fixed\r\npolicy in those spheres; up to the present no such policy has been\r\nperceptible, and what has been done one day has been countermanded and\r\ncontradicted the next. Therefore, as far as the Government and the Court\r\nare concerned, all things are possible. One might apply to them a phrase\r\nused by a French historian with regard to Louis XVI.: “Il n’eut que des\r\nvelléités, des répugnances. Il céda tour à tour, sans plan, sans dessein\r\nquelconque, aux influences qui l’entouraient, à l’influence de la reine,\r\ndu Comte d’Artois, de Necker ... il vécut au jour le jour, disant oui,\r\ndisant non, selon que le conseiller du moment était plus importun et\r\nplus pressant.” This is an exact definition of the policy manifested by\r\nthe Russian Government and Court combined during the last two years.\r\n\r\nAs far as the Duma is concerned, there is the same deadlock which has\r\nexisted ever since it met; the Duma insisting on the creation of\r\nresponsible Ministers, the Ministers admitting the existence of the Duma\r\nin theory and denying it in practice. The tension of feeling in the Duma\r\nitself is greater than when I left, although the debates of the last\r\nthree days have been fairly quiet. But it is a significant if not an\r\nominous fact that the Constitutional Democrats are now attacked by men\r\nwho have hitherto supported them on account of the mildness of their\r\ntactics.\r\n\r\nA week spent in England enabled me to realise to a certain extent what\r\nis the English opinion with regard to Russian affairs. After one has\r\nbeen in Russia for some time certain things become so familiar that one\r\ntakes for granted that they are too well known to mention. If one then\r\nvisits England one realizes that there is a great gulf of ignorance\r\nbetween England and the elementary facts of the situation in Russia. I\r\nthink the principal thing which struck me in what I heard Englishmen say\r\nabout the Duma was that no sort of distinction was made among the\r\nelements of which it is composed. It is generally supposed to be a body\r\nexclusively consisting of violent Socialists. This is not the case;\r\nalthough, owing to the abnormal situation created by the Duma being face\r\nto face with a Ministry which does not seriously admit its existence, it\r\nwill at any moment be ready to show a unanimous front of opposition\r\ntowards the Government. The second thing which struck me was that people\r\nin England judge affairs in Russia according to an English standard.\r\nThey forget that the conditions are different. The Russian Government,\r\nin some of its unofficial utterances in the English Press, reminds us of\r\nthis fact when it wishes to lay stress on the opinion that the Duma is\r\nnot a Parliament, and must not be considered as such. Their argument\r\ncuts both ways, and it might be applied to the Russian Government,\r\ncomparing it with the Governments of other countries, but I would rather\r\napply this reasoning to the demands of the Duma. The Government says\r\nthese demands are impossible, and public opinion in England is apt to\r\nre-echo this sentiment, feeling that this standpoint is a safe and sound\r\none. I am not going into the question in detail; only I wish to point\r\nout a few facts which perhaps make these demands seem less extravagant\r\nthan they appear to be at first sight.\r\n\r\nLet us take first the abolition of capital punishment. People say: “They\r\nare asking for the abolition of capital punishment in Russia, whereas in\r\nan enlightened country like ours we hang women. It is absurd.” Now,\r\ncapital punishment, except for regicides, was abolished in Russia by the\r\nEmpress Elizabeth in 1753; and it has only been applied lately in virtue\r\nof martial law. If you committed an ordinary murder in Russia you were\r\nput in prison for a certain number of years, often not for a very long\r\nperiod. Ordinary murders did not increase in consequence, and the\r\nRussians were satisfied with this detail of their legislation. Now,\r\nsince the revolutionary movement began last year, and more especially\r\nsince the prevalence of martial law in many districts, what has happened\r\nis this: that whereas capital punishment was still in abeyance in\r\nrespect to ordinary criminals, it obtained as far as political offenders\r\nwere concerned. It is objected, of course, that people who throw bombs\r\nmust expect to be killed and that the murder of innocent policemen is\r\nwholly unjustifiable. But the other side rejoins as follows: “What is\r\nterrorism but the inevitable result of the continued lawlessness of the\r\nlocal authorities representing the Government?” While admitting to the\r\nfull that it is deplorable, how can one expect it to diminish as long as\r\nthe Government continues to condone guilty officials, or only punishes\r\nthem in a ludicrously inadequate manner? It is here that the\r\nGovernment’s case breaks down. A man who kills a policeman is, if he is\r\ncaught, at least certain of punishment, but if a police officer walks\r\ninto a house and kills, as Ermolov did in Moscow, an utterly inoffensive\r\ndoctor, he is certain to be let off (Ermolov was sentenced to\r\ndeprivation of military rank and a short term of imprisonment). That is\r\nwhat the Liberals complain of, pointing at the same time to utterly\r\nindiscriminate executions carried out under martial law by generals in\r\nMoscow, in the Baltic provinces, and in Siberia. I cannot say that I\r\nthink their position is wildly unreasonable. The Government’s argument\r\nis exceedingly specious, and it is the easiest thing in the world to\r\nconvince any Englishman of its soundness, only it omits half the truth\r\nand the whole cause of the agitation.\r\n\r\nThe same thing can be said about the demand for amnesty. People in\r\nEngland think that the Duma is clamouring exclusively for the release of\r\nmurderers. The fact is that, as I have said before, the proportion of\r\nmurderers in prison is small. The bomb-throwers nearly always escape or\r\nare killed, whereas the prisons are packed with people who are there by\r\nchance and against whom there is not even any accusation.\r\n\r\nAgain, take the land question: the demands on the Duma seem far less\r\nexaggerated to a Russian Conservative than they do to an English Whig.\r\nThe Russian Conservative may, and probably does, disagree with them, but\r\nhe does not consider them childishly outrageous. The Duma contains some\r\nhighly-respected and important landlords, who have all voted in favour\r\nof the principle of compulsory expropriation, and I think they know more\r\nabout the land question in Russia even than the most sensible\r\nEnglishman.\r\n\r\n                                                   _July 6th_ (_Later_).\r\n\r\nTo-day in the Duma there was a barefooted man in rags, who said he had\r\narrived in St. Petersburg chiefly owing to the kindness of the railway\r\nguards. His house had been burnt, owing to some squabble with the police\r\nauthorities. Another correspondent and I had some talk with him. He\r\nthought we were deputies. He said: “Stand up for our rights and I will\r\ngo back and tell them you are doing so.”\r\n\r\n                                                             _July 6th._\r\n\r\nThe question of the Inter-Parliamentary Congress to be held in London is\r\narousing interest here. It is not yet decided what delegates are to go.\r\nProfessor Kovolievski introduced me to one of the peasant members of the\r\nDuma—Nazarenko, the deputy for Kharhov—who wished to speak to me about\r\nit. Nazarenko is far the most remarkable of the peasant deputies. He is\r\na tall, striking figure, with black hair, a pale face with prominent\r\nclearly-cut features, such as Velasquez would have taken to paint a\r\nmilitant apostle. He went through the course of primary education, and\r\nby subsequently educating himself he has attained to an unwonted degree\r\nof culture. Besides this he is a born speaker and a most original\r\ncharacter. “I want to go to London,” he said, “so that the English may\r\nsee a real peasant and not a sham one, and so that I can tell the\r\nEnglish what we, the real people, think and feel about them.” I said I\r\nwas glad he was going. “I shan’t go unless I am chosen by the others,”\r\nhe answered. “I have written my name down and asked, but I shan’t ask\r\ntwice. I never ask twice for anything. When I say my prayers I only ask\r\nGod once for a thing, and if it is not granted I never ask again. So\r\nit’s not likely I would ask my fellow-men twice for anything. I am like\r\nthat; I leave out that passage in the prayers about being a miserable\r\nslave. I am not a miserable slave, neither of man nor of heaven.” “That\r\nis what the Church calls spiritual pride,” I answered. “I don’t believe\r\nin all that,” he answered. “My religion is the same as that of Tolstoi.”\r\nHe then pointed to the ikon which is in the lobby of the Duma. “I pay no\r\nattention to that,” he said, “It is a board covered with gilt, but a lot\r\nof people think that the ikon is God.”\r\n\r\nI asked him if he liked Tolstoi’s books. “Yes,” he answered. “His books\r\nare great, but his philosophy is weak. It may be all right for mankind\r\nthousands of years hence, but it is no use now. I have no friends,” he\r\ncontinued. “Books are my friends. But lately my house was burnt, and all\r\nmy books with it. I have read a lot, but I never had anybody to tell me\r\nwhat to read, so I read without any system. I did not go to school till\r\nI was thirteen.”\r\n\r\n“Do you like Dostoievski’s books?” “Yes; he knows all about the human\r\nsoul. When I see a man going down hill I know exactly how it will happen\r\nand what he is going through, and I could stop him because I have read\r\nDostoievski.” “Have you read translations of any foreign books?” “Very\r\nfew; some of Zola’s books, but I don’t like them because he does not\r\nreally know the life he is describing. Some of Guy de Maupassant’s\r\nstories I have read, but I do not like them either, because I don’t want\r\nto know more about that sort of people than I know already.” “Have you\r\nread Shakespeare?” “Yes. There is nobody like him. When you read a\r\nconversation of Shakespeare’s, when one person is speaking you think he\r\nis right, and when the next person answers him you think he is right. He\r\nunderstands everybody. But I want to read Spencer—Herbert Spencer. I\r\nhave never been able to get his works.” I promised to procure him\r\nHerbert Spencer’s works.\r\n\r\nI hope he will go to London, for he is a strangely picturesque figure\r\nand an original character, this dark-eyed Velasquez-like Nazarenko,\r\nproud as Lucifer and full of ideals, a kind of mixture of Shelley and\r\nCato.\r\n\r\n                                                             _July 7th._\r\n\r\nThis afternoon I went to have tea with two of the peasant deputies. They\r\nhad asked me because it was the Name-day of one of them. They are living\r\nin a new hotel and are most comfortably lodged. They pay a rouble a day\r\nfor a room. Their rooms are far more comfortable and much cleaner than\r\nmine. We had beer, vodka, cucumbers, sardines and cold sausage, and we\r\ndiscussed very many subjects. During the afternoon many other members\r\ndropped in, and among them a member of the “Council of Empire.” These\r\npeasants, who come from an exceedingly distant government, belong to the\r\nmore educated category. I believe the education in their particular\r\ngovernment is good owing to the energy the Zemstva have displayed there.\r\nThere are three of these peasants: one of them is a sensible man who\r\ndoes not know much about things outside Russia; but one of the others is\r\nquite well acquainted with the main features of European politics and\r\ntalks of Jaurés, Chamberlain, and Lord Rosebery. “Who would have thought\r\ntwo years ago,” said one of them, “that we should see an Englishman here\r\nin the flesh?”\r\n\r\n                                                             _July 8th._\r\n\r\nThis evening I went to see an electro-technician, whom I know. We went\r\nfor a walk on the islands. The technician’s brother, who had been a\r\nsailor, was with us. The electro-technician had been in Belgium and\r\nLondon. Then we went to the “Norodniu Dom,” the “People’s Palace,” a\r\nplace where there is a popular theatre, a garden, and a restaurant.\r\nBefore we went in here, the technician’s brother said he must have some\r\nvodka. So we went into a wine shop and he drank a large tumbler of vodka\r\nstraight off. “This is the eighth glass I have had to-day,” he said. “It\r\nis only habit. I don’t feel any effects from it; but if I were to drink\r\na glass of wine now I should be drunk.” We went into the “People’s\r\nPalace” and sat in the garden. Some other friends joined us. We ordered\r\nbeer, and the technician’s brother was unwise enough to drink some. The\r\ntechnician described life in Paris and London. Paris he detested. He\r\nspoke French rather well. He said it was a boring city. I said, “Don’t\r\nyou like the French theatres? You must admit they act well.” He said:\r\n“Their plays are so totally different from ours that I cannot bear them.\r\nThey are always artificial and never the least like life. Our plays are\r\nlike life.” Talking of London, he said when he arrived there he realised\r\nthat the Continent was one thing and England a totally different thing.\r\nHe said he could not understand thousands of poor people paying a\r\nshilling to see a football match. He had lived in an English family. He\r\nadmired the neatness and the cleanliness of everything. He thought the\r\nhospitality of the English was great. He said the point of view of moral\r\nsuperiority was extraordinary. The way an Englishwoman he had known had\r\nspoken of Indians and Chinese as something so infinitely inferior, too,\r\nhad surprised and amused him. The sailor brother put in a few remarks\r\nand was contradicted. The glass of beer which had followed the eighth\r\ntumbler of vodka now took its effect, and he said that a man present had\r\nmorally spat three times in his face, and that he was not going to stand\r\nit any longer. His brother said that if he was not quiet he would go. He\r\nrefused to be quieted, and so the company broke up.\r\n\r\n                                                             _July 9th._\r\n\r\nTo-day I went to the Duma with a translation of Herbert Spencer for\r\nNazarenko. I also took him a translation of Shelley’s poems and a\r\ntranslation of “Œdipus Rex.” “There,” I said, “are the poems of a man\r\ncalled Shelley.” “You mean,” he answered, “the man who was drowned.” He\r\ntook up the “Œdipus Rex,” and read three verses out of it. “Modern\r\npoetry depends for its beauty on its outward form,” he said. “It is all\r\nwords; but if you read two lines of ancient poetry like this you see\r\nthat it contains a whole philosophy.”\r\n\r\n                                                            _July 11th._\r\n\r\nI went to see Nazarenko in his house. He was not at home, but a friend\r\nof his was there. He told me to wait. He was a peasant thirty-nine years\r\nold, rather bald, with a nice intelligent face. At first he took no\r\nnotice of me, and read aloud to himself out of a book. Then he suddenly\r\nturned to me and asked me who I was. I said I was an English\r\ncorrespondent. He got up, shut the door, and begged me to stay. “Do the\r\nEnglish know the condition of the Russian peasantry?” he asked. “They\r\nthink we are wolves and bears. Do I look like a wolf? Please say I am\r\nnot a wolf.” Then he ordered some tea and got a bottle of beer. He asked\r\nme to tell him how labourers lived in England, what their houses were\r\nmade of, what the floors and walls were made of, how much wages a\r\nlabourer received, what was the price of meat, whether they ate meat?\r\nThen he suddenly, to my intense astonishment, put the following question\r\nto me: “In England do they think that Jesus Christ was a God or only a\r\ngreat man?” I asked him what he thought. He said he thought He was a\r\ngreat man. He said that the Russian people were very religious and\r\nsuperstitious; they were deceived by the priests, who threatened them\r\nwith damnation. He asked me if I could lend him an English bible. He\r\nwanted to see if it was the same as a Russian bible. I said it was\r\nexactly the same. He was immensely astonished. “Do you mean to say,” he\r\nasked, “that there are all those stories about Jonah and the whale and\r\nJoshua and the moon?” I said “Yes.” “I thought,” he said, “those had\r\nbeen put in for us.” I tried to explain to him that we were taught\r\nalmost exactly the same doctrines, the differences between the Anglican\r\nand the Orthodox Church on points of dogma being infinitesimal. We then\r\ntalked of ghosts. He asked me if I believed in ghosts. I said I did; he\r\nasked why. I gave various reasons. He said he could believe in a kind of\r\ntelepathy, a kind of moral wireless telegraphy; but ghosts were the\r\ninvention of old women. He suddenly asked me whether the earth was four\r\nthousand years old. “Of course it’s older,” he said. “But that’s what we\r\nare taught. We are taught nothing about geography and geology. It is, of\r\ncourse, a fact that there is no such thing as God,” he said; “because,\r\nif there is a God He must be a just God; and as there is so much\r\ninjustice in the world it is plain that a just God does not exist.” I\r\nsaid I could conceive there being an unjust God. Such an idea was\r\ninconceivable, he said. “But you,” he went on, “an Englishman who has\r\nnever been deceived by officials, do you believe that God exists?” (He\r\nthought that all ideas of religion and God as taught to the Russian\r\npeople were part of a great official lie.) “I do,” I said. “Why?” he\r\nasked. I asked him if he had read the book of Job. He said he had. I\r\nsaid that when Job has everything taken away from him, although he has\r\ndone no wrong, suddenly in the very depth of his misery he recognises\r\nthe existence of God in the immensity of nature, and feels that his own\r\nsoul is a part of a plan too vast for him to conceive or to comprehend;\r\nin feeling that he is a part of the scheme he acknowledges the existence\r\nof God, and that is enough; he is able to consent, and to console\r\nhimself, although in dust and ashes. That was, I said, what I thought\r\none could feel. He admitted the point of view, but he did not share it.\r\nAfter we had had tea we went for a walk in some gardens not far off,\r\nwhere there were various theatrical performances going on. The audience\r\namused me, it applauded so rapturously and insisted on an encore,\r\nwhatever was played, and however it was played, with such thunderous\r\ninsistence. “Priests,” said my friend, “base everything on the devil.\r\nThere is no devil. There was no fall of man. There are no ghosts, no\r\nspirits, but there are millions and millions of other inhabited worlds.”\r\n\r\nI left him late, when the performance was over. This man, who was a\r\nmember of the Duma for the government of Jula, was called Petruckin. I\r\nlooked up his name in the list of members and found he had been educated\r\nin the local church school of the village of Kologrivo; that he had\r\nspent the whole of his life in this village and had been engaged in\r\nagriculture. That among the peasants he enjoyed great popularity as\r\nbeing a clever and hard-working man. He belonged to no party. He was not\r\nin the least like the men of peasant origin who had assimilated European\r\nculture. He was naturally sensible and alert of mind.\r\n\r\n                                                            _July 12th._\r\n\r\nThe Bill which the Duma passed last week abolishing capital punishment\r\nwas discussed in the Upper House the day before yesterday and referred\r\nto a Committee. As the treatment of this matter has excited no little\r\nbewilderment abroad, it will, perhaps, not be useless to go further into\r\nthe history of capital punishment in Russia, which I have mentioned in a\r\nprevious letter. Capital punishment was abolished in Russia by the\r\nEmpress Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter the Great, in 1753. But as long\r\nas the knout was in use it was rather the name of the thing than the\r\nthing itself which was abolished, because a hundred lashes of the knout\r\nmeant death. During the last years in which the knout was employed the\r\nnumber of lashes was limited to thirty-five. Its use was abolished by\r\nthe Emperor Nicholas in the first year of his reign (1825). Beating with\r\na birch was abolished by the Emperor Alexander II. in 1863, except for\r\npeasants; the beating of peasants was abolished in 1904. “Depuis lors,”\r\nwrites M. Leroy-Beaulieu in his standard book on Russia, “la législation\r\nRusse est probablement la plus douce de l’Europe.... La peine capitale a\r\ndepuis lors été réellement supprimée; à l’inverse de ce qui se voit en\r\nbeaucoup d’autres pays, elle n’existe plus que pour les crimes\r\npolitiques, pour les attentats contre la vie du Souverain ou la sûreté\r\nde l’État.” During almost the whole reign of Alexander II, from 1855 to\r\n1876, only one man was executed on the scaffold, namely Karakosof, the\r\nperpetrator of the first attempt made on the Emperor’s life. From 1866\r\nto 1903 only 114 men suffered the penalty of death throughout the whole\r\nof the Russian Empire.\r\n\r\nCommenting on these statistics in the Council of Empire, M. Tagantzef\r\npointed out that, in contradistinction to this, during 1906 up to the\r\nmonth of June, that is, during five months, 108 people have been\r\ncondemned to death under martial law, and ninety have been executed, not\r\ncounting people who have been killed without a trial. The cause,\r\ntherefore, of the present agitation is the fact that capital punishment\r\nexists in Russia for political crimes only by virtue of martial law. M.\r\nLeroy-Beaulieu, in commenting on the first instances of this turn of\r\naffairs, which occurred in 1878, when a political agitator was executed\r\nin Odessa, remarks that a modern State which abolishes capital\r\npunishment should abolish it altogether, “pour ne point se donner le\r\ndémenti d’une contradiction rendue parfois d’autant plus choquante pour\r\nla conscience publique qu’il lui répugne de voir, comme en Russie, le\r\nrégicide ou le simple conspirateur politique traité plus sévèrement que\r\nle parricide.”\r\n\r\nFor and against the entire abolition of capital punishment the chief\r\narguments of each side are at present these: Those who wish capital\r\npunishment to be retained point to the number of political murders which\r\nhave occurred during the last year, and especially to the long list of\r\ninnocent policemen who have been murdered, and maintain that if capital\r\npunishment is abolished these crimes will increase. Those who wish it to\r\nbe abolished say that the existence of capital punishment, so far from\r\nexercising a restraining influence on political criminals, excites\r\npeople to murder and makes martyrs of them. Moreover, they point out\r\nthat when people expatiate on the terrible list of political\r\nassassinations they altogether overlook their cause. They are not in all\r\ncases the result of irresponsible hysteria. The defenders of the\r\nGovernment say: “You make martyrs of people who are merely common\r\nmurderers;” the opponents answer: “The Government shuts its eyes to the\r\nlawless and criminal acts of its officials, and the people are obliged\r\nto take the law into their own hands.” This is the present state of the\r\nquestion, and I have endeavoured to present both sides of it. Quite\r\napart from the political murders of the last two years, it is\r\ninteresting to note that, as far as we can tell, the abolition of\r\ncapital punishment in Russia has not had the effect of increasing crime.\r\nIn 1890 the proportion of homicides was seven to the million in Russia\r\n(7·4), almost exactly the same as the proportion in the British Isles\r\nduring that year, which was (7·5).\r\n\r\n                                              _July 12th_ (_continued_).\r\n\r\nThis morning I went to see Nazarenko, who had made an appointment with\r\nme. My friend Petruckin was there also. We discussed the question of the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Conference. He said he meant to go to London. “They\r\nare so absorbed here in party politics,” he said, “that they forget that\r\nthese things are larger and more important, because they concern Russia\r\nas a great power. The members of the Duma do not want to go with the\r\nmembers of the Council of Empire. But I tell them it is like this. If I\r\nsee a wounded man on the ground and go to help him, and a man whom I\r\ndislike comes to help him also, I don’t stop helping the wounded man\r\nbecause the man I dislike is helping; that would be absurd.”\r\n\r\nHe said he had read some of the Shelley I had given him. Shelley was a\r\nreal poet. Russian poets wrote about nothing except love; but in Shelley\r\nthere was a different spirit. “I have read Byron, too, a long time ago;\r\nbut he is too pessimistic, and is always harping on one theme—himself.”\r\nI asked him if he had ever read “Paradise Lost.” “Yes,” he answered, “I\r\nread it when I was thirteen; it was one of the first books I ever read.\r\nThere is glorious fantasy!”\r\n\r\nTo-day was a holiday and, talking of this, Nazarenko said that the\r\nquantity of holidays in Russia proved that the Russians were an inferior\r\nrace. “My holidays are those days when there is no work for me to do,\r\njust as my fast days are those on which I am not hungry.” Nazarenko, in\r\nthe course of conversation, said something about religion, and Petruckin\r\nbroke in, and said: “Take care! Mavriki Edouardovitch (that was I) is a\r\nfull believer.”\r\n\r\n                                                            _July 13th._\r\n\r\nTo-day there are rumours of a new Ministry to be formed from the\r\nmajority of the Duma.\r\n\r\n                                                            _July 16th._\r\n\r\nI went to see Petruckin this evening. We had a long conversation about\r\nthe land question. He explained to me that the Labour Party’s views as\r\nto the land question were silly. He said that he inclined towards the\r\nviews of the Cadets.\r\n\r\n                                                            _July 18th._\r\n\r\nThings are going badly in the Duma, and there is likely to be a split\r\namong the Cadets on the subject of a proposed Manifesto to the people, a\r\ncounterblast to the Ministerial Declaration.\r\n\r\n                                                            _July 19th._\r\n\r\nDuring the last week not only were rumours circulating to the effect\r\nthat the resignation of the Ministry had been accepted, but certain\r\nmembers of the Right positively affirmed that a new Cabinet taken from\r\nthe Duma had been formed. It is said now that this task was offered to\r\nM. Shipov, who is the most important representative of the Moderate\r\nparties outside the Duma, and that he refused it. Now, since yesterday\r\nfresh rumours, which have had a bad effect on the Bourse, are afloat to\r\nthe effect that all idea of forming a Ministry from the Duma itself has\r\nbeen abandoned, and that the Government is contemplating the dissolution\r\nof the Duma and the appointment of a military dictatorship. Whether\r\nthere is serious foundation for these rumours I do not know, but it is\r\nobvious that there are only four courses open to the Government:\r\n\r\n1. To form a Coalition Ministry under some Liberal leader outside the\r\nDuma.\r\n\r\n2. To form a Ministry from the majority of the Duma.\r\n\r\n3. To dissolve the Duma.\r\n\r\n4. To do nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Government is said to have tried the first course and to have\r\nfailed. The second course it appears to regard as being out of the\r\nquestion. The third course is said to be under consideration now. The\r\nfourth course answers to the Government’s policy up to the present.\r\n\r\nI have talked with several Conservatives lately—not Moderate Liberals,\r\nbut Conservatives of the old _régime_—and their indignation against the\r\nGovernment was extreme. One of them said that the formation of a\r\nMinistry from the majority of the Duma, namely, the Cadets, with whom he\r\nhad no sympathy, was the only chance of saving the situation; that he\r\ncould understand the policy of dissolution; but the Government did\r\nneither the one nor the other, and the people who were paying for this\r\nmistake were the landlords with the destruction and devastation of their\r\nproperty. Another said to me that there were at present two great\r\ndangerous elements in Russia—the revolutionaries and the Government—and\r\nthat of the two the Government was the more dangerous. A third, a large\r\nlanded proprietor, said that he preferred to be despoiled by\r\nexpropriation rather than to have all his estates devastated and his\r\nhouses burnt. A Government taken from the majority of the Duma, he\r\nadded, was the only solution, but it should have been done two months\r\nago; now it was too late. I mentioned the dissolution of the Duma and\r\nthe possibility of a dictatorship. “You would want five hundred\r\ndictators, not one,” he answered, “and what is the use of a dictatorship\r\nwhen the whole country is on fire? The action of the Government has been\r\nlike this: it is as if some people had set a town on fire, locked up the\r\nfire engines, and then talked of putting a dictator at the head of the\r\nfire brigade.”\r\n\r\nIn opposition to this I have heard views expressed which perhaps reflect\r\nthose of the Government. One man said to me that it was now obvious that\r\nthe Duma, instead of having a pacifying influence, was merely a cause of\r\ndisorder; that when it was originally convened he had believed in its\r\npacifying capacities; but now he was convinced of the contrary, and the\r\nsooner it was dissolved the better. It may be objected that, though it\r\nis after all true that the convening of the Duma did not pacify the\r\ncountry, it is necessary to reflect under what conditions it was\r\nconvened: its hands were tied; the fundamental laws were altered for\r\nthis purpose; the Government not only went on governing as before, but\r\nactually took active measures to discredit its new Parliament at home\r\nand abroad. When a Duma was asked for, the thing meant was Responsible\r\nGovernment. It is over this question of responsibility that the whole\r\nstruggle is being carried on.\r\n\r\nI have also heard the following argument, which is advanced by the\r\nnewspaper _Rossia_, a semi-official organ, this morning: “What do we\r\nlose by deciding on repressive measures? Even if we fail by giving in\r\nnow we should be failing; therefore we are exchanging certain failure\r\nfor problematic failure; it is better to give in after a fight than to\r\nsurrender without a struggle, and our chances, now that we are certain\r\nof at least one part of the Army, are better than they will be a year\r\nhence, when we shall be certain of nothing. We are told that we cannot\r\ndissolve the Duma without provoking a revolution, but, from our point of\r\nview, to give in to the Duma now is equivalent to sanctioning a\r\nrevolution. Let us try and prove that we can dissolve the Duma, and that\r\nthey are merely trying to bluff with their threats of revolution.” The\r\nlogical result of this policy should be civil war.[3]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  And it has proved to be civil war; but civil war waged in everyday\r\n  life and unaccompanied by an armed rising.\r\n\r\nAll the revolutionary elements in the country would be strengthened by a\r\ndissolution, and one can safely predict that the general disorder would\r\nbe increased. For even now the sporadic anarchy is increasing daily.\r\nWill the dissolution of the Duma relieve this tension? I think not. The\r\nquestion then suggests itself: Is there no hope of a peaceful issue?\r\n\r\nA Ministry formed from the majority of the Duma is the only hope; but\r\nwhether it would manage to calm matters is another question. It is true\r\nthat there is a moderate element, especially among the peasants, who\r\nwish to meet the landlords halfway, who consider the demands of the\r\nExtreme Left, and especially their agrarian programme, to be absurd.\r\nThese men would support a Ministry taken from the Duma, but they\r\ncontinually assert that the Government will not meet them half way, and\r\nthat, on the other hand, they consider the schemes which the Government\r\nhave put forward to be fundamentally insufficient. Whether a Ministry\r\ncomposed of members taken from the majority of the Duma would succeed in\r\ncalming the country depends on the nature and intensity of the\r\nopposition they would have to encounter, which it is impossible to gauge\r\nat present. One thing is certain, that in the event of such a Ministry\r\nbeing given a free hand sympathy would cease to be extended to the\r\nthrowers of bombs, whose task is now greatly facilitated by the simple\r\nfact that popular opinion is with them.\r\n\r\nWhen people, on the other hand, say that the Cadets have no men with\r\nwhom to form a Ministry—and, to be fair, I have only heard this argument\r\nadvanced either in England or by some Russian officials here—I have\r\nheard it contradicted by intelligent Russian officials—they are talking\r\negregious nonsense. People like Professor Miliukov, MM. Nabokor,\r\nKokoskin, Muromtzeff, and Petradjinski have shown themselves not only to\r\nbe men with brains but to possess political capacity and tactical\r\nability of no mean order. Even if they were twenty times less capable\r\nthan they are they would be more capable of governing the country than\r\nthe present Ministry. But unfortunately it does not seem probable that\r\nthey will ever win the confidence of the Crown, since most of them in\r\nthe past have suffered for their political principles, and some of them\r\nhave been in prison. Therefore, whereas if they had been born in France\r\nor England they would by now be occupying exalted positions, they are\r\nnow looked upon from above as men of the same category as Anarchists and\r\nthrowers of vitriol. If Mr. Balfour had been born in Russia he would\r\ncertainly have been requested to confine his energies to golf and\r\nmetaphysics, but if Mr. Haldane had been born here he would have\r\nprobably been sent to think about the path to reality in the paths of\r\nTransbaikalia. Therefore at the root of the whole matter there is a\r\ngreat misunderstanding between the Crown and the Duma. It is based on\r\nthe supposition that the Duma is not representative, and that the\r\nrevolution is an artificial thing.\r\n\r\n                                                            _July 20th._\r\n\r\nTo-day there are ominous rumours of dissolution in the air. Nazarenko is\r\nnot going to London. He said he thought Professor Kovolievski was not\r\ngoing, so he had withdrawn his candidature. Now it turned out that\r\nProfessor Kovolievski was going he was sorry. He said he respected\r\nMaxime Maximovitch Kovolievski to such an extent that if he were to tell\r\nhim to hang himself on a tree he would do so.\r\n\r\n                                                            _July 21st._\r\n\r\nEvery one is talking of the rumours of dissolution.\r\n\r\n                                                            _July 22nd._\r\n\r\nI went to see some of the peasant members in their hotel. They expect\r\nthat the Duma will be dissolved.\r\n\r\n                                                            _July 23rd._\r\n\r\nIn this morning’s _Retch_ there was a short paragraph stating that late\r\nin the night a rumour had reached them concerning the dissolution of the\r\nDuma; but it was not true. It was, however, or rather it is. The\r\ndissolution is a fact. I have just seen the official announcement in a\r\nspecial edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n                      THE DISSOLUTION OF THE DUMA\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            ST. PETERSBURG, _July 25th_.\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of the Duma, although it had been predicted during the\r\ncourse of last week, and although the arrival of a large number of\r\ntroops in St. Petersburg was known, came as a surprise. During the whole\r\nof yesterday the town was abnormally quiet. I went to the various clubs:\r\nthe Labour Party Club, the Cadet Club, the Socialist Club. They were all\r\ndeserted. Some of the members had left for Finland; others were holding\r\nmeetings in various parts of the town. In the club of the Labour Party,\r\nwhich is in the Nevsky Prospect, nothing was left except the cold\r\nremains of a supper, a large portrait of the Emperor, a picture of the\r\nDowager Empress, and a pastel of Spiridonovna. At the Cadet Club I saw\r\nthe peasant Nazarenko; he was just starting for Finland. “Things are\r\nbad,” I said. “The life of a State is like the life of a man,” he\r\nreplied, philosophically. “If there were no bad there would be no good,\r\neither.” Other visitors arrived and gathered together in knots, speaking\r\nwith bated breath, as if they were under the cloud of some huge\r\ncalamity. “Does it mean the end of the Monarchy?” I asked one man. “It\r\nmeans the end of the dynasty, in any case,” he answered.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I saw some Octobrists and Conservatives, and asked them\r\ntheir opinion. “The Government may be right in having dissolved the\r\nDuma,” one of them said, “but what is criminal on their part is the way\r\nin which they treated the Duma from the first, trying to discredit it in\r\nevery possible way, and doing everything they could to provoke it to\r\nrebellion. Russia is an odd country, and everything is possible; it is\r\npossible that the country may quiet down if liberal reforms are at once\r\nput into practice; but I confess I have little faith in this, and if the\r\ncountry does not quiet down this Ministry will be directly responsible\r\nfor any disasters which may happen.”\r\n\r\nSome one else, more Liberal, said to me: “If I lose everything I\r\npossess, if my land is devastated and my house is burnt, I shall never\r\nblame the Cadets; I shall never cease to believe they might have managed\r\nthings if they had been empowered to do so early enough—that is to say,\r\nlast October.”\r\n\r\nA third person, a landlord, said to me yesterday that the step was\r\ninevitable, because no Ministry, even were it composed of geniuses, and\r\nno Duma, even were it composed of angels, would be of the slightest\r\navail until it was settled whether or no there is to be a new _régime_\r\nin Russia. You cannot, he argued, have the new wine in the old skins. It\r\nwas no use having a Duma supposed to be working together with a power\r\ndirectly opposed to it and working in a diametrically opposite\r\ndirection. As matters were, a law, if it passed through the Duma and the\r\nCouncil of Empire, had to be sanctioned by the x quantity who had the\r\npower in his hands at Court. And if it is said that it is not\r\nconstitutional to inquire into the advisers of the Crown, it must be\r\nremembered that whenever in other countries advisers have been\r\nall-powerful, and have acted against the will of the people, the\r\nadvisers have been forced to go, failing which the Monarch has been\r\ndeposed. Now the question will be settled. Either the Government will\r\nprove it can govern the country and quiet it down—that is to say, it\r\nwill prove itself to be strong—or it will prove its weakness and\r\nultimately come to grief.\r\n\r\nAll these are opinions I have heard expressed by Russians during the\r\nlast two days. I have also heard it said that the dissolution of the\r\nDuma is an excellent step, that the Duma did no good and some harm. I\r\nhave also heard all the disaster attributed to the Cadets, some people\r\nsaying they were too constitutional, and that it is impossible to be\r\nconstitutional during a revolution, others that they did not succeed in\r\ndominating the Left parties, but allowed themselves to be overridden by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the new Prime Minister has announced his intention of\r\ncarrying out a great Liberal programme of far-reaching reforms on a\r\nlarge scale, and of maintaining the strictest order throughout the\r\ncountry, so that the reforms may be realised. This sounds charming. “At\r\nfirst, of course, you think it’s charming, but very soon it gets\r\nalarming.” The first step taken in the new direction has been to\r\nsuppress all the Moderate Liberal newspapers and to introduce a system\r\nof censorship more severe than that which prevailed during the worst\r\ntimes of Plehve, and to arrest a man who took off his hat to the members\r\nof the Duma at the railway station. To-day, however, the Cadet\r\nnewspaper, the _Retch_, has once more made its appearance. The\r\nGovernment are looking forward to the new elections, which they hope\r\nwill return a Conservative majority truly representative of the people.\r\n\r\nAmong other constitutional matters there is one lesson which they have\r\nnot learnt, and probably never will learn, and that is that if you have\r\na Parliamentary system you must put up with the fact that it will often\r\nreturn a majority which is distasteful to you. If the elections are\r\ncarried out fairly it can safely be predicted that the majority returned\r\nwill be ultra-Radical. But I suppose this time those steps will be taken\r\nwhich the present Ministry so bitterly accuse Count Witte of having\r\nomitted to take, the steps to “arrange” the elections, which, we are\r\ntold (several officials told me personally), the Government always take\r\nin England. That is to say, Mr. Balfour and Lord Lansdowne, it is\r\nthought, take the necessary steps to prevent the election of Mr. Keir\r\nHardie and his supporters. It is strange that so far this plan should\r\nhave proved unsuccessful. It would be, perhaps, simpler here to pass an\r\nelectoral law in virtue of which only policemen could be elected members\r\nof Parliament. This would prove a constitutional measure which the\r\npresent Ministry would thoroughly understand.\r\n\r\nOne sometimes hears it said that the Duma was in too great a hurry, and\r\nthat it should have waited patiently and obtained everything by\r\nconstitutional means. This was the course the majority were doing their\r\nbest to pursue. They had to reckon with a Government which was opposing\r\nthem by unconstitutional means. It is certainly not constitutional for a\r\nGovernment to distribute among the troops proclamations (I have seen\r\nthem) inciting the Army against the Parliament, and attacking members of\r\nParliament with every kind of gross insult and calumny. Nor is it\r\nconstitutional for a Minister to request the correspondent of a large\r\nforeign newspaper to state that the Parliament is not a thing to be\r\nreckoned with, but merely a revolutionary body. The answer people made\r\nto these objections is that there is not, and there never has been, a\r\nconstitution in Russia, and they are perfectly right.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from this, I agree with the Russian landlord I have quoted\r\nabove, who said that the main question must be decided before one can\r\ntalk of a Parliament here. The abscess must be pierced to the core, he\r\nsaid. It was a pleasing illusion to think the Cadets would obtain a\r\nchange of _régime_ by constitutional means. “You must wait, little\r\npigeon, you must wait,” says a character in a novel by a famous Russian\r\nsatirist. “I have done nothing else during my whole life,” is the reply.\r\nAnd if the Parliament had waited until the Government became\r\nconstitutional it could have waited until Doomsday, because, as another\r\nRussian said to me not long ago, “it has less idea of what\r\n_constitutional_ means than the Turks, only the Turks are more competent\r\nand are better governed.”\r\n\r\nOf course, if the new Prime Minister succeeds in quieting the country\r\nand carrying out Liberal reforms on a large scale every one will admit\r\nthat the Government was right from the first, and that the Duma was\r\nwrong. “But what use are reforms,” said some one to-day, “when the\r\nGovernment has decided not to give the initial reform which should be\r\nthe cause of all the others: namely, a change of _régime_, a\r\nconstitution and a system of responsible government?” Besides, in order\r\nto quiet the country the Government must first succeed in recovering the\r\nconfidence of the people. At present it has not got the confidence of\r\nany party, any group, or any section of the population.\r\n\r\nSt. Petersburg is full of troops. A cabman said to me yesterday that\r\nthese were not Russian troops, but _Austrians_ in disguise. This is a\r\ncurious reflection of the remarks on foreign intervention which were\r\npublished on the first page of the semi-official newspaper here last\r\nweek, without, of course, the knowledge of the Ministers. I asked the\r\nsame man what he expected would happen. “There will be a big _skandal_,”\r\nhe answered. “It is impossible that it should be otherwise. They say:\r\n‘Let us have a Duma,’ and then they say, ‘Let us send it away’; there\r\ncan only be disorders after that. We, the cabmen, have never yet struck,\r\nbut we shall this time when the moment comes.” (I think he thought that\r\nwould make all the difference.) “What about the soldiers?” I asked. “The\r\nsoldiers oughtn’t to rebel,” he answered, “but they ought to refuse to\r\nfire on the people. They would not be breaking their oath. Their oath\r\nobliges them to fight the enemy, but not their brothers. That is wrong.”\r\nAnother cabman said a curious thing to me, as we were driving along the\r\nQuays. “We of ourselves can do nothing,” he said; “but those are the\r\npeople who will do it for us,” and he pointed to a student who was\r\npassing by.\r\n\r\nThe hall porter at the house where I lived told me he had known it all\r\nalong. “It is bad,” he said; “very bad.” I think that is really all\r\nthere is to be said about the matter. It is bad; very bad—that is to\r\nsay, if one looks back and then forward.\r\n\r\n                                                                _Later._\r\n\r\nNews has come of the appeal the ex-members of the Duma have made to the\r\ncountry, urging citizens not to pay taxes and to refuse to serve in the\r\nArmy. Everybody is agreed that their action is a fatal mistake, since\r\nthey have no means of having any such measures carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n                  IN THE COUNTRY AFTER THE DISSOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              NEAR MOSCOW, _August 1st_.\r\n\r\nI have been staying for the last three days in the country quite close\r\nto Moscow. I thought I should get away for a time from politics, from\r\ntalk of new Cabinets, new eras, liberal autocracy, strong-handed reform,\r\nand other such pleasing illusions. I was mistaken. Politics filter\r\nthrough everywhere now; in a third-class railway carriage, at the\r\nstation buffets, in the public parks, in the villages.\r\n\r\nAs regards the various opinions I heard expressed the prevailing one is\r\nthis: that the new Prime Minister’s programme of strong-handed Liberal\r\nreform is a repetition of the programme of the last five Ministers of\r\nthe Interior.\r\n\r\nM. Stolypin says these last five Premiers were all mistaken in their\r\npolicy; in the meantime (people say) it is difficult to see in what\r\nrespects his programme is to differ from theirs. And we have no evidence\r\nas yet that M. Stolypin is an infinitely more capable man than Count\r\nWitte. Some people, referring to the official denial of the article that\r\nappeared in the semi-official newspaper _Rossia_, with regard to foreign\r\nintervention, say: “If M. Stolypin cannot control the first page of his\r\nofficial newspaper, how can he expect to control Russia?” Others\r\ncommenting on his intention to initiate social reform and put a stop to\r\nthe political movement, say that this effort is the very root and kernel\r\nof the whole trouble in Russia; that the mistake of would-be reformers\r\nhas always consisted in their not understanding that social reforms are\r\nimpossible unless they are preceded by political reforms. (M.\r\nLeroy-Beaulieu, in his splendid book on Russia, writes in a most\r\nilluminating fashion on this very point.)\r\n\r\nAs regards what is actually happening in Moscow, the town is empty and\r\nquiet; public meetings are forbidden, small political gatherings in\r\nprivate houses are held only under surveillance of the police;\r\ngatherings of the “Black Gang” are said to be allowed; the Press is\r\ncertainly subjected to a rigid censorship; the _Morning Post_ arrived\r\nblacked out yesterday for the first time for two years; the manifesto of\r\nthe ex-members is being spread, likewise the manifesto of the Social\r\nDemocrats. I have not seen anybody who thinks that an era of peace and\r\nresigned content has begun.\r\n\r\nNear the house where I am living there is a village; as this village is\r\nso close to the town of Moscow I thought that its inhabitants would be\r\nsuburban, and therefore not representative of peasant life. This is not\r\nso. The nearness to Moscow seems to make no difference at all. I was\r\nwalking through the village on Saturday morning when a peasant who was\r\nsitting on his doorstep called me and asked me if I would like to eat an\r\napple. I accepted his invitation. He said he presumed I was living with\r\nX., as other Englishmen had lived there before. Then he asked abruptly,\r\n“Is Marie Alexandrovna in your place?” I said my hostess’s name was\r\nMarie Karlovna. “Of course,” he said, “I don’t mean here, but in your\r\nplace, in your country.” I didn’t understand. Then he said it again very\r\nloud, and asked if I was deaf. I said I wasn’t deaf and that I\r\nunderstood what he said, but I did not know to whom he was alluding.\r\n“Talking to you,” he said, “is like talking to a Tartar. You look at one\r\nand don’t understand what one says.” Then it suddenly flashed on me that\r\nhe was alluding to the Queen of England. “You mean Queen Alexandra,” I\r\nsaid, “the sister of the Empress Marie Feodorovna.” “That’s what I\r\nmean,” he said. It afterwards appeared that he considered that England\r\nhad been semi-Russianised owing to this relationship; he thought of\r\ncourse that both the Queen and the Empress were Russians.\r\n\r\nTwo more peasants joined us, and one of them brought a small bottle (the\r\nsize of a sample) of vodka and a plate of cherries. “We will go and\r\ndrink this in the orchard,” they said. So we went to the orchard. “You\r\nhave come here to learn,” said the first peasant, a bearded man, whose\r\nname was Feodor. “Many Englishmen have been here to learn. I taught one\r\nall the words that we use.” I said I was a correspondent; that I had\r\njust arrived from St. Petersburg, where I had attended the sittings of\r\nthe Duma. “What about the Duma?” asked the other peasant. “They’ve sent\r\nit away. Will there be another one?” I said a manifesto spoke of a new\r\none. “Yes,” said Feodor, “there is a manifesto abolishing punishments.”\r\nI said I hadn’t observed that clause. “Will they give us back our land?”\r\nasked Feodor. “All the land here belongs to us really.” Then followed a\r\nlong explanation as to why the land belonged to them. It is the\r\nproperty, as a matter of fact, of the Crown. I said I did not know. “If\r\nthey don’t give it back to us we shall take it,” he said simply. Then\r\none of the other peasants added, “Those manifestoes are not written by\r\nthe Emperor but by the ‘authorities.’” (The same thing was said to me by\r\na cabman at St. Petersburg, his reason being that the Emperor would say\r\n“I,” whereas the manifesto said “We.”) Then they asked me why they had\r\nnot won the war; and whether it was true that the war had been badly\r\nmanaged. “We know nothing,” he said. “What newspaper tells the truth?\r\nWhere can we find the real truth? Is it to be found in the _Russkoe\r\nSlovo_?” (a big Moscow newspaper). They asked me about the Baltic Fleet\r\nand why Admiral Nebogatoff had hoisted a signal which meant “Beat us.”\r\n\r\nThen I went away, and as I was going Feodor asked me if I would like to\r\ngo and see the haymaking the next day. If so I had better be at his\r\nhouse at three o’clock in the afternoon. The next day, Sunday, I kept my\r\nappointment, but found nobody at home in the house of Feodor except a\r\nsmall child. “Is Feodor at home?” I asked. Then a man appeared from a\r\nneighbouring cottage and said: “Feodor is in the inn—drunk.” “Is he\r\ngoing to the haymaking?” I asked. “Of course he’s going.” “Is he very\r\ndrunk?” I asked. “No, not very; I will tell him you are here.” And the\r\nman went to fetch him. Then a third person arrived, a young peasant in\r\nhis Sunday clothes, and asked me where I was going. I said I was going\r\nto make hay. “Do you know how to?” he asked. I said I didn’t. “I see,”\r\nhe said, “you are just going to amuse yourself. I advise you not to go.\r\nThey will be drunk, and there might be unpleasantness.”\r\n\r\nThen Feodor arrived, apparently perfectly sober except that he was\r\nrather red in the face. He harnessed his horse to a cart. “Would I mind\r\nnot wearing my hat but one of his?” he asked. I said I didn’t mind, and\r\nhe lent me a dark blue yachting cap, which is what the peasants wear all\r\nover Russia. My shirt was all right. I had got on a loose Russian shirt\r\nwithout a collar. He explained that it would look odd to be seen with\r\nsome one wearing such a hat as I had. It was a felt hat. The little boy\r\nwho was running about the house was Feodor’s son. He was barefooted, and\r\none of his feet was bound up. I asked what was the matter with it. The\r\nbandage was at once taken off and I was shown the remains of a large\r\nblister and gathering. “It’s been cured now,” Feodor said. “It was a\r\nhuge blister. It was cured by witchcraft. I took him to the Wise Woman\r\nand she put something on it and said a few words and the pain stopped,\r\nand it got quite well. Doctors are no good; they only cut one about. I\r\nwas kicked by a horse and the pain was terrible. I drank a lot of vodka\r\nand it did no good; then I went to the Wise Woman and she put ointment\r\non the place and she spoke away the pain. We think it’s best to be cured\r\nlike this—village fashion.” I knew this practice existed, but it was\r\ncurious to find it so near Moscow. It was like finding witchcraft at\r\nSurbiton.\r\n\r\nThen we started for the hay meadows, which were about ten miles distant.\r\nOn the road we met other peasants in carts bound for the same\r\ndestination. They all gravely took off their hats to each other. After\r\nan hour and a half’s drive we arrived at the Moscow River, on the bank\r\nof which there is a tea-shop. Tea-shops exist all over Russia. The\r\nfeature of them is that you cannot buy spirits there. We stopped and had\r\ntea. Everybody was brought a small teapot for tea and a huge teapot of\r\nboiling water, and very small cups, and everybody drank about four or\r\nfive cups out of the saucer. They eat the sugar separately, and do not\r\nput it into the cup.\r\n\r\nThen we crossed the river on a floating bridge, and driving past a large\r\nwhite Byzantine monastery arrived at the green hay meadows on the\r\nfarther river bank towards sunset. Then the haymaking began. The first\r\nstep which was taken was for vodka bottles to be produced and for\r\neverybody to drink vodka out of a cup. Then there was a great deal of\r\nshouting and an immense amount of abuse. “It doesn’t mean anything,”\r\nFeodor said. “We curse each other and make it up afterwards.” Then they\r\ndrew lots for the particular strip they should mow; each man carrying\r\nhis scythe high over his shoulder. (“Don’t come too near,” said Feodor;\r\n“when men have taken drink they are careless with scythes.”)\r\n\r\nWhen the lots were drawn they began mowing. It was a beautiful sight to\r\nsee the mowing in the sunset by the river; the meadows were of an\r\nintense soft green; the sky all fleecy and golden to the west, and black\r\nwith a great thundercloud over the woods to the east, lit up with\r\nintermittent summer lightnings. The mowers were all in different\r\ncoloured shirts—scarlet, blue, white, and green. They mowed till the\r\ntwilight fell and the thundercloud got near to us. Then Feodor came and\r\nmade our cart into a tent by tying up the shafts, putting a piece of\r\nmatting across them, and covering it with hay, and under this he made\r\nbeds of hay. We had supper. Feodor said his prayers, and prepared to go\r\nto sleep, but changed his mind, got up, and joined some friends in a\r\nneighbouring cart.\r\n\r\nThree children and a deaf and dumb peasant remained with me. The\r\npeasants who were in the neighbouring tent were drunk; they began by\r\nquarrelling, then they sang for about four hours without stopping; then\r\nthey talked. Feodor came back about half an hour before it was light,\r\nand slept for that brief space. I did not sleep at all. I wasn’t tired,\r\nand the singing was delightful to hear: so excessively characteristic of\r\nRussia and so utterly unlike the music of any other country, except that\r\nof Mongolia. What strikes me most about it is in the first place the\r\naccuracy with which the parts are taken, and in the second place the\r\ncurious rhythm, and the close, ending generally on the dominant. The\r\nchildren chattered for some time about mushroom gathering, and the deaf\r\nand dumb man told me a lot by signs, and then they went to sleep.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was light the mowers all got up and began mowing. I do not\r\nknow which was the more beautiful effect, that of the dusk or of the\r\ndawn. The dawn was gray with pearly clouds and suffused with the\r\nfaintest pink tinge, and in the east the sun rose like a great red ball\r\nwith no clouds near it. At ten o’clock we drove to an inn and had tea;\r\nthen we drove back, and the hay, although it was quite wet, for it had\r\nrained in the night, was carried there and then. “The women dry it at\r\nhome,” Feodor explained; “it’s too far for us to come here twice.” The\r\ncarts were laden with hay, and I drove one of them home, lying on the\r\ntop of the hay, in my sleep. I had always envied the drivers of carts\r\nwhom one meets lying on a high load of hay, fast asleep, and now I know\r\nfrom experience that there is no such delicious slumber, with the kind\r\nsun warming one through and through after a cold night, and the slow\r\njolting of the wagon rocking one, and the smell of the hay acting like a\r\nsoporific. Every now and then one wakes up to see the world through a\r\ngolden haze, and then one falls back and drowns with pleasure in a deep\r\nslumber of an inexpressibly delicious quality.\r\n\r\nWhen we re-crossed the river we again stopped for tea. As we were\r\nstanding outside an old woman passed us, and just as she passed one of\r\nthe peasants said to me, “Sit down, Barine.” Barine, I suppose everybody\r\nknows, means a _monsieur_, in contradistinction to the lower class.\r\n“Very like a Barine,” said the woman, with a sarcastic snort, upon which\r\nthe peasant told her in the plainest and most uncomplimentary speech I\r\nhave ever heard exactly what he thought of her personal appearance, her\r\nantecedents, and what she was fit for. She passed on with dignity and in\r\nsilence. Then, after a time, I climbed up on the wagon again, and sank\r\nback into my green paradise of dreams, and remember nothing more till we\r\narrived home at five o’clock in the evening.\r\n\r\n                                           ST. PETERSBURG, _August 6th_.\r\n\r\nAt a moment like this, when one meets with various conflicting\r\nstatements made by people in authority, Government officials or Liberal\r\nleaders, as to what the Russian people, the real people, are thinking\r\nand feeling, it seemed to me that it would be worth while to put aside\r\ntheoretical speculations for a moment, and to try to obtain some small\r\nfragments of first-hand evidence with regard to what the people are\r\nsaying and thinking. With this object in view I have spent the last four\r\nnights in the train between Moscow and St. Petersburg. My field of\r\nobservation was necessarily small, but it cannot be called\r\nunrepresentative or anti-national.\r\n\r\nThe first thing which struck me was a small incident which occurred at a\r\nrailway station at Moscow, and has a certain significance. I was\r\nengaging a cab, and near me an officer was doing the same thing. The\r\ncabmen were expressing reluctance to accept the officer’s terms, and my\r\ncabman turned round to me and said: “That man comes every day; he is\r\ndrunk, and he drives and drives, sometimes to the other end of the town,\r\nand never pays a single kopeck.” “Why do you drive him if he never pays\r\nyou?” I asked. “There is nothing to be done—he is an officer,” answered\r\nthe cabman. This is a small example of how the lawlessness of the\r\nexisting system of government in Russia affects the poorer classes.\r\n\r\nI travelled from Moscow to St. Petersburg by a slow train in a\r\nthird-class carriage. In the carriage was a mixed and representative\r\nassembly of people—a priest, a merchant from Kursk, a photographer from\r\nTchelabinsk, a young volunteer: that is to say a young man doing his\r\nyear’s military service previous to becoming an officer, two minor\r\npublic servants, an ex-soldier who had been through the Turkish\r\ncampaign, a soldier who had lately returned from Manchuria, three\r\npeasants, two Tartars, a small tradesman, a carpenter, and some others.\r\nBesides these a whole band of gipsies (with their children) encamped\r\nthemselves on the platform outside the carriage, and penetrated every\r\nnow and then into the carriage until they were driven out by threats and\r\ncurses.\r\n\r\nThe first thing everybody did was to make themselves thoroughly\r\ncomfortable: to arrange mattresses and pillows for the night; then they\r\nbegan to make each other’s acquaintance. We had not travelled far before\r\nthe gipsies began to sing on the platform, and this created some\r\ninterest. They suggested fortune-telling, but the ex-soldier shouted at\r\nthem in a gruff voice to begone. One of the officials had his fortune\r\ntold. The gipsy said she could do it much better for five roubles (ten\r\nshillings) than for a few kopecks, which he had given. I had my fortune\r\ntold, which consisted in a hurried rigmarole to the effect that I was\r\noften blamed, but never blamed others; that I could only work if I was\r\nmy own master, and that I would shortly experience a great change of\r\nfortune. The gipsy added that if I could give her five roubles she would\r\ntie a piece of bark in my handkerchief which, with the addition of a\r\nlittle bread and salt, would render me immune from danger. The gipsies\r\nsoon got out. The journey went on uneventfully—\r\n\r\n                     Le moine disait son bréviaire,\r\n                     La femme chantait,\r\n\r\nas in La Fontaine’s fable. We had supper and tea, and the ex-soldier\r\nrelated the experiences of his life, saying he had travelled much and\r\nseen the world (he was a Cossack by birth), and was not merely a\r\n_Moujik_. This offended one of the peasants, a bearded man, who walked\r\nup from his place and grunted in protest, and then walked back again.\r\n\r\nThey began to talk politics. The Cossack was asked his opinion on the\r\nattitude of the Cossacks. He said their attitude had changed, and that\r\nthey objected to police service. The photographer from Tchelabinsk\r\ncorroborated this statement, saying he had been present at a Cossack\r\nmeeting in Siberia. Then we had a short concert. The photographer\r\nproduced a mandoline and played tunes. All the inmates of the carriage\r\ngathered round him. One of the peasants said: “Although I am an ignorant\r\nman” (it was the peasant who had grunted) “I could see at once that he\r\nwasn’t simply playing with his fingers, but with something else” (the\r\ntortoiseshell that twangs the mandoline). He asked the photographer how\r\nmuch a mandoline cost. On being told thirty roubles he said he would\r\ngive thirty roubles to be able to play as well as that. Somebody, by way\r\nof appreciation, put a cigarette into the mouth of the photographer as\r\nhe was playing.\r\n\r\nThen I went to bed in the next compartment; but not to sleep, because a\r\ncarpenter, who had the bed opposite mine, told me the whole story of his\r\nlife which was extremely melancholy. The volunteer appeared later; he\r\nhad been educated in the Cadet-Corps, and I asked him if he would soon\r\nbe an officer. “I will never be an officer,” he answered; “I don’t want\r\nto be one _now_.” I asked him if a statement I had read in the\r\nnewspapers was true to the effect that several officers had telegraphed\r\nto the Government that unless they were relieved of police duty they\r\nwould resign. He said it was quite true; that general discontent\r\nprevailed among officers; that the life was getting unbearable; that\r\nthey were looked down upon by the rest of the people, and besides this\r\nthey were ordered about from one place to another. He liked the officers\r\nwhom he was with very much, but they were sick of the whole thing. Then\r\ntowards one in the morning I got a little sleep. As soon as it was\r\ndaylight everybody was up, making tea and busily discussing politics.\r\nThe priest and the tradesman were having a discussion about the Duma,\r\nand every one else, including the guard, was joining in.\r\n\r\n“Do you understand what the Duma was?” said the tradesman; “the Duma was\r\nsimply the people. Do you know what all that talk of a movement of\r\nliberation means? It means simply this: that we want control,\r\nresponsibility. That if you are to get or to pay five roubles or fifty\r\nroubles you will get or pay five roubles or fifty roubles, not more and\r\nnot less, and that nobody will have the right to interfere; and that if\r\nsome one interferes he will be responsible. The first thing the Duma\r\nasked for was a responsible Ministry, and the reason why it was\r\ndissolved is that the Government would not give that.”\r\n\r\nThe priest said that he approved of a Duma, but unless men changed\r\nthemselves no change of government was of any use. “Man must change\r\ninwardly,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I believe in God,” answered the tradesman, “but it is written in the\r\nScripture that God said: ‘Take the earth and cultivate it,’ and that is\r\nwhat we have got to do; to make the best of this earth. When we die we\r\nshall go to Heaven, and then”—he spoke in a practical tone of voice\r\nwhich settled the matter—“then we shall have to do with God.” The priest\r\ntook out his Bible and found a passage in the Gospel. “This\r\nrevolutionary movement will go on,” he said, “nothing can stop it now;\r\nbut, mark my words, we shall see oceans of blood shed first, and this\r\nprophecy will come true,” and he read the text about one stone not being\r\nleft on another.\r\n\r\nThen they discussed the priesthood and the part played by priests. “The\r\npriests play an abominable part,” said the tradesman; “they are worse\r\nthan murderers. A murderer is a man who goes and kills some one. He is\r\nnot so bad as the man who stays at home and tells others to kill. That\r\nis what the priests do.” He then mentioned a monk who had preached\r\nagainst the Jews in the South of Russia. “I call that man the greatest\r\ncriminal, because he stirred up the peasants’ blood, and they went to\r\nkill the Jews. Lots of peasants cease to go to church and say their\r\nprayers at home because of this. When the Cossacks come to beat them,\r\nthe priests tell them that they are sent by God. Do you believe they are\r\nsent by God?” he asked, turning to the bearded peasant.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the peasant; “I think they are sent by the devil.” The\r\npriest said that the universal dominion of the Jews was at hand. The\r\ntradesman contested this, and said that in Russia the Jews assimilated\r\nthemselves to the people more than in other countries. “The Jews are\r\ncunning,” said the priest; “the Russians are in a ditch, and they go to\r\nthe Jews and say: ‘Pull us out.’” “If that is true,” said the tradesman,\r\n“we ought to put up a gold statue to the Jews for pulling us out of the\r\nditch. Look at the time of the _pogroms_, the rich Russians ran away,\r\nbut the richest Jews stayed behind.” “They are clever; they knew their\r\nbusiness. If they stayed you may be sure they gained something by it,”\r\nsaid the merchant from Kursk. “But we ought to be clever, too,” said the\r\ntradesman, “and try and imitate their self-sacrifice. Look at the Duma.\r\nThere were twenty Jews in the Duma, but they did not bring forward the\r\nquestion of equal rights for the Jews before anything else as they might\r\nhave done. It is criminal for the priests to attack the Jews, and if\r\nthey go on like this the people will leave them.”\r\n\r\n“Whereas,” said the merchant from Kursk thoughtfully, “if they supported\r\nthe people the people would never desert them.” “The priests,” said one\r\nof the other nondescript people, “say that Catherine the Second is a\r\ngoddess; and for that reason her descendants have a hundred thousand\r\nacres. General Trepoff will be canonised when he dies, and his bones\r\nwill work miracles.”\r\n\r\nThe guard joined in here, and told his grievances at great length. They\r\ndiscussed the assassinations of Hertzenstein and Admiral Chouchnin.\r\n“Hertzenstein never did any one any harm,” some one said; “Chouchnin\r\ncondemned hundreds and hundreds of people to death.”\r\n\r\nAt one of the stations a fresh influx of people came, among others an\r\nold peasant and a young man in a blouse. The old peasant complained of\r\nthe times. “Formerly we all had enough to eat; now there is not enough,”\r\nhe said. “People are clever now. When I was a lad, if I did not obey my\r\ngrandfather immediately he used to box my ears; now my son is surprised\r\nbecause I don’t obey him. People have all become clever, and the result\r\nis we have got nothing to eat.” The young man said the Government was to\r\nblame for most things. “That’s a difficult question to be clear about.\r\nHow can we be clear about it? We know nothing,” said the old peasant.\r\n“You ought to try and know, or else things will never get better,” said\r\nthe young man. “I don’t want to listen to a _Barine_ like you,” said the\r\nold peasant. “I’m not a _Barine_, I am a peasant, even as thou art,”\r\nsaid the young man. “Nonsense,” said the old peasant.\r\n\r\nThe discussion was then cut short by our arrival at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book admits of no real conclusion, since its sole object is to\r\nthrow a few sidelights on a struggle which is still going on, and which\r\nis possibly still in its infancy. My experience of it so far leads me to\r\nbelieve that there are only two sides in this struggle (although at\r\nfirst sight it appears to be infinitely more complicated), and that\r\nthese two sides are the same which have split up all countries in all\r\ntimes under various names such as Roundheads and Cavaliers, or Reds and\r\nWhites.\r\n\r\nIn Russia the two classes are the defenders and the opponents of the\r\nGovernment, or rather of the autocracy. The former base their\r\ncontentions on the affirmation that Russia is an Oriental country and\r\nthat Western institutions are unsuited to the Russian people.\r\nParenthetically, I must mention that I am not alluding to the extreme\r\nreactionaries—to those people who wish to go back to institutions which\r\nexisted before the time of Peter the Great. I am referring to\r\nintelligent people who, while belonging to no political parties, simply\r\ndisbelieve in the Liberal movement in Russia, consider it to be the\r\nhysterical cackling of an unimportant minority, and think that the whole\r\nmatter is mere stuff and nonsense. The opinion of these people is\r\ncertainly worth considering, not because they are more impartial than\r\nothers who belong to parties, since their ideas are equally based upon\r\nprejudice, but because they may be right. These people say that all talk\r\nof a Constitution is beside the mark. They argue thus:\r\n\r\n“We must have a Constitution, just as we have an Army and a Navy,\r\nbecause the idea soothes the revolution-haunted breasts of foreign\r\nfinanciers, but we shall never have a real Constitution because we don’t\r\nwant one. Reforms? Oh, yes, as many as you please, on paper, signed and\r\ncountersigned, but they will remain a dead letter, because they are not\r\nadapted to the character and the spirit of the nation. You cannot force\r\nRussian peasants to own land in the way Western peasants do. You can\r\nmake laws telling them to do so, but if you force them you will only\r\ndrive them to rebellion. Russia is like China; you can draw up a\r\nConstitution for Russia, but when it is carried out you will find that\r\nthe only practical difference between the old state of affairs and the\r\nnew is that the writing-table of the Minister of Foreign Affairs is to\r\nbe oblong instead of round. People say that the Russian people is good\r\nand that its Government is bad, but the faults of the people are not the\r\nresult of the inherent vices of the Government; the vices of the\r\nGovernment are the logical result of the faults, which in their turn are\r\nthe inevitable complement of the good qualities, of the people. The\r\ndesire for Liberal reforms based on Western examples is merely a\r\nfictitious agitation of a minority, namely, the ‘Intelligenzia’ or\r\nmiddle class, who have forgotten and lost their native traditions and\r\ninstincts and have adopted and not properly assimilated the traditions\r\nand instincts of Western Europe. They have ceased to be Russian, and\r\nthey have not become European. They have taken the European banner of\r\nideals, but they do not know what to do with it; they cannot hold it up\r\nin their weak Slav hands. The result is words, words, words. This\r\nchatter will continue for a time, and when people get tired of\r\nlistening, it will cease. As for the people, the real people, they will\r\nsettle their affairs with those immediately connected with them, with\r\ntheir landlords, &c. The Government will make plenty of reforms on paper\r\nand have a Duma; but everything will go on exactly as it was before.\r\nBecause you cannot change the character of a people, and the form of\r\ngovernment they enjoy is the result and the expression of their\r\nqualities and of their defects.”\r\n\r\nSuch are the arguments I have often heard advanced by these people, and\r\nI say once more that they may be right. Three years ago I was firmly\r\nconvinced that they were right, and even now I have an open mind on the\r\nsubject, although two years of close contact with Russians of all\r\nclasses have led me to change my own opinion, and to agree with the\r\nother equally impartial people, who are just as Russian and have just as\r\nmuch knowledge of the country and experience of their fellow countrymen,\r\nand who flatly deny the whole thing. According to this school, the\r\ncomparison with China is wrong because the Chinese are intellectually a\r\nhighly civilised nation, and the proportion of them who can read and\r\nwrite is large. The present _régime_ in Russia is not the natural\r\nexpression of national characteristics, but a fortuitous disease which\r\nhas been allowed to spread without ever having been radically treated.\r\nNeither Autocracy nor Bureaucracy is a thing which has grown out of the\r\nimmemorial traditions and habits of the Russian people; Autocracy was\r\nthe product of a comparatively recent change in Russian history, and\r\nBureaucracy the accidental result of the further changes introduced by a\r\nman of genius. The Government made certain things impossible: such as\r\neducation for the peasants, laws for the peasants, justice, &c.; then,\r\nwhen the results of these prohibitions began to make themselves felt,\r\nturned round and said: “You see what these men are like; it is no use\r\ngiving them anything because they are hopeless; they are like niggers\r\nand must be treated as such.” This has been the proceeding of the\r\nGovernment: to prevent, prevent, and prevent again; and then, when the\r\nexplosion resulting from the prevention occurred, to observe how right\r\nthey had been in preventing, and how necessary it was to prevent more\r\nand more, because it was the only thing the people understood. In this\r\nblindness and obstinacy, year after year deferring the payment of their\r\ndebt, they have let the interest accumulate; and when they eventually\r\nhave to pay, far more will be required of them than they need originally\r\nhave surrendered.\r\n\r\nThe people who represent these two schools of thought both say that they\r\nare Russia. They assert: “We are Russia—tout le reste est littérature.”\r\nOnly time can show which is right. I have noticed that with the\r\nrepresentatives of both these schools the wish is father to the thought\r\nand that they generalise on their own desires and their own experience\r\ncoloured by those desires. Which really represents Russia, we shall know\r\nperhaps in ten years’ time. As far as my own experience goes among\r\npeasants, workmen, &c., they have all been representatives of the second\r\nschool. But then, the first school would say that this is immaterial,\r\nbecause the people may be thirsty for law, and yet incapable of drinking\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut those who belong to the second school, and without following any\r\nparty are liberal in thought and deed, say to their opponents: “If it is\r\ntrue that what you represent is really Russia, we have no further wish\r\nto remain Russians, and the day you are proved to be in the right, we\r\nwill emigrate and settle in Turkey, in Persia, or in China.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n Agrarian Question,

Cloth, 1s. net._\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the great and steady sale of their Sixpenny Novels,\r\nMessrs. Methuen have determined to issue a new series of fiction at a\r\nlow price under the title of ‘THE SHILLING NOVELS.’ These books are well\r\nprinted and well bound in _cloth_, and the excellence of their quality\r\nmay be gauged from the names of those authors who contribute the early\r\nvolumes of the series.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Methuen would point out that the books are as good and as long\r\nas a six shilling novel, that they are bound in cloth and not in paper,\r\nand that their price is One Shilling _net_. They feel sure that the\r\npublic will appreciate such good and cheap literature, and the books can\r\nbe seen at all good booksellers.\r\n\r\nThe first volumes are—\r\n\r\n  =Balfour (Andrew).= VENGEANCE IS MINE.\r\n\r\n  TO ARMS.\r\n\r\n  =Baring-Gould (S.).= MRS.
