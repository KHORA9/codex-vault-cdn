Men are necessarily\r\nactors in the scenes amid which they live. If not personally taking an\r\nactive part in the conduct of public affairs, they have friends who are,\r\nand in whose success or failure their own welfare is in some way bound\r\nup. The bias which interest always gives will necessarily attach to\r\ntheir judgment of current events, and the leading actors by whom these\r\nevents are controlled. Cotemporaneous history, for this reason, will\r\nalways be found partisan history--not entitled to, and, if intelligently\r\nand honestly written, not exacting, the implicit faith of those who\r\nshall come after; but simply establishing that certain classes of\r\npeople, of whom the writer was one, acted under the conviction that they\r\nowed certain duties to themselves and their country. It will be for the\r\nfuture compiler of the world's history, who shall see the end of present\r\nstruggles, to determine the justice of the causes of controversy, and\r\nthe wisdom and honesty of the parties that acted adversely. To such\r\nafter judgment, with a full knowledge of present reproach as a partisan,\r\nthe writer of this article commends the brief sketch he will present of\r\nthe beginning and military treatment of the great Rebellion in the State\r\nof Missouri. He will not attempt to make an episode of any part of this\r\nhistory, because of the supposed vigor or brilliancy of the martial\r\ndeeds occurring in the time. Least of all would he take the 'Hundred\r\nDays,' which another pen has chosen for special distinction, as\r\nrepresenting the period of heroism in that war-trampled State. Any\r\n'hundred days' of the rebellion in Missouri have had their corresponding\r\n_nights_; and no one can be bold enough yet to say that the day of\r\npermanent triumph has dawned. Humiliation has alternated with success so\r\nfar; and the most stunning defeats of the war in the West marked the\r\nbeginning and the close of the hundred days named for honor. This fact\r\nshould teach modesty and caution. For while justice to men requires us\r\nto admit that the greatest abilities do not always command success,\r\ndevotion to principle forbids that a noble cause should be obscured to\r\nbecome the mere background of a scene in which an actor and popular idol\r\nis the chief figure. It is with a consciousness of such partialities as\r\nare common to men, but with an honest purpose, so far as the writer is\r\nable, to subordinate men to principles, that this review of the origin\r\nand chief incidents of the rebellion in Missouri is begun.\r\n\r\nThe close connection of the State of Missouri with the slavery agitation\r\nthat has now ripened into a rebellion against the government of the\r\nUnited States, is a singular historical fact. The admission of the State\r\ninto the Union was the occasion of vitalizing the question of slavery\r\nextension and fixing it as a permanent element in the politics of the\r\ncountry. It has continued to be the theatre on which the most important\r\nconflicts growing out of slavery extension have been decided. It will be\r\nthe first, in the hope and belief of millions, to throw off the fetters\r\nof an obsolete institution, so long cramping its social and political\r\nadvancement, and to set an example to its sister slave-holding States of\r\nthe superior strength, beauty, and glory of Freedom.\r\n\r\nThe pro-slavery doctrines of John C. Calhoun, after having pervaded the\r\ndemocracy of all the other slave-holding States, and obtained complete\r\npossession of the national executive, legislative and judicial\r\ndepartments, finally, in 1844, appeared also in the State of Missouri.\r\nBut it was in so minute and subtle a form as not to seem a sensible\r\nheresy. Thomas H. Benton, the illustrious senator of the Jackson era,\r\nwas then, as he had been for twenty-four years, the political autocrat\r\nof Missouri. He had long been convinced of the latent treason of the\r\nCalhoun school of politicians. He was able to combat the schemes of the\r\nSouthern oligarchy composing and controlling the Cabinet of President\r\nPolk; unsuccessfully, it is true, yet with but slight diminution of his\r\npopularity at home. Nevertheless, the seeds of disunion had been borne\r\nto his State; they had taken root; and, like all evil in life, they\r\nproved self-perpetuating and ineradicable. In 1849 the Mexican war,\r\nbegun in the interest of the disunionists, had been closed. A vast\r\naccession of territory had accrued to the Union. It was the plan and\r\npurpose of the disunion party to appropriate and occupy this territory;\r\nto organize it in their interests; and, finally, to admit it into the\r\nUnion as States, to add to their political power, and prepare for that\r\nstruggle between the principle of freedom and the principle of slavery\r\nin the government, which Mr. Calhoun had taught was inevitable. But the\r\nhostility of Benton in the Senate was dreaded by the Southern leaders\r\nthus early conspiring against the integrity of the Union. The Missouri\r\nsenator seemed, of all cotemporaneous statesmen, to be the only one that\r\nfully comprehended the incipient treason. His earnest opposition assumed\r\nat times the phases of _monomania_. He sought to crush it in the egg. He\r\nlifted his warning voice on all occasions. He inveighed bitterly against\r\nthe 'Nullifiers,' as he invariably characterized the Calhoun\r\npoliticians, declaring that their purpose was to destroy the Union. It\r\nbecame necessary, therefore, before attempting to dispose of the\r\nterritories acquired from Mexico, to silence Benton, or remove him from\r\nthe Senate. Accordingly, when the legislature of Missouri met in 1849, a\r\nseries of resolutions was introduced, declaring that all territory\r\nderived by the United States, in the treaty with Mexico, should be open\r\nto settlement by the citizens of all the States in common; that the\r\nquestion of allowing or prohibiting slavery in any territory could only\r\nbe decided by the people resident in the territory, and then only when\r\nthey came to organize themselves into a State government; and, lastly,\r\nthat if the general government should attempt to establish a rule other\r\nthan this for the settlement of the territories, the State of Missouri\r\nwould stand pledged to her sister Southern States to co-operate in\r\nwhatever measures of resistance or redress _they_ might deem necessary.\r\nThe resolutions distinctly abdicated all right of judgment on the part\r\nof Missouri, and committed the State to a blind support of Southern\r\n'Nullification' in a possible contingency. They were in flagrant\r\nopposition to the life-long principles and daily vehement utterances of\r\nBenton--as they were intended to be. Nevertheless, they were adopted;\r\nand the senators of Missouri were instructed to conform their public\r\naction to them. These resolutions were introduced by one Claiborne F.\r\nJackson, a member of the House of Representatives from the County of\r\nHoward, one of the most democratic and largest slave-holding counties in\r\nthe State. The resolutions took the name of their mover, and are known\r\nin the political history of Missouri as the 'Jackson resolutions.' And\r\nClaiborne F. Jackson, who thus took the initiative in foisting treason\r\nupon the statute-books of Missouri, is, to-day, by curious coincidence,\r\nthe official head of that State nominally in open revolt. But Jackson,\r\nit was early ascertained, was not entitled to the doubtful honor of the\r\npaternity of these resolutions. They had been matured in a private\r\nchamber of the Capitol at Jefferson City, by two or three conspirators,\r\nwho received, it was asserted by Benton, and finally came to be\r\nbelieved, the first draft of the resolutions from Washington, where the\r\ndisunion cabal, armed with federal power, had its headquarters.\r\n\r\nThus the bolt was launched at the Missouri senator, who, from his\r\nprestige of Jacksonism, his robust patriotism, his indomitable will, and\r\nhis great abilities, was regarded as the most formidable if not the only\r\nenemy standing in the way of meditated treason. It was not doubted that\r\nthe blow would be fatal. Benton was in one sense the father of the\r\ndoctrine of legislative instructions. In his persistent and famous\r\nefforts to 'expunge' the resolutions of censure on Gen. Jackson that had\r\nbeen placed in the Senate journal, Benton had found it necessary to\r\nrevolutionize the sentiments or change the composition of the Senate.\r\nWhigs were representing democratic States, and Democrats refused to vote\r\nfor a resolution expunging any part of the record of the Senate's\r\nproceedings. To meet and overcome this resistance, Benton introduced the\r\ndogma that a senator was bound to obey the instructions of the\r\nlegislature of his State. He succeeded, by his great influence in his\r\nparty, and by the aid of the democratic administration, in having the\r\ndogma adopted, and it became an accepted rule in the democratic party.\r\nResolutions were now invoked and obtained from State legislatures\r\ninstructing their senators to vote for the 'Expunging Resolutions,' or\r\nresign. Some obeyed; some resigned. Benton carried his point; but it was\r\nat the sacrifice of the spirit of that part of the Constitution which\r\ngave to United States senators a term of six years, for the purpose of\r\nprotecting the Senate from frequent fluctuations of popular feeling, and\r\nsecuring steadiness in legislation. Benton was the apostle of this\r\nunwise and destructive innovation upon the constitutional tenure of\r\nsenators. He was doomed to be a conspicuous victim of his own error.\r\nWhen the 'Jackson resolutions' were passed by the legislature of\r\nMissouri, instructing Benton to endorse measures that led to\r\nnullification and disunion, he saw the dilemma in which he was placed,\r\nand did the best he could to extricate himself. He presented the\r\nresolutions from his seat in the Senate; denounced their treasonable\r\ncharacter, and declared his purpose to appeal from the legislature to\r\nthe people of Missouri.\r\n\r\nOn the adjournment of Congress, Benton returned to Missouri and\r\ncommenced a canvass in vindication of his own cause, and in opposition\r\nto the democratic majority of the legislature that passed the Jackson\r\nresolutions, which has had few if any parallels in the history of the\r\ngovernment for heat and bitterness. The senator did not return to argue\r\nand convert, but to fulminate and destroy. He appointed times and places\r\nfor public speaking in the most populous counties of the State, and\r\nwhere the opposition to him had grown boldest. He allowed no 'division\r\nof time' to opponents wishing to controvert the positions assumed in his\r\nspeeches. On the contrary, he treated every interruption, whether for\r\ninquiry or retort, on the part of any one opposed to him, as an insult,\r\nand proceeded to pour upon the head of the offender a torrent of\r\ndenunciation and abuse, unmeasured and appalling. The extraordinary\r\ncourse adopted by Benton in urging his 'appeal,' excited astonishment\r\nand indignation among the democratic partisans that had, in many cases,\r\nthoughtlessly become arrayed against him.[A] They might have yielded to\r\nexpostulation; they were stung to resentment by unsparing vilification.\r\nThe rumor of Benton's manner preceded him through the State, after the\r\nfirst signal manifestations of his ruthless spirit; and he was warned\r\nnot to appear at some of the appointments he had made, else his life\r\nwould pay the forfeit of his personal assaults. These threats only made\r\nthe Missouri lion more fierce and untamable. He filled all his\r\nappointments, bearing everywhere the same front, often surrounded by\r\nenraged enemies armed and thirsting for his blood, but ever denunciatory\r\nand defiant, and returned to St. Louis, still boiling with inexhaustible\r\ncholer, to await the judgment of the State upon his appeal. He failed.\r\nThe pro-slavery sentiment of the people had been too thoroughly evoked\r\nin the controversy, and too many valuable party leaders had been\r\nneedlessly driven from his support by unsparing invective. An artful and\r\napparently honest appeal to the right of legislative instructions,--an\r\nenlargement of popular rights which Benton himself had conferred upon\r\nthem,--and--the unfailing weapon of Southern demagogues against their\r\nopponents--the charge that Benton had joined the 'Abolitionists,' and\r\nwas seeking to betray 'the rights of the South,' worked the overthrow of\r\nthe hitherto invincible senator. The Whigs of Missouri, though agreeing\r\nmainly with Benton in the principles involved in this contest, had\r\nreceived nothing at his hands, throughout his long career, but defeat\r\nand total exclusion from all offices and honors, State and National.\r\nThis class of politicians were too glad of the prospective division of\r\nhis party and the downfall of his power, to be willing to re-assert\r\ntheir principles through a support of Benton. The loyal Union sentiments\r\nof the State in this way failed to be united, and a majority was elected\r\nto the legislature opposed to Benton. He was defeated of a re-election\r\nto the Senate by Henry S. Geyer, a pro-slavery Whig, and supporter of\r\nthe Jackson resolutions, after having filled a seat in that august body\r\nfor a longer time consecutively than any other senator ever did. Thus\r\nwas removed from the halls of Congress the most sagacious and formidable\r\nenemy that the disunion propagandists ever encountered. Their career in\r\nCongress and in the control of the federal government was thenceforth\r\nunchecked. The cords of loyalty in Missouri were snapped in Benton's\r\nfall, and that State swung off into the strongly-sweeping current of\r\nsecessionism. The city of St. Louis remained firm a while, and returned\r\nBenton twice to the House; but his energies were exhausted now in\r\ndefensive war; and the truculent and triumphant slave power dominating,\r\nthe State at last succeeded, through the coercion of commercial\r\ninterests, in defeating him even in the citadel of loyalty. He tried\r\nonce more to breast the tide that had borne down his fortunes. He became\r\na candidate for governor in 1856; but, though he disclaimed anti-slavery\r\nsentiments, and supported James Buchanan for President against Fremont,\r\nhis son-in-law, he was defeated by Trusten Polk, who soon passed from\r\nthe gubernatorial chair to Benton's seat in the United States Senate,\r\nfrom which he was, in course of time, to be expelled. Benton retired to\r\nprivate life, only to labor more assiduously in compiling historical\r\nevidences against the fast ripening treason of the times.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri senator was no longer in the way of the Southern oligarchs.\r\nA shaft feathered by his own hands--the doctrine of instructions--had\r\nslain him.\r\n\r\nBut yet another obstacle remained. The Missouri Compromise lifted a\r\nbarrier to the expansion of the Calhoun idea of free government, having\r\nAfrican slavery for its corner-stone. This obstacle was to be removed.\r\nMissouri furnished the prompter and agent of that wrong in David E.\r\nAtchison, for many years Benton's colleague in the Senate. Atchison was\r\na man of only moderate talents, of dogged purpose, willful, wholly\r\nunscrupulous in the employment of the influences of his position, and\r\ndevoid of all the attributes and qualifications of statesmanship. He was\r\na fit representative of the pro-slavery fanaticism of his State; had\r\nlived near the Kansas line; had looked upon and coveted the fair lands\r\nof that free territory, and resolved that they should be the home and\r\nappanage of slavery. It is now a part of admitted history, that this\r\ndull but determined Missouri senator approached Judge Douglas, then\r\nchairman of the Committee on Territories, and, by some incomprehensible\r\ninfluence, induced that distinguished senator to commit the flagrant and\r\nterrible blunder of reporting the Kansas-Nebraska bill, with a clause\r\nrepealing the Missouri Compromise, and thus throwing open Kansas to the\r\noccupation of slavery. That error was grievously atoned for in the\r\nsubsequent hard fate of Judge Douglas, who was cast off and destroyed by\r\nthe cruel men he had served. Among the humiliations that preceded the\r\nclose of this political tragedy, none could have been more pungent to\r\nJudge Douglas than the fact that Atchison, in a drunken harangue from\r\nthe tail of a cart in Western Missouri, surrounded by a mob of 'border\r\nruffians' rallying for fresh wrongs upon the free settlers of Kansas,\r\nrecited, in coarse glee and brutal triumph, the incidents of his\r\ninterview with the senator of Illinois, when, with mixed cajolery and\r\nthreats, he partly tempted, partly drove him to his ruin. The\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill was passed. What part Atchison took, what part\r\nMissouri took, under the direction of the pro-slavery leaders that\r\nfilled every department of the State government, the 'border-ruffian'\r\nforays, the pillage of the government arsenal at Liberty, the embargo of\r\nthe Missouri river, and the robbing and mobbing of peaceful emigrants\r\nfrom the free States, the violence at the polls, and the fraudulent\r\nvoting that corrupted all the franchises of that afflicted territory, do\r\nsufficiently attest. It is not needed to rehearse any of this painful\r\nand well-known history.\r\n\r\nThe Territory of Kansas was saved to its prescriptive freedom. The\r\nslavery propagandists sullenly withdrew and gave up the contest. The\r\nlast days of the dynasty that had meditated the conquest of the\r\ncontinent to slave-holding government were evidently at hand. The result\r\nof the struggle in Kansas had reversed the relation of the contesting\r\npowers. The oligarchs, who had always before been aggressive, and\r\nintended to subordinate the Union to slavery, or destroy it, found\r\nthemselves suddenly thrown on the defensive; and, with the quick\r\nintelligence of a property interest, and the keen jealousy of class and\r\ncaste which their slave-holding had implanted, they saw that they were\r\nengaged in an unequal struggle, that their sceptre was broken, and that,\r\nif they continued to rule, it would have to be over the homogeneous half\r\nof a dismembered Union. From this moment a severance of the Slave\r\nStates from the Free was resolved on, and every agency that could\r\noperate on governments, State and National, was set to work. It was not\r\nby accident that Virginia had procured the nomination of the facile\r\nBuchanan for President in the Baltimore Convention of 1856; it was not\r\nby accident that Floyd was made Secretary of War, or that, many months\r\nbefore any outbreak of rebellion, this arch traitor had well-nigh\r\nstripped the Northern arsenals of arms, and placed them where they would\r\nbe 'handy' for insurgents to seize. It was not by accident that John C.\r\nBreckenridge headed the factionists that willfully divided and defeated\r\nthe National Democracy, that perchance could have elected Judge Douglas\r\nPresident; nor was it by accident that Beriah Magoffin, a vain, weak\r\nman, the creature, adjunct, and echo of Breckenridge, filled the office\r\nof governor of Kentucky, nominated thereto by Breckenridge's personal\r\nintercession. And lastly, to return to the special theatre of this\r\nsketch, it was not by accident that Claiborne F. Jackson, the original\r\nmover for Benton's destruction, was at this remarkable juncture found\r\noccupying the governor's chair, with Thomas C. Reynolds for his\r\nlieutenant governor, a native of South Carolina, an acknowledged\r\nmissionary of the nullification faith to a State that required to be\r\ncorrupted, and that he had, during his residence, zealously endeavored\r\nto corrupt.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the turning point in the history of Missouri. The\r\nState is about to be plunged into the whirlpool of civil war.\r\nUndisguised disunionists are in complete possession of the State\r\ngovernment, and the population is supposed to be ripe for revolt. Only\r\none spot in it, and that the city of St. Louis, is regarded as having\r\nthe slightest sympathy with the political sentiments of the Free States\r\nof the Union. The State is surely counted for the 'South' in the\r\ndivision that impends, for where is the heart in St. Louis bold enough,\r\nor the hand strong enough, to resist the swelling tide of pro-slavery\r\nfanaticism that was about to engulf the State? Years ago, when it was\r\nbut a ripple on the surface, it had overborne Benton, with all his fame\r\nof thirty years' growth. What leader of slighter mold and lesser fame\r\ncould now resist the coming shock? In tracing the origin and growth of\r\nrebellion in Missouri, it is interesting to gather up all the threads\r\nthat link the present with the past. It will preserve the unity of the\r\nplot, and give effect to the last acts of the drama.\r\n\r\nThe first visible seam or cleft in the National Democratic party\r\noccurred during the administration of President Polk, in the years\r\n1844-48. Calhoun appeared as Polk's Secretary of State. Thomas Ritchie\r\nwas transferred from Richmond, Va., to Washington, to edit the\r\ngovernment organ, in place of Francis P. Blair, Sr. The Jackson _regime_\r\nof unconditional and uncompromising devotion to the 'Federal Union' was\r\ndisplaced, and the dubious doctrine of 'States' Rights' was formally\r\ninaugurated as the chart by which in future the national government was\r\nto be administered. But the Jackson element was not reconciled to this\r\nradical change in the structure and purpose of the National Democratic\r\norganization; and, although party lines were so tensely drawn that to go\r\nagainst 'the Administration' was political treason, and secured\r\nirrevocable banishment from power, the close of Polk's administration\r\nfound many old Democrats of the Jackson era ready for the sacrifice. The\r\nfirm resolve of these men was manifested when, after the nomination of\r\nGen. Cass, in 1848, in the usual form, at Baltimore, by the Democratic\r\nNational Convention, they assembled at Buffalo and presented a counter\r\nticket, headed by the name of Martin Van Buren, who had been thrust\r\naside four years previously by the Southern oligarchs to make way for\r\nJames K. Polk. The entire artillery of the Democratic party opened on\r\nthe Buffalo schismatics. They were stigmatized by such opprobrious\r\nnicknames and epithets as 'Barnburners, 'Free Soilers,'\r\n'Abolitionists,' and instantly and forever ex-communicated from the\r\nDemocratic party. In Missouri alone, of all the Slave States, was any\r\nstand made in behalf of the Buffalo ticket. Benton's sympathies had been\r\nwith Van Buren, his old friend of the Jackson times; and Francis P.\r\nBlair, Sr., of the _Globe_, had two sons, Montgomery Blair and Francis\r\nP. Blair, Jr., resident in St. Louis. These two, with about a hundred\r\nother young men of equal enthusiasm, organized themselves together,\r\naccepted the 'Buffalo platform' as their future rule of faith, issued an\r\naddress to the people of Missouri, openly espousing and advocating free\r\nsoil-principles; and, by subscription among themselves, published a\r\ncampaign paper, styled the _Barnburner_, during the canvass. The result\r\nat the polls was signal only for its insignificance; and the authors of\r\nthe movement hardly had credit for a respectable escapade. But the event\r\nhas proved that neither ridicule nor raillery, nor, in later years,\r\npersecutions and the intolerable pressure of federal power, could turn\r\nback the revolution thus feebly begun. In that campaign issue of the\r\n_Barnburner_ were sown the seeds of what became, in later nomenclature,\r\nthe Free Democracy, and, later still, the 'Republican' party of\r\nMissouri. The German population of St. Louis sympathized from the start\r\nwith the free principles enunciated. Frank Blair, Jr., became from that\r\nyear their political leader; right honestly did he earn the position;\r\nand right well, even his political foes have always admitted, did he\r\nmaintain it.\r\n\r\nFrank Blair was a disciple of Benton; yet, as is often the case, the\r\npupil soon learned to go far ahead of his teacher. In 1852, there was a\r\nunion of the Free Democrats and National Democrats of Missouri, in\r\nsupport of Franklin Pierce. But the entire abandonment of Pierce's\r\nadministration to the rule of the Southern oligarchs sundered the\r\nincongruous elements in Missouri forever. In 1856 Benton was found\r\nsupporting James Buchanan for President; but Blair declined to follow\r\nhis ancient leader in that direction. He organized the free-soil element\r\nin St. Louis to oppose the Buchanan electoral ticket. An electoral\r\nticket in the State at large, for John C. Fremont, was neither possible\r\nnor advisable. In some districts no man would dare be a candidate on\r\nthat side; in others, the full free-soil vote, from the utter\r\nhopelessness of success, would not be polled; and thus the cause would\r\nbe made to appear weaker than it deserved. To meet the emergency, and\r\nyet bear witness to principle, the free-soil vote was cast for the\r\nFillmore electoral ticket, 'under protest,' as it was called, the name\r\nof 'John C. Fremont' being printed in large letters at the head of every\r\nfree-soil ballot cast. By this means the Buchanan electors were beaten\r\nfifteen hundred votes in St. Louis City and County, where, by a union as\r\nBenton proposed, they would have had three thousand majority. But the\r\n'free-soilers' failed to defeat Buchanan in the State.\r\n\r\nNothing discouraged by this result, Blair resumed the work of organizing\r\nfor the future. The Fillmore party gave no thanks to the free-soilers\r\nfor their aid in the presidential election, nor did the latter ask any.\r\nThey had simply taken the choice of evils; and now, renouncing all\r\nalliances, Blair became the champion and leader of a self-existing,\r\nself-reliant State party, that should accomplish emancipation in\r\nMissouri. He again established a newspaper to inculcate free principles\r\nin the State. By untiring effort, he revived and recruited his party. He\r\ngave it platforms, planned its campaigns, contested every election in\r\nSt. Louis, whether for municipal officers, for State legislature, or for\r\nCongress; and always fought his battles on the most advanced ground\r\nassumed by the growing free-soil party of the Union. The powerful and\r\nrapidly-increasing German population of St. Louis responded nobly to his\r\nzeal and skillful leadership. Soon a victory was gained; and St. Louis\r\ndeclared for freedom, amid acclamations that reverberated throughout the\r\nStates that extended from the Ohio to the lakes, and from the\r\nMississippi to the Atlantic. But, having wrenched victory from a people\r\nso intolerant as the pro-slavery population of Missouri, it was not to\r\nbe expected that he would retain it easily. He was set upon more\r\nfiercely than ever. The loss of the city of St. Louis was considered a\r\ndisgrace to the State; and the most desperate personal malignity was\r\nadded to the resentment of pro-slavery wrath in the future election\r\ncontests in that city. The corrupting appliances of federal power were\r\nat last invoked, under Buchanan's administration; and Blair was for the\r\nmoment overwhelmed by fraud, and thrown out of Congress. But, with a\r\nresolution from which even his friends would have dissuaded him, and\r\nwith a persistency and confidence that were a marvel to friend and foe,\r\nhe contested his seat before Congress, and won it. And this verdict was\r\nsoon ratified by his brave and faithful constituency at the polls. Such\r\nwas the Republican party, such their leader in St. Louis, when the black\r\nday of disunion came. And in their hands lay the destiny of the State.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the presidential election was decided, and the choice of\r\nAbraham Lincoln was known, the disunionists in Missouri commenced their\r\nwork. Thomas C. Reynolds, the lieutenant-governor, made a visit to\r\nWashington, and extended it to Virginia, counseling with the traitors,\r\nand agreeing upon the time and manner of joining Missouri in the revolt.\r\nThe legislature of Missouri met in the latter part of December, about\r\ntwo weeks after the secession of South Carolina. A bill was at once\r\nintroduced, calling a State convention, and passed. The message of\r\nClaiborne F. Jackson, the governor, had been strongly in favor of\r\nsecession from the Union. The Missouri _Republican_, the leading\r\nnewspaper of the State, whose advocacy had elected the traitor,\r\ndeclared, on the last day of the year, that unless guaranties in defence\r\nof slavery were immediately given by the North, Missouri should secede\r\nfrom the Union. And so the secession feeling gathered boldness and\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nCandidates for the State convention came to be nominated in St. Louis,\r\nand two parties were at once arrayed--the unconditional Union party, and\r\nthe qualified Unionists, who wished new compromises. Frank Blair was one\r\nof the leaders of the former, and he was joined by all the true men of\r\nthe old parties. But the secessionists--they might as well be so called,\r\nfor all their actions tended to weaken and discredit the\r\nUnion--nominated an able ticket. The latter party were soon conscious of\r\ndefeat, and began to hint mysteriously at a power stronger than the\r\nballot-box, that would be invoked in defence of 'Southern rights.' To\r\nmany, indeed to most persons, this seemed an idle threat. Not so to\r\nFrank Blair. He had imbibed from Benton the invincible faith of the\r\nlatter in the settled purpose of the 'nullifiers' to subvert and destroy\r\nthe government. And in a private caucus of the leaders of the Union\r\nparty, on an ever-memorable evening in the month of January, he startled\r\nthe company by the proposition that the time had come when the friends\r\nof the government must arm in its defence. With a deference to his\r\njudgment and sagacity that had become habitual, the Unionists yielded\r\ntheir consent, and soon the enrolment of companies began; nightly drills\r\nwith arms took place in nearly all the wards of the city; and by the\r\ntime of election day some thousands of citizen soldiers, mostly Germans,\r\ncould have been gathered, with arms in their hands, with the quickness\r\nof fire signals at night, at any point in the city. The secessionists\r\nhad preceded this armed movement of the Union men by the organization of\r\na body known as 'minute-men.' But the promptness and superior skill that\r\ncharacterized Frank Blair's movement subverted the secession scheme; and\r\nit was first repudiated, and then its existence denied. The day of\r\nelection came, and passed peacefully. The unconditional Union ticket was\r\nelected by a sweeping majority of five thousand votes. The result\r\nthroughout the State was not less decisive and surprising. Of the entire\r\nnumber of delegates composing the convention, not one was chosen who had\r\ndared to express secession sentiments before the people; and the\r\naggregate majority of the Union candidates in the State amounted to\r\nabout eighty thousand. The shock of this defeat for the moment paralyzed\r\nthe conspirators; but their evil inspirations soon put them to work\r\nagain. Their organs in Missouri assumed an unfriendly tone towards the\r\nconvention, which was to meet in Jefferson City. The legislature that\r\nhad called the convention remained in session in the same place, but\r\nmade no fit preparations for the assembling of the convention, or for\r\nthe accommodation and pay of the members. The debate in the legislature\r\non the bill for appropriations for these purposes was insulting to the\r\nconvention, the more ill-tempered and ill-bred secession members\r\nintimating that such a body of 'submissionists' were unworthy to\r\nrepresent Missouri, and undeserving of any pay. The manifest ill feeling\r\nbetween the two bodies--the legislature elected eighteen months\r\npreviously, and without popular reference to the question of secession,\r\nand the convention chosen fresh from the people, to decide on the course\r\nof the State--soon indicated the infelicity of the two remaining in\r\nsession at the same time and in the same place. Accordingly, within a\r\nfew days after the organization of the convention, it adjourned its\r\nsession to the city of St. Louis. It did not meet a cordial reception\r\nthere. So insolent had the secession spirit already grown, that on the\r\nday of the assembling of the convention in that city, the members were\r\ninsulted by taunts in the streets and by the ostentatious floating of\r\nthe rebel flag from the Democratic head-quarters, hard by the building\r\nin which they assembled.\r\n\r\nBeing left in the undisputed occupancy of the seat of government, the\r\ngovernor, lieutenant-governor, and legislature gave themselves up to the\r\nenactment of flagrant and undisguised measures of hostility to the\r\nfederal government. Commissioners from States that had renounced the\r\nConstitution, and withdrawn, as they claimed, from the Union, arrived at\r\nJefferson City as apostles of treason. They were received as\r\ndistinguished and honorable ambassadors. A joint session of the\r\nlegislature was called to hear their communications. The\r\nlieutenant-governor, Reynolds, being the presiding officer of the joint\r\nsession, required that the members should rise when these traitors\r\nentered, and receive them standing and uncovered. The commissioners were\r\nallowed to harangue the representatives of Missouri, by the hour, in\r\nunmeasured abuse of the federal government, in open rejoicings over its\r\nsupposed dissolution, and in urgent appeals to the people of Missouri to\r\njoin the rebel States in their consummated treason. Noisy demonstrations\r\nof applause greeted these commissioners; and legislators, and the\r\ngovernor himself, in a public speech in front of the executive mansion,\r\npledged them that Missouri would shortly be found ranged on the side of\r\nseceded States. The treason of the governor and legislature did not stop\r\nwith these manifestations. They proceeded to acts of legislation,\r\npreparatory to the employment of force, after the manner of their\r\n'Southern bretheren.' First, it was necessary to get control of the city\r\nof St. Louis. The Republican party held the government of the city,\r\nmayor, council, and police force--a formidable Union organization. The\r\nlegislature passed a bill repealing that part of the city charter that,\r\ngave to the mayor the appointment of the police, and constituting a\r\nboard of police commissioners, to be appointed by the governor, who\r\nshould exercise that power. He named men that suited his purposes. The\r\nUnion police were discharged, and their places filled by secessionists.\r\nNext, the State militia was to be organized in the interests of\r\nrebellion, and a law was passed to accomplish that end. The State was\r\nset off into divisions; military camps were to be established in each;\r\nall able-bodied men between the ages of eighteen and fifty were liable\r\nto be called into camp and drilled a given number of days in the year;\r\nand, when summoned to duty, instead of taking the usual oath to support\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, they were required only to be\r\nsworn 'to obey the orders of the governor of the State of Missouri.'\r\nThese camps were styled camps of instruction. One of them was\r\nestablished at St. Louis, within the corporate limits of the city, about\r\ntwo miles west of the court-house, on a commanding eminence.\r\n\r\nThus the lines began to be drawn closely around the Unionists of St.\r\nLouis. The State convention had adjourned, and its members had gone\r\nhome, having done but little to re-assure the loyalists. They had,\r\nindeed, passed an ordinance declaring that Missouri would adhere to the\r\nUnion; but the majority of the members had betrayed such hesitancy and\r\nindecision, such a lack of stomach to grapple with the rude issues of\r\nthe rebellion, that their action passed almost without moral effect.\r\nTheir ordinance was treated with contempt by the secessionists, and\r\nnearly lost sight of by the people; so thoroughly were all classes\r\nlashed into excitement by the storm of revolution now blackening the\r\nwhole Southern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the Union could look to but one quarter for aid, that was\r\nWashington, where a new administration had so recently been installed,\r\namid difficulties that seemed to have paralyzed its power. The\r\ngovernment had been defied by the rebellion at every point; its ships\r\ndriven by hostile guns from Southern ports; its treasures seized; its\r\narsenals occupied, and its abundant arms and munitions appropriated.\r\nNowhere had the federal arm resented insult and robbery with a blow.\r\nThis had not been the fault of the government that was inaugurated on\r\nthe fourth of March. It was the fruit of the official treason of the\r\npreceding administration, that had completely disarmed the government,\r\nand filled the new executive councils with confusion, by the numberless\r\nknaves it had placed in all departments of the public service, whose\r\ndaily desertions of duty rendered the prompt and honest execution of the\r\nlaws impossible. But the fact was indisputable; and how could St. Louis\r\nhope for protection that had nowhere else been afforded? The national\r\ngovernment had an arsenal within the city limits. It comprised a\r\nconsiderable area of ground, was surrounded by a high and heavy stone\r\nwall, and supplied with valuable arms. But so far from this\r\nestablishment being a protection to the loyal population, it seemed more\r\nlikely, judging by what had occurred in other States, that it would\r\nserve as a temptation to the secession mob that was evidently gathering\r\nhead for mischief, and that the desire to take it would precipitate the\r\noutbreak. The Unionists felt their danger; the rebels saw their\r\nopportunity. Already the latter were boasting that they would in a short\r\ntime occupy this post, and not a few of the prominent Union citizens of\r\nthe town were warned by secession leaders that they would soon be set\r\nacross the Mississippi river, exiles from their homes forever. As an\r\ninstance of the audacity of the rebel element at this time, and for\r\nweeks later, the fact is mentioned that the United States soldiers, who\r\npaced before the gates of the arsenal as sentinels on duty, had their\r\nbeats defined for them by the new secession police, and were forbidden\r\nto invade the sacred precincts of the city's highway. The arsenal was\r\nunquestionably devoted to capture, and it would have been a prize to the\r\nrebels second in value to the Gosport navy-yard. It contained at this\r\ntime sixty-six thousand stand of small arms, several batteries of light\r\nartillery and heavy ordnance, and at least one million dollars' worth of\r\nammunition. It was besides supplied with extensive and valuable\r\nmachinery for repairing guns, rifling barrels, mounting artillery, and\r\npreparing shot and shell. The future, to the Union men of St. Louis,\r\nlooked gloomy enough; persecution, and, if they resisted, death, seemed\r\nimminent; and no voice from abroad reached them, giving them good cheer.\r\nBut deliverance was nigh at hand.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of January, Capt. Nathaniel Lyon, of the Second\r\nInfantry, U.S.A., arrived in St. Louis with his company; and his rank\r\ngave him command of all the troops then at the arsenal and Jefferson\r\nBarracks, a post on the river, ten miles below, the department being\r\nunder the command of Brigadier General Harney. Capt. Lyon had been\r\ngarrisoning a fort in Kansas. He was known to some of the Union men of\r\nSt. Louis; and his resolute spirit and devoted patriotism marked him as\r\ntheir leader in this crisis. Frank Blair at once put himself in\r\ncommunication with Capt. Lyon, and advised him fully and minutely as to\r\nthe political situation. He exposed to him the existence of his\r\nvolunteer military organization. At his request Capt. Lyon visited and\r\nreviewed the regiments; and it was arranged between them that if an\r\noutbreak should occur, or any attempt be made to seize the arsenal,\r\nCapt. Lyon should receive this volunteer force to his assistance, arm it\r\nfrom the arsenal, and take command for the emergency. It should be\r\nknown, however, to the greater credit of the Union leaders of St. Louis,\r\nthat they had already, from private funds, procured about one thousand\r\nstand of arms, with which their nightly drills, as heretofore stated,\r\nhad been conducted. As soon as Capt. Lyon's connection with this\r\norganization was suspected, an attempt was made to have him removed, by\r\nordering him to Kansas on the pretext of a court of inquiry; but this\r\nattempt was defeated. Thus matters stood for a time, the Union men\r\nbeginning to be reassured, but still doubtful of the end. After a while,\r\nFort Sumter was opened upon, and fell under its furious bombardment. The\r\ntorch of war was lit. President Lincoln issued his proclamation for\r\nvolunteers. Gov. Jackson telegraphed back an insolent and defiant\r\nrefusal, in which he denounced the 'war waged by the federal government'\r\nas 'inhuman and diabolical.' Frank Blair instantly followed this\r\ntraitorous governor's dispatch by another, addressed to the Secretary of\r\nWar, asking him to accept and muster into service the volunteer\r\nregiments he had been forming. This offer was accepted, and the men\r\npresented themselves. But Brig. Gen. Harney, fearing that the arming of\r\nthese troops would exasperate the secession populace, and bring about a\r\ncollision with the State militia, refused to permit the men to be\r\nmustered into service and armed. This extraordinary decision was\r\nimmediately telegraphed to the government, and Gen. Harney was relieved,\r\nleaving Capt. Lyon in full command. This was the 23d of April. In a week\r\nfour full regiments were mustered in, and occupied the arsenal. A\r\nmemorial was prepared and sent to Washington by Frank Blair, now colonel\r\nof the first of these regiments, asking for the enrolment of five other\r\nregiments of Home Guards. Permission was given, and in another week\r\nthese regiments also were organized and armed. The conflict was now at\r\nhand. Simultaneously with this arming on the part of the government for\r\nthe protection of the arsenal, the order went forth for the assembling\r\nof the State troops in their camps of instruction. On Monday, the 6th of\r\nMay, the First Brigade of Missouri militia, under Gen. D.M. Frost, was\r\nordered by Gov. Jackson into camp at St. Louis, avowedly for purposes of\r\ndrill and exercise. At the same time encampments were formed, by order\r\nof the governor, in other parts of the State. The governor's adherents\r\nin St. Louis intimated that the time for taking the arsenal had arrived,\r\nand the indiscreet young men who made up the First Brigade openly\r\ndeclared that they only awaited an order from Gov. Jackson--an order\r\nwhich they evidently had been led to expect--to attack the arsenal and\r\npossess it, in spite of the feeble opposition they calculated to meet\r\nfrom 'the Dutch' Home Guards enlisted to defend it. A few days\r\npreviously, an agent of the governor had purchased at St. Louis several\r\nhundred kegs of gun-powder, and succeeded, by an adroit stratagem, in\r\nshipping it to Jefferson City. The encampment at St. Louis, 'Camp\r\nJackson,' so called from the governor, was laid off by streets, to which\r\nwere assigned the names 'Rue de Beauregard,' and others similarly\r\nsignificant; and when among the visitors whom curiosity soon began to\r\nbring to the camp a 'Black Republican' was discovered by the\r\nsoldiers,--and this epithet was applied to all unconditional\r\nUnionists,--he was treated with unmistakable coldness, if not positive\r\ninsult. If additional proof of the hostile designs entertained against\r\nthe federal authority by this camp were needed, it was furnished on\r\nThursday, the 9th, by the reception within the camp of several pieces of\r\ncannon, and several hundred stand of small arms, taken from the federal\r\narsenal at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which was then in the possession of\r\nthe rebels. These arms were brought to St. Louis by the steamboat _J.C.\r\nSwon_, the military authorities at Cairo having been deceived by the\r\npackages, which were represented to contain marble slabs. On the arrival\r\nof the _Swon_ at the St. Louis levee, the arms were taken from her, sent\r\nto Camp Jackson, and received there with demonstrations of triumph.\r\n\r\nWhen Capt. Lyon was entrusted with full command at St. Louis, President\r\nLincoln had named, in his orders to him, a commission of six loyal and\r\ndiscreet citizens with whom he should consult in matters pertaining to\r\nthe public safety, and with whose counsel he might declare martial law.\r\nThese citizens were John How, Samuel T. Glover, O.D. Filley, Jean J.\r\nWitsig, James O. Broadhead, and Col. Frank P. Blair. The last\r\nmentioned--Colonel Blair--was Capt. Lyon's confidential and constant\r\ncompanion. They were comrades in arms, and a unit in counsel. Their\r\nviews were in full accord as to the necessity of immediately reducing\r\nCamp Jackson. Defiance was daily passing between the marshalling hosts,\r\nnot face to face, but through dubious partisans who passed from camp to\r\ncamp, flitting like the bats of fable in the confines of conflict. Capt.\r\nLyon's decision, urged thereto by Col. Blair, was made without calling a\r\ncouncil of the rest of his advisers. They heard of it, however, and,\r\nthough brave and loyal men all, they gathered around him in his quarters\r\nat the arsenal, Thursday evening, and besought him earnestly to change\r\nhis purpose. The conference was protracted the livelong night, and did\r\nnot close till six o'clock, Friday morning, the 10th. They found Capt.\r\nLyon inexorable,--the fate of Camp Jackson was decreed. Col. Blair's\r\nregiment was at Jefferson Barracks, ten miles below the arsenal, at that\r\nhour. It was ordered up; and about noon on that memorable Friday, Capt.\r\nLyon quietly left the arsenal gate at the head of six thousand troops,\r\nof whom four hundred and fifty were regulars, the remainder United\r\nStates Reserve Corps or Home Guards, marched in two columns to Camp\r\nJackson, and before the State troops could recover from the amazement\r\ninto which the appearance of the advancing army threw them, surrounded\r\nthe camp, planting his batteries upon the elevations around, at a\r\ndistance of five hundred yards, and stationing his infantry in the roads\r\nleading from the grove wherein their tents were pitched. The State\r\ntroops were taken completely by surprise; for, although there had been\r\nvague reports current in camp of an intended attack from the arsenal,\r\nthe cry of the visitors at the grove, 'They're coming!' 'They're\r\ncoming!' raised just as the first column appeared in sight, found them\r\nstrolling leisurely under the trees, chatting with their friends from\r\nthe city, or stretched upon the thick green grass, smoking and reading.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBEAUFORT DISTRICT,--PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sovereign State of South Carolina seems from the beginning to have\r\nbeen actuated by the desire not only to mold its institutions according\r\nto a system differing entirely from that of its sister States, but even\r\nto divide its territory in a peculiar manner, for which reason we find\r\nin it 'districts' taking the place of counties. The south-west of these\r\nbears the name of its principal town, 'Beaufort.' It is bounded on the\r\nwest by the Savannah River, and on the south by the Atlantic. Its length\r\nfrom north to south is fifty-eight miles, its breadth thirty-three\r\nmiles, and it contains about one and a quarter millions of acres of land\r\nand water. Considered geologically, Beaufort is one of the most\r\nremarkable sections of the United States. As recent events have brought\r\nit so prominently before us, we propose to consider its history,\r\ncapacities, and prospects.\r\n\r\nFrom its proximity to the Spanish settlements in the peninsula of\r\nFlorida, its beautiful harbors and sounds were early explored and taken\r\npossession of by the Spaniards. It is now certain they had established a\r\npost here called 'Fort St. Phillip,' at St. Elena,[B] as early as\r\n1566-7; this was probably situated on the south-western point of St.\r\nHelena Island, and some remains of its entrenchment can still be traced.\r\nFrom this fort Juan Pardo, its founder, proceeded on an expedition to\r\nthe north-west, and explored a considerable part of the present States\r\nof South Carolina and Georgia.\r\n\r\nHow long the Spaniards remained here is now uncertain, but they long\r\nclaimed all this coast as far north as Cape Fear. The French planted a\r\ncolony in South Carolina, and gave the name Port Royal to the harbor and\r\nwhat is now called Broad River; but they were driven off by the\r\nSpaniards, and history is silent as to any incidents of their rule for a\r\ncentury. In 1670 a few emigrants arrived in a ship commanded by Capt.\r\nHilton, and landed at what is now known as 'Hilton's Head,' the\r\nsouth-western point of Port Royal harbor, which still perpetuates his\r\nname. The colony was under the management of Col. Sayle; but the\r\nSpaniards at St. Augustine still claimed the domains, and the settlers,\r\nfearing an attack, soon removed to the site of Old Charleston, on Ashley\r\nRiver. In 1682, Lord Cardoss led a small band from Scotland hither,\r\nwhich settled on Port Royal Island, near the present site of Beaufort.\r\nHe claimed co-ordinate authority with the governor and council at\r\nCharleston. During the discussion of this point the Spaniards sent an\r\narmed force and dislodged the English, most of whom returned to their\r\nnative country. A permanent settlement was finally made on Port Royal\r\nIsland in 1700. The town of Beaufort was laid out in 1717, and an\r\nEpiscopal church erected in 1720. The name was given from a town in\r\nAnjou, France, the birthplace of several of the Huguenot settlers.\r\n\r\nFor many years the Spaniards threatened the coast as far north as\r\nCharleston, but the settlement increased, and extended over St. Helena\r\nand other islands. Slavery was here coeval with settlement, and the\r\npeculiar institution was so earnestly fostered, that in 1724 it was\r\nestimated that South Carolina contained 18,000 slaves to only 14,000\r\nwhites. The slaves were mostly natives of Africa of recent importation,\r\nand were poorly adapted to clear up the forests and prepare the way for\r\nextensive plantations, but their cost was small, and every year they\r\nimproved in capacity and value. In the succeeding half century were laid\r\nthe fortunes of the prominent families who have controlled the district,\r\nand often greater interests, to our day. Grants of land could be had\r\nalmost for the asking, especially by men of influence; and fertile\r\nislands were given, containing hundreds and sometimes thousands of\r\nacres, to a single family, who have here been monarchs of all they\r\nsurvey, including hundreds of slaves, till _the Hegira_ or _flight_ A.D.\r\n1861.\r\n\r\nWhen we take into account the salubrity of the climate and the fertility\r\nof the soil, we must allow that this district has many natural\r\nadvantages which can not be excelled by any section of the same extent\r\nin this country. A considerable part of the district is composed of\r\nislands, which are supposed to be of a comparatively recent formation,\r\nmany of them beautiful to the eye, and rich in agricultural facilities;\r\nthey are in number upwards of fifty, not less than thirty of them being\r\nof large size. Upon the sea-coast are Reynolds, Prentice, Chaplins,\r\nEddings, Hilton Head, Dawfuskie, Turtle, and the Hunting Islands. Behind\r\nthese lie St. Helena, Pinckney, Paris, Port Royal, Ladies', Cane,\r\nBermuda, Discane, Bells, Daltha, Coosa, Morgan, Chissolm, Williams\r\nHarbor, Kings, Cahoussue, Fording, Barnwell, Whale, Delos, Hall, Lemon,\r\nBarrataria, Lopes, Hoy, Savage, Long, Round, and Jones Islands. These\r\nare from one to ten miles in length, and usually a proportional half in\r\nwidth. St. Helena is over twenty miles in extent, and could well support\r\nan agricultural population of twenty thousand. Port Royal is next in\r\nsize, but, being of a more sandy formation, is not so fertile. These\r\nislands are all of an alluvial formation,--the result of the action of\r\nthe rivers and the sea. There is no rock of any kind, not even a pebble\r\nstone, to be found in the whole district.\r\n\r\nThe soil of these islands is composed mostly of a fine sandy loam, very\r\neasily cultivated. In most of them are swamps and marshes, which serve\r\nto furnish muck and other vegetable deposits for fertilizing; but the\r\nidea of furnishing anything to aid the long over-worked soil seems to\r\nthese proprietors like returning to the slave some of the earnings taken\r\nfrom him or his ancestors, and is seldom done till nature is at last\r\nexhausted, and then it is allowed only a few years' repose. Situated\r\nunder the parallel of 32 deg., there is scarcely a product grown in our\r\ncountry, of any value, that can not be produced here. Previous to the\r\nRevolution the principal staple for market was indigo, and that raised\r\nin this district always commanded the highest price. It was from the\r\nproceeds of this plant that the planters were enabled for a long period\r\nto purchase slaves and European and northern American productions. Soon\r\nafter the Revolution their attention was turned to cotton; but the\r\ndifficulty of separating it from the seed seemed to make it impossible\r\nto furnish it in any profitable quantity, for so slow was the process\r\nthen followed that, with the utmost diligence, a negro could not, by\r\nhand labor, clean over a few pounds per day. The genius of Whitney,\r\nhowever, opened a new era to the cotton planters, who were much more\r\neager to avail themselves of his invention than to remunerate him. It\r\nwas soon perceived that the cotton raised on these islands was far\r\nsuperior to that produced in the interior, which is still called Upland,\r\nonly to distinguish it from the 'Sea Island.' It was also noticed that\r\nwhile the common variety produced a seed nearly green with a rough skin,\r\nthe seed of the islands soon became black with a smooth skin; the effect\r\nentirely of location and climate, as it soon resumes its original color\r\nwhen transported back to the interior. The cultivation of this variety\r\nis limited to a tract of country of about one hundred and fifty miles in\r\nlength, and not over twenty-five miles in breadth, mostly on lands\r\nadjacent to the salt water, the finest 'grades' being confined to the\r\nislands within this district. It is true that black-seed cotton is\r\ncultivated to some extent along the coast from Georgetown, S.C., to St.\r\nAugustine, but a great part of it is of an inferior quality and staple,\r\nand brings in the market less than one-half the price of the real 'Sea\r\nIsland.' This plant seems to delight in the soft and elastic atmosphere\r\nfrom the Gulf Stream, and, after it is 'well up,' requires but a few\r\nshowers through the long summer to perfect it. It is of feeble growth,\r\nparticularly on the worn-out lands, and two hundred pounds is a good\r\nyield from an acre. An active hand can tend four acres, besides an acre\r\nof corn and 'ground provisions;' but with a moderate addition of\r\nfertilizers and rotation of crops no doubt these productions would be\r\ndoubled. If the yield seems small, the price, however, makes it one of\r\nthe most profitable products known. The usual quotations for choice Sea\r\nIslands in Charleston market has been for many years about four times as\r\ngreat as for the middling qualities of Uplands,--probably an average of\r\nfrom thirty-five to forty-five cents per pound; and for particular\r\nbrands[C] sixty to seventy cents is often paid. The writer has seen a\r\nfew bales, of a most beautiful color and length of staple, which sold\r\nfor eighty cents, when middling Uplands brought but ten cents per pound.\r\nIt is mostly shipped to France, where it is used for manufacturing the\r\nfinest laces, and contributes largely to the texture of fancy silks,\r\nparticularly the cheaper kinds for the American market. After passing\r\nabove the flow of the salt water, but within the rise of the tide, there\r\nis a wide alluvial range along the rivers and creeks, which, by a system\r\nof embankments, can be flowed or drained at pleasure. This is cultivated\r\nwith rice, and, if properly cared for, yields enormous crops, sometimes\r\nof sixty bushels to an acre. The land is composed of a mass of muck,\r\noften ten feet deep and inexhaustible, and never suffers from drought.\r\nThis land is very valuable, one hundred dollars often being paid per\r\nacre for large plantations. Much rice land, however, remains uncleared\r\nfor want of the enterprise and perseverance necessary to its\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nFarther in the interior the land is principally of a sandy formation,\r\nmost of it underlaid with clay. Very little effort is, however, made by\r\nplanters to cultivate it, although it is very easily worked, and with a\r\nlittle manuring yields fair crops of corn and sweet potatoes. The cereal\r\ngrains are seldom cultivated, but no doubt they would yield well. A\r\nlarge portion of the main-land is composed of swamps, of which only\r\nenough have been reclaimed to make it certain that here is a mine of\r\nwealth to those gifted with the energy to improve it. The soil is as\r\nfertile as the banks of the Nile, and nowhere could agricultural\r\nenterprise meet with such certainly profitable returns. Recurring again\r\nto the agricultural capacity of the islands, it is certain that good\r\ncrops of sugar-cane can be grown on them. During the war of 1812, the\r\nplanters turned their attention to it, and succeeded well, since which\r\ntime many of them have continued to plant enough for their own use; but\r\nthis plant soon exhausts such a soil, unless some fertilizer is used,\r\nand they therefore prefer cotton, which draws a large part of its\r\nsustenance from the atmosphere alone. The sweet and wild orange grows\r\nhere, and some extensive groves are to be seen. Figs are produced in\r\nabundance from September till Christmas. Gardens furnish abundant\r\nvegetables, yielding green peas in March and Irish potatoes in May,\r\nwhile numerous tribes of beautiful flowers hold high carnival for more\r\nthan half the year.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the true home of the rose, which is found blooming from\r\nMarch until Christmas. Many of the rare climbing varieties of this\r\nflower, which we see at the North only as small specimens in\r\ngreen-houses, grow here in wild profusion. The grape is represented by\r\nmany species indigenous to this State alone, and could, no doubt, be\r\ncultivated and produced in greater variety and perfection than elsewhere\r\non this continent, as the climate is more equable. A species of Indian\r\ncorn, called 'white flint corn,' and which when cooked is very\r\nnutritious and white as snow, seems indigenous to these islands. It is\r\nmuch superior to the common varieties.\r\n\r\nOf the sylva we will only say, it is equal in value and variety to that\r\nof any section of our country. Here is the home of the palmetto[D] or\r\ncabbage tree, the only palm in our wide country. The live oak, once so\r\nabundant, has, however, been largely cut off, mostly to supply our\r\nnavy-yards, and some of the ships built from it are now blockading the\r\nvery harbors from which it was carried. The pitch pine is the common\r\ngrowth of the interior, and under a new system would form a valuable\r\narticle of commerce as lumber, and as yielding the _now_ so much\r\nrequired turpentine. Of wild animals and birds, here are to be found a\r\nlarge variety. The Hunting Islands and others are well stocked with\r\ndeer. During the winter wild, geese and ducks abound, and a variety of\r\nfish, with fine oysters, can be had at all seasons.\r\n\r\nWe now come to consider the present inhabitants of this district. The\r\nwhites are almost entirely the descendants of the earliest settlers of\r\nthis State, who were English,[E] Scotch, and Protestant Irish, with a\r\nslight infusion of the Huguenot and Swiss elements. A century and a half\r\nhas rendered them homogeneous. As there has never been any interest here\r\nother than agriculture, and as every man may be said to own the\r\nplantation he cultivates, there has been as little change of property or\r\ncondition as possible, and therefore the same land and system of\r\ncultivation has passed from father to son through four or five\r\ngenerations. Had there been any emigration or change of population, some\r\nalterations, and most likely new enterprise and vigor, would have been\r\ninfused, and more modern and national feeling have been instituted for\r\ntheir narrow and sectional prejudices. No doubt our national character\r\nhas been much influenced by the division of land. Where this has been\r\nnearly equal, as in our New England towns, a republican form of\r\ngovernment has been almost a necessity. But at the South an entirely\r\ndifferent arrangement has prevailed. Land was at first distributed in\r\nlarge bodies fitted to accommodate a state of slavery; and the\r\nconsequence was that a feudal system was inaugurated from the\r\nsettlement, which has continued with increasing power. This has been one\r\nof the permanent causes of Southern pride and exclusiveness.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of South Carolina and Virginia previous to the\r\nRevolution were very supercilious towards the North, and even to their\r\nless opulent neighbors of Georgia and North Carolina; a feeling which\r\nwas often the cause of much antagonism among the officers and soldiers\r\nduring the war. Charleston and Williamsburg gave the tone to good\r\nsociety, and it was haughty and aristocratic in the extreme. While\r\nVirginia has for the last half century been in a state of comparative\r\ndecay, South Carolina has, by its culture of cotton and rice, just been\r\nable to hold its own; but the pride and exclusiveness of its people have\r\nincreased much faster than its material interests. Although the\r\nConstitution of the United States guarantees to every State a republican\r\nform of government, no thinking person who has resided for a single week\r\nwithin the limits of South Carolina can have failed to see and feel\r\nthat a tyranny equal to that of Austria exists there. The freedom of\r\nopinion and its expression were not permitted. Strangers were always\r\nunder espionage, and public opinion, controlled by an oligarchy of\r\nslave-holders, overruled laws and private rights. Nowhere, even in South\r\nCarolina, was this feeling of _hauteur_ so strong as in that portion of\r\nthe State which we are describing. On the large plantations the owners\r\nruled with power unlimited over life and property, and could a faithful\r\nrecord be found it would prove one of vindictive oppression, productive\r\noftentimes of misery and bloodshed. Most of the wealthier planters in\r\nthe district have residences at Beaufort, to which they remove during\r\nthe summer months to escape the malaria arising from the soil around\r\ntheir inland houses. This place may be considered the home of the\r\naristocracy. Here reside the Barnwells,[F] Heywards, Rhetts[G](formerly\r\ncalled Smiths,) Stuarts, Means, Sams, Fullers,[H] Elliots,[I] Draytons\r\nand others, altogether numbering about fifty families, but bearing not\r\nmore than twenty different names, who rule and control the country for\r\nforty miles around. This is the most complete and exclusive approach to\r\n'nobility' of blood and feeling on our continent. Nowhere else is family\r\npride carried to such an extent. They look with supercilious disdain on\r\nevery useful employment, save only the planting of cotton and rice.\r\nNothing in any of our large cities can equal the display of equipages,\r\nwith their profusion of servants in livery, exhibited on pleasant\r\nafternoons, when the mothers and daughters of these cotton lords take\r\ntheir accustomed airing. So powerfully has this feeling of exclusiveness\r\nprevailed that no son or daughter dares marry out of their circle. For a\r\nlong series of years has this custom prevailed, and the consequence is\r\nthat the families above named are nearly of a common blood; and it needs\r\nno physiologist to tell us the invariable effect arising from this\r\ntransgression of natural laws, on the physical and mental faculties of\r\nboth sexes. In such a state of society is it strange that the present\r\ngeneration should have grown up with ideas better suited to the castes\r\nof India than to those of republican America? As a consequence they\r\nconsider their condition more elevated than that of their neighbors in\r\nthe adjoining States, and of almost imperial consideration. But no\r\nlanguage can express their bitter contempt for the people of the North,\r\nmore particularly for those of New England birth.\r\n\r\nIn perusing the history and progress of any portion of our country, the\r\nstatistics of population become an interesting study. Let us glance over\r\na brief table, showing what the increase has been in this district for\r\nthe past forty years, and its miserable deficiency in physical means of\r\nstrength and defense. In 1820 the district contained 32,000 souls, of\r\nwhich there were 4,679 whites and 27,339 slaves, and 141 free blacks. In\r\n1860 there were 6,714 whites and 32,500 slaves, and 800 free blacks,\r\nmaking a total of 40,014,--an increase of whites of 2,035, of slaves\r\n5,161, of free blacks 650:--total increase 7,855 in forty years. Here we\r\nhave nearly the largest disproportion of whites to slaves in any part of\r\nthe South. Of the 6,714 whites, about 1,000 are probably men over\r\ntwenty-one years of age, and it is not to be presumed that an equal\r\nnumber are capable of bearing arms. Is it possible to find anywhere a\r\ncommunity more helpless for its own protection or defense? It is one of\r\nthe truths of science and philosophy that nature, when forced beyond its\r\nown powers and laws, will react, and again restore its own supremacy. So\r\nwe here find a magnificent space of country, rich in all natural\r\nrequisites, and unsurpassed in its capabilities of producing not only\r\nthe necessaries of life, but its luxuries, having an exclusive right to\r\nsome of the most valuable staples of the world, which has been for a\r\ncentury and a half the abode of an imperious few, who have, by\r\ntyrannical power, wrung from the bones and muscles of generations of\r\npoor Africans the means to sustain their luxury, power, and pride. They\r\nhave also robbed from the mother earth the fertility of its soil to its\r\nutmost extent, leaving much of it completely exhausted. This state of\r\nthings has reacted on them; it has made them proud, domineering,\r\nambitious, and revengeful of fancied injuries. It has hurried them into\r\nrebellion against the best government the world ever saw,--and this has\r\nat last brought with it its own punishment and retribution. It has\r\nplaced their soil, their mansions, their crops and poor slaves in the\r\npossession of the hated men of the North, and under the laws and control\r\nof the government they affected to despise. When the last gun had\r\nsounded from the ramparts at Port Royal, and the Stars and Stripes again\r\nresumed their supremacy on the soil of South Carolina, a new era dawned\r\nover these beautiful islands and waters, and the day that witnessed the\r\nretreat of the rebel forces should hereafter mark, like the flight of\r\nMahomet, the inauguration of a new dispensation for this land and its\r\npeople. Let us, therefore, in continuing our chronicles, cast the\r\nhoroscope, and, without claiming any spirit of prophecy, show the duties\r\nof our nation in this contingency, and the beneficial results that must\r\nflow from it, if carried out with the energy, perseverance, and\r\npractical Christianity due to our country and the age in which we live.\r\n\r\nThe accession to any government of new territory brings with it new\r\nduties, which it is always important should be performed with energy and\r\ndecision, so that the greatest good, to the greatest number, may be the\r\nresult. A good Providence has placed the domain under consideration in\r\nour possession. Its political condition is to us unique, and almost\r\nembarrassing. If the question is asked, 'Can we hold and dispose of a\r\npart, or whole, of a sovereign State as a conquered province?' the\r\nanswer must be in the affirmative. Government is supreme, and must be\r\nexercised, particularly to protect the weak, and for the general good of\r\nthe whole nation. Here is a region, as fair as the sun shines upon, now\r\nin a great measure deserted and lying waste. What is to be done with it?\r\nand what is our duty in this exigency? The first want is a government,\r\nfor without a proper one no progress can be made. Let Congress then at\r\nonce establish a territorial government over so much of the State as we\r\nnow have in our possession, and over what we may in future obtain;--not\r\na government to exhibit pomp, and show, but one practical and useful,\r\nwith a court and its proper officers. Let every large unrepresented\r\nestate be placed in the hands of a temporary administrator, who should\r\nbe a practical and honest man, and held to a strict account for all\r\nproperties entrusted to his keeping, and who should act also as guardian\r\nto the slaves belonging to the estate. Then enforce the collection of a\r\ntax; and if the owner comes forward within sixty days, pays the tax,\r\ntakes the oath of allegiance, and agrees to remain in the territory and\r\nassist in enforcing and executing the laws, during that and the\r\nsucceeding year, let him resume his property, and be protected in all\r\nhis rights. But in default of any loyal response from the proprietor,\r\nthe property should be disposed of, in moderate quantities, to actual\r\nsettlers, who should be bound to do duty for its defense, whenever\r\ncalled upon.\r\n\r\nBut then comes the great difficulty, the disposition of the slaves,--the\r\ngreat question which has so long been discussed as a theory, and which\r\nnow has to be met as a practical measure. Let us meet it as men and\r\npatriots, and, rising above the clamor of fanatics, or the proclamations\r\nof new-fangled and demagoguing brigadiers, look at the permanent result\r\nto our whole country, and the real good of the African race.\r\n\r\nHumanity, society, and property, all have claims and acknowledged\r\nrights; let them all be considered. It is well known that the slaves on\r\nthese islands have always been kept in a state of greater ignorance of\r\nthe world and all practical matters than those inhabiting the border\r\nStates, or where there is a larger proportion of whites, with whom they\r\noften labor and associate. To emancipate them at once would be to do a\r\ngreat wrong to the white man, to the property, in whatever hands it\r\nmight be, and a still greater injury to the slave. There can be but one\r\nway of disposing of this question which will satisfy the nation, and\r\nquiet the fears of the conservative, and preserve the hopes of the\r\nradical, which is, to pursue a _middle_ course--a policy which shall as\r\nnearly as possible equalize the question to all parties. Let the slave\r\nbe retained on the plantation where he is found; and, as no race are so\r\nmuch attached to their own locality, so let them remain, place them\r\nunder a proper system of APPRENTICESHIP, with a mild code of laws, where\r\nevery right shall be protected, where suitable instruction, civil and\r\nreligious, shall be given, and where the marriage rite shall be\r\nadministered and respected. Under such laws and beneficent institutions,\r\nthis territory would soon be settled by men from the West, the North,\r\nand from Europe, intelligent, enterprising, and industrious, who would\r\nretrieve its worn-out fields, and introduce new systems of culture, with\r\nall the modern labor-saving utensils. With kind treatment and new hopes,\r\nthe simple sons of Africa would have inducements to labor and to await\r\nwith patient hope the future and its rewards. Then would Beaufort\r\nDistrict become what the Giver of all good designed it to be--the abode\r\nof an industrious, peaceful, and prosperous community. The production of\r\nits great staple, 'Sea-Island cotton,' would be immensely increased, and\r\nits quality improved, till it rivaled the silks of the Old World. The\r\nyield of rice would be doubled, and its gardens and orchards would\r\nsupply the North with fruits now known only to the tropics.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the new government was fairly inaugurated, and the condition\r\nof the land and its future cultivation settled, a movement would of\r\nnecessity be made to found here a city which would be the great\r\ncommercial metropolis of the South.\r\n\r\nCharleston was 'located' at the wrong place, simply with the object of\r\nbeing as distant as possible from the Spanish settlements, and has\r\nalways suffered from an insufficient depth of water on its bars to\r\naccommodate the largest class of merchant ships. It has barely sixteen\r\nfeet of water at high tide, and ships loaded as lightly as possible\r\nhave often been obliged to wait for weeks to enter or leave the port. A\r\ndecrease of one or two feet in its main channel would, in its palmiest\r\ndays, have been fatal to its prosperity. The sinking of a dozen ships\r\nloaded with stone has no doubt placed a permanent barrier to the\r\nentrance of all but a small class of vessels. The ships themselves may\r\nsoon be displaced or destroyed by the sea-worm, but the New England\r\ngranite will prove a lasting monument to the folly and madness of the\r\nrebellion. The destruction of the best part of the city by fire seems\r\nalso to show that Providence has designed it to be ranked only with the\r\ncities of the past.\r\n\r\nThe productions of South Carolina have always been large and valuable,\r\nand since the completion of their system of railroad facilities they\r\nhave greatly increased; therefore a commercial city is a necessity, and\r\nPort Royal must be its locality. Here is the noblest harbor south of the\r\nChesapeake, with a draught of water of from twenty-five to thirty feet,\r\nenough for the largest-sized ships, and sufficient anchorage room for\r\nall the navies of the world. Our government should here have a naval\r\ndepot to take the place of Norfolk, since there is no more suitable\r\nplace on the whole coast. In this connection the name, Royal Port, is\r\ntruly significant.\r\n\r\nThe precise locality for the new city can not now be indicated, but we\r\nwould suggest the point some two miles south-west of Beaufort, which\r\nwould give it a position not unlike New York. It would have the straight\r\nBroad River for its Hudson, with a fine channel on the south and east\r\ncommunicating with numerous sounds and rivers. Its situation on an\r\nisland of about the same length as Manhattan completes the parallel.\r\n\r\nThe value of the produce conveyed over the sounds and rivers connecting\r\nwith Port Royal, by sloops and steamers, must be counted by millions of\r\ndollars. We may estimate the crop of Sea-Island cotton at about fifteen\r\nthousand bales, or six millions of pounds, and of rice about fifty\r\nmillion pounds. Yankee enterprise would soon double the amount, and add\r\nto it an immense bulk of naval stores and lumber.\r\n\r\nBut this is but a moiety of what the exports would be. A branch railroad\r\nonly ten miles long would connect this port with all the railroads of\r\nSouth Carolina and Georgia, which, diverging from Charleston and\r\nSavannah, spread themselves over a large part of five States. This road\r\nwould make tributary to this place a vast district of country.\r\n\r\nSavannah, which has for the last few years competed with Charleston for\r\nthis trade, will soon feel the power of the government, and it must\r\nyield up a large part of its business to the more favorable location of\r\nthe new city.\r\n\r\nA few short years, and what a change may come over these beautiful\r\nislands and the waters that hold them in its embrace! A fair city,\r\nactive with its commerce and manufactures, wharves and streets lined\r\nwith stores and dwellings, interspersed with churches and schools,\r\ninhabited by people from every section of our country, and from every\r\npart of Europe, all interested to improve their own condition, and all\r\ncombining to add strength and wealth to the Union which they agree to\r\nrespect, love, honor, and defend!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ANTE-NORSE DISCOVERERS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE MYTHICAL ERA.\r\n\r\nWho were the first settlers in America?\r\n\r\nWithin a few years our school-books pointed to Cristoval Colon, or\r\nColumbus, and his crew, as the first within the range of history who\r\n'passed far o'er the ocean blue' to this hemisphere. Now, however, even\r\nthe school-books--generally the last to announce novel truths--say\r\nsomething of the Norsemen in America, though they frequently do it in a\r\ndiscrediting and discreditable way. However, the old Vikings have\r\ntriumphed once more, even in their graves, and Professor Rafn can prove\r\nas conclusively that his fierce ancestry trod the soil of Boston as that\r\nthe Mayflower Puritans followed in their footsteps. It is a dim old\r\nstory, laid away in Icelandic manuscripts, and confirmed by but few\r\nrelics on our soil; yet it is strong enough to give New England a link\r\nto the Middle Ages of Europe, with their wildest romance and strangest\r\nelements. It is pleasant to think that far back in the night there\r\nwalked for a short season on these shores great men of that hearty\r\nNorse-Teuton race which in after times flowed through France into\r\nEngland, and from England through the long course of ages hitherward.\r\nAmong the old Puritan names of New England there is more than one which\r\nmay be found in the roll of Battle Abbey, and through the Norse-Norman\r\nspelling of which we trace the family origin of fierce sea-kings in\r\ntheir lowland isles or rocky lairs on the Baltic.\r\n\r\nBut there are older links existing between America and Europe than this\r\nof the Norseman. Of these the first is indeed buried in mystery--leading\r\nus back into that sombre twilight of 'symbolism,' as the Germans\r\nsomewhat obscurely call the study of the early ages whose records are\r\nlost, and which can only be traced by reflection in the resemblances\r\nbetween mythologies which argue a common origin, and the monuments\r\nremaining, which seem to establish it. Yes, America has this in common\r\nwith every country of Asia, Europe, and Africa: she has relics which\r\nindicate that at one time she was inhabited by a race which had perhaps\r\nthe same faith, the same stupendous nature-worship, with that of the Old\r\nWorld, and which was, to reason by analogy, _possibly_ identified by the\r\nsame language and customs. What _was_ this race, this religion, this\r\nlanguage? Who shall answer? Men like Faber, and Higgins, and Lajard,\r\nwith scores of others, have unweariedly gathered together all the points\r\nof resemblance between the religions and mythologies of the Hindus and\r\nEgyptians and Chinese, the Druids and the Phenicians, the Etruscans and\r\nthe Scandinavians, and old Sclavonic heathen, and found in and between\r\nand through them all a startling identity: everywhere the Serpent,\r\neverywhere the Queen of Heaven with her child, everywhere the cup of\r\nlife and the bread and honey of the mysteries, with the salt of the\r\norgie, everywhere a thousand fibres twining and trailing into each other\r\nin bewildering confusion, indicating a common origin, yet puzzling\r\nbeyond all hope those who seek to find it. So vast is the wealth of\r\nmaterial which opens on the scholar who seeks to investigate this common\r\norigin of mythologies, and with them the possible early identity of\r\nraces and of languages, that he is almost certain to soon bury himself\r\nin a hypothesis and become lost in some blind alley of the great\r\nlabyrinth.\r\n\r\nCertain points appear to have once existed in common to nations on every\r\npart of the earth previous to authentic history, and in these America\r\nhad probably more or less her share, as appears from certain monuments\r\nand relics of her early races. They are as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. A worship of nature, based on the inscrutable mystery of generation\r\nwith birth and death. As these two extremes caused each other, they were\r\ncontinually _identified_ in the religious myth or symbol employed to\r\nrepresent either.\r\n\r\n2. This great principle of action, developing itself into birth and\r\ndeath, was regarded as being symbolized in every natural object, and\r\ncorresponding with these there were created myths, or 'stories,' setting\r\nforth the principal mystery of nature in a thousand poetic forms.\r\n\r\n3. The formula according to which all myths were shaped was that of\r\ntransition, or _the passing through_. The germ, in the mother or in the\r\nplant, which after its sleep reappeared in life, was also recognized in\r\nSpring, or Adonis, coming to light and warmth after the long death of\r\nwinter in the womb of the earth. The ark, which floats on the waters,\r\nbearing within it the regenerator, signified the same; so did the cup or\r\nhorn into which the wine of life was poured and from which it was drunk;\r\nso too did nuts, or any object capable of representing latent existence.\r\nThe passing into a cavern through a door between pillars or rocky\r\npasses, or even the wearing of rings, all intimated the same\r\nmystery--the going into and the coming forth into renewed life.\r\n\r\n4. But the great active principle which lay at the foundation of the\r\nmystery of birth and death, or of action, was set forth by the\r\nserpent--the type of good and evil, of life and destruction--the first\r\nintelligence. It is the constant recurrence of this symbol among the\r\nearly monuments of America, as of the Old World, which proves most\r\nconclusively the existence at one time of a common religion, or\r\n'cultus.' It was probably meant to signify water from its wavy curves,\r\nand the snake-like course of rivers, as inundation seems to have been,\r\naccording to early faith, the most prolific source of the destruction of\r\nnature, and yet the most active in its revival.\r\n\r\nThere are in Brittany vast lines of massy Druidic stones, piled\r\nsometimes for leagues in regular order, in such a manner as to represent\r\ncolossal serpents. Those who will consult the French _Dracontia_ will be\r\nastonished at the labor expended on these strange temples. Squier has\r\nshown that the earth-works of the West represent precisely the same\r\nsymbol. Mexico and South America abound, like Europe and the East, in\r\nserpent emblems; they twine around the gods; they are gods themselves;\r\nthey destroy as Typhon, and give life in the hands of Esculapius.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, as in Europe and in the East, there are found in\r\nsteep places, by difficult paths, always near the banks of streams,\r\nnarrow, much-worn passages in rocks, through which one person[J] can\r\nbarely squeeze, and which were evidently not intended for ordinary\r\ntravel. The passing through these places was enjoined on religious\r\nvotaries, as indicating respect for the great principle of regeneration.\r\nThe peasants of Europe, here and there, at the present day, continue to\r\npass through these rock or cave doors, 'for luck.' It was usual, after\r\nthe transition, whether into a cave, where mysteries, feasts, and orgies\r\nwere held, significant of 'the revival,' or merely through a narrow\r\nway,--to bathe in the invariably neighboring river; the serpent-river or\r\nwater which drowns organic life, yet without which it dies.\r\n\r\nIn England, at a comparatively recent period, and even yet occasionally\r\nin Scandinavia, the peasantry plighted their troth by passing their\r\nhands through the hole in the 'Odin-stones,' and clasping them. Beads\r\nand wedding rings and 'fairy-stones,' or those found with holes in them,\r\nwere all linked to the same faith which rendered sacred every\r\nresemblance to the 'passing through.' The graves of both North and\r\nSouth America contain abundant evidence of the sacredness in which the\r\nsame objects were held. I have a singularly-shaped soapstone ornament,\r\ntaken from an Indian grave, whose perforation indicates the\r\n'fairy-stone.' The religious legends of Mexico and of Peru are too\r\nidentical with many of the Old World to be passed over as coincidences;\r\nthe gold images of Chiriqui, with their Baal bell-ringing figures, and\r\nserpent-girt, pot-bellied phallic idols, are too strikingly like those\r\nof _Old_ Ireland and of the East not to suggest some far-away common\r\norigin. I have good authority for saying that almost every symbol,\r\nwhether of cup or dove, serpent or horn, flower or new moon, boat or\r\negg, common to Old World mythology, may be found set forth or preserved\r\nwith the emphasis of religious emblems in the graves or ruined temples\r\nof ancient North America.\r\n\r\nThe mass of evidence which has been accumulated by scholars illustrative\r\nof a common origin of mythologies and a centralization of them around\r\nthe serpent; or, as G.S. Faber will have it, the Ark; or, as some think,\r\nthe heavenly bodies; or, as others claim, simply a worship of paternity\r\nand maternity,--is immense. Why they should claim separate precedence\r\nfor symbols, all of which set forth the one great mystery how GOD\r\n'weaves and works in action's storm,' is only explicable on the ground\r\nthat 'every scholar likes to have his own private little pet\r\nhypothesis.' Enough, however, may be found to show that this stupendous\r\nnature-worship _was_ held the world over,--_possibly_ in the days of a\r\nsingle language,--in America as in ancient Italy, or around the sacred\r\nmountain-crags of India; in Lebanon as in Ireland, in the garden-lands\r\nof Assyria, and in the isles of the South.\r\n\r\nYet all this is as yet, for the truly scientific ethnologist, only\r\nhalf-fact, indefinite, belonging to the cloud-land of fable. The poet or\r\nthe thinker, yearning for a new basis of art, may find in the immense\r\nmass of legends and symbols an identification between all the forms of\r\nnature in a vast harmony and mutual reflection of every beautiful\r\nobject; but for the man of facts it is unformed, not arranged, useless.\r\nWe know not the color of the race or races which piled the Western\r\nmounds; their languages are lost; they are vague mist-gods, living in a\r\ndimmer medium than that of mere tradition. So ends the first period of\r\nintercommunication between Asia--the probable birthplace of the old\r\nmythology--and America.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE CHINESE DISCOVERERS OF MEXICO IN THE FIFTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nBut there is a second link, ere we come to the Norsemen, which is strong\r\nenough to merit the favorable consideration of the scientific man, for\r\nit rests on evidence worthy serious investigation. I refer to the fact\r\nthat the Chinese-Annals, or Year Books,--which, according to good\r\nauthority, have been well kept, and which are certainly prosaic and\r\nblue-bookish enough in their mass of dry details of embassies and\r\nexpenditures to be highly credible,--testify that in the fifth century\r\nthe Chinese learned the situation of the great peninsula Aliaska, which\r\nthey named Tahan, or Great China. Beyond this, at the end of the fifth\r\ncentury,--be it observed that the advances in discovery correspond in\r\ntime in the records,--they discovered a land which Deguignes long after\r\nidentified with the north-west coast of America. With each discovery,\r\nthe people of these new lands were compelled, or were represented at\r\ncourt as having been compelled, to send ambassadors wife tribute to the\r\nCentral Realm, or China.\r\n\r\nBut there had been unofficial Chinese travelers in Western America, and\r\neven in Mexico itself, before this time. Those who have examined the\r\nhistory of that vast religious movement of Asia which, contemporary with\r\nChristianity, shook the hoary faiths of the East, while a higher and\r\npurer doctrine was overturning those of the West, are aware that it had\r\nmany external points or forms in common with those of the later Roman\r\nchurch, which have long been a puzzle to the wise. To say nothing of\r\nmitres, tapers, violet robes, rosaries, bells, convents, auricular\r\nconfession, and many other singular identities, the early Buddhist\r\nchurch distinguished itself by a truly catholic zeal for the making of\r\nconverts, and, to effect this, sent its emissaries to Central Africa and\r\nCentral Russia; from the Sclavonian frontier on the west to China,\r\nJapan, and the farthest Russian isles of the east. On they went; who\r\nshall say where they paused? We know that there are at this day in St.\r\nPetersburg certain books on black paper taken from a Buddhist temple\r\nfound in a remote northern corner of Russia. It was much less of an\r\nundertaking, and much less singular, that Chinese priests should pass,\r\nby short voyages, from island to island, almost over the proposed\r\nRussian route for the Pacific telegraph to America. That they _did so_\r\nis explicitly stated in the Year Books, which contain details relative\r\nto _Fusang_, or Mexico, where it is said of the inhabitants that 'in\r\nearlier times these people lived not according to the laws of Buddha.\r\nBut it happened in the second \"year-naming\" \"Great Light\" of Song (A.D.\r\n458), that five beggar monks, from the kingdom Kipin, went to this land,\r\nextended over it the religion of Buddha, and with it his holy writings\r\nand images. They instructed the people in the principles of monastic\r\nlife, and so changed their manners.'\r\n\r\nBut I am anticipating my subject. In another chapter I propose, on the\r\nauthority of Professor Neumann, a learned Sinologist of Munich, to set\r\nforth the proofs that in the last year of the fifth century a Buddhist\r\npriest, bearing the cloister name of Hoei-schin, or Universal\r\nCompassion, returned from America, and gave for the first time an\r\nofficial account of the country which he had visited, which account was\r\nrecorded, and now remains as a simple fact among the annual registers of\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE SPUR OF MONMOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n  'Twas a little brass half-circlet,\r\n    Deep gnawed by rust and stain,\r\n  That the farmer's urchin brought me,\r\n    Plowed up on old Monmouth plain;\r\n  On that spot where the hot June sunshine\r\n    Once a fire more deadly knew,\r\n  And a bloodier color reddened\r\n    Where the red June roses blew;--\r\n\r\n  Where the moon of the early harvest\r\n    Looked down through the shimmering leaves,\r\n  And saw where the reaper of battle\r\n    Had gathered big human sheaves.\r\n  Old Monmouth, so touched with glory--\r\n    So tinted with burning shame--\r\n  As Washington's pride we remember,\r\n    Or Lee's long tarnished name.\r\n\r\n  'Twas a little brass half-circlet;\r\n    And knocking the rust away,\r\n  And clearing the ends and the middle\r\n    From their buried shroud of clay,\r\n  I saw, through the damp of ages\r\n    And the thick disfiguring grime,\r\n  The buckle-heads and the rowel\r\n    Of a spur of the olden time.\r\n\r\n  And I said--what gallant horseman,\r\n    Who revels and rides no more,\r\n  Perhaps twenty years back, or fifty,\r\n    On his heel that weapon wore?\r\n  Was he riding away to his bridal,\r\n    When the leather snapped in twain?\r\n  Was he thrown and dragged by the stirrup,\r\n    With the rough stones crushing his brain?\r\n\r\n  Then I thought of the Revolution,\r\n    Whose tide still onward rolls--\r\n  Of the free and the fearless riders\r\n    Of the 'times that tried men's souls.'\r\n  What if, in the day of battle\r\n    That raged and rioted here,\r\n  It had dropped from the foot of a soldier,\r\n    As he rode in his mad career?\r\n\r\n  What if it had ridden with Forman,\r\n    When he leaped through the open door,\r\n  With the British dragoon behind him,\r\n    In his race o'er the granary floor?\r\n  What if--but the brain grows dizzy\r\n    With the thoughts of the rusted spur;\r\n  What if it had fled with Clinton,\r\n    Or charged with Aaron Burr?\r\n\r\n  But bravely the farmer's urchin\r\n    Had been scraping the rust away;\r\n  And cleansed from the soil that swathed it,\r\n    The spur before me lay.\r\n  Here are holes in the outer circle--\r\n    No common heel it has known,\r\n  For each space, I see by the setting,\r\n    Once held some precious stone.\r\n\r\n  And here--not far from the buckle--\r\n    Do my eyes deceive their sight?--\r\n  Two letters are here engraven,\r\n    That initial a hero's might!\r\n  'G.W.'!

Then I will tell\r\nyou. In the coastwise part of the State of New Jersey in which I live,\r\nnumerous sounds and creeks everywhere divide and intersect the low,\r\nsea-skirting lands, wherein certain people are wont to cruise and delve\r\nfor the sake of securing their products, and hence come to be known in\r\nour homely style as Soundsers. The fruitage afforded by these sounds is\r\nboth manifold and of price. Throughout all the pleasant weather, they\r\nyield, with but little intermission, that gastronomic gem, the terrapin;\r\nthe succulent, hard-shell clam, and the 'soft' crab; the deep-lurking,\r\nsnowy-fleshed hake, or king-fish; the huge, bell-voiced drum, and that\r\nsheen-banded pride of American salt-water fishes, the sheepshead. During\r\nthe waning weeks of May, and also with the continuance of dog-days, this\r\nalready profuse bounty receives a goodly accession in the shape of vast\r\nflocks of willets, curlews, gray-backs, and other marine birds, which,\r\nwith every ebb tide, resort to their shoaler bars and flats, to take on\r\nthose layers of fat which the similarly well-conditioned old gentleman\r\nof the city finds so inexpressibly delicious. When the summer is once,\r\nover, and while the cold weather prevails, they furnish another and\r\nquite new set of dainties. Then the span-long, ripe, 'salt' oyster is to\r\nbe had for the raking of their more solidly-bottomed basins; and all\r\nalong their more retired nooks and harbors, the gunner, by taking proper\r\nprecautions, may bring to bag the somewhat 'sedgy' but still\r\nwell-flavored black duck, the tender widgeon, the buttery little\r\nbufflehead, the incomparable canvas-back, and the loud-shrieking,\r\nsharp-eyed wild goose. All this various booty is industriously secured\r\nby the 'soundsers,' to find, ere long, a ready market in the larger\r\ninland towns and cities. But united to this shooting, fishing, and\r\noyster-catching, they have another 'trade' whose scene is on the waters,\r\nthough it connects itself with the sea, rather than the sounds, and\r\n_this_ is 'wrecking.' They are prompt for this service whenever the\r\noccasion requires; indeed, I sometimes think they prefer it, dangerous\r\nthough it be, before all others. Inured as they are to every sort of\r\nexposure, they are of course a tough and rugged race; and what with\r\ntheir diversity of occupation, calling, as it does, for a constant\r\ninterchange of the use of the gun, net, boat, fishing line, and some one\r\nor other arm or edge tool, they are usually, nay, almost invariably,\r\nhandy and quick-witted.\r\n\r\nBy far the most notable 'soundser' our neighborhood ever bred was my\r\nhero, BILL. Physically, at least, he was a true wonder. He stood full\r\nsix feet two, weighed eleven score pounds, and at the same time carried\r\nno more flesh than sufficed to hide the exact outline of his bones.\r\nAnother man so strong as he I have never seen. I have repeatedly known\r\nhim to lift and walk off with anchors weighing five and six hundred\r\nweight; and those big, thick hands of his could twist any horseshoe as\r\nif it were a girl's wreath. Certainly he was not in the least graceful;\r\nthat 'ponderosity' of his could in no way be repressed. But he was still\r\nof rude comeliness, his shape being squarely fitted and tolerably\r\nproportioned, while his broad, red-maned visage wore a constant glow of\r\nplain, though sincere, kindliness and good-humor.\r\n\r\nAs his physical man was uncommon, so he had uncommon mental endowments.\r\nHe was the only 'soundser' I ever knew who understood farming. He had\r\ninherited a farmstead of some twenty-five or thirty acres, and this he\r\nsoon had blooming as the rose. When occasion required, he wrought on\r\nit, day and night. He divided it, with truest judgment, into proper\r\nfields, experimented successfully with various kinds of novel manures\r\n(most of which he obtained from the sea), grew stock, planted, in\r\nrotation, and, with only here and there a sympathizer, gave in his full\r\nadherence to the theory of root culture. And he was a mechanic. He could\r\nbuild house or barn to the last beam, and ship or boat to the last\r\njoint; nay, he once devised the model of a self-righting life-boat,\r\nwhich I have often heard shipmasters, and even real shipwrights, descant\r\nupon in the highest terms of praise. Moreover, I can affirm that he was\r\na navigator. It is true that the _science_ of seamanship, as set forth\r\nin books, he had never mastered. But he knew right well what winds of a\r\ncertain force and direction foretold, what waves of a certain height and\r\naspect meant; and this knowledge, combined with a squint, now and then,\r\nat his pocket compass, sufficed to enable him to take a vessel with\r\nsafety anywhere along our coast.\r\n\r\nBut while my old pal showed high abilities in other arts, as a\r\n'soundser' and wrecker he was not to be matched. He brought to the first\r\nof these pursuits a clearness of observation which would have met the\r\napprobation of many an acknowledged man of science. He knew every sort\r\nof food which bird and fish fed upon, where it was to be found, and the\r\ncircumstances favorable to its production. He knew why the game resorted\r\nto certain spots yesterday, and avoided them to-day; what\r\ncircumstances--and they are very many--impelled it to joyousness or\r\nquietude; and what were most of its minor instincts. And all this was\r\ndone _thoroughly_, withal. There was no haphazard or uncertainty in any\r\nof his conclusions. Taking thought of sundry conditions, he could tell\r\nat any time when such a thing was applicable; how many sheepsheads one\r\ncould catch in the sounds; whether the _honk_ of the wild goose, flying\r\noverhead, announced that he was on his way to a fresh-water pool or a\r\nbar of gravel; whether the black ducks were cooling their thirsty\r\ngizzards in a woodland pond, sitting scattered about the marshes, or\r\nhuddling together on the bosom of the sea. In a word, his mind had\r\ngathered unto itself every law, of the least importance, affecting the\r\nexistence of such wild creatures about us as cost any pains to bring to\r\nhand; and thus he was literally master over them, and held their lives\r\nsubject to his will. That this power was really surprising, will hardly\r\nbe disputed; and since we, his associates, could in no way possess\r\nourselves of the like, it passed among us for something almost\r\nmiraculous.\r\n\r\nStill, brilliant 'soundser' as old Bill was, he was far greater as a\r\nwrecker; since I am now about to relate an occurrence in the line which\r\nproves him a veritable hero. As is perfectly well known, our American\r\ncoast is often the scene of fearful storms, which deal out wide-spread\r\ndestruction to mariners. With us, these gales are commonest in February,\r\nand hence this month is held in marked dread. Some years ago, in the\r\nseason referred to, a storm burst upon our shores, whose like only a few\r\nof the older among us had ever known. After fitfully moaning from the\r\nnorthward and eastward for a day or two, the wind, one morning, finally\r\nsettled due north-east,--thus sweeping directly upon the land,--and blew\r\na hurricane. It was excessively cold, too, yet not so cold but that a\r\nfine, dry snow was falling, though from the fury of the wind this could\r\nsettle nowhere, but was driven, whirling and surging, before the blast\r\nin dense clouds. In short, it was a time of truly unearthly wildness;\r\nand our hearts sank the deeper in us, since we knew what ere long must\r\ninevitably occur. At last, within an hour or two of nightfall, the sound\r\nof a ship's bell, rung hurriedly, pealed towards us along the uproar of\r\nthe tempest, and by this we were made aware that a vessel had been\r\nwrecked on a certain shoal rising up in the ocean, about two miles from\r\nthat part of the beach nearest our village. To go to the rescue of this\r\nvessel, at this time, was absolutely impossible. For, to say nothing of\r\nthe wrath of the winds, the air was so thick with snow that, in the\r\nspeedily advancing hours of darkness, in which we should not fail to be\r\nentrapped, we would be powerless to find our way at sea a foot. There\r\nwas no help for it; the poor victims of the shipwreck must that very\r\nnight know death in one or another most terrifying shape, 'if it was the\r\nwill of the Lord.' With this mournful conviction, about twenty of us\r\ngathered at old Bill's house with the closing in of a darkness as of\r\nTartarus, and kept its watches. The anger of the storm abated in no way\r\nwhatever till morning, and then the sole change that took place was a\r\nsomewhat thinner aspect of the driving snow. Yet, even when this was\r\ndiscerned, every man of us hastened to draw over his ordinary winter\r\ngarb an oil-cloth suit which enveloped him from head to foot, and\r\nsoberly announced himself ready to do his duty in the strait. That we\r\nshould be exposed to the greatest dangers was absolutely certain; and\r\nwhether a single survivor of the terrors of that awful night yet clung\r\nto the few frail timbers in the sea, for us to rescue, none but Heaven\r\nknew; still, the manhood of each demanded that what was possible to be\r\ndone in the matter we should at least attempt.\r\n\r\nAnd so we started; the leader being old Bill, who to some end, that I\r\ncould not then divine, bore a boat-sail bundled on his back. Our first\r\nbusiness was to make way to our surf or life boat. This lay about three\r\nmiles from the village, reckoning as the crow flies, and was sheltered\r\nunder a rude house which stood on the shores of a bay opening by an\r\ninlet into the sea. Our common way of gaining this house was through a\r\ncircuitous passage of the sounds; but these we soon discovered, in\r\nconsonance with a previous prediction of old Bill's, were entirely\r\nfrozen over save in certain parts of their channels; and hence, this\r\nroute being unnavigable for such boats as were at hand, which, without\r\nexception, were light gunning and fishing skiffs, we were forced to\r\navail ourselves of a barely practicable land track of which we knew, and\r\nwhich, as it led about among the marshes, was also circuitous. And the\r\nnecessity of choosing this land path added to our difficulties, in that\r\nwe were forced to provide ourselves with a small batteau and drag it\r\nbehind us, to be able to cross many ditches and sloughs with which it\r\nwas barred, and which, particularly along their edges, were never really\r\nfrozen. After toiling and battling for a long period, and at the same\r\ntime having to face the most painfully cutting wind that burst\r\nunobstructedly over the level area of the marshes, we at last reached\r\nthe house wherein the life-boat lay, and when old Bill had scrutinized\r\nits oars, and stored it with a mingled collection of cordage, canvas and\r\nspars, we ran it into the water. But now another trouble arose. The bay,\r\nlike the sounds of which indeed it formed a part, was covered with\r\nice,--either in solid sheets, or that thick slush, peculiar to ocean\r\nestuaries, which is chiefly known as 'porridge ice,'--and, from its\r\ncomparative shallowness, covered so densely, too, that if we had trusted\r\nto getting our boat out of it by sheer rowing, it would have taken us\r\nthe entire day so to do. In this emergency nothing would serve but that\r\nwe must advance bodily into the water, and, crushing and clearing away\r\nthe ice with our feet, drag the boat, in a depth at least sufficient for\r\nher to float, to the entrance of the inlet, where the current ran so\r\nstrongly that no ice could gather. After a severely trying amount of\r\nlabor, this point was finally gained, and we stood fairly in front of\r\nthe tall, thundering breakers; whereupon each man nimbly jumped to his\r\nplace in the craft, that of steersman being the post of old Bill.\r\n\r\nAs we gave way on our oars, we shot along the inlet without much\r\ndifficulty; and presently old Bill announced that, he caught a faint\r\nsight of the wreck in the distance--to all appearance 'most all gone but\r\nthe hull.' But we had little or no opportunity to indulge in speculation\r\nor remark on the discovery, for in a moment or two we began to oppose\r\nthe wildness of the open main, and the hour of our real trial set in.\r\nFor the first time we could now appreciate the full force of the gale.\r\nGood Heavens, how it blew! The waters seemed alive and in direst\r\nconvulsion. Everywhere huge walls of breakers were constantly upheaved\r\nto be felled and shattered with a roar as of some terrific cannonade;\r\nwhile the air became the arena for a helter-skelter tossing of sheets of\r\nspray, clots of froth, and spirts of brine, which plentifully assailed\r\nour poor boat in their madness, and, besides partially filling her with\r\nslush, encased every man in a complete coating of ice. If our craft had\r\nnot been modeled with the very highest degree of skill, and if our\r\nsteersman had not been one of a thousand, we could have made no headway\r\nat all in this appalling tumult. As it was, our advance was of the\r\nweakest, and its success seemed very doubtful, let our efforts be what\r\nthey might. Not but what we could sufficiently hold our own in the swirl\r\nof the vanquished waves; but when they swooped upon us in their full\r\nstature, they not only sent the boat back as if she had been a mere\r\nfeather, but with a second's awkwardness on the part of old Bill they\r\nwould have flung her clean over from stem to stern, and our places among\r\nthe living would have been vacant. Having strained every nerve for\r\nnearly two hours, we were still but part way through the breakers, while\r\nsome of the men began to complain of fatigue; with which old Bill seized\r\na favorable opportunity to put the boat about, and we were swept ashore\r\non the beach as in the twinkling of an eye. Here, we secured our boat by\r\nhauling her high and dry on the strand; freed her from the slush and\r\nwater which had gained in her bottom; and then retired to the leeward of\r\na range of sand hills near by, to recruit our energies.\r\n\r\nWith full leisure to ponder over the difficulties confronting our\r\nexpedition, some few of the crew now began to 'speak it foully,' and\r\neven to emit gruff proposals to return homewards. But to these waverers\r\nold Bill at once administered the sternest rebuke; and, as they at last\r\nheld their peace, he averred with a gay smile (for he dearly loved the\r\npresence of danger, and could never be brought to look on it other than\r\nas a rough sort of irresponsible horse-play, over which he was sure in\r\none way or another to gain the mastery), that he had now weighed all the\r\nconditions of the pass, and that the next time we attempted it we should\r\nassuredly prevail. This assertion, coming from such a source, encouraged\r\none and all very greatly; and ere long we cheerfully launched our boat\r\nonce more, and again began to tug at the quivering oars. In a very\r\nlittle while it became apparent enough that the tactics that Bill\r\nintended to adopt in our present venture were very different from those\r\nput in practice with the last. Instead of boldly facing the breakers as\r\nhe had heretofore done, he now began his maneuvering by laying us\r\ndirectly in the trough of the sea,--planting the boat a little\r\ncrosswise, however, so as to prevent an untoward swell from riding over\r\nher side and thus filling her,--and the instant he saw an advancing\r\nbreaker beginning to fracture, as a prelude to its downfall and\r\ndestruction, he boldly sped us, when the thing was at all practicable,\r\nstraight in the teeth of the gap, and as it proceeded to widen, we shot\r\nthrough it, with the surf leaping and tossing on either hand high above\r\nour heads. This stroke could have been possible only to a steersman\r\npossessed of herculean strength, combined with the rarest daring and\r\ncoolness; and, as the result of these qualities, it was exceedingly\r\neffective. It lessened the danger of our being capsized almost entirely.\r\nIndeed, the sole mishap that was threatened by so doing, was the\r\nliability to being swamped by the falling fragments of the breakers;\r\nbut this peril old Bill declared we might safely trust he would also\r\navert. It being the nature of humanity to experience a mood of high\r\nexaltation with the surmounting of any serious obstacle, we now worked\r\nour way with minds light and cheery, and with all thoughts of anything\r\nlike fatigue completely forgotten. Though our course was on the whole a\r\nzigzag one, and though we certainly met with one or two serious rebuffs,\r\nwe were constantly gaining headway, and in something over an hour forced\r\nthe last line of the breakers, and stemmed what on ordinary occasions\r\nwould have been simply the blue body of the Atlantic. But even here a\r\nhuge commotion was reigning, though our progress was far less tedious\r\nthan it had previously been; and with about another hour's labor we were\r\nalongside the wreck, and had climbed to her deck.\r\n\r\nThe plight of the vessel was mournful enough. She had evidently been\r\nbuilt for a three-masted schooner, but, as Bill had observed when he\r\nfirst obtained a view of her, everything about her was well-nigh gone\r\nsave her hull. Her bulwarks had been thoroughly crushed, and so the sea\r\nhad successively torn away her boats, shivered her galley and\r\nwheelhouse, and filled her cabin and hold. Her masts were also\r\ndestroyed, the fore and mizzen masts being carried away from their\r\nsteppings, and the main-mast broken completely in twain just above the\r\ncross-trees. But a sight still more desolate, as well as harrowing, yet\r\nawaited us, as, in overhauling the sail-encumbered shrouds of the\r\npartially standing mast, we discovered several ice-bound figures rigidly\r\nhanging therein, which, being cut away and lowered to our boat, proved\r\nto be the body of a negro perfectly stark and dead, and three most\r\npitiable white sailors, whose life was so far extinguished that they\r\ncould neither move hand nor foot, nor utter more than the feeblest\r\nmoans.\r\n\r\nWhen we had covered the face of the dead and sheltered the well-nigh\r\ndead as best we could in the bottom of our boat, of course our chief\r\nthought was to return to the shore as swiftly as possible. But on this\r\nhead there was no call to entertain the smallest solicitude; for after\r\nold Bill, from a motive that we could not yet name, had 'stepped' a mast\r\nthrough one of the foremost thwarts of the boat, and rigged a sail all\r\nready to be spread, we cast off from the wreck, and presently, dropping\r\ninto the full strength of the wind, were swept onward like an arrow,\r\nwith scarce the least use of any other oar than that in the hands of our\r\nstalwart steersman. Speedily crossing the outer waters, we leaped and\r\nbounded over the breakers; and when old Bill, as we were rushing along\r\nthe inlet, gave orders for the hoisting of the sail, we not only\r\nhastened to obey him, but immediately saw an all-important reason for\r\nthe command. For we were now about entering the ice of the sounds; and\r\nas the boat flew in its midst, her stiff, tight sail drove her through\r\nthe stubborn obstruction as easily and in much the same manner as the\r\nsteam plow rips up the matted bosom of the prairies. In due season we\r\nreached the landing where we usually disembarked from the sounds, and\r\nwhere we found a wagon awaiting us, to which we bore our sad freightage,\r\nand led the way for old Bill's house. On arriving, we laid the corpse in\r\nan outbuilding and carried the sailors into a bedroom. But what was to\r\nbe next done? To tell the truth, most of us knew no more than so many\r\nchildren. But here our leader again showed his knowledge. Strongly\r\ncondemning the lighting of a fire in the apartment,--which some one was\r\nabout to do,--he set us busily at work bringing him a good supply of\r\ntubs, and buckets of cold water, into which he dipped the naked persons\r\nof the sufferers; and as this treatment, combined with a patient, gentle\r\nchafing, which was also administered, at last restored the flow of their\r\nvital forces, he gave them a few spoonfuls of broth apiece, and, while\r\nthey looked a gratefulness they could nowise express, lifted them like\r\nbabes with his giant arms to warm beds, where they fell into what was\r\nat first a fitful, broken slumber, but finally a childlike, placid\r\nsleep. They were saved!\r\n\r\nIf the reader is now curious to know why a man like old Bill was not a\r\npatrician and captain in the campaign of life, rather than the mere\r\nprivate and plebeian he was, I can answer that there were several things\r\nwhich impeded that consummation. His character, though of wonderful\r\nheight and force in some respects, was, after all, without true\r\ndiscipline, and presented many glaring incongruities. Thus, whatever he\r\nhad of what could really be named ambition was satisfied when he had\r\nsurprised us 'soundsers;' and our praise--and we lavished it upon him in\r\nfull measure, as we knew he liked it--was all the praise he seemed to\r\ndesire. Then, he was altogether one of us in his notions of pleasure and\r\nrecreation. Like the rest of us, he cordially appreciated the sparkling\r\nproduct of the New England distilleries, and far more than any of us--to\r\nsuch a pitch did his animal spirits rule--he relished our broad sea-side\r\njokes and songs, and as well our rattling jigs and hornpipes. As for\r\nothers attempting to elevate him to a more exalted station, the thing\r\nwas simply impossible. When led of his own accord to seek other society\r\nthan ours, he could by no means content himself with the companionship\r\nof staid practical persons, who on account of his latent worth would\r\nhave readily countenanced, and with the least opportunity even served\r\nhim, but he invariably paid his court to adventurers; such creatures,\r\nfor instance, as seedy 'professors' of one kind or another, who, in the\r\ninevitable shawl and threadbare suit of black, were constantly\r\ndismounting at the village tavern, with proposals either to 'lecture' on\r\nsomething, or 'teach' somewhat, as the case might happen to be, and who,\r\nhaving no affinity whatever with the brawny, awkward Viking who fondly\r\nhung on their shabby-genteel skirts, amused themselves at his greenness,\r\nor pooh-pooh'd him altogether, as they saw fit. And when, as it not\r\nunfrequently happened, official and influential individuals at a\r\ndistance were moved by the story of his renown to pay him their respects\r\nin person, and listen courteously and gravely to his opinions, his\r\ndiscrimination stood him in no better stead, for as soon as he possibly\r\ncould he bent the conference towards a sailor's revel, and astonished\r\nhis stately visitants by singing the spiciest songs, and sometimes even\r\nby a Terpsichorean display in full costume; for he was excessively proud\r\nof his accomplishments in this line, and implicitly believed that the\r\nshaking of his elephantine limbs, and the whirling of his broad,\r\ncoatless flanks, formed a spectacle so tasteful and entertaining, that\r\nno one could fail to enjoy it to the utmost. Assuredly I have now said\r\nenough as to old Bill's incapacities for a grander role in life. In\r\nreality that part of a lofty manhood to which he at first sight seemed\r\nfitted, was not his; for, properly speaking, he was not an actual man,\r\nbut a boy--a grand and glorious boy, if you will, but yet a very boy;\r\nand at length he met the fate of a boy, as we shall learn.\r\n\r\nOnce more we were engaged upon a wreck. But this time it was in no\r\nhyperborean tempest that we were called forth, but when the very\r\nsweetest airs of June were blowing. The case demanding our aid was that\r\nof a wrecking schooner which had gaily left her moorings in New York\r\nharbor to pick up a summer's living along the coast, but had\r\ninadvertently cut up some of her capers rather too near our beach, and\r\nso with one fine ebb tide found herself stranded. As it was an instance\r\nof sickness in the regularly graduated and scientific college itself,\r\nour whole shore was intensely 'tickled' at the accident. And again, as\r\nthis doctress, like many another ailing leech, was quite incapable of\r\ncuring her own suffering, her toddy-blossom-faced bully of a New York\r\ncaptain was pleased to salute old Bill with cup high in air, and beg\r\nthat he would take a sufficient force and heave the distressed craft\r\ninto deep water. Thus a crew of us were called together and set to work\r\nat the vessel. As the weather was so warm and beautiful, and as bed and\r\nboard were at this time to be had on the beach, we agreed among us that\r\nour convenience would be the better served by taking up our temporary\r\nquarters near the scene of our labors. Now, the place where we were\r\noffered the necessary accommodation consisted of an ancient plank-built\r\ntenement, which stood behind a sand-ridge that a far younger Atlantic\r\nthan ours had piled up, and then, retreating, abandoned. In winter this\r\nrude domicile was bare and tenantless; but in the summer months it was\r\nusually occupied by some thriftless gammer or gaffer from the main-land,\r\nwho, having stocked it with a few of the coarsest household goods, and\r\nwhatever provisions came to hand, offered entertainment to such wreckers\r\nand 'soundsers' as happened to be in its vicinity. The present incumbent\r\nof the hostel was a woman, claiming to be a widow, of the name of Rose;\r\nbearing in most respects no resemblance whatever to any of her\r\npredecessors. Where she was born, or had hitherto resided, none of us\r\nknew: all that gossip could, gather was that she had unexpectedly\r\ndescended from a passing vessel with her effects and entered directly\r\nthe abandoned house. When questioned as to the scene of her earlier\r\nlife, she vaguely gave answer that she had disported herself largely in\r\n'Philadelphy;' but as no 'Philadelphy' woman that ever walked through a\r\ndoorway was or is able to compound a chowder or bake a clam pie worthy\r\nof the name, and as Madame Rose understood how to prepare both these\r\nluxuries to a charm, her statement must have been false; she was,\r\nundoubtedly, a 'coast-wise' lady, and one who knew who Jack was as well\r\nas he himself did. Her appearance was, on the whole, agreeable. She was\r\ntall, slender, of regular features, and, though indisputably on the\r\nshady side of forty, was still free from any signs that would proclaim\r\nher charms to be on the wane. I remember in particular that she had\r\nlong, white and regular teeth, thereby strongly contrasting with our\r\nnative women, who as a rule lose their teeth early. Her manners were\r\nvery novel to us. She was invariably of a simpering, ducking turn, and\r\ninterlarded her curt speech with curiously hard words. In dress she\r\ncarried matters with an incomparably high hand. She wore hoops 'all day\r\nlong,'--a freak then never even so much as thought of in our\r\nvillage,--adorned her fingers with many rings, and her throat with large\r\nflorid brooches, and in the evening, after having brought her household\r\nduties to a close, sat here or there with her sewing, in silks (though\r\nperhaps not of the newest), or other highly-civilized stuffs.\r\n\r\nMost of our crew regarded their hostess with greatly mingled feelings;\r\nbut old Bill entertained but one sentiment for her,--that of unqualified\r\nadmiration. As we only 'wrought' at the stranded schooner on the high\r\nwater,--some five hours out of the twenty-four,--he had plenty of\r\nopportunity to dangle after his dearie, and did so unremittingly. While\r\nthe rest of us were either napping, dancing the lively 'straight four,'\r\nhunting herns' eggs among the sand-hills, and so on, according to our\r\ninclination, he, in far more romantic mood, seized all possible\r\nopportunities to quickly gather fire-wood for his charmer, fill her\r\ntea-kettle, open whatever clams and oysters she was about to cook, and,\r\nabove all, to recount for her delight one of those inimitable yarns of\r\nhis, at whose points he himself was sure to laugh till the rafters of\r\nthe house shook and the plates in the dresser rattled again. But this\r\nwas merely the first stage of his passion. Before long, as is not\r\nunusual in such cases, it took another and more bodeful turn. That\r\ninextinguishable laughter of his was heard no more, or at best gave\r\nplace to a feeble tittering; his stories dropped from his lips with but\r\nflat pungency; and instead of performing his lady-love's 'chores' with a\r\nmirthful readiness, he went through them in a heartsick way, the while\r\ndirecting towards her furtive looks of supplication. The true state of\r\nmatters was now obvious to all Old Bill was another fatally-stricken\r\nvictim of that spooney archer-boy who next to death holds dominion over\r\nmen; and with his case, thus momentous, we could but feel a renewed\r\ninterest in his behalf, and busy our tongues about him. I, for my part,\r\nthought that as he was a widower, and needful of a wife to comfort him\r\nin his advancing age, and that as the present object of his affections,\r\nif not a highly 'forcible' woman, seemed at all events to be one of whom\r\nno great harm was to be feared, there could be no valid objection to his\r\nbeing joined to her; particularly if nothing was divulged proving her to\r\nbe other than what she seemed. But this view I found to be on the whole\r\nunacceptable to my auditory. Almost to a man they condemned the\r\npropriety of the match. It could not actually be said that they disliked\r\nMrs. Hose, but they were jealous of her, as, in her manner and style of\r\narray, she considerably dimmed the lustre of their own women; and they\r\ndistrusted her as she was a stranger; it being a marked habit with most\r\nof our folks to distrust all strangers save those from whom they expect\r\npecuniary awards. But meanwhile, notwithstanding this criticism, the\r\nlittle idyl in our midst was developing itself apace. On the afternoon\r\nof one beautiful Sunday, a day in which we of course ordinarily did no\r\nwork, when the dinner-table had been well cleared away, what should we\r\nsee but old Bill swinging forth with his sailor gait from the house, and\r\narrayed as jauntily as his check shirt and pea-jacket (his only suit of\r\napparel at hand) would permit, to be speedily followed by Mrs. Rose, who\r\nwith one set of finger-tips held up the light folds of a sweetly blue\r\nlawn skirt, and with the other bore aslant before her a bewitching pink\r\nparasol. Undoubtedly there was a great indulgence in sly winks and\r\nsuppressed titterings on the part of such of us as chanced to be\r\nwitnesses of this at once festal and sentimental sally; but the twain\r\nheeded naught whatsoever of these manifestations, but struck off along\r\nthe snow-white strand where the sea was droning its hymn so lazily that\r\nit would have inevitably put itself to sleep, if the fish-hawks had not\r\nso continually disturbed it by mischievously diving headlong into its\r\nbosom. At last they returned again; and we soon became aware that the\r\nstroll had not been without great results to both; since Mrs. Rose\r\naffected to be laboring under a high degree of emotion, and retired to\r\nthe privacy of her apartment, while old Bill was by no means the\r\ndolorous swain of a few hours before, but, making his way among us, with\r\nhis wide mouth stretching its best, proceeded formally to shake hands\r\nwith one and all as though he had finally got back from a long and\r\narduous voyage; and then, merrily calling for a certain brown jug which\r\nwas among our stores, removed the corn-cob which served as a cork, and\r\nhaving wetted his great heart with a draught which I have no doubt\r\nmeasured a full pint, fell, entirely regardless of the day, to\r\nperforming his most spirited hoe-down, while the most of us looked on\r\nwith a mirth that knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nYes, old Bill was now 'a happy man,' Mrs. Rose could but accept such a\r\nsuitor as he, if but from the fact that; his ardor and his pain were of\r\nthe freshest complexion, and of an amplitude fully proportioned to that\r\nof his extraordinary physical bulk. As we tendered him our\r\ncongratulations upon his happy state, he received the courtesy with\r\nextreme complacency. But, to tell the truth, those who did thus\r\ncongratulate him were but few. Most of the men remained of their old\r\nmind as to the proposed match; indeed, I ere long found that they looked\r\nupon it with less favor than ever. It appeared that they had been\r\ninflamed with a rumor that Mrs. Rose intended to beguile her adorer to a\r\nforeign shore, where a scion or two of her brilliant house found happy\r\nsustenance; and that nothing but evil could accrue from such an act, was\r\nof course as clear as noonday. Now, when I came to trace this rumor to\r\nits source, I became apprised that it owed its publicity to an old man\r\nof our number known by the nickname of 'Mister,' who was remarkable for\r\na rare amount of credulity, self-conceit, and obstinacy, and at the same\r\ntime for being the invariable butt of his company. This wiseacre averred\r\nthat he had succeeded in wringing from Mrs. Rose the confession that\r\ndirectly she and old Bill were made man and wife, they were to depart\r\nfor Hatteras Inlet, on the coast of North Carolina, where the lady gay\r\npossessed 'relations;' and this narrative, wofully muttered about among\r\nour crew, and accompanied with a due amount of sighs and head-shakings,\r\nhad depressed them most fearfully, not withstanding the character of the\r\nnarrator.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter was, that most of the men were actually desirous\r\nthat a betrothal, contracted directly in the face of public opinion, and\r\nwithout the smallest deference to anybody, as that of old Bill and Mrs.\r\nRose had been, should come to some kind of grief or other, and they were\r\nfain to believe that it would do so. As for me, I was without true\r\nconcern on the subject, as I had ever been. If it should indeed fall out\r\nthat old Bill was to take a trip to Hatteras with his bride, I was\r\nconvinced that he would enjoy himself famously among the great abundance\r\nof fish and game said to abound in that place, and that in the end he\r\nwould return to us again, to rule over us in greater splendor than ever;\r\nas for his sweetheart or any of her like doing him any actual injury,\r\nthe idea seemed so preposterous to me, that whenever an opportunity\r\npresented itself I did not fail to ridicule it to the utmost. Still, in\r\norder to do my whole duty in the matter, I hastened to impress old Bill\r\nwith the importance of his becoming acquainted with the antecedents of\r\nhis lady-love, and thus saving himself from the possibility of a\r\nmisstep. But this counsel did no farther good than to bring a clouded\r\nbrow to my dear old friend, and so I did not persist in it. Indeed, we\r\ncommuned together but little more in any way; for very shortly after he\r\nresigned his place as our 'boss,' and left post-haste for the main-land.\r\nHere, as was revealed to me in due season, he amazed the neighborhood by\r\nincontinently renting his farmstead to a son with whom he had been on\r\nindifferent terms for years; dispatching his daughter, who had\r\nheretofore acted as his housekeeper, off to a distant town to become an\r\napprentice to a milliner's trade; and stowing his clothes and a shot-bag\r\nof hard money which he was known to possess into a sailor's chest, with\r\nwhich, together with his gun and a Methodist preacher, he again hurried\r\noff for the asylum of his beloved. Arrived once more in the witching\r\npresence, he waited till evening (yet how he was constrained so to do is\r\nmore than I can tell), and then, as we made it a duty to be gathered\r\nabout him once more, the wedding took place.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was one of such interest, that the preacher could but make\r\nthe most of it. After the nuptial benediction had been pronounced, he\r\nstraightway launched forth into a homily of such graciousness and force,\r\nthat but few of us missed being forcibly wrought upon, while Mrs. Rose\r\nwas stirred apparently to the depths of her being. On the day succeeding\r\nthe marriage, our light-hearted Benedict abandoned himself to another\r\njollification. But the next morning, a schooner headed in towards the\r\nbeach, and, slackening the peaks of her sails, sent ashore a yawl, whose\r\ncrew saluted Mrs. Rose as an old and familiar friend, and with whose\r\napparition, without the least regard as to what shift we wreckers were\r\nto make, a great packing was begun in the house. Bedsteads were taken\r\ndown, beds were bundled up in sheets, crockery was thrust away in\r\nbarrels, and all borne one after the other to the yawl, where the bride,\r\nwith her potent parasol full spread, and pretending to shudder at the\r\nsight of the gently heaving breakers through which she was soon to pass,\r\nmincingly threw herself in the thick of the luggage, and old Bill\r\nmounted the stern, with his huge palm extended for a good-by shake.\r\n'Good-by, old chap,' said I, as I took his hand the last of all,\r\n'good-by! You're not half mean enough to stay away from us forever; so\r\nin the meantime do your best to show the Hatteras boys what a nice thing\r\nit is to be somebody in the world!' And thus the boat put off, and,\r\nreaching the schooner in a few moments, was hoisted to her decks. In a\r\nfew moments more the vessel had reset her sails, and, with a free wind,\r\nbore straight to the southward out of sight.\r\n\r\nNow comes the singular part of my story. In a few weeks from the time of\r\ntheir sailing, we heard that old Bill and his wife had safely landed at\r\nHatteras Inlet, and rented a small house on one of the beaches there,\r\nwith the intention of opening a kind of tavern; but no sooner were they\r\nfairly settled in their new abode than old Bill was found one morning\r\n_dead in his bed_, with evident signs of having met with foul play;\r\nthough what kind of death these indications pointed at was very\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nThe closest and shrewdest investigation failed to attach a well-grounded\r\nsuspicion to any one. Poor Bill was dead--and nothing more was ever\r\nknown. Singular enough, the conduct of his widow was such as to entirely\r\navert even from her enemies hints of complicity in the crime,--if crime\r\nthere was,--though none doubted that there had been a murder, and that\r\nmurder in a few attendant circumstances seemed to indicate female aid.\r\nShortly after this catastrophe, Madame Rose made 'a vendue' of her\r\ndeceased husband's gun and apparel, packed up her own worldly goods, and\r\nvanished, to be heard of no more.\r\n\r\nAnd so our shore lost its best 'soundser'--a man of mark in his way,\r\ngreat of frame and heart, and one long to be recalled in our humble\r\nannals of wrecking and of sport. He was one of those vigorous\r\nout-croppings of sturdy Northern physique recalling in minute detail the\r\nstories told of those giant children, the Vikings and Goths of the\r\nfighting ages, and which the blood, though as healthy as ever,--witness\r\nthe glorious exploits of our soldiers even as I write,--produces less\r\nfrequently in these days of culture. Such as I have described was the\r\ncharacter of Bill the Soundser, and such was literally and truly his\r\nmysterious death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA TO BRITANNIA.\r\n\r\nVIA SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Thou cold-blooded slave,\r\n  Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side?\r\n  Been sworn my soldier? bidding me depend\r\n  Upon thy stars, thy fortune, and thy strength?\r\n  And dost thou now fall over to my foes,\r\n  And wear a lion's hide? Doff it for shame,\r\n  And hang a calf's skin on those recreant limbs.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN, III. 1.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERAL LYON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-day all the Northland shouts for joy, flashes its announcements of\r\nvictory along myriad leagues of wire, hurls them from grim cannon mouths\r\nout over broad bays till the seas tremble with sympathy, huzzas in the\r\nstreets, flames in bonfires, would even clash the clouds together and\r\nstreak the heavens with lightning--and for what? The flag waves again in\r\nGeorgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, and the cause is safe! _The\r\ncause_--have we all learned what that means, brother Americans?\r\nSomething broader than mere Union, the pass-word of so many thousands to\r\nsuffering and death, something more than the freedom of the press and\r\nthe ballot-box. It means Progress; and until we acknowledge this, all\r\nfreedom is a vast injustice, luring men on to Beulahs which Fate--the\r\nfate they worship--will never have them reach. It would be little enough\r\nto regain our foothold upon Southern territory, or repossess Southern\r\nforts, even if forts and territory have been wrested from us by treason\r\nand perjury, if with every mile of advance we did not gain a stronghold\r\nof principle. We are not straining every nerve, struggling under immense\r\nfinancial burdens, wrenching away tender household ties, sacrificing\r\ncheerfully and eagerly private interests, brilliant prospects, and high\r\nhopes, only to prove that twenty millions of men are physically stronger\r\nthan twelve. God forbid! This is no latter-day Olympic game, whoso\r\nvictors are to be rewarded with the applause of a party or a generation.\r\nAll the dead heroes and martyrs of the past will crowd forward to offer\r\ntheir unheard thanks; all the years to come will embalm with blessings\r\nthe memory of the patriots who open the door to wide advancement,\r\nprosperous growth, and high activity of a universal intelligence.\r\n\r\nAnd among these brave men, whom the world shall delight to honor, let\r\nour deepest grief and our justest pride be for LYON. We have given his\r\nhonest life too little notice;--this man whose sincerity was equalled\r\nonly by his zeal; who, in a rarely surpassed spirit of self-abnegation,\r\nwas content to lie down and die in the first heat of the great conflict,\r\nand to leave behind for more favored comrades the triumphal arches and\r\nrose-strewn paths of victory. The world has known no truer martyr than\r\nhe who fell at Wilson's Creek, August 10th, 1861.\r\n\r\n'The history of every man paints his character,' says Goethe; and scanty\r\nand imperfect as are the recorded details of General Lyon's life, enough\r\nis known to prove him to have been high-minded and brave as a soldier,\r\nwith a perseverance and a penetration that analyzed at once the\r\nplatforms of contending factions, and read in their elements the\r\nprinciples which are to govern the future of our nation.\r\n\r\nHe came of the stout Knowlton stock of Connecticut, a family of whom\r\nmore than one served England in the old French war, and afterward\r\ndistinguished themselves against her in the Revolution. We hear of the\r\ngallant Captain Knowlton at Bunker Hill, throwing up, in default of\r\ncotton, the breastwork of hay, which proved such an efficient protection\r\nto the provincials during the battle. Once more he appears as colonel,\r\nat Harlem Plains, rushing with his Rangers ('Congress' Own') upon the\r\nenemy on the Plains, and, cut off shortly from retreat by\r\nreinforcements, fighting bravely between the foes before and their\r\nreserves behind, and, falling at last, borne away by sorrowing comrades,\r\nand buried at sunset within the embankments. 'A brave man,' wrote\r\nWashington, 'who would have been an honor to any country.' With the\r\nmemory of such a hero engrafted upon his earliest childhood, we can not\r\nwonder at the bent of the boy Lyon's inclinations. 'Daring and\r\nresolute, and wonderfully attached to his mother,' it is easy to\r\nimagine what lessons of endurance and decision he learned from her,\r\nwhose just inheritance was the stout-hearted patriotism that had\r\nflowered into valorous deeds in her kindred, and was destined to live\r\nagain in her son. It was, an ordinary childhood, and a busy, uneventful\r\nyouth, passed for the most part in the old red farm-house nestled\r\nbetween two rocky hills near Eastport, where he was born. In 1837 he\r\nentered the Military Academy at West Point, and was a graduate, with\r\ndistinction, four years later. Of the years immediately following, we\r\nhave little information; but we can fancy the young soldier laying, in\r\nhis obscurity, the foundation for that practical military knowledge\r\nwhich so eminently distinguished his late brilliant career. During his\r\nyears of service in the Everglades of Florida, and on our Western\r\nfrontier, he had ample opportunity to gain a thorough insight into his\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nHe first appears in the history of the country in the Mexican war, is\r\npresent at the bombardment of Vera Cruz, dashes after the enemy at Cerro\r\nGordo, capturing on the crest of the hill a battery which he turns upon\r\nthe discomfited foe. At Contreras his command proves as impenetrable as\r\na phalanx of Alexander; and when at last the victorious Americans fight\r\ntheir way into Mexico, the city of fabulous treasures and associations\r\nwell-nigh classical, for the first time he receives a wound. He was\r\nbreveted captain for his gallantry at Cherubusco, and at the end of the\r\nwar received the rank of full captain, and was ordered with his regiment\r\nto California. No appointment could have been more felicitous. In the\r\nguerilla mode of warfare demanded by the peculiar nature of the country\r\nand its inhabitants, his habits of quick decision, and the experience of\r\na war with an enemy equally unscrupulous though less undisciplined, were\r\nabsolutely invaluable. Here was no scope for the conception and\r\nexcitation of deep-laid schemes; the movements of the enemy were too\r\nrapid. Plans that would elsewhere have been matured only in the process\r\nof a long campaign, were here often originated and completed in a single\r\nnight. Simple strategy was of more avail than the most intricate display\r\nof military science, and the impulse of a moment more to be relied upon\r\nthan the prudent forethought of a month. He had to combat, in the\r\nnewly-acquired territory, the cunning of tribes whose natural ferocity\r\nwas sharpened into vindictiveness by the encroachments upon their soil\r\nof a new and strange people; and every association with the intruders,\r\nwho were for the most part men of little reputation and less principle,\r\nhad developed in the Indians only the fiercest and most decided\r\nanimosity. To encounter their vigilance with watchfulness as alert, to\r\nconfound their swift counsels with sudden alarm, to penetrate their\r\nambuscades and anticipate their cunning with incessant activity, to be,\r\nin short, ubiquitous, was the duty of Captain Lyon.\r\n\r\nAfter years spent in the uncertain tactics of this half barbaric\r\nwarfare, he was removed, in the height of political strife in Kansas, to\r\nits very centre. Here, while comparatively free from the wearisome\r\nrequirements of active service such as had been demanded in California,\r\nand at a time when events the most portentous proved clearly to the\r\ngreat minds of the country the advance of a political crisis whose\r\nconsequences must be most important, involving--should deep-laid\r\nconspiracy be successful--the bankruptcy of principle and that\r\nhigh-handed outrage, the triumph, of a minority,--Captain Lyon had full\r\nliberty and abundant opportunity to settle for himself the great\r\nquestions mooted in the Missouri Compromises, the Lecompton\r\nConstitutions and the Dred Scott decisions of the day. To a mind\r\nunprejudiced, except as the honest impulses of every honest man's heart\r\nare always prejudiced in favor of the right, there was but a single\r\ndecision. Disgusted with the heartless policy which democracy had for so\r\nmany years pursued, and which now threatened to culminate either in its\r\nutter degradation at the North, or in the establishment in the South of\r\nan oligarchy which would annihilate all free action and suppress all\r\nfree opinion, he severed his connection with that party,--a step to\r\nwhich he was also impelled by the injustice that was then seeking to\r\nforce upon the people of Kansas an institution which they condemned as\r\nunproductive and expensive, to say nothing of their moral repugnance to\r\nthe very A B C of its principles. It was at this time that Captain Lyon\r\ncontributed to the _Manhattan Express_, a weekly journal of the\r\nneighborhood, a series of papers in which he took an earnest, manly and\r\ndecided stand in favor of the principles which his thoughtful mind\r\nrecognized as alone 'reliable,' and harmonious with the grand design and\r\nend of the great Republic of the West. To these articles we shall\r\nhereafter refer, at present hastening through the career, so striking\r\nand so sad, which a few brief months cut short, leaving only the memory\r\nof General Lyon as a legacy to the country his single aim and wise\r\ncounsels would have saved.\r\n\r\nThe guns of Fort Sumter had flashed along our coast an appeal whose\r\nforce no words can ever compute. The days had been busy with the\r\nassembling of armies, the nights restless with their solemn marches, and\r\nforge and factory rang with the strokes of the hammer and the whirr of\r\nflying shafts, whose echoes seemed measured to the air of some new\r\nMarseillaise. From our homes rushed forth sons, husbands, brothers,\r\nfathers, followed by the prayers and blessings of dear women, who\r\nyielded them early but willingly to their country. And while regiments\r\nclustered along the Potomac, and Washington lay entrenched behind white\r\nlines of tents, we find our soldier, fresh from Kansas strifes, in\r\ncommand of the United States Arsenal at St. Louis; and to his prompt\r\naction and decided measures at this important juncture the early success\r\nof the Union cause in Missouri is to be attributed. For a time St. Louis\r\nwas the theatre of action. The police commissioners, backed by Governor\r\nand Legislature, in the demanded the removal of the Union troops from\r\nthe grounds of the arsenal, claiming it as the exclusive property of the\r\nState, and asserting that the authority usurped by the general\r\ngovernment as but a partial sovereignty, and limited to the occupation,\r\nfor purposes exclusively military, of the certain tracts of land now\r\npending in this novel court of chancery. This highly enigmatical\r\nexposition of State rights, pompous and inflated though it was, failed\r\nto convince or convert Captain Lyon, who, being unable to detect, in his\r\noccupancy of the arsenal, any exaggeration of the rights vested by the\r\nConstitution in the general government, declined to abandon his post,\r\nand proceeded to call out the Home Guard, then awaiting the arrival of\r\nGeneral Harney, and temporarily under his command. His little army of\r\nten thousand men was then drawn up upon the heights commanding Camp\r\nJackson, then occupied by the Missouri militia under Col. Frost, whoso\r\ncommand had been increased by the addition of numerous individuals of\r\navowed secession principles. Uninfluenced by the reception of a note\r\nfrom this officer asserting his integrity and his purpose to defend the\r\nproperty of the United States, and disavowing all intention hostile to\r\nthe force at the arsenal, Captain Lyon replied by a peremptory summons\r\nfor an unconditional surrender. He found it incredible that a body\r\nassembled at the instigation of a traitorous governor, and acting under\r\nhis instructions and according to the 'unparalleled legislation' of a\r\ntraitorous legislature, receiving under the flag of the Confederate\r\nStates munitions of war but lately the acknowledged property of the\r\ngeneral government, could have any other than the as most unfriendly\r\ndesigns upon its enemies. The force of Camp Jackson (which\r\nnotwithstanding its professed character, boasted its streets Beauregard\r\nand Davis) being numerically inferior, and perhaps not entirely prepared\r\nto do battle for a cause whose legitimacy must still have been a\r\nquestion with many of them, decided, after a council of war, to comply\r\nwith the demands of Capt. Lyon, and became his prisoners. A few days\r\nafterward General Harney arrived, and Captain Lyon was elected Brigadier\r\nGeneral by the 1st Brigade Missouri Volunteers.\r\n\r\nConvinced of the imminence of the crisis and the peril of delay, Gen.\r\nLyon immediately commenced active operations against the secessionists\r\nat Potosi, and ordered the seizure of the steamer which had supplied the\r\noffensive army with material of war from the United States property at\r\nBaton Rouge. In the meantime, Gen. Harney, with a culpable blindness,\r\nhad made an extraordinary arrangement with Gen. Price, by which he\r\npledged himself to desist from military movements so long as the command\r\nof Gen. Price was able to preserve order in the State. Upon his removal\r\nby the authorities at Washington, nine days later, Gen. Lyon was left in\r\ncommand of the department. At this time the rebel general took occasion,\r\nin a proclamation to the people of Missouri, to feel assured that 'the\r\nsuccessor of Gen. Harney would certainly consider himself and his\r\ngovernment in honor bound to carry out this agreement (the Harney-Price)\r\nin good faith.' But his assurance was without foundation. The temper of\r\nthe new commander had been tried in the Camp Jackson affair, and an\r\ninterview between Price, Jackson and other prominent secessionists and\r\nGen. Lyon, resulted, after a few hours' consultation, in the declaration\r\nof the Union general that the authority of his government would be\r\nupheld at any cost and its property protected at all hazards. Three days\r\nlater, Jackson fled to Booneville, fearing an attack upon Jefferson\r\nCity, which was immediately occupied by Gen. Lyon, who was received with\r\nacclamation by the citizens. Unwilling to grant by delay what he had\r\nrefused to an underhand diplomacy,--opportunity to the enemy to possess\r\nthe government property, or entrench themselves strongly in their new\r\nquarters,--the general, with characteristic promptness, ordered an\r\nadvance upon Booneville. The rebel force was stationed above Rockport,\r\nbut retreated, after a skirmish which did not assume the proportions of\r\na battle; and the Union army, two thousand strong, entered the town,\r\nwhere the national colors and the welcomes of the inhabitants testified\r\ntheir joy at the change.\r\n\r\nThe army of General Lyon, amounting at one time to ten thousand, had\r\ndecreased by the first of August--the term of enlistment of many of the\r\nsoldiers having expired--to six thousand; and it was with this number\r\nthat, having swept the south-west, and believing the enemy intended to\r\nattack him at Springfield, he advanced to meet them at Dug Springs. The\r\narmy of the enemy was larger and their position a strong one, but they\r\nwere unable to hold it, and, after a sharp skirmish, fled in disorder,\r\nwhile Gen. Lyon continued his march toward Springfield. His situation\r\nhad now become a critical one. The reinforcements for which he had\r\ntelegraphed in vain, and in vain sent messengers to entreat from the\r\nchief of the department, Gen. Fremont, then in St. Louis, did not\r\narrive. His army was subsisting on half rations, and wearied with\r\nexhausting marches over the uneven country in the extreme heat of\r\nmidsummer. And now, for the first time, hope seemed to desert the\r\ngeneral. Under his direction the cause had hitherto triumphed in\r\nMissouri. Now, with zeal unabated and courage unflinching, he must fall\r\nbefore the enemy he had so successfully opposed, or retreat where\r\nretreat was disaster, disgrace, and defeat. No wonder that, as from day\r\nto day he looked for the expected aid as men in drought for the clouds\r\nthat are to bless them, he grew restless and perplexed and despairing;\r\nno wonder that the face that had never before worn the lines of\r\nindecision, should now lose its accustomed cheerfulness and glance of\r\ncalm purpose, and challenge sympathy and pity for the heart that had\r\nnever before asked more than admiration and respect. He felt that the\r\nhour had its demands, and that they must be met. Action, even in the\r\nface of disaster, was less a defeat than an inglorious retirement. The\r\npublic, surely unaware of the fearful odds against him, clamored for an\r\nengagement; the State expected it of its hero; the government awaited\r\nit, and with a brave heart, but no hope, Gen. Lyon prepared for the\r\nattack. The result all the world knows. Was it a victory where the\r\nconquerors were obliged to retire from the field, and carry out their\r\nwounded under a flag of truce? Was it a defeat where the enemy had been\r\nthrice repulsed, once driven from the ground, had burned their baggage\r\ntrain, and made no pursuit of the retreating army?\r\n\r\nBut most mournful are those last moments of the faithful soldier's life;\r\nmost solemn those last tones of his voice as his orders rang out on that\r\nmisty morning amid the smoke and shouts of the battle-field. He stands\r\nhere bare-headed, the blood streaming from two wounds which he does not\r\nheed, the cloud of perplexity settling over his face like a pall, his\r\ntroubled eyes fixed upon the enemy. He turns to head a regiment which\r\nhas lost its colonel--\"Forward! men; I will lead you!\" A moment, and he\r\nlies there: no more striving for victory here; no more anxious hours of\r\nweary watching for the succor that never came; no more goadings from an\r\nexacting public, nor any more appeals to an unheeding chief. Even the\r\ntriumphant hush of life could not smooth out those lines cut by unwonted\r\ncare upon his face, or answer the mute questioning of that painful\r\nindecision there. So from the West they brought him, by solemn marches,\r\nto the East, and colors hung at half-mast, and bells were tolled as the\r\nflag-draped hero was borne slowly by. And to the music of tender dirges,\r\nhe, whose whole life had been, inspired by the whistling of fifes and\r\nrolling of drums, was laid to rest. A handful of clods falling upon his\r\nbreast, their hollow sound never thrilling the mother heart that lay\r\nagain so near her son's, a volley fired over the grave, and all was\r\nover. Of all the brave men gone, no fate has seemed to us so sad.\r\nWinthrop, young and ardent, with the tide of great thoughts rashing in\r\nupon his princely heart, died in the flush of hope with the fresh\r\nenthusiasm of poetry and undimmed patriotism shining in his eyes, and we\r\nlaid our soldier to sleep under the violets. Ellsworth fell forward with\r\nthe captured flag of treason in his hand, and the whole nation cheering\r\nhim on in his early sally upon the 'sacred' Virginia soil. Brave and\r\nhonorable, with fine powers cultured by study and earnest thought, death\r\ntook from him no portion of the fame life would have awarded him. Baker\r\nrode into the jaws of death in that fatal autumn blunder; but the\r\nignominy of defeat rested upon other shoulders. His only to obey, even\r\nwhile 'all the world wondered.' But he did not fall before the honor of\r\na country's admiration and the meed of her grateful thanks were his.\r\nSoldier, orator and statesman, he had gained in a brilliant career a\r\nglory earned by few, and could well afford to die, assured of a memory\r\njustified from all reproach. But to Lyon, whom there were so few to\r\nmourn, death in the midst of anticipated defeat was bitter indeed. No\r\ntime to retrieve the losses and disasters the cruel remissness of others\r\nhad entailed upon him; the fruit of the anxious toil of months wrested\r\nfrom him even as it began to ripen; all his glad hopes chilled by\r\nsuspicion, but his faith, we may well believe, still strong in the\r\nultimate success of the cause he loved. A whole life he had given to his\r\ncountry, and she had not thought it worth while to redeem it from\r\ndisgrace with the few thousands that he asked. He had outlived the\r\nelasticity of youth, when wrongs are quickly remedied, and new impulses\r\nspring, like phoenixes, from the ashes of the old. Uncertain whether he\r\nwere the victim of a conspiracy, the tool of a faction, or the martyr to\r\nsome unknown theory, he died, and as the country had been to him wife\r\nand children, he left her his all.\r\n\r\nIt was known to but few that the soldier, whose career had been rather\r\nuseful than brilliant, had, when the scheming of politicians and their\r\ndoubly-refined arguments threatened to deceive and ruin the country,\r\nput by his sword and taken up the pen. In a series of articles, short,\r\nconcise, and to the point, he effectually canvassed the State. They are\r\naddressed to thinking men everywhere. Free from all trickery, strictly\r\nimpartial, relying entirely upon the soundness of his premises for\r\nsuccess,--for elegance of diction he had not, and he was too honest even\r\nto become a sophist,--these papers manifest at once the true patriot and\r\nthe intelligent man. Thousands of adherents the Republican cause had in\r\n1860, but not one more indefatigable or more heartily in earnest than\r\nLyon. Outside the limits of party interests, and uninfluenced personally\r\nby the predominance of either faction, he had worked out in his own way\r\nthe problem of national life, and now spread its solution before his\r\nreaders. 'Our cause,' said he, 'is to honor labor and elevate the\r\nlaborer.' Here we have the kernel of the whole matter; the spirit, if\r\nnot the letter, of the whole republican system of government. The secret\r\nthat philosophers have elaborated from the unconquerable facts of\r\nphysics, ethics, and psychology, that men of genius have evolved with\r\ninfinite difficulty from the mass of crude aesthetic associations that\r\ncluster around every object of nature or of art, Lyon, working and\r\nthinking alone as a citizen, has discovered, with the sole aid of common\r\nsense and the habit of practical observation. Carey and Godwin have\r\nproved by statistics for unbelievers the reasonableness of the doctrine\r\nenunciated by Lyon. Now, thanks to the untiring efforts of a few\r\nstout-hearted patriots, it is no new one to the North; but in the late\r\npresidential contest it was a strange weapon glittering in strong hands.\r\nOur society, diluted and weakened by the Southern element, revolted at\r\nfirst from the creed that is to prove its salvation. Not alone in our\r\nborder States had the dragon crept, searing our fair institutions with\r\nhis hot breath, but even upon the sturdy old Puritan stock were\r\nengrafted many of the petty notions that pass for 'principles' in Dixie.\r\nTrue, we were educated, all of us, into a sort of decent regard for the\r\ngood old element of labor,--we call it industry,--more antique, since\r\nantiquity is a virtue, than aristocracy, for it began in Paradise. But\r\nthis was a feature of our Northern character that was to be hurried out\r\nof sight, ignominiously buried without candle or bell, when the giant of\r\nSouthern chivalry stalked across our borders. The bravado and\r\ngentlemanly ruffianism of youthful F.F.V-ism at college, and the\r\nsupercilious condescension of incipient Southern belledom in the\r\nseminary, impressed young North America with a respect that was indeed\r\nunacknowledged, but that grew with its growth and strengthened with its\r\nstrength. But this mock romance of ancestry, this arrogant assumption by\r\nthe South of all the social virtues and courtesies of which the nation,\r\nor indeed the universe, could boast, was like the flash of an expiring\r\ncandle to Lyon. He had little to do with first families North or South;\r\nhis mission was to the _people_. His practical mind gathered in, sheaf\r\nafter sheaf, a whole harvest of political facts. He saw that the\r\ngovernment of the United States, originally intended to be administered\r\nby the people, had been for years in the power of the minority. Against\r\nthis perversion of the purpose of the founders of the republic, this\r\noutrage to the memory of men who labored for its defense and welfare, he\r\nentered his earnest protest. The shallow effort of the Democratic party\r\nto establish upon constitutional grounds the monstrous phantom of\r\njustice they called government, was met by his hearty indignation. He\r\nsays, 'With the artfulness of a deity and the presumption of a fiend,\r\nour own Constitution is perversely claimed by the Democracy as the aegis\r\nfor the establishment of a slave autocracy over our country.'\r\n\r\nNo element more fatal to our growth or freedom could Lyon conceive than\r\nthis slave autocracy. It sapped the very foundations of republicanism,\r\nand, stealthily advancing to the extreme limits of the law, enjoyed the\r\nconfidence of the people, while it plotted their subjugation. All the\r\nvaried machinery of the new social system, falsely styled government,\r\nhad for its object the extinction of individual rights and the\r\ndeification of capital. Church and state united in the unholy effort to\r\nCrush the masses, and intriguing politicians, by dint of dazzling\r\nrhetoric and plausible promises, lured the people on to secure their own\r\ndownfall at the polls. The only remedy for this Lyon saw in the\r\nelevation of the masses. 'It is the greatest political revolution yet to\r\nbe effected,' he says, 'to bring the laboring man to know that honest\r\nindustry is the highest of merits, and should be awarded the highest\r\nhonor; and, properly pursued, contributes to his intelligence and\r\nmorality, and to the virtues needed for official station.' 'The\r\ncalamity,' says an eminent writer from his far Platonean heights, 'is\r\nthe masses;' but liberty is a new religion that is to sweep over the\r\nworld and regenerate them. And to this end Lyon boldly advocated\r\nemancipation for the sake of the white man. If to-day, when patriotism\r\nis at a premium, men tremble before the acknowledged necessity of this\r\nmeasure, and are either too cowardly or too indolent to meet the demands\r\nof the times, it required no little boldness in 1860 to advance a theory\r\nso decided, even in a Kansas newspaper. But Lyon knew the inefficiency\r\nof half-way measures, and the moral degradation they inevitably entail\r\nupon the community so weak or so deluded as to adopt them. The hue and\r\ncry of abolitionism did not disturb him; he was not afraid of names.\r\nConservatism that sat in state at Washington, and pulled the wires all\r\nover the country,--a tremendous power, none the less fearful in that it\r\nwas only a galvanized one,--was a dead letter to him, its dignity\r\ndeparted with the age that had demanded it. Conservatism would have\r\nresented no impositions, established no new landmarks, asserted no\r\nindependence; would carry its mails on horseback, creep over the ocean\r\nin schooners, fight by sea in piked brigantines, and by land with spear\r\nand battle-axe; it would have emancipated no slaves in Great Britain and\r\nFrance, and no serfs in Russia. But if freedom means anything, it means\r\n_Progress_,--liberty to advance, never to retrograde. 'Nothing in the\r\nworld will ever go backward,' said the old lizard to Heine. All the\r\nauthority of a new Areopagus could never sanction that; and yet this\r\nliberty the South claims, nay, has already acted upon, so that the world\r\nmay see the result of the experiment, and against its continuance Lyon\r\nprotests. In the long silent years of preparation for the fray he has\r\nnursed strange thoughts on the ultimate destiny of man. He has seen in\r\ndreams, prophetic of a mighty accomplishment, his country growing great,\r\nand vigorous, and powerful, extending to struggling humanity everywhere\r\nthe protection of her friendship, building up noble institutions,\r\nencouraging science and the useful arts, and leading the van in the\r\nworld's great millennial march; and this not through any miraculous\r\ninterposition of Providence, but by means of an exalted intelligence and\r\nthe power of thought stimulating to action, and that of the noblest\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nBut you argue the unfitness of the masses for this destiny. Lyon\r\nanswers,--not in any musically-rounded sentences, in phrases nicely\r\nbalanced; the man is plain and outspoken,--'This is a truth of\r\nphilosophy and political economy, that man rises to a condition\r\ncorresponding to the rights, duties and responsibilities devolved upon\r\nhim; and therefore the only true way to make a man is to invest him with\r\nthe rights, duties and responsibilities of a man, and he generally rises\r\nin intellectual and moral greatness to a position corresponding to these\r\ncircumstances.' It is a mistake to suppose the great body of the people\r\nignorant of their position, or unconscious of their growing importance\r\nand dignity as representatives of a mighty empire. Vice and poverty have\r\nindeed well-nigh quenched humanity in thousands in our great cities,\r\nbut these are but a drop in the ocean. Behind lies our vast West, with\r\nits teeming population, sturdy, active and energetic. All our mountain\r\ndistricts are alive with men who, thanks to the press, are beginning to\r\nfeel their power. Every advantage of physical development their hardy\r\nlife gives them, and the growing consciousness and comprehension of\r\nfreedom, blooming under a munificent free-school dispensation, will do\r\nthe rest. Our internal manufacturing and agricultural elements at the\r\nNorth, already powerful and irrepressible, will soon exercise a\r\ntremendous influence in our government. Shall it be the influence of\r\nignorance played upon by the sophistry of demagogues and helping to\r\nrebuild the vicious doctrines that have stood firmly for so many years,\r\nor the healthful influence of intelligent industry tending to our\r\ngreatness and prosperity? This our war is to decide. No peaceful\r\nsolution of the great question could be made. This Lyon foresaw in the\r\ntruckling of politicians North to win the unit of Southern political\r\nsympathy: the main end and aim of the South being the appointment of\r\nSouthern men to the Presidency, 'as security on the one hand against\r\nunfavorable executive action toward slavery, and on the other against\r\nexecutive patronage adverse to its interests, the democratic party North\r\nsucceeded, by trimming party sails and decking party leaders, in suiting\r\ntheir fastidious Southern leaders.' The question once at issue, even a\r\npeaceful separation was impossible, though an amendment of the\r\nConstitution should sanction it. War was inevitable. The great bugbear\r\nof slavery would still exist; fugitive slave laws be forever upon the\r\npolitical carpet; formidable jealousies spring up between two nations\r\nfounded upon such diverse principles, yet united by very natural\r\ncircumstance of language and climate; internal wrangling would destroy\r\nall unity, conspiracies give the death-blow to all prosperity and all\r\nhope of advancement. All this if there were no great party at the North\r\nto rise upon the vast ground of humanity, claiming for its millions the\r\nprivilege of an unfettered life, for its children a fair start in the\r\nfuture. Only one remedy Lyon knew, and he stood there, the early apostle\r\nof Emancipation, and preached it. His doctrine was not accepted then, it\r\nis not accepted now; but the time must come, when millions shall have\r\nbeen expended, and blood shall have flowed like water only to delay it,\r\nwhen we will fly to it for salvation. Let those who still cry 'Peace,\r\npeace,' when there is no peace, learn what is to be its\r\nprice--Emancipation. It will be a bitter draught; well, so was the\r\nindependence of her colonies to England. And every day makes it more\r\nbitter; the gall in the cup rises to the brim; a few more months and it\r\nwill overflow; the people will take the matter into their own hands and\r\nlegislate slavery into the swamps of Florida.\r\n\r\nIt is a lame and blind philanthropy that cries for a respite. 'A little\r\nmore sleep, a little more slumber. After us the deluge.' And meanwhile\r\nthe damnable lies gain ground, and a new generation is lost to its due\r\ndevelopment. Have we yet to learn that we are no longer individuals, but\r\nparts of a mighty nation, and responsible in some sort, every one, women\r\nand men, for its destiny? Poland has learned this lesson. Her eyes are\r\nupon us now. Shall she, still struggling, find that blood and treasure,\r\nand all the thousand dear blessings of peace, have been sacrificed in\r\nvain? If you cry 'War is an evil!' we grant it; but is it reserved for\r\nthe nineteenth century to discover a creed for which there shall be no\r\nmartyrs? What great gift has the world ever won that was not bought with\r\nblood? When has independence of action or thought been purchased\r\notherwise than at the cost of persecution,--more revolution? Then let us\r\nnot slander revolutions. They are the throes of nature undergoing her\r\npurification; if it is as by fire, oh! let us have courage and stand\r\nbeside her in her hour of trial. St. George will not fight forever; the\r\ndragon of oppression is dying.\r\n\r\n  'Yes, although so slowly, he _is_ dying;\r\n  Many thousand years have fled in darkness,\r\n  Since the sword first cut his scaly armor,\r\n  And the red wound roused him into madness;\r\n  But the good knight is of race immortal,\r\n  Ever young, and passionate and fearless;\r\n  And the strength which oozes from the dragon,\r\n  Blooms reviving in the glorious warrior.'\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, the demon of war is not so black as we have painted him.\r\nWe do not shudder to-day as we read of the siege of Troy or the downfall\r\nof Carthage, or the Romance of the Cid. The song of Deborah, 'of the\r\navenging of Israel _when the people willingly offered themselves_,' is\r\none glorious burst of praise to God and gratitude to the martyrs. There\r\nwas war in heaven when ambition was cast out:--what quiet pastoral\r\nappeals to our noblest impulses as Paradise Lost does? Wisely and well\r\nspeaks the English clergyman when he says:--\r\n\r\n'But the truth is that here, as elsewhere, poetry has reached the truth,\r\nwhile science and common sense have missed it. It has distinguished--as,\r\nin spite of all mercenary and feeble sophistry, men ever will\r\ndistinguish--war from mere bloodshed. It has discerned the higher\r\nfeelings which lie beneath its revolting features. Carnage is terrible.\r\nThe conversion of producers into destroyers is a calamity. Death, and\r\ninsults to women worse than death--and human features obliterated\r\nbeneath the hoof of the war-horse--and reeking hospitals, and ruined\r\ncommerce, and violated homes, and broken hearts--they are all awful. But\r\nthere is something worse than death: cowardice is worse. And the _decay\r\nof enthusiasm and manliness is worse_. And it is worse than death, aye,\r\nworse than one hundred thousand deaths, when a people has gravitated\r\ndown into the creed, that the \"wealth of nations\" consists, not in\r\ngenerous hearts, \"fire in each breast, and freedom on each brow,\" in\r\nnational virtues, and primitive simplicity, and heroic endurance, and\r\npreference of duty to life--not in _men_, but in silk and _cotton_, and\r\nsomething that they call \"capital.\" Peace is blessed--peace arising out\r\nof charity. But peace springing out of the calculations of selfishness\r\nis not blessed. If the price to be paid for peace is this, that wealth\r\naccumulate and men decay, better far that every street, in every town of\r\nour once noble country, should run blood.'[K]\r\n\r\nAs we write, every telegram proves the vaunted unity of the South a\r\nsham, a visionary political bugbear, no longer strong or hideous enough\r\nto frighten the most inveterate conservative dough-face. But a few\r\nvictories do not end the war; still earnestness and effort and\r\nsacrifice, for the sick man of America will fight even when his 'brains\r\nare out.' Not until we have proved to Breckenridge, the traitor, that we\r\nare not 'fighting for principles that three-fourths of us abhor,' and\r\nthat the Union is not only 'a means of preserving the principles of\r\npolitical liberty,' but that in it is irrevocably bound up every living\r\nprinciple of all liberty, social, religious and individual; that in its\r\nshelter only we have security against wrong at home and insult from\r\nabroad; not until Emancipation has instituted a new order of things in\r\nsociety as well as in politics, will the death of the out-spoken patriot\r\nand brave man, Lyon, be avenged, and the Struggle be at an end. 'Genius\r\nis patient,' but patience has had her perfect work, and the days of\r\nRebellion are numbered. On with the crusade!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMACCARONI AND CANVAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe voice of Rome is baritone, always excepting that of the Roman\r\nlocomotive,--the donkey,--which is deep bass, and comes tearing and\r\nbraying along at times when it might well be spared. In the still night\r\nseason, wandering among the moonlit ruins of the Coliseum, while you\r\npause and gaze upon the rising tiers of crumbling stone above you,\r\nmemory retraces all you have read of the old Roman days: the forms of\r\nthe world-conquerors once more people the deserted ruin; the clash of\r\nringing steel; hot, fiery sunlight; thin, trembling veil of dust pierced\r\nby the glaring eyes of dying gladiators; red-spouting blood; screams of\r\nthe mangled martyrs torn by Numidian lions; moans of the dying; fierce\r\nshouts of exultation from the living; smiles from gold-banded girls in\r\nflowing robes, with floating hair, flower-crowned, and perfumed; the hum\r\nof thrice thirty thousand voices hushed to a whisper as the combat hangs\r\non an uplifted sword; the--\r\n\r\nAw-waw-WAUN-ik! WAW-NIK! WAUN-KI-w-a-w-n! comes like blatant fish-horn\r\nover the silent air, and your dream of the Coliseum ends ignominiously\r\nwith this nineteenth-century song of a jackass.\r\n\r\nAt night you will hear the shrill cry of the screech-owl sounding down\r\nthe silent streets in the most thickly-populated parts of the city. Or\r\nyou will perhaps be aroused from sleep, as Caper often was, by the\r\nlong-drawn-out cadences of some countryman singing a _rondinella_ as he\r\nstaggers along the street, fresh from a wine-house. Nothing can be more\r\nmelancholy than the concluding part of each verse in these rondinellas,\r\nthe voice being allowed to drop from one note to another, as a man\r\nfalling from the roof of a very high house may catch at some projection,\r\nhold on for a time, grow weak, loose his hold, fall, catch again, hold\r\non for a minute, and at last fall flat on the pavement, used up, and\r\ndown as low as he can reach.\r\n\r\nBut the street-cries of this city are countless; from the man who brings\r\nround the daily broccoli to the one who has a wild boar for sale, not\r\none but is determined that you shall hear all about it. Far down a\r\nnarrow street you listen to a long-drawn, melancholy howl--the voice as\r\nof one hired to cry in the most mournful tones for whole generations of\r\nold pagan Romans who died unconverted; poor devils who worshiped wine\r\nand women, and knew nothing better in this world. And who is their\r\nmourner? A great, brawny, tawny, steeple-crowned hat, blue-breeched,\r\ntwo-fisted fish-huckster; and he is trying to sell, by yelling as if his\r\nheart would break, a basket of fish not so long as your finger. If he\r\ncries so over anchovies, what would he do if he had a whale for sale?\r\n\r\nAnother _primo basso profundo_ trolls off a wheelbarrow and a fearful\r\ncry at the same time; not in unison with his merchandise, for he has\r\nbirds--quail, woodcock, and snipe--for sale, besides a string of dead\r\nnightingales, which he says he will 'sell cheap for a nice stew.' Think\r\nof stewed nightingales! One would as soon think of eating a boiled\r\nCremona violin.\r\n\r\nBut out of the way! Here comes, blocking up the narrow street, a\r\n_contadino_, a countryman from the Campagna. His square wooden cart is\r\ndrawn by a donkey about the size of, and resembling, save ears, a singed\r\nNewfoundland dog; his voice, strong for a vegetarian,--for he sells\r\nonions and broccoli, celery and tomatoes, _finocchio_ and mushrooms,--is\r\nlike tearing a firm rag: how long can it last, subjected to such use?\r\n\r\nIt is in the game and meat market, near the Pantheon, that you can more\r\nfully become acquainted with the street cries of Rome; but the Piazza\r\nNavona excels even this. Passing along there one morning, Caper heard\r\nsuch an extraordinary piece of vocalization, sounding like a Sioux\r\nwar-whoop with its back broken, that he stopped to see what it was all\r\nabout. There stood a butcher who had exposed for sale seven small stuck\r\npigs, all one litter; and if they had been his own children, and died\r\nheretics, he could not have howled over them in a more heart-rending\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nAbout sunrise, and even before it,--for the Romans are early\r\nrisers,--you will hear in spring-time a sharp ringing voice under your\r\nwindow, '_Acqua chetosa! Acqua, chetosa!_' an abridgment of _acque\r\naccetosa_, or water from the fountain of Accetosa, considered a good\r\naperient, and which is drank before breakfast. Also a voice crying out,\r\n'_Acqua-vi-ta!_' or spirits, drank by the workmen and others at an\r\nexpense of a baioccho or two the table-spoonful, for that is all the\r\nsmall glasses hold. In the early morning, too, you hear the chattering\r\njackdaws on the roofs; and then, more distinctly than later in the day,\r\nthe clocks striking their odd way. The Roman clocks ring from one to six\r\nstrokes four times during the twenty-four hours, and not from one to\r\ntwelve strokes, as with us. Sunset is twenty-four o'clock, and is noted\r\nby six strokes; an hour after sunset is one o'clock, and is noted by one\r\nstroke; and so on until six hours after, when it begins striking one\r\nagain. As the quarter hours are also rung by the clocks, if you happen\r\nto be near one you will have a fine chance to get in a muddle trying to\r\nseparate quarters from hours, and Roman time from your own. Another\r\nnoise comes from the game of _morra_. Caper was looking out of his\r\nwindow one morning, pipe in mouth, when he saw two men suddenly face\r\neach other, one of them bringing his arm down very quickly, when the\r\nother yelled as if kicked, '_Due!_' (two), and the first shouted at the\r\ntop of his lungs, '_Tre!_' (three). Then they both went at it, pumping\r\ntheir hands up and down and spreading their fingers with a quickness\r\nwhich was astonishing, while all the time they kept screaming, 'One!'\r\n'Four!' 'Three!' 'Two!' 'Five!' etc., etc. 'Ha!' said Caper, 'this is\r\nsomething like; 'tis an arithmetical, mathematical, etcetrical school in\r\nthe open air. The dirtiest one is very quick; he will learn to count\r\nfive in no time. But I don't see the necessity of saying \"three\" when\r\nthe other brings down four fingers, or saying \"five\" when he shows two.\r\nBut I suppose it is all right; he hasn't learned to give the right names\r\nyet.' He learned later that they were gambling.\r\n\r\nWhile these men were shouting, there came along an ugly old woman with a\r\ntambourine and a one-legged man with a guitar, and seeing prey in the\r\nshape of Caper at his window, they pounced on him, as it were, and\r\npoured forth the most ear-rending discord; the old lady singing, the old\r\ngentleman backing up against a wall and scratching at an accompaniment\r\non a jangling old guitar. The old lady had a bandana handkerchief tied\r\nover her head, and whilst she watched Caper she cast glances up and down\r\nthe street, to see if some rich stranger, or _milordo_, was not coming\r\nto throw her a piece of silver.\r\n\r\n'What are you howling about?' shouted Caper down to her.\r\n\r\n'A new Neapolitan canzonetta, signore; all about a young man who grieves\r\nfor his sweetheart, because he thinks she is not true to him, and what\r\nhe says to her in a serenade.' And here she screechingly sung,--\r\n\r\n  But do not rage, I beg, my dear;\r\n  I want you for my wife,\r\n  And morning, noon, and night likewise,\r\n  I'll love you like my life.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS.\r\n\r\n  I only want to get a word,\r\n  My charming girl, from thee.\r\n  You know, Ninella, I can't breathe,\r\n  Unless your heart's for me!\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Caper, 'if this is Italian music, I don't _see_ it.'\r\n\r\nThe one-legged old gentleman clawed away at the strings of the guitar.\r\n\r\n'I say,'_llustrissimo_,' shouted Caper down to him, 'what kind of\r\nstrings are those on your instrument?'\r\n\r\n'_Excellenza_, catgut,' he shouted, in answer.\r\n\r\n'_Benissimo!_ I prefer cats in the original packages. There's a _paolo_:\r\ntravel!'\r\n\r\nCaper had the misfortune to make the acquaintance of a professor of the\r\nmandolin, a wire-strung instrument, resembling a long-necked squash cut\r\nin two, to be played on with a quill, and which, with a guitar and\r\nviolin, makes a concert that thrills you to the bones and cuts the\r\nnerves away.\r\n\r\nBut the crowning glory of all that is ear-rending and peace-destroying,\r\nis carried around by the _Pifferari_ about Christmas time. It is a\r\nhog-skin, filled with wind, having pipes at one end, and a jackass at\r\nthe other, and is known in some lands as the bagpipe. The small shrines\r\nto the Virgin, particularly those in the streets where the wealthy\r\nEnglish reside, are played upon assiduously by the _pifferari_, who are\r\nsupposed by romantic travelers to come from the far-away Abbruzzi\r\nMountains, and make a pilgrimage to the Eternal City to fulfil a vow to\r\ncertain saints; whereas it is sundry cents they are really after. They\r\nare for the most part artists' models, who at this season of the year\r\nget themselves up _a la pifferari_, or piper, to prey on the romantic\r\nsusceptibilities and pockets of the strangers in Rome, and, with a pair\r\nof long-haired goat-skin breeches, a sheepskin coat, brown rags, and\r\nsandals, or _cioccie_, with a shocking bad conical black or brown hat,\r\nin which are stuck peacock's or cock's feathers, they are ready equipped\r\nto attack the shrines and the strangers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Caper there was a shrine to the Virgin in the\r\nsecond-story front of the house next to where he lived; that is,\r\nunfortunately for his musical ear, for the lamp that burned in front of\r\nthe shrine every dark night was a shining and pious light to guide him\r\nhome, and thus, ordinarily, a very fortunate arrangement. In the\r\nthird-story front room of the house of the shrine dwelt a Scotch artist\r\nnamed MacGuilp, who was a grand amateur of these pipes, and who declared\r\nthat no sound in the world was so sweet to his ear as the bagpipes: they\r\nrecalled the heather, haggis, and the Lothians, and the mountain dew, ye\r\nken, and all those sorts of things.\r\n\r\nOne morning at breakfast in the Cafe Greco he discoursed at length about\r\nthe pleasure the pifferari gave him; while Caper, taking an opposite\r\nview, said they had, during the last few days, driven him nearly crazy,\r\nand he wished the squealing hog-skins well out of town.\r\n\r\nMacGuilp told him he had a poor ear for music: that there was a charm\r\nabout the bagpipes unequalled even by the unique voices of the Sistine\r\nChapel; and there was nothing he would like better than to have all the\r\npipers of Rome under his windows.\r\n\r\nCaper remembered this last rash speech of Master MacGuilp, and\r\ndetermined at an early hour to test its truth. It happened, the very\r\nnext morning at breakfast, that MacGuilp, in a triumphant manner, told\r\nhim that he had received a promise of a visit from the Duchess of ----,\r\nwith several other titled English; and said he had not a doubt of\r\nselling several paintings to them. MacGuilp's style was of the\r\nblood-and-thunder school: red dawns, murdered kings, blood-stained\r\nheather, and Scotch plaids, the very kind that should be shown to the\r\nsweet strainings of hog-skin bagpipes.\r\n\r\nIn conversation Caper found out the hour at which the duchess intended\r\nto make her visit. He made his preparations accordingly. Accompanied by\r\nRocjean, he visited Gigi, who kept a costume and life school of models,\r\nfound out where the pipers drank most wine, and going there and up the\r\nVia Fratina and down the Spanish Steps, managed to find them, and\r\narranged it so that at the time the duchess was viewing MacGuilp's\r\npaintings, he should have the full benefit of a serenade from all the\r\npifferari in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Caper, pipe in mouth, at his window, saw the carriage\r\nof the duchess drive up, and from it the noble English dismount and\r\nascend to the artist's studio. The carriage had hardly driven away when\r\nup came two of the pipers, and happening to cast their eyes up they saw\r\nCaper, who hailed them and told them not to begin playing until the\r\nothers arrived. In a few moments six of the hog-skin squeezers stood\r\nready to begin their infernal squawking.\r\n\r\n'Go ahead!' shouted Caper, throwing a handful of _baiocchi_ among them;\r\nand as soon as these were gathered up, the pipers gave one awful,\r\nheart-chilling blast, and the concert was fairly commenced. Squealing,\r\nshrieking, grunting, yelling, and humming, the sounds rose higher and\r\nhigher. Open flew the windows in every direction.\r\n\r\n'_C'est foudroyante!_' said the pretty French _modiste_.\r\n\r\n'What the devil's broke loose?' shouted an American.\r\n\r\n'_Mein Gott im himmel! was ist das?_' roared the German baron.\r\n\r\n'_Casaccio! cosa faceste?_' shrieked the lovely Countess Grimanny.\r\n\r\n'_In nomine Domine!_' groaned a fat friar.\r\n\r\n'_Caramba! vayase al infierno!_' screamed Don Santiago Gomez.\r\n\r\n'_Bassama teremtete!_' swore the Hungarian gentleman.\r\n\r\nLouder squealed the bagpipes, their buzz filled the air, their shrieks\r\nwent ringing up to MacGuilp like the cries of Dante's condemned. The\r\nduchess found the sound barbarous. MacGuilp opened his window, upon\r\nwhich the pipers strained their lungs for the Signore Inglese, grand\r\namateur of the bagpipes. He begged them to go away. 'No, no, signore; we\r\nknow you love our music; we won't go away.'\r\n\r\nThe duchess could stand it no longer, her Servant called the carriage,\r\nthe English got in and drove off.\r\n\r\nStill rung out the sounds of the six bagpipes. Caper threw them more\r\n_baiocchi_.\r\n\r\nSuddenly MacGuilp burst out of the door of his house, maul-stick in\r\nhand, rushing on the pifferari to put them to flight.\r\n\r\n'_Iddio giusto!_' shouted two of the pipers; 'it is, IT IS the\r\n_Cacciatore_! the hunter; the Great Hunter!'\r\n\r\n'He is a painter!' shouted another.\r\n\r\n'No, he isn't; he's a hunter. _Gran Cacciatore!_ Doesn't he spend all\r\nhis time after quails and snipe and woodcock? Haven't I been out with\r\nhim day after day at Ostia? Long live the great hunter!'\r\n\r\nMacGuilp was touched in a tender spot. The homage paid him as a great\r\nhunter more than did away with his anger at the bagpipe serenade. And\r\nthe last Caper saw of him he was leading six pifferari into a wine shop,\r\nwhere they would not come out until seven of them were unable to tell\r\nthe music of bagpipes from the music of the spheres.\r\n\r\nSo ends the music, noises, and voices, of the seven-hilled city.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERMONS IN STONES.\r\n\r\nOne bright Sunday morning in January, Rocjean called on Caper to ask him\r\nto improve the day by taking a walk.\r\n\r\n'I thought of going up to the English chapel outside the Popolo to see a\r\npretty New Yorkeress,' said the latter; 'but the affair is not very\r\npressing, and I believe a turn round the Villa Borghese would do me as\r\nmuch good as only looking at a pretty girl and half hearing a poor\r\nsermon.'\r\n\r\n'As for a sermon, we need not miss that,' answered Rocjean, 'for we will\r\nstop in at Chapin the sculptor's studio, and if we escape one, and he\r\nthere, I am mistaken. They call his studio a shop, and they call his\r\nshop the Orphan's Asylum, because he manufactured an Orphan Girl some\r\nyears ago, and, as it sold well, he has kept on making orphans ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n'The murderer!'\r\n\r\n'Yes; but not half as atrocious as the reality. You must know that when\r\nhe first came over here he had an order to make a small Virgin Mary for\r\na Catholic church in Boston; but the order being countermanded after he\r\nhad commenced modeling in clay, he was determined not to lose his time,\r\nand so, having somewhere read of, in a yellow-covered novel, or seen in\r\nsome fashion-plate magazine, a doleful-looking female called The Orphan,\r\nhe instantly determined, cruel executioner that he is, to also make an\r\norphan. And he did. There is a dash of bogus sentiment in it that passes\r\nfor coin current with many of our traveling Americans; and the thing has\r\n\"sold.\" He told me not long since he had orders for twelve copies of\r\ndifferent sized Orphans, and you will see them all through his asylum.\r\nDo you remember those lines in Richard the Third,--\r\n\r\n  '\"Why do you look on us, and shake your head,\r\n  And call us orphans--wretched?\"'\r\n\r\nThey found Chapin in his shop, alias studio, busily looking over a\r\nnumber of plaster casts of legs and arms. He arose quickly as they\r\nentered and threw a cloth over the casts.\r\n\r\n'Hah! gudmornin', Mister Caper. Glad to see you in my studiyo. Hallo,\r\nRocjan! you there? Why haven't you ben up to see my wife and daughters?\r\nShe feels hurt, I tell you, 'cause you don't come near us. Do you know\r\nthat Burkings of Bosting was round here to my studiyo yeserday: sold\r\n_him_ an Orphan. By the way, Mister Caper, air you any relation to Caper\r\nof the great East Ingy house of Caper?'\r\n\r\n'He is an uncle of mine, and is now in Florence; he will be in Rome next\r\nweek.'\r\n\r\nA tender glow of interest beamed in Chapin's eyes: in imagination he saw\r\nanother Orphan sold to the rich Caper, who might 'influence trade.' His\r\ntone of voice after this was subdued. As Caper happened to brush against\r\nsome plaster coming in the studio, Chapin hastened to brush it from his\r\ncoat, and he did it as if it were the down on the wing of a beautiful\r\ngolden butterfly.\r\n\r\n'I was goin' to church this mornin' long with Missus Chapin; but I guess\r\nI'll stay away for once in me life. I want to show you The Orphan.'\r\n\r\n'I beg that you will not let me interfere with any engagement you may\r\nhave,' said Caper; 'I can call as well at any other time.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no; I won't lissen to that; I don't want to git to meeting before\r\nsermon, so come right stret in here now. There! there's The Orphan. You\r\nsee I've made her accordin' to the profoundest rules of art. You may\r\ntake a string or a yard measure and go all over her, you won't find her\r\nout of the way a fraction. The figure is six times the length of the\r\nfoot; this was the way Phidias worked, and I agree with him. Them were\r\nsplendid old fellows, them Greeks. There was art for you; high art!'\r\n\r\n'That in the Acropolis was of the highest order,' said Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' answered Chapin, who did not know where it was; 'far above all\r\nother. There was some sentiment in them days; but it was all of the\r\nreligious stripe; they didn't come down to domestic life and feelin';\r\nthey hadn't made the strides we have towards layin' open art to the\r\nmillion--towards developing _hum_ feelings. They worked for a precious\r\nfew; but we do it up for the many. Now there's the A-poller\r\nBelvidiary--beautiful thing; but the idea of brushin' his hair that way\r\nis ridicoolus. Did you ever see anybody with their hair fixed that way?\r\nNever! They had a way among the Greeks of fixing their drapery right\r\nwell; but I've invented a plan--for which I've applied to Washington for\r\na patent--that I think will beat anything Phidias ever did.'\r\n\r\n'You can't tell how charmed I am to hear you,' spoke Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'Well, it _is_ a great invention,' continued Chapin; 'and as I know\r\nneither of you ain't in the 'trade' (smiling), I don't care but what\r\nI'll show it to you, if you'll promise, honor bright, you won't tell\r\nanybody. You see I take a piece of muslin and hang it onto a statue the\r\nway I want the folds to fall; then I take a syringe filled with starch\r\nand glue and go all over it, so that when it dries it'll be as hard as a\r\nrock. Then I go all over it with a certain oily preparation and lastly\r\nI run liquid plaster-paris in it, and when it hardens, I have an exact\r\nmold of the drapery. There! But I hain't explained The Orphan. You see\r\nshe's sittin' on a very light chair--_that_ shows the very little\r\nsupport she has in this world. The hand to the head shows meditation;\r\nand the Bible on her knee shows devotion; you see it's open to the book,\r\nchapter, and verse which refers to the young ravens.'\r\n\r\n'Excuse me,' said Caper, 'but may I ask why she has such a _very_\r\nlow-necked dress on?'\r\n\r\n'Well, my model has got such a fine neck and shoulders,' replied Chapin,\r\n'that I re-eely couldn't help showing 'em off on the Orphan: besides,\r\nthey're more in demand--the low neck and short sleeves--than the\r\nhigh-bodied style, which has no buyers. But there is a work I'm engaged\r\non now that would just soot your uncle. Mr. Caper, come this way.'\r\n\r\nCaper saw what he supposed was a safe to keep meat cool in, and\r\napproached. Chapin threw back the doors of it like a showman about to\r\ndisclose the What Is It? and Caper saw a dropsical-looking Cupid with a\r\nvery short shirt on, and a pair of winged shoes on his feet. The figure\r\nwas starting forward as if to catch his equilibrium, which he had that\r\nmoment lost, and was only prevented from tumbling forward by a bag held\r\nbehind him in his left hand, while his right arm and hand, at full\r\nlength, pointed a sharp arrow in front of him.\r\n\r\n'Can you tell me what _that_ figger represents?' asked Chapin. As he\r\nreceived no reply, he continued: '_That_ is Enterprise; the two little\r\nruts at his feet represent a railroad; the arrow, showin' he's sharp,\r\npoints ahead; Go ahead! is his motto; the bag in his hand represents\r\nmoney, which the keen, sharp, shrewd business man knows is the reward of\r\nenterprise. The wreath round his head is laurel mixed up with lightnin',\r\nshowin' he's up to the tellygraph; the pen behind his ear shows he can\r\nfigger; and his short shirt shows economy, that admirable virtoo. The\r\nwings on his shoes air taken from Mercury, as I suppose you know; and--'\r\n\r\n'I say, now, Chapin, don't you think he's got a little too much legs,\r\nand rather extra stomach on him, to make fast time?' asked Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'Measure him, measure him!' said Chapin, indignantly; 'there's a string.\r\nFigure six times the length of his foot, everything else in proportion.\r\nNo, _sir_; I have not studied the classic for nothin'; if there is any\r\none thing I am strong on, it's anatomy. Only look at his hair. Why, sir,\r\nI spent three weeks once dissectin'; and for more'n six months I didn't\r\ndo anything, during my idle time, but dror figgers. Art is a kind of\r\nthing that's born in a man. This saying the ancients were better\r\nsculpters than we air, is no such thing; what did they know about\r\nsteam-engines or telegraphs? _Fiddle!_ They did some fustrate things,\r\nbut they had no idee of fixin' hair as it should be fixed. No, sir; we\r\nmoderns have great add-vantagiz, and we improve 'em. Rome is the Cra--'\r\n\r\n'I must bid you good-day,' interrupted Caper; 'your wife will miss you\r\nat the sermon: you will attribute it to me; and I would not\r\nintentionally be the cause of having her ill-will for anything.'\r\n\r\n'Well, she is a pretty hard innimy; and they do talk here in Rome if you\r\ndon't toe the mark. But ree-ly, you mustn't go off mad (smiling). You\r\nmust call up with Rocjan and see us; and I ree-ly hope that when your\r\nuncle comes you will bring him to my studiyo. I am sure my Enterprise\r\nwill soot him.'\r\n\r\nSo Chapin saw them out of his studio. Not until Caper found himself\r\nseated on a stone bench under the ilexes of the Villa Borghese, watching\r\nthe sunbeams darting on the little lizards, and seeing far off the\r\nAlbanian Mountains, snowcapped against the blue sky--not until then did\r\nhe breathe freely.\r\n\r\n'Rocjean,' said he; 'that stone-cutter down there--that Chapin--'\r\n\r\n'_Chameau!_ roared Rocjean. 'He and his kind are doing for art what the\r\nJews did for prize-fighting--they ruin it. They make art the\r\nlaughing-stock of all refined and educated people. Art applied solely to\r\nsculpture and painting is dead; it will not rise again in these our\r\ntimes. But art, the fairy-fingered beautifier of all that surrounds our\r\nhomes and daily walks, save paintings and statuary, never breathed so\r\nfully, clearly, nobly as now, and her pathway amid the lowly and homely\r\nthings around us is shedding beauty wherever it goes. The rough-handed\r\nartisan who, slowly dreaming of the beautiful, at last turns out a stone\r\nthat will beautify and adorn a room, instead of rendering it hideous,\r\nhas done for this practical generation what he of an earlier theoretical\r\nage did for his cotemporaries when he carved the imperial Venus of\r\nMilos. Enough; _this_ is the sermon _not_ preached from stones.'\r\n\r\n\r\nA BALL AT THE COSTA PALACE\r\n\r\nOne sunlight morning in February, while hard at work in his studio,\r\nCaper was agreeably surprised by the entrance of an elderly uncle of\r\nhis, Mr. Bill Browne, of St. Louis, a gentleman of the rosy, stout,\r\nhearty school of old bachelors, who, having made a large fortune by\r\nkeeping a Western country store, prudently retired from business, and\r\nfinding it dull work doing nothing, wisely determined to enjoy himself\r\nwith a tour over the Continent, 'or any other place he might conclude to\r\nvisit.'\r\n\r\n'I say, Jim, did you expect to see me here?' was his first greeting.\r\n\r\n'Why, Uncle Bill! Well, you are the last man I ever thought would turn\r\nup. They didn't write me a word of your coming over,' answered Caper.\r\n\r\n'Mistake; they wrote you all about it; and if you'll drop round at the\r\npost-office, you'll find letters there telling you the particulars. Fact\r\nis, I am ahead of the mail. Coming over in the steamer, met a man named\r\nOrville; told me he knew you, that he was coming straight through to\r\nRome, and offered to pilot me. So I gave up Paris and all that, and came\r\nsmack through, eighteen days from New York. But I'm dry. Got a match?\r\nHere, try one of these cigars.'\r\n\r\nCaper took a cigar from his uncle's case, lit it, and then, calling the\r\nman who swept out the studios, sent him to the neighboring wine-shop for\r\na bottle of wine.\r\n\r\n'By George, Jim, that's a pretty painting: that jackass is fairly alive,\r\nand so's the girl with a red boddice. I say, what's she got that towel\r\non her head for? Is it put there to dry?'\r\n\r\n'No; that's an Italian peasant girl's head-covering. Most all of them do\r\nso.'\r\n\r\n'Do they? I'm glad of that. But here comes your man with the liquor.'\r\n\r\nAnd, after drinking two or three tumblers full, Uncle Bill decided that\r\nit was pretty good cider. The wine finished, together with a couple of\r\nrolls that came with it, the two sallied out for a walk around the\r\nPincian Hill, the grand promenade of Rome. Towards sunset they thought\r\nof dinner, and Uncle Bill, anxious to see life, accepted Caper's\r\ninvitation to dine at the old Gabioni: here they ordered the best\r\ndishes, and the former swore it was as good a dinner as he ever got at\r\nthe Planter's House. Rocjean, who dined there, delighted the old\r\ngentleman immensely, and the two fraternized at once, and drank each\r\nother's health, old style, until Caper, fearing that neither could\r\nconveniently hold more, suggested an adjournment to the Greco for coffee\r\nand cigars.\r\n\r\nWhile they were in the cafe, Rocjean quietly proposed something to\r\nCaper, who at once assented; the latter then said to Uncle Bill,--\r\n\r\n'You have arrived in Rome just at the right time. You may have heard at\r\nhome of the great Giacinti family; well, the Prince Nicolo di Giacinti\r\ngives a grand ball to-night at the Palazzo Costa. Rocjean and I have\r\nreceived invitations, embracing any illustrious strangers of our\r\nacquaintance who may happen to be in Rome; so you must go with us. You\r\nhave no idea, until you come to know them intimately, what a\r\ngood-natured, off-hand set the best of the Roman nobility are. Compelled\r\nby circumstances to keep up for effect an appearance of great reserve\r\nand dignity before the public, they indemnify themselves for it in\r\nprivate by having the highest kind of old times. They are passionately\r\nattached to their native habits and costumes, and though driven, on\r\nstate occasions especially, to imitate French and English habits, yet\r\nthey love nothing better than at times to enjoy themselves in their\r\nnative way. The ball given by the prince to-night is what might be\r\ncalled a free-and-easy. It is his particular desire that no one should\r\ncome in full dress; in fact, he rather likes to have his stranger guests\r\ncome in their worst clothes, for this prevents the attention of the\r\npublic being called to them as they enter the palace. After you have\r\nlived some time in Rome you will see how necessary it is to keep dark,\r\nso you will see no flaring light at the palace gate; it's all as quiet\r\nand common-place as possible. The dresses, you must remember, are\r\nassumed for the occasion because they are, or were, the national\r\ncostume, which is fast disappearing, and if it were not for the noble\r\nwearers you will see to-night, you could not find them anywhere in Rome.\r\nYou will perhaps think the nobility at the ball hardly realize your\r\nideas of Italian beauty and refinement, compared with the fine specimens\r\nof men and women you may have seen among the Italian opera singers at\r\nhome: well, these same singers are picked specimens, and are chosen for\r\ntheir height and muscular development from the whole nation, so that\r\nstrangers may think all the rest at home are like them: it is a little\r\npiece of deception we can pardon.'\r\n\r\nAfter this long prelude, Rocjean proposed that they should try a game of\r\nbilliards in the Cafe Nuovo. After they had played a game or two, and\r\ndrank several _mezzo caldos_, or rum punches, they walked up the Corso\r\nto the Via San Claudio, No. 48, and entered the palace gate. It was very\r\ndark after they entered, so Rocjean, telling them to wait one moment,\r\nlit a _cerina_, or piece of waxed cord, an article indispensable to a\r\nRoman, and, crossing the broad courtyard, they entered a small door, and\r\nafter climbing and twisting and turning, found a ticket-taker, and the\r\nnext minute were in the ball-room.\r\n\r\nUncle Bill was delighted with the excessively free-and-easy ball of\r\nPrince Giacinti, but was very anxious to know the names of the nobility,\r\nand Rocjean politely undertook to point out the celebrities, offering\r\nkindly to introduce him to any one he might think looked sympathetic;\r\n'what they call _simpatico_ in Italian,' explained Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'That pretty girl in _Ciociara_ costume is the Condessa or Countess\r\nStella di Napoli.'\r\n\r\n'Introduce me,' said Uncle Bill.\r\n\r\nRocjean went through the performance, concluding thus: 'The countess\r\nexpresses a wish that you should order a _bottiglia_ (about two bottles)\r\nof red wine.'\r\n\r\n'Go ahead,' quoth Uncle Bill; 'for a nobility ball this comes as near a\r\ndance-house affair as I ever want to approach. By the way, who is that\r\npickpocket-looking genius with eyes like a black snake?'\r\n\r\n'Who is _that_?' said Rocjean, theatrically. 'Chut! a word in your ear;\r\nthat is An-to-nel-li!'\r\n\r\n'The devil! But I heard some one only a few minutes ago call him\r\nAngelucio.'\r\n\r\n'That was done satirically, for it means big angel, which you, who read\r\nthe papers, know that Antonelli is _not_. But here comes the wine, and I\r\nsee the countess looks dry. Pour out a half-dozen glasses for her. The\r\nRoman women, high and low, paddle in wine like ducks, and it never\r\nupsets them; for, like ducks, their feet are so large that neither you\r\nnor wine can throw them. I wish you could speak Italian, for here comes\r\nthe Princess Giacinta _con Marchese_--'\r\n\r\n'I wish,' said Uncle Bill, 'you would talk English.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' continued Rocjean, 'with the Marchioness Nina Romana, if you\r\nlike that better. Shall I introduce you?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly,' replied the old gentleman, 'and order two more what d'ye\r\ncall 'ems. It's cheap--this knowing a princess for a quart of red\r\nteaberry tooth-wash, for that's what this \"wine\" amounts to. I am going\r\nto dance to-night, for the Princess Giacinta is a complete woman after\r\nmy heart, and weighs her two hundred pound any day.'\r\n\r\nThe nobility now began begging Rocjean and Caper to introduce them to\r\nhis excellency _Il vecchio_, or the old man; and Uncle Bill, in his\r\nenthusiasm at finding himself surrounded with so many princes,\r\nAllegrini, Pelligrini, Sapgrini, and Dungreeny, compelled Caper to order\r\nup a barrel of wine, set it a-tap, and tell the nobility to 'go in.' It\r\nis needless to say that they _went_ in. Many of the costumes were very\r\nrich, especially those of the female nobility; and in the rush for a\r\nglass of wine the effect of the brilliant draperies flying here and\r\nthere, struggling and pushing, was notable. The musicians, who were\r\nstanding on what appeared to be barrels draped with white cloth, jumped\r\ndown and tried their luck at the wine-cask, and, after satisfying their\r\nthirst, returned to their duties. There was a guitar, mandolin, violin,\r\nand flute, and the music was good for dancing. Uncle Bill was pounced on\r\nby the Princess Giacinta and whirled off into some kind of a dance, he\r\ndid not know what; round flew the room and the nobility; round flew\r\nbarrels of teaberry tooth-wash, beautiful princesses, big devils of\r\nAntonellis. Lights, flash, hum, buzz, buzz, zzz--ooo--zoom!\r\n\r\nUncle Bill opened his eyes as the sunlight shed one golden bar into his\r\nsleeping-room at the Hotel d'Europe, and there by his bedside sat his\r\nnephew, Jim Caper, reading a letter, while on a table near at hand was a\r\ngoblet full of ice, a bottle of hock, and another bottle corked, with\r\nstring over it.\r\n\r\n'It's so-da wa-ter,' said Uncle Bill, musing aloud.\r\n\r\n'Hallo, uncle, you awake?' asked Caper, suddenly raising his eyes from\r\nhis letter.\r\n\r\n'I am, my son. Give thy aged father thy blessing, and open that hock and\r\nsoda water quicker! I say, Jim, now, what became of the nobility, the\r\nColonnas and Aldobrandinis, after they finished that barrel? Strikes me\r\nsome of them will have an owlly appearance this morning.'\r\n\r\n'You don't know them,' answered Caper.\r\n\r\n'I am beginning to believe I don't, too,' spoke Uncle Bill. 'I say, now,\r\nJim, where did we go last night?'\r\n\r\n'Why, Uncle Bill, to tell you the plain truth, we went to a ball at the\r\nCosta Palace, and a model ball it was, too.'\r\n\r\n'I have you! Models who sit for you painters. Well, if they arn't\r\nnobility, they drink like kings, so it's all right. Give us the hock,\r\nand say no more about it.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOWE'S CAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew persons, perhaps, are aware that Schoharie County, N.Y., contains a\r\ncave said to be nine or ten miles in extent, and, in many respects, one\r\nof the most remarkable in America. Its visitors are few,--owing,\r\nprobably, to its recent discovery, together with its comparative\r\ninaccessibility;--yet these few are well rewarded for its exploration.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1861, I started, with three companions, to visit\r\nthis interesting place.\r\n\r\nI will not weary the reader by describing the beauty of the Hudson and\r\nthe grandeur of the Catskills; yet I would fain fix in my memory forever\r\none sunrise, seen from the summit of a bluff on the eastern bank of the\r\nriver, when the fog, gradually lifting itself from the stream, and\r\nslowly breaking into misty fragments, unveiled broad, smiling meadows,\r\ndark forests, village after village, while above all, far in the\r\ndistance, rose the Catskills, clear in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nAfter two days crowded with enjoyment, we arrived in Schoharie, where we\r\npassed the night. Having given orders to be called at five, we took\r\nadvantage of the leisure hour this arrangement gave us to view, the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD FORT.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the 'fort' is a dilapidated old church, used as a shelter\r\nduring the Indian wars, and also in the days of the Revolution. On the\r\nsmooth stones that form the eastern side are carved the names of the\r\nsoldiers who defended it, with the date, and designation of the regiment\r\nto which they belonged. I deciphered also, among other curious details,\r\nthe name of the person who 'gave the favor of the ground.' I would\r\ngladly have indulged my antiquarian tastes by copying these rude\r\ninscriptions; but the eager cries of my companions compelled me to hurry\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe western portion of the structure has also its story to tell. The\r\ntraces of besieging cannon balls are still to be distinctly seen, and in\r\none place I observed a smooth, round hole, made by the passage of a ball\r\ninto the interior of the fort.\r\n\r\nAs I stood on the walls of this ancient building, surveying the valley\r\nit overlooked, with its straggling village lying at our feet, and the\r\nfair Schoharie Creek, now gleaming in the sunlight of the meadows, or\r\ndarkening in the shade of the trees that overhung it, the past and the\r\npresent mingled strongly in my thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe Stars and Stripes, that on this very spot had seen our fathers\r\nrepelling a foreign foe, now waved over their sons, forced from their\r\nquiet homes, not to contend with the stranger and the alien, but to\r\nsubdue those rebellious brothers whose sacrilegious hands had torn down\r\nthat sacred flag, reared amidst the trials and perils of '76. Not less\r\nnoble the present contest than the past, nor less heroic the soldier of\r\nto-day than the patriot of the Revolution. We continue to-day the fight\r\nthey fought against injustice and oppression--a conflict that will end\r\nonly when every nation and every race shall lift unshackled hands up to\r\nGod in thanksgiving for the gift of freedom. A deeper love of my\r\ncountry, and a firmer trust in the God of truth and justice, sank into\r\nmy heart as I turned away from those rude walls, sacred to the memory of\r\ndeparted valor.\r\n\r\nWe hurried back to the breakfast that awaited us, and then drove to\r\n\r\nTHE CAVE,\r\n\r\nwhich lies six miles from the village of Schoharie. The entrance is at\r\nthe base of a heavily-wooded mountain that shuts in a secluded little\r\nvalley. The only opening from this solitary vale is made by a small\r\nstream that winds out from among the hills. The entire seclusion of the\r\nplace has prevented its earlier discovery; but the inevitable 'Hotel'\r\nnow rears its wooden walls above the cave to encourage future\r\nadventurers to explore its recesses.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of the proprietor of the hotel, who usually acts as\r\ncicerone, we took as guide a sun-burnt young man, with an economical\r\nportion of nose, closely cut hair, and a wiry little mouth, which we saw\r\nat a glance would open only at the rate of a quarter of a dollar a fact.\r\nHe proved himself, however, shrewd, witty, and, withal, good-natured,\r\nand as fond of a joke as any one of us all. Bob, for so our new\r\ncompanion named himself, showed us at once into a dressing-room,\r\nadvising us to put on, over our own garments, certain exceedingly coarse\r\nand ragged coats, hats and pants, which transformed us at once from\r\nrather fashionable young men into a set of forlorn-looking beggars. Each\r\nlaughed at the appearance of the other, unconscious of his own\r\ntransformation; but Bob, with more truth than politeness, informed us\r\nthat we all 'looked like the Old Nick;' whence it appeared that in Bob's\r\nopinion the Enemy is usually sorely afflicted with a shabby wardrobe,\r\nand that, in the words of the sage,\r\n\r\n  'Poverty is the devil.'\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing furnished with small oil lamps, we descended to the mouth of the\r\ncave. This opens at once into an entrance-hall, one hundred and fifty\r\nfeet in length and thirty in width, and high enough for a tall man to\r\nenter upright.\r\n\r\nI inquired of Bob when the cave was discovered. 'In 1842,' he replied.\r\n'And by whom?' I continued. 'Why,' rejoined our guide, 'Mister Howe was\r\na huntin' for caves, and he came across this one.' Rather a queer thing\r\nto be hunting for, I thought, though without comment; but in future I\r\nallowed Bob to carry on the conversation as best suited himself. He\r\nplunged at once into a dissertation on the state of the country, gravely\r\nstating that 'Washington was taken.' At the involuntary smile which this\r\nastounding piece of news called forth, Bob confessed 'he might be\r\nmistaken in this respect, as his paper came but once a week, and\r\nfrequently only once in two weeks.' Finding him a stanch Union man, and\r\ninclined to serve his country to the best of his ability, we undertook\r\n'to post him up' on the present state of affairs, for which the poor\r\nfellow was truly grateful.\r\n\r\nEntrance Hall leads into Washington Hall, a magnificent apartment, three\r\nhundred feet long, and in the lowest part upwards of forty feet high.\r\nOur guide favored us at every turn with some new story or legend,\r\nrepeated in a sing-song, nasal tone, ludicrously contrasting with the\r\nextravagance of the tales themselves. Yet he recited all alike with the\r\nmost immovable gravity. It was a lively waltz of three notes.\r\n\r\nOld Tunnel and Giant's Chapel, two fine cave-rooms, were next explored.\r\nOn entering the latter, Bob favored us with the rehearsal of an old\r\nstory from the Arabian Nights, which--unfortunately, not one which will\r\nbear repetition--he wished us to believe actually happened in this very\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nI may here confess that, when we came to 'the dark hole in the ground,'\r\nI felt some slight reluctance to trust myself therein. Bob, observing\r\nthis, immediately drew from his lively imagination such an astonishing\r\nincrease of the perils of the way, looking complacently at me all the\r\nwhile, that my alarm, strange to say, took flight at once, and I pushed\r\nonward defiantly. The journey is, however, one that might justly inspire\r\ntimidity. Above our heads, and on each side, frowned immense rocks,\r\nthreatening at every instant to fall upon us; while the dash and babble\r\nof a stream whose course we followed, increasing in volume as we\r\nprogressed, came to our ears like the 'sound of many waters.' We crossed\r\nthis stream a hundred times, at least, in our journey. Sometimes it\r\nmurmured and fretted in a chasm far below us; again, it spread itself\r\nout in our very path, or danced merrily at our side, until it seemed to\r\nplunge into some distant abyss with the roar of a cataract.\r\n\r\nWe emerged from the windings of our tortuous path into Harlem Tunnel, a\r\nroom six hundred feet in length. In its sides were frequent openings,\r\nleading into hitherto unexplored parts of the cave; but we did not\r\nventure to enter many of these. Never have I seen such rocks as we here\r\nencountered; at one time piled up on one another, ready to totter and\r\nfall at a touch; at another, jutting out in immense boulders, sixty feet\r\nabove our heads, while, in the openings they left, we gazed upward into\r\ndarkness that seemed immeasurable.\r\n\r\nFrom Harlem Tunnel we came into Cataract Hall, also of great length, and\r\nremarkable for containing a small opening extending to an unknown\r\ndistance within the mountain, since it apparently cannot be explored.\r\nApplying the ear to this opening, the sound of an immense cataract\r\nbecomes audible, pouring over the rocks far within the recesses of the\r\nmountain, where the Creator alone, who meted out those unseen, sunless\r\nwaters, can behold its beauty and its terror.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Pool of Siloam, whose babbling waters sparkled into beauty\r\nas we held our lamps above them, we entered Franklin Hall. Here the\r\nroof, although high enough in some places, is uncomfortably low in\r\nothers; whereupon Bob bade us give heed to the caution of Franklin,\r\n'Stoop as you go, and you will miss many hard thumps.'\r\n\r\nWe arrived next at Flood Hall, where a party of explorers were once put\r\nin great peril by a sudden freshet in the stream. They barely saved\r\nthemselves by rapid flight, the water becoming waist-deep before they\r\ngained the entrance. We had no reason to doubt the truth of this story,\r\nas there were evidences of the rise and fall of water all about us.\r\n\r\nCongress Hall now awaited us, but I will omit a description of it, as\r\nMusical Hall, which immediately succeeded, contains so much more that is\r\ninteresting. On entering, our attention was first directed to an\r\naperture wide enough for the admission of a man's head. Any sound made\r\nin this opening is taken up and repeated by echo after echo, till the\r\nvery spirit of music seems awakened. Wave after wave of melodious sound\r\ncharms the ear, even if the first awakening note has been most\r\ndiscordant. If the soul is filled with silent awe while listening to the\r\nunseen waterfall in Cataract Hall, it is here wooed into peace by a\r\nharmony more perfect than any produced by mortal invention. A\r\ntemple-cavern vaster than Ellora with a giant 'lithophone' for organ!\r\n\r\nThe second wonder of Musical Hall is a lake of great extent, and from\r\nten to thirty feet in depth. The smooth surface of these crystal waters,\r\nnever ruffled by any air of heaven, and undisturbed save by the dip of\r\nour oars as we were ferried across, the utter darkness that hid the\r\nopposite shore from our straining sight, the huge rocks above, whose\r\nclustering stalactites, lighted by our glimmering lamps, sparkled like a\r\nstarry sky, the sound of the far-off waterfall, softened by distance\r\ninto a sad and solemn music, all united to recall with a vivid power,\r\nnever before felt, the passage of the 'pious AEneas' over the Styx, which\r\nI had so often read with delight in my boyhood. I half fancied our\r\nYankee Bob fading into a vision of the classic Charon, and that the\r\nghosts of unhappy spirits were peering at us from the darkness.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the lake is Annexation Rock, a huge limestone formation in\r\nthe shape of an egg. It stands on one end, is twenty-eight feet in\r\ndiameter, and over forty in height.\r\n\r\nWe were now introduced into Fat Man's Misery, where the small and\r\nattenuated have greatly the advantage. We emerged from this narrow and\r\ndifficult passage into the Museum, half a mile long, and so called from\r\nthe number and variety of its formations. We did not linger to examine\r\nits curiosities, but pushed on over the Alps, which we surmounted, aided\r\npartly by ladders. Very steep and rugged were these Alps, and quite\r\nworthy of the name they bear. We descended from them into the Bath-room,\r\nwhere a pool of water and sundry other arrangements suggest to a lively\r\nimagination its designation. It certainly has the recommendation of\r\nbeing the most retired bath-room ever known. That of the Neapolitan\r\nsibyl is public in comparison to it.\r\n\r\nWe then entered Pirate's Retreat. Why so named, I can not guess, for I\r\ndoubt if the boldest pirate who ever sailed the 'South Seas o'er' would\r\ndare venture alone so far underground as we now found ourselves.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Pirate's Retreat, we were obliged to cross the Rocky\r\nMountains, similar in formation and arrangement to the Alps. The Rocky\r\nMountains lead into Jehoshaphat's Valley, one mile in length. Like its\r\nnamesake, this valley is a deep ravine, with steep, rugged sides, and a\r\nbrawling brook running at the bottom.\r\n\r\nMiller's Hall next claims our attention. Here we take leave of the\r\nbrook, which, with the cave, loses itself in a measureless ravine, where\r\nthe rocks have fallen in such a manner as to obstruct any further\r\nexplorations.\r\n\r\nFrom thence, turning to the right, we enter Winding Way, a most\r\nappropriate name for the place. The narrow passage turns and twists\r\nbetween masses of solid rook, high in some places, and low in others.\r\nThe deathlike silence of the solitude that surrounded us impressed us\r\nwith a vague feeling of fear, and we felt no disposition to tempt the\r\nDevil's Gangway, especially as, in consequence of a recent freshet, it\r\nwas partly filled with water. Our guide informed us that beyond the\r\nGangway were several rooms, among which Silent Chamber and Gothic Arch\r\nwere the most noteworthy. The portion of the cave visited by tourists\r\nterminates in the 'Rotunda,' eight miles from the entrance; although\r\nexplorations have been made some miles further. The Rotunda is\r\ncylindrical in shape, fifteen feet in diameter, and one hundred feet in\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nWe were now in a little room six miles from the mouth of the cave, and\r\nthought the present a good opportunity to try the effect of the absence\r\nof light and sound on the mind. Extinguishing our lights, therefore, we\r\nresigned ourselves to the influences of darkness and silence. To realize\r\nsuch a state fully, one must find one's self in the bowels of the earth,\r\nas we were, where the beating of our own hearts alone attested the\r\nexistence of life. We were glad to relight our lamps and begin our\r\nreturn to upper air.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned Annexation Rock; near it is another curious\r\nfreak of nature, called the Tree of the World's History. It resembles\r\nthe stump of a tree two feet in diameter, and cut off two feet above the\r\nground, upon which a portion of the trunk, six feet in length, is\r\nexactly balanced. A singular type of the changes which time makes in the\r\nworld above-ground.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum, whose examination we had postponed till our return, we\r\nwere lost in a world of wonders. It were vain to attempt to describe or\r\neven enumerate half of the various objects that met us at every turn.\r\nChurches, towers, complete with doors and windows, as if finished by the\r\nhand of an architect; an organ, its long and short pipes arranged in\r\nperfect order; Lot's Wife, a figure in stone, life size; in another\r\nplace two women, in long, flowing garments, standing facing each other,\r\nas if engaged in earnest conversation, and a soldier in complete\r\narmor,--these were among the most striking of the larger objects. The\r\nvegetable world was also well represented. Here was a bunch of carrots,\r\nfresh as if just taken from the ground, sheaves of wheat, bunches of\r\ngrain and grass hanging from the walls and roofs. Interspersed were\r\nbirds of every species, doves in loving companionship, sparrows, and\r\nhawks. I noticed also in one place a pair of elephant's ears perfect as\r\nlife. Indeed it was not difficult to believe that these stony semblances\r\nhad once been endowed with life, and, ere blight or decay could change,\r\nhad been transmuted into things of imperishable beauty.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for our guide to unmoor the boat, which was to take us\r\nover the lake a second time, I ran up the bank to look at the\r\nstalactites that hung in the greatest profusion above the water. The\r\nlight of my lamp shining through them produced an effect as surprising\r\nas it was beautiful. But no words can do justice to the scene. Imagine\r\nan immense room whose ceiling is studded with icicles forming every\r\nconceivable curve and angle, and you will have only a faint idea of the\r\nnumber and variety of these subterranean ornaments.\r\n\r\nA mile from the entrance we found some stray bats,--the first living\r\ncreatures we had met. We endeavored to attract them by holding up our\r\nlamps, and succeeded so well that we were glad to leave them behind us\r\nas soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact, noted by other cave-explorers, and confirmed by\r\nour own experience, that while within a cave one's usual vigor and\r\nactivity appears augmented. A slight reaction takes place on coming out\r\ninto the upper world, and renders rest doubly refreshing and grateful.\r\n\r\nLet me, in closing, advise other visitors to Howe's Cave to choose _fair\r\nweather, and take time enough_ for their visit, as the windings of the\r\ncave and its curiosities are alike exhaustless.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPOTENTIAL MOODS\r\n\r\n\r\n      I sit and dream\r\n  Of the time that prophets have long foretold,\r\n  Of an age surpassing the age of gold,\r\n  Which the eyes of the selfish can never behold,\r\n      When truth and love shall be owned supreme.\r\n\r\n      I think and weep\r\n  O'er the thousands oppressed by sin and woe,\r\n  O'er the long procession of those who go,\r\n  Through ignorance, error, and passions low,\r\n      To the unsought bed of their dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\n      I wait and long\r\n  For the sway of justice, the rule of right;\r\n  For the glad diffusion of wisdom's light;\r\n  For the triumph of liberty over might;\r\n      For the day when the weak shall be free from the strong.\r\n\r\n      I work and sing\r\n  To welcome the dawn of the fairer day,\r\n  When crime and sin shall have passed away,\r\n  When men shall live as well as they pray,\r\n      And earth with the gladness of heaven shall ring.\r\n\r\n      I trust and hope\r\n  In the tide of God's love that unceasingly rolls,\r\n  In the dear words of promise that bear up our souls,\r\n  In the tender compassion that sweetly consoles,\r\n      When in death's darkened valley we tremblingly grope.\r\n\r\n      I toil and pray\r\n  For the beauty excelling all forms of art;\r\n  For the blessing that comes to the holy heart;\r\n  For the hope that foretells, and seems a part\r\n      Of the life and joy of the heavenly day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE INTEREST OF NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a litigious, quarrelsome, fighting animal, man is very fond of\r\npeace. He began to shed blood almost as soon as he began to go alone in\r\ncompany with his nearest relatives; and when Abel asked of Cain, 'Am I\r\nnot a man and a brother?' the latter, instead of giving him the hug\r\nfraternal, did beat him to death. Cain's only object, it should seem,\r\nwas a quiet life, and Abel had disturbed his repose by setting up a\r\nhigher standard of excellence than the elder brother could afford to\r\nmaintain. It was only to 'conquer a peace' that Cain thus acted. He\r\ndesired 'indemnity for the past and security for the future,' and so he\r\ntook up arms against his brother and ended him. He loved peace, but he\r\ndid not fear war, because he was the stronger party of the two, his\r\nweapons being as ready for action as the British navy is ready for it\r\nto-day; and Abel was as defenceless as we were a twelvemonth ago. Cain\r\nis the type of all mankind, who know that peace is better than war, but\r\nwho rush into war under the pressure of envy and pride. Ancient as\r\nviolence is, it is not so old as peace; and it is for peace that all\r\nwars are made, at least by organized communities. All peoples have in\r\ntheir minds the idea of a golden age, not unlike to that time so vividly\r\ndescribed by Hesiod, when men were absolutely good, and therefore happy;\r\nliving in perfect accord on what the earth abundantly gave them,\r\nsuffering neither illness nor old age, and dying as calmly as they had\r\nlived. Historical inquiry has so far shaken belief in the existence of\r\nany such time as that painted by the poet, that men have agreed to place\r\nit in the future. It has never been, but it is to be. It will come with\r\nthat 'coming man,' who travels so slowly, and will be by him\r\ninaugurated, a boundless millennial time. In the mean time contention\r\nprevails; 'war's unequal game' is played with transcendent vigor, and at\r\na cost that would frighten the whole human race into madness were it\r\nincurred for any other purpose. But, while fighting, men have kept their\r\neyes steadily fixed upon peace, which is to be the reward of their valor\r\nand their pecuniary sacrifices. Every warlike time has been followed by\r\na period in which strenuous exertions have been made to make peace\r\nperpetual. Never was there a more profound desire felt for peace than\r\nthat which prevailed among the Romans of the Augustan age, after a\r\nseries of civil and foreign wars yet unparalleled in the history of\r\nhuman struggles. One poet could denounce the first forger of the iron\r\nsword as being truly brutal and iron-hearted; and another could declare\r\nit to be the 'mission' of the Romans only to impose terms of peace upon\r\nbarbarians, who should be compelled to accept quiet as a boon, or endure\r\nit as a burden. Strange sentiments were these to proceed from the land\r\nof the legions, but they expressed the current Roman opinion, which\r\npreferred even dishonor to war. So was it after the settlement of Europe\r\nin 1815. A generation that had grown up in the course of the greatest of\r\nmodern contests produced the most determined and persistent advocates of\r\nthe 'peace-at-any-price' policy; and for forty years peace was preserved\r\nbetween the principal Christian nations, through the exertions of\r\nstatesmen, kings, philanthropists, and economists, who, if they could\r\nagree in nothing else, were almost unanimous in the opinion that war was\r\nan expensive folly, and that the first duty of a government was to\r\nprevent its subjects from becoming military-mad. Perhaps there never was\r\na happier time in Christendom than it knew between the autumn of 1815\r\nand the spring of 1854, after Napoleon had gone down and before Nicholas\r\nhad set himself up to dictate law to the world. It was the modern age of\r\nthe Antonines, into which was crowded more true enjoyment than mankind\r\nhad known for centuries; and they are beginning to learn its excellence\r\nfrom its loss,--war raging now in the New World, while Europe lives in\r\nhourly expectation of its occurrence. There were wars, and cruel wars,\r\ntoo, in those years, but they faintly affected Europe and the United\r\nStates, and probably added something to men's happiness, for the same\r\nreason that a storm to which we are not exposed increases our sense of\r\ncomfort. Their thunders were remote, and they furnished materials for\r\nthe journals. So we saw a Providence in them, and thanked Heaven, some\r\nof us, that we no longer furnished examples of the folly of contention.\r\n\r\nThe friends of peace were actuated by various motives. With statesmen\r\nand politicians peace was preferred because it was cheaper than war, and\r\nall countries were burdened with debt. England has sometimes been\r\npraised because she so uniformly threw her influence on the side of\r\npeace, after she had accomplished her purpose in the war against\r\nimperial France. Time and again, she might have waged popular wars, and\r\nin which she would have probably been successful; but she would help\r\nneither the Spaniards against France and the Holy Alliance, nor the\r\nTurks against the Russians, nor the Poles against the Czar, nor the\r\nHungarians against the Austrians, nor the Italians against the Kaiser,\r\nnor the Greeks against the Turks. She settled all her disputes with the\r\nUnited States by negotiation, and showed no disposition to fight with\r\nFrance, except when she had all the rest of Europe on her side. But this\r\npraise has not been deserved. England did not quarrel with powerful\r\ncountries, because she could not afford to enter upon costly warfare.\r\nShe had gone to the extent of her means when her debt had reached to\r\nfour thousand million dollars, and she could not increase that debt\r\nlargely until she should also have increased her wealth. Time was\r\nrequired to add to her means, and to lessen her debt; and to such a\r\nstate had her finances been reduced, that it is now twenty years since\r\nshe began to derive a portion of her revenue from an income tax, which,\r\nimposed in the time of peace, was increased when war became inevitable.\r\nThe bonds she had given to keep the peace were too great to admit of her\r\nbreaking it. She did not fight, because she doubted her ability to fight\r\nsuccessfully. She had no wish to behold another suspension of cash\r\npayments by her national bank; and a general war would be sure to bring\r\nsuspension. But she was as ready as she had ever been to contend with\r\nthe weak. The Chinese and the Afghans did not find her very forbearing,\r\nthough with neither of those peoples had she any just cause for war.\r\n\r\nWith the disunited States she has been as prompt to quarrel as she was\r\nslow to contend with the United States; and now she is one of the high\r\ncontracting parties to the crusade against Mexico. We say nothing of the\r\nSepoy war, for that was a contest for 'empire,' as Earl Russell would\r\nsay. She could not, in the days of Clyde, give up what she had acquired\r\nin the days of Clive; and no one ought to blame her for what she did in\r\nIndia, though it can not be denied that the mutiny was the consequence\r\nof her own bad conduct in the East. With Russia, Austria, and Prussia to\r\nback her, in 1840, she went to the verge of a war with France; but, in\r\nso doing, the government did that which the English nation by no means\r\nwarmly approved; and the fall of the whig ministry, in 1841, was in no\r\nsmall part due to Lord Palmerston's policy in the preceding year. The\r\nRussian war was brought about by the action of the English people, who\r\nwere angry with the Czar because his empire had the first place in\r\nEurope. The government would have prevented that war from breaking out\r\nif it could, but popular pressure was too strong for it, and it had to\r\ngive way. The event has proved that the English government was wiser\r\nthan were the English people, France alone having gained anything from\r\nthe departure from what had become the policy of Europe; and for France\r\nto gain is not altogether for the benefit of England.\r\n\r\nOf the motives of the philanthropists, we have little to say. They are\r\nalways respectable, and it is a pity that the world should be too wicked\r\nto appreciate them. But those of the economists are open to remark, and\r\nthe more so because there has been so much claimed for them. They\r\nreduced everything to a matter of interest. Peace, they reasoned, is for\r\nthe welfare of all men; and, if an enlightened self-interest could be\r\nmade to prevail the world over, war would be rendered an impossibility.\r\nWars between civilized countries have mostly grown out of mistaken views\r\nof interest on the part of governments and peoples. Once enlighten both\r\nrulers and ruled, and make them understand that war can not pay, and\r\nselfishness will accomplish what religion, and morality, and\r\nbenevolence, and common sense have failed to accomplish. Cutting throats\r\nmay be a very agreeable pastime; but no man ever yet paid for anything\r\nmore than it was worth, with his eyes wide open to the fact that he was\r\nnot buying a bargain, but selling himself. Nations would be as wise as\r\nindividuals, unless it be true that the sum of intelligence is not so\r\ngreat as the items that compose it; and when it should have been made\r\nindisputably clear that to make war was to make losses, while peace\r\nshould be as indisputably profitable, there would be no further occasion\r\nto expend, annually, immense sums upon the support of great armaments,\r\nsuch as were not kept up, even in times of war, by the potentates of\r\nearlier days. The reason of mankind was to be appealed to, and they were\r\nto be made saints through the use of practical logic. Neighborhood,\r\ninstead of being regarded as cause for enmity, was to be held as ground\r\nfor good feeling and liberal intercourse. Under the old system it had\r\nbeen the custom to call France and England 'natural enemies,' words that\r\nattributed to the Creator the origin of discord. Under the new system,\r\nthose great countries were to become the best of friends, as well as the\r\nclosest of neighbors; and one generation of free commerce was to do away\r\nwith the effects of five centuries of disputes and warfare. England was\r\nto forget the part which France took in the first American war, and\r\nFrance was to cease to recollect that there had been such days as Crecy\r\nand Agincourt, Vittoria and Waterloo; and also that England had\r\noverthrown her rule in North America, and driven her people from India.\r\nBut it was not France and England only that were to enter within the\r\ncharmed circle; all nations were to be admitted into it, and the whole\r\nworld was to fraternize. It was to be Arcadia in a ring-fence, an\r\nArcadia solidly based upon heavy profits, with consols, _rentes_, and\r\nother public securities--which in other times had a bad fashion of\r\nbecoming very insecure--always at a good premium. Quarter-day was to be\r\nthe day for which all other days were made, and it would never be\r\ndarkened by the imposition of new taxes, by repudiation, or by any other\r\nof those things that so often have lessened the felicity of the\r\nfund-holder.\r\n\r\nThat the new Temple of Peace might be enabled to rise in proper\r\nproportions, it became necessary to destroy some old edifices, and to\r\nremove what was considered to be very rubbishy rubbish. Protection,\r\ntariffs, and so forth, once worshiped as evidences of ancestral wisdom,\r\nwere to be got rid of with all possible speed, and free trade was to be\r\nsubstituted, that is, trade as free as was compatible with the raising\r\nof enormous revenues, made necessary by the foolish wars of the past. In\r\ndue time, perfect freedom of trade would be had; but a blessing of that\r\nmagnitude could not be expected to come at once to the relief of a\r\nsuffering world. England, which had taken the lead in supporting\r\nprotection, and whose commercial system had been of the most illiberal\r\nand sordid character, became the leader in the grand reform, pushing the\r\nwork vigorously forward, and, with her usual consideration for the\r\nfeelings and rights of others, ordering the nations of Europe and\r\nAmerica to follow her example. She had discovered that she had been all\r\nin the wrong since the day when Oliver St. John's wounded pride led him\r\nto the conclusion that it was the duty of every patriotic Englishman to\r\ndo his best to destroy the commerce of Holland. She was very impatient\r\nof those peoples who were shy of imitating her, forgetting that her\r\nconduct through six generations had made a strong impression on the\r\nworld's mind, and that her sudden conversion could not immediately avail\r\nagainst her long persistence in sinning against political economy, if\r\nindeed she had so sinned; and the question was one that admitted of some\r\ndispute, free trade being but an experiment. Gradually, however, men\r\ncame round to the British view, in theory at least; and among the\r\nintelligent classes it was admitted that commerce without restriction\r\nwas the true policy of nations, which must be gradually adopted as the\r\nbasis of all future action, due regard to be paid to those potent\r\ndisturbing forces, vested interests. France was slow to yield in\r\npractice, though she had produced some of the cleverest of economical\r\nwriters; for she is as little given to change in matters of business as\r\nshe is ready to rush into political revolutions. But even France at last\r\ngave signs of her intention to abandon her ancient practice in deference\r\nto modern theories; and Napoleon III. and Mr. Cobden laid their wise\r\nheads together to form plans for the completion of the 'cordial\r\nunderstanding,' on the basis of free trade. Less than forty years had\r\nsufficed to effect a gradual change of human opinion, and protection\r\nseemed about to be sent to that limbo in which witchcraft, alchemy, and\r\njudicial astrology have been so long undisturbedly reposing.\r\n\r\nDeath, we are told, found his way into Arcadia; and disappointment was\r\nnot long in coming to disturb the modern Arcadians, who had as much to\r\ndo with cotton as their predecessors with wool. The dream of universal\r\npeace, a peace that was to endure because based on enlightened\r\nselfishness,--that is to say on buying in cheap markets and selling in\r\ndear ones,--was as rudely dispelled as had been all earlier dreams of\r\nthe kind. Interest, it was found, could no more make men live lovingly\r\ntogether than principle could cause them to do so in by-gone times. If\r\nthere were two nations that might have been insured not to fight each\r\nother, because interest was sufficient to prevent men from having resort\r\nto war, those nations were Russia and England. They were in no sense\r\nrivals, according to the definition of rivalry in the circles of\r\ncommerce. Between them there was much buying and selling, to the great\r\nprofit of both. England is an old nation, with the arts of industry\r\ndeveloped among her people to an extent that is elsewhere unknown. The\r\ndivision of labor that prevails among her working people is so extensive\r\nand so minute, that in that respect she defies comparison. Other\r\ncountries may have as skillful laborers as she possesses, but their\r\nindustry is of a far less various character. Russia is a new country,\r\nand she requires what England has to dispose of; and England finds her\r\naccount in purchasing the raw materials that are so abundantly produced\r\nin Russia. Commercially speaking, therefore, these two nations could not\r\nfall out, could not quarrel, could not fight, if they would. In all\r\nother respects, too, they could be counted upon to set a good example to\r\nall other communities. They had more than once been allies, each had\r\ndone the other good services at critical tunes, and they had had the\r\nforemost places in that grand alliance which had twice dethroned\r\nNapoleon I. The exceptions to their general good understanding belong to\r\nthose exceptions which are supposed to be useful in proving a given\r\nrule. When the tory rulers of England became alarmed because of the\r\nsuccess of Catharine II. in her second Turkish war, and proposed doing\r\nwhat was done more than sixty years later,--to assist the Osmanlis,--the\r\nopposition to their policy became so powerful that even the strong\r\nministry of William Pitt had to listen to its voice; which shows that\r\nthe tendency of English opinion was then favorable to Russia. The\r\nhostility of Czar Paul to England, in his last days, is attributed to\r\nthe failure of his mind; and the immediate resumption of good relations\r\nbetween the two countries after his death, establishes the fact that the\r\nEnglish and the Russians were not sharers in the Czar's feelings. During\r\nthe five years that followed Tilsit, Russia appeared to be the enemy of\r\nEngland, and war existed for some time between the two empires; but this\r\nwas owing to the ascendency of the French, Alexander having to choose\r\nbetween England and France. The nominal enemies did each other as little\r\ninjury as possible; and, in 1812, they became greater friends than ever.\r\nMost Englishmen were probably of Lord Holland's opinion, that England's\r\ninterest dictated a Russian connection; and in the eighteenth century\r\nEngland was, in some sense, the nursing mother of the new empire, though\r\nonce or twice she was inclined to do as other nurses have\r\ndone,--administer some punishment to the rude and healthy child she was\r\nfostering, and not without reason. So harmonious had been the relations\r\nof these two magnificent states, that an eminent Russian author, Dr.\r\nHamel, writing in 1846, could say: 'Nearly three hundred years have now\r\nelapsed since England greeted Muscovy at the mouth of the Dwina. So\r\ngreat have been the benefits to trade, the arts, and industry in\r\ngeneral, arising from the friendly relations between England and Russia,\r\nwhich, in 1853, will have completed the third century of their\r\ncontinuance, that one might expect to see this period closed, in both\r\ncountries, with a jubilee to commemorate so remarkable an example of\r\nuninterrupted amicable intercourse between nations.' The year 1853 came;\r\nbut, instead of being a jubilee to the old friends of three centuries'\r\nstanding, it brought the beginning of that contest which is known as the\r\nRussian war. That was a proper way, indeed, to notice the happy return\r\nof the three-hundredth anniversary of the establishment of\r\n'uninterrupted amicable intercourse' between the nations, whose soldiers\r\nwere soon slaughtering each other with as much energy as if they had\r\nbeen 'natural enemies' from immemorial time. Interest had no power to\r\nturn aside the storm of war. The English people were angry with Russia\r\nbecause the iron-willed Czar had carried matters in Europe with a very\r\nhigh hand, and was, in fact, virtually master of the Old World, and\r\nsuspected of being on uncommonly good terms with the masters of the New\r\nWorld. Nicholas had succeeded to the place of Napoleon in their ill\r\ngraces. They liked the Cossackry of the one as little as they had liked\r\nthe cannonarchy of the other. It was a case of pure jealousy. Russia was\r\ntoo powerful to suit the English idea of the fitness of things, and\r\ntherefore it was necessary that she should be chastised and humbled.\r\nFear of Russia there could have been none in the English mind. It has\r\nbeen thought that England contended for the safety of her Eastern\r\ndominions; but then the Czar offered her Egypt and Candia, possession of\r\nwhich would not only have much strengthened her Indian empire, but have\r\nbeen the means of making her more powerful at home. Nothing better could\r\nhave been offered for her acceptance, if valuable territories would have\r\nsatisfied her feelings; and much praise has been bestowed upon her\r\nbecause she did not close with the Czar's proposition 'to share and\r\nshare alike' the lands of the House of Othman; but that praise is not\r\nquite deserved, the desire not to see Russia aggrandized being a\r\nstronger sentiment with her than was the desire to aggrandize herself.\r\nHad the question been left for British statesmen alone to settle,--had\r\nthe British premier been as free to act for England as the Czar was for\r\nRussia,--poor, sick Turkey would have been cut and carved most\r\nexpeditiously and artistically; she would have been partitioned as\r\nperfectly as Poland, and Abdul Medjid would have experienced the fate of\r\nStanislaus Poniatowski. But English ministers hold power only on\r\ncondition of doing the will of the English nation, and that nation had\r\ncontracted an aversion to Russia that was uncontrollable, and before its\r\nhostility its ministers had to give way, slowly and reluctantly; and the\r\nhalf-measures they adopted, like the half-measures of our own government\r\ntoward the secessionists, explain the disasters of the war. The English\r\npeople were determined that there should be an end, for the time at\r\nleast, to the Russian hegemony, and threw themselves into the arms of\r\nFrance with a vivacity that would have astonished any other French ruler\r\nbut Napoleon III., who had lived among them, and who knew them well. The\r\nwar was waged, and, when over, what had England gained? Nothing solid,\r\nit must be admitted. The territory of Russia remained unimpaired, and\r\nthere is not the slightest evidence that her influence in the East was\r\nlessened by the partial destruction of Sebastopol. The Russian navy of\r\nthe Euxine had ceased to exist; but as it consisted principally of\r\nvessels that were not adapted to the purposes of modern warfare, the\r\nloss of the Russians in that respect was not of a very serious\r\ncharacter. Russia's European leadership was suspended; but her power and\r\nher resources, which, if properly employed, must soon reinstate her,\r\nwere not damaged. England _had_ fought for an idea, and had fought in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nFrance had as little interest in the Russian war as England, and the\r\nFrench people had no wish to fight the Czar. They would have preferred\r\nfighting the English, in connection with the Czar,--an arrangement that\r\nwould have been more profitable to their country. But the emperor had a\r\nquarrel with his arrogant brother at St. Petersburgh, and he availed\r\nhimself of the opportunity afforded by that brother's obstinacy to teach\r\nhim a lesson from which he did not live to profit. Nicholas had cut the\r\nnew emperor, and had caused him to be taboo'd by most of the sovereigns\r\nof Europe; and the Frenchman determined to cut his way to consideration.\r\nThis he was enabled to do, with the aid of the English; and ever since\r\nthe war's close he has held the place which became vacant on the death\r\nof Nicholas--that of Europe's arbiter. The French fought well, as they\r\nalways do, but their heart was not in the war. The emperor had the war\r\nparty pretty much to himself. Exactly the opposite state of things\r\nexisted in France to that which existed in England. In the former\r\ncountry, the government was for war, and the people were for peace; in\r\nthe latter, the government was for peace, and the people were for war.\r\nIn each country power was in the hands of the war party, and so war was\r\nmade, in spite of the wishes of the French people and of English\r\nstatesmen. When Napoleon III. had accomplished _his_ purpose, he ordered\r\nthe English to make peace, and peace was made. In this way he satisfied\r\nhis subjects, showing them that he had no intention of making England\r\nmore powerful than she had been, or Russia weaker. He had prevented\r\nRussia from extending her dominion, but he had also prevented England\r\nfrom lessening that dominion.\r\n\r\nThe Italian war was waged in opposition to the sentiments of the French\r\npeople, which was one of the leading causes of its sudden termination,\r\nwith its object, only half accomplished, and much to the damage of the\r\nemperor's reputation for statesmanship and courage. Whether, in a\r\ncomprehensive sense, that war was entered upon for purposes adverse to\r\nthe interests of France, may well be doubted; but it is certain that it\r\nwas an unpopular measure in that country. The French had no objection to\r\nthe humiliation of Austria; but it would be a grave error to suppose\r\nthat they have any wish to behold Italy united and powerful. The kingdom\r\nof Italy, should it become all that is desired for it by its friends in\r\nthis country, would be to France a source of annoyance, and probably of\r\ndanger. The emperor's power was shaken by his Italian policy, and hence\r\nit was that he played the confederature game so long, to the\r\nastonishment of foreigners, and got possession of Savoy and Nice, to\r\nthe astonishment and anger of England; and hence it is that he is\r\nseeking Sardinia and other portions of Italy. Thus, the Italian war was\r\nbegun against the interests of the French people, or what that people\r\nbelieve to be their interests, though this is the age in which there is\r\nto be peace, because that is not to be broken except when popular\r\ninterests require that it shall no longer be preserved.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable instance of the fallacy of the idea that regard\r\nfor the true interests of nations must banish hostilities from the\r\nworld, is afforded by the coarse of France and England toward this\r\ncountry since the beginning of the secession war. Both those countries\r\nhave great interest not only in the preservation of peace _with_ the\r\nUnited States, but in the preservation of peace _in_ the United States;\r\nand yet they have done all that it lies in their power to do to\r\nencourage our rebels, and have been on the verge of war with us: and war\r\nwith them, and with Spain, is exported by many Americans, who judge of\r\nthe future by the present and the past. England had a vast trade with\r\nthe American Union, buying at the South, and selling to the North, and\r\nhence any disturbances here were sure to operate adversely to her\r\ninterests; but no sooner had it become apparent that our troubles were\r\nto be of a serious character, than her weight was thrown on to the side\r\nof the rebels, who never would have been able to do much but for the\r\nencouragement they have received from abroad. The trade of France was\r\nnot so great with America as that of England; yet it was valuable, and\r\nthe French have suffered much from its suspension, perhaps we should say\r\nits loss. The North has purchased but little from Europe for a year, and\r\nthe South has sold less to Europe in that time. There has been a trade\r\nin food between the North and some European countries, in which grain\r\nhas been exchanged for gold, though it would have been better for both\r\nparties could anything else than gold have been brought to America, true\r\ncommerce consisting in the interchange of commodities. For all the\r\nsufferings that have been experienced by Englishmen and Frenchmen, they\r\nhave none but themselves and their governments to censure. That peace\r\nhas not been preserved is not our fault; and the war that has been blown\r\ninto so fierce a flame has been fed from Europe; it has been fanned by\r\nbreezes from France and England. When it was first seen that there was\r\ndanger of civil war, the governments of those countries, if they had\r\nreally had any regard for the true interests of their countries, would\r\nhave discouraged the rebels in the most public and pointed manner\r\nimaginable, not because they cared for us, but for the simple reason\r\nthat they were bound so to act as should best promote the welfare of\r\ntheir own peoples. War in America meant suffering to the artisans and\r\nlaborers of Europe, who, thus far, have suffered more from the war than\r\nhave any portion of the American people, except the residents of\r\nSouthern cities. Napoleon III. and Lord Palmerston should have said to\r\nthe agents of the Confederacy, and have taken care to publish their\r\nwords, 'We can afford you neither aid in deeds nor encouragement in\r\nwords. Our relations with both sections of the American nation are such,\r\nthat our respective countries must suffer immensely from the course\r\nwhich you are about to pursue, not because you have been oppressed, or\r\nfear oppression, but because you have been beaten in an election, and\r\npower, for the time, has been taken from your hands. You ask us to act\r\nhostilely against the established government of the United States, that\r\ngovernment having given us no cause of offense,--to become the patrons\r\nof a revolution that has no cause, but the consequences of which may be\r\nboundless. To revolutions we are averse; and one of our governments\r\nexists in virtue of opposition to the party of disorder in Europe. You\r\nask us to do that which would lessen the means of livelihood to millions\r\nof our people; for, granting that you should succeed, still there would\r\nnecessarily be so great a change produced by your action, and by our\r\nintervention in American affairs, that for years America would not be\r\nthe good customer to France and England that she has been for a\r\ngeneration. With the merits of your cause we can have nothing to do, our\r\ntrue interests pointing to the maintenance of the strictest neutrality\r\nin the contest between you and the federal government; and the dictates\r\nof interest are fortified by the suggestions of principle. Your movement\r\nis essentially disorderly in its character, and it is undertaken\r\navowedly in the interest of slavery; and not only are we the supporters\r\nof the existing order of things the world over, but we are hostile to\r\nslavery, having abolished it in all parts of our dominions. Our advice\r\nto you is, to submit to the federal government, and to seek for the\r\nredress of your grievances, if such you have, by means recognized in the\r\nconstitution and laws of your country. From us you can receive no aid,\r\nand you should dismiss all expectation of it from your minds at once and\r\nforever. We are indifferent to the form of the American government, and\r\nits internal policy can not concern us; but the interests of our peoples\r\nrequire that we should live in peace with the people of America, whether\r\nthey be of the South or of the North, slave-holders or abolitionists;\r\nand we shall not quarrel with any portion of them for the sake of\r\nfacilitating the erection of a republic to be founded on the basis of\r\nthe divine nature of slavery, the first time that so preposterous a\r\npretension was ever put forward by the audacity or the impudence of\r\nmen.' Had something like this been said to the agents of the rebels, and\r\nhad the English press supported the same views, the rebellion would have\r\nbeen at an end ere this, and the commercial relations of America and\r\nEurope would have experienced no sensible interruption. English\r\ninterests, in an especial sense, demanded that the rebels should be\r\ndiscouraged, and discouragement from London would have rendered\r\nrebellion hopeless, and have promoted peace in Savannah and New Orleans.\r\n\r\nBut it was not in England's nature to pursue a course that would have\r\nbeen as much in harmony with her material interests as with that high\r\nmoral character which she claims as being peculiarly her own. There\r\nappeared to have presented itself an opportunity to effect the\r\ndestruction of the American Republic, and England could not resist the\r\ntemptation to strike us hard: and, for almost a year, she has been to\r\nthe Union a more deadly foe than we have found in the South. We do not\r\nallude to the _Trent_ question, for in that we were clearly in the\r\nwrong, and Mason and Slidell should have been released on the 16th of\r\nNovember, and not have been detained in captivity six weeks. Secretary\r\nSeward has placed the point so emphatically beyond all doubt, that we\r\nmust all be of one mind thereon, whether in England or America. England\r\nmight have been moderate in her action, in view of her repeated outrages\r\non the rights of neutrals, but no intelligent American can condemn her\r\nposition. It is to other things that we must look for evidence of her\r\ndetermination to effect our extinction as a nation. She has, while\r\ndripping with Hindoo blood, and while yet men's ears are filled with\r\naccounts of the blowing of sepoys from the muzzles of cannon by her\r\nmilitary executioners, absolutely demanded of us an acknowledgment of\r\nthe Southern Confederacy's independence, on the ground that it is\r\ninhuman to wage war for the maintenance of our national life. She has\r\ncompared our mild and forbearing government with the savage proconsulate\r\nof Alva in the Netherlands! She has charged us with waging war against\r\ncivilization, because we have employed stone fleets to close entrances\r\nto the harbor of Charleston, though her own history is full of instances\r\nof their employment for similar purposes! She has encouraged her traders\r\nand seamen to furnish the rebels with arms of all kinds, and stores of\r\nevery description! She has excluded our ships-of-war from her ports,\r\nrefusing to allow them to coal at places at which she had granted us the\r\nprivilege, in time of peace, of establishing stations for fuel! She has\r\ngiven shelter and protection to the privateers of the rebels, vessels\r\nthat had violated her own laws almost within sight of her own shores,\r\nand certainly within the narrow seas! She has acknowledged the\r\nbelligerent character of the South, which is virtually an acknowledgment\r\nof its independence, for none but nations can lawfully wage war. She\r\nhas, through her Minister for Foreign Affairs, declared that our war\r\nwith the secessionists is of the same character as the war which the\r\nSpaniards carried on with their American colonists, and that there is no\r\ndifference between it and the attempt of the Turks to subdue the Greeks!\r\nMonstrous perversions of history for even Earl Russell to be guilty of!\r\nHer leading periodicals and journals, with few exceptions, have\r\ndenounced our country, our course, and our government in the bitterest\r\nlanguage, and to the manifest encouragement of the rebels, who see in\r\ntheir language the rapid growth and prompt exhibition of a sentiment of\r\nhostility to this country, and which must, sooner or later, end in war;\r\nand war between England and America would be sure to lead to the success\r\nof the Confederates, even if we should come out of it victoriously.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the attempt to establish peace on the basis of the true\r\ninterests of nations has not only failed, but that it has failed\r\nsignally and deplorably. The solid Doric Temple of Mammon has no more\r\nbeen able to stand against the storms of war than has the Crystal Palace\r\nof Sentiment. The fair fabric which was the type of materialism has\r\nfallen, and it would be most unwise to seek its reconstruction. That\r\nwhich was to have stood as long and as firmly as the Pyramids has fallen\r\nbefore the first moss could gather upon it. Nor is the reason of this\r\nfall far to seek, as it lies upon the surface, and ought to have been\r\nanticipated--would have been, only that men are so ready to believe in\r\nwhat they wish to believe. England, as a nation, has two interests to\r\nconsult, and which do not always accord. She has her commercial interest\r\nand her imperial interest; and, when the two conflict, the last is sure\r\nto become first. Her position as a nation was threatened only by the\r\nUnited States and Russia. The dynastic disputes of France, which are far\r\nfrom being at an end, and the generally unsettled character of French\r\npolitics, must long prevent that country from becoming the permanent\r\nrival of England. France is great to-day, and England acts wisely in\r\npreparing to meet her in war; but to-morrow France may become weak, and\r\nher voice be feeble and her weight light in Europe and the world. Three\r\nhouses claim her throne, and the Republicans may start up into active\r\nlife again, as we saw they did in 1848. Neither Austria nor Prussia can\r\never furnish England cause of alarm. With Russia the case is very\r\ndifferent, as her government is solidly established; her resources are\r\nvast, and in the course of steady development, and her desire to\r\nestablish her supremacy in the East is a fixed idea with both rulers and\r\nruled. Unchecked, she would have thrown England into the background, and\r\nsupposing that she had resolved not to allow that country a share of the\r\nspoil of Turkey. The hard character and harsh policy of Nicholas ended\r\nin furnishing to England an opportunity to throw Russia herself into the\r\nbackground for the time, and that opportunity she made use of, but not\r\nto the extent that she had determined upon, owing to her dependence upon\r\nFrance, which became the shield of Russia after having been the sword of\r\nEngland. The United States were a formidable rival of England; and, but\r\nfor the breaking out of our troubles, we should have been far ahead of\r\nher by 1870, and perhaps have stripped her of all her American\r\npossessions. When those troubles began, she proceeded to take the same\r\nadvantage of them that she had taken of the Czar's blunder. To sever the\r\nAmerican nation in twain is her object, as some of her public men have\r\nfrankly avowed; and she believes that the disintegrating process, once\r\ncommenced, would not stop with the division of the country into the\r\nNorthern Union and the Southern Confederacy. She expects, should the\r\nSouth succeed, to see half a dozen republics here established, and is\r\nnot without hope that not even two States would remain together; and for\r\nthis hope she has very good foundation. The American nation destroyed,\r\nEngland would become as great in the West as she is in the East, and\r\nwould hold, with far greater means at her command, the same position\r\nthat was hers in the last days of George II., when the French had been\r\nexpelled from America and India. She would have no commercial rival, and\r\nthere would no longer be an American navy susceptible of gigantic\r\nincrease. She would be truly the sea's sovereign; and whoso rules the\r\nsea has power to dictate to the land. 'Whosoever commands the sea,' says\r\nSir Walter Raleigh, 'commands the trade of the world; whosoever commands\r\nthe trade of the world, commands the riches of the world, and\r\nconsequently the world itself.' England never would have gone to war\r\nwith the _United States_ to prevent their growth; but, now that they\r\nhave instituted civil war, it is certain that she will do all that lies\r\nin her power to prevent the reconstruction of the Union. The war of\r\nwords has been begun, and it is but preliminary to the war of swords.\r\nThe savage music of the British press is the overture to the opera. The\r\nmorality of England may be neither higher nor lower than that of all\r\nother countries,--may be no worse than our own,--but there is so much\r\nthat is offensive in her modes of exhibiting her destitution of\r\nprinciple, that she is more hated than all other powerful countries that\r\never have existed. She not only sins as badly as other nations, but\r\nmanages to make herself as odious for her manner of sinning as for the\r\nsins themselves. There is no crime that she is not capable of, if its\r\nperpetration be necessary to promote her own power. When Sir William\r\nReid was governor of Malta, he said to Mr. Lushington, 'I would let them\r\n(_i.e._ the heathen) set up Juggernaut in St. George's Square (in\r\nEdinburgh), if it were conducive to England's holding Malta.' And as\r\nthis time-blue Presbyterian was ready to allow the solemnization of the\r\nbloodiest rites of paganism in the most public place of the Christian\r\ncity of Edinburgh, if that kind of tolerance would be conducive to\r\nEngland's retention of Malta,--of which she holds possession, by the\r\nway, in consequence of one of the grossest breaches of faith mentioned\r\neven in her history,--so do we find the Christian people, peers, and\r\npriests of England ready to become the allies of slave-holders and the\r\nsupporters of slavery, if thereby the American Republic can be\r\ndestroyed, as they believe that its existence may become the source of\r\ndanger to the ascendency of their country.\r\n\r\nThe last intelligence from England allows us to believe that that\r\ncountry has adopted a more liberal policy, and that her government will\r\ndo nothing to aid the rebels. Some of the language of Ministers is\r\nfriendly, and altogether the change is one of a character that can not\r\nbe otherwise than agreeable to us. France, too, has declared her\r\nneutrality as strongly as England. These declarations were made before\r\nintelligence of our military and naval successes had reached Europe,\r\nwhich renders them all the more weighty. Peace between America and\r\nEurope may, therefore, be counted upon, unless some very great reverses\r\nshould befall our arms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAMONG THE PINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 'Ole Cabin' to which Jim had alluded as the scene of Sam's\r\npunishment by the Overseer, was a one-story shanty in the vicinity of\r\nthe stables. Though fast falling to decay, it had more the appearance of\r\na decent habitation than the other huts on the plantation. Its thick\r\nplank door was ornamented with a mouldy brass knocker, and its four\r\nwindows contained sashes, to which here and there clung a broken pane,\r\nthe surviving relic of its better days. It was built of large unhewn\r\nlogs, notched at the ends and laid one upon the other, with the bark\r\nstill on. The thick, rough coat which yet adhered in patches to the\r\ntimber had opened in the sun, and let the rain and the worm burrow in\r\nits sides, till some parts had crumbled entirely away. At one corner the\r\nprocess of decay had gone on till roof, superstructure, and foundation\r\nhad rotted down and left an opening large enough to admit a coach and\r\nfour horses. The huge chimneys which had graced the gable-ends of the\r\nbuilding were fallen in, leaving only a mass of sticks and clay to tell\r\nof their existence, and two wide openings to show how great a figure\r\nthey had once made in the world. A small space in front of the cabin\r\nwould have been a lawn, had the grass been willing to grow upon it; and\r\na few acres of cleared land in its rear might have passed for a garden,\r\nhad it not been entirely overgrown with young pines and stubble. This\r\nprimitive structure was once the 'mansion' of that broad plantation,\r\nand, before the production of turpentine came into fashion in that\r\nregion, its rude owner drew his support from its few surrounding acres,\r\nmore truly independent than the present aristocratic proprietor, who,\r\nraising only one article, and buying all his provisions, was forced to\r\ndraw his support from the Yankee or the Englishman.\r\n\r\nOnly one room, about forty feet square, occupied the interior of the\r\ncabin. It once contained several apartments, vestiges of which still\r\nremained, but the partitions had been torn away to fit it for its\r\npresent uses. What those uses were, a moment's observation showed me.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the floor, which was mostly rotted away, a space about\r\nfifteen feet square was covered with thick pine planking, strongly\r\nnailed to the beams. In the centre of this planking an oaken block was\r\nfirmly bolted, and to it was fastened a strong iron staple that held a\r\nlog-chain, to which was attached a pair of shackles. Above this, was a\r\nqueer frame-work of oak, somewhat resembling the contrivance for drying\r\nfruit I have seen in Yankee farm-houses. Attached to the rafters by\r\nstout pieces of timber, were two hickory poles, placed horizontally, and\r\nabout four feet apart, the lower one rather more than eight feet from\r\nthe floor. This was the whipping-rack, and hanging to it were several\r\nstout whips with short hickory handles, and long triple lashes. I took\r\none down for closer inspection, and found burned into the wood, in large\r\nletters, the words 'Moral Suasion.' I questioned the appropriateness of\r\nthe label, but the Colonel insisted with great gravity that the whip is\r\nthe only 'moral suasion' a darky is capable of understanding.\r\n\r\nWhen punishment is inflicted on one of the Colonel's negroes, his feet\r\nare confined in the shackles, his arms tied above his head, and drawn by\r\na stout cord up to one of the horizontal poles; then, his back bared to\r\nthe waist, and standing on tip-toe, with every muscle stretched to its\r\nutmost tension, he takes 'de lashes.'\r\n\r\nA more severe but more unusual punishment is the 'thumb-screw.' In this\r\na noose is passed around the negro's thumb and fore-finger, while the\r\ncord is thrown over the upper cross-pole, and the culprit is drawn up\r\ntill his toes barely touch the ground. In this position the whole\r\nweight of the body rests on the thumb and fore-finger. The torture is\r\nexcruciating, and strong, able-bodied men can endure it but a few\r\nmoments. The Colonel naively told me that he had discontinued its\r\npractice, as several of his _women_ had nearly lost the use of their\r\nhands, and been incapacited for field labor, by its too frequent\r\nrepetition. 'My ---- drivers,'[L] he added, 'have no discretion, and no\r\nhumanity; if they have a pique against a nigger, they show him no\r\nmercy.'\r\n\r\nThe old shanty I have described was now the place of the Overseer's\r\nconfinement. Open as it was at top, bottom, and sides, it seemed an\r\nunsafe prison-house; but Jim had rendered its present occupant secure by\r\nplacing 'de padlocks on him.'\r\n\r\n'Where did you catch him?' asked the Colonel of Jim, as, followed by\r\nevery darky on the plantation, we took our way to the old building.\r\n\r\n'In de swamp, massa. We got Sandy and de dogs arter him--dey treed him,\r\nbut he fit like de debil.'\r\n\r\n'Any one hurt?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, Cunnel; he knifed Yaller Jake, and ef I hadn't a gibin him a\r\nwiper, you'd a had anudder nigger short dis mornin'--shore.'\r\n\r\n'How was it? tell me,' said his master, while we paused, and the darkies\r\ngathered around.\r\n\r\n'Wal, yer see, massa, we got de ole debil's hat dat he drapped wen you\r\nhad him down; den we went to Sandy's fur de dogs--dey scented him to\r\nonst, and off dey put for de swamp. 'Bout twenty on us follored 'em.\r\nHe'd a right smart start on us, and run like a deer, but de hounds\r\nkotched up wid him 'bout whar he shot pore Sam. He fit 'em and cut up de\r\nLady awful, but ole Caesar got a hole ob him, and sliced a breakfuss out\r\nob his legs. Somehow, dough, he got away from de ole dog, and clum a\r\ntree. 'T was more'n an hour afore we kotched up; but dar he war, and de\r\nhouns baying 'way as ef dey know'd wat an ole debil he am. I'd tuk one\r\nob de guns--you warn't in de hous, massa, so I cudn't ax you.'\r\n\r\n'Never mind that; go on,' said the Colonel.\r\n\r\n'Wal, I up wid de gun, and tole him ef he didn't cum down I'd gib him\r\nsuffin' dat 'ud sot hard on de stummuk. It tuk him a long w'ile, but--he\r\n_cum down_.' Here the darky showed a row of ivory that would have been a\r\nfair capital for a metropolitan dentist.\r\n\r\n'Wen he war down,' he resumed, 'Jake war gwine to tie him, but de ole\r\n'gator, quicker dan a flash, put a knife enter him.'\r\n\r\n'Is Jake much hurt?' interrupted the Colonel.\r\n\r\n'Not bad, massa; de knife went fru his arm, and enter his ribs, but de\r\nma'am hab fix him up, and she say he'll be 'round bery sudden.'\r\n\r\n'Well, what then?' inquired the Colonel.\r\n\r\n'Wen de ole debil seed he hadn't finished Jake, he war gwine to gib him\r\nanoder dig, but jus den I drap de gun on his cocoa-nut, and he neber\r\ntrubble us no more. 'Twar mons'rous hard work to git him out ob de\r\nswamp, 'cause he war jes like a dead man, and we had to tote him de hull\r\nway; but he'm dar now, massa (pointing to the old cabin), and de\r\nbracelets am on him.'\r\n\r\n'Where is Jake?' asked the Colonel.\r\n\r\n'Dunno, massa, but reckon he'm to hum.'\r\n\r\n'One of you boys go and bring him to the cabin,' said the Colonel.\r\n\r\nA negro-man went off on the errand, while we and the darkies resumed our\r\nway to the Overseer's quarters. Arrived there, I witnessed a scene that\r\nwords can not picture.\r\n\r\nStretched at full length on the floor, his clothes torn to shreds, his\r\ncoarse carroty hair matted with blood, and his thin, ugly visage pale as\r\ndeath, lay the Overseer. Bending over him, wiping away the blood from\r\nhis face, and swathing a ghastly wound on his forehead, was the negress\r\nSue; while at his shackled feet, binding up his still bleeding legs,\r\nknelt the octoroon woman.\r\n\r\n'Is _she_ here?' I said, involuntarily, as I caught sight of the group.\r\n\r\n'It's her nature,' said the Colonel, with a pleasant smile; 'if Moye\r\nwere the devil himself, she'd do him good if she could; another such\r\nwoman never lived.'\r\n\r\nAnd yet this woman, with all the instincts that make her sex\r\nangel-ministers to man, lived in daily violation of the most sacred of\r\nall laws,--because she was a slave. Will Mr. Caleb Cushing or Charles\r\nO'Conner please tell us why the Almighty invented a system which forces\r\nhis creatures to break the laws of His own making?\r\n\r\n'Don't waste your time on him, Alice,' said the Colonel, kindly; 'he\r\nisn't worth the rope that'll hang him.'\r\n\r\n'He was bleeding to death; he must have care or he'll die,' said the\r\noctoroon woman.\r\n\r\n'Then let him die, d---- him,' replied the Colonel, advancing to where\r\nthe Overseer lay, and bending down to satisfy himself of his condition.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile more than two hundred dusky forms crowded around and filled\r\nevery opening of the old building. Every conceivable emotion, except\r\npity, was depicted on their dark faces. The same individuals whose\r\ncloudy visages a half-hour before I had seen distended with a wild mirth\r\nand careless jollity, that made me think them really the docile,\r\ngood-natured animals they are said to be, now glared on the prostrate\r\nOverseer with the infuriated rage of aroused beasts when springing on\r\ntheir prey.\r\n\r\n'You can't come the possum here. Get up, you ---- hound,' said the\r\nColonel, rising and striking the bleeding man with his foot.\r\n\r\nThe fellow raised himself on one elbow and gazed around with a stupid,\r\nvacant look. His eye wandered unsteadily for a moment from the Colonel\r\nto the throng of cloudy faces in the doorway; then, his recent\r\nexperience flashing upon him, he shrieked out, clinging wildly to the\r\nskirts of the octoroon woman, who was standing near, 'Keep off them\r\ncursed hounds,--keep them off, I say--they'll kill me!--they'll kill\r\nme!'\r\n\r\nOne glance satisfied me that his mind was wandering. The blow on the\r\nhead had shattered his reason, and made the strong man less than a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n'You shan't be killed yet,' said the Colonel. 'You've a small account to\r\nsettle with me before you reckon with the devil.'\r\n\r\nAt this moment the dark crowd in the doorway parted, and Jake entered,\r\nhis arm bound up and in a sling.\r\n\r\n'Jake, come here,' said the Colonel; 'this man would have killed you.\r\nWhat shall we do with him?'\r\n\r\n''Tain't fur a darky to say dat, massa,' said the negro, evidently\r\nunaccustomed to the rude administration of justice which the Colonel was\r\nabout to inaugurate; 'he did wuss dan dat to Sam, mass--he orter swing\r\nfor shootin' him.'\r\n\r\n'That's _my_ affair; we'll settle your account first,' replied the\r\nColonel.\r\n\r\nThe darky looked undecidedly at his master, and then at the Overseer,\r\nwho, overcome by weakness, had sunk again to the floor. The little\r\nhumanity in him was evidently struggling with his hatred of Moye and his\r\ndesire of revenge, when the old nurse yelled out from among the crowd,\r\n'Gib him fifty lashes, Massa Davy, and den you wash him down.[M] Be a\r\nman, Jake, and say dat.'\r\n\r\nJake still hesitated, and when at last he was about to speak, the eye of\r\nthe octoroon woman caught his, and chained the words to his tongue, as\r\nif by magnetic power.\r\n\r\n'Do you say that, boys;' said the Colonel, turning to the other negroes;\r\n'shall he have fifty lashes?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa, fifty lashes--gib de ole debil fifty lashes,' shouted about\r\nfifty voices.\r\n\r\n'He shall have them,' quietly said the master.\r\n\r\nThe mad shout that followed, which was more like the yell of demons than\r\nthe cry of men, seemed to arouse the Overseer to a sense of the real\r\nstate of affairs. Springing to his feet, he gazed wildly around; then,\r\nsinking on his knees before the octoroon, and clutching the folds of her\r\ndress, he shrieked, 'Save me, good lady, save me! as you hope for mercy,\r\nsave me!'\r\n\r\nNot a muscle of her face moved, but, turning to the excited crowd, she\r\nmildly said, 'Fifty lashes would kill him. _Jake_ does not say\r\nthat--your master leaves it to him, and he will not whip a dying\r\nman--will you, Jake?'\r\n\r\n'No, ma'am--not--not ef you go agin it,' replied the negro, with very\r\nevident reluctance.\r\n\r\n'But he whipped Sam, ma'am, when he was nearer dead than _he_ am,' said\r\nJim, whose station as house-servant allowed him a certain freedom of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n'Because he was brutal to Sam, should you be brutal to him? Can you\r\nexpect me to tend you when you are sick, if you beat a dying man? Does\r\nPompey say you should do such things?' said the lady.\r\n\r\n'No, good ma'am,' said the old preacher, stepping out, with the freedom\r\nof an old servant, from the black mass, and taking his stand beside me\r\nin the open space left for the 'w'ite folks;' 'de ole man dusn't say\r\ndat, ma'am; he tell 'em de Lord want 'em to forgib dar en'mies--to lub\r\ndem dat pursyskute em;' then, turning to the Colonel, he added, as he\r\npassed his hand meekly over his thin crop of white wool and threw his\r\nlong heel back, 'ef massa'll 'low me I'll talk to 'em.'\r\n\r\n'Fire away,' said the Colonel, with evident chagrin. 'This is a nigger\r\ntrial; if you want to screen the d---- hound you can do it.'\r\n\r\n'I dusn't want to screed him, massa, but I'se bery ole and got soon to\r\ngwo, and I dusn't want de blessed Lord to ax me wen I gets dar why I\r\n'lowed dese pore ig'nant brack folks to mudder a man 'fore my bery face.\r\nI toted you, massa, fore you cud gwo, I'se worked for you till I can't\r\nwork no more; and I dusn't want to tell de Lord dat _my_ massa let a\r\nbrudder man be killed in cole blood.'\r\n\r\n'He is no brother of mine, you old fool; preach to the nigs, don't\r\npreach to me,' said the Colonel, stifling his displeasure, and striding\r\noff through the black crowd, without saying another word.\r\n\r\nHere and there in the dark mass a face showed signs of relenting; but\r\nmuch the larger number of that strange jury, had the question been put,\r\nwould have voted--DEATH.\r\n\r\nThe old preacher turned to them as the Colonel passed out, and said, 'My\r\nchil'ren, would you hab dis man whipped, so weak, so dyin' as he am, of\r\nhe war brack?'\r\n\r\n'No, not ef he war a darky--fer den he wouldn't be such an ole debil,'\r\nreplied Jim, and about a dozen of the other negroes.\r\n\r\n'De w'ite ain't no wuss dan de brack--dey'm all 'like--pore sinners all\r\nob 'em. De Lord wudn't whip a w'ite man no sooner dan a brack one--He\r\ntinks de w'ite juss so good as de brack (good Southern doctrine, I\r\nthought). De porest w'ite trash wudn't strike a man wen he war down.'\r\n\r\n'We'se had 'nough of dis, ole man,' said a large, powerful negro (one of\r\nthe drivers), stepping forward, and, regardless of the presence of Madam\r\nP---- and myself, pressing close to where the Overseer lay, now totally\r\nunconscious of what was passing around him. 'You needn't preach no more;\r\nde Cunnul hab say we'm to whip ole Moye, and we'se gwine to do it, by\r\n----.'\r\n\r\nI felt my fingers closing on the palm of my hand, and in a second more\r\nthey would have cut the darky's profile, had not Madam P---- cried out,\r\n'Stand back, you impudent fellow: say another word, and I'll have you\r\nwhipped on the spot.'\r\n\r\n'De Cunnul am my massa, ma'am--_he_ say ole Moye shall be whipped, and\r\nI'se gwine to do it--shore.'\r\n\r\nI have seen a storm at sea--I have seen the tempest tear up great\r\ntrees--I have seen the lightning strike in a dark night--but I never saw\r\nanything half so grand, half so terrible, as the glance and tone of that\r\nwoman as she cried out, 'Jim, take this man--give him fifty lashes this\r\ninstant.'\r\n\r\nQuicker than thought, a dozen darkies were on him. His hands and feet\r\nwere tied and he was under the whipping-rack in a second. Turning then\r\nto the other negroes, the brave woman said, 'Some of you carry Moye to\r\nthe house, and you, Jim, see to this man--if fifty lashes don't make him\r\nsorry, give him fifty more.'\r\n\r\nThis summary change of programme was silently acquiesced in by the\r\nassembled darkies, but many a cloudy face scowled sulkily on the\r\noctoroon, as, leaning on my arm, she followed Junius and the other\r\nnegroes, who bore Moye to the mansion. It was plain that under those\r\ndark faces a fire was burning that a breath would have fanned into a\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nWe entered the house by its rear door, and placed Moye in a small room\r\non the ground floor. He was laid on a bed, and stimulants being given\r\nhim, his senses and reason shortly returned. His eyes opened, and his\r\nreal position seemed suddenly to flash upon him, for he turned to Madam\r\nP----, and in a weak voice, half-choked with emotion, faltered out, 'May\r\nGod in heaven bless ye, ma'am; God _will_ bless ye for bein' so good to\r\na wicked man like me. I doesn't desarve it, but ye woant leave me--ye\r\nwoant leave me--they'll kill me ef ye do!'\r\n\r\n'Don't fear,' said the Madam; 'you shall have a fair trial. No harm\r\nshall come to you here.'\r\n\r\n'Thank ye, thank ye,' gasped the Overseer, raising himself on one arm,\r\nand clutching at the lady's hand, which he tried to lift to his lips.\r\n\r\n'Don't say any more now,' said Madam P----, quietly; 'you must rest and\r\nbe quiet, or you won't get well.'\r\n\r\n'Shan't I get well? Oh, I can't die--I can't die _now_!'\r\n\r\nThe lady made a soothing reply, and giving him an opiate, and arranging\r\nthe bedding so that he might rest more easily, she left the room with\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAs we stepped into the hall, I saw through the front door, which was\r\nopen, the horses harnessed in readiness for 'meeting,' and the Colonel\r\npacing to and fro on the piazza, smoking a cigar. He perceived us, and\r\nhalted in front of the doorway.\r\n\r\n'So, you've brought that d---- blood-thirsty villain into my house!' he\r\nsaid to Madam P----, in a tone of strong displeasure.\r\n\r\n'How could I help it? The negroes are mad, and would kill him anywhere\r\nelse,' replied the lady, with a certain self-confidence that showed she\r\nknew her power over the Colonel.\r\n\r\n'Why should _you_ interfere between them and him? Has he not insulted\r\nyou often enough to make you let him alone? Can you so easily forgive\r\nhis taunting you with'--He did not finish the sentence, but what I had\r\nlearned on the previous evening from the old nurse gave me a clue to its\r\nmeaning. A red flame flushed the face and neck of the octoroon\r\nwoman--her eyes literally flashed fire, and her very breath seemed to\r\ncome with pain; in a moment, however, this emotion passed away, and she\r\nquietly said, 'Let me settle that in my own way. He has served _you_\r\nwell--_you_ have nothing against him that the law will not punish.'\r\n\r\n'By ----, you are the most unaccountable woman I ever knew,' exclaimed\r\nthe Colonel, striding up and down the piazza, the angry feeling passing\r\nfrom his face, and giving way to a mingled expression of wonder and\r\nadmiration. The conversation was here interrupted by Jim, who just then\r\nmade his appearance, hat in hand.\r\n\r\n'Well, Jim, what is it?' asked his master.\r\n\r\n'We'se gib'n Sam twenty lashes, ma'am, but he beg so hard, and say he so\r\nsorry, dat I tole him I'd ax you 'fore we gabe him any more.'\r\n\r\n'Well, if he's sorry, that's enough; but tell him he'll get fifty\r\nanother time,' said the lady.\r\n\r\n'What Sam is it?' asked the Colonel.\r\n\r\n'Big Sam, the driver,' said Jim.\r\n\r\n'Why was he whipped?'\r\n\r\n'He told me _you_ were his master, and insisted on whipping Moye,'\r\nreplied the lady.\r\n\r\n'Did he dare to do that? Give him a hundred, Jim, not one less,' roared\r\nthe Colonel.\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa,' said Jim.\r\n\r\nThe lady looked significantly at the negro and shook her head, but said\r\nnothing, and he left.\r\n\r\n'Come, Alice, it is nearly time for meeting, and I want to stop and see\r\nSandy on the way.'\r\n\r\n'I reckon I won't go,' said Madam P----.\r\n\r\n'You stay to take care of Moye, I suppose,' said the Colonel, with a\r\nslight sneer.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' replied the lady; 'he is badly hurt, and in danger of\r\ninflammation.'\r\n\r\n'Well, suit yourself. Sir. K----, come, _we'll_ go--you'll meet some of\r\nthe _natives_.'\r\n\r\nThe lady retired to the house, and the Colonel and I were soon ready.\r\nThe driver brought the horses to the door, and as we were about to enter\r\nthe carriage, I noticed Jim taking his accustomed seat on the box.\r\n\r\n'Who's looking after Sam?' asked the Colonel.\r\n\r\n'Nobody, Cunnul; de ma'am leff him gwo.'\r\n\r\n'How dare you disobey me? Didn't I tell you to give him a hundred?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa, but de ma'am tole me notter.'\r\n\r\n'Well, another time you mind what _I_ say--do you hear?' said his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa,' said the negro, with a broad grin, 'I allers do dat.'\r\n\r\n'You _never_ do it, you d---- nigger; I ought to have flogged you long\r\nago.'\r\n\r\nJim said nothing, but gave a quiet laugh, showing no sort of fear, and\r\nwe entered the carriage. I afterwards learned from him that he had never\r\nbeen whipped, and that all the negroes on the plantation obeyed the lady\r\nwhen, which was seldom, her orders came in conflict with their master's.\r\nThey knew if they did not, the Colonel would whip them.\r\n\r\nAs we rode slowly along the Colonel said to me, 'Well, you see that the\r\nbest people have to flog their niggers sometimes.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, _I_ should have given that fellow a hundred lashes, at least. I\r\nthink the effect on the others would have been bad if Madam P---- had\r\nnot had him flogged.'\r\n\r\n'But she generally goes against it. I don't remember of her having it\r\ndone in ten years before. And yet, though I've the worst gang of niggers\r\nin the district, they obey her like so many children.'\r\n\r\n'Why is that?'\r\n\r\n'Well, there's a kind of magnetism about her that makes everybody love\r\nher; and then she tends them in sickness, and is constantly doing little\r\nthings for their comfort; _that_ attaches them to her. She is an\r\nextraordinary woman.'\r\n\r\n'Whose negroes are those, Colonel?' I asked, as, after a while, we\r\npassed a gang of about a dozen, at work near the roadside. Some were\r\ntending a tar-kiln, and some engaged in cutting into fire-wood the pines\r\nwhich a recent tornado had thrown to the ground.\r\n\r\n'They are mine, but they are working now for themselves. I let such as\r\nwill, work on Sunday. I furnish the \"raw material,\" and pay them for\r\nwhat they do, as I would a white man.'\r\n\r\n'Would'nt it be better to make them go to hear the old preacher;\r\ncould'nt they learn something from him?'\r\n\r\n'Not much; Old Pomp never read anything but the Bible, and he don't\r\nunderstand that; besides, they can't be taught. You can't make \"a\r\nwhistle out of a pig's tail;\" you can't make a nigger into a white man.'\r\n\r\nJust here the carriage stopped suddenly, and we looked out to see the\r\ncause. The road by which we had come was a mere opening through the\r\npines; no fences separated it from the wooded land, and being seldom\r\ntraveled, the track was scarcely visible. In many places it widened to a\r\nhundred feet, but in others tall trees had grown up on its opposite\r\nsides, and there was scarcely width enough for a single carriage to pass\r\nalong. In one of these narrow passages, just before us, a queer-looking\r\nvehicle had upset, and scattered its contents in the road. We had no\r\nalternative but to wait till it got out of the way; and we all alighted\r\nto reconnoitre.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle was a little larger than an ordinary hand-cart, and was\r\nmounted on wheels that had probably served their time on a Boston dray\r\nbefore commencing their travels in Secessiondom. Its box of pine\r\nboarding and its shafts of rough oak poles were evidently of Southern\r\nhome manufacture. Attached to it by a rope harness, with a primitive\r\nbridle of decidedly original construction, was--not a horse, nor a mule,\r\nnor even an alligator, but a 'three-year-old heifer.'\r\n\r\nThe wooden linch-pin of the cart had given way, and the weight of a\r\nhalf-dozen barrels of turpentine had thrown the box off its balance, and\r\nrolled the contents about in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the proprietor of this nondescript vehicle was in\r\nkeeping with the establishment. His coat, which was much too short in\r\nthe waist and much too long in the skirts, was of the common reddish\r\ngray linsey, and his nether garments, of the same material, stopped just\r\nbelow the knees. From there downwards, he wore only the covering that is\r\nsaid to have been the fashion in Paradise before Adam took to\r\nfig-leaves. His hat had a rim broader than a political platform, and his\r\nskin a color half way between that of tobacco-juice and a tallow candle.\r\n\r\n'Wal, Cunnul, how dy'ge?' said the stranger, as we stepped from the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n'Very well, Ned; how are you?'\r\n\r\n'Purty wal, Cunnul; had the nagur lately, right smart, but'm gittin'\r\n'roun.'\r\n\r\n'You're in a bad fix here, I see. Can't Jim help you?'\r\n\r\n'Wal, p'raps he moight. Jim, how dy'ge?'\r\n\r\n'Sort o' smart, ole feller. But come, stir yerseff; we want ter gwo\r\n'long,' replied Jim, with a manifest lack of courtesy that showed he\r\nregarded the white man as altogether too 'trashy' to be treated with\r\nmuch ceremony.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of Jim, a new linch-pin was soon whittled out, the\r\nturpentine rolled on to the cart, and the vehicle put in a moving\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n'Where are you hauling your turpentine?' asked the Colonel.\r\n\r\n'To Sam Bell's, at the \"Boro'.\"'\r\n\r\n'What will he pay you?'\r\n\r\n'Wal, I've four barr'ls of \"dip,\" and tu of \"hard.\" For the hull, I\r\nreckon he'll give three dollars a barr'l.'\r\n\r\n'By tale?'\r\n\r\n'No, for two hun'red and eighty pound.'\r\n\r\n'Well, _I'll_ give you two dollars and a half by weight.'\r\n\r\n'Can't take it, Cunnel; must get three dollar.'\r\n\r\n'What, will you go sixty miles with this team, and waste five or six\r\ndays, for fifty cents on six barrels--three dollars?'\r\n\r\n'Can't 'ford the time, Cunnel, but must git three dollar a barr'l.'\r\n\r\n'That fellow is a specimen of our \"natives,\"' said the Colonel, as we\r\nresumed our seats in the carriage. 'You'll see more of them before we\r\nget back to the plantation.'\r\n\r\n'He puts a young cow to a decidedly original use,' I remarked.\r\n\r\n'Oh no, not original here; the ox and the cow with us are both used for\r\nlabor.'\r\n\r\n'You don't mean to say that cows are generally worked here?'\r\n\r\n'Of course I do. Our breeds are good for nothing as milkers, and we put\r\nthem to the next best use. I never have cow's milk on my plantation.'\r\n\r\n'You don't! why, I could have sworn it was in my coffee this morning.'\r\n\r\n'I wouldn't trust you to buy brandy for me, if your organs of taste are\r\nnot keener than that. It was goat's milk.'\r\n\r\n'Then how do you get your butter?'\r\n\r\n'From the North. I've had mine from my New York factors for over two\r\nyears.'\r\n\r\nWe soon arrived at Sandy the negro-hunter's, and halted to allow the\r\nColonel to inquire as to the health of his family of children and\r\ndogs,--the latter the less numerous, but, if I might judge by\r\nappearances, the more valued of the two.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN AIDS TO THE NORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIf war did little else, it would have its value from the fact that it\r\nacts so extensively as an institution for the dissemination of useful\r\nknowledge. Every murmur of political dissension sends thousands to\r\nconsult the map, and repair their early neglect of geography. Perhaps if\r\natlases and ethnographical works were more studied we should have less\r\nwar. And it is by no means impossible that the mutual knowledge which\r\nhas been or is to be acquired by the people of the South and the North\r\nduring this present war will eventually aid materially in establishing a\r\nfirm bond of union.\r\n\r\nThat we have much to learn is shown in the firm faith with which so many\r\nhave listened to the threats of 'a united South.' Until recently the\r\nfierce and furious assurances of the rebel press, that south of Mason\r\nand Dixon's line all were wedded heart and soul to their cause, were\r\ntaken almost without a doubt. Who has forgotten the late doleful\r\nconvictions of the dough-faces that the South would hold together to the\r\nlast in spite of wind or weather, concluding invariably with the old\r\nrefrain,--'Suppose we conquer them--what then?' Had the country at large\r\nknown in detail, as it _should_ have known from a common-school\r\neducation, what the South _really_ is,--or from experience of life what\r\nhuman nature really is,--it would never have believed that this boasted\r\nunanimity was based on aught save ignorance or falsehood. The Southern\r\npress itself, almost without an exception, betrays gross ignorance of\r\nits own country, and is very superficial in its statistics, inclining\r\nmore than any other to warp facts and figures to suit preconceived\r\nviews. We, like it, have tacitly adopted the belief that south of a\r\ncertain line a certain climate invariably prevailed, and that under its\r\ninfluences, from the Border to the Gulf of Mexico, there has been\r\ndeveloped a race essentially alike in all its characteristics. The\r\nplanter and the slave-owner, or the city merchant, has been the type\r\nwith which our writers have become familiar at the hotel and the\r\nwatering-place, or in the 'store,' and we have accepted them as speaking\r\nfor the South, quite forgetful that in America, as in other countries,\r\nthe real man of the middle class travels but little, and when he does,\r\nis seldom to be found mingling in the 'higher circles.' Yet even this\r\nSouthern man of the middle class and of 'Alleghania,' when at the North\r\nfrequently affects a 'Southern' air, which is not more natural to him\r\nthan it is to the youthful scions of Philadelphia and New York, who,\r\nwhen in Europe, so often talk pro-slavery and bowie knife, as though\r\nthey lived in the very heart of planterdom. But the truth is that when\r\nwe search the South out closely we find that in reality there is a very\r\ngreat difference between its districts and their inhabitants, and, in\r\n_fact_, as has been very truly said, 'not only is there no geographical\r\nboundary between the free and slave States, but no moral and\r\nintellectual boundary.'\r\n\r\nIn the great temperate region which, parting from either side of the\r\nAlleghanies, extends from Virginia to Alabama, and is still continued in\r\nthe pleasant level of Texas, slavery has rolled away from either\r\nmountain side like a flood, leaving it the home of a hardy population\r\nwhich regards with jealousy and dislike both the wealthy planter and the\r\nnegro. James W. Taylor, in his valuable collection of facts, claims that\r\nthrough the whole extent of the Southern Alleghania slavery has\r\nrelatively diminished since 1850, and that the forthcoming census tables\r\nwill establish the assertion. 'The superintendent of the census,' he\r\nsays, 'would furnish a document, valuable politically and for military\r\nuse, if he would anticipate the publication of this portion of his\r\nvoluminous budget.' If government, indeed, were to communicate to the\r\npublic what information it now holds, and has long held, relative to the\r\nnumbers and strength of the Union men of the South, an excitement of\r\namazement would thrill through the North. It was on the basis of this\r\nknowledge that our great campaign was planned,--and it can not be denied\r\nthat thousands of stanch Union men were greatly astonished at the\r\nrevelations of sympathy which burst forth most unexpectedly in districts\r\nwhere the stars and stripes have been planted. But the Cabinet 'knew\r\nwhat it knew' on this subject. Much of its knowledge never can be\r\nrevealed, but enough will come to-night to show that in our darkest hour\r\nwe had an enormous mass of aid, little suspected by those weaker\r\nbrethren who stood aghast at the Southern bugbear, and who, falling\r\nprostrate in nerveless terror at the windy spectre, quaked out repeated\r\nassurances that _they_ had no intention of 'abolitionizing the war,' and\r\neven earnestly begged and prayed that the emancipationists might all be\r\nsent to Fort Warren,--so fearful were the poor cowards lest the united\r\nSouth, in the final hour of victory, might include them in its catalogue\r\nof the doomed. What would they say if they knew the number and power of\r\nthe ABOLITIONISTS OF THE SOUTH,--a body of no trifling significance,\r\nwhose fierce grasp will yet be felt on the throat of rebellion and of\r\nslavery? It is grimly amusing to think of the aid which the South\r\ncounted on receiving from these Northern dough-faces,--little thinking\r\nthat within itself it contained a counter-revolutionary party, far more\r\ndangerous than the Northern friends were helpful.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that where such an evil as slavery exists\r\nthere will be numbers of grave, sensible men, who, however quiet they\r\nmay keep, will have their own opinions as to the expediency of\r\nmaintaining it. The bigots of the South may rave of the beauty of 'the\r\ninstitution,' and make many believe that they speak for the whole,--a\r\nlittle scum when whipped covers the whole pail,--but beneath all lies a\r\nsteadily-increasing mass of practical men who would readily enough\r\nmanifest their opposition should opportunity favor free speech. Such\r\npeople, for instance, are not insensible to the enormously corrupting\r\ninfluence of negroes on their children. Let the reader recall Olmsted's\r\nexperiences,--that, for example, where he speaks of three negro women\r\nwho had charge of half a dozen white girls of good family, 'from three\r\nto fifteen years of age.'\r\n\r\n    Their language was loud and obscene, such as I never heard\r\n    before from any but the most depraved and beastly women of the\r\n    streets. Upon observing me they dropped their voices, but not\r\n    with any appearance of shame, and continued their altercation\r\n    until their mistresses entered. The white children, in the mean\r\n    time, had listened without any appearance of wonder or\r\n    annoyance. The moment the ladies opened the door, they became\r\n    silent.--_Cotton Kingdom_, vol. i. p. 222.\r\n\r\nThe Southern _Cultivator_ for June, 1855, speaks of many young men and\r\nwomen who have 'made shipwreck of all their earthly hopes, and been led\r\nto the fatal step by the seeds of corruption which in the days of\r\nchildhood and youth were sown in their hearts by the indelicate and\r\nlascivious manners and conversation of their fathers' negroes.' If we\r\nhad no other fact or cause to cite, this almost unnamable one might\r\nconvince the reader that there must be a groundwork somewhere in the\r\nSouth among good, moral, and decent people, for antipathy to\r\nslavery,--human nature teaches us as much. And such people exist, not\r\nonly among the hardy inhabitants of the inland districts, who are not\r\nenervated by wealth and 'exclusiveness,' but in planterdom itself.\r\n\r\nThere are few in the North who realize the number of persons in the\r\nSouth who silently disapprove of slavery on sound grounds, such as I\r\nhave mentioned. Does it seem credible that nearly _ten millions_ of\r\npeople should socially sympathize with some three hundred thousand\r\nslave-holders, who act with intolerable arrogance to all\r\nnon-slave-holders? 'Even in those regions where slavery is profitable,'\r\nas a writer in the Boston _Transcript_ well expresses it, 'the poor\r\nwhites feel the slaveocracy as the most grinding of aristocracies.'\r\n\r\n    In those regions where it is not profitable, the population\r\n    regard it with a latent abhorrence, compared with which the\r\n    rhetorical and open invectives of Garrison and Phillips are\r\n    feeble and tame. Anybody who has read Olmsted's truthful\r\n    narrative of his experience in the slave States can not doubt\r\n    this fact. The hatred to slavery too often finds its expression\r\n    in an almost inhuman hatred of 'niggers,' whether slave or free,\r\n    but it is none the less significant of the feelings and opinions\r\n    of the white population.\r\n\r\nAs I write, every fresh thunder of war and crash of victory is followed\r\nby murmurs of amazement at the enthusiastic receptions which the Union\r\nforces meet in most unexpected strongholds of the enemy, in the very\r\nheart of slavedom. Yet it was _known_ months ago, and prophesied, with\r\nthe illustration of undeniable facts, that this counter-revolutionary\r\nelement existed. One single truth was forgotten,--that these Southern\r\nfriends of the Union, even while avowing that slavery must be supported,\r\nhad no love of it in their hearts. Emancipation has been sedulously set\r\naside under pretence of conciliating them; but it was needless,--'old\r\ncustom' had made them cautious, and mindful of 'expediency;' but the\r\nmass of them hate 'the institution.' It is for the traitorous Northern\r\n_dough-faces_, and the paltry handful of secessionists, 'on a thin slip\r\nof land on the Atlantic,' that slavery is, at present, cherished. The\r\ngreat area of the South is free from it,--and ever will be.\r\n\r\nIt has frequently been insisted on that the mere _geographical_\r\nobstacles to disunion are such as to render the cause of slavery\r\nhopeless in the long run. Yet to this most powerful Southern aid to the\r\nNorth, men seem to have been strangely blind during the days of doubt\r\nwhich so long afflicted us. These obstacles are, briefly, the enormous\r\ngrowing power of the West, and its inevitable outlet, the Mississippi\r\nriver. 'For it is the mighty and free _West_ which will always hang like\r\na lowering thunder-cloud over them.'[N] On this subject I quote at\r\nlength from an article, in the Danville (Ky.) _Review_, by the Rev. R.\r\nJ. Breckenridge, D.D.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whoever will look at a map of the United States, will observe\r\n    that Louisiana lies on both sides of the Mississippi river, and\r\n    that the States of Arkansas and Mississippi lie on the right and\r\n    left banks of this great stream--eight hundred miles of whose\r\n    lower course is thus controlled by these three States, unitedly\r\n    inhabited by hardly as many white people as inhabit the city of\r\n    New York. Observe, then, the country drained by this river and\r\n    its affluents, commencing with Missouri on its west bank and\r\n    Kentucky on its east bank. There are nine or ten powerful\r\n    States, large portions of three or four others, several large\r\n    Territories--in all, a country as large as all Europe, as fine\r\n    as any under the sun, already holding many more people than all\r\n    the revolted States, and powerful regions of the earth. Does any\r\n    one suppose that these powerful States--this great and energetic\r\n    population--will ever make a peace that will put the lower\r\n    course of this single and mighty national outlet to the sea in\r\n    the hands of a foreign government far weaker than themselves? If\r\n    there is any such person he knows little of the past history of\r\n    mankind, and will perhaps excuse us for reminding him that the\r\n    people of Kentucky, before they were constituted a State, gave\r\n    formal notice to the federal government, when Gen. Washington\r\n    was President, that if the United States did not require\r\n    Louisiana they would themselves conquer it. The mouths of the\r\n    Mississippi belong, by the gift of God, to the inhabitants of\r\n    its great valley. Nothing but irresistible force can disinherit\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n    Try another territorial aspect of the case. There is a bed of\r\n    mountains abutting on the left bank of the Ohio, which covers\r\n    all Western Virginia, and all Eastern Kentucky, to the width,\r\n    from east to west, in those two States, of three or four hundred\r\n    miles. These mountains, stretching south-westwardly, pass\r\n    entirely through Tennessee, cover the back parts of North\r\n    Carolina and Georgia, heavily invade the northern part of\r\n    Alabama, and make a figure even in the back parts of South\r\n    Carolina and the eastern parts of Mississippi, having a course\r\n    of perhaps seven or eight hundred miles, and running far south\r\n    of the northern limit of profitable cotton culture. It is a\r\n    region of 300,000 square miles, trenching upon eight or nine\r\n    slave States, though nearly destitute of slaves itself;\r\n    trenching upon at least five cotton States, though raising no\r\n    cotton itself. The western part of Maryland and two-thirds of\r\n    Pennsylvania are embraced in the north-eastern continuation of\r\n    this remarkable region. Can anything that passes under the name\r\n    of statesmanship be more preposterous than the notion of\r\n    permanent peace on this continent, founded on the abnegation of\r\n    a common and paramount government, and the idea of the\r\n    supercilious domination of the cotton interest and the\r\n    slave-trade over such a mountain empire, so located and so\r\n    peopled?\r\n\r\n    As a further proof of the utter impossibility of peace except\r\n    under a common government, and at once an illustration of the\r\n    import of what has just been stated, and the suggestion of a new\r\n    and insuperable difficulty, let it be remembered that this great\r\n    mountain region, throughout its general course, is more loyal to\r\n    the Union than any other portion of the slave States. It is the\r\n    mountain counties of Maryland that have held treason in check in\r\n    that State; it is forty mountain counties in Western Virginia\r\n    that have laid the foundation of a new and loyal commonwealth;\r\n    it is the mountain counties of Kentucky that first and most\r\n    eagerly took up arms for the Union; it is the mountain region of\r\n    Tennessee that alone, in that dishonored State, furnished\r\n    martyrs to the sacred cause of freedom; it is the mountain\r\n    people of Alabama that boldly stood out against the Confederate\r\n    government till their own leaders deserted and betrayed them.\r\n\r\nIt is not a strong point, but it is worth noting, that even in South\r\nCarolina there is an Alleghanian area of 4,074 square miles, equal to\r\nthe State of Connecticut, in which the diminished proportion of slaves,\r\nwith other local causes, are sufficient to indicate the Union feeling\r\nwhich indeed struggles there in secret. These counties are:--\r\n\r\n                   FREE.        SLAVE.\r\nSpartanburgh,     18,311         8,039\r\nGreenville,       13,370         6,691\r\nAnderson,         13,867         7,514\r\nPickens,          13,105         3,679\r\n\r\nSlavery is here large, as compared to the other counties of\r\n'Alleghania,' but the great proportion of free inhabitants, as\r\ncontrasted with the districts near the Atlantic, makes it worth citing.\r\nIn accordance with a request, I give from Jas. W.

I have included a tier of counties the west, which\r\n    embrace the summits and western slopes of the Cumberland Hills,\r\n    regarding their physical and political features as more\r\n    identified with East than Middle Tennessee. Such are Lincoln,\r\n    Franklin, Grundy, Van Buren, Cumberland, Morgan and Scott\r\n    counties.\r\n\r\n    I estimate the area of this district as about 17,175 square\r\n    miles, an extent of territory exceeding the aggregate of the\r\n    following States:\r\n\r\n  Massachusetts,   7,800 square miles.\r\n  Connecticut,     4,674 square miles.\r\n  Rhode Island,    l,306 square miles.\r\n                  ------\r\n                  13,180 square miles.\r\n\r\nYet it is not many months since even this Tennessee region, it was\r\ngenerally feared, would be false to the Union, on account of its\r\nattachment to slavery.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has studied the facts which I have cited, indicating the\r\nexistence of a powerful Union party at the South (and the facts are few\r\nand weak compared to the vast mass which exist, and which are known to\r\ngovernment), may judge for himself whether that party is Union _in spite\r\nof pro-slavery principles_, as so many would have us believe. Let him\r\nsee where these Union men are found, where they have come forth with the\r\ngreatest enthusiasm, and _then_ say that he believes they are friends to\r\nslavery. Let him bear in mind the hundreds of thousands of acres, the\r\nvast tracts, equal in extent to whole Northern States, in the South,\r\nwhich are unfitted for slave labor, and reflect whether the inhabitants\r\nof these cool, temperate regions are not as conscious of their\r\ninadaptability to slave labor as he is himself; and whether _they_ are\r\nso much attached to the institution which fosters the Satanic pride,\r\npanders to the passions, and corrupts the children of the planter of the\r\nlow country.\r\n\r\nSince writing the above, the long-expected declaration of President\r\nLINCOLN has appeared in favor of adopting a plan which may lead to the\r\ngradual abolishment of slavery. He proposes that the United States shall\r\ncooeperate with such slave States as may desire Emancipation, by giving\r\nsuch pecuniary aid as may compensate for any losses incurred. No\r\ninterference with State rights or claims to rights in the question is\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this message is directed entirely to the\r\nstrengthening and building up of the Union party of the South, and has\r\nbeen based quite as much on their demands and on a knowledge of their\r\nneeds, as on any Northern pressure. And it will have a sure effect. It\r\nwill bring to life, if realized, those seeds of counter-revolution which\r\nso abundantly exist in the South. The growth may be slow, but it will be\r\ncertain. So long as the certainty exists that compensation _may_ be\r\nobtained, there will be a party who will long for it; and where there is\r\na will there is a way. The executive has finally _officially_ recognized\r\nthe truth of the theory of Emancipation, and thereby entitled itself to\r\nthe honor of having taken the greatest forward step in the glorious path\r\nof Freedom ever made even in our history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE MOLLY O'MOLLY PAPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. I.\r\n\r\nIn addressing you for the first time, you will perhaps expect me to give\r\nsome account of myself and my ancestry, as did the illustrious\r\n_Spectator_.\r\n\r\nMy remote ancestors are Irish. From them I inherited enthusiasm, a\r\ngun-powder temper, a propensity to blunder, and a name--Molly O'Molly.\r\nThe origin of this name I have in vain endeavored to trace in history,\r\nperhaps because it belonged to a very old family, one of the\r\n_prehistorics_. As such it might have been that of a demigod, or,\r\naccording to the development theory, of a _demi-man_. Or it might have\r\nbeen that of an old Irish gentleman, _gentle_ in truth;--in the\r\nformative stage of society it is the monster that leaves traces of\r\nhimself, as in an old geologic period the huge reptile left his tracks\r\nin the plastic earth, which afterward hardened into rock.\r\n\r\nThen, too, I have searched in vain for anything like it in ancient Irish\r\npoetry, thinking that my progenitor's name might have been therein\r\nembalmed. 'The stony science'--mind you--reveals to us the former\r\nexistence of the huge reptile, the fragmentary, mighty mastodon, and,\r\nimperfect, the mail-clad fish. But, wonder of wonders, we find the whole\r\n_insect_ preserved in that fossil gum amber. And even so in verse,\r\ncharacters are preserved for all time, that could not make their mark in\r\nhistory, and that had none of the elements of an earthly immortality.\r\nDid I wish immortality I would choose a poet for my friend;--an _In\r\nMemoriam_ is worth all the records of the dry chronicler.\r\n\r\nBut, it is not with the root of the family tree that you have to do, but\r\nwith the twig Myself.\r\n\r\nAs for my physique,--I am not like the scripture personage who beheld\r\nhis face in a glass, and straightway forgot what manner of man he was. I\r\nhave, on the contrary, a very distinct recollection of my face; suffice\r\nit to say, that, had I Rafaelle's pencil, I would not, like him, employ\r\nit on my own portrait.\r\n\r\nAnd my life--the circumstances which have influenced, or rather created\r\nits currents, have been trifling; not that it has had no powerful\r\ncurrents; it is said that the equilibrium of the whole ocean could be\r\ndestroyed by a single mollusk or coralline,--but my life has been an\r\nuneventful one. I never met with an adventure, never even had a\r\nhair-breadth escape,--yes, I did, too, have one hair-breadth escape. I\r\nonce just grazed matrimony. The truth is, I fell in love, and was\r\nsinking with Falstaff's 'alacrity,' when I was fished out; but somehow I\r\nslipt off the hook--fortunately, however, was left on shore. By the way,\r\nthe best way to get out of love is to be drawn out by the matrimonial\r\nhook. One of Holmes' characters wished to change a vowel of the verb _to\r\nlove_, and conjugate it--I have forgotten how far. Where two set out to\r\nconjugate together the verb to love in the first person plural, it is\r\nwell if they do not, before the honey-moon is over, get to the\r\npresent-perfect, indicative. Alas! I have thus far, in the first person\r\nsingular, conjugated too many verbs, among them _to enjoy_. As for _to\r\nbe_, I have come to the balancing in my mind of the question that so\r\nperplexed Hamlet--'To be, or not to be.' For, with all the natural\r\ncheerfulness of my disposition, I can not help sometimes looking on the\r\ndark side of life. But there is no use in setting down my gloomy\r\nreflections,--all have them. We are all surrounded by an atmosphere of\r\nmisery, pressing on us fifteen pounds to the square inch, so evenly and\r\nconstantly that we know not its fearful weight. To change the figure.\r\nHave you ever thought how much misery one life _can_ hold in solution?\r\nEach year, as it flows into it, adds to it a heaviness, a weight of woe,\r\nas the rivers add salts to the ocean. I do not refer to the most\r\nunhappy, but to all. Some one says,--\r\n\r\n  'If singing breath, if echoing chord\r\n    To every hidden pang were given,\r\n  What endless melodies were poured,\r\n    As sad as earth, as sweet as heaven.'\r\n\r\nIf breath to every hidden prayer were given, could it be _singing_\r\nbreath? Would it not be a wail monotonous as the dirge of the November\r\nwind over the dead summer, a wail for lost hopes, lost joys, lost loves?\r\nOr the monotony would be varied--as is the wind by fitful gusts--by\r\nshrieks of despair, cries of agony. No, no, there is no use in trying to\r\nmodulate our woes,--'we're all wrong,--the _time_ in us is lost.'\r\n\r\n            'Henceforth I'll bear\r\n  Affliction, till it do cry out itself,\r\n    \"Enough, enough,\" and die.'\r\n\r\nBut why talk thus? why mourn over dead hopes, dead joys, dead loves?\r\n'Tis best to bury the dead out of our sight, and from them will spring\r\nmany humbler hopes, quieter joys, more lowly affections, which 'smell\r\nsweet' though they 'blossom in the dust,' and they are the only\r\nresurrection these dead ones can ever have. I have been reading, in\r\nMaury's Geography of the Sea, how the sea's dead are preserved; how they\r\nstand like enchanted warders of the treasures of the deep, unchanged,\r\nexcept that the expression of life is exchanged for the ghastliness of\r\ndeath. So, down beneath the surface currents do some deep souls preserve\r\ntheir dead hopes, joys, loves. Oh, this is unwise; this is _not_ as God\r\nintended; for, unlike the sea's dead, there will be for these no\r\nresurrection.\r\n\r\nThus far I wrote, when the current of my thoughts was changed by a\r\nlively tune struck up by a hand-organ across the street. I am not 'good'\r\nat distinguishing tunes, but this one I had so often heard in childhood,\r\nand had so wondered at its strange title, that I could but remember it.\r\nIt was 'The Devil's Dream.' Were I a poet, I would write the words to\r\nit;--but then, too, I would need be a musician to compose a suitable new\r\ntune to the words! The rattling, reckless notes should be varied by\r\nthose sad enough to make an unlost angel weep--an unlost angel, for, to\r\nthe hot eyes of the lost, no tears can come. 'The _Devil's_\r\nDream'--perhaps it is of Heaven. Doubtless, frescoed in heavenly colors\r\non the walls of his memory, are scenes from which fancy has but to brush\r\nthe smoke and grime of perdition to restore them to almost their\r\noriginal beauty. I could even pity the 'Father of lies,' the 'Essence of\r\nevil,' the 'Enemy of mankind,' when I think of the terrible awaking. But\r\ndoes _he_ ever sleep? Has there since the fall been a pause in _his_\r\nlabors? Perhaps the reason this tune-time is so fast is because he is\r\ndreaming in a hurry,--must soon be up and doing. But it is my opinion\r\nthat he has so wound up the world to wickedness, that he might sleep a\r\nhundred years, and it would have scarcely begun to run down on his\r\nawaking; when, from the familiar appearance of all things, he would\r\nswear 'it was but an after-dinner nap.' Indeed he might die, might\r\nto-day go out in utter nothingness like a falling star, and it would be\r\naway in the year two thousand before he would be missed,--we have\r\nlearned to do our own devil-work so rarely. Meanwhile the well-wound\r\nworld--as a music-box plays over the same tunes--would go on sinning\r\nover the same old sins. Satan is a great economist, but a paltry\r\ndeviser,--he has not invented a new sin since the flood. My thoughts\r\nthus danced along to the music, when they were brought to a dead stop by\r\nits cessation; and it was time, you will think....\r\n\r\nBut, permit me to remind you that my name is not _acquired_, but\r\n_inherited_.\r\n\r\nAt your service,\r\n\r\nMOLLY O'MOLLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. II.\r\n\r\nI detest that man who bides his time to repay a wrong or fancied wrong,\r\nwho keeps alive in his hardened nature the vile thing hatred, and would\r\nfor centuries, did he live thus long,--as the toad is kept alive in the\r\nsolid rock. Hugh Miller says he is 'disposed to regard the poison bag of\r\nthe serpent as a mark of degradation;' this venomous spite is certainly\r\na mark of degradation, and it is only creeping, crawling souls that have\r\nit, but the creeping and crawling are a part of the curse.\r\n\r\nYet I have a respect for honest indignation, righteous anger, such as\r\nthe O'Mollys have ever been capable of. And all the O'Molly blood in my\r\nveins has been stirred by the contemptuous manner in which some men have\r\nspoken of woman. 'Weak woman,--inconstant woman;' they have made the\r\nwind a type of her fickleness. In this they are right; for it has been\r\nproved that the seasons in their return, day and night, are not more\r\nsure than the wind. Such fickleness as this is preferable to _man's_\r\ngreatest constancy. Woman weak! she's gentle as the summer breeze, I\r\ngrant;--but, like this same breeze, when she's roused--then beware! You\r\nhave doubtless heard of that gale that forced back the Gulf Stream, and\r\npiled it up thirty feet at its source.\r\n\r\nTake care how you sour woman's nature,--remember that, once soured, all\r\nthe honey in the universe will not sweeten it. There is such a thing as\r\nmaking vinegar of molasses, but I never heard of making molasses of\r\nvinegar. Do you wish to know the turning process?\r\nGrumbling--everlasting fault-finding--at breakfast, dinner, and supper,\r\nthe same old tune. I don't see how the man who boards can endure it; he\r\nis obliged to swallow his food without complaint. The landlady at the\r\nhead of the table is a very different-looking individual from the meek\r\nwoman he afterwards calls wife,--not a word can he say, though he\r\nmorning after morning, in his breakfast, recognizes, through its various\r\ndisguises, yesterday's dinner. By the way, this is after Dame Nature's\r\nplan; she uses the greatest economy in feeding her immense family of\r\nboarders; never wastes a refuse scrap, or even a drop of water. If one\r\nof these boarders dies, it is true he is not, like 'the poor work-house\r\nboy,' served up as one dish, but he becomes an ingredient in many 'a\r\ndainty dish' fit to 'to set before a king.' But I am not, like 'Miss\r\nOphelia' in 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' going to explore the good dame's\r\nkitchen,--will rather eat what is set before me, asking no questions;\r\nwhich last, what _man_ ever did, if he could help it?\r\n\r\nFor an insignificant man, originally but a cipher, who owes it to his\r\nwife that he is even the fraction that he is, to talk about 'woman\r\nknowing her place--he's head,' etc.! If he had given her the place that\r\nbelonged to her, their value, not as individual figures, but as one\r\nnumber, would have been increased a thousand fold. I have made a\r\ncalculation, and this is literally true, or rather, you will say,\r\n_figuratively_ true. Well, this kind of figures can not lie.\r\n\r\n'The rose,' the Burmese say, 'imparts fragrance to the leaf in which it\r\nis folded.' Many a man has had a sweetness imparted to his character by\r\nthe woman he has sheltered in his bosom--though some characters 'not all\r\nthe perfume of Arabia could sweeten;' and, strange as it seem, most\r\nwomen would rather be folded in a _tobacco_ leaf than 'waste their\r\nsweetness on desert air.' Though it is a long time since I have been a\r\nman _lover_, I am not a man _hater_. I can not hate anything that has\r\nbeen so hallowed by woman's love,--_its_ magnetism gives a sort of\r\nattractive power to him.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all that has been said about woman's weakness, it is\r\nacknowledged that she has a pretty strong will of her own. Well, we need\r\na strong will,--it is the great _centrifugal force_ that God has given\r\nto all. Only it must be subordinate to the _centripetal force_ of the\r\nuniverse--the Divine will.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the centripetal force of our solar system is the Pleiad\r\nAlcyon. I know not whether the other stars of that cluster feel this\r\nattraction; if they do, what a centrifugal force the lost Pleiad must\r\nhave had, to break away from 'the sweet influences' which, through so\r\nimmense a distance, draw the sun with all his train. This is not without\r\na parallel--when 'the morning stars sang together' over the new-born\r\nearth, one 'star of the morning' was not there to join in the chorus.\r\n\r\nBut Old Sol will probably never so strongly assert _his_ centrifugality\r\nas to set such an example of _secession_ to his planets and comets.\r\n\r\nPardon this astronomical digression. I have just returned from hearing\r\nan itinerant lecturer, and it will take a week to get the smoke of his\r\nmagic lantern out of my eyes. If there is any error in these\r\nobservations, blame the itinerant, not me.\r\n\r\nI had been low-spirited all day, had tried reading, work,--all of no\r\navail. Dyspeptic views of life would present themselves to my mind. Some\r\nnatures, and mine is of them, like the pendulum, need a weight attached\r\nto them to keep them from going too fast. But a wholesome sorrow is very\r\ndifferent from this moping melancholy, when the thoughts run in one\r\ndirection, till they almost wear a channel for themselves--when the\r\nchannel is worn, there is _insanity_.\r\n\r\nNeither are my gloomy religious views to-day those that will regenerate\r\nthe world. Those lines of Dr. Watts,--'We should suspect some danger\r\nnigh When we possess delight,'--it is said, were written after a\r\ndisappointment in love--it was 'sour grapes' that morning--with the\r\ngrave divine.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, where we possess _continued_ delight, there is no\r\n'danger nigh.' Where an enjoyment comes between us and our God, it casts\r\non us a shadow. When we have plucked a beautiful flower, if poisonous,\r\nit has such a sickening odor that we fling it from us. We do not 'pay\r\ntoo dear for our whistle,' unless it costs us a sin; then it soon\r\nbecomes a loathed and useless toy. Otherwise, the dearer we pay, the\r\nsweeter its music.\r\n\r\nAnd even if there is 'danger nigh'--because we are pleased with the\r\nbeautiful foam, need we steer straight for the breakers? Not every\r\ntempting morsel is the enemy's bait, though we should be careful how we\r\nnibble;--he is no blunderer (a proof positive that he is not Irish),\r\nnever leaves his trap sprung--and we may get caught.\r\n\r\nThis is a synopsis of the arguments, or rather assertions, with which I\r\nopposed those of the blues; but, finding they were getting the better of\r\nme, I started out for a walk. It was a chilly afternoon; the whole sky,\r\nexcept a clear place just above the western horizon, was covered with\r\nthose heavy, diluted India-ink clouds; the setting sun throwing a dreary\r\nred light on the northern and eastern mountains, adding sullenness to\r\nthe gloom, instead of dispelling it. But why describe this gloomy\r\nsunset, there are so many beautiful ones?--when, as the grand, old,\r\ndying Humboldt said, the 'glorious rays seem to beckon earth to heaven?'\r\n\r\nWell, I walked so fast that I left my blue tormentors far in the rear.\r\nOn the way I met a friend, who invited me to go to the astronomical\r\nlecture. Here you have it, after many digressions. My thoughts never\r\nstrike a plane surface, but always a spherical, and fly off in a\r\ntangent.\r\n\r\nSydney Smith says, 'Remember the flood and be brief.' You know I belong\r\nto a very old family; and from an ancestor, who lived before the flood,\r\nhas been transmitted through a long line of O'Mollys a disposition to\r\nspin out. Unfortunately an antediluvian length of time was not an\r\n_heir-loom_ to\r\n\r\nYour humble servant,\r\n\r\nMOLLY O'MOLLY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCHES OF EDINBURGH LITERATI.\r\n\r\nBY A FORMER MEMBER OF ITS PRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a time when the little hamlet of Cockpaine, ten miles from\r\nEdinburgh, in addition to the charms of its scenery, was also socially\r\nattractive from the high literary talent of several of its residents. It\r\nwas situated on the banks of the Esk, whose rapid flow affords a\r\nvaluable water-power. This had been improved under the enterprise of Mr.\r\nCraig, an extensive manufacturer, who became at last proprietor not only\r\nof the mills, but of the entire village. Mr. Craig was successful for\r\nseveral years; but the revulsions of trade during the Crimean war swept\r\naway his previous profits, and in 1854 he sank in utter bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThe extensive domain of the Earl of Dalhousie lay next to Cockpaine, and\r\nthe village site seemed all that was necessary to its completeness. As\r\nsoon as the latter was offered for sale, the earl made the long-desired\r\npurchase, and then began the immediate eviction of its population. I saw\r\nfour hundred operatives, of all ages, driven off on one sad occasion--a\r\nscene which reminded me most painfully of Goldsmith's lines in the\r\n'Deserted Village:'--\r\n\r\n  'Good Heaven! what sorrows gloomed that parting day\r\n  That called them from their native walks away,\r\n  When the poor exiles, every pleasure past,\r\n  Hung round the bowers, and fondly looked their last,\r\n  And took a long farewell, and wished in vain\r\n  For seats like these beyond the western main;\r\n  And shuddering still to face the distant deep,\r\n  Returned and wept, and still returned to weep.'\r\n\r\nA subsequent visit to what was once the thriving village, with its\r\nembowered cottages reflected from the waters of the Esk, its groups of\r\nromping children, its Sabbath melodies and its secular din, now changed\r\nto a nobleman's preserves, recalled the following truthful sketch from\r\nthe same poem:--\r\n\r\n  'Thus fares the land by luxury betrayed,\r\n  In Nature's simplest charms arrayed;\r\n  But verging to decline, its splendors rise,\r\n  Its vistas strike, its palaces surprise;\r\n  While, scourged by famine from the smiling land,\r\n  The mournful peasant leads his humble band;\r\n  And while he sinks, without one arm to save,\r\n  _The country blooms, a garden and a grave._'\r\n\r\nAmong those whom Mr. Craig had numbered with the friends of his better\r\ndays, the first rank might have been conceded to that most eccentric and\r\ninteresting child of genius, Thomas DeQuincey.\r\n\r\nMr. Craig had thrown open to his use a lovely cottage and grounds,\r\ncommonly known as 'the Paddock,' which DeQuincey and his family occupied\r\nfor several years as privileged guests. 'The Opium-eater,' as he was\r\nuniversally called by the villagers, was not more remarkable in\r\ncharacter than in appearance. His attenuated form, though but five feet\r\nsix in height, seemed singularly tall; and his sharply aquiline\r\ncountenance was strongly indicative of reflection. This aspect was\r\nincreased by a downward cast of the eyes, which were invariably fixed\r\nupon the ground; and in his solitary walks he seemed like one rapt in a\r\ndream. Such a character could not but be quite a marvel to the literary\r\ncoterie of Cockpaine, which found in him an inexhaustible subject of\r\ndiscussion; while the more common class of the community viewed him with\r\nsolemn wonderment--'aye, there he gaes aff to th' brae--he'll kill\r\nhimsell wi' ower thinkin'--glowrin all the day lang--ah, there's na gude\r\nin that black stuff; it's worse nor whiskey and baccy forbye.' Such were\r\nsome of the ordinary comments on the weird form which was seen emerging\r\nfrom 'the Paddock' and moving in solitude towards the hills. Taciturnity\r\nwas a striking feature in DeQuincey's character, and was, no doubt,\r\nowing to intense mental action. The inner life, aroused to extreme\r\nactivity by continued stimulus, excluded all perceptions beyond its own\r\nlimits, and the world in which he dwelt was sufficiently large without\r\nthe intrusion of external things. In his walks I would often follow in\r\nhis track, with that fondness of imitation peculiar to childhood, but\r\nwas never the object of his notice, and never heard him converse but\r\nonce. Overcome by such recluse habits, DeQuincey showed no desire to\r\ncourt the patronage of the great, and had but little intercourse with\r\nthe lordly family of the Dalhousies. Indeed, his only intimacy was with\r\nMr. Craig, whose hospitality had won his heart. He was at this time\r\nstill consuming enormous quantities of opium, having never abated its\r\nuse, notwithstanding his allusions to reform in the 'Confessions.' His\r\ntwo daughters, like those of Milton, cheered the domestic scenes of 'the\r\nPaddock,' and the trio formed a circle whose interest pervaded the\r\nliterary world.\r\n\r\nDeQuincey was at that time writing for Hogg's _Instructor_, a popular\r\nEdinburgh periodical, in which his articles were a leading attraction.\r\nThe _Instructor_ was published weekly, and in addition to the pen of the\r\n'Opium-eater,' could boast the editorship of the brilliant George\r\nGilfillan. The former of these devoted himself to a series of\r\ninteresting miscellanies, in which he brought out many pen-and-ink\r\nportraits of striking power. At times, indeed, he was almost considered\r\njoint editor; but his use of opium was so little abated, that it\r\nforbade dependence upon his pen. The quantity of the drug consumed by\r\nhim, according to report, was astonishing. In his daily walk along the\r\nEsk, his form was easily distinguished, even at a distance, by the prim\r\nblack surtout, whose priestly aspect was somewhat in contrast with his\r\n'shocking-bad' hat. DeQuincey had by this time escaped from the poverty\r\nof his early days, of which he speaks so bitterly in his 'Confessions,'\r\nand was, if not a man of wealth, at least in easy circumstances. He was\r\nreputed to own a snug little estate, called 'Lasswade;' but he abandoned\r\nit to a tenant, and gave preference to Cockpaine, which charmed him by\r\nits romantic scenery. His pay for contributions to the _Instructor_\r\ncould not have been less than a guinea per page; and Hogg, its publisher\r\n(who was no relation to the Ettrick shepherd), would have given him more\r\nhad it been demanded. The _Instructor_ was subsequently merged into the\r\n_Titan_, and its place of publication changed to London.\r\n\r\nRemoving from Cockpaine, my initiation into Edinburgh life was through\r\nan acquaintance with the noted publishing house of the Messrs. Black,\r\nwho were then getting out their splendid edition of the _Encyclopedia\r\nBrittanica_.\r\n\r\nThis vast enterprise, which cost L25,000, was highly profitable, through\r\nthe energy and cleverness of Robert Black, who conducted it. Among other\r\ndistinguished contributors, I frequently met in its office Mr.,\r\nsubsequently Lord, Macaulay, who furnished the articles on 'Pitt,'\r\n'Canning,' and other distinguished statesmen. Although at that time a\r\nman of slender means, Mr. Macaulay refused compensation for these\r\npapers, on the score of strong personal friendship. However, he received\r\nan indirect reward, more valuable than mere gold, since Robert Black was\r\nhis strong political supporter, and frequently presided at public\r\nmeetings held to further Macaulay's interests. I have often seen Music\r\nHall crowded by an enthusiastic mass while the bookseller filled the\r\nchair, and the great reviewer appeared as a public orator. Macaulay's\r\nperson was very striking and impressive. He was tall, and of noble build\r\nand full development. Although one of the most diligent of readers and\r\nhard working of students of any age, his ruddy countenance did not\r\nindicate close application, and his appearance was anything but that of\r\na book-worm. Indeed, at first glance, one would have taken him for a\r\nfine specimen of the wealthy English farmer; and to have observed his\r\nhabits of good living at the social dining parties, would have added to\r\nthe impression that in him the animal nature was far in advance of the\r\nintellectual. Macaulay, on all festive occasions, proved himself as\r\nelegant a conversationist as he was a writer; his tone was thoroughly\r\nEnglish, and his pronunciation, like that of Washington Irving, was\r\nsingularly correct. As a speaker, he at times rose to splendid flights\r\nof oratory, although his delivery from memory was less effective than\r\nthe extemporaneous style. Macaulay never married, but was always happy\r\nin the social circle of his friends.\r\n\r\nThe Blacks were likewise publishers of Scott's novels, the demand for\r\nwhich was so great that they were seldom 'off the press.' Three standard\r\neditions were issued,--one of forty-eight volumes, at a low rate,\r\nanother of twenty-five volumes, at higher cost, and an additional\r\nlibrary edition, of still greater price. Of these, one thousand 'sets'\r\nper year were the average of sale.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, I was in connection with the Ballantynes, who\r\npublished Blackwood's Magazine, one of the most profitable periodicals\r\nin the United Kingdom. This connection led to an acquaintance with John\r\nWilson, better known as 'Christopher North,' of 'Old Ebony.' When the\r\nprinters were in haste, I have frequently walked down to his residence\r\nin Gloucester Place, and sat by his side, waiting patiently, hour after\r\nhour, for copy. The professor always wrote in the night, and would\r\nfrequently dash off one of his splendid articles between supper and\r\ndaybreak. His study was a small room, containing a table littered with\r\npaper, the walls garnished with a few pictures, while heaps of books\r\nwere scattered wherever chance might direct. At this table might have\r\nbeen seen the famous professor of moral philosophy, stripped to his\r\nshirt and pantaloons, the former open in front, and displaying a vast,\r\nhirsute chest, while a slovenly necktie kept the limp collar from utter\r\nloss of place. This was his favorite state for composition, and was in\r\ntrue keeping with the character and productions of his genius. When in\r\npublic, the professor was still a sloven; but his heavy form and\r\nmajestic head and countenance--though he was not a tall man--at once\r\ncommanded respect. He never appeared anything but the philosopher, and\r\nI, who saw him in the dishabille of his study, never lost my awe for his\r\ngreatness. He had a worthy family, and maintained an excellent\r\nestablishment. Aytoun, who is now editor of Blackwood, married one of\r\nhis daughters, and has proved, by his stirring ballads, that he was\r\nworthy of such an alliance. In writing, the professor eschewed gas\r\nlight, and made use of the more classic lamp. A bottle of wine was his\r\ncompanion, and stood at his elbow until exhausted. This will perhaps\r\nexplain much of the convivial character of the 'Notes.' The\r\nold-fashioned quill pen was his preference; and as the hours advanced,\r\nand mental excitement waxed in activity, the profuse spattering of ink\r\nrattled like rain. As a matter of course, his pay was of the highest\r\nrate, and his articles were read with avidity. One reason of this may be\r\nfound in the boldness with which he drags into the imaginary colloquies\r\nof _Noctes Ambrosianae_ the literati of both kingdoms. This liberty was\r\nsometimes felt keenly, and sharply resented. Poor James Hogg, the\r\n'Ettrick Shepherd,' who was just then getting a position in the literary\r\nworld, sometimes found himself figuring unexpectedly in the scenes, as\r\nthe victim of relentless wit. As a retaliation, Hogg attacked Wilson in\r\na sheet which he was then publishing in the Cowgate, under the aid and\r\npatronage of a hatter.\r\n\r\nIt was one of John Wilson's fancies to affect a love of boxing, and it\r\nwas a favorite theme in the 'Ambrosial Discussions.' From this some have\r\nimagined that he was of a pugilistic turn, whereas he knew nothing of\r\nthe 'science,' and only affected the knowledge in jest.\r\n\r\nNext to old 'Kit North,' the most truly beloved contributor to Blackwood\r\nwas 'Delta,' whose poetry was for years expected, almost of course, in\r\nevery number. As Wilson's identity was well-nigh lost in his imaginary\r\ncharacter, so plain Dr. Moir was, in the literary world, merged in\r\n'Delta' of Blackwood. But to the inhabitants of Musselburg he sustained\r\na character altogether different, and the gentle _Delta_ was only known\r\nas one worthy of the title of 'the good physician.' I lived at\r\nMusselburg two years, and had ample opportunities of personal\r\nacquaintance. Dr. Moir was a man of highly benevolent countenance, and\r\nof quiet and retiring manners. His practice was very extensive, and at\r\nalmost all hours he could have been seen driving an old gray horse\r\nthrough the streets and suburbs of the town. The ancient character of\r\nMusselburg seemed to have been as congenial to his temperament as\r\nNuremberg was to that of Hans Sachs. Indeed, in antiquity it can glory\r\nover 'Auld Reekie,' according to the quaint couplet,--\r\n\r\n  'Musselboro' was a boro' when Edinburgh was nane;\r\n  Musselboro'll be a boro' when Edinburgh is gane.'\r\n\r\nMoir was buried at Inveresk, where his remains are honored by a noble\r\nmonument; the memory of his genius will be cherished by all readers of\r\nBlackwood. He died in 1854.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged on the Encyclopedia to which we have made reference, I\r\nmade the acquaintance of McCulloch, the distinguished writer of\r\nfinances, who furnished the article on 'Banking.'\r\n\r\nHowever distinguished may have been the position of this man in point of\r\ntalent, he failed utterly to command respect; and I chiefly remember his\r\ncoarse, overbearing tone of boastful superiority, and his abusive\r\nlanguage to the compositors who set up his MSS. That they found the\r\nlatter difficult of deciphering is not surprising, since the sheet\r\nlooked less like human calligraphy than a row of bayonets. McCulloch had\r\nedited the '_Scotsman_' with decided ability, and having attracted the\r\nattention of Lord Brougham, had received an appointment in the\r\nstationer's office. But in his promotion he quickly forgot his humble\r\norigin, and displayed his native vulgarity by lording it over the\r\ncraftsmen who gave form and life to his thoughts.\r\n\r\nAmong the giants of Scotland at that time, Thomas Chalmers ranked chief,\r\nand the death of Sir Walter Scott had left him without a peer. I used to\r\nmeet him as he took his early walks, and in his loving way of greeting\r\nyouth he often bade me a cheerful good-morning. He was then living at\r\nKinghorn, about eight miles from Edinburgh. Dr. Chalmers' robust stature\r\nwas in keeping with the power of his intellect. He was of massive frame,\r\nand displayed a breadth of shoulder which seemed borrowed from the\r\nFarnese Hercules. Though so distinguished as a divine, there was nothing\r\nclerical in his appearance--nothing of that air of 'the cloth' which at\r\nonce proclaims the preacher. His noble features were generally\r\noverspread with a benevolent smile, which seemed to shed an illumination\r\nas though from the ignition of the soul; while at other times he was\r\npossessed with a spirit of abstraction as if walking in a dream.\r\n\r\nAs a theologian, Chalmers was great beyond any of his contemporaries;\r\nand yet, strictly speaking, his genius was mathematical, rather than\r\ntheological. In this respect he resembled that famed American of whom he\r\nprofessed himself a disciple--Jonathan Edwards. Of the latter it is\r\nstated by no less a critic than the author of the _Eclipse of Faith_\r\n(Henry Rogers), that he was born a mathematician. Chalmers, however, was\r\na master of all science, and it would have been difficult for even a\r\nspecialist to have taken him at an advantage. As greatness is always set\r\noff by simplicity, the latter feature was one of the chief beauties in\r\nwhat we may call the Chalmerian Colossus. I have often seen him leaning\r\nupon the half open door of a smithy, conversing with the intelligent\r\nworkmen, as they rested from the use of the sledge. Having referred to\r\nhis love of children, I may add, in respect to myself, that when I, in\r\nmy childhood, spoke to him in the street, I was generally favored with\r\nan apple. He was indeed an ardent lover of the young, and his genius\r\nseemed to gather freshness from his intercourse with childhood.\r\n\r\nEdinburgh will not soon forget his interest in the welfare of the poor,\r\nin which he has been so ably seconded by the present Dr. Guthrie. I well\r\nremember beholding the two Christian reformers, standing above the slums\r\nof the city, contemplating the fields which the latter had assumed.\r\nSuddenly Chalmers clapped his friend upon the back, and exclaimed, in\r\nrude pleasantry, 'Wow, Tummus Guthrie, but ye ha a bonnie parish.'\r\nChalmers' pronunciation was singularly broad, and not easily understood\r\nby many. Stopping once, during a tour in England, at a place where there\r\nwas a seminary, a gentleman inquired of him how many Scotch boys were in\r\nattendance. 'Saxtain or savantain,' was the reply. 'Enough,' says the\r\ngentleman, _sotto voce_, to corrupt a whole school.' As regards\r\ncalligraphy, Chalmers wrote the most illegible hand in Scotland. He\r\ncould not even read it himself, and was frequently obliged to call his\r\nwife and daughters to his aid. Many of his discourses, when intended for\r\nthe press, were copied by them. His manuscript, when fresh from his\r\nhand, looked as though a fly had fallen into the ink-stand, and then\r\ncrawled over the page. When his letters were received at his paternal\r\nhome, the language of the father was, 'A letter from Tummus, eh; weel,\r\nwhen he comes hame, he maun read it himsel.' There was something\r\nHomeric in Chalmers' mind; and Hugh Miller always considered him the\r\nbard of the Free Church, as well as its great theologian and still\r\ngreater benefactor; and this, too, notwithstanding the fact that he\r\nnever wrote a line of verse in his life. The simplest truths, when\r\nannounced by him, took a poetic shape, and moved along with all the\r\nmajesty of his towering genius. Speaking of Hugh Miller brings him\r\nbefore us at the time that he was writing for the _Caledonia Mercury_.\r\nHe was then editor of _The Witness_, but gave to the former paper such\r\nmoments as he could abstract from his more serious duties. His\r\ndepartment in the _Mercury_ was the reviewing new publications. Besides\r\nhis engagement with these two journals, he was pursuing those studies\r\nwhich made him the prince of British geologists. Geology was his\r\npassion. Indeed, while writing leaders for the _Witness_, or turning\r\nover the leaves of hot-pressed volumes, his mind was wandering among\r\nsuch scenes as the 'Lake of Stromness,' and the 'Old Red Sandstone' of\r\nhis native Cromarty. His geological sketches in the _Witness_ were a new\r\nfeature in journalism, and formed the basis of that work which so\r\nadmirably refuted the 'Vestiges of Creation.' I met Miller daily for\r\nseveral years. He was tall, and of a well-built and massive frame, and\r\nevidently capable of great endurance, both of mind and body. Considered\r\nas one of the distinguished instances of self-made men, Hugh Miller\r\nfinds his only parallel in Horace Greeley, although the path to\r\ngreatness was in the first instance even more laborious than in the\r\nlatter. Let any one read Miller's experiences and adventures, as\r\ndescribed in 'My Schools and my Schoolmasters,' and he will find a\r\nrenewed suggestion of the thought which Johnson so pathetically breathes\r\nin his 'London:'--\r\n\r\n  'The mournful truth is everywhere confessed,\r\n  Slow rises worth by poverty depressed.'\r\n\r\nMiller's appearance, when in trim attire, was that of the Scottish\r\n'Dominie,' or parish schoolmaster; but, like the great American editor,\r\nhe was exceedingly slovenly, both by nature and by long habits of\r\ncarelessness. When in the street, he always wore the plaid, although\r\nthat garment was quite out of use, and indicated at once something\r\nquaint or rustic in the wearer. At this time Miller was living in one of\r\nthe suburbs of Edinburgh, called Porto Bello. When we exchanged\r\ngreetings in the street, his countenance, usually overcast with the pale\r\nhue of thought, would light up with a bright and open smile, which\r\ncontinued as long as he was speaking, but soon yielded to returning\r\nabstraction. One of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen was the\r\ngroups of youth whom Miller used to invite as companions of an afternoon\r\nwalk. None were forbidden on the score of childhood, and many a 'wee\r\nbairn' trotted after the larger lads who accompanied 'the gude\r\nstane-cracker,' and 'the bonnie mon what gaes amang the rocks.' He might\r\nwell be called the 'stane-cracker,' since I have seen him on Calton\r\nHill, or Arthur's Seat, or among the crags, lecturing, in a calm, quiet\r\ntone, on the mysteries which his hammer had brought to light. These were\r\nthe only recreations of one whose days and nights were, with the\r\nexception of a brief and often wakeful season of rest, given to\r\nlaborious study. Had he indulged more freely in them, he might have\r\nescaped the terrible fate which overtook him. But he never could\r\nemancipate himself from the labor to which he was chained. His\r\n'Impressions of England,' which is one of the most delightful of his\r\nbooks, was the product of a subsequent tour for health. If such were his\r\nrecreations, what must have been his labors? Miller's domestic life did\r\nmuch to cheer an over-worked system. He gives, in the 'Schools and\r\nSchoolmasters,' a pleasing allusion to the fascination of his courtship;\r\nand his subsequent life was graced by one whoso appearance, as I\r\nremember her, was singularly lovely and interesting. In his home circle,\r\nMiller was truly a happy man. I may remark, in passing, that this is a\r\nfeature in Scottish genius. While Shelley, Byron, Bulwer, Dickens, and\r\nother English authors, have been wrecked by home difficulties, Scott,\r\nChalmers, Miller, Wilson, and the whole line of Scottish authors, drank\r\ndeep of domestic felicity. Perhaps this may be explained by the contrast\r\nbetween the warmth of Scottish character, and the saturnine and unsocial\r\ndisposition of the English. Edinburgh could at that time boast of two\r\ndistinguished men of the name of Miller; and the great geologist had\r\nalmost his fellow in the professor of surgery. The two were very\r\nintimate, and the one found in the other not only a friend, but a\r\nfaithful medical adviser. Professor Miller was then printing his leading\r\nwork, and I had frequent occasion to visit him with reference to its\r\npublication. One morning, as I rang, the professor came to the door with\r\na hurried and nervous step. As it opened, I noted that his tall form was\r\npeculiarly agitated, and his countenance was deadly pale. In a calm,\r\nsubdued voice, he informed me that Hugh Miller had just committed\r\nsuicide with a pistol. The terrible news overcame me with a shudder, and\r\nI almost sank to the floor. The fact was not yet generally known; and\r\noh, when it should be made public, what a blow would be felt by the\r\nmoral and scientific world! The professor knew that the affair might\r\npossibly be ascribed by some to accident, but he at once referred it to\r\ninsanity. The over-worked brain of the geologist had been for some time\r\nthreatened with a collapse. He had, in addition to the management of the\r\n_Witness_, been elaborating a work of deep and exhausting character, and\r\nthe mental excitement which accompanied its completion was like\r\ndevouring fire. I have frequently gone to his room at a late hour of the\r\nnight, and found him sitting before the smouldering grate, so absorbed\r\nin thought that, as he balanced the probabilities of contending\r\ntheories, he unwittingly accompanied the mental effort by balancing the\r\npoker on the bar. I have seen, on such an occasion, a greasy stream\r\noozing from the pocket of his fustian coat, and supplied by the roll of\r\nbutter which at morning market he had purchased for home use. On the\r\ntable lay his MSS., so marred with interlinings and corrections, that,\r\nnotwithstanding his neat and delicate hand, it was almost a complete\r\nblot. These habits could not but terminate in utter wreck, and I have\r\never coincided with the professor's opinion as to the cause of his\r\ndeath. This gentleman stated to me a fact not generally known, that a\r\nfew days before the awful catastrophe, the unfortunate man called on him\r\nin great distress, and sought his advice. He complained of a pain in his\r\nhead, and then added an expression of fears with regard to that which\r\nwas to him of untold value. This was his mineral and geological\r\ncollection in Shrub Place, which was, no doubt, the most valuable\r\nprivate one in the kingdom. He was haunted by apprehension of its\r\nrobbery by a gang of thieves, and asked what measures of safety would be\r\nadvisable. The professor endeavored to expel the absurd idea by playful\r\nremark, and supposed himself somewhat successful. The next thing he\r\nheard was the intelligence of his death. It is quite evident that the\r\nfatal revolver was purchased for the defense of his treasures. What a\r\nlesson is this of the danger of excessive application, of unreasonable\r\ntoil, of late hours, and mental tension. A continued exhaustion of his\r\nenergies had brought upon the geologist a state of mental horror from\r\nwhich death seemed the only relief. The reaction of the nervous system\r\nwas, no doubt, similar to that arising from delirium tremens; and thus\r\nextremes met, and the _savant_ perished like the inebriate.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy did not seem complete until another victim should be added.\r\nThe professor took the revolver to Thompson's, on Leith Walk, in order\r\nto learn by examination how many shots had been fired by the unfortunate\r\nsuicide. The gunsmith took the weapon, but handled it so carelessly,\r\nthat it went off in his hands, and the ball caused his death.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of excessive labor, we may observe that this is the general\r\nrule among men of science or letters. They are, as a class, crushed by\r\nengagements and duties, as well as by problems and questions of which\r\nthe world can not even dream.\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh literati know but little of rest or recreation; from the\r\neditor's chair up to the pulpit, they are under a lash as relentless as\r\nthat of the taskmaster of Egypt. For instance, we might refer to\r\nBuchanan, of the _Mercury_. He has sat at his desk until he has become\r\nan old man, with the smallest imaginable subtraction of time for food\r\nand sleep, writing night and day, and carrying, in his comprehensive\r\nbrain, the whole details of an influential journal. This feature,\r\nhowever, is not confined to the Old World, and may easily be paralleled\r\nin the journalism of America. Both Raymond, of the _Times_, and Bennett,\r\nof the _Herald_, almost live in the editorial function; and the former\r\nof these, though now Speaker of the Assembly, will either pen his\r\nleaders in his desk, during the utterance of prosy speeches, or in hours\r\nstolen from sleep after adjournment. In addition to these, we might\r\nquote the caustic language of Mr. Greeley, in reference to some\r\nmechanics who had 'struck,' in order to reduce their day's labor (we\r\nthink to nine hours). 'He was in favor of short days of work, and having\r\nlabored eighteen hours per diem for nearly twenty years, he was now\r\ngoing to \"strike\" for fifteen during the rest of his life.' But I doubt\r\nthe success of Mr. Greeley's 'strike,' and apprehend that his early\r\napplication has continued with but little abatement.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Edinburgh for the New World, it was my good fortune to\r\nbecome acquainted with Jeffrey. He was at this time not so much\r\ndistinguished as the reviewer, as he was by his new title of Lord\r\nJeffrey, Judge of Court Session, with a salary of L3000 per annum. Lord\r\nJeffrey was a small man, of light but elegant make, and peculiarly\r\nsymmetrical. His head was quite small, but his countenance was of an\r\nimposing character; and his eye, brilliant but not fierce, often melted\r\ninto a pensive tenderness. Such was Jeffrey's appearance on the bench in\r\nhis latter days. I should have little judged from it that he was the\r\nrelentless critic, whoso withering sarcasm was felt from the garrets of\r\nGrub Street to the highest walk of science or university life. My\r\nintimacy with Ballantyne, who published the _Edinburgh Review_, often\r\nbrought the different MSS. before me, and I could contrast the exquisite\r\nneatness of Wardlaw with the slanting school-boy hand of Jeffrey. The\r\ntone and style of review literature have changed greatly since its\r\ninception, when each quarterly gloried in the character of a literary\r\nogre, and dead men's bones lay round its doors, as erst about the castle\r\nof Giant Despair. Authors are not now thrown to the wild beasts for the\r\nentertainment of the multitude, as in former days; and had John Keats,\r\nor even poor Henry Kirke White, written and published fifty years later,\r\nthey would never have perished by the critic's pen. Yet the same\r\nmalignant assault which crushed their tender muse was the only thing\r\nwhich could amuse the latent powers of a far greater genius; and had not\r\nByron been as cruelly attacked by the _Edinburgh_, he would never have\r\ngiven 'Childe Harold' to the world. The authorship of that most unjust\r\nand malignant _critique_, which, however brief, was sufficient to make\r\nthe author of 'the Hours of Idleness,' foe the time, contemptible, was\r\nlong a secret; but it is now admitted that it was by Jeffrey. Little did\r\nthe murderous critic think that his challenge would bring out an\r\nadversary who would soon unhorse him, and then dash victoriously over\r\nthe field under the especial patronage of fame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE HUGUENOT FAMILIES IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nTHE HUGUENOTS OF ULSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that the lands of the early Huguenot settlers in Ulster\r\nCounty were so arranged in small lots, and within sight of each other,\r\nas to prevent surprise from the Indians whilst their owners were\r\ncultivating them. Louis Bevier, one of the most honored patentees, was\r\nthe ancestor of the highly-respectable family bearing his name in that\r\nregion. When he was about to leave France, his father became so\r\nexasperated, that he refused to bestow upon him the commonest\r\ncivilities. Nor would he condescend to return the kind salutations of\r\nanother son in the public streets, affectionately offered by the pious\r\nemigrant, and for the last time.\r\n\r\nAnother of the patentees, Deyo, visited France to claim his confiscated\r\nestates, but, failing of success, returned. Kingston, at this early\r\nperiod, was the only trading post or village for the French Protestants,\r\nand sixteen miles distant from their settlement, although in a straight\r\nline. Paltz was not more than eight miles west of the Hudson River; this\r\nroute, M. Deyo undertook, alone, to explore--but never returned. It was\r\nthought that the adventurous Huguenot died suddenly, or was devoured by\r\nthe wild beasts. A truss and buckle which he owned were found about\r\nthirty years afterwards, at the side of a large hollow tree. His life\r\nseems to have been one full of toils and dangers, having endured severe\r\nsufferings for conscience' sake, before he reached Holland from France.\r\nFor days he concealed himself in hiding places from his persecutors, and\r\nwithout food, finally escaping alone in a fishing boat, during a\r\nterrific storm.\r\n\r\nThe descendants of the Ulster Dubois are very influential and numerous\r\nin our day, but there is a tradition that this family at one time was in\r\ngreat danger of becoming extinct. For a long while it was the custom of\r\nparents to visit Kingston, for the purpose of having their children\r\nbaptized. M. Dubois and wife were returning from such a pious visit, and\r\nwhile crossing the Roundout, on the ice, it gave way, plunging the\r\nhorses, sleigh and party in the rapid stream. With great presence of\r\nmind, the mother threw her infant, an only son, upon a floating frozen\r\ncake, which, like the ark of Moses, floated him safely down the stream,\r\nuntil he was providentially rescued. For some time this child was the\r\nonly male Dubois among the Paltz Huguenots, and had he perished on that\r\nperilous occasion, his family name would also have perished with him;\r\nstill there were seven females of the same house, called the _seven\r\nzuisters_, all of whom married among the most respectable French\r\nProtestant families. To no stock do more families in Ulster County trace\r\ntheir origin than that of Dubois. Some antiquarians deny this tradition\r\nof the seven sisters, but contend that they were _Lefevres_.\r\n\r\nThere were two Le Fevres among the Ulster patentees. Their progenitors\r\nit is said were among those early Protestants of France who\r\ndistinguished themselves for intellectual powers, prominence in the\r\nReformed Church, with enduring patience under the severest trials, and\r\ndeath itself. Le Fevre, a doctor of theology, adorned the French\r\nmetropolis when Paris caught the first means of salvation in the\r\nfifteenth century. He preached the pure gospel within its walls; and\r\nthis early teacher declared '_our religion has only one foundation, one\r\nobject, one head, Jesus Christ, blessed forever. Let us then not take\r\nthe name of Paul, of Apostles, or of Peter. The Cross of Christ alone\r\nopens heaven and shuts the gates of hell_.' In 1524, he published a\r\ntranslation of the New Testament, and the next year a version of the\r\nPsalms. Many received the Holy Scriptures from his hands, and read them\r\nin their families, producing the happiest results. Margaret, the\r\nbeautiful and talented Princess of Valois, celebrated by all the wits\r\nand scholars of the time, embraced the true Christianity, uniting her\r\nfortune and influence with the Huguenots, and the Reformation thus had a\r\nwitness in the king's court. She was sister to Francis the First, the\r\nreigning monarch. By the hands of this noble lady, the Bishop of Meuse\r\nsent to the king a translation of St. Paul's Epistles, richly\r\nilluminated, he adding, in his quaint and beautiful language, 'They will\r\nmake a truly royal dish of fatness, that never corrupts, and having the\r\npower to restore from all manner of sickness. The more we taste them,\r\nthe more we hunger after them, with desires that are ever fed and never\r\ncloyed.'\r\n\r\nAbraham Hasbroucq, which is the original orthography of the name among\r\nthe patentees, was a native of Calais, and the first emigrant of that\r\nfamily to America, in 1675, with a party of Huguenot friends; they\r\nresided for a while in the Palatinate on the banks of the Rhine. To\r\ncommemorate their kindness, when they reached our shores the new\r\nsettlement was called '_De Paltz_,' now '_New Paltz_,' as the Palatinate\r\nwas always styled by the Dutch. Here, also, the beautiful stream flowing\r\nthrough New Paltz was known by the name of _Walkill_, after the river\r\nWael, a branch of the Rhine, running into Holland.\r\n\r\nThe first twelve patentees, or the '_Duzine_,' managed the affairs of\r\nthe infant settlement as long as they lived, and after their death it\r\nwas a custom to elect a court officer from among the descendants of\r\neach, at the annual town meetings. For a long period they kept in one\r\nchest all the important papers of their property and land titles. The\r\npastor or the oldest man had charge of the key, and reference was made\r\nto this depository for the settlement of all difficulties about\r\nboundaries. Hence they were free from legal suits as to their lands; and\r\nto this judicious, simple plan may be traced the well-known harmony of\r\nthe numerous descendants in this region,--the fidelity of their\r\nlandmarks, with the absence of litigation.\r\n\r\nWe know of no region in our land where property has remained so long in\r\nthe same families, as it has at New Paltz; since its first settlement,\r\nthere has been a constant succession of intermarriages among the French\r\ndescendants, and many continue to reside upon the venerable homesteads\r\nof their early and honored forefathers.\r\n\r\nDevoted as the Huguenots ever had been to the worship of the Almighty,\r\none of their first objects at New Paltz was the erection of a church. It\r\nwas built of logs, and afterwards gave place to a substantial edifice of\r\nbrick, brought from Holland, the place answering the double purpose of\r\nchurch and fort. Their third house of worship was an excellent stone\r\nbuilding, which served the Huguenots for eighty years, when it was\r\ndemolished in 1839, and the present splendid edifice placed on the\r\nvenerable spot and dedicated to the service of Almighty God. It is\r\nrelated that a clergyman of eccentric dress and manners, at an early\r\nperiod, would occasionally make a visit to New Paltz, and, for the\r\npurpose of meditation, would cross the Walkill in a canoe, to some large\r\nelms growing upon a bank opposite the church; on one occasion the stream\r\nwas low, and while pushing across with a pole, it broke, and the\r\nDominie, losing his balance, pitched overboard. He succeeded, however,\r\nin reaching the shore, and proceeded to the nearest house, for the\r\npurpose of drying his clothes. This partly accomplished, he entered the\r\npulpit and informed his congregation that he had intended to have\r\npreached a sermon on baptism; but, eyeing his garments, he observed that\r\n_circumstances_ prevented, as he could now sympathize with Peter, and\r\ntake the text, 'Lord, save, or I perish.'\r\n\r\nTo serve God according to the dictates of their own conscience, had ever\r\nbeen a supreme duty with the French Protestants, and paramount to\r\neverything else. For this they had endured the severest persecutions in\r\nFrance, and had sacrificed houses, lands, kindred and their native\r\nhomes; they had crossed a trackless ocean, and penetrated the howling\r\nwilderness, inhabited by savage tribes--and for what?--To serve their\r\nMAKER, and the RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE. They had been the salt of France,\r\nand brought over with them their pious principles, with their\r\nBibles,--the most precious things. Some of these faded volumes are still\r\nto be found among the children of the American Huguenots, and we have\r\noften seen and examined one of the most venerable copies. It is\r\nDiodati's French Bible, with this title:--\r\n\r\n  LA SAINTE\r\n  BIBLE,\r\n  INTERPRETEE PAR JEAN DIODATI,\r\n  MDCXLIII.\r\n  IMPRIMEE A GENEVE.\r\n\r\nThe sacred book is 219 years old, in excellent condition, and well\r\ncovered with white dressed deerskin, its ties of the same material. It\r\nwas brought to America by Louis Bevier, a French Protestant of Ulster,\r\nand has been preserved as a precious family relic through nine\r\ngenerations. It was carried from France to Holland, and thence to New\r\nPaltz. 'Blessed Book! the hands of holy martyrs have unfolded thy sacred\r\npages, and their hearts been cheered by thy holy truths and promises!'\r\nThere is also a family record written in the volume, faintly legible, of\r\nthe immediate descendants of Louis Bevier and his wife, Maria Lablau,\r\nfrom the year 1674 to 1684.\r\n\r\nAbove anything else did the Huguenots of France love their BIBLES.\r\nVarious edicts, renewed in 1729, had commanded the seizure and\r\ndestruction of _all_ books used by the Protestants, and for this\r\npurpose, any consul of a commune, or any priest, might enter the houses\r\nto make the necessary search. We may therefore compute by millions the\r\nvolumes destroyed in obedience to these royal edicts. On the 17th of\r\nApril, 1758, about 40,000 books were burned at one time in Bordeaux; and\r\nit is also well known that at Beaucaire, in 1735, there was an\r\nauto-da-fe almost equal to that of Bordeaux. It was a truly sad day, in\r\nFrance, when the old family BIBLE must be given up; the book doubly\r\nrevered and most sacred, because it was the WORD of GOD, and sacred too\r\nfrom the recollections connected with it! Grandparents, parents, and\r\nchildren, all, from their earliest infancy, had daily seen, read and\r\ntouched it. Like the household deities of the ancients, it had been\r\nalways present at all the joys and sorrows of the family. A touching\r\ncustom inscribed on the first or last pages, and at times even upon its\r\nmargins, the principal events in all those beloved lives. Here were the\r\nBirths, Baptisms, Marriages, and the Deaths. Now all these tender, pious\r\nrecords must perish at once in the flames.\r\n\r\nBut mind, immortal mind, could not be destroyed; for free thought, and\r\ntruth, and instruction, among the people, were companions of the\r\nReformation, and books would circulate among all ranks throughout\r\nProtestant France. The works generally came from Holland through Paris,\r\nand from Geneva, by Lyons or Grenoble. Inside of baled goods, and in\r\ncases and barrels of provisions, secretly, thousands of volumes were\r\nsent from north to south, from east to west, to the oppressed Huguenots.\r\nThe great work which Louis XIV. believed buried beneath the ruins of his\r\nbloody edicts still went on silently. At Lausanne was established a\r\nseminary, about the year 1725, where works for the French Protestant\r\npeople were printed and circulated. The Bishop of Canterbury, with Lord\r\nWarke, and a few foreign sovereigns, actively assisted in the founding\r\nof this institution. Thus did that beautiful town become the source of\r\nuseful and religious knowledge to thousands, although it was conveyed\r\nfar and wide in a very quiet and secret way. One man was condemned to\r\nthe galleys for having received barrels, marked '_Black and White\r\nPeas_,' which were found full of 'Ostervald's Catechisms.'\r\n\r\nHow strange it seems to us, writing in our own Protestant land, that\r\ncruel authority should ever have intervened with matters of faith! What\r\ncan be more plain or truthful than that there should be liberty of\r\nconscience; and that God alone has the power and the right to direct it,\r\nand that it is an abuse and a sacrilege to come between God and\r\nconscience? After the revocation of the edict of Nantes and the death of\r\nLouis XIV., his royal successor sometimes vaguely asked himself why he\r\npersecuted his Protestant subjects? when his marshal replied, that his\r\nmajesty was only the executor of former edicts. He seemed to have\r\nconsoled himself that he had found the system _already_ established, and\r\nhe only carried out the errors of his predecessor. Forty years of\r\nremorseless persecutions against his best subjects, without asking\r\nhimself why! Of all the weaknesses of his reign, this was the most\r\nodious and the most guilty; his hand was most literally weary of signing\r\ncruel edicts against the Protestants of his kingdom, without even\r\nreading them, and which obedience to his mandates had to transcribe in\r\nletters of fire and blood, on the remotest parts of his realm.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the Frenchmen of Ulster, who for some time after their\r\nemigration used their own language, until a consultation was held to\r\ndetermine whether this, or the English or Dutch, should be adopted in\r\nthe families. As the latter was generally spoken in the neighboring\r\nplaces,--Kingston, Poughkeepsie and Newburgh,--and also at the schools\r\nand churches, it was decided to speak Dutch only to their children and\r\nservants. Having for a while, however, continued the use of their native\r\ntongue, some of the Huguenot descendants in the Paltz still write their\r\nnames as their French ancestors wrote them more than two centuries ago.\r\nDubois, Bevier, Deyeau, Le Fevre, Hasbroque, are well-known instances.\r\n\r\n_Petronella_ was once an admired name among the Huguenot ladies, and\r\nbecame almost extinct in Ulster at one time. The last was said to have\r\nbeen Petronella Hasbroque, a lady distinguished for remarkable traits of\r\ncharacter. Judge Hasbroque, of Kingston, the father of the former\r\nPresident of Rutger's College, was very anxious that his son would give\r\nthis name to one of his daughters. In case of compliance, a handsome\r\nmarriage portion was also promised; but the parents declined the\r\ngenerous offer, whether from a dislike to the name, or a belief that the\r\nproperty would be theirs, at any rate, some day, is not known. A\r\ngranddaughter, however, of a second generation, named her first-born\r\nPetronella, and thus gratifying the desire of her near kinsman, secured\r\na marriage portion for the heir, and preserved the much-admired name\r\nfrom oblivion--certainly three important results.\r\n\r\nIt was a well-known and distinguished trait of the New Paltz Huguenots,\r\nthat but few intermarriages have taken place among their own families\r\n(_Walloon_); they differed in this respect from all other French\r\nProtestants who emigrated to America and mingled with the other\r\npopulation by matrimonial alliances. In Kingston, Poughkeepsie, and\r\nother neighborhoods, near by, there is an unusual number of Dutch\r\nnames--the Van Deusens, Van Benschotens, Van Kleeds, Van Gosbeeks, Van\r\nDe Bogerts, Van Bewer, and others, almost _ad infinitum_, whilst for\r\nmiles around the populous and wealthy town of Old Paltz scarcely a\r\nfamily can be found with such patronymics. Notwithstanding, somewhat\r\nlike the Israelites, these Frenchmen classed themselves, in a measure,\r\nas a distinct and separate people; still, the custom did not arise from\r\nany dislike to the Hollanders,--on the contrary, they were particularly\r\nattached to that people, who had been their best friends, both in\r\nHolland and America; and these associations were ever of a most friendly\r\nand generous character. After a while, the Huguenots of Ulster adopted\r\nnot only the language, but the customs and habits of the Dutch. After\r\nthe destruction of the Protestant churches at Rochelle, in 1685, the\r\ncolonists of that city came in such numbers to the settlement of New\r\nYork, that it was necessary sometimes to print public documents not only\r\nin Dutch and English, but French also.\r\n\r\nWe do not wish to make our articles a Doomsday-book for the Huguenots,\r\nstill it is pleasant for their descendants to know that they came from\r\nsuch honorable stock, and, with all of our boasted republicanism, we are\r\nnot ashamed that we _are_ so born. Here are some of the names to be\r\nfound in the old records of Ulster:--Abraham Hausbrough, Nicholas\r\nAntonio, 'Sherriffe' Moses Quartain, 'Leon,' Christian Dubois, Solomon\r\nHasbrook, Andries Lafeever, Hugo Freer, Peter Low, Samuel Boyce, Roeleff\r\nEltinge, 'Esq.,' Nicholas Roosa, Jacobus DeLametie, Nicholas Depew,\r\n'Esq.,' Philip Viely, Boudwyn Lacounti, 'Capt.'

A Romance of Business. By Richard B.\r\nKimball, Author of 'St. Leger,' 'Romance of Student Life,' &c. New York:\r\nG.P. Putnam; Boston: A.K. Loring. 1861.\r\n\r\nIn the United States about one person in a hundred is engaged in\r\nmercantile pursuits--in other words, in 'broking,' or transferring from\r\nthe producer to the consumer. Of this number, a larger proportion than\r\nin any other country are brokers in the strict sense of the word,\r\nbuying, selling, or exchanging money or its equivalents, and managing\r\ncredit so that others may turn it into capital. A more active, eventful,\r\nprecarious and extraordinary life, or one calling more for the exercise\r\nof sharpness and shrewdness, does not exist, than that of these men.\r\nThey are among regular business men what the 'free lance' is among\r\nmilitary men, or the privateer among those of the true marine. Any one\r\nwho has been familiar with one of the 'craft,' has probably heard him\r\nsay at one time or another--'what I have seen would make one of the most\r\nremarkable novels you ever read;' and he spoke the literal truth.\r\n\r\nRealizing this fact, Mr. KIMBALL, a lawyer of twenty years' standing in\r\nWall St., and consequently perfectly familiar with all its\r\ncharacteristics, has devoted literary talents, which long ago acquired\r\nfor him not merely an enviable American but a wide European celebrity,\r\nto describing this broker-life, with its lights and shadows. Choosing a\r\nsingle subject and a single class, he has elaborated it with a\r\ntruthfulness which is positively _startling_. As we often know that a\r\nportrait is perfect from its manifest verisimilitude, so we feel from\r\nevery chapter of this book that the author has, with strictest fidelity,\r\nadhered to real life with pre-Raphaelitic accuracy but without\r\npre-Raphaelitic servility to any tradition or set mannerism. The pencil\r\nof a reporter, the lens of the photographer, are recalled by his\r\nsketches, and not less life-like, simple and excellent are the\r\nreflections of the business office as shown in its influence in the home\r\ncircle. The reader will recall the extraordinary popularity which\r\ncertain English romances, setting forth humble unpoetic life, have\r\nenjoyed of late years. We refer to the _Adam Bede_ and _Silas Marner_\r\nschool of tales, in which every twig is drawn, every life-lineament set\r\nforth with a sort of DENNER minuteness--truthful, yet constrained,\r\naccurate but petty. In this novel, Mr. KIMBALL, while retaining all the\r\naccuracy of _Adam Bede_, has swept more broadly and forcibly out into\r\nlife;--there are strong sorrows, great trials seen from the stand-point\r\nof a man of the world, and a free, bold color which startles us, while\r\nwe, at the same time, recognize its reality.\r\n\r\nThe 'hero' of the work is a merchant, who, like many others after\r\nincurring bankruptcy, takes to Wall Street--to selling notes as an\r\nunder-broker for a living. In describing his trials, the author has,\r\nwith consummate skill and extraordinary knowledge of both causes and\r\neffects, pointed out the peculiarities, institutions, and good or bad\r\nworkings of the American mercantile system, in such a manner as to have\r\nattracted from the soundest authority warm praise of his work, as\r\nembodying practical knowledge of a kind seldom found in 'novels.' From\r\n'broking' to speculating--from that again to the old course--alternately\r\nbuoyed up or cast down, through trials and troubles, the bankrupt, at\r\nlast, in his darkest hour, lands on that 'luck' which in America comes\r\nsooner or later to every one. It is worth remarking that in all his\r\ncharacters, as in his scenes, the author is careful to maintain the\r\nbalance of truth. He shows us that among the sharks and harpies of Wall\r\nStreet there are phases of honor and generosity--that the arrogance or\r\ncoldness of a bank-officer may have a rational foundation--that feelings\r\nas intense are awakened in common business pursuits as in the most\r\ndramatic and erratic lives. In this _just_ treatment of character,--this\r\navoiding of the old saint and angel system of depicting men,--KIMBALL is\r\ntruly pre-eminent, and under it even the casual SOL DOWNER strikes us\r\nwith an individuality and a force not inferior to that of the hero\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWe can not take leave of this truly remarkable book without referring to\r\nthe under-current of kindly, humane feelings with which it abounds.\r\nThere is a delicate, tremulous sympathy for the sufferings and joys\r\nwhich he depicts, which reflects the highest credit on the author. There\r\nare, in this book, unaffected touches of pathos, founded on the most\r\nnatural events in the world, which have never been surpassed by any\r\nnovelist.\r\n\r\nWe are glad that novelists are leaving romance and going to real life.\r\nOne breaking into the harsh industry of the factory and market, another\r\ntaking down the joys and sorrows of the humble weaver, another\r\ndescribing, as in this work, the strange hurrying life of the 'outside\r\nbroker' to the sharpest-cut detail,--all giving us truth and observation\r\nin the place of vague imagination;--such are the best results of late\r\nliterature; and prominent among these the future historian will place\r\nthe Under-currents of Wall Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARET HOWTH. A Story of To-Day. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 1862.\r\n\r\nWe know of no other truly American novel into which so many elements\r\nhave been forced by the strength of genius into harmony, as in _Margaret\r\nHowth_. One may believe, in reading it, that the author, wearied of the\r\nold cry that the literature of our country is only a continuation of\r\nthat of Europe, had resolved to prove, by vigorous effort, that it _is_\r\npossible to set forth, not merely the incidents of our industrial life\r\nin many grades, in its purely idiomatic force, but to make the world\r\nrealize that in it vibrate and struggle outward those aspirations, germs\r\nof culture and reforms which we seldom reflect on as forming a part of\r\nthe inner-being of our very practical fellow-citizens. The work has two\r\ncharacteristics,--it breaks, with a strong intellect and fine\r\ndescriptive power, into a new field, right into the rough of real life,\r\nbringing out fresher and more varied forms than had been done before,\r\nand in doing this makes us understand, with strange ability, how the\r\nthinkers among our people _think_. We all know how it flows _in_ to\r\nthem, from lecture and book, from the _Tribune_ and school--but few,\r\nespecially in the Atlantic cities, know what becomes of culture among\r\nmen and women who 'work and weave in endless motion' in the\r\ncounting-house, or factory, or through daily drudgery and the reverses\r\nfrom wealth to poverty. Others have treated a single **o [transcriber's\r\nnote: illegible word] of life, dramatically and by events, as well as\r\nMiss HARDING, but no one American has dared such intricacies of thought\r\nand character in individuals--has raised them to such a height, and\r\ndeveloped them with such a powerful will, without falling into\r\nconventionalism or improbability. Unlike most novels, its 'plot,' though\r\nexcellent, is its least attraction--we can imagine that the superb pride\r\nwhich gleams out in so many rifts has induced the author to voluntarily\r\navoid display of that ingeniously spinning romantic talent in which\r\nnovelists excel precisely in proportion to their lack of all nobler\r\ngifts. It is a certain rule, as to literary snobs, that in proportion as\r\nthe food which they give diminishes in excellence, does the plate on\r\nwhich it is served increase in value. But let none imagine that\r\n_Margaret Howth_ lacks _interest_--it is replete with burning, vivid,\r\nthrilling interest--it has the attraction which fascinates _all_\r\nreaders, based in a depth of knowledge so extraordinary that it can be\r\ntruly appreciated by but few. The immense popularity which it has\r\nacquired and the general praise awarded it by the press, proves that it\r\nhas gone right to the hearts of the people--whence it came.\r\n\r\nThose who accuse _Margaret Howth_ of harshness and a lack of\r\nwinsomeness, have neither understood the people whom it describes nor\r\nthe degree of stern strength requisite to wrest from life and nature\r\nfresh truth. The pioneers of every great natural school (and every\r\nindication shows that one is now dawning) have quite other than\r\nlute-sounding tasks in hand, however they may hunger and thirst for\r\nbeauty, love, and rose-gardens. Under the current of this book runs the\r\nkeenest, painfulest craving to give freely to life these very\r\nelements--its intensest inner-spirit is of love and beauty; it throbs\r\nand burns with a sympathy for suffering humanity which is at once fierce\r\nand tearful. As regards the minor artistic defects of _Margaret Howth_,\r\nthey are, if we regard it entirely, the shadows inseparable from its\r\nsubstance, felt by those who remain in them, but in no wise detracting\r\nfrom the beauty of the edifice when we regard it from the proper point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\n\r\nETHICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL INQUIRIES, CHIEFLY RELATIVE TO SUBJECTS OF\r\nPOPULAR INTEREST.

Such a position on\r\n    the part of the General Government sets up no claim of a right\r\n    by federal authority to interfere with slavery within State\r\n    limits, referring, as it does, the absolute control of the\r\n    subject, in each case, to the State and its people immediately\r\n    interested.\r\n\r\nIt is almost needless to point out to the reader that the views, both\r\ndirect and implied, which are urged in this message, are in every\r\nrespect identical with those to advance which the CONTINENTAL was\r\nfounded, and for which it has strenuously labored from the beginning.\r\nThere is nothing in them of the 'Abolitionism' which advocates\r\n'immediate and unconditional' freeing of the blacks; while, on the other\r\nhand, the only persons who can object to them are those who hold that\r\nslavery is a good thing in itself, never to be disturbed. It is, in\r\nshort, all that the rational friends of progress can at present\r\ndesire--an official recognition of the great truth that slavery ought to\r\nbe abolished, but in such a manner as to cause the least possible\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to observe the bewilderment of the pro-slavery Northern\r\nDemocratic press, which has so earnestly claimed the Executive as\r\n'conservative,' and on which this message has fallen like a\r\nthunder-clap. They have, of course, at once cried out that, should it\r\nreceive the sanction of Congress, it would still amount to nothing,\r\nbecause no legislature of a slave State will accept it; an argument as\r\nridiculous as it is trivial. That the South would, for the present,\r\ntreat the proposal with scorn, is likely enough. But the edge of the\r\nwedge has been introduced, and emancipation has been at least\r\n_officially_ recognized as desirable. While such a possible means of\r\nsecuring property exists, there will always be a strong party _forming_\r\nin the South, whether they attain to a majority or not, and this party\r\nwill be the germ of disaster to the secessionists. There are men enough,\r\neven in South Carolina, who would gladly be paid for their slaves, and\r\nthese men, while maintaining secession views in full bluster, would\r\nreadily enough find some indirect means of realizing money on their\r\nchattels. It may work gradually--but it _will_ work. As disaster and\r\npoverty increase in the South, there will increase with them the number\r\nof those who will see no insult or injury in the proposition to buy from\r\nthem property which is becoming, with every year, more and more\r\nuncertain in its tenure.\r\n\r\nLet it be remembered that this message was based on the most positive\r\nknowledge held by the Executive of the desires of the Union men in the\r\nSouth, and of their strength. The reader who will reflect for a moment\r\ncan not fail to perceive that, unless it had such a foundation, the\r\nviews advanced in it would have been reckless and inexplicable indeed.\r\nIt was precisely on this basis, and in this manner, that the\r\nCONTINENTAL, in previous numbers, and before it the New York\r\nKNICKERBOCKER Magazine, urged the revival of the old WEBSTER theory of\r\ngradual remunerated emancipation, declaring that the strength of the\r\nUnion party in the South was such as to warrant the experiment.[O] We\r\nhave also insisted, in our every issue, that, while emancipation should\r\nbe borne constantly in view and provided for as something which must\r\neventually be realized for the sake of the advancing interests of WHITE\r\nlabor and its expansion, everything should be effected as gradually _as\r\npossible_, so as to neither interfere with the plans of the war now\r\nwaging, nor to stir up needless political strife. We simply asked for\r\nsome firmly-based official recognition of the rottenness of the 'slavery\r\nplank in the Southern platform,' and trusted that the _utmost_ caution\r\nand deliberation would be observed in eventually forwarding\r\nemancipation. We were literally alone, as a publication, in these views,\r\nand were misrepresented both by the enemies who were behind us and the\r\nzealous friends who were before us. We have never cried for that\r\n'unconditional and immediate emancipation of slavery' with which the\r\n_Liberator_, with the kindest intentions, but most erroneously, credits\r\nus. We should be glad enough to see it, were it possible; but, knowing\r\nthat the immediate-action theory has been delaying the cause for thirty\r\nyears, we have invariably suggested the _firm_ but gradual method. That\r\nmethod has at last been formally advanced by the President, in a manner\r\nwhich can reasonably give offense to no one. The beginning has been\r\nmade: it is for the country to decide whether it--the most important\r\nsuggestion of the age--shall be realized.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe news of the capture of Fort Donelson had barely reached us, the roar\r\nof the guns celebrating our rapid successes had not died away, ere that\r\nfragment of the Northern ultra pro-slavery party which had done so much\r\ntowards deluding the South into secession, impudently raised its head\r\nand began most inopportunely and impertinently to talk of amnesty and\r\nthe rights of the South. There are things which, under certain\r\nlimitations, may be right in themselves, but which, when urged at the\r\nwrong time, become wrongs and insults; and these premature cries to\r\nrestore the enemy to his old social and political standing are of that\r\nnature. They are insufferable, and would be ridiculous, were it not that\r\nin the present critical aspect of our politics they may become\r\ndangerous. Since this war began, we have heard much of the want of true\r\nloyalty in the ultra abolitionists, who would make the object of the\r\nstruggle simply emancipation, without regard to consequences; and we\r\nhave not been sparing in our own condemnations of such a limited and\r\nnarrow view,--holding, as we do, that emancipation, if adopted, should\r\nbe for the sake of the _white man_ and the Union, and not of the negro.\r\nBut 'Abolition' of the most one-sided and suicidal description is less\r\ninsulting to those who are lavishing blood and treasure on the great\r\ncause of freedom, than is the conduct, at this time, of those men who\r\nare now, through their traitorous organs, urging the cry that the hour\r\nis at hand when we must place slavery firmly on a constitutional basis;\r\nthis being, as they assert, the only means whereby the Union can ever be\r\nharmoniously restored.\r\n\r\nIn view of the facts, it is preposterous to admit that this assumption\r\nis even plausible. He must be ignorant indeed of our political history\r\nduring the past twenty years, or strangely blind to its results, who has\r\nnot learned that a belief that the North is ever anxious to concede for\r\nthe sake of its 'interests' has been the great stimulus to the arrogance\r\nof the South. While the principles of the abolitionists have been the\r\nshallow _pretence_, the craven cowardice of such men as BUCHANAN and\r\nCUSHING has been the _real_ incitement to the South to pour insult and\r\nwrong on the North. Concession has been our bane. It was paltering and\r\nconcession that palsied the strong will and ready act which should have\r\nprevented this war; for had it not been for such men as the traitors who\r\nare now crying out for Southern rights, the rebellion would have been\r\nfar more limited in its area, and long since crushed out. No cruelties\r\non our part, no threats to carry all to the bitter end, would so\r\nencourage the South at present, as this offer to shake hands ere the\r\nfight be half over.\r\n\r\nWhen the time comes for amnesty and 'Southern Rights,' we trust that\r\nthey will be considered in a spirit of justice and mercy. Till it comes\r\nlet there be no word spoken of them. The South has, to its own detriment\r\nand to ours, firmly and faithfully _believed_ that Northern men are\r\ncowards, misers, men sneaking through life in all dishonor and baseness.\r\nWhen millions believe such intolerable falsehoods of other millions of\r\ntheir fellow-citizens, they must be taught the truth, no matter what the\r\nlesson costs. Even now the Southern press asserts that our victories\r\nwere merely the results of overwhelming majorities, and that the Yankees\r\nare becoming frightened at their own successes. There is not one of\r\nthese traitorous, dough-face meetings of which the details are not\r\npromptly sent--probably by the men who organize them--all over the South\r\nto inspire faith in a falling cause. When the rebels shall have learned\r\nthat these traitors have positively _no_ influence here,--and the sooner\r\nthey learn it the better,--when they realize that the people of the\r\nNorth are as determined as themselves, and their equals in all noble\r\nqualities, then, and not till then, will it be time to talk of those\r\nconcessions which now strike every one as smacking of meanness and\r\ncowardice.\r\n\r\nThe day has come for a new order of things. The South must learn--and\r\nshow by its acts that it has been convinced--that the North is its equal\r\nin those virtues which it claims to monopolize. But this it will only\r\nlearn from the young and vigorous minds of the new school,--from its\r\n_enemies_,--and not from the trembling old-fashioned traitors, who have\r\nbeen so long at its feet that they shiver and are bewildered, now that\r\nthey are fairly isolated, by the tide of war, from their former ruler.\r\nPoliticians of this stamp, who have grown old while prating of Southern\r\nrights, can not, do not, and never will _realize_ but that, some day or\r\nother, all will be restored in _statu quo ante bellum_. They expect\r\nUnion victories, but somehow believe that their old king will enjoy his\r\nown again--that there will be a morning when the South will rule as\r\nbefore. It is this which inspires their craven timidity. They cry out\r\nagainst emancipation in every form,--blind to the onward and inevitable\r\nchanges which are going on,--so that when the South comes in again they\r\nmay point to their record and say, '_We_ were ever true to you. We,\r\nindeed, urged the war, for we were compelled by you to fight, but we\r\nwere always true to your main principles.' They have wasted time and\r\ntrouble sadly--it will all be of no avail. Be it by the war, be it by\r\nwhat means it may, the social system and political rule of the South are\r\nirrevocably doomed. It may, from time to time, have its convulsive\r\nrecoveries, but it is doomed. The demands of free labor for a wider area\r\nwill make themselves felt, and the black will give way to the white, as\r\nin the West the buffalo vanishes before the bee.\r\n\r\nWe are willing that the question of emancipation should have the widest\r\nscope, and, if expediency shall so dictate, that it should be realized\r\nin the most gradual manner. We believe that, owing to the experiences of\r\nthe past year, more than one slave State will, ere long, contain a\r\nmajority of clear-headed, patriotic men, who will be willing to legalize\r\nthe freedom of all blacks born within their limits, after a certain\r\ntime; and if this time be placed ten years or even fifteen hence, it\r\nwill make no material difference. By that time the pressure of free\r\nlabor, and the increase of manufacturing, will have rendered some such\r\nstep a necessity. Should the payment of all loyal slave-holders, in the\r\nborder States, for their chattels, prove a better plan,--and it could\r\nhardly fail to promptly reduce the rebellious circle to a narrow and\r\nuninfluential body,--let it be tried. If any of the arguments thus far\r\nadduced in favor of assuming slavery to be an institution which is\r\n_never_ to be changed, and which _must_ be immutably fixed in the North\r\nAmerican Union, can be proved to be true, we would say, then let\r\nemancipation be forever forgotten--for the stability of the Union must\r\ntake precedence of everything. But we can not see it in this light. We\r\ncan not see that peace and Union can exist while the slave-holder\r\ncontinues to increase in arrogance in the South, and while the\r\nabolitionists every day gather strength in the North. Every day of this\r\nwar has seen the enemies of slavery increase in number and in power,\r\nuntil to expect them to lose power and influence is as preposterous as\r\nto hope to see the course of nature change. Should a peace be now\r\npatched up on the basis of _immutable_ slavery, we should, to judge from\r\nevery appearance, simply prolong the war to an infinitely more\r\ndisastrous end than it now threatens to assume. We should incur debts\r\nwhich would crush our prosperity; we should bequeath a heritage of woe\r\nto our children, which would prove their ruin. While the great cause of\r\nall this dissension lies legalized and untouched, there will continue to\r\nbe a party which will never cease to strive to destroy it. The question\r\nsimply is, whether we will be wounded now, or utterly slain by and by.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile let us, before all things, push on with the war! It is by our\r\nvictories that slavery will be in the beginning most thoroughly\r\nattacked. If the South, as it professes, means to fight to the last\r\nditch, and to the black flag, all discussion of emancipation is\r\nneedless; for in the track of our armies the contraband assumes freedom\r\nwithout further formula. But we are by no means convinced that such will\r\nbe the case. The _first_ ditches have, as yet, been by no means filled\r\nwith martyrs to secession,--armistices are already subjects of\r\nrumor,--and it should not be forgotten that the Union men of the South\r\nare powerful enough to afford efficient aid in placing the question of\r\nultimate emancipation on a basis suitable to all interests.\r\n\r\nAll that the rational emancipationist requires is a _legal beginning_.\r\nWe have no desire to see it advance more rapidly than the development of\r\nthe country requires--in short, what is really needed is simply the\r\nassurance that by war or by peace _some_ basis shall be found for\r\nultimately carrying out the views of the fathers of the American Union,\r\nand rendering this great nation harmonious and happy. Every day brings\r\nus nearer the great issue,--not of slavery and anti-slavery,--but\r\nwhether slavery is to be assumed as an immutable element in America, or\r\nwhether government will bring such influences to bear as will lead the\r\nway to peace and the rights of free labor. Every step is leading us to\r\n\r\n  THE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT.\r\n\r\n  O Lord, look kindly on this work for thee!\r\n    Yes, smile upon the side that's for the right!\r\n    To them O grant the glorious arm of might,\r\n  And in the end give them the victory!\r\n  Free principles are rushing like the sea\r\n    Which opened for the fleeing Israelite,--\r\n    Free principles, to test their worth in fight,--\r\n  And woe to them that 'twixt the surges be!\r\n  And as, O Lord, thou then did'st show thy care,\r\n    And mad'st a grave to drink thy enemy,\r\n  So now, O Father, sink him in despair--\r\n    The only blight we own--cursed Slavery.\r\n  O then will end the conflict! Yes, God, then\r\n  We'll be indeed a nation of FREE MEN!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe N.O. _Delta_ is full of indignation at the Southern men who are\r\nalarmed for their property, and betrays, in its anger, the fact that\r\nthese disaffected persons are not few in the Pelican State. But,\r\nplucking up courage, it declares that--\r\n\r\n    Our people will retire into the interior, and in their mountains\r\n    and swamps they will maintain a warfare which must ultimately\r\n    prove successful.\r\n\r\nDoubtful--very. In the first place, 'our people' can not very well\r\nswamp it like runaway negroes, and, secondly, they will encounter, in\r\nthe mountains, the Union men of the South. Give us the cities and the\r\nlevel country for a short time, and we shall very soon find the\r\nPelicandidates for comfortable quarters rolling back, by thousands, into\r\nUnionism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs we write, there is a panic in Richmond, caused by the discovery that\r\nthere is a large body of Union men in the city itself, headed by JOHN\r\nMINOR BOTTS, who seems to have determined to 'head off' the secession\r\nparty in its stronghold, 'or die'--he having, since the decease of JOHN\r\nTYLER, turned his 'heading off' abilities against JEFF DAVIS. The\r\n_Examiner_ mentions, in terror, the confession of the Union prisoners,\r\nthat there are in Richmond 'thousands of arms concealed, and men\r\nenrolled, who would use them on the first approach of the Yankee army.'\r\nOne of the arrested, a Mr. STEARNS, when led to the prison, surveyed it\r\nin a most contemptuous manner, remarking 'If you are going to imprison\r\nall the Union men in Richmond, you will have to provide a much larger\r\njail than this.'\r\n\r\nIt is the German residents of Richmond who are said to constitute the\r\nmajority of these Union men. All honor to our German friends of the\r\nSouth! They have received, thus far, too little credit for their staunch\r\nadherence to the principles of freedom. Let them take courage; a day is\r\ncoming when we shall all be free--free from _every_ form of slavery!\r\n_Noch ist die Freiheit nicht verloren_!--'Freedom is not lost as yet.'\r\nSome of them remember _that_ song of old.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA paragraph has recently gone the rounds, which impudently assures the\r\nfriends of Emancipation that, unless they promptly desist from further\r\ninterference or agitation, they will speedily build up a Southern party\r\nin the North, which will seriously interfere with the prosecution of the\r\nwar!\r\n\r\nThat is to say, that the majority of the people of the North fully\r\nacquiesce in the justice of the main principles held by the South--the\r\nonly difference of opinion being whether these slavery and\r\nslavery-extension doctrines can be practically developed under our\r\nfederal Union! Yet we, knowing, seeing, feeling, in this war, the\r\nenormously evil effects of the slave system on the free men among whom\r\nit exists, are expected to endure and legalize _the cause_ which stirred\r\nit up! Either the South is right or wrong--there is no escaping the\r\ndilemma. Either it was or was not justly goaded by 'abolition' into\r\nsecession. If the South is _quite_ right in wishing to preserve slavery\r\nintact forever, surely those are in the wrong who would make war on it\r\nfor wishing to secede from a government which tolerates attacks on\r\nlegalized institutions! What a precious paradox have we here? Yet these\r\nvirtual justifiers of the South in the great cause of the war, claim to\r\nbe zealous and forward in punishing that secession which, according to\r\ntheir own views, is constitutional and right!\r\n\r\nIf slavery be right, then the South is right. No impartial foreigner\r\ncould fail to draw this conclusion under the circumstances of this war.\r\nBut _is_ it right; we do not say as a thing of the past, and of a\r\nrapidly vanishing serf-system, but as an institution of the progressive\r\npresent? Witness the words of G. BATELLE, a member of the Western\r\nVirginia Constitutional Convention,--as we write, in session at\r\nWheeling,--and who has published an address to that body on the question\r\nof Emancipation, from which we extract the following:--\r\n\r\n    The injuries which slavery inflicts upon our own people are\r\n    manifold and obvious. It practically aims to enslave not merely\r\n    another race, but our own race. It inserts in its bill of rights\r\n    some very high-sounding phrases securing freedom of speech; and\r\n    then practically and in detail puts a lock on every man's mouth,\r\n    and a seal on every man's lips, who will not shout for and swear\r\n    by the divinity of the system. It amuses the popular fancy with\r\n    a few glittering generalities in the fundamental law about the\r\n    liberty of the press, and forthwith usurps authority, even in\r\n    times of peace, to send out its edict to every postmaster,\r\n    whether in the village or at the cross-roads, clothing him with\r\n    a despotic and absolute censorship over one of the dearest\r\n    rights of the citizen. It degrades labor by giving it the badge\r\n    of servility, and it impedes enterprise by withholding its\r\n    proper rewards. It alone has claimed exemption from the rule of\r\n    uniform taxation, and then demanded and received the largest\r\n    share of the proceeds of that taxation. Is it any wonder, in\r\n    such a state of facts, that there are this day, of those who\r\n    have been driven from Virginia mainly by this system, men\r\n    enough, with their descendents, and means and energy, scattered\r\n    through the West, of themselves to make no mean State?...\r\n\r\n    It has been as a fellow-observer, and I will add as a\r\n    fellow-sufferer, with the members of the Convention, that my\r\n    judgment of the system of slavery among us has been formed. We\r\n    have seen it seeking to inaugurate, in many instances all too\r\n    successfully, a reign of terror in times of profound peace, of\r\n    which Austria might be ashamed. We have seen it year by year\r\n    driving out from our genial climate, and fruitful soil, and\r\n    exhaustless natural resources, some of the men of the very best\r\n    energy, talent and skill among our population. We have seen\r\n    also, in times of peace, the liberty of speech taken away, the\r\n    freedom of the press abolished, and the willing minions of this\r\n    system, in hunting down their victims, spare from degradation\r\n    and insult neither the young, nor the gray-haired veteran of\r\n    seventy winters, whose every thought was as free from offense\r\n    against society as is that of the infant of days.\r\n\r\nWhen an evil attains this extent, he is a poor citizen, a poor cowardly\r\ndallier with opinions, whatever his fighting mark may be, who can make\r\nup his mind to calmly acquiesce in establishing its permanence, or to\r\nstiffly oppose every movement and every suggestion tending in the least\r\ntowards its abrogation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the present number of the CONTINENTAL will be found an article on\r\nGeneral LYON, in which reference is made to the generally credited\r\nassertion, that the deceased hero was not reinforced as he desired\r\nduring the campaign in Missouri. This is one of the questions which time\r\nalone will properly answer. In accordance with the principles involved\r\nin _audi alteram partem_, we give on this subject the following\r\nabridgment of a portion of General FREMONT'S defense, published in the\r\nNew York _Tribune_ of March 6:--\r\n\r\n    Lyon's and Prentiss's troops were nearly all three months men,\r\n    whose term of enlistment was about expiring. Arms and money were\r\n    wanted, but men offered in abundance. The three months men had\r\n    not been paid. The Home Guards were willing to remain in the\r\n    service, but their families were destitute. Gen. Fremont wrote\r\n    to the President, stating his difficulties, and informing him\r\n    that he should peremptorily order the United States Treasurer\r\n    there to pay over to his paymaster-general the money in his\r\n    possession, sending a force at the same time to take the money.\r\n    He received no reply, and assumed that his purpose was approved.\r\n\r\n    Five days after he arrived at St. Louis he went to Cairo, taking\r\n    three thousand eight hundred men for its reinforcement. He says\r\n    that Springfield was a week's march, and before he could have\r\n    reached it, Cairo would have been taken by the rebels, and\r\n    perhaps St. Louis. He returned to St. Louis on the 4th of\r\n    August, having in the meantime ordered two regiments to the\r\n    relief of Gen. Lyon, and set himself to work at St. Louis to\r\n    provide further reinforcements for him; but he claims that\r\n    Lyon's defeat can not be charged to his administration, and\r\n    quotes from a letter from General Lyon, dated on the 9th of\r\n    August, expressing the belief that he would be compelled to\r\n    retire; also, from a letter written by Lyon's adjutant general,\r\n    in which he says 'General Fremont was not inattentive to the\r\n    situation of General Lyon's column.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA daily cotemporary, in an onslaught on Emancipation, contains the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n    Delaware has recently had a proposition before the legislature\r\n    to abolish the scarcely more than nominal slavery still existing\r\n    in it; but the legislature adjourned without even listening to\r\n    it, though it contemplated full pecuniary compensation.\r\n\r\nYes; and the legislature of Delaware, a few years ago, legalized\r\nlotteries,--one of the greatest social curses of the country,--and made\r\nitself a hissing and a by-word to all decent men by sanctioning the most\r\nwidely-destructive method of gambling known. The Delaware legislature\r\nindeed!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to a friend for the following paragraph:--\r\n\r\nIt is deeply significant that since the late Federal victories, the\r\nSouthern press, even in Richmond itself, speaks nervously and angrily of\r\nthe Union men among them, and of their increasing boldness in openly\r\nmanifesting their sentiments. A few months since, this belief in Union\r\nmen in the South was abundantly ridiculed by those who believed that all\r\nthe slave-holding States were unanimous in rebellion, and that therefore\r\nit would be preposterous to hope to reconcile them to emancipation. Now\r\nthat the Union strength in that region is beginning to manifest itself,\r\nwe are informed that we shall lose it if we do aught contrary to\r\nSouthern rights. And this too, although the Southern Union men have\r\nnever been spoken of by their rebel neighbors as aught save 'the\r\nabolitionists in our midst!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following communication from a well-known financier and writer on\r\ncurrency can not fail to be read with interest by all:--\r\n\r\nTHE SINEWS OF WAR.\r\n\r\nThese are, men and money, but especially MONEY, for on the money depends\r\nthe men. In a good cause, with an educated, intelligent people, every\r\nman able to discern for himself the right side of the question\r\npresented, there is no difficulty about men; the state has only to say\r\nhow many are needed, and the want will be promptly supplied. The\r\nexperience of the last six months gives us evidence sufficient on this\r\npoint: an army of six hundred thousand men drawn together without an\r\neffort, every man a volunteer,--a spectacle never before exhibited to\r\nthe world,--puts at rest all doubt upon it; and not only that, it\r\nsettles beyond all cavil the superiority of self-government, based on\r\nthe broadest principles of freedom and the broadest system of education,\r\nover any other form which has ever been adopted. Passing from this,\r\nhowever, as a fact which needs no argument or illustration, we come to\r\nthe more difficult question of how to raise the other sinew--money.\r\n\r\nIn calling for men the state relies upon the intelligence and patriotism\r\nof its citizens; upon their intelligence to understand the cause, on\r\ntheir patriotism to respond to its call. It offers them no inducements\r\nin the shape of pay, nothing more than to feed and clothe them, to aid\r\nthem hereafter if wounded, to keep their families from starvation if\r\nthey are killed. This is all; and this is enough. But these assumed\r\nobligations of the state must be sacredly and promptly kept. Our noble\r\nvolunteers must be fed, and clothed, and cared for, and to this end the\r\nstate must have the requisite means. And to obtain the needed supply\r\nwithout oppressive taxation on the one hand, or placing a load on\r\nposterity too heavy to be borne on the other hand, is a question of\r\ndifficult solution; and yet we shall see that there is in the present\r\nadministration the ability and the will to solve it.\r\n\r\nIt is said that our expenditures in this great struggle will, by the\r\nfirst of June, amount to the enormous sum of $600,000,000. It is said by\r\nthe arch traitor at the head of the rebels that under this load of debt\r\nwe shall sink. It is said by the leading papers of England that we have\r\nno money, have exhausted our credit, must disband our armies, and make\r\nthe best terms we can with rebellion. Doubtless, our credit in Europe is\r\nat a low ebb just now, and we are thrown upon our own resources, and on\r\nthese we must swim or sink. There is nothing to reject in this. We have\r\nshown the world how a free state can raise troops and create a navy out\r\nof its own materials; and now we will show the world how a free state\r\ncan maintain its army and navy out of its own resources; and if the\r\nresult proves--as it will prove--that our free institutions are the\r\nsafest, strongest, and best for the people in war as well as in peace,\r\nthen the great struggle we are now going through with will be worth more\r\nto the true interests of humanity everywhere than all the battles which\r\nhave been fought since the dawn of the present century. For a hundred\r\nyears, openly or covertly, but without intermission, has war been going\r\non between despotism and freedom, with varied success, but on the whole\r\nwith a steady gain for freedom; and now here, on the same field where\r\nit originated, is the long strife to be finally settled. On these same\r\nfields the same freedom is to culminate in unquenchable splendor, or to\r\nset forever, leaving mankind to grope in darkness and ignorance under\r\nthe misrule of despotic tyranny. We are in arms not only to suppress an\r\nodious uprising of despotism against freedom within our own borders, but\r\nto show by our example, to all the nations of the earth, what freedom is\r\nand what freedom means.\r\n\r\nIn seeking aid of the money power, we go beyond the line where\r\npatriotism gives us all we need, promptly and liberally, into the cold\r\nregion of selfishness, whose people are too much absorbed in adding to\r\nand counting up their gains to be able to spare much time or thought on\r\ncountry or freedom. No voluntary sacrifices to be expected here. What we\r\nwant we must buy, and pay for; it is only to see that we do not pay too\r\nmuch for it. Selfish, timid, grasping, these people are a skittish set\r\nto deal with. Nobody understands better the game of 'the spider and the\r\nfly,' and they are as ready to play it with the state as with smaller\r\nopponents, if the state will but let them. From his first visit to this\r\nregion, to the present time, our able Secretary of the Treasury was, and\r\ncontinues to be, '_master of the position_.'\r\n\r\nWhen the Secretary held his first sociable with the representatives of\r\nthe money power, neither he nor they had a very keen perception of what\r\nthey wanted of each other; the rebellion was not then developed in the\r\ngigantic proportions it has since assumed; and it was hoped and\r\nexpected, with some show of reason, that two or three hundred millions\r\nwould be enough to put it down. This amount the power could and would\r\nwillingly furnish for a 'consideration,' the half presently, on\r\ncondition that it should be allowed the refusal of the other half when\r\nit should be wanted; and so a bargain was quickly struck, to the mutual\r\ncontent of both parties. But, as the thunder grew louder and the storm\r\nfiercer, it became evident that our wants would soon be doubled, at\r\nleast. The money power hung back; the 7-3/10 remained in the banks. The\r\nrepresentatives said they were only agents, the agents stopped payment,\r\nand the whole circulation of gold fell to the ground at once, not only\r\nputting a sudden check upon all business operations, but leaving the\r\nTreasury without any sort of currency to pay out: a sad state of things\r\nenough. The money power drew in its head, pretending not to see\r\nanything, waiting for propositions, expecting to reap a rich harvest out\r\nof the state's necessities, by making its own terms. How could it be\r\notherwise? must not the state have several hundred millions? must not\r\nthe astute Secretary sell the state's promises to pay, _secured by a\r\nfirst mortgage on all Uncle Sam's vast possessions_, on their own terms?\r\n\r\nIt was not a pleasant predicament for a nervous or a faint-hearted man\r\nto be placed in. But then Mr. Chase is neither nervous nor\r\nfaint-hearted, and when Congress came together he not only told his\r\nwants frankly, but proposed a neat little plan for supplying them\r\nwithout selling notes at fifty per cent. discount. Taking into view the\r\nwant of a sound currency for business purposes, and the want of some\r\ncurrency to pay out from the Treasury instead of the gold which had\r\ndisappeared and left a vacuum, he proposed to borrow $150,000,000, by\r\nissuing Treasury Notes, payable on demand, without interest, and making\r\nthem a _legal tender for the payment of all debts_, with a proviso that\r\nany parties who should at any time have more on hand than they wanted\r\nshould be allowed to invest them in bonds bearing six per cent interest.\r\nIt was a very simple proposition--almost sublime for its simplicity;\r\nthere was no mystery about it; and yet it was the very turning point of\r\nthe ways and means of crushing the rebellion, without being ourselves\r\ncrushed under an unbearable burden of debt. The money power stood\r\naghast, and hardly recovered breath in time to oppose its passage\r\nthrough Congress; but the common sense of the people hailed Mr. Chase as\r\na deliverer, and Congress endorsed common sense. Seriously, this\r\nsplendid invention of the Secretary has given a new face to our\r\nfinancial affairs by placing the money power where it always should\r\nbe,--in subservience to the people,--instead of allowing it to become a\r\ngrinding task-master. The importance of this measure can hardly be\r\nappreciated yet. A member of Congress, himself a merchant, and an able\r\nfinancier, says:\r\n\r\n'My theory in regard to it is, that as the currency is increased by the\r\naddition of these notes to its volume, prices generally will rise,\r\nincluding the price of U.S. bonds, until they reach par; at that point,\r\nthese notes, being convertible into bonds, the rise in the price of\r\nbonds will stop, because further additions to the currency, whether of\r\nthese notes, bank notes, or coin, will only stimulate the conversion of\r\nnotes into bonds; and that conversion will check the increase of\r\ncurrency. The _excess_ of notes will then be gradually withdrawn from\r\ncirculation for conversion,--leaving only such an amount in circulation\r\nas a healthy and natural condition of the currency will require.'\r\n\r\nA theory in which we fully concur. We see growing out of it a\r\nrestoration of business: government creditors paid in a currency equal\r\nto gold; low prices for all government contracts; a consequent\r\ndiminished expenditure for supplies, and an annual payment for interest\r\non the debt we shall owe, which can be easily met without heavy\r\ntaxation. However it may turn out in the conduct of the war,--and we\r\nhave full faith in that also,--it is very certain that in the conduct of\r\nthe finances we have found the man for the times. The whole country\r\nfeels this, and breathes easier for it. The arch rebel, in a recent\r\naddress to his satellites, admits that he altogether underestimated the\r\npatriotism and loyalty of the men of the North, but takes fresh courage\r\nfrom the certainty that we shall shortly back down under our load of\r\ndebt. A little further on and he will find that he has just as much\r\nmistaken our power in that respect,--that as his own worthless promises,\r\nbased upon nothing, fall to nothing, the notes of the Union will stand\r\nas firm and as fair in the money market as her banner will on the\r\nbattle-field.\r\n\r\nMen and money are the sinews of war. In our first trial, patriotism has\r\nfurnished the men, and the presiding genius of the Treasury has clearly\r\npointed out the means for obtaining the money. _Laus Deo_!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNote.--For the benefit of those of our readers who do not understand\r\ncurrency facts and theories, we make the following explanation. The\r\nrelation of currency, or circulation medium, to the industry and\r\nbusiness of the state, is similar to that of steam in an engine: a\r\ncertain amount is required to keep up a regular and natural movement; an\r\nexcessive amount causes too rapid motion, and a deficiency the reverse.\r\nCurrency is made up of several things. Bank deposits, circulating by\r\nchecks, bank notes, and coin, are the most important and best\r\nunderstood. The aggregate amount of these three items before the\r\nsuspension of specie payments was above $450,000,000; and this sum is\r\nrequired to give a healthy movement to business affairs. Take away any\r\nportion of it, and prices fall and labor languishes, because the motion\r\nfrom it is too small for the work required; add considerably to it, and\r\nprices rise, because the motive power, being superabundant, is too\r\nfreely used. When specie payment was suspended this motive power was\r\nreduced; the circulating medium fell from four hundred and fifty to\r\nthree hundred and fifty millions, perhaps less; and unless this loss is\r\nreplaced it is quite clear that prices must fall and the employment of\r\nlabor be curtailed. The issue of treasury notes will fill the gap,\r\nmaking the business motive power of the same strength and ability as\r\nbefore. Thus it will be seen that the emission of treasury notes plays\r\nan important part upon the industry and business of the state, which,\r\nunder existing circumstances, can hardly be over-valued, as well as in\r\nthe national finances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Darwin-development theory has of late attracted no little attention.\r\nOne of our contributors favors us with _his_ views in the following\r\n'wild-verse,' which is itself rather of the transition order:--\r\n\r\nMODERN ANSWERS TO ANCIENT RIDDLES.\r\n\r\n'Whar did ye come from? Who d'ye belong to!'--_Ethiops_.\r\n\r\n    Philosophers say, deny it who may,\r\n    That the man who stands upright so bravely to-day,\r\n    Once crawled as a reptile with nose to the sod,\r\n    His grandfather Monad a bit of a clod.\r\n\r\n  To be sure, man's descent is not made out quite plain,\r\n  But one or two _guesses_ might piece out the chain;\r\n  If the chain is quite long a few links won't be missed;\r\n  Or, if you must join it, _just give it a twist_.\r\n\r\n    A bold Boston doctor, by stride superhuman,\r\n    Makes only a step from a snake to a woman;\r\n    Or, inspect your best friends by Granville's good glass,\r\n    And the difference's as small 'twixt a man and an ass.\r\n\r\n  'From the company he keeps we may learn a man's nature;'\r\n  If he will play with monkey, dog, cat, or such creature,\r\n  The schoolmen will say, as a matter of course,\r\n  'Cum hoc ergo propter hoc.' Notice its force!\r\n\r\n    If with doubts you're still puzzled, and wonder who can\r\n    Answer all your objections, why Darwin's your man.\r\n    He can bridge o'er a chasm both broad and profound;\r\n    The last thing he needs for a theory is _ground_.\r\n\r\n  Bring your queries and facts, no matter how tough;\r\n  Development doctrine makes light of such stuff.\r\n  One example of these will perhaps be enough:--\r\n  'These crawlers,' for instance, 'should they be still here,'\r\n  'Not yet become bipeds?' The answer is clear:\r\n\r\n    In our strangely unequal organic advance,\r\n    He is the most forward who has the best chance.\r\n    By braving the weather and struggling with brother,\r\n    The one who survives it all gains upon t'other.\r\n\r\n  The old Bible 'myth,' now, of Jacob and Esau,\r\n  Is the struggle 'twixt species, the monkey and man law;\r\n  One hairy, one handsome, one favored, one cursed;\r\n  And sometimes the last one turns out to be first.\r\n\r\n    Still, through cycles enough let the laggard persist,\r\n    Let the weak be suppressed since he can not resist,\r\n    And, proceeding by logic which none may dispute,\r\n    Can't we safely infer there's an end to the brute?\r\n\r\n  You may, if you please, supersede Revelation,\r\n  By wholly new methods of ratiocination;\r\n  Though, since head and heart _need be_ in contradiction,\r\n  Why should reason hold faith under any restriction?\r\n  Shut your eyes, and guess down heaven's good pious fiction.[P]\r\n\r\n    Noah's ark was superfluous. Where were his brains,\r\n    For those beasts and those sons to provide with such pains,\r\n    When they might to a deluge cry Fiddle di dee,\r\n    And sprout fins and scales, if they took to the sea?\r\n\r\n  Well, perhaps in those days they had not yet known\r\n  That _by need of new functions new organs are grown_.\r\n  Those drowned chaps were sure a 'degenerate' crew,\r\n  Or else, on their plunge into element new,\r\n  Some 'law of selection' had rescued a few.\r\n  And, 'if wishes were fishes' I think one or two\r\n  Would have _wished_, and swam out of their scrape, do not you?\r\n  Can it be that those 'Fish Tales' of mermen are true?\r\n\r\n    No wonder that racing was always in fashion,--\r\n    All orders of beings were born with the passion--\r\n    But it seems that at length Genus Man will be winner.\r\n    You cry 'Lucky dog!'

What youth\r\nambitious of becoming 'a perfect _Hercules_ behind the bar?'--as a well\r\nmeaning but unfortunate Philadelphian once said in a funeral eulogy over\r\na deceased legal friend--has not 'debated' in a club 'formed for\r\npurposes of mutual _and_ literary improvement of the mind?' All who have\r\nwill read with pleasure the following letter from one who has most\r\ncertainly been there:--\r\n\r\n    DEAR CONTINENTAL:\r\n\r\n    I am a man that rides around over the 'kedn'try.' In the little\r\n    village where I am now tarrying, the school-house bell is\r\n    ringing to call together the members of that ancient institution\r\n    peculiar to villages, the debating society. A friend informs me\r\n    that the time-honored questions--Should capital punishment be\r\n    abolished?--Did Columbus deserve more praise than\r\n    Washington?--Is art more pleasing to the eye than nature?--have\r\n    each had their turn in their regular rotation, and that the\r\n    question for to-night is--as you might suppose--Has the Indian\r\n    suffered greater wrongs at the hands of the White man than the\r\n    Negro? As I have a distinct recollection of having thoroughly\r\n    investigated and zealously declaimed on each of the above topics\r\n    in days lang syne, I shall excuse myself from attendance this\r\n    evening, on the ground that I am already extensively informed on\r\n    the subject in hand, and my mind is fully made up. But I hereby\r\n    acknowledge my indebtedness to the good fellow who told me the\r\n    object of the ringing of the bell--for he has unconsciously\r\n    started up some of the most amusing recollections of my life.\r\n    Sitting here alone in my room, I have just taken a hearty laugh\r\n    over a circumstance that had well-nigh given me the slip. The\r\n    question was the same Negro-Indian-White-man affair. One of the\r\n    orators, having, a long time previously, seen a picture in an\r\n    old 'jography' of some Indians making a hubbub on board certain\r\n    vessels, and reading under it, _Destruction of Tea in Boston\r\n    Harbor_, brought up the circumstance, and insisting with great\r\n    earnestness that the white man had received burning wrongs at\r\n    the hands of the Indian, and that the latter had _no reason at\r\n    all to complain_, dwelt with great emphasis on the ruthless\r\n    destruction of the white man's tea in Boston Harbor by the\r\n    latter, in proof of his 'point.'\r\n\r\n    I remember also a debating society in the little village of\r\n    R----, which numbered some really very worthy and intelligent\r\n    members, but of course included some that were otherwise, among\r\n    whom was a silly young fellow, who had mistaken his proper\r\n    calling--(he should have been a wood-chopper), and was suffering\r\n    under an attack _at_ medicine. The question for debate on one\r\n    occasion was--Is conscience an infallible guide? Being expected\r\n    to take part in the discussion, he was bent on thorough\r\n    preparation, and ransacked his preceptor's professional\r\n    library--(almost as poor a place as a lawyer's) for a work on\r\n    _conscience_. He found abundance of matter, however, for a\r\n    lengthy chapter on the subject, as he supposed, occurring in\r\n    several of the dusty octavos, and he thumbed the leaves with\r\n    most patient assiduity. He had misspelled the word however, and\r\n    was reading all the while on _consciousness_--a subject which\r\n    would very naturally occur in some departments of medicine. But\r\n    it was all one to him, he didn't see the difference, and the\r\n    ridiculous display he made to us of his 'cramming' on\r\n    consciousness can be better imagined than described.\r\n\r\n    Years after found me inside college walls--but colleges in the\r\n    West, be it remembered, sometimes include preparatory\r\n    departments, into which, by the courtesy of the teachers, many\r\n    young men are admitted who would hardly make a respectable\r\n    figure in the poorest country school, but who by dint of honest\r\n    toil finally do themselves great credit.\r\n\r\n    I 'happened in' on a number of such, one evening, whose\r\n    affinities had drawn them together with a view to forming a\r\n    debating society, to be made exclusively of their own kind. I\r\n    listened with much interest and pleasure to the preliminaries of\r\n    organization, and smiled, when they were about to 'choose a\r\n    question,' to see them bring out the same old coaches mentioned\r\n    in the beginning of this article; when one of their number\r\n    arose, evidently dissatisfied with the old beaten track, and\r\n    seemed bent on opening a new vein. He was a good, honest,\r\n    patient fellow, but his weakness in expressing himself was,\r\n    that, although his delivery was very slow, he didn't know how he\r\n    was going to end his sentences when he began them. 'Mr.\r\n    President,' said he, 'how would this do? Suppose a punkin seed\r\n    sprouts in one man's garden, and the vine grows through the\r\n    fence, and bears a punkin on another man's ground--now--(a long\r\n    pause)--the question is--whose punkin--_does it belong to?_' The\r\n    poor fellow subsided, as might be supposed, amid a roar of\r\n    voices and a crash of boots.\r\n\r\nThere is a legal axiom which would settle the pumpkin-vine query--that\r\nof _cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum_--'ownership in the soil\r\nconfers possession of everything even as high as heaven.' Our friends in\r\nDixie seem determined to prove that they have also fee simple in their\r\nsoil downwards as far as the other place, and by the last advices were\r\ndigging their own graves to an extent which will soon bring them to the\r\nutmost limit of their property!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDoes the reader remember Poor Pillicoddy, and the mariner who was ever\r\nexpected to turn up again? Not less eccentric, as it seems to us, is the\r\nre-apparition chronicled in the following story by a friend:--\r\n\r\n    TURNING UP AGAIN!\r\n\r\n    'You were all through that Mexican war, and out with Walker in\r\n    Niggerawger.--Well, what do you think 'bout Niggerawger? Kind of\r\n    a cuss'd 'skeeter hole, ain't it?'\r\n\r\n    'Tain't so much 'skeeters as 'tis snaiks, scorpiums and the\r\n    like,' answered the gray-moustached corporal. 'It's hot in them\r\n    countries as a Dutch oven on a big bake; and going through them\r\n    parts, man's got to move purty d----d lively to git ahead of the\r\n    yaller fever; it's right onto his tracks the hull time.'\r\n\r\n    'Did you git that gash over your nose out there?'\r\n\r\n    'Yes, I got that in a small scrimmage under old GRAY EYES. 'Twas\r\n    next day _after a fight_ though, cum to think on it. We'd been\r\n    up there and took a small odobe hole called Santa Sumthin', and\r\n    had spasificated the poperlashun, when I went to git a gold\r\n    cross off an old woman, and she up frying-pan of _frijoles_ and\r\n    hit me, so!' Here the corporal aimed a blow with his pipe at the\r\n    face of the high private he was talking with;--the latter dodged\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    'That was a big thing, that fight at Santa Sumthin'; the way we\r\n    went over them mud walls, and wiped out the Greasers, was a\r\n    cortion. I rac'lect when we was drawed up company front, afore\r\n    we made the charge, there was a feller next me in the ranks--I\r\n    didn't know him from an old shoe, 'cause he'd ben drafted that\r\n    morning into us from another company. Says he,--\r\n\r\n    'We're going into hair and cats' claws 'fore long, and as I'm\r\n    unbeknownst amongst you fellers, I'd like to make a bargain with\r\n    you.'\r\n\r\n    'Go it,' says I; 'I'm on hand for ennything.'\r\n\r\n    'Well,' says he, 'witchever one of us gits knocked over, the\r\n    tother feller 'll look out for him, and if he ain't a goner 'll\r\n    haul him out, so the doctor can work onto him.'\r\n\r\n    'Good,' says I, 'you may count me in there; mind you look after\r\n    ME!'\r\n\r\n    The fight began, and when we charged, the fust thing I knowed\r\n    the feller next me, wot made the bargain, he went head over\r\n    heels backwards; and to tell the honest trooth, I was just that\r\n    powerful egsited I never minded him a smite, but went right\r\n    ahead after plunder and the Greasers, over mud walls and along\r\n    alleys, till I got, bang in, where I found something worth\r\n    fighting about it. 'Bout dusk, when we was all purty full of\r\n    _agwadenty_, they sent us out to bury our fellers as was killed\r\n    in the scrimmage; and as we hadn't much time to spare, we didn't\r\n    dig a hole more'n a foot or two deep, and put all our fellers\r\n    in, in a hurry. Next morning airly, as I was just coming out of\r\n    a church where I'd ben surveyin' some candle-stix with a\r\n    jack-knife to see ef they were silver, [witch they were\r\n    not,--hang em!]--as I was coming out of the church I felt a\r\n    feller punch me in the back--so I turned round to hit him back,\r\n    when I see the feller, as had stood by me in the ranks the day\r\n    before, all covered over with dirt, and mad as a ringtail\r\n    hornet.\r\n\r\n    'Hello!' said I.\r\n\r\n    'Hello! yourself,' said he. 'I want ter know what yer went and\r\n    berried me for, afore I was killed for?'\r\n\r\n    I never was so put to for a answer afore in all my life, 'cause\r\n    I wanted to spasificate the feller, so I kind of hemmed, and\r\n    says I--'Hm! the fact was, this dirty little hole of a town was\r\n    _rayther_ crowded last night, and I--just to please you, yer\r\n    know--I lodged you out there; but I swear I was this minute\r\n    going out there to dig you up for breakfuss!'\r\n\r\n    'If that's so,' said he, 'we won't say no more 'bout it; but the\r\n    next time you do it, don't put a feller in so deep; for I had a\r\n    oncommon hard scratch turning up again!'\r\n\r\n    H.P.L.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the same writer for the following Oriental\r\nmarket-picture--we might say scene in a proverb:\r\n\r\n    PROVERBIALLY WISE.\r\n\r\n    ACHMET sat in the bazaar, calmly smoking: he had said to himself\r\n    in the early morning,--'When I shall have made a hundred\r\n    piastres I will shut up shop for the day, and go home and take\r\n    it easy, _al'hamdu lillah_!' Now a hundred piastres in the land\r\n    of the faithful, where the sand is and the palms grow, is equal\r\n    to a dollar in the land of Jonathan: and the expression he\r\n    concluded his sentence with is equivalent to--Praise be to\r\n    Allah!\r\n\r\n    Along came a blind fakir begging; then ACHMET gave him five\r\n    paras, although his charity was unseen; neither did he want it\r\n    to be seen, for he said to himself,--\r\n\r\n    'Do good and throw it into the sea--if the fishes don't know it,\r\n    God will.'\r\n\r\n    And as he handed the poor blind fakir the small coin, he said to\r\n    him, in a soothing voice,--\r\n\r\n    '_Fa'keer_' (which in the Arabic means poor fellow), 'the nest\r\n    of a blind bird is made by Allah.'\r\n\r\n    Then along came SULIMAN BEY, who was high in office in the land\r\n    of Egypt, and was wealthy, and powerful, and very much hated and\r\n    feared. And ACHMET bowed down before him, and performed\r\n    obeisance in the manner of the Turks, touching his own hand to\r\n    his lips, his breast, his head:--and the SULIMAN BEY went\r\n    proudly on. Then ACHMET smiled, and YUSEF, who had a stall in\r\n    the bazaar opposite to him, winked to ACHMET, saying, in a low\r\n    voice,--\r\n\r\n      'Kiss ardently the hands which you can not cut off:'--\r\n\r\n    and they smiled grimly one unto the other.\r\n\r\n    'Did you hear the music in the Esbekieh garden yesterday?' asked\r\n    YUSEF of ACHMET. 'I think it was horrible.'\r\n\r\n    'It cost nothing to hear it,' quoth ACHMET: 'there was no charge\r\n    made.'\r\n\r\n    '_Aio_! true,' answered YUSEF; 'but there were too many drums; I\r\n    wouldn't have one if I were Pacha.'\r\n\r\n    'Welcome even pitch, if it is gratis.'\r\n\r\n    'Wanting to make the eyebrows right, pull out the eyes,' said\r\n    ACHMET, contentedly. 'And as for your disliking the music,--A\r\n    cucumber being given to a poor man, he did not accept it because\r\n    it was crooked!'--'Come, let us shut up shop and go to the\r\n    mosque.

Here it is five minutes\r\n    past ten and BUDDEN ain't here. Did anybody ever know that man\r\n    to keep an engagement?'\r\n\r\n    'Yes,' replied the Doctor to the Squire, 'I knew him to keep\r\n    one.'\r\n\r\n    'Let it out,' said the Squire.\r\n\r\n    'An engagement to get married.'\r\n\r\n    'Hm!' replied the Squire, looking over his spectacles with the\r\n    air of one who had been deceived. At this moment JERRY BUDDEN, a\r\n    jolly-looking, fat, middle-aged man entered the office quietly\r\n    and coolly, having all the air of one who arrived half an hour\r\n    before the appointed time of meeting.\r\n\r\n    'Got ahead of time this morning, any way,' said Jerry.\r\n\r\n    'The devil you did!' spoke the Squire, testily; 'you are seven\r\n    minutes behind time this morning; you would be behindhand\r\n    to-morrow and next day, and so on as long as you live. Confound\r\n    it, Jerry, you make me mad with your laziness and coolness.\r\n    Ahead of time! why look at that watch!'--Here the Squire,\r\n    pulling out a plethoric-looking, smooth gold watch, about the\r\n    size of a bran biscuit, held it affectionately in the palm of\r\n    his right hand. 'Look at _that_ watch!'\r\n\r\n    'Nice watch,' said Jerry, 'very nice watch. The best of watches\r\n    will sometimes get out of order though. How long since you had\r\n    it cleaned?'\r\n\r\n    The Squire looked indignant, and broke out, 'I've carried that\r\n    watch more'n thirty year; I have it cleaned regularly, and it is\r\n    always right to a minute, always! It's _you_ that want\r\n    regulating.'\r\n\r\n    'Can't help it,' spoke Jerry; 'I got ahead of time this\r\n    morning.'\r\n\r\n    'Bet you a hat on it,' said the Squire.\r\n\r\n    'Done!' answered Jerry. And, putting his hand in his pocket, he\r\n    deliberately produced the torn page of an old almanac, and,\r\n    pointing to part of an engraving of the man with an hour-glass,\r\n    said to the Squire,--\r\n\r\n    'Hain't I got a Head of Time--this morning?'\r\n\r\n    Jerry now wears a new hat!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'What poor slaves are the American people!' says the Times' own RUSSELL.\r\n'They may abjure kings and princes, but they are ruled by hotel-keepers\r\nand waiters.'

BY HENRY P. LELAND.\r\n\r\n  IBRAM BEN ADHAM at his palace gate,\r\n  Sits, while in line his pages round him wait;\r\n  When a poor dervish, staff and sack in hand,\r\n  Straight would have entered IBRAM'S palace grand.\r\n  'Old man,' the pages asked, 'where goest thou now?'\r\n  'In that hotel,' he answered, with a bow.\r\n  The pages said,--'Ha! dare you call hotel\r\n  A palace, where the King of Balkh doth dwell?'\r\n  IBRAM the King next to the dervish spoke:\r\n  'My palace a hotel? Pray, where's the joke?'\r\n  'Who,' asked the dervish, 'owned this palace first?'\r\n  'My grandsire,' IBRAM said, while wrath he nursed.\r\n  'Who was the next proprietor?' please say.\r\n  'My father:' thus the king replied straightway.\r\n  'Who hired it then upon your father's death?'\r\n  'I did,' King IBRAM answered, out of breath.\r\n  'When you shall die, who shall within it dwell?'\r\n  'My son,' the King replied. 'Why ask'st thou? Tell!'\r\n  'IBRAM!' then spoke the dervish to him straight,\r\n  'I'll answer thee, nor longer make thee wait.\r\n  The place where travelers come, and go as well,\r\n  Is, really, not a palace, but--hotel!'\r\n\r\nYea, friends; and, as another genial poet has discovered, life itself is\r\nbut a hostelrie or tavern, where some get the highest rooms, while\r\nothers, of greater social weight, gravitate downwards into the first\r\nstory, sinking like gold to the bottom of the hotel pan,--that is O.W.\r\nHOLMES', his idea, reader, not ours. _Apropos_ of HOLMES and kings--his\r\nthousands of reader friends have ere this seen with pleasure that the\r\nEmperor of all the French was not unmindful of one of his\r\nbrother-potentates,--in the world of song,--when he paid OLIVER WENDELL\r\nthe courteous compliment which has of late gone the rounds, and which\r\nconferred as much honor on the giver as the taker thereof.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Spring poems have begun. _Vide licet_.\r\n\r\n  TO AN EARLY BIRD.\r\n\r\n  In homely phrase we oft are told\r\n    'Tis early birds that catch the worms;\r\n  But certainly that Spring bird there\r\n     Don't half believe the aforesaid terms.\r\n\r\n  He's sorry that he hither flew,\r\n     In hopes a forward March to find,\r\n  And towards warm climates, whence he came,\r\n     To backward march is sore inclined.\r\n\r\n  Lured by one ray of sunlight, he\r\n     Flew northward to our land of snow;\r\n  And now, with frozen toes, he stands\r\n     On frozen earth:--the worms--below!\r\n\r\n  Tu whit! whit! whit! he tries in vain\r\n     To whistle in a cheerful way;\r\n  He feels he's badly sold, and that--\r\n     He came _too early_ in the day.\r\n\r\n  I sprinkle seed and crumbs around;\r\n    He quickly flies and famished eats:--\r\n  He would have starved to death had he\r\n    Relied on proverb-making cheats.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the same up-Springings, in higher vein, we have the following:--\r\n\r\n  APRIL.\r\n\r\n  BY ED.

When the present war first sent\r\nits murmurs over the South, an old bushman earnestly denied that it\r\n'would ruin everything.' 'Kin it stop the turpentime from running?' he\r\ntriumphantly cried.

The deacon was 'well to do in the world,' having a\r\n    fine farm, a pleasant house, and, with his quiet way of living,\r\n    apparently everything to make him comfortable.\r\n\r\n    He took great delight in raising bees, and the product of his\r\n    hives was every year some hundreds of pounds of honey, for which\r\n    there was always a ready market, though he frequently gave away\r\n    large quantities among his neighbors.\r\n\r\n    One Sunday morning, when passing the place of Deacon Hubbard on\r\n    my way to meeting, I saw the deacon in his orchard near his\r\n    house, apparently in great trouble about something in one of\r\n    his apple trees. I crossed the road to the fence and called to\r\n    him, and asked him what was the matter. He was a very\r\n    conscientious man, and would not do anything on the Lord's day\r\n    that could be done on any other; but he cried, 'Oh, dear! my\r\n    bees are swarming, and I shall surely lose them. If I was a\r\n    young man I could climb the tree and save them, but I am too old\r\n    for that.' I jumped over the fence, and as I approached him he\r\n    pointed to a large dark mass of something suspended from the\r\n    limb of an apple tree, which to me was a singular-looking\r\n    object, never having before seen bees in swarming time. I had\r\n    great curiosity to see the operation of hiving, and suggested\r\n    that perhaps I could help him, though at the time afraid the\r\n    bees would sting me for my trouble. The gratification to be\r\n    derived I thought would repay the risk, and calling to mind some\r\n    lines I had  heard,--\r\n\r\n  'Softly, gently touch a nettle,\r\n    It will sting thee for thy pains;\r\n  Grasp it like a man of mettle,\r\n    Soft and harmless it remains,--'\r\n\r\n    I told him that I would assist him. He assured me that if I\r\n    could only get a rope around the limb above and fasten it to the\r\n    one on which the bees were, then saw off that limb and lower it\r\n    down, he could secure them without much trouble.\r\n\r\n    With saw and rope in hand I ascended the tree, and, after due\r\n    preparation, severed the limb and carefully lowered it within\r\n    the deacon's reach. I was surprised, and felt repaid for my\r\n    trouble, to see with what ease and unconcern Dea. Hubbard, with\r\n    his bare hands, scooped and brushed the swarm of bees into a\r\n    sheet he had prepared, and how readily he got them into a vacant\r\n    hive. Many thanks did the deacon proffer me for my timely\r\n    assistance, and moreover insisted on my staying with him to\r\n    dine. It seemed to me that I was never in a more comfortable\r\n    house, and I am sure I never received a more cordial greeting\r\n    than that bestowed upon me by his venerable spouse.\r\n\r\n    The place where I boarded with several other boys was with a\r\n    widow lady by the name of White, who was very kind to me, but\r\n    who had the misfortune to have had three husbands, and her\r\n    daughters did not all revere the memory of the same father, and\r\n    consequently there were oftentimes differences among them.\r\n\r\n    For several days after this transaction I had noticed on the\r\n    table at our daily meal a nice dish of honey, an unusual treat,\r\n    but to which we boys paid due respect.\r\n\r\n    My term at school expired, and I went home to my father's, a\r\n    distance of some thirty miles, and assisted him on the farm\r\n    during the fall months, employing much of my leisure time in\r\n    studying.\r\n\r\n    My father was a stern, straight-forward man--a member of the\r\n    Orthodox church, and one who professed to believe in all the\r\n    proprieties of life, and endeavored to impress the same on the\r\n    minds of his children.\r\n\r\n    One day, after dinner, he said to me, in his stern way of\r\n    speaking,--'Gilbert, what kind of scrape did you get into in\r\n    G----?'\r\n\r\n    For my life I could not tell what I had been doing, and had but\r\n    little chance to think, ere he tossed a letter across the table\r\n    and said, 'Read that, and tell me what it means!' The letter was\r\n    directed to me, but he had exercised his right to open and read\r\n    it for me. It was from G----, and signed by the four deacons of\r\n    the church there, asking explicit answers to the following\r\n    questions:--1st. Did you help Deacon Hubbard hive his bees? 2d.\r\n    If so, did you receive any remuneration from him for your\r\n    services? 3d. Will you state what it was? You are expected to\r\n    answer the questions fully.'\r\n\r\n    'What have you to say to that, young man?' said my father, with\r\n    more than usual sternness; and I began to think that I had got\r\n    into some kind of difficulty.\r\n\r\n    I told him that I would answer the letter, so went to my room\r\n    and wrote, saying that I _did_ help Deacon Hubbard hive his\r\n    bees, and that I _had_ been paid a thousand times by the many\r\n    acts of kindness of himself and wife, and should always feel\r\n    happy in doing anything for them that I could.\r\n\r\n    As my father read this letter I had written, I noticed a smile\r\n    on his countenance, which lasted but an instant, when he said,\r\n    'You may send it; but I want to know what this scrape is, and I\r\n    will.'\r\n\r\n    A few days after the reply was sent, another letter arrived from\r\n    the four deacons, stating that I had not been explicit enough in\r\n    my answer, and wanted me to say, 1st. Whether I had helped\r\n    Deacon Hubbard hive his bees on Sunday. 2d. Whether I had ever\r\n    received from him a large pan of honey in the comb? 3d. Whether\r\n    my father was a member of the church? 4th. Whether he would give\r\n    his consent for me to come to G---- on business of great\r\n    importance if they would pay my expenses, and how soon I could\r\n    come?\r\n\r\n    It was cold weather, several months after I left G----, when\r\n    this letter came to hand, and I did not fancy a ride of thirty\r\n    miles at that time; I however had permission to promise that I\r\n    would be there on the first Monday in May, which was the day of\r\n    'General Training,' and a great day at that period. In my answer\r\n    to the second letter I said that I thought I had answered their\r\n    first question sufficiently before; and in answer to the second\r\n    I would say, that I had never received any honey from Deacon\r\n    Hubbard; to the third, that my father was a member of the\r\n    church; and to the fourth, that I would come there on the day\r\n    named above.\r\n\r\n    The first Monday in May was a bright and lovely day, and at an\r\n    early hour I mounted a horse and started for G----, arriving\r\n    there before noon. On my way into the village I had to pass the\r\n    house of Deacon Hubbard, who, knowing that I was expected that\r\n    day, was looking for my approach, and as I drew near the house I\r\n    saw his venerable form in the road. It was my intention to pass\r\n    his house without being seen, but that was impossible. He\r\n    insisted on my going into the house. His good wife met me at the\r\n    door with a cordial greeting, but, with tearful eyes, said she\r\n    feared there was some dreadful trouble in store for me, for the\r\n    deacons of the church had been watching for me all the morning.\r\n    After explaining as well as I could the reason of my visit, with\r\n    the little information I had, Deacon Hubbard exclaimed--'Well, I\r\n    don't know but they'll make you walk the church aisle, for\r\n    there's some trouble somewhere.' We had but little time for\r\n    conversation before Mrs. H. saw the venerable deacons\r\n    approaching the house; and I shall never forget the solemn look\r\n    and steps with which they advanced, the senior deacon, Flagg,\r\n    leading the procession. As they were ushered into the front room\r\n    they seated themselves in a row according to their respective\r\n    ages, each wearing the solemn countenance of a Pilgrim father.\r\n    When I entered the room they all arose and took me by the hand,\r\n    thanking me for faithfully keeping my promise, and hoped the\r\n    Lord would reward me therefor. Deacon Flagg, after a few\r\n    preliminary remarks, said: 'Young man, there has been a grievous\r\n    sin committed among the Lord's anointed in our church, and we\r\n    have sent for you that we may be enabled to detect the erring\r\n    one! and we hope you will so far consider the importance of the\r\n    matter as to answer truly the questions that may be propounded\r\n    to you. My young friend, will you have the goodness to say, in\r\n    the hearing of our good brother, Deacon Hubbard, whether or not\r\n    you ever received from him a present of a large pan of honey for\r\n    helping him hive his bees?'\r\n\r\n    I answered that I never had. All eyes were turned on Deacon H.,\r\n    and an audible groan came from Deacon Harris as I made my reply.\r\n    Deacon Flagg addressed me as follows:--'My youthful friend, will\r\n    you be willing to accompany these gentlemen to the house of\r\n    sister White, and say the same before her?' I was willing,\r\n    provided my friend Deacon Hubbard would go along, which he\r\n    consented to do, and we started.\r\n\r\n    It was but a short way across the Common, and ours was a solemn,\r\n    silent procession, and I must have appeared like a very culprit.\r\n    On nearing the house, Deacon Flagg said he would first enter and\r\n    inform sister White of our business, and return when she was\r\n    ready to receive us. He returned in a short time, with a longer\r\n    face than before, and as he approached us, clasping his hands,\r\n    he said with an agonized tone, 'Dear brethren, Oh! it is all too\r\n    true! Satan entered her heart,--she coveted the honey,--and\r\n    fell.' A groan of holy horror came from all the good old men. It\r\n    was not necessary for us to enter the abode of wickedness, he\r\n    said, for she would confess all.\r\n\r\n    The whole proceeding had been a mystery to me, but I soon\r\n    learned that the next day after hiving the bees, Deacon Hubbard\r\n    had sent a large pan of honey to sister White's house, intended\r\n    for me, but she gave us boys a little for a few days and put the\r\n    rest away; or, as she afterwards said, she coveted it, and said\r\n    nothing to me about it; and I should probably have known nothing\r\n    of it had it not been for a disagreement between herself and\r\n    daughters about a division of the honey, which finally got to be\r\n    a church matter.\r\n\r\n    Deacon Hubbard insisted on my going to dine with him; so, with a\r\n    parting shake of the hand with the other four venerable men, we\r\n    started for his house. Such a feast as dame Hubbard had provided\r\n    on that occasion boys do not often see; substantial food enough\r\n    for half a score of men, aside from the pies and plum pudding\r\n    which made their appearance in due course; and in front of the\r\n    dish assigned to me was a dish of the purest honey. After dinner\r\n    Deacon Hubbard took me to see his bees, and explained many\r\n    things in relation to them curious and instructive, promising\r\n    more information on the subject if he could prevail upon me to\r\n    remain in G---- till the next morning. The fatigue of the long\r\n    ride that day, and my desire to see a little of the 'Training,'\r\n    decided me to remain over night.\r\n\r\n    In the morning my horse was fresh, having been well taken care\r\n    of by my friend; so, after a hearty breakfast, I bade adieu to\r\n    the good couple, with a pleasant recollection of their\r\n    hospitality and kindness. When ready to start, dame Hubbard,\r\n    with the best intentions, brought me a large pail of honey,\r\n    wishing I would carry it home to my parents, but as it was\r\n    impossible for me to carry it on horseback, I had to decline.\r\n\r\n    It was near noon the next day when I reached home, and my first\r\n    greeting from my father was, 'Well, Gilbert, now let me know\r\n    about the scrape you got into last summer in G----.'\r\n\r\n    I told him all I had learned about the matter, to which be\r\n    expressed his pleasure that it was no worse, and gave me much\r\n    good advice as to the future.\r\n\r\n    A few weeks after I readied home there was a large tub of honey\r\n    left at my father's house, with a letter for me, informing me\r\n    that sister White had been expelled from the church in G---- for\r\n    covetousness; that my friends the Hubbards were well; that the\r\n    four deacons spoke very highly in my praise, and hoped I would\r\n    _feel rewarded_ for the trouble I had taken. Years have passed\r\n    since the matters here mentioned took place, but up to this time\r\n    nothing has been said to me about 'paying my expenses.'\r\n\r\n    JAY G.

In its shape it was what?\r\n  The world says 'a man,'--but the world is mistaken.\r\n  To revive the old story, a long time forgot,\r\n  'Twasn't man that was made, but a pot that was baken.\r\n\r\n  And what if it was human-faced like the Sphinx?\r\n  There's no riddle to solve, whate'er the world thinks:\r\n  The fiat that made it, from its heels to its hair,\r\n  Wasn't simply 'Be man!' but 'Stand up and Be Ware!'\r\n\r\n  And straightway acknowledging its true kith and kin\r\n  With that host of things known to be hollow within,\r\n  It took up a stand with its handles akimbo,\r\n  Bowels and bosom in a cavernous limbo.\r\n\r\n  Curving out at the bottom, it swelled to a jig;\r\n  Curving in at the top, narrow-necked, to the mug;\r\n  Two sockets for sunshine in the frontispiece placed,\r\n  A crack just below--merely a matter of taste;\r\n  A flap on each side hiding holes of resounding,\r\n  For conveyance within of noises surrounding;\r\n  And a nozzle before,\r\n  All befitted to snore,\r\n  Was a part of the ware\r\n  For adornment and air.\r\n\r\n  Now for what was this slender and curious mold?\r\n  Had it no purpose? Had it nothing to hold?\r\n  A world full of meaning, my friend, if 'twere told.\r\n  You remember those jars in the Arabian Night,\r\n  As they stood 'neath the stars in Al' Baba's eyesight:\r\n  Little dreamed Ali Baba what ajar could excite--\r\n    For how much did betide\r\n    When a man was inside!\r\n  When from under each cover a man was to spring,\r\n  Where then was the empty, insignificant thing?\r\n    It was so with this jar,\r\n    'Twasn't hollow by far;\r\n  Breathless at first as an exhausted receiver,\r\n  When the air was let in, lo! man, the achiever!\r\n\r\n  But an accident happened, a cruel surprise;\r\n  How frail proved the man, and how very unwise!\r\n  As if plaster of Paris, and not Paradise,\r\n    No more of clay consecrate,\r\n    He broke up disconsolate,\r\n  Pot-luck for his fortune, though the world's potentate.\r\n\r\n  It brings to our memory that Indian camp,\r\n  Where men lay in ambush, every one with a lamp,\r\n  Each light darkly hid in a vessel of clay,\r\n  Till the sword should be drawn, and then on came the fray.\r\n  'Twas so in the fortunes of this queer earthen race,\r\n  (It happened before they were more than a brace).\r\n    The fact of a fall\r\n    Did break upon all!\r\n  The lamp of each life being uncovered by sin,\r\n  The pitcher was broken, and the devil pitched in!\r\n\r\n  So much for his story to the moment he erred,\r\n  From what dignified pot he became a pot-sherd.\r\n    Since that day the great world,\r\n    Like a wheel having twirled,\r\n  Hath replenished the earth from the primitive pair,\r\n  And turned into being every species of ware.\r\n\r\n  There are millions and millions on the planet to-day,\r\n  Of all sorts, and all sizes, all ranks we may say;\r\n  There's a rabble of pots, with the dregs and the scum,\r\n  And a peerage of pots, above finger and thumb.\r\n\r\n  Look round in this pottery, look down to the ground,\r\n  Where bottle and mug, jug and pottle abound;\r\n  From the plebeian throng see the graded array;\r\n  There is shelf above shelf of brittle display,\r\n  As rank above rank the poor mortals arise,\r\n  From menial purpose to princely disguise.\r\n\r\n  See vessels of honor, emblazoned with cash,\r\n  Of standing uncertain, preparing to dash.\r\n  See some to dishonor, in common clay-bake,\r\n  Figure high where the fire and the flint do partake.\r\n\r\n  There's the bottle of earth by glittering glass,\r\n  As by blood of the gentlest excelling its class,\r\n    Becoming instanter\r\n    A portly decanter!\r\n\r\n  There's the lowly bowl, or the basin broad,\r\n  By double refinement a punch-bowl lord!\r\n  There's the beggarly jug, ignoble and base,\r\n  By adornment of art the Portland vase!\r\n\r\n  But call them, title them, what you will,\r\n  They're bound to break, they are brittle still;\r\n  No saving pieces, or repairing,\r\n  No Spaulding's glue for human erring;\r\n  All alike they will go together,\r\n  And lie in Potter's field forever.\r\n\r\n  At length the whole secret of life is told:\r\n  'Tis because we're earth, and not of gold,\r\n  'Tis because we're ware that beware we must,\r\n  Lest we crack, and break, and crumble to dust.\r\n\r\n  What wonder that men so clash together,\r\n  And in the clash so break with each other!\r\n  Or that households are full of family jars,\r\n  And boys are such pickles in spite of papas!\r\n  That the cup of ill-luck is drained to the dregs,\r\n  When a man's in his cups and not on his legs!\r\n  That meaning should be in that word for a sot,\r\n  He's ruined forever--he's going to pot!\r\n\r\n  So goes the world and its generations,\r\n  So go its tribes, and its tribulations;\r\n  Crowding together on the stream of time,\r\n  It almost destroys the chime of my rhyme,\r\n  While they strike, and they grind, and rub and dash,\r\n  And are sure to go to eternal smash.\r\n  Lamentable sight to be seen here below!\r\n  Man after man sinking,--blow after blow,--\r\n  A bubble, a choke,--each blow is a knell,--\r\n  Broken forever!

Our supply of\r\n    water had failed. The well was deep, and, like Jacob's well,\r\n    many had been in the habit of coming thither to draw. My father\r\n    had called in advisers, men of experience, and they decided that\r\n    the lower part of the pump was rotten, and must be removed. It\r\n    had probably stood there more than fifty years, and had been so\r\n    useful in its day, that it was like an old and familiar friend.\r\n\r\n    The work was commenced, and all the family stood by the closed\r\n    window, the children's faces pressed close to the glass, as\r\n    with eager eyes we all watched the heavy machinery erected over\r\n    the old well. A mother came out of a neighboring house, and\r\n    stood with a babe in her arms to see the work. A large rope was\r\n    firmly placed around the pump, and made fast to the derrick.\r\n    Then came the tug of war, and with a long pull, a strong pull,\r\n    and a pull all together, the wooden pump rose up gradually from\r\n    its hiding-place of years.\r\n\r\n    'Oh, mother! mother!' I exclaimed; 'see, the derrick is not long\r\n    enough to raise the pump out of the well! Why don't they saw it\r\n    off, and take out the old pump in two or three pieces?'\r\n\r\n    Just then papa screamed to Mrs. Rice, 'Run out of the way,\r\n    quick, with your baby!'\r\n\r\n    There stood all the workmen in dismay. What was to be done? My\r\n    father had no idea that he had undertaken such a tremendous job,\r\n    and now he was in great perplexity. Who, indeed, could have\r\n    believed that the well was deep enough to hold a pump of such\r\n    immense size as this, that had become so old and rotten? Oh, for\r\n    ropes longer and stronger! Oh, for muscle and nerve! Oh, for men\r\n    of herculean strength to meet this terrible crisis! At that\r\n    moment, a timely suggestion, from any quarter, would have been\r\n    welcome. But, even then, it might have been too late; for the\r\n    pump fell with a tremendous crash, carrying with it all the\r\n    machinery. Papa fell upon the ground, but the derrick had safely\r\n    passed over him, prostrating the fences, and endangering the\r\n    lives of the workmen.\r\n\r\n    This scene, which was soon almost forgotten, is recalled by the\r\n    fearful crisis that is now upon us. While we rejoice in our\r\n    recent victories, and believe that this wicked rebellion will\r\n    soon be subdued, we must rejoice with trembling, so long as\r\n    SLAVERY, the acknowledged _casus belli_, still remains. The\r\n    unsightly monster, in all its rottenness and deformity, is drawn\r\n    up from the hiding-place of ages, and it can no more be restored\r\n    to its former _status_, than, at the will of the workmen, our\r\n    old pump could be thrust back, when, suspended in the air, it\r\n    threatened their destruction. God forbid that our rulers should\r\n    desire it! What, then, is to be done? No giant mind has yet been\r\n    found to grapple successfully with this great evil--no body of\r\n    men who can concentrate a moral power sufficient to remove this\r\n    worn-out system, without endangering some interest of vital\r\n    importance to our beloved country.\r\n\r\n    Zion must now lengthen her cords and strengthen her stakes, for\r\n    the wisdom of the wise has become foolishness, that God alone\r\n    may be exalted. He will surely bring down every high thought,\r\n    and every vain imagination, and his own people must learn what\r\n    it is 'to receive the kingdom of God as little children.' How\r\n    shall liberty be proclaimed throughout the length and breadth of\r\n    the land, to all the inhabitants thereof, and, in obedience to\r\n    the will of God, this year become a year of jubilee to the poor\r\n    and oppressed of our nation? How shall the emancipation of\r\n    slavery conduce to the best interest of the master, no less than\r\n    to the happiness of the slave?\r\n\r\n    Probably some very simple solution will be given to this\r\n    question, in answer to the earnest cry of God's people. Should\r\n    it please him to hide this thought for the crisis from the wise\r\n    and prudent, and reveal it unto babes, God grant that it may be\r\n    in our hearts to respond, 'Even so, Father, for so it seemeth\r\n    good in thy sight.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe simple solution has already been begun by our Executive, in\r\nrecognizing the _principle_--its extraordinary advance among all classes\r\nwill soon fully develop it. In illustration of this we quote a letter\r\nwhich the editor of the New Haven _Journal and Courier_ vouches to come\r\nfrom an officer in the navy, known to him:--\r\n\r\n    From what we see and know of the operations of the rebels in\r\n    this part of the South (the Southern coast, where he has been\r\n    stationed), and from what we see perfidious Englishmen doing for\r\n    the rebels, we are fast becoming strong abolitionists. We feel\r\n    that _now_ Slavery must receive its death-blow, and be destroyed\r\n    forever from the country. You would be surprised to see the\r\n    change going on in the minds of officers in our service, who\r\n    have been great haters of abolitionists; and the Southerners in\r\n    our navy are the most bitter toward those who have made slavery\r\n    the great cause of war. They freely express the opinion that the\r\n    whole system must be abolished, and even our old captain, who is\r\n    a native of Tennessee, and who has hitherto insisted that the\r\n    abolitionists of the North brought on this war, said last night,\r\n    'If England continues to countenance the _institution_, I hope\r\n    our government will put arms in the hands of the slaves, and\r\n    that slavery will now be the destruction of the whole South, or\r\n    of the rebels in the South.' He further said, 'The slave-holder\r\n    has, by the tacit consent and aid of England, brought on the\r\n    most unjustifiable, iniquitous and barbarous war ever known in\r\n    the history of the world.'\r\n\r\nToo far and too fast--it is not Abolition, or the good of the black, but\r\nEmancipation, or the benefit of the _white_ man, which is really\r\nprogressing so rapidly with the American people. But whatever causes of\r\nagitation are at work, whether on limited or general principles of\r\nphilanthropy and political economy, one thing is at least certain--the\r\nday of the triumph of free labor is dawning, while the cause of progress\r\n\r\n    'Careers with thunder speed along!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is almost a wonder that the late offer of the king of Siam to stock\r\nthis land with elephants was not jumped at, when one remembers the\r\nAmerican national fondness for the animal, and how copiously our popular\r\norators and poets allude to a sight of the monster. Among the latest\r\nelephantine tales which we have encountered is the following, from our\r\nNew Haven correspondent:--\r\n\r\n    Dr. H., of this pleasant city of Elms, has been noted for many\r\n    years for always driving the gentlest and most sober, but at the\r\n    same time the most fearfully 'homely' of horses. His steeds will\r\n    always stand wherever he pleases to leave them, but they have\r\n    rather a venerable and woful aspect, that renders them anything\r\n    but pleasant objects to the casual observer. A few years ago\r\n    there came a caravan to town, and several horses were badly\r\n    frightened by the elephants, so that quite a number of accidents\r\n    took place. A day or two after, old Dr. Knight met Dr. H., and\r\n    speaking of the accidents, Dr. Knight remarked that he had not\r\n    dared to take his horse out while the procession was passing\r\n    through the streets. 'Oh, ho!' said Dr. H., 'why, I took my mare\r\n    and drove right up alongside of them, and she wasn't the least\r\n    bit scared!'\r\n\r\n    'Hum--yes,' says Dr. K., '_but how did the elephant stand it_?'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy particular request we find room for the following:--\r\n\r\n    Hon. ---- then read his Poem entitled the 'Boulder,' which must\r\n    be heard before we can form an idea of the genius of the poet.\r\n    First we are reminded of the style of the sweet songs of\r\n    Pherimorz as his enchanting strains fell upon the enraptured\r\n    soul of the fair Lady of the Lake. Then away, on painted wings\r\n    of gratified imagination, is the mind carried to the zephyr\r\n    wooings of the dying sunset, over the elevated brow of the dark\r\n    Maid of the Forest, as she reclines upon her couch of eagles'\r\n    feathers, and down from angles wings, hearing the last whisper\r\n    of the falling echo from the world of sound.\r\n\r\n    Whether the wild chaos of storm and whirlwind which madly raged\r\n    over the benighted earth before 'light was,' rushed to the dark\r\n    caverns where the fettered earthquake lay, when order was\r\n    demanded by the Father of Lights, we can not tell; but surely it\r\n    is a pleasing thought for the mind engulfed in the unfathomed\r\n    darkness of uncreated light, to be brought out and suffered to\r\n    rest on the peaceful bosom of the new creation. Whether 'the\r\n    world that then was' was overflown and perished by the causes\r\n    set forth, we can not tell. We regret that we can not now give a\r\n    more extended and particular notice of this poem; let us hope\r\n    that ere long we may enjoy the delight of reading its printed\r\n    form.\r\n\r\nThat must indeed have been a poem which could inspire _such_ poetry in\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Boston _Courier_ published, over the signature of 'MIDDLESEX,'\r\nduring the months of February and March, a number of articles entitled,\r\n_Through the Gulf States_. So far as we have examined and compared the\r\nseries, it appears to be a literal reprint, with a few trivial\r\nalterations of dates and statistics, of the _Letters from the Gulf\r\nStates_, originally published in the _Knickerbocker New York Monthly\r\nMagazine_, in 1847.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE KNICKERBOCKER\r\n\r\nFOR 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the last year, when its present proprietors assumed\r\ncontrol of the Knickerbocker, they announced their determination to\r\nspare no pains to place it in its true position as the leading\r\n_literary_ Monthly in America. When rebellion had raised a successful\r\nfront, and its armies threatened the very existence of the Republic, it\r\nwas impossible to permit a magazine, which in its circulation reached\r\nthe best intellects in the land, to remain insensible or indifferent to\r\nthe dangers which threatened the Union. The proprietors accordingly gave\r\nnotice, that it would present in its pages, forcible expositions with\r\nregard to the great question of the times,--_how to preserve the_ UNITED\r\nSTATUS OF AMERICA _in their integrity and unity_. How far this pledge\r\nhas been redeemed the public must judge. It would, however, be mere\r\naffectation to ignore the seal of approbation which has been placed on\r\nthese efforts. The proprietors gratefully acknowledge this, and it has\r\nled them to embark in a fresh undertaking, as already announced,--the\r\npublication of the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY, devoted to Literature and\r\nNational Policy; in which magazine, those who have sympathized with the\r\npolitical opinions recently set forth in the KNICKERBOCKER, will find\r\nthe same views more fully enforced and maintained by the ablest and most\r\nenergetic minds in America.\r\n\r\nThe KNICKERBOCKER, while it will continue firmly pledged to the cause of\r\nthe Union, will henceforth be more earnestly devoted to literature, and\r\nwill leave no effort untried to attain the highest excellence in those\r\ndepartments of letters which it has adopted as specialties.\r\n\r\nThe January number commences its thirtieth year. With such antecedents\r\nas it possesses, it seems unnecessary to make any especial pledges as to\r\nits future, but it may not be amiss to say that it will be the aim of\r\nits conductors to make it more and more deserving of the liberal support\r\nit has hitherto received. The same eminent writers who have contributed\r\nto it during the past year will continue to enrich its pages, and in\r\naddition, contributions will appear from others of the highest\r\nreputation, as well as from many rising authors. While it will, as\r\nheretofore, cultivate the genial and humorous, it will also pay\r\nassiduous attention to the higher departments of art and letters, and\r\ngive fresh and spirited articles on such biographical, historical,\r\nscientific, and general subjects as are of especial interest to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nIn the January issue will commence a series of papers by CHARLES GODFREY\r\nLELAND, entitled \"SUNSHINE IN LETTERS,\" which will be found interesting\r\nto scholars as well as to the general reader, and in an early number\r\nwill appear the first chapters of a NEW and INTERESTING NOVEL,\r\ndescriptive of American life and character.\r\n\r\nAccording to the unanimous opinion of the American press, the\r\nKNICKERBOCKER has been greatly improved during the past year, _and it is\r\ncertain that at no period of its long career did it ever attract more\r\nattention or approbation_. Confident of their enterprise and ability,\r\nthe proprietors are determined that it shall be still more eminent in\r\nexcellence, containing all that is best of the old, and being\r\ncontinually enlivened by what is most brilliant of the new.\r\n\r\nTERMS.--Three dollars a year, in advance. Two copies for Four Dollars\r\nand fifty cents. Three copies for Six dollars. Subscribers remitting\r\nThree Dollars will receive as a premium, (post-paid,) a copy of Richard\r\nB. Kimball's great work, \"THE REVELATIONS OF WALL STREET,\" to be\r\npublished by G.P. Putnam, early in February next, (price $1.)\r\nSubscribers remitting Four Dollars will receive the KNICKERBOCKER and\r\nthe CONTINENTAL MONTHLY for one year. As but one edition of each number\r\nof the Knickerbocker is printed, those desirous of commencing with the\r\nvolume should subscribe at once.\r\n\r\nThe publisher, appreciating the importance of literature to the soldier\r\non duty, will send a copy _gratis_, during the continuance of the war,\r\nto any regiment in active service, on application being made by its\r\nColonel or Chaplain. Subscriptions will also be received from those\r\ndesiring it sent to soldiers in the ranks at _half price_, but in such\r\ncases it must be mailed from the office of publication.\r\n\r\nJ.R.

These crises sweep away in a moment\r\nthe landmarks of generations. They call out fresh talent, and give to\r\nthe old a new direction. It is then that new ideas are born, new\r\ntheories developed. Such periods demand fresh exponents, and new men for\r\nexpounders.\r\n\r\nThis Continent has lately been convulsed by an upheaving so sudden and\r\nterrible that the relations of all men and all classes to each other are\r\nviolently disturbed, and people look about for the elements with which\r\nto sway the storm and direct the whirlwind. Just at present, we do not\r\nknow what all this is to bring forth; but we do know that great results\r\nMUST flow from such extraordinary commotions.\r\n\r\nAt a juncture so solemn and so important, there is a special need that\r\nthe intellectual force of the country should be active and efficient. It\r\nis a time for great minds to speak their thoughts boldly, and to take\r\nposition as the advance guard. To this end, there is a special want\r\nunsupplied. It is that of an Independent Magazine, which shall be open\r\nto the first intellects of the land, and which shall treat the issues\r\npresented, and to be presented to the country, in a tone no way tempered\r\nby partisanship, or influenced by fear, favor, or the hope of reward;\r\nwhich shall seize and grapple with the momentous subjects that the\r\npresent disturbed state of affairs heave to the surface, and which CAN\r\nNOT be laid aside or neglected.\r\n\r\nTo meet this want, the undersigned have commenced, under the editorial\r\ncharge of CHARLES GODFREY LELAND, the publication of a new Magazine,\r\ndevoted to Literature and National Policy.\r\n\r\nIn POLITICS, it will advocate, with all the force at its command,\r\nmeasures best adapted to preserve the oneness and integrity of these\r\nUnited States. It will never yield to the idea of any disruption of this\r\nRepublic, peaceably or otherwise; and it will discuss with honesty and\r\nimpartiality what must be done to save it. In this department, some of\r\nthe most eminent statesmen of the time will contribute regularly to its\r\npages.\r\n\r\nIn LITERATURE, it will be sustained by the best writers and ablest\r\nthinkers of this country.\r\n\r\nAmong its attractions will be presented, in an early number, a NEW\r\nSERIAL of American Life, by RICHARD B. KIMBALL, ESQ., the very popular\r\nauthor of \"The Revelations of Wall Street,\" \"St. Leger,\" &c. A series of\r\npapers by HON. HORACE GREELEY, embodying the distinguished author's\r\nobservations on the growth and development of the Great West. A series\r\nof articles by the author of \"Through the Cotton States,\" containing the\r\nresult of an extended tour in the seaboard Slave States, just prior to\r\nthe breaking out of the war, and presenting a startling and truthful\r\npicture of the real condition of that region. No pains will be spared to\r\nrender the literary attractions of the CONTINENTAL both brilliant and\r\nsubstantial. The lyrical or descriptive talents of the most eminent\r\n_literati_ have been promised to its pages; and nothing will be admitted\r\nwhich will not be distinguished by marked energy, originality, and solid\r\nstrength. Avoiding every influence or association partaking of clique or\r\ncoterie, it will be open to all contributions of real merit, even from\r\nwriters differing materially in their views; the only limitation\r\nrequired being that of devotion to the Union, and the only standard of\r\nacceptance that of intrinsic excellence.\r\n\r\nThe EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT will embrace, in addition to vigorous and\r\nfearless comments on the events of the times, genial gossip with the\r\nreader on all current topics, and also devote abundant space to those\r\nracy specimens of American wit and humor, without which there can be no\r\nperfect exposition of our national character. Among those who will\r\ncontribute regularly to this department may be mentioned the name of\r\nCHARLES F. BROWNE (\"Artemus Ward\"), from whom we have promised an\r\nentirely new and original series of SKETCHES OF WESTERN LIFE.\r\n\r\nThe CONTINENTAL will be liberal and progressive, without yielding to\r\nchimeras and hopes beyond the grasp of the age; and it will endeavor to\r\nreflect the feelings and interests of the American people, and to\r\nillustrate both their serious and humorous peculiarities. In short, no\r\npains will be spared to make it the REPRESENTATIVE MAGAZINE of the time.\r\n\r\nTERMS:--Three Dollars per year, in advance (postage paid by the\r\nPublishers;) Two Copies for Five Dollars; Three Copies for Six Dollars,\r\n(posture unpaid); Eleven copies for Twenty Dollars, (postage unpaid).\r\nSingle numbers can be procured of any News-dealer in the United States.\r\nThe KNICKERBOCKER MAGAZINE and the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY will be furnished\r\nfor one year at FOUR DOLLARS.\r\n\r\nAppreciating the importance of literature to the soldier on duty, the\r\npublisher will send the CONTINENTAL, _gratis_, to any regiment in active\r\nservice, on application being made by its Colonel or Chaplain; he will\r\nalso receive subscriptions from those desiring to furnish it to soldiers\r\nin the ranks at half the regular price; but in such cases it must be\r\nmailed from the office of publication.\r\n\r\nJ.R.

Kimball, Esq., entitled 'WAS HE SUCCESSFUL?' an account of the life\r\nand conduct of Hiram Meeker, one of the leading men in the mercantile\r\ncommunity, and 'a bright and shining light' in the Church, recounting\r\nwhat he did, and how he made his money.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: An incident that occurred at Palmyra, in Marion County, of\r\nwhich the writer was a witness, may be given as a fair illustration of\r\nBenton's insulting and insufferable manner in this celebrated canvass.\r\nDuring the delivery of his speech, in the densely-crowded court-house, a\r\nprominent county politician, who was opposed to Benton, arose and put a\r\nquestion to him. 'Come here,' said Benton, in his abrupt and\r\nauthoritative tone. The man with difficulty made his way through the\r\nmass, and advanced till he stood immediately in front of Benton. 'Who\r\nare you, sir?' inquired the swelling and indignant senator. The citizen\r\ngave his well-known name. 'Who?' demanded Benton. The name was\r\ndistinctly repeated. And then, without replying to the question that had\r\nbeen proposed, but with an air of disdain and annihilating contempt that\r\nno man in America but Benton could assume, he proceeded with his speech,\r\nleaving his interrogator to retire from his humiliating embarrassment as\r\nbest he could. At the close of the address, some of his friends\r\nexpressed surprise to Benton that he had not known the man that\r\ninterrupted him. 'Know him!' said he; 'I knew him well enough. I only\r\nmeant to make him stand with his hat in his hand, and tell me his name,\r\nlike a nigger.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: See Historical Mag., Vol. 4, p. 230.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: Among the cotton lately arrived from Port Royal was a\r\nnumber of bales marked with the form of a coffin. It was the growth of\r\n'Coffin's Island,' which is usually of the highest grade.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: The palmetto is a straight, tall tree, with a tuft of\r\nbranches and palm leaves at its top. The new growth is the centre as it\r\nfirst expands somewhat resembles a cabbage. It is often used for boiling\r\nand pickling. The wood of the tree is spongy, and is used for building\r\nwharves, as it is impervious to the sea-worm. It is said that a cannon\r\nball will not penetrate it. It is a paltry emblem for a State flag, as\r\nits characteristics accurately indicate pride and poverty. When used for\r\nwharves, it, however, becomes a veritable '_Mudsill_.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: Before 1700 a colony from Dorchester, Mass., made a\r\nsettlement on Ashley River, and named it for their native town;\r\nafterwards, they sent an offshoot and planted the town of Midway, in\r\nGeorgia. For more than a century they kept up their Congregational\r\nChurch, with many of their New England institutions. Their descendants\r\nin both States have been famed for their enterprise, industry, and moral\r\nqualities down to the present day.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: The Barnwells can trace their pedigree back about one\r\nhundred and fifty years to a Col. Barnwell who commanded in an Indian\r\nwar. Subsequently the name appears on the right side in the Revolution.\r\nThis is a long period to trace ancestry in Carolina; for while nearly\r\nall New England families can trace back to the Puritans, more than two\r\nhundred years, the lordly Carolinians generally get among the 'mudsills'\r\nin three or four generations at the farthest.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: Some thirty years ago, R. Barnwell Smith made a figure in\r\nCongress by his ultra nullification speeches, and was then considered\r\nthe greatest fire-eater of them all. He was not 'to the manor born,' but\r\nwas the son of a Gen. Smith, who founded and resided in the small and\r\npoverty-stricken town of Smithville, N.C., at the mouth of the Cape Fear\r\nRiver. As his paternal fortune was small, and some family connection\r\nexisted with the Barnwells, he emigrated to Beaufort, and there\r\npracticed as a lawyer. He was followed by two brothers, who had the same\r\nprofession. He was the first who openly advocated secession in Congress.\r\nThey have all been leading politicians and managers of the Charleston\r\n_Mercury_, which, by its mendacity and constant abuse of the North, and\r\nits everlasting laudations of Southern wealth and power, has done much\r\nto bring on the present war.\r\n\r\nDesirous to stand better with the aristocracy, some years ago the family\r\nsunk the plebeian patronymic of Smith and adopted that of Rhett, a name\r\nknown in South Carolina a century previous.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: During Nullification times the Fullers were Union men.\r\nDoctor Thomas Fuller, who, a short time since, set fire to his buildings\r\nand cotton crop to prevent their falling into Yankee hands, is well\r\nknown as a kind-hearted physician, and better things might have been\r\nexpected of him.\r\n\r\nHis brother is a celebrated Baptist clergyman in Baltimore. He was\r\nformerly a lawyer, and afterwards preached to an immense congregation,\r\nmainly of slaves, in his native place.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote I: Many years ago the Elliots were staunch Union men, and\r\nStephen Elliot, a gentleman of talent, wrote many very able arguments\r\nagainst nullification and in favor of the Union. He always thought that\r\nPort Royal must some day be the great naval and commercial depot of the\r\nSouth. He may yet live to see his former anticipations realized, though\r\nnot in the way he desired.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: An Inquiry laid by me it few years ago before the\r\nHistorical Society of Pennsylvania elicited information as to several of\r\nthese 'gates' in that State. I have not the work by me, but I believe\r\nthat FALES DUNLAP, Esq., of New York, asserts on Rabbinical authority,\r\nin an appendix to _Sod or the Mysteries_, that the Hebrew word commonly\r\ntranslated as 'passover' should be rendered 'passing through.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: _Robertson's Lectures and Addresses._ Boston: Ticknor &\r\nFields.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote L: The negro whippers and field overseers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote M: Referring to the common practice of bathing the raw and\r\nbleeding backs of the punished slaves with a strong solution of salt and\r\nwater.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote N: _Words to the West.
