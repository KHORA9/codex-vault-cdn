THOMAS\r\n\r\nof Belfast Transvaal formerly Orange Free State Burgher\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND EDITION\r\n\r\nLONDON: HODDER AND STOUGHTON\r\n\r\n27 PATERNOSTER ROW MCM\r\n\r\n_Butler & Tanner The Selwood Printing Works Frome and London_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present book had been intended for publication in South Africa\r\nbefore the end of 1899, with the object of laying bare the wicked and\r\ndelusive aims of the Afrikaner Bond combination, to which the Anglo-Boer\r\nwar alone is attributable, and to counteract its disastrous influences\r\nso far as then still possible. But until quite lately circumstances had\r\nconspired so as to prevent the writer from leaving the Transvaal, and\r\nwhen he at last obtained the required passport to Lourenço Marques he\r\nwas there denied a permit to visit a colonial port. He therefore sailed\r\nfor London in order to publish this book without more loss of time.\r\nThough too late to serve as a deterrent, the contents may be effective\r\ntowards showing up the really guilty parties--the instigators and\r\nseducers of the deluded Boer nation, and so pave and widen the avenue of\r\npeace and of conciliation between Boer and Briton who were duped and\r\nvictimized alike.\r\n\r\nThe exposure of the actual culprits and originators should also operate\r\nfavourably, and in mitigation in behalf of the much less guilty Boers,\r\nso as to dispose the victors to the exercise of magnanimous\r\nconsideration. In exposing the villainy of the Dutch coterie in Holland,\r\nthe writer is far from impugning the honourable character of that\r\nnation, the better part of whom, when once undeceived, will be the first\r\nto reprobate and disown those arch-plotters who sacrificed the peace of\r\nSouth Africa for personal and national advantage.\r\n\r\nSome other information regarding the Boers and South Africa will be\r\nfound interspersed in this study, which will be found of use to the\r\nuninitiated and to intending emigrants to that sub-continent. As the\r\nreader proceeds with the examination of this book it will suggest\r\ncomparisons and even analogies which may commend themselves as\r\nsingularly apposite and instructive in relation with the study of the\r\npresently budding Eastern question.\r\n\r\nC.H.

The marked reticence on the part\r\nof the British Cabinet in regard to its diplomatic proceedings tends\r\nfurther to mystify the inquirer, and leaves the bulk of the British\r\nnation in a painful state of suspense without conclusive data for\r\njudging whether the war is really justifiable or not.\r\n\r\nNor do the various pamphlets and Press articles furnish sufficient light\r\nfor exploring the maze and producing an approximate unanimity of\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the succeeding pages will be found to supplement the\r\nmaterial so essential for diagnosing those grave questions with some\r\ndegree of certainty, and to locate the guilt more precisely.\r\n\r\nSince my youth I have passed nearly forty years in uninterrupted and\r\nintimate intercourse with all classes of Boers, resulting in a sincere\r\nattachment to that people, with no small appreciation of its many good\r\ntraits and character. Besides making myself familiar with the earlier\r\nportion of that nation's history, I have had leisure and opportunities\r\nto closely follow up its later interesting phases up to the present\r\nmoment. These presented a more perplexing aspect during the last decade,\r\nadding a zest to my endeavours for unravelling them, and happening to\r\nbe a good deal in the know I felt that I might not remain quiet.\r\n\r\nBeing anything but anti-Boer, nor an Englishman, but a foreigner, born\r\nof continental parents and brought up in Europe, these facts should\r\nexempt me from a supposition of bias in exonerating England. It is with\r\nreal grief that I must record my convictions against the Boer nation as\r\nsolely and entirely guilty, but with this qualification, that its\r\nresponsibility is much attenuated by the fact, as I will endeavour to\r\nshow, that the bulk of that people has been unconsciously decoyed as\r\ntools of a gigantic intrigue, a conspiracy which was originated some\r\nthirty years ago by an infamous Hollander coterie, and operated since by\r\nits product and engine, the now well-known \"Afrikaner Bond Association,\"\r\nwith its significant motto of \"Afrika voor Afrikaners\"[1]--its object\r\nbeing no less than the eviction of all that is English from South\r\nAfrica, and to substitute a federation of all South African States into\r\none free and independent Republic, the affiliation to be with Holland\r\ninstead, and Dutch the common and official language, other nations, in\r\nreturn for afforded aid, to participate in the trade and other\r\nadvantages wrested from England.\r\n\r\nI only regret that my ability falls so much short for the task of\r\ndemonstrating all this in an approved style--for doing justice to the\r\nsubject. Its investigation embraces a wider range of details to serve as\r\nevidence than may, upon first thought, be held as relevant; but I\r\nbelieve that a willing study will show their connection as serviceable\r\nfor arriving at an independent and unhesitating verdict.\r\n\r\nA very strong and convincing case is indeed needed for remodelling\r\nopinions where there is preconceived Boer partisanship, and where party\r\nspirit or else foreign jealousy have already warped judgment and\r\nestablished bias.\r\n\r\nIt would be no small relief to every honest-minded person, especially in\r\nEngland, to be clear upon the subject that England is free of\r\nguilt--equally so to the soldier who is called upon to fight her\r\nbattles. But other objects of no less importance are in view, viz., to\r\nopen the eyes of the misguided Boer people to the wicked artifices by\r\nwhich it has been seduced from friendly relations with England into an\r\nunjustifiable war, to deter the still wavering portion from joining the\r\nranks of sedition, and, lastly, the grounds for palliation being\r\nrecognised, to pave the way to an early termination of the war by\r\nadjustments which could restore mutual goodwill and respect between the\r\ncontending parties, and so bring about a speedy return of South African\r\nprosperity and progress.\r\n\r\nThe writer is fully prepared to give data and names of the incidents\r\nadduced in this paper in support of their authenticity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Africa for white African citizens.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURSORY HISTORY OF THE BOER NATION\r\n\r\nThe two principal elements of the Boer nation were the settlers of the\r\nDutch trading company at the Cape of Good Hope, sturdy farmers and\r\ntradesmen belonging to the proletarian class of Holland, and a\r\nsubsequent contingent of French Huguenot refugees and their families who\r\njoined as colonists soon after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. I\r\nmention below the names still existing which form a large proportion of\r\nthe present Boer nation of Huguenot descent:--\r\n\r\nBillion     Blignaut  Bisseux   Delporte\r\nDu prez     Du Toit   De la Bey Durand\r\nDavel       De Langue Duvenage  Fourie\r\nFouché      Grove     Hugo      Jourdan\r\nLombard     Le Roux   Roux      Lagrange\r\nLabuscaque  Maré      Marais    Malan\r\nMalraison   Maynard   Malherbe  De Meillon\r\nDe Marillac Matthée   Naudé     Nortier\r\nRousseau    Taillard  Theron    Terblanche\r\nDe Villiers Fortier   Lindeque  Vervier\r\nVercueil    Basson    Pinard    Duvenage\r\nCelliers    de Clercq Leclercq  Devinare\r\n\r\nMen of the best French stock, noted for honour, energy and\r\nperseverance, rather than recant their Protestant faith, abandoned\r\nseigneurial homes, high positions and lucrative callings to carve out\r\nfresh careers, and even to become humble farmers wherever they found\r\nasylums and tolerance, men who became very valuable accessions to the\r\nnations who received them and a correspondingly significant loss to\r\nFrance. To those two main elements were added sparse accessions from\r\nother nations at later intervals, and also a strain of aboriginal blood,\r\nof which a more or less faint tinge is still discernible in some\r\nfamilies, an admixture which many deplore and others consider as most\r\nserviceable, supplying a subtle piquancy for perfecting the general\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nThe early Cape Governors aimed at the prompt assimilation of those\r\nFrench people with their own colonists--to make Dutchmen of them. Among\r\nother drastic enactments to enforce that object, no other language but\r\nDutch was permitted to be used in public of pain of corporal punishment.\r\nNot a few noble Frenchmen were subjected to that indignity for\r\ninadvertent breaches of that draconian law, but, as conscientious\r\nobservers of biblical commands which enjoin subjection to all\r\ngovernmental rule, they willingly submitted and obeyed. Intermarriages\r\nwith their Dutch fellow-colonists further promoted assimilation into one\r\ncohesive community. At the same time the Huguenot faith was transmitted\r\nto their descendants, and had a marked influence in sustaining common\r\nreligious fervour and consistency. They did not look for a reward or\r\ncompensation for the sacrifices endured, for the sake of faith, by those\r\nrefugees, though a gracious providence, as the sequel showed, held in\r\nstore a most ample restitution--magnificent heirlooms for their later\r\ndescendants, heirlooms which are now unhappily staked in this present\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 a payment of six millions sterling received by the Prince of\r\nOrange closed the transfer of the Dutch Cape settlement to Great\r\nBritain. Immigration of English settlers followed and the area of the\r\ncolony soon largely extended. As under the Dutch _régime_, the practice\r\nof slavery had continued until its abolition in 1833 by the ransom\r\npayable by the English Government to the owners of slaves. The Boer\r\ncolonists deeply resented that act, and especially the next to\r\nimpracticable condition which provided that payments could only be\r\nreceived in England instead of on the spot. Many were cheated of all\r\ntheir emancipation money by their appointed proxies or agents, or else\r\nhad to submit to exorbitant charges and commissions; a great number\r\nvoluntarily renounced all in disgust.\r\n\r\nBy that time the existence had become known of promising tracts of\r\ncountry lying north of the Orange River beyond the confines of the\r\nBritish colonies, and a large number of Boers combined with the\r\nintention of establishing an independent community northwards free from\r\nBritish restraint.\r\n\r\nThe British authorities appeared at that time not to fully realize that\r\nthat movement was rife with future dangers and complications to their\r\nown colonial interests, that it meant the creation of a nucleus of a\r\npeople openly averse to the English, and who would independently carry\r\nout practices in near proximity, especially in dealing with aborigines,\r\nwhich would seriously compromise them and become a standing menace\r\nagainst peaceful expansion and civilization.\r\n\r\nIt was, on the other hand, anticipated that the movement could only end\r\nin disaster, the people being too few to make a successful stand against\r\nthe numerous hostile Kaffir tribes. The Government, therefore, refrained\r\nfrom preventive measures, and confined its efforts to discouraging the\r\nemigration and to reconcile the malcontents. Those efforts, however,\r\nproved fruitless; the people held to their project with resolute\r\nfearlessness and self-confidence, and were even content to sacrifice\r\ntheir farms and homesteads, their sale being in some cases forbidden by\r\nspecial enactment.\r\n\r\nThe terms of \"Boer\" and \"Boer nation\" do not convey or mean anything\r\ndisparaging, rather the contrary. Boer simply means farmer, as a rule\r\nthe proprietor of a farm of about 3,000 to 10,000 acres, who combines\r\nstock-breeding with a variety of other farming enterprises as well,\r\naccording to the soil and locality. As a national designation, the term\r\n\"Boer\" conveys the distinction from the recently arrived Dutchman, who\r\nis called \"Hollander.\" Hollanders, again, delight of late to claim the\r\nBoer nation as their kith and kin, but prefer to ignore the existence of\r\nthe French Huguenot factor.\r\n\r\nThe great \"trek,\" with families and movables, as the emigration movement\r\nis called, occurred in 1836; some families started even before, and\r\nother contingents followed shortly afterwards. After many vicissitudes\r\nand nearly twenty years of wanderings, and a nomadic life attended with\r\nuntold hardships and dangers, intermittent conflicts with native tribes,\r\nand at times also contests with British forces, they were eventually\r\npermitted, under treaty with England, to settle down and to constitute\r\nthe independent Orange Free State and Transvaal Republics. That was in\r\n1854 and 1852 respectively.\r\n\r\nBut, until then, progress in the British colonies and peaceful relations\r\nwith the several Kaffir nations had at times been sadly impeded by the\r\naggressive native policy pursued by the Boers after the pattern adopted\r\nfrom the previous Dutch _régime_, which admitted of slavery, whilst\r\nEnglish law had abolished and forbade that practice as contrary to a\r\nsoundly moral method of civilizing natives and inimical to prosperous\r\nand peaceable colonial progress. Broils and wars between Boers and\r\nKaffirs had been almost incessant, and intervals of peace only proved\r\ntheir mutually latent hostility. Besides being occasionally engaged in\r\nunavoidable wars with neighbouring tribes themselves, it became\r\nfrequently incumbent upon the British military authorities to intervene\r\nin conflicts induced by the Boers, alternately protecting them against\r\nnatives and natives against the Boers, and all that at the unnecessary\r\nexpenditure of much blood and treasure.\r\n\r\nThe Boer occupation of Natal was found to be wholly prejudicial to\r\nBritish interests on aforesaid accounts, and was, besides, contrary to\r\nthe express declaration of the Boer emigrants at the time of their\r\nexodus from the Cape Colony, which was that their new settlements should\r\nbe located north of the Orange River. Stepping in to the eastward and\r\nclaiming part of the littoral constituted a rivalry in conflict with\r\nthat understanding, and England therefore considered it within her\r\nrights to expel the Boers from Natal, and to proceed with the\r\ncolonization there with British settlers instead. That temporary\r\noccupation of Natal had been fraught to the Boers with most stirring\r\nepisodes--some of the most melancholy description, and others\r\nrepresenting records of really unsurpassed heroism, which can but arouse\r\ndeepest emotions and admiration in any reader of their history. There\r\nwas the treacherous massacre of Retief and Potgeiter and his party by\r\nthe Zulu king Dingaan at his military kraal, followed by other wholesale\r\nmassacres of men, women, and children at Weenen and other Boer camps in\r\nNatal. Then came the punitive expedition of 450 Boers, armed with\r\nflint-locks only, who utterly defeated Dingaan's most redoubtable impi\r\nof 10,000 warriors, and resulted in the complete overthrow of that Zulu\r\nmonarch.\r\n\r\nWhen that punitive Boer commando was about to start upon its mission it\r\nwas solemnly vowed to observe a day of national thanksgiving each year\r\nif Divine aid were vouchsafed to accomplish the object. That brilliant\r\nvictory had occurred on the 16th December, 1838, and the day has ever\r\nsince been religiously observed as had been vowed. The celebrations in\r\nthe Transvaal take place at Paarden-kraal, near Johannesburg, and some\r\nother accessible and central camping grounds, where the burghers with\r\ntheir families congregate in thousands--a sort of feast of tabernacles,\r\nlasting three days, undeterred by the most boisterous weather. The\r\ndeclaration of independence fell on that same date at Paarden-kraal in\r\n1879, and it was also in December of the succeeding year that the Boers\r\nproved victorious over the British troops in Natal, after which the\r\nTransvaal had its independence generously restored by the Gladstone\r\nMinistry (subject to treaty 1881).\r\n\r\nOn those anniversaries stirring speeches would be made by the elder\r\nleading men, rehearsing the events of the nation's history so as to\r\ngrave them upon the minds of the younger, and to revive the thankful\r\nmemories of the elder people. It is only in human nature that\r\nunsympathetic feelings against the English would intrude upon the\r\nthanksgivings on those occasions, especially as it continues yet to be\r\naverred that the British authorities had incited the Zulu king Dingaan\r\nto those massacres. Nevertheless, except in instances of implacable\r\nnatures, the predominant sentiments at those gatherings were those of\r\ngratitude to the Almighty and good-will towards all men. After the peace\r\nof 1881, it used to be publicly recognised that the English were\r\nentitled thenceforth to a first place in the nation's friendship, and\r\nthat the retrocession put a term to all recriminations applying to\r\nprevious dates.\r\n\r\nThe sequel has shown that soon afterwards another spirit was allowed to\r\nintrude to displace those good and just sentiments, and that without any\r\nreason or provocation and despite a persistently loyal and sincere\r\nattitude of friendship and confidence observed towards the Boers by the,\r\nBritish Government and the English people in South Africa. As instances\r\nmay be cited: (1) England's conceding spirit in assenting to a\r\nmodification of the convention of 1881 and agreeing to that of 1884; (2)\r\ngenial treatment of the colonial Boers on perfect equality with English\r\ncolonists, sharing in the privileges of self-government, the Dutch\r\nlanguage also raised to equal rights with English; (3) most harmonious\r\nrelations with the Orange Free State; (4) reduction of transit duties\r\nfor goods to the Republics to 5 per cent, and later to 3 per cent.; (5)\r\nunrestricted privilege for the importations of arms and ammunition to\r\nboth Republics. In lieu of friendly reciprocity the return began to be\r\nrancorous mistrust and revival of hatred.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our study to account for this sad and unwarrantable\r\nchange on the part of the Boers we will be following the trail of the\r\nserpent and track it right up to its Hollander lair and to its at first\r\nunsuspected product, the Afrikaner Bond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSPERITY OF BOERS AND POLITICAL RELATIONS WITH ENGLAND UP TO 1881\r\n\r\n\r\nA period of about twenty-five years following the establishment of the\r\nOrange Free State and Transvaal Republics was marked with much progress\r\nand prosperity in the Cape Colonies and Natal, both Republics also\r\nhaving cause to rejoice over similar advancement.\r\n\r\nThe evil influence which aimed at rending good relations between Boer\r\nand English became more apparent after 1881. During the preceding era\r\nthe two races actually had been in a fair way towards friendly\r\nassimilation. Mutual appreciation was further stimulated by the\r\nreciprocal benefits arising from trade and economic relations.\r\nIntermarriages became more frequent under such friendly intercourse, a\r\nrespectable Englishman being truly prized in those days as a Boer's\r\nson-in-law. The English language also largely advanced in favour and\r\nprestige not only among the Cape Colonial and Natal Boers, but also in\r\nboth Republics, and anti-English sentiments were fast being supplanted\r\nby amity and goodwill.\r\n\r\nThe principal event in the Orange Free State during that period was a\r\nthree years' exhaustive war with the Basuto nation, which ended in the\r\nlatter's defeat in 1867. Their chief Moshesh then appealed for British\r\nintervention. The Basutos thus came under England's protection, and a\r\npeace resulted which has ever since continued, through British prestige\r\nand authority as well as good government. The Orange Free State gained a\r\nlarge tract of the territory conquered by that State, but had to\r\nrenounce the rest.\r\n\r\nThen, in about 1870, came the discovery of the diamond-fields, situated\r\non the then still ill-defined western limits of the State. According to\r\na boundary line claimed by Great Britain, those diamond-fields fell\r\noutside Free State territory. That State received £90,000 compensation\r\nfor improvements and expenses incurred during its short occupation of\r\nthat disputed strip of diamondiferous ground. The diamond-fields at\r\nJagersfontein and Koffyfontein were subsequently discovered and lie deep\r\nwithin the confines of the State. President Brand had proved his\r\nsagacity and discretion in concluding the negotiations with England\r\nupon the question of the peace with the Basutos and then again in\r\nsubmitting to the boundary delimitations, it being contended even yet\r\nthat the Orange Free State had the weightier arguments in its favour in\r\nboth instances.\r\n\r\nThe people of that Republic proved however to be the ultimate gainers in\r\nthose adjustments; they did not miss the more solid advantages attending\r\nthe discovery of the diamond-fields. Believed of the grave\r\nresponsibility involved in governing a turbulent population of foreign\r\ndiggers, the geographical position of the Kimberley fields secured to\r\nthe Free State farmers an almost entire monopoly in the supply of\r\nproducts; trade also flourished apace, all tending to enrich the\r\ninhabitants and the State revenue as well.\r\n\r\nBut the Orange Free State derived a permanent advantage, quite unique\r\nand more than compensating the apparent set-back suffered by the loss of\r\nthe diamond-field territory and by British intervention in the Basuto\r\nwar matter, in that the method of those procedures saddled England with\r\nthe responsibility of guaranteeing the internal safety of the State from\r\nthose hitherto unprotected borders \"altogether at her own cost.\" The\r\nKeate award completed the British cordon around the Free State,\r\nexcepting only in regard to the Transvaal frontier. No need thenceforth\r\nfor costly military provisions for the protection of the State--it was,\r\nas it were, walled and fenced in at British expense, and the State\r\nrevenue was thus for ever relieved of a very heavy item of expenditure,\r\nwhich could be devoted to the increase of the national wealth instead--a\r\npeaceful security accompanied with an intrinsic gain constituting a\r\nveritable and permanent heirloom for the people of that State.\r\n\r\nIt is notable that the position of the Orange Free State, without any\r\nother access to the sea-board than from colonial ports, made its status\r\nand welfare entirely dependent upon the friendly and loyal good faith of\r\nEngland. Up to the present unhappy war that State enjoyed unaltered the\r\nbest relations without being ever subjected to even a trace of chicanery\r\nfrom the part of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBy what illusion, it may well be asked, could that hitherto friendly\r\npeople have been deluded to risk all in a disloyal breach with England\r\nby joining the Transvaal in a \"Bond\" issue against her best friend?\r\nTowards the Transvaal also had England proved her earnest desire to\r\nmaintain an intercourse on the basis of sincere amity, desirous only of\r\nreciprocity, which indeed could be expected in willing return, seeing\r\nthat England took upon her own shoulders to provide for the protection\r\nand welfare of the entire area of South Africa by sea and land, whilst\r\nboth Republics freely participated in all the great benefits so derived.\r\nThese considerations should substantially disprove the wicked aspersion\r\nlately made that British policy aimed at the subversion of republican\r\nautonomy in those two States. All that Great Britain needed and\r\nconfidently expected in return for her goodwill was friendly adhesion,\r\nand a willing recognition of her paramountcy in matters affecting the\r\ncommon weal of South Africa as a whole, and also such reciprocity and\r\nmutual concern in the welfare of all as consistently comport with common\r\ninterests. How fell and malignant the \"influence\" which operated a\r\ntreacherous ingratitude and hostility instead!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSVAAL HISTORY--SUZERAINTY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe references made to the history of the Transvaal so far reach up to\r\nthe rehabilitation of its independence and the convention of 1881. Some\r\nof the conditions of that treaty, especially the subordinate position\r\nimposed by the suzerainty clause, were found to be repugnant to the\r\nburghers. Delegates were therefore commissioned to proceed to England in\r\norder to get the treaty so altered as to place the State into the status\r\nprovided by the Sand River convention, which conceded absolute\r\nindependence. Mr. Jorrison, a violent anti-English Hollander, was the\r\nchief adviser of the members of that delegation.\r\n\r\nTo that the English Ministry could not assent, but sought to meet the\r\nwishes of the people by agreeing to certain modifications of the\r\nconvention of 1881. This was effected with the treaty of 1884. The\r\ndelegates had specially urged the renunciation of the suzerainty claim,\r\nbut that claim appears not to have been abandoned, to judge from the\r\nabsence of such mention in the novated treaty. Had its renunciation been\r\nagreed to, as has been since averred, it is quite certain that the\r\ndelegates would not have been content without the mention in most\r\ndistinct terms of that, to them, so important point. It may therefore be\r\nassumed as a fact that the negotiations did not result in an active\r\nsuspension of the relations as set forth in the convention of 1881, and\r\nthat the Transvaal continued in a status of subordinacy to England, but\r\nonly with a wider range in regard to conditions of autonomy. To most lay\r\nminds it therefore appears perfectly clear that the Transvaal delegates\r\nhad well understood and accepted, and so had also their Government, that\r\nthe convention of 1884 was _de facto_ a renewal of that of 1881, with\r\nthe only difference that it provided an enlarged exercise of autonomy,\r\nbut without in the least abrogating the principles of respective\r\nrelations, which were left intact, or at least latent.\r\n\r\nIt has been averred and a strong point made in the theory of repudiating\r\nsuzerainty or over-lordship that Lord Kimberley had given the assurance\r\nthat the right of Transvaal autonomy and independence was meant to equal\r\nthat of the Orange Free State. This need not be contested, as that\r\nMinister obviously relied upon a similar observance of staunch adhesion\r\ntowards England which that State had shown during a period of thirty\r\nyears previous; the fact that the Transvaal was quite differently\r\nsituated as to adjoining territory imposed the necessity, if only as a\r\nmatter of form, to preserve the written conditions of Transvaal\r\nvassalage.\r\n\r\nLord Kimberley, in 1889, intimated the readiness of his Government to\r\nafford advisory and other co-operation with the Transvaal Government in\r\norder to cope with the new element of foreign immigration, resulting\r\nfrom the discovery of the rich gold-fields, and to provide appropriate\r\nrelations with a new floating population, without materially altering\r\nthe status of Transvaal authority, or the methods of government then in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal Government, however, preferred to ignore that loyal offer,\r\nand to be guided by Bond principles instead. That circumstance affords\r\nanother proof that England did not then see the necessity, as has\r\nsubsequently been the case, of strengthening her position against Bond\r\naggression by imposing a demand of general franchise for Uitlanders.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of the prolonged controversy _re_ suzerainty forced upon\r\nEngland would be to denote a lack of honour, which is not of unfrequent\r\noccurrence when one party to a contract seeks by cavil and legal quibble\r\nto evade compliance with some of its conditions, simply because the\r\nwritten terms appear to afford scope for doing so. But the principal\r\nreason of the Transvaal contention proceeded from the project of gaining\r\nover some strong foreign ally who would see an obstacle, if not\r\nscruples, in joining common cause whilst England's claim of\r\nover-lordship remained unshaken. But for that consideration the\r\nTransvaal Government inwardly viewed the whole of the treaties as waste\r\npaper, since it was not only intended to violate them all, but also to\r\nbring about, at an opportune moment, a hostile severance from England.\r\nIn the meantime, the academic squabble was to serve as a decoy to hide\r\nTransvaal identification with any such sinister objects, and to divert\r\nattention and suspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSVAAL HISTORY--TREATMENT OF UITLANDERS--FRANCHISE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo resume the cursory history of the Transvaal. Mr. Burger, during his\r\nPresidency in the early seventies, went to Europe with the mission of\r\nattracting capital to the development and exploitation of gold, etc.,\r\nthen already authentically discovered; also, to provide for the building\r\nof a railway connecting with Delagoa Bay. The Transvaal Boers were at\r\nthat time exceedingly poor, and without a sufficient revenue for\r\nproperly maintaining the administration. Beyond creating a lively\r\ninterest, his success was confined to an agreement with a company in\r\nHolland for building a section of that railroad, which, however, fell\r\nthrough, because the Transvaal proved ultimately unable to furnish its\r\nquota of the necessary funds. The present President fared better. A\r\nDutch company styled \"The Nederlandsch Zuid Afrikaansche Spoorweg\r\nMaatschappy,\" abbreviated \"Z.A.S.M.,\" undertook the work and completed\r\nit in 1887, from the Portuguese border to Pretoria. The line from\r\nPretoria to the Natal border was soon after built, as also several\r\nextensions around the Wit-waters Rand, and that from Pretoria to\r\nPietersburg. The section connecting Delagoa Bay as far as the Transvaal\r\nborder had previously been completed by McMurdo, and is the subject of\r\nthe present Berne arbitration.[2]\r\n\r\nThe contract conferred to the Dutch Company a monopoly, and most\r\nadvantageous financial terms as well. By that time great strides had\r\nbeen made in the development of the Transvaal gold-fields, especially at\r\nthe Wit-waters Rand (Johannesburg); and immigration on a large scale\r\nfrom all parts of the world had set in, and was constantly increasing\r\nwith vast amounts of investments in mercantile and other enterprises, as\r\nwell as in mining industries. At first, equitable laws governed burghers\r\nand Uitlanders alike, administered by an independent judiciary. All\r\ndesirable security was afforded for person and property, with confidence\r\nin the safety of investments, and great general prosperity kept pace\r\nwith ever-increasing activities and enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt was a great satisfaction to Uitlanders that the peace of 1881, and\r\nthe reinstatement of Transvaal independence, had restored harmony\r\nbetween Boer and English, and that a policy was being followed to\r\npreclude friction between the respective Governments. Those facts\r\nlargely stimulated investments and enhanced confidence. By 1887 the\r\nalien population had already exceeded 100,000, and the capital\r\ninvestments £200,000,000 sterling, and the desire so ardently\r\nentertained by the people of the land, for twenty years back, was\r\ngratified at last. The burghers shared in the prosperity to a very large\r\ndegree, and in lieu of former poverty, competence and wealth became the\r\nrule, and many of them became exceedingly rich. It was not unusual to\r\nhear Boers expressing undisguised gratitude, not merely for the natural\r\ngold deposits, but specially also that people had come to prospect and\r\nto invest capital, without which the wealth of the land would have\r\nremained unexploited and lain fallow. Harmony and cordiality were the\r\nproper outcome between foreigners and Boers. The influx of capital and\r\nof immigrants continued to increase, but not so the happy conditions.\r\nThese were gradually getting marred by a spirit of variance, no one\r\nseemed to know how. The study of this paper will reveal it. The variance\r\nbetween Boers and Uitlanders began to be specially discernible from 1887\r\nand had been increasing like a blight ever since. This was noticeably\r\ncoincident with the numerous arrivals of educated Hollanders employed\r\nfor the railways and the Government administration.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier period of the Transvaal Republic, one year's residence\r\nwas first held sufficient for acquiring full franchise or burgher rights\r\nand voting qualifications. The condition was successively raised to two,\r\nthree, and five years; but in 1890 laws were passed which required\r\nfourteen years' probation, with conditions which virtually brought the\r\nterm to twenty-one years, and even then left the acquisition of full\r\nfranchise to the caprice of field-cornets and higher officials.\r\nEnglishmen and their descendants were at one time totally and for ever\r\nexcluded and disqualified just merely because of their nationality\r\nwhilst Hollanders were admitted in very large numbers without having to\r\npass any probation at all or only comparatively short terms. The English\r\nlanguage became a target for hostility and as good as proscribed;\r\nimpracticable and ludicrous attempts even were made to exclude its use\r\nin Johannesburg, where hardly any Uitlander understood Dutch, whilst\r\nevery Boer official was well versed in English: market and auction sales\r\nwere to be conducted only in Dutch; bills of fare at hotels and\r\nrestaurants were also to be in full-fledged Dutch only--and all this, it\r\nmust be remembered, some years before the Jameson incursion took place.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary, which, according to the \"Grondwet\" (Constitution), was\r\nthe highest legal authority, was by one stroke of enactment rendered\r\nsubservient and subordinate to the First Volksraad. The then Chief\r\nJustice (Kotzee) was ignominiously deposed for honourably contending\r\nagainst the grave departure from right and justice in subverting the\r\nsacred prerogative due to the highest tribunal, which Boer and Uitlander\r\nalike relied upon for independent justice.\r\n\r\nA new system of education was next introduced which admitted only High\r\nDutch as the medium of instruction in public schools. As only Hollander\r\nchildren could benefit by such tuition, and whereas those of other\r\nimmigrants could not understand that language, the effect was that\r\nparents of English and other nationalities had to combine in\r\nestablishing private schools or else to employ private teachers at their\r\nown expense--whilst paying, in the way of taxation, for Hollander public\r\nschools as well. That oppressive system was subsequently somewhat\r\nmodified in a manner which admitted the English language as a medium for\r\na portion of the school hours, the proportion so accorded being larger\r\nin Johannesburg and other such wholly English-speaking centres than in\r\nother parts of the State; but the amelioration did not take place until\r\nafter much irritation and expense had been occasioned, nor did it meet\r\nthe case of hardship more than half-way. I may here place the remark\r\nthat the public educational department is conducted without stint of\r\nexpenditure in providing from Holland the amplest and best school\r\nequipments and highly salaried Dutch professors and teachers.\r\n\r\nIrritating class legislation began to be systematically resorted to, to\r\nthe prejudice of Uitlanders (the majority of whom, it will be borne in\r\nmind, were English), which painfully pointed to a fixed determination on\r\nthe part of the Boers to lord it over them as a totally inferior class,\r\nallowing them no representation, and to treat them, in fact, just as a\r\nconquered people placed under tribute and proper only to be dominated\r\nand exploited.\r\n\r\nBoers could walk or ride about armed to the teeth, whilst Uitlanders\r\nwere forbidden to possess arms under penalty of confiscation and other\r\npunishments (except sporting-guns under special permit). The like\r\nirritations became rampant by 1890 already.\r\n\r\nThe alien population were at first too much occupied with their\r\nprosperous vocations to combine in the way of protesting against such\r\nprevailing usage. The Press was, however, eventually employed, and the\r\nGovernment was approached with respectful petitions praying for redress\r\nof the most glaring causes of discontent; but those were invariably\r\neither disdainfully rejected or ignored, or, if some matter was\r\nrelieved, other more exasperating enactments were defiantly substituted.\r\nThey were cynically told that they had come to their (the Boer's)\r\ncountry unasked, and were at liberty, and in fact invited, to leave it\r\nif the laws did not please them. This was said, well knowing that to\r\nleave would involve too great sacrifices of homes and investments. The\r\nUitlanders could not, however, be brought to the belief that the\r\nGovernment of a conscientious people could persist in dealing with them\r\nas if a previous design had existed--first to inveigle them and their\r\ncapital into their midst, with the object of goading and despoiling them\r\nafterwards. The course of petitioning and respectful remonstrances was\r\ntherefore persevered in, but all to no purpose. Indignation and\r\nresentment were the natural result of those failures. There appeared no\r\nalternative but to submit or else to abandon all and leave the country.\r\n\r\nIt is true that numerous Uitlanders acquired competences, and some were\r\namassing fortunes, but such prizes were comparatively few. The majority\r\njust managed, with varying success, to reap a reasonable return for\r\ntheir outlays and energies, or only to live more or less comfortably.\r\nThe fashion of luxurious and unthrifty living, so prevalent among the\r\n\"_nouveaux riches_\" and the section who vied with them, impressed the\r\nBoers with the notion that all were getting rich, and that soon there\r\nwould be nothing left for them in the race. In their Hollander Press\r\nthey were reminded that the gold, in reality belonging to them, was\r\nrapidly being exhausted, and the wealth appropriated by aliens, whose\r\nhewers of wood and drawers of water they would finally become. All this\r\ngalled them to the heart, and the Government readily lent itself to\r\nproceedings intended to balance conditions in favour of their burghers,\r\nas the process was described. I will adduce a few instances. As is well\r\nknown, it is only burghers and some privileged Hollanders who are\r\nemployed in Government service, from President down to policeman. There\r\nare very few exceptions to this rule, which also applies to the\r\nnominations of jurymen, who are well paid too. The salaries of all,\r\nespecially in the higher grades, had been largely augmented; the\r\nPresident receiving £8,000 per year, and so on downwards.\r\n\r\nFor Government supplies and public works the tenders of burghers only,\r\nand perhaps of some privileged persons, are accepted. In many instances\r\nthe tenderers are without any pretence of ability for the performance of\r\nthe contract, but are nevertheless accepted, performing only a _sub rosa\r\nrôle_. One such instance occurred some years ago when a burgher who did\r\nnot possess £100--a simple farmer and a kind of \"slim\"\r\nspeculator--received by Volksraad vote the contract for building a\r\ncertain railway.[3] The price included a very large margin to be\r\ndistributed in places of interest--as douceurs of £1,000 to £5,000 each,\r\nand £10,000 for the _pro forma_ contractor and his Volksraad\r\nconfederates; all those sums were paid out by the firm for whom the\r\ncontract was actually taken up.\r\n\r\nSimilarly in contracts for road making, repairing, and making streets,\r\netc., etc. On one occasion a rather highly placed official obtained a\r\ncontract for repairing certain streets in Pretoria for £60,000. The work\r\nbeing worth £20,000 at most, the difference went to be shared by the\r\nseveral official participants.\r\n\r\nOne of the first instances of glaring peculation occurred about fifteen\r\nyears ago in relation with the Selati railway contract obtained by Baron\r\nOppenheim.[4] The procedure was publicly stigmatized as bribery. It had\r\ntranspired that nearly all the Volksraad's members had received gifts in\r\ncash and values ranging each from £50 to £1,000 prior to voting the\r\ncontract, but what was paid after voting did not become public at the\r\ntime of exposure.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance of those gifts was ultimately admitted, in the face of\r\nevidence adduced in a certain law case; denial became, in fact,\r\nimpossible. The plea of exoneration was that those gifts had been freely\r\naccepted without pledging the vote. The President publicly exculpated\r\nthe honourable members, expressing his conviction that none of them\r\ncould have meant to prejudice the State in their votes for the contract;\r\nand as there had been no pledge on their part, the donor had actually\r\nincurred the risk of missing his object. From that time the practice of\r\nobtaining and selling concessions or of sinecures and other lucrative\r\nadvantages grew quite into a trade; and receiving douceurs became a\r\nhankering passion from highest to lowest, but happily with not a few\r\nexceptions where the official's honour was above being priced.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing shocking in all this venality to the bulk of the\r\nJohannesburg speculator class and others of that category. The rest\r\nassessed official morality at a depreciated value, but hoped the\r\nblemishes might be purged out with other and graver causes for\r\ndiscontent, if Uitlanders, were only granted some effective\r\nrepresentation in public matters. That appeared to be the only\r\nconstitutional remedy. But this continued to be resentfully refused,\r\neven in matters which partook of purely domestic interest, such as\r\neducation, municipal privileges, etc. The latter were opposed upon the\r\nspecious argument that such extended rights would constitute an\r\n_imperium in imperio,_ and thus a condition incompatible with the safety\r\nand the conservation of complete control.\r\n\r\nIn the usual intercourse with burghers and officials a great deal of\r\nexasperating and even humiliating experiences had often to be endured,\r\nUitlanders being treated as an inferior class, with scarcely veiled and\r\noften with arrogant assumption of superiority.\r\n\r\nI witnessed a field cornet enjoying free and courteous hospitality at a\r\nUitlander's house, while being entertained by his host and others in the\r\nvernacular Dutch, peremptorily object to the conversation in English in\r\nwhich the lady of the house happened to be engaged with another guest at\r\nthe further end of the table. His remark was to the effect \"that he\r\ncould not tolerate English being spoken within his hearing\"; this was in\r\nabout 1888.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that under such conditions and ungenial usage Englishmen and\r\nother Uitlanders were put in a resentful mood, and many of them\r\nbethought themselves of methods other than constitutional to improve\r\ntheir position.\r\n\r\nIdentification was resorted to with the Imperial League, a political\r\norganization called into being in the Cape Colony to stem Boer\r\nassertiveness there and to restrain Bond aspirations. It was also\r\nseriously mooted to obtain the good offices of Great Britain as an\r\ninfluence for intervention and remonstrance.\r\n\r\nIt was not that the Transvaal Government was unaware of its duty and\r\nresponsibility to remove causes which produced discontent and resentment\r\namong by far the larger section of the people under its rule. It seemed\r\nrather that the Uitlanders were provoked with systematic intention.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Berne award has, as is well known, since been given.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The Ermelo-Machadodorp branch.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: These very details were since made public in the Belgian\r\nLaw courts in the recent _cause célèbre_ of \"The Government of the South\r\nAfrican Republic _versus_ Baron Oppenheim.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONSTER PETITION--JAMESON INCURSION--ARMAMENTS\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage in May, 1894, that a monster petition with some\r\n25,000 signatures was presented to the Volksraad, setting forth the\r\nentire position, and praying for a commission to be appointed to examine\r\nthe merits of the Uitlander complaints, and to frame a programme of\r\nreforms, the interests of the mining community needing such in a most\r\nurgent degree, not only for the sake of its own prosperity, but for the\r\nwelfare of the entire State. A commission was indeed appointed, who\r\nreported in favour of the petitioners, and suggested a series of\r\nreforms; but the final Volksraad vote resulted in an angry rejection of\r\nthe petition and denunciation of its organizers.\r\n\r\nAs on the occasion of previous memorials, some few abuses were\r\nredressed, but those benefits were made worse than nugatory by\r\nenactments in other directions of a still more galling nature. The\r\npetitioners found themselves snubbed and in the position of humiliating\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment of Coloured British Subjects\r\n\r\nA glaring instance of oppression practised by the Transvaal Government\r\nwas its cruel treatment of coloured British subjects who had been\r\nadmitted into the State. Among these figured some thousands of educated\r\nAsiatic traders, including numerous cultured Indian and Parsee merchants\r\nwith large stakes in the State and well-appointed residences, people\r\nwhose very religion exacted the most scrupulous cleanliness and who had\r\nall proved themselves obedient and law-abiding. These were classed under\r\none rubric with the vastly inferior coolie labourer, with Kaffirs and\r\nHottentots, and actually compelled to abandon their stores and\r\nresidences to reside in one common ghetto upon the outskirts of the\r\ntowns, a measure which entailed great losses apart from the gratuitous\r\nhumiliation--to many it involved ruin and in fact meant their expulsion.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that some years before already the English\r\nGovernment had felt it incumbent to advocate the cause of coloured\r\nBritish subjects and to remonstrate against their ill-usage. The matter\r\nwas ultimately submitted to arbitration at Bloemfontein, under the\r\numpireship of Sir Henry de Villiers, whose award, contrary to\r\nexpectation, was adverse to the coloured people. Here was indeed a\r\nunique occasion for the Transvaal Government to exercise geniality upon\r\na point sorely felt by the British Government; but the very contrary\r\ncourse was adopted under the ægis of that notorious award, and upon the\r\nuntenable plea that sanitation and regard to public health necessitated\r\nthat measure of segregation.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that no royalty was yet exacted upon the gold output,\r\nprobably to please French, American, and German investors, there seemed\r\nto exist a veiled hostility against the representatives of mining\r\ncapitalists, as if the Government regretted to have allowed the\r\nexploitation of the mines to fall into private hands and would welcome\r\nan opportunity to take them under State control altogether.\r\n\r\nThe Uitlander Press vented public sentiment and denounced the Government\r\nattitude in unmistakable terms; there were besides some angry public\r\ndemonstrations. It was an alarming time of impending crisis, rife with\r\nsigns of open revolt; the Government looking calmly on awaiting\r\ndevelopments. It was then that the President's since famous saying was\r\npronounced, viz., \"that the tortoise must first be allowed to put out\r\nits head before it could be struck off, and that he was ready for any\r\nemergency.\"\r\n\r\nThe situation had a truly anomalous aspect. More discoveries of gold and\r\neven of diamonds followed apace, and the scope for mining, commercial\r\nand industrial enterprises expanded to an incalculable magnitude. All\r\nthat was needed was a stable and good Government to encourage the\r\nneedful investments. A most tantalizing picture indeed, based upon\r\nundeniably well-grounded facts.\r\n\r\nAs it was, the situation was one of alarm for capital already\r\ninvested--a stake then of over 300 millions sterling in a country where\r\nmore than half of the population were in almost open revolt against a\r\nGovernment commanding very large repressive forces, and resolved to\r\nmaintain its stand.\r\n\r\nBritish intervention appeared to be the only means of salvation to\r\nrestore security, and to give a fillip to the brilliant prospects of the\r\ncountry, for the good of the burgher estate as well as for the sake of\r\nUitlanders.\r\n\r\nAs the Government continued deaf and obdurate to representations, other\r\nmeans were sought for. No wonder the Uitlanders longed for a change,\r\nnot by any means with the object of altering the style of Republican\r\nstatus, but to get the Augean stable of misgovernment cleansed, to\r\nescape oppressive and rapacious Boer domination.\r\n\r\nThe farcical failure of Dr. Jameson was the outcome of those endeavours.\r\nThe unspeakable cowardice of his Johannesburg confederates was the chief\r\nfeature of that puny attempt. Laurels, like those gained by Lord\r\nPeterborough, Warren Hastings, or Lord Clive, were not decreed to that\r\nill-advised emulator.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more propitious than that very Jameson incursion\r\nto fan race hatred and to advance the projects of the Afrikaner\r\nBond--\"Afrika voor de Afrikaners,\" for, whilst no one acquainted with\r\nthe facts can for a moment doubt the guilt of the Transvaal Government\r\nfor having systematically provoked that attempt at revolution, \"Bond\"\r\npropaganda and paid journalism had a rare chance to set up the theory\r\nthat annexation on behalf of Great Britain had been foully planned--the\r\nPrince of Wales even being an abettor of the attempted _coup d'état_\r\npurely to gratify the lust of greed for the gold and diamonds of the\r\npoor innocent Boers. No terms were too vituperative to denounce the\r\nenormity. Millions of honest persons all over the world were\r\ndeluded--there was a bitter cry of almost universal indignation. The\r\nBoer Government posed as innocent; the designs of the Afrikaner Bond\r\nwere not even suspected--its ranks, in sympathy with those delusions\r\nsped on filling up faster than ever, and the father of lies was scoring\r\nanother very sensible triumph.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of reforms, Bond projects and armaments were secretly pursued\r\nwith redoubled vigour towards the climax which should install\r\nAfrikanerdom supreme in South Africa, financially as well as\r\npolitically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOEMFONTEIN FRANCHISE CONFERENCE--BOER ULTIMATUM\r\n\r\nCapitalists had already begun to feel nervous about the final security\r\nof their investments; operations and credit became restricted, fresh\r\nprojects were abandoned and a persistent withdrawal of capital set in.\r\nTrade and prosperity were progressively waning, accompanied with still\r\nmore ominous portents for the Uitlanders' future. It all meant a very\r\nextensive weeding out of investments under enormous losses, except such\r\nas stood in relation with dividend-paying mines. England, though\r\napparently apathetic and inactive, was not inattentive to the situation.\r\nWhoever had a stake, whether in South Africa or abroad, looked to Great\r\nBritain as the Power upon whom the duty devolved to provide a peaceable\r\nremedy. The suzerainty controversy was then followed by other questions\r\nof diplomatic difference, among which that of the franchise reform.\r\nUpon this matter English intervention took an insistent form. It clearly\r\nturned all upon that--and once it were satisfactorily arranged, the\r\namicable solution of other questions might in turn be expected to\r\nfollow. As to suzerainty, that claim appeared relegated to remain in\r\nabeyance. A conference was convened at Bloemfontein early in June, 1899,\r\nfor the discussion of those topics between the Colonial Governor, Sir\r\nAlfred Milner, and the Presidents of the two Republics. The outcome was\r\na final demand for the right of representation of the Uitlander\r\ninterests in the legislative bodies of the Transvaal, amounting to\r\none-fifth of the total aggregate of members, the voting qualifications\r\nto consist in the usual reasonable conditions and a residence in the\r\nState of five years, operating retrospectively.\r\n\r\nWe may here consider whether such a demand contained any real feature of\r\nunfairness to warrant refusal.\r\n\r\nThree-fifths of the entire white Transvaal population were Uitlanders,\r\nthe majority of them English. They own four-fifths of the total wealth\r\ninvested in the State. About half of them have been domiciled, with\r\nhouse and other fixed property, for periods of from five to ten years\r\nand more.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance is not only in numbers and wealth, but also in\r\nintelligence and in contributing at least four-fifths of the total State\r\nrevenues.\r\n\r\nIs it right or prudent to exclude such interests and such a majority\r\nfrom legislative representation?\r\n\r\nCould a minority of one-fifth, that is to say, twelve Uitlander members\r\nagainst forty-eight Boer members, be said to constitute a menace to the\r\nstatus or to the conservative interests of State?\r\n\r\nDo Uitlanders not deserve equal recognition with the burghers in respect\r\nto intrinsic interest in the land, seeing that the former supplied all\r\nthe skill and the capital to explore and exploit the mine wealth, all at\r\ntheir risk, and without which it would all have remained hidden and the\r\ncountry continued fallow and poor?\r\n\r\nThough one-fifth would be so small a minority, it would at least have\r\nafforded the constitutional method of declaring the wishes of\r\nUitlanders, and have done away with the disquieting and less effective\r\npractices of Press agitations, public demonstrations, and petitions. The\r\nmeasure could also have been expected to open up the way towards\r\nreconciling relations between the English and Boer races, beginning in\r\nthe Transvaal, where it was hoped that the burghers would be gained over\r\nas friends, and so to stand aloof from the Afrikaner Bond. These were\r\nthe supreme objects for peaceful progress and not for annexation. Solemn\r\nassurances from highest quarters were repeatedly given that no designs\r\nexisted against the integrity of the Republic, that nothing unfriendly\r\nlurked behind the franchise demand, but that necessity dictated it for\r\ngeneral good and the preservation of peace. Nor were other diplomatic\r\nmeans left unemployed to ensure the acceptance of the franchise reform.\r\nIn addition to firmness of attitude and a display of actual force, most\r\nof the other Powers, including the United States of America, were\r\ninduced to add their weight of persuasion in urging upon the Transvaal\r\nthe adoption of the measures demanded by England for correcting the\r\nexisting trouble. It may be urged that the display of force in sending\r\nthe first batches of troops would have afforded grounds for\r\nexasperation, and be construed by the Transvaal as a menace and actual\r\nhostility, tending to precipitate a conflict which it was so earnestly\r\nintended to avoid. To this may be replied that the 20,000 men sent in\r\nAugust were readily viewed as placing the hitherto undermanned Colonial\r\ngarrisons upon an appropriate peace effective only; but not so with\r\nrespect to the army corps of 50,000 men despatched in September--this\r\nwas felt as an intended restraint against \"Bond\" projects, to enforce\r\nthe observance of any agreement which the Transvaal might for the nonce\r\nassent to, and above all it was tending, unless at once opposed by the\r\nBond, to weaken its ranks by producing hesitation and ultimate defection\r\nfrom that body; the die was thus to be cast, duplicity appeared to be\r\nplayed out--the ultimatum of 9th October was the outcome; and England,\r\nthough unprepared, could not possibly accept it otherwise than as a\r\nwilful challenge to war.\r\n\r\nAs the pursuit of our study will show, the success of Mr. Chamberlain's\r\ndiplomacy to avert war depended upon the very slender prospects that the\r\nTransvaal Government might have been induced to waver, and finally to\r\nbreak with the Afrikaner Bond--a forlorn hope indeed, considering the\r\nperfection which that formidable organization had reached. Its cherished\r\nobjects were not meant to be abandoned. The advice of \"Bond\" leaders\r\nprevailed. War was declared and the Rubicon crossed in enthusiastic\r\nexpectations of soon realizing the long-deferred Bond motto: \"The\r\nexpulsion of the hateful English.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true the Transvaal had made a show of acquiescence to British and\r\nforeign pressure. This first took the shape of an offer of a seven\r\nyears' franchise, and then one of five years, exceeding even Mr.\r\nMilner's demands as to the number of Uitlander representation. That of\r\nseven years was so fenced in with nugatory trammels and conditions that\r\nit had for those reasons to be rejected; whilst that at five years was\r\ncoupled with the equally unacceptable conditions that the claim of\r\nsuzerainty should be renounced, and that in all other respects the\r\nTransvaal should be recognised as absolutely independent in terms of the\r\nSand River Convention of 1852.\r\n\r\nThose offers could hardly have been made in sincerity, but rather as a\r\ntemporary device and to meet the susceptibilities of the advising\r\nPowers, for all the time preparations for war were never relaxed for a\r\nmoment, but were pushed on with extreme vigour. On the other hand, the\r\nBritish programme seeking to ensure peace by the franchise expedient had\r\nbeen strictly followed without deviation. When the Transvaal Government\r\nprofessed irritation over the disposition of some British troops too\r\nnear the Transvaal border, they were promptly removed to more remote and\r\nless strategic positions, rather than incur the risk of rupture. During\r\nthe month preceding the outbreak of the war, some large continental\r\nconsignments of war munitions were, as usual, permitted to reach the\r\nRepublics unhindered through several Colonial ports, portions being\r\nactually smuggled over the Colonial railways as merchandise addressed to\r\na well-known Pretoria firm, but on arrival were secretly delivered,\r\nunder cover of night, at the various forts and arsenals. These\r\nproceedings were carried out with the connivance of the Colonial Bond\r\nauthorities, and though known to the British Governor, it was all winked\r\nat rather than hazard the momentous objects of peace by the introduction\r\nof another knotty subject. To sum up the situation, it was a diplomatic\r\ncontest on the part of Great Britain aiming at peace and to safeguard\r\nher possessions and prestige, while the Afrikaner Bond, on the other\r\npart, continued active in the work of sedition and preparing for a war\r\nof usurpation. Every one must admit that the demand of the British\r\nMinistry for an immediate and adequate representation proceeded from the\r\nnecessity and the desire to overcome the South African crisis in a just\r\nand pacific way. The measure was counted upon to effect conciliation\r\nbetween the Uitlander and burgher elements, and as a further result was\r\nearnestly hoped to bring about the secession of the Transvaal from the\r\nAfrikaner Bond, and so reduce that dangerous confederacy to a somewhat\r\nnegligible impotence. To discover other objects of a sinister sort\r\nlurking behind needs a more than inventive genius. A united Afrikaner\r\nBond, persistent to carry out its fell project, definitely meant war\r\nsooner or later. Its first step in launching out to it was that\r\nnotorious ultimatum, which was tantamount to snatching back the feigned\r\noffers of the seven and five years' franchise. According to original\r\nprogramme, the very next step to accomplish the _coup d'état_ was the\r\nimmediate seizure of all Colonial ports, and to complete a general and\r\nirrevocable Boer rising all over the Colonies.\r\n\r\nAll the while the old device had been put into practice of hiding Bond\r\nguilt by accusing England of designs against the integrity of the Boer\r\nRepublics. But directly after, in the exultation of victorious\r\ninvasions, the mask was shamelessly dropped, and Boerdom stands out\r\ndefiantly and nakedly self-confessed, aiming at conquest and supremacy\r\nover all South Africa. Will the ensuing century have in store an\r\ninstance to match that record plot of artifice and dissimulation, and\r\nsee half the world duped into partisanship with it--by journalistic\r\ncraft?\r\n\r\nIt may well be imagined that Mr. Chamberlain and his noble colleagues\r\nhad anything but beds of roses whilst pursuing the diplomacy adopted to\r\ncheckmate the Bond. They had to gain national support without divulging\r\ntheir own proceeding, and were at the same time reduced to a situation\r\nwhich imposed a spartan fortitude in concealing and repressing\r\ninvoluntary perturbation in the presence of an impending national\r\ncrisis, and also the stoical endurance of bitter recriminations on the\r\npart of an opposition comprising a large and honourable but poorly\r\ninformed section of the English nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOER LANGUAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to the topic of language, which will be found relevant,\r\nshowing Hollander and Bond influence in using that also as a hostile\r\nweapon. What the Boers still speak is a vernacular or dialect so far\r\nremoved from High Dutch as to be unintelligible to the uninitiated\r\nHollander. It took its form from the dialects brought to the Cape of\r\nGood Hope by unlettered Dutch colonists and a large admixture of locally\r\nproduced idioms, with a slight trace of the structure of the French\r\nlanguage in expressing negations. In the two Republics High Dutch rules\r\nfor official purposes, but in common intercourse the vernacular Dutch is\r\nstill about the same as it had been a hundred years ago. For an\r\nEnglish-Dutch interpreter the thorough knowledge of the vernacular is\r\nessential. Preachers and teachers have to adapt their speech by\r\ncombining High Dutch with the dialect, the one or the other\r\npredominating according to the capacity of the hearers. Hollanders\r\nfollow the same method when learning the vernacular Dutch.\r\n\r\nIn towns and villages, not only in the Colonies, but also in both\r\nRepublics, English is almost exclusively used. The Boers, and especially\r\nthe younger generation, have a much greater aptitude and penchant for\r\nlearning English than for High Dutch; and generally it has been held\r\nmore important by the parents that their children should become\r\nproficient in English, that language being more easily acquired and of\r\nvastly greater use than Dutch. The latter, it was truly averred, would\r\nbe learnt as they grew up quite sufficiently for all purposes.\r\n\r\nThe feeling thus existed some twenty years ago that English would become\r\ngeneral, and ultimately oust both Dutch and the vernacular. Numerous\r\nBoer patriots then devised the remedy of preserving the vernacular by\r\nraising it to the standard of a written and printed language for\r\nofficial as well as common use. The Rev. du Toit, later appointed\r\nMinister (or Superintendent) of Education in the Transvaal, worked\r\ntenaciously towards making that movement a national success. He had the\r\nco-operation of many other educated patriots likewise. The _Paarl\r\nPatriot_, a journal published in the vernacular, is one of the\r\nsurviving efforts. Vocabularies, school books, etc., etc., were printed\r\nin that dialect, and the translation of the Bible had also been brought\r\nto an advanced stage, when the project had to be abandoned, principally\r\nthrough Hollander influence, aided by some of the Republican leaders and\r\nBond men. Dr. Mansfeld, the present Superintendent of Education in the\r\nTransvaal, was subsequently appointed--a very able Hollander, but also a\r\nvery strong advocate in the general Hollander Bond movement for\r\nproscribing the use of the English language, and making High Dutch the\r\ncompulsory medium of instruction. Since then, and during the past ten\r\nyears, considerable progress has been made by the average Boer children,\r\nand even the grown-up people, in approaching a better knowledge of High\r\nDutch. Before 1880 hardly any Boer cared to read a newspaper except,\r\nperhaps, the _Paarl Patriot_, the vernacular journal referred to. High\r\nDutch and English papers were equally beyond his ready knowledge, but\r\nsince then the interest in politics gave an impulse to a reading\r\ntendency, and at this moment the majority of the Boers manage to read\r\nand understand fairly well what is presented in simply written High\r\nDutch by the local Press. They also are fond of simply written books of\r\ntravels, and especially of narratives of a religious trend. With the\r\nBible they are most familiar from childhood, but literature in High\r\nDutch is beyond them as yet. Greater pains have of late years been taken\r\nto qualify Boer sons for the administrative service of the Republics,\r\nwhere imperfect knowledge of High Dutch is an obvious bar to\r\nadvancement, and Hollanders would otherwise continue to monopolize the\r\nbetter positions.\r\n\r\nTaking the fairly educated Free State and Transvaal youth, the average\r\nproficiency in English compared to that in High Dutch is as two to one,\r\nwhilst many possess even a literary mastery in English whilst quite poor\r\nin the other language.\r\n\r\nIn the Cape Colony the above comparison among the Boer section is still\r\nmore in favour of English.\r\n\r\nIt may be judged what an important _rôle_ the educated Hollander group\r\ncan take in those Republics, and are yet aiming at in the Colonies.\r\n\r\nIt is also worthy of reflection why and how the Dutch language has been\r\nraised to equality with English in the Cape Colony, seeing English was\r\nmore generally understood by the Boers there than High Dutch, and none\r\nof the Boer legislators or members of Parliament even now know more\r\nthan the Dutch vernacular, the High Dutch language having actually yet\r\nto be learnt by the Boer population--an important step thus gained by\r\nAfrikanerdom under the indulgent ægis of self-government, the thin end\r\nof another wedge to nurse sedition and treason introduced by that odious\r\nBond under pretence and veil of Boer patriotism and loyalty.\r\n\r\nAs one of the world's languages, Dutch figures under a very sorry _rôle_\r\nindeed. It had been ignored everywhere outside of Holland and her\r\ndistant Colonies. The consequence to Hollanders is that they are of\r\nnecessity subjected to the ordeal of learning several other continental\r\nlanguages for commercial intercourse, and in order to keep at all\r\nabreast with the progress of science, literature, and culture. Dutch is\r\nin the moribund stage; its salvation from imminent extinction consists\r\nin the expansion of its sphere. Boer successes in South Africa would\r\njust accomplish that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUTCH COTERIE: ITS SEAT IN HOLLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has been shown, the conditions of the two Boer Republics, with High\r\nDutch as the official language, lent themselves to favour the\r\nimmigration into those States of educated Dutchmen (Hollanders, as they\r\nare styled, to distinguish them from the old-established Boer Dutchmen).\r\nThese were indeed indispensable, as none of the Boers possessed the\r\ncompetence in High Dutch requisite for the conduct of the more important\r\nportion of the clerical work in the administration. The professional\r\nbranches were recruited from Holland likewise, in natural sequence. They\r\nwere men of high attainments and possessed of energy and astuteness and\r\nof various qualifications--doctors, lawyers, editors, clergymen,\r\nteachers. Those who did not receive Government appointments quickly\r\nfound lucrative positions in their vocations. The scope increased as\r\ntime went by and as those States developed with the growth of the\r\npopulations and the establishment of numerous towns and villages,\r\nespecially after the discovery of the diamond-fields in 1870. Every year\r\nbrought fresh contingents from Holland, including also the commercial\r\nclass, artisans, and even servants of both sexes, and agriculturists.\r\nPreserving a constant intercourse with their native country, those\r\nHollanders also maintained cohesion and clanship among themselves in\r\ntheir newly-adopted homes. Nor did Holland fail to realize the great\r\nadvantages accruing to that country and its people from the new South\r\nAfrican outlets--regular preserves with almost unlimited scope for\r\nfurther extension and for increasing permanent, profitable connections.\r\nA formidable barrier presented itself in the gradually ascendant\r\ntendencies of the English language and English trade, with corresponding\r\nneglect of the Dutch factors. Regretful forebodings aroused energetic\r\nefforts to check rival interests. The prize was too valuable, and\r\nincreasing each year in importance. A dyke needed to be erected to stem\r\nthe English encroachments and to preserve and consolidate the Hollander\r\nposition of vantage. The ablest men in Holland and South Africa\r\nexercised themselves with that task with an ardour impelled by jealous\r\nhatred against the English and intensified by successive revelations of\r\nmore startling discoveries of gold and other mineral wealth in the\r\nTransvaal. It was then, about thirty years ago, that a well-informed,\r\ninfluential and unscrupulous coterie in Holland devised the fell\r\nprojects which developed into that potential association since known as\r\nthe Afrikaner Bond.\r\n\r\nThe building of the Transvaal railway lines brought other large\r\naccessions of educated Hollanders, and as they were completed some\r\nthousands more were added to serve as permanent staff. Dutch influence\r\nwas thus attaining strength to assert and consolidate its interests with\r\nan expanding impulse. The monopolized railway company promoted\r\nimmigration from Holland by largely increasing the salaries to such of\r\nthe staff who were married. The Transvaal Government, under the advice\r\nof their educational chief, Dr. Mansfeld, provided similar premiums to\r\nsecure married teachers from Holland and by raising the salaries of\r\nmarried Hollander officials already placed. The Hollander population\r\nattracted to the Transvaal since 1850, and which did not number above\r\n500 in 1870, had increased by 1898 to fully 12,000, representing, as\r\nranged with the Boers, by far the largest factor of educated\r\nintelligence, attached to and dependent upon the Government and its\r\nstaunch allies. The men received full burghership as a rule soon after\r\narrival, exempt from the formalities and probation prescribed by law.\r\n\r\nHolland being the locality of the inception, I may say the ingestion, of\r\nthe Afrikaner Bond, one's thoughts are apt to retrace, by way of\r\ncontrast, that little nation's creditable past. The view presents those\r\ndykes, monuments of labour's heroism; then that glorious resistance\r\nagainst the mighty persecutor of religion, those unsurpassed\r\nperformances in the arena of culture, arts, and sciences, and that long\r\nepoch of success in exploits of colonization, finance, and commerce.\r\n\r\n    \"But view them closer, craft and fraud appear;\r\n    Even liberty itself is bartered here.\"--_Goldsmith_.[5]\r\n\r\nOne notes the placid landscapes intersected by those still but\r\ndeep-flowing rivers and canals, scenes so conducive to mental\r\nexercise--the Dutch patriot mourning over the transition of former\r\nnational prestige to present condition of decadence presaging complete\r\nnational submersion, but at the same time courageously employing his\r\nfertile brain in devising far-reaching projects of remedy over distant\r\nperspectives so as to stem that tide of decadence and declension and to\r\nerect a firm barrier against that menace--to gain (by inspiration from\r\nthe titular genius of commerce and craft so conspicuous in that famed\r\nart representation[6] exhibited in his Bourse) a dazzling prize for his\r\nnation by one fell swoop and, so to say, with folded arms, just by\r\npitting against the English his almost forgotten and long-neglected\r\nclan, the Boer nation, inciting them to usurp Great Britain in South\r\nAfrica, Holland sharing the spoils. See here the master mind exulting in\r\nthe conception, gestation, and birth of the Afrikaner Bond conspiracy;\r\nnote the Hollander patriot's glitter of satisfaction at the vista of\r\nrealizing the restoration of Holland to a position excelling its former\r\nglory, of a moribund language revived to significance, and of witnessing\r\nbesides a sweet vendetta operated upon England, the old enemy and\r\ndespoiler of his nation, to compass the humiliation and disintegration\r\nof the British Empire. Patience, dear reader; preserve judicial\r\ncomposure. Evidence is following on the heels of the charge.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: This is of course not directed against the nation as a\r\nwhole.

President Brand and some\r\nothers then already suspected more, as the following incident will show.\r\nIn 1883 President Brand officially opened the new wagon-road bridge over\r\nthe Caledon River at Commissie drift, near Smithfield, Orange Free\r\nState. Towards the conclusion of the ceremony, one of the other\r\nspeakers, Mr. Advocate Peeters, member of the Volksraad for Smithfield\r\ndistrict, in the course of his speech formally suggested that President\r\nBrand should accept the leadership of the Orange Free State section of\r\nthe Afrikaner Bond. The President, addressing the burghers and all\r\npresent, replied in about the following terms: The proposal just then\r\nmade by Advocate Peeters had pained and offended him; the festive event\r\nwould be marred by that incident were it not that it afforded him the\r\nopportunity, which he otherwise would have missed, of telling them all\r\nwhat he thought of the Afrikaner Bond--that it was an evil thing; he\r\ncould not find terms strong enough to warn the people against its subtle\r\nseductions. The Afrikaner Bond professed its objects to be peace and\r\nharmony, but it really contained the pernicious seeds of division and\r\nstrife, to set up enmity between English Afrikaners and Boer Afrikaners.\r\nHe pointed out the sincerity of friendly relations on the part of\r\nEngland towards both the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republics.\r\nThe peace which restored to the Transvaal its independence a few years\r\nbefore was one big proof; his Government had many proofs of England's\r\ngood will, too. It suited both parties to maintain harmony--it behoved\r\nevery Afrikaner to be one-minded in friendly reciprocation. Through a\r\ngracious Providence both Republics were prosperous and enjoyed\r\nindependence. All over the world the prosperity of States depended upon\r\ngood relations with their neighbours--this was especially so as regards\r\nthe Orange Free State. They knew what kind of bond the Bible enjoined.\r\nIt was the bond of peace and concord; and he concluded by declaring his\r\nwell-grounded fears that the Afrikaner Bond was a device of the devil\r\ndirected against the well-being of the entire Afrikaner nation. Instead\r\nof being encouraged, it should, like the \"Boete Bosch\"[7] (_Xanthium\r\nspinosum_, burr weed), be extirpated from the soil of South Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDA OF BOND PROGRAMME, EMANATING FROM HOLLAND (TRANSLATION FROM\r\nGLEANINGS).\r\n\r\nThe Afrikaner Bond has as final object what is summed up in its motto of\r\n\"Afrika voor de Afrikaners.\"[8] The whole of South Africa belongs by\r\njust right to the Afrikaner nation. It is the privilege and duty of\r\nevery Afrikaner to contribute all in his power towards the expulsion of\r\nthe English usurper. The States of South Africa to be federated in one\r\nindependent Republic.\r\n\r\nThe Afrikaner Bond prepares for this consummation.\r\n\r\nArgument in justification:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) The transfer of the Cape Colony to the British Government took\r\nplace by circumstances of _force majeure_ and without the consent of the\r\nDutch nation, who renounce all claim in favour of the Afrikaner or Boer\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Natal is territory which accrued to a contingent of the Boer\r\nnation by purchase from the Zulu King, who received the consideration\r\nagreed for.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The British authorities expelled the rightful owners from Natal by\r\nforce of arms without just cause.\r\n\r\nThe task of the Afrikaner Bond consists in:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) Procuring the staunch adhesion and co-operation of every Afrikaner\r\nand other real friend of the cause.\r\n\r\n(_b_) To obtain the sympathy, the moral and effective aid of one or more\r\nof the world's Powers.\r\n\r\nThe means to accomplish those tasks are:--\r\n\r\nPersonal persuasion, Press propaganda, legislation and diplomacy.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the application of those means is entrusted to a select\r\nbody of members eligible for their loyalty to the cause and their\r\nabilities and position. That body will conduct such measures as need the\r\nobservance of special secrecy. Upon the rest of the members will\r\ndevolve activities of a general character under the direction of the\r\nselected chiefs.\r\n\r\nOne of the indispensable requisites is the proper organization of an\r\neffective fund, which is to be regularly sustained. Bond members will\r\naid each other in all relations of public life in preference to\r\nnon-members.\r\n\r\nIn the efforts of gaining adherents to the cause it is of importance to\r\ndistinguish three categories of persons--\r\n\r\n(1) The class of Afrikaners who are to some extent deteriorated by\r\nassimilative influences with the English race, whose restoration to\r\npatriotism will need great efforts, discretion, and patience.\r\n\r\n(2)The apparently unthinking and apathetic class, who prefer to relegate\r\nall initiative to leaders whom they will loyally follow. This class is\r\nthe most numerous by far.\r\n\r\n(3) The warmly patriotic class, including men gifted with intelligence,\r\nenergy, and speech, qualified as leaders and apt to exercise influence\r\nover the rest.\r\n\r\nAmong those three classes many exist whose views and religious scruples\r\nneed to be corrected. Scripture abounds in proofs and salient analogies\r\napplying to the situation and justifying our cause. In this, as well as\r\nin other directions, the members who work in circulating written\r\npropaganda will supply the correct and conclusive arguments accessible\r\nto all.\r\n\r\nUpon the basis of our just rights, the British Government, if not the\r\nentire nation, is the usurping enemy of the Boer nation.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with an enemy it is justifiable to employ, besides force,\r\nalso means of a less open character, such as diplomacy and stratagem.\r\n\r\nThe greatest danger to Afrikanerdom is the English policy of Anglicizing\r\nthe Boer nation--to submerge it by the process of assimilation.\r\n\r\nA distinct attitude of holding aloof from English influences is the only\r\nremedy against that peril and for thwarting that insidious policy.\r\n\r\nIt is only such an attitude that will preserve the nation in its simple\r\nfaith and habits of morality, and provide safety against the dangers of\r\ncontamination and pernicious examples, with all their fateful\r\nconsequences to body and soul.\r\n\r\nLet the Dutch language have the place of honour in schools and homes.\r\n\r\nLet alliances of marriage with the English be stamped as unpatriotic.[9]\r\n\r\nLet every Afrikaner see that he is at all times well armed with the\r\nbest possible weapons, and maintains the expert use of the rifle among\r\nyoung and old, so as to be ready when duty calls and the time is ripe\r\nfor asserting the nation's rights and be rid of English thraldom.\r\n\r\nEmploy teachers only who are animated with truly patriotic sentiments.\r\n\r\nLet it be well understood that English domination will also bring\r\nreligious intolerance and servitude, for it is only a very frail link\r\nwhich separates the English State Church from actual Romanism, and its\r\nproselytism _en bloc_ is only a matter of short time.\r\n\r\nEqually repugnant and dangerous is England's policy towards the coloured\r\nraces, whom she aims, for the sake of industrial profit, at elevating to\r\nequal rank with whites, in direct conflict with scriptural authority--a\r\npolicy which incites coloured people to rivalry with their superiors,\r\nand can only end in common disaster.\r\n\r\nWhilst remaining absolutely independent, the ties of blood relationship\r\nand language point to Holland for a domestic base.\r\n\r\nAs to commerce, Germany, America, and other industrial nations could\r\nmore than fill the gap left by England, and such connections should be\r\ncultivated as a potent means towards obtaining foreign support to our\r\ncause and identification with it.\r\n\r\nIf the mineral wealth of the Transvaal and Orange Free State becomes\r\nestablished--as appears certain from discoveries already made--England\r\nwill not rest until those are also hers.\r\n\r\nThe leopard will retain its spots. The independence of both Republics is\r\nat stake on that account alone, with the risk that the rightful owners\r\nof the land will become the hewers of wood and drawers of water for the\r\nusurpers.\r\n\r\nThere is no alternative hope for the peace and progress of South Africa\r\nexcept by the total excision of the British ulcer.\r\n\r\nReliable signs are not wanting to show that our nation is designed by\r\nProvidence as the instrument for the recovery of its rights, and for the\r\nchastisement of proud, perfidious Albion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Literally \"bush of fines\" (fines imposed on landowners\r\nwhere the burr weed was not eradicated).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Africa for the African citizen or African-born whites.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: It is notorious that from about 1890 such marriages were\r\ndenounced from the Boer pulpits and on the occasions of the Independence\r\nday anniversaries (16th December).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPACIFIC POLICY OF GREAT BRITAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the period of, say, twenty-five years after the inception of the\r\nAfrikaner Bond, and while its organization and development were secretly\r\nkept at full pace with occurring events, the British Government\r\nconsistently and openly pursued the policy of bringing about the\r\nunification of South Africa. Mr. Froude, a speaker of rare gifts, was\r\nsent to lecture upon the topic: this was in about 1873. The Colonial\r\nGovernor, Sir Bartle Frere, strenuously advocated that union. The lines\r\nsuggested were a general federation under one protective flag,\r\nself-government in the Colonies, and the continuance of uncurtailed\r\nautonomic independence in the two Republics. The benefits which such a\r\ncoalition promised to all concerned in South Africa are obvious. It\r\nwould guarantee harmony between the two white races without involving\r\nthe least sacrifice of liberty with any party--it simply meant\r\ncoincident peace, prosperity and security, and would relieve England of\r\na considerable burden of anxiety. The scheme promised to find all-round\r\nacceptance, but, unaccountably, except to Bond men, its greatest\r\nopponents were the Cape Colonial Boers. It was, however, confidently\r\nhoped that, with patience, opposition and indifference would be\r\novercome, and in view of this no opportunity was lost to prove England's\r\nloyal sincerity by genial treatment, by conciliating the various\r\ninterests, and gratifying the wishes of the Boer communities, and so to\r\nensure the desideratum of complete _rapprochement_ between the white\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nConferences were convened with the objects of coming to agreements for\r\nthe establishment of a general South African Customs Union, and for\r\nadjusting railway tariffs upon fair bases and a more reliable permanency\r\nof rates suggesting reciprocal terms advantageous to the Republics.\r\nThese efforts also proved fruitless through similar opposition.\r\n\r\nThe Afrikaner Bond party, as the reader will understand, had ranged\r\nitself against all such attempts, whilst successfully masking its own\r\nobject all the time.\r\n\r\nOther differences, which, with a friendly and united spirit, were\r\ncapable of easy adjustment, were welcomed by that party as grist to its\r\nmill in order to widen the gulf and to increase the tension.\r\n\r\nBesides the chagrin over the failure of its peace policy, the British\r\nCabinet had finally to admit itself confronted with a very real and\r\nominous national peril, face to face with the South African Medusa,\r\nAfrikanerdom, defying Great Britain in preconcerted aggression and\r\nrevolt. That apparition was all the more startlingly disquieting because\r\nof the suddenness with which the magnitude of the menace and its wide\r\nperspectives had begun to expand into clearer view. It was interesting\r\nto note how the English ministry responded to the call upon its\r\nfortitude; the terrifying apparition did not seem to petrify that body\r\nof men, despite the galling handicapping consequences through the\r\nopposition of part of the nation, which was indeed tantamount to\r\nencouraging South African rebels and usurpers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOND PRESS PROPAGANDA--SECRET SERVICE--TRADE RIVALRIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bond leaders in Holland and South Africa had at an early stage acted\r\nupon Stuart Mill's recognised saying, \"that conviction in a cause is of\r\nmore potent avail than mere interest in it.\" Among those leaders there\r\nwas no lack of men of erudition and of psychological science, than whom\r\nno one knew better the prime importance of ensuring uniformity of\r\nconvictions among the Boers and their partisans, and that the public\r\nmind needs to be framed and trained so as to view the Boer cause as just\r\nand that of the English as odiously wicked. They knew how indispensable\r\nthe Press is for attaining those objects, how journalism is capable of\r\nplausibly representing black as white and to convince people so--that,\r\nin fact, it is on occasion an agency of persuasion more potent than\r\narmies are. Its needs are unscrupulous pens and ample payments. For\r\nmoney is the sinews of journalism as well as of war, whether the\r\nprojectiles be charged with lyddite or with lies, whether it is bullets\r\nor throwing dust into people's eyes.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how a few articles (for which a leading French paper\r\nreceived £100,000) were instrumental in enabling the Panama Canal Co. to\r\nswindle the French public of forty million pounds sterling, and more\r\nrecently, where through Press agency it became feasible to a combination\r\nof Jesuitism and militarism to seduce by far the greater portion of the\r\nnoble French nation into frenzied agitation and anti-Semitic excesses,\r\nand load the entire people with almost ineffaceable guilt in the matter\r\nof that unfortunate Dreyfus. In its Press campaign the Afrikaner Bond\r\nemployed several leading Colonial organs--the Bloemfontein _Express_,\r\nthe Pretoria _Volksstem_, the _Standard and Diggers' News_ of\r\nJohannesburg, and numerous papers of note abroad as well. These were\r\ncoached, in the usual masterly manner, sophisticating and perverting\r\ntruth. Whenever a lull occurred in treating one or other of the more\r\nsalient questions, those South African papers would invariably\r\ncontain--especially in their Dutch columns--aspersive articles, coupled\r\nwith invective comments to prejudice the Boer mind and to reawaken\r\nanti-English sentiments. It is notable as a proof that the Bond party\r\nlacked all occasions for recriminations, so that those papers had to\r\nresort for material for their vituperation to distorted incidents of\r\nTransvaal history prior to the peace of 1881. There would, for example,\r\nbe dished up falsely rendered and dramatically coloured and perverted\r\nselections, such as the treacherous massacre of Retief's party in 1838,\r\naverring that the Zulu king, Dingaan, had been incited thereto by the\r\nBritish authorities; tragic descriptions of events, coupled with the\r\nmassacres by Zulu impis soon after at Weenen and Blaauwkrantz, averred\r\nalso to have taken place at the instance of the English Government, and\r\never and anon references and full tragic descriptions of the\r\nSlachtersnek execution in 1816, omitting to state that the Boer culprits\r\nwere hanged after fair and open trial and conviction by a \"Boer\" jury\r\nfor high treason in conspiring with Kaffirs against the Government,\r\nwhich crime had led to bloodshed, and that their relatives had been\r\nordered to witness the execution because they had been abettors and\r\nprivy to the crime.\r\n\r\nBooks teaching the history of South Africa were adapted for school use\r\nwherein denunciations against the English appear in almost every\r\nchapter. Poetry in the vernacular Dutch and pamphlets teeming with like\r\nburdens and calumnies also did their share in inspiring race hatred.\r\n\r\nPro-Boer journalism in England and elsewhere abroad had assumed such\r\ndimensions, especially during the past decade, as to bring the Secret\r\nService expenditure on that head during recent years to over £100,000\r\nper annum. Dr. Leyds, the Transvaal ambassador, now (December, 1899) in\r\nEurope, is known to some to have with him some £250,000 to defray Press\r\nexpenditure, etc., apart from the millions to which he is authorized to\r\nengage his Government in diplomatic projects, such as procuring allies,\r\nor to create embroilments and diversions to the prejudice of England.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the success achieved by anti-English propaganda, we find the\r\nBoer nation, from the Zambesi to the Cape, unanimous in convictions as\r\nto their fancied claims, their own absolute innocence, and the\r\nimmeasurable guilt of the British Government, abetted by\r\ncapitalism--guilt which cries to heaven for retribution; and those\r\nconvictions take with each man the form of a resolute patriotism wherein\r\nmingled fanaticism and religious fervour in their cause form a\r\npowerfully sustaining part.\r\n\r\nPartisanship outside of Africa counts by millions of individuals and\r\nentire peoples; with these it is not so much conviction, but rather\r\npersuasion induced by political hatred and the souring effects of\r\njealousy and unsuccessful rivalry. This feature is, of course, most\r\naccentuated in Holland, where, with the eyes set upon the loaves and\r\nfishes in South Africa, that nation has for some time been \"publicly\r\npraying\" for Boer victory over England. These are instances of mere\r\ninterest in lieu of genuine convictions. In England the spectacle is\r\nmore varied. There we see interest where there are paid agencies, and\r\npersuasion more or less pronounced induced by political party spirit and\r\nalso by real convictions. It is in regard to the latter category where\r\nperverted journalism triumphs most and stabs deepest, where men of\r\nhonour and patriotism have adopted views which clash against public\r\ninterest, and convictions which torture their own minds with grief and\r\nshame under the supposed idea of England's unjust attitude towards the\r\nBoer people, assuming that a Government majority allows itself to be\r\nactuated by base motives.\r\n\r\nIs it not attributable in a large proportion to misguided as well as to\r\nvenal journalism that the Boer cause has so heavily scored?\r\n\r\nWas all this not manifest in the divisions of England's counsels, in the\r\nhampered progress of her diplomacy, her fateful hesitancy and delay in\r\nproviding appropriate preventive and protective measures in South\r\nAfrica?\r\n\r\nAnd as regards the tenacity of those convictions, it is with them as it\r\nis in plant life. The longer a tree is in maturing, the harder is it to\r\nuproot it.\r\n\r\nThe activities of Bond propaganda have been in continuance for many\r\nyears, and the prejudices fostered so long are correspondingly\r\ndeep-rooted.\r\n\r\nBond patriotism was not long subjected to the strain of individual\r\ncontributions and unpaid performances. When the Transvaal revenues\r\nadvanced with such giant strides the Afrikaner Bond leaders in that\r\nState contrived arrangements by which the financial requirements were\r\nsupplied from State receipts. Nor was the least compunction felt in\r\ndoing so. Was the revenue of the State not chiefly derived from the\r\nUitlander element--from Uitlander investments, which all throve from the\r\nnation's own buried gold wealth? No scruples existed to provide from\r\nthose sources the armaments and all else needed for the common cause of\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\nA secret service fund of some £40,000 per year only was placed upon the\r\nbudget list. But this amount was vastly exceeded by the growing\r\nrequirements of the Afrikaner Bond for expenditure in South Africa\r\nalone. It was easily contrived to divert, _sub rosa_, large State\r\nreceipts to supply the remaining financial needs. Among these figured,\r\nbesides the heavy outlays in journalism abroad, gratuities, etc., a\r\nlarge bill also for secret agencies, spies, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe entire expenditure was under the direction of a few only of the\r\ntrusted leaders and audited by the chiefs, all being kept otherwise\r\nundivulged.\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal thus became the treasury as well as the arsenal of the\r\nentire Afrikaner Bond.\r\n\r\nHundreds of agents were in constant employ in the Cape Colonies and\r\nNatal suborning the Boer colonists; many of them occupied positions in\r\nvarious branches of the Colonial Government, and were able to supply\r\ninformation upon any subject and even to influence elections.\r\n\r\nThere were numerous permanent agents drawing large emoluments in Europe\r\nalso, and emissaries to different places abroad, some touring in\r\nAmerica, England, and the Continent, as the Rev. Mr. Bosman did\r\nrecently, and also the P.M.G., Isaac van Alphen.\r\n\r\nMuch energy and money were also devoted to electioneering campaigns, as\r\nhad notoriously been done in the Cape Colony towards bringing in a Bond\r\nmajority. Large sums are spent in the diplomatic arena in Holland to\r\npropitiate foreign statesmen, soliciting sympathy, and in coquettings\r\nfor Transvaal allies. One of these attempts that failed had been with\r\nGermany. It would appear that some progress had been feasible some years\r\nago in temporarily luring Emperor William to favour a Holland-Transvaal\r\ncombination, but when that sovereign had at last penetrated the infamous\r\nbusiness that lay behind it all, he, as a true \"_Bayard_\" promptly\r\nwashed his hands clean of it, preferring to forego obvious brilliant\r\nadvantages for his people than to sully Germany's fair fame in a\r\nconnection amounting to no less than abetting a foul conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe readers of the Johannesburg _Standard and Diggers' News_ will\r\nremember among the staple attacks upon capitalism quite a series of\r\narticles intended to decoy mining artisans and operatives to Boer views.\r\nSecret agents were also employed for that purpose, and to induce the\r\nbelief that the Government was the enemy of capitalism, and would\r\nchampion its victims (the mining operatives) in the State. It would\r\nsupport miners and the working class generally against attempts to\r\ncurtail the just rights of labour, and to parade its sincerity actually\r\npassed a law constituting eight tours a legal day's labour. With such\r\ncoquettings it was hoped to gain the miners' confidence and adhesion.\r\nThose men were, however, not to be taught by quasi-socialistic\r\nprofessions of concern, and when, some months later, the exodus prior\r\nto the war occurred, they nearly all left, much to the disgust and\r\ndiscomfiture of the Government, which had counted upon them to stay to\r\nwork the mines for its own account when the moment should arrive.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation of gold mines and their exploitation for Government\r\nbenefit bring about a singular anomaly for a nation engaged in war,\r\nviz., that of a plethora of gold and a scarcity of paper currency, the\r\nTransvaal mint coining the sinews of war at the expense of its victims,\r\nbut the plundered gold after all not equalling commercial paper values.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the foregoing remarks the following may also be said.\r\nStates professing neutrality still permit themselves to trade with the\r\nTransvaal to a large extent. It is notorious that that State possesses\r\nno funds available for payments except the gold derived from the\r\nmisappropriated mines. The output is seized in its entirety, and not\r\nlimited to the extent accruing to British scrip holders only. The\r\nhustling rivalry of doing business with the Transvaal thus involves\r\nreceiving stolen money in payment of trade accounts. We see the\r\nreceivers eager to stand upon the same platform as the thief, thus not\r\nonly as his political partisans, but also as his accomplices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISLOYALTY OF COLONIAL BOERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boer section in the Cape Colonies represents nearly one-half of the\r\nwhite population there. Their representatives in the administration were\r\never profuse and assertive in professions of loyalty to the Queen and to\r\nthe English Government, and any aspersions to the contrary were always\r\nindignantly and stoutly repelled. The Afrikaner Bond was averred to\r\ninclude nothing to clash with loyal sentiments, no severance from\r\nEngland, but, on the contrary, that its principal objects were to\r\nstrengthen the lines of amity and joint solidarity in view of a general\r\nfederation of South Africa upon Imperial bases. In support of such\r\nsentiments one of the first acts of the Bond party when recently come\r\ninto power was a vote of £30,000 per year towards British naval outlays,\r\nand in grateful recognition of naval protection; it was at the same time\r\nmooted, in fact almost pledged, that the Transvaal would similarly offer\r\n£12,000 as well.\r\n\r\nThe sequel has proven these to be Athenian gifts, for no sooner had the\r\nRepublican commandoes invaded the Cape Colonies in November last than\r\nthose identical men enthusiastically welcomed the Queen's enemies as\r\ntheir friends and deliverers from hateful English dominion. There they\r\nstood--self-avowed and unmasked traitors. Members of the Legislative\r\nAssembly met those Boer invaders with addresses and speeches, assuring\r\nthem of their own and of every other true Afrikaner's aid and fidelity\r\nin their common cause. \"The star of liberty,\" they said, \"had arisen at\r\nlast--it had been the nation's desire and prayers during the past\r\nfifteen years.\" \"He could thank God with tears of joy for having granted\r\nthose prayers.\" Such were the words of Mr. van der Walt, M.L.A., uttered\r\nat Colesberg. Mr. de Wet, M.L.A., Mr. van den Heever, M.L.A., and other\r\ncolonial notables were spokesmen in similar terms of enthusiasm on other\r\noccasions as the invasion advanced. All this is sadly notorious, but\r\nstill it seems a hard task to convince people who prefer to remain blind\r\nor only see a presumptuous adversary in any one who seeks to enlighten\r\nthem upon this glaring and premeditated treachery.\r\n\r\nOctober and November were months of unrestrained exultation to the Boer\r\nparty, to judge from letters and articles which appeared in the\r\n_Standard and Diggers' News_, Johannesburg, dated 22nd November, 1899,\r\nand in the Pretoria _Volksstem_, dated 20th November, 1899.[10] There\r\none sees the mask off, in language of defiant insult and of scurrilous\r\nmendacity against all that is English, avowing that the present\r\nAnglo-Boer War has been the outcome of preparations during the past\r\nthirty years. That letter is not all suitable reading for the tender\r\nsex, but should serve as evidence to the still unconvinced sceptic that\r\nthe Boers are fighting for something more than their mere independence\r\nand liberty, viz., for conquest and the domination of Afrikanerdom. His\r\nExcellency Dr. Leyds may deny all those too previous intentions with\r\nhis placid effrontery of assumed innocent calm. He may denounce Mr.\r\nChamberlain, Rhodes, Jameson, and even the Prince of Wales, and he may\r\nuse the old device of posing as innocent by accusing others. The\r\ndetected robber, however, does not always escape with his booty by\r\nrunning off himself, whilst shouting \"Stop, thief!\"\r\n\r\nSomething refreshingly analogous to such attempts of screening and\r\nexculpation has been extemporized in Cape journals of late. There, in an\r\ningeniously pretended dissertation, it is invented how ill founded the\r\naspersions are against Mr. Premier Schreiner, and that the acts, upon\r\nwhich he was so wrongly suspected as an amphibious helmsman, are really\r\nattributable to another person--by the way, to one at a safe distance,\r\nviz., to Mr. F.W. Reitz, the Transvaal State Secretary; whilst this\r\ngentleman again, when lecturing at Johannesburg in July last, naively\r\ndeplored the confusion of people's ideas who see anything wrong in the\r\nAfrikaner Bond, adding: \"Lord, forgive them, for they know not what they\r\ndo or talk about.\"\r\n\r\n\"The peace of South Africa is only possible under Boer supremacy,\" is\r\nthe Bond shibboleth. The end justifies the means, even to sedition, to a\r\nwar of conquest and the wholesale plunder of investors.\r\n\r\nMany of the younger Boers in the Cape Colony and Natal had shown a\r\nsingular ardour in joining the several volunteer corps. They were\r\nequipped with uniforms and best weapons, were drilled into efficiency,\r\nreceived pay, and all went on well until the oath of allegiance was to\r\nbe tendered. This they refused, preferring to resign and to provide arms\r\nfrom other sources--Mauser rifles by preference. This happened some\r\nconsiderable time before the outbreak of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoer Arguments Denying Uitlanders' Complaints\r\n\r\nMany plausible arguments are proffered to prove that Uitlanders'\r\ngrievances and irritations are purely fictitious, but few, I venture to\r\nsay, will bear examination. Taxation, for example, is stoutly averred to\r\nfall alike upon burgher and Uitlander, but a glance at the long rubric\r\nof articles specially taxed will show that the selection is contrived to\r\nhit the latter and to spare, or even to protect and benefit, the burgher\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nThe gold industry is not charged with a royalty as is customary in other\r\ngold-producing countries, but with 5 per cent. only upon the net\r\nprofits; but here an intolerant and corrupt domination proves much more\r\nprejudicial than a heavy royalty would be.\r\n\r\nProper representation would be the remedy and afford contentment, even\r\nwith higher taxation, but that is refused upon Bond principles.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Boer War is attributed to base motives on the part of the\r\nBritish Government, operating in collusion with capitalism--to England's\r\npassion for annexation, her rapacious greed for the Transvaal gold, her\r\ninordinate ambition to universal commercial supremacy, etc. What a\r\nconfusion of assertions and of self-refuting contradictions!\r\n\r\nWould England really acquire the Transvaal gold by the annexation of\r\nthat State, seeing that its mines are already capitalized and as good as\r\nexpropriated in favour of the host of shareholders, some of whom are\r\nEnglish, but the greater portion German, French, and of other nations?\r\n\r\nWhat advantage would accrue to shareholders? Would England, in case of\r\nforcible annexation, not be under the necessity of incurring a heavy\r\ncharge in the increase of her South African garrisons, and so be\r\njustified in levying a considerable royalty upon the output, which would\r\nmaterially reduce the dividends? What advantage would arise to England\r\nby substituting an unproductive and costly war in South Africa for\r\nconditions of peace and prosperity, which alone can yield her commerce\r\nprofit? England can only derive profit from wars waged between other\r\npeoples. And as to the incentive of commercial supremacy, England, while\r\npossessing that to a large extent already, freely and voluntarily allows\r\nall comers from other nationalities to share the benefits with her by\r\nher principle of free trade.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Extract from Pretoria _Volksstem_, 20th November, 1899,\r\nfrom a long letter averred to have appeared in the London _Times_, dated\r\n12th October, 1899, said to have been signed by a well-known Cape Boer,\r\nthen in England:--\r\n\r\n\"We have desired delay, and we have had it, and we are now practically\r\nmasters of South Africa from the Zambesi to the Cape. All the Afrikaners\r\nin the Cape Colony have been working for years past for this end.\r\n\r\n\"For thirty years the Cape Dutch have been waiting their chance, and now\r\ntheir day has come; they will throw off their mask and their yoke at the\r\nsame instant, and 200,000 Dutch heroes will trample you tinder foot. We\r\ncan afford to tell you the truth now, and in this letter you have got\r\nit.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTUGUESE TERRITORY--TRANSVAAL LOW VELDT--MALARIA--HORSE SICKNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the north-eastern borders of the Transvaal and the coast lies\r\nthe Portuguese colony Mozambique. Its frontier railway station, Ressario\r\nGarcia, is near that of the Transvaal, viz., Komati poort, which is 53\r\nmiles from Delagoa Bay. A low-lying country extends from the coast about\r\n100 to 200 miles inland, and is tropical. Except some elevated spots,\r\nthe whole of it is almost uninhabitable in summer by whites on account\r\nof malaria. During some specially bad seasons natives even succumb to\r\nthat malady. The only comparatively safe months are from June to\r\nNovember. Marshy localities, and wherever there is shaded rank\r\nvegetation in low-lying parts, are dangerous all the year round; in such\r\nplaces the water is deadly at all times unless first boiled.\r\n\r\nThis malarial poison is distinct from that which produces yellow fever\r\nin America, and is so far unlike it as it is not contagious. The theory\r\nis that the poison is produced below the surface by decaying vegetable\r\nmatter in low and dank parts during the more inactive but still warm and\r\nsunny winter season and during the hot months preceding the summer\r\nrainfall. Upon the first rains the malarial poison escapes through the\r\nthen softened crust in the shape of vapoury miasms. This happens during\r\nthe night, after the surface of the earth has been cooled off. Those\r\nmiasms are dissipated or neutralised by the action of the sun. The dewy\r\ngrass retains the poison until it is thoroughly dried to the root. All\r\nsurface water is liable to that poisonous impregnation. Malarial\r\nmanifestations occur all over South Africa, but in progressive degrees\r\nof virulence with the advance to warmer latitudes, and with the descent\r\nfrom the high table-lands to the coast levels. On the Transvaal high\r\nveldt, for example, a mild form is developed which, in midsummer, to a\r\nsmall extent, affects and kills sheep. It is called _blaauwtong_, and\r\ndoes not affect horses. Descending further, this danger to sheep\r\nincreases and begins earlier. Below 5,000 feet altitude in the Transvaal\r\nthe summer season is dangerous to sheep, and horses and mules are\r\nsubject to horse sickness; whilst lower still the same malaria attains\r\nsufficient virulence to attack human beings, and becomes very deadly\r\nupon levels nearing the coast. Komati poort, the frontier railway\r\nstation already mentioned, is dreaded as a still worse death-trap than\r\neven Delagoa Bay, where it is very unsafe, say, from December to end of\r\nApril. The season of horse sickness terminates upon the appearance of\r\nthe first sharp frost in May. The safeguards for human beings consist in\r\navoidance at night and early morning of low-lying localities, or such\r\nelevated places even which are subject to be invaded by miasmatic\r\nemanations produced on and wafted from dangerous lower levels. Drink no\r\nunboiled water except that from deep wells or rain-water; maintain\r\ncareful and moderate diet, active habits, but avoiding extreme exertions\r\nand excitements; a very sparing use of alcoholic drinks, preferably\r\ntaken with the regular meals, is admissible.\r\n\r\nDonkeys, horned cattle, and goats are exempt from malarial risks.\r\n\r\nFor horses and mules no certain remedy appears as yet to be known. The\r\nbest research, on behalf of the Transvaal Government, by specially\r\nrequisitioned French bacteriologists, assisted by that famous\r\nmicrobe-hunter, Dr. Theiler (Dr. Theiler is the Transvaal veterinary\r\nsurgeon and chief of the Medical Laboratory, Pretoria, a noted Swiss\r\nsavant, who, with the aid of the said French experts, discovered the\r\nrinderpest inoculation remedy), has failed to find the bacillus of horse\r\nsickness. Barely five per cent, of the horses attacked recover, and\r\nabout ten per cent, of mules. These are then called salted, and are\r\nimmune from horse sickness; they can after that be safely used in the\r\nworst localities, and are correspondingly more valuable. They are,\r\nhowever, liable periodically to light after-attacks, when it is safer to\r\nexempt them from work for a day, or for a few hours at least.\r\n\r\nSome proprietors of mail coaches are in the habit of administering doses\r\nof arsenic to their horses and mules, which are said to operate in\r\nlessening the death rate and to favour the salting process.\r\n\r\nAs safeguards for horses and mules, the following rules have been found\r\nto minimise losses in dangerous tracts where the low clinging miasmatic\r\nvapours are so deadly during the night and earlier parts of the morning.\r\n(During rainfall there is hardly any danger, nor is there after a\r\nnight's rain for the day following):--\r\n\r\nDo not traverse low suspicious tracts during the hours between 9 p.m.\r\nand, say, two hours after sunrise, lest poisonous vapours be\r\nencountered and inhaled by man or horse.\r\n\r\nChoose the most elevated spots for camping out at night. No grazing to\r\nbe allowed from 10 p.m. to about 10 or 11 a.m., unless it is raining.\r\nDewy grass is fatally poisoned; the heavy moist air close to the surface\r\nis also suspected. Grazing is only safe after the soil and grass are\r\ndried of all dewy moisture.\r\n\r\nAvoid all water of at all a stagnant nature; rather let the animals\r\nremain thirsty.\r\n\r\nIf the animals have been fed with dry fodder during the night, let the\r\nfirst morning stage be moderate and not exhausting. With empty stomachs\r\nthe task might be somewhat increased, but even then it should be less\r\nthan any other succeeding stage. When the first symptoms of sickness are\r\nnoticed they may pass over if the animal is at once freed from work and\r\nallowed to rest, or is at most led when marching. Among the most\r\ndangerous places for horse sickness and for fever to human beings are\r\nthe luxurious dongas, ravines, and valleys which abound along the long\r\nstretches of mountains and broken country immediately below the high\r\nplateaux.\r\n\r\nThe passes leading up to the high veldt are few in number, and so\r\nprecipitous as to be almost impracticable for vehicles. Of late years\r\nthose roads have been allowed to fall into disrepair, in order, it may\r\nbe supposed, to check wagon traffic and to promote that by railway;\r\napart from the railway, communication with Delagoa Bay would now be\r\nimpossible. What with the fever climate in summer, and the formidable\r\nmountain barriers, the Transvaal high veldt is well protected from\r\naggression from the direction of Delagoa Bay. A few thousand men\r\ndistributed at the few mountain passes, blocking the tunnel at one of\r\nthese (at Waterval Boven), and breaking up some few bridges, would\r\neffectually arrest the progress of any invading force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE AND TOPOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the tropical Zambesi regions and the torrid Kalahari plains, down\r\nto the 34th parallel at Cape point, a great diversity of climatic\r\nconditions is met with. To the north and north-east are the steaming,\r\ndeath-breeding low lands, abounding with dank virgin forests and scrubby\r\nstretches; and to the north-west extend the arid, sandy, and stony\r\nlevels. There are the temperate and fruitful inland reaches along the\r\nsouthern and south-eastern littoral, and again further inward the vast\r\nplateaux at 2,000 to 6,500 feet elevation, which represent nearly\r\none-half of the sub-continent with quite other climatic aspects. In the\r\nsouthern and western provinces of the Cape Colony the rainy season\r\noccurs during the winter months, probably because of the proximity to\r\nthe trade wind influences prevailing over the South Atlantic; over the\r\nrest of South Africa the winters are dry and sunny, the rains falling in\r\nsummer, most copiously in December and January, the effect being that\r\nthere are hardly any winter rigours, and the heat of summer is\r\nminimised. The most agreeable climate is that on the higher plateau\r\nlevels: never hot nor altogether cold, and yet virile and bracing;\r\nsomething like the climate on sunny days found in the higher Alpine\r\nregions in summer and in the mild Algerine winters. This climate is\r\nfound from the Queenstown district at about 3,000 feet elevation,\r\nextending north and westwards over the Stormberg, the Orange Free State,\r\nand along the lordly Drakensberg range and its spurs some 200 to 300\r\nmiles into the Transvaal, where the highest plateau levels occur between\r\nErmelo and to near Lydenburg, viz., 6,500 feet. The Harrismith district\r\nnear that mountain range is at a similar altitude with an identical\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nThese high tracts are called _hoogeveldt_ or highlands. Their altitude\r\nrises steadily with the advance northwards towards warmer latitudes, and\r\nwith the compensating effect that the climate in the Queenstown\r\ndistrict, Bontebok Flats for example, at 3,000 feet elevation, is\r\nexactly similar to that in the eastern portions of the Orange Free State\r\nat 5,500 feet, right up to near Lydenburg at 6,500 feet altitude, and\r\nbeing some six degrees further north than Queenstown. The northern half\r\nof Natal also partakes of that character, though there, as well as over\r\nthe rest of the eastern slopes of the Drakensberg mountains, the country\r\nis more broken and hilly than on the western side. The Cape Colonial\r\nhigh veldt near the Drakensberg range is intersected by high\r\ncontinuations or spurs, but north and westwards those plateaux assume\r\nmore the real aspect of continuous high plains. There is a gradual\r\ndescent to the west; from occasional hilly ranges those dwindle to\r\nkopjes, and to still less elevated \"randjes\" occurring in clusters more\r\nand more apart, until yet further westwards one gets to the merely\r\nundulating sterile approaches of the Karoo and the plains around and\r\nbeyond Kimberley, which merge at last in the still lower Kalahara\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nWithin 200 or 300 miles from the Drakensberg slopes the country is\r\nwell-watered, and the rainfall ample and generally regular, but\r\nwestwards this abundance progressively decreases with a more tardy and\r\nprecarious rainy season, occasioning at times severe droughts\r\naccompanied with correspondingly protracted and very hot weather.\r\n\r\nThose high plains make up one vast green sward from the time of the\r\nspring rains in September to April. From May the absence of rain,\r\ntogether with the night frosts, shrivel up the herbage, giving the\r\ncountry a pale-brown aspect. This continues until the return of spring,\r\nvaried with large expanses of black, caused by accidental or intentional\r\ngrass fires, and here and there a few green spots in specially sheltered\r\nand moist localities.\r\n\r\nThose burnt spaces may extend for miles, and are for the time veritable\r\ndeserts. The landscape being quite black and the atmosphere generally\r\nvery clear, it is obvious that objects of any lighter colour would be\r\nconspicuous at very long distances: an ideal background for khaki\r\ntargets.\r\n\r\nMost of the land is well suited for agriculture, but by far the largest\r\nproportion is as yet used only for raising sheep, horses and cattle.\r\nAngora goats also thrive in the hillier parts. About forty years ago the\r\nKaroo plains, the Orange Free State, and Transvaal were, so to say,\r\nmonopolised by milliards of game. Standing upon an eminence or a swell\r\none could see in all directions, as far as the eye could reach,\r\ninnumerable herds of all sorts of game grazing, resting or gambolling;\r\nthe different kinds would be ranged in separate groups and could be\r\ndistinguished by their special colours--the black-looking wildebeest\r\n(gnu) next to the striped quag-gas, the white-flanked springbocks,\r\nblesbocks with a blaze on their foreheads, the larger elands and other\r\nkinds of the antelope species. Almost all those vast herds have\r\ndisappeared since, having been killed off by natives and Boers for their\r\nhides and for food, or else scared away farther north, where rinderpest\r\nextirpated nearly all the rest in 1895-1897.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier days, and even not so long ago in some parts, the\r\nfarmers' crops required guarding during the night against the\r\ndepredations of game. This is still so in the north-western plains of\r\nthe Cape Colony, as already remarked. In May most of the Harrismith\r\ndistrict farmers and those of the Transvaal high veldt move their sheep,\r\nhorses and cattle to winter in Natal, Swaziland, and to the other\r\nextensive low lands most adjacent, to return after the spring rains in\r\nSeptember or October. Sheep and horses could not with safety remain\r\nlonger in those warm regions, as then the fatal malarial _blaauwtong_\r\nbegins there to attack sheep, and horse sickness becomes virulent as\r\nwell. The high veldt, as said before, is exempt from that danger.\r\n\r\nSome of the wealthier farmers can arrange it so that they and their\r\nfamilies can winter at their comfortable high-veldt homes and send\r\nattendants with their cattle to the low veldt, while others, not so\r\nwell favoured, must close up their houses and accompany their flocks to\r\nwinter in the warm tracts, where they live in their wagons and tents and\r\nescape the outlay for winter clothing.\r\n\r\nOwing to the scarcity of wood on the high veldt, kraal fuel used\r\nformerly to be the staple substitute. This would be obtained by penning\r\nup sheep over-night. The deposits were after a month or two dug out in\r\nthick flags, which, after being stacked and dried over the kraal wall,\r\nwould burn nearly as well and as brightly as wood. The discovery of coal\r\nbeds in so many accessible places in the Cape Colony, Natal, and in the\r\ntwo Republics has since superseded that sort of fuel to a great extent.\r\n\r\nThe small divergence between summer and winter temperature upon the high\r\ntable lands will be seen from the following table taken from\r\nobservations at 5,500 to 6,000 feet altitude in the Transvaal:--\r\n\r\n            Fahr.                Fahr.\r\n\r\nIn winter--28° to 40° at night; 35° to 70° by day in the shade.\r\nIn summer--40° to 60° at night; 50° to 90° by day in the shade.\r\n\r\nIt is not often that 85° is reached, and rarely above. This applies\r\nequally to the more southern and thus colder latitudes of Queenstown, at\r\n3,000 feet elevation, and to the eastern half of the Orange Free State,\r\nat 4,000 to 5,000 feet, the warmth increasing, as said before,\r\nproportionately with the descent in altitude, and on occasions of tardy\r\nsummer rains.\r\n\r\nThe winter is the most enjoyable of the seasons, being an almost\r\nuninterrupted continuation of fine sunny weather. On occasions there\r\nwould be spells of boisterous weather with a rather sudden and inclement\r\ndecrease of temperature, brought on by cold south-east winds; if these\r\nare accompanied with rain in winter, which, however, rarely happens, it\r\nwould sometimes turn to sleet or even snow, or else to hard freezing at\r\nnight. The snow would, however, thaw with the warmth of the sun, and so\r\nrestore the temperature as before. The bracing quality of the climate\r\nmostly consists just in those variations of cool nights and warm days,\r\nand the occasional days of comparatively cold, boisterous weather. The\r\nlatter must indeed be provided against, for even in December--that is to\r\nsay, in the middle of summer--it would be imprudent to travel without\r\ngreat-coats as well as waterproofs, so as to be protected against\r\nunexpected changes, from say, 100° in the sun, almost suddenly to 40°\r\nwith a driving wind, accompanied perhaps with rain. Such transitions are\r\ntrying in the open, even if one is well clad, and the blustering weather\r\nis sometimes so severe, if it happens in winter or early spring, as to\r\napproach the character of a blizzard. One such lasted about thirty hours\r\nin the early spring of 1881. It swept over the entire South African\r\nplateaux and destroyed great numbers of sheep and cattle. These fell\r\nexhausted in their flight before they could reach some sheltering hills\r\nor ravines. In situations where such protections from the cold\r\nsouth-east wind were far apart the veldt was on the following day found\r\nstrewn with their carcases, and upon the still more extensive and\r\nunbroken plains antelopes even perished in enormous numbers simply from\r\nexhaustion in trying to escape and find shelter from the cold wind.\r\n\r\nI will just describe one of those occurrences, the severest in my\r\nexperience and well remembered by the Free State and the Transvaal\r\nBoers--it was, I think, in 1881. One sunny day, early in August (spring\r\ntime), at a place about twenty miles east of Reddersburg, in the Orange\r\nFree State, the wind veered to the south-east, and by afternoon had\r\nbegun to blow fairly hard and cold, about 35° Fahrenheit--that is to\r\nsay, about 35° below the temperature of a few hours previously. I had\r\nmanaged to get some milch cows driven near to the kraal, where there\r\nwould have been very fair shelter for them, but luckily, as the sequel\r\nproved, they refused to enter, and rushed past in a scared way, just\r\nsnatching up one mouthful of forage which had been thrown down to entice\r\nthem to stay, and making off as hard as they could. The wind did not\r\nabate till the day after, when tales kept pouring in of terrible losses\r\nof sheep and cattle killed by the cold wind; sheep in open plains had\r\nsuffered most, and cattle which had been kraaled were nearly all dead,\r\nwhilst the herds of cattle and horses which had been left grazing out\r\nhad been driven away and were also believed to have died. At the farm of\r\na certain Andries Bester, near by, some seventy head of cattle in very\r\ngood condition were found dead, piled up to the level of one of the\r\nkraal walls, showing the struggle which some thirty others had in\r\nescaping over the mound of dead cattle to the outside of the kraal.\r\n\r\nThe next day all those thirty head were found grazing some fifteen miles\r\nwestwards under the lee of hills near Reddersburg, where they had found\r\nsafe shelter. Everybody's cattle were recovered which had not been\r\nkraaled, including mine. This was the case as well with cattle which had\r\nbeen tethered to their transport wagons and which succeeded in breaking\r\nloose, whilst the rest were found dead where they had been tied.\r\n\r\nThere was no possibility of restraining cattle or horses from\r\nstampeding--they did it from the instinct of self-preservation, for,\r\nwhilst running with the wind, its force of driving cold was\r\nproportionately lessened, and some loss of heat was made good by the\r\nexertion of running, which they had to keep up till in safe shelter of\r\nhills or ravines.\r\n\r\nHad such a cold storm overtaken an army or patrol, the situation would\r\nhave been exactly similar, and would have been an ordeal even to\r\nexperienced Boers or Colonial farmers, and if an enemy had been located\r\nnear Reddersburg, all the cattle and horses would simply have fallen\r\ninto his lap.\r\n\r\nThe obvious safeguard would be a rug for each horse and mule, and for\r\noxen the erection of a shelter against the wind, consisting of all\r\navailable wagons and stores, or else, if practicable, to move at once to\r\na sheltered locality and always provide a good reserve supply of forage\r\nor other provender. That sort of boisterous, cold weather continues\r\nsometimes, with more or less severity, two or three days. The want of\r\nfood and inclemency besides would result in killing the weak cattle and\r\nweaken the rest so as to be incapable of work for some days after. The\r\ndifficulty consists in that such inclement changes occur so suddenly,\r\nand that their severity and duration cannot be forecasted.\r\n\r\nUpon other much less severe occasions entire gangs of 20-50 Kaffirs,\r\ntravelling from the warm north to the diamond-fields or gold-mines, and\r\nnot sufficiently provided with blankets, would be found at their camping\r\nplaces huddled together, nearly all numbed to death. The months when\r\nsuch surprise weather is most liable to occur are from \"July to\r\nOctober,\" before and during the earlier spring rains. It is then, and\r\neven up to December at times, that the Drakensberg and other mountains\r\nresume their snow-capped winter decorations for some days. There is a\r\nsaying which fairly well applies to the high-veldt climate, _i.e._, that\r\ncold and inclement weather is not met with until well in towards summer,\r\nespecially about the time of spring rains, and that hot weather of any\r\nconsiderable continuance mostly occurs in spring. This will be\r\nunderstood upon considering that the midsummer months, December to\r\nFebruary, are cooled by very frequent and copious rains, whilst the heat\r\naccumulates more during the preceding sunny spring months, which are\r\ninterrupted at rarer intervals by short showers only.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, and despite the few eccentricities mentioned, the high\r\nveldt is favoured with a climate which, for genial comfort all the year\r\nround, exempt from prolonged winter rigours and excessive summer heat,\r\nis not found anywhere else in the world, or only in rare privileged\r\nspots. It is withal most healthy, promoting the highest possible\r\nphysical development and even longevity.\r\n\r\nUnder such favoured conditions the hand of man only is needed in\r\nproviding good habitations, planting trees, in the culture of the soil,\r\nand some irrigation labour, to transform nearly every little farm within\r\nfive to ten years from a bare pastoral monotony to a really idyllic\r\nspot. There are many such already in Basutoland, the Orange Free State,\r\nand the Transvaal, as well as in the Cape Colonies and Natal--veritable\r\nEden-like places, as it were bits dropped from heaven. With a\r\ncontinuance of peace these could be multiplied to any extent each year,\r\nthus rendering those sparsely inhabited tracts the most beautiful areas\r\nin the world, with a prosperous self-sustaining population, quite apart\r\nfrom considerations of mineral wealth.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing description of the high-veldt climate points to clothing\r\ncomposed of woollen fabrics as the only _rational and safe_ attire for\r\nmen travelling or taking the field. No constitution could be expected to\r\nhold out against the ever-changing temperature and weather if depending\r\nupon being clad, for example, in a cotton suit; this would only do on\r\nwarm days for men who are certain of being safely housed at night and\r\nsheltered during rainy weather. Horses and mules in the open should be\r\nprovided with woollen rugs during winter and spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOER PREPAREDNESS FOR WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ultimatum cabled to England had no sooner expired at 5 p.m. on the\r\n11th October last than the same evening and on the very next and\r\nsucceeding days appeared, published all over the Orange Free State and\r\nthe Transvaal, \"Government Gazettes extraordinary,\" filling scores of\r\npages, comprising proclamations of martial law, and the hundred and one\r\nenactments and provisions regulating that new condition. Their preambles\r\nstated: Whereas in secret session on such and such dates (that is to\r\nsay, months previous) the honourable First Volksraad had passed this or\r\nthat law--or whereas the two Volksraads, assembled in secret session,\r\nhad authorized the Government to frame such and such laws, to come into\r\nforce immediately after publication. This shows at least a studious\r\npurpose months beforehand to be in complete readiness, for it obviously\r\ntook no little time to prepare all those laws, and have them ready in\r\ntype for despatch and publication as had been done. It accords with the\r\nassumption that war had been predetermined, and this is further\r\nconfirmed by numerous statements, publicly made by Volksraad members,\r\nand also by President Steyn's famous and now historic message to\r\nPresident Krüger some short time before, in the laconic and oracular\r\nwords, \"We are ready.\"\r\n\r\nThat the Afrikaner Bond had been for years past preparing for its _coup\r\nd'état_ is further shown by the following incidents which can be\r\nsubstantiated by the writer:--\r\n\r\nDuring the days of the Jameson raid a very prominent Transvaal Boer,\r\nholding office and who had two sons at the scene of the disturbance,\r\nremarked at a public place in conversation with other burghers:--\r\n\r\n\"England just wants to annex the Transvaal, and no doubt the Orange Free\r\nState too. This we know; but what she does not know is, that we can at\r\nthis moment reverse the tale--we can seize in one day Cape Town, Port\r\nElizabeth, East London, and Durban, and within a very short time turn\r\nevery Englishman out of the Colonies, out of the land which England has\r\nrobbed us of.\"\r\n\r\nThose words were spoken by a Bond man who is known to rarely speak in\r\npublic. When asked by a Uitlander how it could be done, he relapsed into\r\nhis usual prudent reticence, and merely remarked grimly, \"We can do it.\"\r\n\r\nBut for subsequent revelations and the present sequel those words would\r\nhave been forgotten, and were at the time attributed by some to mere\r\nboastful exuberance.\r\n\r\nIn July last the topic was discussed by some Boers at the house of a\r\nhighly placed military official, about the five per cent. tax upon the\r\nprofits of the gold industry. One said it should be raised to\r\ntwenty-five per cent. for the benefit of the burgher estate. That\r\nofficial, who, by the way, had just returned from a gathering of country\r\nofficials at Pretoria, sententiously replied \"that it was no more a\r\nquestion of any tribute, but of taking the mines altogether out of the\r\ncapitalists' hands\"; and when another burgher interposed a doubt as to\r\nthe fairness of such a proceeding, that official continued by saying,\r\n\"Fairness indeed! it is we who have submitted to unfairness only too\r\nlong--_ons wil nou Engelse schiet_ (we want now to go on the battue of\r\nEnglishmen).\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Transvaal Government had secured the assent of both Volksraads\r\nto the seven years' franchise measure it was thought desirable, as a\r\nmatter of form and to gain time, to defer the formal passing of the law\r\nuntil after it had been referred to the burghers. This was not done till\r\nAugust last. A large section of the people were known to be against\r\nextending the franchise, but the Government had no misgivings about the\r\nresult, counting upon the persuasive influence of the Volksraad members\r\nwho were to preside at the plebiscite meetings, and had before been\r\ndrilled up to their task. Their success was as desired, and the measure\r\nbecame law in due course. Those meetings in the different districts and\r\nwards of the State were characterised by almost uniform proceedings, so\r\nthat the description of one of them can serve for all.\r\n\r\nThe burghers assembled on the appointed day at the local Government\r\nOffice. The Landdrost, or chief official of the ward, took the chair.\r\nThere were four Volksraad members, who each in turn recommended the\r\nadoption of the seven years' franchise measure. The burghers were\r\ninvited to express their views. The majority appeared dead against it,\r\nbut were gradually appeased, and they finally assented to a motion of\r\napproval presented by the chairman, which also conveyed full confidence\r\nin the Government and their representatives to deal with the enactment\r\nand to modify it as they might consider appropriate.\r\n\r\nOne of the burghers had in his speech stated in passionate terms that no\r\ndictation on the part of Uitlanders could be tolerated; they must either\r\nobey the laws or leave the State. The function and prerogative of making\r\nlaws belonged to the burghers. They had been ill-used enough by the\r\nEnglish; it would be still worse, he said, if they were invested with\r\nlegislative rights. \"On the contrary, it is the Boer nation which is\r\nentitled to supremacy, not only in the Transvaal but right to the sea.\r\nThe Cape Colonies,\" he continued, \"are ours by divine right, and so is\r\nNatal, and no Afrikaner may rest until we are reinstated.\" General\r\napprobation and stamping of feet followed that passionately rendered\r\nspeech. Not a word of restraint or censure from any of the four\r\nVolksraad members. Some of these had addressed the meeting already, and\r\nthe others in turn followed. Their speeches had one import, viz.,\r\n\"Burghers! The Government and the two Volksraads have carefully and\r\nprayerfully weighed this seven years' franchise measure. You may safely\r\napprove of it; it can result in no harm; it will strengthen our cause.\r\nWe know that England wants our land because of the gold in it; but this\r\nlaw will contribute to thwart her, though it will not avert war. We were\r\na small nation when our fathers trekked to this side of the Orange\r\nRiver; we have become united and strong since. It will be soon seen that\r\nour people have to be reckoned with among the other nations of the\r\nearth; we have right on our side, and, with God's help, we are certain\r\nto prevail. Burghers, you may trust us as your representatives; we are\r\nall of one mind with you; you may safely approve of the proposed\r\nfranchise law, and leave possible modifications in the hands of the\r\nGovernment.\" Then followed tumultuous approval from the great majority,\r\nmotions of confidence and of thanks. Those burgher meetings were\r\nconvened during July and August.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Krüger is famous for employing clever and original similes in\r\norder to illustrate a policy as he wants his people to understand it.\r\n\r\nIt has already been noted that the Franchise Law of 1890 excluded\r\nUitlanders from full burgher rights until after twenty-one years'\r\nprobation. The reduction to seven years was proclaimed to be a\r\nconcession to meet Mr. Chamberlain's demand. The simile, as addressed to\r\nthe Volksraad and published in the journals, ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"First my coat was demanded of me, which I gave; next were asked my\r\nboots, vest, and trousers. I surrendered these as well; and now, as I\r\nstand in my bare shirt, my limbs are wanted besides.\"\r\n\r\nThe people were thus led to be unanimous in the resolve to oppose any\r\nfurther concession, and to view Sir Alfred Milner's unconditional\r\ninsistence for a five years' franchise as a conclusive proof that\r\nEngland in reality wanted no less than the country itself. In this way\r\nthe Boer mind was designedly fashioned into the conviction that war was\r\ninevitable, and that both President and people were absolved from all\r\nresponsibility in it. Had the offered franchise of seven years and the\r\nsubsequent one of five years been honestly meant, there should, indeed,\r\nhave been little difficulty for adjusting in the one case the difference\r\nof two years; but it being so surrounded by impossible trammels that\r\nwhat purported to be an egg proved more like a stone, and even that was\r\nnot intended to be given, it was a mere subterfuge to gain time for\r\ncarrying out Bond designs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALLIANCE OF ORANGE FREE STATE WITH TRANSVAAL--SUZERAINTY\r\nSQUABBLE--ARMAMENTS BEFORE JAMESON RAID\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project of alliance between the Transvaal and the Orange Free State\r\nhad been mooted before 1890. After that came conferences between the\r\nrespective Presidents and delegates for closer union as it was then\r\nstyled. Mr. John G. Fraser, one of the noblest and most distinguished\r\nOrange Free State statesmen, was conspicuous among the few opponents.\r\nHis arguments against federation were so logical and conclusive that it\r\nseemed for a while that the idea would have to be renounced. Among other\r\ngrounds adduced against that alliance was the fact that England\r\npossessed claims of suzerainty over the Transvaal, and, the Orange Free\r\nState itself being entirely independent, the incongruity and\r\nincompatibility were obvious of joining a vassal State. There was\r\ntrouble if not danger lurking behind it, if such two States were to join\r\nin an actual federation. Whatever was desirable for mutual advantage\r\nmight be attained without offensive and defensive alliance. The two\r\nGovernments, however, knew how to manipulate matters. The closer union\r\nscheme was carried through before the Jameson incursion, and soon after\r\nthat event an offensive and defensive alliance completed the federation.\r\nThe Afrikaner Bond then had advanced another important stage.\r\n\r\nMr. John G. Fraser's persistent objections to federation, upon the\r\nground that the Transvaal stood under British suzerainty, had given that\r\nquestion a prominence operating against the Afrikaner Bond project,\r\nviz., that of gaining a strong Power as ally to its cause. It was felt\r\nthat no Power could, with decency, enter into a connection with that\r\nState while such a claim was maintained. To overcome that obstacle the\r\nTransvaal Government proceeded to raise a controversy with England,\r\ntaking up the position of repudiating the claim of suzerainty, and\r\naverring the complete independence of the State, subject only to the one\r\nclause _re_ treaties with foreign nations. Another object would be\r\ngained, viz., of diverting England from Bond aims by that and similar\r\ncontroversies. To make a show of sincerity about it all, the opinions\r\n(foregathered, of course) of certain eminent jurists in England and\r\nHolland were obtained, who refuted the claim in elaborate disquisitions\r\nand with that readiness of apparent conviction so peculiar to some\r\nadvocates' affected faith in their clients' cause. Thus England was\r\ndecoyed into a protracted tournament of words and phrases without any\r\npractical result, but gratifying and inspiring no doubt to certain\r\nwell-paid _soi-disant_ champions of the principle defined as the\r\n\"_perfection of justice_,\" who revel in a display of forensic erudition,\r\nwhich, however, only illustrates to the unedified lay mind how speech is\r\nadaptable to veil inward conviction, and how a mass of rhetoric can be\r\nemployed to justify the breach of simple and well-understood\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\nIt continues to be clumsily insisted upon in official and paid Press\r\norgans how the need of providing Transvaal armaments became realized\r\nonly with that Anglo-capitalistic plot of 1895-96 against Boer\r\nindependence, and that, in fact, Dr. Jameson was worthy of the Boer\r\nnation's lasting gratitude for opening their eyes to their helplessly\r\nunarmed and unprepared condition up to that time. In those papers it is\r\ndeclared with unblushing inexactness how the Transvaal at that epoch\r\npossessed only two hundred and fifty inefficient and ill-equipped\r\nartillerists, with only a few cannons of various antiquated types, and\r\nhow the burgher element had, up to that time, continued unarmed and in\r\nunsuspecting insecurity. To stamp these misstatements as false, it needs\r\nonly to be considered that from the time of the Boer trek in 1835-38\r\nevery Boer had been a hunter and guerilla soldier possessed of the best\r\nfirearms then extant, ready at any sacrifice to provide still more\r\neffective weapons as inventions in arms of precision in turn progressed.\r\nHis passion to be well armed only equalled that of his love for land.\r\nFrom 1881 every Transvaal and Orange Free State Boer without exception\r\nhad, and was obliged to have, his Martini-Henry rifle. The Government\r\narsenals were supplied with reserves of that up to recently unsurpassed\r\nweapon and with large stores of ammunition. The authorities supplied\r\nthat rifle at £4 each, and even gratis in the case of indigent burghers.\r\nAt the frequent reviews (_wapenschouwingen_) each burgher had to appear\r\nmounted, with his Martini-Henry rifle and thirty rounds ammunition. To\r\nmaintain proficiency in rifle practice, prizes and honours were\r\ndistributed at Government expense in each ward, whilst there was plenty\r\nof private emulation encouraged among young and old in the science of\r\nsharp-shooting, the Governments of both Republics contributing\r\nammunition at below cost price.\r\n\r\nIn about 1893 the Transvaal Government introduced about 10,000 new\r\nrifles of the Guede pattern, firing a steel-pointed bullet, but the\r\nissue did not become general, as the Martini-Henry rifle continued to be\r\nheld more effective for game and for war. The Mauser rifle was only\r\nprovided, after long hesitation and much diffidence, for its\r\nrapid-firing quality in war, whereas for game it is still considered\r\ninferior to the larger bored Martini-Henry.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the Jameson incursion, the Transvaal had in readiness\r\nextensive parks of the most modern quick-firing Maxims and Nordenfeldts\r\nof various calibres, and breech-loading field artillery of the Krupp\r\nmake. The Orange Free State hurried to their assistance with similar\r\nartillery, each burgher armed with a Martini-Henry rifle. Besides all\r\nthat, there was the dynamite and explosives factory equipped to\r\nmanufacture all sorts of modern ammunition as it does now, and this is\r\nwhy President Krüger described that factory as one of the corner-stones\r\nof Boer independence. In the face of these facts it is a most singular\r\ndeparture to say that the Transvaal only thought of arming when becoming\r\nalarmed for the future by the Jameson attempt, and that statement could\r\nonly have been intended to mislead the uninformed at a distance. \"_Qui\r\ns'excuse s'accuse_\" is applicable in this as well as in other ruses for\r\nhiding those sinister Bond aims and to pose as the guileless and\r\nvictimized Boer nation. It was just the other way about--it was England\r\nwho was unprepared and exposed to imminent risk of aggression on the\r\npart of the Boer combination.\r\n\r\nWhat had amazed and actually exasperated many Boers was the ludicrously\r\npuny attempt made by Jameson and the Johannesburg revolutionary concert.\r\nIt was at the time thought that the invasion of some 700 men was only a\r\nfirst installment, and that much larger developments were in preparation\r\nto attack the State. It was for that reason that only a few batteries of\r\nartillery were despatched at a late moment to Doornkop under Commandant\r\nTrichaart to operate against Jameson's party, while the bulk was held in\r\nreserve with an extensive mobilization of burghers to resist other\r\nsupposed opposition of an altogether more formidable but yet undefined\r\ncharacter. When nothing further transpired, the feeling uppermost with\r\nthe people was unbounded derision at that impotent fiasco, and a\r\nloathing contempt for the cowering Johannesburg rabble who betrayed and\r\nsacrificed the insensate doctor. It was loudly asserted that the\r\ncombined forces of the two Republics were competent to resist an\r\ninvasion a hundred times stronger than the one so foolishly attempted;\r\nbut, with cooler counsels, it was resolved to adopt the appealing\r\nattitude of the deeply injured party who miraculously and providentially\r\nescaped a great national peril. Upon these lines the raid incident\r\nafforded an immense advantage to Afrikaner Bond tactics, and an impulse\r\nto Bond propaganda which enormously increased Boer partisanship,\r\ninflicting at the same time a fatal check upon the diplomacy of England\r\nand upon the essential peace-preserving measures for safeguarding her\r\nSouth African interests. The circumstances, however, served to embolden\r\nmany hitherto undecided sympathisers into openly declared and vehement\r\nBoer partisans, revealing the singular spectacle, among English people\r\neven, of a morbid cult apparently ready to sacrifice their nation just\r\nto vindicate their judicial dicta about Boer innocence and to parade\r\ntheir own darling sense of shocked and violated national honour.\r\n\r\nQuite other and more emphatic terms apply to the revolting sewerage such\r\nas the socialistic platform and other purulent nurseries for breeding\r\nwilful and hypocritical abettors, at so much a score, of misguided and\r\ntreason-hatching Afrikanerdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSVAAL DYNAMITE AND EXPLOSIVES MONOPOLY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe factory pertaining to this enterprise, situated near Pretoria, is\r\nrecognised to be the most extensive and best equipped of its kind in\r\nexistence. It is capable of turning out all the dynamite and similar\r\nblasting material needed for the gold and other mines of the State, also\r\nevery description of explosive needed for modern ammunition.\r\n\r\nIts equipments include ateliers and laboratories under the conduct of\r\neminent scientists and men of most advanced technical proficiency. The\r\nsite is a farm named Modderfontein of about 8,000 acres near Pretoria.\r\nThe industry provides employment for over 5,000 persons. In connection\r\nwith this factory is a foundry at Pretoria for casting shells, etc. The\r\nvarious ingredients, such as sulphur, guhr, saltpetre, etc., are\r\nbelieved to be plentiful in the State, but their exploitation is found\r\nto be more costly than it is to import the pure articles from Europe.\r\n\r\nThe investment is represented mostly by French and German shareholders,\r\nthe Transvaal Government also possessing a portion of the shares. The\r\ncontract with the State conveys a complete monopoly for the manufacture\r\nand importation of all descriptions of explosives, and is so framed as\r\nto base its subsistence upon international rights. One of the conditions\r\nis that the issue of ammunition is relegated to State control. In this\r\nmanner burghers only get supplies, whilst Uitlanders are limited to very\r\nsmall quantities for sporting purposes by special permits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOND FIGHTING STRENGTH IN BEGINNING OF 1899\r\n\r\nEfficiently      _Mounted Infantry._       At least about 142,000\r\ntrained.\r\n\r\n 15,000   Orange Free State, between 18-50\r\n             years  . . . . . . . . . . . . .  20,000\r\n\r\n 25,000   Transvaal, between 18-50 years  . .  30,000\r\n\r\n 40,000   Cape Colonies, between 18-50\r\n             years  . . . . . . . . . . . . .  60,000\r\n\r\n  2,000   Natal and elsewhere, between 18-50\r\n             years  . . . . . . . . . . . . .   2,000\r\n\r\n 18,000   Of above, aged 16-18 and 50-60  . .  30,000\r\n-------                                        ------\r\n100,000             _Artillery_  . . . . . . . . . . . . .  2,000\r\n\r\n    600   Orange Free State, including\r\n             trained reserves . . . . . . . .     600\r\n\r\n  1,400   Transvaal . . . . . . . . . . . . .   1,400\r\n-------                                         -----          -------\r\n102,000   . . . . . . . . . . .

We see\r\nthis in matters of language, religion, in certain antipathies, and even\r\nin attire. They are justly famed for hospitality, not only amongst\r\nthemselves, but also towards strangers, and a very pleasing trait, no\r\ndoubt handed down from the seigneurial Huguenots, is the genial\r\npoliteness which a stranger will receive in an otherwise wholly\r\nuncultured Boer family.\r\n\r\nOn his farm the Boer is chief and supreme after the patriarchal\r\nfashion--no thought of tolerating an equal or a rival in authority.\r\nCollectively also, as in governmental representation, he is extremely\r\naverse to the introduction of any foreign element; such a factor would\r\nmeet with his undisguised suspicion and jealousy. It must be Boer\r\nsupremacy, and to this strangers must submit; the Boers to figure as\r\nthe only caste or military aristocracy privileged to carry arms, very\r\nmuch like the Samouris nobles of Japan, who from of old until recently\r\nhad represented the feudal estate, and had made quite a famous cult of\r\npersonal bravery, chivalry and devotion to their Mikado and for their\r\nindependent caste. Long intercourse and inter-marriage with a Boer\r\nfamily would ultimately remove the barrier. With such rooted\r\nexclusiveness it is only in accord with Boer nature to be reluctant in\r\nadmitting Uitlanders to burgher franchise, and the greater their numbers\r\nand influence of wealth the more would they be viewed as an innovating\r\nmenace and their admittance to political equality be resisted.\r\n\r\nUpon newly occupied farms a Boer will always seek to locate one or more\r\nsquatters of his own nation upon allotments ultimately intended for the\r\noccupation of some of his own children as soon as they are grown up. The\r\nusual conditions for privileges of residence, grazing, and cultivation\r\nare that the squatter builds a dwelling and does all the other permanent\r\nimprovements at his own cost, that he accounts to the owner for half or\r\none-third of all products raised, and that he and his family should\r\nrender services whenever required. When the squatter acquires land of\r\nhis own he will in turn adopt similar feudal methods to get it improved\r\nand to obtain services without expense. Should the conditions accorded\r\nto the squatter result in advantages which prove any way lucrative to\r\nhim, the owner would in nine cases out of ten immediately impose more\r\nexacting conditions, upon the plea of making provision for his own\r\nchildren. Such dependants are otherwise treated with familiar equality,\r\nas are also other white employees, and are admitted at the common table\r\nlike any of the family, but below the salt.\r\n\r\nTo acquire farms is a Boer's greatest ambition. The love of land is his\r\nspecial passion, so that his children also may be independent owners of\r\nfarms. Formerly such land acquisitions were made by encroachments upon\r\nthe possessions of natives or by purchases from them and by barter, and\r\nfailing those means, by conquest. Since 1885, however, the stipulations\r\nin connection with the Anglo-Swaziland settlement effectually barred\r\nexpansion and encroachments in any direction. The Boers resent this\r\ncheck as an exceedingly sore point. There is not enough land for the\r\nsons who have since grown up. These cannot possibly compete with the\r\neducated Hollanders in quest of good positions, nor are they taught any\r\nhandicrafts, and the galling prospect is inevitable that they will have\r\nto content themselves with very humble stations in life, dependent even\r\nupon the more prosperous Uitlanders. No wonder these Boers fell an easy\r\nprey to the seductions and deceptive fallacies of the Afrikaner Bond\r\ndoctrine of conquest, for dispossessing England of her Colonies, and to\r\nresume a free hand for expansion northwards as well.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the stated inadequacy of spare land it is well to\r\nnote that, of the two Republics, the Transvaal only possesses\r\nundeveloped Government reserve land. This is all situated in more or\r\nless low-lying and fever-stricken parts, large tracts being absolutely\r\nuninhabitable for that reason, especially in summer. Some of the rest is\r\noccupied on terms of lease by burghers, and has up to the present\r\nafforded scope for some of the less aspiring class. About one-quarter of\r\nthe aggregate Transvaal farms are owned by Uitlander individuals or by\r\ncompanies who are mostly English. But the bulk of the land owned by\r\nburghers in both States has gradually become cut up by the process of\r\nsuccession into holdings so small as to admit of hardly any further\r\ndivision. There are, of course, numerous exceptions of wealthy farmers\r\nwho can still bequeath to each of their sons a whole farm of 6,000\r\nacres, or half a farm. In the face of these restrictive circumstances a\r\nscheme has been in preparation during the past years, promoted by the\r\nBond coterie in Holland and the Governments of the two Republics, to\r\neffect a large emigration from Holland to those States. A company has\r\nthus been formed, called \"Nederlandsche Emigratie Maatschappy voor\r\nTransvaal en Oranje Vry Staat.\" The prospectus describes the objects as\r\nagricultural, pastoral, and industrial, but, as \"members,\" only such are\r\ninvited as are disposed to join hands with the Boer cause. That scheme\r\ncame into operation before the outbreak of the war. What else does it\r\nreveal but a thinly veiled recruiting device for auxiliaries against\r\nEngland?\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n\r\nWhat has been said about the ignorance and illiteracy of the Boers may\r\nbe admitted to apply to the great majority of the grown-up and of the\r\nmore maturely aged population; those of youthful age have of late years\r\nhad the benefit of a better education than had before been possible to\r\nprovide. But the great drawback consists in the still very imperfect\r\nknowledge of High Dutch, and it will take many years yet before a more\r\ngeneral proficiency in that language will qualify the youth for more\r\nthan purely elementary studies. There are numerous exceptions, however,\r\nof very creditably educated Boers, whose parents have been able to get\r\nthem taught at Colonial schools, such as the Stellenbosch seminary, and\r\neven in Holland. Besides this, there are the children and grandchildren\r\nof the many educated Hollanders who have continued to stream into the\r\nRepublics since 1854, and who had the advantage of learning High Dutch\r\nfrom their parents. Those, as a rule, bestowed great attention to their\r\nchildren's education, and in many cases sent them to Holland to complete\r\ntheir studies. The greatest factor of the educated Dutch element in\r\nSouth Africa consists of the mass of Hollanders itself, who have made\r\ntheir way to the Republics, and especially to the Transvaal, during the\r\npast eighteen years, among whom are many of highest European\r\nattainments, so that altogether a big muster is made up of\r\nwell-instructed people, comparing well enough with other nations, and\r\nample to meet all the exigencies of the two rapidly developing\r\nRepublics. This educated contingent is being continuously supplemented\r\nby like arrivals from Holland, including eminent technical experts and\r\nscientists. It is a well-known feature that many chief posts of the\r\nadministration are filled by aged, uneducated burghers who are\r\naltogether without the qualification required for the exercise of their\r\nfunction, but this drawback is effectually remedied by the expedient of\r\nproviding proficient Hollanders as working adjuncts and secretaries, in\r\nwhich manner all the branches of the administration are nevertheless\r\nefficiently and most creditably served. Hundreds of young Boers are\r\nadmitted as supernumeraries into the various offices to prepare them for\r\nresponsible positions later on.\r\n\r\n\r\nDundee Secret Dossier\r\n\r\nThe greatest stir was made upon the discovery of secret documents left\r\nbehind by the British military at the hurried evacuation of Dundee\r\n(Natal).\r\n\r\nIt was made public that those documents contained all the details of a\r\nplan of invading the Orange Free State, and that it furnished most\r\nincontestable proofs of British designs as early as 1896 against the\r\nindependence of both Republics. It was promised to publish those\r\ndetails, but this has not yet been done. It appears, however, that no\r\nincriminating details exist. Nevertheless, the matter has been made to\r\nserve calumniating reports on a considerable scale in the pro-Boer Press\r\nabroad, declaring that those documents conveyed absolute proofs of\r\nEngland's perfidious intentions of attacking the Orange Free State\r\nunawares, whilst all the time professing friendly relations and\r\nundertaking to respect the complete integrity of the Republican status\r\nof both States. What actually has transpired is that the whole thing was\r\na mare's nest, simply and nothing more than military information under\r\ncover marked \"secret,\" giving topographical and other details upon the\r\nOrange Free State--a proceeding which is carried out by all military\r\nauthorities of any pretensions to prudent activity in the information\r\ndepartment, and no more construable into actual hostile intentions than\r\nare other geographical surveys for general instructions or for school\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe incident again shows the absence of tangible grounds for accusations\r\nagainst England when a foolish invention as the one cited must do duty\r\nfor such, and to rekindle race hatred.\r\n\r\nThe interest and the manipulation devoted to that fabrication by the\r\npro-Boer Press have, however, scored another success to Bond propaganda\r\nin fixing the belief with Boer partisans, of England's really\r\npredetermined designs to annex both Republics. Every Boer has since been\r\nmore than ever so persuaded, the conviction fanning the fervour of\r\npatriotism and stimulating his eagerness to resist the would-be\r\nravishers of his country.\r\n\r\nConsidering, on the other hand, that the English Government had known\r\nmuch about the Afrikaner Bond menace, it is singular that precautionary\r\nmeasures had halted with that bare effort of making military\r\nobservations. The only way to account for this apparent lethargic\r\ninaction is the assumption that a persevering patience and friendly\r\nattitude was expected in time to effectually dissipate all trouble in\r\nSouth Africa, and that a display of anxiety or of force would have\r\nfrustrated such peaceable tactics. In refutation of the aspersion\r\nagainst England, it may be sufficient to point to the fact that during\r\nthose very years (1896-7) both Republics were in a condition of complete\r\nhelplessness through the rinderpest scourge which was then raging. If\r\nany hostile designs had in reality existed they could have been carried\r\nout with utmost ease then, as that scourge presented no obstacle to\r\nEngland. But it was the programme of peace which was pursued as\r\nundeviatingly then as since, with a constancy which refused to be\r\nfoiled.\r\n\r\n\r\nPamphlet entitled _A Hundred Years of Injustice_\r\n\r\nA mass of so-called proof against England of her guilt in provoking the\r\npresent war and justifying the Boer attitude was presented to the public\r\nin South Africa and abroad in November last in the shape of a voluminous\r\npamphlet entitled _A Hundred Years of Injustice_ (published both in\r\nEnglish and Dutch, and later even translated into French). That\r\nproduction covers Boer history and its troubles with England up to 1881.\r\nIt then travels over the diplomatic appeals of the Transvaal delegation,\r\nwhich resulted in the renewed convention of 1884. Then it wades through\r\nall the mire of academic squabble _re_ suzerainty, etc. After exhausting\r\nthe Jameson episode with bitter invective, and seeking applause for the\r\nTransvaal Government for its professed desire to conciliate and to\r\npropitiate England by the offer of a seven years' franchise, the reader\r\nis, in conclusion, 'treated to a literary display of pyrotechnic\r\ndenunciations and prophetic burdens against wicked Albion, with appeals\r\nto divine justice for righting the cause of an innocent nation so foully\r\ndriven to a war of pure self-defence.\r\n\r\nLest he be taken unawares the reader of that pamphlet would do well to\r\nnote the significant fact in connection with those preferred accusations\r\nand aspersions that not a single act construable to the prejudice of\r\nEngland is adduced dating after the Anglo-Transvaal peace of 1881, that\r\npeace which had been mutually understood to close up all by-gones. But\r\nthe recriminations all revert to previous history, nothing having\r\noccurred since 1881 to form real grounds for accusations. There had, on\r\nthe contrary, been an exhibition of unwearied friendly endeavours on the\r\npart of Great Britain to maintain loyal peace with an ever-shifty and\r\ntruculent Government, and to induce it to desist from scandalous\r\nintrigue against imperial interests in South Africa, and to adopt a more\r\nrational attitude towards Uitlanders, which in itself would have\r\nprecluded troubles like that of the Johannesburg revolt and the Jameson\r\nraid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD FREE STATER'S ADMONITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctrines of the Afrikaner Bond coterie have been so assiduously and\r\ndeeply instilled into the Boer mind that demonstrations are utterly\r\nfutile in shaking the national conviction of the divinely approved\r\njustice of his cause. The first occasion when I saw this illustrated,\r\nand also the people's unreasoning adherence to their leaders' opinions,\r\nhappened about ten years ago at burgher meetings which had been convened\r\nto discuss the then projected law for restraining Uitlanders from\r\nadmission to Transvaal franchise and other political topics.\r\n\r\nAn old Free State burgher was led then and subsequently to express his\r\nviews upon the subject in about the following strain: \"It is our duty to\r\nguard our nation against being swamped out or supplanted by strangers;\r\nthey are in great force already, and their number will constantly\r\nincrease, yet what attracts them, as you know, is our gold. That will\r\ngive out eventually, when the majority will again depart. Those\r\nstrangers, who then elect to remain with us, might be admitted to full\r\nburgher rights. In the meantime it behoves us to reserve the full\r\nfranchise, nor will many aspire to it if they are only treated well as\r\nstrangers should be, as we should wish to be treated if we were in their\r\nplace. This is what they expect from us, and it can well be done without\r\ngiving full franchise, which they indeed do not need and will then not\r\nclaim. They will be content if their own interests are not hampered or\r\ninterfered with, and will be satisfied with such rights and privileges\r\nas are reasonably due to guests, and we may say welcome guests (for it\r\nis plain that the land is also largely benefited by their presence). In\r\nother respects let us support law and order to suppress evil, which they\r\ndesire as well as we do.\r\n\r\n\"Does the Bible not say, 'The Lord loveth the stranger?' so also then\r\nmust we; and again, 'Thou shalt not devise mischief against the stranger\r\nwho dwelleth in peace with thee.' We are reputed as a God-fearing\r\npeople. Is it not well that we should take great care to act in\r\naccordance? But I have observed with shame that instead of love and\r\npeace a spirit of hatred and strife has been allowed to gain upon us.\r\nLet us strive to expel that evil, lest we fall under God's displeasure\r\nand forfeit His favour. We cannot afford to lose that.\"\r\n\r\nAt this stage the speaker was interrupted by violent remarks about\r\nEngland's incurable perfidy and the like, when he added, prolonging his\r\nspeech more than he had probably intended: \"Yes, we may not trust\r\nEngland, but what we must do is to trust in God. Did God not pull us\r\nthrough all along? was it not He who provided the peace of 1881 which\r\nrestored our independence? And can that gracious Lord, if we only let\r\nHim act, not also protect us against any wiles and dangers if such\r\nshould occur in the future? As yet none such have arisen. The Lord was\r\nwith us in our battles for liberty; He was equally present and prompted\r\nthe sense and conditions of that very convention of 1881, which the\r\npeople were subsequently dissatisfied with and in their own wisdom\r\nsacrificed for that of 1884. It is just possible that that presumptuous\r\nact of wanting to improve upon the Lord's work will result in trouble\r\nand prove to our sorrow that we have simply tampered and tinkered with a\r\ngood thing and spoilt it to our hurt.\r\n\r\n\"'Thou shalt not provoke thy children to wrath lest they be discouraged\r\nand be tempted to do evil,' applies specially also to the duties of\r\nGovernments. Our rulers need wisdom in this direction, and will be\r\nresponsible if our strangers are subjected to unfair laws. The older\r\npeople here will call to mind, when the old voortrekkers were obliged to\r\ngo hundreds of miles, as far as Pietermaritzburg, for their supplies,\r\nthat we prayed for shopkeepers in our land so that we might be spared\r\nthose long journeys. What was done soon after we had attracted strangers\r\nto establish businesses with us? We were seduced to deliberately attempt\r\ntheir ruin by starting those _nationale Boerenwinkels_ (national Boer\r\nstores), supported by our own capital, but governed by Hollanders who\r\neventually squandered our money. Was that dealing fairly by confiding\r\nstrangers? Later on, again in response to our prayers, we got railways;\r\nskilled men and much capital from foreign countries, first to prospect\r\nfor gold and then to develop and exploit the mines. Their labour and\r\nhard-earned money were risked when the return was still problematic.\r\nShall we begrudge them their successes now, seeing that our whole land\r\nis equally enriched at the same time, and but for them and their\r\nenterprise the gold would still be lying uselessly hidden in the depths\r\nof the ground? There are now, in 1890, over 100,000 such strangers in\r\nthe land, and probably over 200 millions capital invested. Shall they be\r\ntreated in a manner to justify the accusation that they were inveigled\r\ninto our land with the object of despoiling them afterwards after the\r\nstyle of 'Come into my parlour, says the spider to the fly'? These\r\npeople count upon our honest friendship, especially the many English\r\namong them who ground that confidence upon the honourable peace accorded\r\nus in 1881. Shall we deceive them? May we hate them for old questions\r\nwhich that peace was intended to bury for ever? Think of the Lord's\r\ndealings with our people--poor, wandering, and despised at first. He had\r\nblessings in store for the tried voortrekkers and their children. 'The\r\nbeggar was raised from the dunghill [_asch-hoop, i.e._, ash-heap, was\r\nthe word he used] to sit with princes'--'a table laid for us in the\r\nsight of our enemies.' All this is literally fulfilled. Our President\r\nand others representing us have been to Europe and sat with princes, and\r\nwe have a country full of riches enough to make any enemy to rage with\r\njealousy at the sight. Who else but the devil is that enemy? It is he\r\nwho persecuted our Dutch and Huguenot ancestors for their faith, and is\r\npursuing us since. It is he and his army that rage the most at our\r\nunexampled blessings. It is he who wants us to forfeit them all and the\r\nLord's favour as well. It emanates from the evil one that so many among\r\nus are seduced into wicked political plans to subvert authority\r\ninstalled by God, to incite our brethren to sedition in the Colonies,\r\nwanting to dispossess the English. For the Queen's Government there is\r\nas much from God as are the authorities over us here and in the Orange\r\nFree State.\r\n\r\n\"God saith by Solomon (Prov. xxiv. 21-22): 'My son, fear thou the Lord\r\nand the king; and meddle not with them that are given to change: for\r\ntheir calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the destruction of\r\nthem both?'\" and he finally warned them of the risk they incurred, after\r\nhaving been advanced and blessed in an unexampled way, of being flung\r\nback to their previous ignoble position upon the ash heap. There are\r\nplenty of respectable Boers in whose ears those expressions still\r\ntingle.\r\n\r\nThe man, who is no speaker, was, nevertheless, apt to grow warm and\r\nimpressive, drawn out probably by interruptions and opposing views. The\r\nspeeches terminated on one occasion by one of the party saying in\r\nviolent Bond fashion: \"The English hired the Zulus to massacre our\r\npeople. They robbed us of Natal, and drove us from the Colonies. There\r\ncan be no peace with them until we have our own. God helps them who help\r\nthemselves. Whoever takes their part is against us and against every\r\ntrue Afrikaner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MODUS VIVENDI_ SUGGESTED BY OLD FREE STATER\r\n\r\n\r\nAs is known, the conference between Sir Alfred Milner and President\r\nKrüger, assisted by President Steyn, took place at Bloemfontein during\r\nthe first days of June last (1899), and resulted in the refusal to a\r\ndemand of a five years' franchise made on behalf of the Transvaal\r\nUitlanders, which refusal was some time later modified by enacting a law\r\nadmitting them to full burgher rights after a probation of seven years,\r\nbut coupled with restrictive forms and conditions which made that\r\nmeasure unacceptable. Some time before that conference the old Free\r\nStater already mentioned obtained several prolonged interviews with the\r\nhon. State Secretary Reitz, at Pretoria, with the object of dissuading\r\nthe Transvaal Government from conferring with Sir Alfred Milner while as\r\nyet no sufficient friendly _rapprochement_ had been reached and no\r\nadvance had been made as to mutually approved bases upon which to\r\nconfer. He strongly deprecated the idea of granting \"full\" burgher\r\nrights to Uitlanders, but held that their needs and wishes could be met\r\nby allowing their interests to be amply represented without impinging\r\nupon the special privileges which should be reserved for the burgher\r\nstatus proper. He was finally invited by Mr. Reitz to submit his scheme\r\nin writing, with the promise that it should receive careful\r\nconsideration. That old Free Stater complied, and supplied President\r\nKrüger with a duplicate separately as well. The scheme ran in substance\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Modus vivendi_\"\r\n\r\nThe population of the Transvaal to be divided into two classes, pending\r\nthe continued presence of the large floating portion consisting of\r\nUitlanders who derive their subsistence from the mining industries,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n1st Class.--The fixed or burgher estate.\r\n\r\n2nd Class.--The floating or alien estate or Guests.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Volksraad to be elected by burghers only, and to represent the\r\nhighest legislative and administrative powers.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd Volksraad to be elected by Uitlanders and burghers, and to be\r\nvested with all such reasonable legislative powers as will cover the\r\ndomestic, industrial, and vocative interests of both burghers and\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nThe Uitlander franchise shall be limited to representation in the 2nd\r\nVolksraad, and be extended under usual fair conditions of eligibility to\r\nall white persons after two years' residence, retrospectively reckoned.\r\n\r\nAliens may be admitted to full burgher rights and vote for 1st\r\nVolksraad, President, and Commandant-General, after five years'\r\nresidence, if approved of by two-thirds of the burghers of his ward,\r\npossesses landed property to the value of £1,000, and has not been\r\nconvicted here or elsewhere of any degrading crime.\r\n\r\nMembers of both Volksraads and for public service shall be eligible\r\nwithout respect of creed.\r\n\r\nThe exploitation of mines shall be subject to a tax of 25 per cent.,\r\nreckoned upon the yearly net profits, such revenue to be applied at the\r\ndiscretion of the 1st Volksraad solely for the benefit of the burgher\r\nestate--schools, hospitals, universities, pensions, by means of\r\npermanent endowments.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the Transvaal undertakes:--\r\n\r\n1. There shall be no identification or co-operation permitted, on the\r\npart of any of the Transvaal people, with the association known as the\r\nAfrikaner Bond, or any such-like political complot.\r\n\r\n2. The recognition of British paramountcy over South Africa, including\r\nthe Transvaal, in so far as it does not clash with the intentions and\r\nprovisions set forth in the conventions of 1881 and 1884, and does not\r\nextend to interference with or curtailment of complete internal\r\nautonomy.\r\n\r\n3. Renunciation of indemnity claim _re_ Jameson incursion.\r\n\r\n4. To regulate the question of coloured British subjects resident in the\r\nTransvaal upon a genial basis, irrespective of the Bloemfontein\r\narbitration award upon that subject.\r\n\r\n5. Poll and war taxes shall be abolished.\r\n\r\n6. Dual rights equal with the Dutch language shall be accorded to the\r\nEnglish language, similarly as is done in the Cape Colony for Dutch.\r\n\r\n7. The railways and dynamite factory to be expropriated as soon as\r\npossible--the loans required thereto to be amortized within twenty\r\nyears, and pending those expropriations the freights upon coal and\r\noversea goods shall be reduced 10 per cent, and the price of explosives\r\n20s. per case, these reductions to be met from the revenue accruing to\r\nthe burgher estate from the tax upon mining profits.\r\n\r\n8. To join a general Customs union upon equitable conditions.\r\n\r\n9. Restore the High Court to independent power in terms of constitution.\r\n\r\nThe sequel has shown that Bond counsels prevailed over the suggestions\r\nof that old Free Stater. As to the seven years' franchise offered under\r\nthe pretence and colour of meeting Sir Alfred Milner's demand, it had\r\nclearly been intended to serve as a decoy and stop-gap pending the\r\ncontemplated war of conquest, and to mask Bond duplicity while further\r\npreparations were to be completed in diplomacy abroad and in the\r\nseditious conspiracy in the Colonies. Natal was at that time swarming\r\nwith Boer emissaries, and Transvaal artillery officers with Hollander\r\nengineers in disguise were seen inspecting Laing's Nek tunnel and other\r\nstrategic points in that colony.\r\n\r\nNot knowing at the time that State Secretary Reitz was an inveterate\r\nBondman, that old Free State patriot had roundly denounced to him the\r\nwickedness of Bond aims, and added the remark that the establishment of\r\na united Boer Republic apart from British supremacy in South Africa was\r\na deceptive dream. England has a mission in Africa--that of the Boers\r\ncan only be subordinate to it. It would need the aid of a powerful\r\nmaritime combination to supplant England. The case of America does not\r\npresent an analogy; there England only was actually interested, but here\r\nvarious other nations were concerned in their respective huge\r\ninvestments. They would have a voice in the business. Armed intervention\r\nwould lead to a big European war and extreme misery to entire\r\nAfrica--just what the devil wants, but not the investor. Indiscriminate\r\nfranchise will cause the loss of national independence, and so might\r\nultimately cosmopolize and obliterate their distinctive nationality, but\r\nso would also a war with England, with the total sacrifice of their\r\nindependence into the bargain. Let the Government rather prove to\r\nEngland its sincere friendship and agree to deal well by the Uitlanders,\r\ntreating them as privileged guests, then the unhappy strain in relations\r\nwill cease. Above all, renounce that wicked Afrikaner Bond with its\r\nmotto of conquest. The demand for franchise is England's device of\r\nself-protection against Bond designs. England will desist from that\r\ndemand if we renounce the Bond and prove our friendship.\r\n\r\nThat old Free Stater had moreover expressed his most earnest conviction\r\nthat a _modus vivendi_ upon the lines suggested would find ready\r\nconsideration as an alternative to the five years' franchise demand,\r\nand that the British Government would hail with the utmost satisfaction\r\nand relief any tentative towards a sound _rapprochement_ based upon the\r\ncontentment of the Boer people within the areas of their Republics and\r\nwhich would terminate Bond aspirations for Boer supremacy in South\r\nAfrica. Had he been permitted, the old Free Stater would gladly have\r\ncalled upon the British agent at Pretoria, Mr. Conyngham Greene, and\r\nfelt confident that the _modus vivendi_ would lead finally to a complete\r\ncessation of British interference and to best relations and prosperous\r\nconditions for all instead. He also cautioned the Government at\r\nPretoria, giving chapter and verse, against counting upon \"the arm of\r\nman.\" They would find they had trusted on reeds--it would be so in\r\nregard to any foreign help, and even in regard to men of their own\r\nnation in the Cape Colony.\r\n\r\nDuring one of the interviews Mr. Reitz had remarked that he had a\r\nspecial theory in regard to the situation; but it varied from that of\r\nthe President, who, in reality, was King, and whose will overcame all\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAMBERLAIN'S POLICY TO AVERT WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeing that twenty years of patient, loyal endeavours and friendly\r\nconciliatory proceedings following upon the rehabilitation of the\r\nTransvaal independence had utterly failed in advancing the object of\r\nuniting the English and Boer races, and that instead the existing gulf\r\nwas ever widening through the spread of those fell Afrikaner Bond\r\ndoctrines, it had become imperative, on the part of British statesmen,\r\nto employ special efforts to overcome the serious menace hanging over\r\nSouth Africa. The critical situation designedly brought about by the\r\naction of the Transvaal Government and by the influence of the Bond\r\nparty indicated the remedy. A liberal franchise in favour of the\r\nUitlanders would at one stroke correct that evil, and counteract the\r\nother impending danger as well. With a large accession of legitimized\r\nvoters working in accord with England's desire for peace and progress,\r\nthat good influence would be potent, first to shackle Bond action and\r\nultimately to reduce it to Colonial limits. The Transvaal would then no\r\nlonger be the giant ally, the arsenal, and the treasury of the Afrikaner\r\nBond, and that organisation would then be checkmated into impotence for\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nThe success of such a remedial and defensive measure would naturally\r\ndepend upon the adequacy of the franchise aimed at. Mr. Chamberlain and\r\nhis colleagues were not a little sanguine in expecting that a five\r\nyears' qualification for voting and a representation equal to one-fifth\r\nof the total number of seats in the Legislature would be effective for\r\nall that which was needed; nor could it be averred that the Transvaal\r\nburghers would be swamped out thereby.\r\n\r\nThe Bond chiefs did not fail to at once penetrate the object when the\r\ndemand for a five years' franchise was made, and in vain did Sir Alfred\r\ndisplay that firm attitude and exhaust his arguments at the historic\r\nBloemfontein conference. He had pointed out to President Krüger in a\r\nrudimentary fashion which was no doubt convincing enough--that it was\r\nincompatible with professions of concord and desire for peace while\r\npersisting in excluding from representation a large majority of the\r\npopulation accustomed to and expecting liberal treatment, and which,\r\nmoreover, held four-fifths of the wealth invested in the State. There\r\ncould be no other result than a dangerous tension and alienation from\r\nthe Government, instead of the peaceful co-operation so essential to\r\nsecurity and progress. In these days of advanced ideas of personal and\r\npolitical liberty people will resist domination by a minority. They want\r\nto be consulted, and to have at least the opportunity of making their\r\nwishes known by means of representation. The right of petitioning could\r\nnot meet that need, and in fact implied the recognition of an inferior\r\nstatus so repugnant to any one's sensibility. When people are ignored\r\nthey resent even light impositions and taxes, but if allowed a voice\r\nwill cheerfully submit to heavy burdens, because they then become, in a\r\nmanner, self-imposed. Representation is the panacea against popular\r\ndisaffection and for assuring governmental stability. To concede to\r\nUitlanders one-fifth of the seats in the Legislature could not operate\r\nto the prejudice of burgher interests, but less would not meet the case.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, not President Krüger alone who had to decide--it\r\naffected the Bond as a whole. The diplomatic contest so far proved just\r\nthe thing to ripen conditions for the meditated Bond _coup d'état_. An\r\nalternative offer of a seven years' franchise was interposed as a mere\r\nruse. Never for a moment did the Afrikaner Bond leaders waver or quail\r\nin the face of resolute firmness, display of force, or even of moral\r\npressure and notes of advice from imposing quarters, as Mr. Chamberlain\r\nhad at first still fondly hoped. To the Bond it had all resolved itself\r\nto a mere question of time, of choosing the most opportune moment when\r\nto assume the aggressive. British attitude had only hastened the issue.\r\nMr. Jan Hofmeyer had indeed been sent for from the Cape so as to assure\r\nthat section of the Bond of Transvaal firmness, but he found no sign of\r\nflinching or of renouncing the common object laboured for so long and\r\nthen so near fruition. The only difficulty was that British action had\r\nhastened the issue somewhat too fast. Hence the repeated hurried visits\r\nof the Bond leaders--Jan Hofmeyer, Abraham Fisher, and others--the\r\nfrequent caucus meetings of the Executive in consultation with those\r\ndelegates, the secret midnight sessions of the combined Volksraads and\r\nExecutive, the prolonged telegraphic conferences between the two\r\nPresidents, and the final resulting word of \"ready\" which preceded the\r\nfatal war ultimatum. The Gordian knot had been in evidence many years\r\nago; it is now recognised with regret that England had deferred action\r\nfor cutting it much too long.\r\n\r\nBut why not agree to arbitration, it will be asked, that peaceable\r\nmethod so strenuously appealed for by the Transvaal Government and\r\nadvocated by her partisans, to adjust all differences, of which the\r\nsuzerainty claim and the Uitlander question appeared to be the principal\r\nones? The reply is not that England was unwilling, but because the\r\nTransvaal was insincere, and the request was a cover for shameless\r\nduplicity, for, while it had been declared by the former that the claim\r\nto suzerainty would be left in abeyance and that infractions of\r\nconvention which had been committed by the latter would be overlooked in\r\nconsideration of future friendly relations and co-operation, the\r\nTransvaal Government in reality never for a moment meant to be content\r\nwith less than British overthrow and complete Boer supremacy in South\r\nAfrica, and efforts and intrigues were never relaxed, in concert with\r\nthe Bond, to compass those objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFRIKANER BOND GUILT IN GRADATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe promiscuous details and incidents, together with the circumstantial\r\nand _primâ facie_ evidence thus far adduced in arraigning the Afrikaner\r\nBond combination, point mostly to conditions existent before the war\r\nbroke out. We had the smoke before the conflagration--it is a wonder how\r\npeople could manage to ignore the menace. Now the war torch is over us\r\nin its full luridness.\r\n\r\nOrdinary fires, if not kindled, originate either from accident,\r\nspontaneous combustion, or incendiarism. With war the origin may be\r\ntraced to similar causes either singly or in combination, or, when we\r\ncannot hit the exact diagnosis, we explain it with a handy word and call\r\nit evolution, as we may do in the case of the present Anglo-Boer\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nWe may for a moment review the material and then also the agencies and\r\nincentives which operated that evolution against harmony and peace, and\r\nto which the conflagration is due. We have noted the legal acquisition\r\nof the Cape Colonies by Great Britain, the equally recognised occupation\r\nunder treaties with England of the two Boer Republics, the English and\r\nBoer races in progress of friendly assimilation and in happy prosperity\r\nall over South Africa. This was essentially the position in 1881, until\r\nit became gradually marred by an invidious element. We have further\r\nnoted the declining condition of Holland, its moribund language, and\r\nfinally the prospects which South Africa presented for that nation's\r\nrestoration to powerful significance, the English factor only standing\r\nin the way.\r\n\r\nThe next aspect brings out the marring manifestations: greed of land and\r\nof conquest with the Pretoria-Bloemfontein combination; malignant\r\nsedition in the Cape Colonies, urged by lust to participate more\r\ndirectly in the wealth of gold and diamonds in the north and to share\r\ngeneral plunder--both categories of covetousness merged into one\r\npurulent fester by men of conceited ambition, all cemented with\r\ncollusion, but the whole of it devised, engineered, and operated by the\r\nmost malignant agencies from Holland under the coaching of the evil one\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe reader may be able to assess the degrees of guilt of each\r\ncategory--of the Republican Boer aspirant for land, the Colonial Boer\r\nrebel seeking his particular profit, the accomplices who for ambitious\r\nends lead the first two, and the insidious Hollander intriguers who\r\nseduced and actuated all in order to seize the lion's share of the\r\nspoliation.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the respective rewards which lured them all are: Plunder for\r\nthe Boers and rebels, laurels and \"fat\" places for the Bond leaders, and\r\na substantial harvest for entire Holland, with pæans of praise for the\r\ncoterie and Dr. Leyds from a grateful people for successfully restoring\r\nthe good fortunes of the Dutch nation, and for effecting a retributive\r\nvendetta upon England, all under world-wide, gloating acclaims of\r\ngratified and vindictive jealousy.\r\n\r\nThe Hollander coterie may plead patriotism which pointed to the duty of\r\nusing the tempting opportunity presented in South Africa in saving\r\nHolland from national submersion and political extinction by means of\r\nthe Boer nation, but against this stands the unparalleled vileness of\r\nexpedients and the treacherous deceptions employed to attain that\r\nobject. It involved the wholesale seduction of one section of that\r\nnation into sedition and rebellion against a most beneficent and just\r\nGovernment under which they prospered and enjoyed the highest\r\nconceivable degree of liberty and even special privileges, and of\r\npitting the other section into hostility and war against a Power which\r\nmeant nothing else than peace and amity towards them, thus placing both\r\ninto a position of risk to forfeit all their prosperity, apart from the\r\ninevitable horrors of a war evoked by their rapacious and murderous\r\nHollander malice.\r\n\r\nThe Bond scientists in Holland had fully persevered in their craftily\r\nlaid programme. After having succeeded in producing race hatred between\r\nBoer and English, the next step had been to convince the Boer leaders\r\nand the people of the inevitableness of a contest for ensuring the\r\nsupremacy of the Afrikaners, coupled with the absolute necessity of the\r\ncomplete expulsion of the entire British element. As arguments were\r\nadduced that the British element had proved itself unassimilable and\r\nirreconcilable, its retention in South Africa would necessitate\r\ncontinuous provisions to keep it in a state of subjection. The existence\r\nof such conditions would be inconsistent and incompatible with the true\r\nideal liberty as intended for the whole of South Africa, and which must\r\nbe linked with all-round equality and fraternity. The presence of a\r\nBritish factor would be an unsurmountable bar to that consummation,\r\nhence the necessity of its total removal.\r\n\r\nThe Bond leaders are the next in guilt; with these the incentive is\r\nprincipally ambition, which, by degrees, became mis-shaped into a\r\nspecious patriotism. It is known how an ardently desired object pursued\r\nfor a long period is apt to so monopolize and infatuate the mind as to\r\ntotally vitiate and pervert the sense of discernment between right and\r\nwrong, both as to the legitimacy of the object and the means to be\r\nemployed for its attainment. As the realization remains deferred and the\r\nefforts are increased, the object from being considered legitimate is by\r\ndegrees invested with merit, a halo of virtue is added to the aspect,\r\nits pursuit is viewed as a duty by fair or by questionable means, the\r\nend justifying the latter. All, it is said, is fair in love and warfare.\r\nThis diagnosis appears particularly applicable to President Krüger and\r\nState Secretary F.W. Reitz, both men of sincere piety (perhaps also to\r\nMr. Schreiner), who would have abandoned their project and renounced and\r\nrepudiated the Afrikaner Bond if ever they had doubted its legitimacy of\r\nprinciple. So also with most of the other Boer leaders and their clergy\r\ntoo. The agencies must have been exceedingly subtle, and the jugglery\r\nand artifice superhuman, to operate such processes of reasoning, such\r\ndeception and aberration in honest-minded and even godly persons.\r\n\r\nAs to the bulk of the Boer people, they are simply led by their chiefs\r\nand superiors, in whom they repose unquestioning confidence. They go\r\nunreasoningly with the stream of opinion under the firm belief that all\r\nis divinely sanctioned, including rebellion and violence, and blindly\r\nobey their call, considering their cause analogous to that of the Jews\r\nof old, who were enjoined to spoil the Egyptians and then to pass over\r\nand conquer their land of promise. No papal bull of indulgence ever\r\nfreed people's consciences more than the Boer people now feel in regard\r\nto the warfare in which they are engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRÉSUMÉ\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boers in the Cape Colonies have been prospering in a marked degree\r\nsince the British accession in 1814, enjoying ideal liberty and good\r\ngovernment upon perfect equality with the English colonists.\r\n\r\nThe people of the Orange Free State fared equally well under best\r\nrelations with the British Government up to the outbreak of the present\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIn the Transvaal the Boers were more handicapped, being furthest removed\r\nfrom profitable Cape connections, and having to cope with powerful\r\nhostile tribes within their border. The most redoubtable, under\r\nSecoecoenie, was subdued during the British occupation in 1878. Then\r\nfollowed the short war of 1880, with the voluntary retrocession and\r\npeace of January, 1881. All appeared to progress remarkably well for\r\nabout ten years after, until the irrational treatment by the Boers of\r\nBritish subjects in the Transvaal furnished the first cause of\r\nfriction, and engendered at last the Johannesburg crisis with the\r\nJameson incursion, followed by four years' vain attempts on the part of\r\nEngland to bring about satisfactory and peaceful relations.\r\n\r\nThe Afrikaner Bond had been inaugurated some thirty years ago, under the\r\nmask of a constitutional organization, professing loyalty to England;\r\nthat body had succeeded in hiding its object, which was no less than the\r\nexpulsion from South Africa of all that is English, and which object was\r\nbrutally avowed since the outbreak of the war by declarations in the\r\nPress and by incendiary speeches of Colonial Bond leaders and members of\r\nthe Cape Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe British Government did not view very seriously the information it\r\nreceived regarding the Bond menace until the definite action of the\r\nTransvaal Government partially opened its eyes prior to the Johannesburg\r\nrevolt. The hope was, however, still clung to in an undefined way that\r\npatience and forbearance would yet overcome Boer prejudice and disperse\r\nracial antipathies, and with characteristic self-confidence as well,\r\nthings were allowed to drift rather out of hand.\r\n\r\nThe two Republics had been _de facto_ allied some time before the\r\nJohannesburg crisis in 1895. Both were then already provided with very\r\nabundant armaments of up-to-date types, with equipments and preparations\r\nfar and away above any conceivable needs except indeed for a _coup\r\nd'état_ against British supremacy and to sustain a Colonial revolt.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the Jameson incursion the Orange Free State promptly\r\nappeared near the scene with best equipped mounted Boer commandoes and\r\nartillery to assist the Transvaal if needed.\r\n\r\nBefore 1881 and some time subsequently there had been continued progress\r\ntowards the assimilation of the English and Boer races in South Africa.\r\nThis was marred by Afrikaner Bond doctrines and intrigues proceeding\r\nfrom a Hollander coterie, the formula being \"Afrika voor de\r\nAfrikaners\"--the aims including the usurpation of British authority in\r\nthe Colonies, supremacy of the Boer nation under one great Republican\r\nfederation, and an affiliated status with Holland which should restore\r\nthat people, all to the prejudice of England, to a political and\r\neconomic significance and power surpassing its former epoch of European\r\nand Colonial eminence. As to the incentives to the Boer nation, these\r\nwere principally the plunder of capital investments and land conquests,\r\nwhich the people had learnt to consider legitimate and in fact\r\nincumbent as a duty to themselves and descendants.\r\n\r\nThe means employed in that conspiracy were a subtle, so to say, occult\r\npropaganda to seduce a simple people to false convictions, to induce the\r\ncreation of gigantic armaments, a secret service employing at a vast\r\ncost journalism, emissaries, and agencies, to gain partisans and allies\r\noutside South Africa, the Transvaal mint to coin the sinews of war from\r\nthe appropriation of the mines and their output, the dynamite factory\r\n(that Bond corner-stone for manufacturing ammunition[11]), a system of\r\nimmigration from Holland towards supplanting the English factor and to\r\nintroduce auxiliaries. Other such means were: laws for admitting\r\nauxiliaries to immediate full burgher rights and privilege to carry\r\narms, from which Uitlanders were rigorously excluded, the rabid campaign\r\nproscribing the English language and fostering High Dutch instead (which\r\nwas much less understood by the entire Boer people, and much harder for\r\nthem to learn than English). To the above list of devices came the\r\nexhaustive efforts to obtain an independent seaport for the Transvaal,\r\nfirst at St. Lucia Bay, then at Delagoa Bay (ostensibly with a German\r\nsyndicate, and since by subsidizing Portugal or suborning Portuguese\r\nnotables and officials).\r\n\r\nThe climax of duplicity is reached when it is averred that the pursuit\r\nof such an organized programme during the past twenty years and more had\r\nmeant peace only, never a thought of conquest, as Ambassador Leyds so\r\ninnocently declared after failing to gain abroad the hoped-for support\r\nfor the monstrous Bond enormity.\r\n\r\nThe Afrikaner Bond leaders would have preferred the war to have been\r\ndeferred a little longer--preferably to a moment when England might be\r\nembroiled elsewhere. It was also thought of importance that the\r\nTransvaal should first realize the auriferous \"underground rights\"\r\nsituated around the Johannesburg mines, which Government asset was\r\nexpected to net at least fifty million pounds sterling. The sales had\r\nalready been advertised, and were in preparation when the outbreak of\r\nthe war intervened. Upon the word \"ready,\" flashed from Bloemfontein,\r\nfollowed at once the fateful Pretoria ultimatum. The proceeds of those\r\nunderground rights must now come in afterwards to defray the war bill.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: President Krüger's reference to that factory is well\r\nknown, styling it as one of the corner-stones of Boer independence.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOERS' NATIVE POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\nBoer views regarding coloured peoples are those retained from Dutch\r\npractices of a hundred and more years ago, when the Cape of Good Hope\r\nstill belonged to that nation. Servitude, if not absolute slavery, was\r\nthen generally recognised as the proper status for coloured aborigines,\r\nand that principle of differentiation continues to be upheld and applied\r\nin a modified form, it must be admitted, in all the Colonial possessions\r\nof Holland. The authority for this stand is sought from ancient biblical\r\nhistory, where the descendants of Ham appear marked out for servitude,\r\nand from that basis it is interpreted that people so marked are not\r\ndesigned for tuition or evangelization until after they have been\r\nsubjugated. According to such a doctrine the injunction to preach the\r\nGospel to every creature would be limited to civilized whites, and might\r\nonly be extended to such coloured peoples who have been fitted, as is\r\nsaid, for the reception of the Christian faith by being placed under\r\nthe subserviency of whites, as their sponsors if not their actual\r\nmasters, and requiring mundane tuition and education as essential bases\r\nto precede conversion.\r\n\r\nFor the refutation of such monstrous doctrines it may be urged that,\r\naccording to Scripture, savage as well as cultured peoples have a\r\nconsciousness of guilt towards the Divine Judge. The object of the\r\nGospel is to end the history of the culprit as such and to place him\r\nupon a new standing--\"the wind bloweth as it listeth\": a new birth\r\noperated by the acceptance of the Gospel proclamation addressed to every\r\ncreature, black as well as white. Growth and moral amendment properly\r\n\"follow\" that spiritual birth; neither is conceivable before, except\r\npurely human education, which is incapable of effecting a change, and in\r\nfact tends only to fortify the natural man in his implacable hostility\r\nagainst the newly implanted element, each lusting against the other.[12]\r\n\r\nHistory records how the Spanish and other early explorers operated with\r\nthe aborigines in the regions discovered by them. The territories with\r\ntheir inhabitants were declared possessions accruing to their respective\r\nsovereigns, whose main policy was the exploitation of all the wealth\r\npossible. The aborigines were dispossessed, treated as conquered\r\npeoples, and forced to do the exploiting labour. No other results could\r\nfollow than the gradual diminution and final exhaustion of all the\r\nwealth and the partial, if not total, extinction of the aboriginal\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nWhat retribution overtook those nations is also on record. Those\r\nenslaved peoples were forced to accept the religion of their conquerors.\r\nCan true converts be made to order by constraint, motives of\r\nself-interest, or by baptizing them _en bloc_? What else but deepest\r\naversion and mistrust could a religion inspire which is professed and\r\ntaught by a people who practise spoliation, murder, and other\r\ndescriptions of wickedness abhorrent even to a savage mind? The\r\naborigines would daily behold their own land and possessions enjoyed by\r\nusurpers and \"would be teachers,\" who subjected them besides to slavery\r\nand abject misery. Could the religion of such teachers ever find favour\r\nwith their victims? How could doctrines of righteousness and love be\r\nunderstood when so glaringly violated by their preceptors?\r\n\r\nIt presents a sad paradox to see that the Boers, who are in many\r\nrespects consistently religious and even exemplary, could uphold\r\nprinciples which place coloured people out of caste, not only in regard\r\nto political rights but also as to the common religious standing before\r\nthe Creator. It would be unjust to charge the Boers with actually\r\nbarbarous practices towards the natives--what they do enforce is their\r\nsubmission to the condition of servants.\r\n\r\nThe Boer people ever chafed against the restraining action of the\r\nBritish Government as to their practice of slavery, and they have not\r\nhesitated either to exhibit their hostility to missionary enterprise.\r\nThe confiscation of Protestant mission sites in the Orange Free State is\r\none of the instances; another was exemplified in a raid perpetrated\r\nabout forty years ago by the Transvaal Boers upon the inoffensive\r\nBechuana tribe, whose chief and many of his people had accepted the\r\nChristian faith through the teaching of Moffat, David Livingstone, and\r\nother evangelists. The pretext for that raid was a lying report that\r\nthat Bechuana chief had bartered some 400 guns from traders to fight the\r\nBoers with. The Boers sent an ultimatum requiring the surrender of\r\nthose weapons. Despite the protestation of the chief and his people that\r\nnot more than eight guns had been bartered for hunting, which had later\r\nproved true, a commando was sent against them under Commandant Paul\r\nKrüger, now President Krüger. Many of the natives were slain, their\r\nvillages burnt, their cattle seized, and great numbers of the tribe\r\ntaken captive for distribution as servants among the Boer farmers in the\r\nTransvaal. That raid was further signalized by the total destruction of\r\nMoffat's mission station--church, school buildings, and industrial\r\nshops. These, after being looted, were all consigned to the flames, as\r\nalso the missionary dwellings, among which was that of David\r\nLivingstone, with his furniture, books, and belongings. There are\r\nabundant records, besides that of the Bechuana nation, that barbarous\r\nand idolatrous peoples are amenable to Christianity without the prior\r\ninfluences of civilization or individual education, or that they should\r\nbe subjugated first, as the Boers would have it. What indeed is of\r\nimmense aid for moral and economic advancement is the operation of\r\ncivilized and liberal governmental authority, repressing slavery, under\r\nwhich proprietary rights and justice are equally afforded to black and\r\nwhite, and where the Gospel might have a free course without constraint\r\nand without inducements of material advantages.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that such conditions were on the eve of eventuating for the\r\nrescue and disenthralment of darkest Africa. This is what Moffat,\r\nLivingstone, Coillard, and many other devoted servants of the Gospel had\r\nprayed for all their lives, what has been and still is the burden of the\r\nprayers (no doubt all inspired) of millions of Christians. The interior\r\nis no more a blank on the map. Much is done for the suppression of\r\nslavery. The whole continent is parcelled out among different nations,\r\nwho have assumed the task of civilizing their respective spheres. The\r\nworld's energy and capital stand available for the object, and it\r\nappeared that many souls were being seriously aroused to the\r\nresponsibility of obeying the charge pronounced in Ezekiel xxxiii. 1-11.\r\nBut sinister influences have not failed in attempts to bar beneficent\r\ndispensations. We have seen fanaticism resulting in the fierce revolt of\r\nMahdism in the north, and are now awaiting the issue of the war brought\r\non by Afrikaner Bondism in the south.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Another has aptly illustrated the change by comparing such\r\na man's new condition to a hotel that has come under totally different\r\nand perfectly new management and controlling proprietorship.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLAND'S NATIVE AND COLONIAL POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the earlier parts of this nineteenth century England has been\r\nconspicuous among other nations in tolerating slavery in some of her\r\npossessions, and in permitting her people to engage in systematic\r\nman-hunts, with the accompanying atrocities and horrors of a regular\r\nslave trade. Manifestations of national abhorrence and condemnation of\r\nthat inhuman traffic and of slavery in general appeared during the first\r\nquarter of this century. The nation hid its shame and contrition in acts\r\ntowards remedying its share of the evil committed. These took the shape\r\nof expending some twenty million pounds sterling towards the\r\nemancipation of slaves and various other costly measures to repress the\r\ntrade in human beings, and in proclaiming personal freedom for all\r\nslaves in her dominions. The desire to do justice to coloured races was\r\nfurther exemplified in the adoption, dating some fifty years back, of a\r\ntotally altered colonial and native policy. Up to then the practice\r\nwith all colonizing Powers had been to utilize their foreign dominions\r\nas preserves for financial exploitation, involving the most crying\r\ninjustice to aborigines. The departure then effected consisted in a\r\npolicy of just laws instead, directed to ensure to those people\r\nequitable treatment and a recognition of their rights to fixed property\r\nand to a position before the law equal with that of white inhabitants.\r\nThe revenues produced by the Colonies were thenceforward all to be\r\ndevoted to the advancement of their own local prosperity. Free trade\r\nfollowed that _régime_ of liberty and equity, and, as intended, such\r\nColonial dominions began to partake of the character and were\r\nconstituted off-shoots of the mother country, with a like status of\r\nliberty and enjoying the benefit of British protection at the same time.\r\nMany were the auguries that the experiment would result in political and\r\neconomic failure, but the good results to all concerned proved to be so\r\nfar-reaching as to startle even its most sanguine advocates. The\r\nextension of privileges and rights operated upon the natives as a\r\nmagical incentive to labour and emulation for the improvement of their\r\neconomic condition; people who had before preferred an indolent,\r\nsemi-nomadic existence betook themselves more to agricultural and\r\nsedentary habits, living in much greater comfort and steadily increasing\r\nin wealth.\r\n\r\nCivilization went on apace, and with it the moral improvement of the\r\naborigines, paving the way as well for the spread of Christianity. All\r\nthis was accompanied with an immense and ever-advancing expansion of\r\ntrade with England and the recognition of British prestige as a\r\nsuccessful colonizing power.\r\n\r\nNumerous other principalities courted the privilege of coming under the\r\nægis of the English flag, their potentates and people readily submitting\r\nto the abolition of practices which were not in accord with humane and\r\ncivilized usages and eager to share the benefits and advancement of\r\ncivilization which were enjoyed under British rule. In not a few\r\ninstances it was, however, not feasible to extend the protectorate so\r\ncoveted.\r\n\r\nWhile other nations were engaged in wars during the past half-century,\r\nEngland had opportunities to largely expand and consolidate her Colonial\r\ndominions. At the same time British trade, industries and shipping\r\nadvanced with gigantic strides, and that nation has since gained the\r\nforemost rank as a commercial and Colonial empire, governing over the\r\nchoicest portions of the globe some four hundred millions of loyal and\r\ncontented subjects, who enjoy liberty and a degree of prosperity\r\nunequalled elsewhere as yet, the whole being protected by a navy which\r\nconstitutes England as champion on sea as well.\r\n\r\nAll this national success and example of liberal government have had a\r\nsalutary influence upon the rest of the world in evoking wholesome\r\ncompetition and emulation. But another and very untoward effect is that\r\nwidespread and deep-rooted envy and jealousy have also been aroused,\r\nwhich on occasion are apt to develop into pretexts for actual hostility,\r\nor hostile partisanship as is now the case.\r\n\r\nWhat signalises the beneficent reign of Queen Victoria more than\r\nanything else is the peculiarly devoted manner in which that august lady\r\nhas personally acquitted herself of her duty and responsibility in\r\nregard to the elevation and rehabilitation of the hitherto socially\r\nenslaved condition of womanhood in her Indian empire; for it is well\r\nknown how the philosophic religions of the East have been subtly adapted\r\nfor establishing the political and social pre-eminence of certain\r\nclasses of a population over its majority, at the same time dooming\r\nwomanhood generally to the lowest rank of drudges, perpetual contempt\r\nand ignorance, refusing them education (as had been done in the case of\r\nthe Roman slaves)--specially despised if without a husband, and if a\r\nwidow, immolated at last upon her husband's funeral pyre.\r\n\r\nStep by step, by means of strenuous and disinterested exertions,\r\nemploying prestige and encouragements, by legislation and otherwise, a\r\nbreach was effected which bids fair to break down that caste-fenced and\r\nchained thraldom, and to raise over a hundred millions of her humble\r\nsubject sisters from unnatural degradation to occupy the honourable and\r\nresponsible rank assigned by the Creator to woman as man's social help,\r\nmeet for him, and to whom honour is due as to the weaker vessel.\r\nMillions of women have already found emancipation and recognition of\r\ntheir right position, to man's reciprocal joy and to the felicity of\r\ntheir families. Their sons and daughters in turn now form armies to\r\ncomplete the mission of liberty so zealously inaugurated by their\r\nbeloved Empress, their own peculiar star of India.\r\n\r\nMaybe this and similar earnests evinced during that noble Queen's reign,\r\namong which the shelter afforded to the Jewish people, will come into\r\nremembrance in mitigation of visitations deserved by the nation for its\r\nprevious complicity in the hideous traffic in African souls of men.\r\n\r\nIt throws a light upon the credulity and simplicity of the bulk of the\r\npoor deluded peasant Boers when, in the face of most genial rule and\r\nalmost an excess of liberty and privileges, Bond artifice could succeed\r\nin conjuring up contrary notions, and to poison them into the monstrous\r\nbelief that they, the Boers, were an oppressed people, whose downfall\r\nwas designed by rapacious England, and that no other remedy existed for\r\npreserving independence, religion and homes than to expel that wicked\r\nEnglish people from African soil. This is, then, what Bond artifice\r\neffected in the absence of actual cause and in order to dissimulate its\r\nown nefarious objects. It was the work of twenty years' sedulously\r\napplied deception and calumnious machinations.\r\n\r\nThe Hollander coterie has at last succeeded in its ardently desired\r\npurpose of pitting the Boer nation against England, and to bring about\r\nthe present war. What is even more astounding is the success of those\r\nvillainous artificers upon intelligent partisans of the Boer cause\r\noutside of Africa and in England even.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOCCULT OPERATIONS AND AGENCIES\r\n\r\n\r\nWill it be considered the mere fancy of enthusiasts, which admits the\r\nthought of occult forces of a sinister kind set in array to overturn\r\nbeneficent dispensations, that the evil one, the father of lies, has\r\nbeen active in all this marring of peace? Had that personage or evil\r\nprinciple, if this term is more acceptable, not scored with his\r\nmalignant skill of deception 6,000 years ago, and been walking up and\r\ndown his domain ever since, intent upon undoing redemptive provisions\r\nand counteracting all endeavours to ameliorate the miseries of humanity?\r\nHis malice would seem discernible against the Boer nation, the people\r\nwho continued in the simple faith which had been kept by their ancestors\r\ndespite the persecutions heaped upon them in France and by the oppressor\r\nof Holland; he must have viewed with growing rage the designs of a\r\ngracious Providence surrounding that very people with the blessings of\r\nsecurity and peace and accumulations of unparalleled riches, all\r\nconstruable as in compensation for the sacrifices so willingly submitted\r\nto by their forefathers and for their own fidelity to the faith. Would\r\nhe tamely brook that--and not bend on all his artifices to reverse those\r\nprovisions and to divert those rich dispensations in favour of his own\r\ndevotees instead, or else rather cause them to be devoured by wasting\r\nwar? He has so far succeeded in instigating the Boer nation to acts\r\nwhich involve the forfeiture of their special heirlooms. He would also\r\nthwart the programme of the world's nations for the civilization of\r\nCentral Africa, and would gratify his malice against the people to whom\r\nis largely attributable the spread of governmental principles of equity\r\nand liberty. He would seek to stamp with failure those hitherto\r\nsuccessful and self-rewarding methods, and so strike an effective blow\r\nagainst their further adoption as being goody-goody, weak and\r\ninefficient.\r\n\r\nWe see civilized humanity congested with over-population, excess of\r\nenergy and of production and suffering from a plethora of capital, the\r\nentire condition rife on the one hand with prodigal waste and on the\r\nother fraught with the cruel want of toiling and jostling millions\r\nvainly fighting for space and the most modest means of\r\nexistence--conditions which presage an inevitable and universal crash\r\nunless checked by a Malthusian or else by a beneficent and humane\r\nremedy. We know the right remedy for at least staving off the impending\r\nuniversal crisis lies in the manifold opportunities of creating outlets.\r\nThese exist to the full in the vast fallow regions of Africa, and in the\r\nscope for industries and commerce in Asia and elsewhere. Each\r\nwell-devised colonizing scheme, every railway built, and every other new\r\ninvestment would afford improved employment and relieve the general\r\nstrain; every true convert gained by the spread of Christianity would\r\nbecome an obedient and reliable unit towards the menaced stability of\r\nauthorized Governments. We see capital impelled to vast enterprises, as\r\nit were by secret forces;[13] we are aware of the activity of nations\r\nsingly and in co-operation in promoting and sustaining such projects.\r\nAll those efforts and outlets would serve as safety-valves for the\r\ndiscontent of the ill-provided masses, and their success would render\r\nthem governable at a lesser cost, and even admit the reduction of\r\nstanding armies and other objects treated by the recent Peace Conference\r\nat the Hague. The essential thing, indeed, is peace, and that in turn\r\nwould consolidate security and progress. But the enemy is interested\r\nexactly the other way. His ascendancy is coincident, not with the\r\nmitigation of the conditions of human existence, but in accentuating the\r\nmisery of the masses, driving them to desperation and to embrace illogic\r\nand deceptive maxims of socialism and violent anarchy. It is with those\r\nforces that he intends to uproot and usurp divinely instituted authority\r\nexpressly set up to repress evil and to protect person and property. He\r\nwants by licence and not liberty to hasten the advent of that murderous\r\npolitical power prophetically depicted with the statue standing upon\r\nfeet of clay and iron: supreme authority vested in the world's\r\nproletariat in unstable and uncohesive union with militarism, Satan\r\nhimself the actual lawless animator.[14] As to the scope for outlets in\r\nthe East, it is more restricted to industries and commerce, but those\r\nenterprises, however brilliantly promising, are fraught with the risks\r\nincidental to hostile rivalries and political complications, while in\r\nAfrica the openings are at least as vast and inviting immigration on a\r\nhuge scale as well, but all with much greater security, inasmuch as the\r\nspheres of operation are definitely apportioned to various nations, and\r\nwhere in the nature of things the success of each would be promoted by\r\njoint-solidarity, and thus afford a guarantee for the peaceable and\r\nprosperous development of the whole continent. Our common enemy would\r\nfain frustrate it all with his Afrikaner Bond device, and then finally\r\ngloat over the accomplished ruin of his deluded Boer victims.\r\n\r\nAfrica has for some thousands of years been the enemy's favourite and\r\nundisturbed haunt for his gory orgies, for the hecatombs of millions of\r\nimmolated victims each year, the teeming recruiting preserve for his\r\ncontingents.\r\n\r\nIs he likely to surrender it all to an invading beneficent operation?\r\nWill he not rather continue a most determined and desperate resistance\r\nand oppose the most advanced of his subtle devices? The malignant power\r\nof his agencies is ever and anon manifest--if restrained in one\r\ndirection his sway is doubly asserted in another. While the Boer war is\r\nproceeding a diversion upon a large scale is being effected in Asia\r\nwhich may result in deferring progress in Africa, or history may be\r\nbrought to repeat itself by the production of some African Attila or\r\nGrenseric or a Saladin or another Moselikatse or Mahdi, whose\r\noverrunning hordes will efface all the good work thus far done and\r\nrestore conditions in accord with his murderous sway, whilst at the same\r\ntime revelling over the ominous developments looming in Europe and\r\nAmerica for the production of giant strikes and other imminent\r\nsocialistic outbursts which could all be prevented, or at least staved\r\noff for a long time, if the existing immense spheres for civilizing\r\noutlets could only be peaceably utilized.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: One of those enterprises is the railway which is to\r\nconnect the Cape with Cairo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Pro-Boer Propaganda is persisting in designating England\r\nas answering to that prophetic image destined to signal destruction.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old voortrekkers who emigrated from the Cape Colony all belonged to\r\nthe Dutch Reformed Protestant persuasion. With very little learning, the\r\nBible, catechism, and the orthodox \"psalm and hymn-book\" constituted\r\ntheir sole means for building up their faith. The scope of their\r\neducation was likewise limited to these simple aids during their\r\nchequered wanderings for nearly twenty years, proving ample, however, in\r\npreserving themselves and children from the tendencies of receding into\r\nbarbarism. The Bible was the recognised reference and guide in private\r\nand public affairs, and it is so still. It is, indeed, notable with what\r\nwisdom and prudence those simple people managed to frame their treaties\r\nwith native potentates, their conventions with the Portuguese and the\r\nBritish Governments, and, finally, in compiling their own constitutions.\r\nTheir experiences teem with incidents of extreme sufferings, dangers,\r\nand reverses, and also with many signal deliverances, which all\r\noperated in deepening religious fervour and dependence upon the\r\nAlmighty.\r\n\r\nTheir vicissitudes led them to make analogous comparisons with ancient\r\nJewish history. This practice resulted in some erroneous conceptions,\r\nnotably in regard to their relations with aborigines and general native\r\npolicy, as referred to in previous chapters. It also imperceptibly\r\nfostered sentiments confounding legality with grace, and the by-product\r\nof that subtle corrupting leaven which is apt to see a splint in the eye\r\nof another whilst unmindful of the beam in one's own.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, the religious status of the Boers may be fairly compared\r\nto that of the old American pilgrim fathers, only much less intolerant,\r\nfairly strict sabbatarians, and jealous in maintaining national and\r\nindividual morality. About forty years ago a small group seceded from\r\nthe Dutch Reformed Church and formed a separate connection under the\r\nname of \"Enkel gereformende Kerk\" (simply reformed Church), more\r\ngenerally known under the sobriquet of \"Doppers.\" This cult is identical\r\nwith the parent Church, and differs only in a somewhat stricter church\r\ndiscipline and the rejection of the hymns from the common psalm and\r\nhymn-book upon the ground that many of them are tainted with dangerously\r\nanti-scriptural doctrine.[15] These Doppers are really very worthy\r\npeople, but noted for their strong conservatism and adherence to old\r\nhabits and customs, even in the matter of dress. President Krüger is one\r\nof their prominent members and so is General Piet Cronjé.\r\n\r\nThe devotional habits of the Boers form one of their national\r\ncharacteristics. The family collect at dawn for morning worship, led by\r\nthe parent or else by the tutor--it consists of a hymn,\r\nScripture-reading, and prayer--similarly before retiring at night,\r\ndevout grace before and after each meal. These practices are not relaxed\r\nwhen travelling with their wagons or when in the field. On Sundays an\r\nextra (forenoon) service is added. Strangers and travellers receiving\r\nhospitality are always courteously and unostentatiously admitted to\r\nthose family devotions. One may thus meet with one or more wagons camped\r\nin the wilderness and find a cluster of men, women, and children\r\nengaged in happy devotions and singing psalms or hymns in the familiar\r\nold \"Herrenhut\" melodies, or one may come upon a scene where men just\r\nreturned to camp, begrimed and still perspiring from a day's hunt or\r\nbattle, join with husky voices an already assembled group in the\r\ncustomary service.\r\n\r\nSuch practices of piety cannot fail to have a salutary effect upon the\r\nyoung, nor can it be with justice said that the bulk of the people are\r\ninconsistent in their conduct, though formality and insincerity are\r\nsadly frequent enough, and in late years a decadence in seriousness and\r\nan increase of frivolity instead have marked the present epoch,\r\nespecially among those who are exposed to the pernicious influences and\r\ncontaminations incidental to town life. The old Free Stater mentioned\r\nbefore expressed the expectation that the present war and trials will\r\ntend to check that declension, and in that way prove to have a\r\ncompensating character for good. During my frequent travels it had been\r\nmy privilege as a guest to make the acquaintance of numerous truly\r\nChristian Boer families, both well-to-do and poor. On one occasion I had\r\nto accept the hospitality at a farmhouse of one named Brits,[16]\r\nnicknamed \"vuil\" or dirty Brits. This was an old blind widower; his\r\nhousehold was composed, besides himself, of an old brother, also a\r\nwidower, and the family of a son-in-law. After the evening meal the\r\nservice was led by the blind man, the daughter reading some chapters in\r\nthe Bible indicated by him. The two old men and I occupied separate cots\r\nin one small side room. Happening to wake up at dawn the following\r\nmorning, I saw those old men sit up facing each other, with their feet\r\nupon the floor, and begin their morning hymn of praise, after which the\r\nhouse resounded with younger voices from the other end with a similar\r\nsong. I do not call to mind any special untidiness at that poor blind\r\nman's house to warrant his sobriquet; my recollections are, on the\r\ncontrary, of the happiest, and I mentally called him clean Brits, clean\r\nevery whit. In another part of the country I was privileged to meet with\r\na family, which included a grown-up blind daughter,' who had St. John's\r\nGospel in raised letters. While reading with her fingers her upturned\r\nface would shine with joy when repeating some of the salient, consoling,\r\nand sustaining verses. And how common are the records among those simple\r\nBoers of happy and triumphant death-bed scenes of old and young,\r\nsoftening the grief of the bereaved believers. Frivolous education and\r\nadvanced surroundings are accountable for a certain waning of the\r\noriginal habits of serious piety; this is to some extent more the case\r\namong the Cape Colonial and Orange Free State Boers, the declension\r\nappearing greatest with those residing in or in close proximity to\r\ntowns. Among the men of exemplary and consistent piety in the Transvaal\r\nare conspicuous: President Krüger, State Secretary Reitz,\r\nCommandant-General Joubert, General Piet Cronjé, and others holding\r\nhighest positions, and also many of the Volksraad members, including the\r\nlate General Kock.\r\n\r\nUpon the occasion when the Transvaal Executive, with the assembled\r\nVolksraads, finally determined upon war, and the momentous matter had\r\nbeen considered of handing over the passports to Mr. Greene, the British\r\nagent, just before signing them, President Krüger was observed occupied\r\nin silent prayer for a few moments, while many of the others bowed their\r\nheads similarly engaged, after which the documents were firmly\r\ncompleted. When the first commandoes were about to depart for the field,\r\nthe President addressed a farewell to the burghers, assuring them that\r\nGod's aid could confidently be implored for their just cause; he also\r\nquoted part of the Verse, \"Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall\r\nlose it,\" intending it as an exhortation for the timorous, warning them\r\nof the greater danger incurred by retreat or flight than when\r\nmaintaining a manful stand. (The reader will know that the above\r\nquotation does not complete the verse, the rest being, \"But whosoever\r\nshall lose his life for my sake or for the Gospel shall preserve it.\")\r\n\r\nIt points to the operation of most persevering and subtle agencies and\r\npotent illusions that could mislead and carry away the chief men and the\r\nmost intelligent of the Boer nation so far as to engender the erroneous\r\nconvictions which caused them to court the present war and to consider\r\nit just. As to the bulk of the people, they are in turn led astray by\r\ntheir leaders' example and opinions as victims of the general delusion.\r\n\r\nThese convictions, together with the acceptance of Afrikaner Bond\r\ndoctrines, have developed into quite a national infatuation, a kind of\r\nBoer Koran, invested with similar fanaticism. Analogies are assumed as\r\nexisting between the case of the Israelites brought by Moses through the\r\nwilderness, and led by Joshua into the conquered possession of their\r\npromised Canaan. Following those prototypes, Paul Krüger is held as\r\nhaving guided the Boer nation thus far through the mazes of political\r\ntroubles, and so also is General Joubert,[17] now their leader in the\r\nconquest, South Africa in its entirety being considered as rightfully\r\nbelonging to them. The Orange River stands for Jordan, dividing as yet\r\nthe possessions of the people, and the analogy only needs completion by\r\na Pisgah for President Krüger. That such hallucinations have taken deep\r\nroot appears from the fact that the wife of President Krüger dreamt of\r\nthe accomplishment of such a typical history, and that her husband had\r\ndied at an early stage of the conquest. Such complete faith is attached\r\nto the prophetic import of that dream that the President was prevailed\r\nupon to permit its publication in full detail some time in November\r\nlast. The President's death was anticipated within two months after. (I\r\nam far from referring to those incidents in a mocking mood, but rather\r\nto show the intense sincerity of Boer convictions, confounding the\r\nChristian's exalted calling with one which is temporal; and I fancy that\r\nthose very Boers, if equally well instructed, might sadly eclipse some\r\nof us who have the privilege and also the responsibility of enjoying\r\ncorrect teaching.)\r\n\r\nThe writer has endeavoured to represent in a true light both the\r\ncharacter of the Boer nation and its responsibility in regard to the\r\norigin of the present deplorable war. The reader will be able to judge\r\nwhether that people is wilfully guilty, or whether the circumstances\r\nadmit of generous, mitigating condonement, always considered apart from\r\nthat horrible Hollander element which has been the root and instigating\r\ncause of all the evil.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Some readers will recognise the significance, the\r\nprotective competence, the keen and reliable instinct which enable\r\nuntutored believers to discern and detect doctrinal leaven insidiously\r\nconcealed in the garb of worship.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: At Modder River, on the road between Bloemfontein and\r\nKimberley.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: At the time, December, 1899, when this was intended for\r\npublication.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSIQUE AND HABITS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have noted in former pages that the Boers' ancestry some two\r\ncenturies ago was composed of about two-thirds of sturdy Dutch peasants,\r\nartizans, etc., while the other third consisted mostly of French\r\nHuguenots.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the immigrant class, though generally somewhat poor,\r\nare uniformly men and women endowed with an adventurous, self-reliant\r\nspirit and with unimpaired health. Naturally none but robust persons\r\nwere permitted to join the Dutch settlement at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nWe see in that combination the patient, resolute quality prevailing in\r\nHolland and the more ardent, vivacious, and chivalrous character found\r\nwith the French people. The Huguenot refugees belonged undisputably to\r\nthe cream of that impulsive nation--intellectual, educated, and\r\nfearless--whilst both portions were pervaded with deep-rooted religious\r\nfervour and habituated to moral and temperate lives.\r\n\r\nThose combined qualities and habits would naturally be transmitted to\r\nthe progeny; prosperity and splendid climatic conditions tended still\r\nfurther to develop a virile physique of first order. The moral and\r\nphysical standards were maintained by the practice of men and women\r\nmarrying early in life, and by occupations which required the people to\r\npass most of their time in the open. Educationally, there was\r\nunavoidably some retrogression, but there is always plenty of scope in\r\nthe existence of colonists in a new country for the exercise of a\r\nvigorous mind in the study of nature, in overcoming difficulties and in\r\ncultivating the faculty of resourcefulness.\r\n\r\nWhilst missing the intellectual benefits of advanced civilization, the\r\npeople escaped the dangers of its vitiating tendencies, thus preserving\r\na healthy mental calibre as well as robust physical health. In addition\r\nmay be mentioned a very notable fecundal power, which accounts for the\r\nphenomenally rapid increase of the people. All those conditions have\r\ncontinued to be maintained with the successive generations up to now.\r\n\r\nThose who joined in the exodus north of the Orange River in 1835 and the\r\nyears following comprised the most indomitable and best endowed of that\r\nstalwart race. Twenty years of a nomadic life after that and until they\r\ngot somewhat settled down served to weed out the weaklings among them;\r\nsince then their mode of life accorded well to keep up the highest\r\nphysical standard, not pampered with many comforts, inured to hardships\r\nand to out-of-door exercise, with a diet consisting very largely of meat\r\nand venison, coupled with energetic exercise of mind and body (the women\r\nsharing in the less arduous duties). All this constituted a regimen and\r\ntraining which did not fail to keep the people in a constant condition\r\nof high efficiency and equipoise for the performance of tasks and for\r\nsurmounting difficulties needing more than usual strength, endurance,\r\nand fortitude.\r\n\r\nThe rough labour all over South Africa is done mostly by Kaffirs and\r\nother coloured people. A Boer farmer will have from two to ten or more\r\nKaffirs (men and women) employed for out-of-door work and for domestic\r\ndrudgery. Often absent from home on hunting trips and sometimes on\r\ncommando, the men entrust their work on such occasions (as is now the\r\ncase during the present war) to the care of their wives and daughters,\r\nassisted by some younger sons, if the family includes any, or else\r\nsimply with the aid of Kaffir servants. Sometimes they are without any\r\nsuch help, when they take a pride in doing it alone.\r\n\r\nGirls as well as boys learn to ride on horseback when quite young. It is\r\nquite a usual thing to see women riding astride fashion, collecting\r\nsheep and cattle, or driving their horse carts and spiders (carriages),\r\nunattended by males, over distances of over twenty and thirty\r\nmiles--women spanning in ox-teams to their travelling wagons, driving\r\nthem with long whips on journeys occupying one or more days. During the\r\nKaffir wars the Boers used to trek (travel) in bodies with their wagons,\r\nwhich would serve to form a laager or fort, their families and\r\nbelongings being placed in the centre. During an attack the women would\r\nattend to the men's wants, reload their rifles, and even take a more\r\nactive part in repelling the enemy, many of them being also crack shots.\r\nThe above-stated efficient and hardy habits with men and women apply\r\nmore to the people in the two Republics, and particularly so to those of\r\nthe Transvaal, while the Colonial Boers on the whole have had no such\r\nexperience, but instead have lived in uninterrupted peace and comfort\r\nfor generations, and may be classed with farmers of any other\r\nwell-governed and protected country or colony. The Boer farmers in the\r\nnorthern portions of the Cape Colony, however, approximate to those of\r\nthe Orange Free State in hardy habits and ability to fend for themselves\r\nwhen in difficulty. But with the Transvaal Boers the training incident\r\nto wars, hunting, and nomadic movements has been more sustained, and\r\nthey are thus in best form and fitness of efficiency compared with all\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nIn the Orange Free State nearly every man above fifty years of age has\r\nhad the experience of the three years' Basuto war in 1865-67, and almost\r\nall above forty are very expert huntsmen and crack shots. Quite a good\r\nnumber have also taken part in the Transvaal war against the English in\r\n1880; the rest have been trained by the elder veterans, and, though not\r\nso well seasoned, are good horsemen, expert with the rifle, and\r\ncompetent in the field. As to the Transvaalers, the men have all had\r\nplenty of field practice before the previous war with England and since,\r\nin subduing formidable Kaffir rebellions, the last being the operations\r\nagainst the Magato chief, which terminated just before the outbreak of\r\nthe present Anglo-Boer war.\r\n\r\nBesides this, game had continued longer in abundance in the Transvaal,\r\nand is still hunted with success in the northern low veldt and in the\r\nadjacent Portuguese territory. Added to this, the young Boers in the\r\nCape Colony, Natal, Orange Free State, and Transvaal have been\r\nencouraged to attain proficiency in rifle practice and competence in the\r\nfield, ostensibly for the gratification of keeping up old traditions,\r\nbut in reality to be prepared for the struggle against England meditated\r\nby the Afrikaner Bond.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty odd years ago the Orange Free State and Transvaal were\r\nstill swarming with all sorts of game. Venison was the staple diet.\r\nLions and leopards also infested those States, but these and the game\r\nhave been pretty well extirpated since, except in some of the lower\r\nparts of the Transvaal. In the earlier days ammunition was costly and\r\nhard to procure, and the use had to be husbanded accordingly. It became\r\nthus a practice never to pull a trigger unless with intense aim and the\r\ncertainty of an effective shot. A man would go out stalking for an hour\r\nor so with perhaps but one or two charges, and would rarely fail in\r\nbringing home the kind of game wanted--either a springbock, blesbock, or\r\nwildebeest (gnu). In hunting lions, the lads would form part of the\r\ncompany for the purpose of being taught. The boys would learn that if a\r\nlion meant to attack he would approach to within twenty or thirty\r\nyards, and then straighten himself up before making the final charge. It\r\nwas during that short halt that the disabling or killing shot would have\r\nto be delivered. Father and son would then be standing ready--the son to\r\nfire first; if unsuccessful, the animal would be brought down by the\r\nfather. If there were a larger party and the lions numerous, the lessons\r\nwould be learnt so much better by way of emulation. The boys soon\r\nrealized that a lion, means business only when he advances silently and\r\nwith smoothed gait, but that bristling up and roaring is a sure prelude\r\nto his skulking off. What we read of the terror-inspiring roar is to the\r\nBoer stripling pure romance and non-sense; but what he does realize is\r\nthat he must hit the animal in a vital spot at the right moment or else\r\nrun the risk of being clawed and bitten. The confidence, however, which\r\nhe has in his gun gives him all the requisite nerve, and mishaps are of\r\nvery rare occurrence. Those lion hunts used to be very profitable, not\r\nonly for the valuable skins, but especially when a number of young cubs\r\nwere also caught, which would realize considerably high prices from\r\nmenagerie purveyors.\r\n\r\nAt the age of about eight years a boy would be taught to ride on\r\nhorseback; when twelve years old he would be an expert horseman and a\r\ndeadly rifle shot as well; at sixteen he would be able to perform all\r\nfarm duties and rank with pride and confidence as an efficient burgher\r\nto take the field against any enemy. His brain is not addled with school\r\nlore, but is thoroughly versed and taught from nature's book. Hardened\r\nto the fatigue of long rides over unfamiliar country in search of stray\r\ncattle, the Boer youth has often to subsist upon a bit of dried biltong\r\n(junked beef or venison), endure at intervals scorching heat and\r\ndrenching rains, swim rivers, and pass the night with a stone for a\r\npillow and his saddle as the only shelter, while his horse, securely\r\nhobbled, feeds upon the grass around. Never will he lose his way; if\r\nlandmarks fail him and clouds hide moon and stars, he is guided by wind,\r\nthe run of water or his horse's instincts. Accustomed to wide horizons,\r\nhe can promptly distinguish objects at a distance, which, to an\r\nordinarily good eyesight, would need careful scanning through a\r\nfield-glass.\r\n\r\nHe is expert in finding and following any trail, and can promptly tell\r\nthe imprint from whatever animal it might be, or of whatever human\r\norigin; an ideal scout and unsurpassed as a pioneer. When travelling\r\nover roadless country the Boer's instinct will direct him in tracing\r\nthe most practicable route for his wagons, and with his experience he\r\ncan foretell what kind of topography he will in succession have to\r\ntraverse, avoiding unnegotiable spots and unnecessary detours, and when\r\nabout to halt, a surveying gaze will locate the safest and most suitable\r\nposition for his temporary camp. Such capacities serve with obvious\r\nadvantage in defensive and offensive war tactics. Prompt in seizing an\r\nadvantage and in avoiding danger, he has also learnt to be an adept in\r\nruses to decoy and mislead an enemy, and as for self-help and\r\nresourcefulness, there is hardly a situation or difficulty conceivable\r\nwhich will not be successfully surmounted. The usual Boer can also fend\r\nfor himself and cope with the minor perplexities of every-day life in\r\nthe field, which would strand a less initiated man. He can cook, bake\r\nbread, mend clothes, make boots, repair saddles, harness, and vehicles,\r\nand is full of expedients and able to make shift. Most of them know how\r\nto shoe their horses, whilst many of them are expert also in working\r\nwood and metals and similar handicrafts. In short, the Boers make ideal\r\nscouts and are unique as colonizing pioneers. In their nomadic\r\nwanderings and frequent wars, the Boers have gained much useful\r\nexperience in tactics, strategy, and in the wiles of diplomacy too.\r\nThey also learnt to adopt methods of organization, of cohesion, combined\r\naction, and a certain amount of discipline among themselves.\r\n\r\nThey elect as subordinate and chief leaders men whose abilities and\r\ninfluence have commended them for such responsible appointments. Before\r\ncommitting themselves to any very important step these leaders would\r\nfirst confer with the people, who in turn would generally be easily\r\nswayed to their opinions, and who found by experience that it was safest\r\nto follow their judgment. It thus also became a habit to leave the main\r\nthinking over to those leaders, which enhanced unanimity and led to a\r\nself-imposed obedience and discipline recognised as necessary for the\r\ncommon welfare and also indispensable for common safety.\r\n\r\nSo prevalent had the practice become of deferring to the opinions of\r\ntheir leaders that it engendered an apathy among the people against\r\nconsidering political and public matters which were not altogether of\r\nengrossing importance. Public meetings would be poorly attended, and at\r\nelections not half the votes were recorded. \"Let the elected heads see\r\nto it; they are paid for doing the controlling and thinking work\"--that\r\nused to be the general feeling. But during the past twenty years public\r\ninterest has by degrees been successfully aroused by the activities of\r\nthe Afrikaner Bond; the former apathy and distaste to the consideration\r\nof public concerns have given place to a more lively identification even\r\nwith politics, but the tendency of being swayed by men of influence of\r\ntheir own kind remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe Boers are great smokers--tobacco appears to have no hurtful effects\r\nwhatever upon them, but seems rather to serve as a grateful sedative.\r\nThe first thing offered on meeting a Boer is his tobacco pouch, and if\r\none is a guest at his house, this is followed by one or more cups of\r\ncoffee. This is drunk by men and women in large quantities, often\r\nwithout sugar, but very weak. The people are justly famed for cordial\r\nhospitality to strangers, and the pleasing tact and unostentatious\r\ncorrect politeness met with from the most ordinary and uneducated Boer\r\nare only accountable for on the theory that that particular culture of\r\nmanners has been transmitted from his noble French ancestry of a couple\r\nof hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nIn stature the men near the average of six feet (say five feet ten\r\ninches)--full-bearded, brawny-limbed, and of stalwart build, suggesting\r\na homeric capacity for aggression and resistance. They present a\r\nstandard of sturdy and active manhood, which would have delighted the\r\ncritical eye of Frederick the Great for the formation of his very best\r\nregiments. What is really singular is the infinitesimally small\r\nproportion of ineffective and sickly men found left behind when all the\r\ncommandoes are called out, and also the considerable number of hale old\r\nmen above sixty who voluntarily join the field. And when the hardy\r\ntraining and general high efficiency are considered down to the youth of\r\nsixteen, one may estimate the formidableness of such a foe, all well\r\nmounted on tough and nimble horses, well provisioned and provided with\r\nthe best weapons extant, guided by very competent chiefs and European\r\nadvisers--withal self-reliant and conscious of a superior aggressive and\r\ndefensive capability for repeating their splendid ancestral records of\r\nprowess. Add to this inbred patriotism stimulated to an enthusiasm\r\napproaching fanaticism by a mind fashioned to the belief that their war\r\nis against an unjust usurper destined to be overthrown; it all sums up a\r\nlong way towards balancing numerical inferiority and inexperience in the\r\nscience of modern warfare. As to military science, they are apt to\r\nbecome quickly tutored into proficiency by daily observation and\r\nexperience, and by the coaching of the numerous military officers who\r\nhave joined their ranks.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage upon the Boer side consists in complete\r\nacclimatization and perfect knowledge of the country. Lastly, but by no\r\nmeans less important, is the rational practice of always going as light\r\nand unencumbered as at all possible, preferably with stripped saddle,\r\nand to subsist mostly upon meat when in the field, both serving to\r\nenhance staying power and to provide a reserve of stamina and of energy\r\nfor occasions of supreme effort, which often decide the fate of battle\r\nagainst combatants, however courageous, who are fagged out with marching\r\non foot, and through being overladen with accoutrements and pack and a\r\nlumbersome diet as well. What can such panting, unsteadied men do in\r\nconflict with Boers who are fresh and in well-preserved form, and whose\r\nsteady sharp-shooting simply results in Calvaries for their opponents,\r\nhowever brave, disciplined and well equipped they may be?\r\n\r\nYet to be noted is the small commissariat needed for Boer horses and\r\nmules. These are accustomed to subsist altogether on grass, and when it\r\nis plentiful, during summer and fall, to keep in good condition, working\r\nsix to ten hours daily, if only allowed to graze during the rest of the\r\ntime. They are then usually knee-haltered, _i.e._, one foreleg tied to\r\nthe halter, with about eighteen inches space between. A few feeds of dry\r\nmealies (maize) will be amply supplementary when the pasture is\r\ninferior, or if the animals have to be picketed much.\r\n\r\nAs said before, alcoholism does not prevail among the Boers, and any\r\ntendency to it is sedulously checked by legislation and public\r\nreprobation. President Krüger is an absolute abstainer from intoxicants,\r\nand even at banquets he will sip water only when joining in a toast. His\r\ncontention is that the effects generally go beyond a harmlessly\r\nexhilarating point; the action of alcohol unbalances the nervous\r\nequilibrium, producing in most cases an excitement above the normal\r\nlevel, followed by a corresponding depressive reaction below it,\r\ncreating an appetite for repeating the potation, with exactly similar\r\nand progressively aggravated results. Then man's moral standard and\r\ngeneral efficiency and dignity become impaired, to the serious damage of\r\nhis own welfare and involving the common weal as well. When at the\r\noutbreak of the war the sale of intoxicants became totally prohibited\r\nthe measure was received with willing submission and hailed with general\r\napproval, which speaks volumes for the burgher population and without\r\ndoubt also tends to preserve their efficiency and stamina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT KRÜGER\r\n\r\n\r\nStephanus Johannes Paulus Krüger is about the most accessible President\r\non record. Every morning--except Sundays and holidays, after family\r\nworship, that is to say, from 5.30 in summer and 6 in winter to 8\r\no'clock--he gives audience to Boer and Uitlander, rich or poor alike,\r\nand also on each afternoon, from 4 to 6 and even later. His residence in\r\nthe west end of Church Street, Pretoria, is quite an ordinary modest\r\nbuilding of the bungalow type. The only distinction observable is two\r\ncrouching lion figures, life size, on pedestals about three feet high,\r\nat the balustrade entrance to the front verandah. A lawn of about thirty\r\nfeet across extends to the street limit, where at a very unpretentious\r\ngate two armed burgher guards are constantly stationed. These will\r\nreceive an intending visitor's name, an unarmed domestic guard will then\r\ncome forward, who, after a short scrutiny, if the person is a stranger,\r\nwill report to the President and will immediately return to conduct you\r\nto that dignitary, who may be sitting under the front verandah or in the\r\nadjoining reception-room. There the President will readily shake hands\r\nand point to a chair, rather near by because he is slightly hard of\r\nhearing, the domestic guard standing or sitting between, but a good way\r\nback. By his questions and final remarks one feels assured that the\r\ntopic introduced has been attentively listened to and fully grasped.\r\nWhile conversing, other audience-seekers would drop in, and, while\r\nwaiting their turn, coffee would usually be served to all. The manners\r\nobserved are devoid of any stiffness of etiquette, but rather marked\r\nwith a cordial decorum approaching intimacy, most assuring to the\r\nsimplest and humblest visitor.\r\n\r\nThe only leisure the President enjoys is the interval from 12 to 2,\r\nbetween his official labours at the Government buildings, which are\r\nabout half a mile distant from his house. He drives there and back in a\r\nmodest carriage attended by a guard of mounted policemen. His Honour is\r\ninvariably dressed in black cloth, with the usual tall silk hat. Six\r\nfeet high, with a slight stoop, broad shouldered, deep-chested, with\r\nwell-developed limbs, arms rather long, the President presents a\r\nstately, burly figure, portly without obesity. When younger he was\r\nnoted, as something like a Ulysses, for personal strength and prowess as\r\nwell as for sagacity. Although seventy-five years old now, Mr. Krüger\r\nhas still a remarkably hale bearing and an intellect of undiminished\r\nquality. His eyesight, however, has been suffering of late, rendering\r\nthe attendance of an oculist necessary. His Honour is in his fifth term\r\nof presidency, and has held the office twenty-two years. His salary is\r\n£8,000 per annum, of which he probably does not expend £1,000, his\r\nhabits being exceedingly simple and frugal, Mrs. Krüger being equally\r\nconservative and thrifty, preferring rather to expend money for her\r\nchildren and in unostentatious benevolence than in superfluities.\r\n\r\nPresident Krüger is an exemplary Christian, an earnest student of the\r\nBible since his youth, ever ready to employ his gifts to strengthen the\r\nfaith of his people and to maintain their religious standard. He often\r\noccupies the pulpit, and on other occasions gives exhorting discourses.\r\nUpon the completion of the imposing Johannesburg synagogue his Honour\r\nwas requested to preside at its dedication. It was an impressive\r\nfunction, and withal so anomalous and unrabbinical a departure--the head\r\nof the State, a devout Christian, opening the edifice for Jewish\r\nworship and addressing a discourse to the thousands of assembled\r\nIsraelites. In his zeal and concern Mr. Krüger could not refrain from\r\nadverting to their blessed Messiah, the God-man of Jewish stock,\r\nrejected through ignorance by their forefathers, exalted since, but who\r\nloved His people nevertheless, as typified by Joseph's narrative when he\r\nrevealed himself to his brethren in Egypt. He adjured them to a\r\nprayerful reading of their Old Testament, and he invoked God's mercy to\r\nremove the veil which obscured from their eyes their own and also the\r\nGentiles' glorious Immanuel. The ceremony was concluded with perfect\r\ndecorum, despite the surprise that the address had drifted into an\r\nimpassioned Gospel sermon.\r\n\r\nThis grand old Boer is the very personification of noble patriotism and\r\ndevoted concern for the welfare of his nation. While admiring and loving\r\nthe man, what sorrow on the one side and indignant execration on the\r\nother do not overwhelm one, seeing that such a pattern and leader of men\r\nshould have become the victim of that heartless Hollander coterie! One\r\ncannot but marvel at the same time at the alert skill and wily patience\r\nwhich must have been employed during the many years past to hold\r\nPresident Krüger with State Secretary Keitz and President Steyn in the\r\nAfrikaner Bond leash ready to let loose with unshaken convictions upon\r\nthe supreme contest designed for them and their people by the\r\nmachinations intended for upraising Holland at the risk of immolating\r\nthe victimized Boer nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACE ADJUSTMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon this topic a few remarks may be placed under the assumption that\r\nthe arch enemy's triumph in the present war will be circumscribed by the\r\nhavoc and the bereavements created by it, and by the forfeiture\r\ninflicted upon the poor deluded Boers of their special heirlooms. One of\r\nthe considerations would be the war cost and its recoupment, and another\r\nimportant one is the measures needful to prevent a repetition of a Bond\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\nAs to the war indemnity: it is well understood on all hands that the\r\nsupremacy of Great Britain, when once established as the result of the\r\nwar, will greatly enhance the value of all existing capital\r\ninvestments--10 to 50 per cent., and many even 100 per cent. It is not\r\nto be denied that capitalism has evinced decided eagerness that English\r\nsupremacy should be asserted, and it is in a manner amenable together\r\nwith the Afrikaner Bond, for secretly striving to bring about the\r\ncontest each independently in its own way, but without the least concert\r\nwith each other. It appears therefore equitable that capital should\r\nbecome contributable to the cost of the war which will eventually result\r\nin so largely enhancing its invested values.\r\n\r\nA tax of 2-1/2 per cent. upon the aggregate investment values and a\r\nroyalty upon the mining industries of 25 per cent. of the net profits\r\nwould appear reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe 2-1/2 per cent. tax might bring a sum of ....... 15 millions\r\n\r\nThe royalty could be reckoned at capitalized\r\n  value ............................................ 50     \"\r\n\r\nThe confiscations might reach ...................... 10     \"\r\n\r\nAnd the underground rights around the Johannesburg\r\n  mines might realize .............................. 50     \"\r\n\r\nThus together 125 millions, possibly not sufficient to cover the entire\r\nwar cost if pensions are to be included. It is a sad reflection to note\r\nthat the entire wealth which constituted the national heirloom of the\r\nTransvaal will have been wasted, and comes far short to cover the actual\r\nwar expenditure. In regard to preventive measures against another Bond\r\nwar, nothing appears clearer than the necessity of applying the _lex\r\ntalionis_ upon the Hollander element in South Africa (though not in that\r\ninhuman fashion as was practised upon the English refugees before and at\r\nthe commencement of the war).\r\n\r\nWhilst not so guilty to the same extent of enormity as the coterie in\r\nHolland, who devised all the Bond mischief at a safe distance, the\r\nHollanders in South Africa were nevertheless their eager abettors and\r\nsedulous henchmen. It will be remembered that the Bond cry had been\r\n\"Drive the English into the sea, out of Africa,\" and that the first\r\nearnest in carrying out that fiat was practised some months before the\r\noutbreak of the war upon the unaggressive coloured British subjects,\r\ntraders, merchants, etc., whose removal from their residences and\r\nbusinesses to ghettos outside the towns practically compassed their ruin\r\nand expulsion from the Transvaal. This was followed, first by a\r\nvoluntary and afterwards by the forced exodus of Uitlanders at the rate\r\nof thousands per day--men, women, and children packed in uncleansed coal\r\nand cattle trucks, together with Coolies, Kaffirs, and Hottentots, and\r\nhustled over the Portuguese border, dumped down at that death-trap\r\nKomati Poort if unable to pay the railway fare for fifty-three miles\r\nfurther to Delagoa Bay. Those refugees were obliged to abandon or\r\nsacrifice their belongings--they had no time allowed to realize them; it\r\nmeant their financial ruin.\r\n\r\nThat Hollander element comprises the most insidious menace, and, like a\r\ncancer, must be unsparingly excised from South Africa, unless\r\nencouragement is intended to be given for an attempt to go one better\r\nnext time, with a repetition, or rather an aggravation, of the horrors\r\nof war and the cost in life and treasure, turning the sub-continent into\r\na second vast Algeria, with perhaps such another \"Abd El Kadr\" to\r\nsubdue, and without any reserve asset, as now, to fall back upon towards\r\nreimbursing the expense. Their expulsion should, however, not be\r\neffected without giving some fair notice affording them time for the\r\nrealization of their estates. As to the Dutch language, it will not\r\nentail any excessive hardship if it is equally banished as an official\r\nlanguage, seeing that English is on the whole not more unfamiliar to the\r\nbulk of the Boer people than pure High Dutch is, and seeing that the\r\ndual right was accorded to Dutch as an official language under this\r\nalmost inconceivable feature, that it admittedly had yet to be learnt to\r\nbecome of any practical use or utility other than as an instrument for\r\nkeeping the races apart and to facilitate the Bond objects of usurpation\r\nand revolt.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS",
