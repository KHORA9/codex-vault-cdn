Millais, P.R.A, in\r\n                          the National Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V. 1859-1868\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. The Italian Revolution. (1859-1860)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Rarely, if ever, in the course of our history has there been such\r\n    a mixture of high considerations, legislative, military,\r\n    commercial, foreign, and constitutional, each for the most part\r\n    traversing the rest, and all capable of exercising a vital\r\n    influence on public policy, as in the long and complicated session\r\n    of 1860. The commercial treaty first struck the keynote of the\r\n    year; and the most deeply marked and peculiar feature of the year\r\n    was the silent conflict between the motives and provisions of the\r\n    treaty on the one hand, and the excitement and exasperation of\r\n    military sentiment on the other.—GLADSTONE.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis description extends in truth much beyond the session of a given year\r\nto the whole existence of the new cabinet, and through a highly important\r\nperiod in Mr. Gladstone’s career. More than that, it directly links our\r\nbiographic story to a series of events that created kingdoms, awoke\r\nnations, and re-made the map of Europe. The opening of this long and\r\ncomplex episode was the Italian revolution. Writing to Sir John Acton in\r\n1864 Mr. Gladstone said to him of the budget of 1860, “When viewed as a\r\nwhole, it is one of the few cases in which my fortunes as an individual\r\nhave been closely associated with matters of a public and even an historic\r\ninterest.” I will venture to recall in outline to the reader’s memory the\r\nampler background of this striking epoch in Mr. Gladstone’s public life.\r\nThe old principles of the European state-system, and the old principles\r\nthat inspired the vast contentions of ages, lingered but they seemed to\r\nhave grown decrepit. Divine right of kings, providential pre-eminence of\r\ndynasties, balance of power, sovereign independence of the papacy,—these\r\nand the other accredited catchwords of history were giving place to the\r\nvague, indefinable, shifting, but most potent and inspiring doctrine of\r\nNationality. On no statesman of this time did that fiery doctrine with all\r\nits tributaries gain more commanding hold than on Mr. Gladstone. “Of the\r\nvarious and important incidents,” he writes in a memorandum, dated\r\nBraemar, July 16, 1892, “which associated me almost unawares with foreign\r\naffairs in Greece (1850), in the Neapolitan kingdom (1851), and in the\r\nBalkan peninsula and the Turkish empire (1853), I will only say that they\r\nall contributed to forward the action of those home causes more continuous\r\nin their operation, which, without in any way effacing my old sense of\r\nreverence for the past, determined for me my place in the present and my\r\ndirection towards the future.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n(M1) At the opening of the seventh decade of the century—ten years of such\r\nmoment for our western world—the relations of the European states with one\r\nanother had fallen into chaos. The perilous distractions of 1859-62 were\r\nthe prelude to conflicts that after strange and mighty events at Sadowa,\r\nVenice, Rome, Sedan, Versailles, came to their close in 1871. The first\r\nbreach in the ramparts of European order set up by the kings after\r\nWaterloo, was the independence of Greece in 1829. Then followed the\r\ntransformation of the power of the Turk over Roumanians and Serbs from\r\ndespotism to suzerainty. In 1830 Paris overthrew monarchy by divine right;\r\nBelgium cut herself asunder from the supremacy of the Dutch; then Italians\r\nand Poles strove hard but in vain to shake off the yoke of Austria and of\r\nRussia. In 1848 revolts of race against alien dominion broke out afresh in\r\nItaly and Hungary. The rise of the French empire, bringing with it the\r\nprinciple or idiosyncrasy of its new ruler, carried this movement of race\r\ninto its full ascendant. Treaties were confronted by the doctrine of\r\nNationality. What called itself Order quaked before something that for\r\nlack of a better name was called the Revolution. Reason of State was\r\neclipsed by the Rights of Peoples. Such was the spirit of the new time.\r\n\r\nThe end of the Crimean war and the peace of Paris brought a temporary and\r\nsuperficial repose. The French ruler, by strange irony at once the sabre\r\nof Revolution and the trumpet of Order, made a beginning in urging the\r\nconstitution of a Roumanian nationality, by uniting the two Danubian\r\nprincipalities in a single quasi-independent state. This was obviously a\r\nfurther step towards that partition of Turkey which the Crimean war had\r\nbeen waged to prevent. Austria for reasons of her own objected, and\r\nEngland, still in her Turcophil humour, went with Austria against France\r\nfor keeping the two provinces, although in fiscal and military union,\r\npolitically divided. According to the fashion of that time—called a comedy\r\nby some, a homage to the democratic evangel by others—a popular vote was\r\ntaken. Its result was ingeniously falsified by the sultan (whose ability\r\nto speak French was one of the odd reasons why Lord Palmerston was\r\nsanguine about Turkish civilisation); western diplomacy insisted that the\r\nquestion of union should be put afresh. Mr. Gladstone, not then in office,\r\nwrote to Lord Aberdeen (Sept. 10, 1857):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The course taken about the Principalities has grieved me. I do not\r\n    mean so much this or that measure, as the principle on which it is\r\n    to rest. I thought we made war in order to keep Russia out, and\r\n    then suffer life, if it would, to take the place of death. But it\r\n    now seems to be all but avowed, that the fear of danger, not to\r\n    Europe, but to Islam,—and Islam not from Russia, but from the\r\n    Christians of Turkey,—is to be a ground for stinting their\r\n    liberties.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1858 (May 4) he urged the Derby government to support the declared wish\r\nof the people of Wallachia and Moldavia, and to fulfil the pledges made at\r\nParis in 1856. “Surely the best resistance to be offered to Russia,” he\r\nsaid, “is by the strength and freedom of those countries that will have to\r\nresist her. You want to place a living barrier between Russia and Turkey.\r\n_There is no barrier like the breast of freemen._” The union of the\r\nPrincipalities would raise up antagonists to the ambitions of Russia more\r\npowerful than any that could be bought with money. The motion was\r\nsupported by Lord John Russell and Lord Robert Cecil, but Disraeli and\r\nPalmerston joined in opposing it, and it was rejected by a large majority.\r\nMr. Gladstone wrote in his diary: “May 4.—H. of C.—Made my motion on the\r\nPrincipalities. Lost by 292:114; and with it goes another broken promise\r\nto a people.” So soon did the illusions and deceptions of the Crimean war\r\ncreep forth.\r\n\r\nIn no long time (1858) Roumania was created into a virtually independent\r\nstate. Meanwhile, much against Napoleon’s wish and policy, these\r\nproceedings chilled the alliance between France and England. Other powers\r\ngrew more and more uneasy, turning restlessly from side to side, like sick\r\nmen on their beds. The object of Russia ever since the peace had been,\r\nfirst to break down the intimacy between England and France, by flattering\r\nthe ambition and enthusiasm of the French Emperor; next to wreak her\r\nvengeance on Austria for offences during the Crimean war, still pronounced\r\nunpardonable. Austria, in turn, was far too slow for a moving age; she\r\nentrenched herself behind forms with too little heed to substance; and\r\nneighbours mistook her dulness for dishonesty. For the diplomatic air was\r\nthick and dark with suspicion. The rivalry of France and Austria in Italy\r\nwas the oldest of European stories, and for that matter the\r\nLombardo-Venetian province was a possession of material value to Austria,\r\nfor while only containing one-eighth of her population, it contributed\r\none-fourth of her revenue.\r\n\r\n(M2) The central figure upon the European stage throughout the time on\r\nwhich we are now about to enter was the ruler of France. The Crimean war\r\nappeared to have strengthened his dynasty at home, while faith in the\r\ndepth of his political designs and in the grandeur of his military power\r\nhad secured him predominance abroad. Europe hung upon his words; a\r\nsentence to an ambassador at a public audience on new year’s day, a\r\nparagraph in a speech at the opening of his parliament of puppets, a\r\npamphlet supposed to be inspired, was enough to shake Vienna, Turin,\r\nLondon, the Vatican, with emotions pitched in every key. Yet the mind of\r\nthis imposing and mysterious potentate was the shadowy home of vagrant\r\nideals and fugitive chimeras. It was said by one who knew him well,\r\n_Scratch the emperor and you will find the political refugee_. You will\r\nfind, that is to say, the man of fluctuating hope without firm calculation\r\nof fact, the man of half-shaped end with no sure eye to means. The sphinx\r\nin our modern politics is usually something of a charlatan, and in time\r\nthe spite of fortune brought this mock Napoleon into fatal conflict with\r\nthe supple, positive, practical genius of Italy in the person of one of\r\nthe hardiest representatives of this genius that Italy ever had; just as\r\nten years later the same nemesis brought him into collision with the\r\nstern, rough genius of the north in the person of Count Bismarck.\r\nMeanwhile the sovereigns of central and northern Europe had interviews at\r\nStuttgart, at Teplitz, at Warsaw. It was at Warsaw that the rulers of\r\nAustria and Prussia met the Czar at the end of 1860,—Poland quivering as\r\nshe saw the three crowned pirates choose the capital city of their victim\r\nfor a rendezvous. Russia declined to join what would have been a coalition\r\nagainst France, and the pope described the conference of Warsaw as three\r\nsovereigns assembling to hear one of them communicate to the other two the\r\norders of the Emperor of the French. The French empire was at its zenith.\r\nThiers said that the greatest compensation to a Frenchman for being\r\nnothing in his own country, was the sight of that country filling its\r\nright place in the world.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that at Turin on his way home from the Ionian\r\nIslands in the spring of 1859, Mr. Gladstone saw the statesman who was\r\ndestined to make Italy. Sir James Hudson, our ambassador at the court of\r\nPiedmont, had sounded Cavour as to his disposition to receive the\r\nreturning traveller. Cavour replied, “I hope you will do all you can to\r\nbring such a proceeding about. I set the highest value on the visit of a\r\nstatesman so distinguished and such a friend of Italy as Mr. Gladstone.”\r\nIn conveying this message to Mr. Gladstone (Feb. 7, 1859), Hudson adds, “I\r\ncan only say I think your counsels may be very useful to this government,\r\nand that I look to your coming here as a means possibly of composing\r\ndifferences, which may, if not handled by some such calm unprejudiced\r\nstatesman as yourself, lead to very serious disturbances in the European\r\nbody politic.” Mr. Gladstone dined at Cavour’s table at the foreign\r\noffice, where, among other things, he had the satisfaction of hearing his\r\nhost speak of Hudson as _quel uomo italianissimo_. Ministers, the\r\npresident of the chamber, and other distinguished persons were present,\r\nand Cavour was well pleased to have the chance of freely opening his\r\nposition and policy to “one of the sincerest and most important friends\r\nthat Italy had.”(2)\r\n\r\nAmong Cavour’s difficulties at this most critical moment was the attitude\r\nof England. The government of Lord Derby, true to the Austrian sympathies\r\nof his party, and the German sympathies of the court, accused Italy of\r\nendangering the peace of Europe. “No,” said Cavour, “it is the statesmen,\r\nthe diplomatists, the writers of England, who are responsible for the\r\ntroubled situation of Italy; for is it not they who have worked for years\r\nto kindle political passion in our peninsula, and is it not England that\r\nhas encouraged Sardinia to oppose the propaganda of moral influences to\r\nthe illegitimate predominance of Austria in Italy?” To Mr. Gladstone, who\r\nhad seen the Austrian forces in Venetia and in Lombardy, he said, “You\r\nbehold for yourself, that it is Austria who menaces us; here we are\r\ntranquil; the country is calm; we will do our duty; England is wrong in\r\nidentifying peace with the continuance of Austrian domination.” Two or\r\nthree days later the Piedmontese minister made one of those momentous\r\nvisits to Paris that forced a will less steadfast than his own.\r\n\r\nThe French Emperor in his dealings with Cavour had entangled himself, in\r\nMr. Gladstone’s phrase, with “a stronger and better informed intellect\r\nthan his own.” “Two men,” said Guizot, “at this moment divide the\r\nattention of Europe, the Emperor Napoleon and Count Cavour. The match has\r\nbegun. I back Count Cavour.” The game was long and subtly played. It was\r\ndifficult for the ruler who had risen to power by bloodstained usurpation\r\nand the perfidious ruin of a constitution, to keep in step with a\r\nstatesman, the inspiring purpose of whose life was the deliverance of his\r\ncountry by the magic of freedom. Yet Napoleon was an organ of European\r\nrevolution in a double sense. He proclaimed the doctrine of nationality,\r\nand paid decorous homage to the principle of appeal to the popular voice.\r\nIn time England appeared upon the scene, and by his flexible management of\r\nthe two western powers, England and France, Cavour executed the most\r\nstriking political transformation in the history of contemporary Europe.\r\nIt brought, however, as Mr. Gladstone speedily found, much trouble into\r\nthe relations of the two western powers with one another.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the Derby government and the accession of the whigs\r\nexactly coincided in time with the struggle between Austria and the\r\nFranco-Sardinian allies on the bloody fields of Magenta and Solferino. A\r\nfew days after Mr. Gladstone took office, the French and Austrian emperors\r\nand King Victor Emmanuel signed those preliminaries of Villafranca (July\r\n11, 1859), which summarily ended an inconclusive war by the union of\r\nLombardy to the Piedmontese kingdom, and the proposed erection of an\r\nItalian federation over which it was hoped that the pope might preside,\r\nand of which Venetia, still remaining Austrian, should be a member. The\r\nscheme was intrinsically futile, but it served its turn. The Emperor of\r\nthe French was driven to peace by mixed motives. The carnage of Solferino\r\nappalled or unnerved him; he had revealed to his soldiers and to France\r\nthat their ruler had none of the genius of a great commander; the clerical\r\nparty at home fiercely assailed the prolongation of a war that must put\r\nthe pope in peril; the case of Poland, the case of Hungary, might almost\r\nany day be kindled into general conflagration by the freshly lighted torch\r\nof Nationality; above all, Germany might stride forward to the Rhine to\r\navenge the repulse of Austria on the Po and the Mincio.(3)\r\n\r\nWhatever the motive, Villafranca was a rude check to Italian aspirations.\r\nCavour in poignant rage peremptorily quitted office, rather than share\r\nresponsibility for this abortive end of all the astute and deep-laid\r\ncombinations for ten years past, that had brought the hated Austrian from\r\nthe triumph of Novara down to the defeat of Solferino. Before many months\r\nhe once more grasped the helm. In the interval the movement went forward\r\nas if all his political tact, his prudence, his suppleness, his patience,\r\nand his daring, had passed into the whole population of central Italy. For\r\neight months after Villafranca, it seemed as if the deep and politic\r\ntemper that built up the old Roman Commonwealth, were again alive in\r\nBologna, Parma, Modena, Florence. When we think of the pitfalls that lay\r\non every side, how easily France might have been irritated or estranged,\r\nwhat unseasonable questions might not unnaturally have been forced\r\nforward, what mischief the voice and spirit of the demagogue might have\r\nstirred up, there can surely be no more wonderful case in history of\r\nstrong and sagacious leaders, Cavour, Farini, Ricasoli, the Piedmontese\r\nking, guiding a people through the ferments of revolt, with discipline,\r\nenergy, legality, order, self-control, to the achievement of a\r\nconstructive revolution. Without the sword of France the work could not\r\nhave been begun; but it was the people and statesmen of northern and\r\ncentral Italy who in these eight months made the consummation possible.\r\nAnd England, too, had no inconsiderable share; for it was she who secured\r\nthe principle of non-intervention by foreign powers in Italian affairs; it\r\nwas she who strongly favoured the annexation of central Italy to the new\r\nkingdom in the north. Here it was that England directly and unconsciously\r\nopened the way to a certain proceeding that when it came to pass she\r\npassionately resented. In the first three weeks of March (1860) Victor\r\nEmmanuel legalised in due form the annexation of the four central states\r\nto Piedmont and Lombardy, and in the latter half of April he made his\r\nentry into Florence. Cavour attended him, and strange as it sounds, he now\r\nfor the first time in his life beheld the famed city,—centre of undying\r\nbeauty and so many glories in the history of his country and the genius of\r\nmankind. In one spot at least his musings might well have been\r\nprofound—the tomb of Machiavelli, the champion of principles three\r\ncenturies before, to guide that armed reformer, part fox part lion, who\r\nshould one day come to raise up an Italy one and independent. The\r\nFlorentine secretary’s orb never quite sets, and it was now rising to a\r\nlurid ascendant in the politics of Europe for a long generation to come,\r\nlighting up the unblest gospel that whatever policy may demand justice\r\nwill allow.(4)\r\n\r\n(M3) On March 24 Cavour paid Napoleon a bitter price for his assent to\r\nannexation, by acquiescing in the cession to France of Savoy and Nice,\r\nprovinces that were, one of them the cradle of the royal race, the other\r\nthe birthplace of Garibaldi, the hero of the people. In this transaction\r\nthe theory of the _plébiscite_, or direct popular vote upon a given\r\nquestion, for the first time found a place among the clauses of a\r\ndiplomatic act. The _plébiscite_, though stigmatised as a hypocritical\r\nfarce, and often no better than a formal homage paid by violence or\r\nintrigue to public right, was a derivative from the doctrines of\r\nnationality and the sovereignty of the people then ruling in Europe. The\r\nissue of the operation in Savoy and Nice was what had been anticipated.\r\nItaly bore the stroke with wise fortitude, but England when she saw the\r\nbargain closed for which she had herself prepared the way, took fierce\r\numbrage at the aggrandisement of France, and heavy clouds floated into the\r\nEuropean sky. As we have seen, the first act of the extraordinary drama\r\nclosed at Villafranca. The curtain fell next at Florence upon the fusion\r\nof central with upper Italy. Piedmont, a secondary state, had now grown to\r\nbe a kingdom with eleven or twelve millions of inhabitants. Greater things\r\nwere yet to follow. Ten millions still remained in the south under the\r\nyoke of Bourbons and the Vatican. The third act, most romantic, most\r\npicturesque of all, an incomparable union of heroism with policy at double\r\nplay with all the shifts of circumstance, opened a few weeks later.\r\n\r\nThe great unsolved problem was the pope. The French ambassador at the\r\nVatican in those days chanced to have had diplomatic experience in Turkey.\r\nHe wrote to his government in Paris that the pope and his cardinals\r\nreminded him of nothing so much as the sultan and his ulemas—the same\r\nvacillation, the same shifty helplessness, the same stubborn\r\nimpenetrability. The Cross seemed in truth as grave a danger in one\r\nquarter of Europe as was the Crescent in another, and the pope was now to\r\nundergo the same course of territorial partition as had befallen the head\r\nof a rival faith. For ten years the priests had been maintained in their\r\nevilly abused authority by twenty thousand French bayonets—the bayonets of\r\nthe empire that the cardinals with undisguised ingratitude distrusted and\r\nhated.(5) The Emperor was eager to withdraw his force, if only he were\r\nsure that no catastrophe would result to outrage the catholic world and\r\nbring down his own throne.\r\n\r\nUnluckily for this design, Garibaldi interposed. One night in May (1860),\r\nsoon after the annexation to Piedmont of the four central states, the hero\r\nwhom an admirer described as “a summary of the lives of Plutarch,” sailed\r\nforth from Genoa for the deliverance of the Sicilian insurgents. In the\r\neyes of Garibaldi and his Thousand, Sicily and Naples marked the path that\r\nled to Rome. The share of Cavour as accomplice in the adventure is still\r\nobscure. Whether he even really desired the acquisition of the Neapolitan\r\nkingdom, or would have preferred, as indeed he attempted, a federation\r\nbetween a northern kingdom and a southern, is not established. How far he\r\nhad made certain of the abstention of Louis Napoleon, how far he had\r\nrealised the weakness of Austria, we do not authentically know. He was at\r\nleast alive to all the risks to which Garibaldi’s enterprise must\r\ninstantly expose him in every quarter of the horizon—from Austria, deeming\r\nher hold upon Venetia at stake; from the French Emperor, with hostile\r\nclericals in France to face; from the whole army of catholics all over the\r\nworld; and not least from triumphant Mazzinians, his personal foes, in\r\nwhose inspirations he had no faith, whose success might easily roll him\r\nand his policy into mire and ruin. Now as always with consummate\r\nsuppleness he confronted the necessities of a situation that he had not\r\nsought, and assuredly had neither invented nor hurried. The politician, he\r\nused to tell his friends, must above all things have the tact of the\r\nPossible. Well did Manzoni say of him, “Cavour has all the prudence and\r\nall the imprudence of the true statesman.” Stained and turbid are the\r\nwhirlpools of revolution. Yet the case of Italy was overwhelming. Sir\r\nJames Hudson wrote to Mr. Gladstone from Turin (April 3, 1859)—“Piedmont\r\ncannot separate the question of national independence from the accidental\r\nexistence of constitutional liberty (in Piedmont) if she would.\r\nMisgovernment in central Italy, heavy taxation and dearth in Lombardy,\r\nmisgovernment in Modena, vacillation in Tuscany, cruelty in Naples,\r\nconstitute the famous _grido di dolore_. The congress of Paris wedded\r\nPiedmont to the redress of grievances.”\r\n\r\n(M4) In August (1860) Garibaldi crossed from Sicily to the mainland and\r\nspeedily made his triumphant entry into Naples. The young king Francis\r\nwithdrew before him at the head of a small force of faithful adherents to\r\nCapua, afterwards to Gaeta. At the Volturno the Garibaldians, meeting a\r\nvigorous resistance, drove back a force of the royal troops enormously\r\nsuperior in numbers. On the height of this agitated tide, and just in time\r\nto forestall a fatal movement of Garibaldi upon Rome, the Sardinian army\r\nhad entered the territories of the pope (September 11).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the series of transactions that I have sketched, the sympathies of Mr.\r\nGladstone never wavered. From the appearance of his Neapolitan letters in\r\n1851, he lost no opportunity of calling attention to Italian affairs. In\r\n1854 he brought before Lord Clarendon the miserable condition of Poerio,\r\nSettembrini, and the rest. He took great personal trouble in helping to\r\nraise and invest a fund for the Settembrini family, and elaborate accounts\r\nin his own handwriting remain. In 1855 he wrote to Lord John Russell, then\r\nstarting for Vienna, as to a rumour of the adhesion of Naples to the\r\nalliance of the western powers: “In any case I can conceive it possible\r\nthat the Vienna conferences may touch upon Italian questions; and I\r\nsincerely rely upon your humanity as well as your love of freedom, indeed\r\nthe latter is but little in question, to plead for the prisoners in the\r\nkingdom of the two Sicilies detained for political offences, real or\r\npretended. I do not ask you to leave any greater duty undone, but to bear\r\nin mind the singular claims on your commiseration of these most unhappy\r\npersons, if occasion offers.”\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, it was long before he advanced to the view of the\r\nthoroughgoing school. Like nearly all his countrymen, he was at first a\r\nreformer, not a revolutionary. To the Marquis Dragonetti, Mr. Gladstone\r\nwrote from Broadstairs in 1854:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Naples has a government as bad as anarchy; Rome unites the evils\r\n    of the worst government and the most entire anarchy. In those\r\n    countries I can hardly imagine any change that would not be for\r\n    the better. But in the wild opinions of some of your political\r\n    sectaries, I see the best and most available defence of the\r\n    existing system with its hideous mischiefs. Almost every Italian\r\n    who heartily desires the removal from Italy and from the face of\r\n    the earth of the immeasurable evils which your country now suffers\r\n    through some of its governments, adopts Italian union and national\r\n    independence for his watchwords.... Do not think it presumption,\r\n    for it is the mere description of a fact, if I say, we in England\r\n    cannot bring our minds to this mode of looking at the Italian\r\n    question. All our habits, all our instincts, all our history lead\r\n    us in another direction. In our view this is not building from the\r\n    bottom upwards, but from the top downwards.... All our experience\r\n    has been to the effect that the champion of liberty should take\r\n    his ground, not upon any remote or abstract proposition, but upon\r\n    the right of man, under every law divine and human, first to good\r\n    government, and next to the institutions which are the necessary\r\n    guarantees of it.... We sympathise strongly, I believe, with the\r\n    victims of misgovernment, but the English mind is not shocked _in\r\n    limine_ at the notion of people belonging to one race and\r\n    language, yet politically incorporated or associated with another;\r\n    and of Italian unity, I think the language of this nation would\r\n    be, We shall be glad if it proves to be feasible, but the\r\n    condition of it must be gradually matured by a course of\r\n    improvement in the several states, and by the political education\r\n    of the people; if it cannot be reached by these means, it hardly\r\n    will be by any others; and certainly not by opinions which closely\r\n    link Italian reconstruction with European disorganisation and\r\n    general war.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far removed at this date was Mr. Gladstone from the glorified democracy\r\nof the Mazzinian propaganda. He told Cobden that when he returned from\r\nCorfu in the spring of 1859, he found in England not only a government\r\nwith strong Austrian leanings, but to his great disappointment not even\r\nthe House of Commons so alive as he could have wished upon the Italian\r\nquestion. “It was in my opinion the authority and zeal of Lord Palmerston\r\nand Lord John Russell in this question, that kindled the country.”\r\n\r\nWhile Europe was anxiously watching the prospects of war between France\r\nand Austria, Mr. Gladstone spoke in debate (April 18, 1859) upon the\r\nsituation, to express his firm conviction that no plan of peace could be\r\ndurable which failed to effect some mitigation of the sore evils\r\nafflicting the Italian peninsula. The course of events after the peace\r\nspeedily ripened both his opinions and the sentiment of the country, and\r\nhe was as angry as his neighbours at the unexpected preliminaries of\r\nVillafranca. “I little thought,” he wrote to Poerio (July 15, 1859), “to\r\nhave lived to see the day when the conclusion of a peace should in my own\r\nmind cause disgust rather than impart relief. But that day has come. I\r\nappreciate all the difficulties of the position both of the King of\r\nSardinia and of Count Cavour. It is hardly possible for me to pass a\r\njudgment upon his resignation as a political step: but I think few will\r\ndoubt that the moral character of the act is high. The duties of England\r\nin respect to the Italian question are limited by her powers, and these\r\nare greatly confined. But her sentiments cannot change, because they are\r\nfounded upon a regard to the deepest among those principles which regulate\r\nthe intercourse of men and their formation into political societies.” By\r\nthe end of the year, he softened his judgment of the proceedings of the\r\nFrench Emperor.\r\n\r\n(M5) The heavy load of his other concerns did not absolve him in his\r\nconscience from duty to the Italian cause:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 3, 1860._—I sat up till 2 A.M. with my letter to Ld. J.\r\n    Russell about Italy, and had an almost sleepless night for it.\r\n    4.—2-½ hours with the Prince Consort, _à deux reprises_, about the\r\n    Italian question, which was largely stated on both sides. I\r\n    thought he admitted so much as to leave him no standing ground.\r\n    5.—Went down to Pembroke Lodge and passed the evening with Lord\r\n    John and his family. Lord John and I had much conversation on\r\n    Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a cabinet memorandum (Jan. 3, 1860), he declared himself bound in\r\ncandour to admit that the Emperor had shown, “though partial and\r\ninconsistent, indications of a genuine feeling for the Italians—and far\r\nbeyond this he has committed himself very considerably to the Italian\r\ncause in the face of the world. When in reply to all that, we fling in his\r\nface the truce of Villafranca, he may reply—and the answer is not without\r\nforce—that he stood single-handed in a cause when any moment Europe might\r\nhave stood combined against him. We gave him verbal sympathy and\r\nencouragement, or at least criticism; no one else gave him anything at\r\nall. No doubt he showed then that he had undertaken a work to which his\r\npowers were unequal; but I do not think that, when fairly judged, he can\r\nbe said to have given proof by that measure of insincerity or\r\nindifference.” This was no more than justice, it is even less; and both\r\nItalians and Englishmen have perhaps been too ready to forget that the\r\nfreedom of Italy would have remained an empty hope if Napoleon iii. had\r\nnot unsheathed his sword.\r\n\r\n(M6) After discussing details, Mr. Gladstone laid down in his memorandum a\r\ngeneral maxim for the times, that “the alliance with France is the true\r\nbasis of peace in Europe, for England and France never will unite in any\r\nEuropean purpose which is radically unjust.” He put the same view in a\r\nletter to Lacaita a few months later (Sept. 16): “A close alliance between\r\nEngland and France cannot be used for mischief, and cannot provoke any\r\ndangerous counter combination; but a close alliance between England and\r\nother powers would provoke a dangerous counter combination immediately,\r\nbesides that it could not in itself be trusted. My own leaning, therefore,\r\nis not indeed to place reliance on the French Emperor, but to interpret\r\nhim candidly, and in Italian matters especially to recollect the great\r\ndifficulties in which he is placed, (1) because, whether by his own fault\r\nor not, he cannot reckon upon strong support from England when he takes a\r\nright course. (2) Because he has his own ultramontane party in France to\r\ndeal with, whom, especially if not well supported abroad, he cannot afford\r\nto defy.”\r\n\r\nAs everybody soon saw, it was the relation of Louis Napoleon to the French\r\nultramontanes that constituted the tremendous hazard of the Piedmontese\r\ninvasion of the territories of the pope. This critical proceeding\r\ncommitted Cavour to a startling change, and henceforth he was constrained\r\nto advance to Italian unity. A storm of extreme violence broke upon him.\r\nGortchakoff said that if geography had permitted, the Czar would betake\r\nhimself to arms in defence of the Bourbon king. Prussia talked of reviving\r\nthe holy alliance in defence of the law of nations against the overweening\r\nambition of Piedmont. The French ambassador was recalled from Turin. Still\r\nno active intervention followed.\r\n\r\nOne great power alone stood firm, and Lord John Russell wrote one of the\r\nmost famous despatches in the history of our diplomacy (October 27, 1860).\r\nThe governments of the pope and the king of the Two Sicilies, he said,\r\nprovided so ill for the welfare of their people, that their subjects\r\nlooked to their overthrow as a necessary preliminary to any improvement.\r\nHer Majesty’s government were bound to admit that the Italians themselves\r\nare the best judges of their own interests. Vattel, that eminent jurist,\r\nhad well said that when a people for good reasons take up arms against an\r\noppressor, it is but an act of justice and generosity to assist brave men\r\nin the defence of their liberties. Did the people of Naples and the Roman\r\nStates take up arms against their government for good reasons? Upon this\r\ngrave matter, her Majesty’s government held that the people in question\r\nare themselves the best judges of their own affairs. Her Majesty’s\r\ngovernment did not feel justified in declaring that the people of Southern\r\nItaly had not good reasons for throwing off their allegiance to their\r\nformer governments. Her Majesty’s government, therefore, could not pretend\r\nto blame the King of Sardinia for assisting them. So downright was the\r\nlanguage of Lord John. We cannot wonder that such words as these spread in\r\nItaly like flame, that people copied the translation from each other,\r\nweeping over it for joy and gratitude in their homes, and that it was\r\nhailed as worth more than a force of a hundred thousand men.(6)\r\n\r\nThe sensation elsewhere was no less profound, though very different. The\r\nthree potentates at Warsaw viewed the despatch with an emotion that was\r\ndiplomatically called regret, but more resembled horror. The Prince Regent\r\nof Prussia, afterwards the Emperor William, told Prince Albert that it was\r\na tough morsel, a disruption of the law of nations and of the holy ties\r\nthat bind peoples to their sovereigns.(7) Many in England were equally\r\nshocked. Even Sir James Graham, for instance, said that he would never\r\nhave believed that such a document could have passed through a British\r\ncabinet or received the approval of a British sovereign; India, Ireland,\r\nCanada would await the application of the fatal doctrine that it\r\ncontained; it was a great public wrong, a grave error; and even Garibaldi\r\nand Mazzini would come out of the Italian affair with cleaner hands. Yet\r\nto-day we may ask ourselves, was it not a little idle to talk of the holy\r\nties that bind nations to their sovereigns, in respect of a system under\r\nwhich in Naples thousands of the most respectable of the subjects of the\r\nking were in prison or in exile; in the papal states ordinary justice was\r\nadministered by rough-handed German soldiers, and young offenders shot by\r\ncourt-martial at the drumhead; and in the Lombardo-Venetian provinces\r\npress offences were judged by martial law, with chains, shooting, and\r\nflogging for punishment.(8) Whatever may be thought of Lord John and his\r\ndoctrine, only those who hold to the converse doctrine, that subjects may\r\nnever rise against a king, nor ever under any circumstances seek succour\r\nfrom foreign power, will deny that the cruelties of Naples and the\r\niniquities connected with the temporal authority of the clergy in the\r\nstates of the church, constituted an irrefragable case for revolt.\r\n\r\n(M7) Within a few weeks after the troops of Victor Emmanuel had crossed\r\nthe frontier (Sept. 1860), the papal forces had been routed, and a popular\r\nvote in the Neapolitan kingdom supported annexation to Piedmont. The papal\r\nstates, with the exception of the patrimony of St. Peter in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of Rome itself, fell into the hands of the king. Victor\r\nEmmanuel and Garibaldi rode into Naples side by side (Nov. 7). The Bourbon\r\nflag after a long stand was at last lowered at the stronghold of Gaeta\r\n(Feb. 14, 1861); the young Bourbon king became an exile for the rest of\r\nhis life; and on February 18 the first parliament of united Italy\r\nassembled at Turin—Venice and Rome for a short season still outside. A few\r\nmonths before, Mr. Gladstone had written a long letter to d’Azeglio. It\r\nwas an earnest exposition of the economic and political ideals that seemed\r\nto shine in the firmament above a nation now emerging from the tomb. The\r\nletter was to be shown to Cavour. “Tell that good friend of ours,” he\r\nreplied, “that our trade laws are the most liberal of the continent; that\r\nfor ten years we have been practising the maxims that he exhorts us to\r\nadopt; tell him that he preaches to the converted.”(9) Then one of those\r\ndisasters happened that seem to shake the planetary nations out of their\r\npre-appointed orbits. Cavour died.(10)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. The Great Budget. (1860-1861)\r\n\r\n\r\n    It was said that by this treaty the British nation was about\r\n    blindly to throw herself into the arms of this constant and\r\n    uniform foe.... Did it not much rather, by opening new sources of\r\n    wealth, speak this forcible language—that the interval of peace,\r\n    as it would enrich the nation, would also prove the means of\r\n    enabling her to combat her enemy with more effect when the day of\r\n    hostility should come? It did more than this; by promoting habits\r\n    of friendly intercourse and of mutual benefit, while it\r\n    invigorated the resources of Britain, it made it less likely that\r\n    she should have occasion to call forth these resources.—PITT\r\n    (February 12, 1787).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we survey the panorama of a great man’s life, conspicuous peaks of time\r\nand act stand out to fix the eye, and in our statesman’s long career the\r\nbudget of 1860 with its spurs of appendant circumstance, is one of these\r\ncommanding points. In the letter to Acton already quoted (p. 1), Mr.\r\nGladstone says:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Before parliament met in 1860, the ’situation’ was very greatly\r\n    _tightened_ and _enhanced_ by three circumstances. First, the\r\n    disaster in China.(11) Secondly, a visit of Mr. Cobden’s to\r\n    Hawarden, when he proposed to me in a garden stroll, the French\r\n    treaty, and I, for myself and my share, adopted it (nor have I\r\n    ever for a moment repented or had a doubt) as rapidly as the\r\n    tender of office two months before. Thirdly, and the gravest of\r\n    all, the Savoy affair. If, as is supposed, I have Quixotism in my\r\n    nature, I can assure you that I was at this juncture much more\r\n    than satiated, and could have wished with Penelope that the\r\n    whirlwind would take me up, and carry me to the shore of the great\r\n    stream of Ocean.(12) And the wish would in this point not have\r\n    been extravagant: the whirlwind was there ready to hand. In and\r\n    from the midst of it was born the budget of 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe financial arrangements of 1859 were avowedly provisional and\r\ntemporary, and need not detain us. The only feature was a rise in the\r\nincome tax from fivepence to ninepence—its highest figure so far in a time\r\nof peace. “My budget,” he wrote to Mrs. Gladstone (July 16), “is just\r\nthrough the cabinet, very kindly and well received, no one making\r\nobjection but Lewis, who preached low doctrine. It confirms me in the\r\nbelief I have long had, that he was fitter for most other offices than for\r\nthat I now hold.” “_July 21 or rather 22, one A.M._—Just come back from a\r\nlong night and stiff contention at the House of Commons.... It has been\r\nrather nice and close fighting. Disraeli made a popular motion to trip me\r\nup, but had to withdraw it, at any rate for the time. This I can say, it\r\nwas not so that I used him. I am afraid that the truce between us is over,\r\nand that we shall have to pitch in as before.”\r\n\r\nThe only important speech was one on Italy (August 8),(13) of which\r\nDisraeli said that though they were always charmed by the speaker’s\r\neloquence, this was a burst of even unusual brilliance, and it gave\r\npleasure in all quarters. “Spoke for an _oretta_ [short hour],” says the\r\norator, “on Italian affairs; my best offhand speech.” “The fish dinner,”\r\nMr. Gladstone writes, “went off very well, and I think my proposing Lord\r\nPalmerston’s health (without speech) was decidedly approved. I have had a\r\nwarm message from Lord Lansdowne about my speech; and Lord P. told me that\r\non Tuesday night as he went upstairs on getting home he heard Lady P.\r\nspouting as she read by candle-light; it turned out to be the same\r\neffusion.”\r\n\r\nAnother incident briefly related to Mrs. Gladstone brings us on to more\r\nserious ground: “_Hawarden, Sept. 12._—Cobden came early. Nothing could be\r\nbetter than the luncheon, but I am afraid the dinner will be rather strong\r\nwith local clergy. I have had a walk and long talk with Cobden who, I\r\nthink, pleases and is pleased.” This was the garden walk of which we have\r\njust heard, where Cobden, the ardent hopeful sower, scattered the good\r\nseed into rich ground. The idea of a commercial treaty with France was in\r\nthe air. Bright had opened it, Chevalier had followed it up, Persigny\r\nagreed, Cobden made an opportunity, Gladstone seized it. Cobden’s first\r\nsuggestion had been that as he was about to spend a part of the winter in\r\nParis, he might perhaps be of use to Mr. Gladstone in the way of inquiry.\r\nConversation expanded this into something more definite and more\r\nenergetic. Why should he not, with the informal sanction of the British\r\ngovernment, put himself into communication with the Emperor and his\r\nministers, and work out with them the scheme of a treaty that should at\r\nonce open the way to a great fiscal reform in both countries, and in both\r\ncountries produce a solid and sterling pacification of feeling? Cobden saw\r\nPalmerston and tried to see Lord John Russell, and though he hardly\r\nreceived encouragement, at least he was not forbidden to proceed upon his\r\nvolunteered mission.(14) “Gladstone,” wrote Cobden to Mr. Bright, “is\r\nreally almost the only cabinet minister of five years’ standing who is not\r\nafraid to let his heart guide his head a little at times.” The Emperor had\r\nplayed with the idea of a more open trade for five or six years, and\r\nCobden, with his union of economic, moral, and social elements, and his\r\nincomparable gifts of argumentative persuasion, was the very man to strike\r\nNapoleon’s impressionable mind. Although, having alienated the clericals\r\nby his Italian policy, the ruler of France might well have hesitated\r\nbefore proceeding to alienate the protectionists also, he became a convert\r\nand did not shrink.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Both Cobden and I, says Mr. Gladstone, were keenly in favour of\r\n    such a treaty (I myself certainly), without intending thereby to\r\n    signify the smallest disposition to the promotion of tariff\r\n    treaties in general. I had been an active party to the various\r\n    attempts under Sir Robert Peel’s government to conclude such\r\n    treaties, and was as far as possible removed from any disposition\r\n    to the renewal of labour which was in itself so profitless, and\r\n    which was dangerously near to a practical assertion of a false\r\n    principle, namely that the reductions of indirect taxation,\r\n    permitted by fiscal considerations, are in themselves injurious to\r\n    the country that makes them, and are only to be entertained when a\r\n    compensation can be had for them.(15) ... The correspondence which\r\n    would in the ordinary course have been exchanged between the\r\n    foreign offices of the two countries, was carried through in a\r\n    series of personal letters between Mr. Cobden and myself. I\r\n    remember indeed that the Emperor or his government were desirous\r\n    to conceal from their own foreign minister (Walewski) the fact\r\n    that such a measure was in contemplation. On our side, the method\r\n    pursued was only recommended by practical considerations. I\r\n    contemplated including the conditions of the French treaty in a\r\n    new and sweeping revision of the tariff, the particulars of which\r\n    it was of course important to keep from the public eye until they\r\n    were ready to be submitted to parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1859 the question of the treaty was brought into the\r\ncabinet, and there met with no general opposition, though some objection\r\nwas taken by Lewis and Wood, based on the ground that they ought not to\r\ncommit themselves by treaty engagements to a sacrifice of revenue, until\r\nthey had before them the income and the charges of the year. Writing to\r\nhis wife about some invitation to a country house, Mr. Gladstone says\r\n(Jan. 11, 1860):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I cannot go without a clear sacrifice of public duty. For the\r\n    measure is of immense importance and of no less nicety, and here\r\n    it all depends on me. Lord John backs me most cordially and well,\r\n    but it is no small thing to get a cabinet to give up one and a\r\n    half or two millions of revenue at a time when all the public\r\n    passion is for enormous expenditure, and in a case beset with\r\n    great difficulties. In _fact_, a majority of the cabinet is\r\n    indifferent or averse, but they have behaved very well. I almost\r\n    always agree with Lewis on other matters, but in trade and finance\r\n    I do not find his opinions satisfactory. Till it is through, this\r\n    vital question will need my closest and most anxious attention.\r\n    [Two days later he writes:] The cabinet has been again on the\r\n    French treaty. There are four or five zealous, perhaps as many who\r\n    would rather be without it. It has required pressure, but we have\r\n    got sufficient power now, if the French will do what is\r\n    reasonable. Lord John has been excellent, Palmerston rather\r\n    neutral. It is really a great European operation. [A fortnight\r\n    later (_Jan. 28_):] A word to say I have opened the fundamental\r\n    parts of my budget in the cabinet, and that I could not have hoped\r\n    a better reception. Nothing decided, for I did not ask it, and\r\n    indeed the case was not complete, but there was no general\r\n    [resistance], no decided objection; the tone of questioning was\r\n    favourable, Granville and Argyll delighted, Newcastle, I think,\r\n    ditto. Thank God.\r\n\r\n    _To Cobden, Jan. 28._—Criticism is busy; but the only thing really\r\n    formidable is the unavowed but strong conflict with that\r\n    passionate expectation of war, which no more bears disappointment\r\n    than if it were hope or love. _Feb. 6._—Cobbett once compared an\r\n    insignificant public man in an important situation to the\r\n    linch-pin in the carriage, and my position recalls his very apt\r\n    figure to my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course in his zeal for the treaty and its connection with tariff\r\nreform, Mr. Gladstone believed that the operation would open a great\r\nvolume of trade and largely enrich the country. But in one sense this was\r\nthe least of it:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I had a reason of a higher order. The French Emperor had launched\r\n    his project as to Savoy and Nice. It should have been plain to all\r\n    those who desired an united Italy, that such an Italy ought not to\r\n    draw Savoy in its wake; a country severed from it by the\r\n    mountains, by language, by climate, and I suppose by pursuits. But\r\n    it does not follow that Savoy should have been tacked on to\r\n    France, while for the annexation of Nice it was difficult to find\r\n    a word of apology. But it could scarcely be said to concern our\r\n    interests, while there was not the shadow of a case of honour. The\r\n    susceptibilities of England were, however, violently aroused. Even\r\n    Lord Russell used imprudent language in parliament about looking\r\n    for other allies. A French panic prevailed as strong as any of the\r\n    other panics that have done so much discredit to this country. For\r\n    this panic, the treaty of commerce with France was the only\r\n    sedative. It was in fact a counter-irritant; and it aroused the\r\n    sense of commercial interest to counteract the war passion. It was\r\n    and is my opinion, that the choice lay between the Cobden treaty\r\n    and not the certainty, but the high probability, of a war with\r\n    France. (_Undated memo._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of the commercial treaty grew the whole of the great financial scheme\r\nof 1860. By his first budget Mr. Gladstone had marked out this year for a\r\nnotable epoch in finance. Happily it found him at the exchequer. The\r\nexpiry of certain annuities payable to the public creditor removed a\r\ncharge of some two millions, and Mr. Gladstone was vehemently resolved\r\nthat this amount should not “pass into the great gulf of expenditure there\r\nto be swallowed up.” If the year, in such circumstances, is to pass, he\r\nsaid to Cobden, “without anything done for trade and the masses, it will\r\nbe a great discredit and a great calamity.” The alterations of duty\r\nrequired for the French treaty were made possible by the lapse of the\r\nannuities, and laid the foundation of a plan that averted the discredit\r\nand calamity of doing nothing for trade, and nothing for the masses of the\r\npopulation. France engaged to reduce duties and remove prohibitions on a\r\nlong list of articles of British production and export, iron the most\r\nimportant,—“the daily bread of all industries,” as Cobden called it.\r\nEngland engaged immediately to abolish all duties upon all manufactured\r\narticles at her ports, and to reduce the duties on wine and brandy. The\r\nEnglish reductions and abolitions extended beyond France to the\r\ncommodities of all countries alike. Mr. Gladstone called 1860 the last of\r\nthe cardinal and organic years of emancipatory fiscal legislation; it\r\nended a series of which the four earlier terms had been reached in 1842,\r\nin 1845, in 1846, and 1853. With the French treaty, he used to say, the\r\nmovement in favour of free trade reached its zenith.\r\n\r\n(M8) The financial fabric that rose from the treaty was one of the boldest\r\nof all his achievements, and the reader who seeks to take the measure of\r\nMr. Gladstone as financier, in comparison with any of his contemporaries\r\nin the western world, will find in this fabric ample material.(16) Various\r\ncircumstances had led to an immense increase in national expenditure. The\r\nstructure of warships was revolutionised by the use of iron in place of\r\nwood. It was a remarkable era in artillery, and guns were urgently\r\ndemanded of new type. In the far East a quarrel had broken out with the\r\nChinese. The threats of French officers after the plot of Orsini had bred\r\na sense of insecurity in our own borders. Thus more money than ever was\r\nrequired; more than ever economy was both unpopular and difficult. The\r\nannual estimates stood at seventy millions; when Mr. Gladstone framed his\r\nfamous budget seven years before, that charge stood at fifty-two millions.\r\nIf the sole object of a chancellor of the exchequer be to balance his\r\naccount, Mr. Gladstone might have contented himself with keeping the\r\nincome-tax and duties on tea and sugar as they were, meeting the\r\nremissions needed by the French treaty out of the sum released by the\r\nexpiry of the long annuities. Or he might have reduced tea and sugar to a\r\npeace rate, and raised the income-tax from ninepence to a shilling.\r\nInstead of taking this easy course, Mr. Gladstone after having\r\nrelinquished upwards of a million for the sake of the French treaty, now\r\nfurther relinquished nearly a million more for the sake of releasing 371\r\narticles from duties of customs, and a third million in order to abolish\r\nthe vexatious excise duty upon the manufacture of paper. Nearly one\r\nmillion of all this loss he recouped by the imposition of certain small\r\ncharges and minor taxes, and by one or two ingenious expedients of\r\ncollection and account, and the other two millions he made good out of the\r\nlapsed annuities. Tea and sugar he left as they were, and the income-tax\r\nhe raised from ninepence to tenpence. Severe economists, not quite\r\nunjustly, called these small charges a blot on his escutcheon. Time soon\r\nwiped it off, for in fact they were a failure.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the excise duty upon paper proved to be the chief\r\nstumbling-block, and ultimately it raised more excitement than any other\r\nportion of the scheme. The fiscal project became by and by associated with\r\na constitutional struggle between Lords and Commons. In the Commons the\r\nmajority in favour of abolishing the duty sank from fifty-three to nine;\r\ntroubles with China caused a demand for new expenditure; the yield from\r\nthe paper duty was wanted; and the Lords finding in all this a plausible\r\nstarting-point for a stroke of party business, or for the assertion of the\r\nprinciple that to reject a repealing money bill was not the same thing as\r\nto meddle with a bill putting on a tax, threw it out. Then when the Lords\r\nhad rejected the bill, many who had been entirely cool about taking off\r\nthe ’taxes upon knowledge’—for this unfavourable name was given to the\r\npaper duty by its foes—rose to exasperation at the thought of the peers\r\nmeddling with votes of money. All this we shall see as we proceed.\r\n\r\nThis was the broad outline of an operation that completed the great\r\nprocess of reducing articles liable to customs duties from 1052, as they\r\nstood in 1842 when Peel opened the attack upon them; from 466 as Mr.\r\nGladstone found them in 1853; and from 419 as he found them now, down to\r\n48, at which he now left them.(17) Simplification had little further to\r\ngo. “Why did you not wait,” he was asked, “till the surplus came, which\r\nnotwithstanding all drawbacks you got in 1863, and then operate in a quiet\r\nway, without disturbing anybody?”(18) His answer was that the surplus\r\nwould not have come at all, because it was created by his legislation.\r\n“The principle adopted,” he said, “was this. We are now (1860) on a high\r\ntable-land of expenditure. This being so, it is not as if we were merely\r\nmeeting an occasional and momentary charge. We must consider how best to\r\nkeep ourselves going during a _period_ of high charge. In order to do\r\nthat, we will aggravate a momentary deficiency that we may thereby make a\r\n_great and permanent addition to productive power_.” This was his\r\nceaseless refrain—the steadfast pursuit of the durable enlargement of\r\nproductive power as the commanding aim of high finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year the public expectation was fixed upon Lord\r\nJohn Russell as the protagonist in the approaching battle of parliamentary\r\nreform, and the eager partizans at the Carlton Club were confident that on\r\nreform they would pull down the ministry. The partizans of another sort\r\nassure us that “the whole character of the session was changed by Mr.\r\nGladstone’s invincible resolution to come forward in spite of his friends,\r\nand in defiance of his foes, for his own _aristeia_ or innings.” The\r\nexplanation is not good-natured, and we know that it is not true; but what\r\nis true is that when February opened, the interest of the country had\r\nbecome centred at its highest pitch in the budget and the commercial\r\ntreaty. As the day for lifting the veil was close at hand, Mr. Gladstone\r\nfell ill, and here again political benevolence surmised that his disorder\r\nwas diplomatic. An entry or two from Phillimore’s journal will bring him\r\nbefore us as he was:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 29._—Gladstone’s emaciation in the past fortnight alarms me,\r\n    as it has, I find, many other persons. _Feb. 5._—Gladstone\r\n    seriously ill; all the afternoon in Downing Street; a slight\r\n    congestion of the lungs. Great treaty and financial speech put off\r\n    till Thursday. Was to have been to-morrow. Gladstone wished to see\r\n    me, but I would only stay a minute by his bedside. He looked very\r\n    pale. He must not speak for ten days, or Ferguson (his doctor)\r\n    said, he will meet Canning’s fate. _Feb. 6._—With Gladstone in the\r\n    evening. He is still in bed, but visibly better. _Feb. 7._—With\r\n    Gladstone a long time in the morning. Found him much better though\r\n    still in bed. Annoyed at the publication of the new treaty with\r\n    France in the Belgian papers, it being part of the scheme of his\r\n    finance measure. _Feb. 8._—Gladstone drove out to-day; bent on\r\n    speaking the day after to-morrow. Ferguson allows him. I again\r\n    protested. _Feb. 9._—Saw Gladstone; he is better. But I am\r\n    frightened at the proposed exertion of Friday. _Feb. 10._—Saw\r\n    Gladstone in the morning, radiant with expected success, and again\r\n    at night at 10 o’clock in Downing Street still more radiant with\r\n    triumph. Spoke for three hours and fifty minutes without\r\n    suffering. Thinks that the House will accept all that is material\r\n    in his finance scheme. _Feb. 13._—Dined with Gladstone; ordered\r\n    not to leave the house this week. _Feb. 25._—Called on the\r\n    Gladstones at breakfast time. Found them both exceedingly happy at\r\n    the immense majority of 116 which affirmed last night the\r\n    principle of his grand budget.(19) His hard dry cough distresses\r\n    me. Gladstone thinks he has done what Pitt would have done but for\r\n    the French Revolution. With characteristic modesty he said, “I am\r\n    a dwarf on the shoulders of a giant.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone’s own entries are these:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 10, ’60._—Spoke 5-9 without great exhaustion; aided by a\r\n    great stock of egg and wine. Thank God! Home at 11. This was the\r\n    most arduous operation I have ever had in parliament. _March\r\n    9._—Spoke on various matters in the Treaty debate; voted in\r\n    282:56; a most prosperous ending to a great transaction in which I\r\n    heartily thank God for having given me a share. _March 23._—A long\r\n    day of 16-½ hours’ work.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the speech in which the budget was presented everybody agreed that it\r\nwas one of the most extraordinary triumphs ever witnessed in the House of\r\nCommons. The casual delay of a week had raised expectation still higher;\r\nhints dropped by friends in the secret had added to the general\r\nexcitement; and as was truly said by contemporaries, suspense that would\r\nhave been fatal to mediocrity actually served Mr. Gladstone. Even the\r\ncensorious critics of the leading journal found in the largeness and\r\nvariety of the scheme its greatest recommendation, as suggesting an accord\r\nbetween the occasion, the man, and the measure, so marvellous that it\r\nwould be a waste of all three not to accept them. Among other hearers was\r\nLord Brougham, who for the first time since he had quitted the scene of\r\nhis triumphs a generation before, came to the House of Commons, and for\r\nfour hours listened intently to the orator who had now acquired the\r\nsupremacy that was once his own. “The speech,” said Bulwer, “will remain\r\namong the monuments of English eloquence as long as the language lasts.”\r\nNapoleon begged Lord Cowley to convey his thanks to Mr. Gladstone for the\r\ncopy of his budget speech he had sent him, which he said he would preserve\r\n“as a precious souvenir of a man who has my thorough esteem, and whose\r\neloquence is of a lofty character commensurate with the grandeur of his\r\nviews.” Prince Albert wrote to Stockmar (March 17), “Gladstone is now the\r\nreal leader of the House, and works with an energy and vigour almost\r\nincredible.”(20)\r\n\r\nAlmost every section of the trading and political community looked with\r\nfavour upon the budget as a whole, though it was true that each section\r\ntouched by it found fault with its own part. Mr. Gladstone said that they\r\nwere without exception free traders, but not free traders without\r\nexception. The magnitude and comprehensiveness of the enterprise seized\r\nthe imagination of the country. At the same time it multiplied sullen or\r\nuneasy interests. The scheme was no sooner launched, than the chancellor\r\nof the exchequer was overwhelmed by deputations. Within a couple of days\r\nhe was besieged by delegates from the paper makers; distillers came down\r\nupon him; merchants interested in the bonding system, wholesale\r\nstationers, linen manufacturers, maltsters, licensed victuallers, all in\r\nturn thronged his ante-room. He was now, says Greville (Feb. 15), “_the_\r\ngreat man of the day!” The reduction of duties on currants created lively\r\nexcitement in Greece, and Mr. Gladstone was told that if he were to appear\r\nthere he could divide honours with Bacchus and Triptolemus, the latest\r\nbenefactors of that neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n(M9) Political onlookers with whom the wish was not alien to their\r\nthought, soon perceived that in spite of admiration for splendid eloquence\r\nand incomparable dexterity, it would not be all sunshine and plain\r\nsailing. At a very early moment the great editor of the _Times_ went about\r\nsaying that Gladstone would find it hard work to get his budget through;\r\nif Peel with a majority of ninety needed it all to carry his budget, what\r\nwould happen to a government that could but command a majority of\r\nnine?(21) Both the commercial treaty and the finance speedily proved to\r\nhave many enemies. Before the end of March Phillimore met a parliamentary\r\nfriend who like everybody else talked of Gladstone, and confirmed the\r\napprehension that the whigs obeyed and trembled and were frightened to\r\ndeath. “We don’t know where he is leading us,” said Hayter, who had been\r\nwhipper-in. On the last day of the month Phillimore enters: “_March\r\n30._—Gladstone has taken his name off the Carlton, which I regret. It is a\r\nmarked and significant act of entire separation from the _whole_ party and\r\nwill strengthen Disraeli’s hands. The whigs hate Gladstone. The moderate\r\nconservatives and the radicals incline to him. The old tories hate him.”\r\nFor reasons not easy to trace, a general atmosphere of doubt and\r\nunpopularity seemed suddenly to surround his name.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of the budget have been succinctly described by its author:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    They were chequered, and they were peculiar in this, that the\r\n    first blow struck was delivered by one of the best among its\r\n    friends. Lord John Russell, keenly alive to the discredit of any\r\n    tampering as in former years with the question of the franchise,\r\n    insisted on introducing his Reform bill on March 1, when the\r\n    treaty and the financial proposals of the year, numerous and\r\n    complex as they were, had not proceeded beyond their early stages.\r\n    This was in flat violation of a rule of Lord Bacon’s, even more\r\n    weighty now than in his time, which Sir James Graham was fond of\r\n    quoting: “Never overlap business.” The enemies of the treaty were\r\n    thus invited to obstruct it through prolonged debating on reform,\r\n    and the enemies of reform to discharge a corresponding office by\r\n    prolonged debating on the finance. A large majority of the House\r\n    were in disguised hostility to the extension of the franchise. The\r\n    discussions on it were at once protracted, intermittent, and\r\n    languid. No division was taken against it. It was defeated by the\r\n    pure _vis inertiæ_ of the House skilfully applied: and it was\r\n    withdrawn on June 11. But it had done its work, by delaying the\r\n    _tail_ of the financial measures until a time when the marriage\r\n    effected by the treaty between England and France had outlived its\r\n    parliamentary honeymoon. There had intervened the Savoy and Nice\r\n    explosion; settlement with China was uncertain; the prospects of\r\n    the harvest were bad; French invasion was apprehended by many men\r\n    usually rational. The Paper Duty bill, which would have passed the\r\n    Commons by a large majority in the beginning of March, only\r\n    escaped defeat on May 8 by a majority of nine.(22)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Lord John had asked the cabinet to stop the budget in order to fix a\r\nday for his second reading, Mr. Gladstone enters in an autobiographic\r\nmemorandum of his latest years(23):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I said to him, “Lord John, I will go down on my knees to you, to\r\n    entreat you not to press that request.” But he persevered; and\r\n    this although he was both a loyal colleague and a sincere friend\r\n    to the budget and to the French treaty. When reform was at last\r\n    got rid of, in order to prosecute finance we had much to do, and\r\n    in the midst of it there came upon us the news of hostilities in\r\n    China, which demanded at once an increase of outlay ... sufficient\r\n    to destroy my accruing balance, and thus to disorganise the\r\n    finance of the year. The opposition to the Paper bill now assumed\r\n    most formidable dimensions.... During a long course of years there\r\n    had grown up in the House of Commons a practice of finally\r\n    disposing of the several parts of the budget each by itself. And\r\n    the House of Lords had shown so much self-control in confining\r\n    itself to criticism on matters of finance, that the freedom of the\r\n    House of Commons was in no degree impaired. But there was the\r\n    opportunity of mischief; and round the carcass the vultures now\r\n    gathered in overwhelming force. It at once became clear that the\r\n    Lords would avail themselves of the opportunity afforded them by\r\n    the single presentation of financial bills, and would prolong, and\r\n    virtually re-enact a tax, which the representatives of the people\r\n    had repealed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 5 the diary reports: “Cabinet. Lord Palmerston spoke 3/4 hour\r\nagainst Paper Duties bill! I had to reply. Cabinet against him, except a\r\nfew, Wood and Cardwell in particular. Three wild schemes of foreign\r\nalliance are afloat! Our old men (2) are unhappily our youngest.”\r\nPalmerston not only spoke against the bill, as he had a right in cabinet\r\nto do, but actually wrote to the Queen that he was bound in duty to say\r\nthat if the Lords threw out the bill—the bill of his own cabinet—“they\r\nwould perform a good public service.”(24)\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nPhillimore’s notes show that the intense strain was telling on his hero’s\r\nphysical condition, though it only worked his resolution to a more\r\nundaunted pitch:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _May 9._—Found Gladstone in good spirits in spite of the narrow\r\n    majority on the paper duty last night, but ill with a cough. _May\r\n    15._—The whigs out of office, and perhaps in, abusing Gladstone\r\n    and lauding G. Lewis. I had much conversation with Walpole. Told\r\n    me he, Henley, and those who went with them would have followed\r\n    Gladstone if he had not joined this government, but added he was\r\n    justified in doing so. _May 18._—Gladstone is _ill_; vexed and\r\n    _indignant_ at the possible and probable conduct of the peers on\r\n    Monday. Nothing will prevent him from denouncing them in the\r\n    Commons, if they throw out the paper bill, as having violated in\r\n    substance and practically the constitution. Meanwhile his\r\n    unpopularity flows on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rejection of the bill affecting the paper duty by the Lords was\r\nfollowed by proceedings set out by Mr. Gladstone in one of his political\r\nmemoranda, dated May 26, 1860:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Though I seldom have time to note the hairbreadth ’scapes of which\r\n    so many occur in these strange times and with our strangely\r\n    constructed cabinet, yet I must put down a few words with respect\r\n    to the great question now depending between the Lords and the\r\n    English nation. On Sunday, when it was well known that the Paper\r\n    Duties bill would be rejected, I received from Lord John Russell a\r\n    letter which enclosed one to him from Lord Palmerston. Lord\r\n    Palmerston’s came in sum to this: that the vote of the Lords would\r\n    not be a party vote, that as to the _thing done_ it was right,\r\n    that we could not help ourselves, that we should simply acquiesce,\r\n    and no minister ought to resign. Lord John in his reply to this,\r\n    stated that he took a much more serious view of the question and\r\n    gave reasons. Then he went on to say that though he did not agree\r\n    in the grounds stated by Lord Palmerston, he would endeavour to\r\n    arrive at the same conclusion. His letter accordingly ended with\r\n    practical acquiescence. And he stated to me his concurrence in\r\n    Lord Palmerston’s closing proposition.\r\n\r\n    Thereupon I wrote an immediate reply. We met in cabinet to\r\n    consider the case. Lord Palmerston started on the line he had\r\n    marked out. I think he proposed to use some meaningless words in\r\n    the House of Commons as to the value we set on our privileges, and\r\n    our determination to defend them if attacked, by way of garniture\r\n    to the act of their abandonment. Upon this I stated my opinions,\r\n    coming to the point that this proceeding of the House of Lords\r\n    amounted to the establishment of a revising power over the House\r\n    of Commons in its most vital function long declared exclusively\r\n    its own, and to a divided responsibility in fixing the revenue and\r\n    charge of the country for the year; besides aggravating\r\n    circumstances upon which it was needless to dwell. In this\r\n    proceeding nothing would induce me to acquiesce, though I\r\n    earnestly desired that the mildest means of correction should be\r\n    adopted. This was strongly backed in principle by Lord John; who\r\n    thought that as public affairs would not admit of our at once\r\n    confining ourselves to this subject, we should take it up the\r\n    first thing next session, and send up a new bill. Practical, as\r\n    well as other, objections were taken to this mode of proceeding,\r\n    and opposition was continued on the merits; Lord Palmerston keen\r\n    and persevering. He was supported by the Chancellor, Wood,\r\n    Granville (in substance), Lewis, and Cardwell, who thought nothing\r\n    could be done, but were ready to join in resigning if thought fit.\r\n    Lord John, Gibson, and I were for decided action. Argyll leaned\r\n    the same way. Newcastle was for inquiry to end in a declaratory\r\n    resolution. Villiers thought some step necessary. Grey argued\r\n    mildly, inclined I think to inaction. Herbert advised resignation,\r\n    opposed any other course. Somerset was silent, which I conceive\r\n    meant inaction. At last Palmerston gave in, and adopted with but\r\n    middling grace the proposition to set out with inquiries, and with\r\n    the intention to make as little of the matter as he could.\r\n\r\n    His language in giving notice, on Tuesday, of the committee went\r\n    near the verge of saying, We mean nothing. An unsatisfactory\r\n    impression was left on the House. Not a syllable was said in\r\n    recognition of the gravity of the occasion. Lord John had\r\n    unfortunately gone away to the foreign office. I thought I should\r\n    do mischief at that stage by appearing to catch at a part in the\r\n    transaction. Yesterday all was changed by the dignified\r\n    declaration of Lord John. I suggested to him that he should get\r\n    up, and Lord Palmerston, who had intended to keep the matter in\r\n    his own hands, gave way. But Lord Palmerston was uneasy and said,\r\n    “You won’t pitch it into the Lords,” and other things of the same\r\n    kind. On the whole, I hope that in this grave matter at least we\r\n    have turned the corner.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we know, even the fighting party in the cabinet was forced to content\r\nitself for the moment with three protesting resolutions. Lord Palmerston\r\nand his chancellor of the exchequer both spoke in parliament. “The tone of\r\nthe two remonstrances,” says Mr. Gladstone euphemistically, “could not be\r\nin exact accord; but by careful steering on my part, and I presume on his,\r\nall occasion of scandal was avoided.” Not altogether, perhaps. Phillimore\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 6._—A strange and memorable debate. Palmerston moving\r\n    resolution condemnatory of the Lords, and yet speaking in defence\r\n    of their conduct. Gladstone most earnestly and eloquently\r\n    condemning them, and declaring that action and not resolutions\r\n    became the House of Commons, and that though he agreed to the\r\n    language and spirit of the resolutions, if action were proposed he\r\n    would support the proposal, and taunted the conservatives with\r\n    silently abetting “a gigantic innovation on the constitution.”\r\n    Loudly and tempestuously cheered by the radicals, and no one else.\r\n    Yet he was the true conservative at this moment. But ought he to\r\n    have spoken this as chancellor of the exchequer, and from the\r\n    treasury bench, after the first lord of the treasury had spoken in\r\n    almost totally opposite sense? The answer may be that it was a\r\n    House of Commons, and not a government question. I fear he is very\r\n    unwell, and I greatly fear killing himself. 17.—“I have lived,” he\r\n    said, speaking of the debate on the Lords and the paper duty, “to\r\n    hear a radical read a long passage from Mr. Burke amid the jeers\r\n    and scoffs of the so-called conservatives.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe struggle still went on:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 20._—H. of C. Lost my Savings Bank Monies bill; my _first_\r\n    defeat in a measure of finance in the H. of C. This ought to be\r\n    very good for me; and I earnestly wish to make it so.\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 6._—H. of C. Spoke 1-½ hour on the Paper duty; a favourable\r\n    House. Voted in 266-233. A most kind and indeed notable reception\r\n    afterwards.\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 7._—This was a day of congratulations from many kind M.P.’s.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe occasion of the notable reception was the moving of his resolutions\r\nreducing the customs duty on imported paper to the level of the excise\r\nduty. This proceeding was made necessary by the treaty, and was taken to\r\nbe, as Mr. Gladstone intended that it should be, a clear indication of\r\nfurther determination to abolish customs duty and excise duty alike. The\r\nfirst resolution was carried by 33, and when he rose to move the second\r\nthe cheering from the liberal benches kept him standing for four or five\r\nminutes—cheering intended to be heard the whole length of the corridor\r\nthat led to another place.(25)\r\n\r\n(M10) The great result, as Greville says in a sentence that always amused\r\nthe chief person concerned, is “to give some life to half-dead,\r\nbroken-down, and tempest-tossed Gladstone.” In this rather tame fashion\r\nthe battle ended for the session, but the blaze in the bosom of the\r\nchancellor of the exchequer was inextinguishable, as the Lords in good\r\ntime found out. Their rejection of the Paper Duties bill must have had no\r\ninconsiderable share in propelling him along the paths of liberalism. The\r\nsame proceeding helped to make him more than ever the centre of popular\r\nhopes. He had taken the unpopular side in resisting the inquiry into the\r\nmiscarriages of the Crimea, in pressing peace with Russia, in opposing the\r\npanic on papal aggression, on the bill for divorce, and on the bill\r\nagainst church rates; and he represented with fidelity the constituency\r\nthat was least of all in England in accord with the prepossessions of\r\ndemocracy. Yet this made no difference when the time came to seek a\r\nleader. “There is not,” Mr. Bright said, in the course of this quarrel\r\nwith the Lords, “a man who labours and sweats for his daily bread, there\r\nis not a woman living in a cottage who strives to make her home happy for\r\nhusband and children, to whom the words of the chancellor of the exchequer\r\nhave not brought hope, and to whom his measures, which have been defended\r\nwith an eloquence few can equal and with a logic none can contest, have\r\nnot administered consolation.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of the session Phillimore reports:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 12._—Gladstone is physically weak, requires rest, air, and\r\n    generous living. He discoursed without the smallest reserve upon\r\n    political affairs, the feebleness of the government, mainly\r\n    attributable to the absence of any effective head; Palmerston’s\r\n    weakness in the cabinet, and his low standard for all public\r\n    conduct. He said in Peel’s cabinet, a cabinet minister if he had a\r\n    measure to bring forward consulted Peel and then the cabinet.\r\n    Nobody thought of consulting Palmerston first, but brought his\r\n    measure at once to the cabinet. Gladstone said his work in the\r\n    cabinet had been so constant and severe that his work in the House\r\n    of Commons was refreshing by comparison. I never heard him speak\r\n    so strongly of the timidity and vacillation of his comrades. The\r\n    last victory, which alone preserved the government from dropping\r\n    to pieces, was won in spite of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a contemporary memorandum (May 30, 1860) on the opinions of the cabinet\r\nat this date Mr. Gladstone sets out the principal trains of business with\r\nwhich he and his colleagues were called upon to deal. It is a lively\r\npicture of the vast and diverse interests of a minister disposed to take\r\nhis cabinet duties seriously. It is, too, a curious chart of the currents\r\nand cross-currents of the time. Here are the seven heads as he sets them\r\ndown:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    (1) The Italian question—Austrian or anti-Austrian; (2) Foreign\r\n    policy in general—leaning towards calm and peace, or brusqueness\r\n    and war; (3) Defences and expenditure—alarm and money charges on\r\n    the one side, modest and timid retrenchment with confidence in our\r\n    position on the other; (4) Finance, as adapted to the one or the\r\n    other of these groups of ideas and feelings respectively; (5)\r\n    Reform—ultra-conservative on the one side, on the other, no fear\r\n    of the working class and the belief that something _real_ though\r\n    limited, should be done towards their enfranchisement; (6) Church\r\n    matters may perhaps be also mentioned, though there has been no\r\n    collision in regard to them, whatever difference there may be—they\r\n    have indeed held a very secondary place amidst the rude and\r\n    constant shocks of the last twelve months; (7) Lastly, the _coup\r\n    d’état_ on the paper duties draws a new line of division.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M11) “In the many passages of argument and opinion,” Mr. Gladstone adds,\r\n“the only person from whom I have never to my recollection differed on a\r\nserious matter during this anxious twelvemonth is Milner Gibson.” The\r\nreader will find elsewhere the enumeration of the various parts in this\r\ncomplex dramatic piece.(26) Some of the most Italian members of the\r\ncabinet were also the most combative in foreign policy, the most martial\r\nin respect of defence, the most stationary in finance. In the matter of\r\nreform, some who were liberal as to the franchise were conservative as to\r\nredistribution. In matters ecclesiastical, those who like Mr. Gladstone\r\nwere most liberal elsewhere, were (with sympathy from Argyll) “most\r\nconservative and church-like.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    On the paper duties there are, I think, only three members of the\r\n    cabinet who have a strong feeling of the need of a remedy for the\r\n    late aggression—Lord John Russell, Gibson, W. E. G.—and Lord John\r\n    Russell leans so much upon Palmerston in regard to foreign affairs\r\n    that he is weaker in other subjects when opposed to him, than\r\n    might be desired. With us in feeling are, more or less, Newcastle,\r\n    Argyll, Villiers. On the other side, and pretty decidedly—first\r\n    and foremost, Lord Palmerston; after him, the Chancellor,\r\n    Granville, Lewis, Wood, Cardwell, Herbert. It is easy to judge\r\n    what an odd shifting of parts takes place in our discussions. We\r\n    are not Mr. Burke’s famous mosaic, but we are a mosaic in\r\n    solution, that is to say, a kaleidoscope.(27) When the instrument\r\n    turns, the separate pieces readjust themselves, and all come out\r\n    in perfectly novel combinations. Such a cabinet ought not to be\r\n    acephalous.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore he had been a year and a half in office, Mr. Gladstone wrote to\r\nGraham (Nov. 27, ’60): “We live in anti-reforming times. All improvements\r\nhave to be urged in apologetic, almost in supplicatory tones. I sometimes\r\nreflect how much less liberal as to domestic policy in any true sense of\r\nthe word, is this government than was Sir Robert Peel’s; and how much the\r\ntone of ultra-toryism prevails among a large portion of the liberal\r\nparty.” “I speak a literal truth,” he wrote to Cobden, “when I say that in\r\nthese days it is more difficult to save a shilling than to spend a\r\nmillion.” “The men,” he said, “who ought to have been breasting and\r\nstemming the tide have become captains general of the alarmists,” and he\r\ndeplored Cobden’s refusal of office when the Palmerston government was\r\nformed. All this only provoked him to more relentless energy. Well might\r\nPrince Albert call it incredible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the “gigantic innovation” perpetrated by the Lords, Mr. Gladstone\r\nread to the cabinet (June 30, 1860) an elaborate memorandum on the paper\r\nduty and the taxing powers of the two Houses. He dealt fully alike with\r\nthe fiscal and the constitutional aspects of a situation from which he was\r\n“certain that nothing could extricate them with credit, except the united,\r\ndetermined, and even authoritative action of the government.” He wound up\r\nwith a broad declaration that, to any who knew his tenacity of purpose\r\nwhen once roused, made it certain that he would never acquiesce in the\r\npretensions of the other House. The fiscal consideration, he concluded,\r\n“is nothing compared with the vital importance of maintaining the\r\nexclusive rights of the House of Commons in matter of supply. There is\r\nhardly any conceivable interference of the Lords hereafter, except sending\r\ndown a tax imposed by themselves, which would not be covered by this\r\nprecedent. It may be said they are wise and will not do it. Assuming that\r\nthey will be wise, yet I for one am not willing that the House of Commons\r\nshould hold on sufferance in the nineteenth century what it won in the\r\nseventeenth and confirmed and enlarged in the eighteenth.”\r\n\r\nThe intervening months did not relax this valiant and patriotic\r\nresolution. He wrote down a short version of the story in the last year of\r\nhis life:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The hostilities in China reached a rather early termination, and\r\n    in the early part of the session of 1861 it appeared almost\r\n    certain that there would be a surplus for 1861-2 such as I thought\r\n    would make it possible again to operate on the paper duties.\r\n    Unfortunately, the income tax was at so high a rate that we could\r\n    not reasonably hope to carry paper duty repeal without taking a\r\n    penny off the tax. The double plan strained the probable means\r\n    afforded by the budget. In this dilemma I received most valuable\r\n    aid from the shrewd ingenuity of Milner Gibson, who said: Why not\r\n    fix the repeal of the paper duty at a later date than had been\r\n    intended, say on the 10th of October, which will reduce the loss\r\n    for the year? I gladly adopted the proposition, and proposed a\r\n    budget reducing the income tax by one penny, and repealing the\r\n    paper duties from October 10, 1861. With this was combined what\r\n    was more essential than either—the adoption of a new practice with\r\n    respect to finance, which would combine all the financial measures\r\n    of the year in a single bill. We had separate discussions in the\r\n    cabinet on the constitutional proposal [the single bill]. It was\r\n    not extensively resisted there, though quietly a good deal\r\n    misliked. I rather think the chancellor, Campbell, took strong\r\n    objection to it; and I well remember that the Duke of Newcastle\r\n    gave valuable and telling aid. So it was adopted. The budget was\r\n    the subject of a fierce discussion, in which Lord Palmerston\r\n    appeared to me to lose his temper for the first and only time. The\r\n    plan, however, to my great delight, was adopted. It was followed\r\n    by a strange and painful incident. I received with astonishment\r\n    from Lord Palmerston, immediately after the adoption of the\r\n    budget, a distinct notice that he should not consider it a cabinet\r\n    question in the House of Commons, where it was known that the\r\n    opposition and the paper makers would use every effort to destroy\r\n    the plan. I wrote an uncontroversial reply (with some\r\n    self-repression) and showed it to Granville, who warmly approved,\r\n    and was silent on the letter of Lord Palmerston. The battle in\r\n    parliament was hard, but was as nothing to the internal fighting;\r\n    and we won it. We likewise succeeded in the plan of uniting the\r\n    financial proposals in one bill. To this Spencer Walpole gave\r\n    honourable support; and it became a standing rule. The House of\r\n    Lords, for its misconduct, was deservedly extinguished, in effect,\r\n    as to all matters of finance.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the “internal fighting” we have a glimpse in the diary:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 10, ’61._—Saw Lord Palmerston and explained to him my\r\n    plans, which did not meet his views. A laborious and anxious day.\r\n    11.—Cabinet. Explained my case 1-3. Chaos! 12.—Cabinet 1-3. Very\r\n    stiff. We ’broke up’ in one sense and all but in another.\r\n    13.—Cabinet 3-3/4-6. My plan as now framed was accepted, Lord\r\n    Palmerston yielding gracefully; Stanley of Alderley almost the\r\n    only kicker. The plan of one bill was accepted after fighting.\r\n    15.—H. of C., financial statement for three hours. The figures\r\n    rather made my head ache. It was the discharge of a long pent-up\r\n    excitement. _May 13._—Lord J.R. again sustained me most handsomely\r\n    in debate. Lord P. after hearing Graham amended his speech, but\r\n    said we must not use any words tending to make this a vote of\r\n    confidence. 30.—H. of C. Spoke one hour on omission of clause IV.\r\n    [that repealing the paper duty], and voted in 296-281. One of the\r\n    greatest nights in the whole of my recollection. _June\r\n    1._—Yesterday was a day of subsiding excitement. To-day is the\r\n    same. Habit enables me to expel exciting thought, but not the\r\n    subtler nervous action which ever comes with a crisis. 7.—To-day’s\r\n    debate in the H. of L. was a great event for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe abiding feature of constitutional interest in the budget of 1861 was\r\nthis inclusion of the various financial proposals in a single bill, so\r\nthat the Lords must either accept the whole of them, or try the impossible\r\nperformance of rejecting the whole of them. This was the affirmation in\r\npractical shape of the resolution of the House of Commons in the previous\r\nyear, that it possessed in its own hands the power to remit and impose\r\ntaxes, and that the right to frame bills of supply in its own measure,\r\nmanner, time, and matter, is a right to be kept inviolable. Until now the\r\npractice had been to make the different taxes the subject of as many\r\ndifferent bills, thus placing it in the power of the Lords to reject a\r\ngiven tax bill without throwing the financial machinery wholly out of\r\ngear. By including all the taxes in a single finance bill the power of the\r\nLords to override the other House was effectually arrested.\r\n\r\n(M12) In language of that time, he had carried every stitch of free-trade\r\ncanvas in the teeth of a tempest that might have made the boldest\r\nfinancial pilot shorten sail. Many even of his friends were sorry that he\r\ndid not reduce the war duty on tea and sugar, instead of releasing paper\r\nfrom its duty of excise. Neither friends nor foes daunted him. He\r\npossessed his soul in patience until the hour struck, and then came forth\r\nin full panoply. Enthusiastic journalists with the gift of a poetic pen\r\ntold their millions of readers how, after weeks of malign prophecy, that\r\nthe great trickster in Downing Street would be proved to have beggared the\r\nexchequer, that years of gloom and insolvency awaited us, suddenly, the\r\nmoment the magician chose to draw aside the veil, the darkness rolled\r\naway; he had fluttered out of sight the whole race of sombre Volscians;\r\nand where the gazers dreaded to see a gulf they beheld a golden monument\r\nof glorious finance; like the traveller in the Arabian fable who was\r\npursued in the Valley of Shadows by unearthly imprecations, he never\r\nglanced to right or left until he could disperse the shadows by a single\r\nstroke. “He is,” says another onlooker, “in his ministerial capacity,\r\nprobably the best abused and the best hated man in the House; nevertheless\r\nthe House is honestly proud of him, and even the country party feels a\r\nglow of pride in exhibiting to the diplomatic gallery such a transcendent\r\nmouthpiece of a nation of shopkeepers. The audacious shrewdness of\r\nLancashire married to the polished grace of Oxford is a felicitous union\r\nof the strength and culture of liberal and conservative England; and no\r\nparty in the House, whatever may be its likings or antipathies, can sit\r\nunder the spell of Mr. Gladstone’s rounded and shining eloquence without a\r\nconviction that the man who can talk ‘shop’ like a tenth Muse is, after\r\nall, a true representative man of the market of the world.”\r\n\r\nIn describing the result of the repeal of the paper duty a little after\r\nthis,(28) he used glowing words. “Never was there a measure so\r\nconservative as that which called into vivid, energetic, permanent, and\r\nsuccessful action the cheap press of this country.” It was also a common\r\nradical opinion of that hour that if the most numerous classes acquired\r\nthe franchise as well as cheap newspapers, the reign of peace would\r\nthenceforth be unbroken. In a people of bold and martial temper such as\r\nare the people of our island, this proved to be a miscalculation.\r\nMeanwhile there is little doubt that Mr. Gladstone’s share in thus\r\nfostering the growth of the cheap press was one of the secrets of his\r\nrapid rise in popularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. Battle For Economy. (1860-1862)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The session of 1860, with its complement in the principal part of\r\n    1861, was, I think, the most trying part of my whole political\r\n    life.—GLADSTONE (1897).\r\n\r\n    In reading history, we are almost tempted to believe that the\r\n    chief end of government in promoting internal quiet has been to\r\n    accumulate greater resources for foreign hostilities.—CHANNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this time the battle for thrifty husbandry went on, and the bark of\r\nthe watch-dog at the exchequer sounded a hoarse refrain. “We need not\r\nmaunder in ante-chambers,” as Mr. Disraeli put it, “to discover\r\ndifferences in the cabinet, when we have a patriotic prime minister\r\nappealing to the spirit of the country; and when at the same time we find\r\nhis chancellor of the exchequer, whose duty it is to supply the ways and\r\nmeans by which those exertions are to be supported, proposing votes with\r\ninnuendo, and recommending expenditure in a whispered invective.”\r\n\r\n(M13) Severer than any battle in parliament is a long struggle inside a\r\ncabinet. Opponents contend at closer quarters, the weapons are shorter, it\r\nis easier to make mischief. Mr. Gladstone was the least quarrelsome of the\r\nhuman race; he was no wrestler intent only on being a winner in Olympic\r\ngames; nor was he one of those who need an adversary to bring out all\r\ntheir strength. But in a cause that he had at heart he was untiring,\r\nunfaltering, and indomitable. Parallel with his contention about budget\r\nand treaty in 1860 was persistent contention for economy. The financial\r\ncrisis went on with the fortifications crisis. The battle was incessant.\r\nHe had not been many months in office before those deep differences came\r\nprominently forward in temperament, tradition, views of national policy,\r\nthat continued to make themselves felt between himself and Lord Palmerston\r\nso long as the government endured. Perhaps I should put it more widely,\r\nand say between himself and that vast body of excited opinion in the\r\ncountry, of which Lord Palmerston was the cheerful mouthpiece. The\r\nstruggle soon began.\r\n\r\nSidney Herbert, then at the war office, after circulating a memorandum,\r\nwrote privately to Mr. Gladstone (Nov. 23, 1859), that he was convinced\r\nthat a great calamity was impending in the shape of a war provoked by\r\nFrance. Officers who had visited that country told him that all thinking\r\nmen in France were against war with England, all noisy men for it, the\r\narmy for it, and above all, the government for it. Inspired pamphlets were\r\nscattered broadcast. Everything was determined except time and occasion.\r\nThe general expectation was for next summer. French tradesmen at St. Malo\r\nwere sending in their bills to the English, thinking war coming. “We have\r\nto do with a godless people who look on war as a game open to all without\r\nresponsibility or sin; and there is a man at the head of them who combines\r\nthe qualities of a gambler and a fatalist.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone replied in two letters, one of them (Nov. 27) of the stamp\r\nusual from a chancellor of the exchequer criticising a swollen estimate,\r\nwith controversial doubts, pungent interrogatories, caustic asides, hints\r\nfor saving here and paring there. On the following day he fired what he\r\ncalled his second barrel, in the shape of a letter, which states with\r\nadmirable force and fulness the sceptic’s case against the scare. This\r\ntime it was no ordinary exchequer wrestle. He combats the inference of an\r\nEnglish from an Italian war, by the historic reminder that a struggle\r\nbetween France and Austria for supremacy or influence in Italy had been\r\ngoing on for four whole centuries, so that its renewal was nothing\r\nstrange. If France, now unable to secure our co-operation, still thought\r\nthe Italian danger grave enough to warrant single-handed intervention, how\r\ndoes that support the inference that she must certainly be ready to invade\r\nEngland next? He ridicules the conclusion that the invasion was at our\r\ndoors, from such contested allegations as that the Châlons farmers refused\r\nthe loan of horses from the government, because they would soon be wanted\r\nback again for the approaching war with England. What extraordinary\r\nfarmers to refuse the loan of horses for their ploughing and seed time,\r\nbecause they might be reclaimed for purposes of war before winter! Then\r\nwhy could we not see a single copy of the incendiary and anti-English\r\npamphlets, said to be disseminated broadcast among the troops? What was\r\nthe value of all this contested and unsifted statement? Why, if he were\r\nbent on a rupture, did the Emperor not stir at the moment of the great\r\nMutiny, when every available man we had was sent to India, and when he had\r\nwhat might have passed for a plausible excuse in the Orsini conspiracy,\r\nand in the deliberate and pointed refusal of parliament to deal with it?\r\nWith emphasis, he insists that we have no adequate idea of the\r\npredisposing power which an immense series of measures of preparation for\r\nwar on our own part, have in actually begetting war. They familiarise\r\nideas which when familiar lose their horror, and they light an inward\r\nflame of excitement of which, when it is habitually fed, we lose the\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThis application of cool and reasoned common sense to actual probabilities\r\nseldom avails against imaginations excited by random possibilities; and he\r\nmade little way. Lord Palmerston advanced into the field, in high anxiety\r\nthat the cabinet should promptly adopt Herbert’s proposal.(29) They soon\r\ncame to a smart encounter, and Mr. Gladstone writes to the prime minister\r\n(Feb. 7, 1860): “There are, I fear, the most serious differences among us\r\nwith respect to a loan for fortifications.... My mind is made up, and to\r\npropose any loan for fortifications would be, on my part, with the views I\r\nentertain, a betrayal of my public duty.” A vigorous correspondence\r\nbetween Mr. Gladstone and Herbert upon military charges followed, and the\r\ntension seemed likely to snap the cord.\r\n\r\n(M14) If I may judge from the minutes of the members of the cabinet on the\r\npapers circulated, most of them stood with their chief, and not one of\r\nthem, not even Milner Gibson nor Villiers, was ready to proceed onward\r\nfrom a sort of general leaning towards Mr. Gladstone’s view to the further\r\nstage of making a strong stand-up fight for it. The controversy between\r\nhim and his colleagues still raged at red heat over the whole ground of\r\nmilitary estimates, the handling of the militia, and the construction of\r\nfortifications. He wrote memorandum upon memorandum with untiring energy,\r\npressing the cabinet with the enormous rate in the increase of charge;\r\nwith the slight grounds on which increase of charge was now ordinarily\r\nproposed and entertained; and, most of all, with the absence of all\r\nattempt to compensate for new and necessary expenditure by retrenchment in\r\nquarters where the scale of outlay had either always been, or had become\r\nunnecessary. He was too sound a master of the conditions of public\r\nbusiness to pretend to take away from the ministers at the head of the\r\ngreat departments of expenditure their duty of devising plans of\r\nreduction, but he boldly urged the reconsideration of such large general\r\nitems of charge as the military expenditure in the colonies, then standing\r\nat an annual burden of over two millions on the taxpayers of this country.\r\nHe was keen from the lessons of experience, to expose the ever\r\nindestructible fallacy that mighty armaments make for peace.\r\n\r\nStill the cabinet was not moved, and in Palmerston he found a will and\r\npurpose as tenacious as his own. “The interview with Lord Palmerston came\r\noff to-day,” he writes to the Duke of Argyll (June 6, 1860). “Nothing\r\ncould be more kind and frank than his manner. The _matter_ was first to\r\nwarn me of the evils and hazards attending, for me, the operation of\r\nresigning. Secondly, to express his own strong sense of the obligation to\r\npersevere. Both of these I told him I could fully understand. He said he\r\nhad had two great objects always before him in life—one the suppression of\r\nthe slave trade, the other to put England in a state of defence. In short,\r\nit appears that he now sees, as he considers, the opportunity of attaining\r\na long cherished object; and it is not unnatural that he should repel any\r\nproposal which should defraud him of a glory, in and by absolving him from\r\na duty.... I am now sure that Lord Palmerston entertained this purpose\r\nwhen he formed the government; but had I been in the slightest degree\r\naware of it, I should certainly, but very reluctantly, have abstained from\r\njoining it, and helped, as I could, from another bench its Italian\r\npurposes. Still, I am far indeed from regretting to have joined it, which\r\nis quite another matter.”\r\n\r\nNow labouring hard in Paris month after month at the tariff, Cobden plied\r\nMr. Gladstone with exhortations to challenge the alarmists on the facts;\r\nto compare the outlay by France for a dozen years past on docks,\r\nfortifications, arsenals, with the corresponding outlay by England; to\r\nshow that our steam navy, building and afloat, to say nothing of our vast\r\nmercantile marine, was at least double the strength of France; and above\r\nall, to make his colleagues consider whether the French Emperor had not,\r\nas a matter of self-interest, made the friendship of England, from the\r\nfirst, the hinge of his whole policy. Cobden, as always, knew thoroughly\r\nand in detail what he was talking about, for he had sat for three\r\nsuccessive sessions on a select committee upon army, navy, and ordnance\r\nexpenditure. In another letter he turned personally to Mr. Gladstone\r\nhimself: “Unconsciously,” he says, “you have administered to the support\r\nof a system which has no better foundation than a gigantic delusion” (June\r\n11, 1860). “You say unconsciously,” Mr. Gladstone replies (June 13), “I am\r\nafraid that in one respect this is too favourable a description. I have\r\nconsciously, as a member of parliament and as a member of the government,\r\nconcurred in measures that provide for an expenditure beyond what were it\r\nin my power I would fix.... But I suppose that the duty of choosing the\r\nlesser evil binds me; _the difficulty is to determine what the lesser evil\r\nis_.”\r\n\r\n(M15) My story grows long, and it ends as such stories in our politics\r\nusually end. A compromise was arranged on the initiative of the Duke of\r\nSomerset, keeping clear, as Mr. Gladstone supposed, of the fortification\r\nscheme as a whole, and not pledging future years.(30) “Never at any time\r\nin my life,” Mr. Gladstone told Graham, “have I had such a sense of mental\r\nand moral exhaustion.” The strain was not ended by the compromise, for in\r\nmoving the resolution for a vote of two millions for fortifications (July\r\n23), Lord Palmerston not only declared that he held it to be absolutely\r\nnecessary to carry the whole scheme into effect—the very proposition which\r\nthe compromise put aside—but defended it by a series of stringent\r\ncriticisms particularly fitted to offend and irritate France. Mr.\r\nGladstone was not present,(31) but he felt strongly that he had good\r\ngrounds of complaint, and that faith had not been strictly kept. “Much\r\ndismayed,” he wrote in his diary (July 24), “at the terms of Lord\r\nPalmerston’s resolution.” It was now, however, too late to draw back.(32)\r\nMr. Bright made a weighty and masterly attack (Aug. 2), hinting plainly\r\nthat the thing was “a compromise to enable the government to avoid the\r\nrock, or get over the quick-sand, which this question has interjected into\r\ntheir midst,” and quoting with excellent effect a pregnant passage from\r\nPeel: “If you adopt the opinion of military men, naturally anxious for the\r\ncomplete security of every available point; naturally anxious to throw\r\nupon you the whole responsibility for the loss in the event of war\r\nsuddenly breaking out of some of our valuable possessions,—you would\r\noverwhelm this country with taxes in time of peace.” But this was a\r\nPalmerstonian parliament. The year before, a remarkable debate (July 21,\r\n1859) had promised better things. Disraeli had opened it with emphatic\r\ndeclarations: “There is no country,” he said, “that can go on raising\r\nseventy millions in time of peace with impunity. England cannot, and if\r\nEngland cannot, no country can.” Bright followed with the assurance that\r\nCobden and he might now consider Mr. Disraeli a convert to their views.\r\nLord John Russell came next, agreeing with Bright; and even Palmerston\r\nhimself was constrained to make a peace speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May 1861 Mr. Gladstone notes “a day of over fourteen hours: thank God\r\nfor the strength.” The atmosphere around him would have depressed a weaker\r\nman. “At Brooks’s,” says Phillimore, “they hate Gladstone worse than at\r\nthe Carlton.” In the summer the strife upon expenditure was renewed.\r\nEventually Mr. Gladstone was able to write to Graham from the cabinet room\r\n(July 20, 1861) that Castor and Pollux appeared aloft at the right moment,\r\nand the clouds had disappeared. In a letter to his close friend, Sir\r\nWalter James, in 1871 Mr. Gladstone says: “The storm of criticism and\r\nrebuke does not surprise nor discourage me. Doubtless much must be just;\r\nand what is not, is what we call in logic an ‘inseparable accident’ of\r\npolitics. Time and reflection will, please God, enable us to distinguish\r\nbetween them. For my own part I _never_ was so abused as in 1860; but it\r\nwas one of the most useful or least useless years of my life.” The battle\r\nwas as severe in 1861 as it had been the year before. In the middle of the\r\nsession (May 9) Phillimore reports: “Found Gladstone in good spirits; he\r\nspoke with real greatness of mind of the attacks made on him.”\r\n\r\n(M16) The next year Lord Palmerston wrote to express his concern at\r\nsomething that he came upon in a railway journey. “I read with much\r\ninterest,” he wrote to his chancellor of the exchequer (April 29, 1862),\r\n“your able and eloquent speeches at Manchester, but I wish to submit to\r\nyou some observations upon the financial part of the second speech.” He\r\ndid not agree with Mr. Gladstone that the nation had forced the cabinet\r\nand parliament into high expenditure, but if it were so, he regarded it\r\nnot as matter of reproach, but as a proof of the nation’s superior\r\nsagacity. Panic there had been none; governors and governed had for a long\r\ntime been blind and apathetic; then they awoke. There was on the other\r\nside of the channel a people who, say what they may, hate us and would\r\nmake any sacrifice to humiliate us, and they had now at their head an\r\nable, active, wary, council-keeping, but ever-planning sovereign [Napoleon\r\nIII.]. “Have the parliament and the nation been wrong, and have Bright and\r\nCobden and yourself been right?” All this being so, he could not but\r\nregret that Mr. Gladstone should by speeches in and out of parliament\r\ninvite agitation to force the government of which he was a member, to\r\nretrace its steps taken deliberately and with full sense of\r\nresponsibility.(33) To Palmerston’s eight quarto pages, written in one of\r\nthe finest hands of the time, Mr. Gladstone replied in twelve.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In all good humour, he said, I prefer not being classed with Mr.\r\n    Bright, or even Mr. Cobden; first, because I do not know their\r\n    opinions with any precision; and secondly, because as far as I do\r\n    know or can grasp them, they seem to contemplate fundamental\r\n    changes in taxation which I disapprove in principle, and believe\r\n    also to be unattainable in practice, and reductions of\r\n    establishment and expenditure for which I am not prepared to be\r\n    responsible.... I think it a mean and guilty course to hold out\r\n    vague and indefinite promises of vast retrenchment, but I think it\r\n    will be a healthful day, both for the country and for the party\r\n    over which you so ably preside, when the word retrenchment, of\r\n    course with a due regard to altered circumstances, shall again\r\n    take its place among their battle cries.\r\n\r\n\r\nA spirited correspondence followed, for Lord Palmerston knew his business,\r\nand had abundant faculty of application; while Mr. Gladstone, for his\r\npart, was too much in earnest to forego rejoinder and even surrejoinder.\r\n“No claptrap reductions,” cried the prime minister. “You are feeding not\r\nonly expenditure,” rejoined the chancellor of the exchequer, “but what is\r\nworse, the spirit of expenditure.” “You disclaim political community of\r\nopinion with Bright and Cobden, and justly,” said Lord Palmerston, “but\r\nyou cannot but be aware that owing to various accidental circumstances\r\nmany people at home and abroad connect you unjustly with them, and this\r\nfalse impression is certainly not advantageous.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Gladstone,” he wrote good-humouredly on another occasion, “You\r\nmay not have seen how your name is taken in vain by people with whom I\r\nconceive you do not sympathise,—Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nPALMERSTON.”\r\n\r\nEnclosed was a placard with many large capital letters, notes of\r\nexclamation, italics, and all the rest of the paraphernalia of political\r\nemphasis:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    TAX PAYERS! Read Mr. Cobden’s new pamphlet, the “THREE PANICS,”\r\n    and judge for yourselves. How long will you suffer Yourselves to\r\n    be Humbugged by PALMERSTONIANISM, and Robbed by the “Services,”\r\n    and others interested in a War Expenditure, even in times of\r\n    Peace? ... THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER APPEALS TO YOU TO HELP\r\n    HIM. You have the power in your own hands if you will only exert\r\n    it. Reform the House of Commons, AND DO IT THOROUGHLY THIS TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the continuance of the struggle in 1862, a few items from the diary\r\ngive an adequate picture:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 30, 1862._—A heavy blow in the announcement of increased\r\n    military estimates from Sir George Lewis gave me a disturbed\r\n    evening. 31.—Worked on the formidable subject of the estimates,\r\n    and made known to the cabinet my difficulties. _Feb. 1._—Cabinet\r\n    3-½—6. It went well; the tenth penny [on the income-tax] proved to\r\n    be a strong physic; £750,000 of reductions ordered. 12.—Wrote mem.\r\n    on possible reductions, etc., to dispense with income-tax. The\r\n    whole question, I think, is, can we be satisfied (I think we ought\r\n    and will) with 21 millions for army and navy instead of 27? _March\r\n    1._—Cabinet 3-3/4—6-1/4, very stiff, on the Belgian negotiations I\r\n    had to go to the ultima ratio. 31.—H. of C. The fortifications got\r\n    their first blow.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy midsummer public feeling veered a little: “The tide has turned. Lord\r\nPalmerston is now ‘the strong swimmer in his agony.’ ”(34)\r\n\r\nA candid and friendly observer has told us the situation: “When I was\r\nprivate secretary to Lord Palmerston,” he says, “and Mr. Gladstone was his\r\nchancellor of the exchequer, it was a constant source of sorrow to me, and\r\na perpetual cause of mystery, to note how they misunderstood one another,\r\nand how evidently each mistrusted the other, though perfectly cordial and\r\nmost friendly in their mutual intercourse.... If the proposal was adhered\r\nto, Mr. Gladstone gave way. This seemed to Lord Palmerston a case of\r\ngratuitous difficulties put in his way, and attempts to thwart without the\r\ncourage to resist.”(35)\r\n\r\nIn closing this chapter, let us note that in spite of Lord Palmerston, he\r\nwon no inconsiderable success. When 1866 came, and his financial\r\nadministration ended, he had managed, with the aid of the reduction of\r\ndebt charge after the lapse of the long annuities, to carry expenditure\r\nback to the level of 1857. Naval expenditure rose until 1861, and then\r\nbegan to fall; army expenditure rose until 1863, and then began to fall.\r\nIn 1859, when he went to the exchequer, the total under these two heads\r\nwas nearly twenty-six millions; when he quitted office in 1866 the total\r\nwas twenty-four millions. In the middle years it had swelled to\r\ntwenty-eight. After half a dozen years of panic and extravagance, all\r\nsedulously fostered by a strong prime minister, that he should still have\r\nleft the cost of government little higher than he found it was no defeat,\r\nbut an extremely satisfactory performance. “We must follow the nature of\r\nour affairs,” Burke says, “and conform ourselves to our situation. Why\r\nshould we resolve to do nothing because what I propose to you may not be\r\nthe exact demand of the petition? If we cry, like children, for the moon,\r\nlike children we must cry on.”(36)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M17) Ruminating in the late evening of life over his legislative work,\r\nMr. Gladstone wrote: “Selecting the larger measures and looking only to\r\nachieved results, I should take the following heads: 1. The Tariffs,\r\n1842-60. 2. Oxford University Act. 3. Post Office Savings Banks. 4. Irish\r\nChurch Disestablishment. 5. Irish Land Acts. 6. Franchise Act. Although\r\nthis excludes the last of all the efforts, viz., the Irish Government\r\nbill.” The third item in the list belongs to the period (1861) at which we\r\nhave now arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The points to be noted are three. 1. The whole of my action in\r\n    1859-65 was viewed with the utmost jealousy by a large minority\r\n    and a section of the very limited majority. It was an object to me\r\n    to get this bill passed _sub silentio_, a full statement of my\r\n    expectations from it would have been absolutely fatal. I admit\r\n    they have been more than realised. 2. The Trustee Savings Banks\r\n    were doubly defective, nay trebly, for they sometimes broke. (1)\r\n    Their principle was left in doubt—were the general funds in trust,\r\n    or cash at a banker’s? This was vital. (2) They never got or could\r\n    get within the doors of the masses, for they smelt of class. It\r\n    was necessary to provide for the savings of the people with (_a_)\r\n    safety, (_b_) cheapness, (_c_) convenience. The banks _cost_ money\r\n    to the State. The Post Office Savings Banks bring in a revenue. 3.\r\n    Behind all this I had an object of first-rate importance, which\r\n    has been attained: to provide the minister of finance with a\r\n    strong financial arm, and to secure his independence of the City\r\n    by giving him a large and certain command of money.\r\n\r\n\r\nA sequel to this salutary measure was a bill three years later with the\r\napparently unheroic but really beneficent object of facilitating the\r\nacquisition of small annuities, without the risk of fraud or\r\nbankruptcy.(37) An eyewitness tells how (March 7, 1864) “Mr. Gladstone\r\nheld the house for two hours enchained by his defence of a measure which\r\navowedly will not benefit the class from which members are selected; which\r\ninvolves not only a ‘wilderness of figures,’ but calculations of a kind as\r\nintelligible to most men as equations to London cabdrivers; and which,\r\nthough it might and would interest the nation, would never in the nature\r\nof things be made a hustings cry. The riveted attention of the House was\r\nin itself a triumph; the deep impression received by the nation on the\r\nfollowing day was a greater one. It was felt that here was a man who\r\nreally could lead, instead of merely reflecting the conclusions of the\r\npopular mind.” The measure encountered a pretty stiff opposition. The\r\ninsurance companies were vexed that they had neglected their proper\r\nbusiness, others feared that it might undermine the poor law, others again\r\ntook the pessimist’s favourite line that it would be inoperative. But the\r\ncase was good, Mr. Gladstone’s hand was firm, and in due time the bill\r\nbecame law amid a loud chorus of approval.\r\n\r\n(M18) Thus he encouraged, stimulated, and facilitated private and personal\r\nthrift, at the same time and in the same spirit in which he laboured his\r\nfervid exhortations to national economy. He was deeply convinced, he said\r\nand kept saying, “that all excess in the public expenditure beyond the\r\nlegitimate wants of the country is not only a pecuniary waste, but a great\r\npolitical, and above all, a great moral evil. It is a characteristic of\r\nthe mischiefs that arise from financial prodigality that they creep\r\nonwards with a noiseless and a stealthy step; that they commonly remain\r\nunseen and unfelt, until they have reached a magnitude absolutely\r\noverwhelming.” He referred to the case of Austria, where these mischiefs\r\nseemed to threaten the very foundations of empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. The Spirit Of Gladstonian Finance. (1859-1866)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Nations seldom realise till too late how prominent a place a sound\r\n    system of finance holds among the vital elements of national\r\n    stability and well-being; how few political changes are worth\r\n    purchasing by its sacrifice; how widely and seriously human\r\n    happiness is affected by the downfall or the perturbation of\r\n    national credit, or by excessive, injudicious, and unjust\r\n    taxation.—LECKY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn finance, the most important of all the many fields of his activity, Mr.\r\nGladstone had the signal distinction of creating the public opinion by\r\nwhich he worked, and warming the climate in which his projects throve. In\r\nother matters he followed, as it was his business and necessity to follow,\r\nthe governing forces of the public mind; in finance he was a strenuous\r\nleader. He not only led with a boldness sometimes verging on improvidence;\r\napart from the merits of this or that proposal, he raised finance to the\r\nhigh place that belongs to it in the interest, curiosity, and imperious\r\nconcern of every sound self-governing community. Even its narrowest\r\ntechnicalities by his supple and resplendent power as orator were suffused\r\nwith life and colour. When ephemeral critics disparaged him as mere\r\nrhetorician—and nobody denies that he was often declamatory and\r\ndiscursive, that he often over-argued and over-refined—they forgot that he\r\nnowhere exerted greater influence than in that department of affairs where\r\nwords out of relation to fact are most surely exposed. If he often carried\r\nthe proper rhetorical arts of amplification and development to excess, yet\r\nthe basis of fact was both sound and clear, and his digressions, as when,\r\nfor example, he introduced an account of the changes in the English taste\r\nfor wine,(38) were found, and still remain, both relevant and extremely\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\n(M19) One recorder who had listened to all the financiers from Peel\r\ndownwards, said that Peel’s statements were ingenious and able, but dry;\r\nDisraeli was clever but out of his element; Wood was like a cart without\r\nsprings on a heavy road; Gladstone was the only man who could lead his\r\nhearers over the arid desert, and yet keep them cheerful and lively and\r\ninterested without flagging. Another is reminded of Sir Joshua’s picture\r\nof Garrick between tragedy and comedy, such was his duality of attitude\r\nand expression; such the skill with which he varied his moods in a single\r\nspeech, his fervid eloquence and passion, his lightness and buoyancy of\r\nhumour, his lambent and spontaneous sarcasm. Just as Macaulay made\r\nthousands read history who before had turned from it as dry and repulsive,\r\nso Mr. Gladstone made thousands eager to follow the public balance-sheet,\r\nand the whole nation became his audience, interested in him and his themes\r\nand in the House where his dazzling wonders were performed. All this made\r\na magnificent contribution to the national spirit of his time. Such\r\nextraordinary power over others had its mainspring in the depths and zeal\r\nof his own conviction and concern. “For nine or ten months of the year,”\r\nhe told Sir Henry Taylor in 1864, “I am always willing to go out of\r\noffice, but in the two or three that precede the budget I begin to feel an\r\nitch to have the handling of it. Last summer I should have been delighted\r\nto go out; now [December] I am indifferent; in February, if I live as\r\nlong, I shall, I have no doubt, be loath; but in April quite ready again.\r\nSuch are my signs of the zodiac.” The eagerness of his own mind\r\ntransmitted itself like an electric current through his audience.\r\n\r\nInterest abroad was almost as much alive as the interest felt in England\r\nitself. We have already seen how keenly Cavour followed Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nperformances. His budget speeches were circulated by foreign ministers\r\namong deputies and editors. Fould, one of the best of Napoleon’s finance\r\nministers, kept up a pretty steady correspondence with the English\r\nchancellor: appeals to him as to the sound doctrine on sugar drawbacks; is\r\nmuch struck by his proposals on Scotch banks; says mournfully to him\r\n(April 28, 1863), in a sentence that is a whole chapter in the history of\r\nthe empire: “You are very fortunate in being able to give such relief to\r\nthe taxpayers; if it had not been for the war in Mexico, I should perhaps\r\nhave been able to do something of the same sort, and that would have been,\r\nespecially in view of the elections, very favourable to the government of\r\nthe Emperor.’”\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gladstone came to leave office in 1866, he said to Fould (July\r\n11): “The statesmen of to-day have a new mission opened to them: the\r\nmission of substituting the concert of nations for their conflicts, and of\r\nteaching them to grow great in common, and to give to others by giving to\r\nthemselves. Of this beneficent work a good share has fallen to the\r\ndepartments with which we have respectively been connected.” Fould had\r\nalready deplored his loss. “I counted,” he says, “on the influence of your\r\nwise doctrines in finance, to help me in maintaining our country in that\r\nsystem of order and economy, of which you were setting the example.” Alas,\r\nin France and in continental Europe generally at that time, selfish\r\nmaterial interests and their class representatives were very strong,\r\npopular power was weak; in most of them the soldier was the master.\r\nHappily for our famous chancellor of the exchequer, England was different.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said that he ignored the social question; did not even\r\nseem to know there was one. The truth is, that what marks him from other\r\nchancellors is exactly the dominating hold gained by the social question\r\nin all its depth and breadth upon his most susceptible imagination. Tariff\r\nreform, adjustment of burdens, invincible repugnance to waste or\r\nprofusion, accurate keeping and continuous scrutiny of accounts,\r\nsubstitution of a few good taxes for many bad ones,—all these were not\r\nmerely the love of a methodical and thrifty man for habits of business;\r\nthey were directly associated in him with the amelioration of the hard lot\r\nof the toiling mass, and sprang from an ardent concern in improving human\r\nwell-being, and raising the moral ideals of mankind. In his “musings for\r\nthe good of man,” Liberation of Intercourse, to borrow his own larger name\r\nfor free trade, figured in his mind’s eye as one of the promoting\r\nconditions of abundant employment. “If you want,” he said in a pregnant\r\nproposition, “to benefit the labouring classes and to do the maximum of\r\ngood, it is not enough to operate upon the articles consumed by them; you\r\nshould rather operate on the articles that give them the maximum of\r\nemployment.” In other words, you should extend the area of trade by\r\nsteadily removing restrictions. He recalled the days when our predecessors\r\nthought it must be for man’s good to have “most of the avenues by which\r\nthe mind, and also the hand of man conveyed and exchanged their respective\r\nproducts,” blocked or narrowed by regulation and taxation. Dissemination\r\nof news, travelling, letters, transit of goods, were all made as costly\r\nand difficult as the legislator could make them. “I rank,” he said, “the\r\nintroduction of cheap postage for letters, documents, patterns, and\r\nprinted matter, and the abolition of all taxes on printed matter, in the\r\ncatalogue of free trade legislation. These great measures may well take\r\ntheir place beside the abolition of prohibitions and protective duties,\r\nthe simplifying of revenue laws, and the repeal of the Navigation Act, as\r\nforming together the great code of industrial emancipation.”(39)\r\n\r\n(M20) It was not unnatural that fault should be found with him for not\r\nmaking a more resolute effort to lighten the burden of that heavy mortgage\r\nwhich, under the name of the National Debt, we have laid upon the industry\r\nand property of the nation. In 1866 he was keenly excited by Jevons’s\r\nargument from the ultimate shrinkage of our coal supply, and he accepted\r\nthe inference that we should vigorously apply ourselves by reduction of\r\nthe debt to preparation for the arrival of the evil day. But, as he wrote\r\nto Jevons (March 16, 1866), “Until the great work of the liberation of\r\nindustry was in the main effected, it would have been premature or even\r\nwrong to give too much prominence to this view of the subject. Nor do I\r\nregard that liberation as yet having reached the point at which we might\r\nsay, we will now cease to make remission of taxes a principal element and\r\naim in finance. But we are in my judgment near it. And I am most anxious\r\nthat the public should begin to take a closer and more practical view of\r\nthe topics which you have done so much to bring into prominence.”\r\n\r\nHe was always thinking of the emancipation of commerce, like Peel and\r\nCobden. His general policy was simple. When great expenditure demanded\r\nlarge revenue, he raised his money by high income-tax, and high rates of\r\nduty on a few articles, neither absolute necessities of life nor raw\r\nmaterials of manufacture. He left the income-tax at fourpence. In 1866, he\r\ntold the House that the new parliament then about to be elected might\r\ndispense with the tax. “If,” he said, “parliament and the country\r\npreferred to retain the tax, then the rate of fourpence is the rate at\r\nwhich in time of peace and in the absence of any special emergency, we\r\nbelieve it may be most justly and wisely so retained.” While cordially\r\nembracing Cobden’s policy of combining free trade with retrenchment, he\r\ncould not withstand a carnal satisfaction at abundant revenue. Deploring\r\nexpenditure with all his soul, he still rubs his hands in professional\r\npride at the elasticity of the revenue under his management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it is asked, with no particular relevancy, what original contribution\r\nof the first order was made by Mr. Gladstone to the science of national\r\nfinance, we may return the same answer as if it were asked of Walpole,\r\nPitt, or Peel. It was for Adam Smith from his retreat upon the sea-beach\r\nof distant Kirkcaldy to introduce new and fruitful ideas, though he too\r\nowed a debt to French economists. The statesman’s business is not to\r\ninvent ideas in finance, but to create occasions and contrive expedients\r\nfor applying them. “What an extraordinary man Pitt is,” said Adam Smith;\r\n“he understands my ideas better than I understand them myself.”\r\nOriginality may lie as much in perception of opportunity as in invention.\r\nCobden discovered no new economic truths that I know of, but his\r\nperception of the bearings of abstract economic truths upon the actual and\r\nprospective circumstances of his country and the world, made him the most\r\noriginal economic statesman of his day. The glory of Mr. Gladstone was\r\ndifferent. It rested on the practical power and tenacity with which he\r\nopened new paths, and forced the application of sound doctrine over long\r\nsuccessions of countless obstacles.\r\n\r\n(M21) If we probe his fame as financier to the core and marrow, it was not\r\nhis power as orator, it was not his ingenuity in device and expedient, it\r\nwas his unswerving faith in certain fixed aims, and his steadfast and\r\ninsistent zeal in pursuing them, that built up the splendid edifice. Pitt\r\nperformed striking financial feats, especially in the consolidation of\r\nduties, in reformed administration, and in the French treaty of 1786. But\r\nill-fortune dragged him into the vortex of European war, and finance sank\r\ninto the place of a secondary instrument, an art for devising aliments,\r\nsome of them desperate enough, for feeding the war-chest of the nation.\r\nSir Robert Walpole, Mr. Gladstone wrote, “had not to contend with like\r\ndifficulties, and I think his administration should be compared with the\r\nearly years of Pitt, in which way of judging he would come off second,\r\nthough a man of cool and sagacious judgment, while morally he stood\r\nlow.”(40)\r\n\r\nIn the happier conditions of his time, Mr. Gladstone was able to use wise\r\nand bold finance as the lever for enlarging all the facilities of life,\r\nand diffusing them over the widest area. If men sometimes smile at his\r\nextraordinary zeal for cheap wines and cheap books and low railway fares,\r\nif they are sometimes provoked by his rather harsh views on privileges for\r\npatents and copyrights for authors, restrictive of the common enjoyment,\r\nit is well to remember that all this and the like came from what was at\r\nonce clear financial vision and true social feeling. “A financial\r\nexperience,” he once said, “which is long and wide, has profoundly\r\nconvinced me that, as a rule, the state or individual or company thrives\r\nbest which dives deepest down into the mass of the community, and adapts\r\nits arrangements to the wants of the greatest number.” His exultation in\r\nthe stimulus given by fiscal freedom to extended trade, and therefore to\r\nmore abundant employment at higher wages, was less the exultation of the\r\neconomist watching the intoxicating growth of wealth, than of the social\r\nmoralist surveying multiplied access to fuller life and more felicity. I\r\nalways remember, in a roving talk with him in 1891, when he was a very old\r\nman and ill, how he gradually took fire at the notion—I forget how it\r\narose—of the iniquities under which the poor man suffered a generation\r\nago. “See—the sons and daughters went forth from their homes; the cost of\r\npostage was so high that correspondence was practically prohibited; yet\r\nthe rich all the time, by the privilege of franking, carried on a really\r\nimmense amount of letter-writing absolutely free. Think what a softening\r\nof domestic exile; what an aid in keeping warm the feel of family\r\naffection, in mitigating the rude breach in the circle of the hearth.”\r\nThis vigorous sympathy was with Mr. Gladstone a living part of his\r\nChristian enthusiasm. “If you would gain mankind,” said old Jeremy\r\nBentham, “the best way is to appear to love them, and the best way of\r\nappearing to love them, is to love them in reality.” When he thought of\r\nthe effect of his work at the exchequer, he derived “profound and\r\ninestimable consolation from the reflection that while the rich have been\r\ngrowing richer, the poor have become less poor.” Yet, as my readers have\r\nby this time found out, there never was a man less in need of Aristotle’s\r\nwarning, that to be forever hunting after the useful befits not those of\r\nfree and lofty soul.(41) As was noted by contemporaries, like all the\r\nfollowers of Sir Robert Peel he never thought without an eye to\r\nutilitarian results, but mixed with that attitude of mind he had “a\r\ncertain refinement and subtlety of religiousness that redeemed it from the\r\ncoldness, if it sometimes overshadowed the clearness, of mere\r\nstatesmanlike prudence.” On the other hand, he had “the Lancashire\r\ntemperament.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M22) This thought and feeling for the taxpayer was at the root of another\r\nachievement, no less original than the peculiar interest that he was able\r\nto excite by his manner of stating a financial case. Peel was only prime\r\nminister for five years, and only four months chancellor. Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas prime minister for twelve—ten years short of Sir Robert Walpole in\r\nthat office, seven years short of Pitt. But he was also chancellor of the\r\nexchequer under three other prime ministers for ten years. Thus his\r\nconnection with the treasury covered a longer period than was attained by\r\nthe greatest of his predecessors. His long reign at the treasury, and his\r\npersonal predominance in parliament and the country, enabled him to stamp\r\non the public departments administrative principles of the utmost breadth\r\nand strength. Thrift of public money, resolute resistance to waste, rigid\r\nexactitude in time, and all the other aspects of official duty, conviction\r\nthat in the working of the vast machinery of state nothing is a\r\ntrifle—through the firm establishment of maxims and principles of this\r\nsort, Mr. Gladstone built up a strong and efficacious system of\r\nadministrative unity that must be counted a conspicuous part of his very\r\ngreatest work. “No chancellor of the exchequer,” he once said, “is worth\r\nhis salt who makes his own popularity either his first consideration, or\r\nany consideration at all, in administering the public purse. In my\r\nopinion, the chancellor of the exchequer is the trusted and confidential\r\nsteward of the public. He is under a sacred obligation with regard to all\r\nthat he consents to spend.”(42) This tone of thinking and feeling about\r\nthe service of the state spread under his magisterial influence from\r\nchancellors and the permanent officers that bear unobtrusive but effective\r\nsway in Whitehall, down to tide waiters and distributors of stamps. As\r\nBurke put the old Latin saw, he endeavoured to “give us a system of\r\neconomy, which is itself a great revenue.” The Exchequer and Audit Act of\r\n1866 is a monument of his zeal and power in this direction. It converted\r\nthe nominal control by parliament into a real control, and has borne the\r\nstrain of nearly forty years.\r\n\r\nHe was more alive than any man at the exchequer had ever been before, to\r\nthe mischiefs of the spirit of expenditure. As he told the House of\r\nCommons in 1863 (April 16): “I mean this, that together with the so-called\r\nincrease of expenditure there grows up what may be termed a spirit of\r\nexpenditure, a desire, a tendency prevailing in the country, which,\r\ninsensibly and unconsciously perhaps, but really, affects the spirit of\r\nthe people, the spirit of parliament, the spirit of the public\r\ndepartments, and perhaps even the spirit of those whose duty it is to\r\nsubmit the estimates to parliament.” “But how,” he wrote to Cobden (Jan.\r\n5, 1864), “is the spirit of expenditure to be exorcised? Not by my\r\npreaching; I doubt if even by yours. I seriously doubt whether it will\r\never give place to the old spirit of economy, as long as we have the\r\nincome-tax. There, or hard by, lie questions of deep practical moment.”\r\nThis last pregnant reference to the income-tax, makes it worth while to\r\ninsert here a word or two from letters of 1859 to his brother Robertson,\r\nan even more ardent financial reformer than himself:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Economy is the first and great article (economy such as I\r\n    understand it) in my financial creed. The controversy between\r\n    direct and indirect taxation holds a minor though important place.\r\n    I have not the smallest doubt we should at this moment have had a\r\n    smaller expenditure if financial reformers had not directed their\r\n    chief attention, not to the question how much of expenditure and\r\n    taxes we shall have, but to the question how it should be\r\n    raised.... I agree with you that if you had only direct taxes, you\r\n    would have economical government. But in my opinion the indirect\r\n    taxes will last as long as the monarchy; and while we have them, I\r\n    am deeply convinced that the facility of recurring to, and of\r\n    maintaining, income-tax has been a main source of that\r\n    extravagance in government, which I date from the Russian war (for\r\n    before that a good spirit had prevailed for some twenty-five\r\n    years).\r\n\r\n\r\nBagehot, that economist who united such experience and sense with so much\r\nsubtlety and humour, wrote to Mr. Gladstone in 1868: “Indirect taxation so\r\ncramps trade and heavy direct taxation so impairs morality that a large\r\nexpenditure becomes a great evil. I have often said so to Sir G. Lewis,\r\nbut he always answered, ‘Government is a very rough business. You must be\r\ncontent with very unsatisfactory results.’ ” This was a content that Mr.\r\nGladstone never learned.\r\n\r\n(M23) It was not only in the finance of millions that he showed himself a\r\nhero. “The chancellor of the exchequer,” he said, “should boldly uphold\r\neconomy in detail; and it is the mark of a chicken-hearted chancellor when\r\nhe shrinks from upholding economy in detail, when because it is a question\r\nof only two or three thousand pounds, he says that is no matter. He is\r\nridiculed, no doubt, for what is called candle-ends and cheese-parings,\r\nbut he is not worth his salt if he is not ready to save what are meant by\r\ncandle-ends and cheese-parings in the cause of the country.”(43) He held\r\nit to be his special duty in his office not simply to abolish sinecures,\r\nbut to watch for every opportunity of cutting down all unnecessary\r\nappointments. He hears that a clerk at the national debt office is at\r\ndeath’s door, and on the instant writes to Lord Palmerston that there is\r\nno necessity to appoint a successor. During the last twenty years, he said\r\nin 1863, “since I began to deal with these subjects, every financial\r\nchange beneficial to the country at large has been met with a threat that\r\nsomebody would be dismissed.” All such discouragements he treated with the\r\nhalf scornful scepticism without which no administrative reformer will go\r\nfar.\r\n\r\nHe did not think it beneath his dignity to appeal to the foreign office\r\nfor a retrenchment in fly-leaves and thick folio sheets used for docketing\r\nonly, and the same for mere covering despatches without description; for\r\nall these had to be bound, and the bound books wanted bookcases, and the\r\nbookcases wanted buildings, and the libraries wanted librarians. “My idea\r\nis that it would be quite worth while to appoint an official committee\r\nfrom various departments to go over the ‘contingencies’ and minor charges\r\nof the different departments into which abuse must always be creeping,\r\nfrom the nature of the case and without much blame to any one.” Sir R.\r\nBethell as attorney-general insisted on the duty incumbent on certain high\r\nofficials, including secretaries of state, of taking out patents for their\r\noffices, and paying the stamp duties of two hundred pounds apiece thereon.\r\n“I shall deal with these eminent persons,” he wrote to the chancellor of\r\nthe exchequer, “exactly as I should and do daily deal with John Smith\r\naccused of fraud as a distiller, or John Brown reported as guilty of\r\nsmuggling tobacco.” Mr. Gladstone replies (1859):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I rejoice to see that neither the heat, the stench, nor service in\r\n    the courts can exhaust even your superfluous vigour; and it is\r\n    most ennobling to see such energies devoted to the highest of all\r\n    purposes—that of replenishing her Majesty’s exchequer. I hope,\r\n    however, that in one point the case stands better than I had\r\n    supposed. The proof of absolute contumacy is not yet complete,\r\n    though, alas, the _animus furandi_ stands forth in all its hideous\r\n    colours. I spoke yesterday to Lord Palmerston on the painful\r\n    theme; and he confessed to me with much emotion that he has not\r\n    yet resorted to those mild means of exhortation—what the\r\n    presbyterians call dealing with an erring brother—from which we\r\n    had hoped much. The unhappy men may therefore yet come to their\r\n    senses; in any case I rejoice to think that you, in the new\r\n    capacity of mad doctor, are sure to cure them and abate the\r\n    mischief, if the which do not happen (I quote the new Tennyson):—\r\n\r\n    “some evil chance\r\n    Will make the smouldering scandal break and blaze\r\n    Before the people and our Lord the King.”(44)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a due amount of amusing correspondence, the recusant confederacy\r\nstruck their colours and paid their money.\r\n\r\n\r\n    When he went to Corfu in the _Terrible_ in 1858, some two or three\r\n    sleeping cabins were made by wooden partitions put up round spaces\r\n    taken off the deck. Thirteen years after, his unslumbering memory\r\n    made this an illustrating point in an exhortation to a first lord\r\n    of the admiralty not to disregard small outgoings. “I never in my\r\n    life was more astonished than upon being told the sum this had\r\n    cost; I think it was in hundreds of pounds, where I should have\r\n    expected tens.” Sometimes, no doubt, this thrift descended to the\r\n    ludicrous. On this same expedition to Corfu, among the small\r\n    pieces of economy enjoined by Mr. Gladstone on the members of his\r\n    mission, one was to scratch out the address on the parchment label\r\n    of the despatch bags and to use the same label in returning the\r\n    bag to the colonial office in London. One day while the secretary\r\n    was busily engaged in thus saving a few halfpence, an officer came\r\n    into the room, having arrived by a special steamer from Trieste at\r\n    a cost of between seven and eight hundred pounds. The ordinary\r\n    mail-boat would have brought him a very few hours later. We can\r\n    hardly wonder that the heroical economist denounced such pranks as\r\n    “profligate” and much else. Though an individual case may often\r\n    enough seem ludicrous, yet the system and the spirit engendered by\r\n    it were to the taxpayer, that is to the nation, priceless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the few failures of this active and fruitful period was the\r\nproposal (1863) that charities should pay income-tax upon the returns from\r\ntheir endowments. What is their exemption but the equivalent of a gift to\r\nthem from the general taxpayer? He has to make good the sum that ought in\r\nreason and equity to have been paid by them, as by other people, to the\r\ngovernment that protects them. Why should this burden be compulsorily laid\r\nupon him? What is the quality of an endowment for a charitable purpose\r\nthat constitutes a valid claim for such a boon? Into this case Mr.\r\nGladstone threw himself with full force. The opposition to him was as\r\nheated and as vigorous as he ever provoked, and the violence of the\r\nresistance roused an answering vehemence in him. He speaks in his diary of\r\nhis “deadly encounter with the so-called charities.” “I was endeavouring,”\r\nhe says, “to uphold the reality of truth and justice against their\r\nsuperficial and flimsy appearances.” “Spoke from 5.10 to 8.20, with all my\r\nmight, such as it was.” This speech, with its fierce cogency and trenchant\r\nreasoning, was counted by good judges who heard it, to be among the two or\r\nthree most powerful that he ever made, and even to-day it may be read with\r\nthe same sort of interest as we give to Turgot’s famous disquisition on\r\nFoundations. It turns a rude searchlight upon illusions about charity that\r\nare all the more painful to dispel, because they often spring from pity\r\nand from sympathy, not the commonest of human elements. It affects the\r\njurist, the economist, the moralist, the politician. The House was\r\nprofoundly impressed by both the argument and the performance, but the\r\nclamour was too loud, all the idols of market-place and tribe were marched\r\nout in high parade, and the proposal at last was dropped.\r\n\r\n(M24) Though the idea of putting a tax on the income of charitable\r\nendowments was rejected, the budget of 1863 was the record of a triumph\r\nthat was complete. The American civil war by arresting the supply of\r\ncotton had half ruined Lancashire. The same cause had diminished the\r\nexport trade to America by six millions sterling. Three bad seasons\r\nspoiled the crops. There was distress in Ireland. Yet the chancellor had a\r\nrevenue in excess of expenditure by the noble figure of three millions and\r\nthree quarters. Mr. Gladstone naturally took the opportunity of surveying\r\nthe effects of four years of his financial policy. He admitted that they\r\nhad been four years of tension, and this tension had been enhanced by his\r\nlarge remissions of duty, and by taking in hand the completion of the\r\ngreat work of commercial legislation. The end of it all was a growth of\r\nwealth, as he called it, almost intoxicating. The value of British goods\r\nsent to France had risen from four millions and three quarters to nearly\r\nnine millions and one quarter, in other words had about doubled under the\r\noperations of the treaty of commerce.(45) If to this were added foreign\r\nand colonial produce sent through us, and acquired by us in exchange for\r\nour own produce, the value had risen from nine and a half in 1859 to\r\ntwenty-one and three quarters in 1862. In Mr. Gladstone’s own description\r\nlater, the export trade of 1860, in spite of a bad harvest, was so\r\nstimulated by the liberating customs act, that it rose at once from a\r\nhundred and thirty millions to a hundred and thirty-five. The next year it\r\nfell to a hundred and twenty-five, and in 1862 it fell by another million\r\nowing to the withdrawal, by reason of the American war, of the material of\r\nour greatest manufacture. In 1866 it rose to a hundred and eighty-eight\r\nmillions.(46) Then under the head of income-tax, and comparing 1842 with\r\n1862, over the same area, and with the same limitations, the aggregate\r\namount of assessed income had risen from one hundred and fifty-six\r\nmillions to two hundred and twenty-one. Other tests and figures need not\r\ndetain us.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 16, 1863._—My statement lasted three hours, and this with a\r\n    good deal of compression. It wound up, I hope, a chapter in\r\n    finance and in my life. Thanks to God. 17.—The usual sense of\r\n    relaxation after an effort. I am oppressed too with a feeling of\r\n    deep unworthiness, inability to answer my vocation, and the desire\r\n    of rest. 18.—To Windsor, had an audience of the Queen; so warm\r\n    about Sir G. Lewis, and she warned me not to overwork.\r\n\r\n\r\nLewis had died five days before (April 13), and this is Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nentry:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 14._—Reached C.H.T. at 11-1/4, and was met by the sad news\r\n    of the death of Sir George Lewis. I am pained to think of my\r\n    differences with him at one time on finance; however, he took\r\n    benefit by them rather than otherwise. A most able, most learned,\r\n    most unselfish, and most genial man.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Sir Gilbert Lewis, he wrote (April 18):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Like several eminent public men of our time, he had many qualities\r\n    for which the outer world did not perhaps, though it may not have\r\n    denied them, ever give him full positive credit. For example, his\r\n    singular courtesy and careful attention to others in all\r\n    transactions great and small; his thoroughly warm and most\r\n    forthcoming and genial disposition; his almost unconsciousness of\r\n    the vast stores of his mind, and of the great facility and\r\n    marvellous precision with which he used them; and, if I may so\r\n    say, the noble and antique simplicity of character which he united\r\n    with such knowledge of men and of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final budget of this most remarkable series was that of 1866, when he\r\nswept away the last of the old vexatious duties on timber. It contained\r\nanother element as to which, as I have said, some thought he had not been\r\nkeen enough. In the budget of 1866 he first started the scheme of a\r\nsinking fund, which, when amplified, and particularly when simplified by\r\nhis successors, did so much to reduce the dead weight of debt.(47) The\r\ncomplication of his scheme was due to his desire to make sure of its\r\nstability, and undoubtedly he would have carried it if he had remained in\r\noffice through the session. He is, however, entitled to credit for laying\r\nthe foundation of an effective sinking fund.\r\n\r\nOne word more may be added on Mr. Gladstone as financier. He was far too\r\ncomprehensive in his outlook to suppose that the great outburst of\r\nmaterial prosperity during the years in which he controlled the exchequer\r\nand guided parliament in affairs of money, was wholly and without\r\nqualification due to budgets alone. To insist on ascribing complex results\r\nto single causes is the well-known vice of narrow and untrained minds. He\r\nwas quite alive to the effects of “the enormous, constant, rapid, and\r\ndiversified development of mechanical power, and the consequent saving of\r\nlabour by the extension of machinery.” He was well aware of the share of\r\nnew means of locomotion in the growth of industrial enterprise. But the\r\nspecial cause of what was most peculiar to England in the experience of\r\nthis period he considered to be the wise legislation of parliament, in\r\nseeking every opportunity for abolishing restrictions upon the application\r\nof capital and the exercise of industry and skill. In this wise\r\nlegislation his own energetic and beneficent genius played the master\r\npart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V. American Civil War. (1861-1863)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Then came the outbreak which had been so often foretold, so often\r\n    menaced; and the ground reeled under the nation during four years\r\n    of agony, until at last, after the smoke of the battlefield had\r\n    cleared away, the horrid shape which had cast its shadow over a\r\n    whole continent had vanished, and was gone for ever.—JOHN BRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Cornewall Lewis in a memorandum printed for the use of his colleagues\r\nboth truly and impressively described the momentous struggle that at this\r\ntime broke upon the family of civilised nations in both hemispheres. “It\r\nmay be fairly asserted,” says the particularly competent writer of it,\r\n“that the war in America is the greatest event that has occurred in the\r\npolitical world since the definitive fall of Napoleon in 1815. The\r\nexpulsion of the elder branch of the Bourbons in 1830; the expulsion of\r\nLouis Philippe in 1848; the re-establishment of a republic, and the\r\nsubsequent restoration of a Bonaparte to the imperial throne—were all\r\nimportant events, both to France and to the rest of Europe; but (with the\r\nexception of the recent annexation of Savoy and Nice) they have not\r\naltered the boundaries of France; and Europe still, in spite of minor\r\nchanges, substantially retains the form impressed upon it by the treaty of\r\nVienna.(48) With respect to the internal consequences of these changes, a\r\nFrench revolution has become a fight in the streets of Paris, in order to\r\ndetermine who shall be the occupant of the Tuileries. The administrative\r\nbody and the army—the two great governing powers of France—remain\r\nsubstantially unaffected; whereas the American civil war threatens a\r\ncomplete territorial re-arrangement of the Union; it also portends a\r\nfundamental change in the constitution, by which both its federal and\r\nstate elements will be recast.”\r\n\r\nOf this immense conflict Mr. Gladstone, like most of the leading statesmen\r\nof the time, and like the majority of his countrymen, failed to take the\r\ntrue measure. The error that lay at the root of our English misconception\r\nof the American struggle is now clear. We applied ordinary political\r\nmaxims to what was not merely a political contest, but a social\r\nrevolution. Without scrutiny of the cardinal realities beneath, we\r\ndiscussed it like some superficial conflict in our old world about\r\nboundaries, successions, territorial partitions, dynastic preponderance.\r\nThe significance of the American war was its relation to slavery. That war\r\narose from the economic, social, and political consequences that flowed\r\nfrom slavery—its wasteful cultivation, the consequent need for extension\r\nof slave territory, the probable revival of the accursed African trade,\r\nthe constitution of slave-holders as the sole depositaries of social\r\nprestige and political power. Secession was undertaken for the purpose of\r\nerecting into an independent state a community whose whole structure was\r\nmoulded on a system that held labour in contempt, that kept the labourer\r\nin ignorance and cruel bondage, that demanded a vigilant censorship of the\r\npress and an army of watchmen and spies. And this barbaric state was to\r\nset itself up on the border of a great nation, founded on free industry,\r\npolitical equality, diffused knowledge, energetic progress. Such was the\r\nmeaning of secession. “The rebellion,” as Charles Sumner well said to Mr.\r\nGladstone in 1864, “is slavery in arms, revolting, indecent, imperious.”\r\nTherefore those who fought against secession fought against slavery and\r\nall that was involved in that dark burden, and whatever their motives may\r\nat different times have been, they rendered an immortal service to\r\nhumanity.(49)\r\n\r\n(M25) At a very early period Mr. Gladstone formed the opinion that the\r\nattempt to restore the Union by force would and must fail. “As far as the\r\n_controversy_ between North and South,” he wrote to the Duchess of\r\nSutherland (May 29, 1861) “is a controversy on the principle announced by\r\nthe vice-president of the South, viz. that which asserts the superiority\r\nof the white man, and therewith founds on it his right to hold the black\r\nin slavery, I think that principle detestable, and I am wholly with the\r\nopponents of it.... No distinction can in my eyes be broader than the\r\ndistinction between the question whether the Southern ideas of slavery are\r\nright, and the question whether they can justifiably be put down by war\r\nfrom the North.” To Cyrus Field he wrote (Nov. 27, 1862): “Your frightful\r\nconflict may be regarded from many points of view. The competency of the\r\nSouthern states to secede; the rightfulness of their conduct in seceding\r\n(two matters wholly distinct and a great deal too much confounded); the\r\nnatural reluctance of Northern Americans to acquiesce in the severance of\r\nthe union, and the apparent loss of strength and glory to their country;\r\nthe bearing of the separation on the real interests and on the moral\r\ncharacter of the North; again, for an Englishman, its bearing with respect\r\nto British interests;—all these are texts of which any one affords ample\r\nmatter for reflection, but I will only state as regards the last of them,\r\nthat I for one have never hesitated to maintain that, in my opinion, the\r\nseparate and special interests of England were all on the side of the\r\nmaintenance of the old union, and if I were to look at those interests\r\nalone, and had the power of choosing in what way the war should end, I\r\nwould choose for its ending by the restoration of the old union this very\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the Duchess of Sutherland (Nov. 7, 1862), he says: “A\r\nfriendly correspondent writes to say he is sorry the South has my\r\nsympathies. But the South has not my sympathies, except in the sense in\r\nwhich the North has them also. I wish them both cordially well, which I\r\nbelieve is more than most Englishmen can at present say with truth. In\r\nboth I see the elements of future power and good; in both I see also the\r\nelements of danger and mischief.’ To another correspondent: ’I have never\r\nto my knowledge expressed any sympathy with the Southern cause in any\r\nspeech at Newcastle or elsewhere, nor have I passed any eulogium upon\r\nPresident Davis. In dealing whether with South or North I have thought it\r\nout of my province to touch in any way the complicated question of praise\r\nand blame.”\r\n\r\nAt a very early stage the Duke of Argyll sent him some letter of Mrs.\r\nBeecher Stowe’s, and Mr. Gladstone in acknowledging it from Penmaenmawr\r\n(Aug. 26, 1861) writes expressing all possible respect for her character\r\nand talents, but thinks that she has lost intellectual integrity:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It seems to me that the South has two objects in view: firstly the\r\n    liberation of its trade and people from the law of tribute to the\r\n    North; secondly and perhaps mainly, the maintenance of the slave\r\n    system without fear or risk of Northern interference. That on the\r\n    other hand it is very difficult to analyse that movement of the\r\n    North which Mrs. Stowe finds sublime, but which in my eyes is\r\n    tumultuous. There is the anti-slavery motive impelling with great\r\n    vehemence a small section, which she rather offensively calls the\r\n    Christian people of the union; there is the spirit of protection\r\n    and monopoly, unwilling to surrender future booty; there is the\r\n    unquietness in the great towns, found in America as in all\r\n    countries, and ever ready for a row; there is the fear which Mr.\r\n    Motley described, that unless a firm front were shown against\r\n    secession it would not stop where it had begun; there is last and\r\n    (relatively to this subject matter) best of all the strong\r\n    instinct of national life, and the abhorrence of nature itself\r\n    towards all severance of an organised body. This last sentiment,\r\n    as well as the first, deserved to be treated by us with great\r\n    tenderness and respect.... As to the authority and title of the\r\n    North it must be granted _primâ facie_, but on examination it is\r\n    subject to a good deal of doubt, and I think it seems to have been\r\n    the intention of the framers of the constitution not to lay down a\r\n    rule for the solution of a great question of this kind, but to\r\n    leave it open. And if so, I think they were wise; for such a\r\n    question could only arise for any practical purpose at a time when\r\n    the foundations of the great social deep are broken up, and when\r\n    the forces brought into unrestrained play are by far too gigantic\r\n    to be controlled by paper conventions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much for his view of the case in its general aspect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt one dangerous moment in the conflict it seemed possible that Great\r\nBritain might be forced to take a part. The commander of an American\r\nman-of-war boarded the _Trent_ (Nov. 8, 1861), a British mail-boat, seized\r\ntwo emissaries from the Southern confederacy on their way to Europe, and\r\ncarried them off to his own ship, whence they were afterwards landed and\r\nthrown into prison. This act was in direct violation of those rights of\r\nneutrals of which the United States hitherto had been the strictest\r\nchampion against Great Britain; and nothing was to be gained by it, for\r\nthe presence of the two commissioners was not in the least likely to\r\neffect any change in the policy of either England or France. Violent\r\nexplosions of public feeling broke out on both sides of the Atlantic; of\r\nanger in England, of exultation in America. Mr. Gladstone’s movements at\r\nthis critical hour are interesting. On Nov. 27, says Phillimore,\r\n“Gladstones dined here. Gladstone, with the account in his pocket from the\r\nevening papers of the capture of the Southern envoys out of the English\r\nmail-ship.” The next two nights he was at court.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 28._—Off at 6.30 to Windsor. The Queen and Prince spoke much\r\n    of the American news.\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 29_ (Friday).—Came up to town for the cabinet on American\r\n    news. Returned to Windsor for dinner, and reported to Queen and\r\n    Prince.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this important cabinet, Mr. Gladstone wrote an account to the Duke of\r\nArgyll, then absent from London:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 3, ’61._—The cabinet determined on Friday to ask reparation,\r\n    and on Saturday they agreed to two despatches to Lord Lyons of\r\n    which the one recited the facts, stated we could not but suppose\r\n    the American government would of itself be desirous to afford us\r\n    reparation, and said that in any case we must have (1) the\r\n    commissioners returned to British protection; and (2) an apology\r\n    or expression of regret. The second of these despatches desired\r\n    Lyons to come away within seven days if the demands are not\r\n    complied with. _I thought and urged that we should hear what the\r\n    Americans had to say before withdrawing Lyons, for I could not\r\n    feel sure that we were at the bottom of the law of the case, or\r\n    could judge here and now what form it would assume. But this view\r\n    did not prevail._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may assume that Mr. Gladstone, in reporting these proceedings at\r\nWindsor, did not conceal his own arguments for moderation which had been\r\noverruled. On the following day the cabinet again met. “Nov. 30 (Sat.).\r\nLeft Windsor at 11.25. Cabinet 3-5-½. Lord Russell’s draft softened and\r\nabridged.” That is to say the draft was brought nearer, though not near\r\nenough, to the temper urged upon the cabinet and represented at court by\r\nMr. Gladstone the day before.\r\n\r\nThe story of the first of these two critical despatches is pretty well\r\nknown; how the draft initialled by Lord Russell was sent down the same\r\nnight to Windsor; how the Prince Consort—then as it proved rapidly sinking\r\ndown into his fatal illness—found it somewhat meagre, and suggested\r\nmodifications and simplifications; how the Queen returned the draft with\r\nthe suggestions in a letter to the prime minister; how Palmerston thought\r\nthem excellent, and after remodelling the draft in the more temperate\r\nspirit recommended by the Prince, though dropping at least one irritating\r\nphrase in the Queen’s memorandum,(50) sent it back to the foreign office,\r\nwhence it was duly sent on (Dec. 1) to Lord Lyons at Washington. It seems,\r\nmoreover, that a day’s reflection had brought his colleagues round to Mr.\r\nGladstone’s mind, for Lord Russell wrote to Lord Lyons a private note\r\n(Dec. 1) in effect instructing him to say nothing about withdrawing in\r\nseven days.(51)\r\n\r\n(M26) The British despatches were delivered to Lord Lyons at Washington at\r\nmidnight on December 18; the reparation despatch was formally read to Mr.\r\nSeward on the 23rd; and on Christmas Day Lincoln had a meeting of his\r\ncabinet. Sumner was invited to attend, and he read long letters from\r\nCobden and Bright. “At all hazards,” said Bright, “you must not let this\r\nmatter grow to a war with England. Even if you are right and we are wrong,\r\nwar will be fatal to your idea of restoring the union.... I implore you\r\nnot, on any feeling that nothing can be conceded, and that England is\r\narrogant and seeking a quarrel, to play the game of every enemy of your\r\ncountry.”(52) A French despatch in the English sense was also read. Seward\r\nand Sumner were in favour of giving up the men. The president, thinking of\r\npopular excitement, hesitated. In the end, partly because the case was bad\r\non the merits, partly because they could not afford to have a second great\r\nwar upon their hands, all came round to Seward’s view.(53)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the autumn of 1862 the war had lasted a year and a half. It was already\r\nentailing a cost heavier than our war with Napoleon at its most expensive\r\nperiod. The North had still failed to execute its declared purpose of\r\nreducing the South to submission. The blockade of the Southern ports, by\r\nstopping the export of cotton, was declared to have produced worse\r\nprivations, loss, and suffering to England and France than were ever\r\nproduced to neutral nations by a war. It was not in Mr. Gladstone’s nature\r\nto sit with folded hands in sight of what he took to be hideous and\r\nunavailing carnage and havoc. Lord Palmerston, he tells Mrs. Gladstone\r\n(July 29, 1862), “has come exactly to my mind about some early\r\nrepresentation of a friendly kind to America, if we can get France _and_\r\nRussia to join.” A day or two later (Aug. 3) he writes to the Duke of\r\nArgyll: “My _opinion_ is that it is vain, and wholly unsustained by\r\nprecedent, to say nothing shall be done until both parties are desirous of\r\nit; that, however, we ought to avoid sole action, or anything except\r\nacting in such a combination as would morally represent the weight of\r\nimpartial Europe; that with this view we ought to communicate with France\r\nand Russia; to make with them a friendly representation (if they are ready\r\nto do it) of the mischief and the hopelessness of prolonging the contest\r\nin which both sides have made extraordinary and heroic efforts; but if\r\nthey are not ready, then to wait for some opportunity when they may be\r\ndisposed to move with us. The adhesion of other powers would be desirable\r\nif it does not encumber the movement.”\r\n\r\n“In the year 1862,” says Mr. Gladstone in a fragment of autobiography, “I\r\nhad emerged from very grave financial [budget] difficulties, which in 1860\r\nand 1861 went near to breaking me down. A blue sky was now above me, and\r\nsome of the Northern liberals devised for me a triumphant visit to the\r\nTyne, which of course entailed as one of its incidents a public dinner.”\r\nSeeing a visit to Newcastle announced, Lord Palmerston wrote (Sept. 24) to\r\nMr. Gladstone, begging him on no account to let the chancellor of the\r\nexchequer be too sympathetic with the tax-payer, or to tell the country\r\nthat it was spending more money than it could afford. A more important\r\npart of the letter was to inform Mr. Gladstone that he himself and Lord\r\nRussell thought the time was fast approaching when an offer of mediation\r\nought to be made by England, France, and Russia, and that Russell was\r\ngoing privately to instruct the ambassador at Paris to sound the French\r\ngovernment. “Of course,” Lord Palmerston said, “no actual step would be\r\ntaken without the sanction of the cabinet. But if I am not mistaken, you\r\nwould be inclined to approve such a course.” The proposal would be made to\r\nboth North and South. If both should accept, an armistice would follow,\r\nand negotiations on the basis of separation. If both should decline, then\r\nLord Palmerston assumed that they would acknowledge the independence of\r\nthe South. The next day Mr. Gladstone replied. He was glad to learn what\r\nthe prime minister had told him, and for two reasons especially he desired\r\nthat the proceedings should be prompt. The first was the rapid progress of\r\nthe Southern arms and the extension of the area of Southern feeling. The\r\nsecond was the risk of violent impatience in the cotton-towns of\r\nLancashire, such as would prejudice the dignity and disinterestedness of\r\nthe proffered mediation.(54) On September 17 Russell had replied to a\r\nletter from Palmerston three days earlier, saying explicitly, “I agree\r\nwith you that the time is come for offering mediation to the United States\r\ngovernment, with a view to the recognition of the independence of the\r\nConfederates. I agree further, that in case of failure, we ought ourselves\r\nto recognise the Southern states as an independent state.”(55) So far,\r\nthen, had the two heads of the government advanced, when Mr. Gladstone\r\nwent to Newcastle.\r\n\r\n(M27) The people of the Tyne gave him the reception of a king. The prints\r\nof the time tell how the bells rang, guns thundered, a great procession of\r\nsteamers followed him to the mouth of the river, ships flew their gayest\r\nbunting, the banks were thronged with hosts of the black-handed toilers of\r\nthe forges, the furnaces, the coal-staiths, chemical works, glass\r\nfactories, shipyards, eager to catch a glimpse of the great man; and all\r\nthis not because he had tripled the exports to France, but because a sure\r\ninstinct had revealed an accent in his eloquence that spoke of feeling for\r\nthe common people.(56)\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 7, 1862._—Reflected further on what I should say about\r\n    Lancashire and America, for both these subjects are critical....\r\n    At two we went to Newcastle and saw the principal objects,\r\n    including especially the fine church and lantern, the gem of an\r\n    old castle, and Grey Street—I think our best modern street. The\r\n    photographer also laid hands on me. At six we went to a crowded\r\n    and enthusiastic dinner of near 500. I was obliged to make a long\r\n    oration which was admirably borne. The hall is not very easy to\r\n    fill with the voice, but quite practicable. 8.—Reached Gateshead\r\n    at 12, and after an address and reply, embarked in the midst of a\r\n    most striking scene which was prolonged and heightened as we went\r\n    down the river at the head of a fleet of some 25 steamers, amidst\r\n    the roar of guns and the banks lined or dotted above and below\r\n    with multitudes of people. The expedition lasted six hours, and I\r\n    had as many speeches as hours. Such a pomp I shall probably never\r\n    again witness; circumstances have brought upon me what I do not in\r\n    any way deserve.... The spectacle was really one for Turner, no\r\n    one else. 9.—Off to Sunderland. Here we had a similar reception\r\n    and a progress through the town and over the docks and harbour\r\n    works. I had to address the naval men, and then came a large\r\n    meeting in the hall. Thence by rail to Middlesborough. At\r\n    Darlington we were met by Lord Zetland, the mayor, and others.\r\n    Middlesborough was as warm or even warmer. Another progress and\r\n    steamboat procession and incessant flood of information respecting\r\n    this curious place. The labour, however, is too much; giddiness\r\n    came over me for a moment while I spoke at Sunderland, and I had\r\n    to take hold of the table. At Middlesborough we had an address and\r\n    reply in the town hall, then a public dinner, and we ended a day\r\n    of over fifteen hours at Upleatham before midnight. C. again\r\n    holding out, and indeed she is a great part of the whole business\r\n    with the people everywhere. I ought to be thankful, still more\r\n    ought I to be ashamed. It was vain to think of reading, writing,\r\n    or much reflecting on such a day. I was most happy to lie down for\r\n    fifteen minutes at Mr. Vaughan’s in Middlesborough. 11.—Off at 8\r\n    A.M. to take the rail at Guisbro. At Middlesborough many friends\r\n    had gathered at the station to give us a parting cheer. We came on\r\n    to York, went at once to the mansion-house, and then visited the\r\n    minister. At two came the “luncheon,” and I had to address another\r\n    kind of audience.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnhappily, the slave must still go in the triumphal car to remind us of\r\nthe fallibilities of men, and here the conqueror made a grave mistake. At\r\nthe banquet in the town hall of Newcastle (Oct. 7), with which all these\r\njoyous proceedings had begun, Mr. Gladstone let fall a sentence about the\r\nAmerican war of which he was destined never to hear the last: “We know\r\nquite well that the people of the Northern states have not yet drunk of\r\nthe cup—they are still trying to hold it far from their lips—which all the\r\nrest of the world see they nevertheless must drink of. We may have our own\r\nopinions about slavery; we may be for or against the South; but there is\r\nno doubt that Jefferson Davis and other leaders of the South have made an\r\narmy; they are making, it appears, a navy; and they have made what is more\r\nthan either, they have made a nation.”\r\n\r\nHere the speaker was forgetful of a wholesome saying of his own, that “a\r\nman who speaks in public ought to know, besides his own meaning, the\r\nmeaning which others will attach to his words.” The sensation was\r\nimmediate and profound. All the world took so pointed an utterance to mean\r\nthat the government were about to recognise the independence of the South.\r\nThe cotton men were thrown into a position of doubt and uncertainty that\r\nstill further disturbed their trade. Orders for cotton were countermanded,\r\nand the supply of the precious material for a moment threatened to become\r\nworse than ever. Cobden and Bright were twitted with the lapse of their\r\nfavourite from a central article of their own creed and commandments.\r\nLouis Blanc, then in exile here, describing the feeling of the country,\r\ncompares the sympathy for the North to a dam and the sympathy for the\r\nSouth to a torrent, and says he fears that Gladstone at Newcastle had\r\nyielded to the temptation of courting popularity.(57) The American\r\nminister dropped a hint about passports.(58)\r\n\r\nTo the numerous correspondents who complained of his language Mr.\r\nGladstone framed a form of reply, disclaiming responsibility for all the\r\nvarious inferences that people chose to draw from his language. “And\r\ngenerally,” his secretary concluded, in phrases that justly provoked plain\r\nmen to wrath, “Mr. Gladstone desires me to remark that to form opinions\r\nupon questions of policy, to announce them to the world, and to take or to\r\nbe a party to taking any of the steps necessary for giving them effect,\r\nare matters which, though connected together, are in themselves distinct,\r\nand which may be separated by intervals of time longer or shorter\r\naccording to the particular circumstances of the case.”(59) Mr. Gladstone\r\nsent a copy of this enigmatical response to the foreign secretary, who was\r\nfar too acute not to perceive all the mischief and the peril, but had his\r\nfull share of that generosity of our public life that prevents a minister\r\nfrom bearing too hardly on a colleague who has got the boat and its crew\r\ninto a scrape. Lord Russell replied from Walmer (Oct. 20): “I have\r\nforwarded to your private secretary your very proper answer to your very\r\nimpertinent correspondent. Still, you must allow me to say that I think\r\nyou went beyond the latitude which all speakers must be allowed, when you\r\nsaid that Jeff. Davis had made a nation. Recognition would seem to follow,\r\nand for that step I think the cabinet is not prepared. However, we shall\r\nsoon meet to discuss this very topic.” A week after the deliverance at\r\nNewcastle, Lewis, at Lord Palmerston’s request as I have heard, put things\r\nright in a speech at Hereford. The Southern states, he said, had not _de\r\nfacto_ established their independence and were not entitled to recognition\r\non any accepted principles of public law.\r\n\r\n(M28) It is superfluous for any of us at this day to pass judgment. Mr.\r\nGladstone has left on record in a fragmentary note of late date his own\r\nestimate of an error that was in truth serious enough, and that has since\r\nbeen most of all exaggerated by those sections of society and opinion who\r\nat the time most eagerly and freely shared the very same delusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have yet to record, he writes (July 1896) in the fragment\r\n    already more than once mentioned, an undoubted error, the most\r\n    singular and palpable, I may add the least excusable of them all,\r\n    especially since it was committed so late as in the year 1862,\r\n    when I had outlived half a century. In the autumn of that year,\r\n    and in a speech delivered after a public dinner at\r\n    Newcastle-upon-Tyne, I declared in the heat of the American\r\n    struggle that Jefferson Davis had made a nation, that is to say,\r\n    that the division of the American Republic by the establishment of\r\n    a Southern or secession state was an accomplished fact. Strange to\r\n    say, this declaration, most unwarrantable to be made by a minister\r\n    of the crown with no authority other than his own, was not due to\r\n    any feeling of partizanship for the South or hostility to the\r\n    North. The fortunes of the South were at their zenith. Many who\r\n    wished well to the Northern cause despaired of its success. The\r\n    friends of the North in England were beginning to advise that it\r\n    should give way, for the avoidance of further bloodshed and\r\n    greater calamity. I weakly supposed that the time had come when\r\n    respectful suggestions of this kind, founded on the necessity of\r\n    the case, were required by a spirit of that friendship which, in\r\n    so many contingencies of life, has to offer sound recommendations\r\n    with a knowledge that they will not be popular. Not only was this\r\n    a misjudgment of the case, but even if it had been otherwise, I\r\n    was not the person to make the declaration. I really, though most\r\n    strangely, believed that it was an act of friendliness to all\r\n    America to recognise that the struggle was virtually at an end. I\r\n    was not one of those who on the ground of British interests\r\n    desired a division of the American Union. My view was distinctly\r\n    opposite. I thought that while the Union continued it never could\r\n    exercise any dangerous pressure upon Canada to estrange it from\r\n    the empire—our honour, as I thought, rather than our interest\r\n    forbidding its surrender. But were the Union split, the North, no\r\n    longer checked by the jealousies of slave-power, would seek a\r\n    partial compensation for its loss in annexing, or trying to annex,\r\n    British North America. Lord Palmerston desired the severance as a\r\n    diminution of a dangerous power, but prudently held his tongue.\r\n\r\n    That my opinion was founded upon a false estimate of the facts was\r\n    the very least part of my fault. I did not perceive the gross\r\n    impropriety of such an utterance from a cabinet minister, of a\r\n    power allied in blood and language, and bound to loyal neutrality;\r\n    the case being further exaggerated by the fact that we were\r\n    already, so to speak, under indictment before the world for not\r\n    (as was alleged) having strictly enforced the laws of neutrality\r\n    in the matter of the cruisers. My offence was indeed only a\r\n    mistake, but one of incredible grossness, and with such\r\n    consequences of offence and alarm attached to it, that my failing\r\n    to perceive them justly exposed me to very severe blame. It\r\n    illustrates vividly that incapacity which my mind so long\r\n    retained, and perhaps still exhibits, an incapacity of viewing\r\n    subjects all round, in their extraneous as well as in their\r\n    internal properties, and thereby of knowing when to be silent and\r\n    when to speak.\r\n\r\n    I am the more pained and grieved, because I have for the last\r\n    five-and-twenty years received from the government and people of\r\n    America tokens of goodwill which could not fail to arouse my\r\n    undying gratitude. When we came to the arbitration at Geneva, my\r\n    words were cited as part of the proof of hostile _animus_.\r\n    Meantime I had prepared a lengthened statement to show from my\r\n    abundant declarations on other occasions that there was and could\r\n    be on my part no such _animus_. I was desirous to present this\r\n    statement to the arbitrators. My colleagues objected so largely to\r\n    the proceeding that I desisted. In this I think they probably were\r\n    wrong. I addressed my paper to the American minister for the\r\n    information of his government, and Mr. Secretary Fish gave me, so\r\n    far as intention was concerned, a very handsome acquittal.\r\n\r\n    And strange to say,_post hoc_ though, perhaps not _propter hoc_,\r\n    the United States have been that country of the world in which the\r\n    most signal marks of public honour have been paid me, and in which\r\n    my name has been the most popular, the only parallels being Italy,\r\n    Greece, and the Balkan Peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many calumnies poured upon him in this connection was the charge\r\nthat he had been a subscriber to the Confederate Loan. “The statement,” he\r\nwrote to a correspondent (Oct. 17, 1865), “is not only untrue, but it is\r\nso entirely void of the slightest shadow of support in any imaginable\r\nincident of the case, that I am hardly able to ascribe it to mere error,\r\nand am painfully perplexed as to the motives which could have prompted so\r\nmischievous a forgery.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, the American minister had hinted at passports. Ten\r\ndays after Mr. Gladstone’s speech Mr. Adams saw Lord Russell. Having\r\nmentioned some minor matters he came to the real object of the interview.\r\n“If I had trusted,” he said, “to the construction given by the public to a\r\nlate speech, I should have begun to think of packing my carpet bag and\r\ntrunks. His lordship at once embraced the allusion, and whilst\r\nendeavouring to excuse Mr. Gladstone, in fact admitted that his act had\r\nbeen regretted by Lord Palmerston and the other cabinet officers. Still he\r\ncould not disavow the sentiments of Mr. Gladstone; so far as he understood\r\nthem (his meaning) was not that ascribed to him by the public. Mr.\r\nGladstone was himself willing to disclaim that. He had written to that\r\neffect to Lord Palmerston.... His lordship said that the policy of the\r\ngovernment was to adhere to a strict neutrality, and to leave this\r\nstruggle to settle itself.... I asked him if I was to understand that\r\npolicy as not now to be changed. He said, Yes.”(60)\r\n\r\nIf this relation be accurate, then the foreign secretary did not construe\r\nstrict neutrality as excluding what diplomatists call good offices. On\r\nOctober 13, Lord Russell circulated a memorandum to the cabinet setting\r\nout in an argumentative tone all the adverse and confused aspects of the\r\nsituation and outlook in America, and ending in the emphatic conclusion\r\nthat it had now become a question for the great Powers of Europe whether\r\nit was not their duty to ask both parties to agree to a suspension of arms\r\nfor the purpose of weighing calmly the advantages of peace. Cornewall\r\nLewis (Oct. 17), while expressing an opinion that a peaceful separation\r\nbetween North and South would in the end have been best for the North, and\r\nwhile apparently believing that the war must one day end in Southern\r\nindependence, met Russell’s suggestion by cogent arguments against action\r\non our part.(61) A week later (Oct. 24), Mr. Gladstone circulated a\r\nrejoinder to Lewis, arguing for representation to the two combatants from\r\nEngland, France, and Russia—a representation with moral authority and\r\nforce, of the opinion of the civilised world upon the conditions of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n(M29) This pretty nearly concludes all that need be said upon the attitude\r\ntaken by Mr. Gladstone in that mighty struggle. We may at least add that\r\nif, and where, it differed from that of the majority of his countrymen, it\r\ndid not differ for the worse. In November (1862) the French Emperor\r\nrenewed proposals of joint mediation. The Emperor had objects of his own\r\nto serve. He was entangled in the coils of the Mexican adventure that was\r\nto give the first shock to his throne and to add another to the long\r\nscroll of tragedies in the house of Hapsburg. From the first the\r\ngovernment of the American Union had scowled upon the intervention of\r\nEurope in the affairs of Mexico, just as the same government had refused\r\nto intervene in a European protest on behalf of Poland. The civil war\r\nbetween North and South kept American hands tied, and Napoleon well knew\r\nthat the success of the North and the consolidation of the Union would\r\noverthrow his designs in Mexico. He cast restlessly about for any\r\ncombination that promised aid to the Southern confederates, who, whether\r\nthey should emerge strong or weak from the struggle, would be a useful\r\ninstrument for his future purposes. So now he pressed England and Russia\r\nto join him in a project of mediation. Russia declined. The London cabinet\r\nwas divided.(62) Mr. Gladstone writes home in these important days.—“_Nov.\r\n11._ We have had our cabinet to-day and meet again to-morrow. I am afraid\r\nwe shall do little or nothing in the business of America. But I will send\r\nyou definite intelligence. Both Lords Palmerston and Russell are\r\n_right_.—_Nov. 12._ The United States affair has ended and not well. Lord\r\nRussell rather turned tail. He gave way without resolutely fighting out\r\nhis battle. However, though we decline for the moment, the answer is put\r\nupon grounds and in terms which leave the matter very open for the\r\nfuture.—_Nov. 13._ I think the French will make our answer about America\r\npublic; at least it is very possible. But I hope they may not take it as a\r\npositive refusal, or at any rate that they may themselves act in the\r\nmatter. It will be clear that we concur with them, that the war should\r\ncease. Palmerston gave to Russell’s proposal a feeble and half-hearted\r\nsupport. As to the state of matters generally in the cabinet, I have never\r\nseen it smoother; and they look pretty well, I think, as regards my\r\ndepartment, though the distress tells upon me.”\r\n\r\nThe only speech, I believe, delivered by Mr. Gladstone upon the war in\r\nparliament, while resisting the motion for the recognition of the\r\nconfederacy, was curiously balanced.(63) As to the South, he said, not a\r\nfew must sympathise with a resistance as heroic as ever was offered in the\r\nhistory of the world on the part of a weaker body against the overpowering\r\nforces of a stronger. On the other hand, the cause of the South was so\r\nconnected with slavery that a strong counter-current of feeling must arise\r\nin the mind. Then again, it is impossible for any Englishman not to have a\r\nvery strong feeling of sympathy with those in the North who saw exalted\r\nvisions of the great future of their country, now threatened with\r\ndestruction. He had never agreed with those who thought it a matter of\r\nhigh British interest that the old American union should be torn in\r\npieces. He had always thought that, involved as England was both in\r\ninterest and in duty and honour with Canada, the balanced state of the\r\nAmerican union which caused the whole of American politics to turn on the\r\nrelative strength of the slavery and Northern interests, was more\r\nfavourable to our colonial relations in North America, than if the said\r\nunion were to be divided into a cluster of Northern and a cluster of\r\nSouthern states. The North would endeavour to re-establish their\r\nterritorial grandeur by seeking union with the British possessions in\r\nNorth America. He dwelt upon the horrid incidents of war. He insisted once\r\nmore that the public opinion of this country was unanimous that the\r\nrestoration of the American union by force was unattainable. Some cries of\r\n“No” greeted this declaration about unanimity, but he would not qualify it\r\nfurther than to say that at any rate it was almost unanimous. The other\r\nchief speakers that night were Mr. Forster (who played a brave and\r\nclear-sighted part throughout), Lord Robert Cecil, who attacked the “vague\r\nand loose” arguments of the chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr. Bright,\r\nwho made perhaps the most powerful and the noblest speech of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI. Death Of Friends—Days At Balmoral. (1861-1884)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Itaque veræ amicitiæ difficillime reperiuntur in iis qui in\r\n    honoribus reque publica versantur.—CICERO.\r\n\r\n    True friendships are hard to find among men who busy themselves\r\n    about politics and office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin a few months of one another, three of Mr. Gladstone’s closest\r\nfriends and allies were lost to him. Lord Aberdeen died at the end of\r\n1860. The letter written by Mr. Gladstone to the son of his veteran chief\r\nis long, but it deserves reproduction.(64) As a writer, though an alert\r\nand most strenuous disputant, he was apt to be diffuse and abstract.\r\nPartly, these defects were due to the subjects with which, in his literary\r\nperformances, he mostly chose to deal. Perhaps one secret was that he\r\nforgot the famous word of Quintilian, that the way to write well is not to\r\nwrite quickly, but if you take trouble to write well, in time you can\r\nwrite as quickly as you like.(65) His character of Lord Aberdeen, like his\r\nbeautiful letter in a similar vein about Hope-Scott,(66) where also his\r\nfeelings were deeply moved, is very different from his more formal manner,\r\nand may claim high place among our literary portraits. It is penetrating\r\nin analysis, admirable in diction, rich in experience of life and human\r\nnature, and truly inspiring in those noble moralities that are the\r\nlifeblood of style, and of greater things than mere style can ever be.\r\n\r\nThen, in the autumn of 1861, both Graham and Sidney Herbert died; the\r\nformer the most esteemed and valued of all his counsellors; the latter, so\r\nprematurely cut off, “that beautiful and sunny spirit,” as he called him,\r\nperhaps the best beloved of all his friends. “Called on Gladstone,” says\r\nPhillimore on this last occasion (Aug. 3); “found him at breakfast alone;\r\nvery glad to see me. His eyes filled with tears all the time he spoke to\r\nme in a broken voice about his departed friend. The effect upon him has\r\nbeen very striking, increased no doubt by recent political differences of\r\nopinion.” “It is difficult to speak of Herbert,” Mr. Gladstone said later,\r\n“because with that singular harmony and singular variety of gifts—every\r\ngift of person, every gift of position, every gift of character with which\r\nit pleased Providence to bless him—he was one of whom we may well recite\r\nwords that the great poet of this country has applied to a prince of our\r\nearly history, cut off by death earlier than his countrymen would have\r\ndesired:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,\r\n    Framed in the prodigality of nature,\r\n    The spacious world cannot again afford.”(67)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe void thus left was never filled. Of Graham he wrote to the Duchess of\r\nSutherland:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 26._—This most sad and unexpected news from Netherby rises\r\n    up between me and your letter, I have lost a friend whom I seem to\r\n    appreciate the more because the world appreciated him so\r\n    inadequately; his intellectual force could not be denied, but I\r\n    have never known a person who had such signal virtues that were so\r\n    little understood. The remainder of my political career be it what\r\n    it may (and I trust not over long) will be passed in the House of\r\n    Commons without one old friend who is _both_ political and\r\n    personal. This is the gradual withdrawal of the props preparing\r\n    for what is to follow. Let me not, however, seem to complain, for\r\n    never, I believe, was any one blessed so entirely beyond his\r\n    deserts in the especial and capital article of friendships.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot many months later (June 1862) he had to write to Mr. Gordon, “We are\r\nall sorely smitten by Canning’s death,” whose fame, he said, would “bear\r\nthe scrutinising judgment of posterity, under whose keen eye so many\r\nillusions are doomed to fade away.”(68)\r\n\r\n(M30) In the December of 1861 died the Prince Consort. His last\r\ncommunication to Mr. Gladstone was a letter (Nov. 19) proposing to\r\nrecommend him as an elder brother of the Trinity House in place of Graham.\r\nOf Mr. Gladstone’s first interview with the Queen after her bereavement,\r\nDean Wellesley wrote to him that she was greatly touched by his evidence\r\nof sympathy. “She saw how much you felt for her, and the mind of a person\r\nin such deep affliction is keenly sensitive and observant. Of all her\r\nministers, she seemed to me to think that you had most entered into her\r\nsorrows, and she dwelt especially upon the manner in which you had parted\r\nfrom her.” To the Duchess of Sutherland Mr. Gladstone writes:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _March 20, 1862._—I find I must go out at four exactly. In any\r\n    case I do not like to trust to chance your knowing or not knowing\r\n    what befell me yesterday. Your advice was excellent. I was really\r\n    bewildered, but that all vanished when the Queen came in and kept\r\n    my hand a moment. All was beautiful, simple, noble, touching to\r\n    the very last degree. It was a meeting, for me, to be remembered.\r\n    I need only report the first and last words of the personal part\r\n    of the conversation. The first (after a quarter of an hour upon\r\n    affairs) was (putting down her head and struggling) “the nation\r\n    has been very good to me in my time of sorrow”; and the last, “I\r\n    earnestly pray it may be long before you are parted from one\r\n    another.”(69)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring he took occasion at Manchester to pronounce a fine panegyric\r\non the Prince,(70) for which the Queen thanked him in a letter of\r\npassionate desolation, too sacred in the anguish of its emotion to be\r\nprinted here. “Every source of interest or pleasure,” she concludes,\r\n“causes now the acutest pain. Mrs. Gladstone, who, the Queen knows, is a\r\nmost tender wife, may in a faint manner picture to herself what the Queen\r\nsuffers.” Mr. Gladstone replies:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It may not be impertinent in him to assure your Majesty that all\r\n    the words to which your Majesty refers were received with deep\r\n    emotion by the whole of a very large assembly, who appeared to\r\n    feel both your Majesty’s too conspicuous affliction, and the\r\n    solemnity of its relation to the severe and, alas! darkening\r\n    circumstances of the district.(71)\r\n\r\n    In presuming to touch upon that relation, and in following the\r\n    direction which his subject gave him towards very sacred ground,\r\n    he was especially desirous to avoid using even a phrase or a word\r\n    of exaggeration, and likewise to speak only as one who had seen\r\n    your Majesty’s great sorrow in no other way than as all your\r\n    Majesty’s subjects beheld it.\r\n\r\n    In speaking thus he knew that he must fall short of the truth; and\r\n    indeed, even were it becoming to make the attempt, he would in\r\n    vain labour to convey the impression made upon his mind by the\r\n    interview to which he was admitted at Windsor, and by the letter\r\n    now in his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore follows in the vein and on the topics that are usual in letters of\r\nmourning sympathy, and the effect was what the writer sought. From\r\nBalmoral came a note (May 6, 1862): “The Queen wishes Princess Alice to\r\nthank Mr. Gladstone in her name for the kind letter he wrote to her the\r\nother day, which did her aching heart good. Kind words soothe, but nothing\r\ncan lessen or alleviate the weight of sorrow she has to bear.”\r\n\r\nMany years later he sat down to place on record his thoughts about the\r\nPrince Consort, but did not proceed beyond a scanty fragment, which I will\r\nhere transcribe:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    My praise will be impartial: for he did not fascinate, or command,\r\n    or attract me through any medium but that of judgment and\r\n    conscience. There was, I think, a want of freedom, nature, and\r\n    movement in his demeanour, due partly to a faculty and habit of\r\n    reflection that never intermitted, partly to an inexorable\r\n    watchfulness over all he did and said, which produced something\r\n    that was related to stillness and dullness in a manner which was\r\n    notwithstanding, invariably modest, frank, and kind, even to one\r\n    who had no claims upon him for the particular exhibition of such\r\n    qualities. Perhaps I had better first disburden myself of what I\r\n    have to set down against him. I do not think he was a man without\r\n    prejudices, and this particularly in religion. His views of the\r\n    church of Rome must, I think, have been illiberal. At any rate, I\r\n    well remember a conversation with him at Windsor respecting the\r\n    papal decree imposing the belief in the immaculate conception,\r\n    somewhere about the time when it came forth. He said he was glad\r\n    of it, as it would tend to expose and explode the whole system. I\r\n    contended, with a freedom which he always seemed to encourage,\r\n    that we all had an interest in the well being and well doing,\r\n    absolute or relative, of that great Christian communion, and that\r\n    whatever indicated or increased the predominance of the worse\r\n    influences within her pale over the better was a thing we ought\r\n    much to deplore. No assent, even qualified, was to be got.(72)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of the Prince Consort was a greater personal calamity to Mr.\r\nGladstone than he could then foresee. Perhaps the disadvantage was almost\r\nas real as the death of the consort of King George II. to Sir Robert\r\nWalpole. Much as they might differ in political and religious opinion, yet\r\nin seriousness, conscience, and laborious temperament, the Prince and he\r\nwere in exact accord, and it is impossible to doubt that if the Prince had\r\nsurvived at the Queen’s right hand, certain jars might have been avoided\r\nthat made many difficulties for the minister in later times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nI may as well here gather into a chapter some short pieces, mainly from\r\nletters to Mrs. Gladstone during the period covered by this fifth book.\r\nThe most interesting of them, perhaps, are the little pictures of his life\r\nas minister in attendance at Balmoral; but there are, besides, two or\r\nthree hints of a simplicity in his faculty of enjoyment in regions outside\r\nof graver things, that may shock critics of more complex or fastidious\r\njudgment. Readers will benevolently take them all as they come. He made a\r\ncurious entry in his diary upon his birthday at the end of 1860: “_’Dec.\r\n29._ Began my fifty-second year. I cannot believe it. I feel within me the\r\nrebellious unspoken word, I will not be old. The horizon enlarges, the sky\r\nshifts, around me. It is an age of shocks; a discipline so strong, so\r\nmanifold, so rapid and whirling that only when it is at an end, if then,\r\ncan I hope to comprehend it.” Yet nearly all the most conspicuous scenes\r\nstill lay before him.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _October 18, 1860._—I did not get to the play last night from\r\n    finding _The Woman in White_ so very interesting. It has no dull\r\n    parts, and is far better sustained than _Adam Bede_, though I do\r\n    not know if it rises quite as high. The character drawing is\r\n    excellent.\r\n\r\n    _Downing Street, Dec. 15._—The chancellor says (keep this from\r\n    view) that Prince Albert said to him at Windsor: “We Germans have\r\n    no boundaries; our only boundary is the Quadrilateral,” _i.e._\r\n    fortress in the heart of Italy. This, I fear, must be true, and,\r\n    if so, is sad enough, because he evidently spoke his mind out\r\n    unsuspiciously.\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 18._—I actually went last night five mortal miles to Hoxton\r\n    to see “Eily O’Connor,” the Colleen Bawn in another shape! It was\r\n    not without interest, though very inferior, and imitated in some\r\n    cases with a ludicrous closeness. The theatre is a poor working\r\n    man’s theatre. I paid 1s. for a very aristocratic place. To-night\r\n    I am going with Phillimore to the Westminster play, a Latin one,\r\n    which I am afraid is rather long.\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 18, 1861._—I write a few lines to you in the train, near\r\n    Harrow. We shall not be in till four; all safe; and immense care\r\n    evidently taken on account of the frost, though I do not feel it\r\n    much in the air. I have had other matters to keep me warm. Among\r\n    the letters given me this morning at Hawarden was one from Lord\r\n    John, in which he quietly informs me that since the cabinet\r\n    separated _he_ has agreed to guarantee a loan, and for Morocco!\r\n    This I mean to resist, and have managed to write a letter in the\r\n    carriage to tell him so. What will come of it, I do not know. It\r\n    is a very serious affair. I am afraid he has committed himself\r\n    egregiously. I am very bad now; but what _shall_ I be at\r\n    sixty-eight?\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 19._—Indeed, this is a strange world. Yesterday it seemed\r\n    Lord J. Russell might go out, or more likely I might, or even the\r\n    cabinet might go to pieces. To-day he writes to me that he\r\n    supposes he must find a way out of his proposal! So that is over.\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 23._—You seem to have taken great pains about stable\r\n    affairs, and I am quite satisfied. The truth indeed, alas, is, I\r\n    am not fit at this critical time to give any thought to such\r\n    matters. The embarrassment of our vast public expenditure,\r\n    together with the ill effects of the bad harvest, are so thick\r\n    upon me, together with the arrangements for next year and the\r\n    preparation of my own bills for improvements, which, though a\r\n    laborious, are a healthy and delightful part of my work.\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 24._—I expect Argyll to share my mutton to-night, and we\r\n    shall, I dare say, have a comfortable talk. Last night I saw\r\n    Herbert. I think he looks much better. He did not open the subject\r\n    of estimates, nor did I, before _her_, but I told him what I am\r\n    sorry to say is true, that the prospects of revenue grow much\r\n    worse. Up to a certain point, I must certainly make a stand. But I\r\n    think he is rather frightened about expenditure, and not so\r\n    panic-stricken about France; so that we may come together.\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 25._—I write from the cabinet. I am in the midst of a deadly\r\n    struggle about the estimates; the only comfort this year is, that\r\n    I think the conflict will be more with the navy than the army.\r\n    Herbert has told me to-day, with a simplicity and absence of\r\n    egotism, which one could not but remark in his graceful character,\r\n    the nature of his complaint. You will quickly guess. As to\r\n    cabinets, Lord John says we had better meet frequently, and it\r\n    will be on Tuesday _if_ I am able to come down next week, but this\r\n    is full of uncertainty. I hear that the Prince is _wild_ about the\r\n    Danish question.\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 26._—Another cabinet on Monday. It is just possible they may\r\n    relax after that day. I have had two long days of hard fighting.\r\n    By dint of what, after all, might be called threat of resignation,\r\n    I have got the navy estimates a little down, and I am now _in_ the\r\n    battle about the army. About the reduction in the navy, Palmerston\r\n    criticised, Lord John protested, and Cardwell! I think went\r\n    farther than either. Never on any single occasion since this\r\n    government was formed has his voice been raised in the cabinet for\r\n    economy. What a misfortune it is that Herbert has no nerve to\r\n    speak out even in a private conversation. He told me yesterday of\r\n    his reduction, but did not tell me that more than half of it was\r\n    purely nominal! The article in the _Quarterly_ is clever; and what\r\n    it says, moreover, on the merits of the income-tax is true. I\r\n    suspect, I might say I fear, it is written by Northcote.\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 5._—Yesterday, in the carriage from Kidderminster, I heard\r\n    in part a dialogue, of which I gathered so much. _First worthy_,\r\n    “I suppose we shall have to pay twopence or threepence more\r\n    income-tax.” _Second worthy_, “Gladstone seems to be a totally\r\n    incompetent man.” _Third_, “Then he always wraps himself in such\r\n    mystery. But now I do not see what else he can do; he has cut away\r\n    the ground from under his feet”—with a growl about the\r\n    conservative party. Such is the public opinion of Worcestershire\r\n    beyond all doubt.\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, May 24._—The house looks cleanliness itself, and\r\n    altogether being down here in the fresh air, and seeing nature all\r\n    round me so busy with her work so beneficent and beautiful, makes\r\n    me very sick of London and its wrathful politics, and wish that we\r\n    were all here, or hereabouts once more.\r\n\r\n    _July 20._—The political storm has blown over, but I do not think\r\n    it seems an evening for riding to Holly House, nor can I honestly\r\n    say that a party there would be a relaxation for my weary bones,\r\n    and wearier nerves and brain.\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 4._—I have been at All Saints this morning. Though London is\r\n    empty, as they say, it was absolutely crammed. Richards preached\r\n    an excellent sermon. But I certainly should not wish to be an\r\n    habitual attendant there. The intention of the service is most\r\n    devout, but I am far from liking wholly the mode of execution. My\r\n    neighbour in church whispered to me, “Is the Bishop of London’s\r\n    jurisdiction acknowledged here?” I think he seemed to wish it\r\n    should not be.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 22._—Tell Harry [his son] he is right, Latin is difficult,\r\n    and it is in great part because it is difficult that it is useful.\r\n    Suppose lie wanted to make himself a good jumper; how would he do\r\n    it? By trying _first_, indeed, what was easy, but after that\r\n    always what was difficult enough to make him exert himself to the\r\n    uttermost. If he kept to the easy jumps, he would never improve.\r\n    But the jumps that are at first difficult by and bye become easy.\r\n    So the Latin lessons, which he now finds difficult, he will find\r\n    easy when once his mind has been improved and strengthened by\r\n    those very lessons. See if he understands this.\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 29._—The strangest feeling of all in me is a rebellion (I\r\n    know not what else to call it) against growing old.\r\n\r\n    _Cliveden, Maidenhead, Jan. 14, 1862._—I have written to John [his\r\n    brother], and if he is in town I shall go up and see him tomorrow.\r\n    Meantime I have mentioned Locock, as recommended by you. I fear\r\n    the dark cloud is slowly gathering over him [his wife’s illness],\r\n    as we have seen it lately gather over so many and then break. I am\r\n    amazed at the mercy of God towards us, and towards me in\r\n    particular. I think of all the children, and of their health in\r\n    body and in mind. It seems as if it could not last; but this is\r\n    all in God’s hand.\r\n\r\n    Here are the Argylls, Lady Blantyre and a heap of young. We have\r\n    been busy reading translations of Homer this morning, including\r\n    some of mine, which are approved. Tennyson has written most noble\r\n    lines on the Prince. Lord Palmerston is reported well.\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 18._—I lifted Hayward last night back from dinner. He is\r\n    full of the doctrine that Lord Palmerston is not to last another\r\n    year. Johnny is then to succeed, and I to lead (as he says by the\r\n    universal admission of the whigs) in the H. of C. It is rather\r\n    hard before the death thus to divide the inheritance. But that we\r\n    may not be too vain, it is attended with this further\r\n    announcement, that when that event occurs, the government is\r\n    shortly to break down.\r\n\r\n    _Cabinet Room, Feb. 1._—The cabinet has gone well.(73) It is\r\n    rather amusing. I am driving the screw; Lewis yields point by\r\n    point. I think in substance the question is ruled in my favour.\r\n    Thank God for the prospect of peace; but it will not positively be\r\n    settled till Monday. Lewis’s last dying speech, ’Well, we will see\r\n    what can be done.’\r\n\r\n    _Bowden, Wilts., Feb. 19._—The funeral is over [the wife of his\r\n    brother]. Nothing could be better ordered in point of taste and\r\n    feeling. It was one of the most touching, I think the most\r\n    touching, scene I ever witnessed, when the six daughters weeping\r\n    profusely knelt around the grave, and amidst their sobs and tears\r\n    just faltered out the petitions of the Lord’s Prayer in the\r\n    service. John, sensible of his duty of supporting others, went\r\n    through it all with great fortitude. On the whole, I must say I\r\n    can wish no more for any family, than that when the stroke of\r\n    bereavement comes, they meet it as it has been met here.\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 18._—I have sat an hour with Lord Lyndhurst. He is much\r\n    _older_ than when I saw him last, but still has pith and life in\r\n    him, as well as that astonishing freshness of mind which gives him\r\n    a charm in its way quite unrivalled. He was very kind, and what is\r\n    more, he showed, I think, a seriousness of tone which has been\r\n    missed before.\r\n\r\n    Last night I saw “Lord Dundreary.” I think it—the part and the\r\n    player, not the play—quite admirable. It is a thoroughly refined\r\n    piece of acting, such as we hardly ever see in England; and it\r\n    combines with refinement intense fun. My face became with laughing\r\n    like what Falstaff says he will make Prince Henry’s face, “like a\r\n    wet cloak ill laid up”(74) (_Phillimore_).\r\n\r\n    _Windsor Castle, Dec. 10._—Here I am with six candles blazing! of\r\n    which I shall put out a larger proportion when no longer afraid of\r\n    a visit from the great people about the passages. I got your\r\n    letter this morning, but I am amazed at your thinking I have the\r\n    pluck to ask the Princess of Wales! or the Queen!!! about\r\n    photographs promised or not promised.\r\n\r\n    In came the Dean; after that, a summons to the Queen, with whom I\r\n    have been an hour. She is well in health and in spirits, and when\r\n    she speaks of the Prince does it with a free, natural, and healthy\r\n    tone, that is most pleasing. I am to see the Prince of Wales after\r\n    dinner. I now therefore make sure of leaving to-morrow. The Queen\r\n    asked kindly about you, and I saw little Princess Beatrice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 31, 1863._—Walked 24-3/4 miles. Found it rather too much for\r\n    my stiffening limbs. My day of long stretches is, I think, gone\r\n    by.\r\n\r\n    _Balmoral, Sept. 26._—This place is on the whole very beautiful\r\n    and satisfactory; and Deeside at large has lost for me none of its\r\n    charms, with its black-green fir and grey rock, and its boundless\r\n    ranges of heather still almost in full bloom. The Queen spends a\r\n    good many hours out, and looks well, but older. I had a long\r\n    conversation or audience to-day, but as regards the form and mode\r\n    of life here, so far as I see, it does not differ for visitors\r\n    from Windsor. All meals and rooms are separate, but sometimes, it\r\n    appears, some are invited to dine with the Queen. The household\r\n    circle is smaller here than at Windsor, and so less formal and\r\n    dull. I doubt your doctrine about your message, but I will give it\r\n    if a good opportunity occurs. She talked very pleasantly and well\r\n    upon many matters public and other—(Do not go on reading this\r\n    aloud or give it to others). As to politics, she talked most of\r\n    America and Germany; also some Lancashire distress. She feels an\r\n    immense interest in Germany, her recollections of the Prince’s\r\n    sentiments being in that, as in other matters, a barometer to\r\n    govern her sympathies and affections. She said (when I hoped she\r\n    had received benefit from the air here) that she thought she had\r\n    been better in Germany than anywhere, though it was excessively\r\n    hot. She asked where I had been, and about our living at Hawarden,\r\n    and where it was. I told her I thought she had been there, at\r\n    least driving through from Eaton (was it not so?) when she was\r\n    Princess, and at last she seemed to remember it, and said it was\r\n    thirty-one years ago. Princess Alice has got a black boy here who\r\n    was given to her, and he produces a great sensation on the\r\n    Deeside, where the people never saw anything of the kind and\r\n    cannot conceive it. A woman, and an intelligent one, cried out in\r\n    amazement on seeing him, and said she would certainly have fallen\r\n    down but for the Queen’s presence. She said nothing would induce\r\n    her to wash his clothes _as the black would come off_! This story\r\n    the Queen told me in good spirits.\r\n\r\n    She said that some people after heavy bereavement disliked seeing\r\n    those whom they had known well before, and who reminded them of\r\n    what had been, but with her it was exactly the opposite; it was\r\n    the greatest effort and pain to her to see any one who had [not]\r\n    known _them_ before, and their mode of living. As an instance, she\r\n    said it cost her much to see the Emperor of Austria, whom the\r\n    Prince had never known. Evidently this clinging to things old will\r\n    form itself into a habit, but I am afraid it may hereafter, when\r\n    more have died off, be a matter of difficulty to her. It is\r\n    impossible to help seeing that she mistrusts Lord Russell’s\r\n    judgment in foreign affairs, indeed I have already had clear proof\r\n    of this. She likes Lord Palmerston’s better; thinks he looks very\r\n    old, and will not allow that it is all owing to an accident. But\r\n    dinner is drawing near, so good-bye. We have had a good day, and\r\n    have been up to the pyramid put on a hill-top as a memorial to the\r\n    Prince, with the beautiful inscription.\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 27._—I do not think Sunday is the best of days here. I in\r\n    vain inquired with care about episcopal services; there did not\r\n    seem to be one within fifteen miles, if indeed so near. We had\r\n    something between family prayer and a service in the dining-room\r\n    at ten; it lasted about forty minutes. Dr. Caird gave a short\r\n    discourse, good in material, though over florid in style for my\r\n    taste. The rest of the day I have had to myself. The Prince and\r\n    Princess of Hesse I think went to the parish church. You are\r\n    better off at Penmaenmawr.... I saw the two princes last night.\r\n    They were playing billiards. The Prince of Wales asked\r\n    particularly, as always, about you and Willy.\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 28._—I must be brief as I have been out riding with Sir C.\r\n    and Miss Phipps to Alt-na-Guisach (the Queen’s cottage), and came\r\n    in _late_. Be assured all is very comfortable and restful here. I\r\n    think too that I feel the air very invigorating, my room is\r\n    pleasant and cheerful on the ground floor, with a turret\r\n    dressing-room. ... I am pretty much master of my time. To-day I\r\n    have heard nothing of the Queen. Last evening I was summoned to\r\n    dine, as was Lady Churchill. It was extremely interesting. We were\r\n    but seven in all, and anything more beautifully domestic than the\r\n    Queen and her family it was impossible to conceive. The five were\r\n    her Majesty, Prince and Princess Louis, Prince Alfred, and\r\n    Princess Helena. Princess Louis (whom the Queen in speaking of\r\n    still calls Princess Alice) asked about you all. I had the\r\n    pleasure of hearing the good report of Lucy altogether confirmed\r\n    from her lips and _the Queen’s_. The Queen thinks her like her\r\n    dear mother. She talked about many things and persons; among\r\n    others the Lyttelton family, and asked about the boys _seriatim_,\r\n    but pulled me up at once when, in a fit of momentary oblivion, I\r\n    said the New Zealander was the third. She spoke of the chancellor\r\n    and of Roundell Palmer; I had a good opportunity of speaking him\r\n    _up_, and found she had his book of hymns. She spoke very freely\r\n    about the chancellor; and I heard from her that the\r\n    attorney-general resigns on the score of health—of course Palmer\r\n    succeeds. Prince Alfred is going to Edinburgh to study; he is a\r\n    smart fellow, and has plenty of go in him.\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 29._—I have just come in at 6-½ from a fine hill walk of\r\n    over three hours, quite ready for another were there light and\r\n    opportunity.\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 30._—I am come in from a nineteen mile walk to the Lake of\r\n    Lochnagar with Dr. Bekker, as fresh as a lark! Very wet. The Queen\r\n    sent me a message not to go up Lochnagar (top) if there was mist;\r\n    and mist there was, with rain to boot. I find the resemblance to\r\n    Snowdon rather striking. It is 3800 feet; we went up about 3300.\r\n    You forgot to tell me for what pious object you picked Lord P.’s\r\n    pocket. Nor do you distinctly tell me where to address, but as you\r\n    say three nights I suppose it should be Penmaenmawr. Last night we\r\n    went down to Abergeldie to the gillies’ ball. There was a dance\r\n    called the perpetual jig, nearly the best fun I ever witnessed.\r\n    The princes danced with great activity after deer-stalking, and\r\n    very well; Prince Alfred I thought beautifully. They were\r\n    immensely amused at having passed me on the way home and offered\r\n    me a lift, to which I replied (it was dark) thinking they were\r\n    General Grey and a household party. The Princess did not\r\n    dance—asked about you—is taking great care, and the Prince very\r\n    strict about it also. She does not ride or fatigue herself. The\r\n    event, according to Dr. Jenner, should take place in March or\r\n    early in April. You see his authority and yours are at variance.\r\n    The Queen was (according to Mrs. Bruce, who dined with her) very\r\n    low last night, on account of the ball, which naturally recalled\r\n    so much.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 3._—It happened oddly yesterday I was sent for while out. I\r\n    had had a message from the Queen in the morning which made me\r\n    think there would be no more, so I went out at a quarter past\r\n    three. I am very sorry this happened. I am to see her, I believe,\r\n    this evening.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 4._—The service at Ballater has made a great difference in\r\n    favour of this Sunday. It was celebrated in the Free Kirk\r\n    school-room for girls! and with a congregation under twenty, most\r\n    attentive though very small, and no one left the room when we came\r\n    to the Holy Communion. The Knollys family and people were one half\r\n    or so. I gave Mrs. Knollys and one daughter a lift in _my_ drag\r\n    back to Birkhall (2-½ miles which they all loyally walk to and\r\n    fro) and had luncheon there. I had Thomas with me. The sermon was\r\n    _extremely_ good; but the priest had a _few_ antics. I believe\r\n    this is about the first expedition ever made from Balmoral to an\r\n    episcopal service. Perhaps encouraged by my example, Captain W.\r\n    got a drag to Castleton this morning, being a Roman. There was\r\n    _no_ chaplain here to-day, and so no dining-room service, which\r\n    for many I fear means no service at all.\r\n\r\n    I dined with the Queen again last night; also Lady Augusta\r\n    Bruce—seven, again, in all. The Crown Princess had a headache, as\r\n    well she might, so they were not there. The same royalties as\r\n    before, and everything quite as pleasing. The Queen talked\r\n    Shakespeare, Scott, the use of the German language in England (and\r\n    there I could not speak out _all_ my mind), Guizot’s translation\r\n    of the Prince’s speeches, and his preface (which the Queen has\r\n    since sent me to look at), the children’s play at Windsor (when\r\n    Princess Alice acted a high priest, with great success—in\r\n    “Athalie,” I think), the Prussian children (the Queen says the\r\n    baby is not pretty—the little boy on coming yesterday called them\r\n    all stumpfnase, pugnose), handwritings, Lord Palmerston’s to wit,\r\n    Mr. Disraeli’s style in his letters to the Queen, the proper mode\r\n    of writing, on what paper, etc., and _great_ laudation of Lady\r\n    Lyttelton’s letters. Princess Alice declares her baby is pretty,\r\n    and says she shall show it me. The Queen was very cheerful, and\r\n    seemed for the time happy. A statue of the Prince is about to be\r\n    set up at Aberdeen, and she is then to attend and receive an\r\n    address, with Sir G. Grey present in due form. The household life\r\n    is really very agreeable when one comes to know them. One way and\r\n    another they have a great deal in them.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 5._—I have been riding to Invercauld House and up above it.\r\n    The beauty there even surpassed my high expectations, and made\r\n    everything here look quite pale in comparison. They were very\r\n    kind, and offered me deer-stalking; we drank tea and ate scones.\r\n\r\n    I have only time to tell you two things. First, the Queen is on\r\n    Friday to do her first public act, to attend at the ’inauguration’\r\n    of the statue of the Prince, and to receive an address. I am to be\r\n    there officially. I have telegraphed for my uniform. I go on to\r\n    Aberdeen and Trinity College at night, and on Saturday evening to\r\n    Edinburgh. There was fear that it might be on Saturday, and that I\r\n    should be kept, but this could not be, as Saturday is a ’fast’ for\r\n    the periodical sacrament on Sunday. I told you the Queen talked\r\n    about German on Saturday at dinner, among other things Schiller’s\r\n    and Coleridge’s _Wallenstein_. Next morning she sent me, through\r\n    Lady A. Bruce, the book, with a passage of which I have hastily\r\n    translated the most important part. It is easy to conceive how it\r\n    answers to her feelings.\r\n\r\n    “Too well I know the treasure I have lost.\r\n    From off my life the bloom is swept away;\r\n    It lies before me cold and colourless;\r\n    For he, that stood beside me like my youth,\r\n    He charmed reality into a dream,\r\n    And over all the common face of things\r\n    He shed the golden glow of morning’s blush;\r\n    And in the fire of his affection\r\n    Dull forms, that throng the life of every day,\r\n    Yea to mine own amazement, tow’red aloft.\r\n    Win what I may henceforth, the Beautiful\r\n    Is gone, and gone without return.”(75)\r\n\r\n    You will say this was an opening. In reading another part of the\r\n    book I found lines which I have turned as follows, no better than\r\n    the others:—\r\n\r\n    “For nothing other than a noble aim\r\n    Up from its depths can stir humanity;\r\n    The narrow circle narrows, too, the mind,\r\n    And man grows greater as his ends are great.”(76)\r\n\r\n    Now, I thought, can I in reply call the Queen’s attention to these\r\n    significant words, a noble sermon? I asked Lady Augusta (of course\r\n    I mean the German words) and she would not venture it. Had I a\r\n    _viva voce_ chance, I would try.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 6._—I am sorry you quitted Penmaenmawr in the sulks—I mean\r\n    him in the sulks, not you. Your exploit was great; was it not\r\n    rather over-great? I have been out to-day for a real good seven\r\n    hours in the open air, going up Lochnagar. The day was glorious.\r\n    We went five gentlemen, at least men. E. H. was keen to go, but\r\n    the Queen would not let her. Thomas also went up with a party from\r\n    here, and his _raptures_ are such as would do you good. He says\r\n    there is nothing it was not worth, and he has no words to describe\r\n    his pleasure. Our party drove to Loch Muich, and then went up,\r\n    some of us on ponies, some riding. I walked it all, and am not in\r\n    the least tired, but quite ready, if there were need, to set out\r\n    for it again. We saw towards the north as far as Caithness. I\r\n    could not do all that the others did in looking down the\r\n    precipices, but I managed a little. We had a very steep side to\r\n    come down, covered with snow and very slippery; I was put to it,\r\n    and had to come very slow, but Lord C. Fitzroy, like a good\r\n    Samaritan, kept me company. The day was as lovely (after frost and\r\n    snow in the night) as anything could be, and the whole is voted a\r\n    great success. Well, there is a cabinet fixed for Tuesday; on the\r\n    whole, this may be better than having it hang over one’s head.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 7._—The Queen’s talk last night (only think, she wants to\r\n    read the French Jesuit—don’t know this) was about Guizot’s\r\n    comparison of the Prince and King William, about Macaulay, America\r\n    and the ironclads, where she was very national and high-spirited;\r\n    and Schleswig-Holstein, in which she is intensely interested,\r\n    because the Prince thought it a great case of justice on the side\r\n    rather opposite to that of Lord Palmerston and the government\r\n    policy. She spoke about this with intense earnestness, and said\r\n    she considered it a legacy from him.\r\n\r\n    Princess Alice’s baby lives above me, and I believe never cries. I\r\n    never hear it. We have been out riding to Birkhall to-day, and I\r\n    had much talk with Lady Churchill about the Queen. She (Lady C.)\r\n    feels and speaks most properly about her. I told Lady Augusta last\r\n    night, _à propos_ to the lines I wanted to mention, that I had\r\n    been a great coward, _and she too_. She was very submissive at\r\n    dinner in her manner to the Queen, and I told her it made me feel\r\n    I had been so impudent. Only think of this: both through her and\r\n    through General Grey it has come round to me that the Queen thinks\r\n    she was too cheerful on the night I last dined. This she feels a\r\n    kind of sin. She said, however, to Lady Augusta she was sure I\r\n    should understand it.... I am very glad and a little surprised\r\n    that Mrs. Bruce should say I have a good name here. The people\r\n    are, one and all, very easy to get on with, and Windsor, I\r\n    suppose, stiffens them a little.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 8._—The Queen has had a most providential escape. The\r\n    carriage, a sociable, very low and safe, was overturned last night\r\n    after dark, on her way back from an expedition of seven or eight\r\n    hours. Princesses Louis of Hesse and Helena were with her. They\r\n    were undermost, and not at all hurt. The Queen was shot out of the\r\n    carriage, and received a contusion on the temple and sprained a\r\n    thumb. When she got in, I think near ten o’clock, Dr. Jenner\r\n    wished her to go to bed, but she said it was of no use, and she\r\n    would not. She was very confident, however, about performing the\r\n    duties of the ceremonial in Aberdeen to-morrow. But now this\r\n    evening it is given up, and I do not doubt this is wise, but much\r\n    inconvenience will be caused by so late a postponement. I have\r\n    been up to the place to-day.... The Queen should give up these\r\n    drives after dark; it is impossible to guarantee them. But she\r\n    says she feels the hours from her drive to dinner such weary\r\n    hours.\r\n\r\n    Little Princess Victoria paid me a visit in my bedroom, which is\r\n    also sitting-room, to-day. She is of sweet temper, decidedly\r\n    pretty, very like both the Queen and her mother. Then I went to\r\n    see the three Prussian children, and the two elder ones played\r\n    with my rusty old stick of twenty or twenty-five years’ standing.\r\n\r\n    _Holyrood, Oct. 11._—On Friday morning, as I expected, I talked to\r\n    the Queen until the last moment. She did give me opportunities\r\n    which might have led on to anything, but want of time hustled me,\r\n    and though I spoke abruptly enough, and did not find myself timid,\r\n    yet I could [not] manage it at all to my satisfaction. She said\r\n    the one purpose of her life was gone, and she could not help\r\n    wishing the accident had ended it. This is hardly qualified by\r\n    another thing which she said to Lady Churchill, that she should\r\n    not like to have died in that way. She went on to speak of her\r\n    life as likely to be short. I told her that she would not give\r\n    way, that duty would sustain her (this she quite recognised), that\r\n    her burden was altogether peculiar, but the honour was in\r\n    proportion, that no one could wonder at her feeling the present,\r\n    which is near, but that the reward is _there_, though distant....\r\n    Then about politics, which will keep. She rowed me for writing to\r\n    Lord Palmerston about her accident, and said, “But, dear Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, that was quite wrong.” The secret is kept wonderfully,\r\n    and you must keep it. I hinted that it would be a very bad thing\r\n    to have G. Grey away from such a cabinet on Tuesday, but all I\r\n    could get was that I might arrange for any other minister (some\r\n    one there certainly ought to be). I lectured her a little for\r\n    driving after dark in such a country, but she said all her habits\r\n    were formed on the Prince’s wishes and directions, and she could\r\n    not alter them.\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, Dec. 29._—I am well _past half_ a century. My life has\r\n    not been inactive. But of what kind has been its activity?\r\n    Inwardly I feel it to be open to this general observation: it\r\n    seems to have been and to be a series of efforts to be and to do\r\n    what is beyond my natural force. This of itself is not\r\n    condemnation, though it is a spectacle effectually humbling when I\r\n    see that I have not according to Schiller’s figure enlarged with\r\n    the circle in which I live and move. [_Diary._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 2, 1864._—The cabinet was on matters of great importance\r\n    connected with Denmark, and has decided rightly to seek the\r\n    co-operation of France and other powers before talking about the\r\n    use, in any event, of force.(77) Lord Palmerston has gout sharply\r\n    in the hand. The Queen wrote a letter, which I think did her great\r\n    credit. Her love of truth and wish to do right prevent all\r\n    prejudices from effectually warping her.\r\n\r\n    The Queen talked much about the Danish question, and is very\r\n    desirous of a more staid and quiet foreign policy. For the first\r\n    time I think she takes a just credit to herself for having\r\n    influenced beneficially the course of policy and of affairs in the\r\n    late controversy.\r\n\r\n    _Balmoral, Sept. 28._—I thought the Queen’s state of health and\r\n    spirits last night very satisfactory. She looks better, more like\r\n    what she used to look, and the spirits were very even; with the\r\n    little references to the Prince just as usual. Whenever she quotes\r\n    an opinion of the Prince, she looks upon the question as\r\n    completely shut up by it, for herself and all the world. Prince\r\n    Alfred is going to Germany for nine weeks—to study at Bonn, and to\r\n    be more or less at Coburg. The Queen asked for you, of course. She\r\n    has not said a syllable about public affairs to me since I came,\r\n    but talked pleasantly of all manner of things.\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 29._—The Queen sent to offer a day’s deer-stalking, but I\r\n    am loth to trust my long eyesight.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 2._—At dinner last night there was a great deal of\r\n    conversation, and to-day I have been near an hour with the Queen\r\n    after coming back from Ballater. She was as good and as gracious\r\n    as possible. I can hardly tell you all the things talked\r\n    about—Prince Humbert, Garibaldi, Lady Lyttelton, the Hagley boys,\r\n    Lucy, smoking, dress, fashion, Prince Alfred, his establishment\r\n    and future plans, Prince of Wales’s visit to Denmark, revenue,\r\n    Lancashire, foreign policy, the newspaper press, the habits of the\r\n    present generation, young men, young married ladies, clubs,\r\n    Clarendon’s journey, the Prince Consort on dress and fashion,\r\n    Prince of Wales on ditto, Sir R. Peel, F. Peel, Mrs. Stonor, the\r\n    rest of that family, misreading foreign names and words, repute of\r\n    English people abroad, happy absence of foreign office disputes\r\n    and quarrels.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 3._—I am just in from a sixteen mile walk, quite fresh, and\r\n    pleased with myself! for having in my old age walked a measured\r\n    mile in twelve minutes by the side of this beautiful Dee.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 7._—I have just come in from a delightful twenty-five miles\r\n    ride with General Grey and another companion. I had another long\r\n    interview with the Queen to-day. She talked most, and very freely\r\n    and confidentially, about the Prince of Wales; also about Lord\r\n    Russell and Lord Palmerston, and about Granville and Clarendon,\r\n    the latter perhaps to an effect that will a little surprise you.\r\n    Also the Dean of Windsor. It was a kind of farewell audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII. Garibaldi—Denmark. (1864)\r\n\r\n\r\n    There are in Europe two great questions: the question called\r\n    social and the question of nationalities.... The map of Europe has\r\n    to be re-made.... I affirm with profound conviction that this\r\n    movement of nationalities has attained in Italy, in Hungary, in\r\n    Vienna, in a great part of Germany, and in some of the Slavonian\r\n    populations, a degree of importance that must at no distant period\r\n    produce decisive results.... The first war-cry that arises will\r\n    carry with it a whole zone of Europe.—MAZZINI (1852).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n“My confidence in the Italian parliament and people,” Mr. Gladstone wrote\r\nto Lacaita at the end of 1862, “increases from day to day. Their\r\nself-command, moderation, patience, firmness, and forethought reaching far\r\ninto the future, are really beyond all praise.” And a few days later,\r\nagain to Lacaita—“Your letter proves that the king has not merely got the\r\nconstitutional lesson by rote—though even this for an Italian king would\r\nbe much; but that the doctrine has sunk into the marrow and the bone.” The\r\ncause was won, and the work of construction went forward, but not on such\r\nlines as Cavour’s master-hand was likely to have traced. Very early Mr.\r\nGladstone began to be uneasy about Italian finance. “I am sure,” he wrote\r\nto Lacaita in April 1863, “that Italian freedom has no greater enemy in\r\nthe Triple Crown or elsewhere, than large continuing deficits.”\r\n\r\nAs events marched forward, the French occupation of Rome became an ever\r\ngreater scandal in Mr. Gladstone’s eyes. He writes to Panizzi (October 28,\r\n1862):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    My course about the Emperor has been a very simple one. It is not\r\n    for me to pass gratuitous opinions upon his character or that of\r\n    French institutions, or on his dealings with them. I believe him\r\n    to be firmly attached to the English alliance, and I think his\r\n    course towards us has been, on almost every occasion, marked by a\r\n    friendliness perhaps greater and more conspicuous than we have\r\n    always deserved at his hands. It is most painful to me to witness\r\n    his conduct with regard to Italy.... He conferred upon her in 1859\r\n    an immense, an inestimable boon. He marred this boon in a way\r\n    which to me seemed little worthy of France by the paltry but\r\n    unkind appropriation of Nice in particular. But in the matter of\r\n    Rome he inflicts upon Italy a fearful injury. And I do not know by\r\n    what law of ethics any one is entitled to plead the having\r\n    conferred an unexpected boon, as giving a right to inflict a gross\r\n    and enduring wrong.(78)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in 1862 that Mr. Gladstone made his greatest speech on Italian\r\naffairs.(79) “I am ashamed to say,” he told the House, “that for a long\r\ntime, I, like many, withheld my assent and approval from Italian\r\nyearnings.” He amply atoned for his tardiness, and his exposure of Naples,\r\nwhere perjury was the tradition of its kings; of the government of the\r\npope in the Romagna, where the common administration of law and justice\r\nwas handed over to Austrian soldiery; of the stupid and execrable\r\nlawlessness of the Duke of Modena; of the attitude of Austria as a\r\ndominant and conquering nation over a subject and conquered race;—all this\r\nstamped a decisive impression on the minds of his hearers. Along with his\r\nspeech on Reform in 1864, and that on the Irish church in the spring of\r\n1865, it secured Mr. Gladstone’s hold upon all of the rising generation of\r\nliberals who cared for the influence and the good name of Great Britain in\r\nEurope, and who were capable of sympathising with, popular feeling and the\r\nclaims of national justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M31) The Italian sentiment of England reached its climax in the reception\r\naccorded to Garibaldi by the metropolis in April 1864. “I do not know what\r\npersons in office are to do with him,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord\r\nPalmerston (March 26), “but you will lead, and we shall follow suit.” The\r\npopulace took the thing into their own hands. London has seldom beheld a\r\nspectacle more extraordinary or more moving. The hero in the red shirt and\r\nblue-grey cloak long associated in the popular mind with so many thrilling\r\nstories of which they had been told, drove from the railway at Vauxhall to\r\nStafford House, the noblest of the private palaces of the capital, amid\r\nvast continuous multitudes, blocking roadways, filling windows, lining\r\nevery parapet and roof with eager gazers. For five hours Garibaldi passed\r\non amid tumultuous waves of passionate curiosity, delight, enthusiasm. And\r\nthis more than regal entry was the arrival not of some loved prince or\r\ntriumphant captain of our own, but of a foreigner and the deliverer of a\r\nforeign people. Some were drawn by his daring as a fighter, and by the\r\npicturesque figure as of a hero of antique mould; many by sight of the\r\nsworn foe of Giant Pope; but what fired the hearts of most was the thought\r\nof him as the soldier who bore the sword for human freedom. The western\r\nworld was in one of its generous moments. In those days there were\r\nidealists; democracy was conscious of common interests and common\r\nbrotherhood; a liberal Europe was then a force and not a dream.\r\n\r\n“We who then saw Garibaldi for the first time,” Mr. Gladstone said nearly\r\ntwenty years after, “can many of us never forget the marvellous effect\r\nproduced upon all minds by the simple nobility of his demeanour, by his\r\nmanners and his acts.... Besides his splendid integrity, and his wide and\r\nuniversal sympathies, besides that seductive simplicity of manner which\r\nnever departed from him, and that inborn and native grace which seemed to\r\nattend all his actions, I would almost select from every other quality\r\nthis, which was in apparent contrast but real harmony in Garibaldi—the\r\nunion of the most profound and tender humanity with his fiery valour.”(80)\r\nHe once described the Italian chief to me as “one of the finest\r\ncombinations of profound and unalterable simplicity with\r\nself-consciousness and self-possession. I shall never forget an occasion\r\nat Chiswick; Palmerston, John Russell, and all the leaders were awaiting\r\nhim on the _perron_; he advanced with perfect simplicity and naturalness,\r\nyet with perfect consciousness of his position; very striking and very\r\nfine.” Garibaldi dined with Mr. Gladstone, and they met elsewhere. At a\r\ndinner at Panizzi’s, they sat by one another. “I remember,” said Mr.\r\nGladstone, “he told a story in these words: ‘When I was a boy,’ he said,\r\n‘I was at school in Genoa. It was towards the close of the great French\r\nRevolution. Genoa was a great military post—a large garrison always in the\r\ntown, constant parades and military display, with bands and flags that\r\nwere beyond everything attractive to schoolboys. All my schoolfellows used\r\nto run here and there all over the town to see if they could get sight of\r\none of these military parades and exhibitions. I never went to one. It\r\nstruck me then as a matter of pain and horror, that it should be necessary\r\nthat one portion of mankind should be set aside to have for their\r\nprofession the business of destroying others.’ ”\r\n\r\nAnother side of Garibaldi was less congenial. A great lady wrote to Mr.\r\nGladstone of a conversation with him. “I talked to Garibaldi with regret\r\nthat Renan was so much read in Italy. He said ‘_Perche?_’ and showed that\r\nhe did not dislike it, and that he has also in leaving Rome left very much\r\nelse. I know that woman’s words are useless: the more men disbelieve, the\r\nmore they think it well that women should be ‘superstitious.’ You are not\r\nlikely to have _arguments_ with him, but I would give much that he should\r\ntake away with him some few words that would bring home to him the fact\r\nthat the statesman he cares for most would think life a miserable thing\r\nwithout faith in God our Saviour.” To another correspondent on this point\r\nMr. Gladstone wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The honour paid him was I think his due as a most singularly\r\n    simple, disinterested, and heroic character, who had achieved\r\n    great things for Italy, for liberty well-understood, and even for\r\n    mankind. His insurrection we knew and lamented, and treated as\r\n    exceptional. No Mazzinian leanings of his were known. I read the\r\n    speech at the luncheon with surprise and concern.(81) As to his\r\n    attenuated belief, I view it with the deepest sorrow and concern,\r\n    I need not repeat an opinion, always painful to me to pronounce,\r\n    as to the principal causes to which it is referable, and as to the\r\n    chief seat of the responsibility for it. As to his Goddess Reason,\r\n    I understand by it simply an adoption of what are called on the\r\n    continent the principles of the French Revolution. These we\r\n    neither want nor warmly relish in England, but they are different\r\n    from its excesses, and the words will bear an innocent and even in\r\n    some respects a beneficial meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe diary records:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 12._—To Chiswick and met Garibaldi. We were quite satisfied\r\n    with him. He did me much more than justice. 14.—Went by a\r\n    desperate push to see Garibaldi welcomed at the opera. It was\r\n    good, but not like the _people_. 17.—At Stafford House 5-1/4—6-½\r\n    and 9-1/4—12-½ on Garibaldi’s movements. In a conversation he\r\n    agreed to give up the provincial tour. 20.—In the evening the\r\n    great entertainment to Garibaldi came off. Before the door at\r\n    night say a thousand people all in the best of humour, the hall\r\n    and stair full before dinner. A hostile demonstration invaded us\r\n    at ten, but we ejected them. I settled about to-morrow with\r\n    Garibaldi, the Duke of Sutherland, Lord Palmerston, and Lord\r\n    Shaftesbury. My nerves would not let me—hardened as I am—sleep\r\n    till after five.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M32) Suddenly one morning the country was surprised to learn that\r\nGaribaldi was at once departing. Dark suspicions rose instantly in the\r\nminds of his more democratic friends. It had always been rather bitter to\r\nthem that he should be the guest of a duke. They now insisted that the\r\nwhig aristocrats were in a panic lest he should compromise himself with\r\nthe radicals, and that he was being hustled out of the country against his\r\nwill. This suspicion next grew into something blacker still. A story\r\nspread that the Emperor of the French had taken umbrage, and signified to\r\nthe government that the reception of Garibaldi was distasteful to France.\r\nLord Clarendon promptly denied the fable. He told the House of Lords that\r\nthe Emperor (of whom he had recently had an audience) had even expressed\r\nhis admiration for the feeling of which the reception was a sign. Lord\r\nPalmerston in the other House explained that Garibaldi was going away\r\nearlier than had been expected, because at home he went to bed at eight\r\nand rose at five, and to a person of these habits to dine at half past\r\neight and to remain in a throng of admirers until midnight must\r\nnecessarily be injurious. Still the fog hung heavy on the public mind. A\r\nrider was now added to the tale, that it was the chancellor of the\r\nexchequer who out of deference to the Emperor, or to please the whigs, or\r\nout of complaisance to the court, had induced the hero to take his hurried\r\nleave. Mr. Gladstone was forced to explain to the House of Commons, seldom\r\nreluctant to lighten its graver deliberations with a personal incident,\r\nthat the Duke of Sutherland had carried him to Stafford House; there he\r\nfound that Garibaldi had accepted invitations to thirty provincial towns\r\nand that the list was growing longer every day; the doctors declared that\r\nthe general’s strength would never stand the exhaustion of a progress on\r\nsuch a scale; and the friends there present begged him to express his own\r\nopinion to Garibaldi. This Mr. Gladstone accordingly did, to the effect\r\nthat the hero’s life and health were objects of value to the whole world,\r\nand that even apart from health the repetition all over England of the\r\nnational reception in London would do something to impair a unique\r\nhistorical event.(82) The general was taken to show excellent sense by\r\naccepting advice not to allow himself to be killed by kindness. At any\r\nrate he firmly declared that if he could not go to all the places that\r\ninvited him, it was impossible for him to draw a line of preference, and\r\ntherefore he would go to none. His radical friends, however, seem to have\r\ninstilled some of their own suspicions into his mind, for two days later\r\n(April 23) Mr. Gladstone writes to Lord Clarendon: “I am to see Garibaldi\r\nat Cliveden this evening, and it is possible that some occasion may offer\r\nthere for obtaining from him a further declaration. But since I received\r\nyour note the following circumstance has occurred. Clarence Paget has been\r\nto me, and reports that Mrs. ——, a well-known and zealous but\r\nanti-Mazzinian liberal in Italian matters, who is also a friend of\r\nGaribaldi’s, has acquainted him that Garibaldi himself has made known to\r\nher that according to his own painful impression the English government do\r\nconsider the prolongation of his stay in England very embarrassing, and\r\nare very anxious that he should go. What a pity, if this be so, that this\r\nsimple and heroic man could not speak his mind plainly out to me, but\r\nwrapped himself in the depths of diplomatic reserve, instead of acting\r\nlike Lord Aberdeen, who used to say, ‘I have a habit of believing\r\npeople.’ ”(83) After three or four days at Cliveden the general still held\r\nto his purpose. “_April 24._—Cliveden. Conversation with Garibaldi. The\r\nutmost I could get from him was that it would be sad if the Italian people\r\nshould lose its faith.” So Garibaldi forthwith sailed away from our\r\nshores.(84)\r\n\r\nWhen all was over, an Italian statesman wrote to Panizzi that though he\r\nthought Garibaldi one of the choicest natures ever created,—enterprising,\r\nhumane, disinterested, eminent in national service, yet neither he nor any\r\nother citizen was entitled to set himself above the laws of his country,\r\nand that such a man should be officially received by the heir to the\r\nthrone and by secretaries of state, was a thing to be bitterly deplored by\r\nevery sensible man.(85) Still history can afford to agree with Mr.\r\nGladstone when he said of Garibaldi—“His name is indeed illustrious, it\r\nremains inseparably connected with the not less illustrious name of the\r\ngreat Cavour, and these two names are again associated with the name of\r\nVictor Emmanuel. These three together form for Italians a tricolour as\r\nbrilliant, as ever fresh, and I hope as enduring for many and many\r\ngenerations, as the national flag that now waves over united Italy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tide of vast events in this momentous period now rolled heavily away\r\nfrom the Danube and the Bosphorus, from Tiber and Po and Adriatic sea, to\r\nthe shores of the Baltic and the mouths of the Elbe. None of the\r\nfascination of old-world history lends its magic to the new chapter that\r\nopened in 1863. Cavour had gone. Bismarck with sterner genius, fiercer\r\npurpose, more implacable designs, and with a hand as of hammered iron,\r\nstrode into the field. The Italian statesman was the author of a singular\r\nprediction. In 1861 when Cavour was deprecating angry protests from the\r\nEuropean powers against his invasion of the Marches, he used words of\r\nextraordinary foresight to the representative of Prussia. “I am sorry,” he\r\nsaid, “that the cabinet of Berlin judges so severely the conduct of the\r\nKing of Italy and his government. I console myself by thinking that on\r\nthis occasion I am setting an example that probably in no long time,\r\nPrussia will be very glad to imitate.”(86) So the world speedily found\r\nout.\r\n\r\n(M33) The torch of nationality reached material for a flame long\r\nsmouldering in two duchies of the remote north, that had been incorporated\r\nin Denmark by solemn European engagements in 1852, but were inhabited by a\r\npopulation, one of them wholly and the other mainly, not Scandinavian but\r\nGerman. Thus the same question of race, history, language, sentiment, that\r\nhad worked in Italy, Poland, the Balkan states, rose up in this miniature\r\ncase. The circumstances that brought that case into such fatal prominence\r\ndo not concern us here. The alleged wrongs of her brethren in\r\nSchleswig-Holstein unchained such a tempest of excitement in central\r\nGermany, that the German courts could hardly have resisted if they would.\r\nJust as powerless was the Danish government in face of the Scandinavian\r\nsentiment of its subjects and their neighbours of the race. Even the\r\nliberals, then a power in Germany and Bismarck’s bitter foes, were\r\nvehemently on the national side against the Danish claim; and one of the\r\nmost striking of all Bismarck’s feats was the skill with which he now used\r\nhis domestic enemies to further his own designs of national\r\naggrandisement. How war broke out between the small power and the two\r\ngreat powers of Austria and Prussia, and how the small power was\r\nruthlessly crushed; by what infinite and complex machinations the\r\ndiplomacy of Europe found itself paralysed; how Prussia audaciously\r\npossessed herself of territory that would give her a deep-water port, and\r\nthe head of a channel that would unite two great seas; how all this ended\r\nin Prussia, “the Piedmont of the north,” doing what Cavour in his Piedmont\r\nof the south had foretold that she would be glad to do; how at Sadowa\r\n(July 3, 1866) Austria was driven out of her long hegemony, and Hanover\r\nincorporated; and to what a train of amazing conflicts in western Europe,\r\nto what unexpected victories, territorial change, dynastic ruin, this so\r\nresistlessly led up—here is a narrative that belongs to the province of\r\nhistory. Yet it has a place in any political biography of the Palmerston\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nIn such an era of general confusion, the English cabinet found no powerful\r\nor noble part to play. Still they went far—almost too far to\r\nrecede—towards embarking in a continental war on behalf of Denmark, that\r\nwould have been full of mischief to herself, of little profit to her\r\nclient, and could hardly have ended otherwise than in widespread disaster.\r\nHere is one of the very few instances in which the public opinion of the\r\ncountry at the eleventh hour reined back a warlike minister. Lord\r\nPalmerston told the House of Commons in the summer of 1863 that, if any\r\nviolent attempt were made to overthrow the rights of Denmark or to\r\ninterfere with its independence and integrity, he was convinced that those\r\nwho made the attempt would find in the result that “it would not be\r\nDenmark alone with which they would have to contend.”(87) This did indeed\r\nsound like a compromising declaration of quite sufficient emphasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n    It seems, says Mr. Gladstone,(88) that this statement was\r\n    generally and not unnaturally interpreted as a promise of support\r\n    from England. Lord Palmerston does not seem to have added any\r\n    condition or reservation. Strange as it may appear, he had spoken\r\n    entirely of his own motion and without the authority or knowledge\r\n    of his cabinet, in which indeed, so far as my memory serves,\r\n    nothing had happened to render likely any declaration of any kind\r\n    on the subject. I have no means of knowing whether he spoke in\r\n    concert with the foreign secretary, Earl Russell, with whom his\r\n    communications, agreeably to policy and to established usage,\r\n    were, I believe, large and constant. When the question was\r\n    eventually disposed of by the war which Prussia and Austria waged\r\n    against Denmark, there was much indignation felt against England\r\n    for the breach of her engagement to give support in the case of\r\n    war, to the small power so egregiously in need of it. And there\r\n    was no one to raise a voice in our favour.\r\n\r\n    As the year advanced (1863) and the prospect of war came nearer,\r\n    the subject was very properly brought before the cabinet. I\r\n    believe that at the time I was not even aware of Lord Palmerston’s\r\n    declaration, which, owing to the exhausted period of the session,\r\n    had I believe attracted no great amount of attention in England.\r\n    Whether my colleagues generally were as little aware of what\r\n    happened as myself I do not know, but unquestionably we could not\r\n    all have missed learning it. However we did not as a body\r\n    recognise in any way the title of the prime minister to bind us to\r\n    go to war. We were, however, indignant at the conduct of the\r\n    German powers who, as we thought, were scheming piracy under cover\r\n    of pacific correspondence. And we agreed upon a very important\r\n    measure, in which Lord Palmerston acquiesced, when he had failed,\r\n    if I remember right, in inducing the cabinet to go farther. We\r\n    knew that France took the same view of the question as we did, and\r\n    we framed a communication to her to the following effect. We were\r\n    jointly to insist that the claim of the Duke of Augustenburg\r\n    should be peacefully settled on juridical grounds; and to announce\r\n    to Prussia and Austria that if they proceeded to prosecute it by\r\n    the use of force against Denmark, we would jointly resist them\r\n    with all our might.(89)\r\n\r\n    This communication was accordingly made to Louis Napoleon. He\r\n    declined the proposal. He said that the question was one of\r\n    immense importance to us, who had such vast interests involved,\r\n    and that the plan was reasonable from our point of view; but that\r\n    the matter was one of small moment for France, whom accordingly we\r\n    could not ask to join in it. The explanation of this answer, so\r\n    foolish in its terms, and so pregnant with consequences in this\r\n    matter, was, I believe, to be found in the pique of Louis Napoleon\r\n    at a reply we had then recently given to a proposal of his for an\r\n    European conference or congress.(90) We all thought that his plan\r\n    was wholly needless and would in all likelihood lead to mischief.\r\n    So we declined it in perfect good faith and without implying by\r\n    our refusal any difference of policy in the particular matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the session of 1864 the attention of the country was fixed upon\r\nthis question whether England should or should not take part in the war\r\nbetween Germany and Denmark. The week before the time arrived for the\r\nminister to announce the decision of the cabinet, it became clear that\r\npublic opinion in the great English centres would run decisively for\r\nnon-intervention. Some of the steadiest supporters of government in\r\nparliament boldly told the party whips that if war against Germany were\r\nproposed, they would vote against it. The cabinet met. Palmerston and Lord\r\nRussell were for war, even though it would be war single-handed. Little\r\nsupport came to them. The Queen was strongly against them. They bemoaned\r\nto one another the timidity of their colleagues, and half-mournfully\r\ncontrasted the convenient ciphers that filled the cabinets of Pitt and\r\nPeel, with the number of able men with independent opinions in their own\r\nadministration. The prime minister, as I have heard from one who was\r\npresent, held his head down while the talk proceeded, and then at last\r\nlooking up said in a neutral voice, “I think the cabinet is against war.”\r\nHere is Mr. Gladstone’s record:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _May 7, ’64._—Cabinet. The war “party” as it might be called—Lord\r\n    Palmerston, Lord Russell, Lord Stanley of Alderley, and the\r\n    chancellor (Lord Westbury). All went well. _June 11._—Cabinet.\r\n    Very stiff on the Danish question, but went well. _June\r\n    24._—Cabinet. A grave issue well discussed. _June 25._—Cabinet. We\r\n    divided, and came to a tolerable, not the best, conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems almost incredible that a cabinet of rational men could have\r\ndebated for ten minutes the question of going to war with Prussia and\r\nAustria, when they knew that twenty thousand men were the largest force\r\nthat we could have put into the field when war began, though moderate\r\nadditions might have been made as time went on—not, however, without\r\nhazardous denudation of India, where the memories of the mutiny were still\r\nfresh. The Emperor of the French in fact had good reason for fearing that\r\nhe would be left in the lurch again, as he thought that he had been left\r\nbefore in his attempts for Poland. Your intervention, he said to England,\r\nwill be naval; but we may have to fight a people of forty millions on\r\nland, and we will not intervene unless you engage to send troops.(91) The\r\ndismemberment of Denmark was thought an odious feat, but the localisation\r\nof the war was at least a restriction of the evils attending it.\r\n\r\n(M34) A high parliamentary debate followed (July 4) on a motion made by\r\nMr. Disraeli, “to express to Her Majesty our great regret that while the\r\ncourse pursued by the government had failed to maintain their avowed\r\npolicy of upholding the independence and integrity of Denmark, it has\r\nlowered the just influence of this country in the councils of Europe, and\r\nthereby diminished the securities for peace.”(92) Cobden taunted both\r\nfront benches pretty impartially with the equivocal and most dishonourable\r\nposition into which their policy had brought the country, by encouraging a\r\nsmall power to fight two great ones and then straightway leaving her to\r\nget out as best she might. The government was only saved by Palmerston’s\r\nappeal to its financial triumphs—the very triumphs that he had himself\r\nmade most difficult to achieve. The appeal was irrelevant, but it was\r\ndecisive, and ministers escaped a condemnation by no means unmerited on\r\nthe special issue, by a majority of eighteen. The Manchester men agreed to\r\nhelp in the result, because in Cobden’s words they were convinced that a\r\nrevolution had been at last wrought in the mischievous policy of incessant\r\nintervention. Mr. Disraeli’s case was easy, but to propound an easy case\r\nwhen its exposition demands much selection from voluminous blue-books is\r\noften hard, and the orator was long and over-elaborate. The excitement of\r\nan audience, aware all the time that actual danger hovered over the\r\nministry, revived afresh when Disraeli sat down and Gladstone rose. The\r\npersonal emulation of powerful rivals lends dramatic elements to\r\ndisputation. Lord Palmerston had written to Mr. Gladstone beforehand—“We\r\nshall want a great gun to follow Disraeli. Would you be ready to follow\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 3._—I was happy enough, aided by force of habit, to drive\r\n    bodily out of my head for the whole day everything Dano-German.\r\n    But not out of my nerves. I delivered during the night a speech in\r\n    parliament on the Roman question.\r\n\r\n    _July 4._—H. of C. Replied to Disraeli. It took an hour and\r\n    thirty-five minutes. I threw overboard all my heavy armament and\r\n    fought light.\r\n\r\n\r\nNobody who is not historian or biographer is likely to read this speech of\r\nMr. Gladstone’s to-day, but we may believe contemporary witnesses who\r\nrecord that the orator’s weight of fact, his force of argument, his\r\nsarcastic play of personal impulse and motive, his bold and energetic\r\nrefutation of hostile criticism, his defiant statement of the ministerial\r\ncase, so impressed even a sceptical and doubting House that, though his\r\nstring of special pleas did not amount to a justification, “they almost\r\nreached the height of an excuse,” and they crushed the debate. The basis\r\nwas the familiar refrain upon Mr. Gladstone’s lips,—“The steps taken by\r\nthe government, what were they but endeavours to bind together the powers\r\nof Europe for fulfilment and maintenance of an important European\r\nengagement?” Still history, even of that sane and tempered school that is\r\ncontent to take politics as often an affair of second-best, will probably\r\njudge that Mr. Disraeli was not wrong when he said of the policy of this\r\nera that, whether we looked to Russia, to Greece, to France, there had\r\nbeen exhibited by ministers a confusion, an inconsistency of conduct, a\r\ncontrariety of courses with regard to the same powers and a total want of\r\nsystem in their diplomacy.(93) It is true, however, that just the same\r\nconfusion, inconsistency, and contrariety marked Russia, France, and\r\nAustria themselves. Another speaker of the same party, as mordant as\r\nDisraeli, and destined like him to rise to the chief place in the councils\r\nof the nation, went further, and said, in following Cobden in the debate,\r\n“If Mr. Cobden had been foreign secretary, instead of Lord Russell, I\r\nfully believe this country would occupy a position proud and noble\r\ncompared to that which she occupies at this moment. She would at least\r\nhave been entitled to the credit of holding out in the name of England no\r\nhopes which she did not intend to fulfil, of entering into no engagements\r\nfrom which she was ready to recede.”(94) Well might Mr. Gladstone enter in\r\nhis diary:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 8._—This debate ought to be an epoch in foreign policy. We\r\n    have all much to learn. Lord Palmerston’s speech was unequivocally\r\n    weak in the mental and the bodily sense. I think it was to-day\r\n    that the Prince of Wales rode with Granville and me; he showed a\r\n    little Danism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII. Advance In Public Position And Otherwise. (1864)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The best form of government is that which doth actuate and dispose\r\n    every part and member of a state to the common good. If, instead\r\n    of concord and interchange of support, one part seeks to uphold an\r\n    old form of government, and the other part introduce a new, they\r\n    will miserably consume one and other. Histories are full of the\r\n    calamities of entire states and nations in such cases. It is,\r\n    nevertheless, equally true that time must needs bring about some\r\n    alterations.... Therefore have those commonwealths been ever the\r\n    most durable and perpetual which have often formed and recomposed\r\n    themselves according to their first institution and\r\n    ordinance.—PYM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nA rapid and extraordinary change began to take place in Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nposition after the year 1863. With this was associated an internal\r\ndevelopment of his political ideas and an expansion of social feeling,\r\nstill more remarkable and interesting. As we have seen, he reckoned that a\r\nlittle earlier than this he had reached his lowest point in public\r\nestimation. He had now been more than thirty years in parliament. He had\r\nsat in three cabinets, each of a different colour and different\r\nconnections from the other two. It was not until he had seen half a\r\ncentury of life on our planet, and more than quarter of a century of life\r\nin the House of Commons, that it was at all certain whether he would be\r\nconservative or liberal, to what species of either genus he would attach\r\nhimself, or whether there might not from his progressive transmutations be\r\nevolved some variety wholly new.\r\n\r\nI have already given his picture of the Palmerston cabinet as a\r\nkaleidoscope, and the same simile would be no bad account of his own\r\nrelation to the political groups and parties around him. The Manchester\r\nmen and the young radicals from the West Riding of Yorkshire were his\r\nardent adherents when he preached economy and peace, but they were chilled\r\nto the core by his neutrality or worse upon the life and death struggle\r\nacross the Atlantic. His bold and confident finance was doubted by the\r\nwhigs, and disliked by the tories. But then the tories, apart from their\r\nwiser leader, were delighted by his friendly words about the Confederates,\r\nand the whigs were delighted with his unflagging zeal for the deliverance\r\nof Italy. Only, zeal for the deliverance of Italy lost him the friendship\r\nof those children of the Holy Father who came from Ireland. Then again the\r\nCity was not easy at the flash of activity and enterprise at the\r\nexchequer, and the money-changers did not know what disturbance this\r\nintrepid genius might bring into the traffic of their tables. On the other\r\nhand, the manufacturers and the merchants of the midlands and the north\r\nadored a chancellor whose budgets were associated with expanding trade and\r\na prosperity that advanced by leaps and bounds. The nonconformists were\r\nattracted by his personal piety, though repelled by its ecclesiastical\r\napparel. The high churchmen doubtless knew him for their own, yet even\r\nthey resented his confederacy with an erastian and a latitudinarian like\r\nJohn Russell, or a Gallio like Lord Palmerston, who distributed mitres and\r\ncrown benefices at the ultra-evangelical bidding of Lord Shaftesbury. To\r\nborrow a figure from a fine observer of those days,—the political\r\nmolecules were incessantly forming and re-forming themselves into shifting\r\naggregates, now attracted, now repelled by his central force; now the\r\nnucleus of an organised party, then resolved again in loose and distant\r\nsatellites.\r\n\r\nThe great families still held ostensibly the predominance in the liberal\r\nparty which they had earned by their stout and persistent fidelity to\r\nparliamentary reform. Their days of leadership, however, were drawing\r\ntowards an end, though the process has not been rapid. They produced some\r\ngood administrators, but nobody with the gifts of freshness and political\r\ngenius. The three originating statesmen of that era, after all, were\r\nCobden, Gladstone, Disraeli, none of them (M35) born in the purple of the\r\ndirecting class. A Yorkshire member, destined to a position of prominence,\r\nentered the House in 1861, and after he had been there a couple of years\r\nhe wrote to his wife, that “the want of the liberal party of a new man was\r\ngreat, and felt to be great; the old whig leaders were worn out; there\r\nwere no new whigs; Cobden and Bright were impracticable and un-English,\r\nand there were hardly any hopeful radicals. There was a great prize of\r\npower and influence to be aimed at.”(95)\r\n\r\nThis parliamentary situation was the least part of it. No man could guide\r\nthe new advance, now so evidently approaching, unless he clearly united\r\nfervour and capacity for practical improvements in government to broad and\r\nglowing sympathies, alike with the needs and the elemental instincts of\r\nthe labouring mass. Mr. Gladstone offered that wonderful combination. “If\r\never there was a statesman,” said Mill, about this time, “in whom the\r\nspirit of improvement is incarnate, and in whose career as a minister the\r\ncharacteristic feature has been to seek out things that require or admit\r\nof improvement, instead of waiting to be pressed or driven to do them, Mr.\r\nGladstone deserves that signal honour.” Then his point of view was lofty;\r\nhe was keenly alive to the moving forces of the hour; his horizons were\r\nwide; he was always amply founded in facts; he had generous hopes for\r\nmankind; his oratory seized vast popular audiences, because it was the\r\nexpression of a glowing heart and a powerful brain. All this made him a\r\ndemagogue in the same high sense in which Pericles, Demosthenes, John Pym,\r\nPatrick Henry were demagogues.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see some at any rate of the influences that were bringing\r\nMr. Gladstone decisively into harmony with the movement of liberal\r\nopinions, now gradually spreading over Great Britain. The resurrection of\r\nItaly could only be vindicated on principles of liberty and the right of a\r\nnation to choose its own rulers. The peers and the ten-pound householders\r\nwho held power in England were no Bourbon tyrants; but just as in 1830 the\r\noverthrow of the Bourbon line in France was followed by the Reform bill\r\nhere, so the Italian revolution of 1860 gave new vitality to the popular\r\nside in England. Another convulsion, far away from our own shores, was\r\nstill more directly potent alike in quickening popular feeling, and by a\r\nstrange paradox in creating as a great popular leader the very statesman\r\nwho had failed to understand it. It was impossible that a man so vigilant\r\nand so impressionable as Mr. Gladstone was, should escape the influence of\r\nthe American war. Though too late to affect his judgment on the issues of\r\nthe war, he discerned after the event how, in his own language, the wide\r\nparticipation of the people in the choice of their governors, by giving\r\nforce and expression to the national will in the United States, enabled\r\nthe governors thus freely chosen to marshal a power and develop an amount\r\nof energy in the execution of that will, such as probably have never been\r\ndisplayed in an equal time and among an equal number of men since the race\r\nof mankind sprang into existence.(96) In this judgment of the American\r\ncivil war, he only shared in a general result of the salvation of the\r\nUnion; it reversed the fashionable habit of making American institutions\r\nEnglish bugbears, and gave a sweeping impulse to that steady but\r\nresistless tide of liberal and popular sentiment that ended in the\r\nparliamentary reform of 1867.\r\n\r\nThe lesson from the active resolution of America was confirmed by the\r\npassive fortitude of Lancashire. “What are the questions,” Mr. Gladstone\r\nasked in 1864, “that fit a man for the exercise of a privilege such as the\r\nfranchise? Self-command, self-control, respect for order, patience under\r\nsuffering, confidence in the law, regard for superiors; and when, I should\r\nlike to ask, were all these great qualities exhibited in a manner more\r\nsignal, even more illustrious, than in the conduct of the general body of\r\nthe operatives of Lancashire under the profound affliction of the winter\r\nof 1862?” So on two sides the liberal channel was widened and deepened and\r\nthe speed of its currents accelerated.\r\n\r\nBesides large common influences like these, Mr. Gladstone’s special\r\nactivities as a reformer brought him into contact with the conditions of\r\nlife and feeling among the workmen, (M36) and the closer he came to them,\r\nthe more did his humane and sympathetic temper draw him towards their\r\npolitics and the ranks of their party. Looking back, he said, upon the\r\nyears immediately succeeding the fall of Napoleon in 1815, he saw the\r\nreign of ideas that did not at all belong to the old currents of English\r\nhistory, but were a reaction against the excesses of the French\r\nrevolution. This reaction seemed to set up the doctrine that the masses\r\nmust be in standing antagonism to the law, and it resulted in severities\r\nthat well justified antagonism. “To-day the scene was transformed; the\r\nfixed traditional sentiment of the working man had become one of\r\nconfidence in the law, in parliament, even in the executive government.”\r\nIn 1863 he was busy in the erection of the post office savings banks. A\r\ndeputation of a powerful trades union asked him to modify his rules so as\r\nto enable them to place their funds in the hands of the government. A\r\ngeneration before, such confidence would have been inconceivable. In\r\nconnection with the Government Annuities bill a deputation of workmen came\r\nto him, and said, “If there had been any suspicion or disinclination\r\ntowards it on the part of the working classes, it was due to the\r\ndissatisfaction with parliament as to suffrage.” When he replied with\r\nsomething about the alleged indifference and apparent inaction of the\r\nworking classes as to suffrage, they said, “Since the abolition of the\r\ncorn laws we have given up political agitation; we felt we might place\r\nconfidence in parliament; instead of political action, we tried to spend\r\nour evenings in the improvement of our minds.” This convinced him that it\r\nwas not either want of faith in parliament, or indifference to a vote,\r\nthat explained the absence of agitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this stream of new perceptions and new feeling in his mind\r\nwas a declaration that suddenly electrified the political world. A\r\nYorkshire liberal one afternoon (May 11, 1864) brought in a bill for\r\nlowering the franchise, and Mr. Gladstone spoke for the government. He\r\ndwelt upon the facts, historic and political. The parliamentary history of\r\nreform for the thirteen years, since Locke King’s motion in 1851 upset a\r\ngovernment, had been most unsatisfactory, and to set aside all the solemn\r\nand formal declarations from 1851 down to the abortive Reform bill of 1860\r\nwould be a scandal. Then, was not the state of the actual case something\r\nof a scandal, with less than one-tenth of the constituencies composed of\r\nworking men, and with less than one-fiftieth of the working men in\r\npossession of the franchise? How could you defend a system that let in the\r\nlower stratum of the middle class and shut out the upper stratum of the\r\nworking class? In face of such dispositions as the workmen manifested\r\ntowards law, parliament, and government, was it right that the present\r\nsystem of almost entire exclusion should prevail? Then came the sentence\r\nthat, in that stagnant or floundering hour of parliamentary opinion,\r\nmarked a crisis. “I call upon the adversary to show cause, and _I venture\r\nto say that every man who is not presumably incapacitated by some\r\nconsideration of personal unfitness or of political danger, is morally\r\nentitled to come within the pale of the constitution_. Of course, in\r\ngiving utterance to such a proposition, I do not recede from the protest I\r\nhave previously made against sudden, or violent, or excessive, or\r\nintoxicating change.”\r\n\r\nHe concluded in words that covered much ground, though when closely\r\nscrutinised they left large loopholes. “It is well,” he said, “that we\r\nshould be suitably provided with armies and fleets and fortifications; it\r\nis well, too, that all these should rest upon and be sustained, as they\r\nought to be, by a sound system of finance, and out of a revenue not wasted\r\nby a careless parliament or by a profligate administration. But that which\r\nis better and more weighty still is that hearts should be bound together\r\nby a reasonable extension, at fitting times and among _selected_ portions\r\nof the people, of every benefit and every privilege that can be justly\r\nconferred upon them.”\r\n\r\nThe thunderbolt of a sentence about every man’s moral title to a vote\r\nstartled the House with an amazement, half delight and half consternation,\r\nthat broke forth in loud volleys of cheering and counter-cheering. It was\r\nto little (M37) purpose that the orator in the next breath interposed his\r\nqualifications. One of the fated words had been spoken that gather up\r\nwandering forces of time and occasion, and precipitate new eras. A\r\nconservative speaker instantly deplored the absence of the prime minister,\r\nand the substitution in his stead of his “intractable chancellor of the\r\nexchequer.” An important liberal speaker, with equal promptitude, pointed\r\nout that one effect of the speech would be, in the first place, loss of\r\nconservative support to the government, and, in the second place, a very\r\ngreat gain to the health and vigour of the liberal party. Two whigs ran\r\noff to tell Phillimore that Gladstone had said something that would make\r\nhis hair stand on end. Speculations began to hum and buzz whether the\r\noracular deliverance would not upset the government. In the press a\r\ntremendous storm broke. Mr. Gladstone was accused of ministering aliments\r\nto popular turbulence and vanity, of preaching the divine right of\r\nmultitudes, and of encouraging, minister of the crown though he was, a\r\nsweeping and levelling democracy. They charged him with surveying mankind\r\nin the abstract and suffrage in the abstract, and in that kingdom of\r\nshadows discovering or constructing vast universal propositions about\r\nman’s moral rights. Mr. Disraeli told him that he had revived the doctrine\r\nof Tom Paine. The radicals were as jubilant as whigs and tories were\r\nfurious. They declared that the banner he had raised aloft was not what\r\nthe tories denounced as the standard of domestic revolution, but the long\r\nlost flag of the liberal party. “There is not a statesman in England of\r\nthe very first rank,” said one newspaper, “who has dared to say as much,\r\nand Mr. Gladstone, in saying it, has placed himself at the head of the\r\nparty that will succeed the present administration.” This was true, but in\r\nthe meantime the head of the existing administration was still a marvel of\r\nphysical vigour, and though at the moment he was disabled by gout,\r\nsomebody must have hurried to Cambridge House and told him the desperate\r\ntidings. On the very instant he sent down a note of inquiry to Mr.\r\nGladstone, asking what he had really said. A brisk correspondence\r\nfollowed, neither heated nor unfriendly.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Lord Palmerston had written him a premonitory note, not to\r\ncommit himself or the government to any particular figure of borough\r\nfranchise; that a six pound franchise had gone to the bottom; that if they\r\nshould ever have to bring in a reform bill, they ought to be free from\r\nfresh pledges; that the workmen would swamp the classes above them; that\r\ntheir influx would discourage the classes above from voting at all; and\r\nthat the workmen were under the control of trade unions directed by a\r\nsmall number of agitators. All this was the good conservative common form\r\nof the time. The speech itself, when the prime minister came to see it,\r\nproved no sedative.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord Palmerston to Mr. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    _May 12, 1864._—I have read your speech, and I must frankly say,\r\n    with much regret; as there is little in it that I can agree with,\r\n    and much from which I differ. You lay down broadly the doctrine of\r\n    universal suffrage which I can never accept. I entirely deny that\r\n    every sane and not disqualified man has a moral right to a vote. I\r\n    use that expression instead of “the pale of the constitution,”\r\n    because I hold that all who enjoy the security and civil rights\r\n    which the constitution provides are within its pale. What every\r\n    man and woman too has a right to, is to be well governed and under\r\n    just laws, and they who propose a change ought to show that the\r\n    present organisation does not accomplish those objects....\r\n\r\n    You did not pronounce an opinion in favour of a specified\r\n    franchise; but is there any essential difference between naming a\r\n    six pound franchise and naming the additional numbers which a six\r\n    pound franchise was calculated to admit? I am not going to perform\r\n    the duty which Whiteside assigned to me of answering your speech,\r\n    but, if you will not take it amiss, I would say, that it was more\r\n    like the sort of speech with which Bright would have introduced\r\n    the Reform bill which he would like to propose, than the sort of\r\n    speech which might have been expected from the treasury bench in\r\n    the present state of things. Your speech may win Lancashire for\r\n    you, though that is doubtful, but I fear it will tend to lose\r\n    England for you.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Gladstone to Lord Palmerston._\r\n\r\n    _11 Carlton House Terrace, May 13, 1864._—It is not easy to take\r\n    ill anything that proceeds from you; and, moreover, frankness\r\n    between all men, and especially between those who are politically\r\n    associated, removes, as I believe, many more difficulties than it\r\n    causes. In this spirit I will endeavour to write. I agree in your\r\n    denial “that every sane and not disqualified man has a moral right\r\n    to vote.” But I am at a loss to know how, as you have read my\r\n    speech, you can ascribe this opinion to me. My declaration was,\r\n    taken generally, that all persons ought to be admitted to the\r\n    franchise, who can be admitted to it with safety.... I hold by\r\n    this proposition. It seems to me neither strange, nor new, nor\r\n    extreme. It requires, I admit, to be construed; but I contend that\r\n    the interpretation is amply given in the speech, where I have\r\n    declared (for example) that the admission I desire is of the same\r\n    character or rather extent as was proposed in 1860.... I have\r\n    never exhorted the working man to agitate for the franchise, and I\r\n    am at a loss to conceive what report of my speech can have been\r\n    construed by you in such a sense.\r\n\r\n    Having said this much to bring down to its true limits the\r\n    difference between us, I do not deny that difference. I regret it,\r\n    and I should regret it much more if it were likely to have (at\r\n    least as far as I can see) an early bearing upon practice. In the\r\n    cabinet I argued as strongly as I could against the withdrawal of\r\n    the bill in 1860, and in favour of taking the opinion of the House\r\n    of Commons upon that bill. I think the party which supports your\r\n    government has suffered, and is suffering, and will much more\r\n    seriously suffer, from the part which as a party it has played\r\n    within these recent years, in regard to the franchise. I have no\r\n    desire to press the question forward. I hope no government will\r\n    ever again take it up except with the full knowledge of its own\r\n    mind and a reasonable probability of carrying it. But such\r\n    influence as argument and statement without profession of\r\n    political intentions can exercise upon the public mind, I heartily\r\n    desire to see exercised in favour of extension of the\r\n    franchise....\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day Lord Palmerston wrote to him, “I have no doubt that\r\nyou have yourself heard a great deal about the bad effect of your speech,\r\nbut I can assure you that I hear from many quarters the unfavourable\r\nimpression it has produced even upon many of the liberal party, and upon\r\nall persons who value the maintenance of our institutions.”\r\n\r\nTo others, Mr. Gladstone wrote in less formal style, for instance to an\r\neminent nonconformist minister: “May 14. I have unwarily, it seems, set\r\nthe Thames on fire. But I have great hopes that the Thames will, on\r\nreflection perceive that he had no business or title to catch the flame,\r\nand will revert to his ordinary temperature accordingly.” And to his\r\nbrother Robertson, he writes from Brighton, three days later:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Many thanks for all you say respecting my speech on the franchise\r\n    bill. I have been astounded to find it the cause or occasion of\r\n    such a row. It would have been quite as intelligible to me had\r\n    people said, “Under the exceptions of personal unfitness and\r\n    political danger you exclude or may exclude almost everybody, and\r\n    you reduce your declaration to a shadow.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the diary he says: “_May 11._—Spoke on the franchise bill. Some\r\nsensation. It appears to me that it was due less to me, than to the change\r\nin the hearers and in the public mind from the professions at least if not\r\nthe principles of 1859.” Much against Lord Palmerston’s wish, the speech\r\nwas published, with a short preface that even staunch friends like\r\nPhillimore found obscure and not well written.\r\n\r\n(M38) An address, significant of the general feeling in the unenfranchised\r\nclasses, was presented to him from the workmen of York a month after his\r\nspeech in parliament. They recalled his services to free trade when he\r\nstood by the side of Peel; his budget of 1860; his conspicuous and\r\nhonourable share in abolishing the taxes on knowledge. “We have marked,”\r\nthey said, “your manifestations of sympathy with the down-trodden and\r\noppressed of every clime. You have advanced the cause of freedom in\r\nforeign lands by the power and courage with which you have assailed and\r\nexposed the misdeeds and cruelties of continental tyrants. To the\r\nprovident operative you have by your Post Office Savings Bank bill given\r\nsecurity for his small savings, and your Government Annuities bill of this\r\nsession is a measure which will stimulate the people to greater thrift and\r\nforethought. These acts, together with your speeches on the last named,\r\nand on the Borough Franchise bill, make up a life that commands our\r\nlasting gratitude.” Such was the new popular estimate of him. In framing\r\nhis reply to this address Mr. Gladstone did his best to discourage the\r\nrepetition of like performances from other places; he submitted the draft\r\nto Lord Palmerston, and followed his advice in omitting certain portions\r\nof it. It was reduced to the conventional type of such acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1864 Mr. Gladstone made a series of speeches in his\r\nnative county, which again showed the sincerity and the simplicity of his\r\nsolicitude for the masses of his countrymen. The sentiment is common. Mr.\r\nDisraeli and the Young Englanders had tried to inscribe it upon a party\r\nbanner twenty years before. But Mr. Gladstone had given proof that he knew\r\nhow to embody sentiment in acts of parliament, and he associated it with\r\nthe broadest ideas of citizenship and policy. These speeches were not a\r\nmanifesto or a programme; they were a survey of the principles of the\r\nstatesmanship that befitted the period.\r\n\r\nAt Bolton (Oct. 11) he discoursed to audiences of the working class upon\r\nthe progress of thirty years, with such freshness of spirit as awoke\r\nenergetic hopes of the progress for the thirty years that were to follow.\r\nThe next day he opened a park with words from the heart about the modern\r\nsense of the beauties of nature. The Greeks, he said, however much beauty\r\nthey might have discerned in nature, had no sympathy with the delight in\r\ndetached natural objects—a tree, or a stream, or a hill—which was so often\r\npart of the common life of the poorest Englishman. Even a century or less\r\nago “communion with nature” would have sounded an affected and unnatural\r\nphrase. Now it was a sensible part of the life of the working classes.\r\nThen came moralising, at that date less trite than it has since become,\r\nabout the social ties that ought to mark the relations between master and\r\nworkman.\r\n\r\n(M39) The same night at a banquet in Liverpool, and two days later at\r\nManchester, he advanced to high imperial ground. He told them how, after\r\nan experience now becoming long, the one standing pain to the political\r\nman in England is a sense of the inequality of his best exertions to the\r\narduous duty of government and legislation. England had undertaken\r\nresponsibilities of empire such as never before lay on the shoulders or\r\nthe minds of men. We governed distant millions many times outnumbering\r\nourselves. We were responsible for the welfare of forty or forty-five\r\nseparate states. Again, what other nation was charged with the same\r\nresponsibility in the exercise of its moral influence abroad, in the\r\nexample it is called upon to set, in the sympathy it must feel with the\r\ncause of right and justice and constitutional freedom wherever that cause\r\nis at issue? As for our fellow subjects abroad, we had given them\r\npractical freedom. It was our duty to abstain as far as may be from\r\ninterference with their affairs, to afford them the shelter and protection\r\nof the empire, and at the same time to impress upon them that there is no\r\ngrosser mistake in politics than to suppose you can separate the blessings\r\nand benefits of freedom from its burdens. In other words, the colonies\r\nshould pay their own way, and if the old dream of making their interests\r\nsubservient to those of the mother country had passed away, it was just as\r\nlittle reasonable that the mother country should bear charges that in\r\nequity belonged to them, and all the more if the colonies set up against\r\nthe industry and productions of England the mischiefs and obstructions of\r\nan exploded protective system. On foreign policy he enforced the\r\nprinciples that, after all, had given to Europe forty years of peace, and\r\nto England forty years of diplomatic authority and pre-eminence. “It is\r\nimpossible that to a country like England the affairs of foreign nations\r\ncan ever be indifferent. It is impossible that England, in my opinion,\r\never should forswear the interest she must naturally feel in the cause of\r\ntruth, of justice, of order, and of good government.” The final word was\r\nan admonition against “political lethargy.” For the first time, I think,\r\nhe put into the forefront the tormenting question that was to haunt him to\r\nthe end. “They could not look at Ireland,” he told them, “and say that the\r\nstate of feeling there was for the honour and the advantage of the united\r\nkingdom.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 14, ’64._—So ended in peace an exhausting, flattering, I\r\n    hope not intoxicating circuit. God knows I have not courted them.\r\n    I hope I do not rest on them. I pray I may turn them to account\r\n    for good. It is, however, impossible not to love the people from\r\n    whom such manifestations come, as meet me in every quarter....\r\n    Somewhat haunted by dreams of halls, and lines of people, and\r\n    great assemblies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was observed of this Lancashire tour, by critics who hardly meant to\r\npraise him, that he paid his hearers the high compliment of assuming that\r\nthey could both understand his arguments, and feel his appeal to their\r\nmoral sympathies. His speeches, men said, were in fact lay sermons of a\r\nhigh order, as skilfully composed, as accurately expressed, as if they\r\nwere meant for the House of Commons. This was singularly true, and what an\r\neulogy it was for our modern British democracy that the man whom they made\r\ntheir first great hero was an orator of such a school. Lord Lyttelton, his\r\nbrother-in-law, informed him of the alarm and odium that his new line of\r\npolicy was raising. Mr. Gladstone (April, 1865) replied: “After all, you\r\nare a peer, and Peel used to say, speaking of his peer colleagues, that\r\nthey were beings of a different order. Please to recollect that we have\r\ngot to govern millions of hard hands; that it must be done by force,\r\nfraud, or good will; that the latter has been tried and is answering; that\r\nnone have profited more by this change of system since the corn law and\r\nthe Six Acts, than those who complain of it. As to their misliking me, I\r\nhave no fault to find with them for that. It is the common lot in similar\r\ncircumstances, and the very things that I have done or omitted doing from\r\nmy extreme and almost irrational reluctance to part company with them,\r\nbecome an aggravation when the parting is accomplished.” “Gladstone, I\r\nthink,” says Bishop Wilberforce (Dec. 7), “is certainly gaining power. You\r\nhear now almost every one say he must be the future premier, and such\r\nsayings tend greatly to accomplish themselves.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M40) It was about this time that Mr. Gladstone first found himself\r\ndrawing to relations with the protestant dissenters, that were destined to\r\ngrow closer as years went on. These relations had no small share in the\r\nextension of his public power; perhaps, too, no small share in the more\r\nabiding work upon the dissenters themselves, of enlarging what was narrow,\r\nsoftening what was hard and bitter, and promoting a healing union where\r\nthe existence of a church establishment turned ecclesiastical differences\r\ninto lines of social division. He had alarmed his friends by his action on\r\na measure (April 15, 1863) for remedying an old grievance about the burial\r\nof dissenters. Having served on a select committee appointed in the rather\r\nquixotic hope that a solution of the difficulty might be found by the\r\nsomewhat unparliamentary means of “friendly conversation among candid and\r\nimpartial men,” he had convinced himself that there was a wrong to be set\r\nright, and he voted and spoke accordingly. “It will most rudely shake his\r\nOxford seat,” says Phillimore. The peril there was becoming daily more\r\napparent. Then in 1864 and on later occasions he met leading nonconformist\r\nclergy at the house of Mr. Newman Hall—such men as Binney, Allon, Edward\r\nWhite, Baldwin Brown, Henry Reynolds, and that most admirable friend,\r\ncitizen, and man, R.W. Dale, so well known as Dale of Birmingham. Their\r\ngeneral attitude was described by Mr. Newman Hall as this: they hoped for\r\nthe ultimate recognition of the free church theory, and meditated no\r\npolitical action to bring it about; they looked for it to come as the\r\nresult of influence within the church of England, not of efforts from\r\nwithout. “Many dissenters,” one of them told him (Nov. 20, 1864), “would\r\nenter the church whatever their theory about establishment, if such slight\r\nmodifications were made as would allow them to do so\r\nconscientiously—holding the essentials of the faith far more soundly than\r\nmany within the established church.” Another regretted, after one of these\r\ngatherings, that they never got to the core of the subject, “namely that\r\nthere run through the prayer-book from beginning to end ideas that are not\r\naccepted by numbers who subscribe, and which cannot _all_ be admitted by\r\nany one.”\r\n\r\nAll this once more brought Mr. Gladstone into a curious position. Just as\r\nat Oxford he had in 1847 been the common hope of ultra-clericals on one\r\nhand and ultra-liberals on the other, so now he was the common hope of the\r\ntwo antagonistic schools of religious comprehension—the right, who looked\r\ntowards the formularies, system, discipline, and tradition either of the\r\nOrthodox church or the Latin, and the left, who sought reunion on the\r\nbasis of puritanism with a leaven of modern criticism. Always the devoted\r\nfriend of Dr. Pusey and his school, he was gradually welcomed as ally and\r\npolitical leader by men like Dale and Allon, the independents, and\r\nSpurgeon, the baptist, on the broad ground that it was possible for all\r\ngood men to hold, amid their differences about church government, the more\r\nvital sympathies and charities of their common profession. They even\r\nsounded him on one occasion about laying the foundation stone of one of\r\ntheir chapels. The broad result of such intercourse of the nonconformist\r\nleaders with this powerful and generous mind, enriched by historic\r\nknowledge and tradition, strengthened by high political responsibility,\r\ndeepened by meditations long, strenuous, and systematic, was indeed\r\nremarkable. Dr. Allon expressed it, with admirable point, in a letter to\r\nhim some fourteen years after our present date (April 15, 1878):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The kind of intercourse that you have kindly permitted with\r\n    nonconformists, has helped more consciously to identify them with\r\n    movements of national life, and to diminish the stern feeling of\r\n    almost defiant witness-bearing that was strong a generation or two\r\n    ago. It is something gained if ecclesiastical and political\r\n    differences can he debated within a common circle of social\r\n    confidence and identity.... Their confidence in you has made them\r\n    amenable to your lead in respect of methods and movements needing\r\n    the guidance of political insight and experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nA man’s mind seldom moves forward towards light and freedom on a single\r\nline, and in Mr. Gladstone’s case the same impulses that made him tolerant\r\nof formal differences as to church government led slowly to a still wider\r\nliberality in respect of far deeper differences. Readers may remember the\r\nshock with which in his youth he found that one person or another was a\r\nUnitarian. To Mr. Darbishire, a member of the Unitarian body who was for\r\nmany years his friend, he wrote about some address of James Martineau’s\r\n(Dec. 21, 1862):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    From, time to time I have read works of Mr. Martineau’s, or works\r\n    that I have taken for his, with great admiration, with warm\r\n    respect for the writer, and moreover, with a great deal of\r\n    sympathy. I should greatly like to make his acquaintance. But\r\n    attached as I am to the old Christian dogma, and believing it as I\r\n    do, or rather believing the Person whom it sets forth, to be the\r\n    real fountain of all the gifts and graces that are largely strewn\r\n    over society, and in which Mr. Martineau himself seems so amply to\r\n    share, I fear I am separated from him in the order of ideas by an\r\n    interval that must be called a gulf. My conviction is that the old\r\n    creeds have been, and are to be, the channel by which the\r\n    Christian religion is made a reality even for many who do not hold\r\n    it, and I think that when we leave them we shall leave them not\r\n    for something better, but something worse. Hence you will not be\r\n    surprised that I regard some of Mr. Martineau’s propositions as\r\n    unhistorical and untrue.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd to the same gentleman a year or two later (Jan. 2, 1865):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am sorry to say I have not yet been able to read Mr. Martineau’s\r\n    sermon, which I mean to do with care. I am, as you know, one\r\n    altogether attached to dogma, which I believe to be the skeleton\r\n    that carries the flesh, the blood, the life of the blessed thing\r\n    we call the Christian religion. But I do not believe that God’s\r\n    tender mercies are restricted to a small portion of the human\r\n    family. I dare not be responsible for Dr. Newman, nor would he\r\n    thank me; but I hope he does not so believe, and this the more\r\n    because I have lately been reading Dr. Manning’s letter to Dr.\r\n    Pusey; and, though Dr. Manning is far more exaggerated in his\r\n    religion than Dr. Newman, and seems to me almost to caricature it,\r\n    yet I think even he has by no means that limited view of the\r\n    mercies of God.\r\n\r\n    I have no mental difficulty in reconciling a belief in the Church,\r\n    and what may be called the high Christian doctrine, with that\r\n    comforting persuasion that those who do not receive the greatest\r\n    blessings (and each man must believe his religion to be greatest)\r\n    are notwithstanding the partakers, each in his measure, of other\r\n    gifts, and will be treated according to their use of them. I admit\r\n    there are schools of Christians who think otherwise. I was myself\r\n    brought up to think otherwise, and to believe that salvation\r\n    depended absolutely upon the reception of a particular and a very\r\n    narrow creed. But long, long have I cast those weeds behind me.\r\n    Unbelief may in given conditions be a moral offence; and only as\r\n    such, only like other disobedience, and on like principles, can it\r\n    be punishable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo not a few the decisive change in Mr. Gladstone’s mental history is the\r\nchange from the “very narrow creed” of his youth to the “high Christian\r\ndoctrine” of his after life. Still more will regard as the real transition\r\nthe attainment of this “comforting persuasion,” this last word of\r\nbenignity and tolerance. Here we are on the foundations. Tolerance is far\r\nmore than the abandonment of civil usurpations over conscience. It is a\r\nlesson often needed quite as much in the hearts of a minority as of a\r\nmajority. Tolerance means reverence for all the possibilities of Truth; it\r\nmeans acknowledgment that she dwells in diverse mansions, and wears\r\nvesture of many colours, and speaks in strange tongues; it means frank\r\nrespect for freedom of indwelling conscience against mechanic forms,\r\nofficial conventions, social force; it means the charity that is greater\r\nthan even faith and hope. Marked is the day for a man when he can truly\r\nsay, as Mr. Gladstone here said, “Long, long have I cast those weeds\r\nbehind me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX. Defeat At Oxford—Death Of Lord Palmerston—Parliamentary\r\nLeadership. (1865)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In public life a man of elevated mind does not make his own self\r\n    tell upon others simply and entirely. He must act with other men;\r\n    he cannot select his objects, or pursue them by means\r\n    unadulterated by the methods and practices of minds less elevated\r\n    than his own. He can only do what he feels to be second-best. He\r\n    labours at a venture, prosecuting measures so large or so\r\n    complicated that their ultimate issue is uncertain.—CARDINAL\r\n    NEWMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe faithful steward is a chartered bore alike of the mimic and the\r\nworking stage; the rake and spendthrift carries all before him. Nobody\r\nknew better than Mr. Gladstone that of all the parts in public life, the\r\nteasing and economising drudge is the most thankless. The public only half\r\napprehends, or refuses to apprehend at all; his spending colleagues\r\nnaturally fight; colleagues who do not spend, have other business and\r\nprize a quiet life. All this made Mr. Gladstone’s invincible tenacity as\r\nguardian of the national accounts the more genuinely heroic. In a long\r\nletter from Balmoral, in the October of 1864, he began what was destined\r\nto be the closing battle of the six years’ war. To Mrs. Gladstone he\r\nwrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have fired off to-day my letter to Lord Palmerston about\r\n    expenditure. For a long time, though I did not let myself worry by\r\n    needlessly thinking about it, I have had it lying on me like a\r\n    nightmare. I mean it to be moderate (I shall have the copy when we\r\n    meet to show you), but unless he concurs it may lead to\r\n    consequences between this time and February. What is really\r\n    painful is to believe that he will not agree unless through\r\n    apprehension, his own leanings and desires being in favour of a\r\n    large and not a moderate expenditure....\r\n\r\n\r\nFigures, details, points, were varied, but the issue was in essence the\r\nsame, and the end was much the same. Lord Palmerston took his stand on the\r\ndemands of public opinion. He insisted (Oct. 19) that anybody who looked\r\ncarefully at the signs of the times must see that there were at present\r\ntwo strong feelings in the national mind—the one a disinclination to\r\norganic changes in our representative system, the other a steady\r\ndetermination that the country should be placed and kept in an efficient\r\ncondition of defence. He pointed to the dead indifference of the workmen\r\nthemselves to their own enfranchisement as evidence of the one, and to the\r\nvolunteer movement as evidence of the other.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone rejoined that it was Lord Palmerston’s personal popularity,\r\nand not the conviction or desire of the nation, that kept up estimates.\r\nPalmerston retorted that this was to mistake cause and effect. “If I have\r\nin any degree been fortunate enough to have obtained some share of the\r\ngoodwill and confidence of my fellow-countrymen, it has been because I\r\nhave rightly understood the feelings and opinion of the nation.... You may\r\ndepend upon it that any degree of popularity that is worth having can be\r\nobtained only by such means, and of that popularity I sincerely wish you\r\nthe most ample share.” The strain was severe:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 1, 1864._—I still feel much mental lassitude, and not only\r\n    shrink from public business, but from hard books. It is uphill\r\n    work. _Oct. 21._—A pamphlet letter from Lord Palmerston about\r\n    defence holds out a dark prospect. _Oct. 22._—Wrote, late in the\r\n    day, my reply to Lord Palmerston in a rather decisive tone, for I\r\n    feel conscious of right and of necessity.\r\n\r\n    _To Mrs. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 9._—After more than a fortnight’s delay, I received\r\n    yesterday evening the enclosed very unfavourable letter from Lord\r\n    Palmerston. I send with it the draft of my reply. Please to return\r\n    them to-morrow by Willy—for they ought not to be even for that\r\n    short time out of my custody, but I do not like to keep you in the\r\n    dark. I suppose the matter may now stand over as far as debate is\r\n    concerned until next month, or even till the middle of January. I\r\n    fear you will not have much time for reading or writing to-morrow\r\n    before you start for Chatsworth.\r\n\r\n    This _sort_ of controversy keeps the nerves too highly strung. I\r\n    am more afraid of running away than of holding my ground. But I do\r\n    not quite forget how plentifully I am blessed and sustained, and\r\n    how mercifully spared other and sorer trials.\r\n\r\n    To-morrow comes the supper of the St. Martin’s Volunteers; and\r\n    after that I hope to close my lips until February. The scene last\r\n    night(97) was very different from that of Monday; but very\r\n    remarkable, and even more enthusiastic. I was the only layman\r\n    among five hundred lawyers; and it made me, wickedly, think of my\r\n    position when locked alone in the Naples gaol.\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 19, 1865._—The cabinet has been to-day almost as rough as\r\n    any of the roughest times. In regard to the navy estimates, I have\r\n    had no effective or broad support; platoon-firing more or less in\r\n    my sense from Argyll and Gibson, four or five were silent, the\r\n    rest hostile. Probably they will appoint a committee of cabinet,\r\n    and we may work through, but on the other hand we may not. My\r\n    _opinion_ is manifestly in a minority; but there is an\r\n    unwillingness to have a row. I am not well able to write about\r\n    other things—these batterings are sore work, but I must go\r\n    through. C. Paget and Childers hold their ground.\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 28._—The morning went fast but wretchedly. Seldom, thank\r\n    God, have I a day to which I could apply this epithet. Last night\r\n    I could have done almost anything to shut out the thought of the\r\n    coming battle. This is very weak, but it is the effects of the\r\n    constant recurrence of these things. Estimates always settled at\r\n    the dagger’s point.—(_Diary._)\r\n\r\n    _Osborne, Jan. 31._—I hope you got my note last night. The weather\r\n    here is mild, and I sit with open window while writing. The Queen\r\n    and Princess both ask about you abundantly. I have been most\r\n    pertinacious about seeing the baby prince. I tried to make the\r\n    request twice to the Princess, but I think she did not understand\r\n    my words. Determined not to be beat, I applied to the Prince, who\r\n    acceded with glee, but I don’t know what will come of it. He\r\n    talked with good sense last night about Greece, Ionian Islands,\r\n    and Canada; and I was his partner at whist. We came off quits. I\r\n    dined last night, and also saw the Queen before dinner, but only\r\n    for a quarter of an hour or so. She talked about Japan and Lord\r\n    Palmerston, but there was not time to get into swing, and nothing\r\n    said of nearer matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sort of success that awaited his strenuous endeavour has been already\r\nindicated.(98)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring Mr. Gladstone made the first advance upon what was to be an\r\nimportant journey. All through February and March he worked with\r\nPhillimore and others upon the question of the Irish church. The thing was\r\ndelicate, for his constituency would undoubtedly be adverse. His advisers\r\nresolved that he should speak on a certain motion from a radical below the\r\ngangway, to the effect that the present position of the Irish church\r\nestablishment was unsatisfactory, and called for the early attention of\r\nthe government. It is hard to imagine two propositions on the merits more\r\nindisputable, but a parliamentary resolution is not to be judged by its\r\nverbal contents only. Dillwyn’s motion was known to mean disestablishment\r\nand nothing less. In that view, Mr. Gladstone wrote a short but pregnant\r\nletter to Phillimore—and this too meant disestablishment and nothing less.\r\nIt was the first tolerably definite warning of what was to be one of the\r\ntwo or three greatest legislative acts of his career.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Robert Phillimore._\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 13, 1865._—I would treat the Irish church, as a religious\r\n    body, with the same respect and consideration as the church of\r\n    England, and would apply to it the same liberal policy as regards\r\n    its freedom of action. But I am not loyal to it as an\r\n    establishment. It exists, and is virtually almost unchallenged as\r\n    to its existence in that capacity; it may long (I cannot quite say\r\n    long may it) outlive me; I will never be a party, knowingly, to\r\n    what I may call frivolous acts of disturbance, nor to the\r\n    premature production of schemes of change: but still comes back\r\n    the refrain of my song: “_I am not loyal to it as an\r\n    Establishment._” I could not renew the votes and speeches of\r\n    thirty years back. A quarter of a century of not only fair but\r\n    exceptionally fair trial has wholly dispelled hopes to which they\r\n    had relation; and I am bound to say I look upon its present form\r\n    of existence as no more favourable to religion, in any sense of\r\n    the word, than it is to civil justice and to the contentment and\r\n    loyalty of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston got wind of the forthcoming speech, and wrote a short\r\nadmonitory note. He had heard that Mr. Gladstone was about to set forth\r\nhis views as an individual, and not as a member of the government, and\r\nthis was a distinction that he reckoned impracticable. Was it possible for\r\na member of a government speaking from the treasury bench so to sever\r\nhimself from the body corporate to which he belonged, as to be able to\r\nexpress decided opinions as an individual, and leave himself free to act\r\nupon different opinions, or abstain from acting on those opinions, when\r\nrequired to act as a member of the government taking part in the divisions\r\nof the body? And again, if his opinions happened not to be accepted by a\r\ncolleague on the same bench, would not the colleague have either to\r\nacquiesce, or else to state in what respect his own opinion differed? In\r\nthis case would not differences in a government be unnecessarily and\r\nprematurely forced upon the public? All this was the sound doctrine of\r\ncabinet government. Mr. Gladstone, replying, felt that “he could not as a\r\nminister, and as member for Oxford, allow the subject to be debated an\r\nindefinite number of times and remain silent.” His indictment of the Irish\r\nchurch was decisive. At the same time he was careful to explain in public\r\ncorrespondence that the question was out of all bearing on the practical\r\npolitics of the day. Meanwhile, as spokesman for the government, Mr.\r\nGladstone deprecated the responsibility of raising great questions at a\r\ntime when they could not be seriously approached. One acute observer who\r\nknew him well, evidently took a different view of the practical politics\r\nof the day, or at any rate, of the morrow. Manning wrote to Mr. Gladstone\r\ntwo days after the speech was made and begged to be allowed to see him: “I\r\nread your speech on the Irish church, which set me musing and forecasting.\r\nIt was a real grapple with the question.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M41) Not many days after this speech Cobden died. To his brother,\r\nRobertson, Mr. Gladstone wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 5._—What a sad, sad loss is this death of Cobden. I feel in\r\n    miniature the truth of what Bright well said yesterday—ever since\r\n    I really came to know him, I have held him in high esteem and\r\n    regard as well as admiration; but till he died I did not know how\r\n    high it was. I do not know that I have ever seen in public life a\r\n    character more truly simple, noble, and unselfish. His death will\r\n    make an echo through the world, which in its entireness he has\r\n    served so well.\r\n\r\n    _April 7._—To Mr. Cobden’s funeral at W. Lavington. Afterwards to\r\n    his home, which I was anxious to know. Also I saw Mrs. Cobden. The\r\n    day was lovely, the scenery most beautiful and soothing, the whole\r\n    sad and impressive. Bright broke down at the grave. Cobden’s name\r\n    is great; it will be greater.—(_Diary._)\r\n\r\n\r\nA few months before this Mr. Gladstone had lost a friend more intimate.\r\nThe death of the Duke of Newcastle, he says (Oct. 19, 1864), “severs the\r\nvery last of those contemporaries who were also my political friends. How\r\nit speaks to me ‘Be doing, and be done.’ ”\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Mrs. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 19._—Dr. Kingsley sent me a telegram to inform me of the sad\r\n    event at Clumber; but it only arrived two hours before the papers,\r\n    though the death happened last night. So that brave heart has at\r\n    last ceased to beat. Certainly in him more than in any one I have\r\n    known, was exhibited the character of our life as a dispensation\r\n    of pain. This must ever be a mystery, for we cannot see the\r\n    working-out of the purposes of God. Yet in his case I have always\r\n    thought some glimpse of them seemed to be permitted. It is well to\r\n    be permitted also to believe that he is now at rest for ever, and\r\n    that the cloud is at length removed from his destiny.\r\n\r\n    _Clumber, Oct. 26._—It is a time and a place to feel, if one could\r\n    feel. He died in the room where we have been sitting before and\r\n    after dinner—where, thirty-two years ago, a stripling, I came over\r\n    from Newark in fear and trembling to see the duke, his father;\r\n    where a stiff horseshoe semi-circle then sat round the fire in\r\n    evenings; where that rigour melted away in Lady Lincoln’s time;\r\n    where she and her mother sang so beautifully at the pianoforte, in\r\n    the same place where it now stands. The house is full of local\r\n    memories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 6 (1865) parliament was dissolved. Four years before, Mr.\r\nGladstone had considered the question of retaining or abandoning the seat\r\nfor the university. It was in contemplation to give a third member to the\r\nsouthern division of Lancashire, and, in July 1861, he received a\r\nrequisition begging his assent to nomination there, signed by nearly 8000\r\nof the electors—a number that seemed to make success certain. His letters\r\nto Dr. Pusey and others show how strongly he inclined to comply. Flesh and\r\nblood shrank from perpetual strife, he thought, and after four contested\r\nelections in fourteen years at Oxford, he asked himself whether he should\r\nnot escape the prolongation of the series. He saw, as he said, that they\r\nmeant to make it a life-battle, like the old famous college war between\r\nBentley and the fellows of Trinity. But he felt his deep obligation to his\r\nOxford supporters, and was honourably constrained again to bear their\r\nflag. In the same month of 1861 he had declined absolutely to stand for\r\nLondon in the place of Lord John Russell.\r\n\r\nAt Oxford the tories this time had secured an excellent candidate in Mr.\r\nGathorne Hardy, a man of sterling character, a bold and capable debater, a\r\ngood man of business, one of the best of Lord Derby’s lieutenants. The\r\nelection was hard fought, like most of the four that had gone before it.\r\nThe educated residents were for the chancellor of the exchequer, as they\r\nhad always been, and he had both liberals and high churchmen on his side.\r\nOne feature was novel, the power of sending votes by post. Mr. Gladstone\r\nhad not been active in the House against this change, but only bestowed\r\nupon it a parting malediction. It strengthened the clerical vote, and as\r\nsympathy with disestablishment was thrust prominently forward against Mr.\r\nGladstone, the new privilege cost him his seat. From the first day things\r\nlooked ill, and when on the last day (July 18) the battle ended, he was\r\none hundred and eighty votes behind Mr. Hardy.(99)\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 16, ’65._—Always in straits the Bible in church supplies my\r\n    needs. To-day it was in the 1st lesson, Jer. i. 19, “And they\r\n    shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee,\r\n    for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.”\r\n\r\n    _July 17._—Again came consolation to me in the Psalms—86:16; it\r\n    did the same for me April 17, 1853. At night arrived the telegram\r\n    announcing my defeat at Oxford as virtually accomplished. A dear\r\n    dream is dispelled. God’s will be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M42) His valedictory address was both graceful and sincere: “After an\r\narduous connection of eighteen years, I bid you respectfully farewell. My\r\nearnest purpose to serve you, my many faults and shortcomings, the\r\nincidents of the political relation between the university and myself,\r\nestablished in 1847, so often questioned in vain, and now, at length,\r\nfinally dissolved, I leave to the judgment of the future. It is one\r\nimperative duty, and one alone, which induces me to trouble you with these\r\nfew parting words—the duty of expressing my profound and lasting gratitude\r\nfor indulgence as generous, and for support as warm and enthusiastic in\r\nitself, and as honourable from the character and distinctions of those who\r\nhave given it, as has in my belief ever been accorded by any constituency\r\nto any representative.”\r\n\r\nHe was no sooner assured of his repulse at Oxford, than he started for the\r\nLancashire constituency, where a nomination had been reserved for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 18._—Went off at eleven ... to the Free Trade Hall which was\r\n    said to have 6000 people. They were in unbounded enthusiasm. I\r\n    spoke for 1-1/4 hr., and when the meeting concluded went off to\r\n    Liverpool.... Another meeting of 5000 at the Amphitheatre, if\r\n    possible more enthusiastic than that at Manchester.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fine hall that stands upon the site made historic by the militant\r\nfree-traders, he used a memorable phrase. “At last, my friends,” he began,\r\n“I am come among you, and I am come among you ‘unmuzzled.’ ” The audience\r\nquickly realised the whole strength of the phrase, and so did the people\r\nof the country when it reached them. Then he opened a high magnanimous\r\nexordium about the Oxford that had cast him out. The same evening at\r\nLiverpool, he again dwelt on the desperate fondness with which he had\r\nclung to the university seat, but rapidly passed to the contrast. “I come\r\ninto South Lancashire, and find here around me different phenomena. I find\r\nthe development of industry. I find the growth of enterprise. I find the\r\nprogress of social philanthropy. I find the prevalence of toleration. I\r\nfind an ardent desire for freedom. If there be one duty more than another\r\nincumbent upon the public men of England, it is to establish and maintain\r\nharmony between the past of our glorious history and the future that is\r\nstill in store for her.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 20._—Robertson and I went in early and polled. He was known,\r\n    and I through him, and we had a scene of great popular enthusiasm.\r\n    We then followed the polls as the returns came in, apparently\r\n    triumphant, but about midday it appeared that the figures of both\r\n    parties were wrong, ours the worst. Instead of being well and\r\n    increasingly at the head I was struggling with Egerton at 1 P.M.,\r\n    and Turner gaining on me.... Off to Chester. In the evening the\r\n    figures of the close came in and gave me the second place. The\r\n    volunteers in the park cheered loudly, the church bells rung, the\r\n    people came down with a band and I had to address them.\r\n\r\n    _To the Duchess of Sutherland._\r\n\r\n    I am by far too sorry about Oxford to feel the slightest\r\n    temptation to be angry, even were there cause. I only feel that I\r\n    love her better than ever. There is great enthusiasm here,\r\n    stimulated no doubt by the rejection. I have just been polling\r\n    amid fervid demonstrations. The first return at nine o’clock—but\r\n    you will know all when this reaches you—is as follows.... This of\r\n    course says little as to the final issue. Ten o’clock. My majority\r\n    so far increases, the others diminish. But it is hard running.\r\n    Eleven. My majority increases, the others diminish. Egerton is\r\n    second. One of our men third. Twelve thousand four hundred have\r\n    polled. My seat looks well.\r\n\r\n    I interrupt here to say you would have been _pleased_ had you\r\n    heard Willy, at a moment’s notice, on Tuesday night, address five\r\n    thousand people no one of whom had ever seen him; he was (forgive\r\n    me) so modest, so manly, _so ready_, so judicious.\r\n\r\n    Since writing thus far everything has been overset in a chaos of\r\n    conflicting reports. They will all be cleared up for you before\r\n    this comes. I hope I am not in a fool’s paradise. All I yet know\r\n    is an apparently hard fight between Egerton and me for the head of\r\n    the poll, but my seat tolerably secure. I have had _such_ letters!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the votes were counted Mr. Gladstone was third upon the poll, and so\r\nsecured the seat, with two tory colleagues above him.(100)\r\n\r\nThe spirit in which Mr. Gladstone took a defeat that was no mere\r\nelectioneering accident, but the landmark of a great severance in his\r\nextraordinary career, is shown in his replies to multitudes of\r\ncorrespondents. On the side of his tenacious and affectionate attachment\r\nto Oxford, the wound was deep. On the other side, emancipation from\r\nfetters and from contests that he regarded as ungenerous, was a profound\r\nrelief. But the relief touched him less than the sorrow.\r\n\r\nManning wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Few men have been watching you more than I have in these last\r\n    days; and I do not know that I could wish you any other result.\r\n    But you have entered upon a new and larger field as Sir It. Peel\r\n    did, to whose history yours has many points of likeness. You say\r\n    truly that Oxford has failed to enlarge itself to the progress of\r\n    the country. I hope this will make you enlarge yourself to the\r\n    facts of our age and state—and I believe it will. Only, as I said\r\n    some months ago, I am anxious about you, lest you should entangle\r\n    yourself with extremes. This crisis is for you politically what a\r\n    certain date was for me religiously.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone replied:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, July 21._—I thank you very much for your kind letter,\r\n    and I should have been very glad if it had contained all that it\r\n    merely alludes to. From Oxford and her children I am overwhelmed\r\n    with kindness. My feelings towards her are those of sorrow,\r\n    leavened perhaps with pride. But I am for the moment a stunned\r\n    man; the more so because without a moment of repose I had to\r\n    plunge into the whirlpools of South Lancashire, and swim there for\r\n    my life, which as you will see, has been given me.\r\n\r\n    I do not think I can admit the justice of the caution against\r\n    extremes. The greatest or second greatest of what people call my\r\n    extremes, is one which I believe you approve. I profess myself a\r\n    disciple of Butler: the greatest of all enemies to extremes. This\r\n    indeed speaks for my intention only. But in a cold or lukewarm\r\n    period, and such is this in public affairs, everything which moves\r\n    and lives is called extreme, and that by the very people (I do not\r\n    mean or think that you are one of them) who in a period of\r\n    excitement would far outstrip, under pressure, those whom they now\r\n    rebuke. Your caution about self-control, however, I do accept—it\r\n    is very valuable—I am sadly lacking in that great quality.\r\n\r\n    At both Liverpool and Manchester, he writes to Dr. Jacobson, I had\r\n    to speak of Oxford, and I have endeavoured to make it\r\n    unequivocally clear that I am here as the same man, and not\r\n    another, and that throwing off the academic cap and gown makes no\r\n    difference in the figure.\r\n\r\n    “Vixi, et quem dederat cursum fortuna peregi.”(101)\r\n\r\n    And when I think of dear old Oxford, whose services to me I can\r\n    never repay, there comes back to me that line of Wordsworth in his\r\n    incomparable Ode, and I fervently address her with it—\r\n\r\n    “Forbode not any severing of our loves.”\r\n\r\n    _To Sir Stafford Northcote, July 21._—I cannot withhold myself\r\n    from writing a line to assure you it is not my fault, but my\r\n    misfortune, that you are not my successor at Oxford. My desire or\r\n    impulse has for a good while, not unnaturally, been to escape from\r\n    the Oxford seat; not because I grudged the anxieties of it, but\r\n    because I found the load, added to other loads, too great. Could I\r\n    have seen my way to this proceeding, had the advice or had the\r\n    conduct of my friends warranted it, you would have had such notice\r\n    of it, as effectually to preclude your being anticipated. I mean\r\n    no disrespect to Mr. Hardy; but it has been a great pain to me to\r\n    see in all the circulars a name different from the name that\r\n    should have stood there, and that would have stood there, but for\r\n    your personal feelings.\r\n\r\n    _Ibid. July 22._—The separation from friends in politics is indeed\r\n    very painful.... I have been instructed, perhaps been hardened, by\r\n    a very wide experience in separation.—No man has been blessed more\r\n    out of proportion to his deserts than I have in friends: in\r\n    πολυφιλία, in χρηστοφιλία;(102) but when with regard to those of\r\n    old standing who were nearest to me, I ask where are they, I seem\r\n    to see around me a little waste, that has been made by politics,\r\n    by religion, and by death. All these modes of severance are sharp.\r\n    But the first of them is the least so, when the happy conviction\r\n    remains that the fulfilment of duty, such as conscience points to\r\n    it, is the object on both sides. And I have suffered so sorely by\r\n    the far sharper partings in death, and in religion after a fashion\r\n    which practically almost comes to death, that there is something\r\n    of relief in turning to the lighter visitation. It is, however, a\r\n    visitation still.\r\n\r\n    _To the Bishop of Oxford, July 21._—... Do not join with others in\r\n    praising me, because I am not angry, only sorry, and that deeply.\r\n    For my revenge—which I do not desire, but would battle if I\r\n    could—all lies in that little word “future” in my address, which I\r\n    wrote with a consciousness that it is deeply charged with meaning,\r\n    and that that which shall come will come. There have been two\r\n    great deaths or transmigrations of spirit in my political\r\n    existence. One, very slow, the breaking of ties with my original\r\n    party. The other, very short and sharp, the breaking of the tie\r\n    with Oxford. There will probably be a third, and no more....\r\n    Again, my dear Bishop, I thank you for bearing with my\r\n    waywardness, and manifesting, in the day of need, your confidence\r\n    and attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bishop naturally hinted some curiosity as to the third transmigration.\r\n“The oracular sentence,” Mr. Gladstone replied, “has little bearing on\r\npresent affairs or prospects, and may stand in its proper darkness.” In\r\nthe same letter the bishop urged Mr. Gladstone to imitate Canning when he\r\nclaimed the post of prime minister. “I think,” was the reply (July 25)\r\n“that if you had the same means of estimating my position, jointly with my\r\nfaculties, as I have, you would be of a different opinion. It is my fixed\r\ndetermination never to take any step whatever to raise myself to a higher\r\nlevel in official life, and this not on grounds of Christian self-denial\r\nwhich would hardly apply, but on the double ground, first, of my total\r\nignorance of my capacity, bodily or mental, to hold such a higher level,\r\nand, secondly—perhaps I might say especially—because I am certain that the\r\nfact of my seeking it would seal my doom in taking it.”(103)\r\n\r\nTruly was it said of Mr. Gladstone that his rejection at Oxford, and his\r\nelection in Lancashire, were regarded as matters of national importance,\r\nbecause he was felt to have the promise of the future in him, to have a\r\nliving fire in him, a capacity for action, and a belief that moving on was\r\na national necessity; because he was bold, earnest, impulsive; because he\r\ncould sympathise with men of all classes, occupations, interests,\r\nopinions; because he thought nothing done so long as much remained for him\r\nto do. While liberals thus venerated him as if he had been a Moses\r\nbeckoning from Sinai towards the promised land, tories were described as\r\ndreading him, ever since his suffrage speech, as continental monarchs\r\ndreaded Mazzini—“a man whose name is at once an alarm, a menace, and a\r\nprediction.” They hated him partly as a deserter, partly as a disciple of\r\nManchester. Throughout the struggle, the phrase “I believe in Mr.\r\nGladstone” served as the liberal _credo_, and “I distrust Mr. Gladstone”\r\nas the condensed commination service of the tories upon all manner of\r\nchange.(104)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M43) On October 18, the prime minister died at Brocket. The news found\r\nMr. Gladstone at Clumber, in performance of his duties as Newcastle\r\ntrustee. For him the event opened many possibilities, and his action upon\r\nit is set out in two or three extracts from his letters:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Russell. Clumber, Oct. 18, 1865._—I have received tonight\r\n    by telegraph the appalling news of Lord Palmerston’s decease. None\r\n    of us, I suppose, were prepared for this event, in the sense of\r\n    having communicated as to what should follow. The Queen must take\r\n    the first step, but I cannot feel uncertain what it will be. Your\r\n    former place as her minister, your powers, experience, services,\r\n    and renown, do not leave reason for doubt that you will be sent\r\n    for. Your hands will be entirely free—you are pledged probably to\r\n    no one, certainly not to me. But any government now to be formed\r\n    cannot be wholly a continuation, it must be in some degree a new\r\n    commencement.\r\n\r\n    I am sore with conflicts about the public expenditure, which I\r\n    feel that other men would have either escaped, or have conducted\r\n    more gently and less fretfully. I am most willing to retire. On\r\n    the other hand, I am bound by conviction even more than by credit\r\n    to the principle of progressive reduction in our military and\r\n    naval establishments and in the charges for them, under the\r\n    favourable circumstances which we appear to enjoy. This I think is\r\n    the moment to say thus much in subject matter which greatly\r\n    appertains to my department. On the general field of politics,\r\n    after having known your course in cabinet for eight and a half\r\n    years, I am quite willing to take my chance under your banner, in\r\n    the exact capacity I now fill, and I adopt the step, perhaps a\r\n    little unusual, of saying so, because it may be convenient to you\r\n    at a juncture when time is precious, while it can, I trust, after\r\n    what I have said above, hardly be hurtful.\r\n\r\n    _To Mr. Panizzi, Oct. 18._—_Ei fu!_(105) Death has indeed laid low\r\n    the most towering antlers in all the forest. No man in England\r\n    will more sincerely mourn Lord Palmerston than you. Your warm\r\n    heart, your long and close friendship with him, and your sense of\r\n    all he had said and done for Italy, all so bound you to him that\r\n    you will deeply feel this loss; as for myself I am stunned. It was\r\n    plain that this would come; but sufficient unto the day is the\r\n    burden thereof, and there is no surplus stock of energy in the\r\n    mind to face, far less to anticipate, fresh contingencies. But I\r\n    need not speak of this great event—to-morrow all England will be\r\n    ringing of it, and the world will echo England. I cannot forecast\r\n    the changes which will follow; but it is easy to see what the\r\n    first step should be.\r\n\r\n    _To Mrs. Gladstone, Oct. 20._—I received two letters from you\r\n    today together. The first, very naturally full of plans, the\r\n    second written when those plans had been blown into the air by the\r\n    anticipation (even) of Lord Palmerston’s death. This great event\r\n    shakes me down to the foundation, by the reason of coming trouble.\r\n    I think two things are clear. 1. The Queen should have come to\r\n    London. 2. She should have sent for Lord Russell. I fear she has\r\n    done neither. Willy telegraphs to me that a letter from Lord\r\n    Russell had come to Downing Street. Now had he heard from the\r\n    Queen, he would (so I reason) either have telegraphed to me to go\r\n    up, or sent a letter hither by a messenger instead of leaving it\r\n    to kick its heels in Downing Street for a day. And we hear nothing\r\n    of the Queen’s moving; she is getting into a groove, out of which\r\n    some one ought to draw her.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 21._—As far as political matters are concerned, I am happier\r\n    this morning. Lord Russell, pleased with my letter, writes to say\r\n    he has been commissioned to carry on the present government as\r\n    first lord, wishes me to co-operate “in the capacity I now fill as\r\n    a principal member of the administration.” I think that I have\r\n    struck a stroke for economy which will diminish difficulty when we\r\n    come to estimates for the year. I _hope_ from his letter that he\r\n    means to ask George Grey to lead, which would be very acceptable\r\n    to me. Though he does not summon me to London, I think I ought to\r\n    go, and shall do so accordingly to-day. I am sorry that this is\r\n    again more vexation and uncertainty for you.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 22._—I came up last night and very glad I am of it. I found\r\n    that Lord Palmerston’s funeral was almost to be private, not\r\n    because the family wished it, but because nothing had been\r\n    proposed to them. I at once sent—down to Richmond and Pembroke\r\n    Lodge with a letter, and the result is that Evelyn Ashley has been\r\n    written to by Lord Russell and authorised to telegraph to Balmoral\r\n    to propose a funeral in Westminster Abbey. It is now very late,\r\n    and all the preparations must have been made at Romsey. But in\r\n    such a matter especially, better late than never.\r\n\r\n    You will have been amused to see that on Friday the _Times_\r\n    actually put me up for prime minister, and yesterday knocked me\r\n    down again! There is a rumour that it was the old story, Delane\r\n    out of town. I was surprised at the first article, not at the\r\n    second. All, I am sorry to say, seem to take for granted that I am\r\n    to lead the House of Commons. But this is not so simple a matter.\r\n    First, it must be offered to Sir George Grey. If he refuses, then\r\n    secondly, I do not think I can get on without a different\r\n    arrangement of treasury and chancellor of exchequer business,\r\n    which will not be easy. But the worst of all is the distribution\r\n    of offices as between the two Houses. It has long been felt that\r\n    the House of Commons was too weak and the House of Lords too\r\n    strong, in the share of the important offices, and now the\r\n    premiership is to be carried over, unavoidably. No such thing has\r\n    ever been known as an administration with the first lord, foreign\r\n    secretary, secretary for war, and the first lord of the admiralty,\r\n    in the House of Lords.(106) _This_ is really a stiff business.\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Russell. Carlton House Terrace, Oct. 23._—You having\r\n    thought fit to propose that I should lead the House of Commons, I\r\n    felt it necessary first to be assured that Sir George Grey, who\r\n    was in constructive possession of that office, and under whom I\r\n    should have served with perfect satisfaction, could not be induced\r\n    to accept the duty. Of this your letter seemed to contain\r\n    sufficient proof. Next, I felt it to be necessary that some\r\n    arrangement should be made for relieving me of a considerable and\r\n    singularly disabling class of business, consisting of the cases of\r\n    real or supposed grievance, at all times arising in connection\r\n    with the collection of the public revenue under its several\r\n    heads.... The third difficulty which I named to you in the way of\r\n    my accepting your proposal, is what I venture to call the\r\n    lop-sided condition of the government, with the strain and stress\r\n    of administration in the House of Commons, and nearly all the\r\n    offices about which the House of Commons cares, represented by\r\n    heads in the House of Lords. It weighs very seriously on my mind,\r\n    and I beg you to _consider_ it.... I have rather particular\r\n    engagements of a public nature next week; at Edinburgh on the 2nd\r\n    and 3rd in connection with the university business, and at Glasgow\r\n    on the 1st, to receive the freedom. I am anxious to know whether I\r\n    may now finally confirm these engagements?\r\n\r\n    _To Mrs. Gladstone, Oct. 23._—I think I see my way a little now.\r\n    Lord Russell agrees that cabinets should be postponed after\r\n    Saturday, for a good fortnight. I can therefore keep my\r\n    engagements in Scotland, and write to-day to say so.\r\n\r\n    Lord Palmerston is to be buried in the Abbey on Friday; the family\r\n    are pleased. I saw W. Cowper as well as Evelyn Ashley to-day. They\r\n    give a good account of Lady Palmerston.... Lord Russell offers me\r\n    the lead—I must probably settle it to-morrow. His physical\r\n    strength is low, but I suppose in the Lords he may get on. The\r\n    greatest difficulty is having almost all the important offices in\r\n    the Lords.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 24._—Lord Russell now proposes to adjourn the cabinets till\r\n    Nov.14th, but I must be here for the Lord Mayor’s dinner on the\r\n    9th. You will therefore see my programme as it now stands. I send\r\n    you a batch of eight letters, which please keep carefully to\r\n    yourself, and return in their bundle forthwith. There are divers\r\n    proposals on foot, but I think little will be finally settled\r\n    before Friday. Sir R. Peel will probably have a peerage offered\r\n    him. I have not yet accepted the lead formally, but I suppose it\r\n    must come to that. The main question is whether anything, and\r\n    what, can be done to improve the structure of the government as\r\n    between the two Houses.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 25._—Nothing more has yet been done. I consider my position\r\n    virtually fixed. I am afraid of Lord Russell’s rapidity, but we\r\n    shall try to rein it in, There seems to be very little venom in\r\n    the atmosphere. I wish Sir G. Grey were here. The Queen’s keeping\r\n    so long at Balmoral is a sad mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M44) He received, as was inevitable, plenty of letters from admirers\r\nregretting that he had not gone up higher. His answer was, of course,\r\nuniform. “It was,” he told them, “my own impartial and firm opinion that\r\nLord Russell was the proper person to succeed Lord Palmerston. However\r\nflattered I may be, therefore, to hear of an opinion such as you report\r\nand express, I have felt it my duty to co-operate to the best of my power\r\nin such arrangements as might enable the government to be carried on by\r\nthe present ministers, with Lord Russell at their head.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, doubts were abundant. To Sir George Grey, one important\r\nfriend wrote (Oct. 30): “I think you are right on the score of health, to\r\ngive him [Gladstone] the lead of the House; but you will see, with all his\r\ntalents, he will not perceive the difference between leading and driving.”\r\nAnother correspondent, of special experience, confessed to “great\r\nmisgivings as to Gladstone’s tact and judgment.” “The heart of all Israel\r\nis towards him,” wrote his good friend Dean Church; “he is very great and\r\nvery noble. But he is hated as much as, or more than, he is loved. He is\r\nfierce sometimes and wrathful and easily irritated; he wants knowledge of\r\nmen and speaks rashly. And I look on with some trembling to see what will\r\ncome of this his first attempt to lead the Commons and prove himself fit\r\nto lead England.”(107) It was pointed out that Roundell Palmer was the\r\nonly powerful auxiliary on whom he could rely in debate, and should the\r\nleader himself offend the House by an indiscretion, no colleague was\r\ncompetent to cover his retreat or baffle the triumph of the enemy. His\r\nfirst public appearance as leader of the House of Commons and associate\r\npremier was made at Glasgow, and his friends were relieved and exultant.\r\nThe point on which they trembled was caution, and at Glasgow he was\r\ncaution personified.\r\n\r\nThe changes in administration were not very difficult. Lowe’s admission to\r\nthe cabinet was made impossible by his declaration against any lowering of\r\nthe borough franchise. The inclusion of Mr. Goschen, who had only been in\r\nparliament three years, was the subject of remark. People who asked what\r\nhe had done to merit promotion so striking, did not know his book on\r\nforeign exchanges, and were perhaps in no case competent to judge it.(108)\r\nSomething seems to have been said about Mr. Bright, for in a note to Lord\r\nRussell (Dec. 11) Mr. Gladstone writes: “With reference to your remark\r\nabout Bright, he has for many years held language of a studious moderation\r\nabout reform. And there is something odious in fighting shy of a man, so\r\npowerful in talent, of such undoubted integrity. Without feeling, however,\r\nthat he is permanently proscribed, I am under the impression that in the\r\npresent critical state of feeling on your own side with respect to the\r\nfranchise, his name would sink the government and the bill together.” When\r\nPalmerston invited Cobden to join his cabinet in 1859, Cobden spoke of\r\nBright, how he had avoided personalities in his recent speeches. “It is\r\nnot personalities that we complained of,” Palmerston replied; “a public\r\nman is right in attacking persons. But it is his attacks on _classes_ that\r\nhave given offence to powerful bodies, who can make their resentment\r\nfelt.”(109)\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone’s first few weeks as leader of the House were almost a\r\nsurprise. “At two,” he says (Feb. 1, 1867), “we went down to choose the\r\nSpeaker, and I had to throw off in my new capacity. If mistrust of self be\r\na qualification, God knows I have it.” All opened excellently. Not only\r\nwas he mild and conciliatory, they found him even tiresome in his\r\ndeference. Some onlookers still doubted. Everybody, they said, admired and\r\nrespected him, some loved him, but there were few who understood him. “So\r\nfar,” said a conservative observer, “Gladstone has led the House with\r\ngreat good temper, prosperity, and success, but his rank and file and some\r\nof his colleagues, seem to like him none the better on that account.”(110)\r\nMeanwhile, words of friendly encouragement came from Windsor. On Feb. 19:\r\n“The Queen cannot conclude without expressing to Mr. Gladstone her\r\ngratification at the accounts she hears from all sides of the admirable\r\nmanner in which he has commenced his leadership in the House of Commons.”\r\n\r\nHe found the speech for a monument to Lord Palmerston in the Abbey “a\r\ndelicate and difficult duty” (Feb. 22). “It would have worn me down\r\nbeforehand had I not been able to exclude it from my thoughts till the\r\nlast, and then I could only feel my impotence.” Yet he performed the duty\r\nwith grace and truth. He commemorated Palmerston’s share in the extension\r\nof freedom in Europe, and especially in Italy, where, he said,\r\nPalmerston’s name might claim a place on a level with her most\r\ndistinguished patriots. Nor had his interest ever failed in the rescue of\r\nthe “unhappy African race, whose history is for the most part written only\r\nin blood and tears.” He applauded his genial temper, his incomparable tact\r\nand ingenuity, his pluck in debate, his delight in a fair stand-up fight,\r\nhis inclination to avoid whatever tended to exasperate, his incapacity of\r\nsustained anger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X. Matters Ecclesiastical. (1864-1868)\r\n\r\n\r\n    ὦ γῆς ὄχημα κὰπὶ γῆς ἔχων ἕδραν,\r\n    ὅστις ποτ᾽ εἶ σύ, δυστόπαστος εἰδέναι,\r\n    Ζεὺς, εἴτ᾽ ἀνάγκη φύσεος εἴτε νοῦς βροτῶν,\r\n    προσηυξάμην σε; πάντα γὰρ δι᾽ ἀψόφου\r\n    βαίνων κελεύθου κατὰ δίκην τὰ θνήτ᾽ ἄγεις.\r\n\r\n    —EUR., _Troades_, 884.\r\n\r\n    O thou, upholder of the earth, who upon earth hast an abiding\r\n    place, whosoever thou art, inscrutable, thou Zeus, whether thou be\r\n    necessity of nature, or intelligence of mortal men, on thee I\r\n    call; for, treading a noiseless path, in righteousness dost thou\r\n    direct all human things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader will have surmised that amidst all the press and strain in\r\naffairs of state, Mr. Gladstone’s intensity of interest in affairs of the\r\nchurch never for an instant slackened. Wide as the two spheres stood\r\napart, his temper in respect of them was much the same. In church and\r\nstate alike he prized institutions and the great organs of corporate life;\r\nbut what he thought of most and cared for and sought after most, was not\r\ntheir mechanism, though on that too he set its value, but the living\r\nspirit within the institution. In church and state alike he moved\r\ncautiously and tentatively. In both alike he strove to unite order,\r\nwhether temporal order in the state or spiritual order in the church, with\r\nhis sovereign principle of freedom. Many are the difficulties in the way\r\nof applying Cavour’s formula of a free church in a free state, as most\r\ncountries and their governors have by now found out. Yet to have a vivid\r\nsense of the supreme importance of the line between temporal power and\r\nspiritual is the note of a statesman fit for modern times. “The whole of\r\nmy public life,” he wrote to the Bishop of Oxford in 1863, “with respect\r\nto matters ecclesiastical, for the last twenty years and more, has been a\r\ncontinuing effort, though a very weak one, to extricate her in some degree\r\nfrom entangled relations without shock or violence.”\r\n\r\n(M45) The general temper of his churchmanship on its political side during\r\nthese years is admirably described in a letter to his eldest son, and some\r\nextracts from it furnish a key to his most characteristic frame of mind in\r\nattempting to guide the movements of his time:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To W. H. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    _April 16, 1865._—You appeared to speak with the supposition, a\r\n    very natural one, that it was matter of duty to defend all the\r\n    privileges and possessions of the church; that concession would\r\n    lead to concession; and that the end of the series would be its\r\n    destruction.... Now, in the first place, it is sometimes necessary\r\n    in politics to make surrenders of what, if not surrendered, will\r\n    be wrested from us. And it is very wise, when a necessity of this\r\n    kind is approaching, to anticipate it while it is yet a good way\r\n    off; for then concession begets gratitude, and often brings a\r\n    return. The _kind_ of concession which is really mischievous is\r\n    just that which is made under terror and extreme pressure; and\r\n    unhappily this has been the kind of concession which for more than\r\n    two hundred years, it has been the fashion of men who call (and\r\n    who really think) themselves “friends of the church” to make.... I\r\n    believe it would be a wise concession, upon grounds merely\r\n    political, for the church of England to have the law of church\r\n    rate abolished in all cases where it places her in fretting\r\n    conflict with the dissenting bodies.... I say all this, however,\r\n    not to form the groundwork of a conclusion, but only in\r\n    illustration of a general maxim which is applicable to political\r\n    questions.\r\n\r\n    But next, this surely is a political question. Were we asked to\r\n    surrender an article of the creed in order to save the rest, or to\r\n    consent to the abolition of the episcopal order, these things\r\n    touch the faith of Christians and the life of the church, and\r\n    cannot in any measure become the subject of compromise. But the\r\n    external possessions of the church were given it for the more\r\n    effectual promotion of its work, and may be lessened or abandoned\r\n    with a view to the same end.... Now we have lived into a time when\r\n    the great danger of the church is the sale of her faith for\r\n    gold.... In demanding the money of dissenters for the worship of\r\n    the church, we practically invest them with a title to demand that\r\n    she should be adapted to their use in return, and we stimulate\r\n    every kind of interference with her belief and discipline to that\r\n    end. By judiciously waiving an undoubted legal claim, we not only\r\n    do an act which the understood principles of modern liberty tend\r\n    to favour and almost require, but we soothe ruffled minds and\r\n    tempers, and what is more, we strengthen the case and claim of the\r\n    church to be respected as a religious body.... I am convinced that\r\n    the only hope of making it possible for her to discharge her high\r\n    office as stewardess of divine truth, is to deal tenderly and\r\n    gently with all the points at which her external privileges\r\n    _grate_ upon the feelings and interests of that unhappily large\r\n    portion of the community who have almost ceased in any sense to\r\n    care for her. This is a principle of broad application, broader\r\n    far than the mere question of church rates. It is one not\r\n    requiring precipitate or violent action, or the disturbance\r\n    prematurely of anything established; but it supplies a rule of the\r\n    first importance for dealing with the mixed questions of temporal\r\n    and religious interest when they arise. I am very anxious to see\r\n    it quietly but firmly rooted in your mind. It is connected with\r\n    the dearest interests not only of my public life, but as I believe\r\n    of our religion.... I am in no way anxious that you should take my\r\n    opinions in politics as a model for your own. Your free\r\n    concurrence will be a lively pleasure to me. But above all I wish\r\n    you to be free. What I have now been dwelling upon is a matter\r\n    higher and deeper than the region of mere opinion. It has fallen\r\n    to my lot to take a share larger than that of many around me,\r\n    though in itself slight, in bringing the principle I have\r\n    described into use as a ground of action. I am convinced that if I\r\n    have laboured to any purpose at all it has been in great part for\r\n    this. It is part of that business of reconciling the past with the\r\n    new time and order, which seems to belong particularly to our\r\n    country and its rulers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to cite as cases where something had been done towards\r\nsecuring the action of the church as a religious body, Canada, where\r\nclergy and people now appointed their own bishop; a recent judgment of the\r\nprivy council leading to widespread emancipation of the colonial church;\r\nthe revival of convocation; the licence to convocation to alter the\r\nthirty-sixth canon; the bestowal of self-government on Oxford. “In these\r\nmeasures,” he says, “I have been permitted to take my part; but had I\r\nadopted the rigid rule of others in regard to the temporal prerogatives,\r\nreal or supposed, of the church, I should at once have lost all power to\r\npromote them.”\r\n\r\n“As to disruption,” he wrote in these days, “that is the old cry by means\r\nof which in all times the temporal interests of the English church have\r\nbeen upheld in preference to the spiritual. The church of England is much\r\nmore likely of the two, to part with her faith than with her funds. It is\r\nthe old question, which is the greater, the _gold_ or the altar that\r\nsanctifies the gold. Had this question been more boldly asked and more\r\ntruly answered in other times, we should not have been where we now are.\r\nAnd by continually looking to the gold and not the altar, the dangers of\r\nthe future will be not diminished but increased.”(111)\r\n\r\n(M46) In 1866 Mr. Gladstone for the first time voted for the abolition of\r\nchurch rates. Later in the session he introduced his own plan, not in his\r\ncapacity as minister, but with the approval of the Russell cabinet. After\r\nthis cabinet had gone out, Mr. Gladstone in 1868 introduced a bill,\r\nabolishing all legal proceedings for the recovery of church rates, except\r\nin cases of rates already made, or where money had been borrowed on the\r\nsecurity of the rates. But it permitted voluntary assessments to be made,\r\nand all agreements to make such payments on the faith of which any expense\r\nwas incurred, remained enforcible in the same manner as contracts of a\r\nlike character. Mr. Gladstone’s bill became law in the course of the\r\nsummer, and a struggle that had been long and bitter ended.\r\n\r\nIn another movement in the region of ecclesiastical machinery, from which\r\nmuch was hoped, though little is believed to have come, Mr. Gladstone was\r\nconcerned, though I do not gather from the papers that he watched it with\r\nthe zealous interest of some of his friends. Convocation, the ancient\r\nassembly or parliament of the clergy of the church of England, was\r\npermitted in 1852 to resume the active functions that had been suspended\r\nsince 1717. To Mr. Gladstone some revival or institution of the corporate\r\norganisation of the church, especially after the Gorham judgment, was ever\r\na cherished object. Bishop Wilberforce, long one of the most intimate of\r\nhis friends, was chief mover in proceedings that, as was hoped, were to\r\nrescue the church from the anarchy in which one branch of her sons\r\nregarded her as plunged. Some of Mr. Gladstone’s correspondence on the\r\nquestion of convocation has already been made public.(112) Here it is\r\nenough to print a passage or two from a letter addressed by him to the\r\nbishop (Jan. 1, 1854) setting out his view of the real need of the time.\r\nAfter a generous exaltation of the zeal and devotion of the clergy, he\r\ngoes on to the gains that might be expected from their effective\r\norganisation:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    First as to her pastoral work, her warfare against sin, she would\r\n    put forth a strength, not indeed equal to it, but at least so much\r\n    less unequal than it now is, that the good fight would everywhere\r\n    be maintained, and she would not be as she now is, either hated or\r\n    unknown among the myriads who form the right arm of England’s\r\n    industry and skill. As to her doctrine and all that hangs upon it,\r\n    such questions as might arise would be determined by the\r\n    deliberate and permanent sense of the body. Some unity in belief\r\n    is necessary to justify association in a Christian communion. Will\r\n    that unity in belief be promoted or impaired by the free action of\r\n    mind within her, subjected to order? If her case really were so\r\n    desperate that her children had no common faith, then the sooner\r\n    that imposture were detected the better; but if she has, then her\r\n    being provided with legitimate, orderly, and authentic channels,\r\n    for expressing and bringing to a head, as need arises, the\r\n    sentiments of her people, will far more clearly manifest, and\r\n    while manifesting will extend, deepen, and consolidate, that\r\n    unity. It is all very well to sneer at councils: but who among us\r\n    will deny that the councils which we acknowledge as lawful\r\n    representatives of the universal church, were great and to all\r\n    appearance necessary providential instruments in the establishment\r\n    of the Christian faith?\r\n\r\n    But, say some, we cannot admit the laity into convocation, as it\r\n    would be in derogation of the rights of the clergy; or as others\r\n    say, it would separate the church from the state. And others, more\r\n    numerous and stronger, in their fear of the exclusive constitution\r\n    of the convocation, resist every attempt at organising the church,\r\n    and suffer, and even by suffering promote, the growth of all our\r\n    evils. I will not touch the question of convocation except by\r\n    saying that, in which I think you concur, that while the present\r\n    use is unsatisfactory and even scandalous, no form of church\r\n    government that does not distinctly and fully provide for the\r\n    expression of the voice of the laity either can be had, or if it\r\n    could would satisfy the needs of the church of England. But in my\r\n    own mind as well as in this letter, I am utterly against all\r\n    premature, all rapid conclusions.... It will be much in our day\r\n    if, towards the cure of such evils, when we die we can leave to\r\n    our children the precious knowledge that a beginning has been\r\n    made—a beginning not only towards enabling the bishops and clergy\r\n    to discharge their full duty, but also, and yet more, towards\r\n    raising the real character of membership in those millions upon\r\n    millions, the whole bulk of our community, who now have its name\r\n    and its name alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1860 a volume appeared containing seven “essays and reviews” by seven\r\ndifferent writers, six of them clergymen of the church of England. The\r\ntopics were miscellaneous, the treatment of them, with one exception,(113)\r\nwas neither learned nor weighty, the tone was not absolutely uniform, but\r\nit was as a whole mildly rationalistic, and the negations, such as they\r\nwere, exhibited none of the fierceness or aggression that had marked the\r\nold controversies about Hampden, or Tract Ninety, or Ward’s _Ideal_. A\r\nstorm broke upon the seven writers, that they little intended to provoke.\r\nTo the apparent partnership among them was severely imputed a sinister\r\ndesign. They were styled “the Septem contra Christum”—six ministers of\r\nreligion combining to assail the faith they outwardly professed—seven\r\nauthors of an immoral rationalistic conspiracy. Two of them were haled\r\ninto the courts, one for casting doubt upon the inspiration of the Bible,\r\nthe other for impugning the eternity of the future punishment of the\r\nwicked. The Queen in council upon appeal was advised to reverse a hostile\r\njudgment in the court below (1864), and Lord Chancellor Westbury delivered\r\nthe decision in a tone described in the irreverent epigram of the day as\r\n“dismissing eternal punishment with costs.” This carried further, or\r\ncompleted, the principle of the Gorham judgment fourteen years before, and\r\njust as that memorable case determined that neither the evangelical nor\r\nthe high anglican school should drive out the other, so the judgment in\r\nthe case of _Essays and Reviews_ determined that neither should those two\r\npowerful sections drive out the new critical, rationalistic, liberal, or\r\nlatitudinarian school. “It appears to me,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to the\r\nBishop of London (April 26, 1864), “that the spirit of this judgment has\r\nbut to be consistently and cautiously followed up, in order to establish,\r\nas far as the court can establish it, a complete indifference between the\r\nChristian faith and the denial of it. I do not believe it is in the power\r\nof human language to bind the understanding and conscience of man with any\r\ntheological obligations, which the mode of argument used and the\r\nprinciples assumed [in the judgment] would not effectually unloose.” To\r\nBishop Hamilton of Salisbury, who had taken part in one of the two cases,\r\nhe wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 8, 1864._—This new and grave occurrence appertains to a\r\n    transition state through which the Christian faith is passing. The\r\n    ship is at sea far from the shore she left, far from the shore she\r\n    is making for. This or that deflection from her course, from this\r\n    or that wind of heaven, we cannot tell what it is, or whether\r\n    favourable or adverse to her true work and destination, unless we\r\n    know all the stages of the experience through which she has yet to\r\n    pass. It seems to me that these judgments are most important in\r\n    their character as illustrations of a system, or I should rather\r\n    say, of the failure of a system, parts of a vast scheme of forces\r\n    and events in the midst of which we stand, which seem to govern\r\n    us, but which are in reality governed by a hand above. It may be\r\n    that this rude shock to the mere scripturism which has too much\r\n    prevailed, is intended to be the instrument of restoring a greater\r\n    harmony of belief, and of the agencies for maintaining belief. But\r\n    be that as it may, the valiant soldier who has fought manfully\r\n    should be, and I hope will be, of good cheer.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same connection he wrote to Sir W. Farquhar, a friend from earliest\r\ndays:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 31, 1865._—I have never been much disposed to a great\r\n    exaltation of clerical power, and I agree in the necessity of\r\n    taking precautions against the establishment, especially of an\r\n    insular and local though in its sphere legitimate authority, of\r\n    new doctrines for that Christian faith which is not for England or\r\n    France but for the world; further, I believe it has been a mistake\r\n    in various instances to institute the coercive proceedings which\r\n    have led to the present state of things. I remember telling the\r\n    Archbishop of York at Penmaenmawr, when he was Bishop of\r\n    Gloucester, that it seemed to me we had lived into a time when,\r\n    speaking generally, penal proceedings for the maintenance of\r\n    divine truth among the clergy would have to be abandoned, and\r\n    moral means alone depended on. But, on the other hand, I feel that\r\n    the most vital lay interests are at stake in the definite teaching\r\n    and profession of the Christian faith, and the general tendency\r\n    and effect of the judgments has been and is likely to be hostile\r\n    to that definite teaching, and unfavourable also to the moral tone\r\n    and truthfulness, of men who may naturally enough be tempted to\r\n    shelter themselves under judicial glosses in opposition to the\r\n    plain meaning of words. The judgments of the present tribunal\r\n    continued in a series would, I fear, result in the final triumph\r\n    (in a sense he did not desire) of Mr. Ward’s non-natural sense;\r\n    and the real question is whether our objection to non-natural\r\n    senses is general, or is only felt when the sense favoured is the\r\n    one opposed to our own inclinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNo theological book, wrote Mr. Gladstone in 1866, that has appeared since\r\nthe _Vestiges of Creation_ twenty years before (1844), had attracted\r\nanything like the amount of notice bestowed upon “the remarkable volume\r\nentitled _Ecce Homo_,” published in 1865. It was an attempt, so Mr.\r\nGladstone described it, to bring home to the reader the impression that\r\nthere is something or other called the Gospel, “which whatever it may be,”\r\nas was said by an old pagan poet of the Deity,(114) has formidable claims\r\nnot merely on the intellectual condescension, but on the loyal allegiance\r\nand humble obedience of mankind. The book violently displeased both sides.\r\nIt used language that could not be consistently employed in treating of\r\nChristianity from the orthodox point of view. On the other hand, it\r\nconstituted “a grave offence in the eyes of those to whom the chequered\r\nbut yet imposing fabric of actual Christianity, still casting its majestic\r\nlight and shadow over the whole civilised world, is a rank eyesore and an\r\nintolerable offence.” Between these two sets of assailants Mr. Gladstone\r\ninterposed with a friendlier and more hopeful construction.(115) He told\r\nthose who despised the book as resting on no evidence of the foundations\r\non which it was built, and therefore as being shallow and uncritical, that\r\nwe have a right to weigh the nature of the message, apart from the\r\ncredentials of the messenger. Then he reassured the orthodox by the hope\r\nthat “the present tendency to treat the old belief of man with a\r\nprecipitate, shallow, and unexamining disparagement” is only a passing\r\ndistemper, and that to the process of its removal the author of the book\r\nwould have the consolation and the praise of having furnished an earnest,\r\npowerful, and original contribution.(116) Dean Milman told him that he had\r\nbrought to life again a book that after a sudden and brief yet brilliant\r\nexistence seemed to be falling swiftly into oblivion. The mask of the\r\nanonymous had much to do, he thought, with its popularity, as had happened\r\nto the _Vestiges of Creation_. Undoubtedly when the mask fell off,\r\ninterest dropped.\r\n\r\n(M47) Dr. Pusey found the book intensely painful. “I have seldom,” he told\r\nMr. Gladstone, “been able to read much at a time, but shut the book for\r\npain, as I used to do with Renan’s.” What revolted him was not the\r\nexhibition of the human nature of the central figure, but of a human\r\nnature apart from and inconsistent with its divinity; the writer’s\r\nadmiring or patronising tone was loathsome. “What you have yourself\r\nwritten,” Pusey said, “I like much. But its bearings on _Ecce Homo_ I can\r\nhardly divine, except by way of contrast.” Dr. Newman thought that here\r\nwas a case where _materiam superabat opus_, and that Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nobservations were more valuable for their own sake, than as a\r\nrecommendation or defence of the book:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 9, 1868._—I hope I have followed you correctly, says Newman:\r\n    your main proposition seems to be, that whereas both Jew and\r\n    Gentile had his own notion of an heroic humanity, and neither of\r\n    them a true notion, the one being political, the other even\r\n    immoral, the first step necessary for bringing in the idea of an\r\n    Emmanuel into the world, was to form the human mould into which it\r\n    ’might drop,’ and thus to supplant both the Judaic and the heathen\r\n    misconception by the exhibition of the true idea. Next, passing\r\n    from antecedent probabilities to history, the order of succession\r\n    of the synoptical and the fourth gospels does in fact fulfil this\r\n    reasonable anticipation. This seems to me a _very great_ view, and\r\n    I look forward eagerly to what you have still to say in\r\n    illustration of it. The only objection which I see can be made to\r\n    it is, that it is a clever controversial expedient after the event\r\n    for accounting for a startling fact. This is an objection not\r\n    peculiar to it, but to all explanations of the kind. Still, the\r\n    question remains—whether it is a fact that the sacred writers\r\n    recognise, however indirectly, the wise economy which you assert,\r\n    or whether it is only an hypothesis?\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the specific principles and particular opinions in Mr. Gladstone’s\r\ncriticism of what we now see to have been a not very effective or deeply\r\ninfluential book, we may think as we will. But the temper of his review,\r\nthe breadth of its outlook on Christian thought, tradition, and society,\r\nshow no mean elements in the composition of his greatness. So, too, does\r\nthe bare fact that under the pressure of office and all the cares of a\r\nparty leader in a crisis, his mind should have been free and disengaged\r\nenough to turn with large and eager interest to such themes as these. This\r\nwas indeed the freedom of judgment with which, in the most moving lines of\r\nthe poem that he loved above all others, Virgil bidding farewell to Dante\r\nmakes him crowned and mitred master of himself—_Perch’ io te sopra te\r\ncorono e mitrio._(117)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M48) Other strong gusts swept the high latitudes, when Dr. Colenso,\r\nBishop of Natal, published certain destructive criticisms upon the\r\ncanonical Scriptures. His metropolitan at Cape Town pronounced sentence of\r\ndeprivation; Colenso appealed to the Queen in council; and the Queen in\r\ncouncil was advised that the proceedings of the Bishop of Cape Town were\r\nnull and void, for in law there was no established church in the colony,\r\nnor any ecclesiastical court with lawful jurisdiction.(118) This triumph\r\nof heresy was a heavy blow. In 1866 Bishop Colenso brought an action\r\nagainst Mr. Gladstone and the other trustees of the colonial bishoprics\r\nfund, calling upon them to set aside a sum of ten thousand pounds for the\r\npurpose of securing the income of the Bishop of Natal, and to pay him his\r\nsalary, which they had withheld since his wrongful deprivation. “We,” said\r\nMr. Gladstone to Miss Burdett Coutts, “founding ourselves on the judgment,\r\nsay there is no see of Natal in the sense of the founders of the fund, and\r\ntherefore, of course, no bishop of such a see.” Romilly, master of the\r\nrolls, gave judgment in favour of Colenso. These perplexities did not\r\ndismay Mr. Gladstone. “Remembering what the churches in the colonies were\r\nsome forty years back, when I first began (from my father’s having a\r\nconnection with the West Indies), to feel an interest in them, I must own\r\nthat they present a cheering, a remarkable, indeed a wonderful spectacle.”\r\n“I quite feel with you,” he says to Miss Burdett Coutts, “a great\r\nuneasiness at what may follow from the exercise of judicial powers by\r\nsynods merely ecclesiastical, especially if small, remote, and unchecked\r\nby an active public opinion. But in the American episcopal church it has\r\nbeen found practicable in a great degree to obviate any dangers from such\r\na source.” Ten years after this, in one of the most remarkable articles he\r\never wrote, speaking of the protestant evangelical section of the\r\nadherents of the Christian system, he says that no portion of this entire\r\ngroup seems to be endowed with greater vigour than this in the United\r\nStates and the British colonies, which has grown up in new soil, “_and far\r\nfrom the possibly chilling shadow of national establishments of\r\nreligion_.”(119)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI. Popular Estimates. (1868)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Die Mitlebenden werden an vorzüglichen Menschen gar leicht irre;\r\n    das Besondere der Person stört sie, das laufende bewegliche Leben\r\n    verrückt ihre Standpunkte und hindert das Kennen und Anerkennen\r\n    eines solchen Mannes.—GOETHE.\r\n\r\n    The contemporaries of superior men easily go wrong about them.\r\n    Peculiarity discomposes them; the swift current of life disturbs\r\n    their points of view, and prevents them from understanding and\r\n    appreciating such men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must obviously be interesting, as we approach a signal crisis in his\r\nadvance, to know the kind of impression, right or wrong, made by a great\r\nman upon those who came nearest to him. Friends like Aberdeen and Graham\r\nhad many years earlier foreseen the high destinies of their colleague.\r\nAberdeen told Bishop Wilberforce in 1855 that Gladstone had some great\r\nqualifications but some serious defects. “The chief, that when he has\r\nconvinced himself, perhaps by abstract reasoning of some view, he thinks\r\nthat every one else ought at once to see it as he does, and can make no\r\nallowance for difference of opinion.”(120) About the same time Graham said\r\nof him that he was “in the highest sense of the word _Liberal_; of the\r\ngreatest power; very much the first man in the House of Commons; detested\r\nby the aristocracy for his succession duty, the most truly conservative\r\nmeasure passed in my recollection.... He must rise to the head in such a\r\ngovernment as ours, even in spite of all the hatred of him.” Three years\r\nlater Aberdeen still thought him too obstinate and, if such a thing be\r\npossible, too honest. He does not enough think of what other men think.\r\nDoes not enough look out of the window. “Whom will he lead?” asked the\r\nbishop.(121) “Oh! it is impossible to say! Time must show, and new\r\ncombinations.” By 1863 Cardwell confidently anticipated that Mr. Gladstone\r\nmust become prime minister, and Bishop Wilberforce finds all coming to the\r\nconclusion that he must be the next real chief.(122)\r\n\r\n(M49) On the other side Lord Shaftesbury, to whom things ecclesiastical\r\nwere as cardinal as they were to Mr. Gladstone, ruefully reflected in 1864\r\nthat people must make ready for great and irrevocable changes. Palmerston\r\nwas simply the peg driven through the island of Delos: unloose the peg,\r\nand all would soon be adrift. “His successor, Gladstone, will bring with\r\nhim the Manchester school for colleagues and supporters, a hot tractarian\r\nfor chancellor, and the Bishop of Oxford for ecclesiastical adviser. He\r\nwill succumb to every pressure, except the pressure of a constitutional\r\nand conservative policy.” “He is a dangerous man,” was one of Lord\r\nPalmerston’s latest utterances, “keep him in Oxford and he is partially\r\nmuzzled; but send him elsewhere and he will run wild.”(123) “The long and\r\nshort of our present position is,” said Shaftesbury, “that the time has\r\narrived (_novus sœclorum nascitur ordo_) for the triumph of the Manchester\r\nschool, of which Gladstone is the disciple and the organ. And for the\r\nnonce they have a great advantage; for, though the majority of the country\r\nis against them, the country has no leaders in or out of parliament;\r\nwhereas they are all well provided and are equally compact in purpose and\r\naction.”(124) Somewhat earlier cool observers “out of hearing of the\r\nmodulation of his voice or the torrent of his declamation” regarded him\r\n“in spite of his eloquence unsurpassed in our day, perhaps in our century,\r\nin spite of his abilities and experience, as one most dangerous to that\r\nside to which he belongs. Like the elephant given by some eastern prince\r\nto the man he intends to ruin, he is an inmate too costly for any party to\r\nafford to keep long.”(125)\r\n\r\n“One great weight that Gladstone has to carry in the political race,”\r\nwrote his friend Frederick Rogers (Dec. 13, 1868), “is a _character_ for\r\nwant of judgment, and every addition to that is an impediment.” And indeed\r\nit is true in politics that it often takes more time to get rid of a\r\nspurious character, than to acquire the real one. According to a letter\r\nfrom Lord Granville to Mr. Gladstone (Feb. 11, 1867):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lowe described as perfectly unjust and unfounded the criticisms\r\n    which had been made of your leadership. You had always been\r\n    courteous and conciliatory with the whole House and with\r\n    individual members, including himself. He had seen Palmerston do\r\n    and say more offensive things every week, than you have during the\r\n    whole session.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill people went on saying that he had yet to gain the same hold over his\r\nparty in parliament that he had over the party in the nation; he had\r\nstudied every branch of government except the House of Commons; he\r\nconfounded the functions of leader with those of dictator; he took counsel\r\nwith one or two individuals instead of conferring with the party; he\r\nproclaimed as edicts what he ought to have submitted as proposals; he\r\nlacked “the little civilities and hypocrisies” of political society. Such\r\nwas the common cant of the moment. He had at least one friend who dealt\r\nfaithfully with him:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _T. D. Acland to Mr. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 24, 1868._—Now I am going to take a great liberty with you.\r\n    I can hardly help myself. I have heard a lot of grumbling lately\r\n    about you, and have several times asked myself whether it would be\r\n    _tanti_ to tease you by repeating it. Well, what is pressed on me\r\n    is, that at the present time when every one is full of anxiety as\r\n    to the future, and when your warmest supporters are longing for\r\n    cohesion, there is an impression that you are absorbed in\r\n    questions about Homer and Greek words, about _Ecce Homo_, that you\r\n    are not reading the newspapers, or feeling the pulse of followers.\r\n    One man personally complained that when you sought his opinion,\r\n    you spent the whole interview in impressing your own view on him,\r\n    and hardly heard anything he might have to say. It is with a\r\n    painful feeling and (were it not for your generous and truly\r\n    modest nature it would be) with some anxiety as to how you would\r\n    take it that I consented to be the funnel of all this grumbling.\r\n    As far as I can make out, the feeling resolves itself into two\r\n    main points: 1. Whatever your own tastes may be for literature,\r\n    and however strengthening and refreshing to your own mind and\r\n    heart it may be to dig into the old springs, still the people\r\n    don’t understand it; they consider you their own, as a husband\r\n    claims a wife’s devotion; and it gives a bad impression if you are\r\n    supposed to be interested, except for an occasional slight\r\n    recreation, about aught but the nation’s welfare at this critical\r\n    time, and that it riles them to see the walls placarded with your\r\n    name and _Ecce Homo_.... 2. (_a_) The other point is (pray forgive\r\n    me if I go too far, I am simply a funnel) a feeling that your\r\n    entourage is too confined, and too much of second-rate men; that\r\n    the strong men and the _rising_ men are not gathered round you and\r\n    known to be so; (_b_) and besides that there is so little easy\r\n    contact with the small fry, as when Palmerston sat in the\r\n    tea-room, and men were gratified by getting private speech with\r\n    their leader. But this is a small matter compared with (_a_).\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Gladstone to T. D. Acland._\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, Jan. 30, ’68._—Be assured I cannot feel otherwise than\r\n    grateful to you for undertaking what in the main must always be a\r\n    thankless office. It is new to me to have critics such as those\r\n    whom you represent under the first head, and who complain that I\r\n    do not attend to my business, while the complaint is illustrated\r\n    by an instance in which, professing to seek a man’s opinion, I\r\n    poured forth instead the matter with which I was overflowing. Nor\r\n    do I well know how to deal with those who take out of my hands the\r\n    direction of my own conduct on such a question as the question\r\n    whether I ought to have undertaken a mission to Sheffield to meet\r\n    Roebuck on his own ground. I am afraid I can offer them little\r\n    satisfaction. I have been for near thirty-six years at public\r\n    business, and I must myself be the judge how best to husband what\r\n    little energy of brain, and time for using it, may remain to me.\r\n    If I am told I should go to Sheffield instead of writing on _Ecce\r\n    Homo_, I answer that it was my Sunday’s work, and change of work\r\n    is the chief refreshment to my mind. It is true that literature is\r\n    very attractive and indeed seductive to me, but I do not\r\n    _knowingly_ allow it to cause neglect of public business.\r\n    Undoubtedly it may be said that the vacation should be given to\r\n    reading up and preparing materials for the session. And of my nine\r\n    last vacations _this one only_ has in part been given to any\r\n    literary work, if I except the preparation of an address for\r\n    Edinburgh in 1865. But I am sincerely, though it may be\r\n    erroneously, impressed with the belief that the quantity of my\r\n    public work cannot be increased without its quality being yet\r\n    further deteriorated. Perhaps my critics have not been troubled as\r\n    I have with this plague of quantity, and are not as deeply\r\n    impressed as I am with the belief that grinding down the mental\r\n    powers by an infinity of detail, is what now principally dwarfs\r\n    our public men, to the immense detriment of the country. This\r\n    conviction I cannot yield; nor can I say more than that, with\r\n    regard to the personal matters which you name, I will do the best\r\n    I can. But what I have always supposed and understood is that my\r\n    business in endeavouring to follow other and better men, is to be\r\n    thoroughly open to all members of parliament who seek me, while my\r\n    seeking them must of necessity be limited.... We have before us so\r\n    much business that I fear a _jumble_. Reform, Education, and\r\n    Ireland each in many branches will compete; any of these alone\r\n    would be enough. The last is in my mind the imperious and\r\n    overpowering subject.... The aspect of this letter is, I think,\r\n    rather combative. It would have been much less so but that I trust\r\n    entirely to your indulgence.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a second letter, after mentioning again some of these complaints,\r\nAcland says: “On the other hand I know you are held by some of the best\r\nmen (that dear, noble George Grey I am thinking of) to have the great\r\nquality of leadership: such clear apprehension of the points in council,\r\nand such faithful exactness in conveying the result agreed on, truly a\r\ngreat power for one who has such a _copia verborum_, with its\r\ntemptations.” He still insists that a leader should drop into the tea-room\r\nand have afternoon chats with his adherents; and earnestly wishes him to\r\nbelong to the Athenæum club, “a great centre of intellect and criticism,”\r\nwhere he would be sure to meet colleagues and the principal men in the\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\n(M50) All this was good advice enough, and most loyally intended. But it\r\nwas work of supererogation. The House of Commons, like all assemblies, is\r\neven less affected by immediate displays than by the standing impression\r\nof power. Mr. Gladstone might be playful, courteous, reserved, gracious,\r\nsilent, but the House always knew that he had a sledge-hammer behind his\r\nback, ready for work on every anvil in that resounding forge. His sheer\r\nintellectual strength, his experience and power in affairs, the tremendous\r\nhold that he had now gained upon the general public out of doors, made the\r\nartful genialities of the tea-room pure superfluity. Of the secret of the\r\nrapidity with which his star was rising, and of the popular expectations\r\nthereby signified, an admirable contemporary account was traced by an\r\nexcellent observer,(126) and it would be idle to transcribe the pith of it\r\nin words other than his own:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gladstone’s policy is coming to be used as the concrete\r\n    expression of a whole system of thought, to mean something for\r\n    itself, and something widely different from either the policy\r\n    pursued by whigs, or the policy attributed to Lord Palmerston.\r\n    This is the more remarkable because Mr. Gladstone has done less to\r\n    lay down any systematised course of action than almost any man of\r\n    his political standing, has a cautiousness of speech which\r\n    frequently puzzles his audience even while they are cheering his\r\n    oratory, and perceives alternatives with a clearness which often\r\n    leaves on his own advice an impression of indecision.... Those who\r\n    are applauding the chancellor of the exchequer, in season and out\r\n    of season, seem, however they may put their aspirations, to\r\n    expect, should he lead the House of Commons, two very important\r\n    changes. They think that he will realise two longings of which\r\n    they are deeply conscious, even while they express their\r\n    hopelessness of speedy realisation. They believe, with certain\r\n    misgivings, that he can offer them a new and more satisfactory\r\n    system of foreign policy; and, with no misgivings, that he will\r\n    break up the torpor which has fallen upon internal affairs. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, say his admirers, may be too much afraid of war, too\r\n    zealous for economy, too certain of the status of England as a\r\n    fact altogether independent of her action. But he is sure to\r\n    abandon those traditional ideas to which we have adhered so long:\r\n    the notion that we are a continental people, bound to maintain the\r\n    continental system, interested in petty matters of boundary,\r\n    concerned to dictate to Germany whether she shall be united or\r\n    not, to the Christians of Servia whether they shall rebel against\r\n    the Turk or obey him, to everybody whether they shall or shall not\r\n    develop themselves as they can. He is sure to initiate that\r\n    temporary policy of abstention which is needed to make a breach in\r\n    the great chain of English traditions, and enable the nation to\r\n    act as its interests or duties or dignity may require, without\r\n    reference to the mode in which it has acted heretofore. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, for example, certainly would not support the Turk as if\r\n    Turkish sway were a moral law, would not trouble himself to\r\n    interfere with the project for cutting an Eider Canal, would not\r\n    from very haughtiness of temperament protest in the face of Europe\r\n    unless he intended his protests to be followed by some form of\r\n    action.... That impression may be true or it may be false, but it\r\n    exists; it is justified in part by Mr. Gladstone’s recent\r\n    speeches, and it indicates a very noteworthy change in the\r\n    disposition of the public mind: a weariness of the line of action\r\n    called “a spirited foreign policy.” ... The expectation as to\r\n    internal affairs is far more definite and more strong.... All his\r\n    speeches point to the inauguration of a new activity in all\r\n    internal affairs, to a steady determination to improve, if\r\n    possible, both the constitution and the condition of the millions\r\n    who have to live under it. Most ministers have that idea in their\r\n    heads, but Mr. Gladstone has more than the idea, he has plans, and\r\n    the courage to propose and maintain them. He is not afraid of the\r\n    suffrage, as he indicated in his celebrated speech; he is not\r\n    alarmed at risking the treasury as his reductions have proved;\r\n    does not hesitate to apply the full power of the state to\r\n    ameliorate social anomalies, as he showed by creating state banks,\r\n    state insurance offices, and state annuity funds for the very\r\n    poor. He of all men alive could most easily reduce our anarchical\r\n    ecclesiastical system into something like order; he, perhaps,\r\n    alone among statesmen would have the art and the energy to try as\r\n    a deliberate plan to effect the final conciliation of\r\n    Ireland....(127)\r\n\r\n\r\n(M51) A letter from Francis Newman to Mr. Gladstone is a good illustration\r\nof the almost passionate going out of men’s hearts to him in those days:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Until a practical reason for addressing you arose out of ... I did\r\n    not dare to intrude on you sentiments which are happily shared by\r\n    so many thousands of warm and simple hearts; sentiments of warm\r\n    admiration, deep sympathy, fervent hope, longing expectation of\r\n    lasting national blessing from your certain elevation to high\r\n    responsibility. The rude, monstrous, shameful and shameless\r\n    attacks which you have endured, do but endear you to the nation.\r\n    In the moral power which you wield, go on to elevate and purify\r\n    public life, and we shall all bless you, dear sir, as a\r\n    regenerator of England. Keep the hearts of the people. _They_ will\r\n    never envy you and never forsake you.\r\n\r\n\r\nChurch, afterwards the dean of St. Paul’s, a man who united in so\r\nwonderful a degree the best gifts that come of culture, sound and just\r\nsense, and unstained purity of spirit, said of Mr. Gladstone at the moment\r\nof accession to power, “There never was a man so genuinely admired for the\r\nqualities which deserve admiration—his earnestness, his deep popular\r\nsympathies, his unflinching courage; and there never was a man more deeply\r\nhated both for his good points and for undeniable defects and failings.\r\nBut they love him much less in the House than they do out of doors. A\r\nstrong vein of sentiment is the spring of what is noblest about his\r\nimpulses; but it is a perilous quality too.”(128) An accomplished woman\r\nwith many public interests met Mr. Bright in Scotland sometime after this.\r\n“He would not hear a word said against Mr. Gladstone. He said it was just\r\nbecause people were not good enough themselves to understand him that he\r\nmet such abuse, and then he quoted the stanza in the third canto of\r\n_Childe Harold_:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “He who ascends to mountain-tops, shall find\r\n    The loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow;\r\n    He who surpasses or subdues mankind,\r\n    Must look down on the hate of those below.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked if he did not think sometimes his temper carried Mr. Gladstone\r\naway. He said, ‘Think of the difference between a great cart horse, and\r\nthe highest bred most sensitive horse you can imagine, and then, under\r\nlashing of a whip, think of the difference between them.’ ” After a stay\r\nwith Mr. Gladstone in a country house, Jowett, the master of Balliol, said\r\nof him, “It is the first time that any one of such great simplicity has\r\nbeen in so exalted a station.”(129)\r\n\r\nIn one of his Lancashire speeches, Mr. Gladstone described in interesting\r\nlanguage how he stood:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have never swerved from what I conceive to be those truly\r\n    conservative objects and desires with which I entered life. I am,\r\n    if possible, more attached to the institutions of my country than\r\n    I was when, as a boy, I wandered among the sandhills of Seaforth,\r\n    or frequented the streets of Liverpool. But experience has brought\r\n    with it its lessons. I have learnt that there is a wisdom in a\r\n    policy of trust, and folly in a policy of mistrust. I have not\r\n    refused to acknowledge and accept the signs of the times. I have\r\n    observed the effect that has been produced upon the country by\r\n    what is generally known as liberal legislation. And if we are\r\n    told, as we are now truly told, that all the feelings of the\r\n    country are in the best and broadest sense conservative—that is to\r\n    say, that the people value the country and the laws and\r\n    institutions of the country—honesty compels me to admit that this\r\n    happy result has been brought about by liberal legislation.\r\n    Therefore, I may presume to say that since the year 1841, when Sir\r\n    Robert Peel thought fit to place me in a position that brought me\r\n    into direct, immediate, and responsible contact with the\r\n    commercial interests of the country, from that time onward I have\r\n    never swerved nor wavered, but have striven to the best of my\r\n    ability to advance in the work of improving the laws, and to\r\n    labour earnestly and fearlessly for the advantage of the\r\n    people.(130)\r\n\r\n\r\n(M52) Five-and-twenty years later, when his course was almost run, and the\r\nachievements of the long laborious day were over, he said:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have been a learner all my life, and I am a learner still; but I\r\n    do wish to learn upon just principles. I have some ideas that may\r\n    not be thought to furnish good materials for a liberal politician.\r\n    I do not like changes for their own sake, I only like a change\r\n    when it is needful to alter something bad into something good, or\r\n    something which is good into something better. I have a great\r\n    reverence for antiquity. I rejoice in the great deeds of our\r\n    fathers in England and in Scotland. It may be said, however, that\r\n    this does not go very far towards making a man a liberal. I find,\r\n    however, that the tories when it suits their purpose have much\r\n    less reverence for antiquity than I have. They make changes with\r\n    great rapidity, provided they are suitable to the promotion of\r\n    tory interests. But the basis of my liberalism is this. It is the\r\n    lesson which I have been learning ever since I was young. I am a\r\n    lover of liberty; and that liberty which I value for myself, I\r\n    value for every human being in proportion to his means and\r\n    opportunities. That is a basis on which I find it perfectly\r\n    practicable to work in conjunction with a dislike to unreasoned\r\n    change and a profound reverence for everything ancient, provided\r\n    that reverence is deserved. There are those who have been so happy\r\n    that they have been born with a creed that they can usefully\r\n    maintain to the last. For my own part, as I have been a learner\r\n    all my life, a learner I must continue to be.(131)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII. Letters. (1859-1868)\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is no saying shocks me so much as that which I hear very\r\n    often; that a man does not know how to pass his time. ’Twould have\r\n    been but ill spoken by Methusalem, in the nine hundred sixty-ninth\r\n    year of his life; so far it is from us, who have not time enough\r\n    to attain to the utmost perfection of any part of any science, to\r\n    have cause to complain that we are forced to be idle for want of\r\n    work.—COWLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M53) As I said in our opening pages, Mr. Gladstone’s letters are mostly\r\nconcerned with points of business. They were not with him a medium for\r\nconveying the slighter incidents, fugitive moods, fleeting thoughts, of\r\nlife. Perhaps of these fugitive moods he may have had too few. To me, says\r\nCrassus in Cicero, the man hardly seems to be free, who does not sometimes\r\ndo nothing.(132) In table-talk he could be as disengaged, as marked in\r\nease and charm, as any one; he was as willing as any one to accept topics\r\nas they came, which is the first of all conditions for good conversation.\r\nWhen alone in his temple of peace it was not his practice to take up his\r\npen in the same sauntering and devious humour. With him the pen was no\r\ninstrument of diversion. His correspondence has an object, and a letter\r\nwith an object is not of a piece with the effusions of Madame de Sévigné,\r\nCowper, Scott, FitzGerald, and other men and women whose letters of genial\r\nsatire and casual play and hints of depth below the surface, people will\r\nread as long as they read anything. We have to remember a very\r\nintelligible fact mentioned by him to Lord Brougham, who had asked him to\r\nundertake some public address (April 25, 1860):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    You have given me credit for your own activity and power of work:\r\n    an estimate far beyond the truth. I am one of those who work very\r\n    hard while they are at it, and are then left in much exhaustion. I\r\n    have been for four months overdone, and though my general health,\r\n    thank God, is good, yet my brain warns me so distinctly that it\r\n    must not be too much pressed, as to leave me in prudence no course\r\n    to take except that which I have reluctantly indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe might be tempted to call good letter-writing one of “the little\r\nhandicraft of an idle man”; but then two of the most perfect masters of\r\nthe art were Cicero and Voltaire, two of the most occupied personages that\r\never lived. Of course, sentences emerge in Mr. Gladstone’s letters that\r\nare the fruits of his experience, well worthy of a note, as when he says\r\nto Dr. Pusey: “I doubt from your letter whether you are aware of the\r\nvirulence and intensity with which the poison of suspicion acts in public\r\nlife. All that you say in your letter of yesterday I can readily believe,\r\nbut I assure you it does not alter in the slightest degree the grounds on\r\nwhich my last letter was written.”\r\n\r\nHe thanks Bulwer Lytton for a volume of his republished poems, but chides\r\nhim for not indicating dates:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    This I grant is not always easy for a conscientious man, for\r\n    example when he has almost re-written. But I need not remind you\r\n    how much the public, if I may judge from one of its number, would\r\n    desire it when it can be done. For in the case of those whom it\r\n    has learned to honour and admire, there is a biography of the mind\r\n    that is thus signified, and that is matter of deep interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn external incidents, he never fails in a graceful, apt, or feeling word.\r\nWhen the author of _The Christian Year_ dies (1866), he says: “Mr. Liddon\r\nsent me very early information of Mr. Keble’s death. The church of England\r\nhas lost in him a poet, a scholar, a philosopher, and a saint. I must add\r\nthat he always appeared to me, since I had the honour and pleasure of\r\nknowing him, a person of most liberal mind. I hope early steps will be\r\ntaken to do honour to his pure and noble memory.”\r\n\r\nTo the widow of a valued official in his financial department he writes in\r\ncommemorative sentences that testify to his warm appreciation of zeal in\r\npublic duty:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The civil service of the crown has beyond all question lost in Mr.\r\n    Arbuthnot one of the highest ornaments it ever possessed. His\r\n    devotion to his duties, his identification at every point of his\r\n    own feelings with the public interests, will, I trust, not die\r\n    with him, but will stimulate others, and especially the inheritors\r\n    of his name, to follow his bright example.... Nor is it with a\r\n    thought of anything but thankfulness on his account, that I\r\n    contemplate the close of his labours; but it will be long indeed\r\n    before we cease to miss his great experience, his varied powers,\r\n    his indefatigable energy, and that high-minded loyal tone which he\r\n    carried into all the parts of business.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another letter, by the way, he says (1866): “I am far from thinking\r\nvery highly of our rank as a nation of administrators, but perhaps if we\r\ncould be judged by the post office alone, we might claim the very first\r\nplace in this respect.” In time even this ’most wonderful establishment’\r\nwas to give him trouble enough.\r\n\r\n(M54) Among the letters in which Mr. Gladstone exhibits the easier and\r\nless strenuous side, and that have the indefinable attraction of intimacy,\r\npleasantness, and the light hand, are those written in the ten years\r\nbetween 1858 and 1868 to the Duchess of Sutherland. She was the close and\r\nlifelong friend of the Queen. She is, said the Queen to Stockmar, “so\r\nanxious to do good, so liberal-minded, so superior to prejudice, and so\r\neager to learn, and to improve herself and others.”(133) The centre of a\r\nbrilliant and powerful social circle, she was an ardent sympathiser with\r\nItaly, with Poland, with the Abolitionists and the North, and with humane\r\ncauses at home. She was accomplished, a lover of books meritorious in aim\r\nthough too often slight in work—in short, with emotions and sentiments\r\nsometimes a little in advance of definite ideas, yet a high representative\r\nof the virtue, purity, simplicity, and sympathetic spirit of the\r\nTennysonian epoch. Tennyson himself was one of her idols, and Mr.\r\nGladstone was another. Bishop Wilberforce too was often of the company,\r\nand the Duke of Argyll, who had married a daughter of the house. Her\r\nadmiration for Gladstone, says the son of the duchess, “was boundless, and\r\nthe last years of her life were certainly made happier by this friendship.\r\nHis visits to her were always an intense pleasure, and even when suffering\r\ntoo much to receive others, she would always make an effort to appear\r\nsufficiently well to receive him. I find in a letter from her written to\r\nme in 1863, after meeting Mr. Gladstone when on a visit to her sister,\r\nLady Taunton, at Quantock, in Somersetshire, the following: ‘The\r\nGladstones were there; he was quite delightful, pouring out such floods of\r\nagreeable knowledge all day long, and singing admirably in the evening.\r\nNobody makes me feel more the happiness of knowledge and the wish for it;\r\none must not forget that he has the happiness of the peace which passeth\r\nall understanding.’ ”(134) The Gladstones were constant visitors at the\r\nduchess’s various princely homes—Stafford House in the Green Park,\r\nTrentham, Cliveden, and Chiswick on the Thames, Dunrobin on the Dornoch\r\nFirth.\r\n\r\nA little sheaf of pieces from Mr. Gladstone’s letters to her may serve to\r\nshow him as he was, in the midst of his labours in the Palmerston\r\ngovernment—how little his native kindliness of heart and power of sympathy\r\nhad been chilled or parched either by hard and ceaseless toil, or by the\r\ntrying atmosphere of public strife.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _1859_\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 30._—I am much concerned to lose at the last moment the\r\n    pleasure of coming to see you at Trentham—but my wife, who was not\r\n    quite well when I came away but hoped a day’s rest would make her\r\n    so, writes through Agnes to say she hopes I shall get back to-day.\r\n    The gratification promised me must, therefore, I fear, stand over.\r\n    I will write from Hawarden, and I now send this by a messenger\r\n    lest (as you might be sure I should not fail through carelessness)\r\n    you should think anything very bad had happened. Among other\r\n    things, I wanted help from you through speech about Tennyson. I\r\n    find _Maud_ takes a good deal of trouble to understand, and is\r\n    hardly worth understanding. It has many peculiar beauties, but\r\n    against them one sets the strange and nearly frantic passages\r\n    about war; which one can hardly tell whether he means to be taken\r\n    for sense or ravings. Frank Doyle, who is essentially a poet\r\n    though an unwrought one, declares _Guinevere_ the finest poem of\r\n    modern times.\r\n\r\n    _1860_\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, Oct. 3._—We are exceedingly happy at Penmaenmawr,\r\n    between Italy, health, hill, and sea all taken together. I do not\r\n    know if you are acquainted with the Welsh coast and interior; but\r\n    I am sure you would think it well worth knowing both for the\r\n    solitary grandeur of the Snowdon group, and for the widely\r\n    diffused and almost endless beauty of detail. It is a kind of\r\n    landscape jewellery.\r\n\r\n    The Herberts send us an excellent account of Lord Aberdeen. I have\r\n    a very interesting letter from Lacaita, fresh from Panizzi, who\r\n    again was fresh from Italy, and sanguine about the Emperor. But\r\n    what a calamity for a man to think, or find himself forced to be\r\n    double faced even when he is not double minded; and this is the\r\n    best supposition. But Warsaw is surely the point at which for the\r\n    present we must look with suspicion and aversion. To-day’s papers\r\n    give good hope that Garibaldi has been misrepresented and does not\r\n    mean to play into Mazzini’s hands.\r\n\r\n    Thanks for your condolences about the _Times_. I have had it both\r\n    ways, though more, perhaps, of the one than the other. Some of the\r\n    penny press, which has now acquired an enormous expansion, go\r\n    great lengths in my favour, and I read some eulogies quite as wide\r\n    of fact as the interpretations.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 19._—I think Mr. or Sir something Burke (how ungrateful!)\r\n    has been so kind as to discover the honours of my mother’s descent\r\n    in some book that he has published on royal descents. But the\r\n    truth is that time plays strange tricks backwards as well as\r\n    forwards, and it seems hardly fair to pick the results. The\r\n    arithmetic of those questions is very curious: at the distance of\r\n    a moderate number of centuries everybody has some hundred thousand\r\n    ancestors, subject, however, to deduction.\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 1._—... There is one proposition which the experience of\r\n    life burns into my soul; it is this, that man should beware of\r\n    letting his religion spoil his morality. In a thousand ways, some\r\n    great some small, but all subtle, we are daily tempted to that\r\n    great sin. To speak of such a thing seems dishonouring to God; but\r\n    it is not religion as it comes from Him, it is religion with the\r\n    strange and evil mixtures which it gathers from abiding in us.\r\n    This frightful evil seems to rage in the Roman church more than\r\n    anywhere else, probably from its highly wrought political spirit,\r\n    the virtues and the vices of a close organisation being much\r\n    associated with one another. That same influence which keeps the\r\n    mother from her child teaches Montalembert to glorify the\r\n    corruption, cruelty, and baseness which in the government of the\r\n    papal states put the gospel itself to shame.\r\n\r\n    _1861_\r\n\r\n    _11 Carlton H. Terrace, March 5._—I dare scarcely reply to your\r\n    letter, for although the scene at Trentham [the death of the Duke\r\n    of Sutherland] is much upon my mind, it is, amidst this crowd and\r\n    pressure of business, an image reflected in ruffled waters, while\r\n    it is also eminently one that ought to be kept true. A sacred\r\n    sorrow seems to be profaned by bringing it within the touch of\r\n    worldly cares. Still I am able, I hope not unnaturally, to speak\r\n    of the pleasure which your letter has given me, for I could not\r\n    wish it other than it is.\r\n\r\n    I am not one of those who think that after a stroke like this, it\r\n    is our duty to try and make it seem less than it is. It is great\r\n    for all, for you it is immense, for there has now been first\r\n    loosened and then removed, the central stay of such a continuation\r\n    of domestic love as I should not greatly exaggerate in calling\r\n    without rival or example; and if its stay centred in him, so did\r\n    its fire in you. I only wish and heartily pray that your sorrow\r\n    may be a tender and gentle one, even as it is great and strong. I\r\n    call it great and strong _more_ than sharp, for then only the\r\n    fierceness of Death is felt when it leaves painful and rankling\r\n    thoughts of the departed, or when it breaks the kindly process of\r\n    nature and reverses the order in which she would have us quit the\r\n    place of our pilgrimage, by ravishing away those whose life is but\r\n    just opened or is yet unfulfilled. But you are now yearning over a\r\n    Death which has come softly to your door and gone softly from it;\r\n    a death in ripeness of years, ripeness of love and honour and\r\n    peace, ripeness above all in character.... A part of your letter\r\n    brings to my mind a letter of St. Bernard on the death of his\r\n    brother (remember he was a monk and so what a brother might be to\r\n    him) which when I read it years ago seemed to me the most touching\r\n    and beautiful expression of a natural grief that I had ever\r\n    known—I will try to find it, and if I find it answers my\r\n    recollection, you shall hear of it again.(135) I always think\r\n    Thomas à Kempis a golden book for all times, but most for times\r\n    like these; for though it does not treat professedly of sorrow, it\r\n    is such a wonderful exhibition of the Man of Sorrows....\r\n\r\n    _1862_\r\n\r\n    _April 4._—I am grateful to you and to your thoughts for the\r\n    quality they so eminently possess; the Latins have a word for it,\r\n    but we have none, and I can only render it by a rude conversion\r\n    into “sequacious,” or thoughts given to following.\r\n\r\n    My labours of yesterday [budget speech] had no title to so kind a\r\n    reception as they actually met with. Quiet my office in these\r\n    times cannot be, but this year it promises me the boon of\r\n    comparative peace, at least in the outer sphere. The world\r\n    believes that this is what I cannot endure; I shall be glad of an\r\n    opportunity of putting its opinion to the test.\r\n\r\n    All words from you about the Queen are full of weight and value\r\n    even when they are not so decidedly words of consolation. In her,\r\n    I am even glad to hear of the little bit of symbolism. That\r\n    principle like others has its place, and its applications I\r\n    believe are right when they flow from and conform to what is\r\n    within. I cannot but hope she will have much refreshment in\r\n    Scotland. Such contact with Nature’s own very undisguised and\r\n    noble self, in such forms of mountain, wood, breeze, and water!\r\n    These are continual preachers, and so mild that they can bring no\r\n    weariness. They come straight from their Maker’s hand, and how\r\n    faithfully they speak of Him in their strength, their majesty, and\r\n    their calm.\r\n\r\n    As for myself I am a discharged vessel to-day, A load of figures\r\n    has a suffocating effect upon the brain until they are well\r\n    drilled and have taken their places. Then they are as digestible\r\n    as other food of that region; still it is better when they are\r\n    off, and it is always a step towards liberty.\r\n\r\n    I must at some time try to explain a little more my reference to\r\n    Thomas à Kempis. I have given that book to men of uncultivated\r\n    minds, who were _also_ presbyterians, but all relish it. I do not\r\n    believe it is possible for any one to read that book earnestly\r\n    from its beginning, and think of popish, or non-popish, or of\r\n    anything but the man whom it presents and brings to us.\r\n\r\n    _May 8._—Unfortunately I can give you no light on the question of\r\n    time. I, a bear chained to a stake, cannot tell when the principal\r\n    run will be made at me, and as I can only scratch once I must wait\r\n    if possible till then. The only person who could give you _des\r\n    renseignements suffisants_ is Disraeli. Tennyson’s note is\r\n    charming. I return it, and with it a touching note from Princess\r\n    Alice, which reached me this evening. Pray let me have it again.\r\n\r\n    _1863_\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 23._—I am so sorry to be unable to come to you, owing to an\r\n    engagement to-night at the admiralty. I am ashamed of being\r\n    utterly destitute of news—full of figures and all manner of\r\n    dulnesses.... I went, however, to the Drury Lane pantomime last\r\n    night, and laughed beyond measure; also enjoyed looking from a\r\n    third row, unseen myself, at your brother and the Blantyre party.\r\n\r\n    _Bowden Park, Chippenham, Feb. 7._—I feel as if your generous and\r\n    overflowing sympathies made it truly unkind to draw you further\r\n    into the sorrows of this darkened house. My brother [John] closed\r\n    his long and arduous battle in peace this morning at six o’clock;\r\n    and if the knowledge that he had the love of all who knew him,\r\n    together with the assurance that he is at rest in God, could\r\n    satisfy the heart, we ought not to murmur. But the visitation is\r\n    no common one. Eight children, seven of them daughters, of whom\r\n    only one is married and most are young, with one little boy of\r\n    seven, lost their mother last February, and now see their father\r\n    taken. He dies on his marriage day, we are to bury him on the\r\n    first anniversary of his wife’s death. Altogether it is piteous\r\n    beyond belief. It was affectionate anxiety in her illness that\r\n    undermined his health; it was reluctance to make his children\r\n    uneasy that made him suffer in silence, and travel to Bath for\r\n    advice and an operation when he should have been in his bed. In\r\n    this double sense he has offered up his life. The grief is very\r\n    sharp, and as yet I am hardly reconciled to it.... But enough and\r\n    too much. Only I must answer your question. He was the brother\r\n    next above me; we were not brothers only but very intimate friends\r\n    until we married, and since then we have only been separated in\r\n    the relative sense in which our marriages and my public life in\r\n    particular, implied. He was a man of high spirit and uncommon\r\n    goodness, and for _him_ I have not a thought that is not perfect\r\n    confidence and peace.\r\n\r\n    _March 1._—Even you could not, I am persuaded, do otherwise than\r\n    think me rather a savage on Wednesday evening, for the opinion I\r\n    gave about helping a bazaar for the sisters of charity of the\r\n    Roman community at some place in England. Let me say what I meant\r\n    by it and what I did not mean. I did not mean to act as one under\r\n    the influence of violent anti-Roman feeling. I rejoice to think in\r\n    community of faith among bodies externally separated, so far as it\r\n    extends, and it extends very far; most of all with ancient\r\n    churches of the greatest extent and the firmest organisation. But\r\n    the proselytising agency of the Roman church in this country I\r\n    take to be one of the worst of the religious influences of the\r\n    age. I do not mean as to its motives, for these I do not presume\r\n    to touch, nor feel in any way called upon to question. But I speak\r\n    of its effects, and they are most deplorable. The social misery\r\n    that has been caused, not for truth, but for loss of truth, is\r\n    grievous enough, but it is not all, for to those who are called\r\n    converts, and to those who have made them, we owe a very large\r\n    proportion of the mischiefs and scandals within our own communion,\r\n    that have destroyed the faith of many, and that are I fear\r\n    undermining the very principle of faith in thousands and tens of\r\n    thousands who as yet suspect neither the process nor the cause.\r\n    With this pernicious agency I for my own part wish to have nothing\r\n    whatever to do; although I am one who thinks lightly, in\r\n    comparison with most men, of the _absolute_ differences in our\r\n    belief from the formal documents of the church of Rome, and who\r\n    wish for that church, on her own ground, as for our own, all\r\n    health that she can desire, all reformation that can be good for\r\n    her. The object, however, of what I have said is not to make an\r\n    argument, but only to show that if I spoke strongly, I was not\r\n    also speaking lightly on such a subject.\r\n\r\n    _April 20._—I am afraid I shall not see you before Wednesday—when\r\n    you are to do us so great a kindness—but I must write a line to\r\n    tell you how exceedingly delighted we both are with all we have\r\n    seen at Windsor. The charm of the princess, so visible at a\r\n    distance, increases with the increase of nearness; the Queen’s\r\n    tone is delightful. All seems good, delighted, and happy in the\r\n    family. As regards the Queen’s physical strength, it must be\r\n    satisfactory. What is more fatiguing than interviews? Last night,\r\n    however, I saw her at half-past seven, after a long course of them\r\n    during the day. She was quite fresh.\r\n\r\n    _May 10._—I can answer you with a very good conscience. The affair\r\n    of Friday night [his speech on Italy] was on my part entirely\r\n    drawn forth by the speech of Disraeli and the wish of Lord\r\n    Palmerston. It is D.’s practice, in contravention of the usage of\r\n    the House, which allows the minister to wind up, to lie by until\r\n    Lord Palmerston has spoken, and then fire in upon him. So on this\r\n    occasion I was a willing instrument; but my wife, who was within\r\n    ten minutes’ drive, knew nothing.\r\n\r\n    We dined at Marlborough House last night. The charm certainly does\r\n    not wear off with renewed opportunity. Clarendon, who saw her for\r\n    the first time, _fully_ felt it. Do you know, I believe they are\r\n    actually disposed to dine with us some day. Do you think you can\r\n    _then_ be tempted? We asked the Bishop of Brechin to meet you on\r\n    Thursday. Another bishop has volunteered: the Bishop of Montreal,\r\n    who is just going off to America. You will not be frightened. Both\r\n    are rather notable men. The other guests engaged are Cobden,\r\n    Thackeray, and Mr. Evarts, the new U.S. coadjutor to Adams.\r\n\r\n    _July 10._—I knew too well the meaning of your non-appearance, and\r\n    because I knew it, was sorry for your indisposition as well as for\r\n    your absence. We had the De Greys, Granville, Sir C. Eastlake,\r\n    Fechter(136) and others, with the Comte de Paris, who is as simple\r\n    as ever, but greatly developed and come on. He talked much of\r\n    America. I hope we may come to-morrow, not later than by the 5.5\r\n    train, to which I feel a kind of grateful attachment for the\r\n    advantage and pleasure it has so often procured me. We are glad to\r\n    have a hope of you next week. All our people are charmed with Mr.\r\n    Fechter.—Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n    _July 29._—I am greatly concerned to hear of your suffering. You\r\n    are not easily arrested in your movements, and I fear the time has\r\n    been sharp. But (while above all I trust you will not stir without\r\n    free and full permission) I do not abandon the hope of seeing you\r\n    ... I have been seeing Lady Theresa Lewis. It was heartrending\r\n    woe; such as makes one ashamed of having so little to offer. She\r\n    dwells much upon employing herself.... I greatly mistrust\r\n    compulsion in the management of children, and under the\r\n    circumstances you describe, I should lean as you do. ... Many\r\n    thanks for the carnations you sent by my wife; they still live and\r\n    breathe perfume.... You spoke of our difference about slavery. I\r\n    hope it is not very wide. I stop short of war as a means of\r\n    correction. I have not heard you say that you do otherwise.\r\n\r\n    _11 Carlton House Terrace_ (_no date_).—I am glad my wife saw you\r\n    yesterday, for I hope a little that she may have been bold enough\r\n    to lecture you about not taking enough care of yourself. If this\r\n    sounds rather intrusive, pray put it down to my intense confidence\r\n    in her as a doctor. She has a kind of divining power springing\r\n    partly from a habitual gift and partly from experience, and she\r\n    hardly ever goes wrong. She is not easy about your going to Vichy\r\n    alone. The House of Commons, rude and unmannerly in its\r\n    arrangements at all times, is singularly so in its last kicks and\r\n    plunges towards the death of the session; but after to-morrow we\r\n    are free and I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday according\r\n    to the hope you give.... Soon after this reaches you I hope to be\r\n    at Hawarden. On Wednesday I am to have luncheon at Argyll Lodge to\r\n    meet Tennyson. Since I gave him my translation of the first book\r\n    of the _Iliad_, I have often remembered those words of Kingsley’s\r\n    to his friend Mr.——, “My dear friend, your verses are not good but\r\n    bad.” The Duc d’Aumale breakfasted with us on Thursday and I had\r\n    some conversation about America. He is, I think, pleased with the\r\n    good opinions which the young princes have won so largely, and\r\n    seems to have come very reluctantly to the conclusion that the war\r\n    is hopeless. Our children are gone and the vacant footfall echoes\r\n    on the stair. My wife is waiting here only to see Lady Herbert.\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, Aug. 21._—We have had Dr. Stanley here with his sister.\r\n    He was charming, she only stayed a moment. He gave a good account\r\n    of the Queen. They go to Italy for September and October. When any\r\n    one goes there I always feel a mental process of accompanying\r\n    them. We have got Mr. Woolner here too. He took it into his head\r\n    to wish to make a bust of me, and my wife accepted his offer, at\r\n    least by her authority caused me to accept it. He has worked very\r\n    quickly and I think with much success, but he bestows immense\r\n    labour before closing. He is a poet too, it seems, and generally a\r\n    very good companion.... My journey to Balmoral will not be for\r\n    some five weeks. I am dreadfully indolent as to any exertion\r\n    beyond reading, but I look forward to it with interest.... Indeed\r\n    your scruples about writing were misplaced. There is no holiday of\r\n    mine to leave unbroken so far as post is concerned, and well would\r\n    it be with me, even in the time of an exhaustion which requires to\r\n    be felt before it can pass away, if the words of my other letters\r\n    were, I will not say like, but more like, yours. However, the\r\n    murmur which I thus let escape me is ungrateful. I ought to be\r\n    thankful for the remission that I get, but treasury business is\r\n    the most odious that I know, and hence it is that one wishes that\r\n    the wheel would for a little time cease its drive altogether,\r\n    instead of merely lowering it.\r\n\r\n    _Penmaenmawr, Sept. 20._—It was so kind of you to see our little\r\n    fellows on their way through town. I hope they were not\r\n    troublesome. Harry is rather oppressed, I think, with the\r\n    responsibilities of his captainship—he is the head of seven boys!\r\n\r\n    We went yesterday to visit the Stanleys, and saw the South Stack\r\n    Lighthouse with its grand and savage rocks. They are very\r\n    remarkable, one part for masses of sheer precipices descending in\r\n    columns to the sea, the other for the extraordinary contortions\r\n    which the rocks have undergone from igneous action and huge\r\n    compressing forces. Our weather has been and continues cold for\r\n    the season, which draws onwards, however, and the gliding days\r\n    recall to mind the busy outer world from which we are so well\r\n    defended.\r\n\r\n    _1864_\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 4._—Often as I have been struck by the Queen’s extraordinary\r\n    integrity of mind—I know of no better expression—I never felt it\r\n    more than on hearing and reading a letter of hers on Saturday (at\r\n    the cabinet) about the Danish question. Her determination in this\r\n    case as in others, not inwardly to “sell the truth” (this is\r\n    Robert Pollok) overbears all prepossessions and longings, strong\r\n    as they are, on the German side, and enables her spontaneously to\r\n    hold the balance, it seems to me, tolerably even.\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 14._—I am glad you were not scandalised about my laxity as\r\n    to the “public house.” But I expected from you this liberality. I\r\n    really had no choice. How can I who drink good wine and bitter\r\n    beer every day of my life, in a comfortable room and among\r\n    friends, coolly stand up and advise hardworking fellow-creatures\r\n    to take “the pledge”? However, I have been reading Maguire’s _Life\r\n    of Father Matthew_, with a most glowing admiration for the Father.\r\n    Every one knew him to be good, but I had no idea of the extent and\r\n    height of his goodness, and his boundless power and thirst not for\r\n    giving only but for loving.\r\n\r\n    _June 27._—Just at this time when the press and mass of ordinary\r\n    business ought to be lessening, the foreign crisis you see comes\r\n    upon us, and drowns us deeper than ever. I fully believe that\r\n    England _will_ not go to war, and I am sure she _ought_ not. Are\r\n    you not a little alarmed at Argyll on this matter? Of the fate of\r\n    the government I cannot speak with much confidence or with much\r\n    anxious desire; but on the whole I _rather_ think, and _rather_\r\n    hope, we shall come through.\r\n\r\n    Three marriages almost in as many weeks among your own immediate\r\n    kin! I look for a dinner at Woolner’s with Tennyson to-day: _a sei\r\n    occhi_. Last night Manning spent three hours with me; the\r\n    conversation must wait. He is sorely anti-Garibaldian. How\r\n    beautiful is the ending of Newman’s _Apologia_, part VII.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 23._—Singularly happy in my old and early political\r\n    friendships, I am now stripped of every one of them. It has indeed\r\n    been my good lot to acquire friendships in later life, which I\r\n    could not have hoped for; but at this moment I seem to see the\r\n    spirits of the dead gathered thick around me, “all along the\r\n    narrow valley,” the valley of life, over and into which the sun of\r\n    a better, of a yet better life, shines narrowly. I do not think\r\n    our political annals record such a removal of a generation of\r\n    statesmen before its time as we have witnessed in the last four\r\n    years. I could say a great deal about Newcastle. He was a high and\r\n    strong character, very true, very noble, and, I think,\r\n    intelligible, which (as you know) I think rare in politicians. My\r\n    relations with him will be kept up in one sense by having to act,\r\n    and I fear act much, as his executor and trustee, with De Tabley,\r\n    an excellent colleague, who discharged the same duty for the Duke\r\n    of Hamilton and for Canning.\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 28._—I cannot give you a full account of Lord Derby’s\r\n    translation [of the _Iliad_], but there is no doubt in my mind\r\n    that it is a very notable production. He always had in a high\r\n    degree the inborn faculty of a scholar, with this he has an\r\n    enviable power of expression, and an immense command of the\r\n    English tongue; add the quality of dash which appears in his\r\n    version quite as much as in his speeches. Undoubtedly if he\r\n    _wrought_ his execution as Tennyson does, results might have been\r\n    attained beyond the actual ones; but, while I will not venture to\r\n    speak of the precision of the version, various passages in the\r\n    parts I have read are of very high excellence. Try to find out\r\n    what Tennyson thinks of it.\r\n\r\n    _1865_\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 8._—My reading has been little, but even without your\r\n    question I was going to mention that I had caught at the name of\r\n    “_L’Ami Fritz_,” seeing it was by the author of the _Conscrit_,\r\n    and had read it. I can recommend it too, though the subject does\r\n    not at first sight look ravishing: it tells how a middle-aged\r\n    middle-class German bachelor comes to marry the daughter of his\r\n    own farm bailiff. Some parts are full of grace; there is a\r\n    tax-gatherer’s speech on the duty of paying taxes, which came home\r\n    to _my_ heart. Though it a little reminds me of a sermon which I\r\n    heard preached in an aisle of the Duomo of Milan to the boys of a\r\n    Sunday school (said to have been founded by St. Charles Borromeo)\r\n    on the absolute necessity of paying tithes! The golden breadths of\r\n    harvest are now a most lively joy to me. But we have had great\r\n    official troubles in the death of Mr. Arbuthnot, a _pillar_ of the\r\n    treasury, and a really notable man.\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 12._—I am working off my post as well as I can with the\r\n    bands playing and flags fluttering outside. By and by I am going\r\n    to carve rounds of beef for some part of four hundred diners. The\r\n    ladies are only allowed tea. Our _weather_ anxieties are great,\r\n    but all is going well. The new telegram and announcement that you\r\n    will come on Friday is very welcome. Indeed, I did not say\r\n    anything about the marriage, because, without knowing more, I did\r\n    not know what to say, except that I most sincerely wish them all\r\n    good and all happiness. The rest must keep till Friday. The\r\n    characters you describe are quite, I think, on the right ground.\r\n    It was the great glory of the Greeks that they had those full and\r\n    large views of man’s nature, not the narrow and pinched ones which\r\n    are sometimes found even among Christians. Lord Palmerston’s\r\n    abandoning his trip to Bristol is rather a serious affair. There\r\n    is more in it, I fear, than gout.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 24._—If you were well enough, and I had wings, there is\r\n    nothing I should more covet at this moment than to appear at\r\n    Inveraray and compare and correct my impressions of Lord\r\n    Palmerston’s character by yours. Death of itself produces a\r\n    certain tendency to view more warmly what was before admired, and\r\n    more slightly anything that was not. And by stirring the thought\r\n    of the nation through the press it commonly throws lights upon the\r\n    subject either new in themselves or new in their combination.\r\n    _Twelve_ cabinet ministers I have already reckoned in my mind, all\r\n    carried off by the rude hand of death in the last five years,\r\n    during which three only have been made. They are: Lord Dalhousie,\r\n    Lord Aberdeen, Lord Herbert, Sir J. Graham, Lord Canning, Lord\r\n    Elgin, Sir G. Lewis, Lord Campbell, Lord Macaulay, Mr. Ellice,\r\n    Lord Lyndhurst, Lord Palmerston. This, in the political world, and\r\n    to me especially, is an extraordinary desolation.\r\n\r\n    I hope you are at least creeping on. It was so kind of you to\r\n    think about my little neuralgic affairs; thank God, I have had no\r\n    more.\r\n\r\n    _1866_\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, Jan. 4._—We have been pleased with some partial\r\n    accounts of improvement, and I can the better speak my wish to you\r\n    for a happy new year. Next Wednesday I hope to inquire for myself.\r\n    I have been much laden and a good deal disturbed. We have the\r\n    cattle plague in full force here, and it has even touched my small\r\n    group of tenants. To some of them it is a question of life and\r\n    death; and my brother-in-law, who is by nature one of the most\r\n    munificent persons I ever knew, is sorely straitened in mind at\r\n    not being able to do all he would like for his people. But do not\r\n    let this sound like complaint from me. Few have such cause for\r\n    ceaseless and unbounded thankfulness.\r\n\r\n    ...If you come across Armstrong’s poems(137) pray look at them. An\r\n    Irish youth cut off at twenty-four. By the by, Wortley’s children\r\n    have admirable acting powers, which they showed in charades very\r\n    cleverly got up by his wife as stage manager. Grosvenor seconds\r\n    the speech, and F. Cavendish moves the address. We have had divers\r\n    thrushes singing here, a great treat at this season. I like them\r\n    better than hothouse strawberries.\r\n\r\n    _July 7._—I cannot feel unmixedly glad for yourself that you are\r\n    returning to Chiswick. For us it will be a great gain.... Disraeli\r\n    and I were affectionate at the Mansion House last night. Poor\r\n    fellow, he has been much tried about his wife’s health. The King\r\n    of the Belgians pleases me, and strikes me more as to his personal\r\n    qualities on each successive visit. God bless you, my dear duchess\r\n    and precious friend, affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n    _1867_\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, April 29.—We both_ hope to have the pleasure of dining\r\n    at Chiswick on Wednesday. We assume that the hour will be 7.30 as\r\n    usual. I shall be so glad to see Argyll, and to tell him the\r\n    little I can about the literary department of the _Guardian_. I\r\n    write from the “Temple of Peace.” It is a sore wrench to go away.\r\n    But I am thankful to have had such a quiet Easter. The false\r\n    rumour about Paris has had a most beneficial effect, and has\r\n    spared me a multitude of demands. The birds are delightful here.\r\n    What must they be at Cliveden.—Ever affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n    _Holker Hall, Sept. 22._—We find this place very charming. It\r\n    explains at once the secret of the great affection they all have\r\n    for it. It has a singular combination of advantages—sea, hill,\r\n    home ground, and views, access, and the house such an excellent\r\n    living house; all the parts, too, in such good keeping and\r\n    proportion. We much admire your steps. The inhabitants would be\r\n    quite enough to make any place pleasant. We have just been at that\r\n    noble old church of Cartmel. These churches are really the best\r\n    champions of the men who built them.\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 23._—I cannot let the moment pass at which I would have been\r\n    enjoying a visit to you after your severe illness without one word\r\n    of sympathy.... Our prospects are uncertain; but I cling to the\r\n    hope of escaping to the country at the end of next week, unless\r\n    the proposals of the government as to the mode of providing for\r\n    the expense of this unhappy war should prove to be very\r\n    exceptionable, which at present I do not expect. I saw Lord\r\n    Russell last night. He seemed very well but more deaf. Lady\r\n    Russell has had some partial failure of eyesight. Lord R. is\r\n    determined on an educational debate, and has given notice of\r\n    resolutions; all his friends, I think, are disposed to regret it.\r\n    I am told the exchequer is deplorably poor. Poor Disraeli has been\r\n    sorely cut up; and it has not yet appeared that Mrs. Disraeli is\r\n    out of danger, though she is better. Her age seems to be at the\r\n    least seventy-six. I have been to see my china exhibited in its\r\n    new home at Liverpool, where it seemed pretty comfortable.\r\n\r\n    _1868_\r\n\r\n    _31 Bloomsbury Square, Jan. 3._—I promised to write to you in case\r\n    I found matters either bad or good. I lament to say they are bad.\r\n    He [Panizzi] is weaker, more feverish (pulse to-day at 122 about\r\n    noon), and very restless. The best will be a severe struggle and\r\n    the issue is _likely_ to be unfavourable. At the same time he is\r\n    not given over. I said, I shall come to-morrow. He said, You will\r\n    not find me alive. I replied that was wrong. I believe there is no\r\n    danger to-morrow, but what next week may do is another matter. He\r\n    is warm and affectionate as ever, and very tender. He is firm and\r\n    resigned, not stoically, but with trust in God. I am very sad at\r\n    the thought of losing this very true, trusty, hearty friend. I\r\n    must go to-morrow, though of course I should stay if I could be of\r\n    any use.(138)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis year the end came, and a few lines from his diary show the loss it\r\nwas to Mr. Gladstone:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 28._—The post brought a black-bordered letter which\r\n    announced the death of the Dowager Duchess of Sutherland. I have\r\n    lost in her from view the warmest and dearest friend, surely, that\r\n    ever man had. Why this noble and tender spirit should have had\r\n    such bounty for me and should have so freshened my advancing\r\n    years, my absorbed and divided mind, I cannot tell. But I feel,\r\n    strange as it might sound, ten years the older for her death. May\r\n    the rest and light and peace of God be with her ever more until\r\n    _that day_. None will fill her place for me, nor for many worthier\r\n    than I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII. Reform. (1866)\r\n\r\n\r\n    L’aristocratie, la démocratie ne sont pas de vaines doctrines\r\n    livrées a nos disputes; ce sont des puissances, qu’on n’abat\r\n    point, qu’on n’élève point par la louange ou par l’injure; avant\r\n    que nous parlions d’elles, elles sont ou ne sont\r\n    pas.—ROYER-COLLARD.\r\n\r\n    Aristocracy, democracy, are not vain doctrines for us to dispute\r\n    about; they are powers; you neither exalt them nor depress them by\r\n    praise or by blame; before we talk of them, they exist or they do\r\n    not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Denison, the Speaker, had a conversation with Mr. Gladstone almost\r\nimmediately after the death of Lord Palmerston, and he reported the drift\r\nof it to Sir George Grey. The Speaker had been in Scotland, and found no\r\nstrong feeling for reform or any other extensive change, while there was a\r\ngeneral decline of interest in the ballot:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gladstone said, “Certainly, as far as my constituents go, there is\r\n    no strong feeling for reform among them. And as to the ballot, I\r\n    think it is declining in favour.” He spoke of the difficulties\r\n    before us, of the embarrassment of the reform question. “With a\r\n    majority of 80 on the liberal side, they will expect some action.”\r\n    I answered, “No doubt a majority of 80, agreed on any point, would\r\n    expect action. At the time of the first Reform bill, when the\r\n    whole party was for the bill, the course was clear. But is the\r\n    party agreed now? The point it was agreed upon was to support Lord\r\n    Palmerston’s government. But was that in order to pass a strong\r\n    measure of reform? Suppose that the country is satisfied with the\r\n    foreign policy, and the home policy, and the financial policy, and\r\n    wants to maintain these and their authors, and does not want great\r\n    changes of any kind?” I was, on the whole, pleased with the tone\r\n    of Gladstone’s conversation. It was calm, and for soothing\r\n    difficulties, not for making them.... I should add that Gladstone\r\n    spoke with great kindness about yourself, and about your\r\n    management of the House of Commons, and said that it would be his\r\n    wish that you should lead it.(139)\r\n\r\n\r\n(M55) The antecedents of the memorable crisis of 1866-7 were curious.\r\nReform bills had been considered by five governments since 1849, and\r\nmentioned in six speeches from the throne. Each political party had\r\nbrought a plan forward, and Lord John Russell had brought forward three.\r\nMr. Bright also reduced his policy to the clauses of a bill in 1858. In\r\n1859 Lord Derby’s government had introduced a measure which old whigs and\r\nnew radicals, uniting their forces, had successfully resisted. This move\r\nMr. Gladstone—who, as the reader will recollect, had on that occasion\r\nvoted with the tories(140)—always took to impose a decisive obligation on\r\nall who withstood the tory attempt at a settlement, to come forward with\r\nproposals of their own. On the other hand, in the new parliament, the tory\r\nparty was known to be utterly opposed to an extension of the franchise,\r\nand a considerable fringe of professing liberals also existed who were\r\nquite as hostile, though not quite as willing to avow hostility before\r\ntheir constituents. All the leaders were committed, and yet of their\r\nadherents the majority was dubious or adverse. The necessity of passing a\r\nReform bill through an anti-reform parliament thus produced a situation of\r\nunsurpassed perplexity. Some thought that formidable susceptibilities\r\nwould be soothed, if the government were reconstructed and places found\r\nfor new men. Others declared that the right course would be first to weld\r\nthe party together by bills on which everybody was agreed; to read a good\r\nReform bill a first time; then in the recess the country would let\r\nministers see where they were, and the next session would find them on\r\nfirm ground. But Lord Russell knew that he had little time to spare—he was\r\nnow close upon seventy-four—and Mr. Gladstone was the last man to try to\r\nhold him back.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the new government began with a familiar demonstration\r\nof the miserable failure of English statesmen to govern Ireland, in the\r\nshape of the twentieth coercion bill, since the union. This need not\r\ndetain us, nor need the budget, the eighth of the series that made this\r\nadministration so memorable in the history of national finance. It was\r\nnaturally quite enough for parliament that the accounts showed a surplus\r\nof £1,350,000; that the last tax on raw material vanished with the repeal\r\nof the duty on timber; that a series of commercial treaties had been\r\nsuccessfully negotiated; and that homage should be paid to virtue by the\r\nnibbling of a mouse at the mountain of the national debt. The debt was\r\neight hundred millions, and it was now proposed to apply half-a-million a\r\nyear towards its annihilation. Reform, however, was the fighting question,\r\nand fighting questions absorb a legislature.\r\n\r\n(M56) The chancellor of the exchequer introduced the Reform bill (March\r\n12) in a speech that, though striking enough, was less impassioned than\r\nsome of his later performances in the course of this famous contest. He\r\ndid not forget that “the limbo of abortive creations was peopled with the\r\nskeletons of reform bills”; and it was his cue in a House so constituted\r\nas the one before him, to use the language and arguments of moderation and\r\nsafety. Franchise was the real question at stake, and to that branch of\r\nreform the bill was limited. The other question of redistributing seats he\r\nlikened to fighting in a wood, where there may be any number of partial\r\nencounters, but hardly a great and deciding issue. The only point on which\r\nthere was a vital difference was the figure of the borough franchise. In\r\n1859 Mr. Disraeli invented a quackish phrase about lateral extension and\r\nvertical extension, and offered votes to various classes who mainly had\r\nthem already, without extending downwards; but whatever else his plan\r\nmight do, it opened no door for the workmen. In 1860 the Palmerston\r\ngovernment proposed a six pound occupation franchise for boroughs, and ten\r\npounds for counties. The proposal of 1866 was seven pounds for boroughs,\r\nand fourteen for counties. We may smile at the thought that some of the\r\nmost brilliant debates ever heard in the House of Commons now turned upon\r\nthe mighty puzzle whether the qualification for a borough voter should be\r\noccupancy of a ten, a seven, or a six pound house;—nay, whether the ruin\r\nor salvation of the state might not lie on the razor-edge of distinction\r\nbetween rating and rental. Ministers were taunted with having brought in\r\nMr. Bright’s bill. Mr. Bright replied that he could not find in it a\r\nsingle point that he had recommended. He was never in favour of a six\r\npound franchise; he believed in a household franchise; but if a seven\r\npound franchise was offered, beggars could not be choosers, and seven\r\npounds he would take. In a fragmentary note of later years Mr. Gladstone,\r\namong other things, describes one glittering protagonist of the hour:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lord Russell adhered with great tenacity to his ideas, in which he\r\n    was strongly supported by me as his leader in the Commons, and by\r\n    Granville and others of the cabinet. Bright, the representative\r\n    man of popular ideas, behaved with an admirable combination of\r\n    discretion and loyalty. Lowe was an outspoken opponent, so\r\n    superstitiously enamoured of the ten pound franchise as to be\r\n    thrown into a temper of general hostility to a government which\r\n    did not recognise its finality and sanctity. He pursued our modest\r\n    Reform bill of 1866 with an implacable hostility, and really\r\n    supplied the whole brains of the opposition. So effective were his\r\n    speeches that, during this year, and this year only, he had such a\r\n    command of the House as had never in my recollection been\r\n    surpassed. Nor was there any warrant for imputing to him\r\n    dishonesty of purpose or _arrière-pensée_. But his position was\r\n    one, for the moment, of personal supremacy, and this to such an\r\n    extent that, when all had been reconciled and the time for his\r\n    peerage came, I pressed his viscountcy on the sovereign as a\r\n    tribute to his former elevation, which, though short-lived, was\r\n    due to genuine power of mind, as it seemed to me that a man who\r\n    had once soared to those heights trodden by so few, ought not to\r\n    be lost in the common ruck of official barons.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first trial of strength arose upon a device of one of the greatest of\r\nthe territorial whigs, seconded by a much more eminent man in the ranks of\r\nterritorial tories. Lord Grosvenor announced a motion that they would not\r\nproceed with the franchise, until they were in possession of the\r\nministerial intentions upon seats. Lord Stanley, the son of the tory\r\nleader, seconded the motion. Any other form would have served equally well\r\nas a test of conflicting forces. The outlook was clouded. Mr. Brand, the\r\nskilful whip, informed the cabinet, that there were three classes of\r\ndisaffected liberals, who might possibly be kept in order; first, those\r\nwho, although opposed to reform, were averse to a change of government;\r\nnext, those who doubted whether ministers really intended to deal with the\r\nseats at all; and finally, those who felt sure that when they came to deal\r\nwith seats, they would be under the baleful influence of Bright. The first\r\nof the three sections could best be kept right by means of a stiff line\r\nagainst Grosvenor and Stanley, and the other two sections by the simple\r\nproduction of the seats bill before taking the committee on franchise. The\r\nexpert’s counsels were followed. Mr. Gladstone told the House that Lord\r\nGrosvenor’s motion would be treated as a vote of want of confidence, but\r\nthat he would disclose the whole plan as soon as the franchise bill had\r\npassed its second reading. The mutterings only grew louder. At a great\r\nmeeting in Liverpool (April 6), accompanied by some of his colleagues Mr.\r\nGladstone roused the enthusiasm of his audience to the utmost pitch by\r\ndeclaring that the government would not flinch, that they had passed the\r\nRubicon, broken the bridges, burned their boats. Still the malcontents\r\nwere not cowed.\r\n\r\n(M57) The leader himself rose in warmth of advocacy as the struggle went\r\non. The advocates of privilege used language about the workers, that in\r\nhis generous and sympathetic mind fanned the spark into a flame. Lowe\r\nasked an unhappy question, that long stood out as a beacon mark in the\r\ncontroversy—whether “if you wanted venality, ignorance, drunkenness—if you\r\nwanted impulsive, unreflecting, violent people—where do you look for them?\r\nDo you go to the top or to the bottom?” Harsh judgments like this of the\r\nconditions of life and feeling in the mass of the nation—though Lowe was\r\npersonally one of the kindest of men—made Mr. Gladstone stand all the more\r\nardently by the objects of such sweeping reproach. In a discussion upon\r\nelectoral statistics, he let fall a phrase that reverberated through the\r\ndiscussion inside parliament and out. Some gentlemen, he said, deal with\r\nthese statistics, as if they were ascertaining the numbers of an invading\r\narmy. “But the persons to whom their remarks apply are our\r\nfellow-subjects, our fellow-Christians, _our own flesh and blood_, who\r\nhave been lauded to the skies for their good conduct.”(141) This was\r\ninstantly denounced by Lord Cranborne(142) as sentimental rant, and\r\ninquiries soon followed why kinship in flesh and blood should be strictly\r\nlimited by a seven pound rental. Speedily Mr. Gladstone passed from steady\r\npractical argument in the ministerial key, to all the topics of popular\r\nenthusiasm and parliamentary invective. His impulsiveness, said critical\r\nobservers, “betrays him at times into exaggeration or incaution; but there\r\nis a generous quality in it.” Mr. Bright once talked of his own agitation\r\nfor reform as no better than flogging a dead horse. The parliamentary\r\nstruggle, led by Mr. Gladstone, brought the dead horse to life, stirred\r\nthe combative instincts, and roused all the forces of reform. Lowe was\r\nglittering, energetic, direct, and swift. Mr. Disraeli, contented to watch\r\nhis adversaries draw their swords on one another, did not put forth all\r\nhis power. In a moment of unwisdom he taunted Mr. Gladstone with his\r\nstripling’s speech at the Oxford Union five-and-thirty years before. As\r\nAberdeen once said, “Gladstone is terrible on the rebound,”(143) and\r\nanybody less imperturbable than Disraeli would have found his retort\r\nterrible here. His speech on the second reading (April 27), as a whole,\r\nranks among the greatest of his performances. “Spoke,” he says, “from one\r\nto past three, following Disraeli. It was a toil much beyond my strength,\r\nbut I seemed to be sustained and borne onwards I knew not how.” The party\r\ndanger, the political theme, the new responsibility of command, the joy of\r\nbattle, all seemed to transfigure the orator before the vision of the\r\nHouse, as if he were the Greek hero sent forth to combat by Pallas Athene,\r\nwith, flame streaming from head and shoulders, from helmet and shield,\r\nlike the star of summer rising effulgent from the sea. One personal\r\npassage deserves a biographic place:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    My position, Sir, in regard to the liberal party, is in all points\r\n    the opposite of Earl Russell’s.... I have none of the claims he\r\n    possesses. I came among you an outcast from those with whom I\r\n    associated, driven from them, I admit, by no arbitrary act, but by\r\n    the slow and resistless forces of conviction. I came among you, to\r\n    make use of the legal phraseology, _in formâ pauperis_. I had\r\n    nothing to offer you but faithful and honourable service. You\r\n    received me, as Dido received the shipwrecked Æneas—\r\n\r\n    “... Ejectum littore, egentem\r\n    Excepi,”\r\n\r\n    and I only trust you may not hereafter at any time have to\r\n    complete the sentence in regard to me—\r\n\r\n    “Et regui demens in parte locavi.”(144)\r\n\r\n    You received me with kindness, indulgence, generosity, and I may\r\n    even say with some measure of confidence. And the relation between\r\n    us has assumed such a form that you can never be my debtors, but\r\n    that I must for ever be in your debt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe closing sentences became memorable: “You cannot fight against the\r\nfuture,” he exclaimed with a thrilling gesture, “time is on our side. The\r\ngreat social forces which move onwards in their might and majesty, and\r\nwhich the tumult of our debates does not for a moment impede or\r\ndisturb—those great social forces are against you; they are marshalled on\r\nour side; and the banner which we now carry in this fight, though perhaps\r\nat some moment it may droop over our sinking heads, yet it soon again will\r\nfloat in the eye of Heaven, and it will be borne by the firm hands of the\r\nunited people of the three kingdoms, perhaps not to an easy, but to a\r\ncertain and to a not far distant victory.”\r\n\r\n(M58) A drama, as good critics tell us, is made not by words but by\r\nsituations. The same is the truth of the power of the orator. Here the\r\nspeaker’s trope was a sounding battle-cry, not a phrase; it disclosed both\r\na cause and a man. For the hour neither man nor cause prospered. Neither\r\nfervour nor force of argument prevailed against the fears and resentments\r\nof the men of what Mr. Bright called the Cave of Adullam, “to which every\r\none was invited who was distressed, and every one who was discontented.”\r\nAfter eight nights of debate (April 27) Lord Grosvenor was beaten, and\r\nministers were saved—but only by the desperate figure of five. Some thirty\r\nof the professed supporters of government voted against their leaders. A\r\nscene of delirious triumph followed the announcement of the numbers, and\r\nMr. Lowe believed for the moment that he had really slain the horrid\r\nDemogorgon. Two men knew much better—the leader of the House and the\r\nleader of the opposition.\r\n\r\nThe cabinet, which was not without an imitation cave of its own, hesitated\r\nfor an hour or two, but the two chief men in it stood firm. Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas as resolute as Lord Russell, that this time nobody should say reform\r\nwas only being played with, and they both insisted on going on with the\r\nbill. The chances were bad, for this was a Palmerstonian parliament, and\r\nthe Gladstonian hour had not yet struck. As an honourable leader among the\r\nconservatives admitted, not one of the divisions against the bill was\r\ntaken in good faith. If Mr. Gladstone gave way, he was taunted with\r\ncringing; if he stood his ground, it was called bullying; if he expressed\r\na desire to consult the views of the House, Mr. Disraeli held up ministers\r\nto scorn as unhappy men without minds of their own. In introducing the\r\nbill, says Mr. Gladstone, “I struggled with studious care to avoid every\r\nword that could give offence.” The only effect of this was to spread the\r\ntale that he was not in earnest, and did not really care for the bill.\r\nSuch was the temper in which ministers were met. And the whole operation\r\nwas conducted upon the basis of a solemn, firm, and formal understanding\r\nbetween the regular opposition and the cave men, that were it proposed to\r\nreduce the ten pound qualification no lower than nine pounds nineteen\r\nshillings and sixpence, even that change should be resisted.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, for the leader of the House vexation followed vexation. “The\r\nworst incident in the history of our reform struggle,” Mr. Gladstone wrote\r\nto the prime minister from the House, on May 28, “has occurred to-night. A\r\nmost barefaced proposal further to load the bill by an instruction to\r\ninsert clauses respecting bribery has been carried against us by a\r\nmajority of 10; the numbers were 248 to 238. This is extremely\r\ndiscouraging, and it much reduces the usual strength and authority of the\r\ngovernment. This defeat alters our position with reference to fresh\r\ndefeats.” The air was thick with ideas and schemes for getting rid of the\r\nbill and yet keeping the ministers. “I cannot,” Mr. Gladstone says to Lord\r\nRussell (June 4), “divest such ideas and proposals of the aspect of\r\ndishonour.” They were told, he said, to introduce an amended plan next\r\nyear. How would the case be altered? They would have to introduce a plan\r\nsubstantially identical, to meet the same invidious opposition, made all\r\nthe more confident by the success of its present manœuvres.\r\n\r\nAt length an end came. On June 18, on a question raised by Lord Dunkellin,\r\nof rateable value as against gross estimated rental for the basis of the\r\nnew seven-pound franchise, ministers were beaten. The numbers were 315\r\nagainst 304, and in this majority of 11 against government were found no\r\nfewer than 44 of their professed supporters. The sensation was almost\r\nbeyond precedent. “With the cheering of the adversary there was shouting,\r\nviolent flourishing of hats, and other manifestations which I think novel\r\nand inappropriate,” Mr. Gladstone says. The next morning, in a note to a\r\nfriend, he observed: “The government has now just overlived its seven\r\nyears: a larger term than the life of any government of this country since\r\nthat of Lord Liverpool. Many circumstances show that it was time things\r\nshould come to a crisis—none so much as the insidious proceedings, and the\r\ninconstant and variable voting on this bill.”\r\n\r\n(M59) It had been decided in the cabinet a couple of days before this\r\ndefeat, that an adverse vote on the narrow issue technically raised by\r\nLord Dunkellin was not in itself to be treated in debate as a vital\r\nquestion, for the rating value could easily have been adjusted to the\r\nfigure of rental proposed by the government. The debate, however, instead\r\nof being confined to a narrow question raised technically, covered the\r\nwhole range of the bill. Taken together with the previous attempts to get\r\nrid of the thing, and the increasing number of the disaffected, all this\r\nseemed to extinguish hope, and after what had been said about crossing\r\nRubicons and burning boats, most thought no course open but resignation.\r\nThey might appeal to the country. But Mr. Brand, the expert whip, told the\r\nprime minister that he felt so strongly on the impolicy of dissolution\r\nthat he could not bring himself to take a part in it. The proceeding would\r\nbe unpopular with their own friends, who had been put to great expense at\r\ntheir election only a few months before. It would, moreover, break the\r\nparty, because at an election they would have to bring out men of more\r\nextreme views to fight the whigs and liberals who had deserted them on\r\nreform, and who might thus be driven permanently to the other side. Such\r\nwere the arguments, though Mr. Gladstone seems not to have thought them\r\ndecisive. At hardly any crisis in his life, I think, did Mr. Gladstone\r\never incline to surrender, short of absolute compulsion. To yield was not\r\nhis temper. When he looked back upon this particular transaction in later\r\nyears, he blamed himself and his colleagues for too promptly acquiescing\r\nin advice to throw down the reins.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I incline to believe that we too readily accepted our defeat by an\r\n    infinitesimal majority, as a ground for resignation. There were at\r\n    least four courses open to us: first, resignation; secondly,\r\n    dissolution; thirdly, to deny the finality of the judgment and\r\n    reverse the hostile vote on report; fourthly, to take shelter\r\n    under a general vote of confidence which Mr. Crawford, M.P. for\r\n    the City of London, was prepared to move. Of these, the last was\r\n    the worst, as disparaging to political character. Lord Russell,\r\n    secretly conscious, I suppose, that he had arrived at the last\r\n    stage of his political existence, and desirous that it should not\r\n    be forcibly abbreviated, inclined to adopt it. Granville and I\r\n    were so decidedly set against it that we allowed ourselves, I\r\n    think, to be absorbed in its defeat, and set up against it what\r\n    was undoubtedly the readiest and simplest expedient, namely,\r\n    immediate withdrawal. To dissolve would have been a daring act, an\r\n    appeal from a shuffling parliament to an unawakened people. Yet it\r\n    is possible, even probable, that such an appeal, unhesitatingly\r\n    made, would have evoked a response similar, though not equal, to\r\n    that of 1831. Or again, a re-trial of the question, with a call of\r\n    the House, would in all likelihood have resulted in victory. By\r\n    our retirement we opened the door for that series of curious\r\n    deceptions and intrigues within the tory party, which undoubtedly\r\n    accelerated the arrival of household suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M60) Lord Russell tendered their resignation to the Queen, then far away\r\nat Balmoral. The Queen received the communication with the greatest\r\nconcern, and asked them to reconsider. “The state of Europe,” she said,\r\n“was dangerous; the country was apathetic about reform; the defeat had\r\nonly touched a matter of detail; the question was one that could never be\r\nsettled unless all sides were prepared to make concessions.” In London\r\nthree or four days were passed in discussing the hundred ingenious\r\nfutilities by which well-meaning busy-bodies on all such occasions\r\nstruggle to dissolve hard facts by soft words. In compliance with the\r\nQueen’s request, the cabinet reopened their own discussion, and for a day\r\nor two entertained the plan of going on, if the House would pass a general\r\nvote of confidence. Mr. Gladstone, as we have seen, was on the morrow of\r\nthe defeat for resignation, and from the first he thought ill of the new\r\nplan. The true alternatives were to try either a fresh parliament or a\r\nfresh ministry. Bright—not then a member of the government—wrote to Mr.\r\nGladstone (June 24) in strong terms in favour of having a new parliament.\r\nMr. Brand, he says, “makes no allowance for the force of a moral contest\r\nthrough the country for a great principle and a great cause. Last Easter\r\nshowed how much feeling your appeals could speedily arouse.... I do not\r\nbelieve in your being beaten. Besides there is something far worse than a\r\ndefeat, namely to carry on your government with a party poisoned and\r\nenfeebled by the baseness of the forty traitors [elsewhere in the same\r\nletter called the ‘forty thieves’]. In great contingencies something must\r\nbe risked. You will have a great party well compacted together, and great\r\nfuture. Mr. Brand’s figures should be forgotten for the moment.... You\r\nmust not forget the concluding passage of your great speech on the second\r\nreading of the bill. Read it again to nerve you to your great duty.” The\r\nDuke of Argyll was strong in the same sense. He saw no chance of\r\n“conducting opposition with decent sincerity or possible success, except\r\nin a parliament in which we know who are our friends and who are our\r\nenemies on this question.” In the end resignation carried the day:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _June 25._—Cabinet 2-½-4-½ .... The final position appeared to be\r\n    this, as to alternatives before the cabinet. 1. Dissolution, only\r\n    approved by three or four. 2. A vote of confidence with vague\r\n    assurances as to future reform—desired by seven, one more\r\n    acquiescing reluctantly, six opposing. _W. E. G. unable to act on\r\n    it._ 3. Lord Russell’s proposal to rehabilitate the\r\n    clause—disapproved by seven, approved by six, two ready to\r\n    acquiesce. 4. Resignation generally accepted, hardly any strongly\r\n    dissenting. I have had a great weight on me in these last days,\r\n    and am glad the matter draws near its close.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis decision greeted the Queen on her arrival at Windsor on the morning\r\nof June 26. Both the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer\r\nhad audiences the same day. “Off at 11.30 to Windsor with Lord Russell,\r\nmuch conversation with him. Single and joint audiences with the Queen, who\r\nshowed every quality required by her station and the time. We had warm\r\nreceptions at both stations.” Mr. Gladstone’s memorandum of the interview\r\nis as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Windsor Castle, June 26._—H.M. expressed her regret that this\r\n    crisis could not be averted; stated she had wished that this\r\n    question could have been postponed altogether to another year; or\r\n    that upon finding the strength and tenacity of the opposition to\r\n    the measure, it could have been withdrawn. I reminded H.M. that\r\n    she had early expressed to me her hope that if we resumed the\r\n    subject of the reform of parliament, we should prosecute it to its\r\n    completion. Also, I said that in my opinion, from all the\r\n    miscarriages attending the past history of this question, not\r\n    ministries alone, and leaders of parties, nor parties alone, but\r\n    parliament itself and parliamentary government were discredited.\r\n    The Queen was impressed with this, and said there was certainly\r\n    great force in it. She had previously seen Lord Russell, and spoke\r\n    of his proposal further to amend the clause. Such a proposal she\r\n    considered advisable, subject to two conditions: (1.) The general\r\n    assent and concurrence of the cabinet; (2.) The reasonable chance\r\n    of its being carried. If the proposal were made she was quite\r\n    willing it should be said, with the approval of the cabinet, that\r\n    she had observed that the issue taken was on a point apparently\r\n    one of detail, and that it was just to the H. of C. that it should\r\n    have an opportunity of voting upon the substance. Lord Russell\r\n    wished in any case to state, and H.M. approved, that the Queen had\r\n    founded her hesitation to accept the resignation (1.) on the fact\r\n    that the decision was on a matter of detail; (2.) on the state of\r\n    the continent(145) (and the difficulty of bringing a new ministry\r\n    in such a state of things at once into the position of the old).\r\n    The Queen offered to write what she had said about Lord Russell’s\r\n    proposed amendment. Lord Russell waived this. But thinking it\r\n    desirable, I afterwards revived the question, and H.M. said she\r\n    thought it would be better, and went to do it.\r\n\r\n    I said to Lord Russell, “It is singular that the same members of\r\n    the cabinet (generally speaking) who were prematurely eager for\r\n    resignation after the division on Lord Grosvenor’s motion, are now\r\n    again eager to accept almost anything in the way of a resolution\r\n    as sufficient to warrant our continuing in office.” He replied,\r\n    “Yes, but I am afraid at the root of both proceedings there is a\r\n    great amount of antipathy to our Reform bill. They were anxious to\r\n    resign when resignation would have been injurious to it, and now\r\n    they are anxious to avoid resignation because resignation will be\r\n    beneficial to it.” Lord Russell showed me a letter he had written\r\n    to Clarendon justifying me for my unwillingness to accept Mr.\r\n    Crawford’s motion of confidence. He also said that if the Queen\r\n    should desire the revival of his plan for a further vote, he\r\n    thought it ought to be proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n“On returning,” Mr. Gladstone enters in the diary, “we went to consult\r\nBrand and then to the cabinet, when resignation was finally decided on,\r\nand a telegram was sent to Windsor. At six I went down and made my\r\nexplanation for the government. I kept to facts without epithets, but I\r\nthought as I went on that some of the words were scorching. A crowd and\r\ngreat enthusiasm in Palace Yard on departure.” Lord Derby was sent for,\r\naccepted the royal commission, and finding Mr. Lowe and the Adullamites\r\nnot available, he formed his third administration on regular conservative\r\nlines, with Mr. Disraeli as its foremost man.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 6._—Went to Windsor to take my leave. H.M. short but kind.\r\n    H. of C. on return, took my place on the opposition bench, the\r\n    first time for fifteen years.(146) ... Finished in Downing Street.\r\n    Left my keys behind me. Somehow it makes a void. _July 19._—H. of\r\n    C. Made a little dying speech on reform. _Sept. 14_—. Woburn.\r\n    Morning _sederunt_ with Lord Russell and Brand on reform and other\r\n    matters. We agreed neither to egg on the government nor the\r\n    reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M61) Turbulent scenes had already occurred in the metropolis, and it\r\nspeedily became evident that whatever value the workmen might set on the\r\nfranchise for its own sake, they would not brook the refusal of it. They\r\nchose Mr. Gladstone for their hero, for, as a good observer remarked, he\r\nwas the first official statesman who had convinced the working classes\r\nthat he really cared for them. On the occasion of one popular assemblage\r\nthe crowd thronged (June 28) to Carlton House Terrace, shouting for\r\nGladstone and liberty. The head of the house was away. Police officers\r\nsent up word to Mrs. Gladstone that the multitude would speedily disperse\r\nif she would appear for a moment or two on the balcony. In compliance with\r\ntheir request and for the public convenience, she appeared, and all passed\r\noff. The incident was described by newspapers that ought to have known\r\nbetter, as the ladies of his family courting an ovation from persons of\r\nthe lowest class. Mr. Gladstone was compared to Wilkes and Lord George\r\nGordon. With characteristic tenacity he thought it worth while to\r\ncontradict the story, but not in the columns where the offensive tale had\r\nbeen invented. In July, declining an invitation to speak at a\r\ndemonstration in Hyde Park Mr. Gladstone said he believed the resignation\r\nof the government to be a fresh and important step towards final success.\r\n“In the hour of defeat I have the presentiment of victory.”\r\n\r\nAn interesting glimpse of Mr. Gladstone in the height of these\r\ndistractions is given in a passage from the diaries of Mr. Adams, still\r\nthe American minister:—(147)\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, 7th June 1866._—The other evening at the Queen’s ball\r\n    Mrs. Gladstone asked me as from her husband, to come to breakfast\r\n    this morning, at the same time that Colonel Holmes,(148) was\r\n    invited.... I decided to go. I found no cause to regret the\r\n    decision, for the company was very pleasant. The Duke and Duchess\r\n    of Argyll, Lord Lyttelton, Lord Houghton, Lord Frederick Cavendish\r\n    with his wife, and one of his uncles, and several whom I did not\r\n    know. I forgot Lord Dufferin. We sat at two round tables, thus\r\n    dividing the company; but Mr. Gladstone took ours, which made all\r\n    the difference in the world. His characteristic is the most\r\n    extraordinary facility of conversation on almost any topic, with a\r\n    great command of literary resources, which at once gives it a high\r\n    tone. Lord Houghton, if put to it, is not without aptness in\r\n    keeping it up; whilst the Duke of Argyll was stimulated out of his\r\n    customary indifference to take his share. Thus we passed from\r\n    politics, the House of Commons, and Mr. Mill, to English prose as\r\n    illustrated from the time of Milton and Bacon down to this day,\r\n    and contrasted with German, which has little of good, and with\r\n    French. In the latter connection Mr. Gladstone asked me if I had\r\n    read the _Conscrit_ of Erckmann-Chatrian. Luckily for me, who have\r\n    little acquaintance with the light current literature, I could say\r\n    “Yes,” and could contrast it favourably with the artificial manner\r\n    of Hugo. It is a cause of wonder to me how a man like Gladstone,\r\n    so deeply plunged in the current of politics, and in the duties of\r\n    legislation and official labour, can find time to keep along with\r\n    the ephemeral literature abroad as well as at home. After an hour\r\n    thus spent we rose, and on a question proposed by Colonel Holmes\r\n    respecting a group of figures in china which stood in a corner,\r\n    Mr. Gladstone launched forth into a disquisition on that topic,\r\n    which he delights in, and illustrated his idea of the art by\r\n    showing us several specimens of different kinds. One a grotesque\r\n    but speaking figure in Capo di Monte, another a group of\r\n    combatants, two of whom were lying dead with all the aspect of\r\n    strained muscle stiffening; and lastly, a very classical and\r\n    elegant set of Wedgwood ware, certainly finer than I ever saw\r\n    before. This is the pleasantest and most profitable form of\r\n    English society.\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the session (July 21) Mr. Gladstone presided over the\r\nannual dinner of the club founded in honour of Cobden, who had died the\r\nyear before. As might have been foretold, he emphasised the moral rather\r\nthan the practical results of Cobden’s work. “Public economy was with\r\nCobden,” he said, “nothing less than a moral principle. The temper and\r\nspirit of Mr. Cobden in respect to questions of public economy was a\r\ntemper and a spirit that ought to be maintained, encouraged, and\r\npropagated in this country—a temper and spirit far more in vogue, far more\r\nhonoured and esteemed and cultivated by both political parties twenty or\r\nthirty years ago than it is at the present moment.” An intense love of\r\njustice, a singleness of aim, a habit of judging men fairly and estimating\r\nthem favourably, an absence of the suspicion that so often forms the bane\r\nof public life—these elements and all other such elements were to be found\r\nin the character of Cobden abundantly supplied. Mr. Cobden’s was a mind\r\nincapable of entertaining the discussion of a question without fully\r\nweighing and estimating its moral aspects and results. In these words so\r\njustly applied to Cobden, the orator was doubtless depicting political\r\nideals of his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn Mr. Gladstone determined on going abroad with his wife and\r\ndaughters. “One among my reasons for going,” he told Mr. Brand, “is that I\r\nthink I am better out of the way of politics during the recess. In England\r\nI should find it most difficult to avoid for five minutes attending some\r\npublic celebration or other, especially in Lancashire. I think that I have\r\nsaid already in one way or other, all that I can usefully say, perhaps\r\nmore than all. So far as I am concerned, I now leave the wound of the\r\nliberal party to the healing powers of nature.... If we cannot arrive in\r\nsufficient strength at a definite understanding with respect to the mode\r\nof handling the question of the franchise, then our line ought to be great\r\npatience and quietude in opposition. If we can, then certainly the\r\nexisting government might at any time disappear, after the opening of the\r\nsession I mean, with advantage.” “The journey to Italy,” says Phillimore,\r\n“was really a measure of self-defence, to escape the incessant persecution\r\nof correspondence, suggestions, and solicitations.”\r\n\r\n(M62) They left England in the last week of September, and proceeded\r\ndirect to Rome. The Queen had given as one good reason against a change of\r\nministers the dangerous outlook on the continent of Europe. This was the\r\nyear of the Seven Weeks’ War, the battle of Sadowa (July 3), and the\r\ntriumph of Prussia over Austria, foreshadowing a more astonishing triumph\r\nfour years hence. One of the results of Sadowa was the further\r\nconsolidation of the Italian kingdom by the transfer of Venetia. Rome\r\nstill remained outside. The political situation was notoriously\r\nprovisional and unstable, and the French troops who had gone there in 1849\r\nwere still in their barracks at the Castle of St. Angelo. But this was no\r\nimmediate concern of his. “Nothing can be more unlikely,” he wrote to\r\nActon (Sept. 11), “than that I should meddle with the prisons, or anything\r\nelse of the kind. The case of Rome in 1866 is very different from that of\r\nNaples in 1850, when the whole royal government was nothing but one gross\r\nand flagrant illegality. I have seen Archbishop Manning repeatedly,” he\r\ncontinues, “and my impression is that he speaks to me after having sought\r\nand received his cue from Rome. He is to put me in communication with\r\nCardinal Antonelli and others. I consider myself bound to good conduct in\r\na very strict sense of the word.” We now know that the archbishop took\r\npains to warn his friends at Rome to show their visitor all the kindness\r\npossible. “Gladstone,” he wrote, “does not come as an enemy, and may be\r\nmade friendly, or he might become on his return most dangerous.” The\r\nliberals would be very jealous of him on the subject of the temporal power\r\nof the pope. Meanwhile Gladstone fully held that the Holy Father must be\r\nindependent. “Towards us in England,” said Manning, “and towards Ireland\r\nhe is the most just and forgiving of all our public men. He is very\r\nsusceptible of any kindness, and his sympathies and respect religiously\r\nare all with us.”(149)\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To the Duchess of Sutherland._\r\n\r\n    _Rome, Oct. 13._—We had for five days together last week, I will\r\n    not say a surfeit or a glut, for these imply excess and satiety,\r\n    but a continuous feast of fine scenery; all the way from\r\n    Pontarlier by Neuchâtel to Lucerne, and then by the St. Gothard to\r\n    Como. Since then we have had only the passage of the Apennines by\r\n    the railway from Ancona to Rome. This is much finer than the old\r\n    road, according to my recollection. It has three grand stages, one\r\n    of them rising from the north and east, the others through close\r\n    defiles from Foligno to Terni, and from Spoleto to Narni, where we\r\n    went close by the old bridge. As to the St. Gothard I think it the\r\n    finest in scenery of all the Alpine passes I have seen, and I have\r\n    seen all those commonly traversed from the Stelvio downwards (in\r\n    height) to the Brenner, except the Bernardina. A part of the\r\n    ascent on the Italian side may perhaps compete with the Via Mala\r\n    which it somewhat resembles. We were also intensely delighted with\r\n    the Lake of Lugano, which I had never seen before, and which\r\n    appeared to me the most beautiful of the Italian lakes.\r\n\r\n    Here we find Rome solitary, which we wished, but also wet and\r\n    dirty, which we did not. We hope it will soon be clear and dry. No\r\n    scenery and no city can stand the stripping off its robe of\r\n    atmosphere. And Rome, which is not _very_ rich in its natural\r\n    features, suffers in a high degree. We caught sight of the pope\r\n    yesterday on the steps of St. Peter’s, made our obeisance, and\r\n    received that recognition with the hand which is very appropriate,\r\n    and I imagine to him not at all troublesome. Next week I hope to\r\n    see Cardinal Antonelli. We have been to-day to St. Paul’s. Its\r\n    space is amazing, and at particular points it seems to vie with or\r\n    exceed St. Peter’s. But there can be no real comparison in\r\n    magnificence, and St. Peter’s is the more churchlike of the two.\r\n    The exterior of St. Paul’s [beyond the walls] is very mean indeed,\r\n    and is in glaring contrast with the gorgeousness within.\r\n\r\n    _Rome, Oct. 30._—... I observe reserve in conversation, except\r\n    with such persons as cardinals. To two of them who wished me to\r\n    speak freely I have spoken without any restraint about the great\r\n    question immediately pending here. And next to them my most free\r\n    and open conversation has been with the pope, but of course I did\r\n    not go further than he led me, and on the affairs of Italy this\r\n    was nearly all the way. I have seen him twice, once in an audience\r\n    _quattr’ occhi_, and once with my wife and daughters, Lady A.\r\n    Stanley accompanying us. Nothing can be more pleasant than the\r\n    impression made by his demeanour and language. He looks well and\r\n    strong, but seems to have a slight touch of deafness.(150) You ask\r\n    about our “apartment,” and I send you (partly to inform the\r\n    Argylls, in the hope that they might take one of the floors) first\r\n    a sketch of our general position, nearly opposite the Europa, and\r\n    secondly a rude plan of the rooms. Half a bedroom unfortunately is\r\n    cut off from bad management, and the Frattina rooms are much too\r\n    small. Besides three rooms which we occupy there is another which\r\n    we do not. We are boarded too, which saves much trouble, and we\r\n    have the Stanleys here. We go quietly about our work of seeing\r\n    Rome. The Vatican has been much enriched since I was here. The\r\n    sculpture gallery is really wonderful in its superiority to all\r\n    others. I think if I were allowed to choose two pieces I should\r\n    perhaps take the Demosthenes and the Torso. The pictures have also\r\n    secured valuable additions. The Palace of the Caesars since the\r\n    French _scavi_, not by any means finished yet, offers a new world\r\n    to view, and we expect to see another, probably next week, in the\r\n    catacombs. Among modern works seen as yet I am most pleased with\r\n    Tenerani’s Psyche fainting. A German, Löwenthal, has done a very\r\n    good picture of Gibson, and there has come up a singularly\r\n    interesting portrait believed to be of Harvey. But it is idle to\r\n    attempt to write of all the beauties and the marvels. The church\r\n    here is satisfactory; the new clergyman, Mr. Crowther, introduced\r\n    himself on Sunday with an admirable sermon. We expect the\r\n    Clarendons to-night. We do Dante every morning, and are in the\r\n    sixteenth canto.\r\n\r\n    _Dec 4._—At last we have got the Argylls, and I need not say what\r\n    an addition they are, even amidst the surpassing and absorbing\r\n    interests that surround us. I hope for your approbation in that I\r\n    have recommended to his notice a beautiful set of old Sèvres\r\n    dinner plates, soft paste, which with great spirit he has\r\n    purchased for little more, I believe, than half what the\r\n    proprietor refused for them a while ago. I shall be much\r\n    disappointed if you do not think them a valuable acquisition. I\r\n    own that I should never have passed them on to a second purchaser\r\n    had I not, when I first saw them, already got much too near the\r\n    end of my own little tether. But Sèvres plates and all other\r\n    ’objects’ are of small interest in comparison with the great\r\n    events that hang as great thick clouds in the heaven around us,\r\n    yet tipped with broad gleams of light. To-day we are at length\r\n    assured unconditionally of the departure of the French; in which I\r\n    believed already on some grounds, including this, that General\r\n    Count Montebello had ordered sixteen boxes to be packed with the\r\n    spoils of Rome, or his share of them. This departure of the might\r\n    of France represented in the garrison, takes a weight off Roman\r\n    wills and energies, which has for seventeen years bowed them to\r\n    the ground. With what kind of bound will they spring up again, and\r\n    what ugly knocks may be given in the process?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trip was not in every respect successful. On Christmas day, he writes\r\nto Brand: “We have had some discomforts. Our apartments twice on fire, a\r\nfloor burnt through each time. Then I was laid down with a most severe\r\ninfluenza: very sore throat, a thing quite new to me. The Roman climate is\r\nas bad for me as can be.” I have been told by one who saw much of the\r\nparty during the Roman visit, that Mr. Gladstone seemed to care little or\r\nnot at all about wonders of archaeology alike in Christian and pagan Rome,\r\nbut never wearied of hearing Italian sermons from priests and preaching\r\nfriars. This was consonant with the whole temper of his life. He was a\r\ncollector of ivories, of china, of Wedgwood, but in architecture in all\r\nits high historic bearings I never found him very deeply interested. I\r\ndoubt if he followed the controversies about French, Gothic and Italian,\r\nabout Byzantine and Romanesque, with any more concern than he had in the\r\ncontroversies of geology. He had two audiences of Pope Pius IX., as we\r\nhave seen, as had others of his colleagues then in Rome; and Mr. Gladstone\r\nused to tell with much glee in what diverse fashion they impressed the\r\npontiff. “I like but I do not understand Mr. Gladstone,” the pope said;\r\n“Mr. Cardwell I understand, but I do not like; I both like and understand\r\nLord Clarendon; the Duke of Argyll I neither understand nor like.” He saw\r\nten of the cardinals, and at Florence he had an audience of the king “who\r\nspoke very freely”; he had two long interviews with Ricasoli; and some\r\nforty or fifty members of the Italian parliament gave him the honour of a\r\ndinner at which Poerio made a most eloquent speech. To the Duchess of\r\nSutherland he wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Florence, Jan. 13, 1867._—Yesterday Argyll, Cardwell, and I went\r\n    to the king. He spoke with an astounding freedom; freely\r\n    concerning the pope and the emperor, hopeful about Italy in\r\n    general, rather feebly impressed with the financial difficulty,\r\n    and having his head stuffed full of military notions which it\r\n    would be very desirable to displace. We have rumours from England\r\n    of reform and of no reform; but we do not trouble ourselves\r\n    overmuch about these matters. To-morrow I am to be entertained by\r\n    a number of the deputies in memory especially of the Naples\r\n    letters. I shrank from this, as I have long ago been much\r\n    overpraised and overpaid for the affair, but I could not find a\r\n    proper ground for refusing. The dinner is to be a private one, but\r\n    I suppose some notice of it will find its way into the journals.\r\n    It is a curious proof of the way in which a free and open press\r\n    has taken hold here, that the newspapers are ordinarily habitually\r\n    cried in the streets until near midnight!\r\n\r\n\r\n(M63) Among other objects of his keen and active interest was the\r\npreservation for its established uses of the famous monastery founded by\r\nSt. Benedict thirteen centuries before at Monte Cassino,—the first home of\r\nthat great rule and institute which for long ages played so striking part\r\nin the history of civilisation in the western world. He now visited Monte\r\nCassino in the company of Padre Tosti. The historian of this venerable\r\nnursery of learning was his friend long before now—they met first at\r\nNaples in 1850—and he had induced Mr. Gladstone to subscribe for the\r\nreparation of the tomb of the founder. In 1863 Dean Stanley visited the\r\nmonastery with a letter from Mr. Gladstone: “It secured for me not only\r\nthe most hospitable reception, but an outpouring of Padre Tosti’s whole\r\nsoul on pope and church, and Italy and Europe, past and present, in an\r\nalmost unbroken conversation of three hours.” In 1866, it seemed as if the\r\nhand of the Italian government were about to fall as heavily on Monte\r\nCassino as on any other monastic establishment. Mr. Gladstone besides\r\ndoing his best with Ricasoli and others, wrote a letter of admirable\r\nspirit to his friend Sir James Lacaita:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It seems, he said, as if one of the lamps of learning were put\r\n    out; much promise for the future extinguished; and a sacred link\r\n    of union, with the past broken. If it be asked why Englishmen\r\n    should speak and feel on this Italian subject, my answer would be\r\n    this: that the foundation and history of Monte Cassino have the\r\n    interest for us which the Americans of the States feel in Alfred,\r\n    in Edward III., in Henry V. They are part of the great current of\r\n    Italian civilisation which has been diffused and distributed over\r\n    all European lands. Much of my life has been devoted to the\r\n    promotion of public wealth, and of that vast exterior activity\r\n    which distinguishes the age; but I am deeply anxious for the\r\n    preservation of all those centres, not too numerous, at which the\r\n    power of thought may be cultivated, and the inner and higher life\r\n    of man maintained. It has, as you know, been pressed upon me that\r\n    I should endeavour to make a respectful appeal to the Italian\r\n    government on this subject through the medium of a discussion in\r\n    the House of Commons. But I shrink from taking such a course, as I\r\n    fear that the general effect might be to present all appearance of\r\n    intrusive and impertinent interference with the affairs of a\r\n    foreign country, and that the very country towards which I should\r\n    least wish to offer the appearance of a slight I cannot likewise\r\n    refuse to cherish, the hope that the enlightened mind of Baron\r\n    Ricasoli and his colleagues may lead them either to avert or\r\n    mitigate this blow.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his return he passed through Paris. The previous year a signal honour\r\nhad been bestowed upon him by the illustrious Institute of France—founded\r\non that Academy, in which Richelieu had crowned the fame of arms and\r\nstatesmanship by honour to purity in national language and competence in\r\nletters.(151) In acknowledging the election, he wrote to Mignet, the\r\nhistorian, then perpetual secretary:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _11 Carlton House Terrace, March 9, 1865._—I have already\r\n    expressed although in an imperfect manner to your distinguished\r\n    colleagues Count Wolowski and M. Guizot, the sentiments of\r\n    gratitude with which I accept the signal and most unexpected\r\n    honour of my election as a foreign associate of the Institute of\r\n    France. Even the pressure, and what I might call the tumult, of my\r\n    daily occupations do not render me insensible to the nature of\r\n    this distinction, which carries with it a world-wide fame. I will\r\n    not, however, dwell further on the nature of the honour, or on my\r\n    own unworthiness to receive it: except to refer for a moment to\r\n    the gentleman whose name was placed in competition with my own. I\r\n    cannot but be aware of his superior claims. I fear that, for once,\r\n    the judgment of the Academy has erred, and that in preferring me\r\n    to Mr. Mill, its suffrages have taken a wrong direction. I am only\r\n    consoled by reflecting that such a body, with such renown, and\r\n    with its ranks so filled, can afford to suffer the detriment\r\n    attaching to a single mistake. I have the honour to be, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M64) This distinction brought with it the duty of attending the funeral\r\nof a writer eminent among the philosophers and men of letters of his day.\r\nIt had been said of him that three days in the week he was absurd, three\r\ndays mediocre, and one day sublime. The verdict seems to be confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 23._—From 10 to 3.45 at the successive stages of Victor\r\n    Cousin’s interment, in my character of member of the Institute. It\r\n    was of great interest. I saw many most eminent Frenchmen, so many\r\n    that they remained as a cloud upon my recollection, except\r\n    Berryer, Thiers, and some whom I had known before. _Jan.\r\n    26._—Attended the meeting of the Institute 12-2. Spent the rest of\r\n    the afternoon with M. Jules Simon in seeing certain quarters of\r\n    Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yesterday,” he wrote to Mr. Brand (Jan. 27), “a dinner was given to\r\nCardwell and me at the Grand Hotel, by the Society of Political Economists\r\nof France, and I did my best to improve the occasion in terms which might\r\nimply censure on the military measures here and the new turn of affairs.\r\nAlso I am a known accomplice of M. Fould’s. So I let all this be balanced\r\nby dining with the Emperor to-day, and with Rouher to-morrow.” Of the\r\nreception at court, he says, “Dined at the Tuileries, and was surprised at\r\nthe extreme attention and courtesy of both their majesties, with whom I\r\nhad much interesting conversation.” The fates with no halting foot were\r\ndrawing near. The palace was a heap of ashes, host and hostess were\r\nforlorn exiles, before in no long span of time they met their guest again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV. The Struggle For Household Suffrage. (1867)\r\n\r\n\r\n    First of all we had a general intimation and promise that\r\n    something would be done; then a series of resolutions, which\r\n    strutted a brief hour upon the stage and then disappeared; then\r\n    there was a bill, which we were told, on the authority of a\r\n    cabinet minister, was framed in ten minutes, and which was\r\n    withdrawn in very little more than ten minutes; and lastly, there\r\n    was a bill which—undergoing the strangest transformations in its\r\n    course through parliament—did, I will not say, become the law of\r\n    the land, but was altered into something like that which became\r\n    the law of the land.—GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Rome Mr. Gladstone kept a watchful eye for the approaching political\r\nperformances at Westminster. He had written to Mr. Brand a month after his\r\narrival:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _51 P. di Spagna, Oct. 30, ’66._—The Clarendons are to be here\r\n    this evening to stay for a fortnight or three weeks. Dean and Lady\r\n    A. Stanley are in the house with us. I doubt if there are any\r\n    other English parties in Rome.\r\n\r\n    The reform movement is by degrees complicating the question. It is\r\n    separating Bright from us, and in one sense thus clearing our way.\r\n    But then it may become too strong for us; or at least too strong\r\n    to be stayed with our bill of last year. I do not envy Lord Derby\r\n    and his friends their reflections this autumn on the course they\r\n    have pursued. Meanwhile I wish that our press, as far as we may be\r\n    said to have one, would write on this text: _that a bill from\r\n    them, to be accepted by the people, must be larger, and not\r\n    smaller, than would have been, or even would be, accepted from\r\n    us_. For confidence, or credit, stands in politics in lieu of\r\n    ready money. If, indeed, your enemy is stronger than you are, you\r\n    must take what he gives you. But in this case he is weaker, and\r\n    not stronger. A good bill from them would save us much trouble and\r\n    anxiety. A straightforward bill, such an £8 franchise without\r\n    tricks, would be easily dealt with. But their bill will be neither\r\n    good nor straightforward. The mind of Disraeli, as leader of the\r\n    House of Commons, and standing as he does among his compeers, will\r\n    predominate in its formation. Now he has made in his lifetime\r\n    three attempts at legislation—the budget of 1852, the India bill\r\n    of 1858, the Reform bill of 1859. All have been thoroughly\r\n    tortuous measures. And the Ethiopian will not change his skin. His\r\n    Reform bill of 1867 will be tortuous too. But if you have to drive\r\n    a man out of a wood, you must yourself go into the wood to drive\r\n    him. We may have to meet a tortuous bill by a tortuous motion.\r\n    This is what I am afraid of, and what I am, for one, above all\r\n    things anxious to avoid. In 1859 the liberal party had to play the\r\n    obstructive, and with evil consequences. It would be most\r\n    unfortunate if they should be put into such a position again. Pray\r\n    consider this. I do not like what I see of Bright’s speeches. We\r\n    have no claim upon him, more than the government have on us; and I\r\n    imagine he will part company the moment he sees his way to more\r\n    than we would give him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M65) The general character of the operations of 1867, certainly one of\r\nthe most curious in our parliamentary history, was described by Mr.\r\nGladstone in a fragment written thirty years after. Time had extinguished\r\nthe volcanic fires, and the little outline is sketched with temper and a\r\nsort of neutrality:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the parliament reassembled in 1867, parties and groups were\r\n    curiously distributed. The two great bodies were the regular\r\n    supporters of the Tory ministry, and those grouped around us who\r\n    had been expelled. The first did not know what course they would\r\n    have to take; that depended on the secret counsels of another\r\n    mind. To keep to the _drapeau_ was the guiding motive, as has been\r\n    since the creed and practice of Peel were subverted by the\r\n    opposite principles of Disraeli, who on a franchise question had\r\n    his peer colleagues at his feet. Besides these, other divisions\r\n    had to be recognised. The Salisbury secession from the government,\r\n    supported by Sir W. Heathcote and Beresford Hope, was high in\r\n    character, but absolutely insignificant in numbers. There was\r\n    Lowe, so great among the Adullamites of 1866, but almost alone\r\n    among them in the singleness and strength of his opposition to\r\n    reform. There was the bulk of the Adullamite body, unable to place\r\n    themselves in declared opposition to the liberal mass, but many of\r\n    them disposed to tamper with the question, and to look kindly on\r\n    the tory government as the power which would most surely keep down\r\n    any enlargement of the franchise to its minimum. It would be idle\r\n    to discuss the successive plans submitted by the government to the\r\n    House of Commons with an unexampled rapidity. The governing idea\r\n    of the man who directed the party seemed to be not so much to\r\n    consider what ought to be proposed and carried, as to make sure\r\n    that, whatever it was, it should be proposed and carried by those\r\n    now in power. The bill on which the House of Commons eventually\r\n    proceeded was a measure, I should suppose, without precedent or\r\n    parallel, as, on the other hand it was, for the purpose of the\r\n    hour, and as the work of a government in a decided minority, an\r\n    extraordinary stroke of parliamentary success. Our position, on\r\n    the other hand, was this: (1) We felt that if household suffrage\r\n    were to be introduced into the boroughs, it ought to be a real\r\n    household suffrage. (2) The existing state of our legislation,\r\n    under which a large majority of the householders made no\r\n    disbursement of rates, but paid them without distinction in their\r\n    rent, showed that a bill professedly for household suffrage, but\r\n    taking no notice of compounding, would be in the first place a\r\n    lottery, and in the second an imposture. Some towns would have\r\n    large enfranchisement, some none at all, and no principle but the\r\n    accidental state of local law would determine on which side of the\r\n    line any town was to be found. And the aggregate result would be\r\n    ludicrously small as a measure of enfranchisement. Of such a\r\n    measure we could not approve. We did not wish to make at once so\r\n    wide a change as that involved in a genuine household suffrage\r\n    (always in our minds involving county as well as town), and we\r\n    could not fairly separate ourselves from Bright on such a point.\r\n    (3) So we adhered to our idea of an extension, considerable but\r\n    not violent, and performing all it promised.\r\n\r\n    But the Adullamite spirit went to work, and finding that the bill\r\n    had the popular recommendation of a great phrase [household\r\n    suffrage], combined with the recommendation to them of a narrow\r\n    sphere of practical operation, determined to support the principle\r\n    of the bill and abandon our plan, although our mode of operation\r\n    had been warmly approved at party meetings held at my house. The\r\n    result was in a tactical sense highly damaging to us. Perhaps we\r\n    ought to have recognised that the idea of household suffrage, when\r\n    the phrase had once been advertised by a government as its\r\n    battle-ground, was irresistible, and that the only remaining\r\n    choice was whether it should be a household suffrage cribbed,\r\n    cabined, and confined by the condition of personal ratepaying, or\r\n    a household suffrage fairly conforming in substance and operation\r\n    to the idea that the phrase conveyed. The first was in our view\r\n    totally inadmissible; the second beyond the wants and wishes of\r\n    the time. But the government, it must be admitted, bowled us over\r\n    by the force of the phrase; and made it our next duty to bowl them\r\n    over by bringing the reality of the bill into correspondence with\r\n    its great profession. This we were able to do in some degree, when\r\n    we reached the committee, for some of the restrictions included in\r\n    the measure were such as the double-facing liberal fringe did not\r\n    venture to uphold against the assaults of their own party. But the\r\n    grand question of compound householding, which was really to\r\n    determine the character of our legislation, was one on which we\r\n    could not reckon upon either the conscientious or the intimidated\r\n    and prudential support of our liberal fringe. The government were\r\n    beyond all doubt, at least for the moment, masters of the\r\n    situation. The question was raised, if not in its fullest breadth\r\n    yet in a form of considerable efficiency, by a proposal from Mr.\r\n    Hodgkinson, member for Newark, and a local solicitor little known\r\n    in the House.(152) He went there to support it, but without an\r\n    idea that it could be carried, and anticipating its defeat by a\r\n    majority of a hundred. Never have I undergone a stranger emotion\r\n    of surprise than when, as I was entering the House, our whip met\r\n    me and stated that Disraeli was about to support Hodgkinson’s\r\n    motion. But so it was, and the proposition was adopted without\r\n    disturbance, as if it had been an affair of trivial importance.\r\n\r\n    How it came about I partially learned at a later date. A cabinet\r\n    was held after the fact, which Sir John Lambert, the great\r\n    statistician of the day, was summoned to attend. The cabinet had\r\n    had no idea that the Hodgkinson amendment was to be accepted; the\r\n    acceptance was the sole act of Mr. Disraeli; and when it had been\r\n    done the ministers assembled in order to learn from Sir John\r\n    Lambert what was the probable addition that it would make to the\r\n    constituency.\r\n\r\n    I do not suppose that in the whole history of the ’mystery-man,’\r\n    this proceeding can be surpassed. The tories, having been brought\r\n    to accept household suffrage on the faith of the limitation\r\n    imposed by personal payment of the rates, found at a moment’s\r\n    notice that that limitation had been thrown overboard, and that\r\n    their leader had given them a bill virtually far larger than any\r\n    that Mr. Bright had sought to impose upon them. It was certainly\r\n    no business of ours to complain, and they made it no business of\r\n    theirs. I imagine that they still relied upon rectification of the\r\n    bill by the House of Lords. And the Lords did rectify it largely;\r\n    but these rectifications were all rejected when the bill returned\r\n    to us, except the minority [representation], which Mr. Disraeli\r\n    was strong enough to secure by means of the votes of a body of\r\n    liberals who approved it, and which he accepted to humour or\r\n    comfort the Lords a little, while he detested it, and made, as\r\n    Bright said, the best speech ever delivered against it. So came\r\n    about the establishment of an effective household suffrage in the\r\n    cities and boroughs of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M66) The process effecting this wide extension of political power to\r\nimmense classes hitherto without it, was in every respect extraordinary.\r\nThe great reform was carried by a parliament elected to support Lord\r\nPalmerston, and Lord Palmerston detested reform. It was carried by a\r\ngovernment in a decided minority. It was carried by a minister and by a\r\nleader of opposition, neither of whom was at the time in the full\r\nconfidence of his party. Finally, it was carried by a House of Commons\r\nthat the year before had, in effect, rejected a measure for the admission\r\nof only 400,000 new voters, while the measure to which it now assented\r\nadded almost a million voters to the electorate.(153)\r\n\r\nWe always do best to seek rational explanations in large affairs. It may\r\nbe true that “if there were no blunders there would be no politics,” but\r\nwhen we have made full allowance for blunder, caprice, chance, folly,\r\ncraft, still reason and the nature of things have a share. The secret of\r\nthe strange reversal in 1867 of all that had been said, attempted, and\r\ndone in 1866, would seem to be that the tide of public opinion had\r\nsuddenly swelled to flood. The same timidity that made the ruling classes\r\ndread reform, had the compensation that very little in the way of popular\r\ndemonstration was quite enough to frighten them into accepting it. Here\r\nthe demonstration was not little. Riots in Hyde Park, street processions\r\nmeasured by the mile in the great cities from London up to Glasgow,\r\nopen-air meetings attended by a hundred, two hundred, two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand people at Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, showed that even\r\nthough the workmen might not be anxious to demand the franchise, yet they\r\nwould not stand its refusal. In the autumn of 1868 Mr. Bright led a\r\nsplendid campaign in a series of speeches in England, Scotland, and\r\nIreland, marked by every kind of power. It is worthy of remark that not\r\none of the main changes of that age was carried in parliament without\r\nsevere agitation out of doors. Catholic emancipation was won by O’Connell;\r\nthe reform act of 1832 by the political unions; free trade by the league\r\nagainst the corn law. Household suffrage followed the same rule.\r\n\r\nIt was undoubtedly true in a sense that Mr. Gladstone was at the head of a\r\nmajority in 1866, and now again in. 1867. But its composition was\r\npeculiar. Sir Thomas Acland (April 10, 1867) describes Mr. Gladstone as\r\nhampered by three sets of people: “1. Radicals, who will vote for\r\nhousehold suffrage, but don’t want it carried. 2. Whigs (aristocrats), who\r\nwon’t risk a collision with the government, and hope that very little\r\nreform will be carried, and want to discredit Gladstone. 3. A large body\r\nwho care for nothing except to avoid a dissolution.” “There is a fresh\r\nintrigue,” he adds, “every twelve hours.”\r\n\r\nThe trenchant and sardonic mind of the leader of the revolt that had\r\ndestroyed the bill of 1866, soon found food for bitter rumination. On the\r\neve of the session Lowe admitted that he had very little hope of a\r\nsuccessful end to his efforts, and made dismal protests that the reign of\r\nreason was over. In other words, he had found out that the men whom he had\r\nplaced in power, were going to fling him overboard in what he called this\r\nmiserable auction between two parties, at which the country was put up for\r\nsale, and then knocked down to those who could produce the readiest and\r\nswiftest measure for its destruction.\r\n\r\nThe liberal cave of the previous year was broken up, Lowe and the ablest\r\nof its old denizens now voting with Mr. Gladstone, but the great majority\r\ngoing with the government. The place of the empty cave was taken by a new\r\ngroup of dissidents, named from their habitat the party of the Tea-Room.\r\nMany, both whigs above the gangway and even radicals below, were averse to\r\nbringing Lord Russell and Mr. Gladstone back again; they thought a bill\r\nwould have a better chance with the tories than with the old leaders.\r\nInsubordination and disorganisation were complete. “I have never seen\r\nanything like it,” says the new Lord Halifax;(154) “but the state of\r\nthings this year enables me to understand what was very inexplicable in\r\nall I heard of last year.” We can hardly wonder that the strain was often\r\ndifficult to bear. A friend, meeting Mr. Gladstone at dinner about this\r\ntime (March 25), thought that he saw signs of irritated nerve. “What an\r\ninvaluable gift,” he reflects, “a present of phlegm from the gods would\r\nbe! If we could roll up Thompson [master of Trinity] or Bishop Thirlwall\r\nwith him and then bisect the compound, we should get a pair as invincible\r\nas the Dioscuri.” An accomplished observer told his constituents that one\r\nsaw the humour of the great parliamentary chess tournament, looking at the\r\npieces on the board and the face of Disraeli; its tragic side in a glimpse\r\nof the face of Gladstone; in the mephistophelian nonchalance of one, the\r\nmelancholy earnestness of the other.(155)\r\n\r\n(M67) Everybody knew that Disraeli, as he watched the scene from behind\r\nhis mask, now and again launching a well-devised retort, was neither liked\r\nnor trusted, though more than a little feared; and that Gladstone, with\r\nhis deeply lined face, his “glare of contentious eagerness,” his seeming\r\nover-righteousness, both chafed his friends and exasperated his foes. As\r\nit was excellently put by a critic in the press,—the House was\r\nindifferent, and Mr. Gladstone was earnest; the House was lax and he was\r\nstrict; it was cynical about popular equality, and he was enthusiastic; it\r\nwas lazy about details, he insisted upon teaching it the profoundest\r\nminutiæ.(156) About this time, Lord Russell told Lord Halifax that he had\r\ngone down to see his brother the Duke of Bedford when he was dying, and\r\nhad said to him that things were drifting into the country being governed\r\nby Disraeli and Gladstone, and the Duke observed that neither of them was\r\nfit for it. And Halifax himself went on to say that Gladstone had, in\r\ntruth, no sympathy or connection with any considerable party in the House\r\nof Commons. For the old whig party remembered him as an opponent for many\r\nyears; the radicals knew that on many points, especially on all church\r\nmatters, he did not agree with them, and though they admired his talents,\r\nand hailed his recent exertions in favour of reform, they had no great\r\nattachment to him, nor did he seem to be personally popular with any of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFar away from the world of politics, we have an estimate of Mr. Gladstone\r\nat this time from the piercing satirist of his age. “Is not he at any rate\r\na man of principle?” said a quaker lady to Carlyle. “Oh, Gladstone!” the\r\nsage replied, “I did hope well of him once, and so did John Sterling,\r\nthough I heard he was a Puseyite and so forth; still it seemed the right\r\nthing for a state to feel itself bound to God, and to lean on Him, and so\r\nI hoped that something might come of him. But now, he has been declaiming\r\nthat England is such a wonderfully prosperous state, meaning that it has\r\nplenty of money in its breeches pocket.... But that’s not the prosperity\r\nwe want. And so I say to him, ‘You are not the life-giver to England. I go\r\nmy way, you go yours, good morning (with a most dramatic and final\r\nbow).’ ”(157) England however thought otherwise about life-givers, and\r\nmade a bow of a completely different sort. Yet not at once. It was Mr.\r\nDisraeli who played the leading part in this great transaction, not by\r\ninventing the phrase of household suffrage, for that principle was Mr.\r\nBright’s; nor by giving his bill the shape in which it ultimately became\r\nlaw, for that shape was mainly due to Mr. Gladstone, but as the mind by\r\nwhose secret counsels the arduous and intricate manœuvre was directed.\r\n“The most wonderful thing,” wrote Bishop Wilberforce at the end of the\r\nsession, “is the rise of Disraeli. It is not the mere assertion of talent.\r\nHe has been able to teach the House of Commons almost to ignore Gladstone,\r\nand at present lords it over him, and, I am told, says that he will hold\r\nhim down for twenty years.”(158) If Mr. Disraeli said this, he proved\r\nalmost as much mistaken as when Fox was confident of holding the young\r\nPitt down in 1783. Still he impressed his rival. “I met Gladstone at\r\nbreakfast,” says Lord Houghton (May), “he seems quite awed by the\r\ndiabolical cleverness of Dizzy.” Awe, by no means the right word, I fancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M68) On April 12 the first act of the Reform question of 1867 ended in an\r\nawkward crisis for Mr. Gladstone. The details of the story are intricate\r\nand not much to our purpose. Mr. Gladstone’s version printed above\r\ndiscovers its general features. Some particulars, properly biographic,\r\nwill fill up his sketch. “If you have to drive a man out of a wood,” Mr.\r\nGladstone said, “you must yourself go into the wood to drive him.” The\r\nbystander of a later time, however, may be content to keep outside the\r\nthicket until the driver and the driven both emerge. Mr. Disraeli began by\r\npreparing a series of resolutions—platitudes with little relation to\r\nrealities. He told the House that reform should no longer be allowed to\r\ndetermine the fate of cabinets, and the House laughed. Yet if Mr. Disraeli\r\nhad only at this time enjoyed the advantage of a better character—if he\r\nhad been Althorp, Russell, Peel—instead of laughing, his hearers would\r\nperhaps have recognised good sense and statesmanship. As he said later,\r\nwhig prime ministers, coalition prime ministers, coalition chancellors of\r\nthe exchequer, had one after another had their innings, and with a\r\nmajority at their back; was it not well now to try something that might be\r\ncarried by consent? Under pressure from Mr. Gladstone the government\r\nexplained their plan, dropped the resolutions, and brought in a bill.(159)\r\nMen were to have votes who had university degrees, or were members of\r\nlearned professions, or had thirty pounds in a savings bank, or fifty\r\npounds in the funds, or paid a pound in direct taxes; but the fighting\r\npoint was that every householder who paid rates should have a vote. A\r\nscheme for seats accompanied. To comfort his party for giving so wide a\r\nsuffrage, the minister provided checks by conferring a double vote on\r\ncertain classes of citizens, and imposing strict terms as to residence.\r\nThree members of his cabinet, of whom Lord Cranborne was the most\r\nimportant, refused the unsubstantial solace and resigned. But Mr. Disraeli\r\nsaw that he would regain by disorganising his opponents more than he would\r\nlose by dislocating his friends.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone flew down upon the plan with energy, as a measure of\r\nillusory concessions, and securities still more illusory. His speech was\r\ntaken in some quarters in a conservative sense, for Lowe at once wrote to\r\nhim (March 21) urging him to follow it up by resisting the second reading\r\non the principle of righting rent against rating. Since Callimachus, the\r\nAthenian polemarch, had to give the casting vote at Marathon when the ten\r\ngenerals were equally divided on the question of fighting the Persians or\r\nnot fighting, “no one,” cried Lowe, “ever had a weightier case to decide”\r\nthan Mr. Gladstone now. He forgot that the brave Callimachus was slain,\r\nand Mr. Gladstone would in a political sense have been slain likewise if\r\nhe had taken Lowe’s advice, for, as he says, Disraeli had by talk of\r\nhousehold suffrage “bowled them over.” A meeting of 278 liberals was held\r\nat his house, and he addressed them for nearly an hour, concurring not\r\nover-willingly in the conclusion that they should not resist the second\r\nreading.(160) He had a long conversation with Mr. Bright two days before,\r\nwhom he found ’sensible, moderate, and firm,’ and whose view was no doubt\r\nthe opposite of Lowe’s. The bill was read a second time without a division\r\n(March 26).\r\n\r\nA few entries in Sir Robert Phillimore’s journal help us to realise the\r\nstate of the case during this extraordinary session:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 9._—Entire collapse of Gladstone’s attack on government\r\n    yesterday. _Tea-room_ schism of liberal members, including the H.\r\n    of C. Russell. Disraeli’s insolent triumph. 10.—Returned to the\r\n    Coppice with Ld. Richard Cavendish. He tells me Hastings Russell\r\n    and his brother cannot bear Gladstone as their leader. 12.—In the\r\n    middle of the day saw Gladstone and Mrs. Gladstone. His _disgust_\r\n    and _deep mortification_ at the defection of his party, mingled\r\n    with due sense of the loyalty of the greater number, and\r\n    especially of his old cabinet. The expression of my wish that, if\r\n    deserted, he will abdicate and leave them to find another leader\r\n    fully responded to by him. 13.—Defeat of the opposition last\r\n    night; great triumph of Disraeli; a surprise, I believe, to both\r\n    parties; 289 voted with Gladstone. What will he do? _Query._—Ought\r\n    he on account of the defection of 20 to leave so considerable a\r\n    party?\r\n\r\n\r\n(M69) The occasion just mentioned marked a climax. Mr. Gladstone moved an\r\namendment to remove the personal payment of rates as an essential\r\nqualification, and to confer the franchise on the householder whether he\r\npaid the rate direct or through the landlord. The next day the diary\r\nrecords: _April 12._—“Spoke in reply and voted in 289-310. A smash perhaps\r\nwithout example. A victory of 21 for ministers.” A new secession had taken\r\nplace, and 43 liberal members voted with the government, while nearly 20\r\nwere absent. The Cranborne secession was small, and some who had been\r\nexpected to stay away voted with the government. “Gladstone expressed\r\nhimself strongly to five or six members of the late government whom he\r\nsummoned to his house in the morning. He spoke of retiring to a back\r\nbench, and announcing that he would give up the ostensible post of leader\r\nof the opposition. He was dissuaded from doing this at the present moment,\r\nand went out of town, as indeed did almost everybody else.”(161) Still the\r\nnotion of a back bench did lodge itself in his mind for long. The “smash”\r\nwas undoubtedly severe. As Mr. Gladstone wrote to one of the members for\r\nthe City, a supporter, it showed that the liberals whose convictions\r\nallowed united action upon reform were not a majority but a minority of\r\nthe House of Commons. Considering the large number who supported his\r\nproposal, he told his correspondent that though he would move no further\r\namendment of his own, he was not less willing than heretofore to remain at\r\nthe service of the party. “The friendly critics,” he said to Brand, “note\r\na tone of despondency in my letter to Crawford. That is all owing to\r\nGranville and others who cut off a fine peacock’s tail that I had\r\nappended.” So day after day amid surf and breakers he held to his oar. If\r\nMr. Gladstone was much buffeted in the house of his friends, he was not\r\nwithout valiant backers, and among them none was more stout than Mr.\r\nBright, the least effusive of all men in the direction of large panegyric.\r\nSpeaking to his constituents at Birmingham, “Who is there in the House of\r\nCommons,” he demanded, “who equals Mr. Gladstone in knowledge of all\r\npolitical questions? Who equals him in earnestness? Who equals him in\r\neloquence? Who equals him in courage and fidelity to his convictions? If\r\nthese gentlemen who say they will not follow him have any one who is\r\nequal, let them show him. If they can point out any statesman who can add\r\ndignity and grandeur to the stature of Mr. Gladstone, let them produce\r\nhim.” A deputation against the bill from some popular body came to him\r\n(May 11). Mr. Disraeli at once regretted that these “spouters of stale\r\nsedition,” these “obsolete incendiaries,” should have come forward to pay\r\ntheir homage to one who, wherever he may sit, must always remain the pride\r\nand ornament of the House—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Who but must laugh if such a man there be?\r\n    Who would not weep if Atticus were he?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Duchess of Sutherland Mr. Gladstone wrote (July 9):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I do not plead guilty to the indictment for “non-attendance.” I\r\n    think that for three months I have been in the House for more\r\n    hours than the Speaker. I have heard every important word that has\r\n    been spoken on the Reform bill, and at least nine-tenths of all\r\n    the words. True, outside the Reform bill I only attend when I\r\n    think there is a chance of being useful; and in the present state\r\n    of the House these opportunities are few. I act from no personal\r\n    motive. But for me to be present and interfere continuously, or so\r\n    far continuously as I might in other circumstances, would exhibit\r\n    needlessly from day to day the divisions and consequent weakness\r\n    of the liberal party. I admit also that time tells on a man of my\r\n    age and temperament; and my brain tells me that I want more rest\r\n    and not less. Is this unreasonable? I am against all needless\r\n    waste of life or anything else. Everything should be husbanded. I\r\n    must add that more attendance would but aggravate the\r\n    susceptibility which depends on nerves rather than will, and\r\n    already makes my attendance less useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Phillimore diary gives us one or two glimpses more:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _May 9._—Carnarvon delighted with Gladstone’s speech at S.P.G.\r\n    meeting. 10.—Called on Gladstone in bed at 1.30. Ill from effect\r\n    of the great exertion of yesterday—S.P.G. in the morning, H. of C.\r\n    in the evening.... The effect of these defeats of Gladstone in the\r\n    H. of C. has been to bind the whigs closer to him. 24.—The dinner\r\n    to Brand and presentation of plate deferred, ostensibly on the\r\n    ground of his health and necessity of going to German waters,\r\n    really because at present Gladstone refuses to take the chair at\r\n    the dinner, though attached to Brand, because many who had\r\n    deserted him (G.) would attend the dinner. Gladstone will not\r\n    countenance the appearance of a sham union when the party is\r\n    discredited. _June 7._—Attack on Gladstone as being in debt “hard\r\n    pressed by creditors,” and therefore wishing for office. The\r\n    malice against him is wonderful. _29._—Dined at Newspaper Press\r\n    Fund. Gladstone in the chair, made a really faultless speech.\r\n    Never did I hear his voice better, nor the flow of his eloquence\r\n    more unbroken.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo or three items more from Mr. Gladstone’s diary are worth recording:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _May 6._—The underground tone of the House most unsatisfactory.\r\n    _May 9._—Spoke earnestly and long for compound householders, in\r\n    vain. Beaten by 322-256. Much fatigued by heat and work. _May\r\n    28._—Spoke (perforce) on Disraeli’s astonishing declaration of\r\n    consistency. _July 15._—Third reading of Reform bill. A remarkable\r\n    night. Determined at the last moment not to take part in the\r\n    debate, for fear of doing mischief on our own side.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conservative leader himself was exposed to onslaughts from his\r\nfollowers and confederates of the previous year as severe as have ever\r\nfallen on the head of an English party. “Never,” cried Mr. Lowe, in\r\ndesolation and chagrin, “never was there tergiversation so complete. Such\r\nconduct may fail or not; it may lead to the retention or the loss of\r\noffice; but it merits alike the contempt of all honest men, and the\r\nexecration of posterity.” Lord Cranborne, the chief conservative seceder,\r\ndescribed the bill in its final shape, after undergoing countless\r\ntransformations, as the result of the adoption of the principles of Bright\r\nat the dictation of Gladstone. It was at Mr. Gladstone’s demand that\r\nlodgers were invested with votes; that the dual vote, voting papers,\r\neducational franchise, savings-bank franchise, all disappeared; that the\r\ndistribution of seats was extended into an operation of enormously larger\r\nscale. In his most biting style, Lord Cranborne deplored that the House\r\nshould have applauded a policy of legerdemain; talked about borrowing\r\ntheir ethics from the political adventurer; regretted, above all things,\r\nthat the Reform bill should have been purchased at the cost of a political\r\nbetrayal that had no parallel in our parliamentary annals, and that struck\r\nat the very root of that mutual confidence which is the very soul of our\r\nparty government.\r\n\r\nMerciless storms of this kind Mr. Disraeli bore imperturbably. He\r\ncomplained of the intolerant character of the discussions. “Everybody who\r\ndoes not agree with somebody else is looked upon as a fool, or as being\r\nmainly influenced by a total want of principle in the conduct of public\r\naffairs.” He doubted whether Mr. Bright or anybody else could show that\r\nthe tory party had changed their opinions. He had not changed his own\r\nopinions; the bill was in harmony with the general policy they had always\r\nmaintained, though adapted, of course, to the requirements of the year. On\r\nMr. Lowe’s “most doleful vaticinations that ever were heard,” about the\r\nnew voters repudiating the national debt and adopting an inconvertible\r\npaper currency, he poured easy ridicule. Yet only a year before this Mr.\r\nDisraeli himself had prophesied that the end of a seven pound franchise\r\nwould be a parliament of no statesmanship, no eloquence, no learning, no\r\ngenius. “Instead of these you will have a horde of selfish and obscure\r\nmediocrities, incapable of anything but mischief, and that mischief\r\ndevised and regulated by the raging demagogue of the hour.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone summed the matter up in a sentence to Dr. Pusey: “We have\r\nbeen passing through a strange and eventful year: a deplorable one, I\r\nthink, for the character and conduct of the House of Commons, but yet one\r\nof promise for the country, though of a promise not unmixed with evils.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV. Opening Of The Irish Campaign. (1868)\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that\r\n    events have controlled me. Now at the end of three years’\r\n    struggle, the nation’s condition is not what either party or any\r\n    man desired or expected.”—ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1864).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting to his brother-in-law, Lord Lyttelton, in April 1865, Mr.\r\nGladstone sets out pretty summarily the three incidents that had been\r\ntaken to mark the line of his advance in the paths of extreme and\r\nvisionary politics. When it was written, his speech on the franchise the\r\nprevious year had not ripened,(162) and his speech on the Irish church was\r\nonly on the eve, nor did he yet know it, of taking shape as a deliberate\r\npolicy of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Lyttelton._\r\n\r\n    _11 Carlton House Terrace, S.W., April 9, ’65._—Our interesting\r\n    conversation of Wednesday evening, which looked before and after,\r\n    and for your share in which I heartily thank you, has led me to\r\n    review the subject matters, a process which every man in public\r\n    life as well as elsewhere ought often to perform, but which the\r\n    pressure of overwork, and the exhaustion it leaves behind, sadly\r\n    hinder. But I sum up in favour of a verdict of “Not guilty,” on\r\n    the following grounds.\r\n\r\n    As far as I know, there are but three subjects which have exposed\r\n    me to the charge of radicalism: the Irish church, the franchise,\r\n    the paper duty, and the consequent struggle with the House of\r\n    Lords.\r\n\r\n    My opinions on the Irish church were, I know, those of Newcastle\r\n    and Sidney Herbert twenty years ago; and they were not radicals.\r\n    Ever since Maynooth, in 1845, I have seen that resistance _in\r\n    principle_ was gone. That was the main reason which led me to make\r\n    such a serious affair of my own case about the Maynooth grant in\r\n    that year. But I held this embryo opinion in my mind as there was\r\n    no cause to precipitate it into life, and waited to fortify or\r\n    alter or invalidate it by the teachings of experience. At last the\r\n    time for speaking, and therefore for formulating my ideas came,\r\n    and I have spoken according as I believe to be the sense of all\r\n    the leading men with whom I acted from Peel’s death onwards, and\r\n    within the sense not only of Lord Macaulay, but of the present\r\n    Lord Grey.\r\n\r\n    With respect to the franchise, my belief is that the objection\r\n    taken to my speech really turned not upon the doctrine of _prima\r\n    facie_ title, but upon the fact that it was a speech decisively\r\n    and warmly in favour of the £6 franchise or something equivalent\r\n    to it. That is to say, of the very franchise which as a member of\r\n    the cabinet I had supported in 1860, on the credit and promise of\r\n    which Lord Derby had been put out in 1859, and which, if it did\r\n    not appear in the Aberdeen Reform bill of 1852, was represented\r\n    there by other concessions equally large. The truth is this, that\r\n    ever since the Aberdeen Reform bill, I have remained just where it\r\n    placed me; but many seem to think that it is a subject to be\r\n    played with or traded on. In thinking and acting otherwise I feel\r\n    myself to be upholding principles essential to the confidence of\r\n    the people in governments and parliaments, and also a measure\r\n    which promises by reasonably widening the basis of our\r\n    institutions to strengthen the structure above.\r\n\r\n    To the repeal of the paper duty the House of Commons, when led by\r\n    the Derby government, chose to commit itself unanimously, and this\r\n    at a time when the tea duty was at 17d. per lb. In 1860 and 1861\r\n    the cabinet considered the respective claims, and took the same\r\n    course which the Derby government had assisted the House of\r\n    Commons to take before. Upon this it was found that the measure\r\n    which they had approved had become in my hands a radical one; the\r\n    House of Lords was encouraged to rescue the finance of the country\r\n    from the hands of the House of Commons; and the claims of tea were\r\n    declared to be paramount to those of paper. In proposing the\r\n    repeal of the last remaining excise duty upon a simple article of\r\n    manufacture, I adopted a principle which had already received an\r\n    unanimous acceptance. In resisting to the uttermost of my power\r\n    the encroachment of the House of Lords, I acted, as I believe, on\r\n    the only principle which makes it practicable to defend the true,\r\n    legitimate, and constitutional powers of that House itself against\r\n    encroachment from other quarters.\r\n\r\n    Now let me look at the other side of the question. On church\r\n    rates, on university tests, on clerical subscription (the two last\r\n    being the only two questions really of principle which, as far as\r\n    I remember, have been raised), I have held my ground; and on the\r\n    two last the cabinet of which I form a part has in the main\r\n    adopted a course essentially (but with a little _c_) conservative.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of franchise was settled, the question of the powers of the\r\nLords in matters of taxation was settled. The Irish church held its\r\nground. In 1865 Mr. Gladstone voted against a radical member who had moved\r\nthat the case of the Irish church “called for the early attention of the\r\ngovernment.” He agreed with the mover on the merits, but did not believe\r\nthat the time had come. In 1866, when he was leader of the House, he\r\nconcurred with Lord Russell, then first minister, in meeting a motion\r\nagainst the Irish church with a direct negative. “In meeting a question\r\nwith a negative,” he wrote to the Irish secretary (April 7), “we may\r\nalways put it on the ground of time, as well as on the merits. To meet a\r\nmotion of this kind with the previous question only, implies almost an\r\nengagement to take it up on some early occasion, and this I take it we are\r\nnot prepared for.” In the summer of 1865 he wrote to the warden of\r\nGlenalmond that the question was “remote and apparently out of all bearing\r\non the practical politics of the day.” So far as his own judgment went, he\r\nhad told Sir Roundell Palmer in 1863, that he had made up his mind on the\r\nsubject, and should not be able to keep himself from giving expression to\r\nhis feelings. Why did he say that he did not then believe that the\r\nquestion would come on in his time? “A man,” he replied, “who in 1865\r\ncompleted his thirty-third year of a laborious career, who had already\r\nfollowed to the grave the remains of almost all the friends abreast of\r\nwhom he had started from the university in the career of public life; and\r\nwho had observed that, excepting two recent cases [I suppose Palmerston\r\nand Russell], it was hard to find in our whole history a single man who\r\nhad been permitted to reach the fortieth year of a course of labour\r\nsimilar to his own within the walls of the House of Commons; such a man\r\nmight be excused ... if he formed a less sanguine estimate of the fraction\r\nof space yet remaining to him, than seems to have been the case with his\r\ncritics.”(163)\r\n\r\nIt was Maynooth that originally cut from under his feet the principle of\r\nestablishment in Ireland as an obligation of the state. When that went,\r\nmore general reflections arose in his mind. In 1872 he wrote to Guizot:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is very unlikely that you should remember a visit I paid you, I\r\n    think at Passy in the autumn of 1845, with a message from Lord\r\n    Aberdeen about international copyright. The Maynooth Act had just\r\n    been, passed. Its author, I think, meant it to be final. I had\r\n    myself regarded it as _seminal_. And you in congratulating me upon\r\n    it, as I well remember, said we should have the sympathies of\r\n    Europe in the work of giving Ireland justice—a remark which\r\n    evidently included more than the measure just passed, and which I\r\n    ever after saved and pondered. It helped me on towards what has\r\n    been since done.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I must own,” he wrote to Lord Granville (April 11, 1868), “that for years\r\npast I have been watching the sky with a strong sense of the obligation to\r\nact with the first streak of dawn.” He now believed the full sun was up,\r\nand he was right. In an autobiographic note, undated but written near to\r\nthe end of his days, he says:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am by no means sure, upon a calm review, that Providence has\r\n    endowed me with anything that can be called a striking gift. But\r\n    if there be such a thing entrusted to me it has been shown at\r\n    certain political junctures, in what maybe termed appreciations of\r\n    the general situation and its result. To make good the idea, this\r\n    must not be considered as the simple acceptance of public opinion,\r\n    founded upon the discernment that it has risen to a certain height\r\n    needful for a given work, like a tide. It is an insight into the\r\n    facts of particular eras, and their relation one to another, which\r\n    generates in the mind a conviction that the materials exist for\r\n    forming a public opinion and for directing it to a particular end.\r\n    There are four occasions of my life with respect to which I think\r\n    these considerations may be applicable. They are these: 1. The\r\n    renewal of the Income-tax in 1853; 2. The proposal of religious\r\n    equality for Ireland, 1868....\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remaining two will appear in good time. It is easy to label this with\r\nthe ill-favoured name of opportunist. Yet if an opportunist be defined as\r\na statesman who declines to attempt to do a thing until he believes that\r\nit can really be done, what is this but to call him a man of common sense?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M70) In 1867 Ireland was disturbed by bold and dangerous Fenian plots and\r\nthe mischief flowed over into England. In September, at Manchester, a body\r\nof armed men rescued two Fenian prisoners from a police van, and shot an\r\nofficer in charge, a crime for which three of them were afterwards hanged.\r\nIn December a Fenian rolled a barrel of gunpowder up to the wall of a\r\nprison in London where a comrade was confined, and fired it. The explosion\r\nthat followed blew down part of the wall and cost several lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In my opinion,—Mr. Gladstone said afterwards in parliament, and\r\n    was much blamed for saying,—and in the opinion of many with whom I\r\n    communicated, the Fenian conspiracy has had an important influence\r\n    with respect to Irish policy; but it has not been an influence in\r\n    determining, or in affecting in the slightest degree, the\r\n    convictions which we have entertained with respect to the course\r\n    proper to be pursued in Ireland. The influence of Fenianism was\r\n    this—that when the habeas corpus Act was suspended, when all the\r\n    consequent proceedings occurred, when the tranquillity of the\r\n    great city of Manchester was disturbed, when the metropolis itself\r\n    was shocked and horrified by an inhuman outrage, when a sense of\r\n    insecurity went abroad far and wide ... when the inhabitants of\r\n    the different towns of the country were swearing themselves in as\r\n    special constables for the maintenance of life and property—then\r\n    it was when these phenomena came home to the popular mind, and\r\n    produced that attitude of attention and preparedness on the part\r\n    of the whole population of this country which qualified them to\r\n    embrace, in a manner foreign to their habits in other times, the\r\n    vast importance of the Irish controversy.(164)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis influence was palpable and undoubted, and it was part of Mr.\r\nGladstone’s courage not to muffle up plain truth, from any spurious\r\nnotions of national self-esteem. He never had much patience with people\r\nwho cannot bear to hear what they cannot fail to see. In this case the\r\ntruth was of the plainest. Lord Stanley, then a member of his father’s\r\ngovernment, went to a banquet at Bristol in the January of 1868, and told\r\nhis conservative audience that Ireland was hardly ever absent from the\r\nmind of anybody taking part in public affairs. “I mean,” he said, “the\r\npainful, the dangerous, the discreditable state of things that unhappily\r\ncontinues to exist in Ireland.” He described in tones more fervid than\r\nwere usual with him, the “miserable state of things,” and yet he asked,\r\n“when we look for a remedy, who is there to give us an intelligible\r\nanswer?” The state of Ireland, as Mr. Gladstone said later,(165) was\r\nadmitted by both sides to be the question of the day. The conservatives in\r\npower took it up, and they had nothing better nor deeper to propose than\r\nthe policy of concurrent endowment. They asked parliament to establish at\r\nthe charge of the exchequer a Roman catholic university; and declared\r\ntheir readiness to recognise the principle of religious equality in\r\nIreland by a great change in the status of the unendowed clergy of that\r\ncountry, provided the protestant establishment were upheld in its\r\nintegrity. This was the policy of levelling up. It was met by a\r\ncounter-plan of religious equality; disestablishment of the existing\r\nchurch, without establishing any other, and with a general cessation of\r\nendowments for religion in Ireland. Mr. Disraeli’s was at bottom the\r\nprinciple of Pitt and Castlereagh and of many great whigs, but he might\r\nhave known, and doubtless did know, how odious it would be to the British\r\nhouseholders, who were far more like King George III. than they at all\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M71) In May 1867, Mr. Gladstone had told the House that the time could\r\nnot be far distant when parliament would have to look the position of the\r\nIrish church fairly and fully in the face. In the autumn Roundell Palmer\r\nvisited Mr. Cardwell, and discovered clearly from the conversation that\r\nthe next move in the party was likely to be an attack upon the Irish\r\nchurch. The wider aspects of the Irish case opened themselves to Mr.\r\nGladstone in all their melancholy dimensions. At Southport (Dec. 19) he\r\nfirst raised his standard, and proclaimed an Irish policy on Irish lines,\r\nthat should embrace the promotion of higher education in a backward\r\ncountry, the reform of its religious institutions, the adjustment of the\r\nrights of the cultivator of the soil. The church, the land, the college,\r\nshould all be dealt with in turn.(166) It might be true, he said, that\r\nthese things would not convert the Irish into a happy and contented\r\npeople. Inveterate diseases could not be healed in a moment. When you have\r\nlong persevered in mischief, you cannot undo it at an instant’s notice.\r\nTrue though this might be, was the right conclusion that it was better to\r\ndo nothing at all? For his own part he would never despair of redeeming\r\nthe reproach of total incapacity to assimilate to ourselves an island\r\nwithin three hours of our shores, that had been under our dominating\r\ninfluence for six centuries.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas in 1867 Lord Russell announced to Mr. Gladstone his intention\r\nnot again to take office, in other words to retire from the titular\r\nleadership of the liberal party. Mr. Gladstone did not deny his claim to\r\nrepose. “Peel,” he said, “in 1846 thought he had secured his dismissal at\r\nan age which, if spared, I shall touch in three days’ time.”(167) Lord\r\nRussell was now seventy-five. He once told Lord Granville that “the great\r\ndisappointment of his life had been Grey’s refusal to join his government\r\nin December 1845, which had prevented his name going down in history as\r\nthe repealer of the corn laws.” “A great reputation,” wrote Mr. Gladstone\r\nto Granville in 1868, “built itself up on the basis of splendid public\r\nservices for thirty years; for almost twenty it has, I fear, been on the\r\ndecline. The movement of the clock continues, the balance weights are\r\ngone.”(168)\r\n\r\nA more striking event than Lord Russell’s withdrawal was the accession of\r\nMr. Disraeli to the first place in the counsels of the crown. In February\r\n1868 Lord Derby’s health compelled him to retire from his position as head\r\nof the government. Mr. Gladstone found fault with the translator of\r\nStockmar’s _Memoirs_ for rendering “leichtsinnig” applied to Lord Derby as\r\n“frivolous.” He preferred “light-minded”:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The difference between frivolous and light-minded is not a broad\r\n    one. But in my opinion a man is frivolous by disposition, or as\r\n    people say by nature, whereas he is light-minded by defect or\r\n    perversity of will; further he is frivolous all over, he may be\r\n    light-minded on one side of his character. So it was in an eminent\r\n    degree with Lord Derby. Not only were his natural gifts\r\n    unsurpassed in the present age, but he had a serious and earnest\r\n    side to his character. Politics are at once a game and a high art;\r\n    he allowed the excitements of the game to draw him off from the\r\n    sustained and exhausting efforts of the high art. But this was the\r\n    occasional deviation of an honourable man, not the fixed mental\r\n    habit of an unprincipled one.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M72) Mr. Disraeli became prime minister. For the moment, the incident was\r\nmore dramatic than important; it was plain that his tenure of office could\r\nnot last long. He was five years older (perhaps more) than Mr. Gladstone;\r\nhis parliamentary existence had been four or five years shorter. During\r\nthe thirty-one years of his life in the House of Commons, up to now he had\r\nenjoyed three short spells of office (from 1852 to 1868), covering little\r\nmore than as many years. He had chosen finance for his department, but his\r\nbudgets made no mark. In foreign affairs he had no policy of his own\r\nbeyond being Austrian and papal rather than Italian, and his criticisms on\r\nthe foreign policy of Palmerston and Russell followed the debating needs\r\nof the hour. For legislation in the constructive sense in which it\r\ninterested and attracted Mr. Gladstone, he had no taste and little\r\ncapacity. In two achievements only had he succeeded, but in importance\r\nthey were supreme. Out of the wreckage left by Sir Robert Peel twenty-two\r\nyears before he had built up a party. In the name of that party, called\r\nconservative, he had revolutionised the base of our parliamentary\r\nconstitution. These two extraordinary feats he had performed without\r\npossessing the full confidence of his adherents, or any real confidence at\r\nall on the part of the country. That was to come later. Meanwhile the\r\nnation had got used to him. He had culture, imagination, fancy, and other\r\ngifts of a born man of letters; the faculty of slow reflective brooding\r\nwas his, and he often saw both deep and far; he was artificial, but he was\r\nno pharisee, and he was never petty. His magniloquence of phrase was the\r\nexpression of real size and spaciousness of character; as Goethe said of\r\nSt. Peter’s at Rome, in spite of all the rococo, there was _etwas\r\ngrosses_, something great. His inexhaustible patience, his active\r\nattention and industry, his steadfast courage, his talent in debate and\r\nthe work of parliament; his genius in espying, employing, creating\r\npolitical occasions, all made him, after prolonged conflict against\r\nimpediments of every kind, one of the imposing figures of his time. This\r\nwas the political captain with whom Mr. Gladstone had contended for some\r\nsixteen years past, and with whom on a loftier elevation for both, he was\r\nto contend for a dozen years to come.\r\n\r\nOn a motion about the state of Ireland, proceeding from an Irish member\r\n(March 16, 1868) Mr. Gladstone at last launched before parliament the\r\nmemorable declaration that the time had come when the church of Ireland as\r\na church in alliance with the state must cease to exist. This was not a\r\nmere sounding sentence in a speech; it was one of the heroic acts of his\r\nlife. Manning did not overstate the case when he wrote to Mr. Gladstone\r\n(March 28, ’68): “The Irish establishment is a great wrong. It is the\r\ncause of division in Ireland, of alienation between Ireland and England.\r\nIt embitters every other question. Even the land question is exasperated\r\nby it. The fatal ascendency of race over race is unspeakably aggravated by\r\nthe ascendency of religion over religion.” But there were many pit-falls,\r\nand the ground hid dangerous fire. The parliament was Palmerstonian and in\r\nessence conservative; both parties were demoralised by the strange and\r\ntortuous manœuvres that ended in household suffrage; many liberals were\r\nprofoundly disaffected to their leader; nobody could say what the majority\r\nwas, nor where it lay. To attack the Irish church was to alarm and\r\nscandalise his own chosen friends and closest allies in the kindred church\r\nof England. To attack a high protestant institution “exalting its mitred\r\nfront” in the catholic island, was to run sharp risk of awaking the\r\nsleuth-hounds of No-popery. The House of Lords would undoubtedly fight, as\r\nit did, to its last ditch. The legislative task itself was in complexity\r\nand detail, apart from religious passion and the prejudice of race,\r\ngigantic.\r\n\r\nHaving once decided upon this bold campaign, Mr. Gladstone entered upon it\r\nwith military promptitude, and pursued it with an intrepidity all his own\r\namong the statesmen of his day, and not surpassed by Pym in 1640, nor\r\nChatham in 1758, nor Chatham’s son in 1783, nor anybody else in days gone\r\nby. Within a week of this historic trumpet-blast, he gave notice of three\r\nresolutions to the effect that the established church of Ireland should\r\ncease to exist as an establishment. Attendant and consequential changes\r\nwere appended. Within a week of giving notice, he opened the first\r\nresolution, and carried the preliminary motion by a majority of 61. The\r\ncheering at this demonstration of a united and victorious party was\r\nprodigious, both within the House and in Westminster Hall, and an\r\nenthusiastic crowd followed the leader and his two sons as they walked\r\nhome to Carlton House Terrace. “This,” he wrote to the Duchess of\r\nSutherland, “is a day of excitement—almost of exultation. We have made a\r\nstep, nay a stride, and this stride is on the pathway of justice, and of\r\npeace, and of national honour and renown.”(169)\r\n\r\n(M73) The first resolution was carried (April 30) by a majority of 65, and\r\na week later the second and third went through without a division. Mr.\r\nDisraeli fought his battle with much steadiness, but did not go beyond a\r\ndilatory amendment. If Mr. Gladstone had old deliverances to reconcile\r\nwith new policy, so had his tory antagonist. Disraeli was reminded of that\r\nprofound and brilliant oracle of 1844, when he had described the root of\r\nmischief in Ireland as a weak executive, an absentee aristocracy, and an\r\nalien church. He wasted little time in trying to explain why the alien\r\nchurch now found in him its champion. “Nobody listened,” he said, “at that\r\ntime. It seemed to me that I was pouring water upon sand, but it seems now\r\nthat the water came from a golden goblet.” The sentiment may have been\r\nexpressed, he said, “with the heedless rhetoric which, I suppose, is the\r\nappanage of all who sit below the gangway; but in my historical\r\nconscience, the sentiment of that speech was right.” The prime minister\r\ndid not escape taunts from those in his own camp who thought themselves\r\nbetrayed by him upon reform the year before. He repaid the taunts by\r\nsarcasm. He told Lord Cranborne that there was vigour in his language and\r\nno want of vindictiveness, what it wanted was finish. Considering that\r\nLord Cranborne had written anonymous articles against him before and since\r\nthey were colleagues—“I do not know whether he wrote them when I was his\r\ncolleague”—they really ought to have been more polished. Mr. Lowe, again,\r\nhe described as a remarkable man; especially remarkable for his power of\r\nspontaneous aversion; he hates the working classes of England; he hates\r\nthe Roman catholics of Ireland; he hates the protestants of Ireland; he\r\nhates ministers; and until Mr. Gladstone placed his hand upon the ark, he\r\nseemed almost to hate Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Gladstone’s first resolution was carried, the prime minister\r\nacknowledged the change in the relations of the government and the House.\r\nHe and his party had conducted the business of the country though in a\r\nminority, just as Lord John Russell between 1846 and 1851 had conducted\r\nbusiness for five or six years, though in a minority, “but being morally\r\nsupported by a majority, as we have been supported by a majority.” In this\r\ncrisis he pursued a peculiar course. He advised the Queen to dissolve the\r\nparliament; but at the same time he told her Majesty that if she thought\r\nthe interests of the country would be better served, he tendered his\r\nresignation. The Queen did not accept it, he said; and the ministerial\r\ndecision was to dissolve in the autumn when the new constituencies would\r\nbe in order. The statement was not clear, and Mr. Gladstone sought in vain\r\nto discover with precision whether the prime minister had begun by\r\nresigning, or had presented two alternatives leaving the decision to the\r\nQueen, and did he mean a dissolution on existing registers? The answer to\r\nthese questions was not definite, but it did not matter.\r\n\r\nThis episode did not check Mr. Gladstone for a moment in his course; in a\r\nweek after the resolutions were carried, he introduced a bill suspending\r\nthe creation of new interests in the Irish church. This proof of vigour\r\nand resolution rapidly carried the suspensory bill through the Commons.\r\nThe Lords threw it out by a majority of 95 (June 29). If we sometimes\r\nsmile at the sanguine prediction of the optimist, the gloom of his\r\npessimist opponent is more ludicrous. “If you overthrow the Irish\r\nestablished church,” cried the Archbishop of Dublin, “you will put to the\r\nIrish protestants the choice between apostasy and expatriation, and every\r\nman among them who has money or position, when he sees his church go will\r\nleave the country. If you do that, you will find Ireland so difficult to\r\nmanage that you will have to depend on the gibbet and the sword.” The\r\nBishop of Chester and Bishop Thirlwall, whom Mr. Gladstone described as\r\n“one of the most masculine, powerful, and luminous intellects that have\r\nfor generations been known among the bishops of England,” were\r\ndeliberately absent from the division. The effect of the bill was not\r\nimpaired, perhaps it was even heightened; for it convinced the public that\r\nits author meant earnest and vigorous business, and the air was instantly\r\nalive with the thrill of battle. For it is undoubted that if the country\r\ncares for a thing, the resistance to it of the hereditary House seems to\r\nadd spice and an element of sport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI. Prime Minister. (1868)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Geworden ist ihm eine Herrsoherseele,\r\n    Und ist gestellt auf einen Herrscherplatz.\r\n    Wohl uns, dass es so ist!...\r\n          Wohl dem Ganzen, findet\r\n    Sich einmal einer, der ein Mittelpunkt\r\n    Für viele Tausend wird, ein Halt.\r\n                           —SCHILLER.\r\n\r\n    He is possessed by a commanding spirit,\r\n    And his, too, is the station of command.\r\n    And well for us it is so....\r\n    Well for the whole if there be found a man\r\n    Who makes himself what Nature destined him,\r\n    The pause, the central point of thousand thousands.\r\n                        —_Coleridge’s Translation._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the election (Nov. 23) Mr. Gladstone published his _Chapter of\r\nAutobiography_, the history of his journey from the book of 1838 to the\r\nresolutions thirty years later.(170) Lord Granville told him frankly that\r\nhe never liked nor quite understood the first book; that the description\r\nof it in the new “Chapter” gave him little pleasure; that he had at first\r\na feeling that the less a person in Mr. Gladstone’s position published,\r\nthe better; and that unnecessary explanation would only provoke fresh\r\nattacks. But as he read on, these misgivings melted away; he thought the\r\ndescription of a certain phase of the history of the English church one of\r\nthe most eloquent and feeling passages he ever read; the reference to the\r\nnonconformists was a graceful amend to them for being so passionate an\r\nOxonian and churchman; the piece of controversy with Macaulay rather an\r\nexaggeration and not easy to understand; the closing pages admirable. In\r\nshort, he was all for publication. Another close friend of Mr.\r\nGladstone’s, Sir Robert Phillimore, told him (Nov. 29): “I am satisfied\r\nthat you have done wisely and justly both with reference to the immediate\r\nand future influence of your character as a statesman. It is exactly what\r\na mere man of the world would not have done. His standard would have been\r\nthe ephemeral opinion of the clubs, and not the earnest opinion of the\r\nsilent but thoughtful persons to whom the moral character of their chief\r\nis a matter of real moment and concern.” Newman wrote to him from the\r\nOratory at Birmingham, “It is most noble, and I can congratulate you with\r\ngreater reason and more hearty satisfaction upon it, than I could upon a\r\nscore of triumphs at the hustings.” The man of the world and the man at\r\nthe club did not hide their disgust, but Phillimore was right, and great\r\nhosts of people of the other sort welcomed in this publication a sign of\r\nsincerity and simplicity and desire to take the public into that full\r\nconfidence, which makes the ordinary politician tremble as undignified and\r\nindecorous.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Gladstone had rightly divined the state of public feeling about\r\nIreland was shown by the result. Manning put the case in apt words when he\r\nwrote to him: “I have been much struck by the absence of all serious\r\nopposition to your policy, and by the extensive and various support given\r\nto it in England and Scotland. It is not so much a change in men’s\r\nthoughts, but a revelation of what they have been thinking.” Heart and\r\nsoul he flung himself into the labours of his canvass. The constituency\r\nfor which he had sat in the expiring parliament was now divided, and with\r\nMr. H. R. Grenfell for a colleague, he contested what had become\r\nSouth-West Lancashire. The breadth, the elevation, the freshness, the\r\npower, the measure, the high self-command of these speeches were never\r\nsurpassed by any of his performances. When publicists warn us, and rightly\r\nwarn us, that rash expenditure of money extracted from the taxpayer and\r\nthe ratepayer is the besetting vice and peril of democracy, and when some\r\nof them in the same breath denounce Mr. Gladstone as a demagogue pandering\r\nto the multitude, they should read the speech at Leigh, in which he\r\nassailed the system of making things pleasant all round, stimulating local\r\ncupidity to feed upon the public purse, and scattering grants at the\r\nsolicitation of individuals and classes. No minister that ever lived\r\ntoiled more sedulously, in office and out of office, to avert this curse\r\nof popular government. The main staple of his discourse was naturally the\r\nIrish case, and though within the next twenty years he acquired a wider\r\nfamiliarity with detail, he never exhibited the large features of that\r\ncase with more cogent and persuasive mastery. He told the story of the\r\ntransformation of the franchise bill with a combined precision,\r\ncompleteness and lightness of hand that made his articles of charge at\r\nonce extremely interesting and wholly unanswerable. In a vein of pleasant\r\nmockery, on the accusation that he was going to ruin and destroy the\r\nconstitution, he reminded them that within his own recollection it had\r\nbeen wholly ruined and destroyed eight times: in 1828 by the repeal of the\r\nCorporation and Test acts; in 1829 by admitting Roman catholics to\r\nparliament; in 1832 by reform; in 1846 by free trade; in 1849 by repeal of\r\nthe navigation law; in 1858 when Jews were allowed to sit in parliament;\r\nin 1866 when the government of Lord Russell had the incredible audacity to\r\npropose a reform bill with the intention of carrying it or falling in the\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\n(M74) It was a magnificent campaign. But in South-West Lancashire the\r\nchurch of England was strong; orange prevailed vastly over green; and Mr.\r\nGladstone was beaten. Happily he had in anticipation of the result, and by\r\nthe care of friends, already been elected for Greenwich.(171) In the\r\nkingdom as a whole he was triumphant. The liberal majority was 112. When\r\nthe gross votes were added up, it was calculated that the liberals had a\r\nmillion and a half and the conservatives less than a million.(172) After a\r\nlong era of torpor a powerful party thus once more came into being. The\r\ncause was excellent, but more potent than the cause was the sight of a\r\nleader with a resolute will, an unresting spirit of reform, and the genius\r\nof political action. This ascendency Mr. Gladstone maintained for quarter\r\nof a century to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the first of December, he received at Hawarden the\r\ncommunication from Windsor. “I was standing by him,” says Mr. Evelyn\r\nAshley, “holding his coat on my arm while he in his shirt sleeves was\r\nwielding an axe to cut down a tree. Up came a telegraph messenger. He took\r\nthe telegram, opened it and read it, then handed it to me, speaking only\r\ntwo words, ‘Very significant,’ and at once resumed his work. The message\r\nmerely stated that General Grey would arrive that evening from Windsor.\r\nThis of course implied that a mandate was coming from the Queen charging\r\nMr. Gladstone with the formation of his first government.... After a few\r\nminutes the blows ceased, and Mr. Gladstone resting on the handle of his\r\naxe, looked up and with deep earnestness in his voice and with great\r\nintensity in his face, exclaimed, ‘My mission is to pacify Ireland.’ He\r\nthen resumed his task, and never said another word till the tree was\r\ndown.”(173) General Grey reached Hawarden the next day, bringing with him\r\nthe letter from the Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From the Queen._\r\n\r\n    _December 1st_, 1868.—Mr. Disraeli has tendered his resignation to\r\n    the Queen. The result of the appeal to the country is too evident\r\n    to require its being proved by a vote in parliament, and the Queen\r\n    entirely agrees with Mr. Disraeli and his colleagues in thinking\r\n    that the most dignified course for them to pursue, as also the\r\n    best for the public interests, was immediate resignation. Under\r\n    these circumstances the Queen must ask Mr. Gladstone, as the\r\n    acknowledged leader of the liberal party, to undertake the\r\n    formation of a new administration. With one or two exceptions, the\r\n    reasons for which she has desired General Grey (the bearer of this\r\n    letter) to explain, the Queen would impose no restrictions on Mr.\r\n    Gladstone as to the arrangement of the various offices in the\r\n    manner which he believes to be best for the public service, and\r\n    she trusts that he will find no difficulty in filling them up, or\r\n    at least the greater part of them, so that the council may be held\r\n    before the 13th. Mr. Gladstone will understand why the Queen would\r\n    wish to be spared making any arrangements of this nature for the\r\n    next few days after the 13th. The Queen adds what she said on a\r\n    similar occasion two years and a half ago to Lord Derby, that she\r\n    will not name any time for seeing Mr. Gladstone, who may wish to\r\n    have an opportunity of consulting some of his friends, before he\r\n    sees her; but that, as soon as he shall have done so, and\r\n    expresses a desire to see the Queen, she will be ready to receive\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M75) One of his first letters after undertaking to form a government was\r\nto Lord Russell, to whom he said that he looked forward with hope and\r\nconfidence to full and frequent communications, and to the benefit of his\r\nfriendship and advice. “There remains, however, a question,” he went on;\r\n“you have an experience and knowledge to which no living statesman can\r\npretend; of the benefit to be derived from it, I am sure that all with\r\nwhom I can be likely to act would be deeply sensible. Would it be too\r\ngreat an invasion of your independence to ask you to consider whether you\r\ncould afford it as a member of the cabinet without the weight of any other\r\nresponsibility?” Lord Russell replied in cordial terms, but said that the\r\nservitude of a cabinet, whether with or without a special office, was what\r\nhe did not wish to encounter. “What I should have said,” he added at a\r\nlater date (Dec. 28), “if the office of the president of the council or\r\nthe privy seal had been offered me, I do not know: at all events I am\r\npersonally very well satisfied to be free from all responsibility.” Sir\r\nGeorge Grey also declined, on the ground of years: he was within one of\r\nthe threescore and ten allotted to mortal man. Lord Halifax, on whose\r\nability and experience both the Queen and Mr. Gladstone set special value,\r\ndeclined the Irish viceroyalty, and stood good-naturedly aside until 1870\r\nwhen he joined as privy seal. The inclusion in the same cabinet of Mr.\r\nBright, who had been the chief apostle of reform, with Mr. Lowe, its\r\nfiercest persecutor, startled the country. As for Lowe, Lord Acton told me\r\nthat he once informed Mr. Gladstone that Lowe had written the review of\r\nhis _Financial Statements_ in the periodical of which Acton was editor.\r\n“He told me at Grillion’s that I thereby made him chancellor of the\r\nexchequer.” With Bright he had greater difficulties. He often described\r\nhow he wrestled with this admirable man from eleven o’clock until past\r\nmidnight, striving to overcome his repugnance to office. The next day\r\nBright wrote to him (Dec. 5): “Since I left you at midnight I have had no\r\nsleep, from which you may imagine the mental disturbance I have suffered\r\nfrom our long conversation last night. Nevertheless I am driven to the\r\nconclusion to take the step to which you invite me, surrendering my\r\ninclination and my judgment to your arguments and to the counsel of some\r\nwhom I have a right to consider my friends.... I am deeply grateful to you\r\nfor the confidence you are willing to place in me, and for the many kind\r\nwords you spoke to me yesterday.” In the parched air of official politics\r\nthe relation of these two towards one another is a peculiar and a\r\nrefreshing element. In the case of Lord Clarendon, some difficulty was\r\nintimated from Windsor before Mr. Gladstone began his task. Mr. Gladstone\r\nsays in one of his late notes:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clarendon had already held with credit and success for a\r\n    lengthened period the seals of the foreign office, and his\r\n    presumptive title to resume them was beyond dispute. He was a man\r\n    of free and entertaining and almost jovial conversation in\r\n    society, and possibly some remark culled from the dinner hour had\r\n    been reported to the Queen with carelessness or malignity. I do\r\n    not know much, of the interior side of court gossip, but I have a\r\n    very bad opinion of it, and especially on this ground, that while\r\n    absolutely irresponsible it appears to be uniformly admitted as\r\n    infallible. In this case, it was impossible for me to recede from\r\n    my duty, and no grave difficulty arose. So far as I can recollect\r\n    the Queen had very little to say in objection, and no keen desire\r\n    to say it. Clarendon was the only living British statesman whose\r\n    name carried any influence in the councils of Europe. Only\r\n    eighteen or twenty months remained to him; they were spent in\r\n    useful activity. My relations with him were, as they were\r\n    afterwards with Granville, close, constant, and harmonious.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M76) Of this cabinet Mr. Gladstone always spoke as one of the best\r\ninstruments for government that ever were constructed.(174) Nearly\r\neverybody in it was a man of talent, character, and force, and showed high\r\ncapacity for public business. In one or two cases, conformably to the old\r\nGreek saying, office showed the man; showed that mere cleverness, apart\r\nfrom judgment and discretion is only too possible, and that good intention\r\nonly makes failure and incapacity in carrying the intention out, so much\r\nthe more mortifying. The achievements of this cabinet as a whole, as we\r\nshall see, are a great chapter in the history of reform and the prudent\r\nmanagement of national affairs. It forms one of the best vindications of\r\nthe cabinet system, and of the powers of the minister who created, guided,\r\ncontrolled, and inspired it.\r\n\r\n“And so,” Manning, the close friend of other years, now wrote to him, “you\r\nare at the end men live for, but not, I believe, the end for which you\r\nhave lived. It is strange so to salute you, but very pleasant.... There\r\nare many prayers put up among us for you, and mine are not wanting.” At an\r\nearlier stage sympathetic resolutions had been sent to him from\r\nnonconformist denominations, and in writing to Dr. Allon who forwarded\r\nthem, Mr. Gladstone said: “I thank you for all the kind words contained in\r\nyour letter, but most of all for the assurance, not the first I am happy\r\nto say which has reached me, that many prayers are offered on my behalf. I\r\nfeel myself by the side of this arduous undertaking a small creature; but\r\nwhere the Almighty sends us duties, He also sends the strength needful to\r\nperform them.” To Mr. Arthur Gordon, the son of Lord Aberdeen, he wrote\r\n(Jan. 29, 1869):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    As regards my own personal position, all its interior relations\r\n    are up to this time entirely satisfactory. I myself, at the period\r\n    of the Aberdeen administration, was as far as the world in general\r\n    could possibly be, from either expecting or desiring it. I thought\r\n    at that time that when Lord Russell’s career should end, the Duke\r\n    of Newcastle would be the proper person to be at the head of the\r\n    government. But during the government of Lord Palmerston, and long\r\n    before his health broke down, I had altered this opinion; for I\r\n    thought I saw an alteration both in his tone of opinion, and in\r\n    his vigour of administration and breadth of view. Since that time\r\n    I have seen no alternative but that which has now come about,\r\n    although I am sensible that it is a very indifferent one.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 29 he enters in his diary: “This birthday opens my sixtieth\r\nyear. I descend the hill of life. It would be a truer figure to say I\r\nascend a steepening path with a burden ever gathering weight. The Almighty\r\nseems to sustain and spare me for some purpose of His own, deeply unworthy\r\nas I know myself to be. Glory be to His name.” In the closing hours of the\r\nyear, he enters:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    This month of December has been notable in my life as follows:\r\n    _Dec. 1809._—Born. 1827.—Left Eton. 1831.—Classes at Oxford.\r\n    1832.—Elected to parliament. 1838.—Work on Church and State\r\n    published. 1834.—Took office as lord of the treasury.\r\n    1845.—Secretary of state. 1852.—Chancellor of exchequer.\r\n    1868.—First lord. Rather a frivolous enumeration. Yet it would not\r\n    be so if the love of symmetry were carried with a\r\n    well-proportioned earnestness and firmness into the higher parts\r\n    of life. I feel like a man with a burden under which he must fall\r\n    and be crushed if he looks to the right or left or fails from any\r\n    cause to concentrate mind and muscle upon his progress step by\r\n    step. This absorption, this excess, this constant ἄγαν is the\r\n    fault of political life with its insatiable demands, which do not\r\n    leave the smallest stock of moral energy unexhausted and available\r\n    for other purposes.... Swimming for his life, a man does not see\r\n    much of the country through which the river winds, and I probably\r\n    know little of these years through which I busily work and\r\n    live.... It has been a special joy of this December that our son\r\n    Stephen is given to the church, “whose shoe latchet I am not\r\n    worthy to unloose.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI. 1869-1874\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. Religious Equality. (1869)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the removal of this establishment I see the discharge of a debt\r\n    of civil justice, the disappearance of a national, almost a\r\n    worldwide reproach, a condition indispensable to the success of\r\n    every effort to secure the peace and contentment of that country;\r\n    finally relief to a devoted clergy from a false position, cramped\r\n    and beset by hopeless prejudice, and the opening of a freer career\r\n    to their sacred ministry.—GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nAnybody could pulverise the Irish church in argument, and to show that it\r\nought to be disestablished and disendowed was the easiest thing in the\r\nworld. But as often happens, what it was easy to show ought to be done,\r\nwas extremely hard to do. Here Mr. Gladstone was in his great element. It\r\nwas true to say that “never were the wheels of legislative machinery set\r\nin motion under conditions of peace and order and constitutional\r\nregularity to deal with a question greater or more profound,” than when\r\nthe historic protestant church in Ireland was severed from its sister\r\nchurch in England and from its ancient connection with the state. The case\r\nhad been fully examined in parliament. After examination and decision\r\nthere, it was discussed and decided in the constituencies of the United\r\nKingdom. Even then many held that the operation was too gigantic in its\r\nbearings, too complex in the mass of its detail, to be practicable. Never\r\nwas our political system more severely tested, and never did it achieve a\r\ncompleter victory. Every great organ of the national constitution came\r\ninto active play. The sovereign performed a high and useful duty. The\r\nLords fought hard, but yielded before the strain reached a point of\r\ndanger. The prelates in the midst of anger and perturbation were forced\r\nround to statesmanship. The Commons stood firm and unbroken. The law, when\r\nat length it became law, effected the national purpose with extraordinary\r\nthoroughness and precision. And the enterprise was inspired, guided,\r\npropelled, perfected, and made possible from its inception to its close by\r\nthe resource, temper, and incomparable legislative skill of Mr. Gladstone.\r\nThat the removal of the giant abuse of protestant establishment in Ireland\r\nmade a deeper mark on national well-being than other of his legislative\r\nexploits, we can hardly think, but—quite apart from the policy of the act,\r\nas to which there can now be scarcely two opinions—as a monument of\r\ndifficulties surmounted, prejudices and violent or sullen heats overcome,\r\nrights and interests adjusted, I know not where in the records of our\r\nlegislation to find its master.\r\n\r\n(M77) With characteristic hopefulness and simplicity Mr. Gladstone tried\r\nto induce Archbishop Trench and others of the Irish hierarchy to come to\r\nterms. Without raising the cry of no surrender, they declined all\r\napproaches. If Gladstone, they said, were able to announce in the House of\r\nCommons a concordat with the Irish clergy, it would ruin them both with\r\nthe laity of the Irish establishment, and with the English conservatives\r\nwho had fought for them at the election and might well be expected, as a\r\npiece of party business if for no better reasons, to fight on for them in\r\nthe House of Lords. Who could tell that the Gladstone majority would hold\r\ntogether? Though “no surrender” might be a bad cry, it was even now at the\r\neleventh hour possible that “no popery” would be a good one. In short,\r\nthey argued, this was one of the cases where terms could only be settled\r\non the field of battle. There were moderates, the most eminent being\r\nBishop Magee of Peterborough, who had an interview with Mr. Gladstone at\r\nthis stage, but nothing came of it. One Irish clergyman only, Stopford the\r\narchdeacon of Meath, a moderate who disliked the policy but wished to make\r\nthe best of the inevitable, gave Mr. Gladstone the benefit of his\r\nexperience and ability. When the work was done, Mr. Gladstone wrote to the\r\narchdeacon more than once expressing his sense of the advantage derived\r\nfrom his “thorough mastery of the subject and enlightened view of the\r\npolitical situation.” He often spoke of Stopford’s “knowledge, terseness,\r\ndiscrimination, and just judgment.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his own course was clear. He did not lose a day:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 13, 1868._—Saw the Queen at one, and stated the case of the\r\n    Irish church. It was graciously received. 24.—At night went to\r\n    work on draft of Irish church measure, feeling the impulse.\r\n    25.—Christmas Day. Worked much on Irish church _abbozzo_. Finished\r\n    it at night. 26.—Revised the Irish church draft and sent it to be\r\n    copied with notes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general situation he described to Bishop Hinds on the last day of the\r\nyear:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    We cannot wait for the church of Ireland to make up her mind. We\r\n    are bound, nay compelled, to make up ours. Every day of the\r\n    existence of this government is now devoted to putting forward by\r\n    some step of inquiry or deliberation the great duty we have\r\n    undertaken. Our principles are already laid in the resolutions of\r\n    the late House of Commons. But in the mode of applying them much\r\n    may depend on the attitude of resistance or co-operation assumed\r\n    by the Irish church. It is idle for the leading Irish churchmen to\r\n    think “we will wait and see what they offer and then ask so much\r\n    more.” Our mode of warfare cannot but be influenced by the troops\r\n    we lead. Our three _corps d’armée_, I may almost say, have been\r\n    Scotch presbyterians, English and Welsh nonconformists, and Irish\r\n    Roman catholics. We are very strong in our minority of clerical\r\n    and lay churchmen, but it is the strength of weight not of\r\n    numbers. The English clergy as a body have done their worst\r\n    against us and have hit us hard, as I know personally, in the\r\n    counties. Yet we represent the national force, tested by a\r\n    majority of considerably over a hundred voices. It is hazardous in\r\n    these times to tamper with such a force.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the bill went rapidly forward:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, Jan. 13, 1869._—Wrote out a paper on the plan of the\r\n    measure respecting the Irish church, intended perhaps for the\r\n    Queen. Worked on Homer. We felled a lime. 14.—We felled another\r\n    tree. Worked on Homer, but not much, for in the evening came the\r\n    Spencers [from Dublin], also Archdeacon Stopford, and I had much\r\n    Irish conversation with them. 15.—We felled an ash. Three hours\r\n    conversation with the viceroy and the archdeacon. I went over much\r\n    of the roughest ground of the intended measure; the archdeacon\r\n    able and helpful. Also conversation with the viceroy, who went\r\n    before 7. Worked on Homer at night. 19.—One hour on Homer with Sir\r\n    J. Acton. Whist in evening. 20.—Further and long conversations on\r\n    the Irish church question and its various branches with Granville,\r\n    the attorney-general for Ireland, and in the evening with Dean\r\n    Howson, also with Sir J. Acton. 21.—Wrote a brief abstract of the\r\n    intended bill. Woodcutting. 23.—Saw the Queen [at Osborne] on the\r\n    Irish church especially, and gave H.M. my paper with explanation,\r\n    which appeared to be well taken. She was altogether at ease. We\r\n    dined with H.M. afterwards. 24.—Saw her Majesty, who spoke very\r\n    kindly about Lord Clarendon, Mr. Bright, Mr. Lowe, the Spanish\r\n    crown, Prince Leopold, Mr. Mozley, and so forth, but not a word on\r\n    the Irish church. _Feb. 4._—A letter from H.M. to-day showed much\r\n    disturbance, which I tried to soothe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February Lord Granville thought that it might do good if the Queen were\r\nto see Bishop Magee. Mr. Gladstone said to him in reply (Feb. 7, ’69):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The case is peculiar and not free from difficulty. On the whole I\r\n    think it would be wrong to place any limit upon the Queen’s\r\n    communications to the Bishop of Peterborough except this, that\r\n    they would doubtless be made by H.M. to him for himself only, and\r\n    that no part of them would go beyond him to any person whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M78) On Feb. 12, the Queen wrote to Mr. Gladstone from Osborne:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Queen has seen the Bishop of Peterborough according to the\r\n    suggestion made by Lord Granville with the sanction of Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, and has communicated to him in the strictest confidence\r\n    the correspondence which had passed between herself and Mr.\r\n    Gladstone on the subject of the Irish church. She now sends Mr.\r\n    Gladstone a copy of the remarks made by the bishop on the papers\r\n    which she placed in his hands for perusal, and would earnestly\r\n    entreat Mr. Gladstone’s careful and dispassionate consideration of\r\n    what he says. She would point especially to the suggestion which\r\n    the bishop throws out of the intervention of the bench of English\r\n    bishops. The country would feel that any negotiation conducted\r\n    under the direction of the Archbishop of Canterbury would be\r\n    perfectly safe, and from the concessions which the Bishop of\r\n    Peterborough expresses his own readiness to make, the Queen is\r\n    sanguine in her hope that such negotiations would result in a\r\n    settlement of the question on conditions which would entirely\r\n    redeem the pledges of the government and be satisfactory to the\r\n    country. The Queen must therefore strongly deprecate the hasty\r\n    introduction of the measure, which would serve only to commit the\r\n    government to proposals from which they could not afterwards\r\n    recede, while it is _certain_ from what the bishop says, that they\r\n    would not be accepted on the other side, and thus an acrimonious\r\n    contest would be begun, which, however it ended, would make any\r\n    satisfactory settlement of the question impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe replied on the following day:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 13._—First the bishop suggests that the endowments posterior\r\n    to the Reformation should be given to the church, and those\r\n    preceding it to the Roman catholics. It would be more than idle\r\n    and less than honest, were Mr. Gladstone to withhold from your\r\n    Majesty his conviction that no negotiation founded on such a basis\r\n    as this could be entertained, or, if entertained, could lead to\r\n    any satisfactory result. Neither could Mr. Gladstone persuade the\r\n    cabinet to adopt it, nor could the cabinet persuade the House of\r\n    Commons, nor could cabinet and House of Commons united persuade\r\n    the nation to acquiesce, and the very attempt would not only\r\n    prolong and embitter controversy, but would weaken authority in\r\n    this country. For the thing contemplated is the very thing that\r\n    the parliament was elected not to do.\r\n\r\n    _Osborne, Feb. 14._—The Queen thanks Mr. Gladstone for his long\r\n    letter, and is much gratified and relieved by the conciliatory\r\n    spirit expressed throughout his explanations on this most\r\n    difficult and important question. The Queen thinks it would indeed\r\n    be most desirable for him to see the Archbishop of Canterbury—and\r\n    she is quite ready to write to the archbishop to inform him of her\r\n    wish and of Mr. Gladstone’s readiness to accede to it, should he\r\n    wish it.\r\n\r\n\r\n“My impression is,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord Granville (Feb. 14), “that\r\nwe should make a great mistake if we were to yield on the point of time.\r\nIt is not time that is wanted; we have plenty of time to deal with the\r\nBishop of Peterborough’s points so far as they can be dealt with at all.\r\nSir R. Palmer has been here to-day with overtures from persons of\r\nimportance unnamed. I think probably the Archbishop of Canterbury and\r\nothers.(175) I do not doubt that on the other side they want time, for\r\ntheir suggestions are crude.”\r\n\r\n(M79) On the following day (Feb. 15) the Queen wrote to the archbishop,\r\ntelling him that she had seen Mr. Gladstone, “who shows the most\r\nconciliatory disposition,” and who at once assured her “of his\r\nreadiness—indeed, his anxiety—to meet the archbishop and to communicate\r\nfreely with him.” The correspondence between the Queen and the archbishop\r\nhas already been made known, and most of that between the archbishop and\r\nMr. Gladstone, and I need not here reproduce it, for, in fact, at this\r\nfirst stage nothing particular came of it.(176) “The great mistake, as it\r\nseems to me,” Mr. Gladstone writes to Archdeacon Stopford (Feb. 8), “made\r\nby the Irish bishops and others is this. They seem to think that our\r\nfriends are at the mercy of our adversaries, whereas our adversaries are\r\nreally at the mercy of our friends, and it is to these latter that the\r\ngovernment, especially in the absence of other support, must look.”\r\nMeanwhile the bill had made its way through the cabinet:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 8._—Cabinet, on the heads of Irish Church bill.. 9.—Cabinet,\r\n    we completed the heads of the Irish Church measure to my great\r\n    satisfaction. 19.—At Lambeth, 12-1-½ explaining to the archbishop.\r\n    22.—Conclave on Irish church, 3-4-½ and 5-½-7-3/4. After twenty\r\n    hours’ work we finished the bill for this stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 1, Mr. Gladstone brought his plan before a House of Commons eager\r\nfor its task, triumphant in its strength out of doors, and confident that\r\nits leader would justify the challenge with which for so many months the\r\ncountry had been ringing. The details are no longer of concern, and only\r\nbroader aspects survive. A revolutionary change was made by the complete\r\nand definite severance of the protestant episcopal church in Ireland alike\r\nfrom the established church of England and from the government of the\r\nUnited Kingdom. A far more complex and delicate task was the winding up of\r\na great temporal estate, the adjustment of many individual and corporate\r\ninterests, and the distribution of some sixteen millions of property among\r\npersons and purposes to be determined by the wisdom of a parliament, where\r\nrival claims were defended by zealous and powerful champions influenced by\r\nthe strongest motives, sacred and profane, of party, property, and church.\r\nIt was necessary to deal with the sums, troublesome though not\r\nconsiderable, allotted to the presbyterians and to the catholic seminary\r\nat Maynooth. Machinery was constructed for the incorporation of a body to\r\nrepresent the emancipated church, and to hold property for any of its uses\r\nand purposes. Finally, the residue of the sixteen millions, after all the\r\njust demands upon it had been satisfied, computed at something between\r\nseven and eight millions, was appropriated in the words of the preamble,\r\n“not for the maintenance of any church or clergy, nor for the teaching of\r\nreligion, but mainly for the relief of unavoidable calamity and suffering”\r\nnot touched by the poor law.\r\n\r\nThe speech in which this arduous scheme was explained to parliament was\r\nregarded as Mr. Gladstone’s highest example of lucid and succinct\r\nunfolding of complicated matter. Mr. Disraeli said there was not a single\r\nword wasted. So skilfully were the facts marshalled, that every single\r\nhearer believed himself thoroughly to comprehend the eternal principles of\r\nthe commutation of tithe-rent-charge, and the difference in the justice\r\ndue to a transitory and a permanent curate. Manning said that the only two\r\nlegislative acts in our history that approached it in importance for\r\nIreland were the repeal of the penal laws and the Act of Union. However\r\nthis may be, it is hardly an excess to say that since Pitt, the author of\r\nthe Act of Union, the author of the Church Act was the only statesman in\r\nthe roll of the century, capable at once of framing such a statute and\r\nexpounding it with the same lofty and commanding power.(177)\r\n\r\n(M80) In a fugitive note, Mr. Gladstone named one or two of the speakers\r\non the second reading: “Ball: elaborate and impressive, answered with\r\ngreat power by Irish attorney-general. Bright: very eloquent and striking.\r\nYoung George Hamilton: a first speech of great talent, admirably\r\ndelivered. Hardy: an uncompromising defence of laws and institutions as\r\nthey are, with a severe picture of the character and civil conduct of the\r\nIrish population.” Mr. Disraeli’s speech was even more artificial than\r\nusual. It was Mr. Hardy and Dr. Ball who gave cogent and strenuous\r\nexpression to the argument and passion of the church case. When the\r\ndivision came, called by Mr. Gladstone “notable and historic” (March 24),\r\nthe majority in a crowded house was 118.(178) “Our division this morning,”\r\nMr. Gladstone wrote to Lord Granville, “even exceeded expectations, and\r\nwill powerfully propel the bill.” The size of this majority deserves the\r\nreader’s attention, for it marked the opening of a new parliamentary era.\r\nIn 1841 Peel had turned out the whigs by a majority of 91. Lord John\r\nRussell was displaced in 1852 by 9. The Derby government was thrown out in\r\nDecember 1852 by 19. The same government was again thrown out seven years\r\nlater by 13. Palmerston was beaten in 1857 by 14, and the next year by 19.\r\nIn 1864 Palmerston’s majority on the Danish question was only 18. The\r\nsecond reading of the Franchise bill of 1866 was only carried by 5, and\r\nministers were afterwards beaten upon it by 11. With Mr. Gladstone’s\r\naccession the ruling majority for a long time stood at its highest both in\r\nsize and stability.\r\n\r\nWith invincible optimism, Mr. Gladstone believed that he would now have\r\n“material communications from the heads of the Irish church”; but letters\r\nfrom Lord Spencer at Dublin Castle informed him that, on the contrary,\r\nthey were angrier after they knew what the majority meant, than they were\r\nbefore. At the diocesan conferences throughout Ireland the bill was\r\ndenounced as highly offensive to Almighty God, and the greatest national\r\nsin ever committed. The Archdeacon of Ossory told churchmen to trust to\r\nGod and keep their powder dry, though he afterwards explained that he did\r\nnot allude to carnal weapons. The cabinet was called a cabinet of\r\nbrigands, and protestant pastors were urged to see to it that before they\r\ngave up their churches to an apostate system a barrel of gunpowder and a\r\nbox of matches should blow the cherished fabrics to the winds of heaven.\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Disraeli’s astuteness was at fault. The Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nperceived from his conversation that he was bent on setting the liberals\r\nby the ears, that he looked for speeches such as would betray utter\r\ndissension amid professed agreement, that he had good hopes of shattering\r\nthe enemy, and “perhaps of playing over again the game that had destroyed\r\nLord Russell’s Reform bill of 1866.” The resounding majority on the second\r\nreading, he told the archbishop, was expected; it created no enthusiasm;\r\nit was a mechanical majority.(179)\r\n\r\nThe bill swept through the stages of committee without alteration of\r\nsubstance and with extraordinary celerity, due not merely to the “brute\r\nmajority,” nor to the confidence that all was sure to be undone in another\r\nplace, but to the peculiar powers developed by the minister. From the\r\nspeech in which he unfolded his plan, down to the last amendment on\r\nreport, he showed a mastery alike of himself and of his project and of the\r\nbusiness from day to day in hand, that routed opposition and gave new\r\nanimation and ardour to the confidence of his friends. For six or seven\r\nhours a day he astonished the House by his power of attention, unrelaxed\r\nyet without strain, by his double grasp of leading principle and intricate\r\ndetail, by his equal command of legal and historic controversy and of all\r\nthe actuarial niceties and puzzles of commutation. “In some other\r\nqualities of parliamentary statesmanship,” says one acute observer of that\r\ntime, “as an orator, a debater, and a tactician he has rivals; but in the\r\npowers of embodying principles in legislative form and preserving unity of\r\npurpose through a multiplicity of confusing minutiae he has neither equal\r\nnor second among living statesmen.”(180) The truth could not be better\r\nsummed up. He carried the whole of his party with him, and the average\r\nmajority in divisions on the clauses was 113. Of one dangerous corner, he\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _May 6._—H of C, working Irish Church bill. Spoke largely on\r\n    Maynooth. [Proposal to compensate Maynooth out of the funds of the\r\n    Irish church.] The final division on the pinching point with a\r\n    majority of 107 was the most creditable (I think) I have ever\r\n    known.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy a majority of 114 the bill was read a third time on the last day of\r\nMay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M81) The contest was now removed from the constituencies and their\r\nrepresentatives in parliament to the citadel of privilege. The issue was\r\nno longer single, and the struggle for religious equality in Ireland was\r\nhenceforth merged before the public eye in a conflict for the supremacy of\r\nthe Commons in England. Perhaps I should not have spoken of religious\r\nequality, for in fact the establishment was known to be doomed, and the\r\nfight turned upon the amount of property with which the free church was to\r\ngo forth to face its new fortunes. “I should urge the House of Lords,”\r\nwrote the Archbishop of Canterbury to Mr. Gladstone (June 3), “to give all\r\nits attention to saving as large an endowment as possible.”\r\n\r\nAs at the first stage the Queen had moved for conciliatory courses, so now\r\nshe again desired Archbishop Tait to communicate with the prime minister.\r\nTo Mr. Gladstone himself she wrote from Balmoral (June 3): “The Queen\r\nthanks Mr. Gladstone for his kind letter. She has invariably found him\r\nmost ready to enter into her views and to understand her feelings.” The\r\nfirst question was whether the Lords should reject the bill on the second\r\nreading:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is eminently desirable, Mr. Gladstone wrote to the archbishop\r\n    (June 4), that the bill should be read a second time. But if I\r\n    compare two methods, both inexpedient, one that of rejection on\r\n    the second reading, the other that of a second reading followed by\r\n    amendments inconsistent with the principle, I know no argument in\r\n    favour of the latter, except what relates to the very important\r\n    question of the position and true interest of the House of Lords\r\n    itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time he promised the archbishop that any views of his upon\r\namendments would have the most careful attention of himself and his\r\ncolleagues, and “they would be entertained in a spirit not of jealousy but\r\nof freedom, with every desire to bring them into such a shape that they\r\nmay be in furtherance, and not in derogation, of the main design of the\r\nbill.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Grey, the Queen’s secretary, told Mr. Gladstone that she had\r\ncommunicated with the archbishop, “having heard that violent counsels were\r\nlikely to prevail, and that in spite of their leaders, the opposition in\r\nthe House of Lords was likely to try and throw out the measure on the\r\nsecond reading.” Her own feeling was expressed in General Grey’s letter to\r\nthe archbishop of the same date, of which a copy was sent to the prime\r\nminister:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gladstone is not ignorant (indeed the Queen has never\r\n    concealed her feeling on the subject) how deeply her Majesty\r\n    deplores the necessity, under which he conceived himself to lie,\r\n    of raising the question as he has done; or of the apprehensions of\r\n    which she cannot divest herself, as to the possible consequences\r\n    of the measure which he has introduced. These apprehensions, her\r\n    Majesty is bound to say, still exist in full force; but\r\n    considering the circumstances under which the measure has come to\r\n    the House of Lords, the Queen cannot regard without the greatest\r\n    alarm the probable effect of its absolute rejection in that House.\r\n    Carried, as it has been, by an overwhelming and steady majority\r\n    through a House of Commons, chosen expressly to speak the feeling\r\n    of the country on the question, there seems no reason to believe\r\n    that any fresh appeal to the people would lead to a different\r\n    result. The rejection of the bill, therefore, on the second\r\n    reading, would only serve to bring the two Houses into collision,\r\n    and to prolong a dangerous agitation on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone replied:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _June 5._—From such information as has indirectly reached Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, he fears that the leaders of the majority in the House\r\n    of Lords will undoubtedly oppose the second reading of the Irish\r\n    Church bill, of which Lord Harrowby is to propose the rejection.\r\n    He understands that Lord Salisbury, as well as Lord Carnarvon,\r\n    decidedly, but in vain, objected to this course at the meeting\r\n    held to-day at the Duke of Marlborough’s. Very few of the bishops\r\n    were present. Lord Derby, it is said, supported the resolution.\r\n    Although a division must now be regarded as certain, and as very\r\n    formidable, all hope need not be abandoned that your Majesty’s\r\n    wise counsels through the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the\r\n    sagacity of the peers themselves with reference to the security\r\n    and stability of their position in the legislature, may avail to\r\n    frustrate an unwise resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n“How much more effectually,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to Hawarden, “could the\r\nQueen assist in the settlement of this question were she not six hundred\r\nmiles off.” As it was, she took a step from which Mr. Gladstone hoped for\r\n“most important consequences,” in writing direct to Lord Derby, dwelling\r\non the danger to the Lords of a collision with the Commons. In a record of\r\nthese proceedings prepared for Mr. Gladstone (August 4, ’69), Lord\r\nGranville writes:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Before the second reading of the Irish Church bill in the House of\r\n    Lords, I was asked by the Archbishop of York to meet him and the\r\n    Archbishop of Canterbury. They said it was impossible for them to\r\n    vote for the second reading in any case, but before they decided\r\n    to abstain from voting against it they wished to know how far the\r\n    government would act in a conciliatory spirit. I made to them the\r\n    same declaration that I afterwards made in the House, and after\r\n    seeing you I had another interview with the Archbishop of\r\n    Canterbury. I told his grace that it was impossible for the\r\n    government to suggest amendments against themselves, but I gave a\r\n    hint of the direction in which such amendments might be framed,\r\n    and, without mentioning that the suggestion came from you, I said\r\n    that if his grace would tell Dr. Ball that he only wished to\r\n    propose amendments which it would be possible for the government\r\n    to accept, that learned gentleman would know better than others\r\n    how it could be done. The archbishop, however seems chiefly to\r\n    have made use of Dr. Ball to supply him with arguments against the\r\n    government.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result was doubtful to the very end. It was three o’clock in the\r\nmorning (June 19) before the close of a fine debate—fine not merely from\r\nthe eloquence of the speakers and cogency of argument on either side, but\r\nbecause there was a deep and real issue, and because the practical\r\nconclusion was not foregone. It was the fullest House assembled in living\r\nmemory. Three hundred and twenty-five peers voted. The two English\r\narchbishops did not vote, and Thirlwall was the only prelate who supported\r\nthe second reading. It was carried by a majority of 33. In 1857 Lord\r\nDerby’s vote of censure on Palmerston for the China war was defeated by\r\n36, and these two were the only cases in which the conservatives had been\r\nbeaten in the Lords for twenty years. Thirty-six conservative peers,\r\nincluding Lord Salisbury, voted away from their party in favour of the\r\nsecond reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M82) For the moment ministers breathed freely, but the bill was soon in\r\nthe trough of the sea. The archbishop wrote to the Queen that they had\r\ndecided if they could not get three million pounds to float the new church\r\nupon, they would take their chance of what might happen by postponing the\r\nbill until next year. Asked by the Queen what could be done (July 10),\r\nLord Granville, being at Windsor, answered that the cabinet would not make\r\nup their mind until they knew how far the Lords would go in resistance,\r\nbut he thought it right to tell her that there was no chance of ministers\r\nagreeing to postpone the bill for another year. The day after this\r\nconversation, the Queen wrote again to the archbishop, asking him\r\nseriously to reflect, in case the concessions of the government should not\r\ngo quite so far as he might himself wish, whether the postponement of the\r\nsettlement for another year would not be likely to result rather in worse\r\nthan in better terms for the church. She trusted that he would himself\r\nconsider, and endeavour to induce others to consider, any concessions\r\noffered by the House of Commons in the most conciliatory spirit, rather\r\nthan to try and get rid of the bill. “The amendments,” said Mr. Gladstone,\r\n“seem to mean war to the knife.”\r\n\r\nAfter the second reading a tory lady of high station told Lord Clarendon\r\nand Mr. Delane that in her opinion a friendly communication might have\r\ngreat influence on Lord Salisbury’s course.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I therefore wrote to him (Lord Granville says in the memorandum\r\n    already referred to), stating why on public and personal grounds\r\n    it was desirable that he should meet you. I said that although it\r\n    would be difficult for us to initiate suggestions, yet from your\r\n    personal regard for him such a conversation would advance matters.\r\n    He consented, stating that he was in communication as to\r\n    amendments with Lord Cairns and the archbishop. He was extremely\r\n    desirous that no one should know of the interview. You were of\r\n    opinion that the interview had done good, and I wrote to ask Lord\r\n    Salisbury whether he would like me to put dots on some of your\r\n    i’s. He declined, and considered the interview had been\r\n    unsatisfactory, but gave me an assurance of his desire to avoid a\r\n    conflict.... On the 4th of July I wrote again suggesting a\r\n    compromise on Lord Carnarvon’s clause. He declined, that clause\r\n    being the one thing they cared about. He ended by telling me his\r\n    growing impression was, that there would be no Church bill this\r\n    session.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general result of the operations of the Lords was to leave\r\ndisestablishment complete, and the legal framework of the bill\r\nundisturbed. Disendowment, on the other hand, was reduced to a shadow. An\r\nadditional sum of between three and four millions was taken for the\r\nchurch, and the general upshot was, out of a property of sixteen millions,\r\nto make over thirteen or fourteen millions to an ecclesiastical body\r\nwholly exempt from state control. This, Mr. Gladstone told the Queen, the\r\nHouse of Commons would never accept, and the first effect of persistence\r\nin such a course would be a stronger move against the episcopal seats in\r\nthe House of Lords than had been seen for more than two hundred years. He\r\nridiculed as it deserved the contention that the nation had not passed\r\njudgment on the question of disendowment, and he insisted that the\r\ngovernment could not go further than three quarters of a million towards\r\nmeeting the extravagant claims of the Lords. Confessing his disappointment\r\nat the conduct of the episcopal body, even including the archbishop, he\r\nfound a certain consolation in reflecting that equally on the great\r\noccasions of 1829 and 1831, though ’the mild and wise Archbishop Howley\r\nwas its leader,’ that body failed either to meet the desires of the\r\ncountry, or to act upon a far-sighted view of the exigencies of the\r\nchurch. One point obstinately contested was the plan for the future\r\napplication of the surplus. A majority of the Lords insisted on casting\r\nout the words of the preamble providing that the residue should not be\r\napplied for purposes of religion, and substituting in one shape or another\r\nthe principle of concurrent endowment, so hostile, as Mr. Gladstone judged\r\nit, to the peace of Ireland, and so irreconcilable with public feeling in\r\nEngland and Scotland.\r\n\r\nOn July 12, the bill came back to the Commons. The tension had hardly yet\r\nbegun to tell upon him, but Mr. Gladstone enters on these days:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 11._—Formidable accounts from and through Windsor. 12.—The\r\n    time grows more and more anxious. 15.—This day I received from a\r\n    Roman catholic bishop the assurance that he offered mass, and that\r\n    many pray for me; and from Mr. Spurgeon (as often from others), an\r\n    assurance of the prayers of the nonconformists. I think in these\r\n    and other prayers lies the secret of the strength of body which\r\n    has been given me in unusual measure during this very trying year.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the day on which, amid the ardent cheers of his party, he arose\r\nto announce to the House the views of the government. He was in no\r\ncompromising mood. In a short speech he went through the amendments made\r\nby men so out of touch with the feeling of the country that they might\r\nhave been “living in a balloon.” One by one he moved the rejection of all\r\namendments that involved the principle of concurrent endowment, the\r\ndisposal of the surplus, or the postponement of the date of\r\ndisestablishment. He agreed, however, to give a lump sum of half a million\r\nin lieu of private benefactions, to readjust the commutation terms, and\r\nmake other alterations involving a further gift of £280,000 to the church.\r\nWhen the Commons concluded the consideration of the Lords’ amendments\r\n(July 16), Mr. Gladstone observed three things: first, that the sentiment\r\nagainst concurrent endowment in any form was overwhelming; second, that\r\nnot only was no disposition shown to make new concessions, but concessions\r\nactually made were sorely grudged; and third, that the tories were eager\r\nto postpone the destination of the residuary property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M83) On July 16, the bill, restored substantially to its first shape, was\r\nagain back on the table of the Lords, and shipwreck seemed for five days\r\nto be inevitable. On July 20, at eleven o’clock, by a majority of 175 to\r\n93, the Lords once more excluded from the preamble the words that the\r\nCommons had placed and replaced there, in order to declare the policy of\r\nparliament on matters ecclesiastical in Ireland. This involved a meaning\r\nwhich Mr. Gladstone declared that no power on earth could induce the\r\nCommons to accept. The crisis was of unsurpassed anxiety for the prime\r\nminister. He has fortunately left his own record of its phases:(181)—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, July 17._—On the 16th of July the amendments made by\r\n    the Lords in the Irish Church bill had been completely disposed of\r\n    by the House of Commons. The last division, taken on the disposal\r\n    of the residue, had, chiefly through mere lazy absences, reduced\r\n    the majority for the government to 72. This _relative_ weakness\r\n    offered a temptation to the opposition to make play upon the\r\n    point. The cabinet met the next forenoon. We felt on the one hand\r\n    that it might be difficult to stake the bill on the clause for the\r\n    disposal of the residue, supposing that to be the single remaining\r\n    point of difference; but that the postponement of this question\r\n    would be a great moral and political evil, and that any concession\r\n    made by us had far better be one that would be of some value to\r\n    the disestablished church.\r\n\r\n    By desire of the cabinet I went to Windsor in the afternoon, and\r\n    represented to H.M. what it was in our power to do; namely,\r\n    although we had done all we could do upon the merits, yet, for the\r\n    sake of peace and of the House of Lords, [we were willing], (_a_)\r\n    to make some one further pecuniary concession to the church of\r\n    sensible though not very large amount; (_b_) to make a further\r\n    concession as to curates, slight in itself; (_c_) to amend the\r\n    residue clause so as to give to parliament the future control, and\r\n    to be content with simply declaring the principle on which the\r\n    property should be distributed. The Queen, while considering that\r\n    she could not be a party to this or that particular scheme, agreed\r\n    that it might be proper to make a representation to the archbishop\r\n    to the general effect that the views of the government at this\r\n    crisis of the measure were such as deserved to be weighed, and to\r\n    promote confidential communication between us. She intimated her\r\n    intention to employ the Dean of Windsor as a medium of\r\n    communication between herself and the archbishop, and wished me to\r\n    explain particulars fully to him. I went to the deanery, and, not\r\n    finding the dean, had written as much as here follows on a scrap\r\n    of paper, when he came in....\r\n\r\n    The object of this paper was to induce the archbishop to\r\n    discountenance any plan for pressing the postponement of the\r\n    provisions respecting the residue, and to deal with us in\r\n    preference respecting any practicable concession to the church.\r\n    When the dean came in, I explained this further, recited the\r\n    purport of my interview with the Queen, and on his asking me\r\n    confidentially for his own information, I let him know that the\r\n    further pecuniary concession we were prepared to recommend would\r\n    be some £170,000 or £180,000.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, July 18._—In the afternoon Lord Granville called on me\r\n    and brought me a confidential memorandum, containing an overture\r\n    which Mr. Disraeli had placed in the hands of Lord Bessborough for\r\n    communication to us. [Memorandum not recoverable.] He had\r\n    represented the terms as those which he had with much difficulty\r\n    induced Lord Cairns to consent to. While the contention as to the\r\n    residue was abandoned, and pecuniary concessions alone were\r\n    sought, the demand amounted, according to our computation, to\r\n    between £900,000 and £1,000,000.... This it was evident was\r\n    utterly inadmissible. I saw no possibility of approach to it; and\r\n    considered that a further quarter of a million or thereabouts was\r\n    all that the House of Commons could be expected or asked further\r\n    to concede. On the same afternoon Lord Granville, falling in with\r\n    Mr. Goschen, asked him what he thought the very most that could be\r\n    had—would it be £500,000? Goschen answered £300,000, and with this\r\n    Glyn agreed. Mr. Disraeli desired an answer before three on\r\n    Monday.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, July 19._—Those members of the government who had acted\r\n    as a sort of committee in the Irish church question met in the\r\n    afternoon. We were all agreed in opinion that the Disraeli\r\n    overture must be rejected, though without closing the door; and a\r\n    reply was prepared in this sense, which Lord Granville undertook\r\n    to send. [_Draft, in the above sense that no sum approaching\r\n    £1,000,000 could be entertained._]\r\n\r\n    Meantime the archbishop had arrived in Downing Street, in\r\n    pursuance of the arrangements of Saturday; and a paper was either\r\n    now drawn, or sanctioned by my colleagues, I do not remember\r\n    which, in order to form the basis of my communication to the\r\n    archbishop. I returned from my interview, and reported, as I\r\n    afterwards did to the Dean of Windsor, that his tone was friendly,\r\n    and that he appeared well disposed to the sort of arrangement I\r\n    had sketched.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, July 20._—The archbishop, who had communicated with Lord\r\n    Cairns in the interval, came to me early to-day and brought a\r\n    memorandum as a basis of agreement, which, to my surprise,\r\n    demanded higher terms than those of Mr. Disraeli.(182) I told the\r\n    archbishop the terms in which we had already expressed ourselves\r\n    to Mr. Disraeli.... Meantime an answer had come from Mr. Disraeli\r\n    stating that he could not do more. Then followed the meeting of\r\n    the opposition peers at the Duke of Marlborough’s.\r\n\r\n    On the meeting of the Houses, a few of us considered what course\r\n    was to be taken if the Lords should again cast out of the preamble\r\n    the words which precluded concurrent endowment; and it was agreed\r\n    to stay the proceedings for the time, and consider among ourselves\r\n    what further to do. [Lord Granville has a pencil note on the\r\n    margin, “The first order I received was to throw up the bill, to\r\n    which I answered that I could not do more than adjourn the\r\n    debate.”] Lord Granville made this announcement accordingly after\r\n    the Lords had, upon a hot debate and by a large majority, again\r\n    excluded our words from the preamble [173: 95]. This had been\r\n    after a speech from Lord Cairns, in which he announced his\r\n    intention of moving other amendments which he detailed, and which\r\n    were in general conformable to the proposals already made to us.\r\n    The first disposition of several of us this evening, myself\r\n    included, was to regard the proceeding of the opposition as now\r\n    complete; since the whole had been announced, the first stroke\r\n    struck, and the command shown of a force of peers amply sufficient\r\n    to do the rest.(183) ... The idea did not, however, include an\r\n    absolute abandonment of the bill, but only the suspension of our\r\n    responsibility for it, leaving the opposition to work their own\r\n    will, and with the intention, when this had been done, of\r\n    considering the matter further....\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, July 21._—The cabinet met at 11; and I went to it in\r\n    the mind of last night. We discussed, however, at great length all\r\n    possible methods of proceeding that occurred to us. The result was\r\n    stated in a letter of mine to the Queen, of which I annex a copy.\r\n    [_See __Appendix__. He enumerates the various courses considered,\r\n    and states that the course adopted was to go through the endowment\r\n    amendments, and if they were carried adversely, then to drop their\r\n    responsibility._]\r\n\r\n    Most of the cabinet were desirous to go on longer; others, myself\r\n    included, objected to proceeding to the end of the bill or\r\n    undertaking to remit the bill again to the House of Commons as of\r\n    our own motion. It occurred to me, however, that we might proceed\r\n    as far as to the end of the many amendments, about the middle of\r\n    the bill; and this appeared to meet the views of all, even of\r\n    those who would have preferred doing more, or less.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, July 22._—I was laid up to-day, and the transactions\r\n    were carried on by Lord Granville, in communication with me from\r\n    time to time at my house. First he brought me a note he had\r\n    received from Lord Cairns.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M84) This, dated July 22, was to the effect that Lord Cairns had no right\r\nand no desire to ask for any information as to the course proposed that\r\nnight; but that if the statements as to the intention of the government to\r\nproceed with the consideration of the amendments were correct, and if Lord\r\nGranville thought any advantage likely to result from it, Lord Cairns\r\nwould be ready, “as you know I have throughout been, to confer upon a mode\r\nby which without sacrifice of principle or dignity upon either side the\r\nremaining points of difference might be arranged.” The proceedings of this\r\ncritical day are narrated by Lord Granville in a memorandum to Mr.\r\nGladstone, dated August 4:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    After seeing you I met Lord Cairns at the colonial office. He\r\n    offered me terms.(184) ... I asked him whether, in his opinion,\r\n    he, the archbishop, and I could carry anything we agreed upon. He\r\n    said, “Yes, certainly.” After seeing you I met Lord Cairns a\r\n    second time in his room at the House of Lords. I asked as a\r\n    preliminary to giving any opinion on his amendments, how he\r\n    proposed to deal with the preamble. He said, “to leave it as\r\n    amended by the Lords.” I then proposed the words which were\r\n    afterwards adopted in the 68th clause. He was at first taken\r\n    aback, but admitted that he had personally no objection to them.\r\n    He asked what was the opposition to be feared. I suggested some\r\n    from Lord Grey. He believed this to be certain, but immaterial. I\r\n    objected _in toto_ to Lord Salisbury’s clause or its substitute.\r\n    He was unwilling to yield, chiefly on Lord Salisbury’s account,\r\n    but finally consented. We agreed upon the commutation clause if\r\n    the 7 and the 5 per cent. were lumped together. On the curates\r\n    clause we could come to no agreement. He proposed to see Lord\r\n    Salisbury and the archbishop, and to meet again at four at the\r\n    colonial office. He spoke with fairness as to the difficulty of\r\n    his position, and the risk he ran with his own party. I again saw\r\n    you and asked the Irish attorney-general to be present at the last\r\n    interview. I stated to him in Lord Cairns’s presence how far we\r\n    agreed, and expressed my regret that on the last point—the\r\n    curates—our difference was irreconcilable. Lord Cairns said he\r\n    hoped not, and proceeded to argue strongly in favour of his\r\n    proposal. He at last, however, at 4.30, compromised the matter by\r\n    accepting five years instead of one. I shook his hand, which was\r\n    trembling with nervousness. We discussed the form of announcing\r\n    the arrangement to the House. We at once agreed it was better to\r\n    tell the whole truth, and soon settled that it would be better for\r\n    its success that he should announce the details. I was afterwards\r\n    apprehensive that this latter arrangement might be disadvantageous\r\n    to us, but nothing could be better or fairer than his statement. I\r\n    cannot finish this statement, which I believe is accurate, without\r\n    expressing my admiration at the firmness and conciliation which\r\n    you displayed in directing me in all these negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The news was brought to me on my sofa,” Mr. Gladstone says, “and between\r\nfive and six I was enabled to telegraph to the Queen. My telegram was\r\nfollowed up by a letter at 7 P.M., which announced that the arrangement\r\nhad been accepted by the House of Lords, and that a general satisfaction\r\nprevailed.” To the Queen he wrote (July 22):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gladstone is at a loss to account for the great change in the\r\n    tone and views of the opposition since Sunday and Monday, and even\r\n    Tuesday last, but on this topic it is needless to enter. As to the\r\n    principal matters, the basis of the arrangement on the side of the\r\n    government is much the same as was intended when Mr. Gladstone had\r\n    the honour of an audience at Windsor on Saturday; but various\r\n    minor concessions have been added. Mr. Gladstone does not doubt\r\n    that, if the majority of the House of Lords should accede to the\r\n    advice of Lord Cairns, the government will be able to induce the\r\n    House of Commons to agree on the conditions proposed. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone would in vain strive to express to your Majesty the\r\n    relief, thankfulness, and satisfaction, with which he contemplates\r\n    not only the probable passing of what many believe to be a\r\n    beneficent and necessary measure, but the undoubted and signal\r\n    blessing of an escape from a formidable constitutional conflict.\r\n    The skill, patience, assiduity, and sagacity of Lord Granville in\r\n    the work of to-day demand from Mr. Gladstone the tribute of his\r\n    warm admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn reviewing this whole transaction, and doing full justice to the\r\nattitude both of the Queen and the archbishop, the reader will be inclined\r\nto agree with old Lord Halifax: “I think we owe a good turn to Cairns,\r\nwithout whose _decision_ on Thursday I hardly think that the settlement\r\ncould have been effected. Indeed Derby’s conduct proves what difficulty\r\nthere would have been, if Cairns had not taken upon himself the\r\nresponsibility of acting as he did.”\r\n\r\nAmong interesting letters was one from Manning (July 24): “My joy over the\r\nevent is not only as a catholic, though that must be, as it ought to be,\r\nmy highest motive, but as an Englishman to whom, as I remember your once\r\nsaying, the old English monarchy is dear next after the catholic church.\r\nBut at this time I will only add that I may wish you joy on personal\r\nreasons. I could hardly have hoped that you could so have framed,\r\nmastered, and carried through the bill from first to last so complete, so\r\nunchanged in identity of principle and detail, and let me add with such\r\nunwearying and sustained self-control and forbearance.”\r\n\r\nThe diary gives us a further glimpse of these agitating days:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 20._—Conclave of colleagues on Irish church proceedings. An\r\n    anxious day, a sad evening. 21.—Cabinet 11-2-1/4, stiff, but good.\r\n    22.—I was obliged to take to my sofa and spent the day so in\r\n    continual interviews with Granville, Glyn, West,\r\n    Sullivan—especially the first—on the details and particulars of\r\n    the negotiations respecting the Irish Church bill. The favourable\r\n    issue left me almost unmanned in the reaction from a sharp and\r\n    stern tension of mind. 23.—My attack did not lessen. Dr. Clark\r\n    came in the morning and made me up for the House, whither I went\r\n    2-5 P.M., to propose concurrence in the Lords’ amendments. Up to\r\n    the moment I felt very weak, but this all vanished when I spoke\r\n    and while the debate lasted. Then I went back to bed. 25.—Weak\r\n    still. I presumed over much in walking a little and fell back at\r\n    night to my lowest point.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Robert Phillimore records:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 21._—Found Gladstone at breakfast, calm, pale, but without a\r\n    doubt as to the course which the government must pursue, viz.: to\r\n    maintain upon every important point the bill as sent back by the\r\n    Commons, probably an autumn session, a bill sternly repeated by\r\n    the Commons, too probably without the clauses favourable to the\r\n    Irish church. 23.—Nothing talked or written of but the political\r\n    marvel of yesterday. Gladstone in a speech universally praised\r\n    proposed to the House of Commons the bill as now modified, and it\r\n    passed with much harmony, broken by an Orange member. Gladstone\r\n    very unwell, and ought to have been in bed when he made his\r\n    speech. 24.—Gladstone still very weak but in a state of calm\r\n    happiness at the unexpected turn which the Irish bill had taken.\r\n    Does not now know the origin or history of the sudden resolution\r\n    on the part of the leaders of the opposition. I am satisfied that\r\n    Disraeli was alarmed and thoroughly frightened at the state of the\r\n    House of Commons and the country, that Cairns was determined to\r\n    regain what he had practically lost or was losing, the leadership\r\n    of the Lords, and that many of his party were frightened at the\r\n    madness and folly of Tuesday night considered after a day’s\r\n    reflection.... Above all there was a well-grounded alarm on the\r\n    part of Cairns and his immediate supporters in the Lords, that\r\n    their order was in imminent danger. Bluster disappeared, and a\r\n    retreat, as decent as well could be expected, was made from a\r\n    situation known to be untenable. They had never expected that\r\n    Gladstone would drop the bill. 25.—Much conversation with\r\n    Gladstone, who is still very weak. He wrote to the Archbishop of\r\n    Dublin to say in effect, that as a private churchman he would be\r\n    glad to assist in any way the archbishop could point out in the\r\n    organising of the voluntary church in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Acland writes, August 3, 1869:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I stayed at House of Commons perforce till about 1.30 or 2, and\r\n    then walked away with Gladstone through the Park. It is beautiful\r\n    to see his intense enjoyment of the cool fresh air, the trees, the\r\n    sky, the gleaming of light on the water, all that is refreshing in\r\n    contrast to the din of politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nA month later the Archbishop of Canterbury found Mr. Gladstone at Lord\r\nGranville’s at Walmer Castle:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Reached Walmer Castle about 6.30. Found Gladstone lying in\r\n    blankets on the ramparts eating his dinner, looking still very\r\n    ill.... He joined us at night full of intelligence. His fierce\r\n    vigour all the better for being a little tempered.... Much\r\n    interesting conversation about the state of the church and\r\n    morality in Wales, also about leading ecclesiastics. I gather that\r\n    he will certainly nominate Temple for a bishopric.(185)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. First Chapter Of An Agrarian Revolution. (1870)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Irish Land Act of 1870 in its consequences was certainly one\r\n    of the most important measures of the nineteenth century.—LECKY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1870 one of Mr. Gladstone’s colleagues wrote of him to\r\nanother, “I fear that he is steering straight upon the rocks.” So it might\r\nwell seem to any who knew the unplumbed depths on which he had to shape\r\nhis voyage. Irish history has been said to resemble that of Spain for the\r\nlast three centuries,—the elaboration of all those ideas of law and\r\npolitical economy most unsuited to the needs of the nation concerned. Such\r\nideas, deeply cherished in Britain where they had succeeded, Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas now gradually drawn forward to reverse and overthrow in Ireland where\r\nthey had ended in monstrous failure. Here a pilot’s eye might well see\r\njagged reefs. The occasion was the measure for dealing with the land of\r\nIreland, that he had promised at the election. The difficulty arose from\r\nthe huge and bottomless ignorance of those in whose hands the power lay.\r\nMr. Gladstone in the course of these discussions said, and said truly, of\r\nthe learned Sir Roundell Palmer, that he knew no more of land tenures in\r\nIreland than he knew of land tenures in the moon. At the beginning much\r\nthe same might have been observed of the cabinet, of the two houses of\r\nparliament, and of the whole mass of British electors. No doubt one effect\r\nof this great ignorance was to make Mr. Gladstone dictator. Still\r\nignorance left all the more power to prejudice and interests. We may\r\nimagine the task. The cabinet was in the main made up of landlords,\r\nlawyers, hardened and convicted economists,—not economists like Mill, but\r\nmen saturated with English ideas of contract, of competitive rent, of\r\nstrict rule of supply and demand. Mr. Bright, it is true, had a profound\r\nconviction that the root of Irish misery and disorder lay in the land\r\nquestion. Here he saw far and deep. But then Mr. Bright had made up his\r\nmind that the proper solution of the land question was the gradual\r\ntransformation of the tenants into owners, and this strong preconception\r\nsomewhat narrowed his vision. Even while Mr. Gladstone was in the middle\r\nof his battle on the church, Bright wrote to him (May 21, ’69):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the Irish church question is out of the way, we shall find\r\n    all Ireland, north and south alike, united in demanding something\r\n    on the land question much broader than anything hitherto offered\r\n    or proposed in compensation bills. If the question is to go on\r\n    without any real remedy for the grievance, the condition of\r\n    Ireland in this particular will become worse, and measures far\r\n    beyond anything I now contemplate will be necessary. I am most\r\n    anxious to meet the evil before it is too great for control, and\r\n    my plan _will meet_ it without wrong to any man.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M85) “I have studied the Irish land question,” said Bright, “from a point\r\nof view almost inaccessible to the rest of your colleagues, and from which\r\npossibly even you have not had the opportunity of regarding it.... I hope\r\nyou are being refreshed, as I am, after the long nights in the House—long\r\nnights which happily were not fruitless. I only hope our masters in the\r\nother House will not undo what we have done.” Mr. Gladstone replied the\r\nnext day, opening with a sentence that, if addressed to any one less\r\nrevered than Bright, might have seemed to veil a sarcasm: “I have this\r\nadvantage for learning the Irish land question, that I do not set out with\r\nthe belief that I know it already; and certainly no effort that I can make\r\nto acquire the mastery of it will be wanting.” He then proceeds to express\r\nhis doubts as to the government embarking on a very large operation of\r\nland-jobbing, buying up estates from landlords and reselling them to\r\ntenants; and whether the property bought and sold again by the state would\r\nnot by force of economic laws gradually return again to fewer hands. He\r\nthen comes still closer to the pith of the matter when he says to Mr.\r\nBright: “Your plan, if adopted in full, could only extend, to a small\r\nproportion of the two or three hundred millions worth of land in Ireland;\r\nand I do not well see how the unprotected tenants of the land in general\r\nwould take essential benefit from the purchase and owning of land by a few\r\nof their fortunate brethren.” If the land question was urgent, and Bright\r\nhimself, like Mill, thought that it was, this answer of Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nwas irrefragable. In acknowledging the despatch of this correspondence\r\nfrom Mr. Gladstone, Lord Granville says to him (May 26, 1869):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    This question may break us up. Bright is thin-skinned; the attacks\r\n    in the Lords ruffle him more than he chooses to admit. I cannot\r\n    make out how far he likes office, the cabinet, and his new\r\n    position. It will be particularly disagreeable to him to have this\r\n    plan, of which he is so much enamoured and for which he has\r\n    received so much blame and a little praise, snuffed out by the\r\n    cabinet. And yet how is it possible to avoid it, even putting\r\n    aside the strong opinions of Lowe, Cardwell, and others? My only\r\n    hope is that you have got the germ of some larger and more\r\n    comprehensive plan in your head, than has yet been developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan ultimately adopted, after a severe struggle and with momentous\r\nconsequences, did not first spring from Mr. Gladstone’s brain. The idea of\r\nadapting the law to custom in all its depth and breadth, and extending the\r\nrooted notion of tenant-right to its furthest bearings, was necessarily a\r\nplant of Irish and not of English growth. Mr. Chichester Fortescue, the\r\nIrish chief secretary and an Irishman, first opened a bold expansion of\r\nthe familiar principle of many tenant-right bills. He had introduced such\r\na bill himself in 1866, and the conservative government had brought in\r\nanother in 1867. It is believed that he was instigated to adopt the new\r\nand bolder line by Sir Edward Sullivan, then the Irish attorney-general.\r\nAway from Sullivan, it was observed, he had little to say of value about\r\nhis plan. In the cabinet Fortescue was not found effective, but he was\r\nthoroughly at home in the subject, and his speeches in public on Irish\r\nbusiness had all the cogency of a man speaking his native tongue, and even\r\ngenius in an acquired language is less telling. What is astonishing is the\r\nmagic of the rapid and sympathetic penetration with which Mr. Gladstone\r\nwent to the heart of the problem, as it was presented to him by his Irish\r\nadvisers. This was his way. When acts of policy were not of great or\r\nimmediate concern, he took them as they came; but when they pressed for\r\ntreatment and determination, then he swooped down upon them with the\r\nstrength and vision of an eagle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nHis career in the most deeply operative portion of it was so intimately\r\nconcerned with Ireland, that my readers will perhaps benignantly permit a\r\npage or two of historic digression. I know the subject seems uninviting.\r\nMy apology must be that it occupied no insignificant portion of Mr.\r\nGladstone’s public life, and that his treatment of it made one of his\r\ndeepest marks on the legislation of the century. After all, there is no\r\nEnglish-speaking community in any part of the wide globe, where our tragic\r\nmismanagement of the land of Ireland, and of those dwelling on it and\r\nsustained by it, has not left its unlucky stamp.\r\n\r\n(M86) If Englishmen and Scots had not found the theme so uninviting, if\r\nthey had given a fraction of the attention to the tenure and history of\r\nIrish land, that was bestowed, say, upon the Seisachtheia of Solon at\r\nAthens, or the Sempronian law in ancient Rome, this chapter in our annals\r\nwould not have been written. As it was, parliament had made laws for\r\nlandlord and tenant in Ireland without well understanding what is either\r\nan Irish landlord or an Irish tenant. England has been able to rule India,\r\nMill said, because the business of ruling devolved upon men who passed\r\ntheir lives in India, and made Indian interests their regular occupation.\r\nIndia has on the whole been governed with a pretty full perception of its\r\ndifferences from England. Ireland on the contrary, suffering a worse\r\nmisfortune than absentee landlords, was governed by an absentee\r\nparliament. In England, property means the rights of the rent-receiver who\r\nhas equipped the land and prepared it for the capital and the skill of the\r\ntenant. In Ireland, in the minds of the vast majority of the population,\r\nfor reasons just as good, property includes rights of the cultivator,\r\nwhose labour has drained the land, and reclaimed it, and fenced it, and\r\nmade farm-roads, and put a dwelling and farm buildings on it, and given to\r\nit all the working value that it possesses. We need suppose no criminality\r\non either side. The origin of the difference was perfectly natural. In\r\nIreland the holdings were small and multitudinous; no landlord who was not\r\na millionaire, could have prepared and equipped holdings numbered by\r\nhundreds or thousands; and if he could, the hundreds and thousands of\r\ntenants had not a straw of capital. This peculiarity in social\r\ncircumstances made it certain, therefore, that if the moral foundation of\r\nmodern ideas of property is that he who sows shall reap, the idea of\r\nproperty would grow up in the mind of the cultivator, whenever the outer\r\nclimate permitted the growth in his mind of any ideas of moral or\r\nequitable right at all.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 the Devon Commission had reported that it is the tenant who has\r\nmade the improvements; that large confiscations of these improvements had\r\nbeen systematically practised in the shape of progressive enhancements of\r\nrent; that crime and disorder sprang from the system; and that parliament\r\nought to interfere. A bill was proposed by the Peel government in 1845 for\r\nprotecting the rightful interests of the tenant against the landlord. It\r\nwas introduced in the House mainly composed of landlords. There it had\r\nsuch contumelious greeting, that it was speedily dropped. This was a\r\ncrowning illustration of the levity of the imperial parliament dealing\r\nwith Irish problems. The vital necessity for readjusting the foundations\r\nof social life demonstrated; a half measure languidly attempted; attempt\r\ndropped; bills sent to slumber in limbo; dry rot left quietly alone for a\r\nwhole generation, until bloody outrage and murder awoke legislative\r\nconscience or roused executive fear. The union was seventy years old\r\nbefore the elementary feature in the agrarian condition of Ireland was\r\nrecognised by the parliament which had undertaken to govern Ireland.\r\nBefore the union Ireland was governed by the British cabinet, through the\r\nIrish landed gentry, according to their views, and in their interests.\r\nAfter the union it was just the same. She was treated as a turbulent and\r\ninfected province within the larger island; never as a community with an\r\ninternal economy peculiarly her own, with special sentiments, history,\r\nrecollections, points of view, and necessities all her own. Between the\r\nunion and the year 1870, Acts dealing with Irish land had been passed at\r\nWestminster. Every one of these Acts was in the interest of the landlord\r\nand against the tenant. A score of Insurrection Acts, no Tenant-right Act.\r\nMeanwhile Ireland had gone down into the dark gulfs of the Famine\r\n(1846-7).\r\n\r\nAnybody can now see that the true view of the Irish cultivator was to\r\nregard him as a kind of copyholder or customary freeholder, or whatever\r\nother name best fits a man who has possessory interests in a piece of\r\nland, held at the landlord’s will, but that will controlled by custom. In\r\nUlster, and in an embryo degree elsewhere, this was what in a varying and\r\nirregular way actually had come about. Agrarian customs developed that\r\nundoubtedly belong to a backward social system, but they sprang from the\r\nnecessities of the case. The essence of such customs in Ulster was first,\r\na fair rent to be fixed not by competition, but by valuation, and\r\nexclusive of tenant’s improvements; second, the right of the tenant to\r\ntransfer to somebody else his goodwill, or whatever else we may call his\r\nright of occupancy in the holding.\r\n\r\nInstead of adapting law to custom, habit, practice, and equity, parliament\r\nproceeded to break all this down. With well-meaning but blind violence it\r\nimported into Ireland after the famine the English idea of landed property\r\nand contract. Or rather, it imported these ideas into Ireland with a\r\ndefiniteness and formality that would have been impracticable even in\r\nEngland. Just as good people thought they could easily make Ireland\r\nprotestant if only she could be got within earshot of evangelical truth,\r\nso statesmen expected that a few clauses on a parchment would suffice to\r\nroot out at a stroke the inveterate habits and ideas of long generations.\r\nWe talk of revolutionary doctrinaires in France and other countries.\r\nHistory hardly shows such revolutionary doctrinaires anywhere as the whig\r\nand tory statesmen who tried to regenerate Ireland in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century. They first of all passed an Act (1849) inviting the\r\npurchase of the estates of an insolvent landlord upon precisely the same\r\nprinciples as governed the purchase of his pictures or his furniture. We\r\npassed the Encumbered Estates Act, Mr. Gladstone said, “with lazy,\r\nheedless, uninformed good intentions.” The important rights given by\r\ncustom and equity to the cultivator were suddenly extinguished by the\r\nsupreme legal right of the rent-receiver. About one-eighth of the whole\r\narea of the country is estimated to have changed hands on these terms. The\r\nextreme of wretchedness and confusion naturally followed. Parliament\r\nthought this must be due to some misunderstanding. That there might be no\r\nfurther mistake, it next proceeded formally to declare (1860) that the\r\nlegal relations between landlord and tenant in Ireland were to be those of\r\nstrict contract.(186) Thus blunder was clenched by blunder. The\r\ncultivators were terror-struck, and agitation waxed hot.\r\n\r\nOliver Cromwell had a glimpse of the secret in 1649. “These poor people,”\r\nhe said, “have been accustomed to as much injustice and oppression from\r\ntheir landlords, the great men, and those who should have done them right,\r\nas any people in that which we call Christendom. Sir, if justice were\r\nfreely and impartially administered here, the foregoing darkness and\r\ncorruption would make it look so much the more glorious and beautiful.” It\r\nwas just two hundred and twenty years before another ruler of England saw\r\nas deep, and applied his mind to the free doing of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after recovering from the fatigues of the session of\r\n1869, Mr. Gladstone threw himself upon his new task, his imagination\r\nvividly excited by its magnitude and its possibilities. “For the last\r\nthree months,” he writes to the Duke of Argyll (Dec. 5), “I have worked\r\ndaily, I think, upon the question, and so I shall continue to do. The\r\nliterature of it is large, larger than I can master; but I feel the\r\nbenefit of continued reading upon it. We have before us a crisis, and a\r\ngreat crisis, for us all, to put it on no higher ground, and a great\r\nhonour or a great disgrace. As I do not mean to fail through want of\r\nperseverance, so neither will I wilfully err through precipitancy, or\r\nthrough want of care and desire at least to meet all apprehensions which\r\nare warranted by even the show of reason.”\r\n\r\nIt was not reading alone that brought him round to the full measure of\r\nsecuring the cultivator in his holding. The crucial suggestion, the\r\nexpediency, namely, of making the landlord pay compensation to the tenant\r\nfor disturbing him, came from Ireland. To Mr. Chichester Fortescue, the\r\nIrish secretary, Mr. Gladstone writes (Sept. 15):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I heartily wish, it were possible that you, Sullivan, and I could\r\n    have some of those preliminary conversations on land, which were\r\n    certainly of great use in the first stages of the Irish Church\r\n    bill. As this is difficult, let us try to compare notes as well as\r\n    we can in writing. I anticipate that many members of the cabinet\r\n    will find it hard to extend their views to what the exigencies of\r\n    the time, soberly considered, now require; but patience, prudence,\r\n    and good feeling will, I hope, surmount all obstacles.\r\n\r\n    Like you, I am unwilling to force a peasant proprietary into\r\n    existence.... The first point in this legislation, viz., that the\r\n    presumption of law should give improvements to the tenant, is now,\r\n    I suppose, very widely admitted, but no longer suffices to settle\r\n    the question.... Now as to your “compensation for disturbance.”\r\n    This is indeed a question full of difficulty. It is very desirable\r\n    to prevent the using of augmentation of rent as a method of\r\n    eviction. I shall be most curious to see the means and provisions\r\n    you may devise, without at present being too sanguine.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M87) Meanwhile he notes to Lord Granville (Sept. 22) how critical and\r\narduous the question is, within as well as without the cabinet, and\r\nwonders whether they ought not to be thinking of a judicious cabinet\r\ncommittee:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The question fills the public mind in an extraordinary degree, and\r\n    we can hardly avoid some early step towards making progress in it.\r\n    A committee keeps a cabinet quiet. It is highly necessary that we\r\n    should be quite ready when parliament meets, and yet there is so\r\n    much mental movement upon the question from day to day, as we see\r\n    from a variety of curious utterances (that of the _Times_\r\n    included), that it is desirable to keep final decisions open. Much\r\n    information will be open, and this a committee can prepare in\r\n    concert with the Irish government. It also, I think, affords a\r\n    means of bringing men’s minds together.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe tells the Irish secretary that so far as he can enter into the\r\nsecretary’s views, he “enters thoroughly into the spirit of them.” But\r\nmany members of the cabinet, laden sufficiently with their own labours,\r\nhad probably not so closely followed up the matter:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The proposition, that _more_ than compensation to tenants for\r\n    their improvements will be necessary in order to settle the Irish\r\n    land laws, will be unpalatable, or new, to several, and naturally\r\n    enough. You will have observed the total difference in the\r\n    internal situation between this case and that of the Irish church,\r\n    where upon all the greater points our measure was in a manner\r\n    outlined for us by the course of previous transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of October the question was brought formally before the\r\ncabinet:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 30._—Cabinet, 2-5-½.... We broke ground very satisfactorily\r\n    on the question of Irish land. _Nov. 3._—Cabinet. Chiefly on Irish\r\n    land, and stiff. 9.—To Guildhall, where I spoke for the\r\n    government. The combination of physical effort with measured words\r\n    is difficult. 22.—Worked six hours on my books, arranging and\r\n    re-arranging. The best brain rest I have had, I think, since\r\n    December last.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brain rest was not for long. On Dec. 1 he tells Lord Granville that\r\nArgyll is busy on Irish land, and in his views is misled by “the rapid\r\nfacility of his active mind.” “It is rather awkward at this stage to talk\r\nof breaking up the government, and that is more easily said than done.” I\r\nknow no more singular reading in its way than the correspondence between\r\nMr. Gladstone and the Duke of Argyll; Mr. Gladstone trying to lead his\r\nargumentative colleague over one or two of the barest rudiments of the\r\nhistory of Irish land, and occasionally showing in the process somewhat of\r\nthe quality of the superior pupil teacher acquiring to-day material for\r\nthe lesson of to-morrow. Mr. Gladstone goes to the root of the matter when\r\nhe says to the Duke: “What I would most earnestly entreat of you is not to\r\nrely too much on Highland experience, but to acquaint yourself by careful\r\nreading with the rather extensive facts and history of the Irish land\r\nquestion. My own studies in it are very imperfect, though pursued to the\r\nbest of my ability; but they have revealed to me many matters of fact\r\nwhich have seriously modified my views, most of them connected with and\r\nbranching out of the very wide extension of the idea and even the practice\r\nof tenant right, mostly perhaps _un_recognised beyond the limits of the\r\nUlster custom.”\r\n\r\nThen Lord Granville writes to him that Clarendon has sent him two letters\r\nrunning, talking of the certainty of the government being broken up. “The\r\nsky is very far from clear,” Mr. Gladstone says to Mr. Fortescue (Dec. 3),\r\n“but we must bate no jot of heart or hope.” The next day it is Mr. Bright\r\nto whom he turns in friendly earnest admonition. His words will perhaps be\r\nuseful to many generations of cabinet ministers:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is not the courageous part of your paper to which I now object,\r\n    though I doubt the policy of the reference to feebleness and\r\n    timidity, as men in a cabinet do not like what may _seem_ to imply\r\n    that they are cowards. It is your argument (a very over-strained\r\n    one in my opinion) against Fortescue’s propositions, and your\r\n    proposal (so it reads) to put them back in order of discussion to\r\n    the second place _now_, when the mind of the cabinet has been upon\r\n    them for six weeks.... Had the cabinet adopted at this moment _a\r\n    good and sufficient scheme for dealing with the Irish tenants as\r\n    tenants_, I should care little how much you depreciated such a\r\n    scheme in comparison with one for converting them into owners. But\r\n    the state of things is most critical. This is not a time at which\r\n    those who in substance agree, can afford to throw away strength by\r\n    the _relative_ depreciation of those parts of a plan of relief, to\r\n    which they do not themselves give the first place in importance.\r\n    It is most dangerous to discredit _propositions which you mean to\r\n    adopt_, in the face of any who (as yet) do not mean to adopt them,\r\n    and who may consistently and honourably use all your statements\r\n    against them, nay, who would really be bound to do so. No part of\r\n    what I have said is an argument against your propositions.... If\r\n    your seven propositions were law to-day, you would have made but a\r\n    very small progress towards settling the land question of Ireland.\r\n    For all this very plain speech, you will, I am sure, forgive me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA letter from Mr. Gladstone to Fortescue (Dec. 5) shows the competition\r\nbetween Bright’s projects of purchase by state-aid, and the scheme for\r\ndealing with the tenants as tenants:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am a good deal staggered at the idea of any interference with\r\n    present rents. But I shall not speak on this subject to others. It\r\n    will be difficult enough to carry the substance of the plan you\r\n    proposed, without any enlargement of it. I hope to see you again\r\n    before the question comes on in the cabinet.... Bright is very\r\n    full of waste lands, and generally of his own plans, considerably\r\n    (at present) to the detriment of yours. He wants the government to\r\n    buy waste lands, and says it is not against political economy, but\r\n    yours is. I think he will come right. It appears to me we might in\r\n    the case of waste lands lend money (on proper conditions) to _any\r\n    buyers_; in the case of other lands we are only to lend to\r\n    occupiers. What do you think of this?\r\n\r\n\r\n(M88) At this date he was still in doubt whether anybody would agree to\r\ninterference with existing rents, but he had for himself hit upon the\r\nprinciple that became the foundation of his law. He put to Fortescue (Dec.\r\n9) as a material point:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whether it is expedient to adopt, wherever it can be made\r\n    available, _the custom of the country as the basis for\r\n    compensation on eviction and the like_. I cannot make out from\r\n    your papers whether you wholly dissent from this. I hoped you had\r\n    agreed in it. I have acquired a strong conviction upon it, of\r\n    which I have written out the grounds; but I shall not circulate\r\n    the paper till I understand your views more fully.\r\n\r\n\r\nLowe, at the other extremity, describes himself as more and more\r\n“oppressed by a feeling of heavy responsibility and an apprehension of\r\nserious danger,” and feeling that he and the minority (Clarendon, Argyll,\r\nand Cardwell—of whom he was much the best hand at an argument)—were being\r\ndriven to choose between their gravest convictions, and their allegiance\r\nto party and cabinet. They agreed to the presumption of law as to the\r\nmaking of improvements; to compensation for improvements, retrospective\r\nand prospective; to the right of new tenants at will to compensation on\r\neviction. The straw that broke the camel’s back was compensation for\r\neviction, where no custom could be proved in the case of an existing\r\ntenancy. Mr. Gladstone wrote a long argumentative letter to Lord Granville\r\nto be shown to Lowe, and it was effectual. Lowe thought the tone of it\r\nvery fair and the arguments of the right sort, but nevertheless he added,\r\nin the words I have already quoted, “I fear he is steering straight upon\r\nthe rocks.”\r\n\r\nWhat might surprise us, if anything in Irish doings could surprise us, is\r\nthat though this was a measure for Irish tenants, it was deemed heinously\r\nwrong to ascertain directly from their representatives what the Irish\r\ntenants thought. Lord Bessborough was much rebuked in London for\r\nencouraging Mr. Gladstone to communicate with Sir John Gray, the owner of\r\nthe great newspaper of the Irish tenant class. Yet Lord O’Hagan, the\r\nchancellor, who had the rather relevant advantage of being of the same\r\nstock and faith as three-fourths of the nation concerned, told them that\r\n“the success or failure of the Land bill depends on the _Freeman’s\r\nJournal_; if it says, We accept this as a fixity of tenure, every priest\r\nwill say the same, and _vice versâ_.” It was, however, almost a point of\r\nhonour in those days for British cabinets to make Irish laws out of their\r\nown heads.\r\n\r\n(M89) Almost to the last the critical contest in the cabinet went on.\r\nFortescue fought as well as he could even against the prime minister\r\nhimself, as the following from Mr. Gladstone to him shows (Jan. 12):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    There can surely be no advantage in further argument between you\r\n    and me at this stage—especially after so many hours and pages of\r\n    it—on the recognition of usage beyond the limit of Ulster custom\r\n    as a distinct head. You pressed your view repeatedly on the\r\n    cabinet, which did not adopt it. Till the cabinet alters its mind,\r\n    we have no option except to use every effort to get the bill drawn\r\n    according to its instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much he had his Irish plans at heart, Mr. Gladstone showed by his\r\nurgency that the Queen should open parliament. His letter to her (Jan. 15)\r\non the subject, he told Lord Granville, “expresses my desire, not founded\r\non ordinary motives, nor having reference to ordinary circumstances”:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have now to deal with the _gros_ of the Irish question, and the\r\n    Irish question is in a category by itself. It would be almost a\r\n    crime in a minister to omit anything that might serve to mark, and\r\n    bring home to the minds of men, the gravity of the occasion.\r\n    Moreover, I am persuaded that the Queen’s own sympathies would be,\r\n    not as last year, but in the same current as ours. To this great\r\n    country the state of Ireland after seven hundred years of our\r\n    tutelage is in my opinion so long as it continues, an intolerable\r\n    disgrace, and a danger so absolutely transcending all others, that\r\n    I call it the only real danger of the noble empire of the Queen. I\r\n    cannot refrain from bringing before her in one shape or another my\r\n    humble advice that she should, if _able_, open parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic opinion was ripening. The _Times_ made a contribution of the first\r\nimportance to the discussion, in a series of letters from a correspondent,\r\nthat almost for the first time brought the facts of Irish land before the\r\ngeneral public. A pamphlet from Mill, then at the height of his influence\r\nupon both writers and readers, startled them by the daring proposition\r\nthat the only plan was to buy out the landlords. The whole host of whig\r\neconomists and lawyers fell heavily upon him in consequence. The new\r\nvoters showed that they were not afraid of new ideas. It was not until\r\nJan. 25 that peril was at an end inside the government:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 25, ’70._—Cabinet. The great difficulties of the Irish Land\r\n    bill _there_ are now over. Thank God! _Feb. 7._—With the Prince of\r\n    Wales 3-1/4-4-1/4 explaining to him the Land bill, and on other\r\n    matters. He has certainly much natural intelligence. 15.—H. of C.\r\n    Introduced the Irish Land bill in a speech of 3-1/4 hours. Well\r\n    received by the House at large. _Query_, the Irish popular party?\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Dufferin, an Irish landlord, watching, as he admits, with\r\nconsiderable jealousy exceptional legislation in respect to Ireland, heard\r\nthe speech from the peers’ gallery, and wrote to Mr. Gladstone the next\r\nday: “I feel there is no one else in the country who could have\r\nrecommended the provisions of such a bill to the House of Commons, with a\r\nslighter shock to the prejudices of the class whose interests are chiefly\r\nconcerned.” He adds: “I happened to find myself next to Lord Cairns. When\r\nyou had done, he told me he did not think his people would oppose any of\r\nthe leading principles of your bill.”\r\n\r\nThe policy of the bill as tersely explained by Mr. Gladstone in a letter\r\nto Manning, compressing as he said eight or ten columns of the _Times_,\r\nwas “to prevent the landlord from using the terrible weapon of undue and\r\nunjust eviction, by so framing the handle that it shall cut his hands with\r\nthe sharp edge of pecuniary damages. The man evicted without any fault,\r\nand suffering the usual loss by it, will receive whatever the custom of\r\nthe country gives, and where there is no custom, according to a scale,\r\nbesides whatever he can claim for permanent buildings or reclamation of\r\nland. Wanton eviction will, as I hope, be extinguished by provisions like\r\nthese. And if they extinguish wanton eviction, they will also extinguish\r\nthose demands for _unjust_ augmentations of rent, which are only\r\nformidable to the occupier, because the power of wanton or arbitrary\r\neviction is behind them.” What seems so simple, and what was so necessary,\r\nmarked in truth a vast revolutionary stride. It transferred to the tenant\r\na portion of the absolute ownership, and gave him something like an estate\r\nin his holding. The statute contained a whole code of minor provisions,\r\nincluding the extension of Mr. Bright’s clauses for peasant proprietorship\r\nin the Church Act, but this transfer was what gave the Act its place in\r\nsolid legal form.\r\n\r\n(M90) The second reading was carried by 442 to 11, the minority being\r\ncomposed of eight Irish members of advanced type, and three English\r\ntories, including Mr. Henley and Mr. James Lowther, himself Irish\r\nsecretary eight years later. The bill was at no point fought high by the\r\nopposition. Mr. Disraeli moved an amendment limiting compensation to\r\nunexhausted improvements. The government majority fell to 76, “a result to\r\nbe expected,” Mr. Gladstone reports, “considering the natural leanings of\r\nEnglish and Scotch members to discount in Ireland what they would not\r\napply in Great Britain. They are not very familiar with Irish land\r\ntenures.” One fact of much significance he notes in these historic\r\nproceedings. Disraeli, he writes to the Duke of Argyll (April 21, 1870),\r\n“has not spoken one word against valuation of rents or perpetuity of\r\ntenure.” It was from the house of his friends that danger came:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 4._—H. of C. Spoke on Disraeli’s amendment. A majority of\r\n    76, but the navigation is at present extremely critical. 7.—H. of\r\n    C. A most ominous day from end to end. Early in the evening I gave\r\n    a review of the state of the bill, and later another menace of\r\n    overturn if the motion of Mr. William Fowler [a liberal banker],\r\n    which Palmer had unfortunately (as is too common with him) brought\r\n    into importance, should be carried. We had a majority of only 32.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Lord Russell he writes (April 12):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am in the hurry-scurry of preparation for a run into the country\r\n    this evening, but I must not omit to thank you for your very kind\r\n    and welcome letter. We have had a most anxious time in regard to\r\n    the Irish Land bill.... The fear that our Land bill may cross the\r\n    water creates a sensitive state of mind among all tories, many\r\n    whigs, and a few radicals. Upon this state of things comes Palmer\r\n    with his legal mind, legal point of view, legal aptitude and\r\n    inaptitude (_vide_ Mr. Burke), and stirs these susceptibilities to\r\n    such a point that he is always near bringing us to grief. Even\r\n    Grey more or less goes with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhillimore records a visit in these critical days:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 8._—Gladstone looked worn and fagged. Very affectionate and\r\n    confidential. Annoyed at Palmer’s conduct. Gladstone feels keenly\r\n    the want of support in debate. Bright ill. Lowe no moral weight.\r\n    “I feel when I have spoken, that I have not a shot in my locker.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a very accomplished journalist of the day wrote, there was something\r\nalmost painful in the strange phenomenon of a prime minister fighting as\r\nit were all but single-handed the details of his own great measure through\r\nthe ambuscades and charges of a numerous and restless enemy—and of an\r\nenemy determined apparently to fritter away the principle of the measure\r\nunder the pretence of modifying its details. “No prime minister has ever\r\nattempted any task like it—a task involving the most elaborate\r\ndepartmental readiness, in addition to the general duties and fatigues of\r\na prime minister, and that too in a session when questions are showered\r\nlike hail upon the treasury bench.”(187)\r\n\r\nThen the government put on pressure, and the majority sprang up to 80. The\r\ndebate in the Commons lasted over three and a half months, or about a\r\nfortnight longer than had been taken by the Church bill. The third reading\r\nwas carried without a division. In the Lords the bill was read a second\r\ntime without a division. Few persons “clearly foresaw that it was the\r\nfirst step of a vast transfer of property, and that in a few years it\r\nwould become customary for ministers of the crown to base all their\r\nlegislation on the doctrine that Irish land is not an undivided ownership,\r\nbut a simple partnership.”(188)\r\n\r\nIn March Mr. Gladstone had received from Manning a memorandum of ill omen\r\nfrom the Irish bishops, setting out the amendments by them thought\r\nnecessary. This paper included the principles of perpetuity of tenure for\r\nthe tiller of the soil and the adjustment of rent by a court. The reader\r\nmay judge for himself how impossible it would have been, even for Mr.\r\nGladstone, in all the plenitude of his power, to persuade either cabinet\r\nor parliament to adopt such invasions of prevailing doctrine. For this,\r\nten years more of agitation were required, and then he was able to\r\ncomplete the memorable chapter in Irish history that he had now opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M91) Neither the Land Act nor the Church Act at once put out the hot\r\nashes of Fenianism. A Coercion Act was passed in the spring of 1870. In\r\nthe autumn Mr. Gladstone tried to persuade the cabinet to approve the\r\nrelease of the Fenian prisoners, but it was not until the end of the year\r\nthat he prevailed. A secret committee was thought necessary in 1871 to\r\nconsider outrages in Westmeath, and a repressive law was passed in\r\nconsequence. Mr. Gladstone himself always leaned strongly against these\r\nexceptional laws, and pressed the Irish government hard the other way.\r\n“What we have to do,” he said, “is to defy Fenianism, to rely on public\r\nsentiment, and so provide (as we have been doing) the practical measures\r\nthat place the public sentiment on our side, an operation which I think is\r\nretarded by any semblance of _severity_ to those whose offence we admit\r\namong ourselves to have been an ultimate result of our misgovernment of\r\nthe country. I am afraid that local opinion has exercised, habitually and\r\ntraditionally, too much influence in Ireland, and has greatly compromised\r\nthe character of the empire. _This_ question I take to be in most of its\r\naspects an imperial question.” The proposal for a secret committee was the\r\noccasion of a duel between him and Disraeli (Feb. 27, 1871)—“both,” said\r\nLord Granville, “very able, but very bitter.” The tory leader taunted Mr.\r\nGladstone for having recourse to such a proceeding, after posing as the\r\nonly man capable of dealing with the evils of Ireland, and backed by a\r\nmajority which had legalised confiscation, consecrated sacrilege, and\r\ncondoned high treason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. Education—The Career And The Talents. (1870)\r\n\r\n\r\n    He that taketh away-weights from the motions, doth the same as he\r\n    that addeth wings.—PYM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nAmid dire controversies that in all countries surround all questions of\r\nthe school, some believe the first government of Mr. Gladstone in its\r\ndealing with education to have achieved its greatest constructive work.\r\nOthers think that, on the contrary, it threw away a noble chance. In the\r\nnew scheme of national education established in 1870, the head of the\r\ngovernment rather acquiesced than led. In his own words, his\r\nresponsibility was that of concurrence rather than of authorship. His\r\nclose absorption in the unfamiliar riddles of Irish land, besides the mass\r\nof business incident to the office of prime minister, might well account\r\nfor his small share in the frame of the education bill. More than this,\r\nhowever, his private interest in public education did not amount to zeal,\r\nand it was at bottom the interest of a churchman. Mr. Gladstone afterwards\r\nwrote to Lord Granville (June 14, ’74), “I have never made greater\r\npersonal concessions of opinion than I did on the Education bill to the\r\nunited representations of Ripon and Forster.” His share in the adjustments\r\nof the Act was, as he said afterwards, a very simple one, and he found no\r\noccasion either to differ from departmental colleagues, or to press upon\r\nthem any proposals of his own. If they had been dealing with an untouched\r\ncase, he would have preferred the Scotch plan, which allowed the local\r\nschool board to prescribe whatever religious education pleased it best.\r\nNor did he object to a strict limitation of all teaching paid for in\r\nschools aided or provided out of public money, whether rate or tax, to\r\npurely secular instruction. In that case, however, he held strongly that,\r\nsubject to local consent, the master who gave the secular teaching should\r\nbe allowed to give religious teaching also at other times, even within the\r\nschool-house.(189)\r\n\r\n(M92) What Mr. Gladstone cared for was the integrity of religious\r\ninstruction. What he disliked or dreaded was, in his own language, the\r\ninvasion of that integrity “under cover of protecting exceptional\r\nconsciences.” The advance of his ideas is rather interesting. So far back\r\nas 1843,(190) in considering the education clauses of the Factory bill of\r\nthat year, he explained to Lord Lyttelton that he was not prepared to\r\nlimit church teaching in the schools in the exposition of scripture. Ten\r\nyears later, he wrote to his close friend, Bishop Hamilton of Salisbury:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am not friendly to the idea of constraining by law either the\r\n    total or the partial suppression of conscientious differences in\r\n    religion, with a view to fusion of different sects whether in\r\n    church or school. I believe that the free development of\r\n    conviction is upon the whole the system most in favour both of\r\n    truth and of charity. Consequently you may well believe that I\r\n    contemplate with satisfaction the state of feeling that prevails\r\n    in England, and that has led all governments to adopt the system\r\n    of separate and independent subsidies to the various religious\r\n    denominations.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the government bill of that year (1853), he entirely repudiated the\r\nconstruction put upon some of its clauses, namely, “that people having the\r\ncharge of schools would be obliged to admit children of all religious\r\ncreeds, as well as that having admitted them, they would be put under\r\ncontrol as to the instruction to be given.” Ten years later still, we find\r\nhim saying, “I deeply regret the aversion to ‘conscience clauses,’ which I\r\nam convinced it would be most wise for the church to adopt. As far back as\r\n1838 I laboured hard to get the National Society to act upon this\r\nprinciple permissively; and if I remember right, it was with the approval\r\nof the then Bishop of London.” In 1865 he harps on the same string in a\r\nletter to Lord Granville:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... Suppose the schoolmaster is reading with his boys the third\r\n    chapter of St. John, and he explains the passage relating to\r\n    baptism in the sense of the prayer book and articles—the\r\n    dissenters would say this is instruction in the doctrine of the\r\n    church of England. Now it is utterly impossible for you to tell\r\n    the church schoolmaster or the clergyman that he must not in the\r\n    school explain any passage of scripture in a sense to which any of\r\n    the parents of the children, or at least any sect objects; for\r\n    _then you would in principle entirely alter the character of the\r\n    religious teaching for the rest of the scholars, and in fact upset\r\n    the whole system_. The dissenter, on the other hand, ought (in my\r\n    opinion) to be entitled to withdraw his child from the risk (if he\r\n    considers it such) of receiving instruction of the kind I\r\n    describe.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone had therefore held a consistent course, and in cherishing\r\nalong with full freedom of conscience the integrity of religious\r\ninstruction, he had followed a definite and intelligible line. Unluckily\r\nfor him and his government this was not the line now adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the cabinet met in the autumn of 1869, Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord de\r\nGrey (afterwards Ripon) (Nov. 4):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have read Mr. Forster’s able paper, and I follow it very\r\n    generally. On one point I cannot very well follow it.... Why not\r\n    adopt frankly the principle that the State or the local community\r\n    should provide the secular teaching, and either leave the option\r\n    to the ratepayers to go beyond this _sine quâ non_, if they think\r\n    fit, within the limits of the conscience clause, or else simply\r\n    leave the parties themselves to find Bible and other religious\r\n    education from voluntary sources?\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the session before the introduction of the bill, Mr. Gladstone\r\nnoted in his diary, “Good hope that the principal matters at issue may be\r\naccommodated during the session, but great differences of opinion have\r\ncome to the surface, and much trouble may arise.” In fact trouble enough\r\narose to shake his ministry to its foundations. What would be curious if\r\nhe had not had the Land bill on his hands, is that he did not fight hard\r\nfor his own view in the cabinet. He seems to have been content with\r\nstating it, without insisting. Whether he could have carried it in the\r\nmidst of a whirlwind of indeterminate but vehement opinions, may well be\r\ndoubted.\r\n\r\n(M93) The Education bill was worked through the cabinet by Lord de Grey as\r\npresident of the council, but its lines were laid and its provisions in\r\ntheir varying forms defended in parliament, by the vice-president, who did\r\nnot reach the cabinet until July 1870. Mr. Forster was a man of sterling\r\nforce of character, with resolute and effective power of work, a fervid\r\nlove of country, and a warm and true humanity. No orator, he was yet an\r\nexcellent speaker of a sound order, for his speaking, though plain and\r\neven rough in style, abounded in substance; he always went as near to the\r\nroot of the matter as his vision allowed, and always with marked effect\r\nfor his own purposes. A quaker origin is not incompatible with a militant\r\nspirit, and Forster was sturdy in combat. He had rather a full share of\r\nself-esteem, and he sometimes exhibited a want a tact that unluckily\r\nirritated or estranged many whom more suavity might have retained. Then,\r\nwithout meaning it, he blundered into that most injurious of all positions\r\nfor the parliamentary leader, of appearing to care more for his enemies\r\nthan for his friends. As Mr. Gladstone said of him, “destiny threw him on\r\nthe main occasions of his parliamentary career into open or qualified\r\nconflict with friends as well as foes, perhaps rather more with friends\r\nthan foes.” A more serious defect of mind was that he was apt to approach\r\ngreat questions—Education, Ireland, Turkey—without truly realising how\r\ngreat they were, and this is the worst of all the shortcomings of\r\nstatesmanship. There was one case of notable exception. In all the stages\r\nand aspects of the American civil war, Forster played an admirable part.\r\n\r\nThe problem of education might have seemed the very simplest. After the\r\nextension of the franchise to the workmen, everybody felt, in a happy\r\nphrase of that time, that “we must educate our masters.” Outside events\r\nwere supposed to hold a lesson. The triumphant North in America was the\r\nland of the common school. The victory of Prussians over Austrians at\r\nSadowa in 1866 was called the victory of the elementary school teacher.\r\nEven the nonconformists had come round. Up to the middle of the sixties\r\nopinion among them was hostile to the intervention of the state in\r\neducation. They had resisted Graham’s proposals in 1843, and Lord John\r\nRussell’s in 1847; but a younger generation, eager for progress, saw the\r\nnew necessity that change of social and political circumstance imposed.\r\nThe business in 1870 was to provide schools, and to get the children into\r\nthem.(191)\r\n\r\nIt is surprising how little serious attention had been paid even by\r\nspeculative writers in this country to the vast problem of the relative\r\nduties of the State and the Family in respect of education. Mill devoted a\r\nfew keen pages to it in his book upon political economy. Fawcett, without\r\nmuch of Mill’s intellectual power or any of his sensitive temperament, was\r\nsupposed to represent his principles in parliament; yet in education he\r\nwas against free schools, while Mill was for them. All was unsettled;\r\nimportant things were even unperceived. Yet the questions of national\r\neducation, answer them as we will, touch the moral life and death of\r\nnations. The honourable zeal of the churches had done something, but most\r\nof the ground remained to be covered. The question was whether the system\r\nabout to be created should merely supplement those sectarian, private,\r\nvoluntary schools, or should erect a fabric worthy of the high name of\r\nnational. The churchman hoped, but did not expect, the first. The\r\nnonconformist (broadly speaking), the academic liberal, and the hard-grit\r\nradical, were keen for the second, and they were all three well\r\nrepresented in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n(M94) What the government proposed was that local boards should be called\r\ninto existence to provide schools where provision was inadequate and\r\ninefficient, these schools to be supported by the pence of the children,\r\nthe earned grant from parliament, and a new rate to be levied upon the\r\nlocality. The rate was the critical element. If the boards chose, they\r\ncould make bye-laws compelling parents to send their children to school;\r\nand they could (with a conscience clause) settle what form of religious\r\ninstruction they pleased. The voluntary men were to have a year of grace\r\nin which to make good any deficiency in supply of schools, and so keep out\r\nthe boards. The second reading was secured without a division, but only on\r\nassurances from Mr. Gladstone that amendments would be made in committee.\r\nOn June 16, the prime minister, as he says, “explained the plans of the\r\ngovernment to an eager and agitated house.”\r\n\r\nTwo days before, the cabinet had embarked upon a course that made the\r\nagitation still more eager. Mr. Gladstone wrote the pregnant entry: “_June\r\n14._ Cabinet; decided on making more general use of machinery supplied by\r\nvoluntary schools, avoidance of religious controversy in local boards.”\r\nThis meant that the new system was in no way to supersede the old\r\nnon-system, but to supplement it. The decision was fatal to a national\r\nsettlement. As Mr. Forster put it, their object was “to complete the\r\nvoluntary system and to fill up gaps.” Lord Ripon used the same language\r\nin the Lords. Instead of the school boards being universal, they should\r\nonly come into existence where the ecclesiastical party was not strong\r\nenough in wealth, influence, and liberality to keep them out. Instead of\r\ncompulsory attendance being universal, that principle could only be\r\napplied where a school board was found, and where the school board liked\r\nto apply it. The old parliamentary grant to the denominational schools was\r\nto be doubled. This last provision was Mr. Gladstone’s own. Forster had\r\ntold him that it was impossible to carry a proposal allowing school boards\r\nto contribute to denominational schools, and the only compensation open\r\nwas a larger slice of the grant from parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm at once began to rage around the helmsman’s ears. Some days\r\nearlier the situation had been defined by Mr. Brand, the whip, for his\r\nleader’s guidance. The attempt, he said, made by Fawcett, Dilke, and\r\nothers, to create a diversion in favour of exclusively secular education\r\nhas signally failed; the opinion of the country is clearly adverse. On the\r\nother hand, while insisting on the religious element, the country is just\r\nas strongly opposed to dogmatic teaching in schools aided by local rates.\r\n“You ask me,” said Mr. Gladstone to Mr. Brand (May 24), “to solve the\r\nproblem in the words ‘to include religion, and to exclude dogma,’ which,\r\nas far as I know, though it admits of a sufficient practical handling by\r\nindividuals acting for themselves, has not yet been solved by any state or\r\nparliament.” Well might he report at Windsor (June 21) that, though the\r\nauspices were favourable, there was a great deal of crude and\r\nindeterminate opinion on the subject in the House as well as elsewhere,\r\nand “the bill, if carried, would be carried by the authority and\r\npersistence of the government, aided by the acquiescence of the\r\nopposition.” It was this carrying of the bill by the aid of the tory\r\nopposition that gave fuel to the liberal flame, and the increase of the\r\ngrant to the sectarian schools made the heat more intense. The most\r\ncritical point of the bill, according to Mr. Gladstone, was a proposal\r\nthat now seems singularly worded, to the effect that the teaching of\r\nscriptures in rate schools should not be in favour of, or opposed to,\r\ntenets of any denomination. This was beaten by 251 to 130. “The minority\r\nwas liberal, but more than half of the liberal party present voted in the\r\nmajority.”\r\n\r\n(M95) “We respect Mr. Forster,” cried Dale of Birmingham, “we honour Mr.\r\nGladstone, but we are determined that England shall not again be cursed\r\nwith the bitterness and strife from which we had hoped that we had for\r\never escaped, by the abolition of the church rate.”(192) Writing to a\r\nbrother nonconformist, he expresses his almost unbounded admiration for\r\nMr. Gladstone, “but it is a bitter disappointment that his government\r\nshould be erecting new difficulties in the way of religious equality.”\r\nUnder the flashing eye of the prime minister himself the nonconformist\r\nrevolt reared its crest. Miall, the veteran bearer of the flag of\r\ndisestablishment, told Mr. Gladstone (July 22) that he was leading one\r\nsection of the liberal party through the valley of humiliation. “Once bit,\r\ntwice shy. We can’t stand this sort of thing much longer,” he said. In a\r\nflame of natural wrath Mr. Gladstone replied that he had laboured not to\r\ngain Mr. Miall’s support, but to promote the welfare of the country. “I\r\nhope my hon. friend will not continue his support to the government one\r\nmoment longer than he deems it consistent with his sense of right and\r\nduty. For God’s sake, sir, let him withdraw it the moment he thinks it\r\nbetter for the cause he has at heart that he should do so.” The\r\ngovernment, he said, had striven to smooth difficulties, to allay\r\npassions, to avoid everything that would excite or stimulate, to endeavour\r\nto bring men to work together, to rise above mere sectional views, to\r\neschew all extremes, and not to make their own narrow choice the model of\r\nthe measure they were presenting to parliament, but to admit freely and\r\nliberally into its composition those great influences which were found\r\nswaying the community. Forster wrote to a friend, “it does not rest with\r\nme now whether or no the state should decree against religion—decree that\r\nit is a thing of no account. Well, with my assent the state shall not do\r\nthis, and I believe I can prevent it.”(193) Insist, forsooth, that\r\nreligion was not a thing of no account against men like Dale, one of the\r\nmost ardent and instructed believers that ever fought the fight and kept\r\nthe faith; against Bright, than whom no devouter spirit breathed, and who\r\nthought the Education Act “the worst Act passed by any liberal parliament\r\nsince 1832.”\r\n\r\nThe opposition did not show deep gratitude, having secured as many favours\r\nas they could hope, and more than they had anticipated. A proposal from\r\nthe government (July 14) to introduce secret voting in the election of\r\nlocal boards was stubbornly contested, in spite, says Mr. Gladstone, “of\r\nthe unvarying good temper, signal ability and conciliatory spirit of Mr.\r\nForster,” and it was not until after fourteen divisions that a few\r\nassuaging words from Mr. Gladstone brought the handful of conservative\r\nopposition to reason. It was five o’clock before the unflagging prime\r\nminister found his way homewards in the broad daylight.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to imagine a question on which in a free government it\r\nwas more essential to carry public opinion with the law. To force parents\r\nto send children to school, was an enterprise that must break down if\r\nopinion would not help to work it. Yet probably on no other question in\r\nMr. Gladstone’s career as law-maker was common opinion so hard to weigh,\r\nto test, to focus and adjust. Of the final settlement of the question of\r\nreligious instruction, Mr. Gladstone said to Lord Lyttelton when the\r\nbattle was over (Oct. 25, ’70):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... I will only say that it was in no sense my choice or that of\r\n    the government. Our first proposition was by far the best. But it\r\n    received no active support even from the church, the National\r\n    Society, or the opposition, while divers bishops, large bodies of\r\n    clergy, the Education Union, and earliest of all, I think,\r\n    Roundell Palmer in the House of Commons, threw overboard the\r\n    catechism. We might then have fallen back upon the plan of\r\n    confining the application of the rate to secular subjects; but\r\n    this was opposed by the church, the opposition, most of the\r\n    dissenters, and most of our own friends. As it was, I assure you,\r\n    the very utmost that could be done was to arrange the matter as it\r\n    now stands, where the exclusion is limited to the formulary, and\r\n    to get rid of the popular imposture of undenominational\r\n    instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M96) At bottom the battle of the schools was not educational, it was\r\nsocial. It was not religious but ecclesiastical, and that is often the\r\nvery contrary of religious. In the conflicts of the old centuries whence\r\nChristian creeds emerged, disputes on dogma constantly sprang from\r\nrivalries of race and accidents of geography. So now quarrels about\r\neducation and catechism and conscience masked the standing jealousy\r\nbetween church and chapel—the unwholesome fruit of the historic mishaps of\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that separated the nation into two\r\ncamps, and invested one of them with all the pomp and privilege of social\r\nascendency. The parent and the child, in whose name the struggle raged,\r\nstood indifferent. From the point of party strategy, the policy of this\r\ngreat statute was fatal. The church of England was quickened into active\r\nantagonism by Irish disestablishment, by the extinction of sectarian tests\r\nat Oxford and Cambridge, and by the treatment of endowed schools. This\r\nmight have been balanced by the zeal of nonconformists. Instead of zeal,\r\nthe Education Act produced refrigeration and estrangement.\r\n\r\nWe may be sure that on such a subject Mr. Gladstone looked further than\r\nstrategies of party. “I own to you,” said he to a correspondent before the\r\nbattle was quite over, “that the history of these last few months leaves\r\nupon my mind some melancholy impressions, which I hope at some fancied\r\nperiod of future leisure and retirement to study and interpret.” He soon\r\nsaw how deep the questions went, and on what difficult ground the state\r\nand the nation would be inevitably drawn. His notions of a distinctive\r\nformula were curious. Forster seems to have put some question to him on\r\nthe point whether the three creeds were formularies within the Act. It\r\nappears to me, Mr. Gladstone answered (October 17, 1870):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is quite open to you at once to dispose of the Nicene and\r\n    Athanasian Creeds and to decline inquiring whether they are\r\n    distinctive, upon the ground that they are not documents employed\r\n    in the instruction of young children.... Obviously no one has a\r\n    right to call on you to define the distinctive character of a\r\n    formulary such as the Thirty-nine Articles, or of any but such as\r\n    are employed in schools. With respect to the Apostles’ Creed, it\r\n    appears to me not to be a distinctive formulary in the sense of\r\n    the Act. Besides the fact that it is acknowledged by the great\r\n    bulk of all Christendom, it is denied or rejected by no portion of\r\n    the Christian community; and, further, it is not controversial in\r\n    its form, but sets forth, in the simplest shape a series of the\r\n    leading facts on which Christianity, the least abstract of all\r\n    religions, is based.\r\n\r\n\r\nManning plied him hard (September, October, November, 1871). The state of\r\nParis (Commune blazing that year, Tuileries and Hôtel de Ville in ashes,\r\nand the Prussian spiked helmets at the gates) was traceable to a godless\r\neducation—so the archbishop argued. In England the Christian tradition was\r\nunbroken. It was only a clique of doctrinaires, Huxley at the head of\r\nthem, who believing nothing trumpeted secular education. “Delighted to see\r\nMr. Forster attacked as playing into the hands of the clergy.” Mr.\r\nGladstone should stimulate by every agency in his power the voluntary\r\nreligious energies of the three kingdoms. “The real crisis is in the\r\nformation of men. They are as we make them, and they make society. The\r\nformation of men is the work you have given to the school boards. God gave\r\nit to the parents. Neither you nor Mr. Forster meant this; you least of\r\nall men on your side of the House. Glad to see you lay down the broad and\r\nintelligible line that state grants go to secular education, and voluntary\r\nefforts must do the rest. Let us all start fair in this race. Let every\r\nsect, even the Huxleyites, have their grant if they fulfil the conditions.\r\nAs for the school-rate conscience, it is a mongrel institution of\r\nquakerism.” How Mr. Gladstone replied on all these searching issues, I do\r\nnot find.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passing of the Act did not heal the wound. The nonconformist revolt\r\nwas supported in a great conference at Manchester in 1872, representing\r\neight hundred churches and other organizations. Baptist unions and\r\ncongregational unions were unrelenting. We may as well finish the story.\r\nIt was in connection with this struggle that Mr. Chamberlain first came\r\nprominently into the arena of public life—bold, intrepid, imbued with the\r\nkeen spirit of political nonconformity, and a born tactician. The issue\r\nselected for the attack was the twenty-fifth section of the Education Act,\r\nenabling school boards to pay in denominational schools the fees of\r\nparents who, though not paupers, were unable to pay them. This provision\r\nsuddenly swelled into dimensions of enormity hitherto unsuspected. A\r\ncaustic onlooker observed that it was the smallest ditch in which two\r\ngreat political armies ever engaged in civil war. Yet the possibility\r\nunder cover of this section, of a sectarian board subsidising church\r\nschools was plain, and some cases, though not many, actually occurred in\r\nwhich appreciable sums were so handed over. The twenty-fifth section was a\r\nreal error, and it made no bad flag for an assault upon a scheme of error.\r\n\r\n(M97) Great things were hoped from Mr. Bright’s return to the government\r\nin the autumn of 1873. The correspondence between Mr. Gladstone and him\r\nsheds some interesting light upon the state into which the Education Act,\r\nand Mr. Forster’s intractable bearing in defence of it, had brought\r\nimportant sections of the party:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Bright to Mr. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 12, 1873._—So far as I can hear, there is no intention to\r\n    get up an opposition at Birmingham, which is a comfort, as I am\r\n    not in force to fight a contested election. I am anxious not to go\r\n    to the election, fearing that I shall not have nerve to speak to\r\n    the 5000 men who will or may crowd the town hall. Before I go, if\r\n    I go, I shall want to consult you on the difficult matter—how to\r\n    deal frankly and wisely with the education question. I cannot\r\n    break with my “noncon.” friends, the political friends of all my\r\n    life; and unless my joining you can do something to lessen the\r\n    mischief now existing and _still growing_, I had better remain as\r\n    I have been since my illness, a spectator rather than an actor on\r\n    the political field.... I hope you are better, and that your\r\n    troubles, for a time, are diminished. I wish much you could have\r\n    announced a change in the education department; it would have\r\n    improved the tone of feeling in many constituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone himself had touched “the watchful jealousy” of Bright’s\r\nnonconformist friends by a speech made at the time at Hawarden. This\r\nspeech he explained in writing to Bright from Balmoral (Aug. 21):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The upshot, I think, is this. My speech could not properly have\r\n    been made by a man who thinks that boards and public rates ought\r\n    to be used for the purpose of putting down as quickly as may be\r\n    the voluntary schools. But the recommendation which I made might\r\n    have been consistently and properly supported by any one whose\r\n    opinions fell short of this, and did not in the least turn upon\r\n    any preference for voluntary over compulsory means.(194)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he said afterwards to Lord Granville, “I personally have no fear of the\r\nsecular system; but I cannot join in measures of repression against\r\nvoluntary schools.”\r\n\r\n“There is not a word said by you at Hawarden,” Bright replied (Aug. 25),\r\n“that would fetter you in the least in considering the education question;\r\nbut at present the general feeling is against the idea of any concession\r\non your part.... What is wanted is some definite willingness or resolution\r\nto recover the goodwill and confidence of the nonconformist leaders in the\r\nboroughs; for without this, reconstruction is of no value.... Finance is\r\nof great moment, and people are well pleased to see you in your old office\r\nagain; but no budget will heal the soreness that has been created—it is\r\nnot of the pocket but of the feelings.... I want you just to know where I\r\nam and what I feel; but if I could talk to you, I could say what I have to\r\nsay with more precision, and with a greater delicacy of expression. I ask\r\nyou only to put the best construction on what I write.”\r\n\r\nIf Forster could only have composed himself to the same considerate\r\nspirit, there might have been a different tale to tell. Bright made his\r\nelection speech at Birmingham, and Forster was in trouble about it. “I\r\nthink,” said the orator to Mr. Gladstone, “he ought rather to be thankful\r\nfor it; it will enable him to get out of difficulties if he will improve\r\nthe occasion. There is no question of changing the policy of the\r\ngovernment, but of making minor concessions.... I would willingly change\r\nthe policy of irritation into one of soothing and conciliation.” Nothing\r\nof great importance in the way even of temporary reconciliation was\r\neffected by Mr. Bright’s return. The ditch of the twenty-fifth clause\r\nstill yawned. The prime minister fell back into the position of August.\r\nThe whole situation of the ministry had become critical in every\r\ndirection. “Education must be regarded as still to a limited extent an\r\nopen question in the government.”\r\n\r\nWhen the general election came, the party was still disunited. Out of 425\r\nliberal candidates in England, Scotland, and Wales, 300 were pledged to\r\nthe repeal of the 25th clause. Mr. Gladstone’s last word was in a letter\r\nto Bright (Jan. 27, 1874):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The fact is, it seems to me, that the noncons. have not yet as a\r\n    body made up their minds whether they want unsectarian religion,\r\n    or whether they want simple secular teaching, so far as the\r\n    application of the rate is concerned. I have never been strong\r\n    against the latter of these two which seems to me impartial, and\r\n    not, if fairly worked, of necessity in any degree unfriendly to\r\n    religion. The former is in my opinion glaringly partial, and I\r\n    shall never be a party to it. But there is a good deal of leaning\r\n    to it in the liberal party. Any attempt to obtain definite pledges\r\n    now will give power to the enemies of both plans of proceeding. We\r\n    have no rational course as a party but one, which is to adjourn\r\n    for a while the solution of the grave parts of the education\r\n    problem; and this I know to be in substance your opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M98) The same vigorous currents of national vitality that led to new\r\nendeavours for the education of the poor, had drawn men to consider the\r\nhorrid chaos, the waste, and the abuses in the provision of education for\r\nthe directing classes beyond the poor. Grave problems of more kinds than\r\none came into view. The question, What is education? was nearly as hard to\r\nanswer as the question of which we have seen so much, What is a church?\r\nThe rival claims of old classical training and the acquisition of modern\r\nknowledge were matters of vivacious contest. What is the true place of\r\nclassical learning in the human culture of our own age? Misused charitable\r\ntrusts, and endowments perverted by the fluctuations of time, by lethargy,\r\nby selfishness, from the objects of pious founders, touched wakeful\r\njealousies in the privileged sect, and called into action that adoration\r\nof the principle of property which insists upon applying all the rules of\r\nindividual ownership to what rightfully belongs to the community. Local\r\ninterests were very sensitive, and they were multitudinous. The battle was\r\nseverely fought, and it extended over several years, while commission upon\r\ncommission explored the issues.\r\n\r\nIn a highly interesting letter (1861) to Lord Lyttelton Mr. Gladstone set\r\nout at length his views upon the issue between ancient and modern, between\r\nliterary training and scientific, between utilitarian education and\r\nliberal. The reader will find this letter in an appendix, as well as one\r\nto Sir Stafford Northcote.(195) While rationally conservative upon the\r\ntrue basis of attainments in “that small proportion of the youth of any\r\ncountry who are to become in the fullest sense educated men,” he is\r\nrationally liberal upon what the politics of the time made the burning\r\nquestion of the sacrosanctity of endowments. “It is our habit in this\r\ncountry,” he said, “to treat private interests with an extravagant\r\ntenderness. The truth is that all laxity and extravagance in dealing with\r\nwhat in a large sense is certainly public property, approximates more or\r\nless to dishonesty, or at the least lowers the moral tone of the persons\r\nconcerned.”\r\n\r\nThe result of all this movement, of which it may perhaps be said that it\r\nwas mainly inspired and guided by a few men of superior energy and social\r\nweight like Goldwin Smith, Temple, Jowett, Liddell, the active interest of\r\nthe classes immediately concerned being hardly more than middling—was one\r\nof the best measures in the history of this government of good measures\r\n(1869). It dealt with many hundreds of schools, and with an annual income\r\nof nearly six hundred thousand pounds. As the Endowed Schools bill was one\r\nof the best measures of the government, so it was Mr. Forster’s best piece\r\nof legislative work. That it strengthened the government can hardly be\r\nsaid; the path of the reformer is not rose-strewn.(196)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\n(M99) In one region Mr. Gladstone long lagged behind. He had done a fine\r\nstroke of national policy in releasing Oxford from some of her antique\r\nbonds in 1854;(197) but the principle of a free university was not yet\r\nadmitted to his mind. In 1863 he wrote to the vice-chancellor how entirely\r\nthe government concurred in the principle of restricting the governing\r\nbody of the university and the colleges to the church. The following year\r\nhe was willing to throw open the degree; but the right to sit in\r\nconvocation he guarded by exacting a declaration of membership of the\r\nchurch of England.(198) In 1865 Mr. Goschen—then beginning to make a mark\r\nas one of the ablest of the new generation in parliament, combining the\r\nlarge views of liberal Oxford with the practical energy of the city of\r\nLondon, added to a strong fibre given him by nature—brought in a bill\r\nthrowing open all lay degrees. Mr. Gladstone still stood out, conducting a\r\nbrisk correspondence with dissenters. “The whole controversy,” he wrote to\r\none of them, “is carried on aggressively, as if to disturb and not to\r\nsettle. Abstract principles urged without stint or mercy provoke the\r\ncounter-assertion of abstract principles in return. There is not power to\r\ncarry Mr. Goschen’s speech either in the cabinet, the parliament, or the\r\ncountry. Yet the change in the balance of parties effected by the\r\nelections will cast upon the liberal majority a serious responsibility. I\r\nwould rather see Oxford level with the ground, than its religion regulated\r\nin the manner which would please Bishop Colenso.”\r\n\r\nYear by year the struggle was renewed. Even after the Gladstone government\r\nwas formed, Coleridge, the solicitor-general, was only allowed in a\r\nprivate capacity to introduce a bill removing the tests. When he had been\r\ntwo years at the head of administration, Mr. Gladstone warned Coleridge:\r\n“For me individually it would be beyond anything odious, I am almost\r\ntempted to say it would be impossible, after my long connection with\r\nOxford, to go into a new controversy on the basis of what will be taken\r\nand alleged to be an absolute secularisation of the colleges; as well as a\r\nreversal of what was deliberately considered and sanctioned in the\r\nparliamentary legislation of 1854 and 1856. I incline to think that this\r\nwork is work for others, not for me.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1871 that Mr. Gladstone consented to make the bill a\r\ngovernment measure. It rapidly passed the Commons and was accepted by the\r\nLords, but with amendments. Mr. Gladstone when he had once adopted a\r\nproject never loitered; he now resolutely refused the changes proposed by\r\nthe Lords, and when the time came and Lord Salisbury was for insisting on\r\nthem, the peers declined by a handsome majority to carry the fight\r\nfurther. It is needless to add that the admission of dissenters to degrees\r\nand endowments did not injuriously affect a single object for which a\r\nnational university exists. On the other hand, the mischiefs of\r\necclesiastical monopoly were long in disappearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M100) We have already seen how warmly the project of introducing\r\ncompetition into the civil service had kindled Mr. Gladstone’s enthusiasm\r\nin the days of the Crimean war.(199) Reform had made slow progress. The\r\ncivil service commission had been appointed in 1855, but their\r\nexaminations only tested the quality of candidates sent before them on\r\nnomination. In 1860 a system was set up of limited competition among three\r\nnominated candidates, who had first satisfied a preliminary test\r\nexamination. This lasted until 1870. Lowe had reform much at heart. At the\r\nend of 1869, he appealed to the prime minister: “As I have so often tried\r\nin vain, will you bring the question of the civil service before the\r\ncabinet to-day? Something must be decided. We cannot keep matters in this\r\ndiscreditable state of abeyance. If the cabinet will not entertain the\r\nidea of open competition, might we not at any rate require a larger number\r\nof competitors for each vacancy? five or seven or ten?”\r\n\r\nResistance came from Lord Clarendon and, strange to say, from Mr. Bright.\r\nAn ingenious suggestion of Mr. Gladstone’s solved the difficulty. All\r\nbranches of the civil service were to be thrown open where the minister at\r\nthe head of the department approved. Lowe was ready to answer for all the\r\ndepartments over which he had any control,—the treasury, the board of\r\nworks, audit office, national debt office, paymaster-general’s office,\r\ninland revenue, customs and post-office. Mr. Cardwell, Mr. Childers, Mr.\r\nGoschen, and Lord de Grey were willing to do the same, and finally only\r\nClarendon and the foreign office were left obdurate. It was true to say of\r\nthis change that it placed the whole educated intellect of the country at\r\nthe service and disposal of the state, that it stimulated the acquisition\r\nof knowledge, and that it rescued some of the most important duties in the\r\nlife of the nation from the narrow class to whom they had hitherto been\r\nconfided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. The Franco-German War. (1870)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of all the princes of Europe, the king of England alone seemed to\r\n    be seated upon the pleasant promontory that might safely view the\r\n    tragic sufferings of all his neighbours about him, without any\r\n    other concernment than what arose from his own princely heart and\r\n    Christian compassion, to see such desolation wrought by the pride\r\n    and passion and ambition of private persons, supported by princes\r\n    who knew not what themselves would have.—CLARENDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the years in which England had been widening the base of her\r\ninstitutions, extending her resources of wealth and credit, and\r\nstrengthening her repute in the councils of Christendom, a long train of\r\nevents at which we have glanced from time to time, had slowly effected a\r\nnew distribution of the force of nations, and in Mr. Gladstone’s phrase\r\nhad unset every joint of the compacted fabric of continental Europe. The\r\nspirit in which he thought of his country’s place in these transactions is\r\nto be gathered from a letter addressed by him to General Grey, the\r\nsecretary of the Queen, rather more than a year before the outbreak of the\r\nFranco-German war. What was the immediate occasion I cannot be sure, nor\r\ndoes it matter. The letter itself is full of interest, for it is in truth\r\na sort of charter of the leading principles of Mr. Gladstone’s foreign\r\npolicy at the moment when he first incurred supreme responsibility for our\r\nforeign affairs:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Gladstone to General Grey._\r\n\r\n    _April 17, 1869._—... Apart from this question of the moment,\r\n    there is one more important as to the tone in which it is to be\r\n    desired that, where matter of controversy has arisen on the\r\n    continent of Europe, the diplomatic correspondence of this country\r\n    should be carried on. This more important question may be the\r\n    subject of differences in the country, but I observe with joy that\r\n    her Majesty approves the general principle which Lord Clarendon\r\n    sets forth in his letter of the 16th. I do not believe that\r\n    England ever will or can be unfaithful to her great tradition, or\r\n    can forswear her interest in the common transactions and the\r\n    general interests of Europe. But her credit and her power form a\r\n    fund, which in order that they may be made the most of, should be\r\n    thriftily used.\r\n\r\n    The effect of the great revolutionary war was to place England in\r\n    a position to rely upon the aid of her own resources. This was no\r\n    matter of blame to either party; it was the result of a desperate\r\n    struggle of over twenty years, in which every one else was down in\r\n    his turn, but England was ever on her feet; in which it was found\r\n    that there was no ascertained limit either to her means, or to her\r\n    disposition to dispense them; in which, to use the language of Mr.\r\n    Canning, her flag was always flying “a signal of rallying to the\r\n    combatant, and of shelter to the fallen.” The habit of appeal and\r\n    of reliance thus engendered by peculiar circumstances, requires to\r\n    be altered by a quiet and substantial though not a violent\r\n    process. For though Europe never saw England faint away, _we_ know\r\n    at what a cost of internal danger to all the institutions of the\r\n    country, she fought her way to the perilous eminence on which she\r\n    undoubtedly stood in 1815.\r\n\r\n    If there be a fear abroad that England has forever abjured a\r\n    resort to force other than moral force, is that fear justified by\r\n    facts? In 1853, joining with France, we made ourselves the\r\n    vindicators of the peace of Europe; and ten years later, be it\r\n    remembered, in the case of Denmark we offered to perform the same\r\n    office, but we could get no one to join us. Is it desirable that\r\n    we should go further? Is England so uplifted in strength above\r\n    every other nation, that she can with prudence advertise herself\r\n    as ready to undertake the general redress of wrongs? Would not the\r\n    consequence of such professions and promises be either the\r\n    premature exhaustion of her means, or a collapse in the day of\r\n    performance? Is _any_ Power at this time of day warranted in\r\n    assuming this comprehensive obligation? Of course, the answer is,\r\n    No. But do not, on the other hand, allow it to be believed that\r\n    England will never interfere. For the eccentricities of other\r\n    men’s belief no one can answer; but for any reasonable belief in\r\n    such an abnegation on the part of England, there is no ground\r\n    whatever. As I understand Lord Clarendon’s ideas, they are fairly\r\n    represented by his very important diplomatic communications since\r\n    he has taken office. They proceed upon such grounds as these: That\r\n    England should keep entire in her own hands the means of\r\n    estimating her own obligations upon the various states of facts as\r\n    they arise; that she should not foreclose and narrow her own\r\n    liberty of choice by declarations made to other Powers, in their\r\n    real or supposed interests, of which they would claim to be at\r\n    least joint interpreters; that it is dangerous for her to assume\r\n    alone an advanced, and therefore an isolated position, in regard\r\n    to European controversies; that, come what may, it is better for\r\n    her to promise too little than too much; that she should not\r\n    encourage the weak by giving expectations of aid to resist the\r\n    strong, but should rather seek to deter the strong by firm but\r\n    moderate language, from aggressions on the weak; that she should\r\n    seek to develop and mature the action of a common, or public, or\r\n    European opinion, as the best standing bulwark against wrong, but\r\n    should beware of seeming to lay down the law of that opinion by\r\n    her own authority, and thus running the risk of setting against\r\n    her, and against right and justice, that general sentiment which\r\n    ought to be, and generally would be, arrayed in their favour. I am\r\n    persuaded that at this juncture opinions of this colour being true\r\n    and sound, are also the only opinions which the country is\r\n    disposed to approve. But I do not believe that on that account it\r\n    is one whit less disposed than it has been at any time, to cast in\r\n    its lot upon any fitting occasion with the cause it believes to be\r\n    right.... I therefore hope and feel assured her Majesty will\r\n    believe that Lord Clarendon really requires no intimation from me\r\n    to ensure his steadily maintaining the tone which becomes the\r\n    foreign minister of the Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M101) Heavy banks of cloud hung with occasional breaks of brighter sky\r\nover Europe; and all the plot, intrigue, conspiracy, and subterranean\r\nscheming, that had been incessant ever since the Crimean war disturbed the\r\nold European system, and Cavour first began the recasting of the map, was\r\nbut the repulsive and dangerous symptom of a dire conflict in the depths\r\nof international politics. The Mexican adventure, and the tragedy of\r\nMaximilian’s death at Queretaro, had thrown a black shadow over the\r\niridescent and rotten fabric of Napoleon’s power. Prussian victory over\r\nAustria at Sadowa had startled Europe like a thunderclap. The reactionary\r\nmovement within the catholic fold, as disclosed in the Vatican council,\r\nkindled many hopes among the French clericals, and these hopes inspired a\r\nlively antagonism to protestant Prussia in the breast of the Spanish-born\r\nEmpress of the French. Prussia in 1866 had humiliated one great catholic\r\npower when she defeated the Austrian monarchy on the battlefields of\r\nBohemia. Was she to overthrow also the power that kept the pope upon his\r\ntemporal throne in Rome? All this, however, was no more than the fringe,\r\nthough one of the hardest things in history is to be sure where substance\r\nbegins and fringe ends. The cardinal fact for France and for Europe was\r\nGerman unity. Ever since the Danish conflict, as Bismarck afterwards told\r\nthe British government,(200) the French Emperor strove to bring Prussia to\r\njoin him in plans for their common aggrandisement. The unity of Germany\r\nmeant, besides all else, a vast extension of the area from which the\r\nmaterial of military strength was to be drawn; and this meant the relative\r\ndepression of the power of French arms. Here was the substantial fact,\r\nfeeding the flame of national pride with solid fuel. The German\r\nconfederation of the Congress of Vienna was a skilful invention of\r\nMetternich’s, so devised as to be inert for offence, but extremely\r\nefficient against French aggression. A German confederation under the\r\npowerful and energetic leadership of Prussia gave France a very different\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\nIn August 1867, the French ambassador at Berlin said to the ambassador of\r\nGreat Britain, “We can never passively permit the formation of a German\r\nempire; the position of the Emperor of the French would become untenable.”\r\nThe British ambassador in Paris was told by the foreign minister there,\r\nthat “there was no wish for aggrandisement in the Emperor’s mind, but a\r\nsolicitude for the safety of France.” This solicitude evaporated in what\r\nBismarck disdainfully called the policy of _pourboires_, the policy of\r\ntips and pickings—scraps and slips of territory to be given to France\r\nunder the diplomatic name of compensation. For three years it had been no\r\nsecret that peace was at the mercy of any incident that might arise.\r\n\r\nThe small Powers were in trepidation, and with good reason. Why should not\r\nFrance take Belgium, and Prussia take Holland? The Belgian press did not\r\nconceal bad feeling, and Bismarck let fall the ominous observation that if\r\nBelgium persisted in that course, “she might pay dear for it.” The Dutch\r\nminister told the British ambassador in Vienna that in 1865 he had a long\r\nconversation with Bismarck, and Bismarck had given him to understand that\r\nwithout colonies Prussia could never become a great maritime nation; he\r\ncoveted Holland less for its own sake, than for her wealthy colonies. When\r\nreminded that Belgium was guaranteed by the European Powers, Bismarck\r\nreplied that “a guarantee was in these days of little value.” This remark\r\nmakes an excellent register of the diplomatic temperature of the hour.\r\n\r\nThen for England. The French Emperor observed (1867), not without an\r\naccent of complaint, that she seemed “little disposed to take part in the\r\naffairs of the day.” This was the time of the Derby government. When war\r\nseemed inevitable on the affair of Luxemburg, Lord Stanley, then at the\r\nforeign office, phlegmatically remarked (1867) that England had never\r\nthought it her business to guarantee the integrity of Germany. When\r\npressed from Prussia to say whether in the event of Prussia being forced\r\ninto war by France, England would take a part, Lord Stanley replied that\r\nwith the causes of that quarrel we had nothing to do, and he felt sure\r\nthat neither parliament nor the public would sanction an armed\r\ninterference on either side. Belgium, he added, was a different question.\r\nGeneral non-intervention, therefore, was the common doctrine of both our\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n(M102) After Mr. Gladstone had been a year in power, the chance of a\r\nuseful part for England to perform seemed to rise on the horizon, but to\r\nthose who knew the racing currents, the interplay of stern forces, the\r\nchance seemed but dim and faint. Rumour and gossip of a pacific tenor\r\ncould not hide the vital fact of incessant military preparation on both\r\nsides—steadfast and scientific in Prussia, loose and ill-concerted in\r\nFrance. Along with the perfecting of arms, went on a busy search by France\r\nfor alliances. In the autumn of 1869 Lord Clarendon had gone abroad and\r\ntalked with important personages. Moltke told him that in Prussia they\r\nthought war was near. To Napoleon the secretary of state spoke of the\r\nmonster armaments, the intolerable burden imposed upon the people, and the\r\nconstant danger of war that they created. The Emperor agreed—so Lord\r\nClarendon wrote to Mr. Gladstone (Sept. 18, ’69)—but went on to say that\r\nduring the King of Prussia’s life, and as long as the present Prussian\r\nsystem lasted, he thought no change of importance could be effected. Still\r\nthe seed by and by appeared to have fallen on good ground. For in January\r\n1870, in a conversation with the British ambassador, the French foreign\r\nminister (Daru) suggested that England might use her good offices with\r\nPrussia, to induce a partial disarmament in order that France might disarm\r\nalso. The minister, at the same time, wrote a long despatch in the same\r\nsense to the French ambassador at St. James’s. Lord Clarendon perceived\r\nthe delicacy of opening the matter at Berlin, in view of the Prussian\r\nmonarch’s idolatry of his army. He agreed, however, to bring it before the\r\nking, not officially, but in a confidential form. This would compromise\r\nnobody. The French ambassador in London agreed, and Lord Clarendon wrote\r\nthe draft of a letter to Loftus in Berlin. He sent the draft to Mr.\r\nGladstone (Jan. 31, 1870) for “approval and criticism.” Mr. Gladstone\r\nentered eagerly into Lord Clarendon’s benevolent correspondence:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Gladstone to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    _31 Jan. 1870._—The object of your letter on disarmament is noble,\r\n    and I do not see how the terms of the draft can be improved. I\r\n    presume you will let the Queen know what you are about, and\r\n    possibly circumstances might arrive in which she could help?\r\n\r\n    _7 Feb._—The answer to your pacific letter as reported by Loftus\r\n    throws, I think, a great responsibility on the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\n    _12 Feb._—I hope, with Daru, that you will not desist from your\r\n    efforts, whatever be the best mode of prosecuting the good design.\r\n    I thought Bismarck’s case, on Loftus’s letter, a very bad one. I\r\n    do not think Lyons’s objections, towards the close of his letter,\r\n    apply in a case where you have acted simply as a friend, and not\r\n    in the name and on behalf of France.\r\n\r\n    _18 Feb._—I return Bismarck’s confidential letter on disarmament.\r\n    As the matter appears to me, the best that can be said for this\r\n    letter is that it contains matter which might be used with more or\r\n    less force in a conference on disarmament, by way of abating the\r\n    amount of relative call on Prussia. As an argument against\r\n    entertaining the subject, it is futile, and he ought at any rate\r\n    to be made to feel his responsibility,—which, I daresay, you will\r\n    contrive while acknowledging his civility.\r\n\r\n    _9 April._—I presume you have now only in the matter of\r\n    disarmament to express your inability to recede from your\r\n    opinions, and your regret at the result of the correspondence. If\r\n    inclined to touch the point, you might with perfect justice say\r\n    that while our naval responsibilities for our sea defence have no\r\n    parallel or analogue in the world, we have taken not far short of\r\n    two millions off our estimates, and have not announced that the\r\n    work of reduction is at an end: which, whether satisfactory or\r\n    not, is enough, to show that you do not preach wholly without\r\n    practising.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a striking circumstance, in view of what was to follow, that at this\r\nmoment when Mr. Gladstone first came into contact with Bismarck,—the\r\ngenius of popular right, and free government, and settled law of nations,\r\ninto contact with the genius of force and reason of state and blood and\r\niron—the realist minister of Prussia seemed to be almost as hopeful for\r\nEuropean peace as the minister of England. “The political horizon,”\r\nBismarck wrote (Feb. 22), “seen from Berlin appears at present so\r\nunclouded that there is nothing of interest to report, and I only hope\r\nthat no unexpected event will render the lately risen hope of universal\r\npeace questionable.”(201) The unexpected event did not tarry, and\r\nBismarck’s own share in laying the train is still one of the historic\r\nenigmas of our time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M103) Ever since 1868 the statesmen of revolutionary Spain had looked for\r\na prince to fill their vacant throne. Among others they bethought\r\nthemselves of a member of a catholic branch of the house of Hohenzollern,\r\nand in the autumn of 1869 an actual proposal was secretly made to Prince\r\nLeopold. The thing lingered. Towards the end of February, 1870, Spanish\r\nimportunities were renewed, though still under the seal of strict secrecy,\r\neven the Spanish ambassador in Paris being kept in the dark.(202) Leopold\r\nafter a long struggle declined the glittering bait. The rival pretenders\r\nwere too many, and order was not sure. Still his refusal was not\r\nconsidered final. The chances of order improved, he changed his mind, and\r\non June 28 the Spanish emissary returned to Madrid with the news that the\r\nHohenzollern prince was ready to accept the crown. The King of Prussia,\r\nnot as king, but as head of the house, had given his assent. That Bismarck\r\ninvented the Hohenzollern candidature the evidence is not conclusive. What\r\nis undoubted is that in the late spring of 1870 he took it up, and was\r\nmuch discontented at its failure in that stage.(203) He had become aware\r\nthat France was striving to arrange alliances with Austria, and even with\r\nItaly, in spite of the obnoxious presence of the French garrison at Rome.\r\nIt was possible that on certain issues Bavaria and the South might join\r\nFrance against Prussia. All the hindrances to German unity, the jealousies\r\nof the minor states, the hatred of the Prussian military system, were\r\nlikely to be aggravated by time, if France, while keeping her powder dry,\r\nwere to persevere in a prudent abstention. Bismarck believed that Moltke’s\r\npreparations were more advanced than Napoleon’s. It was his interest to\r\nstrike before any French treaties of alliance were signed. The Spanish\r\ncrown was an occasion. It might easily become a pretext for collision if\r\neither France or Germany thought the hour had come. If the Hohenzollern\r\ncandidate withdrew, it was a diplomatic success for France and a\r\nhumiliation to Germany; if not, a king from Prussia planted across the\r\nPyrenees, after the aggrandizements of north German power in 1864 and\r\n1866, was enough to make Richelieu, Mazarin, Louis XIV., Bonaparte, even\r\nLouis Philippe, turn in their graves.\r\n\r\nOn June 27, 1870, Lord Clarendon died, and on July 6 Lord Granville\r\nreceived the seals of the foreign department from the Queen at Windsor.\r\nThe new chief had visited his office the day before, and the permanent\r\nunder-secretary coming into his room to report, gave him the most\r\nremarkable assurance ever received by any secretary of state on first\r\nseating himself at his desk. Lord Granville told the story in the House of\r\nLords on July 11, when the crash of the fiercest storm since Waterloo was\r\nclose upon them:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The able and experienced under-secretary, Mr. Hammond, at the\r\n    foreign office told me, it being then three or four o’clock, that\r\n    with the exception of the sad and painful subject about to be\r\n    discussed this evening [the murders by brigands in Greece] he had\r\n    never during his long experience known so great a lull in foreign\r\n    affairs, and that he was not aware of any important question that\r\n    I should have to deal with. At six o’clock that evening I received\r\n    a telegram informing me of the choice that had been made by the\r\n    provisional government of Spain of Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern,\r\n    and of his acceptance of the offer. I went to Windsor the\r\n    following day, and had the honour of receiving the seals of the\r\n    foreign office from her Majesty. On my return I saw the Marquis de\r\n    Lavalette, who informed me of the fact which I already knew, and\r\n    in energetic terms remarked on the great indignity thus offered to\r\n    France, and expressed the determination of the government of the\r\n    Emperor not to permit the project to be carried out. M. Lavalette\r\n    added that he trusted that her Majesty’s government, considering\r\n    its friendly relations with France and its general desire to\r\n    maintain peace, would use its influence with the other parties\r\n    concerned. I told M. de Lavalette that the announcement had taken\r\n    the prime minister and myself entirely by surprise.(204)\r\n\r\n\r\nYet two days before Mr. Hammond told Lord Granville that he was not aware\r\nof anything important to be dealt with at the foreign department, a\r\ndeputation had started from Madrid with an invitation to Prince Leopold.\r\nAt the moment when this singular language was falling from our\r\nunder-secretary’s lips, the Duc de Gramont, the French foreign minister,\r\nwas telling Lord Lyons at Paris that France would not endure the insult,\r\nand expressing his hope that the government of the Queen would try to\r\nprevent it. After all, as we have seen, Bismarck in February had used\r\nwords not very unlike Mr. Hammond’s in July.\r\n\r\nOn July 5, the Emperor, who was at St. Cloud, sent for Baron Rothschild\r\n(of Paris), and told him that as there was at that moment no foreign\r\nminister in England, he wished to send through him a message to Mr.\r\nGladstone. He wanted Mr. Gladstone to be informed, that the council of\r\nministers at Madrid had decided to propose Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern\r\nfor the Spanish throne, that his candidature would be intolerable to\r\nFrance, and that he hoped Mr. Gladstone would endeavour to secure its\r\nwithdrawal. The message was telegraphed to London, and early on the\r\nmorning of July 6, the present Lord Rothschild deciphered it for his\r\nfather, and took it to Carlton House Terrace. He found Mr. Gladstone on\r\nthe point of leaving for Windsor, and drove with him to the railway\r\nstation. For a time Mr. Gladstone was silent. Then he said he did not\r\napprove of the candidature, but he was not disposed to interfere with the\r\nliberty of the Spanish people to choose their own sovereign.\r\n\r\nLord Granville put pressure on the provisional government at Madrid to\r\nwithdraw their candidate, and on the government at Berlin “effectually to\r\ndiscourage a project fraught with risks to the best interests of Spain.”\r\nThe draft of this despatch was submitted by Lord Granville to Mr.\r\nGladstone, who suggested a long addition afterwards incorporated in the\r\ntext. The points of his addition were an appeal to the magnanimity of the\r\nKing of Prussia; an injunction to say nothing to give ground for the\r\nsupposition that England had any business to discuss the abstract right of\r\nSpain to choose her own sovereign; that the British government had not\r\nadmitted Prince Leopold’s acceptance of the throne to justify the\r\nimmediate resort to arms threatened by France; but that the secrecy with\r\nwhich the affair had been conducted was a ground for just offence, and the\r\nwithdrawal of the prince could alone repair it.(205) Austria made\r\nenergetic representations at Berlin to the same effect. In sending this\r\naddition to Lord Granville, Mr. Gladstone says (July 8), “I am doubtful\r\nwhether this despatch should go till it has been seen by the cabinet,\r\nindeed I think it should not, and probably you mean this. The Queen\r\nrecollects being told something about this affair by Clarendon—without\r\nresult—last year. I think Gramont exacts too much. It would never do for\r\nus to get up a combination of Powers in this difficult and slippery\r\nmatter.”\r\n\r\nEvents for a week—one of the great critical weeks of the century—moved at\r\na dizzy speed towards the abyss. Peace unfortunately hung upon the\r\nprudence of a band of statesmen in Paris, who have ever since, both in\r\ntheir own country and everywhere else, been a byword in history for\r\nblindness and folly. The game was delicate. Even in the low and broken\r\nestate into which the moral areopagus of Europe had fallen in these days,\r\nit was a disadvantage to figure as the aggressor. This disadvantage the\r\nFrench Empire heedlessly imposed upon itself. Of the diplomacy on the side\r\nof the government of France anterior to the war, Mr. Gladstone said that\r\nit made up “a chapter which for fault and folly taken together is almost\r\nwithout a parallel in the history of nations.”(206)\r\n\r\nOn July 6 the French Ministers made a precipitate declaration to their\r\nChambers, which was in fact an ultimatum to Prussia. The action of Spain\r\nwas turned into Prussian action. Prussia was called to account in a form\r\nthat became a public and international threat, as Bismarck put it, “with\r\nthe hand on the sword-hilt.” These rash words of challenge were the first\r\nof the French disasters. On July 8 the Duc de Gramont begged her Majesty’s\r\ngovernment to use all their influence to bring about the voluntary\r\nrenunciation by Prince Leopold of his pretensions. This he told Lord Lyons\r\nwould be “a most fortunate solution” of the question. Two days later he\r\nassured Lord Lyons that “if the Prince of Hohenzollern should, on the\r\nadvice of the King of Prussia, withdraw his acceptance of the crown the\r\nwhole affair would be at an end.”\r\n\r\nOn July 10 Lord Granville suggests to Mr. Gladstone: “What do you think of\r\nasking the Queen whether there is any one to whom she could write\r\nconfidentially with a view to persuade Hohenzollern to refuse?” Mr.\r\nGladstone replies:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. I should think you could not do wrong in asking the Queen, as\r\n    you propose, to procure if she can a refusal from Hohenzollern,\r\n    through some private channel. 2. I suppose there could be no\r\n    objection to sounding the Italian government as to the Duke of\r\n    Aosta. 3. If in the meantime you have authentic accounts of\r\n    military movements in France, would it not be right formally to\r\n    ask their suspension, if it be still the desire of the French\r\n    government that you should continue to act in the sense of\r\n    procuring withdrawal?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ambassador at Paris was instructed to work vigorously in this sense,\r\nand to urge self-possession and measure upon the Emperor’s council. On\r\nJuly 12, however, the prospects of peace grew more and more shadowy. On\r\nthat day it became known that Prince Leopold had spontaneously renounced\r\nthe candidature, or that his father had renounced it on his behalf. The\r\nFrench ministers made up their minds that the defeat of Prussia must be\r\nmore direct. Gramont told Lyons (July 12) that the French government was\r\nin a very embarrassing position. Public opinion was so much excited that\r\nit was doubtful whether the ministry would not be overthrown, if it went\r\ndown to the Chamber and announced that it regarded the affair as finished,\r\nwithout having obtained some more complete satisfaction from Prussia. So\r\nthe Emperor and his advisers flung themselves gratuitously under\r\nBismarck’s grinding wheels by a further demand that not only should the\r\ncandidature be withdrawn, but the King should pledge himself against its\r\never being at any time revived. Mr. Gladstone was not slow to see the\r\nfatal mischief of this new development.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Gladstone to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    _July 12_, 11.30 P.M.—I have seen, since Rothschild’s\r\n    telegram,(207) that of Lyons, dated 7.55 P.M. It seems to me that\r\n    Lyons should be supplied with an urgent instruction by telegram\r\n    before the council of ministers to-morrow. France appealed to our\r\n    support at the outset. She received it so far as the immediate\r\n    object was concerned. It was immediately and energetically given.\r\n    It appears to have been named by the French minister in public\r\n    inclusively with that of other Powers. Under these circumstances\r\n    it is our duty to represent the immense responsibility which will\r\n    rest upon France, if she does not at once accept as satisfactory\r\n    and conclusive, the withdrawal of the candidature of Prince\r\n    Leopold.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe substance of this note was despatched to Paris at 2.30 A.M. on the\r\nmorning of July 13. It did not reach Lord Lyons till half-past nine, when\r\nthe council of ministers had already been sitting for half an hour at St.\r\nCloud. The telegram was hastily embodied in the form of a tolerably\r\nemphatic letter and sent by special messenger to St. Cloud, where it was\r\nplaced in M. de Gramont’s hand, at the table at which he and the other\r\nministers were still sitting in council in the presence of the Emperor and\r\nthe Empress.(208) At the same time Lord Granville strongly urged M. de\r\nLavalette in London, to impress upon his government that they ought not to\r\ntake upon themselves the responsibility of pursuing the quarrel on a\r\nmatter of form, when they had obtained what Gramont had assured Lord Lyons\r\nwould put an end to the dispute. Though Mr. Disraeli afterwards imputed\r\nwant of energy to the British remonstrances, there is no reason to suppose\r\nthat Lord Lyons was wanting either in directness or emphasis. What\r\nwarnings were likely to reach the minds of men trembling for their\r\npersonal popularity and for the dynasty, afraid of clamour in the streets,\r\nafraid of the army, ignorant of vital facts both military and diplomatic,\r\nincapable of measuring such facts even if they had known them, committed\r\nby the rash declaration of defiance a week before to a position that made\r\nretreat the only alternative to the sword? At the head of them all sat in\r\nmisery, a sovereign reduced by disease to a wavering shadow of the will\r\nand vision of a man. They marched headlong to the pit that Bismarck was\r\ndigging for them.\r\n\r\n(M104) On July 14 Mr. Gladstone again writes to Lord Granville, suggesting\r\nanswers to questions that might be asked that night in parliament. Should\r\nthey say that the candidature was withdrawn, and that with this withdrawal\r\nwe had a right to hope the whole affair would end, but that communications\r\nwere still continued with Prussia? In duty to all parties we were bound to\r\nhope that the subject of complaint having disappeared, the complaint\r\nitself and the danger to the peace of Europe would disappear also. Then he\r\nproceeds: “What if you were to telegraph to Lyons to signify that we think\r\nit probable questions may be asked in parliament to-day; that having been\r\ncalled in by France itself, we cannot affect to be wholly outside the\r\nmatter; and that it will be impossible for us to conceal the opinion that\r\nthe cause of quarrel having been removed, France ought to be satisfied.\r\nWhile this might fairly pass as a friendly notice, it might also be useful\r\nas admonition. Please to consider. The claim in the telegrams for more\r\nacknowledgment of the conduct of Prussia in parliament, seems to me to\r\ndeserve consideration.”\r\n\r\nOn July 13 Gramont asked Lord Lyons whether he could count upon the good\r\noffices of England in obtaining the prohibition of any future candidature,\r\nat the same time giving him a written assurance that this would terminate\r\nthe incident. Lord Lyons declined to commit himself, and referred home for\r\ninstructions. The cabinet was hastily summoned for noon on the 14th. It\r\ndecided that the demand could not be justified by France, and at the same\r\ntime took a step of which Gramont chose to say, that it was the one act\r\ndone by the English government in favour of peace. They suggested to\r\nBismarck that as the King of Prussia had consented to the acceptance by\r\nPrince Leopold of the Spanish crown, and had thereby, in a certain sense,\r\nbecome a party to the arrangement, so he might with perfect dignity\r\ncommunicate to the French government his consent to the withdrawal of the\r\nacceptance, if France waived her demand for an engagement covering the\r\nfuture. This suggestion Bismarck declined (July 15) to bring before the\r\nKing, as he did not feel that he could recommend its acceptance. As he had\r\ndecided to hold France tight in the position in which her rulers had now\r\nplanted her, we can understand why he could not recommend the English\r\nproposal to his master. Meanwhile the die was cast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M105) The King of Prussia was taking the waters of Ems. Thither\r\nBenedetti, the French ambassador to his court, under instructions followed\r\nhim. The King with moderation and temper told him (July 11) he had just\r\nreceived a telegram that the answer of Prince Leopold would certainly\r\nreach him the next day, and he would then at once communicate it.\r\nSomething (some say Bismarck) prevented the arrival of the courier for\r\nsome hours beyond the time anticipated. On the morning of the 13th the\r\nKing met Benedetti on the promenade, and asked him if he had anything new\r\nto say. The ambassador obeyed his orders, and told the King of the demand\r\nfor assurances against a future candidature. The King at once refused this\r\nnew and unexpected concession, but in parting from Benedetti said they\r\nwould resume their conversation in the afternoon. Meanwhile the courier\r\narrived, but before the courier a despatch came from Paris conveying the\r\nsuggestion that the King might write an apologetic letter to the French\r\nEmperor. This naturally gave the King some offence, but he contented\r\nhimself with sending Benedetti a polite message by an aide-de-camp that he\r\nhad received in writing from Prince Leopold the intelligence of his\r\nrenunciation. “By this his Majesty considered the question as settled.”\r\nBenedetti persevered in seeking to learn what answer he should make to his\r\ngovernment on the question of further assurances. The King replied by the\r\nsame officer that he was obliged to decline absolutely to enter into new\r\nnegotiations; that what he had said in the morning was his last word in\r\nthe matter. On July 14, the King received Benedetti in the railway\r\ncarriage on his departure for Berlin, told him that any future\r\nnegotiations would be conducted by his government, and parted from him\r\nwith courteous salutations. Neither king nor ambassador was conscious that\r\nthe country of either had suffered a shadow of indignity from the\r\nrepresentative of the other.\r\n\r\nBismarck called upon the British ambassador in those days, and made what,\r\nin the light of later revelations, seems a singular complaint. He observed\r\nthat Great Britain “should have forbidden France to enter on the war. She\r\nwas in a position to do so, and her interests and those of Europe demanded\r\nit of her.”(209) Later in the year he spoke in the same sense at\r\nVersailles: “If, at the beginning of the war, the English had said to\r\nNapoleon, ‘There must be no war,’ there would have been none.”(210) What\r\nis certain is that nobody would have been more discomfited by the success\r\nof England’s prohibition than Count Bismarck. The sincerity and substance\r\nof his reproach are tested by a revelation made by himself long after.\r\nThough familiar, the story is worth telling over again in the biography of\r\na statesman who stood for a type alien to policies of fraud.\r\n\r\n(M106) Bismarck had hurried from Varzin to Berlin on July 12, in profound\r\nconcern lest his royal master should subject his country and his minister\r\nto what, after the menace of Gramont and Ollivier on July 6, would be\r\ngrave diplomatic defeat. He had resolved to retire if the incident should\r\nend in this shape, and the chief actor has himself described the strange\r\nsinister scene that averted his design. He invited Moltke and Roon to dine\r\nwith him alone on July 13. In the midst of their conversation, “I was\r\ninformed,” he says, “that a telegram from Ems in cipher, if I recollect\r\nrightly, of about 200 ‘groups’ was being deciphered. When the copy was\r\nhanded me it showed that Abeken had drawn up and signed the telegram at\r\nhis Majesty’s command, and I read it out to my guests, whose dejection was\r\nso great that they turned away from food and drink. On a repeated\r\nexamination of the document I lingered upon the authorisation of his\r\nMajesty, which included a command, immediately to communicate Benedetti’s\r\nfresh demand and its rejection to our ambassadors and to the press. I put\r\na few questions to Moltke as to the extent of his confidence in the state\r\nof our preparations, especially as to the time they would still require in\r\norder to meet this sudden risk of war. He answered that if there was to be\r\nwar he expected no advantage to us by deferring its outbreak.... Under the\r\nconviction that war could be avoided only at the cost of the honour of\r\nPrussia, I made use of the royal authorisation to publish the contents of\r\nthe telegram; and in the presence of my two guests I reduced the telegram\r\nby striking out words, but without adding or altering, to the following\r\nform: ‘After the news of the renunciation of the hereditary Prince of\r\nHohenzollern had been officially communicated to the imperial government\r\nof France by the royal government of Spain, the French ambassador at Ems\r\nfurther demanded of his Majesty the King that he would authorise him to\r\ntelegraph to Paris that his Majesty the King bound himself for all future\r\ntime never again to give his consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew\r\ntheir candidature. His Majesty the King thereupon decided not to receive\r\nthe French ambassador again, and sent to tell him through the aide-de-camp\r\non duty that his Majesty had nothing further to communicate to the\r\nambassador.’ The difference in the effect of the abbreviated text of the\r\nEms telegram, as compared with that produced by the original, was not the\r\nresult of stronger words but of the form, which made this announcement\r\nappear decisive, while Abeken’s version would only have been regarded as a\r\nfragment of a negotiation still pending and to be continued at Berlin.\r\nAfter I had read out the concentrated edition to my two guests, Moltke\r\nremarked: ‘Now it has a different ring; it sounded before like a parley;\r\nnow it is like a flourish in answer to a challenge.’ I went on to explain:\r\n‘If in execution of his Majesty’s order I at once communicate this text,\r\nwhich contains no alteration in or addition to the telegram, not only to\r\nthe newspapers, but also by telegraph to all our embassies, it will be\r\nknown in Paris before midnight, and not only an account of its contents,\r\nbut also an account of the manner of its distribution, will have the\r\neffect of a red rag upon the Gallic bull. Fight we must, if we do not want\r\nto act the part of the vanquished without a battle. Success, however,\r\nessentially depends upon the impression which the origination of the war\r\nmakes upon us and others; it is important that we should be the party\r\nattacked, and that we fearlessly meet the public threats of France.’ This\r\nexplanation brought about in the two generals a revulsion to a more joyous\r\nmood, the liveliness of which surprised me. They had suddenly recovered\r\ntheir pleasure in eating and drinking, and spoke in a more cheerful vein.\r\nRoon said: ‘Our God of old lives still, and will not let us perish in\r\ndisgrace.’ ”(211)\r\n\r\nThe telegram devised at the Berlin dinner-party soon reached Paris. For a\r\nsecond time the 14th day of July was to be a date of doom in French\r\nhistory. The Emperor and his council deliberated on the grave question of\r\ncalling out the reserves. The decisive step had been pressed by Marshal\r\nLebœuf the night before without success. He now returned to the charge,\r\nand this time his proposal was resolved upon. It was about four o’clock.\r\nThe marshal had hardly left the room before new scruples seized his\r\ncolleagues. The discussion began over again, and misgivings revived. The\r\nEmperor showed himself downcast and worn out. Towards five o’clock\r\nsomebody came to tell them it was absolutely necessary that ministers\r\nshould present themselves before the Chambers. Gramont rose and told them\r\nthat if they wished an accommodation, there was still one way, an appeal\r\nto Europe. The word congress was no sooner pronounced than the Emperor,\r\nseized by extraordinary emotion at the thought of salvation by his own\r\nfavourite chimera, was stirred even to tears. An address to the Powers was\r\ninstantly drawn up, and the council broke off. At six o’clock Lebœuf\r\nreceived a note from the Emperor, seeming to regret the decision to call\r\nout the reserves. On Lebœuf’s demand the council was convoked for ten\r\no’clock that night. In the interval news came that the Ems telegram had\r\nbeen communicated to foreign governments. As Bismarck had calculated, the\r\naffront of the telegram was aggravated by publicity. At ten o’clock the\r\ncouncil met, and mobilisation was again considered. By eleven it was\r\nalmost decided that mobilisation should be put off. At eleven o’clock a\r\nforeign office despatch arrived, and was read at the council. What was\r\nthis despatch, is not yet known—perhaps from the French military agent at\r\nBerlin, with further news of Prussian preparations. It was of such a kind\r\nthat it brought about an instant reaction. The orders for mobilisation\r\nwere maintained.(212)\r\n\r\n(M107) An inflammatory appeal was made to the Chambers. When a\r\nparliamentary committee was appointed, a vital document was suppressed,\r\nand its purport misrepresented. Thus in point of scruple, the two parties\r\nto the transaction were not ill-matched, but Bismarck had been watchful,\r\nprovident, and well informed, while his opponents were men, as one of them\r\nsaid, “of a light heart,” heedless, uncalculating, and ignorant and wrong\r\nas to their facts.(213)\r\n\r\nOn July 15 Mr. Gladstone reported to the Queen:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Disraeli made inquiries from the government respecting the\r\n    differences between France and Prussia, and in so doing expressed\r\n    opinions strongly adverse to France as the apparent aggressor. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, in replying, admitted it to be the opinion of the\r\n    government that there was no matter known to be in controversy of\r\n    a nature to warrant a disturbance of the general peace. He said\r\n    the course of events was not favourable, and the decisive moment\r\n    must in all likelihood be close at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n“At a quarter past four,” says a colleague, “a cabinet box was handed down\r\nthe treasury bench to Gladstone. He opened it and looking along to us,\r\nsaid—with an accent I shall never forget—‘_War declared against\r\nPrussia._’ ”(214) “Shall I ever forget,” says Archbishop Tait,\r\n“Gladstone’s face of earnest care when I saw him in the lobby?”(215)\r\n\r\nThe British cabinet made a final effort for peace. Lord Granville\r\ninstructed our ambassadors to urge France and Prussia to be so far\r\ncontrolled by the treaty of Paris that before proceeding to extremities\r\nthey should have recourse to the good offices of some friendly Power,\r\nadding that his government was ready to take any part that might be\r\ndesired in the matter. On the 18th Bismarck replied by throwing the onus\r\nof acceptance on France. On the 19th France declined the proposal.\r\n\r\nJust as Bismarck said that England ought to have prevented the war,\r\nFrenchmen also said that we ought to have held the Emperor back. With what\r\nsanction could Mr. Gladstone have enforced peremptory counsel? Was France\r\nto be made to understand that England would go to war on the Prussian\r\nside? Short of war, what more could she have done? Lord Granville had told\r\nGramont that he had never in despatch or conversation admitted that after\r\nthe French had received satisfaction in substance, there was a case for a\r\nquarrel on pure form. The British cabinet and their ambassador in Paris\r\nhad redoubled warning and remonstrance. If the Emperor and his advisers\r\ndid not listen to the penetrating expostulations of Thiers, and to his\r\nvigorous and instructed analysis of the conditions of their case, why\r\nshould they listen to Lord Granville? Nor was there time, for their\r\nprecipitancy had kindled a conflagration before either England or any\r\nother Power had any chance of extinguishing the blaze.(216)\r\n\r\nTo Michel Chevalier Mr. Gladstone wrote a few days later:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I cannot describe to you the sensation of pain, almost of horror,\r\n    which, has thrilled through this country from end to end at the\r\n    outbreak of hostilities, the commencement of the work of blood. I\r\n    suppose there was a time when England would have said, “Let our\r\n    neighbours, being, as they are, our rivals, waste their energies,\r\n    their wealth, their precious irrevocable lives, in destroying one\r\n    another: they will be the weaker, we shall be relatively the\r\n    stronger.” But we have now unlearned that bad philosophy; and the\r\n    war between France and Prussia saddens the whole face of society,\r\n    and burdens every man with a personal grief. We do not pretend to\r\n    be sufficient judges of the merits: I now mean by “we” those who\r\n    are in authority, and perhaps in a condition to judge least ill.\r\n    We cannot divide praise and blame as between parties. I hope you\r\n    do not think it unkind that I should write thus. Forgive the\r\n    _rashness_ of a friend. One of the purposes in life dear to my\r\n    heart has been to knit together in true amity the people of my own\r\n    country with those of your great nation. That web of concord is\r\n    too tender yet, not to suffer under the rude strain of conflicts\r\n    and concussions even such as we have no material share in. I think\r\n    that even if I err, I cannot be without a portion of your\r\n    sympathy: now when the knell of the brave begins to toll. As for\r\n    us, we have endeavoured to cherish with both the relations of\r\n    peace and mutual respect. May nothing happen to impair them!\r\n\r\n\r\nThough good feeling prevented Mr. Gladstone from dividing praise and blame\r\nbetween the two governments, his own judgment was clear. The initial\r\ndeclaration of July 6, followed by the invention of a second demand by\r\nFrance upon Prussia after the first had been conceded, looked to him, as\r\nit did to England generally, like a fixed resolution to force a quarrel.\r\nIn September he wrote of the proceedings of the French government:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wonder rises to its climax when we remember that this feverish\r\n    determination to force a quarrel was associated with a firm belief\r\n    in the high preparation and military superiority of the French\r\n    forces, the comparative inferiority of the Germans, the\r\n    indisposition of the smaller states to give aid to Prussia, and\r\n    even the readiness of Austria, with which from his long residence\r\n    at Vienna the Duc de Gramont supposed himself to be thoroughly\r\n    acquainted, to appear in arms as the ally of France. It too soon\r\n    appeared that, as the advisers of the Emperor knew nothing of\r\n    public rights and nothing of the sense of Europe, so they knew\r\n    nothing about Austria and the mind of the German states, and less\r\n    than nothing about not only the Prussian army, but even their\r\n    own.(217)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V. Neutrality And Annexation. (1870)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The immediate purpose with which Italians and Germans effected the\r\n    great change in the European constitution was unity, not liberty.\r\n    They constructed not securities but forces. Machiavelli’s time had\r\n    come.—ACTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n(M108) “The war is a grievous affair,” Mr. Gladstone said to Brand, “and\r\nadds much to our cares, for to maintain our neutrality in such a case as\r\nthis, will be a most arduous task. On the face of the facts France is\r\nwrong, but as to personal trustworthiness the two moving spirits on the\r\nrespective sides, Napoleon and Bismarck, are nearly on a par.” His\r\nindividual activity was unsparing. He held almost daily conferences with\r\nLord Granville at the foreign office; criticised and minuted despatches;\r\ncontributed freely to the drafts. “There has not, I think,” he wrote to\r\nBright (Sept. 12), “been a single day on which Granville and I have not\r\nbeen in anxious communication on the subject of the war.” When Lord\r\nGranville went to Walmer he wrote to Mr. Gladstone, “I miss our\r\ndiscussions here over the despatches as they come in very much.” “I hope I\r\nneed not say that while you are laid up with gout at Walmer,” Mr.\r\nGladstone wrote in October, “I am most ready to start at a few hours’\r\nnotice at any time of day or night, to join you upon any matter which you\r\nmay find to require it. Indeed I could not properly or with comfort remain\r\nhere upon any other terms.” Details of this agitating time, with all its\r\nconvulsions and readjustments, belong to the history of Europe. The part\r\ntaken by Mr. Gladstone and his cabinet was for several months in pretty\r\nclose harmony with the humour of the country. It will be enough for us to\r\nmark their action at decisive moments.\r\n\r\nOn July 16 he wrote to Cardwell at the war office:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    If, unhappily, which God forbid, we have to act in this war, it\r\n    will not be with six months’, nor three months’, nor even one\r\n    month’s notice. The real question is, supposing an urgent call of\r\n    honour and of duty in an emergency for 15,000 or 20,000 men, what\r\n    would you do? What answer would the military authorities make to\r\n    this question, those of them especially who have brains rather\r\n    than mere position? Have you no fuller battalions than those of\r\n    500? At home or in the Mediterranean? If in the latter, should\r\n    they not be brought home? Childers seemed to offer a handsome\r\n    subscription of marines, and that the artillery would count for\r\n    much in such a case is most probable. What I should like is to\r\n    study the means of sending 20,000 men to Antwerp with as much\r\n    promptitude as at the Trent affair we sent 10,000 to Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figures of the army and navy were promptly supplied to the prime\r\nminister, Cardwell adding with, a certain shrillness that, though he had\r\nno wish to go either to Antwerp or anywhere else, he could not be\r\nresponsible for sending an expedition abroad, unless the army were fitted\r\nfor that object by measures taken now to increase its force.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I entirely agree with you, Mr. Gladstone replied, that _when_ it\r\n    is seriously intended to send troops to Antwerp or elsewhere\r\n    abroad, “immediate measures must be taken to increase our force.”\r\n    I feel, however, rather uneasy at what seems to me the extreme\r\n    susceptibility on one side of the case of some members of the\r\n    cabinet. I hope it will be balanced by considering the effect of\r\n    any forward step by appeal to parliament, in compromising the true\r\n    and entire neutrality of our position, and in disturbing and\r\n    misdirecting the mind of the public and of parliament. I am afraid\r\n    I have conveyed to your mind a wrong impression as to the state of\r\n    my own. It is only a far outlook which, in my opinion, brings into\r\n    view as a possibility the sending a force to Antwerp. Should the\r\n    day arrive, we shall then be on the very edge of war, with\r\n    scarcely a hope of not passing onward into the abyss.\r\n\r\n\r\nCardwell sent him a paper by a high military authority, on which Mr.\r\nGladstone made two terse ironic comments. “I think the paper,” he said,\r\n“if it proves anything proves (1) That generals and not ministers are the\r\nproper judges of those weights in the political scales which express the\r\nlikelihood of war and peace; (2) That there is very little difference\r\nbetween absolute neutrality and actual war. I advise that Granville should\r\nsee it.”\r\n\r\nOn July 25 the _Times_ divulged the text of a projected agreement in 1869\r\n(it was in truth 1867) between the French and Prussian governments in five\r\narticles, including one that the incorporation of Belgium by France would\r\nnot be objected to by Prussia. The public was shocked and startled, and\r\nmany were inclined to put down the document for a forgery and a hoax. As a\r\nmatter of fact, in substance it was neither. The Prussian ambassador a few\r\ndays before had informed Mr. Gladstone and Lord Granville personally and\r\nin strict secrecy, that the draft of such a project existed in the\r\nhandwriting of M. Benedetti. This private communication was taken by Mr.\r\nGladstone to have been made with the object of prompting him to be the\r\nagent in producing the evil news to the world, and thus to prejudice\r\nFrance in the judgment of Europe. He thought that no part of his duty, and\r\ntook time to consider it, in the expectation that it was pretty sure to\r\nfind its way into print by some other means, as indeed soon happened. “For\r\nthe sake of peace,” Bismarck explained to Lord Granville (July 28, 1870),\r\n“I kept the secret, and treated the propositions in a dilatory manner.”\r\nWhen the British ambassador on one occasion had tried to sound him on the\r\nsuspected designs of France, Bismarck answered, “It is no business of mine\r\nto tell French secrets.”\r\n\r\n(M109) There were members of the cabinet who doubted the expediency of\r\nEngland taking any action. The real position of affairs, they argued, was\r\nnot altered: the draft treaty only disclosed what everybody believed\r\nbefore, namely that France sought compensation for Prussian\r\naggrandisement, as she had secured it for Italian aggrandisement by taking\r\nSavoy and Nice. That Prussia would not object, provided the compensations\r\nwere not at the expense of people who spoke German, had all come out at\r\nthe time of the Luxemburg affair. If France and Prussia agreed, how could\r\nwe help Belgium, unless indeed Europe joined? But then what chance was\r\nthere of Russia and Austria joining against France and Prussia for the\r\nsake of Belgium, in which neither of them had any direct interest? At the\r\nsame time ministers knew that the public in England expected them to do\r\nsomething, though a vote for men and money would probably suffice. The\r\ncabinet, however, advanced a step beyond a parliamentary vote. On July 30\r\nthey met and took a decision to which Mr. Gladstone then and always after\r\nattached high importance. England proposed a treaty to Prussia and France,\r\nproviding that if the armies of either violated the neutrality of Belgium,\r\nGreat Britain would co-operate with the other for its defence, but without\r\nengaging to take part in the general operations of the war. The treaty was\r\nto hold good for twelve months after the conclusion of the war. Bismarck\r\nat once came into the engagement. France loitered a little, but after the\r\nbattle of Wörth made no more difficulty, and the instrument was signed on\r\nAugust 9.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nThe mind of the government was described by Mr. Gladstone in a letter to\r\nBright (August 1):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Although some members of the cabinet were inclined on the outbreak\r\n    of this most miserable war to make military preparations, others,\r\n    Lord Granville and I among them, by no means shared that\r\n    disposition, nor I think was the feeling of parliament that way\r\n    inclined. But the publication of the treaty has altered all this,\r\n    and has thrown upon us the necessity either of doing something\r\n    fresh to secure Belgium, or else of saying that under no\r\n    circumstances would we take any step to secure her from\r\n    absorption. This publication has wholly altered the feeling of the\r\n    House of Commons, and no government could at this moment venture\r\n    to give utterance to such an intention about Belgium. But neither\r\n    do we think it would be right, even if it were safe, to announce\r\n    that we would in any case stand by with folded arms, and see\r\n    actions done which would amount to a total extinction of public\r\n    right in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of engagements that might some day involve resort to force made\r\nBright uneasy, and Mr. Gladstone wrote to him again (August 4):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It will be a great addition to the domestic portion of the griefs\r\n    of this most unhappy war, if it is to be the cause of a political\r\n    severance between you and the present administration. To this I\r\n    know you would justly reply that the claims of conviction are\r\n    paramount. I hope, however, that the moment has not quite\r\n    arrived.... You will, I am sure, give me credit for good faith\r\n    when I say, especially on Lord Granville’s part as on my own, who\r\n    are most of all responsible, that we take this step in the\r\n    interest of peace.... The recommendation set up in opposition to\r\n    it generally is, that we should simply declare _we_ will defend\r\n    the neutrality of Belgium by arms in case it should be attacked.\r\n    Now the sole or single-handed defence of Belgium would be an\r\n    enterprise which we incline to think Quixotic; if these two great\r\n    military powers combined against it—that combination is the only\r\n    serious danger; and this it is which by our proposed engagements\r\n    we should I hope render improbable to the very last degree. I add\r\n    for myself this confession of faith. If the Belgian people desire,\r\n    on their own account, to join France or any other country, I for\r\n    one will be no party to taking up arms to prevent it. But that the\r\n    Belgians, whether they would or not, should go ’plump’ down the\r\n    maw of another country to satisfy dynastic greed, is another\r\n    matter. The accomplishment of such a crime as this implies, would\r\n    come near to an extinction of public right in Europe, and I do not\r\n    think we could look on while the sacrifice of freedom and\r\n    independence was in course of consummation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M110) By the end of the first week of August the storm of war had burst\r\nupon the world. “On the 2nd of August, in the insignificant affair of\r\nSaarbrück, the Emperor of the French assumed a feeble offensive. On the\r\n4th, the Prussians replied energetically at Wissemburg. And then what a\r\ntorrent, what a deluge of events! In twenty-eight days ten battles were\r\nfought. Three hundred thousand men were sent to the hospitals, to\r\ncaptivity, or to the grave. The German enemy had penetrated into the\r\ninterior of France, over a distance of a hundred and fifty miles of\r\nterritory, and had stretched forth everywhere as he went the strong hand\r\nof possession. The Emperor was a prisoner, and had been deposed with\r\ngeneral consent; his family wanderers, none knew where; the embryo at\r\nleast of a republic, born of the hour, had risen on the ruins of the\r\nempire, while proud and gorgeous Paris was awaiting with divided mind the\r\napproach of the conquering monarch, and his countless host.”(218) This was\r\nMr. Gladstone’s description of a marvellous and shattering hour.\r\n\r\nTalleyrand was fond in the days of 1815 at Vienna, of applying to any\r\ndiplomatist who happened to agree with him the expression, “a good\r\nEuropean.” He meant a statesman who was capable of conceiving the\r\nstate-system of the western world as a whole. The events of August made\r\nthe chief minister of Austria now exclaim, “I see no longer any Europe.”\r\nAll the notions of alliance that had so much to do with the precipitation\r\nof the war were dissipated. Italy, so far from joining France, marched\r\ninto Rome. Austria ostentatiously informed England that she was free from\r\nengagements. The Czar of Russia was nephew of the Prussian king and German\r\nin his leanings, but Gortchakoff, his minister, was jealous of Bismarck,\r\nand his sympathies inclined to France, and Czar and minister alike nursed\r\ndesigns in the Black Sea. With such materials as these Mr. Pitt himself\r\nwith all his subsidies could not have constructed a fighting coalition.\r\nEven the sons of stricken France after the destruction of the empire were\r\na divided people. For side by side with national defence against the\r\ninvader, republican and monarchic propagandism was at work, internecine in\r\nits temper and scattering baleful seeds of civil war.\r\n\r\n“Many,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to Chevalier in September, “seem so\r\nover-sanguine as to suppose that it is in our power at any moment, by\r\nfriendly influence of reasoning, to solve the problem which has brought\r\ntogether in the shock of battle the two greatest military powers of\r\nEurope.... I do not see that it is an offence on our part not to interfere\r\nwhen the belligerents differ so widely, when we have not the hope of\r\nbringing them together, and when we cannot adopt without reserve the\r\nlanguage and claims of either.” Material responsibility and moral\r\nresponsibility both pointed to a rigid equity between the combatants, and\r\nto strict neutrality. The utmost to be done was to localise the war; and\r\nwith this aim, the British cabinet induced Italy, Austria, Russia, and\r\nsmaller powers to come to a common agreement that none of them would\r\ndepart from neutrality without a previous understanding with the rest.\r\nThis league of the neutrals, though negative, was at least a shadow of\r\ncollective action, from which good might come if the belligerents should\r\nsome day accept or invite mediation. To this diplomatic neutrality the\r\nonly alternative was an armed neutrality, and armed neutrality has not\r\nalways served pacific ends.\r\n\r\nTo the German contention at one stage after the overthrow of the empire,\r\nthat the Empress was still the only authority existing legally for France,\r\nMr. Gladstone was energetically opposed. “It embodied,” he said, “the\r\ndoctrine that no country can have a new government without the consent of\r\nthe old one.” “Ought we,” he asked Lord Granville (Sept. 20), “to witness\r\nin silence the promulgation of such a doctrine, which is utterly opposed\r\nto the modern notions of public right, though it was in vogue fifty years\r\nback, and though it was acted on with most fatal consequences by the\r\nPrussians of eighty years back?” Then as for mediation, whether isolated\r\nor in common, he saw no hope in it. He said to the Duke of Argyll (Sept.\r\n6), “I would not say a word ever so gently. I believe it would do great\r\nmischief. As at present advised, I see but two really safe grounds for\r\nmediation, (1) a drawn battle; (2) the request of both parties.” Ever\r\nsince 1862, and his error in the American war—so he now wrote to Lord\r\nGranville—“in forming and expressing an opinion that the Southerners had\r\nvirtually established their independence, I have been very fearful of\r\ngiving opinions with regard to the proper course of foreign nations to\r\npursue in junctures, of which, after all, I think they have better means\r\nof forming a judgment than foreigners can possess.”\r\n\r\nIn the middle of September Thiers, in the course of his valiant mission to\r\nEuropean courts, reached London. “Yesterday,” Mr. Gladstone writes (Sept.\r\n14), “I saw Thiers and had a long conversation with him; he was very clear\r\nand touching in parts. But the purpose of his mission is vague. He seems\r\ncome to do just what he can.” The vagueness of Thiers did but mirror the\r\ndistractions of France. Not even from his ingenious, confident, and\r\nfertile mind could men hope for a clue through the labyrinth of European\r\nconfusions. Great Britain along with four other powers recognised the new\r\ngovernment of the Republic in France at the beginning of February 1871.\r\n\r\n(M111) It was about this time that Mr. Gladstone took what was for a prime\r\nminister the rather curious step of volunteering an anonymous article in a\r\nreview, upon these great affairs in which his personal responsibility was\r\nboth heavy and direct.(219) The precedent can hardly be called a good one,\r\nfor as anybody might have known, the veil was torn aside in a few hours\r\nafter the _Edinburgh Review_ containing his article appeared. Its object,\r\nhe said afterwards, was “to give what I thought needful information on a\r\nmatter of great national importance, which involved at the time no\r\ninterest of party whatever. If such interests had been involved, a rule\r\nfrom which I have never as a minister diverted would have debarred me from\r\nwriting.” Lord Granville told him that, “It seemed to be an admirable\r\nargument, the more so as it is the sort of thing Thiers ought to have said\r\nand did not.” The article made a great noise, as well it might, for it was\r\nwritten with much eloquence, truth, and power, and was calculated to\r\nconsole his countrymen for seeing a colossal European conflict going on,\r\nwithout the privilege of a share in it. One passage about happy\r\nEngland—happy especially that the wise dispensation of Providence had cut\r\nher off by the streak of silver sea from continental dangers—rather\r\nirritated than convinced. The production of such an article under such\r\ncircumstances was a striking illustration of Mr. Gladstone’s fervid\r\ndesire—the desire of a true orator’s temperament—to throw his eager mind\r\nupon a multitude of men, to spread the light of his own urgent conviction,\r\nto play the part of missionary with a high evangel, which had been his\r\nearliest ideal forty years before. Everybody will agree that it was better\r\nto have a minister writing his own articles in a respectable quarterly,\r\nthan doctoring other people’s articles with concomitants from a reptile\r\nfund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the vital question of the annexation of Alsace and Lorraine, Mr.\r\nGladstone’s view was easy to anticipate. He could not understand how the\r\nFrench protests turned more upon the inviolability of French soil, than on\r\nthe attachment of the people of Alsace and North Lorraine to their\r\ncountry. The abstract principle he thought peculiarly awkward in a nation\r\nthat had made recent annexations of her own. Upon all his correspondents\r\nat home and abroad, he urged that the question ought to be worked on the\r\nbasis of the sentiments of the people concerned, and not upon the\r\nprinciple of inviolability. He composed an elaborate memorandum for the\r\ncabinet, but without effect. On the last day of September, he records:\r\n“_Sept. 30_: Cabinet 2-1/4-6. I failed in my two objects. 1. An effort to\r\nspeak with the other neutral Powers against the transfer of Alsace and\r\nLorraine without reference to the populations. 2. Immediate release of\r\nFenian prisoners.”\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Bright, who was still prevented by illness from attending cabinets,\r\nand who had the second of the two objects much at heart, he wrote the next\r\nday:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I send for your private perusal the enclosed mem. which I proposed\r\n    to the cabinet yesterday, but could not induce them to adopt. It\r\n    presupposes the concurrence of the neutral Powers. They agreed in\r\n    the opinions, but did not think the expression of them timely. My\r\n    opinion certainly is that the transfer of territory and\r\n    inhabitants by mere force calls for the reprobation of Europe, and\r\n    that Europe is entitled to utter it, and can utter it with good\r\n    effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ground taken by him in the cabinet was as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    A matter of this kind cannot be regarded as in principle a\r\n    question between the two belligerents only, but involves\r\n    considerations of legitimate interest to all the Powers of Europe.\r\n    It appears to bear on the Belgian question in particular. It is\r\n    also a principle likely to be of great consequence in the eventual\r\n    settlement of the Eastern question. Quite apart from the subject\r\n    of mediation, it cannot be right that the neutral Powers should\r\n    remain silent, while this principle of consulting the wishes of\r\n    the population is trampled down, should the actual sentiment of\r\n    Alsace and Lorraine be such as to render that language applicable.\r\n    The mode of expressing any view of this matter is doubtless a\r\n    question requiring much consideration. The decision of the cabinet\r\n    was that the time for it had not yet come. Any declaration in the\r\n    sense described would, Mr. Gladstone thought, entail, in fairness,\r\n    an obligation to repudiate the present claim of France to obtain\r\n    peace without surrendering “either an inch of her territory or a\r\n    stone of her fortresses.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bright did not agree with him, but rather favoured the principle of\r\ninviolability. In November Mr. Gladstone prepared a still more elaborate\r\nmemorandum in support of a protest from the neutral Powers. The Duke of\r\nArgyll put what was perhaps the general view when he wrote to Mr.\r\nGladstone (Nov. 25, 1870), “that he had himself never argued in favour of\r\nthe German annexation of Alsace and Lorraine, but only against our having\r\nany right to oppose it otherwise than by the most friendly dissuasion.”\r\nThe Duke held that the consent of populations to live under a particular\r\ngovernment is a right subject to a great many qualifications, and it would\r\nnot be easy to turn such a doctrine into the base of an official\r\nremonstrance. After all, he said, the instincts of nations stand for\r\nsomething in this world. The German did not exceed the ancient\r\nacknowledged right of nations in successful wars, when he said to Alsace\r\nand Lorraine, “Conquest in a war forced upon me by the people of which you\r\nform a part, gives me the _right_ to annex, if on other grounds I deem it\r\nexpedient, and for strategic reasons I do so deem it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, notwithstanding his cabinet, held to his view energetically\r\nexpressed as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    If the contingency happen, not very probable, of a sudden\r\n    accommodation which shall include the throttling of Alsace and\r\n    part of Lorraine, without any voice previously raised against it,\r\n    it will in my opinion be a standing reproach to England. There is\r\n    indeed the Russian plan of not recognising that in which we have\r\n    had no part; but it is difficult to say what this comes to.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 20 he says to Lord Granville what we may take for a last word\r\non this part of the case: “While I more and more feel the deep culpability\r\nof France, I have an apprehension that this violent laceration and\r\ntransfer is to lead us from bad to worse, and to be the _beginning_ of a\r\nnew series of European complications.”\r\n\r\nWhile working in the spirit of cordial and even eager loyalty to the prime\r\nminister, Lord Granville disagreed with him upon the question of\r\ndiplomatic action against annexation. Palmerston, he said to Mr. Gladstone\r\nin October, “wasted the strength derived by England by the great war by\r\nhis brag. I am afraid of our wasting that which we at present derive from\r\nmoral causes, by laying down general principles when nobody will attend to\r\nthem, and when in all probability they will be disregarded. My objection\r\nto doing at present what you propose is, that it is impossible according\r\nto my views to do so without being considered to throw our weight into the\r\nFrench scale against Germany, with consequent encouragement on one side\r\nand irritation on the other.”\r\n\r\nLike Thiers, Mr. Gladstone had been leaning upon the concurrence of the\r\nneutral Powers, and active co-operation at St. Petersburg. Russian objects\r\nwere inconsistent with the alienation of Germany, and they made a fatal\r\nbar to all schemes for lowering the German terms. This truth of the\r\nsituation was suddenly brought home to England in no palatable way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI. The Black Sea. (1870-1871)\r\n\r\n\r\n    “You are always talking to me of principles. As if your public law\r\n    were anything to me; I do not know what it means. What do you\r\n    suppose that all your parchments and your treaties signify to me?”\r\n\r\n    —ALEXANDER I. To TALLEYRAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Crimean war in 1856 by the provisions of the treaty of\r\nParis, Russia and Turkey were restrained from constructing arsenals on the\r\ncoast of the Euxine, and from maintaining ships of war on its waters. No\r\nserious statesman believed that the restriction would last, any more than\r\nNapoleon’s restraint on Prussia in 1808 against keeping up an army of more\r\nthan forty thousand men could last. Palmerston had this neutralisation\r\nmore at heart than anybody else, and Lord Granville told the House of\r\nLords what durability Palmerston expected for it:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    General Ignatieff told me that he remarked to Lord Palmerston,\r\n    “These are stipulations which you cannot expect will last long,”\r\n    and Lord Palmerston replied, “They will last ten years.” A learned\r\n    civilian, a great friend of mine, told me he heard Lord Palmerston\r\n    talk on the subject, and say, “Well, at all events they will last\r\n    my life.” A noble peer, a colleague of mine, an intimate friend of\r\n    Lord Palmerston, says Lord Palmerston told him they would last\r\n    seven years.(220)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Mr. Gladstone declared his opinion, afterwards often repeated,\r\nthat the neutralisation of the Black Sea, popular as it might be in\r\nEngland at the moment, was far from being a satisfactory arrangement.(221)\r\nWere the time to come, he said, when Russia might resume aggressive\r\nschemes on Turkey, he believed that neutralisation would mean nothing but\r\na series of pitfalls much deeper than people expected.(222) These pitfalls\r\nnow came into full view. On the last day of October Prince Gortchakoff\r\naddressed a circular to the Powers, announcing that his imperial master\r\ncould “no longer consider himself bound to the terms of the treaty of\r\nMarch 1856, in so far as these limit his rights of sovereignty in the\r\nBlack Sea.” On the merits there was very little real dispute in Europe. As\r\nLord Granville once wrote to Mr. Gladstone: “There was no doubt about\r\nGermany having at Paris, and subsequently, always taken the Russian view.\r\nFrance made an intimation to the same effect very soon after the\r\nconclusion of the treaty. And Austria later. Italy did the same, but not\r\nin so decided a manner.... I have frequently said in public that with the\r\nexception of ourselves and the Turks, all the co-signatories of the treaty\r\nof Paris had expressed views in favour of modifying the article, previous\r\nto Prince Gortchakoff’s declaration.”(223)\r\n\r\n(M112) To have a good case on the merits was one thing, and to force it at\r\nthe sword’s point was something extremely different. As Mr. Gladstone put\r\nit in a memorandum that became Lord Granville’s despatch, “the question\r\nwas not whether any desire expressed by Russia ought to be carefully\r\nexamined in a friendly spirit by the co-signatory powers, but whether they\r\nare to accept from her an announcement that by her own act, without any\r\nconsent from them, she has released herself from a solemn covenant.”(224)\r\nMr. Gladstone, not dissenting on the substance of the Russian claim, was\r\noutraged by the form. The only parallel he ever found to Gortchakoff’s\r\nproceedings in 1870 was a certain claim, of which we shall soon see\r\nsomething, made by America in 1872. “I have had half an idea,” he wrote to\r\nLord Granville, “that it might be well I should see Brunnow [the Russian\r\nambassador] either with you or alone. All know the mischief done by the\r\nRussian idea of Lord Aberdeen, and the opposition are in the habit of\r\nstudiously representing me as his double, or his heir in pacific\r\ntraditions. This I do not conceive to be true, and possibly I might\r\nundeceive Brunnow a little.”\r\n\r\nIn this country, as soon as the news of the circular was made known, the\r\npublic excitement was intense. Consols instantly dropped heavily. Apart\r\nfrom the form of the Russian claim, the public still alert upon the\r\neastern question, felt that the question was once more alive. As Mr.\r\nGladstone had said to Lord Granville (Oct. 4, 1870), “Everybody at a time\r\nlike this looks out for booty; it will be hard to convince central Europe\r\nthat Turkey is not a fair prize.” From France Lord Lyons wrote to Mr.\r\nGladstone (Nov. 14) that the Russian declaration was looked upon with\r\ncomplacency, because it might lead to a congress, and at all events it\r\nmight, by causing a stir among the neutrals, give a check to Prussia as\r\nwell as to Russia.\r\n\r\nLord Granville wrote to Mr. Gladstone, who was at Hawarden (Nov. 21):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am very sorry to hear that you are not well. Of course, you must\r\n    run no risk, but as soon as you can you will, I hope, come up and\r\n    have a cabinet. Childers has been here. He tells me there is a\r\n    perfect howl about ministers not meeting. He is more quiet in his\r\n    talk than I hear some of our colleagues are. But he says if there\r\n    is to be war, every day lost is most injurious. I have told him\r\n    that it is impossible to say that we may not be driven into it by\r\n    Russia, or by other foreign powers, or by our own people; that we\r\n    must take care of our dignity; but if there ever was a cabinet\r\n    which is bound not to drift into an unnecessary war, it is ours.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone replied next day:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I will frankly own that I am much disgusted with a good deal of\r\n    the language that I have read in the newspapers within the last\r\n    few days about immediate war with Russia. I try to put a check on\r\n    myself to prevent the reaction it engenders. Your observation on\r\n    drifting into war is most just: though I always thought\r\n    Clarendon’s epithet in this one case inapplicable as well as\r\n    unadvisable. I know, however, nothing more like drifting into war\r\n    than would be a resort to any military measures whatever, except\r\n    with reference either to some actual fact or some well defined\r\n    contingency....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe courses open to the British Government in the face of the circular\r\nwere these. They might silently or with a protest acquiesce. Or they might\r\ndeclare an offensive war (much deprecated by Turkey herself) against a\r\nnation that had peculiar advantages for defence, and for an object that\r\nevery other signatory power thought in itself a bad object. Third, they\r\nmight, in accordance with a wonderfully grand scheme suggested to\r\nministers, demand from Germany, all flushed as she was with military\r\npride, to tell us plainly whether she was on our side or Russia’s; and if\r\nthe German answer did not please us, then we should make an offensive\r\nalliance with France, Austria, Italy, and Turkey checking Russia in the\r\neast and Germany in the west. A fourth plan was mutely to wait, on the\r\nplea that whatever Russia might have said, nothing had been done. The\r\nfifth plan was a conference. This was hardly heroic enough to please\r\neverybody in the cabinet. At least it saved us from the insanity of a war\r\nthat would have intensified European confusion, merely to maintain\r\nrestraints considered valuable by nobody. The expedient of a conference\r\nwas effectively set in motion by Bismarck, then pre-occupied in his\r\ncritical Bavarian treaty and the siege of Paris. On November 12, Mr. Odo\r\nRussell left London for Versailles on a special mission to the Prussian\r\nking. The intrepidity of our emissary soon secured a remarkable success,\r\nand the episode of Bismarck’s intervention in the business was important.\r\n\r\n(M113) Mr. Odo Russell had three hours’ conversation with Count Bismarck\r\non November 21. Bismarck told him that the Russian circular had taken him\r\nby surprise; that though he had always thought the treaty of 1856 too hard\r\nupon Russia, he entirely disapproved both of the manner and time chosen\r\nfor forcing on a revision of it; that he could not interfere nor even\r\nanswer the circular, but to prevent the outbreak of another war he would\r\nrecommend conferences at Constantinople.(225) The conversation broke off\r\nat four o’clock in the afternoon, with this unpromising cast. At ten in\r\nthe evening it was resumed; it was prolonged until half an hour beyond\r\nmidnight. “I felt I knew him better,” Mr. Russell in an unofficial letter\r\ntells Lord Granville (Nov. 30), “and could express more easily all that I\r\nhad determined to say to convince him that unless he could get Russia to\r\nwithdraw the circular, we should be compelled with or without allies to go\r\nto war.” Bismarck remained long obstinate in his professed doubts of\r\nEngland going to war; but he gradually admitted the truth of the\r\nconsequences to which a pacific acceptance of “the Russian kick must\r\ninevitably lead. And so he came round to the British point of view, and\r\nfelt that in our place he could not recede.”\r\n\r\nIt was not hard to see Bismarck’s interests. The mischief to Germany of\r\nanother European war before Paris had fallen; the moral support to be\r\nderived by the Tours government from a revival of the old Anglo-French\r\nalliance; the chances of Beust and other persons fishing in the troubled\r\nwaters of an extended European conflict; the vital importance of peace to\r\nthe reconstruction of Germany—these were the disadvantages to his own\r\ncountry and policy, of a war between England and Russia; these worked the\r\nchange in his mind between afternoon and midnight, and led him to support\r\nthe cause of England and peace against Gortchakoff and his circular.\r\nCharacteristically, at the same time he strove hard to drive a bargain\r\nwith the English agent, and to procure some political advantages in\r\nexchange for his moral support. “In politics,” he said, “one hand should\r\nwash the other” (_eine Hand die andere waschen muss_). In Mr. Odo Russell,\r\nhowever, he found a man who talked the language, kept the tone and was\r\nalive to all the arts of diplomatic business, and no handwashing followed.\r\nWhen Mr. Russell went to his apartment in the Place Hoche at Versailles\r\nthat night, he must have felt that he had done a good day’s work.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, papers were laid before parliament, and attention\r\nwas drawn to the language used by Mr. Russell to Bismarck, in the pregnant\r\nsentence about the question being of a nature in its present state to\r\ncompel us with or without allies, to go to war with Russia.(226) Mr.\r\nGladstone, when directly challenged, replied (Feb. 16) that the agent had\r\nused this argument without specific authority or instruction from the\r\ngovernment, but that the duty of diplomatic agents required them to\r\nexpress themselves in the mode in which they think they can best support\r\nthe proposition of which they wish to procure acceptance. Mr. Odo Russell\r\nexplained to Mr. Gladstone (Feb. 27) that he was led to use the argument\r\nabout England being compelled to go to war with or without allies by these\r\nreasons: that we were bound by a definite treaty to regard any\r\nretractation of the stipulations of March 30, 1856, as a cause of\r\nwar;(227) that Gortchakoff’s assumption of a right to renounce provisions\r\ndirectly touching Russian interests seemed to carry with it the assumption\r\nof a right to renounce all the rest of the treaty; that Mr. Gladstone’s\r\ngovernment had declared (Nov. 10) that it was impossible to sanction the\r\ncourse announced by Gortchakoff; that, therefore, France being otherwise\r\nengaged, and Austria being unprepared, we might be compelled by our joint\r\nand several obligations under the tripartite treaty, to go to war with\r\nRussia for proceedings that we pronounced ourselves unable to sanction;\r\nfinally, that he had never been instructed to state to Prussia, that the\r\nquestion was not one compelling us ever to go to war, notwithstanding our\r\ntreaty engagements. What was Mr. Gladstone’s reply to this I do not find,\r\nbut Lord Granville had very sensibly written to him some weeks before\r\n(Dec. 8, 1870):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am afraid our whole success has been owing to the belief that we\r\n    would go to war, and to tell the truth, I think that war in some\r\n    shape or other, sooner or later, was a possible risk after our\r\n    note. In any case, I would reassure nobody now. Promising peace is\r\n    as unwise as to threaten war. A sort of instinct that the bumps of\r\n    combativeness and destructiveness are to be found somewhere in\r\n    your head, has helped us much during the last five months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M114) Having undertaken to propose a conference, Bismarck did the best he\r\ncould for it. The British cabinet accepted on condition that the\r\nconference was not to open with any previous assumption of Gortchakoff’s\r\ndeclaration, and they objected to Petersburg as the scene of operations.\r\nMr. Gladstone in some notes prepared for the meeting of his colleagues\r\n(Nov. 26), was very firm on the first and main point, that “Her Majesty’s\r\ngovernment could enter into no conference which should assume any portion\r\nof the treaty to have been already abrogated by the discretion of a single\r\nPower, and it would be wholly out of place for them, under the present\r\ncircumstances, to ask for a conference, as they were not the parties who\r\ndesire to bring about any change in the treaty.” Russia made difficulties,\r\nbut Bismarck’s influence prevailed. The conference assembled not at\r\nPetersburg but in London, and subject to no previous assumption as to its\r\nresults.(228)\r\n\r\nThe close of a negotiation is wont to drop the curtain over embarrassments\r\nthat everybody is glad to forget;(229) but the obstacles to an exact\r\nagreement were not easily overcome. Lord Granville told Mr. Gladstone that\r\nno fewer than thirteen or fourteen versions of the most important protocol\r\nwere tried before terms were reached. In the end Lord Granville’s\r\nconclusion was that, as no just rights had been sacrificed, it was a\r\npositive advantage that Russia should be gratified by the removal of\r\nrestraints naturally galling to her pride.\r\n\r\nThe conference opened at the foreign office on Dec. 17, and held its final\r\nmeeting on March 13. Delay was caused by the difficulty of procuring the\r\nattendance of a representative of France. Jules Favre was appointed by the\r\ngovernment at Bordeaux, but he was locked up in Paris, and he and Bismarck\r\ncould not agree as to the proper form of safe-conduct. What was even more\r\nimportant, the governing men in France could not agree upon his\r\ninstructions; for we must remember that all this time along with the\r\npatriotic struggle against the Prussians, there went on an internal\r\nstruggle only a degree less ardent between republicans and monarchists. It\r\nwas not until the final meeting of the conference, that the Duc de Broglie\r\nwas accredited as representative of his country.(230) At the first formal\r\nmeeting a special protocol was signed recording it as “an essential\r\nprinciple of the law of nations that no Power can liberate itself from the\r\nengagements of a treaty, nor modify the stipulations thereof, unless with\r\nthe consent of the contracting Powers by means of an amicable\r\narrangement.”\r\n\r\nTo give a single signatory Power the right of forbidding a change desired\r\nby all the others, imposes a kind of perpetuity on treaty stipulations,\r\nthat in practice neither could nor ought to be insisted upon. For instance\r\nit would have tied fast the hands of Cavour and Victor Emmanuel in the\r\nItalian transactions which Mr. Gladstone had followed and assisted with so\r\nmuch enthusiasm, for Austria would never have assented. It is, moreover,\r\ntrue that in the ever recurring eras when force, truculent and unabashed,\r\nsweeps aside the moral judgments of the world, the mere inscription of a\r\npious opinion in a protocol may seem worth little trouble. Yet it is the\r\ninfluence of good opinion, tardy, halting, stumbling, and broken, as it\r\nmust ever be, that upholds and quickens the growth of right. The good\r\nrules laid down in conferences and state-papers may look tame in the glare\r\nof the real world of history as it is. Still, if we may change the figure,\r\nthey help to dilute the poisons in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M115) In England opinion veered round after Sedan. The disappearance of\r\nthe French empire had effectively dispelled the vivid suspicions of\r\naggression. The creation of the empire of a united Germany showed a new\r\nEurope. The keen word of an English diplomatist expressed what was dawning\r\nin men’s minds as a new misgiving. “Europe,” he said, “has lost a mistress\r\nand got a master.” Annexation wore an ugly look. Meetings to express\r\nsympathy with France in her struggle were held in London and the\r\nprovinces. Still on the whole the general verdict seemed to be decisively\r\nin favour of a resolute neutrality, for in fact, nobody who knew anything\r\nof the state of Europe could suggest a policy of British intervention that\r\nwould stand an hour of debate.\r\n\r\nOne proposal favoured by Mr. Gladstone, and also, I remember, commended by\r\nMill, was the military neutralisation of Alsace and Lorraine, and the\r\ndismantling of the great border fortresses, without withdrawing the\r\ninhabitants from their French allegiance. The idea was worked out in a\r\npamphlet by Count Gasparin. On this pamphlet Mr. Max Müller put what Mr.\r\nGladstone called the fair question, whether its author was likely to\r\npersuade the European powers to guarantee border neutrality. “I will try\r\nto give you a fair answer,” Mr. Gladstone said (Jan. 30, 1871). “You will\r\nnot think it less fair because it is individual and unofficial; for a man\r\nmust be a wretch indeed, who could speak at this most solemn juncture,\r\notherwise than from the bottom of his heart. First, then, I agree with you\r\nin disapproving the declaration, or reputed declaration, of Lord Derby\r\n(then Stanley) in 1867, about the Luxemburg guarantee. I have in\r\nparliament and in my present office, declined or expressly forborne to\r\nrecognise that declaration.(231) Secondly, as to the main question. It is\r\ngreat. It is difficult. But I should not despair. I may add I should\r\ndesire to find it practicable; for I think it would be a condition fair to\r\nboth parties, and one on which Germany would have an absolute title to\r\ninsist. Some of the most excusable errors ever committed,” he said, in\r\nclosing the letter, “have also been the most ruinous in their\r\nconsequences. The smallest in the forum of conscience, they are the\r\ngreatest in the vast theatre of action. May your country, justly indignant\r\nand justly exultant, be preserved from committing one of these errors.”\r\nThree months later, when all was at an end, he repeated the same thought:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The most fatal and in their sequel most gigantic errors of men are\r\n    also frequently the most excusable and the least gratuitous. They\r\n    are committed when a strong impetus of right carries them up to a\r\n    certain point, and a residue of that impetus, drawn from the\r\n    contact with human passion and infirmity, pushes them beyond it.\r\n    They vault into the saddle; they fall on the other side. The\r\n    instance most commonly present to my mind is the error of England\r\n    in entering the Revolutionary war in 1793. Slow sometimes to go\r\n    in, she is slower yet to come out, and if she had then held her\r\n    hand, the course of the revolution and the fate of Europe would in\r\n    all likelihood have been widely different. There might have been\r\n    no Napoleon. There might have been no Sedan.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe changes in the political map effected by these dire months of\r\ndiplomacy and war were almost comparable in one sense to those of the\r\ntreaty of Münster, or the treaty of the Pyrenees, or the treaties of\r\nVienna, save that those great instruments all left a consolidated Europe.\r\nItaly had crowned her work by the acquisition of Rome. Russia had wiped\r\nout the humiliation of 1856. Prussia, after three wars in six years, had\r\nconquered the primacy of a united Germany. Austria had fallen as Prussia\r\nrose. France had fallen, but she had shaken off a government that had no\r\nroot in the noblest qualities of her people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII. “Day’s Work Of A Giant”. (1870-1872)\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have not been an idle government. We have had an active life,\r\n    and that is substantially one of the conditions of a happy\r\n    life.... I am thankful to have been the leader of the liberal\r\n    party at a period of the history of this country, when it has been\r\n    my privilege and my duty to give the word of advance to able\r\n    coadjutors and trusty and gallant adherents.—GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most marked administrative performance of Mr. Gladstone’s great\r\ngovernment was the reform and reorganisation of the army. In Mr. Cardwell\r\nhe was fortunate enough to have a public servant of the first order; not a\r\npolitical leader nor a popular orator, but one of the best disciples of\r\nPeel’s school; sound, careful, active, firm, and with an enlightened and\r\nindependent mind admirably fitted for the effective despatch of business.\r\nBefore he had been a month at the war office, the new secretary of state\r\nsubmitted to Mr. Gladstone his ideas of a plan that would give us an\r\neffective force for defence at a greatly reduced cost. The reorganisation\r\nof the army was one of the results of that great central event, from which\r\nin every direction such momentous consequences flowed—the victory of\r\nPrussian arms at Sadowa. The victory was a surprise, for even Lord Clyde,\r\nafter a close inspection of the Prussian army, had found no more to report\r\nthan that it was a first-rate militia. Sadowa disclosed that a soldier,\r\nserving only between two and three years with the colours, could yet show\r\nhimself the most formidable combatant in Europe. The principle of\r\nCardwell’s plan was that short enlistment is essential to a healthy\r\norganisation of the army, and this reform it was that produced an\r\nefficient reserve, the necessity for which had been one of the lessons of\r\nthe Crimean war. A second, but still a highly important element, was the\r\nreduction of the whole force serving in the colonies from fifty thousand\r\nmen to less than half that number.(232) “To this change,” said Mr.\r\nCardwell, “opposition will be weak, for the principle of colonial\r\nself-reliance is very generally assented to.” The idea, as Lord Wolseley\r\nsays, that a standing army during peace should be a manufactory for making\r\nsoldiers rather than either a costly receptacle for veterans, or a\r\ncollection of perfectly trained fighters, “had not yet taken, hold of the\r\nmilitary mind in England.”(233) The details do not concern us here, and\r\neverybody knows the revolution effected by the changes during Mr.\r\nGladstone’s great administration in the composition, the working, and the\r\nprofessional spirit of the army.\r\n\r\n(M116) Army reform first brought Mr. Gladstone into direct collision with\r\nreigning sentiment at court. In spite of Pym and Cromwell and the untoward\r\nend of Charles I. and other salutary lessons of the great rebellion, ideas\r\nstill lingered in high places that the sovereign’s hand bore the sword,\r\nand that the wearer of the crown through a commander-in-chief had rights\r\nof control over the army, not quite dependent on parliament and secretary\r\nof state. The Queen had doubted the policy of disestablishing the church\r\nin Ireland, but to disestablish the commander-in-chief came closer home,\r\nand was disliked as an invasion of the personal rights of the occupant of\r\nthe throne. This view was rather firmly pressed, and it was the first of a\r\nseries of difficulties—always to him extremely painful, perhaps more\r\npainful than any other—that Mr. Gladstone was called upon in his long\r\ncareer to overcome. The subject was one on which the temper of a reforming\r\nparliament allowed no compromise, even if the prime minister himself had\r\nbeen inclined to yield. As it was, by firmness, patience, and that tact\r\nwhich springs not from courtiership but from right feeling, he succeeded,\r\nand in the June of 1870 the Queen approved an order in council that put an\r\nend to the dual control of the army, defined the position of the\r\ncommander-in-chief, and removed him corporeally from the horse guards to\r\nthe war office in Pall Mall.(234) This, however, by no means brought all\r\nthe military difficulties to an end.\r\n\r\nOne particular incident has a conspicuous place on the political side of\r\nMr. Gladstone’s life. Among the elements in the scheme was the abolition\r\nof the practice of acquiring military rank by money purchase. Public\r\nopinion had been mainly roused by Mr. Trevelyan, who now first made his\r\nmark in that assembly where he was destined to do admirable work and\r\nachieve high eminence and popularity. An Act of George III. abolished\r\nselling of offices in other departments, but gave to the crown the\r\ndiscretion of retaining the practice in the army, if so it should seem\r\nfit. This discretion had been exercised by the issue of a warrant\r\nsanctioning and regulating that practice; commissions in the army were\r\nbought and sold for large sums of money, far in excess of the sums fixed\r\nby the royal warrant; and vested interests on a large scale grew up in\r\nconsequence. The substitution, instead of this abusive system, of\r\npromotion by selection, was one of the first steps in army reform. No\r\neffective reorganisation was possible without it. As Mr. Gladstone put it,\r\nthe nation must buy back its own army from its own officers. No other\r\nproceeding in the career of the ministry aroused a more determined and\r\nviolent opposition. It offended a powerful profession with a host of\r\nparliamentary friends; the officers disliked liberal politics, they rather\r\ndisdained a civilian master, and they fought with the vigour peculiar to\r\nirritated caste.\r\n\r\nThe first question before parliament depended upon the Commons voting the\r\nmoney to compensate officers who had acquired vested interests. If that\r\nwere secure, there was nothing to hinder the crown, in the discretion\r\ncommitted to it by the statute, from cancelling the old warrant. Instead\r\nof this, ministers determined to abolish purchase by bill. Obstruction was\r\nlong and sustained. The principle of the bill was debated and re-debated\r\non every amendment in committee, and Mr. Gladstone reported that “during\r\nhis whole parliamentary life, he had been accustomed to see class\r\ninterests of all kinds put themselves on their defence under the\r\nsupposition of being assailed, yet he had never seen a case where the\r\nmodes of operation adopted by the professing champions were calculated to\r\nleave such a painful impression on the mind.” Credible whispers were heard\r\nof the open hostility of high military personages. In one of the debates\r\nof this time upon the army (Mar. 23, 1871), speakers freely implied that\r\nthe influence of what was called the horse guards was actively adverse to\r\nreform. Mr. Gladstone, taking this point, laid it down that “military\r\nauthorities without impairing in the slightest degree the general\r\nindependence of their political opinions, should be in full harmony with\r\nthe executive as to the military plans and measures which it might\r\npropose; and that only on this principle could the satisfactory working of\r\nour institutions be secured.”\r\n\r\nThe correspondence with the Queen was copious. In one letter, after\r\nmentioning that parliament had been persuaded to extend the tenure of the\r\ncommander-in-chief’s office beyond five years, and to allow the patronage\r\nand discipline of the army to be vested in him, though the secretary of\r\nstate was responsible, Mr. Gladstone proceeds:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It would have been impossible to procure the acquiescence of\r\n    parliament in these arrangements, unless they had been accompanied\r\n    with the declaration of Mr. Cardwell, made in the name of the\r\n    cabinet, and seen and approved by your Majesty, that “it is of\r\n    course necessary for the commander-in-chief to be in harmony with\r\n    the government of the day” (Feb. 21, 1871), and with a similar\r\n    declaration of Mr. Gladstone on March 23, 1871, also reported to,\r\n    and approved by your Majesty, that while all political action\r\n    properly so called was entirely free, yet the military plans and\r\n    measures of the government must always have the energetic\r\n    co-operation of the military chiefs of the army.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M117) The end was of course inevitable.(235) The bill at last passed the\r\nCommons, and then an exciting stage began. In the Lords it was immediately\r\nconfronted by a dilatory resolution. In view of some such proceeding, Mr.\r\nGladstone (July 15) wrote to the Queen as to the best course to pursue,\r\nand here he first mentioned the step that was to raise such clamour:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    As the government judge that the illegality of over-regulation\r\n    prices cannot continue, and as they can only be extinguished by\r\n    putting an end to purchase, what has been chiefly considered is\r\n    how to proceed with the greatest certainty and the smallest shock,\r\n    and how to secure as far as may be for the officers all that has\r\n    hitherto been asked on their behalf. With this view, the\r\n    government think the first step would be to abolish the warrant\r\n    under which prices of commissions are fixed. As the resolution of\r\n    the House of Lords states the unwillingness of the House to take\r\n    part in abolishing purchase until certain things shall have been\r\n    done, it would not be applicable to a case in which, without its\r\n    interposition, purchase would have been already abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later (July 17) the Lords passed what Sir Roundell Palmer called\r\n“their ill-advised resolution.” On July 18 the cabinet met and resolved to\r\nrecommend the cancelling of the old warrant regulating purchase, by a new\r\nwarrant abolishing purchase. It has been said or implied that this\r\nproceeding was forced imperiously upon the Queen. I find no evidence of\r\nthis. In the language of Lord Halifax, the minister in attendance, writing\r\nto Mr. Gladstone from Osborne (July 19, 1871), the Queen “made no sort of\r\ndifficulty in signing the warrant” after the case had been explained. In\r\nthe course of the day she sent to tell Lord Halifax, that as it was a\r\nstrong exercise of her power in apparent opposition to the House of Lords,\r\nshe should like to have some more formal expression of the advice of the\r\ncabinet than was contained in an ordinary letter from the prime minister,\r\ndealing with this among other matters. Ministers agreed that the Queen had\r\na fair right to have their advice on such a point of executive action on\r\nher part, recorded in a formal and deliberate submission of their opinion.\r\nThe advice was at once clothed in the definite form of a minute.\r\n\r\nOn July 20 Mr. Gladstone announced to a crowded and anxious House the\r\nabolition of purchase by royal warrant. The government, he said, had no\r\nother object but simplicity and despatch, and the observance of\r\nconstitutional usage. Amid some disorderly interruptions, Mr. Disraeli\r\ntaunted the government with resorting to the prerogative of the crown to\r\nget out of a difficulty of their own devising. Some radicals used the same\r\nill-omened word. After a spell of obstruction on the ballot bill, the\r\nbitter discussion on purchase revived, and Mr. Disraeli said that what had\r\noccurred early in the evening was “disgraceful to the House of Commons,”\r\nand denounced “the shameful and avowed conspiracy of the cabinet” against\r\nthe House of Lords. The latter expression was noticed by the chairman of\r\ncommittee and withdrawn, though Mr. Gladstone himself thought it the more\r\nallowable of the two.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to his brother-in-law, Lord Lyttelton, Mr. Gladstone\r\nvindicated this transaction as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 26, ’71._—I should like to assure myself that you really\r\n    have the points of the case before you. 1. Was it not for us an\r\n    indispensable duty to extinguish a gross, wide-spread, and most\r\n    mischievous illegality, of which the existence had become certain\r\n    and notorious? 2. Was it not also our duty to extinguish it in the\r\n    best manner? 3. Was not the best manner that which, (_a_) made the\r\n    extinction final; (_b_) gave the best, _i.e._ a statutory, title\r\n    for regulation prices; (_c_) granted an indemnity to the officers;\r\n    (_d_) secured for them compensation in respect of over-regulation\r\n    prices? 4. Did not the vote of the House of Lords stop us in this\r\n    best manner of proceeding? 5. Did it absolve us from the duty of\r\n    putting an end to the illegality? 6. What method of putting an end\r\n    to it remained to us, except that which we have adopted?\r\n\r\n\r\n(M118) Sir Roundell Palmer wrote, “I have always thought and said that the\r\nissuing of such a warrant was within the undoubted power of the crown....\r\nIt did and does appear to me that the course which the government took was\r\nthe least objectionable course that could be taken under the whole\r\ncircumstances of the case.”(236) I can find nothing more clearly and more\r\nforcibly said upon this case than the judgment of Freeman, the historian—a\r\nman who combined in so extraordinary a degree immense learning with\r\nprecision in political thought and language, and added to both the true\r\nspirit of manly citizenship:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I must certainly protest against the word “prerogative” being\r\n    used, as it has so often been of late, to describe Mr. Gladstone’s\r\n    conduct with regard to the abolition of purchase in the army. By\r\n    prerogative I understand a power not necessarily contrary to law,\r\n    but in some sort beyond law—a power whose source must be sought\r\n    for somewhere else than in the terms of an act of parliament. But\r\n    in abolishing purchase by a royal warrant Mr. Gladstone acted\r\n    strictly within the terms of an act of parliament, an act so\r\n    modern as the reign of George III. He in truth followed a course\r\n    which that act not only allowed but rather suggested.... I am not\r\n    one of those who condemn Mr. Gladstone’s conduct in this matter;\r\n    still I grant that the thing had an ill look. The difference I\r\n    take to be this. Mr. Gladstone had two courses before him: he\r\n    might abolish purchase by a royal warrant—that is, by using the\r\n    discretion which parliament had given to the crown; or he might\r\n    bring a bill into parliament to abolish purchase.... What gave the\r\n    thing an ill look was that, having chosen the second way and not\r\n    being able to carry his point that way, he then fell back on the\r\n    first way. I believe that it was better to get rid of a foul abuse\r\n    in the way in which it was got rid of, than not to get rid of it\r\n    at all, especially as the House of Commons had already decided\r\n    against it. Still, the thing did not look well. It might seem that\r\n    by electing to bring a bill into parliament Mr. Gladstone had\r\n    waived his right to employ the royal power in the matter.... I\r\n    believe that this is one of those cases in which a strictly\r\n    conscientious man like Mr. Gladstone does things from which a less\r\n    conscientious man would shrink. Such a man, fully convinced of his\r\n    own integrity, often thinks less than it would be wise to think of\r\n    mere appearances, and so lays himself open to the imputation of\r\n    motives poles asunder from the real ones.(237)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese last words undoubtedly explain some acts and tendencies that gave a\r\nhandle to foes and perplexed friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nNext let us turn to reform in a different field. All the highest abstract\r\narguments were against secret voting. To have a vote is to have power; as\r\nBurke said, “liberty is power, when men act in bodies”; but the secret\r\nvote is power without responsibility. The vote is a trust for the\r\ncommonwealth; to permit secrecy makes it look like a right conferred for a\r\nman’s own benefit. You enjoin upon him to give his vote on public grounds;\r\nin the same voice you tell him not to let the public know how he gives it.\r\nSecrecy saps the citizen’s courage, promotes evasion, tempts to downright\r\nlying. Remove publicity and its checks, then all the mean motives of\r\nmankind—their malice, petty rivalries, pique, the prejudices that men\r\nwould be ashamed to put into words even to themselves—skulk to the polling\r\nbooth under a disguising cloak. Secrecy, again, prevents the statesman\r\nfrom weighing or testing the forces in character, stability, persistency,\r\nof the men by whom a majority has been built up, and on whose fidelity his\r\npower of action must depend. This strain of argument was worked out by J.\r\nS. Mill(238) and others, and drew from Mr. Bright, who belonged to a\r\ndifferent school of liberals, the gruff saying, that the worst of great\r\nthinkers is that they so often think wrong.\r\n\r\nThough the abstract reasoning might be unanswerable, the concrete case the\r\nother way was irresistible. Experience showed that without secrecy in its\r\nexercise the suffrage was not free. The farmer was afraid of his landlord,\r\nand the labourer was afraid of the farmer; the employer could tighten the\r\nscrew on the workman, the shopkeeper feared the power of his best\r\ncustomers, the debtor quailed before his creditor, the priest wielded\r\nthunderbolts over the faithful. Not only was the open vote not free; it\r\nexposed its possessor to so much bullying, molestation, and persecution,\r\nthat his possession came to be less of a boon than a nuisance.\r\n\r\n(M119) For forty years this question had been fought. The ballot actually\r\nfigured in a clause of an early draft of the Reform bill of 1832. Grote,\r\ninspired by James Mill whose vigorous pleas for the ballot in his\r\nwell-known article in 1830 were the high landmark in the controversy,\r\nbrought it before parliament in an annual motion. When that admirable man\r\nquitted parliament to finish his great history of Greece, the torch was\r\nstill borne onwards by other hands. Ballot was one of the five points of\r\nthe charter. At nearly every meeting for parliamentary reform between the\r\nCrimean war and Disraeli’s bill of 1867, the ballot was made a cardinal\r\npoint. General opinion fluctuated from time to time, and in the sixties\r\njournals of repute formally dismissed it as a dead political idea. The\r\nextension of the franchise in 1867 brought it to life again, and Mr.\r\nBright led the van in the election of 1868 by declaring in his address\r\nthat he regarded the ballot as of the first importance. “Whether I look,”\r\nhe said, “to the excessive cost of elections, or to the tumult which so\r\noften attends them, or to the unjust and cruel pressure which is so\r\nfrequently brought to bear upon the less independent class of voters, I am\r\npersuaded that the true interest of the public and of freedom will be\r\nserved by the system of secret and free voting.” J. S. Mill had argued\r\nthat the voter should name his candidate in the polling booth, just as the\r\njudge does his duty in a court open to the public eye. No, replied Bright,\r\nthe jury-room is as important as the judge’s bench, and yet the jury-room\r\nis treated as secret, and in some countries the verdict is formally given\r\nby ballot. Some scandals in the way of electoral intimidation did much to\r\nripen public opinion. One parliamentary committee in 1868 brought evidence\r\nof this sort to light, and another committee recommended secret voting as\r\nthe cure.\r\n\r\nAmong those most ardent for the change from open to secret voting, the\r\nprime minister was hardly to be included. “I am not aware,” he wrote to\r\nLord Shaftesbury (Dec. 11, 1871), “of having been at any time a vehement\r\nopponent of the ballot. I have not been accustomed to attach to it a vital\r\nimportance, but at any time, I think, within the last twenty or\r\ntwenty-five years I should have regarded it as the legitimate complement\r\nof the present suffrage.”(239) In the first speech he made as prime\r\nminister at Greenwich (Dec. 21, 1868) be said that there were two subjects\r\nthat could not be overlooked in connection with the representation of the\r\npeople. “One of them is the security afforded by the present system for\r\nperfect freedom in the giving of the vote, which vote has been not only\r\nnot conferred as a favour, but imposed as a duty by the legislature on the\r\nmembers of the community. I have at all times given my vote in favour of\r\nopen voting, but I have done so before, and I do so now, with an important\r\nreservation, namely, that whether by open voting or by whatsoever means,\r\nfree voting must be secured.”\r\n\r\nA bill providing for vote by ballot, abolishing public nominations and\r\ndealing with corrupt practices in parliamentary elections was introduced\r\nby Lord Hartington in 1870. Little progress was made with it, and it was\r\neventually withdrawn. But the government were committed to the principle,\r\nand at the end of July Mr. Gladstone took the opportunity of explaining\r\nhis change of opinion on this question, in the debate on the second\r\nreading of a Ballot bill brought in by a private member. Now that great\r\nnumbers who depended for their bread upon their daily labour had acquired\r\nthe vote, he said, their freedom was threatened from many quarters. The\r\nsecret vote appeared to be required by the social conditions under which\r\nthey lived, and therefore it had become a necessity and a duty to give\r\neffect to the principle.\r\n\r\n(M120) Yet after the cabinet had decided to make the ballot a ministerial\r\nmeasure, the head of the cabinet makes a rather pensive entry in his\r\ndiary: “_July 27, 1870._—H. of C. Spoke on ballot, and voted in 324-230\r\nwith mind satisfied, and as to feeling, a lingering reluctance.” How far\r\nthis reluctance was due to misgivings on the merits of the ballot, how far\r\nto the doubts that haunt every ministerial leader as to the possibilities\r\nof parliamentary time, we do not know. The bill, enlarged and reintroduced\r\nnext year, was entrusted to the hands of Mr. Forster—himself, like Mr.\r\nGladstone, a latish convert to the principle of secret voting—and by\r\nForster’s persistent force and capacity for hard and heavy labour, after\r\nsome eighteen days in committee, it passed through the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nAfter obstruction had been at last broken down, other well-known resources\r\nof civilisation remained, and the Lords threw out the bill.(240) It was\r\nnovel, they said; it was dangerous, it had not been considered by the\r\ncountry or parliament (after eighteen days of committee and forty years of\r\npublic discussion), it was incoherent and contradictory, and to enact vote\r\nby ballot was inevitably to overthrow the monarchy. Even the mightiest of\r\nAmerican orators had said as much. “Above all things,” Daniel Webster had\r\nadjured Lord Shaftesbury, “resist to the very last the introduction of the\r\nballot; for as a republican, I tell you that the ballot can never co-exist\r\nwith monarchical institutions.”\r\n\r\nThe rejection by the Lords stimulated popular insistence. At Whitby in the\r\nautumn (Sept. 2), Mr. Gladstone said the people’s bill had been passed by\r\nthe people’s House, and when it was next presented at the door of the\r\nHouse of Lords, it would be with an authoritative knock. He told Lord\r\nHoughton that he was sorry to see the agitation apparently rising against\r\nthe House of Lords, though he had a strong opinion about the imprudence of\r\nits conduct on the Army bill, and especially on the Ballot bill. “There is\r\nno Duke of Wellington in these days. His reputation as a domestic\r\nstatesman seems to me to rest almost entirely on his leadership of the\r\npeers between 1832 and 1841.”\r\n\r\nThe bill was again passed through the Commons in 1872. Mr. Gladstone was\r\nprepared for strong measures. The cabinet decided that if the House of\r\nLords should hold to what the prime minister styled “the strange provision\r\nfor optional secrecy,” the government would withdraw the bill and try an\r\nautumn session, and if the Lords still hardened their hearts, “there would\r\nremain nothing but the last alternative to consider,”—these words, I\r\nassume, meaning a dissolution. Perhaps the opposition thought that a\r\ndissolution on the ballot might give to the ministerial Antæus fresh\r\nenergy. This time the Lords gave way, satisfied that the Measure had now\r\nat last been more adequately discussed,—the said discussion really\r\nconsisting in no more than an adequate amount of violent language out of\r\ndoors against the principle of a hereditary legislature.(241)\r\n\r\nThe results of the general election two years later as they affected\r\nparty, are an instructive comment on all this trepidation and alarm. In\r\none only of the three kingdoms the ballot helped to make a truly vital\r\ndifference; it dislodged the political power of the Irish landlord. In\r\nEngland its influence made for purity, freedom, and decency, but it\r\ndeveloped no new sources of liberal strength. On this aspect of things the\r\nfirst parliamentary precursor of the ballot made remarks that are worth a\r\nfew lines of digression. “You will feel great satisfaction,” his wife said\r\nto Grote one morning at their breakfast, “at seeing your once favourite\r\nmeasure triumph over all obstacles.” “Since the wide expansion of the\r\nvoting element,” the historian replied, “I confess that the value of the\r\nballot has sunk in my estimation. I don’t, in fact, think the elections\r\nwill be affected by it one way or another, as far as party interests are\r\nconcerned.” “Still,” his interlocutor persisted, “you will at all events\r\nget at the genuine preference of the constituency.” “No doubt; but then,\r\nagain, I have come to perceive that the choice between one man and another\r\namong the English people, signifies less than I used formerly to think it\r\ndid. The English mind is much of one pattern, take whatsoever class you\r\nwill. The same favourite prejudices, amiable and otherwise; the same\r\nantipathies, coupled with ill-regulated though benevolent efforts to\r\neradicate human evils, are well-nigh universal. A House of Commons cannot\r\nafford to be above its own constituencies in intelligence, knowledge, or\r\npatriotism.”(242) In all this the element of truth is profound enough. In\r\nevery change of political machinery the reformer promises and expects a\r\nnew heaven and a new earth; then standing forces of national tradition,\r\ncharacter, and institution assert their strength, our millennium lags, and\r\nthe chilled enthusiast sighs. He is unreasonable, as are all those who\r\nexpect more from life and the world than life and the world have to give.\r\nYet here at least the reformer has not failed. The efficacy of secret\r\nvoting is negative if we will, but it averts obvious mischiefs alike from\r\nold privileged orders in states and churches and from new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M121) In finance the country looked for wonders. Ministers were called\r\nthe cabinet of financiers. The cabinet did, in fact, contain as many as\r\nfive men who were at one time or another chancellors of the exchequer, and\r\nits chief was recognised through Europe as the most successful financier\r\nof the age. No trailing cloud of glory, as in 1853 or 1860, attended the\r\ngreat ministry, but sound and substantial results were achieved,\r\ntestifying to a thrifty and skilful management, such as might have\r\nsatisfied the ambition of a generation of chancellors. The head of the new\r\ngovernment promised retrenchment as soon as the government was formed. He\r\ntold his constituents at Greenwich (Dec. 21, 1868) that he was himself\r\nresponsible for having taken the earliest opportunity of directing the\r\npublic mind to the subject of expenditure at an opening stage of the late\r\nelection; for “although there may be times when the public mind may become\r\ncomparatively relaxed in regard to the general principles of economy and\r\nthrift, it is the special duty of public men to watch the very beginnings\r\nof evil in that department. It is a very easy thing to notice these\r\nmischiefs when they have grown to a gigantic size; but it commonly happens\r\nthat when financial error has arisen to those dimensions, the case has\r\nbecome too aggravated for a remedy.” He reminded them of the addition that\r\nhad been made to the standing charges of the country in the ordinary and\r\nsteadily recurring annual estimates presented to parliament. He said that\r\nhe knew no reason why three millions should have been added during the two\r\nyears of tory government to the cost of our establishments:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is one thing, I am very well aware, to put on three millions;\r\n    it is another thing to take them off. When you put three millions\r\n    on to the public expenditure, you create a number of new\r\n    relations, a number of new offices, a number of new claims, a\r\n    number of new expectations. And you can’t, and what is more, you\r\n    ought not to, destroy all these in a moment. And, therefore, the\r\n    work of retrenchment must be a well-considered and a gradual work.\r\n    But I ask you to look at the names of the men who have been,\r\n    placed in charge of the great spending departments of the country.\r\n    The study, the idea that has governed the formation of the present\r\n    administration has been to place able and upright men in charge of\r\n    the public purse—men of administrative experience, men of proved\r\n    ability, men, lastly, holding their seats in the House of Commons,\r\n    and, therefore, immediately responsible to the representatives of\r\n    the people. It would not become me to promise what we can do; but\r\n    this I can tell you, that my friends connected with the various\r\n    departments most concerned in the public expenditure have, even\r\n    before the early moment at which I speak, directed their very\r\n    first attention to this subject, and that I, for one, shall be as\r\n    deeply disappointed as you can be, if in the estimates which it\r\n    will be our duty to present in February you do not already\r\n    perceive some results of their opening labours.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Gladstone’s first letters to a colleague was addressed to Mr.\r\nLowe, containing such hints and instructions upon treasury administration\r\nas a veteran pilot might give about lights, buoys, channels, currents, to\r\na new captain. “No man wants so much sympathy,” he said, “as the\r\nchancellor of the exchequer, no man gets so little. Nor is there any\r\nposition so lamentable for him as to be defeated in proposing some new\r\ncharge on the public conceived or adopted by himself. He is like an\r\nancient soldier wounded in the back. Whereas even defeat in resisting the\r\nraids of the House of Commons on the public purse is honourable, and\r\nalways turns out well in the end.” He sent Mr. Lowe a list of the subjects\r\nthat he had tried in parliament without success, and of those that he had\r\nin his head but was not able to take in hand. They make a fine example of\r\nan active and reforming mind.(243) “What commonly happened, in cases of\r\nthis kind, in my time, was as follows: The opposition waited for a\r\ndevelopment of discontent and resistance among some small fraction of\r\nliberal members. When this was compact in itself, or was at all stimulated\r\nby constituencies, they sent out habitually strong party whips, and either\r\nbeat me, or forced me to withdraw in order to avoid beating, or exposing\r\nour men to local disadvantage. This game, I hope, will not be quite so\r\neasy now.”\r\n\r\n(M122) The first two of Mr. Lowe’s budgets were on the lines thus traced\r\nbeforehand. The shilling duty on a quarter of corn was abolished—“an\r\nexceeding strong case,” as Mr. Gladstone called it—taxes on conveyances\r\nwere adjusted, and the duty on fire insurance was removed. The only\r\nnotable contribution to the standing problem of widening the base of\r\ntaxation was the proposal to put a tax on matches.(244) This was a notion\r\nborrowed from the United States, and much approved by Mr. Wells, the\r\neminent free-trade financier of that country. In England it was greeted\r\nwith violent disfavour. It was denounced as reactionary, as violating the\r\nfirst principles of fiscal administration, and as the very worst tax that\r\nhad been proposed within recent memory, for is not a match a necessary of\r\nlife, and to tax a necessary of life is to go against Adam Smith and the\r\nbooks. The money, it was said, ought to have been got either by raising\r\nthe taxes on tea and sugar, or else by putting the shilling duty back on\r\ncorn again, though for that matter, tea, sugar, and corn are quite as much\r\nnecessaries of life as, say, two-thirds of the matches used.(245) No care,\r\nhowever, was given to serious argument; in fact, the tax was hardly argued\r\nat all. Some hundreds of poor women employed at a large match factory in\r\nthe east end of London trooped to protest at Westminster, and the tax was\r\nquickly dropped. It was perhaps unlucky that the proposal happened to be\r\nassociated with Mr. Lowe, for his uncomplimentary criticisms on the\r\nworking class four or five years before were neither forgotten nor\r\nforgiven. A Latin pun that he meant to print on the proposed halfpenny\r\nmatch stamp, _ex luce lucellum_, “a little gain out of a little light,”\r\nwas good enough to divert a college common room, but it seemed flippant to\r\npeople who expected to see the bread taken out of their mouths.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the national account Mr. Gladstone was more\r\nsuccessful. He fought with all his strength for a reduction of the public\r\nburdens, and in at least one of these persistent battles with colleagues\r\nof a less economising mind than himself, he came near to a breach within\r\nthe walls of his cabinet. In this thankless region he was not always\r\nzealously seconded. On Dec. 14, 1871, he enters in his diary: “Cabinet,\r\n3-7. For two and a half hours we discussed army estimates, mainly on\r\nreduction, and the chancellor of exchequer did not speak one word.” The\r\nresult is worth recording. When Mr. Gladstone was at the exchequer the\r\ncharge on naval, military, and civil expenditure had been reduced between\r\n1860 and 1865 from thirty-eight millions to thirty-one. Under the\r\nDerby-Disraeli government the figure rose in two or three years to\r\nthirty-four millions and three-quarters. By 1873 it had been brought down\r\nagain to little more than thirty-two millions and a quarter.(246) That\r\nthese great reductions were effected without any sacrifice of the\r\nnecessary strength and efficiency of the forces, may be inferred from the\r\nfact that for ten years under successive administrations the charge on\r\nnavy and army underwent no substantial augmentation. The process had been\r\nmade easier, or made possible, by the necessity under which the German war\r\nlaid France, then our only rival in naval force, to reduce her expenditure\r\nupon new ships. The number of seamen was maintained, but a reduction was\r\neffected in the inefficient vessels in the foreign squadrons; two costly\r\nand almost useless dockyards were suppressed (much to the disadvantage of\r\nMr. Gladstone’s own constituents), and great abuses were remedied in the\r\ndockyards that were left. In the army reduction was made possible without\r\nlessening the requisite strength, by the withdrawal of troops from Canada,\r\nNew Zealand, and the Cape. This was due to the wise policy of Lord\r\nGranville and Mr. Gladstone. In spite of the increased cost of education,\r\nof army purchase, of the rise of prices, and all the other causes that\r\nswell estimates, the country was still spending no more in 1873 than when\r\nMr. Gladstone took office in 1868.(247) To this story we have to add that\r\nnearly thirty millions of debt were paid off in the five years. Well might\r\nmen point to such a record, as the best proof that the promises of economy\r\nmade at the hustings had been seriously kept.(248)\r\n\r\n(M123) When the time came for him to take stock of his own performances,\r\nMr. Lowe, who was apt to be cleverer than he was wise, made a speech at\r\nSheffield, in September 1873, that almost recalls the self-laudation of\r\nCicero over the immortal glories of his consulate. He disclaimed any share\r\nof the admirable genius for finance that had been seen in Pitt, Peel, or\r\nGladstone, but he had read in the Latin grammar that economy was a great\r\nrevenue, and he thought that he could at least discharge the humble task\r\nof hindering extravagance. “The first thing I did as chancellor of the\r\nexchequer,” he said, “was to issue an order that no new expenditure\r\nwhatever would be allowed without my opinion first being taken upon it....\r\nIn an evil hour for my own peace and quietness I took upon myself—I\r\nbelieve it was never taken upon himself by any chancellor of the exchequer\r\nbefore—the duty of protecting the revenue, instead of leaving it to be\r\ndone by an inferior official.” After reciting his figures, he wound up\r\nwith a resounding pæan: “So far as I am aware, up to the present time\r\nthere is no one who can challenge comparison with what has been done\r\nduring these years. Sir R. Peel and Mr. Gladstone routed out protection in\r\nyour trade, a measure that conferred immortal honour on them, but so far\r\nas relieving you from taxation is concerned, I believe you would seek in\r\nvain in British history for anything like what has been done during these\r\nlast four years.” This strange vein was more than a little distasteful to\r\nthe prime minister, as a letter to Lord Granville upon it shows (Sept. 9,\r\n1873):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lowe’s speech at Sheffield is really too bad, and free as it is\r\n    from all evil intention, it illustrates the invariable solecisms\r\n    of his extraordinary mind.... He says no chancellor of the\r\n    exchequer before did treasury business, but left it to a\r\n    subordinate official.... Some have done more, some less. No one,\r\n    probably, as much as Lowe, but some almost as much. I did less,\r\n    perhaps much less. But I hold that the first duties of the\r\n    chancellor of the exchequer are outside the treasury. One of them\r\n    is to look after and control the great expenditures and estimates.\r\n    In this duty I am sorry to say he was wretchedly deficient; yet he\r\n    coolly takes to himself the credit of army and navy reductions,\r\n    which is due to Cardwell and Childers (who, in his admirable\r\n    speech, did not say a word, I think, for himself), and with which\r\n    every member of the cabinet had almost as much to do as he had. I\r\n    can speak from experience, for I know what it has been to have had\r\n    cast upon my shoulders the most important and most offensive duty\r\n    of the financial minister.... He has ample merit to stand on, in a\r\n    great amount of labour done, and generally well done, and with\r\n    good results for the public. Much of the unpopularity is unjust; a\r\n    little patience would set all right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII. Autumn Of 1871. Decline Of Popularity. (1871-1872)\r\n\r\n\r\n    For the present at least the reformation will operate against the\r\n    reformers. Nothing is more common than for men to wish, and call\r\n    loudly too, for a reformation, who when it arrives do by no means\r\n    like the severity of its aspect. Reformation is one of those\r\n    pieces which must be put at some distance in order to please. Its\r\n    greatest favourers love it better in the abstract than in the\r\n    substance.\r\n\r\n    —BURKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July, 1871, Mr. Gladstone paid a Sunday visit to Tennyson among the\r\nSurrey hills. They had two interesting days, “with talk ranging\r\neverywhere.” The poet read the _Holy Grail_, which Mr. Gladstone admired.\r\nThey discussed the Goschen parish council plan, and other social reforms;\r\nLacordaire and liberal collectivism; politics and the stormy times ahead.\r\nMr. Gladstone assured them that he was a conservative, and feared extreme\r\nmeasures from the opposition. “A very noble fellow,” Tennyson called him,\r\n“and perfectly unaffected.”(249) Mr. Gladstone, for his part, records in\r\nhis diary that he found “a characteristic and delightful abode. In\r\nTennyson are singularly united true greatness, genuine simplicity, and\r\nsome eccentricity. But the latter is from habit and circumstance, the\r\nformer is his nature. His wife is excellent, and in her adaptation to him\r\nwonderful. His son Hallam is most attractive.”\r\n\r\nAfter a laborious and irksome session, “in which, we have sat, I believe,\r\n150 hours after midnight,” the House rose (Aug. 21). Mr. Gladstone spent\r\nsome time at Whitby with his family, and made a speech to his eldest son’s\r\nconstituents (Sept. 2) on the ballot, and protesting against the spirit of\r\n“alarmism.” Towards the end of the month he went on to Balmoral. On\r\nSeptember 26 he was presented with the freedom of Aberdeen, and made a\r\nspeech on Irish home rule, of which, as we shall see, he heard a great\r\ndeal fifteen years later:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Mrs. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    _Balmoral, Sept. 28._—The time is rolling on easily at this\r\n    _quiet_ place.... We breakfast six or eight. The Prince and\r\n    Princess Louis of Hesse dine most days. To-day I walked with her\r\n    and her party. She is quick, kind, and well informed. I got her\r\n    to-day on the subject of the religious movement in the Roman\r\n    catholic church in Germany. She is imbued with her father’s ideas,\r\n    and, I think, goes beyond them. She quoted Strauss to me, as\r\n    giving his opinion that the movement would come to nothing. She\r\n    said the infallibility was the legitimate development of the Roman\r\n    system. I replied that the Roman system had grown up by a\r\n    multitude of scarcely perceptible degrees out of the earliest form\r\n    of Christianity, and if we adopted this notion of legitimate\r\n    development, we ran a risk of making Saint Paul responsible for\r\n    the Vatican council. She talked much about the hospitals, in which\r\n    she worked so hard while nursing her baby, a very fine one, whom\r\n    she introduced to me, with two flourishing elder children. She\r\n    hates war; and is not easy as to the future.\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 29._—I have had a twelve-mile stretch to-day, almost all on\r\n    wild ground, and so solitary! not a living creature except three\r\n    brace of grouse all the way. I am glad to report that I came in\r\n    very fresh. ... What a mess the Bishop of Winchester has made of\r\n    this Glengarry kirk business.\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 30._—Last night we dined ten at Abergeldie. The Prince of\r\n    Wales had his usual pleasant manners. He is far lighter in hand\r\n    than the Duke of Edinburgh. After dinner he invited me to play\r\n    whist. I said, “For love, sir?” He said, “Well, shillings and\r\n    half-a-crown on the rubber,” to which I submitted. Ponsonby and I\r\n    against the Prince and Brasseur, a charming old Frenchman, his\r\n    tutor in the language. The Prince has apparently an _immense_\r\n    whist memory, and plays well accordingly. To-day the Queen was to\r\n    have seen me at six, but sent to postpone it till to-morrow on\r\n    account of expecting the Princess of Wales, who was to come over\r\n    and pay her a visit from Abergeldie. I think she is nervous, and\r\n    shrinks from talk; but I do not mean to say a word that would give\r\n    her trouble, as there would be no good in it at this moment.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 3._—I have seen the Queen again this morning. She conversed\r\n    longer, near an hour, and was visibly better and stronger, and in\r\n    good spirits. She told me much about her illness. ... She wished\r\n    me a pleasant journey.\r\n\r\n    _Ballater, Oct. 4._—Here am I ensconced in the station-master’s\r\n    box at Ballater, after a 15 or 16 mile walk round through the\r\n    hills, the regular train being postponed for an hour or more to\r\n    let the couple from Mar Lodge go off special. They had two\r\n    carriages laden with luggage, besides their own carriage! I hope\r\n    to be at Colwyn soon after six. These solitary walks among the\r\n    hills, I think, refresh and invigorate me more than anything else.\r\n    To-day the early part of the day was glorious, and the wind most\r\n    bracing as it came over the mass of mountains. I bade farewell\r\n    reluctantly to Balmoral, for it is as homelike as any place away\r\n    from home can be, and wonderfully safe from invasions. I had all\r\n    the grand mountains in view at once, with their snow caps; the\r\n    lowest, about the same as Snowdon. I came by the falls of the\r\n    Muich, which, after the rain, were very fine. I had an interesting\r\n    conversation with Princess Louise about the Queen this morning.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 4._—Nothing sets me up in mind and body like a mountain\r\n    solitude, not even, perhaps, the sea. Walked from Balmoral to\r\n    Ballater, 15 miles, in 4 hrs. 5 m. 6.—Walked 20 miles in 5 hrs.\r\n    and 45 minutes. 7.—Walked 15 miles.—(_Diary._)\r\n\r\n    _To Mrs. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    _Ainslie Place, Edinburgh, Oct. 8, 1871._—I got here last night\r\n    before seven, and had the most affectionate welcome from the dean\r\n    that you can conceive; a dinner-party followed, and now I have for\r\n    the _first time_ since the government was formed had a holiday of\r\n    two whole days. Last night the lord advocate tried to talk to me\r\n    about the Scotch endowed schools and I refused to have anything to\r\n    say to him. I have no time to write about my walk, beyond this,\r\n    that it was quite successful. The dean [Ramsay] preached at St.\r\n    John’s this morning about Ruth. The sermon was beautiful, and the\r\n    voice and manner with his venerable age made it very striking. He\r\n    put an astonishing energy into it, and his clear melodious tones\r\n    rang through and through as they did when I first heard him 43½\r\n    years ago. It was altogether most touching, and he told me\r\n    afterwards that he had wished to preach to me once more before he\r\n    died. But I rejoice to say his life seems a very good one. I would\r\n    not have missed the occasion for much.\r\n\r\n    _London, Oct. 27._—Went to Sir R. Murchison’s funeral, the last of\r\n    those who had known me or of me from infancy. And so a step\r\n    towards the end is made visible. It was a great funeral. 28.—My\r\n    expedition to Greenwich, or rather, Blackheath. I spoke 1 h. 50\r\n    m.; too long, yet really not long enough for a full development of\r\n    my points. Physically rather an excess of effort. All went well,\r\n    thank God!—(_Diary._)\r\n\r\n\r\n(M124) This speech at Blackheath was a fine illustration both of Mr.\r\nGladstone’s extraordinary power, and of the sure respect of a British\r\naudience for manful handling and firm dealing in a minister, if only the\r\nappeal be high enough. It was one of the marked scenes of his life. In the\r\ncold mist of the October afternoon he stood bareheaded, pale, resolute,\r\nbefore a surging audience of many thousands, few of them enthusiastically\r\nhis friends, a considerable mass of them dockyard workmen, furious at\r\ndischarge or neglect by an economising government. He was received with\r\nloud and angry murmurs ominous of storm, but curiosity, interest, and a\r\nsense that even a prime minister should have fair play prevailed. His rich\r\ntones and clear articulation—and Mr. Gladstone had studied all the arts\r\nfor husbanding vocal resources—carried his words beyond the five or six\r\nthousand persons that are commonly understood to be the limit of possible\r\nhearers in the open air. After half an hour of struggle he conquered a\r\nhold upon them that became more intense as he went on—touching topic after\r\ntopic, defending all that had been done for the reform and efficiency of\r\nthe army, denouncing extreme opinions on the Education Act, vindicating\r\nthe ballot bill, laughing at various prescriptions of social\r\nquackery—until at the close of a speech nearly two hours long, he retired\r\namid sustained hurricanes of earnest applause. Well might he speak of\r\nrather an excess of physical effort, to say nothing of effort of mind.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Hawarden he had a visit from Mr. Bright, whom he\r\nearnestly hoped to bring back into the cabinet.(250)\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 13._—Hawarden. Two long conversations with Mr. Bright, who\r\n    arrived at one. 14.—Some five hours in conversation with Mr.\r\n    Bright; also I opened my proposal to him, which he took kindly\r\n    though cautiously. My conversation with him yesterday evening kept\r\n    me awake till four. A most rare event; but my brain assumes in the\r\n    evening a feminine susceptibility, and resents any unusual strain,\r\n    though, strange to say, it will stand a debate in the H. of C.\r\n    15.—Forenoon with Bright, who departed, having charmed everybody\r\n    by his gentleness. Began the cutting of a large beech. #/\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 15, 1871._—Bright has been here for forty-eight hours, of\r\n    which we passed I think more than a fourth in conversation on\r\n    public affairs. Everything in and everything out of the cabinet I\r\n    told him as far as my memory would serve, and I think we pretty\r\n    well boxed the political compass. On the whole I remained\r\n    convinced of two things: first, that his heart is still altogether\r\n    with us; secondly, that his health, though requiring great care,\r\n    is really equal to the moderate demands we should make upon him.\r\n    The truth is I was quite as much knocked up with our conversation\r\n    as he was, but then I had the more active share. In the whole\r\n    range of subjects that we travelled over, we came to no point of\r\n    sharp difference, and I feel confident that he could work with the\r\n    cabinet as harmoniously and effectually as before. In saying this\r\n    I should add that I told him, with respect to economy, that I\r\n    thought we should now set our faces in that direction. I told him\r\n    that we should not expect of him ordinary night attendance in the\r\n    House of Commons, and that his attendance in the cabinet was the\r\n    main object of our desire. He was pleased and touched with our\r\n    desire, and he has not rejected the proposal. He has intimated\r\n    doubts and apprehensions, but he reserves it for consideration,\r\n    and seemed decidedly pleased to learn that the question _might_ be\r\n    held open until the meeting of parliament in case of need.... I\r\n    did not think it fair to put to him the request by which I\r\n    endeavoured to hold him in December 1868, viz.: that he would not\r\n    determine in the matter without seeing me again; but I begged and\r\n    pressed that he should in no case refuse without taking the\r\n    opinion of a first-rate London physician, as these are the people\r\n    whose wide experience best enables them to judge in such cases.\r\n    Altogether my experience of him was extremely pleasant, and he was\r\n    popular beyond measure in the house, where the guests were one or\r\n    two ladies and four gentlemen, Sir G. Prevost, a high church (but\r\n    most excellent) archdeacon, John Murray, the tory publisher, and\r\n    Hayward—whom to describe it needs not. One and all were charmed\r\n    with Bright. In his character the mellowing process has continued\r\n    to advance, and whatever he may have been thirty years ago, he is\r\n    now a gentle and tender being. Yesterday he had five hours of\r\n    conversation with me and much with others, also an hour and a half\r\n    walk in the rain, which seemed to do him no harm whatever. I will\r\n    add but one word. He was deeply impressed with the royalty\r\n    question.... Details I will report to the cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bright did not yet feel able to return, and an important year, the\r\nthird of the administration, drew to its close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo stubborn and noisy scuffles arose in the autumn of 1871, in\r\nconsequence of a couple of appointments to which Mr. Gladstone as prime\r\nminister was a party. One was judicial, the other was ecclesiastical.\r\n\r\n(M125) Parliament, authorising the appointment of four paid members of the\r\njudicial committee of the privy council, had restricted the post to\r\npersons who held at the date of their appointment, or had previously held,\r\njudicial office in this country or in India.(251) Difficulty arose in\r\nfinding a fourth member of the new court from the English bench. The\r\nappointment being a new one, fell to the prime minister, but he was\r\nnaturally guided by the chancellor. The office was first offered by Mr.\r\nGladstone to Lord Penzance, who declined to move. Application was then\r\nmade to Willes and to Bramwell. They also declined, on the ground that no\r\nprovision was made for their clerks. Willes could not abandon one who had\r\nbeen “his officer, he might say friend, for thirty years.” Bramwell spoke\r\nof the pecuniary sacrifice that the post would involve, “for I cannot let\r\nmy clerks, who between them have been with me near half a century, suffer\r\nby the change.” The chancellor mentioned to Mr. Gladstone a rumour that\r\nthere was ’an actual strike among the judges’ in the matter. Nobody who\r\nknew Bramwell would impute unreasonable or low-minded motives to him, and\r\nfrom their own point of view the judges had a sort of case. It was\r\nascertained by the chancellor that Blackburn and Martin had said expressly\r\nthat they should decline. Mr. Gladstone felt, as he told Lord Hatherley,\r\nthat “it was not right to hawk the appointment about,” and he offered it\r\nto Sir Robert Collier, then attorney-general. Collier’s claim to the\r\nbench, and even to the headship of a court, was undisputed; his judicial\r\ncapacity was never at any time impugned; he acquired no additional\r\nemolument. In accepting Mr. Gladstone’s offer (Oct. 1871) he reminded him:\r\n“You are aware that in order to qualify me it will be necessary first to\r\nmake me a common law judge.” Three days later, the chancellor told Mr.\r\nGladstone, “It would hardly do to place the attorney-general on the common\r\nlaw bench and then promote him.” Still under the circumstances he thought\r\nit would be best to follow the offer up, and Collier was accordingly made\r\na judge in the common pleas, sat for a few days, and then went on to the\r\njudicial committee. The proceeding was not taken without cabinet\r\nauthority, for Lord Granville writes to Mr. Gladstone: “Nov. 12, ’71: The\r\ncabinet completely assented to the arrangement. Sufficient attention was\r\nperhaps not given to the technical point. For technical it only is.... I\r\nthink you said at the cabinet that Collier wished to have three months’\r\ntenure of the judgeship, and that we agreed with you that this would have\r\nbeen only a sham.”\r\n\r\nCockburn, the chief justice of the Queen’s bench, opened fire on Mr.\r\nGladstone (Nov. 10) in a long letter of rather over-heroic eloquence,\r\nprotesting that a colourable appointment to a judgeship for the purpose of\r\ngetting round the law seriously compromised the dignity of the judicial\r\noffice, and denouncing the grievous impropriety of the proceeding as a\r\nmere subterfuge and evasion of the statute. Mr. Gladstone could be\r\nextremely summary when he chose, and he replied in three or four lines,\r\ninforming the chief justice that as the transaction was a joint one, and\r\nas “the completed part of it to which you have taken objection, was the\r\nofficial act of the lord chancellor,” he had transmitted the letter for\r\nhis consideration. That was all he said. The chancellor for his part\r\ncontented himself with half a dozen sentences, that his appointment of\r\nCollier to the puisne judgeship had been made with a full knowledge of Mr.\r\nGladstone’s intention to recommend him for the judicial committee; that he\r\nthus “acted advisedly and with the conviction that the arrangement was\r\njustified as regards both its fitness and its legality”; and that he took\r\nupon himself the responsibility of thus concurring with Mr. Gladstone, and\r\nwas prepared to vindicate the course pursued. This curt treatment of his\r\nJunius-like composition mortified Cockburn’s literary vanity, and no\r\nvanity is so easily stung as that of the amateur.\r\n\r\n(M126) Collier, when the storm was brewing, at once wrote to Mr. Gladstone\r\n(Nov. 13) proposing to retain his judgeship to the end of the term, then\r\nto resign it, and act gratuitously in the privy council. He begged that it\r\nmight not be supposed he offered to do this merely as matter of form.\r\n“Though I consider the objection to my appointment wholly baseless, still\r\nit is not pleasant to me to hold a salaried office, my right to which is\r\nquestioned.” “I have received your letter,” Mr. Gladstone replied (Nov..\r\n14), “which contains the offer that would only be made by a high-spirited\r\nman, impatient of suspicion or reproval, and determined to place himself\r\nbeyond it.... I have not a grain of inclination to recede from the course\r\nmarked out, and if you had proposed to abandon the appointment, I should\r\nhave remonstrated.”\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Gladstone called “a parliamentary peppering” followed in due\r\ncourse. It was contended that the statute in spirit as in letter exacted\r\njudicial experience, and that formal passing through a court was a breach\r\nof faith with parliament. As usual, lawyers of equal eminence were found\r\nto contend with equal confidence that a fraud had been put upon the law,\r\nand that no fraud had been put upon it; that the law required judicial\r\nstatus not experience, and on the other hand that what it required was\r\nexperience not status. Lord Hatherley and Roundell Palmer were all the\r\nvirtues, whether public or private, personified; they were at the top of\r\nthe legal ladder; and they agreed in Palmer’s deliberate judgment\r\nthat—after other judges with special fitness had declined the terms\r\noffered by parliament—in nominating the best man at the bar who was\r\nwilling to take a vacant puisne judgeship upon the understanding that he\r\nshould be at once transferred to the judicial committee, the government\r\nwere innocent of any offence against either the spirit or substance of the\r\nlaw.(252)\r\n\r\nYet the escape was narrow. The government only missed censure in the Lords\r\nby a majority of one. In the Commons the evening was anxious. “You will\r\nsee,” says Mr. Bruce (Feb. 20, 1872), “that we got but a small majority\r\nlast night. The fact is that our victory in the Lords made men slack about\r\ncoming to town, and Glyn got very nervous in the course of the evening.\r\nHowever, Palmer’s and Gladstone’s speeches, both of which were excellent,\r\nimproved the feeling, and many who had announced their intention to go\r\naway without voting, remained to support us.” At one moment it even looked\r\nas if the Speaker might have to give a casting vote, and he had framed it\r\non these lines: “I have concluded that the House while it looks upon the\r\ncourse taken by government as impolitic and injudicious, is not prepared\r\nat the present juncture to visit their conduct with direct parliamentary\r\ncensure.”(253) In the end, ministers had a majority of twenty-seven, and\r\nreached their homes at three in the morning with reasonably light hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M127) The ecclesiastical case of complaint against Mr. Gladstone was of a\r\nsimilar sort. By an act of parliament passed in 1871 the Queen was\r\nentitled to present to the rectory of Ewelme, but only a person who was a\r\nmember of convocation of the university of Oxford. This limitation was\r\ninserted by way of compensation to the university for the severance of the\r\nadvowson of the rectory from a certain chair of divinity. The living fell\r\nvacant, and the prime minister offered it (June 15) to Jelf of Christ\r\nChurch, a tory and an evangelical. By Jelf it was declined. Among other\r\nnames on the list for preferment was that of Mr. Harvey, a learned man who\r\nhad published an edition of Irenæus, a work on the history and theology of\r\nthe three creeds, articles on judaism, jansenism, and jesuitism, and other\r\nproductions of merit. As might perhaps have been surmised from the nature\r\nof his favourite pursuits, he was not a liberal in politics, and he had\r\nwhat was for the purposes of this preferment the further misfortune of\r\nbeing a Cambridge man. To him Mr. Gladstone now offered Ewelme, having\r\nbeen advised that by the process of formal incorporation in the Oxford\r\nconvocation the requirement of the statute would be satisfied. Mr. Harvey\r\naccepted. He was told that it was necessary that he should become a member\r\nof convocation before he could be appointed. A little later (Aug. 1) he\r\nconfessed to the prime minister his misgivings lest he should be\r\nconsidered as an “interloper in succeeding to the piece of preferment that\r\nparliament had appropriated to bona-fide members of the university of\r\nOxford.” These scruples were set aside, he was incorporated as a member of\r\nOriel in due form, and after forty-two days of residence was admitted to\r\nmembership of convocation, but whether to such plenary membership as the\r\nEwelme statute was taken to require, became matter of dispute. All went\r\nforward, and the excellent man was presented and instituted to his rectory\r\nin regular course. There was no secret about operations at Oxford; the\r\nOriel men were aware of his motive in seeking incorporation, and the\r\nvice-chancellor and everybody else concerned knew all about it. Mr.\r\nGladstone, when squalls began to blow, wrote to Mr. Harvey (Feb. 26, ’72)\r\nthat he was advised that the presentation was perfectly valid.\r\n\r\nThe attack in parliament was, as such attacks almost always are, much\r\noverdone. Mr. Gladstone, it appeared, was far worse than Oliver Cromwell\r\nand the parliament of the great rebellion; for though those bad men forced\r\nthree professors upon Oxford between 1648 and 1660, still they took care\r\nthat the intruders should all be men trained at Oxford and graduates of\r\nOxford. Who could be sure that the prime minister would not next appoint\r\nan ultramontane divine from Bologna, or a Greek from Corfu? Such\r\nextravagances did as little harm as the false stories about Mr. Harvey\r\nbeing jobbed into the living because he had been at Eton with Mr.\r\nGladstone and was his political supporter. As it happened he was a\r\nconservative, and Mr. Gladstone knew nothing of him except that a number\r\nof most competent persons had praised his learning. In spite of all this,\r\nhowever, and of the technical validity of the appointment, we may wish\r\nthat the rector’s doubts had not been overruled. A worthy member regaled\r\nthe House by a story of a gentleman staying in the mansion of a friend;\r\none morning he heard great noise and confusion in the yard; looking out he\r\nsaw a kitchen-maid being put on a horse, and so carried round and round\r\nthe yard. When he went downstairs he asked what was the matter, and the\r\ngroom said, “Oh, sir, ’tis only that we’re going to take the animal to the\r\nfair to sell, and we want to say he has carried a lady.” The apologue was\r\nnot delicate, but it conveyed a common impression. “Gladstone spoke,” says\r\nMr. Bruce (March 9, 1872), “with great vigour and eloquence on the Ewelme\r\ncase; but I think that, with the best possible intentions, he had placed\r\nhimself in a wrong position.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1872 the wide popularity of the government underwent a marked decline.\r\nThe award at Geneva caused lively irritation. The most active\r\nnonconformists were in active revolt. The Licensing bills infuriated the\r\nmost powerful of all trade interests. The Collier case and the Ewelme case\r\nseemed superfluous and provoking blunders. A strong military section\r\nthirsted for revenge on the royal warrant. Mr. Goschen’s threatened bill\r\non local rating spread vague terrors. Individual ministers began to excite\r\nparticular odium.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, the essentially composite character of a majority that\r\nwas only held together by Mr. Gladstone’s personality, his authority in\r\nthe House, and his enormous strength outside, revealed itself in awkward\r\nfissures. The majority was described by good critics of the time, as made\r\nup of three sections, almost well defined enough to deserve the name of\r\nthree separate parties. First were the whigs, who never forgot that the\r\nprime minister had been for half his life a tory; who always suspected\r\nhim, and felt no personal attachment to him, though they valued his\r\nrespect for property and tradition, and knew in any case that he was the\r\nonly possible man. Then came the middle-class liberals, who had held\r\npredominance since 1832, who were captivated by Mr. Gladstone’s genius for\r\nfinance and business, and who revered his high moral ideals. Third, there\r\nwas the left wing, not strong in parliament but with a certain backing\r\namong the workmen, who thought their leader too fond of the church, too\r\ndeferential to the aristocracy, and not plain enough and thorough enough\r\nfor a reforming age. The murmurs and suspicions of these hard and logical\r\nutilitarians of the left galled Mr. Gladstone as ungrateful. Phillimore\r\nrecords of him at this moment:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 21, 1872._—Gladstone in high spirits and in rather a\r\n    conservative mood. 29.—Gladstone sees that the time is fast coming\r\n    when he must sever himself from his extreme supporters. He means\r\n    to take the opportunity of retiring on the fair plea that he does\r\n    not like to oppose those who have shown such great confidence in\r\n    him, or to join their and his opponents. The plea seems good for\r\n    retirement, but not for refraining in his individual capacity from\r\n    supporting a government which is liberal and conservative.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a sketch from the Aberdare papers of the temper and proceedings of\r\nthe session:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 19._—We have had a disastrous week—three defeats, of which\r\n    much the least damaging was that on local taxation, where we\r\n    defended the public purse against a dangerous raid. There is no\r\n    immediate danger to be apprehended from them. But these defeats\r\n    lower prestige, encourage the discontented and envious, and\r\n    animate the opposition. I think that Gladstone, who behaved\r\n    yesterday with consummate judgment and temper, is personally very\r\n    indifferent at the result. He is vexed at the ingratitude of men\r\n    for whom he has done such great things which would have been\r\n    simply impossible without him, and would not be unwilling to leave\r\n    them for a while to their own guidance, and his feeling is shared\r\n    by many of the ministry. Our measures must for the most part be\r\n    taken up by our successors, and we should of course be too happy\r\n    to help them. But I don’t see the end near, although, of course,\r\n    everybody is speculating.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet business was done. Progress of a certain kind was made in the thorny\r\nfield of the better regulation of public houses, but Mr. Gladstone seems\r\nnever to have spoken upon it in parliament. The subject was in the hands\r\nof Mr. Bruce, the home secretary, an accomplished and amiable man of the\r\npurest public spirit, and he passed his bill; but nothing did more to\r\nbring himself and his colleagues into stern disfavour among the especially\r\npagan strata of the population. An entry or two from Mr. Bruce’s papers\r\nwill suffice to show Mr. Gladstone’s attitude:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Home Office, Dec. 9, 1869._—I am just returned from the cabinet,\r\n    where my Licensing bill went through with flying colours. I was\r\n    questioned a great deal as to details, but was ready, and I think\r\n    that Gladstone was very well pleased.\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 16, 1871._—I called upon Gladstone yesterday evening. He was\r\n    in high spirits and full of kindness. He said that he had told\r\n    Cardwell that I must be at the bottom of the abuse the press was\r\n    pouring upon him, as I had contrived to relieve myself of it.\r\n    “Some one minister,” he added, “is sure to be assailed. You caught\r\n    it in the autumn, and now poor Cardwell is having a hard time of\r\n    it.” I went with him afterwards to the Chapel Royal, which he\r\n    never fails to attend.\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 14._—We have a cabinet to-day, when I hope to have my\r\n    Licensing bill in its main principles definitely settled.\r\n    Unfortunately Gladstone cares for nothing but “free trade” [in the\r\n    sale of liquor], which the House won’t have, and I cannot get him\r\n    really to interest himself in the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is Speaker Brand’s account of the general position:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Throughout the session the opposition, ably led by Disraeli, were\r\n    in an attitude of watchfulness. He kept his eye on the proceedings\r\n    of the government day by day on the Alabama treaty. Had that\r\n    treaty failed, no doubt Disraeli would have taken the sense of the\r\n    House on the conduct of the government. For the larger part of the\r\n    session the Alabama question hung like a cloud over the\r\n    proceedings, but as soon as that was settled, the sky cleared. It\r\n    has been a good working session.... Of the two leading men,\r\n    Gladstone and Disraeli, neither has a strong hold on his\r\n    followers. The radicals below the right gangway are turbulent and\r\n    disaffected, and the same may be said of the independent\r\n    obstruction below the left gangway.... B., E., H., L. avowedly\r\n    obstruct all legislation, and thus bring the House into discredit.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M128) It was now that Mr. Disraeli discerned the first great opportunity\r\napproaching, and he took the field. At Manchester (April 3) he drew the\r\nfamous picture of the government, one of the few classic pieces of the\r\noratory of the century:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Extravagance is being substituted for energy by the government.\r\n    The unnatural stimulus is subsiding. Their paroxysms end in\r\n    prostration. Some take refuge in melancholy, and their eminent\r\n    chief alternates between a menace and a sigh. As I sit opposite\r\n    the treasury bench, the ministers remind me of one of those marine\r\n    landscapes not very unusual on the coasts of South America. You\r\n    behold a range of exhausted volcanoes. Not a flame flickers upon a\r\n    single pallid crest. But the situation is still dangerous. There\r\n    are occasional earthquakes, and ever and anon the dark rumblings\r\n    of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn midsummer day he essayed at the Crystal Palace a higher flight, and\r\nfirst struck the imperialist note. He agreed that distant colonies could\r\nonly have their affairs administered by self-government. “Self-government,\r\nwhen it was conceded, ought to have been conceded as part of a great\r\npolicy of imperial consolidation. It ought to have been accomplished by an\r\nimperial tariff, by securities for the people of England, for the\r\nenjoyment of the unappropriated lands which belonged to the sovereign as\r\ntheir trustee, and by a military code which should have precisely defined\r\nthe means and the responsibilities by which the colonies should have been\r\ndefended, and by which, if necessary, this country should call for aid\r\nfrom the colonies themselves. It ought further to have been accompanied by\r\nthe institution of some representative council in the metropolis which\r\nwould have brought the colonies into constant and continuous relations\r\nwith the home government.” He confessed that he had himself at one time\r\nbeen so far caught by the subtle views of the disintegrationists, that he\r\nthought the tie was broken. Opinion in the country was at last rising\r\nagainst disintegration. The people had decided that the empire should not\r\nbe destroyed. “In my judgment,” he said, “no minister in this country will\r\ndo his duty who neglects any opportunity of reconstructing as much as\r\npossible our colonial empire, and of responding to those distant\r\nsympathies which may become the source of incalculable strength and\r\nhappiness to this land.” Toryism now sought three great objects: “the\r\nmaintenance of our institutions, the preservation of our empire, and the\r\nimprovement of the condition of the people.” The time was at hand when\r\nEngland would have to decide between national and cosmopolitan principles,\r\nand the issue was no mean one. “You must remember,” he concluded, “that in\r\nfighting against liberalism or the continental system, you are fighting\r\nagainst those who have the advantage of power—against those who have been\r\nhigh in place for nearly half a century. You have nothing to trust to but\r\nyour own energy and the sublime instinct of an ancient people.”\r\n\r\nDisraeli’s genius, at once brooding over conceptions and penetrating in\r\ndiscernment of fact, had shown him the vast tory reserves that his\r\nhousehold suffrage of 1867 would rally to his flag. The same genius again\r\nscanning the skies read aright the signs and characteristics of the time.\r\nNobody would seriously have counselled intervention in arms between France\r\nand Germany, yet many felt a vague humiliation at a resettlement of Europe\r\nwithout England. Nobody seriously objected to the opening of the Black\r\nSea, yet many were affected by a restive consciousness of diplomatic\r\ndefeat. Everybody was glad that—as I am about to describe in the following\r\nchapter—we had settled the outstanding quarrel with America, yet most\r\npeople were sore at the audacity of the indirect claims, followed by the\r\naward of swingeing damages. National pride in short was silently but\r\ndeeply stirred; the steady splendour of the economic era for a season\r\npaled in uncalculating minds. This coming mood the tory leader, with his\r\nrare faculty of wide and sweeping forecast, confidently divined, and he\r\nfound for it the oracle of a party cry in phrases about Empire and Social\r\nReform. When power fell into his hands, he made no single move of solid\r\neffect for either social reform or imperial unity. When Mr. Gladstone\r\ncommitted himself to a policy, he brought in bills to carry it out.\r\nForecast without a bill is interesting, but not to be trusted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX. Washington And Geneva. (1870-1872)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Although I may think the sentence was harsh in its extent, and\r\n    unjust in its basis, I regard the fine imposed on this country as\r\n    dust in the balance compared with the moral value of the example\r\n    set when these two great nations of England and America—which are\r\n    among the most fiery and the most jealous in the world with regard\r\n    to anything that touches national honour—went in peace and concord\r\n    before a judicial tribunal rather than resort to the arbitrament\r\n    of the sword.—GLADSTONE.(254)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning in the summer of 1862 a small wooden sloop, screw and steam,\r\nof a little over a thousand tons register dropped slowly down the waters\r\nof the Mersey. The decks were rough and unfinished, but guests on board\r\nwith bright costumes made a gay picture, flags were flying, and all wore\r\nthe look of a holiday trial trip. After luncheon in the cabin, the scene\r\nsuddenly changed. At a signal from the vessel a tug came alongside, the\r\ncheerful visitors to their surprise were quickly transferred, and the\r\nsloop made off upon her real business. She dropped anchor in a bay on the\r\ncoast of Anglesey, where she took twenty or thirty men mostly English on\r\nboard from a tug sent after her from Liverpool, with or without the\r\nknowledge of the officials. Thence she sailed to the Azores, where a\r\nsteamer from London and a steamer from Liverpool brought officers,\r\narmaments, and coal. As soon as these were trans-shipped, the British\r\nensign was hauled down, the Confederate flag run up, and the captain\r\nopened sealed orders directing him to sink, burn, or destroy, everything\r\nthat flew the ensign of the so-called United States of America. These\r\norders the captain of the rover faithfully executed, and in a few months\r\nthe _Alabama_—for that was henceforth her memorable name—had done much to\r\nsweep the commercial marine of America from the ocean.\r\n\r\n(M129) On the day on which she sailed (July 29), the government made up\r\nits mind that she should be detained, on the strength of affidavits that\r\nhad been almost a week in their hands. The bird of prey had flown. The\r\nbest definition of due diligence in these matters would seem to be, that\r\nit is the same diligence and exactness as are exercised in proceedings\r\nrelating to imposts of excise or customs. We may guess how different would\r\nhave been the vigilance of the authorities if a great smuggling operation\r\nhad been suspected. This lamentable proceeding, for which the want of\r\nalacrity and common sense at the foreign office and the bias or blundering\r\nof the customs agents at Liverpool, may divide the grave discredit, opened\r\na diplomatic campaign between England and the United States that lasted as\r\nlong as the siege of Troy, and became an active element in the state of\r\nmoral war that prevailed during that time between the two kindred\r\ncommunities. Mr. Gladstone, like other members of the Palmerston\r\nadministration, held for several years that the escape of the _Alabama_\r\nwas no wrong done by us. Lord Russell admitted (1863) that the cases of\r\nthe _Alabama_ and the _Oreto_ were “a scandal and in some degree a\r\nreproach to our laws,” though he stated in the same sentence that the\r\ncabinet thought the law sufficient where legal evidence also was\r\nsufficient. It was true that Britain is the greatest shipbuilding country\r\nin the world; that to interfere with ships or any other article of\r\ncommerce is in so far to impose on a neutral some of the calamities of a\r\nbelligerent; and that restriction of trade was no element in the policy\r\nand spirit of foreign enlistment acts either here or in America, which was\r\nthe first country that by positive legislation sought to restrain its\r\ncitizens within definite limits of neutrality. By a law of this kind\r\nparliament intended to forbid all subjects within its jurisdiction to make\r\nwar on people at peace with the British sovereign. It is only, in the\r\nwords of Canning, when the elements of armament are combined, that they\r\ncome within the purview of such law. This is not by way of controversy,\r\nbut to define an issue. Chief Justice Cockburn, an ardent champion of his\r\ncountry if ever there was one, pronounced in his judgment at Geneva, when\r\nthe day for a verdict at length arrived, that the cruiser ought to have\r\nbeen detained a week before; that the officials of customs were misled by\r\nlegal advice “perhaps erroneous”; and that the right course to take was\r\n“plain and unmistakable.” Even Lord Russell after many years of obdurate\r\nself-defence, at last confessed in manly words: “I assent entirely to the\r\nopinion of the lord chief justice that the _Alabama_ ought to have been\r\ndetained during the four days I was waiting for the opinion of the law\r\nofficers. But I think that the fault was not that of the commissioners of\r\ncustoms; it was my fault as secretary of state for foreign affairs.”(255)\r\n\r\nBefore the _Alabama_ some ten vessels intended for Confederate service had\r\nbeen detained, inquired into, and if released, released by order of a\r\ncourt for want of evidence. After the _Alabama_, no vessel on which the\r\nAmerican minister had made representation to the foreign office succeeded\r\nin quitting a British port. But critical cases occurred. Emboldened by the\r\nsuccessful escape of the _Alabama_, the Confederate agents placed two\r\nironclad rams upon the stocks at the Birkenhead shipyard; Mr. Adams, the\r\nAmerican minister in London, renewed his bombardment of the foreign office\r\nwith proof of their object and design; the foreign office repeated its\r\nperplexed pleas against interference, made still more difficult by a\r\ncolourable transfer of the rams to a French owner; and the whole dreary\r\ntragi-comedy of the _Alabama_ seemed likely to be acted over again. By the\r\nautumn of 1863 the rams were ready to take the water, and the builders\r\nwere again talking of a trial trip. This time Lord Russell gave orders\r\nthat the rams were to be stopped (Sept. 3). He felt the mortification of\r\nan honourable man at the trick, of which he had allowed himself to be made\r\nthe dupe in the case of the _Alabama_. Perhaps also he had been impressed\r\nby language used by Mr. Adams to a member of the cabinet, and more\r\nformally to himself, to the effect that the departure of the rams would\r\nmean the practical opening to the Southern Confederates of full liberty to\r\nuse this country as a base for hostile expeditions against the North.\r\n“This,” said Mr. Adams, “is war.”(256)\r\n\r\nThe affair of the rams was followed by Mr. Gladstone with absorbed\r\nattention. He confessed to the Duke of Argyll (Sept. 30, 1863) that he\r\ncould not get the ironclads out of his head, and his letter shows with\r\nwhat exhaustive closeness he argued the case. The predicament was exactly\r\nfitted to draw out some of his most characteristic qualities—minute\r\nprecision, infinite acuteness, infinite caution, the faculty of multiplied\r\ndistinction upon distinction, an eye for the shadows of a shade. The\r\npoints are no longer of living interest, but they exhibit a side of him\r\nthat is less visible in his broader performances of parliament or\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, Mr. Adams was instructed to solicit redress\r\nfor the doings of the _Alabama_. Lord Russell (Dec. 19, 1862), declaring\r\nthat government had used every effort to stop her, refused to admit that\r\nwe were under any obligation whatever to make compensation. Two years\r\nlater (Aug. 30, 1865) he still declined both compensation and a proposal\r\nfor arbitration. This opened a long struggle of extreme interest in the\r\nministerial life of Mr. Gladstone, and, what was more, in the history of\r\ncivilised nations. It was arbitration upon these issues that now began to\r\ndivide politicians both inside the cabinet and outside, just as mediation\r\nand recognition had divided them in the earlier stages of the American\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\n(M130) In 1863 Mr. Adams was the first to point to what after a long\r\nstruggle became the solution of these difficulties, by assuring Lord\r\nRussell that there was “no fair and equitable form of conventional\r\narbitrament or reference” to which America would not be willing to submit.\r\nIn 1865 (Sept. 2) Mr. Gladstone wrote a letter to Lord Russell, the reply\r\nto which has already been published.(257) Always jealous for cabinet\r\nauthority, he began by submitting to Lord Russell that he had no idea that\r\na despatch refusing arbitration was to be written, without a cabinet being\r\nheld upon a subject so important. As it was, they had not disposed of the\r\nquestion or even discussed it. On the merits, he inclined to believe that\r\nthe demand for arbitration was highly unreasonable; still though not\r\ndisposed to say “Yes” to the demand, he doubted “No.” The proper course\r\nwould be to lead the Americans to bring out the whole of their case, so\r\nthat the cabinet might have all the pleas before them previously to coming\r\nto “a decision of great delicacy and moment.”\r\n\r\nLord Russell stood to his guns. “The question,” he said, “has been the\r\nprincipal object of my thoughts for the last two years, and I confess I\r\nthink that paying twenty millions down would be far preferable to\r\nsubmitting the case to arbitration.” England would be disgraced for ever\r\nif a foreign government were left to arbitrate whether an English\r\nsecretary of state had been diligent or negligent in his duties, and\r\nwhether an English law officer was partial and prejudiced in giving his\r\nopinion of English law. There the matter stood, and the moral war\r\nsmouldered on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1870, the time arrived when Mr. Gladstone himself, no longer a minister\r\nthird in standing in a Palmerston government, was called upon to deal with\r\nthis great issue as a principal in his own administration. In 1868 the\r\nconservative government had agreed to a convention, by which a mixed\r\ncommission, British and American, sitting in London should decide upon the\r\nsettlement of all claims by the subjects of either country upon the other;\r\nand in respect of what were known generically as the _Alabama_ Claims,\r\nproposing to refer these to the arbitration of the head of some friendly\r\nstate, in case the mixed commission should not agree. The idea of a\r\ncomposite court or tribunal, as distinguished from a single sovereign\r\narbitrator, had not yet risen above the horizon. Before this project\r\nripened, Mr. Disraeli was out of government, Lord Clarendon had taken Lord\r\nStanley’s place at the foreign office, and the convention, with some\r\nmodifications, was signed by him (Jan. 14, 1869), and in due course\r\ndespatched to Washington. There the Senate, not on the merits but for\r\nparty and personal reasons, refused to ratify. Though this attempt failed,\r\nneither of the two English political parties was in a position any longer\r\nto refuse arbitration in principle.\r\n\r\nAgreement in principle is of little avail, without driving force enough\r\nfor practice. The driving force was found mainly from a gradual change in\r\nEnglish sentiment, though the difficulties with Russia also counted for\r\nsomething. Even so early as 1863 the tide of popular opinion in England\r\nhad begun slowly to swell in favour of the Northern cause. In 1866 victory\r\nacross the Atlantic was decided, the union was saved, and slavery was\r\ngone. A desire to remove causes of difference between ourselves and the\r\nUnited States grew at a remarkable speed, for the spectacle of success is\r\nwont to have magical effects even in minds that would indignantly reject\r\nthe standards of Machiavelli. While benevolent feeling gained volume in\r\nthis country, statesmen in America took ground that made the satisfaction\r\nof it harder. They began to base their claim for reparation on the\r\noriginal proclamation of British neutrality when the American conflict\r\nbegan. First made in 1866, this new pretension was repeated in despatches\r\nof 1867, and in 1869 the American secretary formally recorded the\r\ncomplaint that the Southern insurrection obtained its enduring vitality by\r\nresources drawn from England, and as a consequence of England’s imperfect\r\ndischarge of her duties as neutral. England became, they said, the\r\narsenal, the navy-yard, and the treasury of the insurgent Confederacy.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of the Clarendon convention of 1869 Mr. Sumner—a man of\r\nsome great qualities, but too often the slave of words where he thought\r\nhimself their master—made an extravagant speech against the British\r\ngovernment in the senate, assessing the claim of the United States upon\r\nthis country on principles that would have raised it to the modest figure\r\nof some four hundred million pounds sterling due from us to them, or, as\r\nMr. Gladstone himself estimated it, to sixteen hundred millions. It does\r\nnot matter which. This was only a violent and fantastic exaggeration of an\r\nidea of constructive claims for indirect damages that lay slumbering, but\r\nby no means extinct, in American minds, until, as we shall see, in 1872 it\r\nvery nearly led to a disastrous explosion. This idea first found distinct\r\nand official utterance in the despatch of 1869. Besides compensating\r\nindividuals for depredations, we were to pay for the cost to America of\r\nchasing the cruisers; for the transfer of most of the American commercial\r\nmarine to the British flag; for enhanced insurance; and generally for the\r\nincreased difficulty of putting down the rebellion.\r\n\r\nAll through 1870 a rather troublesome exchange of letters went on between\r\nWashington and the foreign office, and Mr. Gladstone took an active\r\nconcern in it. “I grieve to trouble you with so much manuscript,” Lord\r\nClarendon writes him on one occasion (Mar. 17, 1870), “but I don’t venture\r\nsingle-handed to conduct a correspondence with the United States.... All\r\nthis correspondence can do nothing but harm, and I have made my answer as\r\nshort as is consistent with courtesy. I should like to send it on\r\nSaturday, but if you have not time to look at it, or think it ought to be\r\nseen by the cabinet, I could, make an excuse for the delay to Motley.” All\r\nthis was in entire conformity to Mr. Gladstone’s enduring conception of\r\nthe right relations between a prime minister and the foreign secretary. We\r\nneed not follow details, but one must not be omitted. In 1868 a royal\r\ncommission recommended various material changes in the Foreign Enlistment\r\nAct, and in 1870 accordingly a new law was passed, greatly strengthening\r\nthe hands of the executive, and furnishing due means of self-protection\r\nagainst such nefarious manœuvres as those of the _Alabama_.(258) By this\r\nAct, among other things, it was made an offence to build a ship with\r\nreasonable cause to believe that it would be employed in the service of a\r\nforeign state at war with a friendly state.\r\n\r\nAs the year 1870 went on, the expediency of an accommodation with America\r\nstrengthened in Mr. Gladstone’s mind. One member of the cabinet pointed\r\nout to the foreign secretary that if there was any chance of a war with\r\nRussia about the Black Sea, it would be as well to get causes of\r\ndifferences with America out of the way; otherwise, however unprepared the\r\nUnited States might be at the moment, we should undoubtedly have them on\r\nour hands sooner or later.(259) With Mr. Gladstone the desire was not a\r\nconsequence of the possible troubles with Russia. His view was wider and\r\nless specific. He was alive to the extent to which England’s power in\r\nEurope was reduced by the smothered quarrel with America, but he took even\r\nhigher ground than this in his sense of the blessing to the world of an\r\nabsolute reconciliation in good faith between the old England and the new.\r\nAt first the government proposed (Nov. 28, 1870) to send over Sir John\r\nRose to America. He was one of the many Scots who have carried the British\r\nflag in its best colours over the face of the globe; his qualities had\r\nraised him to great prominence in Canada; he had enjoyed good\r\nopportunities of measuring the American ground; he was shrewd, wise, well\r\nread in the ways of men and the book of the world, and he had besides the\r\nvirtue of being pleasant. Rose himself did not formally undertake the\r\nmission, but he applied himself with diligence and success to bring the\r\nAmerican government to the project of a joint high commission to examine\r\nand consider a situation that there was a common desire to terminate.\r\n\r\n(M131) On Feb. 1, 1871, Mr. Gladstone was able to report to the Queen the\r\narrival of news that the government of the United States were willing to\r\nconcur in a commission for the discussion of international questions at\r\npresent depending, without a previous understanding that liability in\r\nrespect of the _Alabama_ was to be acknowledged by this country. The\r\ncabinet naturally thought that on this they might close, and they at once\r\nconsidered the composition of the commission and the proper instructions.\r\nLord de Grey consented to be its president. Lord Derby, on being invited\r\nto join the commission, was very grateful for the compliment but declined,\r\nbeing of opinion that firmness and not concession to the Americans was\r\nwhat was wanted. Sir George Grey declined; so did Lord Halifax. “I asked\r\nNorthcote,” Lord Granville reports to Mr. Gladstone, “his eyes twinkled\r\nthrough his spectacles. But he said he must ask Lady Northcote, and\r\nrequested permission to consult Dizzy. The former consented, ditto Dizzy,\r\nwhich looks well.” So the commission was made up of Lord de Grey as the\r\nhead of it, Northcote, Thornton (the British minister at Washington), Sir\r\nJohn Macdonald, as the representative of Canada, and Mr. Mountague\r\nBernard, a theoretic jurist, who had written a book about our neutrality\r\nthe year before.(260)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe personal relations of Lord de Grey and his brethren with their\r\nAmerican colleagues were excellent. They worked hard all day, and enjoyed\r\nWashington hospitality in its full strength every night. In business, Mr.\r\nFish occasionally advanced or supported contentions thought by the\r\nEnglishmen to be almost amusing. For instance, Mr. Sumner in a memorandum\r\n(Jan. 17, 1871) to Mr. Fish, had submitted a singular species of political\r\nsyllogism. He desired nothing so much, he said, as that entire goodwill\r\nshould prevail between Great Britain and the United States, and that the\r\nsettlement should be complete. Now the greatest trouble and peril in the\r\nway of a complete settlement was Fenianism; Fenianism was excited by the\r\nproximity of the British flag over the Canadian border; therefore, the\r\nBritish flag should be withdrawn from the whole hemisphere, including the\r\nislands, and the American flag should fly in its stead. In conformity with\r\nthis tight and simple chain of reasoning, Mr. Fish threw out a hint to\r\nLord de Grey that the cession of Canada might end the quarrel. The English\r\nenvoy contented himself with the dry remark that he did not find such a\r\nsuggestion in his instructions.(261)\r\n\r\nThough sometimes amused, the commissioners soon understood that at heart\r\nthe American negotiators desired to settle. Difficulties with their own\r\npeople were great. A presidential campaign with all its necessities\r\napproached. A settlement of outstanding accounts with England might be a\r\ngood card to play in the election; on the other hand, if the peace card\r\nwere not available, it was just possible that a war card might do nearly\r\nas well. Mr. Fish was mortally afraid of Sumner, who had been chairman of\r\nthe foreign relations committee in the senate, and whose anti-English\r\ntemper, as we have seen, was red-hot. The constitutional requirement of a\r\ntwo-thirds majority in the senate for the ratification of a treaty was\r\nawkward and menacing, and it was necessary to secure dubious senators by\r\nthe exhibition of high national temper on the public stage. It is\r\ninteresting to note, in passing, that the English visitors were persuaded\r\nhow much better it would have been if, according to our own parliamentary\r\nsystem at Westminster, the American system had allowed Mr. Fish to meet\r\nMr. Sumner on the floor of congress, and instead of seeking victory by\r\nunseen manipulation, fight the battle out before the country.\r\n\r\n(M132) The British commissioners were almost as much embarrassed by their\r\nfriends at home as by their friends or foes at Washington. Both ministers\r\nand lawyers, from the safe distance of Downing Street, were sometimes\r\nexcessive in pressing small and trivial alterations, which the Americans\r\nafter the diplomatist’s manner insisted on treating as if they were not\r\nsmall but great. The sharp corner in the London cabinet was the more\r\nserious proposal, that certain rules as to the duty of neutrals should be\r\nlaid down, and should be made guiding principles for the arbitrators,\r\nalthough the rules themselves had not been formally established when\r\nEngland’s alleged breaches of neutral obligation had been committed. This\r\nretro-active or _ex-post-facto_ quality, when the cabinet considered it\r\n(March 18), gave trouble, and it was used by passionate and impolitic\r\npersons to tarnish the whole policy in this country. Much heat was evoked,\r\nfor a cabinet of many talents is not always the same thing as a cabinet of\r\nplain minds. One clever man objected at large to the commission, to\r\nconcession, to obtaining any principle of settlement for future\r\ncontingencies. A second was violent against all such arbitration as this,\r\nand thought they had much better pay up at once and have done with it. A\r\nthird clever man even let fall some high words about “national dishonour.”\r\nGranville, Argyll, Forster (the last described by a colleague as “a tower\r\nof strength”), were steadfast and unfaltering for conciliation. Mr.\r\nGladstone agreed, but eager though he was for a settlement, he “agreed\r\nwith reluctance.” Sir Roundell Palmer had now great influence with him,\r\nand Palmer had come round to the conclusion that the risk from translating\r\nretrospectively into the form of a hypothetical international convention,\r\nnot existing when the events happened, a duty that we had recognised as\r\nincumbent on us under our own law, might be safely run.(262) In plain\r\nEnglish, the adverse way of describing this peculiar substitute for a free\r\nand open arbitration, was that Great Britain owed the Americans nothing,\r\nand if she had not consented to accept a set of new-fangled rules, and to\r\nbe judged retro-actively by them, she could not possibly have been made to\r\npay anything. To this the short answer was that though the rules might or\r\nmight not be new-fangled as principles of international law, yet they were\r\nnot new as principles of English municipal law, which, as construed by the\r\nBritish government itself, was coincident in substance with those rules.\r\nWas it in fact reasonable to contend that ironclads might be built in the\r\nMersey, sent out a few miles beyond the river mouth, there armed from\r\nlighters, and sent off to bombard New York? If not, was it reasonable that\r\nEngland should invite the arbitrators to judge the _Alabama_ case\r\naccording to one rule in the past, and then to lay down another rule for\r\nthe future?\r\n\r\nA minor objection raised by Mr. Gladstone gave much alarm to his\r\ncommissioners, and it is too characteristic to be omitted. Speaking of the\r\nardently desired treaty, he writes to Lord Granville (April 12, 1871):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    With regard to the preamble, it designates the late war in America\r\n    as “the rebellion.” I do not think it is right for us now to adopt\r\n    a mode of speech different from that which we maintained\r\n    throughout the struggle. Further, it tends to discredit our\r\n    recognition of belligerency. And if we declare it a rebellion, we\r\n    have given an example available to be quoted hereafter for the\r\n    dealings of a foreign power with rebels as belligerents. If, on\r\n    the other hand, the Americans object to speaking of the “civil\r\n    war,” it is quite easy (so I think) to leave out the words “during\r\n    the recent rebellion in the U.S.” altogether, and to say in the\r\n    years 186—or even to begin “Whereas H.B.M.” perhaps inserting in\r\n    after “U.S.” “in respect of such depredations.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an instance of the tenacity with which he sometimes held his\r\nground after its relations and bearings had entirely changed. Something\r\ntoo may doubtless be set down to the lingering remains of his old feeling,\r\nof the strength of the constitutional argument of the South that sovereign\r\nstates had a right to withdraw from the union if they pleased. If the\r\nproposal to drop the word “rebellion” had been brought without warning or\r\npreparation before the full commission, assent would have been hopeless,\r\nbut by the discretion of informal interviews, the matter was canvassed\r\nbeforehand, the obnoxious word was silently left out, Mr. Gladstone’s\r\npoint was gained, and things went prosperously forward. “I am quite sure,”\r\nwrote Sir Stafford Northcote to Mr. Gladstone (March 17), “that there was\r\nno other way in which you could have hoped to settle these questions than\r\nby such a commission as ours.... What may be our fate I do not presume to\r\nguess, but if we succeed, it will be mainly due to de Grey’s excellent\r\nsense, tact, and temper.” In the end, notwithstanding the power of the\r\nsenate over treaties, the want of control by the American government over\r\nits party, and the exigencies of Canada, all at last fell into decent\r\nshape, and the substantial objects in view were effectively maintained.\r\nCanadian fishery questions were adjusted, and the boundary of San Juan\r\nremitted to the arbitration of the newly made German Emperor.\r\n\r\n(M133) After thirty-seven sittings, spread over a period of two months,\r\nthe treaty was signed on May 8, in a room decorated with flowers, with the\r\ngood omen of brilliant sunshine, and everybody in such good humour that\r\nthe American secretary of the commission tossed up with Lord Tenterden\r\nwhich should sign first,—the Englishman happily winning. The treaty began\r\nby the declaration that her Britannic Majesty authorised the commissioners\r\nto express in a friendly spirit the regret felt by her Majesty’s\r\ngovernment for the escape, under whatever circumstances, of the _Alabama_\r\nand other vessels from British ports, and for the depredations committed\r\nby these vessels. It embraced a definition of the rules of maritime\r\nneutrality, which some legal text-writers have applauded, and other legal\r\ntext-writers have therefore condemned. Finally, and most important of all,\r\nwhether we look at the immediate purpose or at its contribution to a great\r\nthough slow-moving cause, the treaty of Washington secured a judgment by\r\nthe arbitration of a tribunal, of all claims growing out of acts committed\r\nby the cruisers, “and generically known as the _Alabama_ Claims.” The\r\ntribunal was to consist of five members named by Great Britain, the United\r\nStates, Switzerland, Italy, and Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the rules of Washington as applied at Geneva remains, as I\r\nhave said, a topic of controversy. Maine, for example, while admitting\r\nthat the result for the occasion was good, holds that by making the rule\r\nof neutral duty more severe, it marked reaction rather than progress in\r\nthe general drift of international law.(263) Others maintain that the\r\namended foreign enlistment Act of 1870, which is in fact a partial\r\nincorporation of the Washington rules, went far beyond what international\r\nlaw requires, and made a new crime out of an act, namely the building of a\r\nship, which is not forbidden either by the law of nations or by other\r\nmunicipal laws.(264)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M134) Once, after some crowning mercy in the war, President Lincoln said\r\nto his cabinet, “Now, gentlemen, we have got our harpoon into the monster,\r\nbut we must still take uncommon care, or else by a single flop of his tail\r\nhe will send us into all eternity.” This wholesome caution, too often\r\noverlooked by headlong politicians, was suddenly found to be much needed\r\nat the eleventh hour of the treaty of Washington. At the end of 1871, Mr.\r\nGladstone experienced a severe shock, for he found that the case put in by\r\nAmerica for the arbitrators insisted upon an adjudication by them not only\r\nupon the losses suffered by individual American citizens, but upon the\r\nindirect, constructive, consequential, and national claims first\r\npropounded in their full dimensions by Mr. Sumner. A storm at once arose\r\nin England, and nobody was more incensed than the prime minister. In\r\nreporting to the Queen, he used language of extreme vehemence, and in the\r\nHouse of Commons (Feb. 9, 1872) when Mr. Disraeli spoke of the indirect\r\nclaims as preposterous and wild, as nothing less than the exacting of\r\ntribute from a conquered people, Mr. Gladstone declared that such words\r\nwere in truth rather under the mark than an exaggeration, and went on to\r\nsay that “we must be insane to accede to demands which no nation with a\r\nspark of honour or spirit left could submit to even at the point of\r\ndeath.” Speaking of the construction put upon the treaty by the\r\ngovernment, he declared such a construction to be “the true and\r\nunambiguous meaning of the words, and therefore the only meaning\r\nadmissible, whether tried by grammar, by reason, by policy, or by any\r\nother standard.” Some persons argued that this was to accuse the Americans\r\nof dishonesty. “I learn really for the first time,” exclaimed Mr.\r\nGladstone to Lord Granville (Feb. 8), “that a man who affirms that in his\r\nopinion a document is unambiguous in his favour, thereby affirms that one\r\nwho reads it otherwise is dishonest.” His critics retorted that surely a\r\nconstruction that could not stand the test of grammar, of reason, of\r\npolicy, or any other test, must be due either to insanity or to\r\ndishonesty; and as we could hardly assume General Grant, Mr. Fish, and the\r\nothers to be out of their wits, there was nothing for it but dishonesty.\r\n\r\nFor five anxious months the contest lasted. The difficulties were those of\r\ntime and form, often worse than those of matter and substance. Nor would\r\nthis have been the first case in which small points hinder the settlement\r\nof great questions. The manner of proceeding, as Mr. Gladstone reports to\r\nthe Queen, was of such complication that hours were given almost every day\r\nfor many weeks, to the consideration of matter which on the day following\r\nwas found to have moved out of view. Suggestions came from Washington,\r\nmostly inadmissible, whether their faults were due to accident and haste\r\nor to design. Sometimes refusals of this suggestion or that from our side\r\nwere couched in “terms of scant courtesy and bordering upon harshness.”\r\nStill the cabinet persisted in husbanding every chance of saving the\r\ntreaty. They charitably judged the attitude of the Washington government,\r\nin Mr. Gladstone’s ample language, “to be directed by considerations\r\nbelonging to the sphere of its own domestic policy, and to the contentions\r\nof party in that sphere. But they will attempt by patient consideration,\r\navoidance of self-laudation and of irritating topics, and a steady\r\nendeavour to be right, to attain the great end in view of an honourable\r\nsettlement which it would be a sad disgrace as well as misfortune to both\r\ncountries now to miss.” And here occurs a consideration as we pass, upon\r\nthe American constitution. “The fact remains indisputable (June 1), that\r\nthere is no conclusive evidence of any serious subject the substance of\r\nwhich is at present in dispute between the two governments, but the\r\ndifficulties arising on the American side from what may be termed\r\nelectioneering considerations are greatly aggravated by the position of\r\nthe American senate and the reference to that body for previous counsel,\r\nfor which it seems to be miserably unsuited, as it takes days and almost\r\nweeks for debate, where a cabinet would require only hours.”\r\n\r\nThe opposition in parliament was patriotic, and as a rule made no\r\ndifficulties. “Mr. Disraeli,” reports Mr. Gladstone (June 3), “behaved\r\nwith the caution and moderation which have generally marked his conduct\r\nwith, regard to the Washington treaty.... On the whole the House of\r\nCommons showed the same dignified self-command for which it has been\r\nremarkable during the whole period since the opening of the session with\r\nreference to this question; although the more inflammatory expressions,\r\nwhich fell from a few members, were warmly cheered by a portion, and a\r\nportion only, of the opposition.”\r\n\r\nThe cabinet was unanimous against the submission of the indirect claims,\r\nbut there were marked differences of leaning, as in fact there had been\r\nthroughout. All accepted Lord Ripon’s(265) view that if he had insisted on\r\ngetting into the treaty nothing less than a formal and express repudiation\r\nof the indirect claims, no treaty at all would have been possible. Both\r\nsides in the Washington conferences had been more anxious to submit to the\r\narbitrators the principle of allowing indirect claims, than to embark on\r\nany discussion of them. The American commissioners knew this principle to\r\nbe unsound, but knowing also that their own people expected the claims to\r\nbe referred, they could only abstain from insisting on their inclusion.\r\nThe British commissioners were willing silently to waive an express\r\nrenunciation of them, being confident that the terms of the protocols and\r\nthe language of the treaty would be so construed by the arbitrators as to\r\nexclude the indirect claims.(266) All this was a rational and truly\r\ndiplomatic temper on both sides; but then the immortal events of a hundred\r\nyears before had shown too plainly that Englishmen at home cannot always\r\nbe trusted to keep a rational and diplomatic temper; and many events in\r\nthe interval had shown that English colonists, even when transfigured into\r\nAmerican citizens, were still chips of the old block. The cabinet agreed\r\nthat a virtual waiver of the claims was to be found both in the protocols\r\nof the conference, and in the language of the treaty. Lord Ripon and Mr.\r\nForster, however, thought it would be safe to go on at Geneva, in the\r\nassurance that the arbitrators would be certain to rule the indirect\r\nclaims out. At the other extreme of the cabinet scale, the view was urged\r\nthat England should not go on, unless she put upon record a formal\r\ndeclaration that did she not, and never would, assent to any adjudication\r\nupon the indirect claims. To a certain minister who pressed for some\r\ndeclaration in this sense,—also formulated in a motion by Lord Russell in\r\nparliament, himself responsible for so much of the original\r\nmischief(267)—Mr. Gladstone wrote as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _June 17._—... I doubt whether the cabinet can legitimately be\r\n    asked, as a cabinet, to make these affirmations, inasmuch as,\r\n    according to my view, they are not within the purview of its\r\n    present undertaking—that undertaking has reference exclusively to\r\n    the scope of the arbitration. We have contended all along that the\r\n    claims would not legitimately come before the arbitrators.... But\r\n    we had never demanded the assent of the Americans to our\r\n    reasoning, only to our conclusion that the claims were not within\r\n    the scope of the arbitration. It is my view (but this is quite\r\n    another matter) that they lie cast aside, a dishonoured carcass,\r\n    which no amount of force, fraud, or folly can again galvanise into\r\n    life. You will see then, in sum, that (if I rightly understand\r\n    you) I accept for myself broadly and freely what may be called the\r\n    extreme doctrine _about_ the indirect claims; but I think the\r\n    cabinet cannot fairly be challenged for an official judgment on a\r\n    matter really not before it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little entries in the diary give us a good idea of the pressure on the\r\nprime minister:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 6, 1872._—Spoke an hour after Disraeli on the address....\r\n    The _Alabama_ and Washington question lay heavy on me till the\r\n    evening. Even during the speech I was disquieted, and had to\r\n    converse with my colleagues. _March 16._—Cabinet 2¾-7; laborious\r\n    chiefly on the Washington treaty. _17th._—Worked on part of the\r\n    despatch for America. _18th._—In conclave. Much heavy work on\r\n    _Alabama_. _22nd._—Severe bronchial attack. Transacted business\r\n    through West, W. H. G. [his son] Mr. Glyn, Lord Granville, and\r\n    Cardwell, who went to and fro between the cabinet below-stairs and\r\n    me. To all of them I whispered with some difficulty. _April\r\n    5._—Conclave on countercase. First with Cardwell and Lowe, then\r\n    with Tenterden and Sanderson. Much confusion. _May 12._—Saw Lord\r\n    Granville, who brought good news from America. _27th._—U.S.\r\n    question bristles with difficulties. _30th._—H. of C. During the\r\n    evening two long conferences on Washington treaty with Lord G. and\r\n    the lawyers, and a cabinet 10-1. Worked Uniformity bill through\r\n    committee at intervals. _June 3._—Cabinet 3-4-1/4. H. of C. Made a\r\n    statement on the treaty of Washington. The house behaved _well_.\r\n    Also got the Act of Uniformity bill read a third time. Its\r\n    preamble is really a notable fact in 1872. _6th._—H. of C. Spoke\r\n    on Washington treaty and Scots Education—the House _too_ well\r\n    pleased as to the former. _11th._—The cabinet met at 2. and sat\r\n    intermittently with the House to 5¾, again 9-1/4-1.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M135) The arbitrators were to meet on June 15. Yet no break in the clouds\r\nseemed likely. Mr. Gladstone and his colleagues had a meeting at the\r\nforeign office, and did not separate until after midnight on June 11. The\r\nBritish agent was to be directed to apply for an immediate adjournment,\r\nand without lodging the summary of our case as provided by the treaty. If\r\nthe arbitrators declined to adjourn, either because the Americans\r\nobjected, or from a belief that they had no title to adjourn without a\r\nformal opening of business by lodging summaries, then was or was not our\r\nagent to change tack and lodge his summary? Or was the arbitration, and\r\nwith the arbitration the whole treaty, to fall to the ground for want of\r\nit? On this question Mr. Gladstone thought it his duty to mention to the\r\nQueen that it had not yet (June 13) been found possible to bring the\r\ncabinet to a decision. For a day or two it looked as if the ministry might\r\nfall to pieces, but the head of it was indomitable:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _June 13_ (Thursday).—Since Tuesday morning I have constantly\r\n    resolved or discussed this proposition: that we should not be\r\n    justified in breaking off the proceedings at Geneva (if an\r\n    adjournment can be had after presentation of the summary), upon a\r\n    refusal to present it. My determination upon it is now firmly\r\n    rooted and tested by all the mental effort I can apply, and the\r\n    time I thought had come to-day for looking forward as well as\r\n    backward. I therefore wrote to the Queen in terms which might a\r\n    little prepare her for difficulties in the cabinet. I saw\r\n    Granville first, who had not reached my point, but seemed to come\r\n    up to it; then arranged for him to see Halifax, Ripon to see\r\n    Kimberley, and the chancellor [Lowe] to see Cardwell; as the\r\n    _knot_ of the probable difficulty is in these three. On the whole,\r\n    I hope we shall, in one way or another, work through. _At any\r\n    rate, if anything like a government can be held together, I will\r\n    not shrink._\r\n\r\n    _June 15._—Cabinet 12-2-1/4, and with brief intervals to 7-½.\r\n    Dined with Princess Louise. After dinner Granville and I went to\r\n    see Mr. Hammond, then on to the F. 0., where we got (before\r\n    midnight) the protocol of to-day from Geneva. Thank God that up to\r\n    a certain point the indications on this great controversy are\r\n    decidedly favourable.\r\n\r\n    _June 16._—Sunday (Bunker Hill anniversary? [No—June 17]). Cabinet\r\n    here 1-½-3-1/4. We sent off a telegram, which I hope may finish\r\n    the good work at Geneva.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat happened at Geneva was this. When the day came, the British agent did\r\nnot lodge his summary, but asked for an adjournment for eight months, as\r\nthe two governments did not agree upon the scope of the arbitration. This\r\nlooked dark enough, and the treaty seemed doomed. It was saved by Mr.\r\nAdams, the American nominee on the tribunal. When he reached Geneva and\r\nlearned how things stood, he decided that the knot which they could not\r\nuntie must be cut.(268) His golden idea was this: the arbitrators should\r\nmake a spontaneous declaration that on the principles of international law\r\nthe indirect claims ought to be excluded from their consideration. Adams\r\nsaw his colleagues one by one, and brought them round to his view. The\r\nEnglish chief justice had made up his mind that the whole thing was dead,\r\nas he had for many months been loudly telling all London that it ought to\r\nbe. But when asked by Mr. Adams whether the spontaneous extra-judicial\r\ndeclaration would remove all obstacles to progress, Cockburn answered that\r\nhe thought it would. “I said,” Mr. Adams continued, “that in that event I\r\nwas prepared to make a proposition. I should be assuming a heavy\r\nresponsibility; but I should do so, not as an arbitrator representing my\r\ncountry, but as representing all nations.” So the indirect claims were\r\nsummarily ruled out, and the arbitration proceeded. In some notes prepared\r\nfor the cabinet on all these proceedings (Feb. 4, 1873), Lord Tenterden,\r\nthe clever and experienced British agent at Geneva, writes, “I cannot\r\nconclude this part of the memorandum without saying that the dignity,\r\ntact, self-command, and moderation with which Mr. Adams discharged his\r\nfunctions as arbitrator, did honour to his country.”\r\n\r\n(M136) In September (1872) the five arbitrators at Geneva gave their\r\naward. They were unanimous in finding Great Britain liable for the acts of\r\nthe _Alabama_; all save the British representative found her liable for\r\nthe _Florida_; the Italian, the Swiss, and the American against the\r\nEnglishman and the Brazilian found her liable for the _Shenandoah_ after\r\nleaving Melbourne. They awarded in satisfaction and final settlement of\r\nall claims, including interest, a gross sum of about three and a quarter\r\nmillion pounds sterling. The award, though hardly a surprise, still\r\ninflicted a lively twinge of mortification on the masterful and confident\r\npeople of this island. Opinion was divided, but the decision was not one\r\nof those that cut deep or raise the public temperature to fever. The\r\nprints of the opposition insisted that the result was profoundly\r\nvexatious, it was a bungled settlement, and the arguments used in favour\r\nof it were “wild sentimental rubbish.” On the other hand, the _Times_\r\nregarded it with profound satisfaction, and ministerial writers with a\r\nlyric turn hailed it as a magnificent victory, though we had to pay a\r\nheavy bill. A little balm was extracted from the fact that the Americans\r\nhad preferred before the tribunal a demand of nine millions and a half,\r\nand thus got little more than one-third of what they had asked. So ended\r\nwhat has been called the greatest of all arbitrations, extinguishing the\r\nembers that could not have been left to smoulder without constant peril of\r\na vast and fratricidal conflagration. The treaty of Washington and the\r\nGeneva arbitration stand out as the most notable victory in the nineteenth\r\ncentury of the noble art of preventive diplomacy, and the most signal\r\nexhibition in their history of self-command in two of the three chief\r\ndemocratic powers of the western world. For the moment the result did\r\nsomething to impair the popularity of Mr. Gladstone’s government, but his\r\nassociation with this high act of national policy is one of the things\r\nthat give its brightest lustre to his fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X. As Head Of A Cabinet. (1868-1874)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Rational co-operation in politics would be at an end, if no two\r\n    men might act together, until they had satisfied themselves that\r\n    in no possible circumstances could they be divided.—GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe just complacency with which Mr. Gladstone regarded his cabinet on its\r\nfirst construction held good:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I look back with great satisfaction on the internal working of the\r\n    cabinet of 1868-74. It was a cabinet easily handled; and yet it\r\n    was the only one of my four cabinets in which there were members\r\n    who were senior to myself (the lord chancellor Hatherley, Lord\r\n    Clarendon), with many other men of long ministerial experience.\r\n    When this cabinet was breaking up in 1874, I took the opportunity\r\n    of thanking them for the manner in which they had uniformly\r\n    lightened my task in the direction of business. In reply, Halifax,\r\n    who might be considered as the senior in years and experience\r\n    taken jointly, very handsomely said the duty of the cabinet had\r\n    been made more easy by the considerate manner in which I had\r\n    always treated them. Some of them were as colleagues absolutely\r\n    delightful, from the manner in which their natural qualities\r\n    blended with their consummate experience. I refer especially to\r\n    Clarendon and Granville.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M137) If we may trust some of those who were members of it, no cabinet\r\never did its business with livelier industry or effect. Under Mr.\r\nGladstone’s hand it was a really working cabinet, not an assemblage of\r\ndepartmental ministers, each minding his own affairs, available as casual\r\nmembers of this or the other sub-committee, and without an eye for the\r\ngeneral drift and tendency of their proceedings. Of course ministers\r\ndiffered in importance. One was pleasant and popular, but not forcible.\r\nAnother overflowed with knowledge and was really an able man, but somehow\r\nhe carried no guns, and nobody cared what he said. One had aptitude\r\nwithout weight—perhaps the true definition of our grossly overworked\r\nepithet of clever. Another had weight and character, without much\r\naptitude. The cabinet as a whole was one of extraordinary power, not\r\nmerely because its chief had both aptitude and momentum enough for a\r\ndozen, but because it was actively homogeneous in reforming spirit and\r\npurpose. This solidarity is the great element in such combinations, and\r\nthe mainspring of all vigorous cabinet work.\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Gladstone as head of his first cabinet, we have a glimpse from Mr.\r\nStansfeld:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gladstone’s conduct in the cabinet was very curious. When I\r\n    first joined in 1871, I naturally thought that his position was so\r\n    commanding, that he would be able to say, “This is my policy;\r\n    accept it or not as you like.” But he did not. He was always\r\n    profuse in his expressions of respect for the cabinet. There was a\r\n    wonderful combination in Mr. Gladstone of imperiousness and of\r\n    deference. In the cabinet he would assume that he was nothing. I\r\n    thought he should have said, “This is my policy. What do you think\r\n    of it?” and then have fought it out until they had come to an\r\n    agreement. He always tried to lead them on by unconscious steps to\r\n    his own conclusions.(269)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this we may add some words of Lord Granville used in 1883, but\r\ndoubtless just as true of 1868-74:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have served under several prime ministers, men for whom I had\r\n    high respect and to whom I had the greatest attachment, but I can\r\n    say that I never knew one who showed a finer temper, a greater\r\n    patience, or more consideration for his colleagues than Mr.\r\n    Gladstone in all deliberations on any important subject. In his\r\n    official position, with his knowledge, with his ability, and with\r\n    the wonderful power of work that characterises him, he of course\r\n    has an immense influence on the deliberations of the cabinet; but\r\n    notwithstanding his tenacity of purpose and his earnestness, it is\r\n    quite extraordinary how he attends to the arguments of all, and,\r\n    except on any question of real vital principle, he is ready to\r\n    yield his own opinion to the general sense of the colleagues over\r\n    whom he presides.(270)\r\n\r\n\r\nImputing his own qualities to others, and always keen to make the best of\r\npeople and not the worst, if he had once invited a man to office, he held\r\non to him to the last possible moment. “The next most serious thing to\r\nadmitting a man into the cabinet,” he said, “is to leave a man out who has\r\nonce been in.” Not seldom he carried his invincible courtesy, deference,\r\nand toleration even beyond the domain where those qualities ought to be\r\nsupreme. This was part of what men meant, when they said that life was to\r\nhim in all its aspects an application of Christian teaching and example.\r\nTo this we must add another consideration of first importance, and one\r\nthat vulgar criticism of great statesmen too commonly ignores. In the\r\nwords of Lord Aberdeen (1856), who knew from sharp experience how much his\r\ndoctrine might cost a man: “A prime minister is not a free agent. To break\r\nup a government, to renounce all the good you hoped to do and leave\r\nimperfect all the good you have done, to hand over power to persons whose\r\nobjects or whose measures you disapprove, even merely to alienate and\r\npolitically to injure your friends, is no slight matter.”(271)\r\n\r\nA member of this first cabinet wrote to Mr. Gladstone long after it had\r\ncome to an end: “I suppose there was no one of your then colleagues less\r\nsympathetic with you, less in tune with your opinions and enthusiasms than\r\nLowe. Nevertheless this happened to me with him—after you had resigned.\r\nLowe opened to me one day, on the subject of your relations with your\r\ncolleagues. He spoke in terms of warm admiration, and to my great\r\nsurprise, ended by saying, ‘I have the same kind of feeling towards him\r\nthat I can suppose must be the feeling of a dog for his master.’ Lowe is a\r\nperfectly sincere man. He would not have said this if he had not felt it.”\r\n“In everything personal,” Mr. Gladstone replied, “Lowe was an excellent\r\ncolleague and member of cabinet. But I had never been in personal\r\nrelations with him before, and at the outset of the ministry of 1868 I\r\nknew very little of him. Moreover, he was the occasion of much trouble to\r\nme by his incessant broils with ——, who was an awkward customer.” In sheer\r\nintellect Mr. Gladstone held that Lowe had not many equals, but in nobody\r\nelse did he discover so many mixed and contradictory qualities—“splendid\r\nin attack, but most weak in defence, at times exhibiting pluck beyond\r\nmeasure, but at other times pusillanimity almost amounting to cowardice;\r\none day headstrong and independent, and the next day helpless as a child\r\nto walk alone; capable of tearing anything to pieces, but of constructing\r\nnothing.”(272)\r\n\r\n(M138) When Lord Clarendon died,—“An irreparable colleague,” Mr. Gladstone\r\nnotes in his diary, “a statesman of many gifts, a most lovable and genial\r\nman.” Elsewhere he commemorates his “unswerving loyalty, his genial\r\ntemper, his kindness ever overflowing in acts yet more than in words, his\r\nliberal and indulgent appreciation of others.” In the short government of\r\n1865-6, Lord Granville had described Clarendon to Mr. Gladstone as\r\n“excellent, communicating more freely with the cabinet and carrying out\r\ntheir policy more faithfully, than any foreign secretary I have known.”\r\nMr. Gladstone himself told me twenty years after, that of the sixty men or\r\nso who had been his colleagues in cabinet, Clarendon was the very easiest\r\nand most attractive. It is curious to observe that, with the exception of\r\nMr. Bright, he found his most congenial adherents rather among the\r\npatrician whigs than among the men labelled as advanced.\r\n\r\nMr. Bright, as we have seen, was forced by ill-health to quit the\r\ngovernment. Thirty years of unsparing toil, more than ten of them devoted\r\nespecially to the exhausting, but in his case most fruitful, labours of\r\nthe platform, had for the time worn down his stock of that energy of mind,\r\nwhich in the more sinewy frame of the prime minister seemed as boundless\r\nas some great natural element. To Mrs. Bright Mr. Gladstone wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is not merely a selfish interest that all his colleagues feel\r\n    in him on account of his great powers, just fame, and political\r\n    importance; but it is one founded on the esteem and regard which,\r\n    one and all, they entertain towards him. God grant that any\r\n    anxieties you may entertain about him may soon be effectually\r\n    relieved. I wish I felt quite certain that he is as good a patient\r\n    as he is a colleague. But the chief object of my writing was to\r\n    say that the Queen has signified both by letter and telegraph her\r\n    lively interest in Mr. B.’s health; and she will not forgive me\r\n    unless I am able to send her frequent reports.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is quite capable of dealing faithfully with colleagues breaking rules.\r\nTo a member of the cabinet who had transgressed by absence from a division\r\nof life and death:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I should not act frankly by you if I did not state it, without\r\n    hesitation as a general and prospective proposition, that, without\r\n    reference to the likelihood or unlikelihood of defeat, upon\r\n    motions which must from their nature be votes of confidence,\r\n    [there can] be but one rule for the members of the government, and\r\n    that is to give the votes themselves which at the same time the\r\n    government with less strong title is asking from the members of\r\n    their party.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe scolds a leading minister pretty directly for placing him in a\r\ndisagreeable and rather ludicrous position, by failing to give the proper\r\ninformation about a government bill containing an important change, so\r\nthat nobody could explain the reason for it to the House. His own personal\r\nexample of absolutely unremitting attendance on the scene of action,\r\nentitled him to rebuke slackness. Nothing escaped him. Here is the way in\r\nwhich he called defaulters to their duty:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 8, 1873._—The chancellor of the exchequer thinks he has\r\n    some reason to complain of your having quitted London on Thursday,\r\n    without any prior communication with him or Glyn, four days before\r\n    the budget. I have heard with regret that the state of your health\r\n    has compelled you to spend your vacation abroad; but scarcely even\r\n    a direct medical order, and certainly in my opinion nothing less,\r\n    could render such an example innocent in its effects, as is set by\r\n    a departure from London under such circumstances. Although it has\r\n    been a great pleasure to me to admit and recognise your\r\n    parliamentary services and distinctions, and though I have always\r\n    thought your accession to the government an acquisition of great\r\n    value, I must frankly avow my opinion that it is hardly possible\r\n    for the chancellor of exchequer to discharge his duties without\r\n    your constant and sedulous co-operation, or for the official corps\r\n    in general to avoid suffering, if the members of it make\r\n    themselves the judges of the question when and under what\r\n    circumstances their absence may be permitted during the sittings\r\n    of the House.\r\n\r\n    _June 25, 1870._—I am led to suppose by your absence from the\r\n    division yesterday, that there may not be a perfectly clear\r\n    understanding between us as to the obligations of members of the\r\n    government on these occasions. Yesterday gave occasion of much\r\n    inconvenience on account of the entertainment at Windsor, but all\r\n    the members of the government who could be expected to attend\r\n    voted in the division, except yourself. I can say from my own\r\n    recollection that as far as regards political officers, the\r\n    sovereign always permits the claim of the House of Commons to\r\n    prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges among subordinate members of the government came early. Of one of\r\nthese ministers Mr. Gladstone writes to Lord Granville (August 18, 1869):\r\n“He has great talent, and is a most pertinacious worker, with a good deal\r\nof experience and widely dispersed knowledge of public affairs. But he\r\nseems to be somewhat angular, and better adapted for doing business within\r\na defined province of his own, than in common stock or partnership with\r\nothers.” Unfortunately the somewhat angular man shared his work with a\r\nchief who had intellectual angularities of his own, not very smoothly\r\nconcealed. As it happened, there was another minister of secondary rank\r\nwho did not come up to the expected mark. “Though he has great talents,\r\nremarkable power of speech, and some special qualifications for his\r\ndepartment, he has not succeeded in it with the House of Commons, and does\r\nnot seem very thoroughly to understand pecuniary responsibility and the\r\nmanagement of estimates, and there is no doubt whatever that in his\r\ndepartment the present House of Commons will be vigilant and exacting,\r\nwhile the rapid growth of its expenditures certainly shows that it should\r\nbe filled by some one capable of exercising control.” Not thoroughly “to\r\nunderstand pecuniary responsibility” was counted a deadly sin in those\r\nhalcyon days. So the transgressor accepted a diplomatic mission, and this\r\nmade room to plant his angular colleague in what seemed a “province of his\r\nown.” But few provinces are definite enough to be independent of the\r\ntreasury, and the quarrels between this minister and the chancellor of the\r\nexchequer became something of a scandal and a weakness to the government.\r\nOne of the fiercest battles of the time (1872) broke out in respect of Kew\r\nGardens between the minister with a definite province of his own and a\r\ndistinguished member of “a scientific fraternity, which, valuable as it\r\nis, has been unduly pampered of late from a variety of causes into a\r\nsomewhat overweening idea of its own importance.” The premier’s pacifying\r\nresources were taxed by this tremendous feud to the uttermost; he holds a\r\nstiffish tone to the minister, and tries balm for the _savant_ by\r\npropitiatory reminder of “a most interesting fact made known to me when I\r\nhad the pleasure and advantage of seeing you at Kew, namely the\r\npossibility of saving for purposes of food a portion of the substance of\r\nthe diseased potato. The rescue of a sensible percentage of this valuable\r\nesculent will be a noble service rendered by scientific knowledge and\r\nskill to the general community.” But science is touchy, and wounds are\r\nsometimes too deep to be healed by words.\r\n\r\n(M139) A point worth noting is his strict limitation of his own rights as\r\nhead of a government. “Hope you will not think,” he wrote to a colleague,\r\n“I am evading my duties, but while it is my duty to deal with all\r\ndifficulties arising between members of the government, it is wholly\r\nbeyond my power, and in no way belongs to my province, to examine and\r\nsettle the controversies which may arise between them and civil servants\r\nwho are employed under them.” He is careful to distinguish his own words\r\nfrom the words of the cabinet; careful both to lean upon, and to defer to,\r\nthe judgment of that body; and when the decision is taken, it is in their\r\nname that he writes to the vexatious colleague (July 24, 1872): “The\r\ncabinet have come to their conclusion, and directed me to make it known to\r\nyou.... If you think proper to make the announcement of these intentions\r\nof the government, they are quite willing that you should do so. If\r\notherwise, Mr. Bruce will do it as home minister. Thus far as to making\r\nknown what will be done. As to the doing of it, the rules will have to be\r\ncancelled at once by you.”\r\n\r\nThe reader of an authoritarian or arbitrary cast of mind may ask why he\r\ndid not throw a handful of dust upon the angry combatants. “It is easy,”\r\nhe wrote to Cardwell (Nov. 20, 1871) “to talk of uprooting X., but even if\r\nit were just, it will, as Glyn [the party whip] would tell you, be very\r\ndifficult. But Y. perhaps proceeds more like Moloch, and X. in the manner\r\nof Belial. Why cannot they follow the good example of those worthies, who\r\nco-operated in pandemonium? If you thought you could manage Y., I would\r\ntry to tackle X. I commend this subject to your meditations.” Sulphureous\r\nwhiffs from this pandemonium were pretty copiously scented both by\r\nparliament and the public, and did the ministry some harm.\r\n\r\nOf a peer of much renown in points of procedure, private business, and the\r\nlike, he says, “he looks at everything out of blinkers, and has no side\r\nlights.” Of one brilliant and able colleague in the first administration\r\nhe writes, that “he has some blank in his mental constitution, owing to\r\nwhich he receives admonitions most kindly, and then straightway does the\r\nsame thing over again.” Of another colleague, “though much nearer the\r\nrights of the case than many who were inclined to object, he is thin and\r\npoor in the cabinet.” Some one else is “a sensitive man, given beyond most\r\nmen to speak out his innermost and perhaps unformed thoughts, and thereby\r\nto put himself at a disadvantage.” Another public servant is “not\r\nunmanageable, but he needs to be managed.” In the same letter he speaks of\r\nthe Hibernian presbyterian as “that peculiar cross between a Scotchman and\r\nan Irishman.”\r\n\r\nOf his incessant toil the reader has already a good idea. Here are a few\r\nitems. To one correspondent (Jan. 21, 1869) he writes: “I hope you do not\r\nthink my ‘holiday’ at Hawarden has proved my idleness, for I think ten\r\nhours a day has been a moderate estimate of my work there on public\r\nbusiness, to which some other matters have had to be added.” To the\r\nattorney-general he says when he has had three years more of it (Sept. 18,\r\n1872): “I cannot say with you that my office never gives me a day without\r\nbusiness, for in the four ‘vacations’ so far as they have gone, I think I\r\nhave had no less than five days. This vacation has thus far been the best;\r\nbut heavy and critical work impends.” In October, 1871, he writes to Mrs.\r\nGladstone from Edinburgh: “I have for _the first time_ since the\r\ngovernment was formed, had a holiday of two whole days.” To Lord Clarendon\r\nhe writes from Lord Granville’s at Walmer (Sept. 2, 1869): “At the end of\r\na holiday morning of work, since I breakfasted at nine, which has lasted\r\ntill near four, I have yet to say a few words about....” To Archdeacon\r\nHarrison, May 25, 1873: “As you may like to have the exact anatomy of my\r\nholiday on the Queen’s birthday, I will give it you: 2-1/4 A.M., return\r\nhome from the H. of C. 10 A.M., two hours’ work in my room. 2-7, the\r\ncabinet. Three-quarters of an hour’s walk. 8-12, thirty-two to dinner and\r\nan evening party. 12, bed!” To Sir R. Phillimore, July 23, 1873: “Not once\r\nthis year (except a day in bed) have I been absent from the hours of\r\ngovernment business in the House, and the rigour of attendance is far\r\ngreater now than at earlier periods of the session.”\r\n\r\nHis colleagues grudged his absence for a day. On one occasion, in\r\naccordance with a lifelong passion and rooted habit, he desired to attend\r\na funeral, this time in Scotland, and Lord Granville’s letter of\r\nremonstrance to him is interesting in more points than one; it shows the\r\nexacting position in which the peculiarities of some colleagues and of a\r\ncertain section of his supporters placed him:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is the unanimous desire of the cabinet that I should try to\r\n    dissuade you.... It is a duty of a high order for you to do all\r\n    you can for your health.... You hardly ever are absent from the\r\n    House without some screw getting loose. I should write much more\r\n    strongly if I did not feel I had a personal interest in the\r\n    matter. In so strained a state as Europe is now in, the slightest\r\n    thing may lead to great consequences, and it is possible that it\r\n    may be a disadvantage to me and to the _chose publique_ if\r\n    anything occurs during the thirty-six hours you are absent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter of Lord Granville’s was written on July 10, 1870, just five\r\ndays before war was declared between France and Prussia.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to the _Spectator_ (May 1873) to correct a report “that every day\r\nmust begin for me with my old friend Homer.” He says: “As to my beginning\r\nevery day with Homer, as such a phrase conveys to the world a very untrue\r\nimpression of the demands of my present office, I think it right to\r\nmention that, so far as my memory serves me, I have not read Homer for\r\nfifty lines now for a quarter of an hour consecutively for the last four\r\nyears, and any dealings of mine with Homeric subjects have been confined\r\nto a number of days which could be readily counted on the fingers.” Yet at\r\nthe end of 1869, he winds up a letter of business by saying, “I must\r\nclose; I am going to have a discussion with Huxley on the immortality of\r\nthe soul!”\r\n\r\nWho can wonder that after a prolonged spell of such a strain as this, he\r\nwas found laying down strong doctrine about the age of a prime minister?\r\nBishop Wilberforce met him twice in the May of 1873. “Gladstone much\r\ntalking how little real good work any premier had done after sixty: Peel;\r\nPalmerston, his work really all done before; Duke of Wellington added\r\nnothing to his reputation after. I told him Dr. Clark thought it would be\r\nphysically worse for him to retire. ‘Dr. Clark does not know how\r\ncompletely I should employ myself,’ he replied.” Four days later:\r\n“Gladstone again talking of sixty as full age of premier.”(273)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn words already quoted, Mr. Gladstone spoke of most of his life having\r\nbeen given to working the institutions of his country. Of all these\r\ninstitutions—House of Commons, Lords, cabinet, church, stern courts of\r\nlaw—that which he was most apt to idealise was the throne. His sense of\r\nchivalry and his sense of an august tradition continuously symbolised by a\r\nhistoric throne, moved him as the sight of the French Queen at Versailles\r\nhad moved the majestic political imagination of Burke a century before.\r\nAbout the throne he sometimes used language that represented almost at its\r\nhighest the value set upon it in text-books of the constitution, and in\r\nthe current conventions of ceremonial speech.(274) Although what he called\r\nthe iron necessities of actual business always threw these conventions\r\ninto the background when the time came, yet his inmost feeling about the\r\ncrown and the person of its wearer was as sincere as it was fervid. In\r\nbusiness, it is true, he never yielded, yet even in his most anxious and\r\npressing hours he spared neither time nor toil in endeavours to show the\r\nQueen why he could not yield. “Though decisions,” he said, “must\r\nultimately conform to the sense of those who are to be responsible for\r\nthem, yet their business is to inform and persuade the sovereign, not to\r\noverrule him.” One writer describes the Queen as “superb in standing\r\nsentry over the business of the empire.” This is obsequious phrase-making.\r\nBut I will borrow the figure in saying what is more real, that Mr.\r\nGladstone from beginning to end stood sentry over the interests, whether\r\nprofound and enduring or trivial and fleeting, of the ancient monarchy of\r\nthis kingdom. None who heard it will ever forget the moving and energetic\r\npassage in which when he was the doughty veteran of eighty years, speaking\r\nagainst his own followers on some question of a royal annuity, he moved\r\nthe whole House to its depths by the passionate declaration, “I am not\r\nashamed to say that in my old age I rejoice in any opportunity that\r\nenables me to testify that, whatever may be thought of my opinions,\r\nwhatever may be thought of my proposals in general politics, I do not\r\nforget the service that I have borne to the illustrious representative of\r\nthe British monarchy.”(275)\r\n\r\n(M140) My readers have had opportunity enough of judging Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nestimate of the Queen’s shrewdness, simplicity, high manners. Above all,\r\nhe constantly said how warmly he recognised her sincerity, frankness,\r\nstraight-forwardness, and love of truth. On the other side, his own eager\r\nmobility, versatility, and wide elastic range was not likely to be to the\r\ntaste of a personage with a singular fixity of nature. Then the Queen was\r\nby the necessity of her station a politician, as was Elizabeth or George\r\nIII., although oddly enough she had a bitter dislike of what she thought\r\nthe madness of “women’s rights.” As politician, she often took views that\r\nwere not shared either by the constituencies or by the ministers whom the\r\nconstituencies imposed upon her. The Queen in truth excellently\r\nrepresented and incorporated in her proper person one whole set of those\r\nqualities in our national character, on which the power of her realm had\r\nbeen built up. Mr. Gladstone stood for a different and in some aspects and\r\non some occasions almost an antagonistic set of national qualities. The\r\nQueen, according to those who knew her well,(276) dreaded what in the\r\neighteenth century they called enthusiasm: she dreaded or disdained it in\r\nreligion, and in politics almost more. Yet her Englishmen are full of\r\ncapacity for enthusiasm, and the Scots for whom she had such cordial\r\naffection have enthusiasm in measure fuller still. Unhappily, in the case\r\nof Ireland that occupied so much of Mr. Gladstone’s life, her sympathies\r\nwith his long and vigorous endeavour notoriously stood at zero. The\r\nQueen’s loyalty to the constitution and to ministers in office was\r\nunquestioned, but she was not well placed, nor was she perhaps by\r\ncharacter well fitted, to gauge the fluctuating movements of an age of\r\nchange, as it was the duty of her statesmen to gauge and plumb them. If a\r\ncabinet with the confidence of the House of Commons decides upon a policy,\r\nit must obviously be a premier’s duty to persist, and in that duty Mr.\r\nGladstone was resolute. If he had been otherwise, he knew that he would be\r\nfalling short in loyalty to the country, and to its chief magistrate most\r\nof all.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 a wave of critical feeling began to run upon the throne. An\r\ninfluential journalist of that day, singularly free from any tincture of\r\nrepublican sentiment, thus describes it. “A few weeks ago,” he says, “a\r\ndeep and universal feeling of discontent at the Queen’s seclusion (or\r\nrather at its consequences) found voice in the journals of the country. No\r\npublic print of any importance failed to take part in the chorus; which\r\nwas equally remarkable for its suddenness, fulness, and harmony. Indeed,\r\nthe suddenness of the cry was surprising—till we remembered that what was\r\nthen said had lain unexpressed in the minds of the whole community for\r\nyears, with annual increment; and that when popular feeling gathers in\r\nthat way, it is generally relieved at last by something of the nature of\r\nan explosion.” He then goes on to speak of “republicanism of a very\r\nrevolutionary form flooding in,” and says that such a complexion of\r\naffairs could be viewed with pleasure by no friend of the monarchy.(277)\r\nThe details of this movement are no longer of much interest, and they only\r\nconcern us here because they gave Mr. Gladstone real anxiety. For him it\r\nwas one of the special duties of a prime minister, as distinguished from\r\nhis cabinet, to watch and guard relations between the crown and the\r\ncountry. Whether in office or in opposition, he lost no opportunity of\r\nstanding forth between the throne and even a faint shadow of popular or\r\nparliamentary discontent. He had done it in the case of Prince\r\nAlbert,(278) and he did it now. When the end came after nearly thirty\r\nyears from our present date, the Queen wrote: “I shall ever gratefully\r\nremember his devotion and zeal in all that concerned my personal welfare\r\nand that of my family.” In 1871 his zeal went beyond the Queen’s personal\r\nwelfare, and his solicitude for the institution represented by the Queen\r\nundoubtedly took a form of deferential exhortation—an exhortation that she\r\nshould return to a fuller discharge of public duty, which the Queen found\r\nirksome. The Queen was as fond of Balmoral as Mr. Gladstone was fond of\r\nHawarden. The contrast between the formality of Windsor and the atmosphere\r\nof simple attachment and social affection that surrounded her in Scotland,\r\nwas as delightful to her as the air and the scenery. A royal progress\r\nthrough applauding multitudes in great cities made her ill. Hence, when\r\nMr. Gladstone pressed her to defer a northern journey, or to open\r\nparliament, or to open a bridge, or otherwise emerge from seclusion, the\r\nQueen, though well aware that he had not, and could not, have any motive\r\nsave her own and the public interest, undoubtedly felt that her energetic\r\nminister was attempting to overwork her. This feeling, as most of us know,\r\nbreeds resistance, and even in time resentment. To say, however, that “in\r\nhis eagerness Mr. Gladstone pressed her to do what she knew to be not her\r\nwork so much as his,” is misleading and a little ludicrous.(279) Mr.\r\nGladstone had persuaded himself that in the humour of the day persistence\r\nin seclusion did harm; it was his duty to give advice accordingly, and\r\nthis duty he could not consent to shirk.\r\n\r\nIn other ways his very awe of the institution made him set an exacting\r\nstandard for the individual who represented it. The letters contain a\r\nhundred instances. One may suffice. On the occasion of the Irish Church\r\nbill of 1869, the prime minister sent to the Queen a print of its clauses,\r\nand along with this draft a letter, covering over a dozen closely-written\r\nquarto pages, in explanation. Himself intensely absorbed and his whole\r\nsoul possessed by the vital importance of what he was doing, he could not\r\nconceive that the sovereign, nursing a decided dislike of his policy,\r\nshould not eagerly desire to get to the bottom of the provisions for\r\ncarrying the policy out. The Queen read the letter, and reread it, and\r\nthen in despair desired a gentleman practised in dealing with\r\nparliamentary bills, happening at that time to be at Osborne, to supply\r\nher with a summary.(280) The gaunt virtues of a _précis_—a meagre thing\r\nwhere qualifying sentences drop off, parentheses are cut out, adverbs\r\nhardly count, the noun stands denuded of its sheltering adjective—were\r\nnever congenial to Mr. Gladstone’s copious exactitude in hypothesis,\r\nconditions, and contingencies. Neither of these two illustrious personages\r\nwas without humour, and it seems at once a wonder and a pity that the\r\nmonarch did less than justice to this laborious and almost military sense\r\nof discipline and duty in the minister; while the minister failed in\r\ngenial allowance for the moderation of a royal lady’s appetite for bread\r\nand honey from the draftsman’s kitchen. If failing there were, it was\r\nnatural to a man of earnest and concentrated mind. Be all this as it may,\r\nhe became more and more conscious that the correspondence and occurrences\r\nof 1871-2 had introduced a reserve that was new. Perhaps it recalled to\r\nhim the distance and formality that marked the relations between King\r\nGeorge III. and the proudest, the most intrepid, and the greatest of his\r\nprime ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce in a conversation with Mr. Gladstone I asked him whether he\r\nremembered Peel’s phrase to Cobden about the odious power that patronage\r\nconfers. He replied, “I never felt that, when I was prime minister. It\r\ncame in the day’s work like the rest. I don’t recall that I ever felt\r\nplagued by improper applications. Peel was perhaps a little over fond of\r\ntalking of the sacrifices of office. A man has no business to lay himself\r\nout for being prime minister, or to place himself in the way of it, unless\r\nhe is prepared to take all the incidents of the post whether disagreeable\r\nor not. I’ve no sympathy with talk of that kind.” He was far from the mind\r\nof Carteret. “What is it to me,” cried that glittering minister, “who is a\r\njudge or who is a bishop? It is my business to make kings and emperors,\r\nand to maintain the balance of Europe.”\r\n\r\n(M141) To the bestowal of honours he brought the same diligent care as to\r\nbranches of public business that to men of Peel’s type seemed worthier of\r\ncare. He treated honours on fixed considerations. Especially in the\r\naltitudes of the peerage, he tried hard to find solid political ground to\r\ngo upon. He noted the remarkable fact that though a very large majority of\r\nthe peerages granted since 1835 had been made on the advice of liberal\r\nministers, yet such is the influence of wealth and privileged station that\r\nthe liberal minority in the Lords had decreased. In 1869 the conservative\r\nmajority was between sixty and seventy, without counting bishops or\r\nnominal liberals. Yet household suffrage at this very time had immensely\r\nincreased the moral strength of the House of Commons. The crisis upon the\r\nIrish church had been borne with impatience, and Mr. Gladstone discerned a\r\ncombustible temper at the action of the Lords that might easily have burst\r\ninto flame. Still he saw no signal plan for improving the upper House. The\r\nappointment of life peers might be desirable, he said, but it was not easy\r\nto arrange, nor could its effect be great. The means of action therefore\r\nfor bringing the Lords into more conformity or better proportions to the\r\nCommons, were very moderate. But that made it all the more important that\r\nthey should not be overlooked. The governing idea in respect of both\r\nclasses of hereditary honours was in his judgment the maintenance of a due\r\nrelation between the members in those elevated ranks, and the number of\r\npersons offering the proper conditions for promotion of this kind, in a\r\ncountry so rapidly growing in wealth and population.\r\n\r\nWith characteristic love of making knowledge quantitative—one definition,\r\nI rather think, of science—Mr. Gladstone caused returns to be prepared for\r\nhim, which showed that in 1840 there were about seventeen peers for every\r\nmillion of the population, while in 1869 this number had fallen to\r\nfourteen (in 1880 it was about the same). Lord Palmerston in his second\r\ngovernment appears to have recommended sixteen peerages, and Lord Derby in\r\nlittle more than a quarter of the time recommended fourteen. Mr. Gladstone\r\nhimself, during his first administration, excluding royal, non-political\r\nand _ex-officio_ peerages, added thirty members to the House of Lords,\r\nbesides making five promotions. In the same period twelve peerages became\r\nextinct. Lord Beaconsfield (counting the same exclusions) created between\r\n1874 and 1880 twenty-six new peers, and made nine promotions.(281)\r\n\r\nIn two directions Mr. Gladstone made an honourable innovation. He\r\nrecommended a member of the Jewish faith for a peerage, and in the first\r\nlist of his submissions to the Queen two Roman catholics were included. No\r\ncatholic peer had been created within living memory. One of these two was\r\nLord Acton, afterwards so intimate a friend, whose character, he told the\r\nQueen, “is of the first order, and he is one of the most learned and\r\naccomplished, though one of the most modest and unassuming, men of the\r\nday.” If religious profession was not in his eyes relevant in making\r\npeers, neither was the negation of profession, for at the same time he\r\nproposed a peerage to Grote. “I deeply and gratefully appreciate,” he\r\nwrote to Mr. Gladstone, “the sentiments you are pleased to express\r\nrespecting my character and services. These I shall treasure up never to\r\nbe forgotten, coming as they do from a minister who has entered on the\r\nwork of reform with a sincerity and energy never hitherto paralleled. Such\r\nrecognition is the true and sufficient recompense for all useful labours\r\nof mine.”(282)\r\n\r\nAt the same time the prime minister thought that some honour ought to be\r\ntendered to Mr. Mill, but Lord Granville, whom he consulted, thought\r\notherwise, “merely on the ground that honours should go as much as\r\npossible with general acceptance.” Lord Granville was a man of thoroughly\r\nliberal and even generous mind; still not particularly qualified to be a\r\ngood judge either of the merits of a man like Mill, or of his “acceptance”\r\nin circles well worth considering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was to be expected that preferments in the church should get a special\r\nshare of Mr. Gladstone’s laborious attention, and so they did. As member\r\nfor Oxford he had been so much importuned in Lord Palmerston’s time, that\r\nhe wrote in a moment of unusual impatience (1863), “I think these church\r\npreferments will be the death of me.” Palmerston favoured the\r\nevangelicals, and Mr. Gladstone was mortified that Church did not succeed\r\nStanley in the chair of ecclesiastical history at Oxford, and that\r\nWilberforce was not elevated to the throne of York in 1862.\r\n\r\n(M142) During his first administration he recommended for no fewer than\r\ntwelve bishoprics and eight deaneries. He was not unprepared to find, as\r\nhe put it to Acland, that “saints, theologians, preachers, pastors,\r\nscholars, philosophers, gentlemen, men of business,—these are not to be\r\nhad every day, least of all are they to be commonly found in combination.\r\nBut these are the materials which ought to be sought out, and put forward\r\nin the church of England, if she is to stand the trials, and do her work.”\r\n\r\nAccording to his fashion, he wrote down upon a fragmentary piece of paper\r\nwhat qualifications he ought to look for in a bishop, and this is the\r\nlist:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Piety. Learning (sacred). Eloquence. Administrative power.\r\n    Faithful allegiance to the Church and to the church of England.\r\n    Activity. Tact and courtesy in dealings with men: knowledge of the\r\n    world. Accomplishments and literature. An equitable spirit.\r\n    Faculty of working with his brother bishops. Some legal habit of\r\n    mind. Circumspection. Courage. Maturity of age and character.\r\n    Corporal vigour. Liberal sentiments on public affairs. A\r\n    representative character with reference to shades of opinion\r\n    fairly allowable in the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of his earliest preferments, that of Dr. Temple to the bishopric of\r\nExeter, created lively excitement. He had been a contributor to _Essays\r\nand Reviews_:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    On some of the papers contained in the volume, Mr. Gladstone wrote\r\n    to the Bishop of Lichfield, I look with a strong aversion. But Dr.\r\n    Temple’s responsibility prior to the publication was confined to\r\n    his own essay. The question whether he ought to have disclaimed or\r\n    denounced any part of the volume afterwards is a difficult one,\r\n    and if it was a duty, it was a duty in regard to which a generous\r\n    man might well go wrong. As regards his own essay, I read it at\r\n    the time of publication, and thought it of little value, but did\r\n    not perceive that it was mischievous.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn speaking of him to Acland in 1865, Mr. Gladstone had let fall a truly\r\nremarkable saying, going deep down to the roots of many things:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    You need not assure me of Dr. Temple’s Christian character. I have\r\n    read his sermons, and if I had doubted—but I never did—they would\r\n    have removed the doubt. Indeed I think it a most formidable\r\n    responsibility, at the least, in these times to doubt any man’s\r\n    character on account of his opinions. The limit of possible\r\n    variation between character and opinion, ay, between character and\r\n    belief, is widening, and will widen.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow could the leading mark of progress made in Mr. Gladstone’s age be more\r\ntruly hit, how defined with more pith and pregnancy? How could the\r\nillumination of his own vigorous mind in forty years of life and thought\r\nbe better demonstrated? It would even be no bad thing if those who are\r\nfurthest removed from Mr. Gladstone’s opinions either in religion or\r\npolitics could lay this far-reaching dictum of his to heart. By many men\r\nin all schools his lesson is sorely needed. Shrill was the clamour. Dr.\r\nPusey, in Mr. Gladstone’s own phrase, was “rabid.” He justified his anger\r\nby reputed facts, which proved to be no facts at all, but the anger did\r\nnot die with the fable. Even Phillimore was disquieted. “It has cut very\r\ndeep indeed,” he said. Mr. Gladstone, confident of his ground, was not\r\ndismayed. “The movement against Dr. Temple is like a peculiar cheer we\r\nsometimes hear in the House of Commons, vehement but thin.”\r\n\r\nNo appointment proved so popular and successful as that of Bishop Fraser\r\nto Manchester. He was the first person named by Mr. Gladstone for the\r\nepiscopate without some degree of personal knowledge. A remarkable\r\nconcurrence of testimony established the great breadth of his sympathies,\r\na trait much in his favour for the particular see of Manchester. Yet\r\nstrange to say when by and by Stanley died, Mr. Gladstone was a party to\r\ntrying to remove Fraser from the north to Westminster.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1883 Mr. Gladstone was challenged as confining his recommendations\r\nto the high church side, he defended himself to sufficient purpose. He had\r\na list made out of appointments to bishoprics, deaneries, and the most\r\nimportant parishes:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    There have been thirty important appointments. Out of them I have\r\n    recommended eleven who would probably be called high churchmen\r\n    (not one of them, so far as I know, unsympathetic towards other\r\n    portions of the clergy) and nineteen who are not. On further\r\n    examination it will appear that the high churchmen whom I take to\r\n    be a decided majority of the clergy as well as a decided minority\r\n    of my recommendations, have gone as a rule to the places of hard\r\n    work and little pay. For example, they have got five out of ten\r\n    _parochial_ recommendations; but, out of sixteen appointments to\r\n    deaneries and canonries, they have received four, and those, with\r\n    the exception of Mr. Furse, the worst. I could supply you with the\r\n    lists in detail.\r\n\r\n    One admission I must make; the evidently broad churchmen are too\r\n    large a proportion of the non-high, and the low churchmen rather\r\n    too small, a disproportion which I should hope to remove, but\r\n    undoubtedly the low churchman of the present day has a poorer\r\n    share than half a century ago of the working energy of the church.\r\n\r\n    All these terms, High, Low, and Broad, are rather repugnant to me,\r\n    but I use them as a currency of tokens with which it is difficult\r\n    to dispense.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning from this point of view to the recognition of learning and genius,\r\nin the course of his first administration we find that he made Church dean\r\nof St. Paul’s, and Scott of the Greek lexicon dean of Rochester, Liddon\r\nand Lightfoot canons of St. Paul’s, Kingsley first canon of Chester, and\r\nthen of Westminster, Vaughan master of the Temple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI. Catholic Country And Protestant Parliament. (1873)\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is all very well to establish united education, but if the\r\n    persons to be educated decline to unite, your efforts will be\r\n    thrown away. The question then occurs whether it is best to\r\n    establish a system, rejected by those concerned, in the hope that\r\n    it will gradually work its way into acceptance in spite of the\r\n    intolerance of priests, or to endow the separate denominational\r\n    bodies on the ground that even such education is better than none,\r\n    or, finally, to do nothing. The question is one of statesmanship\r\n    enlightened by a knowledge of facts, and of the sentiments of the\r\n    population.—LESLIE STEPHEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nDescending from her alien throne, the Irish church had now taken her place\r\namong the most prosperous of free communions. To Irish cultivators a\r\ndefinite interest of possession had been indirectly confirmed in the land\r\nto which most of its value had been given by their own toil. A third\r\nbranch of the upas tree of poisonous ascendency described by Mr. Gladstone\r\nduring the election of 1868, still awaited his axe. The fitness of an\r\nabsentee parliament to govern Ireland was again to be tested. This time\r\nthe problem was hardest of all, for it involved direct concession by\r\nnations inveterately protestant, to a catholic hierarchy having at its\r\nhead an ultramontane cardinal of uncompromising opinions and inexorable\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nEverybody knew that the state of university education in Ireland stood in\r\nthe front rank of unsettled questions. Ever since the establishment of\r\nthree provincial colleges by Peel’s government in 1845, the flame of the\r\ncontroversy had been alight. Even on the very night when Graham introduced\r\nthe bill creating them, no less staunch a tory and protestant than Sir\r\nRobert Inglis had jumped up and denounced “a gigantic scheme of godless\r\neducation.” The catholics loudly echoed this protestant phrase. The three\r\ncolleges were speedily condemned by the pope as fatal to faith and morals,\r\nand were formally denounced by the synod of Thurles in 1850. The\r\nfulminations of the church did not extinguish these modest centres of\r\nlight and knowledge, but they cast a creeping blight upon them. In 1865 a\r\ndemand was openly made in parliament for the incorporation by charter of a\r\nspecifically catholic university. Mr. Gladstone, along with Sir George\r\nGrey, then admitted the reality of a grievance, namely, the absence in\r\nIreland of institutions of which the catholics of the country were able to\r\navail themselves. Declining, for good reasons or bad, to use opportunities\r\nof college education by the side of protestants, and not warmed by the\r\natmosphere and symbols of their own church and faith, catholics contended\r\nthat they could not be said to enjoy equal advantages with their\r\nfellow-citizens of other creeds. They repudiated a system of education\r\nrepugnant to their religious convictions, and in the persistent efforts to\r\nforce ’godless education’ on their country, they professed to recognise\r\nanother phase of persecution for conscience’ sake.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, Lord Russell’s government tried its hand with a device known as\r\nthe supplemental charter. It opened a way to a degree without passing\r\nthrough the godless colleges. This was set aside by an injunction from the\r\ncourts, and it would not have touched the real matter of complaint, even\r\nif the courts had let it stand. Next year the tories burnt their fingers,\r\nthough Mr. Disraeli told parliament that he saw no scars. For a time, he\r\nbelieved that an honourable and satisfactory settlement was possible, and\r\nnegotiations went on with the hierarchy. The prelates did not urge\r\nendowment, Mr. Disraeli afterwards said, but “they mentioned it.” The\r\ncountry shrank back from concurrent endowment, though, as Mr. Disraeli\r\ntruly said, it was the policy of Pitt, of Grey, of Russell, of Peel, and\r\nof Palmerston. Ever since 1794, catholic students had been allowed to\r\ngraduate at Trinity College, and ever since the disestablishment of the\r\nIrish church in 1869, Trinity had asked parliament for power to admit\r\ncatholics to her fellowships and emoluments. This, however, did not go to\r\nthe root, whether we regard it as sound or unsound, of the catholic\r\ngrievance, which was in fact their lack of an endowed institution as\r\ndistinctively catholic in all respects as Trinity was protestant.\r\n\r\nSuch was the case with which Mr. Gladstone was called upon to grapple, and\r\na delicate if not even a desperate case it was. The prelates knew what\r\nthey wished, though they lay in shadow. What they wanted a protestant\r\nparliament, with its grip upon the purse, was determined that they should\r\nnot have. The same conclusion as came to many liberals by prejudice, was\r\nreached by the academic school on principle. On principle they held\r\ndenominational endowment of education to be retrograde and obscurantist.\r\nThen there was the discouraging consideration of which Lord Halifax\r\nreminded Mr. Gladstone. “You say with truth,” he observed when the\r\nsituation had developed, “that the liberal party are behaving very ill,\r\nand so they are. But liberal majorities when large are apt to run riot. No\r\nmen could have stronger claims on the allegiance of their party than Lord\r\nGrey and Lord Althorp after carrying the Reform bill. Nevertheless, the\r\nlarge majority after the election of 1832-3 was continually putting the\r\ngovernment into difficulty.” So it befell now, and now as then the\r\ndifficulty was Irish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M143) Well knowing the hard work before him, Mr. Gladstone applied\r\nhimself with his usual indomitable energy to the task. “We go to Oxford\r\nto-morrow,” he writes to Lord Granville (Nov. 12), “to visit Edward Talbot\r\nand his wife; forward to London on Thursday, when I dine with the\r\nTemplars. My idea of work is that the first solid and heavy bit should be\r\nthe Irish university—some of this may require to be done in cabinet. When\r\nwe have got that into shape, I should be for taking to the yet stiffer\r\nwork of local taxation—most of the cabinet take a personal interest in\r\nthis. I think it will require immeasurable talking over, which might be\r\ndone chiefly in an open informal cabinet, before any binding resolutions\r\nare taken. But I propose to let Palmer have his say (general) about law\r\nreform on Friday.” At Oxford he saw Dr. Pusey, “who behaved with all his\r\nold kindness, and seemed to have forgotten the Temple(283) business, or\r\nrather as if it had never been.” On November 20, he records, “Cabinet\r\n2-3/4-6-½. Some heads of a measure on Irish university education.” No\r\ncommunications were opened with the Irish bishops beforehand, probably\r\nfrom a surmise that they would be bound to ask more than they could\r\nobtain.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 16, 1873, Hawarden._—Dr. Ingram [the distinguished fellow of\r\n    Trinity College] came in afternoon, and I was able to spend\r\n    several hours with him on the university question. 17.—Many hours\r\n    with Dr. Ingram on the bill and scheme; in truth, almost from\r\n    breakfast to dinner.

I spoke three hours in\r\n    introducing the Irish university bill with much detailed\r\n    explanation. (_Diary._)\r\n\r\n\r\nPhillimore has an interesting note or two on his friend at this critical\r\ntime:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 2._—Gladstone looking well, but much aged. Spoke of anxiety\r\n    to retire when he could do so with honour, said he had _forced_\r\n    himself into the study of the whole question relating to Trinity\r\n    College, Dublin, and that he was sure that his enemies did not\r\n    understand the very curious facts relative to the university. It\r\n    seemed as if he meant to frame the government measure on a\r\n    historical and antiquarian basis. This will not satisfy the\r\n    country if the practical result is to place more power in the\r\n    hands of the papists. 10.—Gladstone looked very worn and anxious.\r\n    Spoke about the relief he should experience after Thursday, the\r\n    weight of the matter which he had to deal with, and the general\r\n    misapprehension which prevailed; thought the tide was turning in\r\n    their favour. 11.—Gladstone in high spirits, confident of success\r\n    on Thursday. 14.—Dined at Gladstone’s. Our host in high spirits at\r\n    his achievement of yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe leading provisions of the measure, though found by the able and expert\r\ndraftsman unusually hard to frame, may be very shortly stated, for the\r\nquestion by the way is still in full blast. A new university of Dublin was\r\nto rise, a teaching as well as an examining body, governed by a council\r\nwho were to appoint officers and regulate all matters and things affecting\r\nthe university. The constitution of this governing council was elaborately\r\ndevised, and it did not make clerical predominance ultimately impossible.\r\nThe affiliation of colleges, not excluding purely denominational\r\ninstitutions, was in their hands. There were to be no religious tests for\r\neither teachers or taught, and religious profession was to be no bar to\r\nhonours and emoluments. Money was provided by Trinity College, the\r\nconsolidated fund, and the church surplus, to the tune of £50,000 a year.\r\nThe principle was the old formula of mixed or united education, in which\r\nprotestants and catholics might side by side participate.\r\n\r\n(M144) What many found intolerably obnoxious were two “gagging clauses.”\r\nBy one of these a teacher or other person of authority might be suspended\r\nor deprived, who should in speaking or writing be held to have wilfully\r\ngiven offence to the religious convictions of any member. The second and\r\ngraver of them was the prohibition of any university teacher in theology,\r\nmodern history, or moral and mental philosophy. The separate affiliated\r\ncolleges might make whatever arrangements they pleased for these subjects,\r\nbut the new university would not teach them directly and authoritatively.\r\nThis was undoubtedly a singular limitation for a university that had sent\r\nforth Berkeley and Burke; nor was there ever a moment when in spite of the\r\nspecialisation of research, the deepest questions in the domain of thought\r\nand belief more inevitably thrust themselves forward within common and\r\nindivisible precincts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 14, Mr. Gladstone reported to the Queen:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The general impression last night appeared to be that the friends\r\n    of Trinity College were relieved; that the liberal party and the\r\n    nonconformists were well satisfied with the conformity between the\r\n    proposed measure and the accepted principles of university\r\n    organisation in England; but that the Roman catholics would think\r\n    themselves hardly or at least not generously used. All that Mr.\r\n    Gladstone has heard this morning through private channels, as well\r\n    as the general tone of the press, tends to corroborate the\r\n    favourable parts of what he gathered last night, and to give hope\r\n    that reasonable and moderate Roman catholics may see that their\r\n    real grievances will be removed; generally also to support the\r\n    expectation that the bill is not likely to pass.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelane of the _Times_ said to Manning when they were leaving the House of\r\nCommons, “This is a bill made to pass.” Manning himself heartily\r\nacquiesced. Even the bitterest of Mr. Gladstone’s critics below the\r\ngangway on his own side agreed, that if a division could have been taken\r\nwhile the House was still under the influence of the three hours’ speech,\r\nthe bill would have been almost unanimously carried.(284) “It threw the\r\nHouse into a mesmeric trance,” said the seconder of a hostile motion.\r\nEffects like these, not purple passages, not epigrams nor aphorisms, are\r\nthe test of oratory. Mr. Bruce wrote home (Feb. 15): “Alas! I fear all\r\nprospect of ministerial defeat is over. The University bill is so well\r\nreceived that people say there will not be even a division on the second\r\nreading. I see no other rock ahead, but sometimes they project their\r\nsnouts unexpectedly, and cause shipwreck.”\r\n\r\nSoon did the projecting rocks appear out of the smooth water. Lord Spencer\r\nhad an interview with Cardinal Cullen at Dublin Castle (Feb. 25), and\r\nfound him though in very good humour and full of gratitude for fair\r\nintentions, yet extremely hostile to the bill. It was in flat opposition,\r\nhe said, to what the Roman catholics had been working for in Ireland for\r\nyears; it continued the Queen’s Colleges, and set up another Queen’s\r\nCollege in the shape of Trinity College with a large endowment; it\r\nperpetuated the mixed system of education, to which he had always been\r\nopposed, and no endowment nor assistance was given to the catholic\r\nuniversity; the council might appoint professors to teach English\r\nliterature, geology, or zoology who would be dangerous men in catholic\r\neyes. Lord Spencer gathered that the cardinal would be satisfied with a\r\nsum down to redress inequality or a grant for buildings.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Manning wrote to Cardinal Cullen the day after the bill was\r\nproduced, “strongly urging them to accept it.” It seemed to him to rest on\r\na base so broad that he could not tell how either the opposition or the\r\nradical doctrinaires could attack it without adopting “the German\r\ntyranny.” He admitted that he was more easily satisfied than if he were in\r\nIreland, but he thought the measure framed with skill and success. After a\r\nfortnight the archbishop told Mr. Gladstone, that he still saw reason to\r\nbelieve that the Irish hierarchy would not refuse the bill. On March 3rd,\r\nhe says he has done his utmost to conciliate confidence in it. By the 7th\r\nhe knew that his efforts had failed, but he urges Mr. Gladstone not to\r\ntake the episcopal opposition too much to heart. “Non-endowment, mixed\r\neducation, and godless colleges, are three bitter things to them.” “This,”\r\nhe wrote to Mr. Gladstone, when all was over (March 12) “is not your\r\nfault, nor the bill’s fault, but the fault of England and Scotland and\r\nthree anti-catholic centuries.”\r\n\r\n(M145) The debate began on March 3rd, and extended to four sittings. The\r\nhumour of the House was described by Mr. Gladstone as “fitful and\r\nfluctuating.” Speeches “void of real argument or point, yet aroused the\r\nmere prejudices of a section of the liberal party against popery and did\r\nmuch to place the bill in danger.” Then that cause of apprehension\r\ndisappeared, and a new change passed over the shifting sky, for the\r\nintentions of Irish members were reported to be dubious. There was not a\r\nlittle heat and passion, mainly from below the ministerial gangway. The\r\ngagging clauses jarred horribly, though they were trenchantly defended by\r\nMr. Lowe, the very man to whose line of knowledge and intellectual freedom\r\nthey seemed likely to be most repugnant. It soon appeared that neither\r\nprotestant nor catholic set any value on these securities for conscience,\r\nand the general assembly of the presbyterians declared war upon the whole\r\nscheme. The cabinet—“most harmonious at this critical time,”—still held\r\nfirmly that the bill was well constructed, so that if it once reached\r\ncommittee it would not be easy to inflict mortal wounds. On March 8th the\r\nprime minister reported to the Queen:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Strange to say, it is the opposition of the Roman catholic bishops\r\n    that brings about the present difficulty; and this although they\r\n    have not declared an opposition to the bill outright, but have\r\n    wound up their list of objections with a resolution to present\r\n    petitions praying for its amendment. Still their attitude of what\r\n    may be called growling hostility has had these important results.\r\n    Firstly, it has deadened that general willingness of the liberal\r\n    party, which the measure itself had created, to look favourably on\r\n    a plan such as they might hope would obtain acquiescence, and\r\n    bring about contentment. Secondly, the great majority of the\r\n    bishops are even more hostile than the resolutions, which were\r\n    apparently somewhat softened as the price of unanimity; and all\r\n    _these_ bishops, working upon liberal Irish members through their\r\n    political interest in their seats, have proceeded so far that from\r\n    twenty to twenty-five may go against the bill, and as many may\r\n    stay away. When to these are added the small knot of discontented\r\n    liberals and mere fanatics which so large a party commonly\r\n    contains, the government majority, now taken at only 85,\r\n    disappears....\r\n\r\n    It is not in the power or the will of your Majesty’s advisers to\r\n    purchase Irish support by subserviency to the Roman bishops. Their\r\n    purpose has been to offer justice to all, and their hope has been\r\n    that what was just would be seen to be advantageous. As far as the\r\n    Roman catholics of Ireland are concerned, the cabinet conceive\r\n    that they are now at perfect liberty to throw up the bill. But\r\n    they are also of opinion that its abandonment would so impair or\r\n    destroy their moral power, as to render it impossible for them to\r\n    accept the defeat. There are whispers of a desire in the liberal\r\n    party, should the catastrophe arrive, to meet it by a vote of\r\n    confidence, which would probably be carried by a still larger\r\n    majority. But the cabinet look with extreme disfavour upon this\r\n    method of proceeding, which would offer them the verbal promise of\r\n    support just when its substance had been denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to more purely personal aspects and contingencies:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    What lies beyond it would be premature to describe as having been\r\n    regularly treated or even opened to-day. Mr. Gladstone considers\r\n    himself far more tied to the bill and the subject than his\r\n    colleagues; and if they upon a defeat were disposed to carry on\r\n    the government without him, he would with your Majesty’s sanction\r\n    take effectual means to provide at least against his being an\r\n    impediment in the way of an arrangement eligible in so many points\r\n    of view. But his colleagues appear at present indisposed to adopt\r\n    this method of solution. There would then remain for them the\r\n    question whether they should humbly tender their resignations to\r\n    your Majesty, or whether they should advise a dissolution of the\r\n    parliament, which was elected under other auspices. This would be\r\n    a matter of the utmost gravity for consideration at the proper\r\n    time. Mr. Gladstone as at present advised has no foregone\r\n    conclusion in favour of either alternative, and would act with his\r\n    colleagues as between them. But he does not intend to go into\r\n    opposition, and the dissolution of this government, brought about\r\n    through languor and through extensive or important defections in\r\n    the liberal party which has made him its leader, would be the\r\n    close of his political life. He has now for more than forty years\r\n    striven to serve the crown and country to the best of his power,\r\n    and he is willing, though with overtaxed faculties and diminishing\r\n    strength, to continue the effort longer, if he sees that the\r\n    continuance can be conducive to the objects which he has\r\n    heretofore had at heart; but the contingency to which he has last\r\n    referred, would be for him the proof that confidence was gone,\r\n    that usefulness was at an end, and that he might and ought to\r\n    claim the freedom which best befits the close of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, in reporting that the estimates of the coming division were\r\nfar from improving, Mr. Gladstone returned in a few words to the personal\r\npoint:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gladstone is very grateful for your Majesty’s caution against\r\n    being swayed by private feelings, and he will endeavour to be on\r\n    his guard against them. He has, however, always looked to the\r\n    completion of that commission, so to call it, which events in a\r\n    measure threw into his hands five years ago, as the natural close\r\n    of the main work of the present government; and many circumstances\r\n    have combined to impress him with the hope that thus an honourable\r\n    path would be opened for his retirement. He ought, perhaps, to add\r\n    that he has the strongest opinion, upon political grounds and\r\n    grounds other than political, against spending old age under the\r\n    strain of that perpetual contention which is inseparable from his\r\n    present position; and this opinion could only be neutralised by\r\n    his perceiving a special call to remain: that is to say, some\r\n    course of public service to be done by him better than if it were\r\n    in other hands. Such a prospect he neither sees nor anticipates.\r\n    But it is premature to trouble your Majesty on this minor subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 9th Cardinal Cullen blazed forth in a pastoral that was read in all\r\nthe churches. He described the bill as richly endowing non-catholic and\r\ngodless colleges, and without giving one farthing to catholics, inviting\r\nthem to compete in their poverty, produced by penal laws and\r\nconfiscations, with those left in possession of enormous wealth. The new\r\nuniversity scheme only increased the number of Queen’s Colleges, so often\r\nand so solemnly condemned by the catholic church and by all Ireland, and\r\ngave a new impulse to that sort of teaching that separates education from\r\nreligion and its holy influences, and banishes God, the author of all\r\ngood, from our schools. The prelate’s pastoral had a decisive effect in\r\nregions far removed from the ambit of his crosier. The tory leader could\r\nnot resist a temptation thus offered by the attitude of the Irish\r\ncardinal, and the measure that had been much reviled as a dark concordat\r\nbetween Mr. Gladstone and the pope, was now rejected by a concordat\r\nbetween the pope’s men and Mr. Disraeli.\r\n\r\nThe discussion was on a high level in Mr. Gladstone’s judgment. Lyon\r\nPlayfair criticised details with some severity and much ability, but\r\nintended to vote for the bill. Miall, the nonconformist leader, supported\r\nthe second reading, but required alterations that were admissible enough.\r\nOn March 10 Mr. Harcourt, who was not yet an old member, “opened the\r\ndiscussion by a speech in advance of any he has yet delivered as to effect\r\nupon the House. Severe in criticism on detail, he was favourable to the\r\nsubstance of the bill.” One significant incident of the debate was a\r\ndeclaration by Bentinck, a conservative ultra, that he would vote against\r\nthe bill in reliance on the declaration of Mr. Hardy, which he understood\r\nto be a pledge for himself and others near him, not to take office during\r\nthe existence of the present parliament. “Mr. Hardy remained silent during\r\nthis appeal, which was several times repeated.” Then the end came (March\r\n11-12):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Disraeli rose at half-past ten, and spoke amidst rapt\r\n    attention till midnight. Mr. Gladstone followed in a speech of two\r\n    hours, and at two o’clock the division was called. During the\r\n    whole evening the greatest uncertainty had prevailed; for himself\r\n    Mr. Gladstone leaned to expecting an unfavourable result. The\r\n    numbers were, Ayes (for the government), 284; Noes, 287; majority\r\n    against the government, 3. It is said that 45 adherents of the\r\n    government, or thereabouts, voted against them. It was the Irish\r\n    vote that grew continually worse.(285)\r\n\r\n\r\n(M146) Of the speech in which the debate was wound up Forster says in his\r\ndiary: “Gladstone, with the House dead against him and his bill, made a\r\nwonderful speech—easy, almost playful, with passages of great power and\r\neloquence, but with a graceful play, which enabled him to plant deep his\r\ndaggers of satire in Horsman and Co.”(286) Speaker Brand calls it “a\r\nmagnificent speech, generous, high-minded, and without a taint of\r\nbitterness, although he was sorely tried, especially by false friends.” He\r\nvindicated the obnoxious clauses, but did not wish to adhere to them if\r\nopinion from all quarters were adverse, and he admitted that it was the\r\nopposition of members from Ireland that principally acted on his hearers.\r\nHis speech contained a remarkable passage, pronouncing definitely against\r\ndenominational endowment of university education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII. The Crisis. (1873)\r\n\r\n\r\n    .. alla fortuna, come vuol, son presto..\r\n    Pero giri fortuna la sua rota,\r\n    Come le piace, e il villan la sua marra.\r\n                     —_Inferno_, xv. 93.\r\n\r\n    For fortune as she wills I am ready.. so\r\n    let her turn her wheel as she may please,\r\n    and the churl his spade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nA week of lively and eventful interests followed,—not only interesting in\r\nthe life of Mr. Gladstone, but raising points with important\r\nconstitutional bearings, and showing a match between two unsurpassed\r\nmasters of political sword-play. The story was told generally and\r\npartially in parliament, but the reader who is curious about either the\r\nepisode itself, or Mr. Gladstone’s modes of mind and action, will find it\r\nworth a little trouble to follow details with some closeness.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _March 11._—H. of C. Spoke 12-2, and voted in a division of\r\n    284-287—which was believed to cause more surprise to the opposite\r\n    side than it did to me. At 2.45 A.M. I apprised the Queen of our\r\n    defeat.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, March 12._—Saw the Queen at 12.15. Failed to find\r\n    Granville. Cabinet 1-2-3/4. We discussed the matter with a general\r\n    tendency to resignation rather than dissolving. Confab. on my\r\n    position with Granville and Glyn, then joined by Bright. To the\r\n    Queen again at six to keep her informed. Large dinner party for\r\n    the Duke of Edinburgh, and an evening party afterwards, to hear\r\n    Joachim.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, March 13._—After seeing Mr. Glyn and Lord F. Cavendish, I\r\n    went at 10.40 to see Dr. Clark. He completed his examination, and\r\n    gave me his careful judgment. I went to Lord Granville, sketched\r\n    out to him and Glyn my views, and went to the cabinet at 12.15.\r\n    Stated the case between the two alternatives of resignation and\r\n    dissolution as far as regarded myself. On the side of resignation\r\n    it would not be necessary to make any final announcement [of his\r\n    retirement from the leadership]. I am strongly advised a temporary\r\n    rest. On the other hand, if we now dissolve, I anticipate that\r\n    _afterwards_ before any long time difficulties will arise, and my\r\n    mission will be terminated. So that the alternatives are not so\r\n    unequally weighed. The cabinet without any marked difference, or\r\n    at least without any positive assertion to the contrary,\r\n    determined on tendering their resignations.(287) After cabinet saw\r\n    Hartington and others respecting honours. At 2.45 saw the Queen\r\n    and resigned. The Queen informed me that she would send for Mr.\r\n    Disraeli; suggested for consideration whether I would include the\r\n    mention of this fact in my announcement to parliament, and added\r\n    as I was leaving the room, without looking (apparently) for an\r\n    answer, that she would inform me of what might take place. At 3.45\r\n    saw Granville respecting the announcements. Made announcement in\r\n    House of Commons at 4.30. More business at Downing Street, and\r\n    home at six.\r\n\r\n    At a quarter to seven, or a little later, Colonel Ponsonby called\r\n    with a communication from her Majesty. “Any news?” I said. “A\r\n    great deal,” he replied; and informed me as follows. Mr. Disraeli\r\n    had been with the Queen; did not see the means of carrying on the\r\n    government by the agency of his party under present circumstances;\r\n    did not ask for the dissolution of parliament (this was understood\r\n    to mean did not offer to become minister on condition of being\r\n    permitted to dissolve); did not say that his renunciation of the\r\n    task was final; recommended that the Queen should call for my\r\n    advice. Upon this the Queen sent Colonel Ponsonby, and he said,\r\n    “She considers this as sending for you anew.” I replied that I did\r\n    not regard the Queen’s reference of this intelligence to me, as\r\n    her calling upon me anew to undertake the work of government; that\r\n    none of my obligations to the sovereign were cancelled or impaired\r\n    by the resignation tendered and accepted; that I was still the\r\n    minister for the purpose of rendering any service she might be\r\n    pleased to call for in the matter on which she is engaged, exactly\r\n    as before, until she has a new minister, when my official\r\n    obligations will come to an end. That I felt there was great\r\n    inconvenience and danger of misapprehension out of doors in\r\n    proceeding over-rapidly with a matter of such gravity, and that\r\n    each step in it required to be well measured and ascertained\r\n    before proceeding to consider of the next following step. That I\r\n    had great difficulty in gathering any precise idea of Mr.\r\n    Disraeli’s account of what he could not do, and what he either\r\n    could or did not say that he could not. That as this account was\r\n    to present to me the state of facts on which I was commanded to\r\n    advise, it was quite necessary for me to have an accurate idea of\r\n    it, in order that I might do justice to her Majesty’s commands. I\r\n    would therefore humbly suggest that Mr. Disraeli might with great\r\n    propriety be requested to put his reply into writing. That I\r\n    presumed I might receive this reply, if it were her Majesty’s\r\n    pleasure to make it known to me, at some not late hour to-morrow,\r\n    when I would at once place myself in a condition to tender my\r\n    humble advice. This is an account of what Colonel Ponsonby might\r\n    fairly consider as my answer to her Majesty’s communication. I\r\n    enlarged the conversation, however, by observing that the division\r\n    which overthrew us was a party division. It bore the express\r\n    authentic symbol of its character in having party tellers on the\r\n    opposition as well as on the government side; that we were aware\r\n    of the great, even more than ordinary, efforts of Colonel Taylor,\r\n    with Mr. Disraeli’s countenance, to bring members to London and to\r\n    the House; that all this seemed to impose great obligations on the\r\n    opposition; and if so, that it would be the duty of the leader of\r\n    the opposition to use every exertion of consultation with his\r\n    friends and otherwise before declining the task, or in any manner\r\n    advising the Queen to look elsewhere. To Colonel Ponsonby indeed,\r\n    I observed that I thought Mr. Disraeli was endeavouring, by at\r\n    once throwing back on me an offer which it was impossible for me\r\n    at the time and under the circumstances to accept, to get up a\r\n    case of absolute necessity founded upon this refusal of mine, and\r\n    thus, becoming the indispensable man and party, to have in his\r\n    hands a lever wherewith to overcome the reluctance and resistance\r\n    of his friends, who would not be able to deny that the Queen must\r\n    have a government.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M147) Mr. Disraeli’s reply to the Queen’s inquiry whether he was prepared\r\nto form a government, was put into writing, and the two operative\r\nparagraphs of it were sent through Colonel Ponsonby to Mr. Gladstone. They\r\nran as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    In answer, Mr. Disraeli said he was prepared to form an\r\n    administration which he believed would carry on her Majesty’s\r\n    affairs with efficiency, and would possess her confidence; but he\r\n    could not undertake to carry on her Majesty’s government in the\r\n    present House of Commons. Subsequently, her Majesty having\r\n    remarked that Mr. Gladstone was not inclined to recommend a\r\n    dissolution of parliament, Mr. Disraeli stated that he himself\r\n    would not advise her Majesty to take that step.\r\n\r\n\r\nViewing these paragraphs as forming the answer offered by Mr. Disraeli to\r\nthe Queen, Mr. Gladstone reported to her (March 14) that “he did not find\r\nhimself able to gather their precise effect”:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The former of the two, if it stood alone, would seem to imply that\r\n    Mr. Disraeli was prepared to accept office with a view to an\r\n    immediate dissolution of parliament, but not otherwise; since it\r\n    states that he believes himself able to form a suitable\r\n    administration, but not “to carry on your Majesty’s government in\r\n    the present House of Commons.” In the latter of the two paragraphs\r\n    Mr. Disraeli has supposed your Majesty to have remarked that “Mr.\r\n    Gladstone was not inclined to recommend a dissolution of\r\n    parliament,” and has stated that “he himself would not advise your\r\n    Majesty to take that step.” Your Majesty will without doubt\r\n    remember that Mr. Gladstone tendered no advice on the subject of\r\n    dissolution generally, but limited himself to comparing it with\r\n    the alternative of resignation, which was the only question at\r\n    issue, and stated that on the part of the cabinet he humbly\r\n    submitted resignation of their offices, which they deemed to be\r\n    the step most conformable to their duty. Mr. Gladstone does not\r\n    clearly comprehend the bearing of Mr. Disraeli’s closing words; as\r\n    he could not tender advice to your Majesty either affirmatively or\r\n    negatively on dissolution, without first becoming your Majesty’s\r\n    adviser. Founding himself upon the memorandum, Mr. Gladstone is\r\n    unable to say to what extent the apparent meaning of the one\r\n    paragraph is modified or altered by the other; and he is obliged\r\n    to trouble your Majesty, however reluctantly, with this\r\n    representation, inasmuch as a perfectly clear idea of the tenor of\r\n    the reply is a necessary preliminary to his offering any remark or\r\n    advice upon it; which, had it been a simple negative, he would\r\n    have felt it his duty to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween six and seven in the evening Colonel Ponsonby came with a letter\r\nfrom the Queen to the effect that Mr. Disraeli had unconditionally\r\ndeclined to undertake the formation of a government. In obedience to the\r\nQueen’s commands Mr. Gladstone proceeded to give his view of the position\r\nin which her Majesty was placed:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _March 15._—Not being aware that there can be a question of any\r\n    intermediate party or combination of parties which would be\r\n    available at the present juncture, he presumes that your Majesty,\r\n    if denied the assistance of the conservative or opposition party,\r\n    might be disposed to recur to the services of a liberal\r\n    government. He is of opinion, however, that either his late\r\n    colleagues, or any statesman or statesmen of the liberal party on\r\n    whom your Majesty might call, would with propriety at once observe\r\n    that it is still for the consideration of your Majesty whether the\r\n    proceeding which has taken place between your Majesty and Mr.\r\n    Disraeli can as yet be regarded as complete. The vote of the House\r\n    of Commons on Wednesday morning was due to the deliberate and\r\n    concerted action of the opposition, with a limited amount of\r\n    adventitious numerical aid. The division was a party division, and\r\n    carried the well-known symbol of such divisions in the appointment\r\n    of tellers of the opposition and government respectively. The vote\r\n    was given in the full knowledge, avowed in the speech of the\r\n    leader of the opposition, that the government had formally\r\n    declared the measure on which the vote was impending to be vital\r\n    to its existence. Mr. Gladstone humbly conceives that, according\r\n    to the well-known principles of our parliamentary government, an\r\n    opposition which has in this manner and degree contributed to\r\n    bring about what we term a crisis, is bound to use and to show\r\n    that it has used its utmost efforts of counsel and inquiry to\r\n    exhaust all practicable means of bringing its resources to the aid\r\n    of the country in its exigency. He is aware that his opinion on\r\n    such a subject can only be of slight value, but the same\r\n    observation will not hold good with regard to the force of a\r\n    well-established party usage. To show what that usage has been,\r\n    Mr. Gladstone is obliged to trouble your Majesty with the\r\n    following recital of facts from the history of the last half\r\n    century.... [_This apt and cogent recital the reader will find at\r\n    the end of the volume, see _Appendix_._]... There is, therefore, a\r\n    very wide difference between the manner in which the call of your\r\n    Majesty has been met on this occasion by the leader of the\r\n    opposition, and the manner which has been observed at every former\r\n    juncture, including even those when the share taken by the\r\n    opposition in bringing about the exigency was comparatively slight\r\n    or none at all. It is, in Mr. Gladstone’s view, of the utmost\r\n    importance to the public welfare that the nation should be\r\n    constantly aware that the parliamentary action certain or likely\r\n    to take effect in the overthrow of a government; the reception and\r\n    treatment of a summons from your Majesty to meet the necessity\r\n    which such action has powerfully aided in creating; and again the\r\n    resumption of office by those who have deliberately laid it\r\n    down,—are uniformly viewed as matters of the utmost gravity,\r\n    requiring time, counsel, and deliberation among those who are\r\n    parties to them, and attended with serious responsibilities. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone will not and does not suppose that the efforts of the\r\n    opposition to defeat the government on Wednesday morning were made\r\n    with a previously formed intention on their part to refuse any aid\r\n    to your Majesty, if the need should arise, in providing for the\r\n    government of the country; and the summary refusal, which is the\r\n    only fact before him, he takes to be not in full correspondence\r\n    either with the exigencies of the case, or as he has shown, with\r\n    the parliamentary usage. In humbly submitting this representation\r\n    to your Majesty, Mr. Gladstone’s wish is to point out the\r\n    difficulty in which he would find himself placed were he to ask\r\n    your Majesty for authority to inquire from his late colleagues\r\n    whether they or any of them were prepared, if your Majesty should\r\n    call on them, to resume their offices; for they would certainly,\r\n    he is persuaded, call on him, for their own honour, and in order\r\n    to the usefulness of their further service if it should be\r\n    rendered, to prove to them that according to usage every means had\r\n    been exhausted on the part of the opposition for providing for the\r\n    government of the country, or at least that nothing more was to be\r\n    expected from that quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis statement, prepared after dinner, Mr. Gladstone took to Lord\r\nGranville that night (March 14). The next morning he again saw Lord\r\nGranville and Colonel Ponsonby, and despatched his statement to the Queen.\r\n“At 2.45,” he writes to Granville:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I saw the Queen, not for any distinct object, but partly to fill\r\n    the blank before the public. H.M. was in perfect humour. She will\r\n    use the whole or part of my long letter by sending it to Disraeli.\r\n    She seemed quite to understand our point of view, and told me\r\n    plainly what shows that the artful man _did_ say, if it came back\r\n    to him again at this juncture, he would not be bound by his\r\n    present refusal. I said, “But, ma’am, that is not before me.” “But\r\n    he told it to me,” she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M148) The Queen sent Mr. Gladstone’s long letter to Mr. Disraeli, and he\r\nreplied in a tolerably long letter of his own. He considered Mr.\r\nGladstone’s observations under two heads: first, as an impeachment of the\r\nopposition for contributing to the vote against the bill, when they were\r\nnot prepared to take office; second, as a charge against Mr. Disraeli\r\nhimself that he summarily refused to take office without exhausting all\r\npracticable means of aiding the country in the exigency. On the first\r\narticle of charge, he described the doctrine advanced by Mr. Gladstone as\r\nbeing “undoubtedly sound so far as this: that for an opposition to use its\r\nstrength for the express purpose of throwing out a government which it is\r\nat the time aware that it cannot replace—having that object in view and no\r\nother—would be an act of recklessness and faction that could not be too\r\nstrongly condemned.” But this, he contended, could not be imputed to the\r\nconservative opposition of 1873. The Irish bill was from the first\r\nstrongly objected to by a large section of the liberal party, and on the\r\nsame grounds that led the conservative opposition to reject it, namely,\r\nthat it sacrificed Irish education to the Roman catholic hierarchy. The\r\nparty whom the bill was intended to propitiate rejected it as inadequate.\r\nIf the sense of the House had been taken, irrespective of considerations\r\nof the political result of the division, not one-fourth of the House would\r\nhave voted for it. Mr. Gladstone’s doctrine, Disraeli went on, amounted to\r\nthis, that “whenever a minister is so situated that it is in his power to\r\nprevent any other parliamentary leader from forming an administration\r\nlikely to stand, he acquires thereby the right to call on parliament to\r\npass whatever measures he and his colleagues think fit, and is entitled to\r\ndenounce as factious the resistance to such measures. Any such claim is\r\none not warranted by usage, or reconcilable with the freedom of the\r\nlegislature. It comes to this: that he tells the House of Commons, ‘Unless\r\nyou are prepared to put some one in my place, your duty is to do whatever\r\nI bid you.’ To no House of Commons has language of this kind ever been\r\naddressed; by no House of Commons would it be tolerated.”\r\n\r\nAs for the charge of summary refusal to undertake government, Mr. Disraeli\r\ncontented himself with a brief statement of facts. He had consulted his\r\nfriends, and they were all of opinion that it would be prejudicial to the\r\npublic interests for a conservative ministry to attempt to conduct\r\nbusiness in the present House of Commons. What other means were at his\r\ndisposal? Was he to open negotiations with a section of the late ministry,\r\nand waste days in barren interviews, vain applications, and the device of\r\nimpossible combinations? Was he to make overtures to the considerable\r\nsection of the liberal party that had voted against the government? The\r\nIrish Roman catholic gentlemen? Surely Mr. Gladstone was not serious in\r\nsuch a suggestion. The charge of deliberate and concerted action against\r\nthe Irish bill was ’not entirely divested of some degree of exaggeration.’\r\nHis party was not even formally summoned to vote against the government\r\nmeasure, but to support an amendment which was seconded from the liberal\r\nbenches, and which could only by a violent abuse of terms be described as\r\na party move.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday afternoon Mr. Gladstone had gone down to Cliveden, and there\r\nat ten o’clock on the Sunday evening (March 16) he received a message from\r\nthe Queen, enclosing Mr. Disraeli’s letter, and requesting him to say\r\nwhether he would resume office. This letter was taken by Mr. Gladstone to\r\nshow that “nothing more was to be expected in that quarter,” and at eleven\r\no’clock he sent off the messenger with his answer in the affirmative:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _March 16, 1873_, 10-3/4 P.M.—It is quite unnecessary for him to\r\n    comment upon any of the statements or arguments advanced by Mr.\r\n    Disraeli, as the point referred by your Majesty for him to\r\n    consider is not their accuracy, sufficiency, or relevancy, but\r\n    simply whether any further effort is to be expected from the\r\n    opposition towards meeting the present necessity. Your Majesty has\r\n    evidently judged that nothing more of this kind can be looked for.\r\n    Your Majesty’s judgment would have been conclusive with Mr.\r\n    Gladstone in the case, even had he failed to appreciate the full\r\n    cogency of the reason for it; but he is bound to state that he\r\n    respectfully concurs with your Majesty upon that simple question,\r\n    as one not of right but of fact. He therefore does not hesitate at\r\n    once to answer your Majesty’s gracious inquiry by saying that he\r\n    will now endeavour to prevail upon your Majesty’s late advisers\r\n    generally to resume their offices, and he again places all such\r\n    service as it is in his power to offer, at your Majesty’s\r\n    disposal. According to your Majesty’s command, then, he will\r\n    repair to London to-morrow morning, and will see some of the most\r\n    experienced members of the late government to review the position\r\n    which he regards as having been seriously unhinged by the shock of\r\n    last Wednesday morning; to such an extent indeed, that he doubts\r\n    whether either the administration or parliament can again be what\r\n    they were. The relations between them, and the course of business\r\n    laid down in the royal speech, will require to be reconsidered, or\r\n    at least reviewed with care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, March 18._—[_To the Queen_] The cabinet met informally\r\n    at this house [11 Carlton House Terrace] at 2 P.M., and sat till\r\n    5-½.\r\n\r\n    The whole of the cabinet were ready to resume their offices. It\r\n    was decided to carry on the government in the present parliament,\r\n    without contemplating any particular limit of time for existence\r\n    in connection with the recent vote.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, March 19._—Went down to Windsor at midday; 3/4 hour\r\n    with the Queen on the resignation, the statement tomorrow, the\r\n    Duke of Edinburgh’s marriage, royal precedence, Tennyson’s honour;\r\n    also she mentioned railway accidents and an assault on a soldier,\r\n    and on luxury in food and dress. Dined with the Duke of Cambridge.\r\n    Speaker’s levee, saw Mr. Fawcett [who had been active in fomenting\r\n    hostility] and other members. Then Mrs. Glyn’s party.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, March 20._—H. of C. Made my explanation. Advisedly let\r\n    pass Mr. Disraeli’s speech without notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone said among other things:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I felt reluctance personally from a desire for rest, the title to\r\n    which had possibly been ... earned by labour. Also politically,\r\n    because I do not think that as a general rule the experience we\r\n    have had in former years of what may be called returning or\r\n    resuming governments, has been very favourable in its\r\n    character.... The subsequent fortunes of such governments lead to\r\n    the belief that upon the whole, though such a return may be the\r\n    lesser of two evils, yet it is not a thing in itself to be\r\n    desired. It reminds me of that which was described by the Roman\r\n    general according to the noble ode of Horace:—\r\n\r\n        ... Neque amissos colores\r\n      Lana refert medicata fuco,\r\n    Nec vera virtus cum semel excidit\r\n    Curat reponi deterioribus.(288)\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Disraeli made a lengthy statement, covering a much wider field. The\r\nsubstance of the whole case after all was this. The minister could not\r\ndissolve for the reason that the defeat had strengthened all the forces\r\nagainst the bill and against the government, and the constituencies who\r\nhad never looked on it with much favour after its rejection by the Irish\r\nto satisfy whom it had been invented, now regarded it with energetic\r\ndisfavour. The leader of the opposition, on the other hand, produced a\r\nlong string of ingenious reasons for not abiding by the result of what was\r\nhis own act: as, for example, that dissolution could not be instant; to\r\nform a government would take time; financial business must be arranged; a\r\npolicy could not be shaped without access to official information; in this\r\ninterval motions would be made and carried on plausible questions, and\r\nwhen the election came, his friends would go to the country as discredited\r\nministers, instead of being a triumphant opposition. In writing to his\r\nbrother Robertson, Mr. Gladstone glances at other reasons:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _March 21._—We have gone through our crisis; and I fear that\r\n    nobody is much the better for it. For us it was absolutely\r\n    necessary to show that we did not consider return, as we had not\r\n    considered resignation, a light matter. As to the opposition, the\r\n    speech of Disraeli last night leaves it to be asked why did he not\r\n    come in, wind up the business of the session, and dissolve? There\r\n    is no reason to be given, except that a portion of his party was\r\n    determined not to be educated again, and was certain that if he\r\n    got in he would again commence this educating process. The\r\n    conservative party will never assume its natural position until\r\n    Disraeli retires; and I sometimes think he and I might with\r\n    advantage pair off together.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker Brand says: “Disraeli’s tactics are to watch and wait, not showing\r\nhis hand nor declaring a policy; he desires to drive Gladstone to a\r\ndissolution, when he will make the most of Gladstone’s mistakes, while he\r\nwill denounce a policy of destruction and confiscation, and take care to\r\nannounce no policy of his own. His weakness consists in the want of\r\nconfidence of some of his party.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII. Last Days Of The Ministry. (1873)\r\n\r\n\r\n    ὤσπερ ἂν εἴ τις ναύκληρον πάντ᾽ ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ πράξαντα, καὶ\r\n    κατασκευάσαντα τὸ πλοῖον ἀφ᾽ ὧν ὑπελάμβανε σωθήσεσθαι, εἶτα\r\n    χειμῶνι χρησάμενον καὶ πονησάντων αὐτῷ τῶν σκευῶν ἤ καὶ\r\n    συντριβέτων ὅλως, τῆς ναυαγίας αἰτιῷτο.—DEMOSTHENES.\r\n\r\n    As if, when a shipmaster had done all he could for safety, and\r\n    fitted his vessel with everything to make her weathertight, then\r\n    when he meets a storm and all his tackle strains and labours until\r\n    it is torn to pieces, we should blame him for the wreck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shock of defeat, resignation, and restoration had no effect in\r\nlessening ministerial difficulties. The months that followed make an\r\nunedifying close to five glorious years of progress and reform. With\r\nplenty of differences they recall the sunless days in which the second\r\nadministration of the younger Pitt ended that lofty career of genius and\r\ndominion. The party was divided, and some among its leaders were centres\r\nof petty disturbance. In a scrap dated at this period Mr. Gladstone wrote:\r\n“Divisions in the liberal party are to be seriously apprehended from a\r\nfactious spirit on questions of economy, on questions of education in\r\nrelation to religion, on further parliamentary change, on the land laws.\r\nOn these questions generally my sympathies are with what may be termed the\r\nadvanced party, whom on other and general grounds I certainly will never\r\nhead nor lead.”\r\n\r\nThe quarrel between the government and the nonconformists was not\r\nmitigated by a speech of Mr. Gladstone’s against a motion for the\r\ndisestablishment of the church. It was described by Speaker Brand as “firm\r\nand good,” but the dissenters, with all their kindness for the prime\r\nminister, thought it firm and bad.(289) To Dr. Allon, one of the most\r\nrespected of their leaders, Mr. Gladstone wrote (July 5):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The spirit of frankness in which you write is ever acceptable to\r\n    me. I fear there may be much in your sombre anticipations. But if\r\n    there is to be a great schism in the liberal party, I hope I shall\r\n    never find it my duty to conduct the operations either of the one\r\n    or of the other section. The nonconformists have shown me great\r\n    kindness and indulgence; they have hitherto interpreted my acts\r\n    and words in the most favourable sense; and if the time has come\r\n    when my acts and words pass beyond the measure of their patience,\r\n    I contemplate with repugnance, at my time of life especially, the\r\n    idea of entering into conflict with them. A political severance,\r\n    somewhat resembling in this a change in religion, should at most\r\n    occur not more than once in life. At the same time I must observe\r\n    that no one has yet to my knowledge pointed out the expressions or\r\n    arguments in the speech, that can justly give offence.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few personal jottings will be found of interest:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 7, 1873._—H. of C. The budget and its reception mark a real\r\n    onward step in the session. 23.—Breakfast with Mr. C. Field to\r\n    meet Mr. Emerson. 30.—I went to see the remains of my dear friend\r\n    James Hope. Many sad memories but more joyful hopes. _May 15._—The\r\n    King and Queen of the Belgians came to breakfast at ten. A party\r\n    of twenty. They were most kind, and all went well.\r\n\r\n    _To the Queen_ (May 19).—Mr. Gladstone had an interview yesterday\r\n    at Chiselhurst with the Empress. He thought her Majesty much\r\n    thinner and more worn than last year, but she showed no want of\r\n    energy in conversation. Her Majesty felt much interest, and a\r\n    little anxiety, about the coming examination of the prince her son\r\n    at Woolwich.\r\n\r\n    _June 8._—Chapel royal at noon. It was touching to see Dean Hook\r\n    and hear him, now old in years and very old I fear in life; but he\r\n    kindled gallantly. 17.—Had a long conversation with Mr. Holloway\r\n    (of the pills) on his philanthropic plans; which are of great\r\n    interest. 25.—Audience of the Shah with Lord Granville and the\r\n    Duke of Argyll. Came away after 1-1/4 hours. He displayed abundant\r\n    acuteness. His gesticulation particularly expressive. 26.—Sixteen\r\n    to breakfast. Mme. Norman Neruda played for us. She is also most\r\n    pleasing in manner and character. Went to Windsor afterwards. Had\r\n    an audience. _July 1._—H. of C. Received the Shah soon after six.\r\n    A division on a trifling matter of adjournment took place during\r\n    his Majesty’s presence, in which he manifested an intelligent\r\n    interest. The circumstance of his presence at the time is singular\r\n    in this view (and of this he was informed, rather to his\r\n    amusement) that until the division was over he could not be\r\n    released from the walls of the House. It is probably, or possibly,\r\n    the first time for more than five hundred years that a foreign\r\n    sovereign has been under personal restraint of any kind in\r\n    England. [_Query, Mary Queen of Scots._]\r\n\r\n\r\n(M149) Then we come upon an entry that records one of the deepest griefs\r\nof this stage of Mr. Gladstone’s life—the sudden death of Bishop\r\nWilberforce:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 19._—Off at 4.25 to Holmbury.(290) We were enjoying that\r\n    beautiful spot and expecting Granville with the Bishop of\r\n    Winchester, when the groom arrived with the message that the\r\n    Bishop had had a bad fall. An hour and a half later Granville\r\n    entered, pale and sad: “It’s all over.” In an instant the thread\r\n    of that very precious life was snapped. We were all in deep and\r\n    silent grief. 20.—Woke with a sad sense of a great void in the\r\n    world. 21.—Drove in the morning with Lord Granville to Abinger\r\n    Hall. Saw _him_, for the last time in the flesh, resting from his\r\n    labours. Attended the inquest; inspected the spot; all this cannot\r\n    be forgotten. 23.—Gave way under great heat, hard work, and\r\n    perhaps depression of force. Kept my bed all day.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Of the special opinions of this great prelate,” he wrote to the Queen,\r\n“Mr. Gladstone may not be an impartial judge, but he believes there can be\r\nno doubt that there does not live the man in any of the three kingdoms of\r\nyour Majesty who has, by his own indefatigable and unmeasured labours,\r\ngiven such a powerful impulse as the Bishop of Winchester gave to the\r\nreligious life of the country.” When he mentioned that the bishop’s family\r\ndeclined the proposal of Westminster Abbey for his last resting place, the\r\nQueen replied that she was very glad, for “to her nothing more gloomy and\r\ndoleful exists.”\r\n\r\n“Few men,” Mr. Gladstone wrote later in this very year, “have had a more\r\nvaried experience of personal friendships than myself. Among the large\r\nnumbers of estimable and remarkable people whom I have known, and who have\r\nnow passed away, there is in my memory an inner circle, and within it are\r\nthe forms of those who were marked off from the comparative crowd even of\r\nthe estimable and remarkable, by the peculiarity and privilege of their\r\ntype.”(291) In this inner circle the bishop must have held a place, not\r\nmerely by habit of life, which accounts for so many friendships in the\r\nworld, but by fellowship in their deepest interests, by common ideals in\r\nchurch and state, by common sympathy in their arduous aim to reconcile\r\ngreetings in the market-place and occupation of high seats, with the\r\nspiritual glow of the soul within its own sanctuary.\r\n\r\n(M150) While still grieving over this painful loss, Mr. Gladstone suddenly\r\nfound himself in a cauldron of ministerial embarrassments. An inquiry into\r\ncertain irregularities at the general post office led to the discovery\r\nthat the sum of eight hundred thousand pounds had been detained on its way\r\nto the exchequer, and applied to the service of the telegraphs. The\r\npersons concerned in the gross and inexcused irregularities were Mr.\r\nMonsell, Mr. Ayrton, and the chancellor of the exchequer. “There probably\r\nhave been times,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to the Queen (Aug. 7), “when the\r\nthree gentlemen who in their several positions have been chiefly to blame\r\nwould have been summarily dismissed from your Majesty’s service. But on\r\nnone of them could any ill-intent be charged; two of them had, among\r\nwhatever errors of judgment, done much and marked good service to the\r\nstate.” Under the circumstances he could not resort to so severe a course\r\nwithout injustice and harshness. “The recent exposures,” Mr. Gladstone\r\nwrote to Lord Russell, “have been gall and wormwood to me from day to\r\nday.” “Ever since the failure of the Irish University bill,” he said, “the\r\ngovernment has been in a condition in which, to say the least, it has had\r\nno strength to spare, and has stood in need of all the strength it could\r\nderive from internal harmony and vigorous administration.” The post office\r\nscandal exposed to the broad light of day that neither harmony nor vigour\r\nexisted or could be counted on. It was evident that neither the postmaster\r\nnor the chancellor of the exchequer could remain where they were. In\r\nsubmitting new arrangements to the Queen, Mr. Gladstone said that he would\r\ngladly have spared her the irksome duty of considering them, had it been\r\n“in his power either on the one side to leave unnoticed the scandals that\r\nhave occurred, or on the other to have tendered a general resignation, or\r\nto have advised a dissolution of parliament.” The hot weather and the\r\nlateness of the session made the House of Commons disinclined for serious\r\nconflict; still at the end of July various proceedings upon the scandals\r\ntook place, which. Mr. Gladstone described to the Queen as of “a truly\r\nmortifying character.” Mr. Ayrton advanced doctrines of ministerial\r\nresponsibility that could not for a moment be maintained, and Mr.\r\nGladstone felt himself bound on the instant to disavow them.(292)\r\n\r\nSir Robert Phillimore gives a glimpse of him in these evil days:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 24._—Gladstone dined here hastily; very unwell, and much\r\n    worn. He talked about little else than Bishop Wilberforce’s\r\n    funeral and the ecclesiastical appeals in the Judicature bill.\r\n    29th.—Saw Gladstone, better but pale. Said the government deserved\r\n    a vote of censure on Monsell and Lowe’s account. Monsell ought to\r\n    resign; but Lowe, he said, ought for past services to be defended.\r\n    30th..—Dined at Gladstone’s. Radical M.P.’s ... agreed that\r\n    government was tottering, and that Gladstone did everything.\r\n    Gladstone walks with a stick. _Aug. 7._—An interview with\r\n    Gladstone. He was communicative. A great reform of his government\r\n    has become necessary. The treasury to be swept out. He looked much\r\n    better.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing at any time was so painful, almost intolerably painful, to Mr.\r\nGladstone as personal questions, and cabinet reconstruction is made up of\r\npersonal questions of the most trying and invidious kind. “I have had a\r\nfearful week,” he wrote to the Duke of Argyll (Aug. 8), “but have come\r\nthrough. A few behave oddly, most perfectly well, some incomparably well;\r\nof these last I must name _honoris causâ_, Bright, Bruce, and F.\r\nCavendish.” To Mr. Bright he had written when the crisis first grew\r\nacute:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 2._—You have seen the reports, without doubt, of what has\r\n    been going on. You can hardly conceive the reality. I apprehend\r\n    that the House of Commons by its abstinence and forbearance, must\r\n    be understood to have given us breathing time and space to\r\n    consider what can be done to renovate the government in something\r\n    like harmony and something like dignity. This will depend greatly\r\n    upon men and partly upon measures. Changes in men there must be,\r\n    and some without delay. A lingering and discreditable death, after\r\n    the life we have lived, is not an ending to which we ought to\r\n    submit without effort; and as an essential part of the best effort\r\n    that can be made, I am most desirous to communicate with you here.\r\n    I rely on your kindness to come up. Here only can I show you the\r\n    state of affairs, which is most dangerous, and yet not unhopeful.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the diary:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 1._—Saw Lord F. Cavendish, also Lord Granville, Lord\r\n    Wolverton, Mr. Cardwell, repeatedly on the crisis. 2.—An anxious\r\n    day. The first step was taken, Cardwell broke to Lowe the\r\n    necessity of his changing his office. Also I spoke to Forster and\r\n    Fortescue. 4.—A very anxious day of constant conversation and\r\n    reflection, ending with an evening conclave. 5.—My day began with\r\n    Dr. Clark. Rose at eleven.... Wrote.... Most of these carried much\r\n    powder and shot. Some were Jack Ketch and Calcraft [the public\r\n    executioner] letters. 6.—Incessant interviews.... Much anxiety\r\n    respecting the Queen’s delay in replying. Saw Lord Wolverton late\r\n    with her reply. 9.—To Osborne. A long and satisfactory audience of\r\n    H.M. Attended the council, and received a third time the seals of\r\n    my old office.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis resumption of the seals of the exchequer, which could no longer be\r\nleft with Mr. Lowe, was forced upon Mr. Gladstone by his colleagues. From\r\na fragmentary note, he seems to have thought of Mr. Goschen for the vacant\r\npost, “but deferring to the wishes of others,” he says, “I reluctantly\r\nconsented to become chancellor of the exchequer.” The latest instance of a\r\ncombination of this office with that of first lord of the treasury were\r\nCanning in 1827, and Peel in 1884-5.(293)\r\n\r\nThe correspondence on this mass of distractions is formidable, but,\r\nluckily for us it is now mere burnt-out cinder. The two protagonists of\r\ndiscord had been Mr. Lowe and Mr. Ayrton, and we may as well leave them\r\nwith a few sentences of Mr. Gladstone upon the one, and to the other:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ayrton, he says, has caused Mr. Gladstone so much care and\r\n    labour on many occasions, that if he had the same task to\r\n    encounter in the case of a few other members of the cabinet, his\r\n    office would become intolerable. But before a public servant of\r\n    this class can properly be dismissed, there must be not only a\r\n    sufficient case against him, but a case of which the sufficiency\r\n    can be made intelligible and palpable to the world. Some of his\r\n    faults are very serious, yet he is as towards the nation an\r\n    upright, assiduous, and able functionary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Lowe, who had become home secretary, he writes (Aug. 13):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I do not know whether the word “timid” was the right one for L——,\r\n    but, at any rate, I will give you proof that I am not “timid”;\r\n    though a coward in many respects I may be. I always hold that\r\n    politicians are the men whom, as a rule, it is most difficult to\r\n    comprehend, _i.e._ understand completely; and for my own part, I\r\n    never have thus understood, or thought I understood, above one or\r\n    two, though here and there I may get hold of an isolated idea\r\n    about others. Such an idea comes to me about you. I think the\r\n    clearness, power, and promptitude of your intellect are in one\r\n    respect a difficulty and a danger to you. You see everything in a\r\n    burning, almost a scorching light. The case reminds me of an\r\n    incident some years back. Sir D. Brewster asked me to sit for my\r\n    photograph in a black frost and a half mist in Edinburgh. I\r\n    objected about the light. He said, This is the best light; it is\r\n    all diffused, not concentrated. Is not your light too much\r\n    concentrated? Does not its intensity darken the surroundings? By\r\n    the surroundings, I mean the relations of the thing not only to\r\n    other things but to persons, as our profession obliges us\r\n    constantly to deal with persons. In every question flesh and blood\r\n    are strong and real even if extraneous elements, and we cannot\r\n    safely omit them from our thoughts.\r\n\r\n    Now, after all this impudence, let me try and do you a little more\r\n    justice. You have held for a long time the most important office\r\n    of the state. No man can do his duty in that office and be popular\r\n    _while_ he holds it. I could easily name the two worst chancellors\r\n    of the exchequer of the last forty years; against neither of them\r\n    did I ever hear a word while they were in (I might almost add, nor\r\n    for them after they were out). “Blessed are ye, when men shall\r\n    revile you.” You have fought for the public, tooth and nail. You\r\n    have been under a storm of unpopularity; but not a fiercer one\r\n    than I had to stand in 1860, when hardly any one dared to say a\r\n    word for me; but certainly it was one of my best years of service,\r\n    even though bad be the best. Of course, I do not say that this\r\n    necessity of being unpopular should induce us to raise our\r\n    unpopularity to the highest point. No doubt, both in policy and in\r\n    Christian charity, it should make us very studious to mitigate and\r\n    abate the causes as much as we can. This is easier for you than it\r\n    was for me, as your temper is good, and mine not good.\r\n\r\n    While I am fault-finding, let me do a little more, and take\r\n    another scrap of paper for the purpose. (I took only a scrap\r\n    before, as I was determined, then, not to “afflict you above\r\n    measure.”) I note, then, two things about you. Outstripping others\r\n    in the race, you reach the goal or conclusion before them; and,\r\n    being there, you assume that they are there also. This is\r\n    unpopular. You are unpopular this very day with a poor wretch,\r\n    whom you have apprised that he has lost his seat, and you have not\r\n    told him _how_. Again, and lastly, I think you do not get up all\r\n    things, but allow yourself a choice, as if politics were a\r\n    flower-garden and we might choose among the beds; as Lord\r\n    Palmerston did, who read foreign office and war papers, and let\r\n    the others rust and rot. This, I think, is partially true, I do\r\n    not say of your reading, but of your mental processes. You will, I\r\n    am sure, forgive the levity and officiousness of this letter for\r\n    the sake of its intention and will believe me always and sincerely\r\n    yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen at last he escaped from Downing Street to Hawarden:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 11._—Off at 8.50 with a more buoyant spirit and greater\r\n    sense of relief than I have experienced for many years on this,\r\n    the only pleasant act of moving to me in the circuit of the year.\r\n    This gush is in proportion to the measure of the late troubles and\r\n    anxieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader will perhaps not thank me for devoting even a short page or two\r\nto a matter that made much clatter of tongue and pen in its day. The\r\npoints are technical, minute, and to be forgotten as quickly as possible.\r\nBut the thing was an episode, though a trivial one enough, in Mr.\r\nGladstone’s public life, and paltry use was made of it in the way of\r\ngroundless innuendo. Being first lord of the treasury, he took besides the\r\noffice of chancellor of the exchequer. Was this a fresh acceptance of a\r\nplace of profit under the crown? Did he thereby come within the famous\r\nstatute of Anne and vacate his seat? Or was he protected by a provision in\r\nthe Act of 1867, to the effect that if any member had been duly re-elected\r\nsince his acceptance of any office referred to in the Act of Anne, he\r\nshould be free to accept any other such office without further\r\nre-election? Mr. Gladstone had been re-elected after being first lord of\r\nthe treasury; was he free to accept the office of chancellor of the\r\nexchequer in addition, without again submitting himself to his\r\nconstituents? The policy and object of the provision were obvious and they\r\nwere notorious. Unluckily, for good reasons not at all affecting this\r\nobject, Mr. Disraeli inserted certain words, the right construction of\r\nwhich in our present case became the subject of keen and copious\r\ncontention. The section that had been unmistakable before, now ran that a\r\nmember holding an office of profit should not vacate his seat by his\r\nsubsequent acceptance of any other office “_in lieu of and in immediate\r\nsuccession_ the one to the other.”(294) Not a word was said in the debate\r\non the clause as to the accumulation of offices, and nobody doubted that\r\nthe intention of parliament was simply to repeal the Act of Anne, in\r\nrespect of change of office by existing ministers. Was Mr. Gladstone’s a\r\ncase protected by this section? Was the Act of 1867, which had been passed\r\nto limit the earlier statute, still to be construed in these circumstances\r\nas extending it?\r\n\r\nUnsuspected hares were started in every direction. What is a first lord of\r\nthe treasury? Is there such an office? Had it ever been named (up to that\r\ntime) in a statute? Is the chancellor of the exchequer, besides being\r\nsomething more, also a commissioner of the treasury? If he is, and if the\r\nfirst lord is only the same, and if there is no legal difference between\r\nthe lords of the treasury, does the assumption of the two parts by one\r\nminister constitute a case of immediate succession by one commissioner to\r\nanother, or is the minister in Mr. Gladstone’s circumstances an\r\nindivisible personality as commissioner discharging two sets of duties?\r\nThen the precedents. Perceval was chancellor of the exchequer in 1809,\r\nwhen he accepted in addition the office of first lord with an increased\r\nsalary, and yet he was held not to have vacated his seat.(295) Lord North\r\nin 1770, then chancellor of the exchequer, was appointed first lord on the\r\nresignation of the Duke of Grafton, and he at the same time retained his\r\npost of chancellor; yet no writ was ordered, and no re-election took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nInto this discussion we need not travel. What concerns us here is Mr.\r\nGladstone’s own share in the transaction. The plain story of what proved a\r\ncomplex affair, Mr. Gladstone recounted to the Speaker on August 16, in\r\nlanguage that shows how direct and concise he could be when handling\r\npractical business:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I had already sent you a preliminary intimation on the subject of\r\n    my seat for Greenwich, before I received your letter of the 14th.\r\n    I will now give you a more complete account of what has taken\r\n    place. Knowing only that the law had been altered with the view of\r\n    enabling the ministers to change offices without re-election, and\r\n    that the combination of my two offices was a proper and common\r\n    one, we had made no inquiry into the point of law, nor imagined\r\n    there was any at the time when, deferring to the wish of others, I\r\n    reluctantly consented to become C. of E. On Saturday last (Aug. 9)\r\n    when I was at Osborne, the question was opened to me. I must\r\n    qualify what I have stated by saying that on Friday afternoon some\r\n    one had started the question fully into view; and it had been, on\r\n    a summary survey, put aside. On Monday I saw Mr. Lambert, who I\r\n    found had looked into it; we talked of it fully; and he undertook\r\n    to get the materials of a case together. The Act throws the\r\n    initiative upon me; but as the matter seemed open to discussion, I\r\n    felt that I must obtain the best assistance, viz., that of the law\r\n    officers. I advisedly abstained from troubling or consulting Sir\r\n    E. May, because you might have a subsequent and separate part to\r\n    take, and might wish to refer to him. Also the blundering in the\r\n    newspapers showed that the question abounded in nice matter, and\r\n    would be all the better understood from a careful examination of\r\n    precedents. The law officers were out of town; but the\r\n    solicitor-general [Jessel] was to come up in the later part of the\r\n    week. It was not possible in so limited a time to get a case into\r\n    perfect order; still I thought that, as the _adverse_ argument lay\r\n    on the surface, I had better have him consulted. I have had no\r\n    direct communication with him. But Mr. Lambert with his usual\r\n    energy put together the principal materials, and I jotted down all\r\n    that occurred to me. Yesterday Mr. Lambert and my private\r\n    secretary, Mr. Gurdon, who, as well as the solicitor to the\r\n    treasury, had given attention to the subject, brought the matter\r\n    fully before the solicitor-general. He has found himself able to\r\n    write a full opinion on the questions submitted to him: 1. My\r\n    office as C. of E. is an office of profit. 2. My commissionership\r\n    of the treasury under the new patent in preparation is an “other\r\n    office” under the meaning of the late Act. 3. I cannot be advised\r\n    to certify to you any avoidance of the seat. Had the opinion of\r\n    Sir G. Jessel been adverse, I should at once have ceased to urge\r\n    the argument on the Act, strong as it appears to me to be; but in\r\n    point of form I should have done what I now propose to do, viz.,\r\n    to have the case made as complete as possible, and to obtain the\r\n    joint opinion of the law officers. Perhaps that of the chancellor\r\n    should be added. Here ends my narrative, which is given only for\r\n    your information, and to show that I have not been negligent in\r\n    this matter, the Act requiring me to proceed “forthwith.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker Brand replied (Aug. 18) that, while speaking with reserve on the\r\nmain point at issue, he had no hesitation in saying that he thought Mr.\r\nGladstone was taking the proper course in securing the best legal advice\r\nin the matter. And he did not know what more could be done under present\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n(M151) The question put to Jessel was “Whether Mr. Gladstone, having\r\naccepted the office of chancellor of the exchequer is not, under the\r\ncircumstances stated, protected by the provision contained in section 52\r\nof the Representation of the People Act, 1867, from vacating his seat?”\r\nJessel answered “I am of opinion that he is so protected.” “I may be\r\nwrong,” this strong lawyer once said, “and sometimes am; but I have never\r\nany doubts.” His reasons on this occasion were as trenchant as his\r\nconclusion. Next came Coleridge, the attorney-general. He wrote to Mr.\r\nGladstone on Sept. 1, 1873:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have now gone carefully through the papers as to your seat, and\r\n    looked at the precedents, and though I admit that the case is a\r\n    curious one, and the words of the statute not happily chosen, yet\r\n    _I have come clearly and without doubt to the same conclusion as\r\n    Jessel_, and I shall be quite prepared if need be to argue the\r\n    case in that sense in parliament. Still it may be very proper, as\r\n    you yourself suggest, that you should have a written and formal\r\n    opinion of the law officers and Bowen upon it.(296)\r\n\r\n\r\nSelborne volunteered the opposite view (Aug. 21), and did not see how it\r\ncould be contended that Mr. Gladstone, being still a commissioner of the\r\ntreasury under the then existing commission, took the office of the\r\nchancellor (with increase of pay) in lieu of, and in immediate succession\r\nto, the other office which he still continued to hold. A day or two later,\r\nSelborne, however, sent to Mr. Gladstone a letter addressed to himself by\r\nBaron Bramwell. In this letter that most capable judge and strong-headed\r\nman, said: “As a different opinion is I know entertained, I can’t help\r\nsaying that I think it clear Mr. Gladstone has not vacated his seat. His\r\ncase is within neither the spirit nor the letter of the statute.” He then\r\nputs his view in the plain English of which he was a master. The lord\r\nadvocate (now Lord Young) went with the chancellor and against the English\r\nlaw officers. Lowe at first thought that the seat was not vacated, and\r\nthen he thought that it was. “Sir Erskine May,” says Mr. Gladstone (Feb.\r\n2, 1874), “has given a strong opinion that my seat is full.” Well might\r\nthe minister say that he thought “the trial of this case would fairly take\r\nas long as Tichborne.” On September 21, the chancellor, while still\r\nholding to his own opinion, wrote to Mr. Gladstone:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    You have followed the right course (especially in a question which\r\n    directly concerns the House of Commons) in obtaining the opinion\r\n    of the law officers of the crown.... But having taken this proper\r\n    course, and being disposed yourself to agree to the conclusions of\r\n    your official advisers, you are clearly free from all personal\r\n    fault, if you decide to act upon those conclusions and leave the\r\n    House, when it meets, to deal with them in way either of assent or\r\n    dissent, as it may think fit.\r\n\r\n\r\nColeridge and Jessel went on to the bench, and Sir Henry James and Sir\r\nWilliam Harcourt were brought up from below the gangway to be attorney and\r\nsolicitor. In November the new law officers were requested to try their\r\nhands. Taking the brilliant and subtle Charles Bowen into company, they\r\nconsidered the case, but did not venture (Dec. 1) beyond the singularly\r\nshy proposition that strong arguments might be used both in favour of and\r\nagainst the view that the seat was vacated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the _Times_ had raised the question immediately (Aug. 11),\r\nthough not in adverse language. The unslumbering instinct of party had\r\nquickly got upon a scent, and two keen-nosed sleuth hounds of the\r\nopposition four or five weeks after Mr. Gladstone had taken the seals of\r\nthe exchequer, sent to the Speaker a certificate in the usual form (Sept.\r\n17) stating the vacancy at Greenwich, and requesting him to issue a writ\r\nfor a new election. The Speaker reminded them in reply, that the law\r\ngoverning the issue of writs during the recess in cases of acceptance of\r\noffice, required notification to him from the member accepting; and he had\r\nreceived no such notification.(297) Everybody knew that in case of an\r\nelection, Mr. Gladstone’s seat was not safe, though when the time came he\r\nwas in fact elected. The final state and the outlook could not be better\r\ndescribed than in a letter from Lord Halifax to Mr. Gladstone (Dec. 9):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lord Halifax to Mr. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 9, 1873._—On thinking over the case as to your seat, I\r\n    really think it is simple enough. I will put my ideas shortly for\r\n    your benefit, or you may burn them. You did not believe that you\r\n    had vacated your seat on accepting the office of chancellor of the\r\n    exchequer, and you did not send notice to the Speaker as required\r\n    by the Act of 1858. Were you right? The solicitor-general said\r\n    that you were, in a deliberate opinion. The attorney-general\r\n    concurred. The present law officers consider it so very doubtful\r\n    that they will not give an opinion. The Speaker either from not\r\n    having your notice, or having doubts, has not ordered a new writ.\r\n    These are the facts. What should you do? _Up to the meeting_ of\r\n    parliament you clearly must act as if there was no doubt. If you\r\n    do not, you almost admit being wrong. You must assume yourself to\r\n    be right, that you are justified in the course which you have\r\n    taken, and act consistently on that view. When parliament meets, I\r\n    think the proper course would be for the Speaker to say that he\r\n    had received a certificate of vacancy from two members, but not\r\n    the notice from the member himself, and having doubts he referred\r\n    the matter to the House, according to the Act. This ensures the\r\n    priority of the question and calls on you to explain your not\r\n    having sent the notice. You state the facts as above, place\r\n    yourself in the hands of the House, and withdraw. I agree with\r\n    what Bright said that the House of Commons will deal quite fairly\r\n    in such a case. A committee will be appointed. I don’t think it\r\n    can last very long, and you will be absent during its sitting. No\r\n    important business can be taken during your absence, and I do not\r\n    know that any evil will ensue from shortening the period of\r\n    business before the budget. They may vote estimates, or take minor\r\n    matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis sensible view of Lord Halifax and Mr. Bright may be set against Lord\r\nSelborne’s dogmatic assertion that a dissolution was the only escape. As\r\nfor his further assertion about his never doubting that this was the\r\ndetermining cause of the dissolution, I can only say that in the mass of\r\npapers connected with the Greenwich seat and the dissolution, there is no\r\nsingle word in one of them associating in any way either topic with the\r\nother. Mr. Gladstone acted so promptly in the affair of the seat that both\r\nthe Speaker of the House of Commons and Lord Selborne himself said that no\r\nfault could be found with him. His position before the House was therefore\r\nentirely straightforward. Finally Mr. Gladstone gave an obviously adequate\r\nand sufficient case for the dissolution both to the Queen and to the\r\ncabinet, and stated to at least three of his colleagues what was “the\r\ndetermining cause,” and this was not the Greenwich seat, but something\r\nwholly remote from it.(298)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe autumn recess began with attendance at Balmoral, of which a glimpse or\r\ntwo remain:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Mrs. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    _Balmoral, Aug. 22, 1873._—The Queen in a long conversation asked\r\n    me to-day about you at Holyhead. She talked of many matters, and\r\n    made me sit down, because odd to say I had a sudden touch of my\r\n    enemy yesterday afternoon, which made me think it prudent to beg\r\n    off from dining with her, and keep on my back taking a strong dose\r\n    of sal volatile.... The Queen had occasion to speak about the\r\n    Crown Princess, lauded her talents, did not care a pin for her\r\n    (the Queen’s) opinion, used to care only for that of her\r\n    father....\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 24._—To-day I had a long talk. Nothing can be better than\r\n    her humour. She is going to Fort William on the 8th. I leave on\r\n    Saturday, but if I make my Highland walk it cannot be till Monday,\r\n    and all next week will probably be consumed in getting me home.\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 27._—I enclose a copy of my intimation to the Queen [the\r\n    engagement of his eldest daughter], which has drawn forth _in a\r\n    few minutes_ the accompanying most charming letter from her. I\r\n    think the original of this should be given to Agnes herself, as\r\n    she will think it a great treasure; we keeping a copy. Is it not a\r\n    little odd on our part, more than his, that (at least so far as I\r\n    am concerned) we have allowed this great Aye to be said, without a\r\n    single word on the subject of the means of support forthcoming? It\r\n    is indeed a proceeding worthy of the times of the Acts of the\r\n    Apostles! You perhaps know a little more than I do. _Your_ family\r\n    were not very worldly minded people, but you will remember that\r\n    before our engagement, Stephen was spirited up, most properly, to\r\n    put a question to me about means. Yesterday I was not so much\r\n    struck at hearing nothing on the subject of any sublunary\r\n    particular; but lo! again your letter of to-day arrives with all\r\n    about the charms of the orphanage, but not a syllable on beef and\r\n    mutton, bread and butter, which after all cannot be altogether\r\n    dispensed with.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this visit Lord Granville wrote to him (Sept. 20): “The Queen told me\r\nlast night that she had never known you so remarkably agreeable.” The\r\njourney closed with a rather marked proof of bodily soundness in a man\r\nnearly through his sixty-fourth year, thus recorded in his diary:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 25._—[At Balmoral]. Walked thirteen miles, quite fresh.\r\n    26.—Walked 8-½ miles in 2 h. 10 m. _Sept. 1._—Off at 9.15 [from\r\n    Invercauld] to Castleton and Derry Lodge, driving. From the Lodge\r\n    at 11.15, thirty-three miles to Kingussie on foot. Half an hour\r\n    for luncheon, 1/4 hour waiting for the ponies (the road so rough\r\n    on the hill); touched a carriageable road at 5, the top at 3. Very\r\n    grand hill views, floods of rain on Speyside. Good hotel at\r\n    Kingussie, but sorely disturbed by rats.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Think,” he wrote to his daughter Mary from Naworth, “of my walking a good\r\nthree and thirty miles last Monday, some of it the roughest ground I ever\r\npassed.” He was always wont to enjoy proofs of physical vigour, never\r\nforgetting how indispensable it is in the equipment of the politician for\r\nthe athletics of public life. On his return home, he resumed the equable\r\ncourse of life associated with that happy place, though political\r\nconsultations intruded:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 6._—Settled down again at Hawarden, where a happy family\r\n    party gathered to-day. 13.—Finished the long and sad but\r\n    profoundly interesting task of my letter to Miss Hope-Scott [on\r\n    her father]. Also sent her father’s letters (105) to her.... We\r\n    finished cutting down a great beech. Our politicians arrived.\r\n    Conversations with Bright, with Wolverton, with Granville, and\r\n    with all three till long past twelve, when I prayed to leave off\r\n    for the sake of the brain. 14.—Church morning and evening.... A\r\n    stiff task for a half exhausted brain. But I cannot desist from a\r\n    sacred task. Conversation with Lord Granville, Lord Wolverton, Mr.\r\n    Bright. 15.—Church, 8-½ A.M. Spent the forenoon in conclave till\r\n    two, after a preliminary conversation with Bright. Spent the\r\n    evening also in conclave, we have covered a good deal of\r\n    ground.... Cut down the half-cut alder. 16.—Final conversation\r\n    with Granville, with Wolverton, and with Bright, who went last.\r\n    18.—Wood-cutting with Herbert, then went up to Stephen’s school\r\n    feast, an animated and pretty scene. 21.—Read Manning’s letter to\r\n    Archbishop of Armagh. There is in it to me a sad air of unreality;\r\n    it is on stilts all through. 27.—Conversation with Mr. Palgrave\r\n    chiefly on Symonds and the Greek mythology.... Cut a tree with\r\n    Herbert. 28.—Conversation with Mr. Palgrave. He is tremendous, but\r\n    in all other respects good and full of mental energy and activity,\r\n    only the vent is rather large. 29.—Conversation with Mr. Palgrave,\r\n    pretty stiff. Wood-cutting with Herbert. Wrote a rough mem. and\r\n    computation for the budget of next year. I want eight millions to\r\n    handle! _Oct. 2._—Off at 8, London at 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe memorial letter on the departed friend of days long past, if less rich\r\nthan the companion piece upon Lord Aberdeen, is still a graceful example\r\nof tender reminiscence and regret poured out in periods of grave\r\nmelody.(299) It is an example, too, how completely in the press of turbid\r\naffairs, he could fling off the load and at once awake afresh the thoughts\r\nand associations that in truth made up his inmost life.\r\n\r\n(M152) Next came the autumn cabinets, with all their embarrassments, so\r\nnumerous that one minister tossed a scrap across the table to another, “We\r\nought to have impeached Dizzy for not taking office last spring.” Disraeli\r\nhad at least done them one service. An election took place at Bath in\r\nOctober. The conservative leader wrote a violent letter in support of the\r\nconservative candidate. “For nearly five years,” said Mr. Disraeli, “the\r\npresent ministers have harassed every trade, worried every profession and\r\nassailed or menaced every class, institution, and species of property in\r\nthe country. Occasionally they have varied this state of civil warfare by\r\nperpetrating some job which outraged public opinion, or by stumbling into\r\nmistakes which have been always discreditable and sometimes ruinous. All\r\nthis they call a policy and seem quite proud of it; but the country has I\r\nthink made up its mind to close this career of plundering and\r\nblundering.”(300) Mr. Gladstone described this curious outburst as “Mr.\r\nDisraeli’s incomparable stroke on our behalf,” and in fact its effect on\r\npublic opinion was to send the liberal candidate to the head of the poll.\r\nBut the victory at Bath stood solitary in the midst of reverses.\r\n\r\nAs for the general legislative business of the coming session, Mr.\r\nGladstone thought it impossible to take up the large subject of the\r\nextension of the county franchise, but they might encourage Mr. Trevelyan\r\nto come forward with it on an early day, and give him all the help they\r\ncould. Still the board was bare, the meal too frugal. They were afraid of\r\nproposing a change in the laws affecting the inheritance of land, or\r\nreform of London government, or a burials bill, or a county government\r\nbill. The home secretary was directed to draw up a bill for a group of\r\ndifficult questions as to employers and employed. No more sentences were\r\nto be provided for Mr. Disraeli’s next electioneering letter.\r\n\r\nDecember was mainly spent at Hawarden. A pleasant event was his eldest\r\ndaughter’s marriage, of which he wrote to the Duke of Argyll:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The kindness of _all_ from the Queen down, to the cottagers and\r\n    poor folks about us, has been singular and most touching. Our\r\n    weather for the last fortnight has been delightful, and we\r\n    earnestly hope it may hold over to-morrow. I have not yet read\r\n    Renan’s _apôtres_. My opinion of him is completely dual. His life\r\n    of Our Lord I thought a piece of trumpery; his work _Sur les\r\n    langues sémitiques_ most able and satisfactory in its manner and\r\n    discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe notes in the diary bring us up to the decision that was to end the\r\ngreat ministry:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 1._—Dined at Mr. Forster’s and went to Drury Lane to see in\r\n    _Antony and Cleopatra_ how low our stage has fallen. Miss K. V. in\r\n    the ballet, dressed in black and gold, danced marvellously. 2.—To\r\n    Windsor, and had a long audience of the Queen. Dined with H.M.\r\n    Whist in evening. 3.—Castle. Prayers at 9; St. George’s at 10.30.\r\n    Off to Twickenham at 11.25. Visited Mr. Bohn, and saw his\r\n    collection; enormous and of very great interest. Then to Pembroke\r\n    Lodge, luncheon and long conversation with Lord Russell.... Read\r\n    _The Parisians_. 6.—Packing, etc., and off to Hawarden. 13.—Walked\r\n    with Stephen Glynne. I opened to him that I must give up my house\r\n    at or about the expiry of the present government. 15.—Read\r\n    Montalembert’s _Life_; also my article of 1852 on him. Mr. Herbert\r\n    (R.A.) came and I sat to him for a short time. 17.—Finished _Life_\r\n    of Montalembert. It was a pure and noble career personally; in a\r\n    public view unsatisfactory; the pope was a worm in the gourd all\r\n    through. His oratory was great. 19.—With Herbert set about making\r\n    a walk from Glynne Cottage to W. E. G. door. 20.—Sat to Mr.\r\n    Herbert. Worked on version of the “Shield” [_Iliad_]. Worked on\r\n    new path. 23.—Sat 1-3/4 hours to Mr. Herbert. Worked on correcting\r\n    version of the Shield and finished writing it out. Read\r\n    Aristophanes. 26.—24 to dinner, a large party gathered for the\r\n    marriage. 27.—The house continued full. At 10.30 the weather broke\r\n    into violent hail and rain. It was the only speck upon the\r\n    brightness of the marriage. 29.—Sixty-four years completed\r\n    to-day—what have they brought me? A weaker heart, stiffened\r\n    muscles, thin hairs; other strength still remains in my frame.\r\n    31.—Still a full house. The year ends as it were in tumult. My\r\n    constant tumult of business makes other tumult more sensible.... I\r\n    cannot as I now am, get sufficiently out of myself to judge\r\n    myself, and unravel the knots of being and doing of which my life\r\n    seems to be full.\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 1, 1874._—A little _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_. 2.—Tree-cutting.\r\n    Read Fitzjames Stephen on _Parliamentary Government_, not\r\n    wizard-like. (No. 2.) 6.—Read _The Parisians_, vol. iv., Muir’s\r\n    beautiful version of Gray’s _Elegy_, and the Dizzy pamphlet on the\r\n    crisis. 8.—Revised and sent off the long letter to Lord Granville\r\n    on the political situation which I wrote yesterday. Axe work.\r\n    9.—Tree-cutting with Herbert. Sent off with some final touches my\r\n    version of the Shield and preface. 10.—Mr. Burnett [his agent]\r\n    died at one A.M. Requiescat. I grieve over this good and able man\r\n    sincerely, apart from the heavy care and responsibility of\r\n    replacing him, which must fall on me of necessity. 15.—Worked with\r\n    Herbert; we finished gravelling the path. It rather strains my\r\n    chest. 16.—Off to town after an early breakfast. Reached C. H. T.\r\n    about 3 P.M. Saw Lord Granville and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV. The Dissolution. (1874)\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... Cette prétendue sagacité qui se croit profonde, quand elle\r\n    suppose partout des intrigues savantes, et met de petits drames\r\n    arrangés a la place de la vérité. II n’y a pas tant de\r\n    préméditation dans les affaires humaines, et leur cours est plus\r\n    naturel, que ne le croit le vulgaire.—GUIZOT.\r\n\r\n    The spurious sagacity that thinks itself deep, because it\r\n    everywhere takes for granted all sorts of knowing intrigues, and\r\n    puts little artful dramas in the place of truth. There is less\r\n    premeditation in human affairs, and their course is more natural\r\n    than people commonly believe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1873 before leaving London for Hawarden, Mr. Gladstone\r\nsent for the chairman of the board of inland revenue and for the head of\r\nthe finance department of the treasury; he directed them to get certain\r\ninformation into order for him. His requests at once struck these\r\nexperienced officers with a surmise that he was nursing some design of\r\ndealing with the income-tax. Here are two entries from his diary:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 11, 1873._—Saw Mr. Cardwell, to whom at the war office I\r\n    told in deep secrecy my ideas of the _possible_ finance of next\r\n    year, based upon the abolition of income-tax and sugar duties,\r\n    with partial compensation from spirit and death duties. _Sept.\r\n    29._—Wrote a rough mem. and computation for budget of next year. I\r\n    want eight millions to handle!\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much for the charitable tale that he only bethought him of the\r\nincome-tax, when desperately hunting for a card to play at a general\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nThe prospect was dubious and dark. To Mr. Bright he wrote from Hawarden\r\n(Aug. 14):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR BRIGHT,—(Let us bid farewell to _Misters_.) ... As to the\r\n    parliamentary future of the question of education, we had better\r\n    talk when we meet. I remember your saying well and wisely how we\r\n    should look to the average opinion of the party. What we want at\r\n    present is a _positive_ force to carry us onward as a body. I do\r\n    not see that this can be got out of local taxation, or out of the\r\n    suffrage (whether we _act_ in that matter or not, and individually\r\n    I am more yes than no), or out of education. It may possibly, I\r\n    think, be had out of _finance_. Of course I cannot as yet see my\r\n    way on that subject; but until it is cleared, nothing else will to\r\n    me be clear. If it can be worked into certain shapes, it may\r\n    greatly help to mould the rest, at least for the time. I think the\r\n    effect of the reconstruction may be described as follows: First,\r\n    we have you. Secondly, we have emerged from the discredit and\r\n    disgrace of the exposures by an administration of mild penal\r\n    justice, which will be complete all round when Monsell has been\r\n    disposed of. Thirdly, we have now before us a clean stage for the\r\n    consideration of measures in the autumn. We must, I think, have a\r\n    good bill of fare, or none. If we differ on the things to be done,\r\n    this may end us in a way at least not dishonourable. If we agree\r\n    on a good plan, it must come to good, _whether_ we succeed or fail\r\n    with it. Such are my crude reflections, and such my outlook for\r\n    the future. Let me again say how sensible I am of the kindness,\r\n    friendship, and public spirit with which you have acted in the\r\n    whole of this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the year his mind was drawing towards a decision of\r\nmoment. On January 8, 1874, he wrote a letter to Lord Granville, and the\r\ncopy of it is docketed, “First idea of Dissolution.” It contains a full\r\nexamination of the actual case in which they found themselves; it is\r\ninstructive on more than one constitutional point, and it gives an\r\nentirely intelligible explanation of a step that was often imputed to\r\ninjurious and low-minded motives:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, Jan. 8, 1874._—The signs of weakness multiply, and for\r\n    some time have multiplied, upon the government, in the loss of\r\n    control over the legislative action of the House of Lords, the\r\n    diminution of the majority in the House of Commons without its\r\n    natural compensation in increase of unity and discipline, and the\r\n    almost unbroken series of defeats at single elections in the\r\n    country.(301) In truth the government is approaching, though I\r\n    will not say it has yet reached, the condition in which it will\r\n    have ceased to possess that amount of power which is necessary for\r\n    the dignity of the crown and the welfare of the country; and in\r\n    which it might be a godsend if some perfectly honourable\r\n    difference of opinion among ourselves on a question requiring\r\n    immediate action were to arise, and to take such a course as to\r\n    release us collectively from the responsibilities of office.\r\n\r\n    The general situation being thus unfavourable, the ordinary\r\n    remedies are not available. A ministry with a majority, and with\r\n    that majority not in rebellion, could not resign on account of\r\n    adverse manifestations even of very numerous single\r\n    constituencies, without making a precedent, and constitutionally a\r\n    bad precedent; and only a very definite and substantive difficulty\r\n    could warrant resignation without dissolution, after the\r\n    proceedings of the opposition in March last, when they, or at any\r\n    rate their leaders and their whips, brought the Queen into a\r\n    ministerial crisis, and deserted her when there. If then we turn\r\n    to consider dissolution, what would be its results? In my opinion\r\n    the very best that could happen would be that we should come back\r\n    with a small majority composed of Irish home rulers and a decided\r\n    minority without them; while to me it seems very doubtful whether\r\n    even with home rulers counted in, we should command a full half of\r\n    the House of Commons. In a word, dissolution means either\r\n    immediate death, or at the best death a little postponed, and the\r\n    party either way shattered for the time. For one I am anxious to\r\n    continue where we are, because I am very loath to leave the party\r\n    in its present menacing condition, without having first made every\r\n    effort in our power to avert this public mischief.\r\n\r\n    If I have made myself intelligible up to this point, the question\r\n    that arises is, can we make out such a course of policy for the\r\n    session, either in the general conduct of business, or in some\r\n    departments and by certain measures, as will with reasonable\r\n    likelihood reanimate some portion of that sentiment in our favour,\r\n    which carried us in a manner so remarkable through the election of\r\n    1868? I discuss the matter now in its aspect towards party: it is\r\n    not necessary to make an argument to show that our option can only\r\n    be among things all of which are sound in principle. First, then,\r\n    I do not believe that we can find this recovery of vital force in\r\n    our general administration of public business. As men,\r\n    notwithstanding the advantage drawn from Bright’s return, the\r\n    nation appears to think that it has had enough of us, that our\r\n    lease is out. It is a question of measures then: can we by any\r\n    measures materially mend the position of the party for an\r\n    impending election?...\r\n\r\n    Looking to legislation, there are but three subjects which appear\r\n    to me to be even capable of discussion in the view I have\r\n    presented. They are local taxation, the county suffrage, and\r\n    finance. I am convinced it is not in our power to draw any great\r\n    advantage, as a party, from the subject of local taxation....\r\n    Equally strong is my opinion with respect to the party bearings of\r\n    the question of the county franchise. We have indeed already\r\n    determined not to propose it as a government. Had we done so, a\r\n    case would have opened at once, comfortably furnished not with men\r\n    opposing us on principle, like a part of those who opposed in\r\n    1866, but with the men of pretext and the men of disappointment,\r\n    with intriguers and with egotists. And I believe that in the\r\n    present state of opinion they would gain their end by something\r\n    like the old game of playing redistribution against the\r\n    franchise....\r\n\r\n    Can we then look to finance as supplying what we want? This is the\r\n    only remaining question. It does not admit, as yet, of a positive\r\n    answer, but it admits conditionally of a negative answer. It is\r\n    easy to show what will prevent our realising our design through\r\n    the finance of the year. We cannot do it, unless the circumstances\r\n    shall be such as to put it in our power, by the possession of a\r\n    very wide margin, to propose something large and strong and\r\n    telling upon both the popular mind and the leading elements of the\r\n    constituency.... We cannot do it, without running certain risks of\r\n    the kind that were run in the budget of 1853: I mean without some\r\n    impositions, as well as remissions, of taxes. We cannot do it,\r\n    without a continuance of the favourable prospects of harvest and\r\n    of business. Lastly, we cannot do it unless we can frame our\r\n    estimates in a manner to show our desire to adhere to the\r\n    principles of economy which we proposed and applied with such\r\n    considerable effect in 1868-70. But, subject to the fulfilment of\r\n    these conditions, my opinion is that we _can_ do it: can frame a\r\n    budget large enough and palpably beneficial enough, not only to do\r\n    much good to the country, but sensibly to lift the party in the\r\n    public view and estimation. And this, although a serious sum will\r\n    have to be set apart, even in the present year, for the claims of\r\n    local taxation....\r\n\r\n    If we can get from three-quarters of a million upwards towards a\r\n    million off the naval and military estimates jointly, then as far\r\n    as I can judge we shall have left the country no reason to\r\n    complain, and may proceed cheerily with our work; though we should\r\n    not escape the fire of the opposition for having failed to\r\n    maintain the level of Feb. 1870; which indeed we never announced\r\n    as our ultimatum of reduction. I have had no communication with\r\n    those of our colleagues who would most keenly desire reductions; I\r\n    might say, with any one.... I will only add that I think a broad\r\n    difference of opinion among us on such a question as this would be\r\n    a difference of the kind which I described near the opening of\r\n    this letter, as what might be in certain circumstances, however\r\n    unwelcome in itself, an escape from a difficulty otherwise\r\n    incapable of solution.\r\n\r\n    Let me now wind up this long story by saying that my desire in\r\n    framing it has been simply to grasp the facts, and to set aside\r\n    illusions which appear to me to prevail among sections of the\r\n    liberal party, nowhere so much as in that section which believes\r\n    itself to be the most enlightened. If we can only get a correct\r\n    appreciation of the position, I do not think we shall fail in\r\n    readiness to suit our action to it; but I am bound to confess\r\n    myself not very sanguine, if the _best_ come to the best, as to\r\n    immediate results, though full of confidence, if we act aright, as\r\n    to the future and early reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M153) In notes written in the last year of his life, Mr. Gladstone adds a\r\ndetail of importance to the considerations set out in the letter to Lord\r\nGranville. The reader will have observed that among the conditions\r\nrequired for his operation on the income-tax he names economic estimates.\r\nIn this quarter, he tells us, grave difficulties arose:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    No trustworthy account of the dissolution of parliament which took\r\n    place early in 1874 has ever been published. When I proposed the\r\n    dissolution to the cabinet, they acceded to it without opposition,\r\n    or, I think, even discussion. The actual occasion of the measure\r\n    was known, I think, only to Lord Granville and Lord Cardwell with\r\n    myself, it having a sufficient warrant from other sources.\r\n\r\n    In 1871, the year of the abolition of purchase and other important\r\n    army reforms, I had, in full understanding with Cardwell, made a\r\n    lengthened speech, in which I referred to the immediate\r\n    augmentations of military expenditure which the reforms demanded,\r\n    but held out to the House of Commons the prospect of compensating\r\n    abatements at early dates through the operation of the new system\r\n    of relying considerably upon reserves for imperial defence.\r\n\r\n    When Cardwell laid before me at the proper time, in view of the\r\n    approaching session, his proposed estimates for 1874-5, I was\r\n    strongly of opinion that the time had arrived for our furnishing\r\n    by a very moderate reduction of expenditure on the army, some\r\n    earnest of the reality of the promise made in 1871 which had been\r\n    so efficacious in procuring the enlargement that we had then\r\n    required. Cardwell, though not an extravagant minister, objected\r\n    to my demand of (I think) £200,000. I conferred with Granville,\r\n    who, without any direct knowledge of the subject, took my side,\r\n    and thought Cardwell would give way. But he continued to resist;\r\n    and, viewing the age of the parliament, I was thus driven to the\r\n    idea of dissolution, for I regarded the matter as virtually\r\n    involving the whole question of the value of our promises, an\r\n    anticipation which has proved to be correct. Cardwell entered\r\n    readily into the plan of dissolving, and moreover thought that if\r\n    my views carried the day with the constituencies, this would\r\n    enable him to comply.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe papers in my hands confirm Mr. Gladstone’s recollection on this part\r\nof the transaction, except that Mr. Goschen, then at the head of the\r\nadmiralty, was to some extent in the same position as Mr. Cardwell. The\r\nprime minister was in active controversy with both the great spending\r\ndepartments, and with little chance of prevailing. It was this controversy\r\nthat opened the door for immediate dissolution, though the general grounds\r\nfor dissolution at some near time were only too abundant. Here is his note\r\nof the position,—in a minute addressed to Mr. Cardwell and Mr. Goschen:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 22, 1874._—We arrived yesterday at the conclusion that,\r\n    apart from this or that shade of view as to exact figure of the\r\n    estimates, the measure now proposed stood well on its own general\r\n    grounds. This being so, after consulting Lord Granville, and\r\n    indeed at his suggestion, I have in a preparatory letter to the\r\n    Queen founded myself entirely on general grounds. This being so, I\r\n    would propose to consider the point raised between us as one\r\n    adjourned, though with a perfect knowledge in each of our minds as\r\n    to the views of the others. My statement to the cabinet must be on\r\n    the same basis as my statement to the Queen. The actual decision\r\n    of the estimates would stand over from to-morrow’s cabinet, until\r\n    we saw our way as to their position and as to the time for their\r\n    production. I am sure I might reckon on your keeping the future as\r\n    far as possible open, and unprejudiced by contracts for works or\r\n    for building or construction. Any reference to economy which I\r\n    make to-morrow will be in general terms such as I propose to use\r\n    in an address. If I have made myself clear and you approve, please\r\n    to signify it on this paper, or to speak to me as you may prefer.\r\n    I am reluctant to go out, with my chest still tender, in the fog.\r\n\r\n\r\nCardwell, in the few words of his minute in reply makes no objection. Mr.\r\nGoschen says: “I quite take the same view as you do. Indeed, I had\r\nproposed myself to ask you whether what had passed between us had not\r\nbetter remain entirely confidential for the present, as it is best not to\r\nstate differences where the statement of them is not indispensable.”\r\n\r\nThe diary for these important days is interesting:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jan.17, ’74._—The prospects of agreement with the two departments\r\n    on estimates are for the present bad. 18.—This day I thought of\r\n    dissolution. Told Bright of it. In evening at dinner told\r\n    Granville and Wolverton. All seemed to approve. My first thought\r\n    of it was as an escape from a difficulty. I soon saw on reflection\r\n    that it was the best thing in itself. 19.—Confined all day in bed\r\n    with tightness on the chest. Much physicking. 20.—Bed all day. I\r\n    spent the chief part of the day and evening in reflection on our\r\n    “crisis,” and then in preparing a letter to go to the Queen for\r\n    her information at once, and a long address for an unnamed\r\n    constituency—almost a pamphlet—setting out the case of the\r\n    government in an immediate appeal to the country. 21.—Altered and\r\n    modified letter to the Queen, which went off. Came down at two.\r\n    Much conversation to-day on the question of my own seat.\r\n    23.—Cabinet 12-1/4-4. Address further amended there on partial\r\n    perusal. In evening corrected proofs of address, which runs well.\r\n    A very busy stirring day of incessant action.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the letter of Jan. 21 to the Queen, Mr. Gladstone recapitulates the\r\ngeneral elements of difficulty, and apprises her Majesty that it will be\r\nhis duty at the meeting of the cabinet fixed for the 23rd, to recommend\r\nhis colleagues humbly and dutifully to advise an immediate dissolution, as\r\nthe best means of putting an end to the disadvantage and the weakness of a\r\nfalse position. He trusts that the Queen may be pleased to assent. The\r\nQueen (Jan. 22) acknowledged the receipt of his letter “with some\r\nsurprise,” as she had understood him to say when last at Windsor that he\r\ndid not think of recommending a dissolution until the end of the session\r\nor later. But she expressed her “full appreciation of the difficulties of\r\nMr. Gladstone’s position,” and assented, thinking that “in the present\r\ncircumstances it would be desirable to obtain an expression of the\r\nnational opinion.”\r\n\r\nThe next day (23rd) the cabinet met, and Mr. Gladstone in the evening\r\nreported the proceedings to the Queen:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To the Queen._\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 23, 1874._—... Mr. Gladstone laid before the cabinet a\r\n    pretty full outline of the case as to the weakness of the\r\n    government since the crisis of last March, and the increase of\r\n    that weakness, especially of late, from the unfavourable character\r\n    of local indications; as to the false position in which both the\r\n    crown and the House of Commons are placed when there can be no\r\n    other government than the one actually existing; finally, as to\r\n    the present calls of business and prospects of the country,\r\n    especially as to its finance, which are such as in Mr. Gladstone’s\r\n    judgment, to warrant the presentation of a very favourable picture\r\n    of what may be effected with energy and prudence during the\r\n    present year. In this picture is included, as Mr. Gladstone on\r\n    Wednesday intimated might be the case, the total repeal of the\r\n    income-tax. The cabinet unanimously concurred, upon a review of\r\n    its grounds, in the wisdom of the proposed measure. It is as yet\r\n    profoundly secret, but to-morrow morning it will be placed before\r\n    the world with a lengthened and elaborate exposition, in the shape\r\n    of an address from Mr. Gladstone to his constituents at Greenwich.\r\n    There can be no doubt that a large portion of the public will at\r\n    first experience that emotion of surprise which your Majesty so\r\n    very naturally felt on receiving Mr. Gladstone’s letter. But,\r\n    judging from such indications as have reached them, the cabinet\r\n    are disposed to anticipate that this course will be approved by\r\n    all those who are in any degree inclined to view their general\r\n    policy with sympathy or favour. Large portions, and the most\r\n    important portions, of Mr. Gladstone’s address were read to and\r\n    considered by the cabinet, and it was in some respects amended at\r\n    the suggestion of his esteemed colleagues. It is, however, so\r\n    framed as not to commit them equally with himself, except only as\r\n    to the remissions of taxes and aid to local rates contemplated in\r\n    the finance of the year. This method of stating generally the case\r\n    of the government in substance corresponds to the proceedings of\r\n    Sir R. Peel in 1834-5, when he addressed the electors of Tamworth.\r\n    Before concluding, Mr. Gladstone will humbly offer to your Majesty\r\n    a brief explanation. When he last adverted to the duration of the\r\n    present parliament, his object was to remind your Majesty of the\r\n    extreme point to which that duration might extend. When he had the\r\n    honour of seeing your Majesty at Windsor,(302) the course of the\r\n    local elections had been more favourable, and Mr. Gladstone had\r\n    not abandoned the hope of retaining sufficient strength for the\r\n    due conduct of affairs in the present House. On this question, the\r\n    events of the last few weeks and the prospects of the present\r\n    moment have somewhat tended to turn the scale in his mind and that\r\n    of his colleagues.(303) But finally it was not within his power,\r\n    until the fourth quarter of the financial year had well begun, to\r\n    forecast the financial policy and measures which form a necessary\r\n    and indeed the most vital part of the matter to be stated to the\r\n    public. Immediately after he had been able sufficiently to ripen\r\n    his own thoughts on the matter, he did not scruple to lay them\r\n    before your Majesty; and your Majesty had yourself in one sense\r\n    contributed to the present conclusion by forcibly pointing out to\r\n    Mr. Gladstone on one or more occasions that in the event of\r\n    difficulty, under the present peculiar circumstances, no\r\n    alternative remained except a dissolution. The mild weather is\r\n    very favourable to Mr. Gladstone, and if as he has prayed there\r\n    shall be a council on Monday, he hopes to have the honour of\r\n    coming down to Osborne.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo his eldest son he wrote on the following day:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    We here of the cabinet(304) and the whips are in admirable\r\n    spirits. We dissolve on Finance. The surplus will be over five\r\n    millions. We promise as in our judgment practicable,—1. Pecuniary\r\n    aid to local taxation, but with reform of it. 2. Repeal of the\r\n    income-tax. 3. Some great remission in the class of articles of\r\n    consumption. (This last remission probably means sugar, but\r\n    nothing is to be said by any member of the government as to choice\r\n    of the article.) We make it a question of confidence on the\r\n    _prospective_ budget. As far as we can judge, friends will much\r\n    approve our course, although for the public there may at first be\r\n    surprise, and the enemy will be furious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prime minister’s manifesto to his constituents at Greenwich was\r\nelaborate and sustained. In substance it did no more than amplify the\r\nvarious considerations that he had set forth in his letter to Lord\r\nGranville. The pith of it was a promise to diminish local taxation, and to\r\nrepeal the income-tax. At the same time marked relief was to be given to\r\nthe general consumer in respect of articles of popular consumption. One\r\neffective passage dealt with the charge that the liberal party had\r\nendangered the institutions of the country. “It is time,” said Mr.\r\nGladstone, “to test this trite and vague allegation. There has elapsed a\r\nperiod of forty, or more exactly forty-three years, since the liberal\r\nparty acquired the main direction of public affairs. This followed another\r\nperiod of about forty years beginning with the outbreak of the\r\nrevolutionary war, during which there had been an almost unbroken rule of\r\ntheir opponents, who claimed and were reputed to be the great preservers\r\nof the institutions of the country.” He then invited men to judge by\r\ngeneral results, and declared that the forty years of tory rule closing in\r\n1830 left institutions weaker than it had found them, whereas the liberal\r\nterm of forty years left throne, laws, and institutions not weaker but\r\nmuch stronger. The address was a fine bold composition, but perhaps it\r\nwould have been more effective with a public that was impatient and out of\r\nhumour, if it had been shorter.\r\n\r\n(M154) The performance was styled by his rival “a prolix narrative,” but\r\nit is said that in spite of this Mr. Disraeli read it with much alarm. He\r\nthought its freshness and boldness would revive Mr. Gladstone’s authority,\r\nand carry the elections. His own counter-manifesto was highly artificial.\r\nHe launched sarcasms about the Greenwich seat, about too much energy in\r\ndomestic legislation, and too little in foreign policy; about an act of\r\nfolly or of ignorance rarely equalled in dealing with the straits of\r\nMalacca (though for that matter not one elector in a hundred thousand had\r\never heard of this nefarious act). While absolving the prime minister\r\nhimself, “certainly at present,” from hostility to our national\r\ninstitutions and the integrity of the empire, he drew a picture of\r\nunfortunate adherents—some assailed the monarchy, others impugned the\r\nindependence of the House of Lords, while others would relieve parliament\r\naltogether from any share in the government of one portion of the United\r\nKingdom; others, again, urged Mr. Gladstone to pursue his peculiar policy\r\nby disestablishing the anglican as he has despoiled the Irish church; even\r\ntrusted colleagues in his cabinet openly concurred with them in their\r\ndesire altogether to thrust religion from the place which it ought to\r\noccupy in national education. What is remarkable in Disraeli’s address is\r\nthat to the central proposal of his adversary he offered no objection. As\r\nfor remission of taxation, he said, that would be the course of any party\r\nor any ministry. As for the promise of reduced local burdens and the\r\nabolition of the income-tax, why, these “were measures which the\r\nconservative party have always favoured and which the prime minister and\r\nhis friends have always opposed.”\r\n\r\nBy critics of the peevish school who cry for better bread than can be made\r\nof political wheat, Mr. Gladstone’s proffer to do away with the income-tax\r\nhas been contumeliously treated as dangling a shameful bait. Such talk is\r\nsurely pharisaic stuff. As if in 1852 Disraeli in his own address had not\r\ndeclared that the government would have for its first object to relieve\r\nthe agricultural interest from certain taxes. Was that a bribe? As if Peel\r\nin 1834-5 had not set forth in the utmost detail all the measures that he\r\nintended to submit to parliament if the constituencies would give him a\r\nmajority. Was this to drive an unprincipled bargain? As if every minister\r\ndoes not always go to the country on promises, and as if the material of\r\nany promise could be more legitimate than a readjustment of taxation. The\r\nproceeding was styled a sordid huckstering of a financial secret for a\r\nmajority. Why was it more sordid to seek a majority for abolition of the\r\nincome-tax, than it was sordid in Peel in 1841 to seek a majority for corn\r\nlaws, or in whigs and Manchester men to seek to win upon free trade? Why\r\nis it an ignoble bargain to promise to remove the tax from income, and\r\npure statesmanship to remove the tax from bread? “Give us a majority,”\r\nsaid Mr. Gladstone, “and we will do away with income-tax, lighten local\r\nburdens, and help to free the breakfast table.” If people believed him,\r\nwhat better reason could they have than such a prospect as this for\r\nretaining him in the place of their chief ruler?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament was dissolved on January 26, and the contending forces\r\ninstantly engaged. Mr. Gladstone did not spare himself:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 26, ’74._—8-3/4-5-3/4. To Osborne. Audience of H.M. who\r\n    quite comprehends the provisional character of the position. ...\r\n    Boundless newspaper reading. 28.—2-5. To Greenwich. Spoke an hour\r\n    to 5000. An enthusiastic meeting, but the general prospects are\r\n    far from clear.(305) 31.—-Woolwich meeting. The meeting disturbed\r\n    by design was strangely brought round again. _Feb. 2._—Third great\r\n    meeting and speech of an hour at New Cross for Deptford. Much\r\n    enthusiasm and fair order. 3.—Many telegrams and much conversation\r\n    with Granville and Wolverton in the evening. The general purport\r\n    was first indifferent, then bad. My own election for Greenwich\r\n    after Boord the distiller, is more like a defeat than a victory,\r\n    though it places me in parliament again. A wakeful night, but more\r\n    I believe from a little strong coffee drunk incautiously, than\r\n    from the polls, which I cannot help and have done all in my power\r\n    to mend.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greenwich seat, the cause of such long perturbation, was saved after\r\nall, but as Mr. Gladstone wrote to a defeated colleague, “In some points\r\nof view it is better to be defeated outright, than to be pitched in like\r\nme at Greenwich.” The numbers were Boord (C.) 6193, Gladstone (L.) 5968,\r\nLiardet (C.) 5561, Langley (L.) 5255.\r\n\r\n(M155) The conservative reaction was general. Scotland and Wales still\r\nreturned a liberal majority, but even in these strongholds a breach was\r\nmade—a net loss of 3 in Wales, of 9 in Scotland. From the English counties\r\n145 tories were returned, and no more than 27 liberals, a loss of 13. In\r\nthe greater boroughs, hitherto regarded as staunchly ministerial, some of\r\nthe most populous returned tories. The metropolitan elections went against\r\nthe government, and 7 seats were lost—three in the city, one in\r\nWestminster, in both cases by immense majorities. The net liberal loss in\r\nthe English boroughs was 32. In England and Wales the tory majority was\r\n105; in Great Britain it stood at 83. When all was over, the new House\r\ncontained a conservative majority of 48, or on another estimate, of 50,\r\nbut really, in Mr. Gladstone’s words, “of much greater strength.”\r\n\r\nNumbers, as Mr. Gladstone said afterwards, did not exhibit the whole\r\nmeasure of the calamity. An extraordinary portent arose in that quarter\r\nfrom which so many portents spring. “The liberal majority reckoned to have\r\nbeen returned from Ireland was at once found to be illusory. Out of the\r\n105 members the liberals were little more than a dozen. The period\r\nimmediately following the Church Act and Land Act had been chosen as one\r\nappropriate for a formal severance of the Irish national party from the\r\ngeneral body of British liberals. Their number was no less than\r\nfifty-eight, an actual majority of the Irish representation. They assumed\r\nthe name of home rulers, and established a separate parliamentary\r\norganisation. On some questions of liberal opinion co-operation was still\r\ncontinued. But, as regards the party, the weight of the home rulers\r\nclearly told more in favour of the conservative ministry than of the\r\nopposition; and the liberal party would have been stronger not weaker had\r\nthe entire body been systematically absent.”(306) Before the election was\r\nover, Mr. Chichester Fortescue had warned him that he expected defeat in\r\nthe county of Louth, for which he had sat ever since 1847; the defeat\r\ncame. Mr. Gladstone wrote to him (Feb. 11):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I receive with great concern your dark prognostication of the\r\n    result of the Louth election. It would be so painful in a public\r\n    view with regard to the gratitude of Irishmen, that I will still\r\n    hope for a better result. But with reference to the latter part of\r\n    your letter, I at once write to say that in the double event of\r\n    your rejection and your wish, I consider your claim to a peerage\r\n    indisputable. It would be hard to name the man who has done for\r\n    Ireland all that you have done, or any man that knew the greatest\r\n    Irish questions as you know them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Parnell, by the way, was not elected for Meath until April 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the adverse verdict became more and more emphatic, Mr. Gladstone stated\r\nto the Queen (Feb. 13) what was the bias of his mind, on the question\r\nwhether the expiring government should await its sentence from parliament.\r\nHe had no doubt, he said, that this course was the one most agreeable to\r\nusage, and to the rules of parliamentary government; any departure from it\r\ncould only be justified upon exceptional grounds. He was not, however,\r\nclear that this case, like that of 1868, was to be treated as exceptional,\r\npartly by reason of prevalent opinion, partly because it should be\r\nconsidered what is fair to an incoming administration with reference to\r\nthe business, especially the financial business, of the year. Lord\r\nGranville from the first seems to have been against waiting for formal\r\ndecapitation by the new House of Commons. To him Mr. Gladstone wrote (Feb.\r\n7):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I presume you will answer Bismarck’s kind telegram. Please to\r\n    mention me in your reply or not as you think proper. As to the\r\n    impending crisis of our fate, one important element, I admit, will\r\n    be the feeling of the party. I have asked Peel (whose first\r\n    feeling seems rather to be with you) to learn what he can. I tend\r\n    to harden in my own view, principle and precedent seeming to me\r\n    alike clear. There are four precedents of our own time—1835, 1841,\r\n    1852, 1859, under three ministers. The only case the other way is\r\n    that of 1868 of which the circumstances were altogether peculiar.\r\n    But I admit it to be very doubtful whether we should get beyond\r\n    the address. On the other hand I admit freely that I have no title\r\n    to press my view beyond a certain point.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M156) “It is parliament,” he argued, “not the constituencies, that ought\r\nto dismiss the government, and the proper function of the House of Commons\r\ncannot be taken from it without diminishing somewhat in dignity and\r\nauthority.” There would be reproach either way, he said; either it would\r\nbe clinging to office, or it would be running away. To run away was in\r\nevery circumstance of politics the thing to Mr. Gladstone most unbearable.\r\nAccording to Sir Robert Phillimore (Feb. 8) “Gladstone would have met\r\nparliament but his colleagues objected, though it seems they would have\r\nstood by him if he had pressed them to do so; but as he did not mean, or\r\nwas not going, to fight in the van of opposition, he thought it unfair to\r\npress them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 16, ’74._—Cabinet dinner 8-12. It went well. I did something\r\n    towards snapping the ties and winding out of the coil.\r\n    Conversation afterwards with Granville, on the flags up and down.\r\n    Then with Wolverton. To bed at 1-3/4, but lay three hours awake\r\n    (rare with me) with an overwrought brain. ... 17.—12-½-6. Went to\r\n    Windsor, and on behalf of the cabinet resigned. Took with me\r\n    _Merchant of Venice_ and _Thomas à Kempis_, each how admirable in\r\n    its way!(307) 20.—Went by 5.10 to Windsor, final audience and\r\n    kissed hands. Her Majesty very kind, the topics of conversation\r\n    were of course rather limited. 21.—I cleared my room in Downing\r\n    Street and bade it farewell, giving up my keys except the cabinet\r\n    key. 28.—Set aside about 300 vols. of pamphlets for the shambles.\r\n    _March 3._—I have given up all my keys; quitted Downing Street a\r\n    week ago; not an official box remains. But I have still the daily\r\n    visit of a kind private secretary; when that drops all is over.\r\n    5.—Hamilton paid me his last visit. To-morrow I encounter my own\r\n    correspondence single-handed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Queen repeated a former proposal of a peerage. In returning some\r\nsubmissions for her approval, she wished “likewise to record her offer to\r\nMr. Gladstone of a mark of her recognition of his services which, however,\r\nhe declines from motives which she fully appreciates.” Mr. Gladstone\r\nwrites to his brother Sir Thomas (Feb. 13):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Accept my best thanks for your kind note of yesterday. My reply to\r\n    the Queen was first made twelve months ago when we proposed to\r\n    resign simply from the failure of a great measure in H. of C. I\r\n    repeated it this year with similar expressions of gratitude, but\r\n    with the remark that even if my mind had been open on the\r\n    question, I did not think I could have accepted anything while\r\n    under that national condemnation which has been emphatically\r\n    enough pronounced at the elections. I may be wrong in my view of\r\n    the matter generally; but I can only judge for the best. I do not\r\n    see that I am wanted or should be of use in the House of Lords,\r\n    and there would be more discrepancy between rank and fortune,\r\n    which is a thing on the whole rather to be deprecated. On the\r\n    other hand, I know that the line I have marked out for myself in\r\n    the H. of C. is one not altogether easy to hold; but I have every\r\n    disposition to remain quiet there, and shall be very glad if I can\r\n    do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters from two of his colleagues explain the catastrophe. The shrewd\r\nLord Halifax says to him (Feb 12):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    As far as I can make out people are frightened—the masters were\r\n    afraid of their workmen, manufacturers afraid of strikes,\r\n    churchmen afraid of the nonconformists, many afraid of what is\r\n    going on in France and Spain—and in very unreasoning fear have all\r\n    taken refuge in conservatism. Ballot enabled them to do this\r\n    without apparently deserting their principles and party. Things in\r\n    this country as elsewhere are apt to run for a time in opposite\r\n    directions. The reaction from the quiet of Palmerston’s government\r\n    gave you strength to remove four or five old-standing abuses which\r\n    nobody had ventured to touch for years. The feelings of those who\r\n    suffer from the removal of abuses are always stronger than those\r\n    of the general public who are benefited. Gratitude for the Reform\r\n    bill and its sequel of improvements hardly gave a liberal majority\r\n    in 1835, and gratitude for the removal of the Irish church,\r\n    purchase, etc., has not given us a majority in 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M157) Mr. Bright wrote to him that as things had turned out, it would\r\nperhaps have been wiser first to secure the budget; with that and better\r\norganisation, the result might have been better three or six months later.\r\nIn Lancashire, said Bright, publicans and Irishmen had joined together,\r\none for delirium tremens and the other for religious education. The 25th\r\nclause and Mr. Forster’s obstinacy, he added, had done much to wreck the\r\nship. Mr. Gladstone’s own diagnosis was not very different. To his brother\r\nRobertson he wrote (Feb. 6):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    For many years in the House of Commons I have had more fighting\r\n    than any other man. For the last five years I have had it almost\r\n    all, and of it a considerable part has been against those\r\n    “independent” liberals whose characters and talents seem to be\r\n    much more appreciated by the press and general public, than the\r\n    characters and talents of quieter members of the party. I do not\r\n    speak of such men as ——, who leave office or otherwise find\r\n    occasion to vindicate their independence, and vote against us on\r\n    the questions immediately concerned. These men make very little\r\n    noise and get very little applause. But there is another and more\r\n    popular class of independent liberals who have been represented by\r\n    the _Daily News_, and who have been one main cause of the weakness\r\n    of the government, though they (generally) and their organ have\r\n    rallied to us too late during the election. We have never\r\n    recovered from the blow which they helped to strike on the Irish\r\n    Education bill.\r\n\r\n    But more immediately operative causes have determined the\r\n    elections. I have no doubt what is the principal. We have been\r\n    borne down in a torrent of gin and beer. Next to this has been the\r\n    action of the Education Act of 1870, and the subsequent\r\n    controversies. Many of the Roman catholics have voted against us\r\n    because we are not denominational; and many of the dissenters have\r\n    at least abstained from voting because we are. Doubtless there\r\n    have been other minor agencies; but these are the chief ones. The\r\n    effect must be our early removal from office. For me that will be\r\n    a very great change, for I do not intend to assume the general\r\n    functions of leader of the opposition, and my great ambition or\r\n    design will be to spend the remainder of my days, if it please\r\n    God, in tranquillity, and at any rate in freedom from political\r\n    strife.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a short idle attempt was made in the new parliament to raise a debate\r\nupon the date and circumstances of the dissolution, Disraeli used language\r\nrightly called by Mr. Gladstone “generous.” “The right honourable\r\ngentleman’s friends,” he said, “were silent, and I must confess I admire\r\ntheir taste and feeling. If I had been a follower of a parliamentary chief\r\nas eminent, even if I thought he had erred, I should have been disposed\r\nrather to exhibit sympathy than to offer criticism. I should remember the\r\ngreat victories which he had fought and won; I should remember his\r\nillustrious career; its continuous success and splendour, not its\r\naccidental or even disastrous mistakes.”(308)\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nOne word upon the place of this election in our financial history. In\r\n1874, the prosperity of the country and the movement of the revenue gave\r\nan opportunity for repeal of the income-tax. That opportunity never\r\nrecurred. The election of 1874 was the fall of the curtain; the play that\r\nhad begun in 1842 came to its last scene. It marked the decision of the\r\nelectorate that the income-tax—introduced in time of peace by Peel and\r\ncontinued by Mr. Gladstone, for the purpose of simplifying the tariff and\r\nexpanding trade—should be retained for general objects of government and\r\nshould be a permanent element of our finance. It marked at the same time\r\nthe prospect of a new era of indefinitely enlarged expenditure, with the\r\nincome-tax as a main engine for raising ways and means. Whether this\r\ndecision was wise or unwise, we need not here discuss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII. 1874-1880\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. Retirement From Leadership.

The whole cabinet was assembled.\r\n    We resolved after full discussion of pros and cons, and some\r\n    slight difference of opinion, to resign at once. After which came\r\n    the startling announcement that Gladstone would no longer retain\r\n    the leadership of the liberal party, nor resume it, unless the\r\n    party had settled its differences. He will not expose himself to\r\n    the insults and outrages of 1866-8, and he has a keen sense of the\r\n    disloyalty of the party during the last three years. He will sit\r\n    as a private member and occasionally speak for himself, but he\r\n    will not attend the House regularly, nor assume any one of the\r\n    functions of leader. He does this not from anger, but because he\r\n    says that it is absolutely necessary to party action to learn that\r\n    all the duties and responsibilities do not rest on the leaders,\r\n    but that followers have their obligations too. As a consequence of\r\n    this Cardwell retires to the House of Lords. He will not take the\r\n    leadership, nor will he consent to serve under any one but\r\n    Gladstone. He is too old, he says. Lowe protests against the\r\n    anarchical experiment, and talks of Hartington as leader. As\r\n    neither Lowe, nor Bright, nor Goschen, nor Forster is in a\r\n    position to act as leader, it may come to this, so that the\r\n    liberal front benches of the two Houses will be entirely\r\n    remodelled.(309)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is Mr. Gladstone’s own account, written twenty-three years later, and\r\nconfirmed by all other accessible papers of the moment:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I was most anxious to make the retirement of the ministry the\r\n    occasion of my own. I had served for more than forty years. My\r\n    age—65—was greater than that of Sir Robert Peel at his retirement\r\n    in 1846, or at his death in 1850, and was much beyond that at\r\n    which most of the leading commoners of the century had terminated\r\n    their political career, together with their natural life. I felt\r\n    myself to be in some measure out of touch with some of the\r\n    tendencies of the liberal party, especially in religious matters.\r\n    Sir A. Clark, whom I consulted, would give me on medical grounds\r\n    no encouragement whatever. But I deeply desired an interval\r\n    between parliament and the grave. In spite of the solicitations of\r\n    my friends I persisted. For 1874 there was a sort of compromise\r\n    “without prejudice.” As having a title to some rest I was not a\r\n    very regular attendant, but did not formally abdicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M158) He found specific reasons for withdrawal in the state of the party\r\n(Feb. 12):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. The absence of any great positive aim (the late plan [budget]\r\n    having failed) for which to co-operate. 2. The difficulty of\r\n    establishing united and vigorous action in the liberal party for\r\n    the purposes of economy. 3. The unlikelihood of arriving at any\r\n    present agreement respecting education.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another fragment of the same date, he says:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I do not forget that I am in debt to the party generally for\r\n    kindness, indulgence, and confidence, much beyond what I have\r\n    deserved. Deeming myself unable to hold it together from my\r\n    present position in a manner worthy of it, I see how unlikely it\r\n    is that I should hereafter be able to give any material aid in the\r\n    adjustment of its difficulties. Yet if such aid should at any time\r\n    be generally desired with a view to arresting some great evil or\r\n    procuring for the nation some great good, my willingness to enter\r\n    into counsel for the occasion would follow from all I have said.\r\n    But always with the understanding that as between section and\r\n    section I could not become a partisan, and that such interference\r\n    even in the case of its proving useful would entail no obligation\r\n    whatever on those accepting it, and carry with it no disturbance\r\n    of any arrangement subsisting at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation proved, as Lowe had foreseen, an anarchic experiment. Mr.\r\nGladstone went up to London for the session, and followed his ordinary\r\nsocial course:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _March 9, 1874._—Off at 4.45 to Windsor for the fête. We dined at\r\n    St. George’s Hall. I was presented to the Duchess of C. by the\r\n    Queen, and had a few kind words from H.M. 11.—Archbishop Manning,\r\n    9-11. It is kind in him to come, but most of it is rather hollow\r\n    work, limited as we are. 16.—Dined at Marlborough House. A civil\r\n    talk with Disraeli. 20.—Finished _Vivian Grey_. The first quarter\r\n    extremely clever, the rest trash.\r\n\r\n    _May 15._—Emperor of Russia’s reception at 3.15. He thanked me for\r\n    my conduct to Russia while I was minister. I assured his Majesty I\r\n    had watched with profound interest the transactions of his reign,\r\n    and the great benefits he had conferred upon his people. He hoped\r\n    the relations of the two countries would always be good.... Dined\r\n    at Marlborough House. Stafford House ball afterwards. The emperor\r\n    complained of the burden and late hours of evening entertainments.\r\n    Princess of Wales so nice about her picture. D[israeli] complained\r\n    of my absence, said they could not get on without me. 20.—Dined at\r\n    the F.O. to meet the emperor. It was very kind of Derby. Much work\r\n    at Hawarden in arranging books and papers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons is hardly attractive to an irregular and perfunctory\r\nattendant; and Mr. Gladstone’s thoughts all turned to other fields. To\r\nMrs. Gladstone he wrote early in April:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The anti-parliamentary reaction has been stronger with me even\r\n    than I anticipated. I am as far as possible from feeling the want\r\n    of the House of Commons. I could cheerfully go there to do a work;\r\n    but I hope and pray to be as little there as possible, except for\r\n    such an aim. In London I think we were too much hustled to speak\r\n    leisurely or effectually of the future. It will open for us by\r\n    degrees. I shall be glad when the matter of money, after all a\r\n    secondary one, is disentangled, but chiefly because it seems to\r\n    put pressure upon you. I spoke to Stephen about these matters on\r\n    Saturday; he was kind, reasonable, and in all ways as satisfactory\r\n    as possible. There is one thing I should like you to understand\r\n    clearly as to my view of things, for it is an essential part of\r\n    that view. I am convinced that the welfare of mankind does not now\r\n    depend on the state or the world of politics; the real battle is\r\n    being fought in the world of thought, where a deadly attack is\r\n    made with great tenacity of purpose and over a wide field, upon\r\n    the greatest treasure of mankind, the belief in God and the gospel\r\n    of Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn June Sir Stephen Glynne died,—“a dark, dark day.” “My brother-in-law,”\r\nwrote Mr. Gladstone at a later date, “was a man of singular refinement and\r\nas remarkable modesty. His culture was high and his character one of deep\r\ninterest. His memory was on the whole decidedly the most remarkable known\r\nto me of the generation and country. His life, however, was retired and\r\nunobtrusive; but he sat in parliament, I think, for about fifteen years,\r\nand was lord-lieutenant of his county.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    I thank you much—Mr. Gladstone said to the Duke of Argyll—for your\r\n    kind note. Your sympathy and that of the duchess are ever ready.\r\n    But even you can hardly tell how it is on this occasion needed and\r\n    warranted. My wife has lost the last member of a family united by\r\n    bonds of the rarest tenderness, the last representative of his\r\n    line, the best of brothers, who had ever drawn closer to her as\r\n    the little rank was thinned. As for me, no one can know what our\r\n    personal relations were, without knowing the interior details of a\r\n    long family history, and efforts and struggles in common carried\r\n    on through a long series of years, which riveted into the closest\r\n    union our original affection. He was a very rare man, but we\r\n    grieve not for him; he sleeps the sleep of the just. The event is\r\n    a great one also to the outward frame of our life here.(310)\r\n\r\n\r\n(M159) In the same letter he says it is most painful to him to be dragged\r\ninto ecclesiastical turmoil, as for example by the Scotch patronage bill,\r\nwhich he considers precipitate, unwise, and daring, or the bill directed\r\nagainst the endowed schools commissioners, of whom his brother-in-law,\r\nLord Lyttelton, was one. In the last case he acted as a leader of an\r\norganised party, but in the more important instance of a bill devised, as\r\nMr. Disraeli said, to put down ritualism, his dissent from most of those\r\naround him fulfilled all the anticipations that had pointed to retirement.\r\nThe House was heartily in favour of the bill, and what is called the\r\ncountry earnestly supported it, though in the cabinet itself at least four\r\nministers were strenuously hostile. Mr. Gladstone writes to his wife a\r\ntrenchant account of his vigorous dealing with a prominent colleague who\r\nhad rashly ventured to mark him for assault. He sent word to the two\r\narchbishops that if they carried a certain amendment he should hold\r\nhimself “altogether discharged from maintaining any longer the\r\nestablishment of the church.” He wrote to Lord Harrowby when the recess\r\ncame:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I think, or rather I am convinced, that the effect _either_ of one\r\n    or two more ecclesiastical sessions of parliament such as the\r\n    last, or of any prolonged series of contentious proceedings under\r\n    the recent Act, upon subjects of widespread interest, will be to\r\n    disestablish the church. I do not feel the dread of\r\n    disestablishment which you may probably entertain: but I desire\r\n    and seek so long as standing ground remains, to avert, not to\r\n    precipitate it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo another correspondent—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Individually I have serious doubts whether the whole of the penal\r\n    proceedings taken in this country with respect to church matters\r\n    from the day of Dr. Hampden downwards, have not done considerably\r\n    more harm than good. There is no doubt at all that all the evils,\r\n    of whatever kind, at which they were aimed, exist at this moment\r\n    among us in a far more aggravated shape than when they began....\r\n    My object and desire has ever been and still is, to keep the\r\n    church of England together, both as a church and as an\r\n    establishment. As a church, I believe she is strong enough, by\r\n    virtue of the prayer-book, to hold together under all\r\n    circumstances; but as an establishment, in my opinion, she is not\r\n    strong enough to bear either serious secession or prolonged\r\n    parliamentary agitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, in a letter dated from Whittinghame (Nov. 17)—\r\n\r\n\r\n    There are already too many causes of demoralisation operating upon\r\n    the House of Commons. If it is also to become a debased copy of an\r\n    ecclesiastical council, all the worst men and worst qualities of\r\n    the worst men will come to the front, and the place will become\r\n    intolerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven any member of parliament who shares none of Mr. Gladstone’s theology,\r\nmay sympathise to the full with his deep disgust at theologic and\r\necclesiastical discussions as conducted in that secular air. We can easily\r\nunderstand how detestable he found it, and how those discussions fortified\r\nhis sense of estrangement from the ruling sentiments of the parliamentary\r\nparty of which he was still the titular leader.\r\n\r\nOf course the whigs, always for keeping a parliamentary church in its\r\nproper place, disliked his line. Liberals like Thirlwall read his speeches\r\n“with great pain and suspicion,” and declared their confidence to be\r\nshaken. Hardly any section was completely satisfied. His mind in the\r\nautumn and winter of 1874 was absorbed, as we shall see within a few\r\npages, in an assault upon the decrees of the Vatican Council of 1870. This\r\nassault, as he told Lord Granville (Dec. 7, 1874), while tending “to\r\nhearten” the party generally, was against his resumption of formal\r\nleadership, because it widened the breach with the Irishmen in the House\r\nof Commons. Apart from this there were many questions, each with a group\r\nof adherents to a special view, but incapable of being pursued by common\r\nand united action. He ran through the list in writing to Lord Granville.\r\nIt has historic interest:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Extension of the suffrage, with redistribution of seats abreast\r\n    or in the rear. 2. Disestablishment in Scotland, England. 3. Land\r\n    laws. 4. Retrenchment. 5. Colonial policy, territorial extension\r\n    of the empire. 6. Reform of local government taxation. 7. Secular\r\n    education. 8. Undenominational education. 9. Irish affairs. On no\r\n    one of these is there known to exist a plan desired by the entire\r\n    party, or by any clear and decisive majority of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the whole, he was persuaded that neither the party generally nor the\r\ncountry desired another period of active reforms, even if he were fit to\r\nconduct them. Besides this he confessed his “apprehension that differences\r\nwould spring up, and great shrinking from any breach with the party, and a\r\ndetermination, often expressed, never, if he could help it, to lead one\r\nbranch of it against another.” In many forms he carried Lord Granville\r\nwith him round the circle of his arguments. He once sent his points on\r\nhalf-a-dozen scraps of paper. Granville playfully replied, “I should like\r\nto treat them as old Lord Bessborough used to treat his playing-cards when\r\nluck was adverse—tear them up into small bits and toss them in the fire.”\r\nNothing shook him, not even Mrs. Gladstone’s misgivings. To her he wrote\r\nfrom Carlton House Terrace on the eve of the session of 1875:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Now for the grave matter about the leadership. I have had much\r\n    conversation with Granville and Cardwell, and I am going to see\r\n    Hartington, also Goschen, to-morrow. My letter is rewritten and\r\n    improved, but I am obliged to stand to my conclusion, for many\r\n    reasons. Among them the church reason is one of the most serious,\r\n    and the other the undefined and prolonged character of the service\r\n    if now undertaken. This, while arguing and deprecating, they admit\r\n    I think to a great extent. Our old colleagues are inclined to come\r\n    up on Thursday if they can, and this will be rather to hear than\r\n    to debate. Hartington will succeed. I am indeed sorry that you and\r\n    I have not been able to take the same view of this important\r\n    subject, but you know that I am acting on convictions very long\r\n    entertained, and will I am sure believe that I have probed myself\r\n    deeply, and used all the means in my power to get at a right\r\n    conclusion. Nay, I think you will be more reconciled, when I tell\r\n    you that Granville did not really see his way either to a nominal\r\n    leadership, or to making any arrangement by which I could after a\r\n    short time with some certainty have escaped. I saw Clark last\r\n    night and this morning; he gives an excellent account of me and\r\n    makes it impossible for me to plead health as my reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe drama went rapidly forward:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 12._—I find that the agreement made yesterday that I should\r\n    meet my former colleagues on Monday will require me to remain\r\n    until this day, though after a pretty busy morning the pressure is\r\n    less. I have, however, to preside in the evening at the meeting of\r\n    the Metaphysical Society, and to listen, though I hope nothing\r\n    more, to a tough discussion. Manning, I am sorry to say, will be\r\n    there. His pamphlet is at length going to press, and will extend\r\n    he says to 150 pages. Newman is not out yet.\r\n\r\n    _11 Carlton House Terrace, Jan. 14, ’75._—This great affair is\r\n    nearly arranged. My old colleagues all submit under protest; and I\r\n    shall be free. An article in the _Times_ this morning is\r\n    undisguisedly aimed at getting rid of me; but it does not express\r\n    any of their feelings. We have had a morning at Granville’s;\r\n    Halifax, Granville, Cardwell, Hartington, Aberdare, Forster,\r\n    Carlingford, Stansfeld, Selborne, Goschen, Lowe, Kimberley,—in\r\n    short all, I think, except Argyll and Bright. There was argument\r\n    and exhortation, and much kindness. My letter to Granville will be\r\n    accompanied by a short reply from him expressing difference of\r\n    opinion and regret. They are afraid of being blamed by the party\r\n    if they seem to show indifference.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Queen thanked Mr. Gladstone for communicating to her his resolution of\r\nretiring from the more active duties of parliamentary life. She was not\r\nentirely unprepared for it after what he told her himself last year. “She\r\nknows that his zeal and untiring energy have always been exerted with the\r\ndesire of advancing the welfare of the nation and maintaining the honour\r\nof the crown, and she thanks him for his loyal assurances of support on\r\nall occasions when it may become necessary.”\r\n\r\n(M160) The Duke of Argyll wrote “sincerely to congratulate” him upon his\r\nwithdrawal. Bright on the other hand (Jan. 17) said he could not applaud,\r\nyet he would not blame: Mr. Gladstone’s course seemed so unfortunate if\r\nnot disastrous to the great public interests committed to him:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    For myself, says Bright, if I could have foreseen either the\r\n    result of the election of last year, or your retirement from the\r\n    conduct of the party, I should certainly have withdrawn from\r\n    parliament, where now I seem to have quite as little of duty or of\r\n    a mission as you have. The front opposition bench is full of\r\n    discord, and when you are not there full of jealousy, and I find\r\n    myself without any particular attraction to any particular part of\r\n    the House. However, I will not complain; some door of escape may\r\n    open for me, and I can become a spectator as you are proposing to\r\n    be.\r\n\r\n    I hope on some occasion I may have the chance of seeing you when\r\n    you come to town. I have had so much pleasure in your friendship,\r\n    and have gained so much from it, that I would fain hope it need\r\n    not cease now, when our association will necessarily be less\r\n    frequent than it has been of late years. Whether you come back to\r\n    the political field or turn wholly to study and to literature, I\r\n    am sure you will be usefully employed, and I hope that nothing but\r\n    blessing may rest upon all your labours.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe feeling among liberals in the country was of deep dismay. Some of the\r\nwhigs doubtless found solace in the anticipation that a new middle party\r\nmight be formed, with “a recovery of the old liberal position demolished\r\nfor the time by John Mill, Gladstone, and Cobden.”(311) But this was\r\nlimited to a narrow circle. “All sunshine is gone out of politics,” was a\r\ngeneral phrase. The news was compared by one correspondent to Gelon’s\r\nmessage to the Greeks, that the spring was taken out of their year.(312)\r\n\r\nAn organ of the stiff nonconformists said,(313) “Against his government we\r\nfelt that we had a great grievance; for himself, the nonconformists of\r\nthis country have long cherished a loyalty more fervent, we are inclined\r\nto imagine, than that with which he has been regarded by any other section\r\nof the community. He, beyond all other modern statesmen, with perhaps here\r\nand there a doubtful exception, gave us the impression of a man who\r\nregarded politics as a part of Christian duty.” And the same writers most\r\ntruly added, “We do not know what the English people have done for Mr.\r\nGladstone that can be compared for a moment with what Mr. Gladstone has\r\ndone for them. Claims on him we have none. He has far more than discharged\r\nany debt that he could have owed to the nation.” These words are a just\r\nremonstrance against the somewhat tyrannical conventions of English public\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhen the session began, he wrote to Mrs. Gladstone (Feb. 15): “I came down\r\nto the House and took my seat nearly in the same spot as last year,\r\nfinding Bright my neighbour, with which I was very well pleased. Granville\r\nand Hartington both much preferred my continuing _on_ the front bench to\r\nmy going elsewhere.” Lord Hartington, strongly encouraged against his own\r\ninclinations by Mr. Gladstone, accepted a thankless and unpromising post,\r\nand held it with honour and credit for five difficult years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. Vaticanism. (1874-1875)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Let no susceptibilities, puritan, protestant, anglican, or other,\r\n    be startled if we observe that Rome is, and may long be, in some\r\n    important respects, the centre of the Christian world. It is\r\n    indeed a centre which repels as well as attracts; which probably\r\n    repels even more than it attracts; but which, whether repelling or\r\n    attracting, influences.—-GLADSTONE (1875).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nOne question, as the reader by this time well knows, living deepest in Mr.\r\nGladstone’s heart and mind from his first book in 1838 onwards, was the\r\nrelation of the churches to modern society. English statesmen are wont to\r\nbe either blind to the existence of such a question, or else they seek an\r\neasy refuge from it in a perfunctory erastianism, sometimes intellectually\r\nrefined, sometimes a little brutish, but always shallow. In all the three\r\ngreat branches of Christianity, the Latin, the Greek or orthodox, the\r\nprotestant, Mr. Gladstone’s interest was incessant, sincere, and profound.\r\nIt covered their theology, their organisation, their history and\r\nprinciples of growth, the bearings of their system upon individual\r\ncharacter and social well-being all over Europe. He was one of the very\r\nfew public men capable of discerning that the fall of the temporal power\r\nof the pope marked a more startling change and a profounder crisis in\r\nhuman history, than the unification of Italy, the unification of Germany,\r\nthe reconstructed republic in France, perhaps even than the preservation\r\nof the American union. He knew the force of ideas in the world; he\r\nrealised the vast transformations that had in their succession swept over\r\nthe minds of men since cardinal dogmas had been established; he\r\ncomprehended the motion in articles of faith, as men made their “voyagings\r\nthrough strange seas of thought”; he was alive to the fact that moral\r\ncrises brought on by change in intellectual outlook and temperature, are\r\nof deeper concern than questions of territory, or dynasty, or form of\r\ngovernment. The moral crisis is what reaches furthest and matters most. A\r\nmovement of the first magnitude was accentuated by Pius IX., when by the\r\nSyllabus of 1864 he challenged modern society in all its foundations, its\r\naims, its principles, in the whole range of its ideals. Some called this\r\ndaring ultimatum the gravest event since the French uprising in 1789. The\r\nSyllabus prepared the way for a more elaborately organised operation on\r\nbehalf of papal authority. The train was secretly laid for a grand\r\nreaction, a grand re-installation of the Christian faith.(314)\r\n\r\n(M161) The pope had been despoiled of territory, his sway within the walls\r\nof Rome itself was in constant danger, his most powerful protector north\r\nof the Alps had been weakened and humiliated by protestant Prussia. He was\r\nnow to be compensated for his calamities by a majestic demonstration of\r\nhis hold upon the spiritual allegiance of millions of adherents in every\r\nportion of the habitable globe. The twentieth ecumenical council assembled\r\nin St. Peter’s at Rome on December 8, 1869. In this gathering of catholic\r\nprelates from both hemispheres, two antagonistic schools confronted one\r\nanother. The ultramontanes held that the revolutionary welter and\r\nconfusion of the modern world could only be healed by solemn affirmation\r\nof the principle of sovereign authority lodged in an infallible pope, with\r\nabsolute power to define by that apostolic authority what ought to be held\r\nas articles of faith or morals. The assumptions, the standards, the ruling\r\ntypes of the modern age, they boldly encountered with rigid iteration of\r\nmaxims of old time, imposing obedience and submission to a fixed social\r\norder and a divinely commissioned hierarchy. Inflexibility was to be the\r\nsingle watchword by which the church could recover a world that, from\r\nNaples even to Mexico, seemed to be rapidly drifting away from her. The\r\nopposing school took other ground. Perhaps they saw that supremacy is one\r\nthing, and infallibility another thing quite different. The liberal\r\ncatholics did not contest the dogma of papal infallibility; they\r\nquestioned the expediency of its proclamation; they were for associating\r\nideas of religion with ideas of liberty; they were not for extending the\r\ndomain of miracle and the supernatural.\r\n\r\nThen as in the old historic councils, influence of race and nation had\r\ndecisive effects. It could not be otherwise in what was in essence a\r\nconflict between a centralised doctrinal authority on the one hand, and\r\nthe inextinguishable tendency towards national churches on the other. The\r\nItalian bishops went with the pope. The Germans, as of old they had been\r\nfor emperor against priest, were now on the side of freedom against what\r\ncertain of them did not hesitate to call tyranny and fraud. Some of the\r\nablest of the French were true to Gallican tradition and resisted the\r\ndecree. Among the most active and uncompromising of all the ultramontane\r\nparty was our English Manning.(315)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of November 1869, Acton had written to Mr. Gladstone from Rome.\r\n“Your letter is a very sad one,” Mr. Gladstone answered. “I feel as deep\r\nand real an interest in the affairs of other Christian communions as in my\r\nown; and most of all in the case of the most famous of them all, and the\r\none within which the largest number of Christian souls find their\r\nspiritual food.” Before Manning left for Rome, an amiable correspondence\r\ntook place between Mr. Gladstone and him. “How sad it is for us both”—this\r\nwas Mr. Gladstone’s starting-point—“considering our personal relations,\r\nthat we should now be in this predicament, that the things which the one\r\nlooks to as the salvation of faith and church, the other regards as their\r\ndestruction.”\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Odo Russell, now the informal agent of the British government in\r\nRome, the prime minister wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is curious that Manning has so greatly changed his character.\r\n    When he was archdeacon with us, all his strength was thought to\r\n    lie in a governing faculty, and in its wise moderation. Now he is\r\n    ever quoted as the _ultra_ of ultras, and he seems greatly to have\r\n    overshot his mark. The odds seem to be that the child yet unborn\r\n    will rue the calling of this council. For if the best result\r\n    arrive in the triumph of the fallibilitarians, will not even this\r\n    be a considerable shock to the credit and working efficacy of the\r\n    papal system? You must really be _all_ eyes and ears, a very Argus\r\n    in both organs, until the occasion has gone by.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the issue of the council, Acton, having Mr. Odo Russell in\r\nagreement with him, from the first conveyed to Mr. Gladstone his opinion\r\nthat the pope would prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The only hope in my mind, said Mr. Gladstone in reply, is that\r\n    there may be a real minority, and that it may speak plainly. A few\r\n    bold men would easily insure themselves a noble immortality. But\r\n    will _any_ have the courage? The Italian government have one and\r\n    only one method in their hands of fighting the pope: and that is\r\n    to run, against nomination from Rome, the old and more popular\r\n    methods of choosing bishops by clerical election, with the\r\n    _approbation of the flock_.(316) Unless they resort to this they\r\n    can do nothing.\r\n\r\n    All the accounts from Rome, he tells Lacaita (Jan. 2, 1870), are\r\n    as bad as possible. For the first time in my life, I shall now be\r\n    obliged to talk about popery; for it would be a scandal to call\r\n    the religion they are manufacturing at Rome by the same name as\r\n    that of Pascal, or of Bossuet, or of Ganganelli. The truth is that\r\n    ultramontanism is an anti-social power, and never has it more\r\n    undisguisedly assumed that character than in the Syllabus.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M162) The French government wrote despatches of mild protest but said\r\nnothing of withdrawing their garrison. Mr. Gladstone and Lord Clarendon\r\nwere for informing the Roman court that they were cognizant of the French\r\ndespatches, and approved of their tenour. The Queen and the cabinet,\r\nhowever, were entirely averse to meddling with the council, and nothing\r\nwas done officially. This did not prevent Mr. Gladstone from telling\r\nArchbishop Manning what impediments would be placed in the way of Irish\r\nlegislation by the state of English feeling as to the Syllabus and other\r\npapal proceedings. “_My_ feelings and convictions,” he says (April 16),\r\n“are as you well know decidedly with your ‘opposition,’ which I believe to\r\nbe contending for the religious and civil interests of mankind against\r\ninfluences highly disastrous and menacing to both. But the prevailing\r\nopinion is that it is better to let those influences take their course,\r\nand work out the damage which they will naturally and surely entail upon\r\nthe see of Rome and upon what is bound to it.” In parliament there was an\r\nutter aversion to the Roman policy, and he gives instances, noting even a\r\nchange of opinion about the Irish land bill. “What I have described is no\r\nmatter of speculation. I know it by actual and daily touch. I am glad you\r\nhave moved me to state it in some detail. It is to me matter of profound\r\ngrief, especially as regards land in Ireland.”\r\n\r\nTo Lord Acton:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of all the prelates at Rome, none have a finer opportunity, to\r\n    none is a more crucial test now applied, than to those of the\r\n    United States. For if there, where there is nothing of covenant,\r\n    of restraint, or of equivalent between the church and the state,\r\n    the propositions of the Syllabus are still to have the countenance\r\n    of the episcopate, it becomes really a little difficult to\r\n    maintain in argument the civil rights of such persons to\r\n    toleration, however conclusive be the argument of policy in favour\r\n    of granting it. I can hardly bring myself to speculate or care on\r\n    what particular day the foregone conclusion is to be finally\r\n    adopted. My grief is sincere and deep, but it is at the whole\r\n    thing, so ruinous in its consequences as they concern faith. In my\r\n    view, the size of the minority, though important, is not nearly so\r\n    important as the question whether there will be a minority at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a minority. In a division taken at a late stage, 451 composed\r\nthe majority, 88 resisted, and 62 were for a new examination. Then the\r\nminority turned their backs on Rome; and on July 18 the definition of\r\ninfallibility was acclaimed in St. Peter’s in presence of the pope by 533\r\nagainst 2.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone is very glad when Clarendon instructs Mr. Russell to turn\r\nhis back on the festivities at Rome. “The whole proceeding has been\r\nmonstrous, and it will hereafter become one of the laughing-stocks of\r\nhistory. The fanaticism of the middle ages is really sober compared with\r\nthat of the nineteenth century.” “The proclamation of Infallibility,” he\r\nsaid to Bishop Moriarty, “I must own I look upon as the most portentous\r\n(taking them singly), of all events in the history of the Christian\r\nchurch.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, as we know, war was declared by France against Germany, the\r\nFrench garrison left Rome, and on September 20 the Italians marched in.\r\n\r\nA month before the war broke out, Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord Clarendon:\r\n“I would avoid any official support of the Italian application to France\r\nfor the evacuation of Rome, by saying that this country had always\r\nabstained from mixing in that question; and that we were the more induced\r\nto persevere in that policy from being well convinced that the French\r\ngovernment is perfectly aware that in this country the occupation of any\r\npart of the pontifical territories by French troops is regarded with\r\nregret, pain, and disapproval. Further, that those who most strongly\r\nentertain these sentiments, are generally the persons who most highly\r\nvalue, and have most striven to promote, the good understanding between\r\nFrance and England.”\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Rome by the Italian government brought upon Mr.\r\nGladstone various demands and movements from different parts of the\r\ncountry. His cabinet agreed that the proper course was to decline all\r\ninterference with a view to the restoration of the temporal power, though\r\nthey accepted the task of promoting, by means of friendly representations,\r\narrangements to secure the pontiff’s freedom and becoming support. Then\r\nsome of his presbyterian friends asked him why he should even do so much\r\nas this, when he would take no such steps for the moderator of the free\r\nchurch. Now consider, Mr. Gladstone replied: “the pope is a sovereign who\r\nwas in lawful possession of large revenues, and who had charged himself\r\nwith the support of a body of cardinals, ministers, nuncios, servants, and\r\nguards out of those revenues. He has been dispossessed, not for any fault\r\nof his own, but because clerical dominion was deemed intolerable. In the\r\nmaintenance of the pope and his court, followers and agents, six millions\r\nof our fellow-subjects or thereabouts are deeply interested; and they are\r\nmaking demands upon us which we are forced to decline. But I should for\r\none be ashamed to deny that there are the strongest equitable claims upon\r\nthe Italian government growing out of the past state of things; that in\r\nthese equitable claims the six millions I speak of have a real interest\r\nand share; and as the matter is international, and they have no _locus\r\nstandi_ with the Italian government, it is our part so far to plead their\r\ncause if need be.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M163) Four years elapsed before Mr. Gladstone was in a position to follow\r\nup his strong opinions on the injury done, as he believed, to human\r\nliberty by the Vatican decrees. But the great debate between ultramontanes\r\nand old catholics was followed by him with an interest that never\r\nslackened. In September 1874 he went to Munich, and we can hardly be wrong\r\nin ascribing to that visit the famous tract which was to make so lively a\r\nstir before the end of the year. His principal object was to communicate\r\nwith Dr. Döllinger, and this object, he tells Mrs. Gladstone, was fully\r\ngained. “I think,” he says, “I have spent two-thirds of my whole time with\r\nDr. Döllinger, who is indeed a most remarkable man, and it makes my blood\r\nrun cold to think of _his_ being excommunicated in his venerable but,\r\nthank God, hale and strong old age. In conversation we have covered a wide\r\nfield. I know no one with whose mode of viewing and handling religious\r\nmatters I more cordially agree.... He is wonderful, and simple as a\r\nchild.”\r\n\r\n“I think it was in 1874,” Döllinger afterwards mentioned, “that I remember\r\nGladstone’s paying me a visit at six o’clock in the evening. We began\r\ntalking on political and theological subjects, and became, both of us, so\r\nengrossed with the conversation, that it was two o’clock at night when I\r\nleft the room to fetch a book from my library bearing on the matter in\r\nhand. I returned with it in a few minutes, and found him deep in a volume\r\nhe had drawn out of his pocket—true to his principle of never losing\r\ntime—during my momentary absence.”(317) “In the course of a walk out of\r\nMunich in the travelling season of 1874,” Mr. Gladstone wrote sixteen\r\nyears later, “Dr. Döllinger told me that he was engaged in the work of\r\nretrial through the whole circle of his Latin teaching and knowledge. The\r\nresults were tested in his proceedings at Bonn, when he attempted to\r\nestablish a _formula concordiae_ upon the questions which most gravely\r\ndivided Christendom.”(318) Among other topics Mr. Gladstone commended to\r\nhis mentor the idea of a republication in a series, of the best works of\r\nthose whom he would call the Henotic or Eirenic writers on the differences\r\nthat separate Christians and churches from one another. He also read\r\nPichler on the theology of Leibnitz, not without suspicion that it was\r\nrather Pichler than Leibnitz. But neither Leibnitz nor Pichler was really\r\nin his mind.\r\n\r\nAfter the session of 1874, when the public ear and mind had been possessed\r\nby the word Ritualism, he had as usual sought a vent in a magazine article\r\nfor the thoughts with which he was teeming.(319) He speaks with some\r\ndisdain of the question whether a handful of the clergy are or are not\r\nengaged in “an utterly hopeless and visionary effort to Romanise the\r\nchurch and people of England.” At no time, he says, since the sanguinary\r\nreign of Mary has such a scheme been possible. Least of all, he proceeds,\r\ncould the scheme have life in it “when Rome has substituted for the proud\r\nboast of _semper eadem_ a policy of violence and change in faith; when she\r\nhas refurbished and paraded anew every rusty tool she was fondly thought\r\nto have disused; when no one can become her convert, without renouncing\r\nhis moral and mental freedom, and placing his civil loyalty and duty at\r\nthe mercy of another; and when she has equally repudiated modern thought\r\nand ancient history.” If these strong words expressed his state of mind\r\nbefore he went abroad, we may readily imagine how the Bavarian air would\r\nfan the flame.\r\n\r\nThough Dr. Döllinger himself—“so inaccessible to religious passions”—was\r\nnot aware of the purpose of his English friend, there can be little doubt\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone returned from Munich with the same degree of internal\r\nferment as that which had possessed his mind on his return from Naples\r\nthree-and-twenty years before. In October he writes to Lord Acton from\r\nHawarden:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    What you have said on the subject of ultramontanism and of the\r\n    mode in which it should be handled, appears to me to be as wise\r\n    and as good as is possible. It is really a case for hitting hard,\r\n    but for hitting the right men. In anything I say or do on the\r\n    subject, I would wish heartily and simply to conform to the spirit\r\n    of your words. But I feel myself drawn onwards. Indeed some of\r\n    your words help to draw me. The question with me now is whether I\r\n    shall or shall not publish a tract which I have written, and of\r\n    which the title would probably be, “The Vatican Decrees in their\r\n    bearing on Civil Allegiance: a Political Expostulation.” I incline\r\n    to think that I ought to publish it. If it were in your power and\r\n    will to run over here for a night or two I should seek to profit\r\n    by your counsel, and should ask you to read as much of the MS. as\r\n    your patience would endure. A more substantial attraction would be\r\n    that I could go over much of my long and interesting conversations\r\n    with Döllinger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M164) The pamphlet(320) appeared in November, and was meant for an\r\nargument that the decree of infallibility aimed a deadly blow at the old\r\nhistoric, scientific, and moderate school; it was a degradation of the\r\nepiscopal order; it carried to its furthest point that spirit of\r\nabsolutist centralisation, which in its excesses is as fatal to vigorous\r\nlife in the church, as in the state; it overthrew the principle not even\r\ndenied by the council of Trent in the sixteenth century, that the pope and\r\nhis judgments were triable by the assembled representatives of the\r\nChristian world.\r\n\r\nThrice in history it seemed as if the constitutional party in the church\r\nwas about to triumph: at the council of Constance in the fifteenth\r\ncentury; in the conflict between the French episcopate and Innocent XI. in\r\nthe days of Bossuet; and thirdly, when Clement XIV., exactly a hundred\r\nyears before now, dealt with the Jesuits and “levelled in the dust the\r\ndeadliest foes that mental and moral liberty have ever known.” From July\r\n1870 all this had passed away, and the constitutional party had seen its\r\ndeath-warrant signed and sealed. The “myrmidons of the apostolic chamber”\r\nhad committed their church to revolutionary measures. The vast new claims\r\nwere lodged in the reign of a pontiff, who by the dark Syllabus of 1864\r\nhad condemned free speech, a free press, liberty of conscience, toleration\r\nof nonconformity, the free study of civil and philosophic things\r\nindependently of church authority, marriage unless sacramentally\r\ncontracted, and all definition by the state of the civil rights of the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n(M165) “It has been a favourite purpose of my life,” Mr. Gladstone said,\r\n“not to conjure up, but to conjure down, public alarms. I am not now going\r\nto pretend that either foreign foe or domestic treason can, at the bidding\r\nof the court of Rome, disturb these peaceful shores. But although such\r\nfears may be visionary, it is more visionary still to suppose for one\r\nmoment that the claims of Gregory VII., of Innocent III., and of Boniface\r\nVIII. have been disinterred in the nineteenth century, like hideous\r\nmummies picked out of Egyptian sarcophagi, in the interests of archæology,\r\nor without a definite and practical aim.” What, then, was the clear and\r\nforegone purpose behind the parade of all these astonishing reassertions?\r\nThe first was—by claims to infallibility in creed, to the prerogative of\r\nmiracles, to dominion over the unseen world—to satisfy spiritual\r\nappetites, sharpened into reaction and made morbid by “the levity of the\r\ndestructive speculations so widely current, and the notable hardihood of\r\nthe anti-Christian writing of the day.” This alone, however, would not\r\nexplain the deliberate provocation of all the “risks of so daring a raid\r\nupon the civil sphere.” The answer was to be found in the favourite\r\ndesign, hardly a secret design, of restoring by the road of force when any\r\nfavourable opportunity should arise, and of re-erecting, the terrestrial\r\nthrone of the popedom, “even if it could only be re-erected on the ashes\r\nof the city, and amidst the whitening bones of the people.”\r\n\r\nAnd this brings the writer to the immediate practical aspects of his\r\ntract. “If the baleful power which is expressed by the phrase _Curia\r\nRomana_, and not at all adequately rendered in its historic force by the\r\nusual English equivalent ‘Court of Rome,’ really entertains the scheme, it\r\ndoubtless counts on the support in every country of an organised and\r\ndevoted party; which, when it can command the scales of political power,\r\nwill promote interference, and while it is in a minority, will work for\r\nsecuring neutrality. As the peace of Europe may be in jeopardy, and as the\r\nduties even of England, as one of its constabulary authorities, might come\r\nto be in question, it would be most interesting to know the mental\r\nattitude of our Roman catholic fellow-countrymen in England and Ireland\r\nwith reference to the subject; and it seems to be one on which we are\r\nentitled to solicit information.” Too commonly the spirit of the convert\r\nwas to be expressed by the notorious words, “a catholic first, an\r\nEnglishman afterwards”—words that properly convey no more than a truism,\r\n“for every Christian must seek to place his religion even before his\r\ncountry in his inner heart; but very far from a truism in the sense in\r\nwhich we have been led to construe them.” This, indeed, was a new and very\r\nreal “papal aggression.” For himself, Mr. Gladstone said, it should not\r\nshake his allegiance to “the rule of maintaining equal civil rights\r\nirrespectively of religious differences.” Had he not given conclusive\r\nindications of that view, by supporting in parliament as a minister since\r\nthe council, the repeal in 1871 of the law against ecclesiastical titles,\r\nwhose enactment he had opposed twenty years before?\r\n\r\nThat the pamphlet should create intense excitement, was inevitable from\r\nthe place of the writer in the public eye, from the extraordinary\r\nvehemence of the attack, and above all from the unquenchable fascination\r\nof the topic. Whether the excitement in the country was more than\r\nsuperficial; whether most readers fathomed the deep issues as they stood,\r\nnot between catholic and protestant, but between catholic and catholic\r\nwithin the fold; whether in fastening upon the civil allegiance of English\r\nRomanists Mr. Gladstone took the true point against Vaticanism—these are\r\nquestions that we need not here discuss. The central proposition made a\r\ncruel dilemma for a large class of the subjects of the Queen; for the\r\nchoice assigned to them by assuming stringent logic was between being bad\r\ncitizens if they submitted to the decree of papal infallibility, and bad\r\ncatholics if they did not. Protestant logicians wrote to Mr. Gladstone\r\nthat if his contention were good, we ought now to repeal catholic\r\nemancipation and again clap on the fetters. Syllogisms in action are but\r\nstupid things after all, unless they are checked by a tincture of what\r\nseems paradox.(321) Apart from the particular issue in his Vatican\r\npamphlet, Mr. Gladstone believed himself to be but following his own main\r\ntrack in life and thought in his assault upon “a policy which declines to\r\nacknowledge the high place assigned to liberty in the counsels of\r\nProvidence, and which upon the pretext of the abuse that like every other\r\ngood she suffers, expels her from its system.”\r\n\r\nAmong the names that he was never willing to discuss with me—Machiavelli,\r\nfor instance—was Joseph de Maistre, the hardiest, most adventurous, most\r\ningenious, and incisive of all the speculative champions of European\r\nreaction.(322) In the pages of de Maistre he might have found the reasoned\r\nbase on which the ultramontane creed may be supposed to rest. He would\r\nhave found liberty depicted less as a blessing than a scourge; even\r\nBossuet denounced as a heretic with dubious chances of salvation, for his\r\nstruggle on behalf of a national church against Roman centralisation; the\r\nold Greeks held up to odium as a race of talkers, frivolous, light, and\r\nborn incorrigible dividers. In dealing with de Maistre, Mr. Gladstone\r\nwould have had a foeman worthier of his powerful steel than the authors of\r\nthe Syllabus, Schema, Postulatum, and all the rest of what he called the\r\nVaticanism of 1870. But here, as always, he was man of action, and wrote\r\nfor a specific though perhaps a fugitive purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\n(M166) At the end of the year the total number printed of the tract was\r\n145,000, and of these 120,000 were in a people’s edition. “My pamphlet,”\r\nhe tells Lacaita, “has brought upon me such a mass of work as I can hardly\r\ncope with, and I am compelled to do all things as succinctly as possible,\r\nthough my work is with little intermission from morning till night. I\r\nagree with you that the pamphlet in the main tells its own story; and I am\r\nglad there is no need to select in a hurry some one to write on the\r\ndifference between papism and Catholicism.... There is no doubt that the\r\ndiscussion opens, _i.e._ makes a breach in the walls of the papal\r\ntheology, and it ought to be turned to account. But I shall have enough to\r\ndo with all my hands, if I am to work properly through the task I have\r\nundertaken. Not, I trust, for long, for I think another pamphlet should\r\nsuffice to end it on my side. But I am vexed that Manning (as if he had\r\nbeen pulled up at Rome), after having announced his formal reply six weeks\r\nago, hangs fire and now talks of delaying it.” The result, he assures Lord\r\nGranville (Nov. 25), “must be injurious to the pestilent opinions that\r\nhave so grievously obtained the upper hand in that church, and to the\r\nparty which _means_ to have a war in Europe for the restoration of the\r\ntemporal power. To place impediments in their way has been my principal\r\npurpose.”\r\n\r\nHe told Acton (Dec. 18), “When you were putting in caveats and warnings,\r\nyou did not say to me, ‘Now mind, this affair will absorb some, perhaps\r\nmany, months of your life.’ It has been so up to the present moment, and\r\nit evidently will be so for some time.” With Acton he carried on elaborate\r\ncorrespondence upon some of the questions raised by the Syllabus, notably\r\non the effect of the pope’s disciplinary judgment on anglican marriages,\r\nconverting them into relations that were not marriage at all. He fears\r\nthat he has conceded too much to the papal party in not treating the\r\nSyllabus as _ex cathedra_; in allowing that the popes had been apt to\r\nclaim dogmatic infallibility for wellnigh a thousand years; as to the\r\necumenicity of the Vatican council. Among other matters he was reading\r\n“the curious volumes of _Discorsi di Pio IX._, published at Rome, and he\r\nmight find it his duty to write collaterally upon them.” This duty he\r\nperformed with much fidelity in the _Quarterly Review_ for January 1875.\r\nHe is active in interest about translations; keen to enlist auxiliaries in\r\nevery camp and all countries; delighted with all utterances from Italy or\r\nelsewhere that make in his direction, even noting with satisfaction that\r\nthe agnostic Huxley was warm in approval. “I pass my days and nights,” he\r\ntells the Duke of Argyll (Dec. 19), “in the Vatican. Already the pope has\r\ngiven me two months of incessant correspondence and other hard work, and\r\nit may very well last two more. Nor is this work pleasant; but I am as far\r\nas possible from repenting of it, as no one else to whom the public would\r\nlisten saved me the trouble. It is full of intense interest. Every post\r\nbrings a mass of general reading, writing, or both. Forty covers of one\r\nkind or another to-day, and all my time is absorbed. But the subject is\r\nwell worth the pains.” The Italians, Lord Granville told him, “generally\r\napproved, but were puzzled why you should have thought it necessary.”\r\nRetorts and replies arose in swarms, including one from Manning and\r\nanother from Newman. He was accused by some of introducing a Bismarckian\r\n_Kulturkampf_ into England, of seeking to recover his lost popularity by\r\npandering to no-popery, of disregarding the best interests of the country\r\nfor the sake of his own restoration to power.(323)\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have now finished reading—he said at the beginning of\r\n    February—the 20th reply to my pamphlet, They cover 1000 pages. And\r\n    I am hard at work preparing mine with a good conscience and I\r\n    think a good argument. Manning has been, I think, as civil as he\r\n    could. _Feb. 5._—All this morning I have had to spend in hunting\r\n    up one important statement of Manning’s which I am almost\r\n    convinced is a gross mis-statement.... _Feb. 6._—Manning in his\r\n    200 pages has not, I venture to say, made a single point against\r\n    me. But I shall have to show up his quotations very seriously. We\r\n    have exchanged one or two friendly notes. 8.—Worked on Vaticanism\r\n    nearly all day and (an exception to my rule) late at night.\r\n    14.—Eight hours’ work on my proof sheets. 15.—Went through Acton’s\r\n    corrections and notes on my proofs. 19.—Worked much in evening on\r\n    finishing up my tract, Dr. Döllinger’s final criticisms having\r\n    arrived. He thinks highly of the work, which he observes will cut\r\n    deeper than the former one, and be more difficult to deal with. By\r\n    midnight I had the revises ready with the corrections.\r\n    20.—Inserted one or two references and wrote “Press” on the 2nd\r\n    revises. May the power and blessing of God go with the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second tract was more pungent than the first, and it gave pleasure to\r\nan important minister abroad who had now entangled himself by Falk laws\r\nand otherwise in a quarrel with the papacy. “I have had a letter of\r\nthanks,” Mr. Gladstone writes to Hawarden (March 6), “from Bismarck. This\r\npamphlet is stouter, sharper, and cheaper than the last, but is only in\r\nits eleventh thousand, I believe.” Among others who replied to\r\n_Vaticanism_ was Dr. Newman; he appended a new postscript of\r\nfour-and-twenty pages to his former answer to the first of Mr. Gladstone’s\r\npamphlets. Its tone is courteous and argumentative—far too much so to\r\nplease the ultras who had the pope’s ear—and without the wild hitting that\r\nMr. Gladstone found in Manning.\r\n\r\nNewman wrote to thank him (Jan. 17, 1875) for a letter that he described\r\nas “forbearing and generous.” “It has been a great grief to me,” said\r\nNewman, “to have had to write against one whose career I have followed\r\nfrom first to last with so much (I may say) loyal interest and admiration.\r\nI had known about you from others, and had looked at you with kindly\r\ncuriosity, before you came up to Christ Church, and from the time that you\r\nwere launched into public life, you have retained a hold on my thoughts\r\nand on my gratitude by the various marks of attention which every now and\r\nthen you have shown me, when you had an opportunity, and I could not fancy\r\nmy ever standing towards you in any other relation than that which had\r\nlasted so long. What a fate it is, that now when so memorable a career has\r\nreached its formal termination [retirement from leadership], I should be\r\nthe man, on the very day on which it closed, to present to you amid the\r\nmany expressions of public sympathy which it elicits, a controversial\r\npamphlet as my offering.” But he could not help writing it, he was called\r\nupon from such various quarters; and his conscience told him that he who\r\nhad been in great measure the cause of so many becoming catholics, had no\r\nright to leave them in the lurch, when charges were made against them as\r\nserious as unexpected. “I do not think,” he concluded, “I ever can be\r\nsorry for what I have done, but I never can cease to be sorry for the\r\nnecessity of doing it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M167) This fierce controversial episode was enough to show that the habit\r\nand temperament of action still followed him in the midst of all his\r\npurposes of retreat. Withdrawal from parliamentary leadership was\r\naccompanied by other steps, apparently all making in the same direction.\r\nHe sold the house in Carlton House Terrace, where he had passed\r\neight-and-twenty years of work and power and varied sociability. “I had\r\ngrown to the house,” he says (April 15), “having lived more time in it\r\nthan in any other since I was born, and mainly by reason of all that was\r\ndone in it.” To Mrs. Gladstone he wrote (Feb. 28):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I do not wonder that you feel parting from the house will be a\r\n    blow and a pang. It is nothing less than this to me, but it must\r\n    be faced and you will face it gallantly. So much has occurred\r\n    there; and thus it is leaving not the house only but the\r\n    neighbourhood, where I have been with you for more than\r\n    thirty-five years, and altogether nearly forty. The truth is that\r\n    innocently and from special causes we have on the whole been\r\n    housed better than according to our circumstances. All along\r\n    Carlton House Terrace I think you would not find any one with less\r\n    than £20,000 a year, and most of them with, much more.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe sold his collection of china and his Wedgwood ware.(324) He despatched\r\nhis books to Hawarden. He can hardly have resolved on retirement that\r\nshould be effective and complete, or else he must have arranged to quit\r\nthe House of Commons. In his diary he entered (March 30, 1875):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Views about the future and remaining section of my life. In\r\n    outline they are undefined but in substance definite. The main\r\n    point is this: that setting aside exceptional circumstances which\r\n    would have to provide for themselves, my prospective work is not\r\n    parliamentary. My ties will be slight to an assembly with whose\r\n    tendencies I am little in harmony at the present time; nor can I\r\n    flatter myself that what is called the public out of doors is more\r\n    sympathetic. But there is much to be done with the pen, all\r\n    bearing much on high and sacred ends, for even Homeric study as I\r\n    view it, is in this very sense of high importance; and what lies\r\n    beyond this is concerned directly with the great subject of\r\n    belief.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Gladstone he wrote (May 19, 1875): “I am feeling as it were my way\r\ntowards the purposes of the rest of my life. It will I dare say clear by\r\ndegrees. For the general business of the country, my ideas and temper are\r\nthoroughly out of harmony with the ideas and temper of the day, especially\r\nas they are represented in London.”\r\n\r\nThe movement of negation had been in full swing for a dozen years before\r\nthe force and weight of it had, amid the stress and absorption of daily\r\nbusiness, reached his inner mind. In May 1872, in a speech as member of\r\nthe council of King’s College—“averse from, and little used to platform\r\nspeaking,” as he described himself to Manning—he used some strong language\r\nabout those who promulgate as science what is not science and as religion\r\nwhat is not religion; but he took care to sever himself from the recent\r\nRoman decrees, which “seemed much to resemble the proclamation of a\r\nperpetual war against the progress and the movement of the human\r\nmind.”(325) In December 1872, he caused a marked sensation by an address\r\nat Liverpool, in which he spoke of Strauss’s book on _New and Old\r\nBelief_.(326) He had become a member of the metaphysical society, where\r\neminent representatives of every faith and of no faith discussed every\r\naspect of the foundations of human creeds. He was of too masculine and\r\nenergetic a cast of mind to feel mere shock as he listened to Huxley,\r\nTyndall, Clifford, Harrison, firmly arguing materialism or positivism or\r\nagnosticism or other unhistoric forms. That his whole soul was\r\nenergetically oppugnant, I need not say. His reverence for freedom never\r\nwavered. He wrote to an editor who had criticised his Liverpool address\r\n(Jan. 3, 1873):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the interest of my address, I wish to say that not a word to my\r\n    knowledge fell from me limiting the range of free inquiry, nor\r\n    have I ever supposed St. Paul to say anything so silly as “Prove\r\n    all things: but some you must not prove.” Doubtless some obscurity\r\n    of mine, I know not what, has led to an error into which the able\r\n    writer of the article has fallen, not alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Duke of Argyll he wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 28, ’72._—I have been touching upon deep and dangerous\r\n    subjects at Liverpool. Whether I went beyond my province many may\r\n    doubt. But of the extent of the mischief I do not doubt any more\r\n    than of its virulence. All that I hear from day to day convinces\r\n    me of the extension of this strange epidemic, for it is not,\r\n    considering how it comes, worthy of being called a rational or\r\n    scientific process. Be it however, what it may, we politicians are\r\n    children playing with toys in comparison to that great work of and\r\n    for manhood, which has to be done, and will yet be done, in\r\n    restoring belief.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Robert Morier sent him from Munich Frohschammer’s reply to Strauss.\r\n“If I understand him aright,” said Mr. Gladstone, “he is a Unitarian,\r\nminus Miracle and Inspiration.” The whole book seemed to him able, honest,\r\nand diligent:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    But, he adds, I am one of those who think the Christianity of\r\n    Frohschammer (as I have described it) is like a tall tree\r\n    scientifically prepared for the saw by the preliminary process,\r\n    well known to wood-cutters, of clearing away with the axe all\r\n    projecting roots, which as long as they remained rendered the\r\n    final operation impossible. This first process leaves the tree\r\n    standing in a very trim condition, much more mathematical in form,\r\n    as it is more near a cylinder, than in its native state. The\r\n    business of the saw, when the horse and the man arrive, is soon\r\n    accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo his article on ritualism he prefixed as motto two short lines of\r\nPindar, about days that are to come being wisest witnesses.(327) In spite\r\nof retreat, it was impossible that he should forget the vast\r\nresponsibility imposed upon him, both by his gifts and by the popular\r\nascendency into which they had brought him. His was not the retreat of\r\nself-indulgence, and the days that were to come speedily brought him\r\nduties that were to bear him far into regions of storm and conflict now\r\nunforeseen. Meanwhile, with occasional visits to Westminster, he lived\r\neven and industrious days at Hawarden, felling trees, working at Greek\r\nmythology and ethnology, delighting in the woods and glades of the park,\r\nabove all delighting in the tranquillity of his “temple of peace.” Besides\r\nbeing the bookroom of a student, this was still a far-shining beacon in\r\nthe popular eye. If sages, scholars, heroes, saints, with time’s serene\r\nand hallowed gravity looked upon him from their shelves, yet loud echoes\r\nsounded in his ear from roaring surges of an outer world—from turbid ebb\r\nand flow of all the struggle and clamorous hopes and half-blind mysterious\r\ninstincts of the nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. The Octagon.\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is\r\n    easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he\r\n    who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the\r\n    independence of solitude.—EMERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the end of the eighties, Mr. Gladstone built for himself a fire-proof\r\nroom at the north-western corner of his temple of peace. In this\r\nOctagon—“a necessity of my profession and history”—he stored the letters\r\nand papers of his crowded lifetime. He estimated the “selected letters”\r\naddressed to himself at sixty thousand, and the mass of other letters that\r\nfound their way into the Octagon without selection, along with more than a\r\nscore of large folios containing copies of his own to other people, run to\r\nseveral tens of thousands more. There are between five and six hundred\r\nholographs from the Queen, afterward designated by him in his will to be\r\nan heirloom. “It may amuse you,” he told Lord Granville, who always wrote\r\nthe shortest letters that ever were known, “to learn that your letters to\r\nme weigh fifteen pounds and a-half.” Probably no single human being ever\r\nreceived sixty thousand letters worth keeping, and of these it is safe to\r\nsay that three-fourths of them might as well have been destroyed as soon\r\nas read, including a certain portion that might just as well never have\r\nbeen either written or read. This slightly improvident thrift recalls the\r\njealous persons who will not suffer the British Museum to burn its\r\nrubbish, on the curious principle that what was never worth producing must\r\nalways be worth preserving.\r\n\r\n(M168) As for Mr. Gladstone’s own share, he explains his case in what he\r\nsays (1865) to the widow of Mr. Cobden: “Of the kind of correspondence\r\nproperly called private and personal, I have none: indeed for many long\r\nlong years it has been out of my power, except in very few instances, to\r\nkeep up this kind of correspondence.” The exceptions are few indeed. Half\r\nof the contents of this crowded little chamber are papers of\r\nbusiness,—nightly letters to the Queen, telling her what had gone on in\r\nthe House and what sort of figure had been cut by its debaters, reports of\r\nmeetings of the cabinet, memoranda for such meetings, notes for speeches,\r\nendless correspondence with colleagues, and all the other operations\r\nincident to the laborious machinery of government in the charge of a\r\nmaster engineer. In this region of his true calling, all is order,\r\nprecision, persistency, and the firmness and ease of the strong. For many\r\nyears in that department all was action, strength, success. Church leaders\r\nagain contribute considerable piles, but these, too, mainly concern church\r\nbusiness for the hour, and the business has now even for adherents\r\nnaturally fallen out of memory. The more miscellaneous papers are\r\ndifferent. There a long and strange procession flits before our\r\neye—dreams, “little bustling passions,” trivialities, floating like a\r\nmyriad motes into the dim Octagon. We are reminded how vast a space in our\r\never-dwindling days is consumed by social invitations and the discovery of\r\npolite reasons for evading them. “Bona verba” is a significant docket\r\nprompting the secretary’s reply. It is borne in upon us how grievously the\r\nburden of man’s lot is aggravated by slovenly dates, illegible signatures,\r\nand forgetfulness that writing is something meant to be read. There is a\r\nmountain of letters from one correspondent so mercilessly written, that\r\nthe labour of decyphering them would hardly be justified, even if one\r\ncould hope to recover traces of the second decade of Livy or the missing\r\nbooks of the _Annals_ of Tacitus. Foreign rulers, Indian potentates,\r\nAmerican citizens, all write to the most conspicuous Englishman of the\r\ntime. In an unformed hand a little princess thanks him for a photograph,\r\nand says, “I am so glad to have seen you at Windsor, and will try and\r\nremember you all my life.” There are bushels of letters whose writers “say\r\nall that they conscientiously can” for applicants, nominees, and\r\ncandidates in every line where a minister is supposed to be able to lend a\r\nhelping hand if he likes. Actors send him boxes, queens of song press on\r\nhim lozenges infallible for the vocal cords, fine ladies dabbling in\r\nItalian seek counsel, and not far off, what is more to the point, are\r\nletters from young men thanking him for his generosity in aiding them to\r\ngo to Oxford with a view to taking orders. Charles Kean, a popular\r\ntragedian of those times, and son of one more famous still, thanks Mr.\r\nGladstone for his speech at a complimentary dinner to him (March 1862),\r\nand says how proud he is to remember that they were boys at Eton together.\r\nThen there are the erudite but unfruitful correspondents, with the\r\nmelancholy docket, “_Learning thrown away_”; and charming professors of\r\npoetry—as though the alto should insist on singing the basso\r\npart—impressively assure him how dreadfully uneasy they are about the\r\nweakness of our army, and how horribly low upon the security of our Indian\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n(M169) Some have said that to peruse the papers of a prime minister must\r\nlower one’s view of human nature. Perhaps this may partly depend upon the\r\nprime minister, partly on the height of our expectations from our\r\nfellow-creatures. If such a survey is in any degree depressing, there can\r\nbe no reason why it should be more so than any other large inspection of\r\nhuman life. In the Octagon as in any similar repository we come upon\r\nplenty of baffled hopes, chagrin in finding a career really ended, absurd\r\nover-estimates of self, over-estimates of the good chances of the world,\r\nvexation of those who have chosen the wrong path at the unfair good luck\r\nof those who have chosen the right. We may smile, but surely in\r\ngood-natured sympathy, at the zeal of poor ladies for a post for husbands\r\nof unrecognised merit, or at the importunity of younger sons with large\r\nfamilies but inadequate means. Harmless things of this sort need not turn\r\nus into satirists or cynics.\r\n\r\nAll the riddles of the great public world are there—why one man becomes\r\nprime minister, while another who ran him close at school and college ends\r\nwith a pension from the civil list; why the same stable and same pedigree\r\nproduce a Derby winner and the poor cab-hack; why one falls back almost\r\nfrom the start, while another runs famously until the corner, and then his\r\nvaulting ambition dwindles to any place of “moderate work and decent\r\nemolument”; how new competitors swim into the field of vision; how suns\r\nrise and set with no return, and vanish as if they had never been suns but\r\nonly ghosts or bubbles; how in these time-worn papers, successive\r\ngenerations of active men run chequered courses, group following group,\r\nnames blazing into the fame of a day, then like the spangles of a rocket\r\nexpiring. Men write accepting posts, all excitement, full of hope and\r\nassurance of good work, and then we remember how quickly clouds came and\r\nthe office ended in failure and torment. In the next pigeon-hole just in\r\nthe same way is the radiant author’s gift of his book that after all fell\r\nstill-born. One need not be prime minister to know the eternal tale of the\r\nvanity of human wishes, or how men move,\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thundering like ramping hosts of warrior horse\r\n    To throw that faint thin line upon the shore.(328)\r\n\r\n\r\nNor are things all one way. If we find Mr. Gladstone writing to the Queen\r\nof “the excellent parliamentary opening” of this man or that, who made the\r\nworst possible parliamentary close, there is the set-off of dull unmarked\r\nbeginnings to careers that proved brilliant or weighty. If there are a\r\nthousand absurdities in the form of claims for place and honours and steps\r\nin the peerage, all the way up the ladder, from a branch post-office to\r\nthe coveted blue riband of the garter, “with no infernal nonsense of merit\r\nabout it,” there are, on the other hand, not a few modest and considerate\r\nrefusals, and we who have reasonable views of human nature, may set in the\r\nbalance against a score of the begging tribe, the man of just pride who\r\nwill not exchange his earldom for a marquisate, and the honest peer who to\r\nthe proffer of the garter says, with gratitude evidently sincere, “I\r\nregret, however, that I cannot conscientiously accept an honour which is\r\nbeyond my deserts.” Then the Octagon contains abundant material for any\r\nstudent of the lessons of a parliamentary crisis, though perhaps the\r\nstudent knew before how even goodish people begin to waver in great\r\ncauses, when they first seriously suspect the horrid truth that they may\r\nnot after all be in a majority. Many squibs, caricatures, and malicious\r\ndiatribes, dated in Mr. Gladstone’s own hand, find shelter. But then\r\ncompensation for faintheartedness or spite abounds in the letters of the\r\nstaunch. And these not from the party politicians merely. Mr. Gladstone\r\nstirred different and deeper waters. The famous fighting bishop,\r\nPhillpotts of Exeter, then drawing on towards ninety and the realms of\r\nsilence, writes to him on the Christmas Day of 1863: “A Christian\r\nstatesman is a rare object of reverence and honour. Such I entirely\r\nbelieve are you. I often remember the early days of my first intercourse\r\nwith you. Your high principles gave an early dignity to your youth, and\r\npromised the splendid earthly career which you are fulfilling. I shall not\r\nlive to witness that fulfilment.” A whole generation later, General Booth\r\nwrote: “Throughout the world no people will pray more fervently and\r\nbelievingly for your continued life and happiness than the officers and\r\nsoldiers of the salvation army.” Here is Mr. Spurgeon, the most popular\r\nand effective of the nonconforming preachers and workers of the time,\r\nwriting:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I felt ready to weep when you were treated with so much contumely\r\n    by your opponent in your former struggle; and yet I rejoiced that\r\n    you were educating this nation to believe in conscience and\r\n    truth.... I wish I could brush away the gadflies, but I suppose by\r\n    this time you have been stung so often that the system has become\r\n    invulnerable.... You are loved by hosts of us as intensely as you\r\n    are hated by certain of the savage party.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when Mr. Gladstone was to visit Spurgeon’s tabernacle (Jan. 1882):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I feel like a boy who is to preach with his father to listen to\r\n    him. I shall try not to know that you are there at all, but just\r\n    preach to my poor people the simple word which has held them by\r\n    their thousands these twenty-eight years. You do not know how\r\n    those of us regard you, who feel it a joy to live when a premier\r\n    believes in righteousness. We believe in no man’s infallibility,\r\n    but _it is restful to be sure of one man’s integrity_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat admirable sentence marks the secret.\r\n\r\nAll the religious agitations of the time come before us. Eminent foreign\r\nconverts from the Roman church still find comfort in warning this most\r\nunshaken of believers against “a superficial and sceptical liberalism.”\r\nOthers, again, condemned for heresy hail him as “dear and illustrious\r\nmaster”—with no cordial response, we may surmise. Relying on Mr.\r\nGladstone’s character for human-heartedness and love of justice, people\r\nsubmit to him some of the hard domestic problems then and so often forced\r\nupon the world by the quarrels of the churches. One lady lays before him\r\n(1879) with superabundant detail a case where guardians insisted on the\r\nchild of a mixed marriage being brought up as a protestant, against the\r\nfervid wishes of the surviving parent, a catholic. Mr. Gladstone masters\r\nthe circumstances, forms his judgment, elaborates it in a closely argued\r\nmemorandum, and does not evade the responsibility of advising. In another\r\nof these instances the tragedy is reversed; the horrid oppression is\r\nperpetrated on the protestant mother by the catholic father, and here too\r\nit is Mr. Gladstone to whom the sufferer appeals for intercession.\r\n\r\nHis correspondents have not always so much substance in them. One lady of\r\nevangelical strain, well known in her time, writes to him about turbulence\r\nin Ireland on the last day of 1880. The private secretary dockets: “Wishes\r\nyou a blessed new year; but goes on in a very impertinent strain\r\nattributing your ‘inaction’ in Ireland to unprincipled colleagues, and to\r\nwant of heavenly guidance. Encloses suggestions for prayer.” In such\r\ninstances, even when the appeal came near to raving, Mr. Gladstone\r\nwhenever he thought the writer’s motives sincere, seems to have replied\r\nwith patience, and at a length very different from the pithy brevity of\r\nthe Iron Duke upon the like occasions. Sometimes we may assume that the\r\nsecretary’s phlegmatic docket sufficed, as on an epistle thus described:\r\n“1. Sends review in —— on his book. 2. Would like you to read —— and ——\r\n(his poems). 3. Will send you soon his prose on ——. 4. Hopes you will not\r\noverwork yourself. 5. His children call you St. William.” Sometimes we\r\nknow not whether it is simplicity or irony that inspires the grave\r\npoliteness of his replies. He seems to be in all sincerity surprised at\r\nthe view taken by somebody “of the reluctance of public men to hold\r\ninterviews for unexplained and indefinite purposes, and their preference\r\nfor written communications.” Somebody writes a pamphlet on points of the\r\nministerial policy, and suggests that each member of the government might\r\norder and distribute a competent number of copies. Mr. Gladstone\r\nimmediately indicates two serious difficulties, first that the ministers\r\nwould then make themselves responsible for the writer’s opinion in detail\r\nno less than in mass, and second their intervention would greatly detract\r\nfrom its weight. Even importunity for a subscription never makes him curt:\r\n“I am sure you will not misconstrue me, when I beg respectfully to state\r\nthat your efforts will stand better without my personal co-operation.”\r\n\r\n(M170) The correspondence is polyglot. In one little bundle, Cavour writes\r\nin Italian and French; the Archbishop of Cephalonia congratulates him in\r\nGreek on the first Irish Land bill; and in the same tongue the Archbishop\r\nof Chios gives him a book on the union of the Armenian with the Anatolian\r\ncommunion; Huber regales him with the luxury of German _cursivschrift_.\r\nThe archimandrite Myrianthes forwards him objects from the Holy Land. The\r\npatriarch of Constantinople (1896) sends greetings and blessings, and\r\ntestifies to the bonds of fellowship between the eastern and anglican\r\nchurches undisturbed since the days of Cyril Lukaris. Dupanloup, the\r\nfamous Bishop of Orleans (1869), applauds the plan of _Juventus Mundi_,\r\nits grandeur, its beauty, its moral elevation; and proceeds to ask how he\r\ncan procure copies of the articles on _Ecce Homo_, as to which his\r\ncuriosity has been aroused. A couple of notes (1864 and 1871) from\r\nGaribaldi, the great revolutionist, are neighbours to letters (1851-74)\r\nfrom Guizot, the great conservative. Three or four lines in French from\r\nGaribaldi were given to Mr. Gladstone the day before leaving Cliveden and\r\nEngland (April 24, 1864): “In leaving you pray accept a word of\r\nrecognition for all the kindness you have heaped upon me, and for the\r\ngenerous interest you have at all times shown for the cause of my\r\ncountry.—Your devoted G. GARIBALDI.” The other shorter still (1871) begs\r\nhim to do something for a French refugee. Minghetti, Ricasoli, and others\r\nof that celebrated group commemorate his faithful and effective good will\r\nto Italy. Daniel Manin the Venetian thanks him in admirable English for\r\nsome books, as well as for his energetic and courageous act in drawing a\r\nperfidious king (Naples) before the bar of public opinion. Manzoni gives\r\nto a friend a letter of introduction (1845), and with Italian warmth of\r\nphrase expresses his lively recollection of the day on which he made Mr.\r\nGladstone’s acquaintance, and the admiration with which his name is\r\nfollowed. Mérimée, the polished and fastidious genius, presents to him a\r\nFrench consul at Corfu (1858) who in his quality of philhellene and\r\nhellenist desires ardently to make the acquaintance of Homer’s learned and\r\neloquent commentator. Lesseps, whose hand gave so tremendous and\r\nimpressive a turn to forces, policies, currents of trade, promises (1870)\r\nto keep an appointment, when he will have the double honour of being\r\npresented to the Princess Louise by a man so universally respected for the\r\nhigh services he has rendered to the Queen, to his country, and to the\r\nprogress of the world.\r\n\r\nIf the language is polyglot, the topics are encyclopædic. Bishops send him\r\ntheir charges; if a divine translates a hymn, he submits it; if he hits\r\nupon an argument on the mysteries of the faith, or the vexed themes of\r\ntheological debate, he despatches pages and pages to Hawarden, and\r\nreceives page upon page in reply. Young authors, and especially young\r\nauthoresses pestered him to review their books, though his patience and\r\ngood nature make ’pester’ seem an inapplicable word. A Scotch professor\r\nfor some reason or another copies out and forwards to him one of Goethe’s\r\nreflections and maxims:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    How may a man attain to self-knowledge? By Contemplation?\r\n    certainly not: but by Action. Try to do your Duty and you will\r\n    find what you are fit for. But what is your Duty? The Demand of\r\n    the Hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs if of all men then living on our planet, Mr. Gladstone were not he to\r\nwhom such counsel was most superfluous. He replies (Oct. 9, 1880), “I feel\r\nthe immense, the overmastering power of Goethe, but with such limited\r\nknowledge as I have of his works, I am unable to answer the question\r\nwhether he has or has not been an evil genius of humanity.”\r\n\r\n(M171) In 1839 Spedding, the Baconian, to whom years later the prime\r\nminister proposed that he should fill the chair of history at Cambridge,\r\nwrote to him that John Sterling, of whom Mr. Gladstone already knew\r\nsomething, was prevented by health from living in London, and so by way of\r\nmeeting his friends on his occasional visits, had proposed that certain of\r\nthem should agree to dine together cheaply once a month at some stated\r\nplace. As yet Sterling had only spoken to Carlyle, John Mill, Maurice, and\r\nBingham Baring. “I hope,” says Spedding, “that your devotion to the more\r\ngeneral interests of mankind will not prevent your assisting in this\r\nlittle job.” Mr. Gladstone seems not to have assisted, though his friend\r\nBishop Wilberforce did, and fell into some hot water in consequence. A\r\nveteran and proclaimed freethinker sets out to Mr. Gladstone his own\r\nrecognition of what ought to be a truism, that he is for every man being\r\nfaithful to his faith; that his aggressive denial of the inspiration of\r\nthe Bible did not prevent him from sending a copy in large type to his old\r\nmother to read when her eyes were dim; that he respected consolations\r\ncongenial to the conscience. “I hope,” he says to Mr. Gladstone, “there is\r\na future life, and if so, my not being sure of it will not prevent it, and\r\nI know of no better way of deserving it than by conscious service of\r\nhumanity. The Universe never filled me with such wonder and awe as when I\r\nknew I could not account for it. _I admit ignorance is a privation. But to\r\nsubmit not to know where knowledge is withheld, seems but one of the\r\nsacrifices that reverence for truth imposes on us._” The same\r\ncorrespondent speaks (1881) of “the noble toleration which you have\r\npersonally shown me, notwithstanding what you must think seriously\r\nerroneous views of mine, and upon which I do not keep silence.” Mr.\r\nGladstone had written to him six years before (1875): “Differing from you,\r\nI do not believe that secular motives are adequate either to propel or to\r\nrestrain the children of our race, but I earnestly desire to hear the\r\nother side, and I appreciate the advantage of having it stated by sincere\r\nand high-minded men.” There is a letter too from the son of another\r\nconspicuous preacher of negation, replying to some words of Mr. Gladstone\r\nwhich he took to be disparaging of his parent, and begging him, “a\r\nlifelong idealist yourself,” to think more worthily and sympathetically of\r\none whom if he had known he would have appreciated and admired.\r\n\r\nA considerable correspondence is here from the learned Bishop Stubbs\r\n(1888) on the character of Bishop Fisher of Rochester, the fellow-sufferer\r\nof More; on the Convocation Act of 1531 and the other Convocation Acts of\r\nElizabeth; on Father Walsh’s letters, and other matters of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. In fact, it is safe to assume that Mr. Gladstone has always some\r\necclesiastical, historical, theological controversy running alongside of\r\nthe political and party business of the day. Nobody that ever lived tried\r\nto ride so many horses abreast. Another prelate puts a point that is worth\r\nremembering by every English school of foreign policy. “In 1879,” writes\r\nBishop Creighton (Feb. 15, 1887), “when foreign affairs were much before\r\nthe public, I suggested to a publisher a series of books dealing quite\r\nshortly and clearly with the political history and constitution of the\r\nchief states of Europe from 1815. I designed them for popular instruction,\r\nthinking it of great importance that people in general should know what\r\nthey were talking about, when they spoke of France or Russia.... The\r\nresult of my attempt was to convince me that our ignorance of the last\r\nsixty years is colossal.”\r\n\r\nLord Stanhope has been reading (1858) the “Tusculan Questions,” and\r\nconfides to Mr. Gladstone’s sympathetic ear Cicero’s shockingly faulty\r\nrecollection of Homer,—mistaking Euryclea for Anticlea, the nurse for the\r\nmother, and giving to Polyphemus a speech that Polyphemus never spoke. A\r\nbishop says Macaulay told him that one of the most eloquent passages in\r\nthe English language is in Barrow’s Seventy-Fifth Sermon, on the\r\nNativity—“Let us consider that the Nativity doth import the completion of\r\nmany ancient promises....”(329) Letters abound and over-abound on that\r\nmost movable of topics—“the present state of the Homeric controversy.”\r\nScott, the lexicographer, sends him Greek epigrams on events too fugitive\r\nto be now worth recalling—discusses Homeric points, and while not\r\nsurrendering at discretion, admits them worthy of much consideration.\r\nThere are many pages from Thirlwall, that great scholar and enlightened\r\nman, upon points of Homeric ethnology, Homeric geography, and such\r\nquestions as whether a line in the _Iliad_ (xiv. 321) makes the mother of\r\nMinos to be a Phœnician damsel or the daughter of Phœnix, or whether it is\r\npossible to attach a meaning to ἐννέωρος that would represent Minos as\r\nbeginning his reign when nine years old—a thing, the grave bishop adds,\r\neven more strange than the passion of Dante for Beatrice at the same age.\r\n\r\n(M172) Huxley sends him titles of books on the origin of the domestic\r\nhorse; Sir Joseph Hooker supplies figures of the girth of giant trees; the\r\nnumber of annual rings in a fallen stump which would seem to give it 6420\r\nyears; tells him how the wood of another was as sound after 380 years as\r\nif just felled. Somebody else interests him in Helmholtz’s experiments on\r\nthe progression of the vibrations of the true vowel sounds. Letters pass\r\nbetween him and Darwin (1879) on colours and names for colours. Darwin\r\nsuggests the question whether savages have names for shades of colours: “I\r\nshould expect that they have not, and this would be remarkable, for the\r\nIndians of Chili and Tierra del Fuego have names for every slight\r\npromontory and hill to a marvellous degree.” Mr. Gladstone proposes to\r\nnominate him a trustee of the British Museum (April 1881), and Darwin\r\nreplies, “I would gladly have accepted, had my strength been sufficient\r\nfor anything like regular attendance at the meetings.” Professor Owen\r\nthanks him for the honour of Knight of the Bath, and expresses his true\r\nsense of the aid and encouragement that he has uniformly received from Mr.\r\nGladstone throughout the course of the labours from which he is now\r\nretiring.\r\n\r\nHe corresponds with a learned French statesman, not on the insoluble\r\nNewfoundland problem, turning so much on the nice issue whether a lobster\r\nis a fish, and not on the vexed Egyptian question, but on the curious\r\nprohibition of pork as an article of food—a strange contradiction between\r\nthe probable practice of the Phœnicians and that of the Jews, perpetuated\r\nin our times through all Mussulman countries, and a prohibition not to be\r\nexplained on sanitary grounds, because to the present day Christians in\r\nthe East all indulge in pork and are none the worse for it. A young member\r\nof parliament one night fell into conversation with him, as a branch from\r\nthe subject of the eating of bovine flesh by the Greeks, on the eating of\r\nhorseflesh, and the next day writes to mention to him that at a council in\r\n785 with the Bishop of Ostia as president, it was decreed, “Many among you\r\neat horses, which is not done by any Christians in the East: avoid this;”\r\nand he asks Mr. Gladstone whether he believed that by reason of the high\r\nestimation in which the Greeks held the horse, they abstained from his\r\nflesh. Mr. Gladstone (August 1889) replies that while on his guard against\r\nspeaking with confidence about the historic period, he thought he was safe\r\nin saying that the Greeks did not eat the horse in the heroic period, and\r\nhe refers to passages in this book and the other. “It was only a\r\nconjecture, however, on my part that the near relation of the horse to\r\nhuman feeling and life may probably have been the cause that prevented the\r\nconsumption of horse-flesh.” In a further letter he refers his\r\ncorrespondent to the closing part of the _Englishman in Paris_ for some\r\ncurious particulars on hippophagy. Then he seems to have interested\r\nhimself in a delicate question as to the personal claims of Socrates in\r\nthe light of a moral reformer, and the sage’s accommodation of moral\r\nsentiment to certain existing fashions in Athenian manners. But as I have\r\nnot his side of the correspondence, I can only guess that his point was\r\nthe inferiority of the moral ideals of Socrates to those of Christ.\r\nGustave d’Eichthal, one of the celebrated group of Saint-Simonians who\r\nmingled so much of what was chimerical with much that was practical and\r\nfruitful, draws the attention of Mr. Gladstone, statesman, philosopher,\r\nand hellenist, to writings of his own on the practical use of Greek, as\r\ndestined to be the great national language of humanity, perhaps even\r\nwithin the space of two or three generations. Guizot begs him to accept\r\nhis book on Peel; and thanking him for his article on the “Royal\r\nSupremacy” (Feb. 9, 1864), says further what must have given Mr. Gladstone\r\nlively satisfaction:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Like you, I could wish that the anglican church had more\r\n    independence and self-government; but such as it is, and taking\r\n    all its history into account, I believe that of all the Christian\r\n    churches, it is that in which the spiritual régime is best\r\n    reconciled with the political, and the rights of divine tradition\r\n    with those of human liberty.... I shall probably send you in the\r\n    course of this year some meditations on the essence and history of\r\n    the Christian religion. Europe is in an anti-Christian crisis; and\r\n    having come near the term of life, I have it much at heart to mark\r\n    my place in this struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M173) For some reason Henry Taylor encloses him (April 5, 1837) “a letter\r\nwritten by Southey the other day to _a wild girl_ who sent him some\r\nrhapsodies of her writing, and told him she should be in an agony till she\r\nshould receive his opinion of them.” This recalls a curious literary\r\nincident, for the “wild girl” was Charlotte Brontë, and Southey warned her\r\nthat “literature cannot be the business of a woman’s life and ought not to\r\nbe,” and yet his letter was both sensible and kind, though as time showed\r\nit was a bad shot.(330) Thackeray has been asked to breakfast but “I only\r\ngot your note at 2 o’clock this afternoon, when the tea would have been\r\nquite cold; and next Thursday am engaged to lecture at Exeter, so that I\r\ncan’t hope to breakfast with you. I shall be absent from town some three\r\nweeks, and hope Mrs. Gladstone will permit me to come to see her on my\r\nreturn.” Froude, who was often at his breakfasts, gives him a book (year\r\ndoubtful): “I took the liberty of sending it you merely as an expression\r\nof the respect and admiration that I have felt towards you for many\r\nyears,”—sentiments that hardly stood the wear and tear of time and\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 what Macaulay styles a most absurd committee was appointed to\r\ndevise inscriptions for medals to be given to the exhibitors at the great\r\nworld-show of next year. Its members were, besides Macaulay himself and\r\nGladstone, Milman, Liddell, Lyttelton, Charles Merivale. Milman bethought\r\nhim of looking into Claudian, and sent to Mr. Gladstone three or four\r\nalternative lines fished out from the last of the poets of Roman paganism.\r\nMacaulay had another idea;—\r\n\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR GLADSTONE,—I am afraid that we must wait till Thursday. I\r\n    do not much, like taking words from a passage certainly obscure\r\n    and probably corrupt. Could we not do better ourselves? I have\r\n    made no Latin verses these many years. But I will venture. I send\r\n    you three attempts:—\r\n\r\n    Pulcher et ille labor, pulchros ornare labores.\r\n    Pulchrum etiam, pulchros palma donare labores.\r\n    Pulchrum etiam, pulchris meritam decernere palmam.\r\n\r\n    You will easily make better. If we can produce a tolerable line\r\n    among us, we may pretend, as Lardner did, that it is in\r\n    Haphorstrus or Masenius.—Yours ever,      T. B. MACAULAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancis Newman, the cardinal’s high-minded and accomplished brother,\r\nwrites to Mr. Gladstone (1878) in a strain of exalted recognition of his\r\nservices to the nation, and quotes (a little oddly perhaps) the beautiful\r\nlines in Euripides, foretelling the approaching triumph of Dionysus over\r\nhis mortal foe.(331)\r\n\r\nThe poets are not absent. Wordsworth, as we have already seen (i. p. 269\r\n_n._), sends to him at the board of trade his remonstrance and his sonnet\r\non the railway into Windermere. Tennyson addresses to him for his personal\r\nbehoof the sonnet upon the Redistribution bill of 1884—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Steersman, be not precipitate in thine act\r\n    Of steering ...”\r\n\r\n\r\nand on a sheet of note-paper at a later date when Irish self-government\r\nwas the theme, he copies the Greek lines from Pindar, “how easy a thing it\r\nis even for men of light weight to shake a state, how hard to build it up\r\nagain.”(332) Rogers (1844) insists that, “if one may judge from\r\nexperience, perhaps the best vehicle in our language for a translator of\r\nverse is prose. He who doubts it has only to open his Bible.... Who could\r\nwish the stories of Joseph and of Ruth to be otherwise than they are? Or\r\nwho but would rejoice if the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ were so translated?\r\nI once asked Porson to attempt it, and he seemed to like the idea, but\r\nsaid that it would be a labour of ten or twelve years.”\r\n\r\n(M174) There was one true poet, and not only a poet but a man, as we now\r\nsee, with far truer insight into the intellectual needs of his countrymen\r\nthan any other writer of the closing quarter of the century, who is\r\nsometimes supposed to have been overlooked by Mr. Gladstone. And here in\r\nthe Octagon is Matthew Arnold’s letter soliciting his recommendation\r\n(1867) for the strictly prosaic post of librarian of the House of Commons,\r\nwhich happily he did not obtain. The year before, Arnold had wished to be\r\nmade a commissioner under the Endowed Schools Act, but a lawyer was\r\nrightly thought necessary by Lord Russell or his advisers, and there is no\r\ngood reason to suppose that Mr. Gladstone meddled either way. He was\r\nresponsible in 1882 for a third disappointment, but here again it has been\r\ntruly said that to appoint to the charity commission a man of sixty, who\r\nhad no intimate knowledge of charity law, and who had recently in his\r\narticles irritated all the nonconformists in England by his ironical\r\nreferences to dissent and dissenters, would not have been conducive to the\r\nefficient transaction of public business. A year later Mr. Gladstone\r\nproffered him, and his friends made him accept, a civil list pension of\r\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds a year, “in public recognition of service to\r\nthe poetry and literature of England.” Arnold in a letter here tries to\r\nsoften Mr. Gladstone’s heart on the subject of copyright, on which, as I\r\noften made bold to tell him, he held some rather flagrant heresies. Here\r\nthe poet begs the minister to consider whether an English author ought not\r\nto have property in his work for a longer time than he has now. “For many\r\nbooks the sale begins late, the author has to create, as Wordsworth said,\r\nthe taste by which he is to be enjoyed. Such an author is surely the very\r\nman one would wish to protect.” I fear he made no convert.\r\n\r\nAnother poet, with no eye on patronage or pension, hopes to be permitted\r\nto say (1869), “how very many of your countrymen whom you have forgotten\r\nor never saw, follow your noble and courageous development of legislation\r\nwith the same personal devotion, gratitude, and gladness that I feel.”\r\nThen five years later he still assures him that among men of letters he\r\nmay have antagonists but he cannot have enemies—rather a fine distinction,\r\nwith painfully little truth in it as things happened.\r\n\r\nTo Miss Martineau, who had done hard work in more than one good cause, he\r\nproposes a pension, which she honourably declines: “The work of my busy\r\nyears has supplied the needs of a quiet old age. On the former occasions\r\nof my declining a pension I was poor, and it was a case of scruple\r\n(possibly cowardice). Now I have a competence, and there would be no\r\nexcuse for my touching the public money. You will need no assurance that I\r\nam as grateful for your considerate offer, as if it had relieved me of a\r\nwearing anxiety.”\r\n\r\nIn 1885 he wrote to Mr. Watts, the illustrious painter, to request, with\r\nthe sanction of the Queen, that he would allow himself to be enrolled\r\namong the baronets of the United Kingdom. “It gives me lively pleasure,”\r\nhe said, “to have the means of thus doing honour to art in the person of\r\nso distinguished a representative of the noble pursuit.” Mr. Watts, in\r\nwords that I am permitted to transcribe, declined; as he did also a second\r\ntime in 1894 when the proposal was repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n    While I feel very strongly, and acknowledge with sincere\r\n    gratitude, that you have honoured in my person, making me a sort\r\n    of standard bearer, the pursuit of art for its own sake, and have\r\n    so afforded an enduring encouragement to those who, like myself,\r\n    may be willing to relinquish many good and tangible things for\r\n    purposes believed to be good, but not likely to meet with general\r\n    sympathy, still, I feel it would be something like a real disgrace\r\n    to accept for work merely attempted, reward and payment only due\r\n    to work achieved.... I should have the ghost of the Lycian chief\r\n    reproaching me in my dreams! Also the objects to which I wish to\r\n    dedicate the rest of my life will best be carried out in quiet and\r\n    obscurity, so please do not be vexed with me if I again beg\r\n    respectfully and gratefully to decline.... Sarpedon’s words(333)\r\n    always ring in my ears, and so I think you will understand the\r\n    things I cannot attempt to say.... I am so far from undervaluing\r\n    distinctions that I should like to be a Duke, and deserve the\r\n    title.... Still, it is true that, living mainly in a world of my\r\n    own, my views are narrowed (I hope I may also say simplified),\r\n    till a sense of the four great conditions which to my mind\r\n    comprise all that can be demonstrated of our existence, Life and\r\n    Death, Light and Darkness, so dominate my mental vision that they\r\n    almost become material entities and take material forms, dwarfing\r\n    and casting into shadow ordinary considerations. Over the two\r\n    first, human efforts broadly speaking avail nothing; but we have\r\n    it in our power to modify the two last (of course I include in the\r\n    terms all that belongs to good and bad, beauty and ugliness).\r\n    Labouring by the side of the poet and the statesman, the artist\r\n    may deal with those great issues, and here I think the art of\r\n    England has been at fault.... Your overestimate of my work has\r\n    hastened the execution of an intention I have long had, and which\r\n    indeed amounts to retirement from the ranks of professional men. I\r\n    have concluded, dating from June, to undertake no portraits and\r\n    accept no commissions, but, contented with the little I have to\r\n    live upon, work only with the idea of making my efforts worthy, at\r\n    least as efforts, of the nation’s acceptance alike before and\r\n    after my death.\r\n\r\n\r\n“You have adopted a resolution,” said Mr. Gladstone in his reply, “of the\r\nkind that makes the nineteenth century stare or blink, as those blink who\r\nstand in a great brightness and have not eyes for it. The course that you\r\npurpose is indeed a self-denying, an unworldly, and a noble one.”\r\n\r\n(M175) One packet touches a matter that at the moment did Mr. Gladstone\r\nsome harm in the judgment of men whose good opinion was worth having. In\r\n1873 John Stuart Mill died, and a public memorial was proposed. Mr.\r\nGladstone intimated that he was willing to co-operate. Then a liberal\r\nclergyman attacked the obituary notice in the _Times_ as too frigid, and\r\nthe author of the notice retorted by tales of Mill’s early views on the\r\nquestion of population. He was well acquainted with Mr. Gladstone, and set\r\nbusily to work to persuade him that Mill in his book on political economy\r\nadvocated obnoxious checks, that he was vaguely associated with American\r\npublications on the matter, and that he did not believe in God, which was\r\nnot to the point. Mr. Gladstone passed on this tissue of innuendo to the\r\nDuke of Argyll. The Duke reported that he had consulted men thoroughly\r\nconversant both with Mill and his writings; that he was assured no passage\r\ncould bear the construction imputed, and that the places which he had\r\nhimself looked into, clearly referred to prudential restraints on\r\nmarriage. Certainly a school of social economy that deals only with\r\nforeign exchanges and rent and values and the virtues of direct taxes and\r\nindirect, and draws the curtain around the question of population, must be\r\na singularly shallow affair. The Duke of Argyll manfully brushed wasps\r\naside, and sent his subscription. So did men as orthodox as Lord\r\nSalisbury, and as cautious as Lord Derby. Mr. Gladstone on the other hand\r\nwrote to the promoters of the memorial: “In my view this painful\r\ncontroversy still exists. I feel that it is not possible for me, situated\r\nas I am at the present time, to decide it or to examine it with a view to\r\ndecision. The only course open to me is to do no act involving a judgment\r\neither way, and, therefore, while I desire to avoid any public step\r\nwhatever, I withdraw from co-operation, and request that my name may be no\r\nfurther mentioned.” Unfortunately, the withdrawal of such a name could not\r\nbe other than a public step. To say, moreover, that the controversy still\r\nexisted, was to go a longish way in public opinion towards deciding it.\r\nThe curious thing is that Mr. Gladstone had known Mill so well—his\r\nsingleminded love of truth, his humanity, his passion for justice—as to\r\ncall him by the excellent name of “the Saint of Rationalism.” A saint of\r\nany sort is surely uncommon enough in our fallen world, to claim an equity\r\nthat is not refused to sinners. Yet fifteen years later he wrote a letter\r\ndoing Mill more justice. “Of all the motives, stings, and stimulants,” he\r\nwrote, “that reach men through their egoism in parliament, no part could\r\nmove or even touch him. His conduct and his language were in this respect\r\na sermon. Again, though he was a philosopher he was not, I think, a man of\r\ncrotchets. He had the good sense and practical tact of politics, together\r\nwith the high independent thought of a recluse.”(334)\r\n\r\nA learned Unitarian (Beard) sends him a volume of Hibbert lectures. “All\r\nsystems,” Mr. Gladstone writes in acknowledging it, “have their _slang_,\r\nbut what I find in almost every page of your book is that you have none.”\r\nHe complains, however, of finding Augustine put into a leash with Luther\r\nand Calvin. “Augustine’s doctrine of human nature is substantially that of\r\nBishop Butler; and he converted me about forty-five years ago to Butler’s\r\ndoctrine.” Of far earlier date than this (1839) is an interesting letter\r\nfrom Montalembert:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _London, July 4, 1839._—It seems to me that amidst many\r\n    _dissentimens_, and although you pass generally in this country\r\n    for an enemy to my faith and my church, there is a link between\r\n    us; since admitting every superiority of talent and influence on\r\n    your side, we stand on the same ground in public life—that of the\r\n    inalienable rights of spiritual power. I have, therefore, received\r\n    your book with gratitude, and read it with the sincerest interest.\r\n    I now take the liberty of offering you a portion of the work I\r\n    have published, not on matter of actual controversy, but on an\r\n    unknown and delightful subject of religious history. If you ever\r\n    find leisure enough to throw a glance on the _History of St.\r\n    Elizabeth_, and more particularly on the _Introduction_, which is\r\n    a rapid _résumé_ of the thirteenth century, you will perhaps gain\r\n    some slight information on what the Rev. Hugh McNeile so\r\n    appropriately called “the filth and falsehood of the middle ages,”\r\n    in his splendid speech on church extension, at Freemasons’ Hall a\r\n    few days ago. And allow me to add, my dear sir, with the utter\r\n    frankness which I cannot divest myself of, that what you seem to\r\n    me to stand the most in need of at present, is a deeper and more\r\n    original knowledge of the laws and events of Catholic Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen come others, recalling illustrious names and famous events in English\r\nhistory. There are a dozen letters of business (1837-1846) from the Duke\r\nof Wellington. The reader may be curious to see the earliest communication\r\nbetween two such men—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _London, Nov. 27, 1837._—I have by accident mislaid the petition\r\n    from the Cape of Good Hope, if it was ever sent me. But I shall be\r\n    happy to see you and converse with you upon the subject; and\r\n    consider whether it is desirable or possible that I can bring the\r\n    subject before the consideration of the House of Lords at the same\r\n    time that you will in the H. of C. I would propose to you to come\r\n    here, or that I should go to you to-morrow, Tuesday, at any hour\r\n    you will name.—I have the honour to be, dear sir, your most\r\n    faithful, humble servant,\r\n\r\n    WELLINGTON.(335)\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce he uses his well-known laconic style—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Strathfieldsaye, January 3, 1842._—F. M. the Duke of Wellington\r\n    presents his compliments to Mr. Gladstone. He has received Mr.\r\n    Gladstone’s letter of the 1st inst. He begs leave to decline to\r\n    interfere in any manner in the matter to which Mr. Gladstone’s\r\n    letter refers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the matter was we cannot tell; but we may guess that it was perhaps\r\nless tersely propounded. The rest touch military affairs in the colonies,\r\nand are now of no concern.\r\n\r\nHere we have a last vision of one of the forlorn shadows of ruined power:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Chislehurst, le 5 Juillet, 1871._—Monsieur le Ministre, j’ai reçu\r\n    la copie du nouveau Ballot bill que votre excellence a bien voulu\r\n    m’envoyer et je profite de cette occasion pour vous dire combien\r\n    je suis touché des marques d’attention que je reçois en\r\n    Angleterre. Je vous prie de recevoir l’assurance de mes sentimens\r\n    de haute estime.\r\n\r\n    NAPOLÉON.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes from and to his illustrious adversary in the stirring arena of\r\npublic life are not without a delicate accent of pathos and sincerity. The\r\nfirst was on some occasion of Mrs. Disraeli’s illness,(336) the second on\r\nher death:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 20, 1867._—I was incapable yesterday of expressing to you\r\n    how much I appreciate your considerate sympathy. My wife had\r\n    always a strong personal regard for you, and being of a vivid and\r\n    original character, she could comprehend and value your great\r\n    gifts and qualities. There is a ray of hope under this roof since\r\n    the last four and twenty hours: round your hearth, I trust, health\r\n    and happiness will be ever present.—Yours sincerely, B. DISRAELI.\r\n\r\n\r\nSix years later when Lady Beaconsfield died, Mr. Gladstone wrote (Jan. 19,\r\n1873):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. DISRAELI,—My reluctance to intrude on the sacredness and\r\n    freshness of your sorrow may now, I think, properly give way to a\r\n    yet stronger reluctance to forego adding our small but very\r\n    sincere tribute of sympathy to those abundant manifestations of it\r\n    which have been yielded in so many forms. You and I were, as I\r\n    believe, married in the same year. It has been permitted to both\r\n    of us to enjoy a priceless boon through a third of a century.\r\n    Spared myself the blow which has fallen on you, I can form some\r\n    conception of what it must have been and must be. I do not presume\r\n    to offer you the consolation which you will seek from another and\r\n    higher quarter. I offer only the assurance which all who know you,\r\n    and all who knew Lady Beaconsfield, and especially those among\r\n    them who like myself enjoyed for a length of time her marked,\r\n    though unmerited regard, may perhaps tender without impropriety,\r\n    the assurance that in this trying hour they feel deeply for you\r\n    and with you.—Believe me, sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    W. E. GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n    _Hughenden Manor, Jan. 24, 1873._—DEAR MR. GLADSTONE,—I am much\r\n    touched by your kind words in my great sorrow. I trust, I\r\n    earnestly trust, that you may be spared a similar affliction.\r\n    Marriage is the greatest earthly happiness, when founded on\r\n    complete sympathy. That hallowed lot was mine, and for a moiety of\r\n    my existence; and I know it is yours.—With sincere regard, D.\r\n\r\n\r\nA last note, with the quavering pen-strokes of old age (Nov. 6, 1888),\r\ncomes from the hand, soon to grow cold, of one who had led so strange a\r\nrevolution, and had stood for so much in the movement of things that to\r\nMr. Gladstone were supreme:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is a great kindness and compliment your wishing to see me. I\r\n    have known and admired you so long. But I cannot write nor talk\r\n    nor walk, and hope you will take my blessing, which I give from my\r\n    heart.—Yours most truly, JOHN H. CARD. NEWMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the perpetual whirl of life revolves, “by nature an unmanageable\r\nsight,” but—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Not wholly so to him who looks\r\n    In steadiness; who hath among least things\r\n    An under-sense of greatest; sees the parts\r\n    As parts, but with a feeling of the whole.(337)\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch steadiness, such under-sense and feeling of the whole, was Mr.\r\nGladstone’s gift and inspiration, never expending itself in pensive\r\nmusings upon the vain ambitions, illusions, cheats, regrets of human\r\nlife—such moods of half-morbid moralising were not in his temperament—but\r\never stirring him to duty and manful hope, to intrepid self-denial and\r\niron effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. Eastern Question Once More. (1876-1877)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The dead have been awakened—shall I sleep?\r\n      The world’s at war with tyrants—shall I crouch?\r\n    The harvest’s ripe—and shall I pause to reap?\r\n      I slumber not—the thorn is in my couch:\r\n    Each day a trumpet soundeth in mine ear,\r\n      Its echo in my heart.\r\n\r\n    —BRYON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nPreserved in the Octagon is a large packet of notes on “Future\r\nRetribution,” and on them is the docket, “_From this I was called away to\r\nwrite on Bulgaria._” In the spring of 1876 the Turkish volcano had burst\r\ninto flame. Of the Crimean war the reader has already seen enough and too\r\nmuch.(338) Its successes, in Mr. Gladstone’s words, by a vast expenditure\r\nof French and English life and treasure, gave to Turkey, for the first\r\ntime perhaps in her bloodstained history, twenty years of a repose not\r\ndisturbed either by herself or by any foreign power. As Cobden and Bright\r\nhad foreseen, as even many European statesmen who approved the war on\r\ngrounds of their own had foreseen, Turkish engagements were broken, for\r\nthis solid reason if for no other that Turkey had not in the resources of\r\nher barbaric polity the means to keep them.\r\n\r\nFierce revolt against intolerable misrule slowly blazed up in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, and a rising in Bulgaria, not dangerous in itself, was put\r\ndown by Turkish troops despatched for the purpose from Constantinople,\r\nwith deeds described by the British agent who investigated them on the\r\nspot, as the most heinous crimes that had stained the history of the\r\ncentury. The consuls of France and Germany at Salonica were murdered by\r\nthe Turkish mob. Servia and Montenegro were in arms. Moved by these\r\nsymptoms of a vast conflagration, the three imperial courts of Russia,\r\nAustria, and Germany agreed upon an instrument imposing on the Turk\r\ncertain reforms, to be carried out under European supervision. To this\r\ninstrument, known as the Berlin memorandum, England, along with France and\r\nItaly, was invited to adhere (May 13). The two other Powers assented, but\r\nMr. Disraeli and his cabinet refused,—a proceeding that, along with more\r\npositive acts, was taken by the Turk and other people to assure the moral\r\nsupport of Great Britain to the Ottoman, and probably to threaten military\r\nsupport against the Russian.\r\n\r\n(M176) This rejection of the Berlin memorandum in May marked the first\r\ndecisive moment in British policy. The withdrawal of England from the\r\nconcert of Europe, the lurid glare of the atrocities in Bulgaria, and his\r\nabiding sense of the responsibility imposed upon us by the Crimean war and\r\nall its attendant obligations, were the three main elements in the mighty\r\nstorm that now agitated Mr. Gladstone’s breast. Perhaps his sympathies\r\nwith the Eastern church had their share. In a fragment of reminiscence\r\ntwenty years after, he says:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    When, in 1876, the eastern question was forced forward by the\r\n    disturbances in the Turkish empire, and especially by the cruel\r\n    outrages in Bulgaria, I shrank naturally but perhaps unduly from\r\n    recognising the claim they made upon me individually. I hoped that\r\n    the ministers would recognise the moral obligations to the subject\r\n    races of the east, which we had in honour contracted as parties to\r\n    the Crimean war and to the peace of Paris in 1856. I was slow to\r\n    observe the real leanings of the prime minister, his strong\r\n    sympathy with the Turk, and his mastery in his own cabinet. I\r\n    suffered others, Forster in particular, to go far ahead of me. At\r\n    the close of the session [1876] a debate was raised upon the\r\n    subject, and I had at length been compelled to perceive that the\r\n    old idol was still to be worshipped at Constantinople, and that,\r\n    as the only person surviving in the House of Commons who had been\r\n    responsible for the Crimean war and the breaking of the bulwark\r\n    raised by the treaty of Kainardji on behalf of the eastern\r\n    Christians, I could no longer remain indifferent. Consequently in\r\n    that debate Mr. Disraeli had to describe my speech as the only one\r\n    that had exhibited a real hostility to the policy of the\r\n    government. It was, however, at that time an opposition without\r\n    hope. I went into the country, and had mentally postponed all\r\n    further action to the opening of the next session, when I learned\r\n    from the announcement of a popular meeting to be held in Hyde Park\r\n    that the question was alive.(339) So I at once wrote and published\r\n    on the Bulgarian case. From that time forward, till the final\r\n    consummation in 1879-80, I made the eastern question the main\r\n    business of my life. I acted under a strong sense of individual\r\n    duty without a thought of leadership; nevertheless it made me\r\n    again leader whether I would or no. The nation nobly responded to\r\n    the call of justice, and recognised the brotherhood of man. But it\r\n    was the nation, not the classes. When, at the close of the session\r\n    of 1876, there was the usual dispersion in pursuit of recreation,\r\n    I thought the occasion was bad. It was good, for the nation did\r\n    not disperse and the human heart was beating. When the clubs\r\n    refilled in October, the Turkish cause began again to make head.\r\n    Then came a chequered period, and I do not recollect to have\r\n    received much assistance from the “front bench.” Even Granville\r\n    had been a little startled at my proceedings, and wished me to\r\n    leave out the “bag and baggage” from my pamphlet.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the session of 1876 Mr. Disraeli quitted the House of\r\nCommons and became the Earl of Beaconsfield. Lord Granville informed Mr.\r\nGladstone, on the authority of a high personage, that Disraeli had said to\r\nthe Queen he must resign; “that the peerage was then suggested; that at\r\nfirst he said, ‘Yes, but accompanied with resignation,’ but was told that\r\nin the present state of Europe that was impossible.” In reporting to Sir\r\nArthur Gordon, then abroad, what was not merely a piece of news but an\r\nevent, Mr. Gladstone says (Aug. 16):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Disraeli assumes his earldom amidst loud acclaims. I had better be\r\n    mute about him and his influence generally, except as to a full\r\n    acknowledgment of his genius and his good points of character. His\r\n    government is supposed now to stand mainly upon its recent foreign\r\n    policy: the most selfish and least worthy I have ever known.\r\n    Whatever was open to any degree of exception in Palmerston, has\r\n    this year received a tenfold development in Disraeli. Derby’s\r\n    influence, I think, has been for good; but too little of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Duke of Argyll a couple of days before, he had written:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am entirely in harmony with you as to your view of the eastern\r\n    policy. It has been depressing and corrupting to the country; a\r\n    healthier air has been generated by indignation at the Bulgarian\r\n    massacres, which have thrown us back on our rather forgotten\r\n    humanity. I hope the subject will not slumber through the recess.\r\n    Dizzy’s speech (so I call him with all due respect to the peerage)\r\n    in the Turkish debate gave me a new light on his views. He is not\r\n    quite such a Turk as I had thought. What he hates is Christian\r\n    liberty and reconstruction. He supports old Turkey, thinking that\r\n    if vital improvements can be averted, it must break down; and his\r\n    fleet is at Besika Bay, I feel pretty sure, to be ready to lay\r\n    hold of Egypt as his share. So he may end as the Duke of Memphis\r\n    yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThen came the pamphlet. The story of this memorable publication is told in\r\nthe diary:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 28, 1876._—Church 8-½ A.M. Worked on a beginning for a\r\n    possible pamphlet on the Turkish question. I stupidly brought on\r\n    again my lumbago by physical exertion. Was obliged to put off my\r\n    pamphlet. Read _The Salvation of all Men_ ... 29.—Kept my bed\r\n    long. Wrote to Lord Granville, etc. ... and as a treat began\r\n    _Waverley_ once more. Lumbago bad. 30.—Much bed; forswear all\r\n    writing. Read St. Thomas Aquinas on the Soul.... _Waverley_. A\r\n    snug evening in the Temple of Peace. 31.—Kept my bed till four,\r\n    and made tolerable play in writing on Bulgarian horrors. _Sept.\r\n    1._—Wrote [16 letters]. Again worked hard in bed and sent off more\r\n    than half to the printers. Read _Waverley_. Short drive with C.\r\n    2.—This day I wrote again a good piece of the pamphlet in bed, but\r\n    improved considerably. Rose at four. Read _Waverley_ in the\r\n    evening. 3.—Hawarden Church 11 A.M. and 6-½ P.M. Wrote [16\r\n    letters]. Off at 10.15 P.M. for London. 4.—Reached 18 C.H.T. at\r\n    five in the morning by limited mail; bed till nine. Saw Lord\r\n    Granville, Mr. Delane, Sir A. Panizzi, Mr. Clowes, Messrs. Murray,\r\n    the American minister. In six or seven hours, principally at the\r\n    British Museum, I completed my MS., making all the needful\r\n    searches of papers and journals. Also worked on proof sheets.\r\n\r\n    _To Mrs. Gladstone._—We had an interesting little party at\r\n    Granville’s. I had a long talk with Delane. We, he and I, are much\r\n    of one mind in thinking the Turks must go out of Bulgaria, though\r\n    retaining a titular supremacy if they like. Between ourselves,\r\n    Granville a little hangs back from this, but he could not persuade\r\n    me to hold it back.\r\n\r\n    5.— ... Saw Lord Granville, Lord Hartington.... Finished the\r\n    correction of revises before one, discussing the text with Lord\r\n    Granville and making various alterations of phrase which he\r\n    recommended. At seven I received complete copies. We went to the\r\n    Haymarket theatre. Arranged my papers after this, and sent off\r\n    copies in various directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M177) The pamphlet spread like fire.(340) Within three or four days of\r\nits first appearance forty thousand copies had gone. It was instantly\r\nfollowed up by a tremendous demonstration among his constituents. “Sept.\r\n9, 1876.—Thought over my subject for Blackheath. Off at two. A very large\r\nmeeting. The most enthusiastic far that I ever saw. Spoke over an hour.”\r\nThis is his very prosaic story of the first of those huge and excited\r\nmultitudes of which for months and years to come he was to confront so\r\nmany. The pamphlet and the Blackheath speech were his rejoinder to the\r\nlight and callous tones of Mr. Disraeli, and the sceptical language of his\r\nforeign secretary, “I have a strong suspicion,” he told the Duke of\r\nArgyll, who was a fervent sympathiser, “that Dizzy’s crypto-Judaism has\r\nhad to do with his policy. The Jews of the east _bitterly_ hate the\r\nChristians; who have not always used them well.” This suspicion was\r\nconstant. “Disraeli,” he said to Mr. Gladstone, “may be willing to risk\r\nhis government for his Judaic feeling,—the deepest and truest, now that\r\nhis wife has gone, in his whole mind.”\r\n\r\nThe tract beats with a sustained pulse and passion that recall Burke’s\r\nletters on the _Regicide Peace_. The exhortation against moral complicity\r\nwith “the basest and blackest outrages upon record within the present\r\ncentury, if not within the memory of man”; the branding of the Turkish\r\nrace as “the one great anti-human specimen of humanity”; the talk of “fell\r\nsatanic orgies”; the declaration that there was not a criminal in a\r\nEuropean gaol nor a cannibal in the South Sea Islands, whose indignation\r\nwould not rise at the recital of that which had been done, which remained\r\nunavenged, which had left behind all the foul and all the fierce passions\r\nthat produced it, and might again spring up in another murderous harvest,\r\nfrom the soil soaked and reeking with blood, and in the air tainted with\r\nevery imaginable deed of crime and shame,—all this vehemence was hailed\r\nwith eager acclamation by multitudes who felt all that he felt, and found\r\nin his passionate invective words and a voice. Mr. Gladstone was not the\r\nman, his readers and his public were not the men, for mere denunciation.\r\nThey found in him a policy. Indignation, he said in a thoroughly\r\ncharacteristic sentence, indignation is froth, except as it leads to\r\naction; mere remonstrance is mockery. There are states of affairs, he told\r\nthem, in which human sympathy refuses to be confined by the rules,\r\nnecessarily limited and conventional, of international law. Servia and\r\nMontenegro in going to war against Turkey might plead human sympathies,\r\nbroad, deep, and legitimate, and that they committed no moral offence. The\r\npolicy of the British government was the _status quo_, “as you were.” This\r\nmeant the maintenance of Turkish executive authority. What was really\r\nneeded was the total withdrawal of the administrative rule of the Turk.\r\nAnd here he used words that became very famous in the controversy:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    But I return to, and end with, that which is the omega as well as\r\n    the alpha of this great and most mournful case. An old servant of\r\n    the crown and state, I entreat my countrymen, upon whom far more\r\n    than perhaps any other people of Europe it depends, to require and\r\n    to insist that our government which has been working in one\r\n    direction shall work in the other, and shall apply all its vigour\r\n    to concur with the other states of Europe in obtaining the\r\n    extinction of the Turkish executive power in Bulgaria. Let the\r\n    Turks now carry away their abuses in the only possible manner,\r\n    namely by carrying off themselves. Their Zaptiehs and their\r\n    Mudirs, their Bimbashis and their Yuzbashis, their Kaimakams and\r\n    their Pashas, one and all, bag and baggage, shall I hope clear out\r\n    from the province they have desolated and profaned.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Blackheath, under dripping rain clouds, he said the same, though with\r\nthe invective tempered. “You shall receive your regular tribute,” he said\r\nin slow sentences to imaginary Ottomans, whom he seemed to hold before his\r\nvisual eye, “you shall retain your titular sovereignty, your empire shall\r\nnot be invaded, but never again as the years roll in their course, so far\r\nas it is in our power to determine, never again shall the hand of violence\r\nbe raised by you, never again shall the flood-gates of lust be open to\r\nyou, never again shall the dire refinements of cruelty be devised by you\r\nfor the sake of making mankind miserable.”\r\n\r\nOnce again, it was not words that made the power of the orator, it was the\r\nrelation in purpose, feeling, and conviction between him and his audience.\r\nHe forced them into unity with himself by the vivid strength of his\r\nresolution and imagination; he could not believe that his own power of\r\nemotion was not theirs too:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    On Monday morning last between four and five o’clock, I was\r\n    rattling down from Euston station through the calm and silent\r\n    streets of London, when there was not a footfall to disturb them.\r\n    Every house looked so still, that it might well have been a\r\n    receptacle of the dead. But as I came through those long lines of\r\n    streets, I felt it to be an inspiring and a noble thought that in\r\n    every one of these houses there were intelligent human beings, my\r\n    fellow-countrymen, who when they woke would give many of their\r\n    earliest thoughts, aye and some of their most energetic actions,\r\n    to the terrors and sufferings of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this was the very spirit of Milton’s imperishable sonnet upon the late\r\nMassacre in Piedmont; the spirit that made Cromwell say that the slaughter\r\nin the Waldensian valleys “came as near to his heart as if his own nearest\r\nand dearest had been concerned.”\r\n\r\n(M178) Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, who had been one of the most\r\nresponsible promoters of the policy of the Crimean war, told Mr. Gladstone\r\nof his own strong impression (Sept. 10), that the formidable crisis would\r\nnot have arisen, had England in the first instance taken part with the\r\nother Powers. Not that he believed that Russia was always and fully\r\ntrustworthy, but she was so circumstanced then as to be open to the full\r\nbearing of our moral influence. Six weeks later Lord Stratford again\r\nexpressed his unaltered opinion that if in the beginning England had taken\r\nher place at the side of the three emperors, the cloud on the horizon\r\nwould never have swelled out into its present colossal proportions. “It\r\nseems to me,” he said, “that Russia has been gradually drawn into a\r\nposition from which she can hardly retreat with credit.” “Whatever shades\r\nof difference appear in our opinions,” he told Mr. Gladstone in September,\r\n“may be traced in a great measure to your having made Bulgaria the main\r\nobject of your appeal, whereas the whole eastern question was my theme,\r\nand the Bulgarian atrocities, execrable as they were, only a part of it.”\r\nThe truth was that in making the atrocious doings in Bulgaria the main\r\nobject of his appeal, Mr. Gladstone had both displayed a sure instinct as\r\nto the most effective method of popular approach, and at the same time did\r\njustice to his own burning and innate hatred of all cruelty and\r\noppression, whether in Bourbon or Bashi-Bazouk. Humanity was at the root\r\nof the whole matter; and the keynote of this great crusade was the\r\nassociation of humanity with a high policy worthy of the British name.\r\n\r\nOctober was passed in a round of visits to great houses, the popular tide\r\nin the north still appearing to rise around him. To Lord Granville he\r\nwrites:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Alnwick Castle, Oct. 3, 1876._—We have advanced thus far in a\r\n    northern and eastern tour, and we hope to be at Castle Howard on\r\n    Wednesday. I left home at this particular time partly with ideas\r\n    of health and relaxation, partly because I thought that being\r\n    everywhere and nowhere I should escape a little from the turmoil\r\n    of the time. Through Cheshire and Lancashire we accomplished the\r\n    first stage of our journey to Raby without witnessing any\r\n    particular indication of public sentiment; and this rather\r\n    encouraged our extending a little the circle of our visits, which\r\n    I am now half tempted to regret. For at every point I have had the\r\n    greatest difficulty in maintaining any show of privacy, and\r\n    avoiding strong manifestations. I never saw such keen exhibitions\r\n    of the popular feeling, appearing so to pervade all ranks and\r\n    places. A tory county member said to my wife two days ago, “If\r\n    there were a dissolution now, I should not get a vote.” This may\r\n    be in some degree peculiar to the northerners with their strong\r\n    character and deep emotions....\r\n\r\n    _Castle Howard, Oct. 7, 1876._—Before receiving your letter of the\r\n    5th, I had been driven to the conclusion that I must make a\r\n    further utterance, following the actual course of the\r\n    transactions. And upon the whole I adhere to this conclusion,\r\n    notwithstanding your opinion, to which I attach great weight.\r\n    There is a great difference in our situations, which I think\r\n    accounts for this difference of view. I found Ailesbury, of\r\n    course, full of friendship and loyalty to you, but disposed to\r\n    regret that you had not been able to see your way to a more\r\n    advanced and definite policy. I told him that I found no cause for\r\n    surprise in your reserve, and thought you held yourself in hand\r\n    for the purpose of holding your party in hand—a view which I think\r\n    he more or less embraced. Now, I have not your responsibilities to\r\n    the party, but I have for the moment more than your\r\n    responsibilities to the country, in this sense that I feel myself\r\n    compelled to advise from time to time upon the course of that\r\n    national movement which I have tried hard to evoke, and assist in\r\n    evoking. I regard myself as an outside workman, engaged in the\r\n    preparation of materials, which you and the party will probably\r\n    have to manipulate and then to build into a structure. For though\r\n    I do not wish to shut the door upon the government, I despair of\r\n    them, after so many invitations and so many refusals....\r\n\r\n\r\n(M179) To Madame Novikoff, a Russian lady who at this time began to\r\nexercise a marked influence upon the opinions of important men with much\r\ninfluence on the opinions of many other people,(341) he indicated some\r\ndoubtful symptoms:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, Oct. 17, 1876._—There is an undoubted and smart rally\r\n    on behalf of Turkey in the metropolitan press. It is in the main\r\n    representative of the ideas and opinions of what are called the\r\n    upper ten thousand. From this body there has never on any occasion\r\n    within my memory proceeded the impulse that has prompted, and\r\n    finally achieved, _any_ of the great measures which in the last\r\n    half century have contributed so much to the fame and happiness of\r\n    England. They did not emancipate the dissenters, Roman catholics,\r\n    and Jews. They did not reform the parliament. They did not\r\n    liberate the negro slave. They did not abolish the corn law. They\r\n    did not take the taxes off the press. They did not abolish the\r\n    Irish established church. They did not cheer on the work of\r\n    Italian freedom and reconstitution. Yet all these things have been\r\n    done; and done by other agencies than theirs, and despite their\r\n    opposition. When I speak of _them_, I speak of course of the\r\n    majority among them. Unhappily, the country is understood abroad\r\n    mainly through the metropolitan press.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was no sooner back at Hawarden than he fell to work on subsidiary\r\nbranches of the question of questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 22._—Worked hard and finished my paper on Russia in\r\n    Turkestan, and sent it off. Criminal justice on Sunday! But it is\r\n    for peace. 24.—To London. 27.—Up at 6. Went with Harry to Dover,\r\n    saw him off on board the packet and pier [on his way to India].\r\n    Drove over to Walmer, reviewed the place, saw Lord Granville and\r\n    Sir W. James. Returned to London, and at 9.30 to the Gaiety, saw a\r\n    miserable burlesque of which I had heard a most inviting but false\r\n    account. 28.—To Hawarden. 31.—Tennyson and H. T. came. _Nov.\r\n    1._—Tennyson read to us his _Harold_. It took near 2-½ hours. Walk\r\n    with him and a party. 2.—Read Bagehot on Lord Spencer’s\r\n    _Life_—very clever, very imperfect. Conversation with Tennyson on\r\n    future retribution and other matters of theology. He has not\r\n    thought, I conceive, systematically or thoroughly upon them, but\r\n    is much alarmed at the prospect of the loss of belief. He left us\r\n    at one. Walk and long conversation with Lord Acton, who seems in\r\n    opinion to go beyond Döllinger, though in certain things he stops\r\n    short of him. 8.—Read aloud the debate of the first _Iliad_ from\r\n    Pope. 9.—Read aloud my version of the Assembly—_Iliad_ i. 10.—Read\r\n    aloud Lord Derby’s and Cowper’s version of the Assembly. 14.—The\r\n    Olympian part of _Iliad_ I. in Pope’s version aloud, and then my\r\n    own. 17.—We went to Liverpool, where we attended the theatre to\r\n    see Pennington in _Hamlet_. It was really excellent. I never was\r\n    so well received in that town. 21.—Finished revision of my MS.,\r\n    “The Hellenic Factor in the Eastern Problem,” and sent it to\r\n    press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Lord Mayor’s feast in November, the prime minister used menacing\r\nlanguage. The policy of England, he said, was peace, but no country was so\r\nwell prepared for war as ours. If England were to enter into a righteous\r\nwar, her resources were inexhaustible. “She is not a country that, when\r\nshe enters into a campaign, has to ask herself whether she can support a\r\nsecond or a third campaign. She enters into a campaign which she will not\r\nterminate till right is done.” This was a hardly veiled threat to Russia,\r\nit was encouragement to Turkey, it was incitement to a war party in Great\r\nBritain. “The provocation offered by Disraeli at the Guildhall,” wrote Mr.\r\nGladstone, “is almost incredible. Some new lights about his Judaic feeling\r\nin which he is both consistent and conscientious have come in upon me.”\r\n\r\nStill the general feeling was strongly adverse to any action on behalf of\r\nTurkey. Mr. Gladstone eagerly noted even the most trivial incident that\r\npointed this way. “Yesterday night,” he wrote (Nov. 26), “in the tory town\r\nof Liverpool, when Othello was being acted, and the words were reached\r\n‘The Turks are drowned,’ the audience rose in enthusiasm and interrupted\r\nthe performance for some time with their cheering. These things are not\r\nwithout meaning.” Men who commonly stood aside from political activity\r\nwere roused. “Mr. Carlyle,” says Mr. Ruskin, “Mr. Froude, and several\r\nother men of creditable name gathered together at call of Mr. Gladstone as\r\nfor a great national need, together with other men of more retired\r\nmind—Edward Burne-Jones for one, and myself for another.”\r\n\r\n(M180) The reply to the Guildhall speech was a conference at St. James’s\r\nHall (Dec. 8), one of the most remarkable gatherings of representative men\r\nof every type and from every part of the kingdom ever held in this\r\ncountry. “I have most flourishing accounts of the progress of preparations\r\nfor the conference of which I have been a promoter from the beginning.\r\nThey urge me to speak on the 8th, but I should much prefer that others\r\nshould put themselves in the foreground.” Besides the eminent politicians,\r\ngreat territorial magnates were there, and men of letters, and divines of\r\nvarious churches, and men who had never been to a militant assembly in\r\ntheir lives before,—all with a resolute purpose expressed by Mr.\r\nTrevelyan, “No matter how the prime minister may finger the hilt of the\r\nsword, the nation will take care that it never leaves the scabbard.” Mr.\r\nGladstone reached London a day or two before. On the 8th, he enters:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    8.—Made notes and extracts for speech. Attended the meetings at\r\n    St. James’s Hall, 12-1-½ and 4-8. Spoke (I fear) 1-½ hours with\r\n    some exertion, far from wholly to my satisfaction. The meetings\r\n    were great, notable, almost historical.\r\n\r\n    The day after this important and impressive gathering he was back\r\n    at Hawarden, busy at his article upon the life of the Prince\r\n    Consort. Then came Christmas day,—“The most solemn I have known\r\n    for long; I see that eastward sky of storm and of underlight!”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a suggestion from the London foreign office, a conference of the great\r\nPowers met at Constantinople in the middle of December. Lord Salisbury\r\nwent as the representative of England. To a correspondent Mr. Gladstone\r\nspoke of this as an excellent selection:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I think it right at once to give you my opinion of Lord Salisbury,\r\n    whom I know pretty well in private. He has little foreign or\r\n    eastern knowledge, and little craft; he is rough of tongue in\r\n    public debate, but a great gentleman in private society; he is\r\n    very remarkably clever, of unsure judgment, but is above anything\r\n    mean; has no Disraelite prejudices; keeps a conscience, and has\r\n    plenty of manhood and character. In a word the appointment of Lord\r\n    Salisbury to Constantinople is the best thing the government have\r\n    yet done in the eastern question.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the conference met, so it ran a usual course, and then vanished. The\r\nPowers were in complete accord as to the demands that were to be made upon\r\nTurkey for the protection of the unfortunate Christian rayahs. The Turk in\r\njust confidence that he should find a friend, rejected them, and the\r\nenvoys departed to their homes. Mr. Gladstone, however, found comfort in\r\nthe thought that by the agitation two points had been gained: the\r\nre-establishment of the European concert, and extrication from a\r\ndisgraceful position of virtual complicity with Turkey.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1877 he wrote a second pamphlet,(342) because a speech in\r\nthe House could not contain detail enough, and because parliamentary\r\ntradition almost compelled a suspension of discussion while ministers were\r\nsupposed to be engaged in concert with other Powers in devising a\r\npractical answer to Russian inquiry. He found that it “produced no great\r\nimpression,” the sale not going beyond six or seven thousand copies.\r\nStill, the gala remained from the proceeding in the autumn, that the\r\ngovernment dared not say they had nothing to do with the condition of the\r\nChristian rayahs of Turkey, and any idea of going to war for Turkey was\r\nout of the question.\r\n\r\nPublic feeling had waxed very hot, yet without any clear precision of\r\nopinion or purpose on the side opposed to Mr. Gladstone’s policy of\r\nemancipation. Dean Church (Dec. 1876) describes how “everybody was very\r\nsavage with everybody about Turks and Russians: I think I never remember\r\nsuch an awkward time for meeting people (until you know you are on the\r\nsame side) except at the height of the Tractarian row.”(343)\r\n\r\n(M181) A little later we have one of the best pictures of him that I know,\r\nfrom the warm and vivid hand of J. R. Green, the historian:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 21, 1877._—Last night I met Gladstone—it will always be a\r\n    memorable night to me; Stubbs was there, and Goldwin Smith, and\r\n    Humphry Sandwith, and Mackenzie Wallace, whose great book on\r\n    Russia is making such a stir, besides a few other nice people; but\r\n    one forgets everything in Gladstone himself, in his perfect\r\n    naturalness and grace of manner, his charming abandon of\r\n    conversation, his unaffected modesty, his warm ardour for all that\r\n    is noble and good. I felt so proud of my leader—the chief I have\r\n    always clung to through good report and ill report—because, wise\r\n    or unwise as he might seem in this or that, he was always noble of\r\n    soul. He was very pleasant to me, and talked of the new historic\r\n    school he hoped we were building up as enlisting his warmest\r\n    sympathy. I wish you could have seen with what a glow he spoke of\r\n    the Montenegrins and their struggle for freedom; how he called on\r\n    us who wrote history to write what we could of that long fight for\r\n    liberty! And all through the evening not a word to recall his\r\n    greatness amongst us, simple, natural, an equal among his equals,\r\n    listening to every one, drawing out every one, with a force and a\r\n    modesty that touched us more than all his power.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another letter, says the same ardent man, “I begin to see that there\r\nmay be a truer wisdom in the ‘humanitarianism’ of Gladstone than in the\r\npurely political views of Disraeli. The sympathies of peoples with\r\npeoples, the sense of a common humanity between nations, the aspirations\r\nof nationalities after freedom and independence, _are_ real political\r\nforces; and it is just because Gladstone owns them as forces, and Disraeli\r\ndisowns them, that the one has been on the right side, and the other on\r\nthe wrong in parallel questions such as the upbuilding of Germany or\r\nItaly. I think it will be so in this upbuilding of the Sclave.”(344)\r\n\r\nIt was my own good fortune to pass two days with him at this moment at\r\nHigh Elms. Huxley and Playfair were of the party. Mr. Gladstone had with\r\nhim the printer’s proofs of his second pamphlet, and was in full glow\r\nagainst Turkish terrorism and its abettors. This strong obsession could\r\nnot be concealed, nor was there any reason why it should be; it made no\r\ndifference in his ready courtesy and kindness of demeanour, his\r\nwillingness to enter into other people’s topics, his pliant force and\r\nalacrity of mind. On the Sunday afternoon Sir John Lubbock, our host, took\r\nus all up to the hilltop whence in his quiet Kentish village Darwin was\r\nshaking the world. The illustrious pair, born in the same year, had never\r\nmet before. Mr. Gladstone as soon as seated took Darwin’s interest in\r\nlessons of massacre for granted, and launched forth his thunderbolts with\r\nunexhausted zest. His great, wise, simple, and truth-loving listener,\r\nthen, I think, busy on digestive powers of the drosera in his green-house,\r\nwas intensely delighted. When we broke up, watching Mr. Gladstone’s erect\r\nalert figure as he walked away, Darwin, shading his eyes with his hand\r\nagainst the evening rays, said to me in unaffected satisfaction, “What an\r\nhonour that such a great man should come to visit me!” Too absorbed in his\r\nown overwhelming conflict with the powers of evil, Mr. Gladstone makes no\r\nmention of his afternoon call, and only says of the two days that “he\r\nfound a notable party, and made interesting conversation,” and that he\r\n“could not help liking” one of the company, then a stranger to him. In his\r\nabsence at church, we were talking of the qualities that send men forward\r\nand keep them back. “I should like to know,” cried Huxley, “what would\r\nkeep such a man as that back,” pointing to where Mr. Gladstone had been\r\nsitting; “why, put him in the middle of a moor, with nothing in the world\r\nbut his shirt, and you could not prevent him from being anything he\r\nliked.” And Huxley was as far as possible from being a Gladstonian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M182) Events meanwhile had moved. The failure of the conference in\r\nDecember, and the futility of an instrument known as the London protocol\r\ndevised in March, led up to a declaration of war by Russia against Turkey\r\nin April. We now come to an episode in this controversy, that excited\r\nlively passions at the moment, and subjected Mr. Gladstone’s relation to\r\nhis party to a strain that would have been profoundly painful, if his\r\nheroic intensity had not for the time taken him beyond the region of pain\r\nand pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Granville. 73 Harley Street, April 23, 1877._—The\r\n    protocol, the refusal of Turkey, the insistence of Russia, have\r\n    been followed to-night by the announcement that the Russian Chargé\r\n    has suspended relations with Turkey. Is not the moment now come\r\n    for raising the rather stiff question whether a policy, or a\r\n    substantive motion, is to be submitted to parliament? I hold back\r\n    from a conclusion as long as I can, that I may benefit by the\r\n    views of others. But it is perfectly plain that Salisbury is at a\r\n    discount, and that the government grow more Turkish every day;\r\n    reasonably plain that some grave arguments against moving have now\r\n    lost their force. My own inclination is towards a series of\r\n    resolutions with such points as are rudely indicated on the\r\n    enclosed scrap. Please to let me have it again at some time; I\r\n    have no copy.\r\n\r\n    _To the Duke of Argyll. April 26, 1877._—I have drawn some\r\n    resolutions of which I intend to give notice to-day unless the\r\n    leaders will move. If they will move, though they may say much\r\n    less, I can support them and express my fuller ideas in a speech.\r\n    I cannot leave my bed, but notice will be given in my name.\r\n\r\n    _From the Diary. April 27, 1877._—Ill in the night; kept my bed.\r\n    Saw Dr. Clark twice. Saw Mr. Goschen, Lord Wolverton, Mr. Bright,\r\n    Lord Frederick Cavendish. This day I took my decision, a severe\r\n    one, in face of my not having a single approver in the _upper_\r\n    official circle. But had I in the first days of September asked\r\n    the same body whether I ought to write my pamphlet, I believe the\r\n    unanimous answer would have been No. Arranged for the first\r\n    (general) notice to be given, in my absence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were five in number, and the pith of them was, first, an\r\nexpression of complaint against the Porte; second, a declaration that, in\r\nthe absence of guarantees on behalf of the subject populations, the Porte\r\nhad lost all claim to support, moral or material; third, a desire that\r\nBritish influence should be employed on behalf of local liberty and\r\nself-government in the disturbed provinces; fourth, this influence to be\r\naddressed to promoting the concert of the Powers in exacting from the\r\nPorte such changes as they might deem to be necessary for humanity and\r\njustice; fifth, an address to the crown accordingly. On the expediency of\r\nthese resolutions, at a moment when a war with many complexities had just\r\nbroken out, opinion in the party was divided. The official liberals and\r\ntheir special adherents doubted. The radicals below the gangway, headed by\r\nMr. Chamberlain and Sir Charles Dilke, supported the resolutions with\r\nenthusiasm. Adverse notices of the previous question were put upon the\r\npaper. Lord Granville wrote to Mr. Gladstone (May 2) that his colleagues\r\non the front opposition bench had met, and were still of opinion, “that it\r\nwas not opportune at this moment to move resolutions, and thought that the\r\nleast antagonistic course as regarded you would be to vote for one of the\r\nmotions announced for the previous question.” To the Duke of Argyll Mr.\r\nGladstone wrote on the 4th:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Our friends of the late cabinet have fallen into a sad series of\r\n    errors, some of which I fear will be greatly resented in the\r\n    country. To meet on Wednesday; to use the private pressure which\r\n    is being used, as I am told, against the resolutions; and above\r\n    all to have announced the result of the meeting in the papers of\r\n    yesterday; these form a combination, in my opinion, deplorable and\r\n    almost incredible. I shall do all in my power to avert\r\n    consequences, but my difficulties are greatly increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt looked as if a mortal split within the party were inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From the Diary. May 5._—The post brought me near 140 letters\r\n    to-day which took some hours to examine, but they are most\r\n    remarkable. Saw Lord Granville with Lord Wolverton. They opened\r\n    the means of bridging over the chasm inadvertently made; and I\r\n    readily went into the scheme. It was carried through by Granville\r\n    at a meeting of his friends after the Academy dinner, and he came\r\n    to me at Wolverton’s with Hartington to make known the result and\r\n    consider some details of execution. What they ask of me is really,\r\n    from my point of view, little more than nominal. They have in\r\n    truth been awakened as from a slumber by the extraordinary\r\n    demonstrations in the country. 3—4-½ attended the Academy\r\n    exhibition. 6-½-10-1/4 at the dinner; spoke for literature! My\r\n    reception surprised me, it was so good.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M183) What was asked was that he should consent to an amended form of his\r\nsecond resolution, declaring more simply and categorically that the Turk,\r\nby his misgovernment, had lost his claims. As to the other resolutions,\r\naccording to a common usage, it was at his choice to accept a division on\r\nthe first or first two, and not divide upon the rest. His speech, of\r\ncourse, would cover the ground of all the resolutions. This reduction was,\r\nas he truly said, “little more than nominal.” A friendly question was to\r\nbe put when the time came, and in reply he would state how things stood.\r\n\r\nThe critical day arrived, and not often has parliamentary excitement been\r\nso high. It was a battle of high national and even European policy, for\r\nEngland was now at the front; it was a battle between two sections of a\r\nparty; it was the ordeal of a man admitted to be the greatest in the\r\nHouse, and perhaps some of the onlookers felt much like the curious\r\nFlorentines, as they wondered what would happen to Savonarola and the\r\nmonks in the great Trial by Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From the Diary. May 7._—This day came in about 100 meetings and\r\n    say 200 letters or 250. Worked hard upon the blue book, and\r\n    references and notes for speech. House at 4-1/4. For over two\r\n    hours I was assaulted from every quarter, except the opposition\r\n    bench, which was virtually silent. Such a sense of solitary\r\n    struggle I never remember. At last I rose on the main question\r\n    nearly in despair as to the result; but resolved at least not to\r\n    fail through want of effort. I spoke 2-½ hours, voice lasting\r\n    well. House gradually came round and at the last was more than\r\n    good. It was over at 9.30. Never did I feel weaker and more\r\n    wormlike. Dinner at Sir W. James’s and H. of C. again\r\n    10-3/4-12-3/4. 8.—I am the spoiled child of sleep. This night was\r\n    an exception.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scene began with the question as preconcerted, put by Mr. Trevelyan.\r\nSuch moves never fail to provoke some measure of mockery, and this time\r\nboth regular opponents and opponents in more or less disguise thought that\r\nthey had got the monarch of the forest down. The situation was one that\r\nopened the way for Mr. Gladstone’s love of over-precision, and his various\r\nexplanations prolonged the wrangle. It lasted until the dinner-hour.\r\n“While many members,” says one observer, “were streaming out to dine and\r\nthose who remained looked dejectedly at their watches, Mr. Gladstone, who\r\nis sixty-eight years of age, sprang again to his feet, and without any\r\nsign of diminished spirit delivered a noble speech lasting two hours and a\r\nhalf. It was perhaps the greatest triumph of irrepressible moral and\r\nphysical vitality over depressing conditions that was ever won in the\r\nHouse of Commons.”(345)\r\n\r\nThe record of a distinguished eyewitness, himself one day to be prime\r\nminister, ought not to be omitted:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    There was one of those preliminary parliamentary debates—or series\r\n    of debates—which preceded the main business of the evening. In\r\n    this Mr. Gladstone had to speak not once or twice, but several\r\n    times, and it was not until hour after hour had passed in this\r\n    preliminary skirmish in a House hostile, impatient, and utterly\r\n    wearied, that he got up to present his case with that conviction\r\n    that he was right, which was his great strength as a speaker in\r\n    and out of the House. I never shall forget the impression that\r\n    speech left on my mind. As a mere feat of physical endurance it\r\n    was almost unsurpassed; as a feat of parliamentary courage,\r\n    parliamentary skill, parliamentary endurance, and parliamentary\r\n    eloquence, I believe it will always be unequalled.(346)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he drew to his close, he looked according to Mr. Forster, “_like an\r\ninspired man_,” and I have heard many hearers of cool temperament declare\r\nthe passage about the Montenegrins and onwards, to have been the most\r\nthrilling deliverance that could ever be conceived. Here is this noble\r\nperoration:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sir, there were other days when England was the hope of freedom.\r\n    Wherever in the world a high aspiration was entertained, or a\r\n    noble blow was struck, it was to England that the eyes of the\r\n    oppressed were always turned—to this favourite, this darling home\r\n    of so much privilege and so much happiness, where the people that\r\n    had built up a noble edifice for themselves would, it was well\r\n    known, be ready to do what in them lay to secure the benefit of\r\n    the same inestimable boon for others. You talk to me of the\r\n    established tradition and policy in regard to Turkey. I appeal to\r\n    an established tradition older, wider, nobler far—a tradition not\r\n    which disregards British interests, but which teaches you to seek\r\n    the promotion of these interests in obeying the dictates of honour\r\n    and justice. And, sir, what is to be the end of this? Are we to\r\n    dress up the fantastic ideas some people entertain about this\r\n    policy and that policy in the garb of British interests, and then,\r\n    with a new and base idolatry, fall down and worship them? Or are\r\n    we to look, not at the sentiment, but at the hard facts of the\r\n    case, which Lord Derby told us fifteen years ago—viz., that it is\r\n    the populations of those countries that will ultimately possess\r\n    them—that will ultimately determine their abiding condition? It is\r\n    to this fact, this law, that we should look. There is now before\r\n    the world a glorious prize. A portion of those unhappy people are\r\n    still as yet making an effort to retrieve what they have lost so\r\n    long, but have not ceased to love and to desire. I speak of those\r\n    in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Another portion—a band of heroes such\r\n    as the world has rarely seen—stand on the rocks of Montenegro, and\r\n    are ready now, as they have ever been during the 400 years of\r\n    their exile from their fertile plains, to sweep down from their\r\n    fastnesses and meet the Turks at any odds for the re-establishment\r\n    of justice and of peace in those countries. Another portion still,\r\n    the 5,000,000 of Bulgarians, cowed and beaten down to the ground,\r\n    hardly venturing to look upwards, even to their Father in heaven,\r\n    have extended their hands to you; they have sent you their\r\n    petition, they have prayed for your help and protection. They have\r\n    told you that they do not seek alliance with Russia, or with any\r\n    foreign power, but that they seek to be delivered from an\r\n    intolerable burden of woe and shame. That burden of woe and\r\n    shame—the greatest that exists on God’s earth—is one that we\r\n    thought united Europe was about to remove; but to removing which,\r\n    for the present, you seem to have no efficacious means of offering\r\n    even the smallest practical contribution. But, sir, the removal of\r\n    that load of woe and shame is a great and noble prize. It is a\r\n    prize well worth competing for. It is not yet too late to try to\r\n    win it. I believe there are men in the cabinet who would try to\r\n    win it, if they were free to act on their own beliefs and\r\n    aspirations. It is not yet too late, I say, to become competitors\r\n    for that prize; but be assured that whether you mean to claim for\r\n    yourselves even a single leaf in that immortal chaplet of renown,\r\n    which will be the reward of true labour in that cause, or whether\r\n    you turn your backs upon that cause and upon your own duty, I\r\n    believe, for one, that the knell of Turkish tyranny in these\r\n    provinces has sounded. So far as human eye can judge, it is about\r\n    to be destroyed. The destruction may not come in the way or by the\r\n    means that we should choose; but come this boon from what hands it\r\n    may, it will be a noble boon, and as a noble boon will gladly be\r\n    accepted by Christendom and the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe division, after a debate that lasted five days, resulted in 354 for\r\nministers, against 223 for Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of course if you had gone on alone, Lord Granville told him, you\r\n    would only have had either more or less than half the liberal\r\n    party. If Hartington had moved the first two resolutions, the\r\n    government would certainly have had some 160 or 170 majority. All\r\n    the malcontents behind the opposition front benches were obliged\r\n    to vote on Monday, in consequence of having so vigorously preached\r\n    allegiance during the previous ten days. As it is, the party voted\r\n    pretty well.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M184) “The assumed laughter of the conservatives,” he adds, “showed their\r\nvexation, and _some_ of the radicals showed their cards—that it is not the\r\neastern question, but the hopes of breaking up the party that really\r\nexcites them.” The radicals on their part were extremely sore at the\r\nwithdrawal of the resolutions. “Your goodness,” wrote their leading man to\r\nMr. Gladstone the following day, “has been abused in the interests of a\r\nsection of the party who deserve least at your hands. The current report\r\nin the lobbies last night, spread by these gentlemen, and easily believed\r\nby their friends, was that you had ‘caved in.’ ” Could he not take some\r\nfurther opportunity of showing that he had not abandoned the policy of\r\njoint intervention, and that the liberal party in the country had no\r\nreason to regret that they rose almost as one man to his call?\r\n\r\nAt first it was thought that the discussion had done good by impressing\r\nthe government with the desire of the country, if not for coercion at\r\nleast for real neutrality, and that Lord Beaconsfield had submitted to the\r\nbetter influences in the cabinet. It soon appeared that this had not\r\nhappened. “The fidelity of the party,” said Lord Granville, “and the large\r\nmajority have given Beaconsfield the lead, of which he has not been slow\r\nto avail himself. It is very serious.” The war in the Balkans went on; the\r\nTurks fought with valour and constancy: sufferings on both sides were\r\nfrightful. In England the sympathy with the miserable victims of Turkish\r\nmisrule became modified by the re-awakened jealousy of Russian power. Mr.\r\nGladstone held his ground with invincible tenacity against all comers. He\r\ntook his share in such parliamentary operations as were possible, but\r\nthese operations were necessarily fruitless, and the platform now for the\r\nfirst time became the effective field for moving national opinion.\r\n\r\nGreat parties of tourists from the northern and midland towns began to\r\nmake it a fashion to go on high pilgrimage to Hawarden, where besides a\r\nfine park they saw the most interesting man in the country, and had a good\r\nchance of hearing an eloquent speech, or watching a tree fall under the\r\nstroke of his vigorous arm. If they brought him the tribute of a casket or\r\nan axe or some cunning walking-stick, he was obliged to thank them, and if\r\nhe opened his lips to thank them, the all-engrossing theme was sure to\r\nwell up. Some of these earnest utterances jarred even on his admirers in\r\nthe press and out of it. Just so would critics in colleges and cathedral\r\ncloses have found Wesley and Whitefield in their evangelising mission\r\nnorth, south, east, and west, excessive, exaggerated, indiscreet, and\r\ndeficient in good taste. They could not understand how one supposed to be\r\nso knowing in all the manœuvres of parliament and party, was at the same\r\ntime so naïf. This curious simplicity in fact marked him in all the\r\nmovements into which he put his heart. Like every other grand\r\nmissionary—the abolitionist, the gospel missionary, the free trader, the\r\npeace man, the temperance man—he could not believe that the truths,\r\narguments, and appeals, of which he was the bearer, could fail to strike\r\nin all who heard them the same fire that blazed in bosoms fervid as his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nHe went to Birmingham and was received with tumultuous acclamations by\r\nmany tens of thousands:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _May 31._—[Hawarden.] Off before 11. Reached Birmingham at 3-1/4.\r\n    A triumphal reception. Dinner at Mr. Chamberlain’s. Meeting 7 to\r\n    9-½, half occupied by my speech. A most intelligent and duly\r\n    appreciative audience—but they were 25,000 and the building I\r\n    think of no acoustic merits, so that the strain was excessive. A\r\n    supper followed. _June 1._—Breakfast party 9.30. Much conversation\r\n    on the Birmingham school board system. Off at 10.45 to Enfield\r\n    factory, which consumed the forenoon in a most interesting survey\r\n    with Colonel Dickson and his assistants. Then to the fine (qy.\r\n    overfine?) board school, where addresses were presented and I\r\n    spoke over half an hour on politics. After luncheon to the town\r\n    hall; address from the corporation, made a municipal speech of say\r\n    20 minutes. A good deal of movement in the streets with us even\r\n    to-day. Thence to the Oratory and sat with Dr. Newman.(347) Saw\r\n    Mr. Chamberlain’s very pleasing children. Then to the dinner,\r\n    spoke again. To Hagley at 11.5.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell was, it said of this visit by Dale, that strenuous whole-hearted man,\r\n“Forsaken or but feebly supported by many of those with whom he had shared\r\nmany glorious conflicts, and who owed to him their place and fame, his\r\ncourage remained undaunted, and his enthusiasm for righteousness and\r\nfreedom unquenched.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone described, the general situation in a letter to a\r\ncorrespondent out of England:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I cannot say much for the conduct of the Powers. That of the pope\r\n    and his court has been vile; Manning and most part of Ireland have\r\n    followed suit; France and Germany are thinking of themselves and\r\n    one another; and Italy, for fear of the pope, is obliged to look\r\n    very much to Germany. Austria is to some extent in a false\r\n    position. For us there is no excuse: there was no difficulty\r\n    whatever in our doing our duty. I have said in parliament, and I\r\n    deeply feel, it is the most deplorable chapter of our foreign\r\n    policy since the peace of 1815. The good cause has been further\r\n    weakened by the bad conduct, in varying degrees, of many races,\r\n    Magyars and Jews above all. You see I cannot help filling up my\r\n    paper with this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July he made a pleasure trip in one of Sir Donald Currie’s steamers,\r\nfrom London to Dartmouth. “We set out at 10.20,” he says, “for the docks.\r\nStarted in the _Dublin Castle_ at noon. We spent the night at the Nore,\r\ngood weather, kind reception, splendid fare. The Cape deputies came with\r\nus as far as Gravesend.” Among these deputies was Mr. Kruger.\r\n\r\nIn October he paid his first and only visit to Ireland. It lasted little\r\nmore than three weeks, and did not extend beyond a very decidedly English\r\nPale. He stayed in great houses, was feasted by the provost of Trinity, in\r\nspite of disestablishment, and he had a friendly conversation with\r\nCardinal Cullen, in spite of Vaticanism. “You know, Mr. Gladstone,” said\r\nthe Cardinal, “we could have given you a warmer reception if it had not\r\nbeen for certain pamphlets which we in Ireland did not like very well.” He\r\nreceived the freedom of the city of Dublin, broke bread with the Duke of\r\nMarlborough at the vice-regal lodge, admired the picturesque site of the\r\ncastle at Kilkenny, enjoyed sympathetic talks with host and hostess at\r\nAbbeyleix, and delighted in the curious antiquities and exquisite natural\r\nbeauties of the county of Wicklow. Of the multitudes of strange things\r\ndistinctively Irish, he had little chance of seeing much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V. A Tumultuous Year. (1878)\r\n\r\n\r\n    On these great questions, which cut so deep into heart and mind,\r\n    the importance of taking what they think the best course for the\r\n    question will often seem, even to those who have the most just\r\n    sense of party obligation, a higher duty than that of party\r\n    allegiance.—GLADSTONE (_to Granville_, 1878).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nOf 1878 Mr. Gladstone spoke as “a tumultuous year.” In January, after a\r\nfierce struggle of five months in the Balkan passes, the Russian forces\r\novercame the Turkish defence, and by the end of January had entered\r\nAdrianople and reached the Sea of Marmora. Here at San Stefano a treaty of\r\npeace was made at the beginning of March. The last word of the eastern\r\nquestion, as Lord Derby said in those days, is this: Who is to have\r\nConstantinople? No great Power would be willing to see it in the hands of\r\nany other great Power, no small Power could hold it at all, and as for\r\njoint occupation, all such expedients were both dangerous and\r\ndoubtful.(348) This last word now seemed to be writing itself in capital\r\nletters. Russia sent the treaty to the Powers, with the admission that\r\nportions of it affecting the general interests of Europe could not be\r\nregarded as definitive without general concurrence. A treaty between\r\nRussian and Turk within the zone of Constantinople and almost in sight of\r\nSt. Sophia, opened a new and startling vista to English politicians.\r\nPowerful journalists, supposed to be much in the confidence of ministers,\r\ndeclared that if peace were ultimately concluded on anything like the\r\nterms proposed, then beyond all doubt the outworks of our empire were\r\ngone, and speedy ruin must begin. About such a situation there had been\r\nbut one opinion among our statesmen for many generations. Until Mr.\r\nGladstone, “all men held that such a state of things [as the Russians at\r\nConstantinople] would bring the British empire face to face with\r\nruin.”(349)\r\n\r\n(M185) Before the treaty of San Stefano, an angry panic broke out in parts\r\nof England. None of the stated terms of British neutrality were violated\r\neither by the treaty or its preliminaries, but even when no Russian force\r\nwas within forty miles of Constantinople, the cabinet asked for a vote of\r\nsix millions (January), and a few days later the British fleet passed the\r\nDardanelles. Two years earlier, Mr. Gladstone had wished that the fleet\r\nshould go to Constantinople as a coercive demonstration against the Porte;\r\nnow, in 1878, the despatch of the fleet was a demonstration against\r\nRussia, who had done alone the work of emancipation that in Mr.\r\nGladstone’s view should have been done, and might have been done without\r\nwar by that concert of the Powers from which England had drawn back. The\r\nconcert of the Powers that our withdrawal had paralysed would have revived\r\nquickly enough, if either Austria or Germany had believed that the Czar\r\nreally meant to seize Constantinople. “I have done my best,” wrote Mr.\r\nGladstone to a friend, “against the vote of six millions; a foolish and\r\nmischievous proposition. The liberal leaders have, mistakenly as I think,\r\nshrunk at the last moment from voting. But my opinion is that the liberal\r\nparty in general are firmly opposed to the vote as a silly, misleading,\r\nand mischievous measure.” He both spoke and voted. The opinion of his\r\nadherents was that his words, notwithstanding his vote, were calculated to\r\ndo more to throw oil on the troubled waters, than either the words or the\r\nabstention of the official leader.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the British fleet with the nominal object of protecting\r\nlife and property at Constantinople, was immediately followed by the\r\nadvance of Russian troops thirty miles nearer to Constantinople with the\r\nsame laudable object. The London cabinet only grew the wilder in its\r\nProjects, among them being a secret expedition of Indian troops to seize\r\nCyprus and Alexandretta, with the idea that it would be fairer to the Turk\r\nnot to ask his leave. Two ministers resigned in succession, rather than\r\nfollow Lord Beaconsfield further in designs of this species.(350)\r\n\r\n“It is a bitter disappointment,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to Madame Novikoff,\r\n“to find the conclusion of one war, for which there was a weighty cause,\r\nfollowed by the threat of another, for which there is no adequate cause at\r\nall, and which will be an act of utter wickedness—if it comes to pass,\r\nwhich God forbid—on one side or on both. That unhappy subject of the bit\r\nof Bessarabia,(351) on which I have given you my mind with great freedom\r\n(for otherwise what is the use of my writing at all?) threatens to be in\r\npart the pretext and in part the cause of enormous mischief, and in my\r\nopinion to mar and taint at a particular point the immense glory which\r\nRussia had acquired, already complete in a military sense, and waiting to\r\nbe consummated in a moral sense too.”\r\n\r\nPublic men do not withstand war fevers without discomfort, as Bright had\r\nfound in the streets of Manchester when he condemned the Crimean war. One\r\nor two odious and unusual incidents now happened to Mr. Gladstone:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 24._—Between four and six, three parties of the populace\r\n    arrived here, the first with cheers, the two others hostile.\r\n    Windows were broken and much hooting. The last detachment was only\r\n    kept away by mounted police in line across the street both ways.\r\n    This is not very sabbatical. There is strange work behind the\r\n    curtain, if one could only get at it. The instigators are those\r\n    really guilty; no one can wonder at the tools.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon a little later (March 4):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Another gathering of people was held off by the police. I walked\r\n    down with C., and as a large crowd gathered, though in the main\r\n    friendly, we went into Dr. Clark’s, and then in a hansom off the\r\n    ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nStories were put about that Lord Beaconsfield reported the names of\r\ndissentient colleagues to the Queen. Dining with Sir Robert Phillimore\r\n(Jan. 17), Mr. Gladstone—\r\n\r\n\r\n    was emphatic and decided in his opinion that if the premier\r\n    mentioned to the Queen any of his colleagues who had opposed him\r\n    in the cabinet, he was guilty of great baseness and perfidy.\r\n    Gladstone said he had copies of 250 letters written by him to the\r\n    Queen, in none of which could a reference be found to the opinion\r\n    of his colleagues expressed in cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same occasion, by the way, Sir Robert notes: “Gladstone was careful\r\nto restrain the expression of his private feelings about Lord\r\nBeaconsfield, as he generally is.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M186) In the summer the famous congress assembled at Berlin (June 13 to\r\nJuly 13), with Lord Beaconsfield and Lord Salisbury as the representatives\r\nof Great Britain, to sanction, reject, or modify the treaty of San\r\nStefano. Before the congress met, the country received a shock that made\r\nmen stagger. While in London it was impossible to attempt to hold a\r\nmeeting in favour of peace, and even in the northern towns such meetings\r\nwere almost at the mercy of anybody who might choose to start a jingo\r\nchorus; while the war party exulted in the thought that military\r\npreparations were going on apace, and that the bear would soon be rent by\r\nthe lion; a document was one afternoon betrayed to the public, from which\r\nthe astounding fact appeared that England and Russia had already entered\r\ninto a secret agreement, by which the treaty of San Stefano was in\r\nsubstance to be ratified, with the single essential exception that the\r\nsouthern portion of Bulgaria was to be severed from the northern. The\r\ntreaty of Berlin became in fact an extensive partition of the Turkish\r\nempire, and the virtual ratification of the policy of bag and baggage. The\r\nSchouvaloff memorandum was not the only surprise. Besides the secret\r\nagreement with Russia, the British government had made a secret convention\r\nwith Turkey. By this convention England undertook to defend Turkey against\r\nRussian aggression in Asia, though concessions were made to Russia that\r\nrendered Asiatic Turkey indefensible; and Turkey was to carry out reforms\r\nwhich all sensible men knew to be wholly beyond her power. In payment for\r\nthis bargain, the Sultan allowed England to occupy and administer Cyprus.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the session Mr. Gladstone wound up his labours in parliament\r\nwith an extraordinarily powerful survey of all these great transactions.\r\nIts range, compass, and grasp are only matched by the simplicity and\r\nlucidity of his penetrating examination. It was on July 30:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Finished the protocols and worked up the whole subject. It loomed\r\n    very large and disturbed my sleep unusually. H. of C. Spoke 2-½\r\n    hours. I was in body much below par, but put on the steam\r\n    perforce. It ought to have been far better. The speech exhausted\r\n    me a good deal, as I was and am below par.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe sketched, in terse outline, the results of the treaty—the independence\r\nof Roumania, Servia, and Montenegro; the virtual independence of northern\r\nBulgaria; the creation in southern Bulgaria (under the name of Eastern\r\nRoumelia) of local autonomy, which must soon grow into something more.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, though Mr. Gladstone would have hoped for their\r\nfreedom from external control, had been handed over to Austria, but they\r\nwere at any rate free from the Ottoman. The cardinal fact was that eleven\r\nmillions of people formerly under Turkish rule, absolute or modified, were\r\nentirely exempted from the yoke. “Taking the whole of the provisions of\r\nthe treaty of Berlin together, I most thankfully and joyfully acknowledge\r\nthat great results have been achieved in the diminution of human misery\r\nand towards the establishment of human happiness and prosperity in the\r\nEast.” A great work of emancipation had been achieved for the Slavs of the\r\nTurkish empire. He deplored that equal regard had not been paid to the\r\ncase of the Hellenes in Thessaly and Epirus, though even in 1862,\r\nPalmerston and Russell were in favour of procuring the cession of Thessaly\r\nand Epirus to Greece. As for the baffling of Russian intrigue, it was true\r\nthat the Bulgaria of Berlin was reduced from the Bulgaria of San Stefano,\r\nbut this only furnished new incentives and new occasions for\r\nintrigue.(352) Macedonia and Armenia were left over.\r\n\r\n(M187) On the conduct of the two British plenipotentiaries at Berlin he\r\nspoke without undue heat, but with a weight that impressed even adverse\r\nhearers:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I say, sir, that in this congress of the great Powers, the voice\r\n    of England has not been heard in unison with the institutions, the\r\n    history, and the character of England. On every question that\r\n    arose, and that became a subject of serious contest in the\r\n    congress, or that could lead to any important practical result, a\r\n    voice has been heard from Lord Beaconsfield and Lord Salisbury\r\n    which sounded in the tones of Metternich, and not in the tones of\r\n    Mr. Canning, or of Lord Palmerston, or of Lord Russell. I do not\r\n    mean that the British government ought to have gone to the\r\n    congress determined to insist upon the unqualified prevalence of\r\n    what I may call British ideas. They were bound to act in\r\n    consonance with the general views of Europe. But within the limits\r\n    of fair differences of opinion, which will always be found to\r\n    arise on such occasions, I do affirm that it was their part to\r\n    take the side of liberty; and I do also affirm that as a matter of\r\n    fact they took the side of servitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agreement with Russia had in truth constantly tied their hands. For\r\ninstance, Lord Beaconsfield and Lord Salisbury might make to Russia as\r\nmany eloquent speeches as they liked against the restoration of\r\nBessarabia, but everybody in the room knew that the British government had\r\ntaken the lead in virtually assuring Russia that she had only to hold to\r\nher point and Bessarabia should again be hers. Most effective of all was\r\nhis exposure of the convention with Turkey, a proceeding by which we had\r\nundertaken, behind the back of Europe and against the treaty of Paris, to\r\nestablish a sole protectorate in Asiatic Turkey.(353) We had made a\r\ncontract of such impossible scope as to bind us to manage the reform of\r\nthe judicature, the police, the finances, the civil service of Turkey, and\r\nthe stoppage of the sources of corruption at Constantinople. The load, if\r\nwe took it seriously, was tremendous; if we did not take it seriously,\r\nthen what was the whole story of the reform of Asiatic Turkey, but a blind\r\nto excuse the acquisition of Cyprus? This great presentation of a broad\r\nand reasoned case contained a passage near its close, that had in it the\r\nkernel of Mr. Gladstone’s policy in the whole controversy that was now\r\ndrawing to an end:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I think we have lost greatly by the conclusion of this convention;\r\n    I think we have lost very greatly indeed the sympathy and respect\r\n    of the nations of Europe. I do not expect or believe that we shall\r\n    fall into that sort of contempt which follows upon weakness. I\r\n    think it to be one of the most threadbare of all the weapons of\r\n    party warfare when we hear, as we sometimes hear, on the accession\r\n    of a new government, that before its accession the government of\r\n    England had been despised all over the world, and that now on the\r\n    contrary she has risen in the general estimation, and holds her\r\n    proper place in the councils of nations. This England of ours is\r\n    not so poor and so weak a thing as to depend upon the reputation\r\n    of this or that administration; and the world knows pretty well of\r\n    what stuff she is made.... Now, I am desirous that the standard of\r\n    our material strength shall be highly and justly estimated by the\r\n    other nations of Christendom; but I believe it to be of still more\r\n    vital consequence that we should stand high in their estimation as\r\n    the lovers of truth, of honour, and of openness in all our\r\n    proceedings, as those who know how to cast aside the motives of a\r\n    narrow selfishness, and give scope to considerations of broad and\r\n    lofty principle. I value our insular position, but I dread the day\r\n    when we shall be reduced to a moral insularity.... The proceedings\r\n    have all along been associated with a profession as to certain\r\n    British interests, which although I believe them to be perfectly\r\n    fictitious and imaginary, have yet been pursued with as much zeal\r\n    and eagerness as if they had been the most vital realities in the\r\n    world. This setting up of our own interests, out of place, in an\r\n    exaggerated form, beyond their proper sphere, and not merely the\r\n    setting up of such interests, but the mode in which they have been\r\n    pursued, has greatly diminished, not, as I have said, the regard\r\n    for our material strength, but the estimation of our moral\r\n    standard of action, and consequently our moral position in the\r\n    world.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M188) Lord Beaconsfield lost some of his composure when Mr. Gladstone\r\ncalled the agreement between England and Turkey an insane convention. “I\r\nwould put this issue,” he said, “to an intelligent English jury: Which do\r\nyou believe most likely to enter into an insane convention? A body of\r\nEnglish gentlemen, honoured by the favour of their sovereign and the\r\nconfidence of their fellow-subjects, managing your affairs for five\r\nyears—I hope with prudence, and not altogether without success—or a\r\nsophistical rhetorician, inebriated with the exuberance of his own\r\nverbosity,”(354)—and so forth, in a strain of unusual commonness, little\r\nbefitting either Disraeli’s genius or his dignity. Mr. Gladstone’s speech\r\nthree days later was as free from all the excesses so violently described,\r\nas any speech that was ever made at Westminster.\r\n\r\nNo speech, however, at this moment was able to reduce the general\r\npopularity of ministers, and it was the common talk at the moment that if\r\nLord Beaconsfield had only chosen to dissolve, his majority would have\r\nbeen safe. Writing an article on “England’s Mission” as soon as the House\r\nwas up, Mr. Gladstone grappled energetically with some of the impressions\r\non which this popularity was founded. The _Pall Mall Gazette_ had set out\r\nthese impressions with its usual vigour. As Mr. Gladstone’s reply\r\ntraverses much of the ground on which we have been treading, I may as well\r\ntranscribe it:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The liberals, according to that ably written newspaper, have now\r\n    imbibed as a permanent sentiment a “distaste for national\r\n    greatness.” This distaste is now grown into matter of principle.\r\n    “The disgust at these principles of action ever grew in depth and\r\n    extent,” so that in the Danish, the American, and the\r\n    Franco-German wars, there was “an increasing portion of the nation\r\n    ready to engage in the struggle on almost any side,” as a protest\r\n    against the position that it was bound not to engage in it at all!\r\n    The climax of the whole matter was reached when the result of the\r\n    Alabama treaty displayed to the world an England overreached,\r\n    overruled, and apologetic. It certainly requires the astounding\r\n    suppositions, and the gross ignorance of facts, which the\r\n    journalist with much truth recites, to explain the manner in which\r\n    for some time past pure rhodomontade has not only done the work of\r\n    reasoning, but has been accepted as a cover for constant\r\n    miscarriage and defeat; and doctrines of national self-interest\r\n    and self-assertion as supreme laws have been set up, which, if\r\n    unhappily they harden into “permanent sentiment” and “matter of\r\n    principle,” will destroy all the rising hopes of a true public law\r\n    for Christendom, and will substitute for it what is no better than\r\n    the Communism of Paris enlarged and exalted into a guide of\r\n    international relations. It is perhaps unreasonable to expect that\r\n    minds in the condition of the “increasing portion” should on any\r\n    terms accept an appeal to history. But, for the sake of others,\r\n    not yet so completely emancipated from the yoke of facts, I simply\r\n    ask at what date it was that the liberal administrations of this\r\n    country adopted the “permanent sentiment” and the “matter of\r\n    principle” which have been their ruin? Not in 1859-60, when they\r\n    energetically supported the redemption and union of Italy. Not in\r\n    1861, when, on the occurrence of the Trent affair, they at a few\r\n    days’ notice despatched ten thousand men to Halifax. Not when, in\r\n    concert with Europe, they compelled the sultan to cut off the head\r\n    of his tyrannical pasha, and to establish a government in the\r\n    Lebanon not dependent for its vital breath on Constantinople. Not\r\n    when in 1863 they invited France to join in an _ultimatum_ to the\r\n    German Powers, and to defend Denmark with us against the intrigues\r\n    which Germany was carrying on under the plea of the Duke of\r\n    Augustenburg’s title to the Duchies; and when they were told by\r\n    Louis Napoleon in reply that that might be a great British\r\n    interest, but that it had no significance for France. Not when in\r\n    1870 they formed in a few days their double treaty for the defence\r\n    of Belgium. Does, then, the whole indictment rest on this—that, in\r\n    conformity with the solemn declaration of the European Powers at\r\n    Paris in 1856, they cured a deep-seated quarrel with America by\r\n    submitting to the risk of a very unjust award at Geneva; and\r\n    reconciled a sister nation, and effected a real forward step in\r\n    the march, of civilisation at about half the cost which the\r\n    present administration has recently incurred (but without paying\r\n    it) in agitating and disturbing Europe? Or is it that during all\r\n    those years, and many more years before them, while liberty and\r\n    public law were supported, and British honour vindicated,\r\n    territorial cupidity was not inflamed by the deeds or words of\r\n    statesmen, British interests were not set up as “the first and\r\n    great commandment,” and it was thought better to consolidate a\r\n    still undeveloped empire, which might well satisfy every ambition,\r\n    as it assuredly taxes to the utmost every faculty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M189) Though this was a “tumultuous year,” he noted with some complacency\r\nthat the work of his pen produced a thousand pounds. He laboured hard at\r\nhis Homeric primer, “just contriving to squeeze the completion of it into\r\nthe Easter recess”; wrote articles on the “Peace to Come,” on the “Paths\r\nof Honour and of Shame,” on the Abbé Martin, on “England’s Mission,” on\r\n“Electoral Statistics,” the “Friends and Foes of Russia,” and other\r\nmatters. He finished a paper on Iris, “a charming little subject, and for\r\nonce I am a little pleased with my work.” He toiled diligently at a\r\ncollection of old articles, which he christened _Gleanings_:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _November 14._—Worked on articles for reprint. Reperusal of\r\n    Patteson moves me unto tears.(355) What a height he reached! What\r\n    he did for God and the church. Praise to the Highest in the\r\n    height! 21.—This morning the rain on the trees was wonderful and\r\n    lovely. When it fell under the trees in the afternoon it was like\r\n    snow or small icicles an inch deep. 25.—Read _Maud_ once more,\r\n    and, aided by Doyle’s criticism, wrote my note of apology and\r\n    partial retractation.(356) The fact is I am wanting in that higher\r\n    poetical sense, which distinguishes the true artist.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain and again he gives himself the delightful refreshment of arranging\r\nhis books. He finds that he has 700 volumes of English poetry. “After 30\r\nhours my library is now in a passable state, and I enjoy, in Ruskin’s\r\nwords, ‘the complacency of possession and the pleasantness of order.’ ” He\r\nsat to Millais in the summer for what was to be the most popular of his\r\nportraits. “_July 5._—Went with C. to examine the Millais portrait, surely\r\na very fine work. 6—Sat once more to Millais, whose ardour and energy\r\nabout his picture inspire a strong sympathy.” On Good Friday he hears\r\nBach’s passion music, “most beautiful, yet not what I like for to-day.” In\r\nthe afternoon: “We drove down to Pembroke Lodge. For a few minutes saw\r\nLord Russell at his desire—a noble wreck. He recognised us and overflowed\r\nwith feeling.”\r\n\r\nIn December the Argylls and Mr. Ruskin came to Hawarden:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 12._—Mr. Ruskin’s health better, and no diminution of charm.\r\n    14.—Mr. Ruskin at dinner developed his political opinions. They\r\n    aim at the restoration of the Judaic system, and exhibit a mixture\r\n    of virtuous absolutism and Christian socialism. All in his\r\n    charming and modest manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a pleasing account of Ruskin at Hawarden privately printed, we may\r\ntake one passage:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Something like a little amicable duel took place at one time\r\n    between Ruskin and Mr. G., when Ruskin directly attacked his host\r\n    as a “leveller.” “You see _you_ think one man is as good as\r\n    another and all men equally competent to judge aright on political\r\n    questions; whereas I am a believer in an aristocracy.” And\r\n    straight came the answer from Mr. Gladstone, “Oh dear, no! I am\r\n    nothing of the sort. I am a firm believer in the aristocratic\r\n    principle—the rule of the best. I am an out-and-out\r\n    _inequalitarian_,” a confession which Ruskin treated with intense\r\n    delight, clapping his hands triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe true question against Ruskin’s and Carlyle’s school was how you are to\r\nget the rule of the best. Mr. Gladstone thought that freedom was the\r\nanswer; what path the others would have us tread, neither Ruskin nor his\r\nstormy teacher ever intelligibly told us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting on November 1 to Madame Novikoff, Mr. Gladstone said:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 1, ’78._—My opinion is that this government is moving to its\r\n    doom, and I hope the day of Lord Granville’s succession to it may\r\n    be within a twelvemonth. It is not to be desired that this should\r\n    take place at once. The people want a little more experience of\r\n    Beaconsfield toryism.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this experience, whatever be the precise name for it, now\r\ncame with disastrous promptitude, and the nation having narrowly escaped\r\none war, found itself involved in two. The peril of a conflict in Europe\r\nhad hardly passed, before the country found itself committed to an attack\r\nfor which the government themselves censured their high-handed agent, upon\r\nthe fiercest of the savage tribes of South Africa. A more formidable\r\nsurprise was the announcement that, by a headlong reversal of accepted\r\nIndian policy, war had been declared against the Ameer of Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI. Midlothian. (1879)\r\n\r\n\r\n    μηδὲ μαλθακὸς γένῃ.\r\n    τί δρᾴς? ἀνίστω, μή σε νικάτω κόπος.\r\n\r\n    ÆSCH. _Eum._, 74-128.\r\n\r\n    Turn not faint of heart. What doest thou? Let not weariness\r\n    overcome thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n(M190) After the general election of 1874, Mr. Gladstone resolved not\r\nagain to offer himself as candidate for Greenwich, and in 1878 he formally\r\ndeclined an invitation from the liberals in that constituency. At the end\r\nof the year it was intimated to him that he might have a safe seat in the\r\ncity of Edinburgh without a contest. In January 1879, more ambitious\r\ncounsels prevailed, and it was resolved by the liberal committee of\r\nMidlothian, with Lord Rosebery in the front, and amid infinite resolution,\r\nenthusiasm, and solid sense of responsibility, that Mr. Gladstone should\r\nbe invited to contest the metropolitan county of Scotland. Mr. Adam, the\r\nScotch whip, entered into the design, Lord Wolverton approved, and Lord\r\nGranville sent Adam a letter assenting. The sitting member was Lord\r\nDalkeith, eldest son of that Duke of Buccleuch who had been Mr.\r\nGladstone’s colleague in Peel’s cabinet nearly forty years before, and who\r\nhad left it in the memorable December of 1845. Parties had always been\r\nclosely balanced, although the tories had held their own pretty firmly,\r\nand only two contests had been fought for forty years. The Midlothian tory\r\nwas described to Mr. Gladstone as of the hardest and narrowest type, and\r\nthe battle was therefore sure to be fierce. Some of the voters, however,\r\ntold the canvassers that they would no longer support ministers. “If the\r\ngovernment continues much longer,” they said, “the whole nation will be in\r\nthe poorhouse.” The delight of the constituency was intense at the\r\nprospect of having for their champion one whom they described as the\r\ngreatest living Scotchman, and Adam (January 10, 1879) predicted a\r\nmajority of two hundred. Mr. Gladstone rapidly, but not without\r\ndeliberation, entered into the project. “I am now only anxious,” he wrote\r\nto Mr. Adam (January 11), “under your advice and Wolverton’s, about making\r\nthe ground sure before the plunge is taken; after it is taken, you may\r\ndepend on me.” On the same day he wrote to Lord Granville:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I believe you have been cognizant of the proceedings about the\r\n    county of Midlothian, which are now beginning to bear a practical\r\n    aspect. Generally, when one knows the tree is a large tree, yet on\r\n    coming close up to the trunk it looks twice as large as it did\r\n    before. So it is with this election. If it goes on, it will gather\r\n    into itself a great deal of force and heat, and will be very\r\n    prominent. Thus far I am not sure whether I have put the matter\r\n    pointedly before you, or have been content to assume your approval\r\n    of what I found Adam pressing strongly upon me. It will be a tooth\r\n    and nail affair.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Granville replied, that he was doing a “very plucky and\r\npublic-spirited thing.” “Your friends,” he said, “must begin working the\r\ncoach at once, but I should think you had better not appear too early in\r\nthe field. Act Louis XIV.” “Having received your approval,” Mr. Gladstone\r\ntold Lord Granville, “I wrote on the same day to Adam accordingly.” He\r\nthen went into details with his usual care and circumspection. When the\r\npublic were made aware of what was on foot, the general interest became\r\nhardly less lively all over the island than it was in the constituency\r\nitself. It was observed at the time how impossible many people seemed to\r\nfind it to treat anything done by Mr. Gladstone as natural and reasonable.\r\nNothing would appear to be a more simple and unobjectionable act than his\r\ncompliance with the request of the electors of Midlothian, yet “he was\r\nattacked as if he were guilty of some monstrous piece of vanity and\r\neccentricity.”(357) Relentless opponents amused themselves by saying that\r\n“Mr. Gladstone lives personally in Wales and intends to live politically\r\nin Scotland; and his most fervently held opinions, like the Celtic\r\npopulation of the island, have very much followed the same line of\r\nwithdrawal.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone described the general outlook in a letter to his son Henry\r\nin India (May 16):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The government declines, but no one can say at what rate.\r\n    Elections are tolerably satisfactory to us—not, I think, more. A\r\n    sure though evil instinct has guided them in choosing rather to\r\n    demoralise our finance, than to pay their way by imposing taxes,\r\n    but I do not see how they are long to escape this difficulty....\r\n    Our people look forward comfortably to the election. The\r\n    government people say they will not have it this year. But if we\r\n    come to the conclusion that we ought to have it, I am by no means\r\n    sure but that though a minority, we can force it by putting our\r\n    men into the field, and making it too uncomfortable for them to\r\n    continue twelve or fifteen months in hot water. I am safe in\r\n    Midlothian, unless they contrive a further and larger number of\r\n    faggot votes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam looked forward with alarm to the mischief that might be done if the\r\ngeneral election were to be protracted beyond the autumn of 1880. “In\r\norder to neutralise the present majority,” he told Mr. Gladstone, “they\r\nwill have to create faggots to a _disgraceful_ extent, but they are not\r\ntroubled by scruples of conscience.” The charity that thinketh no evil is\r\nperhaps less liberally given to party whips than even to other\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nApart from Midlothian Mr. Adam, in January 1879, said to Mr. Gladstone\r\nthat the liberals were helpless even in the best agricultural counties of\r\nEngland; that he saw no hope of improvement; they had neither candidates\r\nnor organisation in most of them, and there was no means that he knew of\r\n(and he had done all that he could) to wake them up. By November 1879, he\r\nreported that he had been carefully over the list, taking a very moderate\r\ncalculation of the chances at the coming election; and he believed they\r\nought to have a majority of 20 to 30, independent of home rulers. Mr.\r\nGladstone wrote to Lord Granville:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Aug. 6, ’79._—Salisbury’s speech indicates, and for several\r\n    reasons I should believe, that they intend sailing on the quiet\r\n    tack. Having proved their spirit, they will now show their\r\n    moderation. In other words they want all the past proceedings to\r\n    be in the main “stale fish” at the elections. Except financial\r\n    shuffling they will very likely commit no new enormity before the\r\n    election. In my view that means they will not supply any new\r\n    matter of such severe condemnation as what they have already\r\n    furnished. Therefore, my idea is, we should keep the old alive and\r\n    warm. This is the meaning of my suggestion as to autumn work,\r\n    rather than that I expect a dissolution. It seems to me good\r\n    policy to join on the proceedings of 1876-9 by a continuous\r\n    process to the dissolution. Should this happen, which I think\r\n    likely enough about March, there will have been no opportunity\r\n    immediately before it of stirring the country. I will not say our\r\n    defeat in 1874 was owing to the want of such an opportunity, but\r\n    it was certainly, I think, much aggravated by that want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M191) It was on November 24 that Mr. Gladstone soon after eight in the\r\nmorning quitted Liverpool for Edinburgh, accompanied by his wife and Miss\r\nGladstone. “The journey from Liverpool,” he enters, “was really more like\r\na triumphal procession.” Nothing like it had ever been seen before in\r\nEngland. Statesmen had enjoyed great popular receptions before, and there\r\nhad been plenty of cheering and bell-ringing and torchlight in individual\r\nplaces before. On this journey of a bleak winter day, it seemed as if the\r\nwhole countryside were up. The stations where the train stopped were\r\ncrowded, thousands flocked from neighbouring towns and villages to main\r\ncentres on the line of route, and even at wayside spots hundreds\r\nassembled, merely to catch a glimpse of the express as it dashed through.\r\nAt Carlisle they presented addresses, and the traveller made his first\r\nspeech, declaring that never before in the eleven elections in which he\r\nhad taken part, were the interests of the country so deeply at stake. He\r\nspoke again with the same moral at Hawick. At Galashiels he found a great\r\nmultitude, with an address and a gift of the cloth they manufactured. With\r\nbare head in the raw air, he listened to their address, and made his\r\nspeech; he told them that he had come down expressly to raise effectually\r\nbefore the people of the country the question in what manner they wished\r\nto be governed; it was not this measure or that, it was a system of\r\ngovernment to be upheld or overthrown. When he reached Edinburgh after\r\nnine hours of it, the night had fallen upon the most picturesque street in\r\nall our island, but its whole length was crowded as it has never been\r\ncrowded before or since by a dense multitude, transported with delight\r\nthat their hero was at last among them. Lord Rosebery, who was to be his\r\nhost, quickly drove with him amidst tumults of enthusiasm all along the\r\nroad to the hospitable shades of Dalmeny. “I have never,” Mr. Gladstone\r\nsays in his diary, “gone through a more extraordinary day.”\r\n\r\nAll that followed in a week of meetings and speeches was to match. People\r\ncame from the Hebrides to hear Mr. Gladstone speak. Where there were six\r\nthousand seats, the applications were forty or fifty thousand. The weather\r\nwas bitter and the hills were covered with snow, but this made no\r\ndifference in cavalcades, processions, and the rest of the outdoor\r\ndemonstrations. Over what a space had democracy travelled, and what a\r\ntransition for its champion of the hour, since the days half a century\r\nback when the Christ Church undergraduate, the disciple of Burke and\r\nCanning, had ridden in anti-reform processions, been hustled by reform\r\nmobs, and had prayed for the blessing of heaven on the House of Lords for\r\ntheir honourable and manly decision in throwing out the bill. Yet the\r\nwarmest opponent of popular government, even the Duke of Buccleuch\r\nhimself, might have found some balm for this extraordinary display of\r\npopular feeling, in the thought that it was a tribute to the most splendid\r\npolitical career of that generation; splendid in gifts and splendid in\r\nservice, and that it was repaid, moreover, with none of the flattery\r\nassociated with the name of demagogue. Mr. Gladstone’s counsels may have\r\nbeen wise or unwise, but the only flattery in the Midlothian speeches was\r\nthe manly flattery contained in the fact that he took care to address all\r\nthese multitudes of weavers, farmers, villagers, artisans, just as he\r\nwould have addressed the House of Commons,—with the same breadth and\r\naccuracy of knowledge, the same sincerity of interest, the same scruple in\r\nright reasoning, and the same appeal to the gravity and responsibility of\r\npublic life. An aristocratic minister, speaking at Edinburgh soon after,\r\nestimated the number of words in Mr. Gladstone’s Midlothian speeches in\r\n1879 at 85,840, and declared that his verbosity had become “a positive\r\ndanger to the commonwealth.” Tory critics solemnly declared that such\r\nperformances were an innovation on the constitution, and aggravated the\r\nevil tendencies of democracy.(358) Talk of this kind did not really impose\r\nfor an instant on any man or woman of common sense.\r\n\r\n(M192) Oratory ever since the days of Socrates, and perhaps long before,\r\nhas been suspected as one of the black arts; and both at the time and\r\nafterwards Mr. Gladstone’s speeches in his first Midlothian campaign were\r\ndisparaged, as I have just said, as sentiment rather than politics, as\r\nsophistry not sound reason, as illusory enchantment not solid and\r\nsubsisting truth. We are challenged to show passages destined to\r\nimmortality. With all admiration for the effulgent catalogue of British\r\norators, and not forgetting Pitt on the slave trade, or Fox on the\r\nWestminster scrutiny, or Sheridan on the begums of Oude, or Plunket on the\r\ncatholic question, or Grattan, or Canning, or Brougham, we may perhaps ask\r\nwhether all the passages that have arrived at this degree of fame and\r\ngrandeur, with the exception of Burke, may not be comprised in an\r\nextremely slender volume. The statesman who makes or dominates a crisis,\r\nwho has to rouse and mould the mind of senate or nation, has something\r\nelse to think about than the production of literary masterpieces. The\r\ngreat political speech, which for that matter is a sort of drama, is not\r\nmade by passages for elegant extract or anthologies, but by personality,\r\nmovement, climax, spectacle, and the action of the time. All these\r\nelements Midlothian witnessed to perfection.\r\n\r\nIt was my fortune to be present at one whole day of these performances.\r\n“An overpowering day,” Mr. Gladstone calls it in his diary (December 5,\r\n1879). “After a breakfast-party,” he says, “I put my notes in order for\r\nthe afternoon. At twelve delivered the inaugural address as lord rector of\r\nthe university” [Glasgow]. This discourse lasted an hour and a half, and\r\nthemes, familiar but never outworn nor extinct, were handled with vigour,\r\nenergy, and onward flow that made them sound as good as novel, and even\r\nwhere they did not instruct or did not edify, the noble music pleased. The\r\ngreat salient feature of the age was described as on its material side the\r\nconstant discovery of the secrets of nature, and the progressive\r\nsubjugation of her forces to the purposes and will of man. On the moral\r\nside, if these conquests had done much for industry, they had done more\r\nfor capital; if much for labour, more for luxury; they had variously and\r\nvastly multiplied the stimulants to gain, the avenues of excitement, the\r\nsolicitations to pleasure. The universities were in some sort to check all\r\nthis; the habits of mind formed by universities are founded in sobriety\r\nand tranquillity; they help to settle the spirit of a man firmly upon the\r\ncentre of gravity; they tend to self-command, self-government, and that\r\ngenuine self-respect which has in it nothing of mere self-worship, for it\r\nis the reverence which each man ought to feel for the nature that God has\r\ngiven him, and for the laws of that nature. Then came an appeal, into\r\nwhich the speaker’s whole heart was thrown, for the intellectual dignity\r\nof the Christian ministry. If argument failed to the great Christian\r\ntradition, he would set small value on the multitude of uninstructed\r\nnumerical adhesions, or upon the integrity of institutions and the\r\nunbroken continuity of rite. “Thought,” he exclaimed,—“_thought is the\r\ncitadel_.” There is a steeplechase philosophy in vogue—sometimes\r\nspecialism making short cuts to the honours of universal knowledge;\r\nsometimes by the strangest of solecisms, the knowledge of external nature\r\nbeing thought to convey a supreme capacity for judging within the sphere\r\nof moral action and of moral needs. The thing to do is to put scepticism\r\non its trial, and rigorously to cross-examine it: allow none of its\r\nassumptions; compel it to expound its formulæ; do not let it move a step\r\nexcept with proof in its hand; bring it front to front with history; even\r\ndemand that it shall show the positive elements with which it proposes to\r\nreplace the mainstays it seems bent on withdrawing from the fabric of\r\nmodern society. The present assault, far from being destined to final\r\ntriumph, is a sign of a mental movement, unsteady, though of extreme\r\nrapidity, but destined, perhaps, to elevate and strengthen the religion\r\nthat it sought to overthrow. “_In the meantime_,” he said, in closing this\r\nbranch of his address, “_I would recommend to you as guides in this\r\ncontroversy, truth, charity, diligence, and reverence, which indeed may be\r\ncalled the four cardinal virtues of all controversies, be they what they\r\nmay_.” This was followed by an ever-salutary reminder that man is the\r\ncrown of the visible creation, and that studies upon man—studies in the\r\nlargest sense of humanity, studies conversant with his nature, his works,\r\nhis duties and his destinies—these are the highest of all studies. As the\r\nhuman form is the groundwork of the highest training in art, so those\r\nmental pursuits are the highest which have man, considered at large, for\r\ntheir object. Some excellent admonitions upon history and a simple, moving\r\nbenediction, brought the oration to an end.\r\n\r\nBlue caps as well as red cheered fervently at the close, and some even of\r\nthose who had no direct interest in the main topics, and were not much or\r\nnot at all refreshed by his treatment of them, yet confessed themselves\r\nsorry when the stream of fascinating melody ceased to flow. Then followed\r\nluncheon in the university hall, where the principal, in proposing the\r\nlord rector’s health, expressed the hope that he had not grudged the time\r\ngiven to the serene, if dull, seclusion of academic things. “I only\r\nquarrel with your word dull,” said Mr. Gladstone in reply. “Let me assure\r\nyou, gentlemen, nothing is so dull as political agitation.” By this time\r\nit was four o’clock. Before six he was at St. Andrew’s Hall, confronting\r\nan audience of some six thousand persons, as eager to hear as he was eager\r\nto speak; and not many minutes had elapsed before they were as much aflame\r\nas he, with the enormities of the Anglo-Turkish convention, the spurious\r\nharbour in Cyprus, the wrongful laws about the press in India, the heavy\r\nand unjust charges thrown upon the peoples of India, the baseless quarrel\r\npicked with Shere Ali in Afghanistan, the record of ten thousand Zulus\r\nslain for no other offence than their attempt to defend against our\r\nartillery with their naked bodies their hearths and homes.\r\n\r\nOnce mentioning a well-known member of parliament who always showed fine\r\nmettle on the platform, Mr. Gladstone said of him in a homely image, that\r\nhe never saw a man who could so quickly make the kettle boil. This was\r\ncertainly his own art here. For an hour and a half thus he held them, with\r\nthe irresistible spell of what is in truth the groundwork of every\r\npolitical orator’s strongest appeal—from Athenians down to Girondins, from\r\nPericles to Webster, from Cicero to Gambetta—appeal to public law and\r\ncivil right and the conscience of a free and high-minded people. This\r\nhigh-wrought achievement over, he was carried off to dine, and that same\r\nnight he wound up what a man of seventy hard-spent years might well call\r\n“an overpowering day,” by one more address to an immense audience\r\nassembled by the Glasgow corporation in the city hall, to whom he\r\nexpressed his satisfaction at the proof given by his reception in Glasgow\r\nthat day, that her citizens had seen no reason to repent the kindness\r\nwhich had conferred the freedom of their city upon him fourteen years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n(M193) The audience in St. Andrew’s Hall at Glasgow was, we may presume,\r\nlike his audiences elsewhere, and the sources of his overwhelming power\r\nwere not hard to analyse, if one were in analytic humour. For one thing,\r\nthe speeches were rallying battle-cries, not sermons, and everybody knew\r\nthe great invisible antagonist with whom the orator before them was with\r\nall his might contending. It was a gleaming array of the political facts\r\nof a political indictment, not an aerial fabric of moral abstractions.\r\nNor, again, had the fashion in which Mr. Gladstone seized opinion and\r\nfeeling and personal allegiance in Scotland, anything in common with the\r\nviolent if splendid improvisations that made O’Connell the idol and the\r\nmaster of passionate Ireland. One of the most telling speeches of them all\r\nwas the exposure of the government finance in the Edinburgh corn-exchange,\r\nwhere for an hour and a half or more, he held to his figures of surplus\r\nand deficit, of the yield of bushels to the acre in good seasons and bad,\r\nof the burden of the income-tax, of the comparative burden per head of new\r\nfinancial systems and old, with all the rigour of an expert accountant. He\r\nenveloped the whole with a playful irony, such as a good-humoured master\r\nuses to the work of clumsy apprentices, but of the paraphernalia of\r\nrhetoric there is not a period nor a sentence nor a phrase. Fire is\r\nsuppressed. So far from being saturated with colour, the hue is almost\r\ndrab. Yet his audience were interested and delighted, and not for a moment\r\ndid he lose hold,—not even, as one observer puts it, “in the midst of his\r\nmost formidable statistics, nor at any point in the labyrinthine evolution\r\nof his longest sentences.”\r\n\r\nLet the conclusion be good or let it be bad, all was in groundwork and in\r\nessence strictly on the plane and in the tongue of statesmanship, and\r\nconformable to Don Pedro’s rule, “What need the bridge much broader than\r\nthe flood?”(359) It was Demosthenes, not Isocrates. It was the orator of\r\nconcrete detail, of inductive instances, of energetic and immediate\r\nobject; the orator confidently and by sure touch startling into\r\nwatchfulness the whole spirit of civil duty in a man; elastic and supple,\r\npressing fact and figure with a fervid insistence that was known from his\r\ncareer and character to be neither forced nor feigned, but to be himself.\r\nIn a word, it was a man—a man impressing himself upon the kindled throngs\r\nby the breadth of his survey of great affairs of life and nations, by the\r\ndepth of his vision, by the power of his stroke. Physical resources had\r\nmuch to do with the effect; his overflowing vivacity, the fine voice and\r\nflashing eye and a whole frame in free, ceaseless, natural and spontaneous\r\nmotion. So he bore his hearers through long chains of strenuous periods,\r\ncalling up by the marvellous transformations of his mien a strange\r\nsuccession of images—as as if he were now a keen hunter, now some eager\r\nbird of prey, now a charioteer of fiery steeds kept well in hand, and now\r\nand again we seemed to hear the pity or dark wrath of a prophet, with the\r\nmighty rushing wind and the fire running along the ground.\r\n\r\nAll this was Mr. Gladstone in Midlothian. To think of the campaign without\r\nthe scene, is as who should read a play by candle-light among the ghosts\r\nof an empty theatre. When the climax came, it was found that Mr.\r\nGladstone’s tremendous projectiles had pounded the ministerial citadel to\r\nthe ground, and that he had a nation at his back. What had been vague\r\nmisgiving about Lord Beaconsfield grew into sharp certainty; shadows of\r\ndoubt upon policy at Constantinople or Cabul or the Cape, became\r\nsubstantive condemnation; uneasiness as to the national finances turned to\r\nactive resentment; and above all, the people of this realm, who are a\r\npeople with rather more than their share of conscience at bottom, were led\r\nto consider whether when all is said, there is not still a difference\r\nbetween right and wrong even in the relations of states and the problems\r\nof empire. It was this last trait that made the atmosphere in which both\r\nspeaker and his hearers drew their inspiration. It may be true, if we\r\nwill, that, as a great critic sardonically hints, “eloquence, without\r\nbeing precisely a defect, is one of the worst dangers that can beset a\r\nman.”(360) Yet after all, to disparage eloquence is to depreciate mankind;\r\nand when men say that Mr. Gladstone and Midlothian were no better than a\r\nresplendent mistake, they forget how many objects of our reverence stand\r\ncondemned by implication in their verdict; they have not thought out how\r\nmany of the faiths and principles that have been the brightest lamps in\r\nthe track of human advance they are extinguishing by the same unkind and\r\nfreezing breath. One should take care lest in quenching the spirit of\r\nMidlothian, we leave sovereign mastery of the world to Machiavelli.\r\n\r\nI need not here go through the long list of topics. As an attack upon\r\nministers Mr. Gladstone made out the upshot to be finance in confusion,\r\nlegislation in arrear, honour compromised by breach of public law, Russia\r\naggrandized and yet estranged, Turkey befriended, as they say, but sinking\r\nevery year, Europe restless and disturbed; in Africa the memory of\r\nenormous bloodshed in Zululand, and the invasion of a free people in the\r\nTransvaal; Afghanistan broken; India thrown back. He disclaimed all\r\nfellowship with those who believe that the present state of society\r\npermits us to make any vow of universal peace, and of renouncing in all\r\ncases the policy of war. He enumerated the six principles that he thought\r\nto be the right principles for us: to foster the strength of the empire by\r\njust laws and by economy; to seek to preserve the world’s peace; to strive\r\nto the uttermost to cultivate and maintain the principle of concert in\r\nEurope; to avoid needless and entangling engagements; to see that our\r\nforeign policy shall be inspired by such love of freedom as had marked\r\nCanning, Palmerston, Russell; to acknowledge the equal right of all\r\nnations. He denounced “the policy of denying to others the rights that we\r\nclaim ourselves” as untrue, arrogant, and dangerous. The revival of the\r\nanalogy of imperial Rome for the guidance of British policy he held up as\r\nfundamentally unsound and practically ruinous. For have not modern times\r\nestablished a sisterhood of nations, equal, independent, each of them\r\nbuilt up under the legitimate defence which public law affords to every\r\nnation living within its own borders, and seeking to perform its own\r\naffairs? He insisted that we should ever “remember the rights of the\r\nsavage, as we call him.” “Remember,” he exclaimed, “that the sanctity of\r\nlife in the hill villages of Afghanistan, among the winter snows, is as\r\ninviolable in the eye of Almighty God as can be your own. Remember that He\r\nwho has united you as human beings in the same flesh and blood, has bound\r\nyou by the law of mutual love; that that mutual love is not limited by the\r\nshores of this island, is not limited by the boundaries of Christian\r\ncivilisation; that it passes over the whole surface of the earth, and\r\nembraces the meanest along with the greatest in its unmeasured scope.”\r\n\r\nIt was this free movement and pure air that gave to the campaign its\r\nmarking character. The campaign had a soul in it. Men were recalled to\r\nmoral forces that they had forgotten. In his last speech at Edinburgh, Mr.\r\nGladstone’s closing words were these:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am sustained and encouraged, and I may almost say driven on in\r\n    public life, by the sentiment believed and entertained by me most\r\n    sincerely, whether erroneously or not, that the principles at\r\n    issue are much broader than those of ordinary contention.... I\r\n    humbly ask for confidence when I state my own belief that the\r\n    objects we have in view at the present time are objects connected\r\n    with the welfare of mankind upon the widest scale.... Whatever we\r\n    may say amidst the clash of arms and amidst the din of preparation\r\n    for warfare in time of peace—amidst all this yet there is going on\r\n    a profound mysterious movement, that, whether we will or not, is\r\n    bringing the nations of the civilised world, as well as the\r\n    uncivilised, morally as well as physically nearer to one another,\r\n    and making them more and more responsible before God for one\r\n    another’s welfare.... I do most heartily thank you for having\r\n    given me the credit of being actuated by the desire to consider in\r\n    public transactions the wider interests of mankind, and I venture\r\n    to assure you that so far as my objects and intentions are\r\n    concerned, objects of that nature, and nothing meaner or narrower,\r\n    will ever be taken as the pole-star of my life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M194) Two days after a departure from Glasgow which he calls royal, the\r\nunwearied warrior made his way through scenes of endless stir all along\r\nthe journey, back to his temple of peace at Hawarden (December 8). There\r\nhe at once resumed his habits of daily industry, revising proofs of\r\nspeeches “reaching 255 pages!” placing books and reading them—Catullus,\r\nHodgson’s _Turgot_, somebody on Colour Sense, somebody else on Indian\r\nfinance, Jenkins on Atheism, Bunbury’s Geography—and so forth. Also,\r\n“wrote on mythology and on economics; together rather too much. I am not\r\nvery fit for composition after 5 P.M.” Meanwhile Christmas arrived, and\r\nthen the eve of his birthday, with its reflections—reflections of one—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Who though thus endued as with a sense\r\n    And faculty for storm and turbulence\r\n    Is yet a Soul whose master-bias leans ...\r\n    Where what he most doth value must be won.”\r\n\r\n    _December 28._ ... And now I am writing in the last minutes of the\r\n    seventh decade of my life. This closing is a great event. The days\r\n    of our life are three score years and ten. It is hardly possible\r\n    that I should complete another decade. How much or how little of\r\n    this will God give me for the purposes dear to my heart? Ah! what\r\n    need have I of what I may term spiritual leisure, to be out of the\r\n    dust and heat and blast and strain, before I pass into the unseen\r\n    world. But perhaps this is a form of self-love. For the last three\r\n    and a half years I have been passing through a political\r\n    experience which is, I believe, without example in our\r\n    parliamentary history. I profess to believe it has been an\r\n    occasion when the battle to be fought was a battle of justice,\r\n    humanity, freedom, law, all in their first elements from the very\r\n    root, and all on a gigantic scale. The word spoken was a word for\r\n    millions, and for millions who for themselves cannot speak. If I\r\n    really believe this, then I should regard my having been morally\r\n    forced into this work as a great and high election of God. And\r\n    certainly I cannot but believe that He has given me special gifts\r\n    of strength on the late occasion, especially in Scotland.... Three\r\n    things I would ask of God over and above all the bounty which\r\n    surrounds me. This first, that I may escape into retirement. This\r\n    second, that I may speedily be enabled to divest myself of\r\n    everything resembling wealth. And the third—if I may—that when God\r\n    calls me He may call me speedily. To die in church appears to be a\r\n    great euthanasia, but not at a time to disturb worshippers. Such\r\n    are some of an old man’s thoughts, in whom there is still\r\n    something that consents not to be old.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the other books that he had been reading was the biography of one of\r\nthe closest of his friends, and in the last hours of this _annus\r\nmirabilis_ he writes:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Read the _Life of Bishop Wilberforce_. It is indeed an edifying\r\n    book. I knew him, admired him, loved him living. But the laying\r\n    out of his full character from early days onwards tells me much I\r\n    did not know, and lifts upwards my conception of him both in\r\n    greatness and in goodness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII. The Eve Of The Battle. (1879)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Perhaps no man has ever had a mighty influence over his fellows\r\n    without having the innate need to dominate, and this need usually\r\n    becomes the more imperious in proportion as the complications of\r\n    life make Self inseparable from a purpose which is not\r\n    selfish.—GEORGE ELIOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to get what light we may on Mr. Gladstone’s frame of\r\nmind between his first astounding triumph in Midlothian and the crowning\r\nmercy of the general election. In October he had written to his son Henry\r\nin India as to the probable date of the dissolution, that the government\r\nhad in his opinion “to choose between a minor or a less smashing defeat\r\nnow, or probably a more smashing one after the disclosure and real\r\npresentation of their most discreditable finance, which can hardly be\r\ndelayed beyond the spring.” They had a chance of better trade, but the\r\nlikelihood also of worse revenue. The great reason against dissolution was\r\nthat they were in possession, and every day’s delay was another day’s\r\nexercise of power. He then proceeds to mention his personal position:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    They are beginning to ask _who_ is to succeed if Beaconsfield is\r\n    displaced. Voices are coming up here and there, some of them very\r\n    confident, that the people will call for me. Nothing, however, but\r\n    a very general, a nearly unanimous, call from the liberals, with\r\n    the appearance of a sort of national will, could bring this demand\r\n    to a form in which it could or ought to be obeyed. The reasons\r\n    against my coming forward are of immense force; those against my\r\n    indicating any shadow of desire or willingness to come forward are\r\n    conclusive. Nor do I at present see any indication of a state of\r\n    things which would bring it about.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M195) Before leaving Dalmeny at the end of his campaign, Mr. Gladstone\r\nwrote a letter to Mr. Bright, a copy of which, along with the reply, and\r\ntwo letters from Lord Wolverton, he left tied up in a separate packet.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Mr. Bright._\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 28, 1879._—You will probably recollect that during your last\r\n    visit to Hawarden you suggested to me in a walk the expectation or\r\n    the possibility that when the return of liberals to power seemed\r\n    probable, there might be a popular call for my resuming the\r\n    leadership of the party, and that I stated to you what I believed,\r\n    and you I think admitted, to be the reasons against it. These, if\r\n    I remember right, were four, and I attached to them differing\r\n    degrees of weight.\r\n\r\n    The first was that my health and strength would be unequal to the\r\n    strain at my time of life.\r\n\r\n    The second, that the work to be done was so formidable that hardly\r\n    any amount of courage availed to look it in the face.\r\n\r\n    The third, weightier than these, was that a liberal government\r\n    under me would be the object from the first of an amount and kind\r\n    of hostility, such as materially to prejudice its acts and weaken\r\n    or, in given circumstances, neutralise its power for good.\r\n\r\n    The fourth, that I was absolutely precluded under present\r\n    circumstances, being bound by the clearest considerations of\r\n    honour and duty to render a loyal allegiance to Granville as\r\n    leader of the party, and to Hartington as leader in the Commons,\r\n    and was entirely disabled from so much as entertaining any\r\n    proposition that could directly or indirectly tend to their\r\n    displacement.\r\n\r\n    There is a fifth consideration that now presses me, of which the\r\n    grounds had hardly emerged in regard to myself personally at the\r\n    time when we conversed together. Nothing could be so painful, I\r\n    may almost say so odious to me, as to force myself, or to be\r\n    forced, upon the Queen, under circumstances where the choice of\r\n    another from the ranks of the same party would save her from being\r\n    placed in a difficulty of that peculiar kind. This, it may be\r\n    said, belongs to the same category as my first and second\r\n    objections; but there it is.\r\n\r\n    The enthusiasm of Scotland is something wonderful. As to the\r\n    county of Midlothian, I doubt whether the well-informed tories\r\n    themselves in the least expect to win. We go to Taymouth on\r\n    Monday. I hope you are well and hearty and see cause to be\r\n    contented with the progress of opinion. The more I think about the\r\n    matter, the more strange and mysterious does it seem to me that\r\n    any party in this free nation should be found to sanction and\r\n    uphold policy and proceedings like those of the last two years in\r\n    particular. I have written this because I am desirous you should\r\n    have clearly before you the matter of my conversation with you,\r\n    and the means of verifying it.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Bright to Mr. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    _Rochdale, Dec. 12, 1879._—Perhaps I ought to have written to you\r\n    sooner to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ult.,\r\n    but I preferred to let you get home before I wrote, and I was in\r\n    truth rather puzzled as to what I ought to say.\r\n\r\n    You, with sufficient accuracy, describe the purport of your\r\n    remarks during our conversation when I was with you a year ago. I\r\n    saw the difficulty, then in the future, now perhaps near upon us.\r\n    But it is one in which nothing can be done, and “a masterly\r\n    inactivity” seems the only wise course. If a break-up of the\r\n    present concern comes, the Queen will be advised to send, for\r\n    Granville or Hartington. The one sent for will accept and attempt\r\n    to form a government, or he may have grave doubts, and say that\r\n    you are the only man, etc.; he will consult the other, and will\r\n    consult you. Meantime there may be a “pronouncement” on the part\r\n    of the people, through the press and public meetings, which will\r\n    have a sudden effect on negotiations and on the views of the\r\n    Queen, and may decide the question. If such a time should come,\r\n    then you will have to say what is possible, and I hope you will be\r\n    able to decide rightly, and with reference solely to the interests\r\n    of the country and the service you owe to the crown as\r\n    representing the nation. You will act with a most strict honour to\r\n    Granville and Hartington, as I believe they will act to you. If,\r\n    as I hope for and believe, no selfish ambition will come in to\r\n    make mischief, the question will be determined in such a manner as\r\n    to content all honest men, and what is best for all will be done.\r\n    I am often asked as to the future. I reply only so as to say\r\n    nothing to add to the evident difficulty of the situation.\r\n\r\n    Your Scotch expedition has been one of discovery and of conquest.\r\n    The tory press and partizans are evidently astonished at it. The\r\n    government speakers have no new defence, and they want the past to\r\n    be forgotten. Mr. Smith, first lord, I see, entirely rejoices in\r\n    what has been done in South Africa, though “a few lives” have been\r\n    lost by it. This official life seems sorely to demoralise some\r\n    homely and decent people. I am fairly well so far during the\r\n    winter, but I seem feeble when I compare myself with your activity\r\n    and power.... We are to have meetings in Birmingham during\r\n    January. I should prefer the quiet of obscurity to these meetings.\r\n    I hope Mrs. Gladstone and your daughter have enjoyed their Scotch\r\n    trip and are well after it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive days later came Lord Wolverton’s report of the state of feeling on\r\nthese delicate topics in high places in London. He had seen Lord Granville\r\non the evening of the 16th:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    To most affectionate inquiries as to your health and powers, I\r\n    gave a most satisfactory account, and the conversation then went\r\n    to the question as to the effect which your recent triumphant\r\n    progress in Midlothian and the North had produced upon your mind.\r\n    I frankly said that you had in my opinion not anticipated such a\r\n    marked expression of public feeling, and that it had doubtless\r\n    tended to lead your mind to the consideration of the position of\r\n    the party, and to the fact that public opinion might call upon you\r\n    to an extent which no one could have looked for. I then (with\r\n    anxiety to convey what I know to be your desire) most earnestly\r\n    impressed upon Lord Granville that you had upon every occasion\r\n    when the subject was alluded to, prefaced all you had to say with\r\n    the strongest expressions of loyalty to Hartington and himself.\r\n    That I felt convinced that nothing would induce you to encourage,\r\n    or to even listen to, any attempt which others might make to\r\n    disturb the existing state of things as to the leadership, unless\r\n    the wish was very clearly expressed to you by Hartington and\r\n    himself, and you would demand full proof that their interests and\r\n    that of the party strongly pointed to the reconsideration of your\r\n    own position. I need hardly say that, though I felt it my duty to\r\n    take care that I did not understate your feelings, it was not\r\n    necessary to reassure Granville upon that point.\r\n\r\n    The conversation then went to the state of the party and its\r\n    present position. I learnt that a private meeting had been held at\r\n    Devonshire House in the morning. I believe Hartington, Granville,\r\n    Cardwell, Adam, and Harcourt were present. My _impression_ is that\r\n    the advice Adam gave as to the elections, was that “union in the\r\n    party at this moment would not be promoted by a change of front.”\r\n    I do not mean to say that the question of leadership was _actually\r\n    discussed_, but I _suspect_ the conversation turned somewhat upon\r\n    the point which you place “_third_” in your letter to Bright. To\r\n    sum it all up, I do not think you will at present be troubled by\r\n    any application to you from Granville and Hartington.(361)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third point in the letter to Mr. Bright was the question whether a\r\nliberal government under Mr. Gladstone would not be exposed to a special\r\ndegree of hostility, due to the peculiar antagonism that his personality\r\nexcited. In a later letter (December 20), Wolverton tells Mr. Gladstone\r\nthat in the conversation of the 16th, “Lord Granville raised the point you\r\nmade your third in your note to Bright, and that he did converse upon at\r\n_some length_, evidently having real fears that many of our weak-kneed\r\nones would feel some alarm if Hartington went from the front _now_, and\r\nthat the tories would intensify this to the uttermost. I think this was\r\nall.” Another sentence indicates Lord Wolverton’s own view:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lord Granville is not sanguine as to the future. As you know, he\r\n    is always inclined to “temporise”; this is his line now, and he is\r\n    perhaps right. You know my fear was that without your name in\r\n    front, the battle at the election would be fought at a great\r\n    disadvantage. But I see the immense difficulty of a change of\r\n    front _now_, even if they desired it and you consented to it. This\r\n    you also feel, I know.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo all this Mr. Gladstone replied to Wolverton as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, December 18, 1879._—I thank you much for your letter.\r\n    What you report yourself to have said is quite satisfactory to me.\r\n    If Granville said more than you had mentioned, anything that fell\r\n    from him would be acceptable to me. When I saw your envelope, I\r\n    felt a dread lest the contents should be more substantive; a\r\n    relief came on reading them. But these communications are useful,\r\n    as they give distinctness to ideas, and through ideas to\r\n    intentions. I may state mine as follows: 1. My ears are shut\r\n    against all the world, except it were Granville and Hartington. 2.\r\n    And even to them unless they spoke together, and in clear and\r\n    decisive language. 3. They are the judges whether to speak, as\r\n    well as when to speak. But as an individual, I am of opinion that\r\n    there is not a case for their speaking _now_. 4. Were they to\r\n    speak now, and as I have defined above, I should then say let us\r\n    have nothing more than a formula, and let the substance of it be\r\n    that by the nature of things no man in my position could make\r\n    beforehand an absolute renunciation, and that the leadership in\r\n    the next parliament must, like everything else, be considered in\r\n    connection with what may appear at the dissolution to be the sense\r\n    of the country, but that my action individually has been and will\r\n    continue to be that of a follower of Lord Granville and Lord\r\n    Hartington. One thing I would ask of you as a fast friend. If you\r\n    think that in anything I fall short by omission or commission of\r\n    perfect loyalty as a member of the party, I beg you to tell me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nAs usual with him, these grave political preoccupations were not\r\nengrossing, but only a part of the day’s task. He carried on a pretty\r\nprofuse correspondence, he worked hard on his favourite diversion of\r\narranging books and papers, he gave much thought and time to estate\r\nmatters with his eldest son, with him too he felled now a chestnut, now a\r\nsycamore; he corrected the proofs of his speeches and wrote an article for\r\nMr. Knowles; he read books and articles about Eleusis, and the Hebrew\r\nmigration from Egypt, and the Olympian system, and Newman on the\r\nEirenicon, and Westcott on St. John, and somebody else upon St. Thomas\r\nAquinas. For two or three days he was partially disabled by “a low\r\nface-ache: the reaction after heavy pressure, under which I received from\r\nthe mercy of God such remarkable support.” In the middle of January\r\nalarming accounts came from his sister Helen, who lay dying at Cologne.\r\nThither he sped with his eldest brother and his sister-in-law. They found\r\nlife fast ebbing, and four days after their arrival the end came, in the\r\nmidst of pious exercises and affectionate care. They were satisfied that\r\nshe had been “freely restored to the unity of spirit and the bond of\r\npeace,” and had died not in the actual Roman communion. A few days after\r\nhis return home he records: “Wrote a long memorandum of the evidence in\r\nregard to dear Helen’s religious profession.” The remains they bore to\r\nFasque, and by the end of the month he was again at Hawarden, once more at\r\nwork with his eldest son upon the “accumulated disorder,” and the rest of\r\nthe round of his familiar employments. Among other things he read Cowper’s\r\n_Task_—“the fifth book very noble in its moral strain”; and another entry\r\nwill interest many,—“_Feb. 15._—Read the biography of noble Dora Pattison.\r\nHow by reflex action it stings.... Yet even to her (like Bishop Butler),\r\ndeath was terrible.” “He was haunted,” he writes, “with recollections of\r\nSister Dora.” Then after a Sunday passed in church exercises, and\r\n“skimming many theological books,” on February 23 he “left Hawarden with a\r\nheavy heart.”\r\n\r\nHe quickly found himself in the London whirlpool, attending conclaves of\r\nhis political friends, dining out, seeing Irving in the _Merchant of\r\nVenice_ (“his best, I think”), speaking once or twice in the House, and\r\ntwice at London meetings in St. Pancras and Marylebone, where the popular\r\nenthusiasm made even his most hardened critics begin to suspect that the\r\ntide had really turned since the days when the Londoners mobbed him in the\r\nstreet and broke his windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII. The Fall Of Lord Beaconsfield. (1880)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In causa facili cuivis licet esse disertum,\r\n      Et minimae vires frangere quassa valent;\r\n    Subruere est arces et stantia moenia virtus.\r\n\r\n    —Ov. _Trist._, iii. XI. 21.\r\n\r\n    In an easy case any man can plead, and against shattered walls the\r\n    puniest strength prevails; ’tis the overthrow of standing towers\r\n    and frowning ramparts that tests manhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last one day (March 8) when Mr. Gladstone was “writing a little on\r\nHomer,” he heard the fated news that the dissolution was announced. Lord\r\nBeaconsfield published the famous letter to the lord lieutenant of\r\nIreland, and in deep accents and sonorous sentences endeavoured to make\r\nhome rule the issue of the election. Shrewd politicians, with time to\r\nreflect, found it not easy to divine why the government had chosen the\r\nparticular moment. It might be, as some supposed, that they thought the\r\nopposition had lately got into bad odour with the country by coquetting\r\nwith home rulers, as shown by the elections at Liverpool and Southwark.\r\nBut, in fact, little importance was to be attached to these two defeats of\r\nthe opposition, for Liverpool had always been conservative, and Southwark\r\nwas thoroughly disorganised by liberal divisions. “The general opinion\r\nseems to be,” says Speaker Brand (Mar. 15), “that the opposition may gain\r\nslightly at the general election, but not to an extent to break down\r\naltogether the conservative majority.”\r\n\r\nIn what was in effect his election address, Lord Beaconsfield warned the\r\ncountry that a danger, in its ultimate results scarcely less disastrous\r\nthan pestilence and famine, distracted Ireland. A portion of its\r\npopulation was endeavouring to sever the constitutional tie that united it\r\nto Great Britain in that bond which was favourable to the power and\r\nprosperity of both. “It is to be hoped,” he went on, “that all men of\r\nlight and leading will resist this destructive doctrine. The strength of\r\nthis action depends on the unity of feeling which should pervade the\r\nUnited Kingdom and its widespread dependencies. The first duty of an\r\nEnglish minister should be to consolidate that co-operation which renders\r\nirresistible the community educated, as our own, in an equal love of\r\nliberty and law. And yet there are some who challenge the expediency of\r\nthe imperial character of this realm. Having attempted and failed to\r\nenfeeble our colonies by their policy of decomposition, they may perhaps\r\nnow recognise in the disintegration of the United Kingdom, a mode which\r\nwill not only accomplish, but precipitate their purpose.... Rarely in this\r\ncentury has there been an occasion more critical. The power of England and\r\nthe peace of Europe will largely depend upon the verdict of the\r\ncountry.... Peace rests on the presence, not to say the ascendency of\r\nEngland in the councils of Europe. Even at this moment the doubt supposed\r\nto be inseparable from popular elections, if it does not diminish,\r\ncertainly arrests her influence, and is a main reason for not delaying an\r\nappeal to the national voice.”\r\n\r\nTo this manifesto Mr. Gladstone, with his usual long pains in the drafting\r\nof such pieces, prepared his counterblast. He went with direct force to\r\nwhat Lord Beaconsfield had striven to make the centre of his appeal:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the electioneering address which the prime minister has issued,\r\n    an attempt is made to work upon your fears by dark allusions to\r\n    the repeal of the union and the abandonment of the colonies.\r\n    Gentlemen, those who endangered the union with Ireland were the\r\n    party that maintained there an alien church, an unjust land law,\r\n    and franchises inferior to our own; and the true supporters of the\r\n    union are those who firmly uphold the supreme authority of\r\n    parliament, but exercise that authority to bind the three nations\r\n    by the indissoluble tie of liberal and equal laws. As to the\r\n    colonies, liberal administrations set free their trade with all\r\n    the world, gave them popular and responsible government, undertook\r\n    to defend Canada with the whole strength of the empire, and\r\n    organised the great scheme for uniting the several settlements of\r\n    British North America into one dominion, to which, when we quitted\r\n    office in 1866, it only remained for our successors to ask the\r\n    ready assent of parliament. It is by these measures that the\r\n    colonies have been bound in affection to the empire, and the\r\n    authors of them can afford to smile at baseless insinuations.\r\n    Gentlemen, the true purpose of these terrifying insinuations is to\r\n    hide from view the acts of the ministry, and their effect upon the\r\n    character and condition, of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo those ministerial misdeeds he proceeded to draw the attention of the\r\nelectors, though he declared with threescore years and ten upon his head,\r\nhow irksome he felt the task. “At home,” he said, “the ministers have\r\nneglected legislation, aggravated the public distress by continual shocks\r\nto confidence which is the life of enterprise, augmented the public\r\nexpenditure and taxation for purposes not merely unnecessary but\r\nmischievous, and plunged the finances, which were handed over to them in a\r\nstate of singular prosperity, into a series of deficits unexampled in\r\nmodern times.” After shooting this heavy bolt he looked abroad. “Abroad\r\nthey have strained, if they have not endangered, the prerogative by gross\r\nmisuse, and have weakened the empire by needless wars, unprofitable\r\nextensions, and unwise engagements, and have dishonoured it in the eyes of\r\nEurope by filching the island of Cyprus from the Porte under a treaty\r\nclause distinctly concluded in violation of the treaty of Paris, which\r\nformed part of the international law of Christendom.” As to the domestic\r\nlegislation of the future, it was in the election address of the prime\r\nminister a perfect blank. It was true that in default of reform in this\r\nkingdom, the nation was promised the advantages of “presence, not to say\r\nascendency,” in the councils of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is indeed, he said, an ascendency in European councils to\r\n    which Great Britain might reasonably aspire, by steadily\r\n    sustaining the character of a Power no less just than strong;\r\n    attached to liberty and law, jealous of peace, and therefore\r\n    opposed to intrigue and aggrandizement, from whatever quarter they\r\n    may come; jealous of honour, and therefore averse to the\r\n    clandestine engagements which have marked our two latest years. To\r\n    attain a moral and envied ascendency such as this, is indeed a\r\n    noble object for any minister or any empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone wrote to Lord Acton on March 14:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    On Tuesday I am to set out for Midlothian and my _last_ general\r\n    election. My general elections have been 1832, 1835, 1837, 1841,\r\n    1847, 1852, 1857, 1859, 1865, 1874, and now 1880—what a list! I\r\n    believe that among the official men of this century I am now\r\n    beaten only by Lord Palmerston in the length of my career in the\r\n    House of Commons. A clear answer from the nation, a clear answer\r\n    in the right sense, and a decisive accession of the liberal party\r\n    to power without me, this is what I hope and pray. I think that\r\n    the experts and the party generally are pretty sanguine. None\r\n    doubt that the government are to lose; a few doubt whether they\r\n    will be weaker than liberals and home rulers; very many whether\r\n    weaker than liberals alone. All agree that Scotland will do its\r\n    duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 16th, Mr. Gladstone started. Hundreds of people grew\r\nto thousands long before his train left King’s Cross, and all the way to\r\nEdinburgh he found the same vivid interest and acclamation on the east\r\ncoast that had greeted him in November on the west. At Grantham the mayor\r\nand a crowd estimated by nimble statisticians at two thousand, awaited him\r\nat the station; at York the lord mayor and six thousand; at\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne too many thousands to count. The little addresses made\r\nat these stopping-places were described as a sort of table of contents of\r\nthe more elaborate speeches to be delivered in Midlothian itself. As he\r\ncrossed the Tweed the fervour did not cool, and when at last he reached\r\nEdinburgh, he encountered a scene almost as wonderful as that which had\r\nmet him four months before.\r\n\r\nAgain he was the guest at Dalmeny, and again he renewed his prodigious\r\nexertions amid a vehemence of admiration and delight that became more\r\nintense as the days passed. Here is an entry or two from the diary:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Travelled forty miles and delivered three speeches of forty-five\r\n    or fifty minutes each, at Juniper Green, Colinton, and Mid Calder.\r\n    Enthusiasm unabated.... Corrected and despatched proofs of\r\n    _Religion, Achaian and Semitic_. _Mar. 21, Palm Sunday._—Drove to\r\n    Edinburgh cathedral; service 11-1-½. Free St. George’s in the\r\n    afternoon. Walked out seven miles with Lord Rosebery. 22.—To\r\n    Edinburgh (after working as usual on my papers) at 1.15. Short\r\n    complimentary address at liberal club. Then to George Street and\r\n    on to the city election committee; short speech. Then by train to\r\n    Gilmerton; spoke forty-five or fifty minutes; next after tea to\r\n    Loanhead, and after more tea, spoke again for some time on Russian\r\n    aggrandizement. Everywhere the greatest enthusiasm. Mr. C[owan]\r\n    gave me interesting details about Magyar and Bohemian students.\r\n    Back to Dalmeny at 7.20.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so day after day did panting time toil after him in vain. Many of us\r\nhave known long spells of hard electioneering—but not in one’s\r\nseventy-first year, with every single word as it fell into print on the\r\nmorrow watched with the lynx eyes of party scrutiny, and all loaded with\r\nthe heaviest personal responsibility.\r\n\r\n(M196) On March 24 the parliament was dissolved. On March 30 the first\r\nelections took place, and the first pollings on the day following. From\r\nthe early returns it was pretty evident that the liberals would have a\r\nmajority. On the first day they made a net gain of fifteen seats in\r\nsixty-nine constituencies. By the end of the fourth day a total net gain\r\nof fifty seats was recorded. The ministerial majority was already gone.\r\nThe county elections brought new surprises, and by the end of the second\r\nweek the liberal gains were reckoned at ninety-nine.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone’s fortnight of discourse ended on the 2nd of April. “So,” he\r\nrecords, “ends the second series of the speeches in which I have hammered\r\nwith all my poor might at the fabric of the present tory power. _April\r\n3._—Cut down a Spanish chestnut in Dalmeny Park by order. The day was\r\nquiet, but my papers and letters and the incoming news made it busy. It\r\nseemed as if the arm of the Lord had bared itself for work that He has\r\nmade His own. 4.—A lull in election news, but the reflections on what has\r\npassed are overpowering.” Here are his closing words, and they are not\r\nwithout historic import:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The great trial, gentlemen, proceeds. You have great forces\r\n    arrayed against you. I say “You”; if you will permit me to\r\n    identify myself with you, I will say, We have great forces arrayed\r\n    against us, and apparently we cannot make our appeal to the\r\n    aristocracy, excepting that which must never be forgotten, the\r\n    distinguished and enlightened minority of that body of able,\r\n    energetic, patriotic, liberal-minded men, whose feelings are with\r\n    those of the people, and who decorate and dignify their rank by\r\n    their strong sympathy with the entire community. With that\r\n    exception, in all the classes of which I speak, I am sorry to say\r\n    we cannot reckon upon what is called the landed interest, we\r\n    cannot reckon upon the clergy of the established church either in\r\n    England or in Scotland, subject again and always in each case to\r\n    the most noble exceptions—exceptions, I trust, likely to enlarge\r\n    and multiply from day to day. On none of these can we place our\r\n    trust. We cannot reckon on the wealth of the country, nor upon the\r\n    rank of the country, nor upon the influence which rank and wealth\r\n    usually bring. In the main these powers are against us, for\r\n    wherever there is a close corporation, wherever there is a spirit\r\n    of organised monopoly, wherever there is a narrow and sectional\r\n    interest apart from that of the country, and desiring to be set up\r\n    above the interest of the public, there, gentlemen, we, the\r\n    liberal party, have no friendship and no tolerance to expect.\r\n    Above all these, and behind all these, there is something greater\r\n    than these—there is the nation itself. This great trial is now\r\n    proceeding before the nation. The nation is a power hard to rouse,\r\n    but when roused, harder still and more hopeless to resist.... I\r\n    figure to myself those who have constituted the majority of the\r\n    late House of Commons as the persons arraigned, and the\r\n    constituencies of the country as those who are called together in\r\n    the solemn order of the constitution to hear the evidence, and to\r\n    pronounce the verdict. That evidence has been pretty largely\r\n    given. That verdict we await. We have none of the forms of a\r\n    judicial trial. There are no peers in Westminster Hall, there are\r\n    no judges on the woolsack; but if we concentrate our minds upon\r\n    the truth of the case as apart from its mere exterior, it is a\r\n    grander and a more august spectacle than was ever exhibited either\r\n    in Westminster Hall or in the House of Lords. For a nation, called\r\n    to undertake a great and responsible duty,—a duty which is to\r\n    tell, as we are informed from high authority, on the peace of\r\n    Europe and on the destinies of England,—has found its interests\r\n    mismanaged, its honour tarnished, and its strength burdened and\r\n    weakened by needless, mischievous, unauthorised, and unprofitable\r\n    engagements, and it has resolved that this state of things shall\r\n    cease, and that right and justice shall be done.(362)\r\n\r\n\r\n(M197) Mr. Gladstone was already member for Leeds. So far back as the\r\nMarch of 1878 Sir James Kitson had written to ask him to become a\r\ncandidate for the great city of the West Siding, but Mr. Gladstone\r\ndeclined the proposal. Then a deputation came to him in Harley Street, and\r\nhe made them a speech on the Eastern question, but avoided any reference\r\nto the subject which they had come to handle. The stout Yorkshiremen were\r\nnot to be baffled, and Mr. Gladstone, nominated without action of his own,\r\nwas now returned by the unprecedented vote of 24,622.(363) He was right in\r\ncalling the Leeds election “one of the most conspicuous and imposing\r\nvictories ever won for the liberal cause.”(364) Still public interest was\r\nconcentrated upon Midlothian, and the might with which he prevailed over\r\nmen’s minds there, was admitted by his foes to be the most impressive\r\ntribute ever paid to political man and his vast powers as orator and\r\npopular leader. In Midlothian the crusade had been opened, and in\r\nMidlothian its triumph was sealed.\r\n\r\nThe poll was declared in Edinburgh soon after seven on the evening of\r\nApril 5, and a few minutes later the result, amid every demonstration of\r\nextravagant delight from the triumphant multitude as they rushed away from\r\nthe courthouse, was made known to Mr. Gladstone at a house in George\r\nStreet taken by Lord Rosebery for the occasion. A couple of candles were\r\nbrought from the dining-table and held on each side of him, so that his\r\nface might be seen, as from the balcony he spoke a few words of\r\nthanks.(365) “Drove into Edinburgh about four,” Mr. Gladstone records. “At\r\n7.20 Mr. Reid brought the figures of the poll—Gladstone, 1579; Dalkeith,\r\n1368; quite satisfactory. Soon after, 15,000 people being gathered in\r\nGeorge Street, I spoke very shortly from the windows, and Rosebery\r\nfollowed, excellently well. Home about 10. Wonderful and nothing less has\r\nbeen the disposing guiding hand of God in all this matter.” The majority\r\nwas not of great dimensions, but it was adequate and sufficient, and the\r\nvictory was celebrated half through the night with bonfires,\r\nilluminations, fireworks, and all the other fashions of signifying public\r\njoy, throughout Scotland and the north of England. The astrologers,\r\nmeteorologists, and prognosticators of Pall Mall and Fleet Street felt\r\nthat this time at least they had not rightly plumbed the depths of the\r\ndemocratic seas.\r\n\r\nLord Beaconsfield was staying alone at that time in the historic halls of\r\nHatfield, their master being then abroad. There, hour by hour and day\r\nafter day, news of the long train of disasters reached him. From one in\r\nconfidential relations with him, and who saw much of him at this moment, I\r\nhave heard that the fallen minister, who had counted on a very different\r\nresult, now faced the ruin of his government, the end of his career, and\r\nthe overwhelming triumph of his antagonist, with an unclouded serenity and\r\na greatness of mind, worthy of a man who had known high fortunes and\r\nfilled to the full the measure of his gifts and his ambitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M198) Some writers complained that the language of Midlothian was as\r\nsolemn as if the verdict of the country were about to settle the issues of\r\nthe battle of Armageddon. It was not exactly the battle of Armageddon, but\r\nthe election of 1880 was, at any rate, one of the most remarkable in party\r\nhistory. For one thing, activity was unprecedented, and Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nfiery spirit seemed to have spread over the country. A list prepared by\r\nthe liberal whips, and preserved by Mr. Gladstone, describes the new\r\nparliament as composed of 347 liberals, 240 conservatives, and 65\r\nnationalists. Looking at the divisions of the three kingdoms, we find\r\nEngland and Wales contributing 282 liberals against 207 tories; Scotland\r\n52 liberals against 8 tories; and Ireland, 13 liberals against 25 tories.\r\nThe Irish nationalists were of two shades: 35 followers of Mr. Parnell, 26\r\nmoderate home rulers who followed Mr. Shaw, and 4 dubious. In England and\r\nWales therefore the liberal majority was 75, and in Scotland it was 44.\r\nTurning to electoral aspects with special social significance, we note\r\nthat of the county constituencies 63 sent liberal members as against 124\r\ntories. In the metropolis, as a whole, the government gained one seat and\r\nlost four, with the result that London was represented in the new\r\nparliament by 8 tories and 14 liberals. One victory of real importance was\r\nwon by the government, for they beat the liberal by two to one in the City\r\nof London, the heart and centre of many of those powerful influences that\r\nMr. Gladstone had described in his last speech in the Midlothian election\r\nas determined foes from whom the liberal party had no tolerance to expect.\r\n“The tory party,” Mr. Gladstone noted, “has never had a majority on any\r\none of its own four dissolutions—1852, 1859, 1868, 1880.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Gladstone to Lord Rosebery._\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, April 10, 1880._—... I should like to write about these\r\n    marvellous events, but how can I? The romance of politics which\r\n    befel my old age in Scotland, has spread over the whole land. You\r\n    remember perhaps my series of fractions, comparing daily the net\r\n    gains with the gross returns. The first day began with 1/13 or\r\n    thereabouts. It had got to 1/10 or 1/9 when we left you. It is now\r\n    1/6. How idle to talk about the caprice of household suffrage; the\r\n    counties have given quite as remarkable results as the boroughs. I\r\n    was stunned at the end of the first night; and I am still out of\r\n    breath from the endeavour to keep up with the rapidity of events.\r\n    I suppose the conservative Scotch will fill the first class\r\n    compartment, or nearly so, but no more. Wales, I beg you to\r\n    observe, has not (as I think) been behind Scotland in her\r\n    achievements. Most of the wretched percentage of compensation on\r\n    “tory gains” on the general list is wretched in quality as well as\r\n    quantity, and consists of the _district_ places. To scarcely one\r\n    of these gains can they point with any keen satisfaction. As to\r\n    Midlothian the moral effect, before and after, has I think\r\n    surpassed all our hopes. The feeling until it was over (since\r\n    which there has justly been a centring of thought on E.\r\n    Lancashire) was so fastened on it, that it was almost like one of\r\n    the occasions of old when the issue of battle was referred to\r\n    single combat. The great merit of it I apprehend lay in the\r\n    original conception, which I take to have been yours, and to\r\n    overshadow even your operations towards the direct production of\r\n    the result. But one thing it cannot overshadow in my mind: the\r\n    sense of the inexpressible aid and comfort derived day by day from\r\n    your considerate ever-watchful care and tact. [_Latin not to be\r\n    identified._] Let me apply these same words (calling on you for a\r\n    translation if needful) to Lady Rosebery. I should feel profoundly\r\n    ashamed of the burdens we brought you, had I not seen how truly\r\n    they were borne in the spirit, which alone makes all burdens\r\n    light. It is a very pleasant subject of reflection to me that the\r\n    riveting effect of companionship in a struggle like this, does not\r\n    pass away with the struggle itself but abides.\r\n\r\n    Our stratagem for a quiet exit was on the whole successful. At\r\n    Carlisle there was perfect quiet. At most of the few places where\r\n    the train stopped there were a score or two of people and no more.\r\n    At Hawarden, arriving between 9 and 10 A.M., we cheated the\r\n    triumphal preparations; but made amends by carrying them over to\r\n    Herbert the following day. We now become eager for the East\r\n    Worcestershire election and are sanguine about my son’s return. At\r\n    Warrington we got over the three hours wonderfully, and succeeded\r\n    in sleeping, though not exactly μαλθακῶς κατακείμενος through a\r\n    succession of the most violent and unearthly noises, banging,\r\n    crashing, roaring, squealing, that a railway station traversed by\r\n    innumerable goods’ trains can supply..... I will not trouble you\r\n    with, more words of thanks, I feel them so poor and idle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later Mr. Gladstone wrote to the Duke of Argyll:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 12, 1880._—All our heads are still in a whirl from the\r\n    great events of the last fortnight, which have given joy, I am\r\n    convinced, to the large majority of the civilised world. The\r\n    downfall of Beaconsfieldism is like the vanishing of some vast\r\n    magnificent castle in an Italian romance. It is too big, however,\r\n    to be all taken in at once. Meantime, while I inwardly rejoice, I\r\n    am against all outward signs, beyond such as are purely local, of\r\n    exultation, for they are not chivalrous, and they would tend to\r\n    barbarise political warfare. We may be well content to thank God\r\n    in silence. But the outlook is tremendous! The gradual unravelling\r\n    of the tangled knots of the foreign and Indian policy will indeed\r\n    be a task for skilled and strong hands, if they can be found; and\r\n    these can hardly be found such as the case requires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX. The Second Ministry. (1880)\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is indeed one great and critical act, the responsibility for\r\n    which falls momentarily or provisionally on the Sovereign: it is\r\n    the dismissal of an existing Ministry, and the appointment of a\r\n    new one. This act is usually performed with the aid drawn from\r\n    authentic manifestations of public opinion, mostly such as are\r\n    obtained through the votes or conduct of the House of\r\n    Commons.—GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day after the declaration of the poll in Midlothian, Mr. Gladstone and\r\nhis wife and daughter quitted Dalmeny, and made their way homewards, as we\r\nhave just seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 6._—A heavy day with post, incessant telegrams, and\r\n    preparations for departure. We drove, however, to Linlithgow, saw\r\n    the beautiful church and fine old castle, and I made a short\r\n    non-polemical speech to the people.... Careful concealment of the\r\n    plans of departure until well on in the evening. Left this most\r\n    hospitable of all houses at 8.30, and got into the 9.25, escaping\r\n    by secrecy all demonstration except from some 200 who seemed to\r\n    gather on the instant. Travelled all night, and had time to\r\n    ruminate on the great hand of God, so evidently displayed.\r\n\r\n    _April 7, Wed._—After three hours of successful sleep amid\r\n    frightful unearthly noises at Warrington, we went off to Chester\r\n    and Hawarden, saluted enthusiastically, but escaping all\r\n    crowds.... Set to work at once on a mass of letters and papers....\r\n    The day occupied with papers, letters, and telegrams, and reading\r\n    my Vatican tracts.... The triumph grows and grows; to God be the\r\n    praise.\r\n\r\n    _April 9._—Letters passed 100. _April 10, Sat._—Church, 8-½ A.M.\r\n    Wrote to ... Postal arrivals, 140; terrible! Wolverton arrived to\r\n    dinner, and I spent the evening in full conversation with him. He\r\n    threatens a request from Granville and Hartington. Again, I am\r\n    stunned, but God will provide.\r\n\r\n    _April 11, Sun._—Church, 8-½ A.M., Holy Communion; 11 A.M. Wrote\r\n    etc. Read _Gospel for the 19th Century_. Examined liturgical\r\n    books. Further conversation with Wolverton on the London\r\n    reception, on Leeds, and on the great matter of all. _April\r\n    12._—Wolverton went off in the morning, and is to see Granville\r\n    and Hartington to-day. Read Brugsch’s _Hist. Egypt_. _Guy\r\n    Mannering._ Wrote some memoranda of names applicable to this\r\n    occasion. Hard day. But all are pretty hard in this my\r\n    “retirement.” _April 13._—Began tentatively an anonymous letter on\r\n    the Conservative Collapse,(366) really drawn forth by the letter\r\n    of Lord Bath.... Read _Guy Mannering_ and that most heavenly man\r\n    George Herbert.... _April 16._—Mr. Bright came over from\r\n    Llandudno, and we spent nearly all the time in conversing on the\r\n    situation. He is most kind and satisfactory. _April 17._—Finished\r\n    my letter and revision of it. Cut down a sycamore with W. H. G.\r\n    _April 18, Sun._—Holy Communion 8 A.M.; morning service and\r\n    evening. Wrote to [17 letters]. _Read Divine Veracity or Divine\r\n    Justice_, Caird on the _Philosophy of Religion_. _April 19._—A\r\n    reluctant goodbye before 1. London at 6.30. A secret journey, but\r\n    people gathered at Chester station and Euston. I vaguely feel that\r\n    this journey is a plunge out of an atmosphere of peace into an\r\n    element of disturbance. May He who has of late so wonderfully\r\n    guided, guide me still in the critical days about to come. _April\r\n    20._—This blank day is, I think, probably due to the Queen’s\r\n    hesitation or reluctance, which the ministers have to find means\r\n    of [covering].\r\n\r\n\r\nOne joyous element in these days at Hawarden was the arrival first of the\r\nyoungest son of the house, then of the eldest, the latter of them having\r\nwon a seat in Worcestershire, and the former having failed in Middlesex,\r\nafter a display of qualities that delighted his family and friends much\r\nmore than mere victory could have done. “About one,” Mr. Gladstone marks\r\non the 8th, “Herbert entered in triumph. We were there, and could not but\r\nbe much moved.” And on the 14th, “Willy made his triumphal entry at four,\r\nand delivered a very good speech. Neville Lyttelton, too, spoke well from\r\nthe carriage.” As Lord Acton wrote to Miss Gladstone about Middlesex, “The\r\npicture of the young, untried son bursting into sudden popularity, and\r\nturning men’s thoughts from the absorbing exploits of his father, adds an\r\naffecting domestic feature to that great biography. That meeting at\r\nHawarden, after such a revolution and such a growth, is a thing I cannot\r\nthink of without emotion.” A little later, when Mr. Gladstone’s option of\r\nMidlothian left the Leeds seat vacant, his son was elected without\r\nopposition to fill it. Mr. Gladstone’s letters on this operation, which\r\nhad its delicacies, are an excellent example of his habits of careful and\r\nattentive judgment in handling even secondary affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M199) From the moment when it became clear that Lord Beaconsfield would\r\nbe swept out of office, it was just as clear to sensible men that only one\r\nsuccessor was possible. It was Mr. Gladstone, as everybody knew and said,\r\nwho had led and inspired the assault. A cabinet without him would hold its\r\ncouncils without the most important of the influences on which it\r\ndepended. If the majorities that carried the election could have been\r\nconsulted on the choice of a minister, nobody doubted upon whom with\r\nunanimity their choice would fall. Even those who most detested the\r\nresult, even those who held that a load of anxiety would be lifted from\r\nthe bosoms of many liberals of official rank if they were to hear of Mr.\r\nGladstone’s definite retirement from public life, still pronounced that it\r\nwas Mr. Gladstone’s majority, and that was what the contributors to that\r\nmajority intended to vote for was, above all else, his return to office\r\nand his supremacy in national affairs. If he would not lay down his power,\r\nsuch persons said, it was best for everybody that he should exercise it\r\nopenly, regularly, and responsibly as head of the government.(367) The\r\nvery fact that he had ceased to be the leader of the opposition five years\r\nbefore, was turned into an argument for his responsibility now; for it was\r\nhis individual freedom that had enabled him to put forth all his strength,\r\nwithout any of that management and reserve that would have been needed in\r\none who was titular leader of a party, as well as real leader of the\r\nnation. The victory would have been shorn of half its glory if any other\r\nchief had been given to the party. In short, no minister, not Pitt in\r\n1784, nor Grey in 1831, nor Peel ten years later, nor Palmerston in 1855,\r\nwas ever summoned by more direct and personal acclaim. Whatever liberty of\r\nchoice the theory of our constitution assigned to the Queen, in practice\r\nthis choice did not now exist. It was true that in the first of his\r\nMidlothian speeches Mr. Gladstone had used these words, “I hope the\r\nverdict of the country will give to Lord Granville and Lord Hartington the\r\nresponsible charge of its affairs.”(368) But events had wrought a\r\nsurprise, and transformed the situation.\r\n\r\nSome, indeed, there were whom a vision of another kind possessed; a vision\r\nof the moral grandeur that would attend his retirement after putting\r\nApollyon and his legions to flight, and planting his own hosts in triumph\r\nin the full measure of their predominance. Some who loved him, might still\r\nregretfully cherish for him this heroic dream. Retirement might indeed\r\nhave silenced evil tongues; it would have spared him the toils of many\r\nturbid and tempestuous years. But public life is no idyll. Mr. Gladstone\r\nhad put himself, by exertions designed for public objects, into a position\r\nfrom which retreat to private ease would have been neither unselfish nor\r\nhonourable. Is it not an obvious test of true greatness in a statesman,\r\nthat he shall hold popularity, credit, ascendency and power such as Mr.\r\nGladstone now commanded, as a treasure to be employed with regal profusion\r\nfor the common good, not guarded in a miser’s strong-box? For this outlay\r\nof popularity the coming years were to provide Mr. Gladstone with\r\noccasions only too ample.\r\n\r\nIf retreat was impossible, then all the rest was inevitable. And it is\r\neasy to guess the course of his ruminations between his return from\r\nMidlothian and his arrival in Harley Street. Mr. Gladstone himself,\r\nlooking back seventeen years after, upon his refusal in 1880 to serve in a\r\nplace below the first, wrote: “I conceive that I was plainly right in\r\ndeclining it, for had I acted otherwise, I should have placed the facts of\r\nthe case in conflict with its rights, and with the just expectations of\r\nthe country. Besides, as the head of a five years’ ministry, and as still\r\nin full activity, I should have been strangely placed as the subordinate\r\nof one twenty years my junior, and comparatively little tested in public\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nAs the diary records, on Monday, April 12, Lord Wolverton left Hawarden,\r\nand was to see the two liberal leaders the same day. He did so, and\r\nreported briefly to his chief at night:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I hope the Plimsoll matter(369) is at an end. The clubs to-night\r\n    think that Lord Beaconsfield will meet parliament, and that when\r\n    the time comes, if asked, he will advise that Hartington should be\r\n    sent for. I do not believe either. I have seen Lord Granville and\r\n    Hartington; both came here upon my arrival, and Adam with them.\r\n    Lord Granville hopes you may be in London on Friday. I told him I\r\n    thought you would be. He has gone to Walmer, and will come up on\r\n    Friday. He has a good deal to think of in the meantime as to “the\r\n    position of the party.” I need not say more than this, as it\r\n    embraces the whole question, which he _now quite appreciates_....\r\n    Nothing could be more cordial and kind than Granville and\r\n    Hartington, but I hardly think till to-day they _quite_ realised\r\n    the _position_, which I confess seems to me as clear as the sun at\r\n    noon. They will neither of them speak to any one till Friday, when\r\n    Lord Granville hopes to see you. Adam is much pleased with your\r\n    kind note to him. He has gone home till Friday. It is well to be\r\n    away just now, for the gossip and questioning is unbearable.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledging this on the following day (April 13), Mr. Gladstone says to\r\nLord Wolverton:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The claim, so to speak, of Granville and Hartington, or rather, I\r\n    should say, of Granville with Hartington as against me, or rather\r\n    as compared with me, is complete. My labours as an individual\r\n    cannot set me up as a Pretender. Moreover, if they should on\r\n    surveying their position see fit to apply to me, there is only one\r\n    form and ground of application, so far as I see, which could be\r\n    seriously entertained by me, namely, their conviction that on the\r\n    ground of public policy, all things considered, it was best in the\r\n    actual position of affairs that I should come out. It cannot be\r\n    made a matter of ceremonial, as by gentlemen waiving a precedence,\r\n    or a matter of feeling, as by men of high and delicate honour\r\n    determined to throw their bias against themselves. They have no\r\n    right to throw their bias against themselves—they have no right to\r\n    look at anything but public policy; and this I am sure will be\r\n    their conviction. Nothing else can possibly absolve them from\r\n    their presumptive obligation as standing at the head of the party\r\n    which for the time represents the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I find no evidence that the two leaders ever did\r\nexpress a conviction that public policy required that he should stand\r\nforth as a pretender for the post of prime minister. On the contrary, when\r\nLord Wolverton says that they “did not quite realise the position” on the\r\n12th, this can only mean that they hardly felt that conviction about the\r\nrequirements of public policy, which Mr. Gladstone demanded as the\r\nfoundation of his own decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last meeting of the outgoing cabinet was held on April 21. What next\r\ntook place has been described by Mr. Gladstone himself in memoranda\r\nwritten during the days on which the events occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Interview with Lord Hartington._\r\n\r\n    _April 22, 1880._ At 7 P.M. Hartington came to see me at\r\n    Wolverton’s house and reported on his journey to Windsor.\r\n\r\n    The Queen stood with her back to the window—which _used_ not to be\r\n    her custom. On the whole I gathered that her manner was more or\r\n    less embarrassed but towards him not otherwise than gracious and\r\n    confiding. She told him that she desired him to form an\r\n    administration, and pressed upon him strongly his duty to assist\r\n    her as a responsible leader of the party now in a large majority.\r\n    I could not find that she expressed clearly her reason for\r\n    appealing to him as _a_ responsible leader of the party, and yet\r\n    going past _the_ leader of the party, namely Granville, whom no\r\n    one except himself has a title to displace. She however indicated\r\n    to him her confidence in his moderation, the phrase under which he\r\n    is daily commended in the _Daily Telegraph_, at this moment I\r\n    think, Beaconsfield’s personal organ and the recipient of his\r\n    inspirations. By this moderation, the Queen intimated that\r\n    Hartington was distinguished from Granville as well as from me.\r\n\r\n    Hartington, in reply to her Majesty, made becoming\r\n    acknowledgments, and proceeded to say that he did not think a\r\n    government could be satisfactorily formed without me; he had not\r\n    had any direct communication with me; but he had reason to believe\r\n    that I would not take any office or post in the government except\r\n    that of first minister. Under those circumstances he advised her\r\n    Majesty to place the matter in my hands. The Queen continued to\r\n    urge upon him the obligations arising out of his position, and\r\n    desired him to ascertain whether he was right in his belief that I\r\n    would not act in a ministry unless as first minister. This, he\r\n    said, is a question which I should not have put to you, except\r\n    when desired by the Queen.\r\n\r\n    I said her Majesty was quite justified, I thought, in requiring\r\n    positive information, and he, therefore, in putting the question\r\n    to me. Of my action he was already in substantial possession, as\r\n    it had been read to him (he had told me) by Wolverton. I am not\r\n    asked, I said, for reasons, but only for Aye or No, and\r\n    consequently I have only to say that I adhere to my reply as you\r\n    have already conveyed it to the Queen.\r\n\r\n    In making such a reply, it was my duty to add that in case a\r\n    government should be formed by him, or by Granville with him, whom\r\n    the Queen seemed to me wrongly to have passed by—it was to\r\n    Granville that I had resigned my trust, and he, Hartington, was\r\n    subsequently elected by the party to the leadership in the House\r\n    of Commons—my duty would be plain. It would be to give them all\r\n    the support in my power, both negatively, as by absence or\r\n    non-interference, and positively. Promises of this kind, I said,\r\n    stood on slippery ground, and must always be understood with the\r\n    limits which might be prescribed by conviction. I referred to the\r\n    extreme caution, almost costiveness, of Peel’s replies to Lord\r\n    Russell, when he was endeavouring to form a government in December\r\n    1845 for the purpose of carrying the repeal of the Corn Law. In\r\n    this case, however, I felt a tolerable degree of confidence,\r\n    because I was not aware of any substantive divergence of ideas\r\n    between us, and I had observed with great satisfaction, when his\r\n    address to North-East Lancashire came into my hands, after the\r\n    writing but before the publication of mine to Midlothian, that\r\n    they were in marked accordance as to opinions, if not as to form\r\n    and tone, and I did not alter a word. In the case of the first\r\n    Palmerston government I had certainly been thrown into rather\r\n    sharp opposition after I quitted it, but this was mainly due to\r\n    finance. I had not approved of the finance of Sir George Lewis,\r\n    highly as I estimated his judgment in general politics; and it was\r\n    in some ways a relief to me, when we had become colleagues in the\r\n    second Palmerston government, to find that he did not approve of\r\n    mine. However, I could only make such a declaration as the nature\r\n    of the case allowed.\r\n\r\n    He received all this without comment, and said his conversation\r\n    with her Majesty had ended as it began, each party adhering to the\r\n    ground originally taken up. He had not altered his advice, but had\r\n    come under her Majesty’s command to learn my intentions, which he\r\n    was to make known to her Majesty returning to Windsor _this_ day\r\n    at one.\r\n\r\n    He asked me what I thought of the doctrine of obligation so much\r\n    pressed upon him by the Queen. I said that in my opinion the case\r\n    was clear enough. Her Majesty had not always acted on the rule of\r\n    sending for the leader of the opposition. Palmerston was the known\r\n    and recognised leader of the opposition in 1859, but the Queen\r\n    sent for Granville. The leader, if sent for, was in my opinion\r\n    bound either to serve himself, or to point out some other course\r\n    to her Majesty which he might deem to be more for the public\r\n    advantage. And if that course should fail in consequence of the\r\n    refusal of the person pointed out, the leader of the party could\r\n    not leave her Majesty unprovided with a government, but would be\r\n    bound in loyalty to undertake the task.\r\n\r\n    I did not indicate, nor did he ask, what I should do if sent for.\r\n    He did not indicate, nor did I ask, what he should do if the Queen\r\n    continued to press him to go on, in spite of his advice to her to\r\n    move in another direction.—_April 23, 1880._\r\n\r\n\r\nA barren controversy was afterwards raised on the question whether at this\r\nexciting moment Lord Hartington tried to form a government. What he did,\r\naccording to the memorandum, was to advise the Queen to send for Mr.\r\nGladstone, on the ground of his belief that Mr. Gladstone would join no\r\ngovernment of which he was not the head. The Queen then urged him to make\r\nsure of this, before she would acquiesce in his refusal to undertake the\r\ncommission. The Queen, as Mr. Gladstone says, had a right to require\r\npositive information, and Lord Hartington had a right, and it was even his\r\nduty, to procure this information for her, and to put the direct question\r\nto Mr. Gladstone, whether he would or would not act in an administration\r\nof which he was not the head. He went back to Windsor, not in the position\r\nof a statesman who has tried to form a government and failed, but in the\r\nposition of one who had refused a task because he knew all along that\r\nfailure was certain, and now brought proof positive that his refusal was\r\nright.(370)\r\n\r\nWhat happened next was easy to foresee:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Interview with Lord Granville and Lord Hartington._\r\n\r\n    _April 23, 1880._—Soon after half-past three to-day, Lord\r\n    Granville and Lord Hartington arrived from Windsor at my house,\r\n    and signified to me the Queen’s command that I should repair to\r\n    Windsor, where she would see me at half-past six.\r\n\r\n    The purport of Lord Hartington’s conversation with me yesterday\r\n    had been signified. They had jointly advised thereupon that I\r\n    should be sent for with a view to the formation of a government,\r\n    and her Majesty desired Lord Granville would convey to me the\r\n    message. I did not understand that there had been any lengthened\r\n    audience, or any reference to details.\r\n\r\n    Receiving this intimation, I read to them an extract from an\r\n    article in the _Daily News_ of yesterday,(371) descriptive of\r\n    their position relatively to me, and of mine to them, and said\r\n    that, letting drop the epithets, so I understood the matter. I\r\n    presumed, therefore, that under the circumstances as they were\r\n    established before their audience, they had unitedly advised the\r\n    sovereign that it was most for the public advantage to send for\r\n    me. To this they assented. I expressed, a little later, my sense\r\n    of the high honour and patriotism with which they had acted; said\r\n    that I had endeavoured to fulfil my own duty, but was aware I\r\n    might be subject to severe criticism for my resignation of the\r\n    leadership five years ago, which I had forced upon them; but I did\r\n    it believing in good faith that we were to have quiet times, and\r\n    for the first years, 1875 and 1876, and to the end of the session\r\n    I had acted in a manner conformable to that resignation, and had\r\n    only been driven from my corner by compulsion. They made no reply,\r\n    but Granville had previously told me he was perfectly satisfied as\r\n    to my communications with him.\r\n\r\n    I at once asked whether I might reckon, as I hoped, on their\r\n    co-operation in the government. Both assented. Granville agreed to\r\n    take the foreign office, but modestly and not as of right. I\r\n    proposed the India office as next, and as very near in weight, and\r\n    perhaps the most difficult of all at this time, to Hartington,\r\n    which he desired time to consider. I named Childers as the most\r\n    proper person for the war office. As I had to prepare for Windsor,\r\n    our interview was not very long; and they agreed to come again\r\n    after dinner.\r\n\r\n    We spoke of the governor-generalship, at least I spoke to\r\n    Granville who stayed a little after Hartington, and I said\r\n    Goschen’s position as to the franchise would prevent his being in\r\n    the cabinet now, but he should be in great employ. Granville had\r\n    had the lead in the conversation, and said the Queen requested\r\n    _him_ to carry the message to me.\r\n\r\n    _Audience at Windsor._\r\n\r\n    _Windsor Castle, April 23, 1880._—At 6.50 I went to the Queen, who\r\n    received me with perfect courtesy, from which she never deviates.\r\n    Her Majesty presumed I was in possession of the purport of her\r\n    communications with Lord Granville and with Lord Hartington, and\r\n    wished to know, as the administration of Lord Beaconsfield had\r\n    been “turned out,” whether I was prepared to form a government.\r\n    She thought she had acted constitutionally in sending for the\r\n    recognised leaders of the party, and referring the matter to them\r\n    in the first instance. I said that if I might presume to speak,\r\n    nothing could in my views be more correct than her Majesty’s view\r\n    that the application should be so made (I did not refer to the\r\n    case as _between_ Lord Granville and Lord Hartington), and that it\r\n    would have been an error to pass them by and refer to me. They had\r\n    stood, I said, between me and the position of a candidate for\r\n    office, and it was only their advising her Majesty to lay her\r\n    commands upon me, which could warrant my thinking of it after all\r\n    that had occurred. But since they had given this advice, it was\r\n    not consistent with my duty to shrink from any responsibility\r\n    which I had incurred, and I was aware that I had incurred a very\r\n    great responsibility. I therefore humbly accepted her Majesty’s\r\n    commission.\r\n\r\n    Her Majesty wished to know, in order that she might acquaint Lord\r\n    Beaconsfield, whether I could undertake to form a government, or\r\n    whether I only meant that I would make the attempt. I said I had\r\n    obtained the co-operation of Lord Granville and Lord Hartington,\r\n    and that my knowledge and belief as to prevailing dispositions\r\n    would, I think, warrant me in undertaking to form a government, it\r\n    being her Majesty’s pleasure. I had ascertained that Lord\r\n    Granville would be willing to accept the foreign office; and I had\r\n    also to say that the same considerations which made it my duty to\r\n    accept office, seemed also to make it my duty to submit myself to\r\n    her Majesty’s pleasure for the office of chancellor of the\r\n    exchequer together with that of first lord of the treasury.\r\n\r\n    She asked if I had thought of any one for the war office, which\r\n    was very important. The report of the Commission would show that\r\n    Lord Cardwell’s system of short service had entirely broken down,\r\n    and that a change must be made at any rate as regarded the\r\n    non-commissioned officers. Lord Hartington had assured her that no\r\n    one was committed to the system except Lord Cardwell, and he was\r\n    very unwell and hardly able to act. Lord Hartington knew the war\r\n    office, and she thought would make a good war minister. I said\r\n    that it seemed to me in the present state of the country the first\r\n    object was to provide for the difficulties of statesmanship, and\r\n    then to deal with those of administration. The greatest of all\r\n    these difficulties, I thought, centred in the India office, and I\r\n    was very much inclined to think Lord Hartington would be eminently\r\n    qualified to deal with them, and would thereby take a place in the\r\n    government suitable to his position and his probable future.\r\n\r\n    She asked, to whom, then, did I think of entrusting the war\r\n    office? [Resumed this afternoon, April 24.](372) I said Mr.\r\n    Childers occurred to me as an administrator of eminent capacity\r\n    and conciliatory in his modes of action; his mind would be open on\r\n    the grave subjects treated by the Commission, which did not appear\r\n    to me to be even for Lord Cardwell matters of committal, but\r\n    simply of public policy to be determined by public advantage. She\r\n    thought that Mr. Childers had not been popular at the admiralty,\r\n    and that it was desirable the secretary for war should be liked by\r\n    the army. I said that there was an occurrence towards the close of\r\n    his term which placed him in a difficult position, but relied on\r\n    his care and discretion. (She did not press the point, but is\r\n    evidently under strong professional bias.)\r\n\r\n    She spoke of the chancellorship, and I named Lord Selborne.\r\n\r\n    She referred to general action and hoped it would be conciliatory.\r\n    I said that every one who had served the crown for even a much\r\n    smaller term of years than I had the good or ill fortune to\r\n    reckon, would know well that an incoming government must recognise\r\n    existing engagements, and must take up, irrespective of its\r\n    preferences, whatever was required by the character and honour of\r\n    the country. I referred to the case of Scinde and Sir R. Peel’s\r\n    cabinet in 1843; which she recognised as if it had been recently\r\n    before her.\r\n\r\n    She said, “I must be frank with you, Mr. Gladstone, and must\r\n    fairly say that there have been some expressions”—I think she said\r\n    some little things, which had caused her concern or pain. I said\r\n    that her Majesty’s frankness, so well known, was a main ground of\r\n    the entire reliance of her ministers upon her. That I was\r\n    conscious of having incurred a great responsibility, and felt the\r\n    difficulty which arises when great issues are raised, and a man\r\n    can only act and speak upon the best lights he possesses, aware\r\n    all the time that he may be in error. That I had undoubtedly used\r\n    a mode of speech and language different in some degree from what I\r\n    should have employed, had I been the leader of a party or a\r\n    candidate for office. Then as regarded conciliation, in my opinion\r\n    the occasion for what I had described had wholly passed away, and\r\n    that so far as I was concerned, it was my hope that her Majesty\r\n    would not find anything to disapprove in my general tone; that my\r\n    desire and effort would be to diminish, her cares, in any case not\r\n    to aggravate them; that, however, considering my years, I could\r\n    only look to a short term of active exertion and a personal\r\n    retirement comparatively early. With regard to the freedom of\r\n    language I had admitted, she said with some good-natured archness,\r\n    “But you will have to bear the consequences,” to which I entirely\r\n    assented. She seemed to me, if I may so say, “natural under\r\n    effort.” All things considered, I was much pleased. I ended by\r\n    kissing her Majesty’s hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M200) The usual embarrassments in building a government filled many days\r\nwith unintermittent labour of a kind that, like Peel, Mr. Gladstone found\r\nintensely harassing, though interesting. The duty of leaving out old\r\ncolleagues can hardly have been other than painful, but Mr. Gladstone was\r\na man of business, and lie reckoned on a proper stoicism in the victims of\r\npublic necessity. To one of them he wrote, “While I am the oldest man of\r\nmy political generation, I have been brought by the seeming force of\r\nexceptional circumstances to undertake a task requiring less of years and\r\nmore of vigour than my accumulating store of the one and waning residue of\r\nthe other, and I shall be a solecism in the government which I have\r\nundertaken to form. I do not feel able to ask you to resume the toils of\r\noffice,” etc., but would like to name him the recipient for a signal mark\r\nof honour. “I have not the least right to be disappointed when you select\r\nyounger men for your colleagues,” the cheerful man replied. Not all were\r\nso easily satisfied. “It is cruel to make a disqualification for others\r\nout of an infirmity of my own,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to the oldest of his\r\ncomrades in the Peelite days, but—et cetera, et cetera, and he would be\r\nglad to offer his old ally the red riband of the Bath when one should be\r\nvacant. The peer to whom this letter with its dubious solatium was\r\naddressed, showed his chagrin by a reply of a single sentence: that he did\r\nnot wish to leave the letter unanswered, lest it should seem to admit that\r\nhe was in a state of health which he did not feel to be the case; the red\r\nriband was not even declined. One admirable man with intrepid _naïveté_\r\nproposed himself for the cabinet, but was not admitted; another no less\r\nadmirable was pressed to enter, but felt that he could be more useful as\r\nan independent member, and declined—an honourable transaction repeated by\r\nthe same person on more than one occasion later. To one excellent member\r\nof his former cabinet, the prime minister proposed the chairmanship of\r\ncommittee, and it was with some tartness refused. Another equally\r\nexcellent member of the old administration he endeavoured to plant out in\r\nthe viceregal lodge at Dublin, without the cabinet, but in vain. To a\r\nthird he proposed the Indian vice-royalty, and received an answer that\r\nleft him “stunned and out of breath.” As the hours passed and office after\r\noffice was filled up, curiosity grew vivacious as to the fate appointed\r\nfor the younger generation of radicals. The great posts had gone to\r\npatrician whigs, just as if Mr. Gladstone had been a Grey or a Russell. As\r\nwe have seen, he had secured Lord Granville and Lord Hartington before he\r\nwent to Windsor, and on the evening of his return, the first person to\r\nwhom he applied was Lord Derby, one of the most sagacious men of his day,\r\nbut a great territorial noble and a very recent convert. He declined\r\noffice on the ground that if a man changes his party connection, he is\r\nbound to give proof that he wishes the change from no merely personal\r\nmotive, and that he is not a gainer by it.\r\n\r\nMr. Bright had joined, it was true, and Mr. Forster, but Bright the new\r\nradicals honoured and revered without any longer following, and with\r\nForster they had quarrelled violently upon education, nor was the quarrel\r\never healed. One astute adviser, well acquainted with the feeling and\r\nexpectations of the left wing, now discovered to his horror that Mr.\r\nGladstone was not in the least alive to the importance of the leaders of\r\nthe radical section, and had never dreamed of them for his cabinet. His\r\nview seems to have been something of this kind, “You have been saved from\r\nwhig triumph in the person of Lord Hartington; now that you have got me to\r\nkeep the balance, I must have a whig cabinet.” He was, moreover, still\r\naddicted to what he called Peel’s rule against admitting anybody straight\r\ninto the cabinet without having held previous office. At last he sent for\r\nSir Charles Dilke. To his extreme amazement Sir Charles refused to serve,\r\nunless either himself or Mr. Chamberlain were in the cabinet; the prime\r\nminister might make his choice between them; then the other would accept a\r\nsubordinate post. Mr. Gladstone discoursed severely on this unprecedented\r\nenormity, and the case was adjourned. Mr. Bright was desired to interfere,\r\nbut the pair remained inexorable. In the end the lot fell on Mr.\r\nChamberlain. “Your political opinions,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to him (April\r\n27), “may on some points go rather beyond what I may call the general\r\nmeasure of the government, but I hope and believe that there can be no\r\npractical impediment on this score to your acceptance of my proposal.” So\r\nMr. Chamberlain took office at the board of trade, where Mr. Gladstone\r\nhimself had begun his effective career in administration nearly forty\r\nyears before; and his confederate went as under-secretary to the foreign\r\noffice. At that time the general feeling was that Sir Charles Dilke, long\r\nin parliament and a man of conspicuous mark within its walls, was rather\r\nbadly used, and that Mr. Gladstone ought to have included both. All this\r\nwas the ominous prelude of a voyage that was to be made through many\r\nstorms.(373)\r\n\r\nOne incident of these labours of construction may illustrate Mr.\r\nGladstone’s curious susceptibility in certain kinds of personal contest.\r\nHe proposed that Mr. Lowe should be made a viscount, while the Queen\r\nthought that a barony would meet the claim. For once it broke the prime\r\nminister’s sleep; he got up in the middle of the night and dashed off a\r\nletter to Windsor. The letter written, the minister went to bed again, and\r\nwas in an instant sound asleep.\r\n\r\n“The new parliament,” he told his old friend at school and college, Sir\r\nFrancis Doyle (May 10), “will be tested by its acts. It will not draw its\r\ninspiration from me. No doubt it will make changes that will be denounced\r\nas revolutionary, and then recognised as innocent and even good. But I\r\nexpect it to act in the main on well-tried and established lines, and do\r\nmuch for the people and little to disquiet my growing years, or even\r\nyours.” All fell out strangely otherwise, and disquiet marked this second\r\nadministration from its beginning to its end. To lay all the blame on a\r\nprime minister or his cabinet for this, is like blaming the navigator for\r\nwild weather. In spite of storm and flood, great things were done; deep,\r\nnotable, and abiding results ensued. The procedure of parliament underwent\r\na profound revolution. So too did our electoral system in all its aspects.\r\nNew lines of cleavage showed themselves in the divisions of political\r\nparty. A not unimportant episode occurred in the chapter of religious\r\ntoleration. The Irish peasant, after suffering centuries of oppression and\r\ntyrannic wrong, at last got the charter of his liberation. In a more\r\ndistant region, as if to illustrate the power of events against the will\r\nof a statesman and the contemporary opinion of a nation, England for good\r\nor evil found herself planted in the valley of the Nile, and became a\r\nland-power on the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudget Of 1860\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __26_\r\n\r\n_Sir William Heathcote wrote to Mr. Gladstone, May 4, 1861_:—\r\n\r\nI understood you in your rebukes of Lewis in 1857, to be aiming not only\r\nat a change of his plan of finance in that particular year, but (if that\r\nwere impossible, or at least could not be carried), at a resumption as\r\nearly as circumstances would allow, of what you thought the proper line of\r\naction which he insisted on suspending. Income-tax and war duties on tea\r\nand sugar were and would continue to be, as I understood, the primary\r\nclaimants for reduction of taxation, in your judgment.... The very\r\nvehemence of your convictions and expressions on _both_ occasions\r\nperplexes me.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gladstone replied the same day_:—\r\n\r\n... You think, 1. That I bound myself to the reduction of the tea and\r\nsugar duties as a policy for future occasions, and not merely for the\r\nissue then raised. 2. That in like manner I was bound to the reduction and\r\nabolition of the income-tax. 3. That even if there arose in the system of\r\nour expenditure a great change, involving an increase of ten or fifteen\r\nmillions of money over 1853, I was still in consistency bound to hold over\r\nthe first chance of reduction for income-tax, tea and sugar. 4. That\r\nconsequently until these duties were remitted I could not propose to\r\nprosecute any commercial reforms involving, as nearly all of them do, a\r\nsacrifice of revenue for a time. 5. It is because I have departed from\r\nthese positions by proposing a multitude of reductions and abolitions of\r\nduty, other than the three mentioned, and partly or wholly in preference\r\nto them, that you have lost confidence in my judgment on these matters (a\r\nconfidence to which I do not pretend that I had ever any claim).\r\n\r\nIf I have interpreted you aright, and I hope you will tell me whether I\r\nhave done so or not, this is all to me exceedingly curious; such are the\r\ndifferences in the opinions of men formed from their different points of\r\nview. Now I will give you mine. To give effect to the pledge of honour, by\r\nwhich I became bound in 1853, I made a desperate effort in 1857, with all\r\nthe zeal of which I was capable, and with all the passion to which I am\r\nliable. It was my opinion that the course then taken would be decisive as\r\nto the operations in 1860, for the income-tax never can be got rid of\r\nexcept by prospective finance, reaching over several years, and liable to\r\nimpediment and disturbance accordingly. I therefore protested against the\r\nwhole scale of expenditure then proposed; as well as against particular\r\nkinds of expenditure to which I might refer. I likewise protested against\r\nthe provision for that expenditure which the government of the day\r\nproposed. First, because the expenditure itself was excessive, in my view.\r\nSecondly, because in the mode of that provision I thought the remission of\r\nincome-tax was large out of all proportion to the remission on indirect\r\ntaxes; and this disproportion I regarded as highly dangerous. I determined\r\nto let no political prejudice stand in my way, and to test to the best of\r\nmy very feeble power the opinion of parliament with respect to tea and\r\nsugar. I stated that if the opinion of parliament were against me I should\r\nnot factiously prolong the contest but should withdraw from it. Not only\r\nwas the opinion of parliament against me, but it so happened that the\r\nopinion of the country was immediately afterwards taken by a dissolution\r\non that and on other kindred questions. The country affirmed the policy of\r\nLord Palmerston, and the policy of a materially increased expenditure, by\r\nan overwhelming majority. I had misjudged public opinion; they had read it\r\naright. After the dissolution of 1857, Sir George Lewis, who had\r\npreviously raised the tea and sugar duties for one year, proposed to raise\r\nthem for two more. I immediately followed in debate, and thanked him\r\nwarmly for doing it. All this of course I can prove. I said, we are going\r\nto have more expenditure, we must therefore have more taxation.\r\n\r\nAs I have gone thus far with my history, I will conclude it.\r\nNotwithstanding what had happened, I did not absolutely abandon at that\r\ntime the hope that we might still reach in 1860 a state which might enable\r\nus to abolish the income-tax. I had a faint expectation of more economy\r\nunder another government. When Lord Derby’s administration came in in\r\n1858, they professed to reduce expenditure by £800,000, and to contemplate\r\nfurther reductions. I expressed my satisfaction, and gave them the extreme\r\nof support that I could. But I then clearly pointed out that, even with\r\nthe scale of expenditure they then proposed, we could not abolish the\r\nincome-tax in 1860. In a few months, their reductions vanished into air.\r\nIn 1859 came the famous “reconstruction.” I took office in June, and found\r\na scale of expenditure going on in the treasury far more prodigal and\r\nwanton than I had ever charged upon Lord Palmerston’s first government. I\r\nfound also that when the estimates had been completed, I believe entirely\r\non _their_ basis, there was a probable deficiency of four or five millions\r\nfor a year of which nearly one-third had passed. And the expenditure was I\r\nthink nearly seventy millions, or some fourteen millions more than in\r\n1853. This was not the act only of the government. The opposition halloed\r\nthem on; and the country, seized with a peculiar panic, was in a humour\r\neven more lavish than the opposition.\r\n\r\nMy view was, and I stated it, that we ought to provide for this\r\nexpenditure in a due proportion between direct and indirect taxes. I\r\nshowed that this proportion had not been observed; that we had continued\r\nto levy large amounts of war tax on tea and sugar, and had returned to the\r\nscale of 1853 for income. I proposed to provide the necessary sums chiefly\r\nby an increase of income-tax. But neither then (in July 1859), nor for\r\nnearly two and a half years before, had I ever (to my knowledge) presumed\r\nto speak of any one as bound to abolish the income-tax or to remit the\r\nadditional duties on tea and sugar.\r\n\r\nI fully expect from _you_ the admission that as to these measures I could\r\nnot in the altered circumstances be bound absolutely to the remissions.\r\nBut you say I was bound to give them a preference over all other\r\nremissions. Nowhere I believe can one word to this effect be extracted\r\nfrom any speech of mine. I found in 1860 that all the reforming\r\nlegislation, which had achieved such vast results, had been suspended for\r\nseven years. We were then raising by duties doomed in 1853, from twelve to\r\nthirteen millions. It would in my opinion have been no less than monstrous\r\non my part to recognise the preferences you claim for these particular\r\nduties. All of them indeed would have been reliefs, even the income-tax\r\nwhich is I think proved to be the least relief of any. But, though\r\nreliefs, they were hardly reforms; and experience had shown us that\r\nreforms were in fact double and treble reliefs. I may be wrong, but it is\r\nmy opinion and I found it on experience, that the prospect of the removal\r\nof the three collectively (income, tea extra, and sugar extra) being in\r\nany case very remote, it is less remote with than without the reforming\r\nmeasures of the last and (I hope I may add) of the present year. Had the\r\nexpenditure of 1853 been resumed, there would notwithstanding the Russian\r\nwar have been, in my opinion, room for all these three things. 1.\r\nAbolition of income-tax by or near 1860; 2. remission of increases on tea\r\nand sugar within the same time; 3. the prosecution of the commercial\r\nreforms.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that having set my face against an excess of expenditure I\r\nought to have considered that a holy war, and not to have receded.\r\nAlthough I place public economy somewhat higher as a matter of duty than\r\nmany might do, I do not think it would have been right, I do think it\r\nwould have been foolish and presumptuous in me to have gone beyond these\r\ntwo things: first, making an effort to the utmost of my power at the\r\ncritical moment (as I took it to be), and secondly, on being defeated to\r\nwatch for opportunities thereafter. Since it should be remembered I do not\r\nrecommend or desire sweeping and sudden reductions.\r\n\r\nThe chief errors that I see myself to have committed are these. In 1853\r\nwhen I took the unusual course of estimating our income for seven years,\r\nand assuming that our expenditure would either continue as it was, or only\r\nmove onwards gradually and gently, I ought no doubt to have pointed out\r\nexplicitly, that a great disturbance and increase of our expenditure would\r\nbaffle my reckonings. Again in 1857 the temper of the public mind had\r\nundergone a change which I failed to discern; and I attacked the\r\ngovernment and the chancellor of the exchequer of that day for doing what\r\nthe country desired though I did not. I name these as specific errors,\r\nover and above the general one of excess of heat.\r\n\r\nThe budget of last year I cannot admit to have been an error. People say\r\nit should have been smaller. My belief is that if it had been a smaller\r\nboat it would not have lived in such a sea. I speak of the period of the\r\nsession before the China war became certain. When it did so, we were in a\r\ngreat strait about the paper duty. We felt the obligation incurred by the\r\nvote on the second reading, and we construed it according to the\r\nestablished usage. We took the more arduous, but I think the more\r\nhonourable course for a government to pursue. Had we abandoned the bill, I\r\nknow not how we could have looked in the face those who had acted and\r\ninvested on the faith of an unbroken practice. I admit that political\r\nmotives greatly concurred to recommend the budget of last year. It was a\r\nbudget of peace, and peace wanted it. The budget of this year followed\r\nfrom the budget of last, given the other circumstances. At the same time I\r\ncan understand how the claim of tea could be set up, but not well after\r\nthe occurrences of last year how it could be supported.\r\n\r\nThis is a long egotistical story. But when you consider that it contains\r\nmy whole story (except _pièces justificatives_) in answer to so many\r\nspeeches in both Houses and elsewhere, for never to this hour have I\r\nopened my lips in personal defence, you will understand why I might be\r\ngarrulous....\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the mild doctrine I have held about expenditure I admit it\r\nmay be said I ought not to have joined a government which had such\r\nextended views in that direction, even though they were the views of the\r\nnation. Much may be said on this. I may, however, remark that when the\r\ngovernment was formed I did not fully conceive the extent to which we\r\nshould proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet. 1860\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __36_\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gladstone’s memorandum on the currents of opinion in the cabinet of\r\n1860 concludes as follows_:—\r\n\r\n1. The most Italian members of the cabinet have been: Lord Palmerston,\r\nLord John Russell, W.E.G., Gibson, Argyll. The least Italian: Lewis, Wood,\r\nGrey, Herbert, Villiers (especially).\r\n\r\n2. In foreign policy generally the most combative have been: Lord\r\nPalmerston, Lord John Russell, Duke of Newcastle, the chancellor. The\r\nleast combative: Duke of Somerset, Duke of Argyll, Granville, Gibson,\r\nHerbert, Lewis, Grey, W.E.G., Wood, the same in feeling but not active.\r\n\r\n3. In defences and expenditure, the most alarmed, or most martial (as the\r\ncase may be), have been: Lord Palmerston, Lord John Russell, Duke of\r\nNewcastle, S. Herbert, followed by Duke of Somerset, the chancellor,\r\nGranville, Cardwell. Inclined the other way: Gibson, W.E.G., Lewis, Grey,\r\nDuke of Argyll (Elgin, I think).\r\n\r\n4. In finance some are for movement, some stationary or retrograde so as\r\nto be ready for immediate war. Yet here we are not divided simply as\r\ncombative or anti-combative. The onward men in finance are: Lord John\r\nRussell, Duke of Newcastle, Granville, Argyll, Gibson, W.E.G., and, I\r\nthink, the chancellor. The stationary men are, first and foremost: Sir\r\nGeorge Lewis, Sir C. Wood; next to these, Lord Palmerston, Cardwell, and,\r\nI think, Villiers, Herbert.\r\n\r\n5. On reform I must distinguish between (_a_) extension of the franchise\r\nand (_b_) redistribution of seats. In the first the more liberal men are:\r\nLord John Russell, Duke of Somerset, Duke of Newcastle, Duke of Argyll,\r\nGibson, W.E.G. The fearful or opposed are: Lord Palmerston, C. Villiers,\r\nS. Herbert. In the second, for small disfranchisement were, I think, all\r\nthe first except Newcastle. For larger disfranchisement: Newcastle,\r\nVilliers, and Lord Palmerston, I think not greatly averse. In fact, I\r\nthink that larger disfranchisement of places may have been favoured by\r\nhim, 1. as a substitute for enlargement of the franchise, which he chiefly\r\ndreads; 2. as perhaps an obstacle to the framing of a measure.\r\n\r\n6. In church matters Herbert, Newcastle, and I are the most conservative\r\nand the most church-like; with a sympathy from Argyll. But, as I said,\r\nthere is no struggle here: patronage, the sore subject, not being a\r\ncabinet affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSession Of 1860\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __47_\r\n\r\n_Extract from a Letter to the Duke of Argyll._\r\n\r\n_Penmaen., September 3, 1860._—The session has been one to make all of us\r\nthoughtful, and me perhaps most of all. It is indeed much before my mind,\r\nbut my head has not ceased to whirl, so that I cannot get a clear view of\r\nwhat Seward would call my position. Two things I know, one is that it\r\nproduced the greatest pleasures and the greatest pains I have ever known\r\nin politics; the other that 1 have had to take various decisions and\r\nperform acts that could neither be satisfactory to others, nor from the\r\ndoubt attaching to one side or the other of the alternative, even to\r\nmyself. To have been the occasion of the blow to the House of Commons, or\r\nas I call it the “gigantic innovation,” will be a grief to me as long as I\r\nlive; if by wildness and rashness I have been its cause, it will be a much\r\ngreater grief. Of that I am not yet able to judge. On the whole when I\r\nthink of the cabinet, I always go back to Jacob and Esau fighting in their\r\nmother’s womb; only here there have been many Jacobs and Esaus, by which I\r\ndo not mean the sixteen members of the cabinet, but the many and very\r\nunhandy causes of division. Perhaps I should find it easiest in the work\r\nof confession to own my neighbour’s faults, _i.e._ to dwell upon those\r\nstrange sins of foreign policy which have happily for the most part been\r\nnipped in the bud almost _à l’unanimité_ (yet with what exceptions!); but\r\navoiding that task, I will make my own confession. I cannot justify the\r\nfinance of the year as a whole.... As to the amount of the final demand\r\n[for the China war], what it really demonstrates is _one_ among the\r\nfollies and dangers of our high-handed policy, our want of control over\r\nproceedings at the other end of the world. But the weak point is the\r\nfortification plan; I do not now speak of its own merits or demerits, but\r\nI speak of it in relation to the budget.... It is a vile precedent to give\r\naway money by remission, and borrow to supply the void; and in the full\r\nand _chief_ responsibility for having established this precedent I am\r\ninvolved, not by the budget of February but by the consent of July to the\r\nscheme which involved the borrowing. No doubt there are palliating\r\ncircumstances; and lastly the grievous difficulty of choice between\r\nmischievous [_illegible_] and mischievous resignation. Still I must say,\r\nit is in retrospect, as the people and parliament have a right to judge\r\nit, a bad and unworkmanlike business, and under a skilful analysis of it\r\nin the House of Commons (which there is no one opposite fit to make,\r\nexcept it be Northcote, who perhaps scruples it) I should wince. All these\r\nthings and others more inward than these, make sore places in the mind;\r\nbut on the other hand, that I may close with a gleam of sunshine like that\r\nwhich is now casting its shadow on my paper from Penmaenmawr after a rough\r\nmorning, I am thankful in the highest degree to have had a share in\r\nresisting the alarmist mania of the day by means of the French treaty, to\r\nwhich, if we escape collision, I think the escape will have been mainly\r\ndue; and likewise in one at least negative service to the great Italian\r\ncause, which is not Italian merely but European.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt’s War Finance\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __59_\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gladstone to Herbert Gladstone_\r\n\r\n_March 10, 1876._—Mr. Pitt’s position in the Revolutionary war was, I\r\nthink, a false one. To keep out of that war demanded from the people of\r\nthis country an extraordinary degree of self-control, and this degree of\r\nit they did not possess. The consequence of our going into it was to give\r\nan intensity and vitality to the struggle, which but for the tenacity of\r\nEnglish character it would not have possessed. Mr. Pitt did not show the\r\ngreat genius in war which he possessed as a peace minister. Until the\r\nepoch of the Peninsula our military performances were small and poor, and\r\nthe method of subsidy was unsatisfactory and ineffective. The effect of\r\nborrowing money in three per cents. was to load us with a very heavy\r\ncapital of national debt. I think at one time we only got £46, or some\r\nsuch amount, for the £100. It must, however, be taken into view that a\r\nperpetual annuity of £3, redeemable upon paying £100, brought _more_ than\r\n3/4 of what a perpetual annuity of £4, similarly redeemable, would have\r\nbrought; or than 3/5 of what a £5 annuity, similarly redeemable, would\r\nhave brought. It is not easy to strike the balance. Mr. Newmarch, a living\r\neconomist of some authority, I believe, thinks Mr. Pitt was right. I do\r\nnot think the case is so clear against him as to _detract_ from his great\r\nreputation. But were I in the unhappy position of having to call for a\r\nlarge loan, I should be disposed to ask for the tender in more than one\r\nform, _e.g._, to ask for a tender in three per cents, pure and simple, and\r\nan alternative in 4 or 5 per cents., with that rate of interest guaranteed\r\nfor a certain number of years. Sir Robert Walpole had not to contend with\r\nlike difficulties, and I think his administration should be compared with\r\nthe _early years_ of Pitt’s, in which way of judging he would come off\r\nsecond, though a man of cool and sagacious judgment, while morally he\r\nstood low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrench Commercial Treaty. 1860\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __66_\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gladstone at Leeds, October 8, 1881_:—\r\n\r\nI, for my part, look with the deepest interest upon the share that I had\r\nin concluding—I will not say so much in concluding, but in conducting on\r\nthis side of the water, and within the walls of parliament as well as in\r\nadministration—the proceedings which led to the memorable French treaty of\r\n1860. It is quite true that that treaty did not produce the whole of the\r\nbenefits that some too sanguine anticipations may possibly have expected\r\nfrom it, that it did not produce a universal smash of protective duties,\r\nas I wish it had, throughout the civilised world. But it did something. It\r\nenormously increased the trade between this country and France. It\r\neffectually checked and traversed in the year 1860 tendencies of a very\r\ndifferent kind towards needless alarms and panics, and tendencies towards\r\nconvulsions and confusion in Europe. There was no more powerful instrument\r\nfor confining and controlling those wayward and angry spirits at that\r\nparticular crisis, than the commercial treaty with France. It produced no\r\ninconsiderable effect for a number of years upon the legislation of\r\nvarious European countries, which tended less decisively than we could\r\nhave desired, but still intelligibly and beneficially, in the direction of\r\nfreedom of trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __87_\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gladstone to Sir Arthur Gordon (Lord Stanmore)_\r\n\r\n_Downing Street, April 21, 1861._—MY DEAR ARTHUR,—When, within a few days\r\nafter your father’s death, I referred in conversation with you to one or\r\ntwo points in his character, it was from the impulse of the moment, and\r\nwithout any idea of making my words matter of record. Months have now\r\npassed since you asked me to put on paper the substance of what I said.\r\nThe delay has been partly, perhaps mainly, owing to the pressure of other\r\ndemands upon my time and thoughts. But it has also been due to this, that\r\nan instinct similar to that which made me speak, has made me shrink from\r\nwriting. It is enough in conversation to give the most partial and hasty\r\ntouches, provided they be not in the main untrue. Those same touches when\r\nclothed in a form of greater assumption have but a meagre and\r\nunsatisfactory appearance, and may do even positive injustice. Most of all\r\nin the case of a character which was not only of rare quality, but which\r\nwas so remarkable for the fineness of its lights and shadows. But you have\r\na right to my recollections such as they are, and I will not withhold\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI may first refer to the earliest occasion on which I saw him; for it\r\nillustrates a point not unimportant in his history. On an evening in the\r\nmonth of January 1835, during what is called the short government of Sir\r\nRobert Peel, I was sent for by Sir Robert Peel, and received from him the\r\noffer, which I accepted, of the under-secretaryship of the colonies. From\r\nhim I went on to your father, who was then secretary of state in that\r\ndepartment, and who was thus to be, in official home-talk, my master.\r\nWithout any apprehension of hurting you, I may confess, that I went in\r\nfear and trembling. [_Then follows the passage already quoted in vol. i.\r\np. 124._] I was only, I think, for about ten weeks his under-secretary.\r\nBut as some men hate those whom they have injured, so others love those\r\nwhom they have obliged; and his friendship continued warm and\r\nunintermitting for the subsequent twenty-six years of his life.\r\n\r\nSome of his many great qualities adorned him in common with several, or\r\neven with many, other contemporary statesmen: such as clearness of view,\r\nstrength of the deliberative faculty, strong sense of duty, deep devotion\r\nto the crown, and the most thorough and uncompromising loyalty to his\r\nfriends and colleagues. In this loyalty of intention many, I think, are\r\nnot only praiseworthy but perfect. But the loyalty of intention was in him\r\nso assisted by other and distinctive qualities, as to give it a peculiar\r\nefficacy; and any one associated with Lord Aberdeen might always rest\r\nassured that he was safe in his hands. When our law did not allow\r\nprisoners the benefit of counsel, it was commonly said that the judge was\r\ncounsel for the prisoner. Lord Aberdeen was always counsel for the absent.\r\nDoubtless he had pondered much upon the law, “Thou shalt love thy\r\nneighbour as thyself.” It had entered profoundly into his being, and\r\nformed a large part of it. He was strong in his self-respect, but his\r\nrespect for others, not for this man or that but for other men as men, was\r\nmuch more conspicuous. Rarely indeed have I heard him utter a word\r\ncensuring opponents, or concerning those who actually were or had been\r\nfriends, that could have given pain. If and when it was done, it was done\r\nso to speak judicially, upon full and reluctant conviction and with\r\nvisible regret.\r\n\r\nIf I have said that he had much in common with other distinguished men who\r\nwere like him statesmen by profession, it has been by way of preface to\r\nwhat I have now to say; namely, that what has ever struck me in his\r\ncharacter as a whole, was its distinctiveness. There were several mental\r\nvirtues that he possessed in a degree very peculiar; there were, I think,\r\none or two in which he stood almost alone. I am not in myself well\r\nqualified for handling a subject like this, and also my life has been too\r\nhurried to give me the most favourable opportunities. Still I must try to\r\nexplain my meaning. I will name then the following characteristics, one\r\nand all of which were more prominent in him than in any public man I ever\r\nknew: mental calmness; the absence (if for want of better words I may\r\ndescribe it by a negative) of all egoism; the love of exact justice; a\r\nthorough tolerance of spirit; and last and most of all an entire absence\r\nof suspicion.\r\n\r\nThere was something very remarkable in the combination of these qualities,\r\nas well as in their separate possession. Most men who might be happy\r\nenough to have one half his love of justice, would be so tossed with\r\nstorms of indignation at injustice as to lose the balance of their\r\njudgment. But he had or seemed to have all the benefits, all the ennobling\r\nforce of strong emotion, with a complete exemption from its dangers. His\r\nmind seemed to move in an atmosphere of chartered tranquillity, which\r\nallowed him the view of every object, however blinding to others, in its\r\ntrue position and proportion.\r\n\r\nIt has always appeared to me that the love of justice is one of the rarest\r\namong all good qualities, I mean the love of it with full and commanding\r\nstrength. I should almost dare to say there are five generous men to one\r\njust man. The beauty of justice is the beauty of simple form; the beauty\r\nof generosity is heightened with colour and every accessory. The passions\r\nwill often ally themselves with generosity, but they always tend to divert\r\nfrom justice. The man who strongly loves justice must love it for its own\r\nsake, and such a love makes of itself a character of a simple grandeur to\r\nwhich it is hard to find an equal.\r\n\r\nNext to Lord Aberdeen, I think Sir Robert Peel was the most just of the\r\njust men I have had the happiness to know. During the years from 1841 to\r\n1846, when they were respectively foreign secretary and prime minister, as\r\nI was at the board of trade for much of the time, I had occasion to watch\r\nthe two in the conduct of several negotiations that involved commercial\r\ninterests, such as that on the Stade Dues and that on the project of a\r\ncommercial treaty with Portugal. Now and then Sir Robert Peel would show\r\nsome degree of unconscious regard to the mere flesh and blood, if I may so\r\nspeak, of Englishmen; Lord Aberdeen was invariably for putting the most\r\nliberal construction upon both the conduct and the claims of the other\r\nnegotiating state.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no position in this country, in which the love of justice\r\nthat I have ascribed in such extraordinary measure to your father, can be\r\nso severely tested, as that very position of foreign minister, with which\r\nhis name is so closely associated. Nowhere is a man so constantly and in\r\nsuch myriad forms tempted to partiality; nowhere can he do more for\r\njustice; but nowhere is it more clear that all human force is inadequate\r\nfor its end. A nation is rarely just to other nations. Perhaps it is never\r\ntruly just, though sometimes (like individuals) what may be called more\r\nthan just. There can be no difficulty in any country, least of all this,\r\nin finding foreign ministers able and willing to assert the fair and\r\nreasonable claims of their countrymen with courage and with firmness. The\r\ndifficulty is quite of another kind; it is to find the foreign minister,\r\nfirst, who will himself view those claims in the dry light both of reason\r\nand of prudence; secondly, and a far harder task, who will have the\r\ncourage to hazard, and if need be to sacrifice himself in keeping the mind\r\nof his countrymen down to such claims as are strictly fair and reasonable.\r\nLord Aberdeen was most happy in being secretary of state for foreign\r\naffairs in the time and in the political company of two such men as the\r\nDuke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel. He was also happy in the general\r\nprevalence of a spirit of great sobriety in the country, which was\r\nsingularly free under the government of Sir Robert Peel, from the opposite\r\nbut sometimes associated extremes of wantonness and fear. I am glad to\r\nthink that his administration of his department earned a decided public\r\napproval. So just a man will, I think, rarely attain in that department to\r\nthe same measure of popularity, while a less just man might easily obtain\r\none far greater.\r\n\r\nTo fall short of perfect candour would deprive all I have said of the\r\nlittle value it can possess, as that little value is all summed up in its\r\nsincerity. On one subject to which my mind has been directed for the last\r\ntwelve or fourteen years, I had the misfortune to differ from your father.\r\nI mean the state of Italy and its relation to Austria in particular. I\r\nwill not pretend to say that his view of the case of Italy appeared to me\r\nto harmonize with his general mode of estimating human action and\r\npolitical affairs. It seemed to me as if, called in early youth to deal\r\nwith a particular combination of questions which were truly gigantic, his\r\nmind had received from their weight and force at an impressible period, a\r\nfixed form in relation to them, while it ever remained open and elastic in\r\na peculiar degree upon all others. But my mode of solution for what\r\nappeared to me an anomaly is immaterial. I thankfully record that the\r\nItalian question was almost the only one within my recollection, quite the\r\nonly one of practical importance, on which during the twenty-six years I\r\nhave named, I was unable to accept his judgment. I bear witness with yet\r\ngreater pleasure that, when I returned from Naples in 1851 deeply\r\nimpressed with the horrible system that I had witnessed, his opinions on\r\nItalian politics did not prevent his readily undertaking to read the\r\nstatement I had drawn, nor his using, when he had read it, more strong\r\nwords on the subject, which came from lips like his with such peculiar\r\nforce. As readily did he undertake to invoke the aid of the court of\r\nVienna; to which, if I remember right, he transmitted the statement in\r\nmanuscript.\r\n\r\nThough I feel that I cannot by any effort do justice to what I have termed\r\nhis finely-shaded character, I also feel that I might be drawn onwards to\r\ngreat length on the subject. I must resist the impulse, but I cannot stop\r\nwithout saying a word on the quality which I regard as beyond all others\r\nhis own, I mean the absence from his nature of all tendency to suspicion.\r\nThose who have read his state papers, and have admired their penetrating\r\nforce and comprehensive scope, will not misunderstand me when I say that\r\nhe was, in this respect, a little child; not from defect of vision, but\r\nfrom thorough nobleness of nature.\r\n\r\nI do not think it was by effort and self-command that he rid himself of\r\nsuspicion. In the simple and strong aim of the man to be good himself, it\r\nbelonged to the very strength and simplicity of that aim, that he should\r\nalso think others good. I recollect, and I dare say you better recollect,\r\none of his sayings: “I have a habit of believing people.” To some these\r\nwords may not seem to import a peculiarity. But as descriptive of him they\r\nindicate what of all the points of his character seemed to me most\r\npeculiar. I have known one man as free from suspicions as was Lord\r\nAberdeen, but he was not a politician. I am far from thinking statesmen,\r\nor politicians, less honourable than other men, quite the reverse; but the\r\nhabit of their life renders them suspicious. The vicissitudes of politics,\r\nthe changes of position, the changes of alliance, the sharp transitions\r\nfrom co-operation to antagonism, the inevitable contact with revolting\r\ndisplays of self-seeking and self-love; more than all these perhaps, the\r\nconstant habit of forecasting the future and shaping all its contingencies\r\nbeforehand, which is eminently the merit and intellectual virtue of the\r\npolitician, all these tend to make him, and commonly do make him,\r\nsuspicious even of his best friend. This suspicion may be found to exist\r\nin conjunction with regard, with esteem, nay with affection. For it must\r\nbe recollected that it is not usually a suspicion of moral delinquency,\r\nbut at least as it dwells in the better and higher natures, of\r\nintellectual error only, in some of its numerous forms, or at most of\r\nspeaking with a reserve that may be more or less or even wholly\r\nunconscious. None of these explanations are needed for Lord Aberdeen. He\r\nalways took words in their direct and simple meaning, and assumed them to\r\nbe the index of the mind; and its full index too, so that he did not\r\nspeculate to learn what undiscovered residue might still remain in its\r\ndark places. This entire immunity from suspicion, which makes our minds in\r\ngeneral like a haunted place, and the sense of the immunity that he\r\nconveyed to his friends in all his dealings with them, combined with the\r\ndeep serenity of his mind, which ever seemed to beguile and allay by some\r\nkindly process of nature excitement in others, gave an indescribable charm\r\nto all intercourse with him in critical and difficult circumstances. Hence\r\nperhaps in great part, and not merely from his intellectual gifts, was\r\nderived the remarkable power he seemed to me to exercise in winning\r\nconfidences without seeking to win them; and, on the whole, I believe that\r\nthis quality, could we hold it as it was held in him, would save us from\r\nten erroneous judgments for one into which it might lead. For the grand\r\ncharacteristic of suspicion after all, as of superstition, is to see\r\nthings that are not.\r\n\r\nI turn now to another point: Lord Aberdeen was not demonstrative; I do not\r\nsuppose he could have been an actor; he was unstudied in speech; and it is\r\nof interest to inquire what it was that gave such extraordinary force and\r\nimpressiveness to his language. He did not deal in antithesis. His sayings\r\nwere not sharpened with gall. In short, one might go on disclaiming for\r\nhim all the accessories to which most men who are impressive owe their\r\nimpressiveness. Yet I never knew any one who was so impressive in brief\r\nutterances conveying the sum of the matter....\r\n\r\nHistory has also caught and will hold firmly and well the honoured name of\r\nyour father. There was no tarnish upon his reputation more than upon his\r\ncharacter. He will be remembered in connection with great passages of\r\nEuropean policy not only as a man of singularly searching, large, and calm\r\nintelligence, but yet more as the just man, the man that used only true\r\nweights and measures, and ever held even the balance of his ordered mind.\r\nIt is no reproach to other statesmen of this or other periods, to say that\r\nscarcely any of them have had a celebrity so entirely unaided by a\r\ntransitory glare. But if this be so, it implies that while they for the\r\nmost part must relatively lose, he must relatively and greatly gain. If\r\nthey have had stage-lights and he has had none, it is the hour when those\r\nlights are extinguished that will for the first time do that justice as\r\nbetween them which he was too noble, too far aloft in the tone of his\r\nmind, to desire to anticipate. All the qualities and parts in which he was\r\ngreat were those that are the very foundation-stones of our being; as\r\nfoundation-stones they are deep, and as being deep they are withdrawn from\r\nview; but time is their witness and their friend, and in the final\r\ndistribution of posthumous fame Lord Aberdeen has nothing to forfeit, he\r\nhas only to receive.\r\n\r\nI see on perusing what I have written, that in the endeavour to set forth\r\nthe virtues and great qualities of your father, I seem more or less to\r\ndisparage other men, including even Sir Robert Peel whom he so much\r\nesteemed and loved. I had no such intention, and it is the fault of my\r\nhand, not of my will. He would not have claimed, he would not have wished\r\nnor borne, that others should claim for him superiority, or even parity in\r\nall points with all his contemporaries. But there was a certain region of\r\ncharacter which was, so to speak, all his own; and there other men do seem\r\nmore or less dwarfed beside him. In the combination of profound feeling\r\nwith a calm of mind equally profound, of thorough penetration with the\r\nlargest charity, of the wisdom of the serpent with the harmlessness of the\r\ndove, in the total suppression and exclusion of self from his reckonings\r\nand actions—in all this we may think him supreme, and yet have a broad\r\narray of good and noble qualities in which he may have shared variously\r\nwith others. There are other secrets of his character and inner life into\r\nwhich I do not pretend to have penetrated. It always seemed to me that\r\nthere was a treasure-house within him, which he kept closed against the\r\neyes of men. He is gone. He has done well in his generation. May peace and\r\nlight be with him, and may honour and blessing long attend his memory upon\r\nearth.—Believe me, my dear Arthur, affectionately yours, W. E. GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCabinet Of 1868-1874\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __255_\r\n\r\n_First lord of the treasury_,         W. E.

In October Sir Roundell Palmer\r\n(created Lord Selborne) became lord chancellor on the retirement of Lord\r\nHatherley.\r\n\r\nIn August 1873 Lord Ripon and Mr. Childers retired, Mr. Gladstone became\r\nchancellor of the exchequer as well as first lord; Mr. Bright rejoined the\r\ncabinet as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster; Mr. Lowe became home\r\nsecretary and Mr. Bruce (created Lord Aberdare) president of the council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrish Church Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __276_\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gladstone to the Queen_\r\n\r\n_July 21, 1869._—Mr. Gladstone presents his humble duty to your Majesty\r\nand reports that the cabinet met at 11 this day, and considered with\r\nanxious care its position and duty in regard to the Irish Church bill. The\r\nvote and declaration of the House of Lords last night were regarded as\r\nfatal if persisted in; and the cabinet deemed it impossible to meet\r\nproceedings of such a character with any tender of further concessions.\r\nThe cabinet, however, considered at much length a variety of courses; as\r\n(1) To announce at once that they could no longer, after the vote and\r\nannouncement of last night, be responsible for further proceedings in\r\nconnection with the bill, but that they would leave it to the majority of\r\nthe House of Lords to take such steps as it might think proper; (2) To go\r\nthrough the whole of the amendments of the bill [_i.e._ in the House of\r\nLords], and then if they were adversely carried to declare and proceed as\r\nabove; (3) To go through not the whole of the amendments but the endowment\r\namendments, and to conclude that when these had been adversely decided,\r\nthey could (as before) assume no further responsibility, but must leave\r\nthe matter to the majority to consider; (4) To send the bill back to the\r\nHouse of Commons with the declaration that it would not be accepted there,\r\nand with the intention of simply moving the House to adhere to its\r\namendments as last adjusted.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty has already been apprized by Mr. Gladstone’s telegram in\r\ncipher of this afternoon, that (under the influence of a strong desire to\r\nexhibit patience, and to leave open every opportunity for\r\nreconsideration), the third of these courses had been adopted; although\r\nthere was no doubt that the House of Commons was fully prepared to approve\r\nand sustain the first. Lord Granville deemed it just possible that the\r\npeers might be prepared to give way before another return of the bill from\r\nthe House of Commons; and the question therefore was left open whether, if\r\nevidence to this effect should appear, the government should then fall in\r\nwith that course of proceeding. Although the government have felt it to be\r\nimpossible to make biddings in the face of the opposition, the Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury has been apprised, in strict confidence, of the nature and\r\nextent of the concession, which for the sake of peace they would be\r\nprepared to recommend. Sir R. Palmer is also substantially aware of it,\r\nand has expressed his opinion that on such terms the opposition ought to\r\nbe ready to conclude the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard And Voluntary Schools\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __310_\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gladstone to M. Bright_\r\n\r\n_Aug. 21, 1873._—An appeal to me was made to introduce board schools into\r\nHawarden on account of my share in the Education Act. I stated the two\r\nviews held by different supporters of the Act, respectively on the\r\nquestion of board schools and voluntary schools. For myself, I said, not\r\nin education only but _in all things including education, I prefer\r\nvoluntary to legal machinery, when the thing can be well done either way_.\r\nBut this question is not to be decided by a general preference or a\r\ngeneral formula. Parliament has referred it to the choice of the local\r\ncommunities. They should decide according to the facts of the case before\r\nthem. What are the facts in Hawarden? Four-fifths are already provided\r\nfor; were it only one-fifth or were it two-fifths the case for the board\r\n(I said) would be overwhelming. But besides the four-fifths, arrangements\r\nare already made for a further provision in a voluntary school. Nothing\r\nremains to be done except to build three _infant_ schools. The voluntary\r\nschools will be governed by a committee, including the churchwardens, and\r\nhaving a majority of laymen. The machinery of a board is of necessity\r\ncumbrous, and the method costly in comparison. I hold that we ought not to\r\nset up this machinery, in order to create three infant schools, where all\r\nthe other wants of some 2000 people are already provided for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nViews On A Classical Education\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __312_\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gladstone to Lord Lyttelton_\r\n\r\n_Penmaenmawr, Aug. 29, 1861._—-Thanks for the brief notice which you\r\nrecently took of the Public Schools Commission. I was heartily glad to\r\nhear that you had formed a drastic set of questions. I take the deepest\r\ninterest in the object of the commission, and I have full confidence in\r\nits members and organs; and at all times I shall be very glad to hear what\r\nyou are doing. Meantime I cannot help giving you, to be taken for what it\r\nis worth, the sum of my own thoughts upon the subject.... The _low_\r\nutilitarian argument in matter of education, for giving it what is termed\r\na practical direction, is so plausible that I think we may on the whole be\r\nthankful that the instincts of the country have resisted what in argument\r\nit has been ill able to confute. We still hold by the classical training\r\nas the basis of a liberal education; parents dispose of their children in\r\nearly youth accordingly; but if they were asked why they did so, it is\r\nprobable they would give lamentably weak or unworthy reasons for it, such\r\nfor example as that the public schools and universities open the way to\r\ndesirable acquaintance and what is termed “good society.” Your commission\r\nwill not I presume be able to pass by this question, but will have to look\r\nit in the face; and to proceed either upon a distinct affirmative, or a\r\nsubstantial negative, of the proposition that the classical training is\r\nthe proper basis of a liberal education. I hope you will hold by\r\naffirmation and reject negation.\r\n\r\nBut the reason why I trouble you upon the subject is this, that I think\r\nthe friends of this principle have usually rather blinked the discussion,\r\nand have been content with making terms of compromise by way of buying off\r\nthe adversary, which might be in themselves reasonable unless they were\r\ntaken as mere instalments of a transaction intended in the long run to\r\nswallow up the principle itself. What I feel is that the relation of pure\r\nscience, natural science, modern languages, modern history, and the rest\r\nof the old classical training ought to be founded on a principle and ought\r\nnot to be treated simply as importunate creditors, that take a shilling in\r\nthe £ to-day, because they hope to get another shilling to-morrow, and in\r\nthe meantime have a recognition of their title. This recognition of title\r\nis just what I would refuse. I deny their right to a parallel or equal\r\nposition; their true position is auxiliary, and as auxiliary it ought to\r\nbe limited and restrained without scruple, as a regard to the paramount\r\nmatter of education may dictate.\r\n\r\nBut why after all is the classical training paramount? Is it because we\r\nfind it established? because it improves memory or taste, or gives\r\nprecision, or develops the faculty of speech? All these are but partial\r\nand fragmentary statements, so many narrow glimpses of a great and\r\ncomprehensive truth. That truth I take to be that the modern European\r\ncivilisation from the middle age downwards is the compound of two great\r\nfactors, the Christian religion for the spirit of man, and the Greek, and\r\nin a secondary degree the Roman discipline for his mind and intellect. St.\r\nPaul is the apostle of the Gentiles, and is in his own person a symbol of\r\nthis great wedding—the place, for example, of Aristotle and Plato in\r\nChristian education is not arbitrary nor in principle mutable. The\r\nmaterials of what we call classical training were prepared, and we have a\r\nright to say were advisedly prepared, in order that it might become not a\r\nmere adjunct but (in mathematical phrase) the complement of Christianity\r\nin its application to the culture of the human being formed both for this\r\nworld and for the world to come.\r\n\r\nIf this principle be true it is broad and high and clear enough, and\r\nsupplies a key to all questions connected with the relation between the\r\nclassical training of our youth and all other branches of their secular\r\neducation. It must of course be kept within its proper place, and duly\r\nlimited as to things and persons. It can only apply in full to that small\r\nproportion of the youth of any country, who are to become in the fullest\r\nsense educated men. It involves no extravagant or inconvenient assumptions\r\nrespecting those who are to be educated for trades and professions in\r\nwhich the necessities of specific training must limit general culture. It\r\nleaves open every question turning upon individual aptitudes and\r\ninaptitudes and by no means requires that boys without a capacity for\r\nimbibing any of the spirit of classical culture are still to be\r\nmechanically plied with the instruments of it after their unfitness has\r\nbecome manifest. But it lays down the rule of education for those who have\r\nno internal and no external disqualification; and that rule, becoming a\r\nfixed and central point in the system, becomes also the point around which\r\nall others may be grouped.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gladstone to Sir S. Northcote_\r\n\r\n_Nov. 12, 1861._—The letter I wrote to Lyttelton about the classical\r\neducation suggested topics, which as you justly perceive are altogether\r\nesoteric. They have never to my knowledge been carefully worked out, and I\r\nthink they well deserve it; but clearly your report is not the place. I\r\nwill not say you are not prudent in suggesting that you should not even\r\ngive an opinion upon the great question: What is the true place of the old\r\nclassical learning in the human culture of the nineteenth century? I am\r\nfar from venturing to say the contrary. But one thing I do think, namely,\r\nthat it is desirable that, as far as may be, the members of the commission\r\nshould have some answer to that question in their minds, and should write\r\ntheir report with reference to it. For centuries, through the lifetime of\r\nour great schools this classical culture has been made the _lapis\r\nangularis_ of all secular culture of the highest class. Was this right or\r\nwas it wrong, aye or no? I think it much to be desired that the commission\r\nshould, if they will, proceed upon the affirmative or negative of that\r\nproposition, and should also make their choice for the former. This would\r\nbe a long note to their report; but it need not be distinctly and\r\nseparately heard in it. Such is my notion. As to particulars I have little\r\nto say that is worth hearing; but I think these three things. First, that\r\nwe give much too little scope for deviation from what I think the normal\r\nstandard to other and useful branches, when it has become evident that the\r\nnormal standard is inapplicable; just as was the case in Oxford before the\r\nreform of the examinations, or let me rather say the new statutes.\r\nSecondly, I am extremely jealous of any invasion of modern languages which\r\nis to displace classical culture, or any portion of it in minds capable of\r\nfollowing that walk. (I take it that among the usual modern tongues\r\nItalian has by far the greatest capacity for strict study and scholarship;\r\nwhereas it is the one least in favour and the whole method of dealing with\r\nthem is quite alien to strict study.) Lastly, I confess I grieve over the\r\nignorance of natural history which I feel in myself and believe to exist\r\nin others. At some time, in some way, much more of all this ought to be\r\nbrought in, but clearly it would serve in a great degree as recreation,\r\nand need not thrust aside whatever hard work boys are capable of doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPosition Of The Commander-In-Chief In Parliament\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __362_\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gladstone to the Queen_\r\n\r\n_July 8, 1871._—Mr. Gladstone believes that according to precedent the\r\ncommander-in-chief, when a peer, has not shrunk from giving his opinion on\r\nmeasures submitted to the House of Lords. In 1847, the government of that\r\nday introduced the Short Service bill, of which on the merits it is\r\nbelieved that the Duke of Wellington, then commander-in-chief, did not\r\napprove. Indeed he expressed in debate on April 26th, 1847, his doubts\r\nwhether the measure would produce the advantages which were anticipated\r\nfrom it; nevertheless, while having no political connection with the\r\ngovernment, he spoke and voted in a division for the bill. It is probable,\r\nas the numbers were only 108 to 94, that his speech and vote alone carried\r\nthe bill. Your Majesty will not fail to bear in mind that until 1855,\r\nthere was always a very high military authority who was in political\r\nconnection with the government, namely, the master of the ordnance.\r\nIndeed, unless Mr. Gladstone’s recollection deceives him, Lord Beresford\r\nwas required by the Duke of Wellington in 1829, as master of the ordnance,\r\nto support the Roman Catholic Relief bill. And it is still regretted by\r\nmany that ministries have not since comprehended any such officer. All\r\nquestion, however, as to the political support of a ministry by the\r\nmilitary chiefs of the army is now at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Soldier At The War Office\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __363_\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gladstone to Mr. Cardwell_\r\n\r\n_Jan. 5, 1871._—It was a great advantage before 1854, that there was\r\nalways a considerable soldier either in the cabinet or at least at the\r\nhead of an important military department, and politically associated with\r\nthe government. This we lost by the crude and ill-advised reconstructions\r\nof ’55. But you, following in this point a wise initiative of your\r\npredecessor, have endeavoured to bring the appointment of Sir H. Storks\r\ninto a position which makes it probably the best substitute for the former\r\nplan that can be had at present. The demand that a soldier shall be\r\nappointed at the present time would hold good _a fortiori_ for all periods\r\nof greater emergency. I know not where that principle has been admitted in\r\nour military administration. If we have committed gross errors, it has\r\nbeen owing to an excess much more than to a defect of professional\r\ninfluence and counsel. In my opinion the qualities of a good administrator\r\nand statesman go to make a good war minister, especially at this juncture,\r\nfar more than those of a good soldier. Show me the soldier who has those\r\nequally with you, and then let him take your place as S.S. But not till\r\nthen. You were chosen for your office, not because you would do tolerably\r\nfor easy times, and then could walk out, but because you were the best man\r\nthe party could supply for the post. The reproaches aimed at you now are\r\nmerely aimed at the government through you, and you are chosen to be the\r\npoint of attack because the nation is sore on military matters in times of\r\ncrisis, and the press which ought to check excitement, by most of its\r\ninstruments ministers to its increase. You find yourself unable to suggest\r\na successor; and I have seen no plan that would not weaken the government\r\ninstead of strengthening it. You see what eulogies have been passed on\r\nBright, now he is gone. You would rise in the market with many after\r\nresigning, to depreciate those who remain behind; but as I have said, you\r\nwould not be allowed to have had a legitimate cause of going, and as far\r\nas my observation goes, retirements are quite as critically judged as\r\nacceptances of office, perhaps more so. What is really to be desired, is\r\nthat we should get Storks into parliament if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone’s Financial Legacy, 1869\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __372_\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gladstone to Mr. Lowe_\r\n\r\n_Hawarden, Jan. 9, 1869._—I have referred to my list of remnants; and I\r\nwill begin with those that I tried in parliament and failed in: 1.\r\nCollection of taxes by Queen’s officers instead of local officers. 2.\r\nTaxation of charities. 3. Bill for restraining, with a view to ultimately\r\nabolishing, the circulation of the notes of private banks. 4. Plan for\r\nbringing the chancery and other judicial accounts under the control of\r\nparliament. Here I had a commission (on chancery accounts) but did not\r\ndare to go farther.\r\n\r\nThe following are subjects which I was not able to take in hand:—\r\n\r\n1. Abolition of the remaining duty upon corn; an exceeding strong case. 2.\r\nI should be much disposed to abolish the tea licences as greatly\r\nrestrictive of the consumption of a dutiable and useful commodity. I\r\nmodified them; but am not sure that this was enough. The B.I.R. could\r\nthrow light on this subject. 3. The probate duty calls, I fear, loudly for\r\nchange; but I wanted either time or courage to take it in hand. 4. The\r\nremaining conveyance duties, apart from railways, I always considered as\r\nmarked for extinction. On this subject Mr. Ayrton has rather decided\r\nantecedents. 5. The fire insurance duty is sure to be further assailed.\r\nThough not as bad (relatively to other taxes) as is supposed, it is bad\r\nenough to be very hard to defend in an adverse House; and this is one of\r\nthe questions on which it is not likely that the opposition will help to\r\nsee fair play. The promises that liberal reduction will lead to recovery\r\nof anything like the old or previous revenue have always been confidently\r\npressed by irresponsible men, and are in my opinion illusory. The tax is a\r\ntax on property: and, as we have too few of these rather than too many,\r\nwhat would seem desirable is to commute it; leaving no more than a penny\r\nstamp on the policy. This might perhaps be done, if it were made part of a\r\nlarge budget. 6. The income-tax at 6d., I suppose, presents a forward\r\nclaim. 7. The commutation of malt duty for beer duty must always, I\r\npresume, be spoken of with respect; but the working objections to it have\r\nthus far been found too hard to deal with.\r\n\r\nThere is always room in detail for amendments of stamp duties, but the\r\ngreat case as among them is the probate. They are of a class which,\r\nwithout any legal knowledge, I found very hard to work through the House\r\nof Commons. I do not look upon the Act of 1844 as the _end_ of legislation\r\nin currency; but this subject is a big one. Scotch and Irish notes would\r\nbe hard to deal with until the English case is disposed of. I forget\r\nwhether we have abolished the last of the restrictions on newspapers. If\r\nnot, they deserve to be taken in hand, according to me. I have always\r\nwished to equalise the outgoings of the exchequer as much as possible over\r\nthe several weeks of the year. Few incomes admit of this advantage in the\r\nsame degree as the public income. It would make our “account” much more\r\nvaluable to our bankers; therefore to us.\r\n\r\nThese, I think, were the main matters which lay more or less in\r\nperspective before me. I must add that I am strongly in favour of paying\r\noff the national debt, not only by annual surpluses, but by terminable\r\nannuities _sold to the national debt commissioners for securities held by\r\nthem against deposit monies_. The opponents of this plan were Mr. Hubbard\r\nand Mr. Laing. I am satisfied that neither of them had taken the trouble,\r\nand it requires some trouble, to understand it. I admit them to be no mean\r\nauthorities. Terminable annuities sold to others than yourself are quite\r\nanother matter. I got into the law some power of this kind over post\r\noffice savings bank monies to be exercised by the chancellor of the\r\nexchequer from time to time.\r\n\r\nThis is all I need trouble you with, and I have endeavoured to keep clear\r\nof all idiosyncratic propositions as much as in me lies. Of course such a\r\nletter calls for no answer. As this legacy opinion to you takes the form\r\nof a donation _inter vivos_ it will, I hope, escape duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrince Albert, 1854\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __426_\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone wrote an elaborate article in the _Morning Chronicle_ (Jan.\r\n16, 1854) warmly defending the court against attacks that had clouded the\r\npopularity of the Prince Consort. They came to little more than that the\r\nPrince attended meetings of the privy council; that he was present when\r\nthe Queen gave an audience to a minister; that he thwarted ministerial\r\ncounsels and gave them an un-English character; that in corresponding with\r\nrelatives abroad he used English influence apart from the Queen’s\r\nadvisers. Mr. Gladstone had no great difficulty in showing how little this\r\nwas worth, either as fact supported by evidence, or as principle supported\r\nby the fitness of things; and he put himself on the right ground. “We do\r\nnot raise the question whether, if the minister thinks it right to\r\ncommunicate with the sovereign alone, he is not entitled to a private\r\naudience. But we unhesitatingly assert that if the Prince is present when\r\nthe Queen confers with her advisers, and if his presence is found to be\r\ndisadvantageous to the public interests, we are not left without a remedy;\r\nfor the minister is as distinctly responsible for those interests in this\r\nas in any other matter, and he is bound on his responsibility to\r\nparliament, to decline compliance even with a personal wish of the\r\nsovereign when he believes that his assent would be injurious to the\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParliamentary Crises\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __451_\r\n\r\n_Extract from Mr. Gladstone’s letter to the Queen, March 15, 1873_\r\n\r\nThere have been within that period [1830-1873] twelve of what may be\r\nproperly called parliamentary crises involving the question of a change of\r\ngovernment. In nine of the twelve cases (viz., those of 1830, 1835, 1841,\r\n1846, 1852, 1858, 1859, 1866, and 1868), the party which had been in\r\nopposition was ready to take, and did take, office. In the other three it\r\nfailed to do this (viz., in 1832, 1851, 1855), and the old ministry or a\r\nmodification of it returned to power. But in each of these three cases the\r\nattempt of the opposition to form a government was not relinquished until\r\nafter such efforts had been made by its leaders to carry the conviction to\r\nthe world that all its available means of action were exhausted; and there\r\nis no instance on record during the whole period (or indeed so far as Mr.\r\nGladstone remembers at an earlier date) in which a summary refusal given\r\non the instant by the leader was tendered as sufficient to release the\r\nopposition from the obligations it had incurred. This is the more\r\nremarkable because in two of the three instances the opposition had not,\r\nin the same mode or degree as on Wednesday morning last, contributed by\r\nconcerted action to bring about the crisis. On the 7th of May 1832 the\r\nopposition of the day carried in the House of Lords a motion which went\r\nonly to alter the order of the opening (and doubtless very important)\r\nclauses of the Reform bill, but which the government of Lord Grey deemed\r\nfatal to the integrity of the measure. Their resignation was announced,\r\nand Lord Lyndhurst was summoned to advise King William iv. on the 9th of\r\nMay. On the 12th the Duke of Wellington was called to take a share in the\r\nproceedings, the details of which are matters of history. It was only on\r\nthe 15th that the Duke and Lord Lyndhurst found their resources at an end,\r\nwhen Lord Grey was again sent for, and on the 17th the Duke announced in\r\nthe House of Lords his abandonment of the task he had strenuously\r\nendeavoured to fulfil. On the 20th February 1851 the government of Lord\r\nRussell was defeated in the House of Commons on Mr. Locke King’s bill for\r\nthe enlargement of the county franchise by a majority composed of its own\r\nsupporters. Lord Derby, then Lord Stanley, being sent for by your Majesty\r\non the 22nd, observed that there were at the time three parties in the\r\nHouse of Commons and that the ministry had never yet been defeated by his\r\npolitical friends. He therefore counselled your Majesty to ascertain\r\nwhether the government of Lord Russell could not be strengthened by a\r\npartial reconstruction, and failing that measure he engaged to use his own\r\nbest efforts to form an administration. That attempt at reconstruction (to\r\nwhich nothing similar is now in question) did fail, and Lord Derby was\r\ntherefore summoned by your Majesty on the 25th, and at once applied\r\nhimself, as is well known, to every measure which seemed to give him a\r\nhope of success in constructing a government. On the 27th he apprised your\r\nMajesty of his failure in these efforts; and on March 3rd the cabinet of\r\nLord Russell returned to office. (This recital is founded on Lord Derby’s\r\nstatement in the House of Lords, Feb. 28, 1851.) On Jan. 29, 1855, the\r\ngovernment of Lord Aberdeen was defeated in the House of Commons on a\r\nmotion made by an independent member of their own party and supported by\r\ntwenty-five of the liberal members present. Though this defeat resembles\r\nthe one last named in that it cannot be said to be due to the concerted\r\naction of the opposition as a party, Lord Derby, being summoned by your\r\nMajesty on the 1st of Feb. proceeded to examine and ascertain in every\r\nquarter the means likely to be at his disposal for rendering assistance in\r\nthe exigency, and it was not until Feb. 3 that he receded from his\r\nendeavours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCabinet Of 1880-1885\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page __630_\r\n\r\n_First lord of the treasury, chancellor of the exchequer_,      W.

In 1860 Mr. Gladstone removed the duties from 371\r\n      articles, reducing the number to 48, of which only 15 were of\r\n      importance—spirits, sugar, tea, tobacco, wine, coffee, corn,\r\n      currants, timber, chicory, figs, hops, pepper, raisins, and rice.\r\n\r\n   18 See an interesting letter to Sir W.

Lord Palmerston’s words to the Queen\r\n      about Mr. Gladstone are a curiously unedifying specimen of loyalty\r\n      to a colleague.\r\n\r\n   31 “It appears that he wrote his final opinion on the subject to the\r\n      cabinet on Saturday, left them to deliberate, and went to the\r\n      Crystal Palace. The Duke of Argyll joined him there and said it was\r\n      all right. The Gladstones then went to Cliveden and he purposely did\r\n      not return till late, twelve o’clock on Monday night, in order that\r\n      Palmerston might make his speech as he pleased. I doubt the policy\r\n      of his absence. It of course excited much remark, and does not in\r\n      any way protect Gladstone. M. Gibson was also absent.”—_Phillimore\r\n      Diary_, July 23. In his diary Mr. Gladstone records: “_July\r\n      21._—Cabinet 3 ½-5 1/4. I left it that the discussion might be free\r\n      and went to Stafford House and Sydenham.

One of the winding-paths leading through some\r\n      of the most beautiful spots of the park at Hawarden was made at this\r\n      time by factory workers from Lancashire employed by Mr. Gladstone\r\n      for purposes of relief.\r\n\r\n   55 Walpole’s _Life of Russell_, ii. p. 361.\r\n\r\n  M27 On The Tyne\r\n\r\n   56 In a jingle composed for the occasion, the refrain is—\r\n\r\n      “Honour give to sterling worth,\r\n      Genius better is than birth,\r\n      So here’s success to Gladstone.”\r\n\r\n      In thanking a Newcastle correspondent for his reception, Mr.\r\n      Gladstone writes (Oct. 20, 1862): “To treat these occurrences as\r\n      matter of personal obligation to those who have taken a part in them\r\n      would be to mistake the ground on which they rest. But I must say\r\n      with unfeigned sincerity that I can now perceive I have been\r\n      appropriating no small share of honour that is really due to the\r\n      labour of others: of Mr. Cobden as to the French treaty, and of the\r\n      distinguished men who have in our day by their upright and\r\n      enlightened public conduct made law and government names so dear to\r\n      the people of England.” “Indeed,” says a contemporary journalist,\r\n      “if Middlesborough did not do honour to Mr. Gladstone, we don’t know\r\n      who should, for the French treaty has been a greater boon to the\r\n      iron manufacturers of that young but rising seaport, than to any\r\n      other class of commercial men in the north of England.”—_Newcastle\r\n      Daily Chronicle_, Oct. 11, 1862.\r\n\r\n_   57 Letters on England_, pp. 146-78.\r\n\r\n   58 Adams wrote in his diary: “_Oct. 8._ If Gladstone be any exponent at\r\n      all of the views of the cabinet, then is my term likely to be very\r\n      short. The animus, as it respects Mr. Davis and the recognition of\r\n      the rebel cause, is very apparent. Oct. 9:—We are now passing\r\n      through the very crisis of our fate.

He alone can put a stop to all these\r\n      mischievous reports.... He ought to say that no government, English\r\n      or foreign, has to do with his departure, and that he goes solely\r\n      because the state of his health does not permit him to fulfil his\r\n      engagements.”\r\n\r\n   84 The story has been told from the radical point of view by Sir James\r\n      Stansfeld in _Review of Reviews_, June 1895, p. 512. Another account\r\n      by Mr. Seely, M.P., was furnished to the _Times_ (April 21, 1864).\r\n      Lord Shaftesbury, who was a staunch Garibaldian, presumably on high\r\n      protestant grounds, also wrote to the _Times_ (April 24): “The\r\n      solid, persevering and hearty attachment of Mr. Gladstone to the\r\n      cause of Italy and General Garibaldi is as notorious as it is\r\n      generous and true, and I declare in the most solemn manner and on\r\n      the word of a gentleman, my firm belief that we were all of us\r\n      animated by the same ardent desire (without reference to anything\r\n      and anybody but the General himself) to urge that and that only,\r\n      which was indispensable to his personal welfare. It was, I assert,\r\n      the General’s own and unsuggested decision to give up the provincial\r\n      journey altogether.”\r\n\r\n   85 Fagan’s _Panizzi_, ii. p. 252.

Wellington put him into his cabinet (1828); he had been with\r\n      him in the Peninsula.” On returning to London, I found that Murray\r\n      had been five years in parliament, and having written to tell Mr.\r\n      Gladstone so, the next day I received a summary postcard—“Then try\r\n      Lord Henry Petty.” Here, as far as I make out, he was right.\r\n\r\n      “It is very unusual, I think,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to the prime\r\n      minister (Jan. 6, 1866) “to put men into the cabinet without a\r\n      previous official training.

The main burden of\r\n      national education fell on the shoulders of 200,000 persons whose\r\n      voluntary subscriptions supported the schools. “In other words, the\r\n      efforts of a handful out of the whole nation had accomplished the\r\n      fairly efficient education of about one-third of the children, and\r\n      had provided schools for about one-half; but the rest either went to\r\n      inefficient schools, or to no school at all, and for them there was\r\n      no room even had the power to compel their attendance existed.”—See\r\n      Sir Henry Craik’s _The State in its Relation to Education_, pp. 84,\r\n      85.\r\n\r\n  M94 A Crucial Decision\r\n  M95 Anger Of Nonconformists\r\n\r\n_  192 Life of Dale_, p. 295.\r\n\r\n_  193 Life of Forster_, i. p. 497.\r\n\r\n  M96 Effects Of Party\r\n  M97 Bright’s Return To Government\r\n\r\n  194 For the rest of the letter see Appendix.\r\n\r\n  M98 Endowed Schools\r\n\r\n  195 See Appendix.\r\n\r\n  196 In 1874 the conservative government brought in a bill restoring to\r\n      the church of England numerous schools in cases where the founder\r\n      had recognised the authority of a bishop, or had directed attendance\r\n      in the service of that church, or had required that the masters\r\n      should be in holy orders.

I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither\r\n      right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind _à tout\r\n      jamais_. Naturally I told him I had as yet received no news, and as\r\n      he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid he could clearly see\r\n      that my government once more had no hand in the matter.’ His Majesty\r\n      has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told\r\n      Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has\r\n      decided, with reference to the above demand, upon the representation\r\n      of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again,\r\n      but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp: That his\r\n      Majesty has now received from the Prince confirmation of the news\r\n      which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing\r\n      further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your\r\n      excellency whether Benedetti’s fresh demand and its rejection should\r\n      not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the\r\n      press.” (ii. p. 96.)\r\n\r\n  212 See Sorel, _Hist. diplomatique de la guerre franco-allemande_\r\n      (1875), i. pp. 169-71.\r\n\r\n M107 France Declares War\r\n\r\n  213 In the Reichstag, on July 20, Bismarck reproached the French\r\n      ministers for not yielding to the pressure of the members of the\r\n      opposition like Thiers and Gambetta, and producing the document,\r\n      which would have overthrown the base on which the declaration of war\r\n      was founded.

It means this, that in the event of a violation of\r\n      neutrality, all the powers who have signed the treaty may be called\r\n      upon for their collective action. No one of those powers is liable\r\n      to be called upon to act singly or separately. It is a case so to\r\n      speak of “limited liability.” We are bound in honour—you cannot put\r\n      a legal construction upon it—to see in concert with others that\r\n      these arrangements are maintained. But if the other powers join with\r\n      us, it is certain that there will be no violation of neutrality. If\r\n      they, situated exactly as we are, decline to join, we are not bound\r\n      single-handed to make up the deficiencies of the rest.\r\n\r\n  232 The number of men was reduced from 49,000 in 1868 to 20,941 in 1870;\r\n      at the same time the military expenditure on the colonies was\r\n      reduced from £3,388,023 to £1,905,538.\r\n\r\n_  233 Reign of Queen Victoria_, edited by T.

At an\r\n      inaugural dinner of what was then called the Colonial Society (March\r\n      10, 1869), Mr. Johnson, then American minister, made some\r\n      semi-facetious remarks about colonies finding themselves transferred\r\n      from the union jack to the stars and stripes. Lord Granville said he\r\n      was rather afraid that the minister of the great republic, who had\r\n      spoken with such singular eloquence, would feel it was a little want\r\n      of sense on his part, that made him unprepared at that moment to\r\n      open negotiations for the cession of British Canada.

Peel\r\n      parliamentary secretaries to the treasury; Lord F. Cavendish and Mr.\r\n      A. Greville were appointed lords of the treasury. On Sir John\r\n      Coleridge being appointed lord chief justice, and Sir George Jessel\r\n      master of the rolls, they were succeeded by Mr. Henry James as\r\n      attorney-general and Mr. Vernon Harcourt as solicitor-general. “We\r\n      have effectually extracted the brains from below the gangway,” Lord\r\n      Aberdare wrote, Nov. 19, 1873, “Playfair, Harcourt, James, and Lord\r\n      Edmond Fitzmaurice, who is Lowe’s private secretary, being gone,\r\n      will leave Fawcett all alone, for Trevelyan does not share his\r\n      ill-will towards the government.”\r\n\r\n  294 30 and 31 Vict., cap. 102, sec. 52, and schedule H.\r\n\r\n  295 Sir Spencer Walpole thinks that Perceval’s case (_Life of Perceval_,\r\n      ii. P. 55) covered Mr. Gladstone. In its constitutional aspect this\r\n      is true, but the Act of 1867 introduced technical difficulties that\r\n      made a new element.\r\n\r\n M151 The Greenwich Seat\r\n\r\n  296 Yet Lord Selborne says that Coleridge ’must have been\r\n      misunderstood’!—_Memorials_, i. pp. 328-9.\r\n\r\n  297 21 and 22 Vict., c. 110 (1858).\r\n\r\n  298 Mr. Childers (_Life_, i. p. 220) writing after the election in 1874,\r\n      says, “It is clear to me that he would not have dissolved but for\r\n      the question about the double office.” In the sentence before he\r\n      says, “Some day perhaps Gladstone will recognise his mistake in\r\n      August.” This mistake, it appears, was going to the exchequer\r\n      himself, instead of placing Mr. Childers there (p. 219). I am sure\r\n      that this able and excellent man thought what he said about “the\r\n      question of the double office,” but his surmise was not quite\r\n      impartial. Nor was he at the time a member of the cabinet.\r\n\r\n_  299 Memoir of Hope-Scott_ ii. p. 284.\r\n\r\n M152 The Bath Election\r\n\r\n  300 To Lord Grey de Wilton, Oct. 3, 1873.\r\n\r\n  301 In 1871-73 the tories gained twenty-three seats against only one\r\n      gained by the liberals; in the first three years of the government\r\n      nine seats had been lost and nine gained.\r\n\r\n      “Individuals may recover from even serious sickness; it does not\r\n      appear to be the way with governments.”—Mr. Gladstone, _Nineteenth\r\n      Century_, Sept. 1887.\r\n\r\n M153 Actual Occasion For Dissolution\r\n\r\n  302 Dec. 2, 1873.\r\n\r\n  303 The conservatives had gained a seat at Stroud on Jan. 6, and greatly\r\n      reduced the liberal majority at Newcastle-on-Tyne.\r\n\r\n  304 “The continual loss of elections,” Lord Aberdare wrote to his wife,\r\n      “and the expediency of avoiding being further weakened in detail,\r\n      have determined us to take at once the opinion of the country, and\r\n      to stand or fall by it. I am rejoiced at this resolution.”—_Aberdare\r\n      Papers_, Jan. 23, 1874.\r\n\r\n M154 Electoral Manifesto\r\n\r\n  305 It was an extraordinary feat for a Statesman of sixty-five who had\r\n      quite recently been confined to his bed with bronchitis. The day was\r\n      damp and drizzly; numbers, which are variously estimated from six to\r\n      seven thousand, had to be as far as possible brought within the\r\n      range of his voice, and his only platform was a cart with some sort\r\n      of covering, in the front of which he had to stand\r\n      bareheaded.—_Spectator_, Jan. 31, 1874.\r\n\r\n M155 The General Election\r\n\r\n  306 Mr. Gladstone on Electoral Pacts, _Nineteenth Century_, November\r\n      1878.\r\n\r\n M156 To Meet Parliament Or Resign\r\n\r\n  307 February 17, 1874.—“I was with the Queen to-day at Windsor for\r\n      three-quarters of an hour, and nothing could be more frank, natural,\r\n      and kind, than her manner throughout. In conversation at the\r\n      audience, I of course followed the line on which we agreed last\r\n      night. She assented freely to all the honours I had proposed. There\r\n      was therefore no impediment whatever to the immediate and plenary\r\n      execution of my commission from the cabinet; and I at once tendered\r\n      our resignations, which I understand to have been graciously\r\n      accepted. She left me, I have no doubt, to set about making other\r\n      arrangements.”\r\n\r\n M157 Explanations Of Defeat\r\n\r\n  308 March 19, 1874.\r\n\r\n_  309 Aberdare Papers._\r\n\r\n M158 Reasons For Withdrawal\r\n\r\n  310 See vol. i. p. 337.\r\n\r\n M159 Ecclesiastical Debate\r\n M160 Bright And Other Colleagues\r\n\r\n_  311 Blachford’s Letters_, p. 362.\r\n\r\n_  312 Herod._ vii. 157.\r\n\r\n_  313 Congregationalist_, Feb. 1875, p. 66.\r\n\r\n  314 See Cecconi’s _Storia del Conc.

Mr. Gladstone declined the\r\n      reception as inconsistent with his intention, expressed at\r\n      Edinburgh, to avoid all demonstration, and also because it would be\r\n      regarded as an attempt made for the first time to establish a\r\n      practice of public rejoicing in the metropolis over the catastrophe\r\n      of an administration and a political party, and would wound feelings\r\n      which ought to be respected as well as spared.\r\n\r\n  370 See an interesting letter from Viscount Esher, _Times_, Feb. 22,\r\n      1892.\r\n\r\n  371 “Without their full acquiescence—and indeed their earnest\r\n      pressure—he could not even now take a step which would seem to\r\n      slight claims which he has amply and generously acknowledged.... If\r\n      either now or a few days later he accepts the task of forming and\r\n      the duty of presiding over a liberal administration, it will be\r\n      because Lord Granville and Lord Hartington, with characteristic\r\n      patriotism, have themselves been among the first to feel and the\r\n      most eager to urge Mr. Gladstone’s return to the post to which he\r\n      has been summoned.”—_Daily News_, April 22.\r\n\r\n  372 Up to this point the memorandum is on Windsor notepaper, and must\r\n      have been written between the end of the audience and the time for\r\n      the train—a very characteristic instance of his alacrity.\r\n\r\n M200 Construction Of Cabinet\r\n\r\n  373 The reader will find the list of the members of the cabinet, now and\r\n      at later periods of its existence, in the Appendix.",
