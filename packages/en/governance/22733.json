Some slight revision was necessary to correct\r\none or two errors which crept unavoidably into the earlier edition. By\r\nan oversight, an important typographical blunder went uncorrected into\r\nthe former edition, making the date of the first use of the word\r\n\"Socialism\" 1835 instead of 1833. That error, I regret to say, has been\r\nsubsequently copied into many important publications. Even more\r\nimportant were some errors in the biographical sketch of Marx, in\r\nChapter III. These were not due to any carelessness upon the part of the\r\npresent writer, but were reproduced from standard works, upon what\r\nseemed to be good authority--that of his youngest daughter and his\r\nintimate friend, the late Wilhelm Liebknecht. It is now known with\r\ncertainty that the father of Karl Marx embraced Christianity of his own\r\nfree choice, and not in obedience to an official edict.\r\n\r\nThese and some other minor changes having to be made, I took the time to\r\nrewrite large parts of the volume, making such substantial changes in\r\nit as to constitute practically a new book. The chapter on Robert Owen\r\nhas been recast and greater emphasis placed upon his American career and\r\nits influence; in Chapter IV the sketch of the Materialistic Conception\r\nof History has been enlarged somewhat, special attention being given to\r\nthe bearing of the theory upon religion. All the rest of the book has\r\nbeen changed, partly to meet the requirements of many students and\r\nothers who have written to me in reference to various points of\r\ndifficulty, and partly also to state some of my own ideas more\r\nsuccessfully. I venture to hope that the brief chapter on \"Means of\r\nRealization,\" which has been added to the book by way of postscript,\r\nwill, in spite of its brevity, and the fact that it was not written for\r\ninclusion in this volume, prove helpful to some who read the book.\r\n\r\nThe thanks of the writer are due to all those friends--Socialists and\r\nothers--whose kindly efforts made the earlier edition of the book a\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nYONKERS, N.Y.,\r\n  December, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\nPREFACE

One who is willing\r\n     To give up his penny and pocket your shilling.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was another view, brutally unjust and unkind, expressed in\r\nblood-curdling cartoons representing the Socialist as a bomb-throwing\r\nassassin. According to the one view, Socialists were all sordid, envious\r\ncreatures, yearning for the\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Equal division of unequal earnings,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nwhile the other view represented them as ready to enforce this selfish\r\ndemand by means of the cowardly weapons of the assassin.\r\n\r\nBoth these views are now, happily, well-nigh extinct. There is still a\r\ngreat deal of misconception of the meaning of Socialism; the ignorance\r\nconcerning it which is manifested upon every hand is often\r\ndisheartening, but neither of these puerile misrepresentations is\r\ncommonly encountered in serious discussion. It is true that the average\r\nnewspaper editorial confounds Socialism with Anarchism, often enlisting\r\nthe prejudice which exists against the most violent forms of Anarchism\r\nin attacking Socialism, though the two systems of thought are\r\nfundamentally opposed to each other; it is likewise true that Socialists\r\nare not infrequently asked to explain their supposed intention to have a\r\ngreat general \"dividing-up day\" for the equal distribution of all the\r\nwealth of the nation. The Chancellor of a great American university\r\nreturns from a sojourn in Norway, and naively hastens to inform the\r\nworld that he has \"refuted\" Socialism by asking the members of some\r\npoor, struggling sect of Communists what would happen to their scheme of\r\nequality if babies should be born after midnight of the day of the equal\r\ndivision of wealth!\r\n\r\nRecognizing it to be the supreme issue of the age, the Republican Party,\r\nin its national platform,[1] defines Socialism as meaning equality of\r\nownership as against equality of opportunity, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat every recognized exponent of Socialism would deny that Socialism\r\nmeans equality of ownership, or that it goes beyond equality of\r\nopportunity; that the voluminous literature of Socialism teems with\r\nunequivocal and unmistakable disavowals of any desire for the periodic\r\ndivisions of property and wealth which alone could make equality of\r\nownership possible for brief periods.\r\n\r\nStill, when all this has been said, it must be added that these\r\ncriticisms do not represent the attitude of the mass of people toward\r\nthe Socialist movement to the same extent as they once did. In serious\r\ndiscussions of the subject among thinking people it is becoming quite\r\nrare to encounter either of the two criticisms named. Most of those who\r\nseriously and honestly discuss the subject know that modern Socialism\r\ncomprehends neither assassination nor the equal division of wealth. The\r\nenormous interest manifested in Socialism during recent years and the\r\nsteady growth of the Socialist vote throughout the world bear witness to\r\nthe fact that the views expressed in the satirical distich of the poet's\r\nfancy and the blood-curdling cartoon of the artist's invention are no\r\nlonger the potent appeals to prejudice they once were.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the changed attitude of the public toward the Socialist\r\nmovement and the Socialist ideal lies in the growth of the movement\r\nitself. There are many who would change the order of this proposition\r\nand say that the growth of the Socialist movement is a result of the\r\nchanged attitude of the public mind toward it. In a sense, both views\r\nare right. Obviously, if the public mind had not revised its judgments\r\nsomewhat, we should not have attained our present strength and\r\ndevelopment; but it is equally obvious that if we had not grown, if we\r\nhad remained the small and feeble band we once were, the public mind\r\nwould not have revised its judgments much, if at all. It is easy to\r\nenlist prejudice against a small body of men and women when they have no\r\npowerful influence, and to misrepresent and vilify them.\r\n\r\nBut it is otherwise when that small body has grown into a great body\r\nwith far-reaching influence and power. So long as the Socialist movement\r\nin America consisted of a few poor workingmen in two or three of the\r\nlargest cities, most of them foreigners, it was very easy for the\r\naverage man to accept as true the wildest charges brought against them.\r\nBut when the movement grew and developed a powerful organization, with\r\nbranches in almost every city, and a well-conducted press of its own, it\r\nbecame a very different matter. The sixteen years from 1888 to 1904 saw\r\nthe Socialist vote in the United States grow steadily from 2068 in the\r\nformer year to 442,402 in the latter. Europe and America together had in\r\n1870 only about 30,000 votes, but by 1906 the number had risen to\r\nconsiderably over 7,000,000. These figures constitute a vital challenge\r\nto the thoughtful and earnest men and women of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is manifestly impossible for a great world-wide movement, numbering\r\nits adherent by millions, and having for its advocates many of the\r\nforemost thinkers, artists, and poets of the world, to be based upon\r\neither sordid selfishness or murderous hate and envy. If that were true,\r\nif it were possible for such a thing to be true, the most gloomy\r\nforebodings of the pessimist would fall far short of the real measure of\r\nHumanity's impending doom. It is estimated that no less than thirty\r\nmillion adults are at present enrolled in the ranks of the Socialists\r\nthroughout the world, and the number is constantly increasing. This vast\r\narmy, drawn from every part of the civilized world, comprising men and\r\nwomen of all races and creeds, is not motivated by hate or envy, but by\r\na consciousness that in their hands and the hands of their fellows rests\r\nthe power to win greater happiness for themselves. Incidentally, their\r\nunity for this purpose is perhaps the greatest force in the world to-day\r\nmaking for international peace.\r\n\r\nStill, notwithstanding the millions enlisted under the banner of\r\nSocialism, the word is spoken by many with the pallid lips of fear, the\r\nscowl of hate, or the amused shrug of contempt; while in the same land,\r\npeople of the same race, facing the same problems and perils, speak it\r\nwith glad voices and hopelit eyes. Many a mother crooning over her babe\r\nprays that it may be saved from the Socialism to which another, with\r\nequal mother love, looks as her child's heritage and hope. And with\r\nscholars and statesmen it is much the same. With wonderful unanimity\r\nagreeing that, in the words of Herbert Spencer, \"Socialism will come\r\ninevitably, in spite of all opposition,\" they yet differ in their\r\nestimates of its character and probable effects upon the race quite as\r\nmuch as the unlearned. One welcomes and another fears; one envies the\r\nunborn generations, another pities. To one the coming of Socialism means\r\nthe coming of Human Brotherhood, the long, long quest of Humanity's\r\nchoicest spirits; to another it means the enslavement of the world\r\nthrough fear.\r\n\r\nMany years ago Herbert Spencer wrote an article on \"The Coming Slavery,\"\r\nwhich conveyed the impression that the great thinker saw what he thought\r\nto be signs of the inevitable triumph of Socialism. All over the world\r\nSocialists were cheered by this admission from their implacable enemy.\r\nIn this connection it is worthy of note that Spencer continued to\r\nbelieve in the inevitability of Socialism. In October, 1905, a\r\nwell-known Frenchman, M. G. Davenay, visited Mr. Spencer and had a long\r\nconversation with him on several subjects, Socialism among them. Soon\r\nafter his return, he received a letter on the subject from Mr. Spencer,\r\nwritten in French, which was published in the Paris _Figaro_ a few days\r\nafter Mr. Spencer's death in December, 1905, two months or thereabouts\r\nfrom the time of the interview which called it forth.[2] After some\r\nbrief reference to his health, Mr. Spencer wrote: \"The opinions I have\r\ndelivered here before you, and which you have the liberty to publish,\r\nare briefly these: (1) Socialism will triumph inevitably, in spite of\r\nall opposition; (2) its establishment will be the greatest disaster\r\nwhich the world has ever known; (3) sooner or later, it will be brought\r\nto an end by a military despotism.\"\r\n\r\nAnything more terrible than this black pessimism which clouded the\r\nlatter part of the life of the great thinker, it would be difficult to\r\nimagine. After living his long life of splendid service to the cause of\r\nintellectual progress, and studying as few men have ever done the\r\nhistory of the race, he went down to his grave fully believing that the\r\nworld was doomed to inevitable disaster. How different from the\r\nconfidence of the poet,[3] foretelling:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"A wonderful day a-coming when all shall be better than well.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last words of the great French Utopist, Saint-Simon, were, \"The\r\nfuture is ours!\" And thousands of times his words have been echoed by\r\nthose who, believing equally with Herbert Spencer that Socialism must\r\ncome, have seen in the prospect only the fulfillment of the age-long\r\ndream of Human Brotherhood. Men as profound as Spencer, and as sincere,\r\nrejoice at the very thing which blanched his cheeks and filled his heart\r\nwith fear.\r\n\r\nThere is, then, a widespread conviction that Socialism will come and, in\r\ncoming, vitally affect for good or ill every life. Millions of earnest\r\nmen and women have enlisted themselves beneath its banner in various\r\nlands, and their number is steadily growing. In this country, as in\r\nEurope, the spread of Socialism is one of the most evident facts of the\r\nage, and its study is therefore most important. What does it mean, and\r\nwhat does it promise or threaten, are questions which civic duty\r\nprompts. The day is not far distant when ignorance of Socialism will be\r\nregarded as a disgrace, and neglect of it a civic wrong. No man can\r\nfaithfully discharge the responsibilities of his citizenship until he is\r\nable to give an answer to these questions, to meet intelligently the\r\nchallenge of Socialism to the age.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe word \"Socialism\" is admittedly one of the noblest and most inspiring\r\nwords ever born of human speech. Whatever may be thought of the\r\nprinciples for which it is the accepted name, or of the political\r\nparties which contend for those principles, no one can dispute the\r\nbeauty and moral grandeur of the word itself. I refer not merely, of\r\ncourse, to its etymology, but rather to its spiritual import. Derived\r\nfrom the Latin word, _socius_, meaning a comrade, it is, like the word\r\n\"mother,\" for instance, one of those great universal speech symbols\r\nwhich find their way into every language.\r\n\r\nSignifying as it does faith in the comradeship of man as the basis of\r\nsocial existence, prefiguring a social state in which there shall be no\r\nstrife of man against man, or nation against nation, it is a verbal\r\nexpression of a great ideal, man's loftiest aspirations crystallized\r\ninto a single word. The old Hebrew prophet's dream of a\r\nworld-righteousness that shall give peace, when nations \"shall beat\r\ntheir swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks,\"[4]\r\nand the Angel-song of Peace and Goodwill in the legend of the Nativity,\r\nmean no more than the word \"Socialism\" in its best usage means. Plato,\r\nspiritual son of the Socrates who for truth's sake drained the hemlock\r\ncup to its dregs, dreamed of such social peace and unity, and the line\r\nof those who have seen the same vision of a love-welded world has never\r\nbeen broken: More and Campanella, Saint-Simon and Owen, Marx and Engels,\r\nMorris and Bellamy--and the end of the prophetic line is not yet.\r\n\r\nBut if the dream, the hope itself, is old, the word is comparatively\r\nnew. It is hard to realize that the word which means so much to\r\ncountless millions of human beings, and which plays such a part in the\r\nvital discussions of the world, in every civilized country, is no older\r\nthan many of those whose lips speak it with reverence and hope. Yet such\r\nis the fact. Because it will help us to a clearer understanding of\r\nmodern Socialism, and because, too, it is little known, notwithstanding\r\nits intensely interesting character, let us linger awhile over that page\r\nof history which records the origin of this noble word.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, anxious to settle, if possible, the vexed question of\r\nthe origin and first use of the word \"Socialism,\" the present writer\r\ndevoted a good deal of time to an investigation of the subject, spending\r\nmuch of it in a careful survey of all the early nineteenth-century\r\nradical literature. It soon appeared that the generally accepted account\r\nof its introduction, by the French writer, L. Reybaud, in 1840, was\r\nwrong. Indeed, when once fairly started on the investigation, it seemed\r\nrather surprising that the account should have been accepted,\r\npractically without challenge, for so long. Finally the conclusion was\r\nreached that an anonymous writer in an English paper was the first to\r\nuse the word in print, the date being August 24, 1833.[5] Since that\r\ntime an investigation of a commendably thorough nature has been made by\r\nthree students of the University of Wisconsin,[6] with the result that\r\nthey have been unable to find any earlier use of the word. It is\r\nsomewhat disappointing that after thus tracing the word back to what may\r\nwell be its first appearance in print, it should be impossible to\r\nidentify its creator.\r\n\r\nThe letter in which the term is first used is signed \"A Socialist,\" and\r\nit is quite evident that the writer uses it as a synonym for the\r\ncommonly used term \"Owenite,\" by which the disciples of Robert Owen were\r\nknown. It is most probable that Owen himself had used the word, and, to\r\nsome extent, made it popular; and that the writer of the letter had\r\nheard \"our dear social father,\" as Owen was called, use it, either in\r\nsome of his speeches or in conversation. This is the more likely as Owen\r\nwas fond of inventing new words. At any rate, one of Owen's associates,\r\nnow dead, told the present writer that Owen often specifically claimed\r\nto have used the word at least ten years before it was adopted by any\r\nother writer.\r\n\r\nThe word gradually became more familiar in England. Throughout the years\r\n1835-1836, in the pages of Owen's paper, _The New Moral World_, there\r\nare many instances of the word occurring. The French writer, Reybaud, in\r\nhis \"Reformateurs Modernes,\" published in 1840, made the term equally\r\nfamiliar to the reading public of Continental Europe. By him it was\r\nused to designate the teachings not merely of Owen and his followers,\r\nbut those of all social reformers and visionaries--Saint-Simon, Charles\r\nFourier, Louis Blanc, and others. By an easy transition, it soon came\r\ninto general use as designating all altruistic visions, theories, and\r\nexperiments, from the \"Republic\" of Plato onward through the centuries.\r\n\r\nIn this way much confusion arose. The word became too vague and\r\nindefinite to be distinctive. It was applied--frequently as an\r\nepithet--indiscriminately to persons of widely differing, and often\r\nconflicting, views. Every one who complained of social inequalities,\r\nevery dreamer of social Utopias, was called a Socialist. The\r\nenthusiastic Christian, pleading for a return to the faith and practices\r\nof primitive Christianity, and the aggressive atheist, proclaiming\r\nreligion to be the bulwark of the world's wrongs; the State worshiper,\r\nwho would extol Law, and spread the net of government over the whole of\r\nlife, and the iconoclastic Anarchist, who would destroy all forms of\r\nsocial authority, have all alike been dubbed Socialists, by their\r\nfriends no less than by their opponents.\r\n\r\nThe confusion thus introduced has had the effect of seriously\r\ncomplicating the study of Socialism from the historical point of view.\r\nMuch that one finds bearing the name of Socialism in the literature of\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century, for example, is not at all\r\nrelated to Socialism as that term is understood to-day. Thus the\r\nSocialists of the present day, who do not advocate Communism, regard as\r\na classic presentation of their views the famous pamphlet by Karl Marx\r\nand Friederich Engels, _The Communist Manifesto_. They have circulated\r\nit by millions of copies in practically all the languages of the\r\ncivilized world. Yet throughout it speaks of \"Socialists\" with\r\nill-concealed disdain, and always in favor of Communism and the\r\nCommunist Party. The reason for this is clearly explained by Engels\r\nhimself in the preface written by him for the English edition, but that\r\nhas not prevented many an unscrupulous opponent of Socialism from\r\nquoting the _Communist Manifesto_ of Marx and Engels against the\r\nSocialists of the Marx-Engels school.[7] In like manner, the utterances\r\nand ideas of many of those who formerly called themselves Socialists\r\nhave been quoted against the Socialists of to-day, notwithstanding that\r\nit was precisely on account of their desire to repudiate all connection\r\nwith, and responsibility for, such ideas that the founders of the modern\r\nSocialist movement took the name \"Communists.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be clearer than the language in which Engels explains why\r\nthe name Communist was chosen, and the name Socialist discarded. He\r\nsays: \"Yet, when it (the _Manifesto_) was written, we could not have\r\ncalled it a _Socialist Manifesto_. By Socialists, in 1847, were\r\nunderstood, on the one hand, the adherents of the various Utopian\r\nsystems: Owenites in England, Fourierists in France, both of these\r\nalready reduced to the position of mere sects, and gradually dying out;\r\non the other hand, the most multifarious social quacks, who, by all\r\nmanner of tinkering, professed to redress, without any danger to capital\r\nand profit, all sorts of social grievances; in both cases men outside of\r\nthe working-class movement, and looking rather to the 'educated' classes\r\nfor support. Whatever portion of the working class had become convinced\r\nof the insufficiency of mere political revolution and had proclaimed the\r\nnecessity of a total social change, that portion, then, called itself\r\nCommunist. It was a crude, rough-hewn, purely instinctive sort of\r\nCommunism; still, it touched the cardinal point and was powerful enough\r\namong the working class to produce the Utopian Communism, in France, of\r\nCabet, and in Germany, of Weitling. Thus Socialism was, in 1847, a\r\nmiddle-class movement; Communism a working-class movement. Socialism\r\nwas, on the Continent at least, 'respectable'; Communism was the very\r\nopposite. And as our notion, from the very beginning, was that the\r\n'emancipation of the working class must be the act of the working class\r\nitself,' there could be no doubt as to which of the names we must take.\r\nMoreover, we have ever since been far from regretting it.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThere is still, unfortunately, much misuse of the word \"Socialism,\" even\r\nby some accredited Socialist exponents. Writers like Tolstoy, Ibsen,\r\nZola, and many others, are constantly referred to as Socialists, when,\r\nin fact, they are nothing of the sort. Still, the word is now pretty\r\ngenerally understood as defined by the Socialists--not the \"Socialists\"\r\nof sixty years ago, who were mostly Communists, but the Socialists of\r\nto-day, whose principles find classic expression in the _Communist\r\nManifesto_, and to the attainment of which they have directed their\r\npolitical parties and programmes. In the words of Professor Thorstein\r\nVeblen: \"The Socialism that inspires hopes and fears to-day is of the\r\nschool of Marx. No one is seriously apprehensive of any other so-called\r\nSocialistic movement, and no one is seriously concerned to criticise or\r\nrefute the doctrines set forth by any other school of 'Socialists.'\"[9]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Republican National Platform, 1908.\r\n\r\n[2] I quote the English translation from the London _Clarion_, December\r\n18, 1905.\r\n\r\n[3] William Morris.\r\n\r\n[4] Isaiah ii. 4.\r\n\r\n[5] See _Socialism and Social Democracy_, by John Spargo. _The Comrade_,\r\nVol. II, No. 6, March, 1903.\r\n\r\n[6] In _The International Socialist Review_, Vol. VI, No. 1, July, 1905.\r\n\r\n[7] As an instance of this I note the following example: \"No severer\r\ncritic of Socialists ever lived than Karl Marx.

It is impossible to understand the modern Socialist\r\nmovement, the Socialism which is rapidly becoming the dominant issue in\r\nthe thought and politics of the world, without distinguishing sharply\r\nbetween it and the Utopian visions which preceded it. Failure to make\r\nthis distinction is responsible for the complete misunderstanding of the\r\nSocialism of to-day by many earnest and intelligent persons.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that we study the Utopian movements which flourished\r\nand declined prior to the rise of scientific Socialism in detail. It\r\nwill be sufficient if we consider the Utopian Socialism of Owen, which\r\nis Utopian Socialism at its best and nearest approach to the modern\r\nmovement. Thus we shall get a clear view of the point of departure which\r\nmarked the rise of the later scientific movement with its revolutionary\r\npolitical programmes. Incidentally, also, we shall get a view of the\r\ngreat and good Robert Owen, whom Liebknecht, greatest political leader\r\nof the movement, has called, \"By far the most embracing, penetrating,\r\nand practical of all the harbingers of scientific Socialism.\"[10]\r\n\r\nFriederich Engels, a man not given to praising overmuch, has spoken of\r\nOwen with an enthusiasm which he rarely showed in his descriptions of\r\nmen. He calls him, \"A man of almost sublime and childlike simplicity of\r\ncharacter,\" and declares, \"Every social movement, every real advance in\r\nEngland on behalf of the workers, links itself on to the name of Robert\r\nOwen.\"[11] And even this high praise from the part-author of _The\r\nCommunist Manifesto_ who for so many years was called the \"Nestor of the\r\nSocialist movement,\" falls short, because it does not recognize the\r\ngreat influence of the man in the United States at a most important\r\nperiod of our history.\r\n\r\nRobert Owen was born of humble parentage, in a little town in North\r\nWales, on the fourteenth day of May, 1771. A most precocious child, at\r\nseven years of age, so he tells us in his \"Autobiography,\" he had\r\nfamiliarized himself with Milton's \"Paradise Lost,\" and by the time he\r\nwas ten years old he had grappled with the ages-old problems of Whence\r\nand Whither and become a skeptic! It is doubtful whether his\r\n\"skepticism\" really consisted of anything more than the consciousness\r\nthat there were apparent contradictions in the Bible, a discovery which\r\nmany a precocious lad has made at quite as early an age, and the failure\r\nof the usual theological subterfuges to satisfy a boy's frank spirit.\r\nStill, it is worthy of note as indicating his inquiring spirit.\r\n\r\nThe great dream of his childhood was that he might become an educated\r\nman. He thirsted for knowledge and wanted above all things a university\r\neducation. A passion for knowledge was the controlling force of his\r\nlife. But his parents were too poor to gratify his desire for an\r\nextensive education. He was barely ten years old when his scanty\r\nschooling ended, and he set out to fight the battle of life for himself\r\nin London.\r\n\r\nHe was apprenticed to a draper, named McGuffeg, who seems to have been a\r\nrather superior type of man. From a small peddling business he had built\r\nup one of the largest and wealthiest establishments in that part of\r\nLondon, catering to the wealthy and the titled nobility. Above all,\r\nMcGuffeg was a man of books, and in his well-stocked library young Owen\r\ncould read several hours each day, and thus make up in a measure for his\r\nearly lack of educational opportunities. During the three years of his\r\napprenticeship he read prodigiously, and laid the foundations of that\r\nliterary culture which characterized his whole life and added\r\ntremendously to his power.\r\n\r\nThis is not in any sense a biographical sketch of Robert Owen.[12] If it\r\nwere, the story of the rise of this poor, strange, strong lad, from\r\npoverty to the very pinnacle of industrial and commercial power and\r\nfame, as one of the leading manufacturers of his day, would lead through\r\npathways of romance as wonderful as any in our biographical literature.\r\nWe are concerned, however, only with his career as a social reformer and\r\nthe forces which molded it. And that, too, has its romantic side.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe closing years of the eighteenth century marked the beginning of a\r\ngreat and far-reaching industrial revolution. The introduction of new\r\nmechanical inventions enormously increased the productive powers of\r\nEngland. In 1770 Hargreaves patented his \"spinning jenny,\" and in the\r\nfollowing year Arkwright invented his \"water frame,\" a patent spinning\r\nmachine which derived its name from the fact that it was worked by water\r\npower. Later, in 1779, Crompton invented the \"mule,\" which was really a\r\ncombination of the principles of both machines. This was a long step\r\nforward, and greatly facilitated the spinning of the raw material into\r\nyarn. The invention was, in fact, a revolution in itself. Like so many\r\nother great inventors, Crompton died in poverty.\r\n\r\nEven now, however, the actual weaving had to be done by hand. Not until\r\n1785, when Dr. Cartwright, a parson, invented a \"power loom,\" was it\r\ndeemed possible to weave by machinery. Cartwright's invention, coming in\r\nthe same year as the general introduction of Watt's steam engine in the\r\ncotton industry, made the industrial revolution. Had the revolution come\r\nslowly, had the inventors of the new industrial processes been able to\r\naccomplish that, it is most probable that much of the misery of the\r\nperiod would have been avoided. As it was, terrible poverty and hardship\r\nattended the birth of the new industrial order. Owing to the expense of\r\nintroducing the machines, and the impossibility of competing with them\r\nby the old methods of production, the small manufacturers themselves\r\nwere forced to the wall, and their misery, compelling them to become\r\nwage-workers in competition with other already far too numerous\r\nwage-workers, added greatly to the woe of the time. William Morris's\r\nfine lines, written a hundred years later, express vividly what many a\r\nmanufacturer must have felt at that time:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Fast and faster our iron master,\r\n     The thing we made, forever drives.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the worst of all the results of the new regime was the\r\ndestruction of the personal relations which had hitherto existed between\r\nthe employers and their employees. No attention was paid to the\r\ninterests of the latter. The personal relation was forever gone, and\r\nonly a hard, cold cash nexus remained. Wages went down at an alarming\r\nrate, as might be expected; the housing conditions became simply\r\ninhuman. Now it was discovered that a child at one of the new looms\r\ncould do more than a dozen men had done under the old conditions, and a\r\ntremendous demand for child workers was the result. At first, as H. de\r\nB. Gibbins[13] tells us, there was a strong repugnance on the part of\r\nparents to sending their children into the factories. It was, in fact,\r\nconsidered a disgrace to do so. The term \"factory girl\" was an insulting\r\nepithet, and it was impossible for a girl who had been employed in a\r\nfactory to obtain other employment. She could not look forward to\r\nmarriage with any but the very lowest of men, so degrading was factory\r\nemployment considered to be. But the manufacturers had to get children\r\nsomehow, and they got them. They got them from the workhouses.\r\nPretending that they were going to apprentice them to a trade, they\r\narranged with the overseers of the poor regular days for the inspection\r\nof these workhouse children. Those chosen were conveyed to their\r\ndestination, packed in wagons or canal boats, and from that moment were\r\ndoomed to the most awful form of slavery.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes regular traffickers would take the place of the\r\nmanufacturer,\" says Gibbins,[14] \"and transfer a number of children to a\r\nfactory district, and there keep them, generally in some dark cellar,\r\ntill they could hand them over to a mill owner in want of hands, who\r\nwould come and examine their height, strength, and bodily capacities,\r\nexactly as did the slave owners in the American markets. After that the\r\nchildren were simply at the mercy of their owners, nominally as\r\napprentices, but in reality as mere slaves, who got no wages and whom it\r\nwas not worth while even to feed and clothe properly, because they were\r\nso cheap and their places could be so easily supplied. It was often\r\narranged by the parish authorities, in order to get rid of imbeciles,\r\nthat one idiot should be taken by the mill owner with every twenty sane\r\nchildren. The fate of these unhappy idiots was even worse than that of\r\nthe others. The secret of their final end has never been disclosed, but\r\nwe can form some idea of their awful sufferings from the hardships of\r\nthe other victims to capitalist greed and cruelty. The hours of their\r\nlabor were only limited by exhaustion, after many modes of torture had\r\nbeen unavailingly applied to force continued work. Children were often\r\nworked sixteen hours a day, by day and by night.\"\r\n\r\nTerrible as this summary is, it does not equal in horror the account\r\ngiven by \"Alfred,\"[15] in his \"History of the Factory System\": \"In\r\nstench, in heated rooms, amid the constant whirl of a thousand wheels,\r\nlittle fingers and little feet were kept in ceaseless action, forced\r\ninto unnatural activity by blows from the heavy hands and feet of the\r\nmerciless overlooker, and the infliction of bodily pain by instruments\r\nof punishment invented by the sharpened ingenuity of insatiable\r\nselfishness.\" The children were fed upon the cheapest and coarsest food,\r\noften the same as that served to their master's pigs. They slept by\r\nturns, and in relays, in filthy beds that were never cool. There was\r\noften no discrimination between the sexes, and disease, misery, and vice\r\nflourished. Some of these miserable creatures would try to run away, and\r\nto prevent them, those suspected had irons riveted on their ankles, with\r\nlong links reaching up to the hips, and were compelled to sleep and work\r\nwith them on, young women and girls, as well as boys, suffering this\r\nbrutal treatment. The number of deaths was so great that burials took\r\nplace secretly, at night, lest an outcry should be raised. Many of the\r\nchildren committed suicide.\r\n\r\nThese statements are so appalling that, as Mr. R. W. Cooke-Taylor\r\nsays,[16] they would be \"absolutely incredible\" were they not fully\r\nborne out by evidence from other sources. It is not contended, of\r\ncourse, that conditions in all factories were as bad as those described.\r\nBut it must be said emphatically that there were worse horrors than any\r\nhere quoted, and equally emphatically that the very best factories were\r\nonly a little better than those described. Take, for instance, the\r\naccount given by Robert Owen of the conditions which obtained in the\r\n\"model factory\" of the time, the establishment at New Lanark, Scotland,\r\nowned by Mr. David Dale, where Owen himself was destined to introduce so\r\nmany striking reforms. Owen assumed control of the New Lanark mills on\r\nthe first day of the year 1800. In his \"Autobiography,\"[17] he gives\r\nsome account of the conditions which he found there, in the \"best\r\nregulated factory in the world,\" at that time. There were, says Owen,\r\nabout five hundred children employed, who \"were received as early as six\r\nyears old, the pauper authorities declining to send them at any later\r\nage.\" They worked from six in the morning until seven in the evening,\r\nand _then their education began_. They hated their slavery, and many\r\nabsconded. Many were dwarfed and stunted in stature, and when they were\r\nthrough their \"apprenticeship,\" at thirteen or fifteen years of age,\r\nthey commonly went off to Glasgow or Edinburgh, with no guardians,\r\nignorant and ready--\"admirably suited,\" is Owen's phrase--to swell the\r\ngreat mass of vice and misery in the towns. The people in New Lanark\r\nlived \"almost without control, in habits of vice, idleness, poverty,\r\ndebt, and destitution. Thieving was general.\" With such conditions\r\nexisting in a model factory, under a master whose benevolence was\r\ncelebrated everywhere, it can be very readily believed that conditions\r\nelsewhere must have been abominable.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the appalling poverty which developed, it soon became\r\nnecessary for poor parents to permit their children to go into the\r\nfactories. The mighty machines were far too powerful for the prejudices\r\nof parental hearts. Child wage-workers became common. They were\r\nsubjected to little better conditions than the parish apprentices had\r\nbeen; in fact, they were often employed alongside of them. Fathers were\r\nunemployed and frequently took meals to their little ones who were at\r\nwork--a condition which sometimes obtains in some parts of the United\r\nStates even to this day. Michael Sadler, a member of the House of\r\nCommons and a fearless champion of the rights of the poor and\r\noppressed, described this aspect of the evil in touching verse.[18]\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, let it be remembered, the English philanthropists,\r\nand among them many capitalists, were agitating against negro slavery in\r\nAfrica and elsewhere, and raising funds for the emancipation of the\r\nslaves. Says Gibbins,[19] \"The spectacle of England buying the freedom\r\nof black slaves by riches drawn from the labor of her white ones affords\r\nan interesting study for the cynical philosopher.\"\r\n\r\nAs we read the accounts of the distress which followed upon the\r\nintroduction of the new mechanical inventions, it is impossible to\r\nregard with surprise or with condemnatory feelings, the riots of the\r\nmisguided \"Luddites\" who went about destroying machinery in their blind\r\ndesperation. Ned Lud, after whom the Luddites were named, was an idiot,\r\nbut wiser men, finding themselves reduced to abject poverty through the\r\nintroduction of the giant machines, could see no further than he. It was\r\nnot to be expected that the masses should understand that it was not the\r\nmachines, but the institution of their private ownership, and use for\r\nprivate gain, that was wrong. And just as we cannot regard with surprise\r\nthe action of the Luddites in destroying machinery, it is easy to\r\nunderstand how the social unrest of the time produced Utopian movements\r\nwith numerous and enthusiastic adherents.\r\n\r\nThe Luddites were not the first to make war upon machinery. In 1758, for\r\nexample, Everet's first machine for dressing wool, an ingenious\r\ncontrivance worked by water power, was set upon by a mob and reduced to\r\nashes. From that time on similar outbreaks occurred with more or less\r\nfrequency; but it was not until 1810 that the organized bodies of\r\nLuddites went from town to town, sacking factories and destroying the\r\nmachines in their blind revolt. The contest between the capitalist and\r\nthe wage-worker, which, as Karl Marx says, dates back to the very origin\r\nof capital, took on a new form when machinery was introduced.\r\nHenceforth, the worker fights not only, nor even mainly, against the\r\ncapitalist, but against the machine, as the material basis of capitalist\r\nexploitation. This is a distinct phase of the struggle of the\r\nproletariat everywhere.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century the ribbon loom, a machine for weaving ribbon,\r\nwas invented in Germany. Marx quotes an Italian traveler, Abbe\r\nLancellotti, who wrote in 1579, as follows: \"Anthony Mueller, of Danzig,\r\nsaw about fifty years ago, in that town, a very ingenious machine, which\r\nweaves four to six pieces at once. But the mayor, being apprehensive\r\nthat this invention might throw a large number of workmen on the\r\nstreets, caused the inventor to be secretly strangled or drowned.\"[20]\r\nIn 1629 this ribbon loom was introduced into Leyden, where the riots of\r\nthe ribbon weavers forced the town council to prohibit it. In 1676 its\r\nuse was prohibited in Cologne, at the same time that its introduction\r\nwas causing serious disturbances in England. \"By an imperial Edict of\r\nthe 19th of February, 1685, its use was forbidden throughout all\r\nGermany. In Hamburg it was burned in public, by order of the Senate. The\r\nEmperor Charles VI, on the 9th of February, 1719, renewed the Edict of\r\n1685, and not till 1765 was its use openly allowed in the Electorate of\r\nSaxony. This machine, which shook all Europe to its foundations, was in\r\nfact the precursor of the mule and power loom, and of the industrial\r\nrevolution of the eighteenth century. It enabled a totally inexperienced\r\nboy to set the whole loom, with all its shuttles, in motion by simply\r\nmoving a rod backward and forward, and in its improved form produced\r\nfrom forty to fifty pieces at once.\"[21]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of machinery has universally caused the workers to\r\nrevolt. Much futile denunciation has been poured upon the blind, stupid\r\nresistance of the workers, but in view of the misery and poverty which\r\nthey have suffered, it is impossible to judge them harshly. Their\r\npassionate, futile resistance to the irresistible moves to pity rather\r\nthan to condemnation. As Marx justly says, \"It took both time and\r\nexperience before the work people learned to distinguish between\r\nmachinery and its employment by capital, and to direct their attacks,\r\nnot against the material instruments of production, but against the mode\r\nin which they are used.\"[22]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nUnder the new industrial regime, Robert Owen, erstwhile a poor draper's\r\napprentice, soon became one of the most successful manufacturers in\r\nEngland. At eighteen years of age we find him entering into the\r\nmanufacture of the new cotton-spinning machines, with a borrowed capital\r\nof $500. His partner was a man named Jones, and though the enterprise\r\nwas successful from a financial point of view, the partnership proved to\r\nbe most disagreeable. Accordingly it was dissolved, Owen taking three of\r\nthe \"mules\" which they were making as a reimbursement for his\r\ninvestment. With these and some other machinery, Owen entered the cotton\r\nmanufacturing industry, employing at first only three men. He made $1500\r\nas his first year's profit.\r\n\r\nErelong Owen ceased manufacturing upon his own account, and became\r\nsuperintendent of a Manchester cotton mill, owned by a Mr. Drinkwater,\r\nand employing some five hundred work people. A most progressive man, in\r\nhis new position Owen was always ready to introduce new machinery, and\r\nto embark upon experiments, with a view to improving the quality of the\r\nproduct of the factory.[23] In this he was so successful that the goods\r\nmanufactured at the Drinkwater mill soon commanded a fifty per cent\r\nadvance above the regular market prices. Drinkwater, delighted at\r\nresults like these, made Owen his partner. Thus when he was barely\r\ntwenty years of age Owen had secured an eminent position among the\r\ncotton manufacturers of the time. It is interesting to recall that Owen,\r\nin that same year, 1791, used the first cotton ever brought into England\r\nfrom the United States. \"American sea island cotton,\" as it was called\r\nfrom the fact that it was then grown only upon the islands near the\r\nsouthern coast of the United States, was not believed to be of any value\r\nfor manufacture on account, chiefly, of its poor color. But when a\r\ncotton broker named Spear received three hundred pounds of it from an\r\nAmerican planter, with the request that he get some competent spinner to\r\ntest it, Owen, with characteristic readiness, undertook the test and\r\nsucceeded in making a much finer product than had hitherto been made\r\nfrom the French cotton, though inferior to it in color. That was the\r\nfirst introduction of American cotton, destined soon to furnish English\r\ncotton mills with the greater part of their raw material.\r\n\r\nOwen did not long remain with Mr. Drinkwater. He accepted another\r\nprofitable partnership in Manchester, and it was at this time that he\r\nbecame active in social reform work. As a member of an important\r\nliterary and philosophical society, he was thrown much into the company\r\nof men distinguished in all walks of life, one of his friends and\r\nadmirers being the poet Coleridge. Here he began that agitation which\r\nled to the passing of the very first factory act of Sir Robert Peel, in\r\n1802. The suffering of the children moved his great humane heart to\r\npity. He well knew that his own wealth and the wealth of his\r\nfellow-capitalists had been purchased at a terrible cost in child life.\r\nHe was only a philanthropist as yet; he saw only the pitiful waste of\r\nlife involved, and sought to impress men of wealth with what he felt.\r\nHis mind was constantly occupied with plans for practical, constructive\r\nphilanthropy upon a scale never before attempted.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the nineteenth century, Owen entered upon the\r\nwonderful philanthropic career at New Lanark, which attracted universal\r\nattention, and ultimately led him to those social experiments and\r\ntheories which won for him the title of \"Father of Modern Socialism.\"\r\nWe have already seen what the conditions were in the \"model factory\"\r\nwhen Owen assumed control. His influence was at once directed to the\r\ntask of ameliorating the condition of the work people. He shortened the\r\nhours of labor, introduced sanitary reforms, protected the people\r\nagainst the exploitation of traders through a vicious credit system,\r\nopening a store and supplying them with goods at cost, and established\r\ninfant schools, the first of their kind, for the care and education of\r\nchildren from two years of age and upward. Still, the workers themselves\r\nwere suspicious of this man who, so different from other employers, was\r\nzealous in doing things for them. He really knew nothing of the working\r\nclass, and it had never occurred to him that they might do anything for\r\nthemselves. New Lanark under Owen was, to use the phrase which Mr. Ghent\r\nhas adopted from Fourier, \"a benevolent feudalism.\" Owen complains\r\npathetically, \"Yet the work people were systematically opposed to every\r\nchange which I proposed, and did whatever they could to frustrate my\r\nobject.\"[24]\r\n\r\nOpportunity to win the affection and confidence of his employees came to\r\nOwen at last, and he was not slow to embrace it. In 1806 the United\r\nStates, in consequence of a diplomatic rupture with England, placed an\r\nembargo upon the shipment of raw cotton to that country. Everywhere\r\nmills were shut down, and there was the utmost distress in consequence.\r\nThe New Lanark mills, in common with most others, were shut down for\r\nfour months, during which time Owen paid every worker his or her wages\r\nin full, at a cost of over $35,000. Forever afterward he enjoyed the\r\nlove and trust of his work people. In spite of all his seemingly\r\nreckless expenditure upon purely philanthropic work, the mills yielded\r\nan enormous profit. But Owen was constantly in conflict with his\r\nbusiness associates, who sought to restrict his philanthropic\r\nexpenditures, with the result that he was compelled again and again to\r\nchange partners, always securing their interests and returning them big\r\nprofits upon their investments, until finally, in 1829, he left New\r\nLanark altogether.\r\n\r\nDuring twenty-nine years he had carried on the business with splendid\r\ncommercial success and at the same time attracted universal attention to\r\nNew Lanark as the theater of the greatest experiments in social\r\nregeneration the modern world had known. Every year thousands of persons\r\nfrom all parts of the world, many of them statesmen and representatives\r\nof the crowned heads of Europe, visited New Lanark to study these\r\nexperiments, and never were they seriously criticised or their success\r\nchallenged. It was a wonderful achievement. Had Owen's life ended in\r\n1829, he must have taken rank in history as one of the truly great men\r\nof the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nLet us now consider briefly the forces which led this gentle\r\nphilanthropist onward to the goal of Communism. His experiences at New\r\nLanark had convinced him that human character depends in large part\r\nupon, and is shaped by, environment. Others before Owen had perceived\r\nthis, but he must ever be regarded as one of the pioneers in the spread\r\nof the idea, one of the first to give it definite form and to\r\ndemonstrate its truth upon a large scale. In the first of those keen\r\n\"Essays on the Formation of Human Character,\" in which he recounts the\r\nresults of his New Lanark system of education, Owen says, \"Any general\r\ncharacter from the best to the worst, from the most ignorant to the most\r\nenlightened, may be given to any community, even to the world at large,\r\nby the application of proper means; which means are to a great extent at\r\nthe command and under the control of those who have influence in the\r\naffairs of men.\"\r\n\r\nWe may admit that there is a good deal of overemphasis in this\r\nstatement, but the doctrine itself does not seem strange or sensational\r\nto-day. It might be promulgated in any fashionable church, or in any\r\nministerial conference, without exciting more than a languid, passing\r\ninterest. But in Owen's time it was far otherwise. Such a doctrine\r\nstruck at the very roots of current theology and all that organized\r\nChristianity consciously stood for. It denied the doctrine of the\r\nfreedom of the will, upon which the elaborate theology of the church\r\nrested. No wonder, then, that it brought much bitter denunciation upon\r\nthe heads of its promulgators. A poet of the period, in a poem dedicated\r\nto Owen, aptly expresses the doctrine in somewhat prosaic verse:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"We are the creatures of external things,\r\n     Acting on inward organs, and are made\r\n     To think and do whate'er our tutors please.\r\n     What folly, then, to punish or reward\r\n     For deeds o'er which we never held a curb!\r\n     What woeful ignorance, to teach the crime\r\n     And then chastise the pupil for his guilt!\"[25]\r\n\r\n\r\nOwen learned other things at New Lanark besides the truth that character\r\nis formed largely by environment. Starting out with no other purpose\r\nthan to ameliorate the conditions of his work people, he realized before\r\nmany years had passed that he could never do for them the one essential\r\nthing--secure their real liberty. \"The people were slaves of my mercy,\"\r\nhe writes.[26] He saw, though but dimly at first, that no man could be\r\nfree who depended upon another for the right to earn his bread, no\r\nmatter how good the bread-master might be. The hopelessness of expecting\r\nreform from the manufacturers themselves was painfully forced upon him.\r\nFirst of all, there was the bitter hostility of those of his class who\r\nhad no sympathy with his philanthropic ideas, manifested from the\r\nbeginning of his agitation at Manchester. Then there was the incessant\r\nconflict with his own associates, who, though they represented the\r\nnoblest and best elements of the manufacturing class, constantly opposed\r\nhim and regarded as dangerous and immoral his belief in the inherent\r\nright of every child to the opportunities of sound physical, mental, and\r\nmoral culture. Class consciousness had not yet become a recognized term\r\nin sociological discussions, but class consciousness, the instinctive\r\nconformity of thought and action with class interests, was a fact which\r\nconfronted Owen at every step.\r\n\r\nThe Luddite riots of 1810-1811 awakened England to the importance of the\r\nlabor question, and Owen, who since 1805 had been devoting much time to\r\nits study, secured a wider audience and a much more serious hearing than\r\never before. Then came the frightful misery of 1815, due to the crisis\r\nwhich the end of the great war produced. Every one seemed to think that\r\nwhen the war was over and peace restored, there would be a tremendous\r\nincrease in prosperity. What happened was precisely the opposite; for a\r\ntime at least things were immeasurably worse than before. Peace did not\r\nbring with it plenty, but penury.\r\n\r\nOwen, more clearly than any other man of the time, explained the real\r\nnature of the crisis. The war had given an important spur to industry\r\nand encouraged many new inventions and chemical discoveries. \"The war\r\nwas the great and most extravagant customer of farmers, manufacturers,\r\nand other producers of wealth, and many during this period became very\r\nwealthy.... And on the day on which peace was signed, the great customer\r\nof the producers died, and prices fell as the demand diminished, until\r\nthe prime cost of the articles required for war could not be\r\nobtained.... Barns and farmyards were full, warehouses loaded, and such\r\nwas our artificial state of society that this very superabundance of\r\nwealth was the sole cause of the existing distress. _Burn the stock in\r\nthe farmyards and warehouses, and prosperity would immediately\r\nrecommence, in the same manner as if the war had continued._ This want\r\nof demand at remunerating prices compelled the master producers to\r\nconsider what they could do to diminish the amount of their productions\r\nand the cost of producing until these surplus stocks could be taken out\r\nof the market. To effect these results, every economy in producing was\r\nresorted to, and men being more expensive machines for producing than\r\nmechanical and chemical inventions and discoveries so extensively\r\nbrought into action during the war, the men were discharged and the\r\nmachines were made to supersede them--while the numbers of the\r\nunemployed were increased by the discharge of men from the army and\r\nnavy. Hence the great distress for want of work among all classes whose\r\nlabor was so much in demand while the war continued. This increase of\r\nmechanical and chemical power was continually diminishing the demand\r\nfor, and value of, manual labor, and would continue to do so, and would\r\neffect great changes throughout society.\"[27]\r\n\r\nIn this statement there are several points worthy of attention. In the\r\nfirst place, the analysis of the crisis of 1815 is very like the later\r\nanalyses of commercial crises by the Marxists; secondly, the antagonism\r\nof class interests is clearly developed, so far as the basic interests\r\nof the employers and their employees are concerned. The former, in order\r\nto conserve their interests, have to dismiss the workers, thus forcing\r\nthem into the direst poverty. Thirdly, the conflict between manual labor\r\nand machine production is frankly stated. Owen's studies were leading\r\nhim from mere philanthropism to Socialism.\r\n\r\nDuring the height of the distress of 1815, Owen called together a large\r\nnumber of cotton manufacturers at a conference, held in Glasgow, to\r\nconsider the state of the cotton trade and the prevailing distress. He\r\nproposed (1) that they should petition Parliament for the repeal of the\r\nrevenue tariff on raw cotton; (2) that they should call upon Parliament\r\nto shorten the hours of labor in the cotton mills by legislative\r\nenactment, and otherwise seek to improve the condition of the working\r\npeople. The first proposition was carried with unanimity, but the\r\nsecond, and to Owen the more important, did not even secure a\r\nseconder.[28] The conference plainly showed the power of class\r\ninterests. The spirit in which Owen faced his fellow-manufacturers is\r\nbest seen in the following extract from the address delivered by him,\r\nwith copies of which he afterward literally deluged the kingdom:--\r\n\r\n\"True, indeed, it is that the main pillar and prop of the political\r\ngreatness and prosperity of our country is a manufacture which, as now\r\ncarried on, is destructive of the health, morals, and social comfort of\r\nthe mass of people engaged in it. It is only since the introduction of\r\nthe cotton trade that children, at an age before they had acquired\r\nstrength or mental instruction, have been forced into cotton\r\nmills,--those receptacles, in too many instances, for living human\r\nskeletons, almost disrobed of intellect, where, as the business is often\r\nnow conducted, they linger out a few years of miserable existence,\r\nacquiring every bad habit which they may disseminate throughout society.\r\nIt is only since the introduction of this trade that children and even\r\ngrown people were required to labor more than twelve hours in a day, not\r\nincluding the time allotted for meals. It is only since the introduction\r\nof this trade that the sole recreation of the laborer is to be found in\r\nthe pot-house or ginshop, and it is only since the introduction of this\r\nbaneful trade that poverty, crime, and misery have made rapid and\r\nfearful strides throughout the community.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we then go unblushingly and ask the legislators of our country to\r\npass legislative acts to sanction and increase this trade--to sign the\r\ndeath warrants of the strength, morals, and happiness of thousands of\r\nour fellow-creatures, and not attempt to propose corrections for the\r\nevils which it creates? If such shall be your determination, I, for one,\r\nwill not join in the application,--no, I will, with all the faculties I\r\npossess, oppose every attempt made to extend the trade that, except in\r\nname, is more injurious to those employed in it than is the slavery in\r\nthe West Indies to the poor negroes; for deeply as I am interested in\r\nthe cotton manufacture, highly as I value the extended political power\r\nof my country, yet knowing as I do, from long experience both here and\r\nin England, the miseries which this trade, as it is now conducted,\r\ninflicts on those to whom it gives employment, I do not hesitate to say:\r\n_Perish the cotton trade, perish even the political superiority of our\r\ncountry, if it depends on the cotton trade, rather than that they shall\r\nbe upheld by the sacrifice of everything valuable in life._\"[29]\r\n\r\nThis conference doubtless had much to do with Owen's acceptance of a\r\ncommunistic ideal approaching that of modern Socialism in many important\r\nrespects. It certainly intensified the hatred and fear of those\r\nmanufacturers whose interests he had so courageously attacked. In 1817\r\nwe find him proposing to the British government the establishment of\r\ncommunistic villages, as the best means of remedying the terrible\r\ndistress which prevailed at that time. From this time onward his\r\ninterest in mere surface reforms such as he had been carrying on at New\r\nLanark seemed to wane. He became at this juncture an apostle of\r\nCommunism, or as he later preferred to say, Socialism. His ideal was a\r\ncooeperative world, with perfect equality between the sexes. He had\r\ncompletely demonstrated to his own mind that private property was\r\nincompatible with social well-being. Every month of his experience at\r\nNew Lanark had deeply impressed him with the conviction that to make it\r\npossible for all people to live equally happy and moral lives they must\r\nhave equal material resources and conditions of life, and he could not\r\nunderstand why it had never occurred to others before him.\r\n\r\nHere we have the essential characteristic of Utopian Socialism as\r\ndistinguished from modern, or scientific, Socialism. The Utopians regard\r\nhuman life as something plastic and capable of being shaped and molded\r\naccording to systems and plans. All that is necessary is to take some\r\nabstract principle as a standard, and then prepare a plan for the\r\nreorganization of society in conformity with that principle. If the plan\r\nis perfect, it will be enough to demonstrate its advantages as one would\r\ndemonstrate a sum in arithmetic. The scientific Socialists, on the other\r\nhand, are evolutionists. Society, they believe, cannot take leaps at\r\nwill; social changes are products of the past and the present. They\r\ndistrust social inventors and schemes. Socialism is not an ingenious\r\nplan for the realization of abstract Justice, or Brotherhood, but a\r\nnecessary outgrowth of the centuries. Owen, then, was a Utopian. He\r\nregarded himself as one inspired, an inspired inventor of a new social\r\nsystem, and believed that it was only necessary for him to demonstrate\r\nthe truth of his contentions and theories, by argument and practical\r\nexperiment, to bring about the transformation of the world. He\r\nconducted a tremendous propaganda, by means of newspapers, pamphlets,\r\nlectures, and debates, and established various communities in England\r\nand this country. In face of a bitter opposition and repeated failure,\r\nhe kept on with sublime faith and unbounded courage which nothing could\r\nshake.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Owen began the greatest and most splendid of his social\r\nexperiments in the village of Harmonie, Indiana, in the beautiful valley\r\nof the Wabash. The place had already been the theater of an interesting\r\nexperiment in religious communism, Owen having bought the property from\r\nthe Rappites. In February and March, 1825, the brave reformer addressed\r\ntwo of the most distinguished audiences ever gathered in the Hall of\r\nRepresentatives at the national capital. In the audiences were the\r\nPresident of the United States, the Judges of the Supreme Court, several\r\nmembers of the cabinet, and almost the entire membership of both houses\r\nof Congress. Owen explained his plans for the regeneration of society in\r\ndetail, exhibiting a model of the buildings to be erected. It is almost\r\nimpossible to realize at this day the tremendous interest which his\r\nappeal to Congress awakened. His vision of a re-created world caught the\r\npopular imagination.\r\n\r\nAmong those whose minds were fired was a boy of sixteen, tall, lank,\r\nuncouth, and poor. Word had come to him of Owen's splendid undertaking,\r\nand he had caught something of the enthusiasm of the great dreamer.\r\nAbove all, it was said that New Harmony was to be a wonderful center of\r\nlearning, that the foremost educators of the world would establish great\r\nschools there, fully equipped with books and all sorts of appliances. To\r\nbe a scholar had been the boy's one great ambition, so he yearned\r\nwistfully for an opportunity to join the new community. But his father\r\nforbidding, claiming his services, the boy suffered grievous\r\ndisappointment. One wonders what effect residence at New Harmony would\r\nhave had upon the life of Abraham Lincoln, and upon the history of\r\nAmerica! And how much, one wonders, was that splendid life influenced by\r\nthat boyish interest in the regeneration of the world?\r\n\r\nThat the influence of New Harmony was felt by Lincoln we know. It was a\r\nchild of New Harmony, Robert Dale Owen, son of Robert Owen, who, when\r\nemancipation seemed to hang in the balance, penned his remarkable letter\r\nto President Lincoln, dated September seventeenth, 1862. \"Its perusal\r\nthrilled me like a trumpet call,\" said the great President. Five days\r\nafter its receipt the Preliminary Proclamation was issued. \"Your letter\r\nto the President had more influence on him than any other document which\r\nreached him on the subject--I think I might say than all others put\r\ntogether. I speak of that which I know from personal conference with\r\nhim,\" wrote Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nNew Harmony failed. Other communities established by Owen failed, but\r\nthe story of their failure is nevertheless full of inspiration. The\r\nworld has long since written the word \"Failure\" as an epitaph for Robert\r\nOwen. But what a splendid failure that life was! Standing by his grave\r\none day, in the picturesque little churchyard at Newton, by a bend of\r\nthe winding river, not far from the ruins of the ancient castle home of\r\nthe famous Deist, Lord Herbert, the writer said to an old Welsh laborer,\r\n\"But his life was a failure, was it not?\" The old man gazed awhile at\r\nthe grave, and then with a voice of unforgettable reverence and love\r\nanswered, \"I suppose it was, sir, as the world goes; a failure like\r\nJesus Christ's. But I don't call it failure, sir. He established infant\r\nschools; he founded the great cooeperative movement; he helped to make\r\nthe trade unions;[30] he helped to give us the factory acts; he worked\r\nfor peace between two great countries. His Socialism has not been\r\nrealized yet, nor has Christ's--but it will come!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nOwen was not the only builder of Utopias in his time. In the same year\r\nthat Owen launched his New Harmony venture, there died in Paris another\r\ndreamer of social millenniums, a gentle mystic, Henry de Saint-Simon,\r\nand in 1837, the year of Owen's third Socialist congress, another great\r\nUtopist died in the French capital, Charles Fourier. Each of these\r\ncontributed something to the development of the theories of Socialism,\r\neach has a legitimate place in the history of the Socialist movement.\r\nBut this little work is not intended to give the history of\r\nSocialism.[31] I have taken only one of the three great Utopists, as\r\nrepresentative of them all: one who seems to me to be much nearer to the\r\nlater scientific movement pioneered by Marx and Engels than any of the\r\nothers. In the Socialism of Owen, we have Utopian Socialism at its best.\r\n\r\nWhat distinguishes the Utopian Socialists from their scientific\r\nsuccessors we have already noted. Engels expresses the principle very\r\nclearly in the following luminous passage: \"One thing is common to all\r\nthree. Not one of them appears as a representative of the interests of\r\nthat proletariat which historical development had ... produced. Like the\r\nFrench philosophers,[32] they do not claim to emancipate a particular\r\nclass to begin with, but all humanity at once. Like them, they wish to\r\nbring in the kingdom of reason and eternal justice, but this kingdom, as\r\nthey see it, is as far as heaven from earth from that of the French\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\n\"For, to our three social reformers, the bourgeois world, based upon the\r\nprinciples of these philosophers, is quite as irrational and unjust,\r\nand, therefore, finds its way to the dust hole quite as readily, as\r\nfeudalism and all the earlier stages of society. If pure reason and\r\njustice had not, hitherto, ruled the world, this has been the case only\r\nbecause men have not rightly understood them. What was wanted was the\r\nindividual man of genius, who has now arisen and who understands the\r\ntruth. That he has now arisen, that the truth has now been clearly\r\nunderstood, is not an inevitable event, following of necessity in the\r\nchain of historical development, but a mere happy accident. He might\r\njust as well have been born five hundred years earlier, and might then\r\nhave spared humanity five hundred years of error, strife, and\r\nsuffering.\"[33]\r\n\r\nNeither of these great Utopists had anything like the conception of\r\nsocial evolution, determined by economic conditions and the resulting\r\nconflicts of economic classes, which constitutes the base of the\r\nphilosophy of the scientific Socialists. Each of them had some faint\r\ncomprehension of isolated facts, but neither of them developed his\r\nknowledge very far, nor could the facts appear to them as correlated\r\nlater by Marx. Saint-Simon, as we know, recognized the class struggle in\r\nthe French Revolution, and saw in the Reign of Terror only the momentary\r\nreign of the non-possessing masses;[34] he saw, too, that the political\r\nquestion was fundamentally an economic question, declaring that politics\r\nis the science of production, and prophesying that politics would be\r\nabsorbed by economics.[35] Fourier, we also know, applied the principle\r\nof evolution to society. He divided the history of society into four\r\ngreat epochs--savagery, barbarism, the patriarchate, and\r\ncivilization.[36] But just as Saint-Simon failed to grasp the\r\nsignificance of the class conflict, and its relation to the fundamental\r\ncharacter of economic institutions, which he dimly perceived, so Fourier\r\nfailed to grasp the significance of the evolutionary process which he\r\ndescribed, and, like Saint-Simon, he halted upon the brink, so to speak,\r\nof an important discovery. His concept of social evolution meant little\r\nto him and possessed only an academic interest. And Owen, in many\r\nrespects the greatest of the three, realized in a practical manner that\r\nthe industrial problem was a class conflict. Not only had he found in\r\n1815 that pity was powerless to move the hearts of his\r\nfellow-manufacturers when their class interests were concerned, but\r\nlater, in 1818, when he went to present his famous memorial to the\r\nCongress of Sovereigns at Aix-la-Chapelle, he had another lesson of the\r\nsame kind. At Frankfort, Germany, he tarried on his way to the Congress,\r\nand was invited to attend a notable dinner to meet the Secretary of the\r\nCongress, M. Gentz, a famous diplomat of the day, \"who enjoyed the full\r\nconfidence of the leading despots of Europe.\" After Owen had outlined\r\nhis schemes for social amelioration, M. Gentz was asked for his reply,\r\nand Owen tells us that the diplomat answered, \"We know very well that\r\nwhat you say is true, but how could we govern the masses, if they were\r\nwealthy, and so, independent of us?\"[37] Lord Lauderdale, too, had\r\nexclaimed on another occasion, \"Nothing [_i.e._ than Owen's plans] could\r\nbe more complete for the poor and working classes, but what will become\r\nof us?\"[38] Scattered throughout Owen's writings and speeches are\r\nnumerous evidences that he at times recognized the class antagonisms in\r\nindustrial society as the heart of the industrial problem,[39] but to\r\nhim, also, the germ of an important truth meant practically nothing. He\r\nsaw only the facts in their isolation, and made no attempt to discover\r\ntheir meaning or to relate them to his teaching.\r\n\r\nEach of the three men regarded himself as the discoverer of the truth\r\nwhich would redeem the world; each devoted himself with magnificent\r\nfaith and heroic courage to his task; each failed to realize his hopes;\r\nand each left behind him faithful disciples and followers, confident\r\nthat the day must come at last when the suffering and disinherited of\r\nearth will be able to say, in Owen's dying words, \"Relief has come.\"\r\nPerhaps no better estimate of the value of the visions of these great\r\nUtopists has ever been penned than that by Emerson in the following\r\ntribute to Owen:[40]--\r\n\r\n\"Robert Owen of New Lanark came hither from England in 1845 to read\r\nlectures or hold conversations wherever he could find listeners--the\r\nmost amiable, sanguine, and candid of men. He had not the least doubt\r\nthat he had hit on the plan of right and perfect Socialism, or that\r\nmankind would adopt it. He was then seventy years old, and being asked,\r\n'Well, Mr. Owen, who is your disciple? how many men are there possessed\r\nof your views who will remain after you are gone to put them in\r\npractice?' 'Not one,' was the reply. Robert Owen knew Fourier in his old\r\nage. He said that Fourier learned of him all the truth that he had. The\r\nrest of his system was imagination, and the imagination of a visionary.\r\nOwen made the best impression by his rare benevolence. His love of men\r\nmade us forget his 'three errors.' His charitable construction of men\r\nand their actions was invariable. He was the better Christian in his\r\ncontroversies with Christians.\r\n\r\n\"And truly I honor the generous ideas of the Socialists, the\r\nmagnificence of their theories, and the enthusiasm with which they have\r\nbeen urged. They appeared inspired men of their time. Mr. Owen preached\r\nhis doctrine of labor and reward with the fidelity and devotion of a\r\nsaint in the slow ears of his generation.\r\n\r\n\"One feels that these philosophers have skipped no fact but one, namely,\r\nlife. They treat man as a plastic thing, or something that may be put up\r\nor down, ripened or retarded, molded, polished, made into solid or fluid\r\nor gas at the will of the leader; or perhaps as a vegetable, from which,\r\nthough now a very poor crab, a very good peach can by manure and\r\nexposure be in time produced--and skip the faculty of life which spawns\r\nand spurns systems and system makers; which eludes all conditions; which\r\nmakes or supplants a thousand Phalanxes and New Harmonies with each\r\npulsation....\r\n\r\n\"Yet, in a day of small, sour and fierce schemes, one is admonished and\r\ncheered by a project of such friendly aims, and of such bold and\r\ngenerous proportions; there is an intellectual courage and strength in\r\nit which is superior and commanding; it certifies the presence of so\r\nmuch truth in the theory, and in so far is destined to be fact.\r\n\r\n\"I regard these philanthropists as themselves the effects of the age in\r\nwhich they live, in common with so many other good facts the\r\nefflorescence of the period and predicting the good fruit that ripens.\r\nThey were not the creators that they believed themselves to be; but they\r\nwere unconscious prophets of the true state of society, one which the\r\ntendencies of nature lead unto, one which always establishes itself for\r\nthe sane soul, though not in that manner in which they paint it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Our visions have not come to naught,\r\n     Who saw by lightning in the night;\r\n     The deeds we dreamed are being wrought\r\n     By those who work in clearer light;\r\n     In other ways our fight is fought,\r\n     And other forms fulfill our thought\r\n     Made visible to all men's sight.\"[41]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] _Karl Marx: Biographical Memoirs_, by Wilhelm Liebknecht, page 101.\r\n\r\n[11] _Socialism, Utopian and Scientific_, by F.

When it was written, at the end of 1847,\r\nlittle remained of those great movements which in the early part of the\r\ncentury had inspired millions with high hopes of social regeneration and\r\nrekindled the beacon fires of faith in the world. The Saint-Simonians\r\nhad, as an organized body, disappeared; the Fourierists were a dwindling\r\nsect, discouraged by the failure of the one great trial of their system,\r\nthe famous Brook Farm experiment, in the United States; the Owenite\r\nmovement had never recovered from the failures of the experiments at New\r\nHarmony and elsewhere, and had lost much of its identity through the\r\nmultiplicity of interests embraced in Owen's later propaganda. Chartism\r\nand Trade Unionism on the one hand, and the Cooeperative Societies on the\r\nother, had, between them, absorbed most of the vital elements of the\r\nOwenite movement.\r\n\r\nThere was a multitude of what Engels calls \"social quacks,\" but the\r\nreally great social movements, Owenism in England, and Fourierism in\r\nFrance, were utterly demoralized and rapidly dwindling away. One thing\r\nonly served to keep the flame of hope alive--\"the crude, rough-hewn,\r\npurely instinctive sort of Communism\" of the workers. This Communism of\r\nthe working class differed very essentially from the Socialism of\r\nFourier and Owen. It was Utopian, being based, like all Utopian\r\nmovements, upon abstract ideas. It differed from Fourierism and Owenism,\r\nhowever, in that instead of a universal appeal based upon Brotherhood,\r\nJustice, Order, and Economy, its appeal was, primarily, to the laborer.\r\nIts basis was the crude class doctrine of \"the rights of Labor.\" The\r\nlaborer was appealed to as one suffering from oppression and injustice.\r\nIt was, therefore, distinctly a class movement, and its\r\nclass-consciousness was sufficiently developed to keep its leaders from\r\nwasting their lives in abortive appeals to the master class. The leading\r\nexponents of this Communism of the workers were Wilhelm Weitling, in\r\nGermany, and Etienne Cabet, in France.\r\n\r\nWeitling was a man of the people. He was born in Magdeburg, Germany, in\r\n1808, the illegitimate child of a humble woman and her soldier lover. He\r\nbecame a tailor, and, as was the custom in Germany at that time,\r\ntraveled extensively during his apprenticeship. In 1838 his first\r\nimportant work, \"The World As It Is, and As It Might Be,\" appeared,\r\npublished in Paris by a secret revolutionary society consisting of\r\nGerman workingmen of the \"Young Germany\" movement. In this work Weitling\r\nfirst expounded at length his communistic theories. It is claimed[42]\r\nthat his conversion to Communism was the result of the chance placing of\r\na Fourierist paper upon the table of a Berlin coffeehouse, by Albert\r\nBrisbane, the brilliant friend and disciple of Fourier, his first\r\nexponent in the English language. This may well be true, for, as we\r\nshall see, Weitling's views are mainly based upon those of the great\r\nFrench Utopist. In 1842 Weitling published his best-known work, the book\r\nupon which his literary fame chiefly rests, \"The Guaranties of Harmony\r\nand Freedom.\" This work at once attracted wide attention, and gave\r\nWeitling a foremost place among the writers of the time in the\r\naffections of the educated workers. It was an elaboration of the\r\ntheories contained in his earlier book. Morris Hillquit[43] thus\r\ndescribes Weitling's philosophy and method:--\r\n\r\n\"In his social philosophy, Weitling may be said to have been the\r\nconnecting link between primitive and modern Socialism. In the main, he\r\nis still a Utopian, and his writings betray the unmistakable influence\r\nof the early French Socialists. In common with all Utopians, he bases\r\nhis philosophy exclusively upon moral grounds. Misery and poverty are to\r\nhim but the results of human malice, and his cry is for 'eternal\r\njustice' and for the 'absolute liberty and equality of all mankind.' In\r\nhis criticism of the existing order, he leans closely on Fourier, from\r\nwhom he also borrowed the division of labor into three classes of the\r\nNecessary, Useful, and Attractive, and the plan of organization of\r\n'attractive industry.'\r\n\r\n\"His ideal of the future state of society reminds us of the\r\nSaint-Simonian government of scientists. The administration of affairs\r\nof the entire globe is to be in the hands of the three greatest\r\nauthorities on 'philosophical medicine,' physics, and mechanics, who are\r\nto be reenforced by a number of subordinate committees. His state of the\r\nfuture is a highly centralized government, and is described by the\r\nauthor with the customary details. Where Weitling, to some extent,\r\napproaches the conception of modern Socialism, is in his recognition of\r\nclass distinctions between employer and employee. This distinction never\r\namounted to a conscious indorsement of the modern Socialist doctrine of\r\nthe 'class struggle,' but his views on the antagonism between the 'poor'\r\nand the 'wealthy' came quite close to it. He was a firm believer in\r\nlabor organizations as a factor in developing the administrative\r\nabilities of the working class; the creation of an independent labor\r\nparty was one of his pet schemes, and his appeals were principally\r\naddressed to the workingmen.\"\r\n\r\nWeitling visited the United States in 1846, a group of German exiles,\r\nidentified with the Free Soil movement, having invited him to become the\r\neditor of a magazine, the _Volkstribun_, devoted to the principles of\r\nthe movement. By the time he reached America, however, the magazine had\r\nsuspended publication. He stayed little more than a year, hastening back\r\nto the fatherland to share in the revolutionary activities of 1848. He\r\nreturned to America again in 1849, after the failure of the \"glorious\r\nrevolution,\" and for many years thereafter was an active and tireless\r\npropagandist. He died in Brooklyn in 1871.\r\n\r\nEtienne Cabet was, in many ways, a very different type of man from\r\nWeitling, but their ideas were not so dissimilar. Cabet, born in Dijon,\r\nFrance, in 1788, was the son of a fairly prosperous cooper, and received\r\na good university education. He studied both medicine and law, adopting\r\nthe profession of the latter and early achieving marked success in its\r\npractice. He took a leading part in the Revolution of 1830 as a member\r\nof the \"Committee of Insurrection,\" and upon the accession of Louis\r\nPhilippe was \"rewarded\" by being made Attorney-General for Corsica.\r\nThere is no doubt that the government desired to remove Cabet from the\r\npolitical life of Paris, quite as much as to reward him for his services\r\nduring the Revolution; his strong radicalism, combined with his sturdy\r\nindependence of character, being rightly regarded as dangerous to Louis\r\nPhilippe's regime. His reward, therefore, took the form of practical\r\nbanishment. The wily advisers of Louis Philippe used the gloved hand.\r\nBut the best-laid schemes of mice and courtiers \"gang aft agley.\" Cabet,\r\nin Corsica, joined the radical anti-administration forces, and became a\r\nthorn in the side of the government. Removed from office, he returned to\r\nParis, whereupon the citizens of Dijon, his native town, elected him as\r\ntheir deputy to the lower chamber in 1834. Here he continued his\r\nopposition to the administration, and was at last tried on a charge of\r\n_lese majeste_, and given the option of choosing between two years'\r\nimprisonment and five years' exile.\r\n\r\nCabet chose exile, and took up his residence in England, where he fell\r\nunder the influence of Owen's agitation and became a convert to his\r\nSocialistic views. During this time of exile, too, he became acquainted\r\nwith the \"Utopia\" of Sir Thomas More and was fascinated by it. The idea\r\nof writing a similar work of fiction to propagate his Socialist belief\r\nimpressed itself upon his mind, and he wrote \"a philosophical and social\r\nromance,\" entitled \"Voyage to Icaria,\" which was published soon after\r\nhis return to Paris, in 1839. In this novel Cabet follows closely the\r\nmethod of More, and describes \"Icaria\" as \"a Promised Land, an Eden, an\r\nElysium, a new terrestrial Paradise.\" The plot of the book is simple in\r\nthe extreme, and its literary merit is not very great. The writer\r\nrepresents that he met, in London, a nobleman, Lord William Carisdall,\r\nwho, having by chance heard of Icaria and the wonderful and strange\r\ncustoms and form of government of its inhabitants, visited the country.\r\nLord William kept a diary in which he described all that he saw in this\r\nwonderland. This record, we are told, the traveler had permitted to be\r\npublished through the medium of his friend, and under his editorial\r\nsupervision. The first part of the book contains an attractive account\r\nof the cooeperative system of the Icarians, their communistic government,\r\nequality of the sexes, and high standard of morality. The second part is\r\ndevoted to an account of the history of Icaria, prior to and succeeding\r\nthe revolution of 1782, when the great national hero, Icar, established\r\nCommunism.\r\n\r\nThe book created a tremendous furore in France. It appealed strongly to\r\nthe discontented masses, and it is said that by 1847 Cabet had no less\r\nthan four hundred thousand adherents among the workers of France. The\r\nnumerical strength of revolutionary movements is almost invariably\r\ngreatly exaggerated, however, and it is not likely that the figures\r\ncited are exceptional in this regard. It is possible, _cum grano\r\nsalis_, to accept the figures only by remembering that a very\r\ninfinitesimal proportion of these were adherents in the sense of being\r\nready to follow Cabet's leadership, as subsequent events showed. When\r\nthe clamor rose for a practical test of the theories set forth so\r\nalluringly, Cabet visited Robert Owen in England and sought advice as to\r\nthe best site for such an experiment. Owen recommended Texas, then\r\nrecently admitted into the union of states and anxious for settlers.\r\nCabet accepted Owen's advice and called for volunteers to form the\r\n\"advance guard\" of settlers, the number responding being pitifully,\r\nalmost ludicrously, small. Still, the effect of the book was very great,\r\nand it served to fire the flagging zeal of those workers for social\r\nregeneration whose hearts must otherwise have become deadly sick from\r\nlong-deferred hopes.\r\n\r\nThe confluence of these two streams of Communist propaganda represented\r\nby Weitling and Cabet constituted the real Communist \"movement\" of\r\n1840-1847. Its organized expression was the Communist League, a secret\r\norganization with its headquarters in London. The League was formed in\r\nParis by German refugees and traveling workmen, and seems to have been\r\nan offspring of Mazzini's \"Young Europe\" agitation of 1834. At different\r\ntimes it bore the names, \"League of the Just,\" \"League of the\r\nRighteous,\" and, finally, \"Communist League.\"[44] For many years it\r\nremained a mere conspiratory society, exclusively German, and existed\r\nmainly for the purpose of fostering the \"Young Germany\" ideas. Later it\r\nbecame an International Alliance with societies in many parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 Karl Marx was residing in Brussels. During a prior residence in\r\nParis he had come into close association with the leaders of the League\r\nthere, and had agreed to form a similar society in Brussels. Engels was\r\nin Paris in 1847, and it was probably due to his activities that the\r\nParis League officially invited both him and Marx to join the\r\ninternational organization, promising that a congress should be convened\r\nin London at an early date. We may, in view of the after career of\r\nEngels as the politician of the movement, surmise so much. Be that how\r\nit may, the invitation, with its promise to call a congress in London,\r\nwas extended and accepted. The reason for the step, the object of the\r\nproposed congress, is quite clear. Marx himself has placed it beyond\r\ndispute. During his stay in Paris he and Engels had discussed the\r\nposition of the League with some of its leaders, and he had, later,\r\ncriticised it in the most merciless manner in some of his pamphlets.[45]\r\nMarx desired a revolutionary working class political party with a\r\ndefinite aim and policy. Those leaders of the League who agreed with him\r\nin this were the prime movers for the congress, which was held in\r\nLondon, in November, 1847.\r\n\r\nAt the congress, Marx and Engels presented their views at great length,\r\nand outlined the principles and policy which their famous pamphlet later\r\nmade familiar. Perhaps it was due to the very convincing manner in which\r\nthey argued that the emancipation of the working class must be the work\r\nof that class itself, that there was some opposition to them, on the\r\npart of a few delegates, on the ground that they were \"Intellectuals\"\r\nand not members of the proletariat, a criticism which pursued them all\r\nthrough their lives. Their views found general favor, however, as might\r\nbe expected from such an inchoate mass of men, revolutionaries to the\r\ncore, and waiting only for effective leadership. A resolution was\r\nadopted requesting Marx and Engels to prepare \"a complete theoretical\r\nand working programme\" for the League. This they did. It took the form\r\nof the _Communist Manifesto_, published in the early part of January,\r\n1848.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe authors of the _Manifesto_ were men of great intellectual gifts.\r\nEither of them alone must have won fame; together, they won immortality.\r\nTheir lives, from the date of their first meeting in Paris, in 1844, to\r\nthe death of Marx, almost forty years later, are inseparably interwoven.\r\nThe friendship of Damon and Pythias was not more remarkable.\r\n\r\nKarl Heinrich Marx was born on the fifth day of May, 1818, at Treves,\r\nthe oldest town in Germany, dating back to Roman times. His parents were\r\nboth people of remarkable character. His mother--_nee_ Pressburg--was\r\nthe descendant of Hungarian Jews who in the sixteenth century had\r\nsettled in Holland. Many of her ancestors had been rabbis. Marx was\r\npassionately devoted to his mother, always speaking of her with reverent\r\nadmiration. On his father's side, also, Marx boasted of a long line of\r\nrabbinical ancestors, and it has been suggested that he owed to this\r\nrabbinical ancestry some of his marvelous gift of luminous exposition.\r\nThe true family name was Mordechia, but that was abandoned by his\r\ngrandfather, who took the name of Marx, which the grandson was destined\r\nto make famous. The father of Karl was a lawyer of some prominence and\r\nconsiderable learning, and a man of great force of character. In 1824,\r\nthe boy Karl being then six years old, he renounced the Jewish religion\r\nand embraced Christianity, all the members of the family being baptized\r\nand received into the Church.\r\n\r\nThere is a familiar legend that this act was the result of compulsion,\r\nbeing taken in response to an official edict.[46] He held at the time\r\nthe position of notary public at the county court, and it is claimed\r\nthat the official edict in question required all Jews holding official\r\npositions to forego them, and to abandon the practice of law, or to\r\naccept the Christian faith. Many writers, including Liebknecht[47] and\r\none of the daughters of Karl Marx,[48] have given this explanation of\r\nthe renunciation of Judaism by the elder Marx. It seems certain,\r\nhowever, that the act was purely voluntary, and that there was no such\r\nedict.[49] It may be that social ambitions had something to do with it,\r\nthat he hoped to attain, as a Christian, a measure of success not\r\npossible to an adherent of the Hebrew faith. Whatever the motive, the\r\nact was a voluntary one. A great admirer of the eighteenth-century\r\n\"materialists,\" and a disciple of Voltaire, he believed in God, he said,\r\nas Newton, Locke, and Leibnitz had done before him. He discussed\r\nreligious and philosophical questions very freely and frankly with his\r\nson, and read Voltaire and Racine with him. As for the mother of Marx,\r\nshe also believed in God--\"not for God's sake, but for my own,\" she\r\nexplained when asked about it.\r\n\r\nAt the earnest behest of his father, Marx studied law at the\r\nuniversities of Bonn, Berlin, and Jena. But \"to please himself\" he\r\nstudied history and philosophy, winning great distinction in these\r\nbranches of learning. He graduated in 1841, as a Doctor of Philosophy,\r\nwith an essay on the philosophy of Epicurus, and it was his purpose to\r\nsettle at Bonn as a professor of philosophy. The plan was abandoned,\r\npartly because he had already discovered that his bent was toward\r\npolitical activity, and partly because the Prussian government had made\r\nscholastic independence impossible, thus destroying the attractiveness\r\nof an academic career. Accordingly, Marx accepted the editorship of a\r\ndemocratic paper, the _Rhenish Gazette_, in which he waged bitter,\r\nrelentless war upon the government. Time after time the censors\r\ninterfered, but Marx was too brilliant a polemicist, even thus early in\r\nhis career, and far too subtle for the censors. Finally, at the request\r\nof his managers, who hoped thus to avoid being compelled to suspend the\r\npublication, Marx retired from the editorship. This did not serve to\r\nsave the paper, however, and it was suppressed by the government in\r\nMarch, 1843.\r\n\r\nSoon after this Marx went to Paris, with his young bride of a few\r\nmonths, Jenny von Westphalen, the playmate of his childhood. The Von\r\nWestphalens were of the nobility, and a brother of Mrs. Marx afterward\r\nbecame a Prussian Minister of State. The elder Von Westphalen was half\r\nScotch, related, on his maternal side, to the Argyles. He was a lineal\r\ndescendant of the Duke of Argyle who was beheaded in the reign of James\r\nII. His daughter tells an amusing story of how Marx, many years later,\r\nhaving to pawn some of his wife's heirlooms, especially some heavy,\r\nantique silver spoons which bore the Argyle crest and motto, \"Truth is\r\nmy maxim,\" narrowly escaped arrest on suspicion of having robbed the\r\nArgyles![50] To Paris, then, Marx went, and there met, among others,\r\nHeinrich Heine, many of whose poems he suggested, Arnold Ruge, the poet,\r\nP. J. Proudhon, and Michael Bakunin, the Anarchist philosopher, and,\r\nabove all, the man destined to be his very _alter ego_, Friedrich\r\nEngels, with whom he had already had some correspondence.[51]\r\n\r\nThe attainments of Engels have been somewhat overshadowed by those of\r\nhis friend. Born at Barmen, in the province of the Rhine, November 28,\r\n1820, he was educated in the gymnasium of that city, and after serving\r\nhis period of military service, from 1837 to 1841, was sent, in the\r\nearly part of 1842, to Manchester, England, to look after a\r\ncotton-spinning business of which his father was principal owner. Here\r\nhe seems to have at once begun a thorough investigation of social and\r\nindustrial conditions, the results of which are contained in a book,\r\n\"The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844,\" which remains\r\nto this day a classic presentation of the social and industrial life of\r\nthe period. From the very first, already predisposed, as we know, he\r\nsympathized with the views of the Chartists and the Owenite Socialists.\r\nHe became friendly with the Chartist leaders, notably with Feargus\r\nO'Connor, to whose paper, the _Northern Star_, he became a contributor.\r\nHe also became friendly with Robert Owen, and wrote for his _New Moral\r\nWorld_.[52] His linguistic abilities were very great; it is said that he\r\nhad thoroughly mastered no less than ten languages--a gift which helped\r\nhim immensely in his literary and political associations with Marx.\r\n\r\nWhen the two men met for the first time, in 1844, they were drawn\r\ntogether by an irresistible impulse. They were kindred spirits. Marx had\r\ngone to Paris mainly for the purpose of studying the Socialist movement\r\nof the time. During his editorship of the _Rhenish Gazette_ several\r\narticles had appeared on the subject, and he had refused to attack the\r\nSocialists in any manner. He had gone to Paris with a considerable\r\nreputation already established as a leader of radical thought, and at\r\nonce sought out the Saint-Simonians, under whose influence he was led to\r\ndeclare himself definitely a Socialist. At first this seems difficult to\r\nexplain, so wide is the chasm which yawns between the \"New Christianity\"\r\nof Saint-Simon and the materialism of Marx. There seems to be no bond of\r\nsympathy between the religious mysticism of the French dreamer and the\r\nscientific thought of the German economist and philosopher.\r\n\r\nMarx has been described as being \"rigidly mathematical,\"[53] and the\r\npicture of the man one gets from his writings is that of a cold,\r\nunemotional philosopher, dealing only with facts and caring nothing for\r\nidealism. But the real Marx was a very different sort of man. His life\r\nwas itself a splendid example of noble idealism, and underlying all his\r\nmaterialism there was a great religious spirit, using the word\r\n\"religious\" in its noblest and best sense, quite independent of dogmatic\r\ntheology. All his life he was a deep student of Dante, the _Divine\r\nComedy_ being his constant companion, so that he knew it almost\r\ncompletely by heart. Some of his attacks upon Christianity are very\r\nbitter, and have been much quoted against Socialism, but they are not\r\none whit more bitter than the superb thunderbolts of invective which\r\nthe ancient Hebrew prophets hurled against an unfaithful Church and\r\npriesthood. For the most part, they are attacks upon religious hypocrisy\r\nrather than upon Christianity. Marx was, of course, an agnostic, even an\r\natheist, but he was full of sympathy with the underlying ethical\r\nprinciples of all the great religions. Always tolerant of the religious\r\nopinions of others, he had nothing but scorn and contempt for the\r\nblatant dogmatic atheism of his time, and vigorously opposed committing\r\nthe Socialist movement to atheism as part of its programme.[54] In\r\nshort, he was a man of fine spiritual instincts, splendidly religious in\r\nhis irreligion.\r\n\r\nThis spiritual side of Marx must be considered if we would understand\r\nthe man. It is not necessary, however, to ascribe the influence of\r\nSaint-Simonian thought upon him to a predisposing spiritual temperament.\r\nMarx, with his usual penetration, saw in Saint-Simonism the hidden germ\r\nof a great truth, the embryo of a profound social theory. Saint-Simon,\r\nas we have seen, had vaguely indicated the two ideas which were\r\nafterward to be cardinal doctrines of the Marx-Engels _Manifesto_--the\r\nantagonism of classes, and the economic foundation of political\r\ninstitutions. Not only so, but Saint-Simon's grasp of political\r\nquestions, instanced by his advocacy, in 1815, of a triple alliance\r\nbetween England, France, and Germany,[55] appealed to Marx, and\r\nimpressed him alike by its fine perspicacity and its splendid courage.\r\nEngels, in whom, as stated, the working-class spirit of Chartism and\r\nthe ideals of Owenism were blended, found in Marx a twin spirit. They\r\nwere, indeed,--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Two souls with but a single thought,\r\n     Two hearts that beat as one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe _Communist Manifesto_ is the first declaration of an International\r\nWorkingmen's Party. Its fine peroration is a call to the workers to\r\ntranscend the petty divisions of nationalism and sectarianism: \"The\r\nproletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to\r\nwin. Workingmen of all countries, unite!\" These concluding phrases of\r\nthe _Manifesto_ have become the shibboleths of millions. They are\r\nrepeated with fervor by the disinherited workers of all the lands. Even\r\nin China, lately so rudely awakened from the slumbering peace of the\r\ncenturies, they are voiced by an ever increasing army of voices. No\r\nsentences ever coined in the mint of human speech have held such magic\r\npower over such large numbers of men and women of so many diverse races\r\nand creeds. As a literary production, the _Manifesto_ bears the\r\nunmistakable stamp of genius.\r\n\r\nBut it is not as literature that we are to consider the historic\r\ndocument. Its importance for us lies, not in its form, but in its\r\nfundamental principle. And the fundamental principle, the essence or\r\nsoul of the declaration, is contained in this pregnant summary by\r\nEngels:--\r\n\r\n\"In every historical epoch, the prevailing mode of economic production\r\nand exchange, and the _social organization necessarily following from\r\nit, form the basis upon which is built up, and from which alone can be\r\nexplained, the political and intellectual history of that epoch_, that\r\nconsequently the whole history of mankind (since primitive tribal\r\nsociety holding land in common ownership) has been a history of class\r\nstruggles, contests between exploiting and exploited, ruling and\r\noppressed classes.\"[56]\r\n\r\nThus Engels summarizes the philosophy--as apart from the proposals of\r\nimmediate measures to constitute the political programme of the\r\nparty--of the _Manifesto_; the basis upon which the whole superstructure\r\nof modern, scientific Socialist theory rests. This is the materialistic,\r\nor economic, conception of history which distinguishes scientific\r\nSocialism from all the Utopian Socialisms which preceded it. Socialism\r\nis henceforth a theory of social evolution, not a scheme of\r\nworld-building; a spirit, not a thing. Thus, twelve years before the\r\nappearance of \"The Origin of Species,\" nearly twenty years after the\r\ndeath of Lamarck, the authors of the _Communist Manifesto_ formulated a\r\ngreat theory of social evolution as the basis of the mightiest\r\nproletarian movement in history. Socialism had become a science instead\r\nof a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nNaturally, in view of its historic role, the joint authorship of the\r\n_Manifesto_ has been much discussed. What was the respective share of\r\neach of its creators? What did Marx contribute, and what Engels? It may\r\nbe, as Liebknecht says, an idle question, but it is a perfectly natural\r\none. The pamphlet itself does not assist us. There are no internal signs\r\npointing now to the hand of the one, now to the hand of the other. We\r\nmay hazard a guess that most of the programme of ameliorative measures\r\nwas the work of Engels, and perhaps the final section. It was the work\r\nof Engels throughout his life to deal with present social and political\r\nproblems in the light of the fundamental theories to the systematization\r\nand elucidation of which Marx was devoted.\r\n\r\nBeyond this mere conjecture, we have the word of Engels with regard to\r\nthe basal principle which he has summarized in the passage already\r\nquoted. \"The _Manifesto_ being our joint production,\" he says, \"I\r\nconsider myself bound to state that the fundamental proposition which\r\nforms its nucleus belongs to Marx.... This proposition, which, in my\r\nopinion, is destined to do for history what Darwin's theory has done\r\nfor biology, we, both of us, had been gradually approaching for some\r\nyears before 1845. How far I had progressed toward it is best shown by\r\nmy 'Condition of the Working Class in England.'[57] But when I again met\r\nMarx at Brussels, in spring, 1845, he had it ready worked out, and put\r\nit before me in terms almost as clear as those in which I have stated it\r\nhere.\"[58]\r\n\r\nEngels has lifted the veil thus far, but the rest is hidden. Perhaps it\r\nis well that it should be; well that no man should be able to say which\r\npassages came from the mind of Marx and which from the mind of Engels.\r\nIn life they were inseparable, and so they must be in the Valhalla of\r\nhistory. The greatest political pamphlet of all time must forever bear,\r\nwith equal honor, the names of both. Their noble friendship unites them\r\neven beyond the tomb.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Twin Titans! Whom defeat ne'er bowed,\r\n     Scarce breathing from the fray,\r\n     Again they sound the war cry loud,\r\n     Again is riven Labor's shroud,\r\n     And life breathed in the clay.\r\n     Their work? Look round--see Freedom proud\r\n     And confident to-day.\"[59]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] Cf. _Social Democracy Red Book_, edited by Frederic Heath (1900),\r\npage 79.\r\n\r\n[43] _History of Socialism in the United States_, by Morris Hillquit,\r\npages 161-162.\r\n\r\n[44] E.

The first plank\r\nin the programme of the \"Alliance\" was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The Alliance declares itself Atheist; it demands the abolition of all\r\nworship, the substitution of science for faith, and of human justice for\r\nDivine justice; the abolition of marriage, so far as it is a political,\r\nreligious, juridical, or civil institution.\"\r\n\r\nThis programme is frequently quoted against the Socialist\r\npropaganda,--as, for example, by George Brooks, in _God's England or the\r\nDevil's_?--in spite of the fact that the \"Alliance\" was an Anarchist\r\norganization, bitterly opposed by Marx, and, in turn, bitterly opposing\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, it may be well to call attention to an alleged\r\n\"quotation from Marx\" which is frequently used by the opponents of\r\nSocialism. It appears in the work of Brooks, quoted above, and in\r\nProfessor Peabody's _Jesus Christ and the Social Question_ (1907), page\r\n16. Used in a public discussion by a New York labor union official, in\r\nApril, 1908, it was widely discussed by the press, and, according to\r\nthat same press, drew from the President of the United States\r\nenthusiastic praise of the labor-union official in question. The passage\r\nreads: \"The idea of God must be destroyed. It is the keystone of a\r\nperverted civilization. The true root of liberty, of equality, of\r\nculture, is Atheism. Nothing must restrain the spontaneity of the human\r\nmind.\" Had the opponents of Socialism been familiar with the teachings\r\nof Marx, they would have known that he could not have said anything like\r\nthis, that it is absolutely at variance with all his teaching. The man\r\nwho formulated the materialist conception of history could not by any\r\npossibility utter such balderdash. The fact is, the quotation is not\r\nfrom Karl Marx at all, but from a very different writer, an Anarchist,\r\nWilhelm Marr, who was _a most bitter opponent of Socialism_. As given,\r\nthe quotation is a free translation of a passage contained in Marr's\r\n_Das junge Deutschland in der Schweiz_, pages 131-134. Marr's programme,\r\nas given in the _Report of the Royal Commission on Labor_ (Vol. V,\r\nGermany), was the abolition of Church, State, property, and marriage,\r\nwith the one positive tenet of \"a bloody and fearful revenge upon the\r\nrich and powerful.\"\r\n\r\n[55] See F.

Its hopes for the future rest, not upon the genius of some\r\nUtopia-builder, but upon the inherent forces of historical development.\r\nThe Socialist state will never be realized except as the result of\r\neconomic necessity, the culmination of successive epochs of industrial\r\nevolution. Thus the existing social system appears to the Socialist of\r\nto-day, not as it appeared to the Utopians and as it still must appear\r\nto mere ideologist reformers, as a triumph of ignorance or wickedness,\r\nthe reign of false _ideas_, but as the result of an age-long\r\nevolutionary process, determined, not wholly indeed, but mainly, by\r\ncertain methods of producing the necessities of life in the first place,\r\nand secondly, of effecting their exchange.\r\n\r\nNot, let it be understood, that Socialism has become a mere mechanical\r\ntheory of economic fatalism. The historical development, the social\r\nevolution, upon the laws of which the theories of Socialism are based,\r\nis a human process, involving all the complex feelings, emotions,\r\naspirations, hopes, and fears common to man. To ignore this fundamental\r\nfact, as they must who interpret the Marx-Engels theory of history as a\r\ndoctrine of economic fatalism, is to miss the profoundest significance\r\nof the theory. While it is true that the scientific spirit destroys the\r\nidea of romantic, magic transformations of the social system and the\r\nbelief that the world may be re-created at will, rebuilt upon the plans\r\nof some Utopian architect, it still, as we shall see, leaves room for\r\nthe human factor. Otherwise, indeed, it would only be a new kind of\r\nUtopianism. They who accept the theory that the production of the\r\nmaterial necessities of life is the main impelling force, the _geist_,\r\nof human evolution, may rightly protest against social injustice and\r\nwrong just as vehemently as any of the ideologists, and aspire just as\r\nfervently toward a nobler and better state. The Materialistic Conception\r\nof History does not involve the fatalist resignation summed up in the\r\nphrase, \"Whatever is, is natural, and, therefore, right.\" It does not\r\ninvolve belief in man's helplessness to change conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe idea of social evolution is admirably expressed in the fine phrase\r\nof Leibnitz, \"The present is the child of the past, but it is the parent\r\nof the future.\"[60] The great seventeenth-century philosopher was not\r\nthe first to postulate and apply to society that doctrine of flux, of\r\ncontinuity and unity, which we call evolution. In all ages of which\r\nrecord has been preserved to us, it has been sporadically, and more or\r\nless vaguely, expressed. Even savages seem to have dimly perceived it.\r\nThe saying of the Bechuana chief, recorded by the missionary, Casalis,\r\nwas probably, judging by its epigrammatic character, a proverb of his\r\npeople. \"One event is always the son of another,\" he said--a saying\r\nstrikingly like that of Leibnitz.\r\n\r\nSince the work of Lyell, Darwin, Wallace, Spencer, Huxley, Youmans, and\r\ntheir numerous followers--a brilliant school embracing the foremost\r\nhistorians and sociologists of Europe and America--the idea of evolution\r\nas a universal law has made rapid and certain progress. Everything\r\nchanges; nothing is immutable or eternal. Whatever is, whether in\r\ngeology, astronomy, biology, or sociology, is the result of numberless,\r\ninevitable, related changes. Only the law of change is changeless. The\r\npresent is a phase only of a great transition process from what was,\r\nthrough what is, to what will be.\r\n\r\nThe Marx-Engels theory is an exploration of the laws governing this\r\nprocess of evolution in the domain of human relations: an attempt to\r\nprovide a key to the hitherto mysterious succession of changes in the\r\npolitical, juridical, and social relations and institutions of mankind.\r\nWhence, for instance, arose the institution of chattel slavery, so\r\nrepugnant to our modern ideas of right and wrong, and how shall we\r\nexplain its defense and justification in the name of religion and\r\nmorality? How account for the fact that what Yesterday regarded as\r\nrighteous, To-day condemns as wrong; that what at one period of the\r\nworld's history is regarded as perfectly natural and right--the practice\r\nof polygamy, for example--becomes abhorrent at another period; or that\r\nwhat is regarded with horror and disgust in one part of the world is\r\nsanctioned by the ethical codes, and freely practiced elsewhere? Ferri\r\ngives two examples of this kind: the cannibalism of Central African\r\ntribes, and the killing of parents, as a religious duty, in Sumatra.[61]\r\nTo reply \"custom\" is to beg the whole question, for customs do not exist\r\nwithout reason, however difficult it may be to discern the reason for\r\nany particular custom. To reply that these things are mysteries, as the\r\nold theologians did when the doctrine of the Trinity was questioned, is\r\nto leave the question unanswered and to challenge doubt and\r\ninvestigation. The human mind abhors a mystery as nature abhors a\r\nvacuum. Despite Spencer, the human mind has never admitted the existence\r\nof the _Unknowable_. To explore the _Unknown_ is man's universal\r\nimpulse; and with each fresh discovery the _Unknown_ is narrowed by the\r\nexpansion of the _Known_.\r\n\r\nThe theory that ideas determine progress, that, in the words of\r\nProfessor Richard T. Ely, \"all that is significant in human history may\r\nbe traced back to ideas,\"[62] is only true in the sense that a half\r\ntruth is true. It is true, nothing but the truth, but it is less than\r\nthe whole truth. Truly all that is significant in human history may be\r\ntraced back to ideas, but in like manner the ideas themselves can be\r\ntraced back to material sources. For ideas have histories, too, and the\r\ncausation of an idea must be understood before the idea itself can serve\r\nfully to explain anything. We must go back of the idea to the causes\r\nwhich gave it birth if we would interpret anything by it. We may trace\r\nthe American Revolution, for example, back to the revolutionary ideas of\r\nthe colonists, but that will not materially assist us to understand the\r\nRevolution. For that, it is necessary to trace the ideas themselves to\r\ntheir source, the economic discontent of an exploited people. This is\r\nthe spirit which illumines the works of historians like Green, McMaster,\r\nMorse Stephens, and others of the modern school, who emphasize social\r\nforces rather than individual facts, and find the _geist_ of history in\r\nsocial experiences and institutions.\r\n\r\nWhat has been called the \"Great Man theory,\" the theory according to\r\nwhich Luther created the Protestant Reformation, to quote only one\r\nexample, and which ignored the great economic changes consequent upon\r\nthe break-up of feudalism and the rise of a new industrial order, long\r\ndominated our histories. According to this theory, an idea, developed in\r\nthe mind of Luther, independent of external circumstances, changed the\r\npolitical and social life of Europe. Had there been no Luther, there\r\nwould have been no Reformation; or had Luther died before giving his\r\nidea to the world, the Reformation would have been averted. The student\r\nwho seeks in the bulk of the histories written prior to, say, 1870, what\r\nhe has a legitimate reason for seeking, namely, a picture of the actual\r\nlife of the people at any period, will be sadly disappointed. He will\r\nfind records of wars and treaties of peace, royal genealogies and\r\ngossip, wildernesses of names and dates. But he will not find such\r\ncareful accounts of the jurisprudence of the period, nor any hint of the\r\neconomical conditions of its development. He will find splendid accounts\r\nof court life, with its ceremonials, scandals, intrigues, and follies;\r\nbut no such pictures of the lives of the people, their social\r\nconditions, and the methods of labor and commerce which obtained. He\r\nwill be unable to visualize the life of the period. In other words, the\r\nhistories lack realism; they are unreal, and, therefore, deceptive. The\r\nnew spirit, in the development of which the materialist conception of\r\nMarx and Engels has been an important creative influence, is concerned\r\nless with the chronicle of notable events and dates than with their\r\nunderlying causes and the manner of life of the people. Had it no other\r\nbearing, the Marx-Engels theory, considered solely as a contribution to\r\nthe science of history, would have been one of the greatest intellectual\r\nachievements of the nineteenth century. By emphasizing the importance of\r\nthe economic factors in social evolution, it has done much for economics\r\nand more for history.[63]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWhile the Materialistic Conception of History bears the names of Marx\r\nand Engels, as the theory of organic evolution bears the names of Darwin\r\nand Wallace, it is not claimed that the idea had never before been\r\nexpressed. Just as thousands of years before Darwin and Wallace the\r\ntheory which bears their names had been dimly perceived, so the idea\r\nthat economic conditions dominate historical developments had its\r\nforeshadowings. The famous dictum of Aristotle, that only by the\r\nintroduction of machines would the abolition of slavery ever be made\r\npossible, is a conspicuous example of many anticipations of the theory.\r\nIt is true that \"In dealing with speculations so remote, we have to\r\nguard against reading modern meanings into writings produced in ages\r\nwhose limitations of knowledge were serious, whose temper and standpoint\r\nare wholly alien to our own,\"[64] but the Aristotelian saying admits of\r\nno other interpretation. It is clearly a recognition of the fact that\r\nthe supreme politico-social institution of the time depended upon hand\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nIn later times, the idea of a direct connection between economic\r\nconditions and legal and political institutions reappears in the works\r\nof various writers. Professor Seligman[65] quotes from Harrington's\r\n\"Oceana\" the argument that the prevailing form of government depends\r\nupon the conditions of land tenure, and the extent of its\r\nmonopolization. Saint-Simon, too, as already stated, taught that\r\npolitical institutions depend upon economic conditions. But it is to\r\nMarx and Engels that we owe the first formulation into a definite theory\r\nof what had hitherto been but a suggestion, and the beginnings of a\r\nliterature, now of considerable proportions, dealing with history from\r\nits standpoint. No more need be said concerning the \"originality\" of the\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nA word as to the designation of the theory. Its authors gave it the name\r\n\"historical materialism,\" and it has been urged that the name is, for\r\nmany reasons, unfortunately chosen. Two of the leading exponents of the\r\ntheory, Professor Seligman and Mr. Ghent, the former an opponent, the\r\nlatter an advocate of Socialism, have expressed this conviction in very\r\ndefinite terms. The last-named writer bases his objection to the name on\r\nthe ground that it is repellent to many persons who associate the word\r\nmaterialism with the philosophy \"that matter is the only substance, and\r\nthat matter and its motions constitute the universe.\"[66] That is an old\r\nobjection, and undoubtedly contains much truth. It is interesting in\r\nconnection therewith to read the sarcastic comment of Engels upon it in\r\nthe introduction to his \"Socialism, Utopian and Scientific.\" The\r\nobjection of Professor Seligman is based upon another ground entirely.\r\nHe impugns its accuracy. \"The theory which ascribes all changes in\r\nsociety to the influence of climate, or to the character of the fauna\r\nand flora, is materialistic,\" he says, \"and yet has little in common\r\nwith the doctrine here discussed. The doctrine we have to deal with is\r\nnot only materialistic, but also economic in character; and the better\r\nphrase is ... the 'economic interpretation' of history.\"[67] For this\r\nreason he discards the name given to the theory by its authors and\r\nadopts the luminous phrase of Thorold Rogers, without credit to that\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\nBy French and Italian writers the term \"economic determinism\" has long\r\nbeen used, and it has been adopted to some extent in this country by\r\nSocialist writers. But this term, as Professor Seligman points out, is\r\nobjectionable, because it exaggerates the theory, and gives it, by\r\nimplication, a fatalistic character, conveying the idea that economic\r\ninfluence is the _sole_ determining factor--a view which its authors\r\nspecifically repudiated. While the reasoning of Professor Seligman in\r\nthe argument quoted against the name \"historical materialism\" is neither\r\nvery profound nor conclusive, since climate and fauna and flora are\r\nincluded in the term \"economic\" as clearly as in the term\r\n\"materialistic,\" much may be said in favor of his choice of the term he\r\nborrows from Thorold Rogers, and it is used by many Socialist writers in\r\npreference to that used by Marx and Engels.\r\n\r\nMany persons have doubtless been deceived into believing that the theory\r\ninvolves the denial of all influence to idealistic or spiritual factors,\r\nand the assumption that economic forces _alone_ determine the course of\r\nhistorical development. Much of the criticism of the theory, especially\r\nby the Germans, rests upon that assumption. The theory is attacked,\r\nalso, as being sordid and brutal upon the same false assumption that it\r\nimplies that men are governed solely by their economic _interests_, that\r\nindividual conduct is never inspired by anything higher than the\r\neconomic interest of the individual. These are misconceptions of the\r\ntheory, due, no doubt, to the overemphasis placed upon it by its\r\nauthors--a common experience of new doctrines--and, above all, the\r\nexaggerations of too zealous, unrestrained disciples. There is a wise\r\nsaying of Schiller's which suggests the spirit in which these\r\nexaggerations of a great truth--exaggerations by which it becomes\r\nfalsehood--should be regarded: \"Rarely do we reach truth, except through\r\nextremes--we must have foolishness ... even to exhaustion, before we\r\narrive at the beautiful goal of calm wisdom.\"[68] When it is contended\r\nthat the \"Civil War was at bottom a struggle between two economic\r\nprinciples,\"[69] we have the presentation of an important truth, the key\r\nto the proper understanding of a great historical event. But when that\r\nimportant fact is exaggerated and torn from its legitimate place to suit\r\nthe propaganda of a theory, and we are asked to believe that Garrison,\r\nLovejoy, and other abolitionists were inspired solely by economic\r\nmotives, that the urge and passion of human freedom did not enter into\r\ntheir souls, we are forced to reject it. But let it be clearly\r\nunderstood that it forms no part of the theory, that it is even\r\nexpressly denied in the very terms in which Marx and Engels formulated\r\nthe theory, and that its authors repudiated such perversions of it.\r\n\r\nIn no respect has the theory been more grossly exaggerated and\r\nmisrepresented than in its application to religion. True philosopher\r\nthat he was, Marx realized the absurdity of attempting \"to abstract\r\nreligious sentiment from the course of history, to place it by\r\nitself.\"[70] He recognized that all religion is, fundamentally, man's\r\neffort to put himself into harmonious relation with, and to discover an\r\ninterpretation of, the forces of the universe. The more incomprehensible\r\nthose forces, the greater man's need of an explanation of them. He could\r\nnot fail to see that the religion of a people always bears a marked\r\nrelation to their mental development and their special environment. He\r\nknew that at various stages the Yahve of the Hebrews represented very\r\ndifferent conceptions, answering to changes in the social and political\r\nconditions of the people. To the primitive Israelitish tribes, Yahve\r\nwas, as Professor Rauschenbusch remarks,[71] a tribal god, fortunately\r\nstronger than the gods of the neighboring tribes, but not fundamentally\r\ndifferent from them, and the way to win his favor was to sacrifice\r\nabundantly. Later, with the development of a national spirit, the\r\nreligious ideal became a theocracy, and Yahve became a King and Supreme\r\nLord. In times of oppression and war Yahve was a God of War, but under\r\nother conditions he was a God of Peace. At every step the conception of\r\nYahve bears a very definite relation to the material life.[72]\r\n\r\nMarx knew that primitive religions have often a celestial pantheon\r\nfashioned after the existing social order, kings being gods, aristocrats\r\nbeing demigods, and common mortals occupying a celestial rank equal to\r\ntheir terrestrial one. The celestial hierarchy of the Chinese, for\r\nexample, is an exact reproduction of the earthly hierarchy, and all the\r\nprivileges of rank are observed celestially as on earth. So in India we\r\nfind the religions reproducing in their concepts of heaven the degrees\r\nand divisions of the various castes,[73] while our own American Indian\r\nconceived of a celestial hunting ground, with abundant reward of game,\r\nas his Paradise. \"The religious world is but the reflex of the real\r\nworld,\" said Marx,[74] and the phrase has been used, both by disciples\r\nand critics, as an attack upon religion itself; as showing that the\r\nMarxian philosophy excludes the possibility of religious belief.\r\nObviously, however, the passage will not bear such an interpretation. To\r\nsay that \"the religious world is but the reflex of the real world\" is\r\nby no means to deny that men have been benefited by seeking an\r\ninterpretation of the forces of the universe, or to assert that the\r\nquest for such an interpretation is incompatible with rational conduct.\r\nIn his scorn for Bakunin's \"Alliance\" programme with its dogmatic\r\natheism[75] Marx was perfectly consistent. The passage quoted simply\r\nlays down, in bare outline, a principle which, if well founded, enables\r\nus to study comparative religion from a new viewpoint.\r\n\r\nIt is not a denial of religion, then, which the famous utterance of Marx\r\ninvolves, but a recognition of the fact that, even as all religions may\r\nbe traced to the same fundamental instinct in mankind, so the different\r\nforms which the religious conception assumes are, or may be, reflexes of\r\nthe material life of those making them. Thus man makes religion for\r\nhimself under the urge of his deepest instincts. The application of the\r\ntheory to religion is analogous to its application to historical events.\r\nTo say that a given religion assumes the form it does as an unconscious\r\nreflex of the environment in which it is produced, is no more a denial\r\nof that religion than to say that the Reformation arose out of economic\r\nand social conditions, and not out of an idea in Luther's mind, is a\r\ndenial of the fact that there was a Reformation, or that the\r\nReformation benefited the people. The value of the theory to the study\r\nof religions and religious movements is not less than to the study of\r\nhistory. Does anybody pretend that we can understand Christianity\r\nwithout taking into account the Roman Empire; or that we can understand\r\nCatholicism without knowing something of the economic life of medieval\r\nEurope; or Methodism without knowing the social condition of England in\r\nWesley's day?[76]\r\n\r\nIn one of the very earliest of his writings upon the subject, some\r\ncomments upon the philosophy of Ludwig Feuerbach, and intended to form\r\nthe basis of a separate work, we find Marx insisting that man is not a\r\nmere automaton, driven irresistibly by blind economic forces. He says:\r\n\"The materialistic doctrine, that men are the products of conditions and\r\neducation, different men, therefore, the products of other conditions\r\nand changed education, _forgets that circumstances may be altered by\r\nmen, and that the educator has himself to be educated_.\"[77] Thus early\r\nwe see the master taking a position entirely at variance with those of\r\nhis disciples who would claim that the human factor has no influence\r\nupon historical development, that man is without power over his own\r\ndestiny. From that position Marx never departed. Both he and Engels\r\nrecognized the human character of the problem, and the futility of\r\nattempting to reduce all the processes of history and human progress to\r\none sole basic cause. And in no case, so far as I am aware, has either\r\nof them attempted to do this.\r\n\r\nIn another place, Marx contends that \"men make their own history, but\r\nthey make it not of their own accord or under self-chosen conditions,\r\nbut under given and transmitted conditions. The tradition of all dead\r\ngenerations weighs like a mountain upon the brain of the living.\"[78]\r\nHere, again, the influence of the human will is not denied, though its\r\nlimitations are indicated. This is the application to social man of the\r\ntheory of limitations of the will commonly accepted as applying to\r\nindividuals. Man is only a freewill agent within certain sharp and\r\nrelatively narrow bounds. In a given contingency, I may be \"free\" to act\r\nin a certain manner, or to refrain from so acting. I may take my choice,\r\nin the one direction or the other, entirely free, to all appearances,\r\nfrom restraining or compelling influences. Thus, I have acted upon my\r\n\"will.\" But what factors formed my will? What circumstances determined\r\nmy decision? Perhaps fear, or shame, or pride; perhaps tendencies\r\ninherited from my ancestors.\r\n\r\nEngels admits that the economic factor in evolution has sometimes been\r\nunduly emphasized. He says: \"Marx and I are partly responsible for the\r\nfact that the younger men have sometimes laid more stress on the\r\neconomic side than it deserves. In meeting the attacks of our opponents,\r\nit was necessary for us to emphasize the dominant principle denied by\r\nthem; and we did not always have the time, place, or opportunity to let\r\nthe other factors which were concerned in the mutual action and reaction\r\nget their deserts.\"[79] In another letter,[80] he says: \"According to\r\nthe materialistic view of history, the factor which is in _last\r\ninstance_ decisive in history is the production and reproduction of\r\nactual life. More than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted. But\r\nwhen any one distorts this so as to read that the economic factor is the\r\nsole element, he converts the statement into a meaningless, abstract,\r\nabsurd phrase. The economic condition is the basis; but the various\r\nelements of the superstructure,--the political forms of the class\r\ncontests, and their results, the constitutions,--the legal forms, and\r\nalso all the reflexes of these actual contests in the brains of the\r\nparticipants, the political, legal, philosophical theories, the\r\n_religious views_ ... all these exert an influence on the development of\r\nthe historical struggles, and, in many instances, determine their form.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that the doctrine does not imply economic\r\nfatalism. It does not deny that ideals may influence historical\r\ndevelopments and individual conduct. While, as we shall see in a later\r\nchapter, it is part of the doctrine that classes are formed upon a basis\r\nof unity of material interests, it does not deny that men may, and often\r\ndo, act in accordance with the promptings of noble impulses and\r\nhumanitarian ideals, when their material interests would lead them to do\r\notherwise. We have a conspicuous example of this in the life of Marx\r\nhimself; in his splendid devotion to the cause of the workers through\r\nyears of terrible poverty and hardship when he might have chosen wealth\r\nand fame. It is known, for example, that Bismarck made the most\r\nextravagant offers to enlist the services of Marx, who declined them at\r\nthe very time when he was suffering awful privations. Marx himself has\r\nnoted more than one instance of individual idealism triumphing over\r\nmaterial interests and class environment, and, by a perversity that is\r\nastonishing, and not wholly disingenuous, some of his critics, notably\r\nLudwig Slonimski,[81] have used these instances as arguments against his\r\ntheory, claiming that they disprove it! We are to understand the\r\nmaterialistic theory, then, as teaching, not that history is determined\r\nby economic forces only, but that in human evolution the chief factors\r\nare social factors, and that these factors in turn are _mainly_ molded\r\nby economic circumstances.[82]\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the basis of the Socialist philosophy, which Engels\r\nregarded as \"destined to do for history what Darwin's theory has done\r\nfor biology.\" Marx himself made a similar comparison.[83] Marx was, so\r\nLiebknecht tells us, one of the first to recognize the importance of\r\nDarwin's investigations to sociology. His first important treatment of\r\nthe materialistic theory, in \"A Contribution to the Critique of\r\nPolitical Economy,\" appeared in 1859, the year in which \"The Origin of\r\nSpecies\" appeared. \"We spoke for months of nothing else but Darwin, and\r\nthe revolutionizing power of his scientific conquests,\"[84] says\r\nLiebknecht. Darwin, however, had little knowledge of political economy,\r\nas he acknowledged in a letter to Marx, thanking the latter for a copy\r\nof \"Das Kapital.\" \"I heartily wish that I possessed a greater knowledge\r\nof the deep and important subject of economic questions, which would\r\nmake me a more worthy recipient of your gift,\" he wrote.[85]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe test of such a theory must lie in its application. Let us, then,\r\napply the materialistic principle, first to a specific event, and then\r\nto the great sweep of the historic drama. Perhaps no single event has\r\nmore profoundly impressed the imaginations of men, or filled a more\r\nimportant place in our histories, than the discovery of America by\r\nColumbus. In the schoolbooks, this great event figures as a splendid\r\nadventure, arising out of a romantic dream. But the facts are, as we\r\nknow, far otherwise.[86] In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there\r\nwere numerous and well-frequented routes from Hindustan, that vast\r\nstorehouse of treasure from which Europe drew its riches. Along these\r\nroutes cities flourished. There were the great ports, Licia in the\r\nLevant, Trebizond on the Black Sea, and Alexandria. From these ports,\r\nVenetian and Genoese traders bore the produce over the passes of the\r\nAlps to the Upper Danube and the Rhine. Here it was a source of wealth\r\nto the cities along the waterways, from Ratisbon and Nuremburg, to\r\nBruges and Antwerp. Even the slightest acquaintance with the history of\r\nthe Middle Ages must suffice to give the student an idea of the\r\nimportance of these cities.\r\n\r\nWhen all these routes save the Egyptian were closed by the hordes of\r\nsavages which infested Central Asia, it became an easy matter for the\r\nMoors in Africa and the Turks in Europe to exact immense revenues from\r\nthe Eastern trade, solely through their monopoly of the route of\r\ntransit. Thus there developed an economic parasitism which crippled the\r\ntrade with the East. The Turks were securely seated at Constantinople,\r\nthreatening to advance into the heart of Europe, and building up an\r\nimmense military system out of the taxes imposed upon the trade of\r\nEurope with the East--a military power, which, in less than a quarter of\r\na century, enabled Selim I to conquer Mesopotamia and the holy towns of\r\nArabia, and to annex Egypt.[87] It became necessary, then, to find a new\r\nroute to India; and it was this great economic necessity which set\r\nColumbus thinking of a pathway to India over the Western Sea. It was\r\nthis same great problem which engaged the attention of all the\r\nnavigators of the time; it was this economic necessity which induced\r\nFerdinand and Isabella to support the adventurous plan of Columbus. In a\r\nword, without detracting in any manner from the splendid genius of\r\nColumbus, or from the romance of his great voyage of discovery, we see\r\nthat, fundamentally, it was the economic interest of Europe which gave\r\nbirth to the one and made the other possible. The same explanation\r\napplies to the voyage of Vasco da Gama, six years later, which resulted\r\nin finding a way to India over the southeast course by way of the Cape\r\nof Good Hope.\r\n\r\nKipling asks in his ballad, \"The British Flag\"--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"And what should they know of England, who only England know?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a profound truth in the defiant line, a truth which applies\r\nequally to America or any other country. The present is inseparable from\r\nthe past. We cannot understand one epoch without reference to its\r\npredecessors; we cannot understand the history of the United States\r\nunless we seek the key in the history of Europe--of England and France\r\nin particular. At the very threshold, in order to understand how the\r\nheroic navigator came to discover the vast continent of which the United\r\nStates is part, we must pause to study the economic conditions of Europe\r\nwhich impelled the adventurous voyage, and led to the discovery of a\r\ngreat continent stretching across the ocean path. Such a view of history\r\ndoes not rob it of its romance, but rather adds to it. Surely, the\r\nwonderful linking of circumstances--the demand for spices and silks to\r\nminister to the fine tastes of aristocratic Europe, the growth of the\r\ntrade with the East Indies, the grasping greed of Moor and Turk--all\r\nplaying a role in the great drama of which the discovery of America is\r\nbut a scene, is infinitely more fascinating than the latter event\r\ndetached from its historical setting!\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to give in the compass of a few pages an intelligent view\r\nof the main currents of history. The sketch here introduced--not without\r\nhesitation--is an endeavor to state the Socialist concept of the course\r\nof social evolution in a brief outline and to indicate the principal\r\neconomic causes which have operated to determine that course.\r\n\r\nIt is now generally admitted that primitive man lived under Communism.\r\nLewis H. Morgan[88] has calculated that if the life of the human race be\r\nassumed to have covered one hundred thousand years, at least ninety-five\r\nthousand years were spent in a crude, tribal Communism, in which private\r\nproperty was practically unknown, and in which the only ethic was\r\ndevotion to tribal interests, and the only crime antagonism to tribal\r\ninterests. Under this social system the means of making wealth were in\r\nthe hands of the tribes, or _gens_, and distribution was likewise\r\nsocially arranged. Between the different tribes warfare was constant,\r\nbut in the tribe itself there was cooeperation and not struggle. This\r\nfact is of tremendous importance in view of the criticisms which have\r\nbeen directed against the Socialist philosophy from the so-called\r\nDarwinian point of view, according to which competition and struggle is\r\nthe law of life; that what Professor Huxley calls \"the Hobbesial war of\r\neach against all\" is the normal state of existence.\r\n\r\nThis is described as \"the so-called Darwinian\" theory advisedly, for the\r\nstruggle for existence as the law of evolution has been exaggerated out\r\nof all likeness to the conception of Darwin himself. In \"The Descent of\r\nMan,\" for instance, Darwin raises the point under review, and shows how,\r\nin many animal societies, the _struggle_ for existence is replaced by\r\n_cooeperation_ for existence, and how that substitution results in the\r\ndevelopment of faculties which secure to the species the best conditions\r\nfor survival. \"Those communities,\" he says, \"which included the greatest\r\nnumber of the most sympathetic members, would flourish best and rear the\r\ngreatest number of offspring.\"[89] Despite these instances, and the\r\nwarning of Darwin himself that the term \"struggle for existence\" should\r\nnot be too narrowly interpreted or overrated, his followers, instead of\r\nbroadening it according to the master's suggestions, narrowed it still\r\nmore. Thus the theory has been exaggerated into a mere caricature of the\r\ntruth. This is almost invariably the fate of theories which deal with\r\nhuman relations, perhaps it would be equally true to say of all\r\ntheories. The exaggerations of Malthus's law of population is a case in\r\npoint. The Marx-Engels theory of the materialistic conception of history\r\nis, as we have seen, another.\r\n\r\nKropotkin, among others, has developed the theory along the lines\r\nsuggested by Darwin. He points out that \"though there is an immense\r\namount of warfare and extermination going on amidst various classes of\r\nanimals, there is, at the same time, as much, or perhaps even more, of\r\nmutual support, mutual aid, mutual defense, amidst animals belonging to\r\nthe same species or, at least, to the same society. Sociability is as\r\nmuch a law of nature as mutual struggle.... If we resort to an indirect\r\ntest, and ask nature: 'Who are the fittest: those who are continually at\r\nwar with each other, or those who support one another?' we at once see\r\nthat those animals which acquire habits of mutual aid are undoubtedly\r\nthe fittest. They have more chances to survive, and they attain, in\r\ntheir respective classes, the highest development of intelligence and\r\nbodily organization. If the numberless facts which can be brought\r\nforward to support this view are taken into account, we may safely say\r\nthat mutual aid is as much a law of animal life as mutual struggle, but\r\nthat, as a factor of evolution, it most probably has a far greater\r\nimportance, inasmuch as it favors the development of such habits and\r\ncharacters as insure the maintenance and further development of the\r\nspecies, together with the greatest amount of welfare and enjoyment of\r\nlife for the individual, with the least waste of energy.\"[90]\r\n\r\nFrom the lowest forms of animal life up to the highest, man, this law\r\nproves to be operative. It is not denied that there is competition for\r\nfood, for life, within the species, human and other. But that\r\ncompetition is not usual; it arises out of unusual and special\r\nconditions. There are instances of hunger-maddened mothers tearing away\r\nfood from their children; men drifting at sea have fought for water and\r\nfood as beasts fight, but these are not normal conditions of life.\r\n\"Happily enough,\" says Kropotkin again, \"competition is not the rule\r\neither in the animal world or in mankind. It is limited among animals to\r\nexceptional periods.... Better conditions are created by the\r\n_elimination of competition_ by means of mutual aid and mutual\r\nsupport.\"[91] This is the voice of science now that we have passed\r\nthrough the extremes and arrived at the \"beautiful goal of calm wisdom.\"\r\nCompetition is not, in the verdict of modern science, the law of life,\r\nbut of death. Strife is not nature's way of progress.\r\n\r\nAnything more important to our present inquiry than this verdict of\r\nscience it would be difficult to imagine. Men have for so long believed\r\nand declared struggle and competition to be the \"law of nature,\" and\r\nopposed Socialism on the ground of its supposed antagonism to that law,\r\nthat this new conception of nature's method comes as a vindication of\r\nthe Socialist position. The naturalist testifies to the universality of\r\nthe principle of cooeperation throughout the animal world, and the\r\nhistorian and sociologist to its universality throughout the greatest\r\npart of man's history. Present economic tendencies toward combination\r\nand away from competition, in industry and commerce, appear as the\r\nfulfilling of a great universal law. And the vain efforts of men to stop\r\nthat process, by legislation, boycotts, and divers other methods, appear\r\nas efforts to set aside immutable law. Like so many Canutes, they bid\r\nthe tides halt, and, like Canute's, their commands are vain and mocked\r\nby the unheeding tides.\r\n\r\nUnder Communism, then, man lived for many thousands of years. As far\r\nback as we can go into the paleo-ethnology of mankind, we find evidences\r\nof this. All the great authorities, Morgan, Maine, Lubbock, Taylor,\r\nBachofen, and many others, agree in this. And under this Communism all\r\nthe great fundamental inventions were evolved, as Morgan and others have\r\nshown. The wheel, the potter's wheel, the lever, the stencil plate, the\r\nsail, the rudder, the loom, were all evolved under Communism in its\r\nvarious stages. So, too, the cultivation of cereals for food, the\r\nsmelting of metals, the domestication of animals,--to which we owe so\r\nmuch, and on which we still so largely depend,--were all introduced\r\nunder Communism. Even in our day there have been found many survivals of\r\nthis Communism among primitive peoples. Mention need only be made here\r\nof the Bantu tribes of Africa, whose splendid organization astonished\r\nthe British, and the Eskimos. It is now possible to trace with a fair\r\namount of certainty the progress of mankind through various stages of\r\nCommunism, from the unconscious Communism of the nomad to the\r\nconsciously organized and directed Communism of the most highly\r\ndeveloped tribes, right up to the threshold of civilization, when\r\nprivate property takes the place of common, tribal property, and\r\neconomic classes appear.[92]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nPrivate property, other than that personal ownership and use of things,\r\nsuch as weapons and tools, which involves no class or caste domination,\r\nand is an integral feature of all forms of Communism, first appears in\r\nthe ownership of man by man. Slavery, strange as it may seem, is\r\ndirectly traceable to tribal Communism, and first appears as a tribal\r\ninstitution. When one tribe made war upon another, its efforts were\r\ndirected to the killing of as many of its enemies as possible. Cannibal\r\ntribes killed their foes for food, rarely or never killing their\r\nfellow-tribesmen for that purpose. Non-cannibalistic tribes killed their\r\nfoes merely to get rid of them. But when the power of mankind over the\r\nforces of external nature had reached that point in its development\r\nwhere it became relatively easy for a man to produce more than was\r\nnecessary for his own maintenance, the custom arose of making captives\r\nof enemies and setting them to work. A foe captured had thus an economic\r\nvalue to the tribe. Either he could be set to work directly, his surplus\r\nproduct enriching the tribe, or he could be used to relieve some of his\r\ncaptors from other necessary duties, thus enabling them to produce more\r\nthan would otherwise be possible, the effect being the same in the end.\r\nThe property of the tribe at first, slaves become at a later stage\r\nprivate property--probably through the institution of the tribal\r\ndistribution of wealth. Cruel, revolting, and vile as slavery appears to\r\nour modern sense,--especially the earlier forms of slavery before the\r\nbody of legislation, and, not less important, sentiment, which\r\nsurrounded it later arose,--it still was a step forward, a distinct\r\nadvance upon the older customs of cannibalism and wholesale slaughter.\r\n\r\nNor was it a progressive step only on the humanitarian side. It had\r\nother, profounder consequences from the evolutionary point of view. It\r\nmade a leisure class possible, and provided the only conditions under\r\nwhich art, philosophy, and jurisprudence could be evolved. The secret of\r\nAristotle's saying, that only by the invention of machines would the\r\nabolition of slavery ever be made possible, lies in his recognition of\r\nthe fact that the labor of slaves alone made possible the devotion of a\r\nclass of men to the pursuit of knowledge instead of to the production of\r\nthe primal necessities of life. The Athens of Pericles, for example,\r\nwith all its varied forms of culture, its art and its philosophy, was a\r\nsemi-communism of a caste above, resting upon a basis of slave labor\r\nunderneath. Similar conditions prevailed in all the so-called ancient\r\ndemocracies of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe private ownership of wealth producers and their products made\r\nprivate exchange inevitable; individual ownership of land took the place\r\nof communal ownership, and a monetary system was invented. Here, then,\r\nin the private ownership of land and laborer, private production and\r\nexchange, we have the economic factors which caused the great revolts of\r\nantiquity, and led to that concentration of wealth into few hands, with\r\nits resulting mad luxury on the one hand and widespread proletarian\r\nmisery upon the other, which conspired to the overthrow of Greek and\r\nRoman civilization. The study of those relentless economic forces which\r\nled to the break-up of Roman civilization is important as showing how\r\nchattel slavery became modified and the slave to be regarded as a serf,\r\na servant bound to the soil. The lack of adequate production, the\r\ncrippling of commerce by hordes of corrupt officials, the overburdening\r\nof the agricultural estates with slaves, so that agriculture became\r\nprofitless, the crushing out of free labor by slave labor, and the rise\r\nof a wretched class of freemen proletarians, these, and other kindred\r\ncauses, led to the breaking up of the great estates; the dismissal of\r\nsuperfluous slaves, in many cases, and the partial enfranchisement of\r\nothers by making them hereditary tenants, paying a fixed share of their\r\nproduct as rent--here we have the embryonic stage of feudalism. It was a\r\nrevolution, this transformation of the social system of Rome, of\r\ninfinitely greater importance than the sporadic risings of a few\r\nthousand slaves. Yet, such is the lack of perspective which the\r\nhistorians have shown, it is given a far less important place in the\r\nhistories than the risings in question. Slavery, chattel slavery, died\r\nbecause it had ceased to be profitable; serf labor arose because it was\r\nmore profitable. Slave labor was economically impossible, and the labor\r\nof free men was morally impossible; it had, thanks to the slave system,\r\ncome to be regarded as a degradation. In the words of Engels, \"This\r\nbrought the Roman world into a blind alley from which it could not\r\nescape.... There was no other help but a complete revolution.\"[93]\r\n\r\nThe invading barbarians made the revolution complete. By the poor\r\nfreemen proletarians who had been selling their children into slavery,\r\nthe barbarians were welcomed. Misery, like opulence, has no patriotism.\r\nMany of the proletarian freemen had fled to the districts of the\r\nbarbarians, and feared nothing so much as a return to Roman rule. What,\r\nthen, should the proletariat care for the overthrow of the Roman state\r\nby the barbarians? And how much less the slaves, whose condition,\r\ngenerally speaking, could not possibly change for the worse? The free\r\nproletarian and the slave could join in saying, as men have said\r\nthousands of times in circumstances of desperation:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Our fortunes may be better; they can be no worse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nFeudalism is the essential politico-economic system of the Middle Ages.\r\nObscure as its origin is, and indefinite as the date of its first\r\nappearances, there can be no doubt whatever that the break-up of the\r\nRoman system, and the modification of the existing form of slavery,\r\nconstituted the most important of its sources. Whether, as some writers\r\nhave contended, the feudal system of land tenure and serfdom is\r\ntraceable to Asiatic origins, being adopted by the ruling class of Rome\r\nin the days of the economic disintegration of the empire, or whether it\r\nrose spontaneously out of the Roman conditions, matters little to us.\r\nWhatever its archaeological interest, it does not affect the narrower\r\nscope of our present inquiry whether economic necessity caused the\r\nadoption of an alien system of land tenure and agricultural production,\r\nor whether economic necessity caused the creation of a new system. The\r\ncentral fact is the same in either case.\r\n\r\nThat period of history which we call the Middle Ages covers a span of\r\nwell-nigh a thousand years. If we arbitrarily date its beginning from\r\nthe successful invasion of Rome by the barbarians in the early part of\r\nthe fifth century, and its ending with the final development of the\r\ncraft guilds in the middle of the fourteenth century, we have a\r\nsufficiently exact measure of the time during which feudalism developed,\r\nflourished, and declined. There are few things more difficult than the\r\nbounding of epochs in social evolution by exact dates. Just as the\r\nripening of the wheat fields comes almost imperceptibly, so that the\r\nfarmer can say when the wheat is ripe, yet cannot say when the ripening\r\noccurred, so with the epochs into which social history divides itself.\r\nThere is the unripe state and the ripe, but no chasm yawns between them;\r\nthey are merged together. We speak of the \"end\" of chattel slavery, and\r\nthe \"rise\" of feudalism, therefore, in a wide, general sense. As a\r\nmatter of fact, chattel slavery survived to some extent for centuries,\r\nexisting alongside of the new form of servitude; and its disappearance\r\ntook place, not simultaneously throughout the civilized world, but at\r\nvarying intervals. Likewise, there is a vast difference between the\r\nfirst, crude, ill-defined forms of feudalism and its subsequent\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe theory of feudalism is the \"divine right of kings.\" God is the\r\nSupreme Lord of all the earth, the kings are His vice-regents, devolving\r\ntheir authority in turn upon whomsoever they will. All land is held as\r\nbelonging to the king, God's chosen representative. He divides the realm\r\namong his barons, to rule over and defend. For this they pay tribute to\r\nthe king--military service in times of war and, at a later period,\r\nmoney. In turn, the barons divide the land among the lesser nobility,\r\nreceiving tribute from them. By these divided among the freemen, who\r\nalso pay tribute, the land is tilled by the serfs, who pay service to\r\nthe freeman, the lord of the manor. The serf pays no tribute directly to\r\nthe king, only to his liege lord; the liege lord pays to his superior,\r\nand so on, up to the king. This is the economic framework of feudalism;\r\nwith its ecclesiastical side we are not here concerned.\r\n\r\nAt the base of the whole superstructure, then, was the serf, his\r\nrelation to his lord differing only in degree, though in material\r\ndegree, from that of the chattel slave. He might be, and often was, as\r\nbrutally ill-treated as the slave before him had been; he might be\r\nill-fed and ill-housed; his wife or daughters might be ravished by his\r\nmaster or his master's sons. Yet, withal, his condition was better than\r\nthat of the slave. He could maintain his family life in an independent\r\nhousehold; he possessed some rights, chief of which perhaps was the\r\nright to labor for himself. Having his own allotment of land, he was in\r\na much larger sense a human being. Compelled to render so many days'\r\nservice to his lord, tilling the soil, clearing the forest, quarrying\r\nstone, and doing domestic work, he was permitted to devote a certain,\r\noften an equal, number of days to work for his own benefit. Not only so,\r\nbut the service the lord rendered him, in protecting him and his family\r\nfrom the lawless and violent robber hordes which infested the country,\r\nwas considerable.\r\n\r\nThe feudal estate, or manor, was an industrial whole, self-dependent,\r\nand having few essential ties binding it to the outside world. The\r\nbarons and their retainers, lords, thanes, and freemen, enjoyed a\r\ncertain rude plenty, some of the richer barons enjoying a considerable\r\namount of luxury and splendor. The _villein_ and his sons tilled the\r\nsoil, reaped the harvests, felled trees for fuel, built the houses,\r\nraised the necessary domestic animals, and killed the wild animals; his\r\nwife and daughters spun the flax, carded the wool, made the homespun\r\nclothing, brewed the mead, and gathered the grapes which they made into\r\nwine. There was little real dependence upon the outside world except\r\nfor articles of luxury.\r\n\r\nSuch was the basic economic institution of feudalism. But alongside of\r\nthe feudal estate with its serf labor, there were the free laborers, no\r\nlonger regarding labor as shameful and degrading. These free laborers\r\nwere the handicraftsmen and free peasants, the former soon organizing\r\nthemselves into guilds. There was a specialization of labor, but, as\r\nyet, little division. Each man worked at a particular craft and\r\nexchanged his individual products. The free craftsman would exchange his\r\nproduct with the free peasant, and sometimes his trade extended to the\r\nfeudal manor. The guild was at once his master and protector; rigid in\r\nits rules, strict in its surveillance of its members, it was strong and\r\neffective as a protector against the impositions and invasions of feudal\r\nbarons and their retainers. Division of labor first appears in its\r\nsimplest form, the association of independent individual workers for\r\nmutual advantage, sharing their products upon a basis of equality. This\r\nsimple cooeperation involved no fundamental, revolutionary change in\r\nsociety. That came later with the development of the workshop system,\r\nand the division of labor upon a definite, predetermined plan. Men\r\nspecialized now in the making of _parts_ of things; no man could say of\r\na finished product, \"This is _mine_, for I made it.\" Production had\r\nbecome a social function.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nAt first, in its simple beginnings, the cooeperation of many producers in\r\none great workshop did not involve any general or far-reaching changes\r\nin the system of exchange. But as the new methods spread, and it became\r\nthe custom for one or two wealthy individuals to provide the workshop\r\nand necessary tools and materials for production, the product of the\r\ncombined laborers being appropriated in its entirety by the owners of\r\nthe agencies of production, who paid the workers a money wage\r\nrepresenting less than the actual value of their product, and based upon\r\nthe cost of their subsistence, the whole economic system was once more\r\nrevolutionized. The custom of working for wages, hitherto rare and\r\nexceptional, became general and customary; individual production for\r\nuse, either directly or through the medium of personal exchange, was\r\nsuperseded by social production for private profit. The wholesale\r\nexchange of social products for private gain took the place of the\r\npersonal exchange of commodities. The difference between the total cost\r\nof the production of commodities, including the wages of the producers,\r\nand their exchange value--determined at this stage by the cost of\r\nproducing similar commodities by individual labor--constituted the share\r\nof the capitalist, his profit, and the objective of his investment.\r\n\r\nThe new system did not spring up spontaneously and full-fledged. Like\r\nfeudalism, it was a growth, a development of existing forms. And just as\r\nchattel slavery lingered on after the rise of the feudal regime, so the\r\nold methods of individual production and direct exchange of commodities\r\nfor personal use lingered on in places and isolated industries long\r\nafter the rise of the system of wage-paid labor and production for\r\nprofit. But the old methods of production and exchange gradually became\r\nrare and almost obsolete. In accordance with the stern economic law that\r\nMarx afterward developed so clearly, the man whose methods of\r\nproduction, including his tools, are less efficient and economical than\r\nthose of his fellows, thereby making his labor more expensive, must\r\neither adapt himself to the new conditions or fall in the struggle which\r\nensues. The triumph of the new system of capitalist production, with its\r\nfar greater efficiency arising from associated production upon a plan of\r\nspecialized division of labor, was, therefore, but a question of time.\r\nThe class of wage-workers thus gradually increased in numbers; as men\r\nfound that they were unable to compete with the new methods, they\r\naccepted the inevitable and adapted themselves to the new conditions.\r\nThe industrial revolution which established capitalism was, like the\r\ngreat revolutions which ushered in preceding social epochs, the product\r\nof man's tools.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[60] Edward Clodd, _Pioneers of Evolution from Thales to Huxley_, page\r\n1.\r\n\r\n[61] _Socialism and Modern Science_, by Enrico Ferri, page 96.\r\n\r\n[62] _Studies in the Evolution of Industrial Society_, by R.

In this stage a permanent wage-working class was formed,\r\nnew markets were developed, many of them by colonial expansion and\r\nterritorial conquest, and production for sale and profit became the\r\nrule, instead of the exception as formerly when men produced primarily\r\nfor use and sold only their surplus products. A new form of class\r\ndivision thus arose out of this economic soil. Instead of being bound to\r\nthe land as the serfs had been under feudalism, the wage-workers were\r\nbound to their tools. They were not bound to a single master, they were\r\nnot branded on the cheek, but they were, nevertheless, dependent upon\r\nthe industrial lords. Economic mastery gradually shifted from the\r\nland-owning class to the class of manufacturers. The political and\r\nsocial history of the Middle Ages is largely the record of the struggle\r\nfor supremacy which was waged between these two classes. That struggle\r\nis the central fact of the Protestant Reformation and the Cromwellian\r\nCommonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe second stage of capitalism begins with the birth of the machine age;\r\nthe introduction of the great mechanical inventions of the latter half\r\nof the seventeenth century, and the resulting industrial revolution, the\r\nsalient features of which we have already traced. That revolution\r\ncentered in England, whose proud but, from all other points of view than\r\nthe commercial, foolish boast for a full century it was to be \"the\r\nworkshop of the world.\" The new methods of production, and the\r\ndevelopment of trade with India, and the colonies and the United States\r\nof America, providing a vast and apparently almost unlimited market, a\r\ntremendous rivalry was created among the people of England, tauntingly,\r\nbut with less originality than bitterness, designated \"a nation of\r\nshopkeepers\" by Napoleon the First. Competition flourished and commerce\r\ngrew under its mighty urge. Quite naturally, therefore, competition came\r\nto be regarded as \"the life of trade,\" and the one supreme law of\r\nprogress by British economists and statesmen. The economic conditions of\r\nthe time fostered a sturdy individualism on the one hand, expressing\r\nitself in a policy of _laissez faire_, which, paradoxically, they as\r\nsurely destroyed. The result was the paradox of a nation of theoretic\r\nindividualists becoming, through its poor laws, and more especially\r\nthrough the vast body of industrial legislation which developed in\r\nspite of theories of _laissez faire_, a nation of practical\r\ncollectivists.\r\n\r\nThe third and last stage of capitalism is characterized by new forms of\r\nindustrial ownership, administration, and control. Concentration of\r\nindustry and the elimination of competition are the distinguishing\r\nfeatures of this stage. When, more than half a century ago, the\r\nSocialists predicted an era of industrial concentration and monopoly as\r\nthe outcome of the competitive struggles of the time, their prophecies\r\nwere mocked and derided. Yet, at this distance of time, it is easy to\r\nsee what they were foresighted enough to envisage in the future; easy\r\nenough to see that competition carries in its bosom the germs of its own\r\ninevitable destruction. In words which, as Professor Ely says,[94] seem\r\nto many, even non-Socialists, like a prophecy, Karl Marx argued that the\r\nbusiness units in production would continuously increase in magnitude,\r\nuntil at last monopoly emerged from the competitive struggle. This\r\nmonopoly becoming a shackle upon the system under which it has grown up,\r\nand thus becoming incompatible with capitalist conditions, socialization\r\nmust, according to Marx, naturally and necessarily follow.[95] In this\r\nas in all the utterances of Marx upon the subject we are reminded of\r\nthe distinction which must be made between Socialism as he conceived it\r\nand the Socialism of the Utopians. We never get away from the law of\r\neconomic interpretation. Socialism, according to Marx, will develop out\r\nof capitalist society, and follow capitalism necessarily and inevitably.\r\nIt is not a plan to be adopted, but a stage of social development to be\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nFor the moment, we are not concerned with the prediction that Socialism\r\nmust follow the full development of capitalism. The important point for\r\nour present study is the predicted growth of monopoly out of\r\ncompetition, and the manner in which that prediction has been realized.\r\nConcerning the manner and extent of the fulfillment of this prediction,\r\nthere have been many keen controversies, both within and without the\r\nranks of the followers of Marx. While Marx and Engels are properly\r\nregarded as the first scientific Socialists, having been the first to\r\npostulate Socialism as the outcome of evolution, and to explore the laws\r\nof that evolution, they were not wholly free from the failings of the\r\nUtopists. It would be unreasonable to expect them to be absolutely free\r\nfrom the spirit of their age and their associates. There is, doubtless,\r\nsomething Utopian in the very mechanical conception of capitalist\r\nconcentration which Marx held; the process is too simple and sweeping,\r\nthe revolution too imminent. Still, by followers and critics alike, it\r\nis generally conceded that the _control_ of the means of production is\r\nbeing concentrated into the hands of small and ever smaller groups of\r\ncapitalists. In recent years the increase in the number of industrial\r\nestablishments has not kept pace with the increase in the number of\r\nworkers employed, the increase of capital, or the value of the products\r\nmanufactured. Not only do we find small groups of men controlling\r\ncertain industries, but a selective process is clearly observable,\r\ngiving to the same groups of men control of various industries otherwise\r\nutterly unrelated.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of the movement toward concentration and\r\ntrustification, it was possible to classify the leading capitalists\r\naccording to the industries with which they were identified. One set of\r\ncapitalists, \"Oil Kings,\" controlled the oil industry; another set,\r\n\"Steel Kings,\" controlled the iron and steel industry; another set,\r\n\"Coal Barons,\" controlled the coal industry, and so on throughout the\r\nindustrial and commercial life of the nation. To-day all this has been\r\nchanged. An examination of the \"Directory of Directors\" shows that the\r\nsame men control varied enterprises. The Oil King is at the same time a\r\nSteel King, a Coal Baron, a Railway Magnate, and so on. The men who\r\ncomprise the Standard Oil group, for instance, are found to control\r\nhundreds of other companies. They include in the scope of their\r\ndirectorate, banking, insurance, milling, real estate, railroad and\r\nsteamship lines, gas companies, sugar, coffee, cotton, and tobacco\r\ncompanies, and a heterogeneous host of other concerns. Not only so, but\r\nthese same men are large holders of investments in all the great\r\nEuropean countries, as well as India, Australia, Africa, Asia, and the\r\nSouth American countries, while foreign capitalists similarly, but to a\r\nless extent, hold large investments in American companies. Thus, the\r\nconcentration of industrial control, through its finance, has become\r\ninterindustrial and is rapidly becoming international. The predictions\r\nof Marx are being fulfilled, even though not in the precise manner\r\nanticipated by him.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nDuring recent years there have been many criticisms of the Marxian\r\ntheory, aiming to show that this concentration has been, and is, much\r\nmore apparent than real. Some of the most important of these criticisms\r\nhave come from within the ranks of the Socialist movement itself, and\r\nhave been widely exploited as portending the disintegration of the\r\nSocialist movement. _Inter alia_, it may be remarked here that a certain\r\nfretfulness of temper characterizes most of the critics of Socialism.\r\nStrict adherence to the letter of Marx is pronounced as a sign of\r\nintellectual bondage of the movement and its leaders to the \"Marxian\r\nfetish,\" and, on the other hand, every recognition of the human\r\nfallibility of Marx by a Socialist thinker is hailed as a sure portent\r\nof a split in the movement. Yet the most serious criticisms of Marx have\r\ncome from the ranks of his followers--perhaps only another sign of the\r\nintellectual bankruptcy of the academic opposition to Socialism.\r\n\r\nOf course, Marx was human and fallible. If \"Capital\" had never been\r\nwritten, there would still have been a Socialist movement, and if it\r\ncould be destroyed by criticism, the Socialist movement would remain.\r\nSocialism is the product of economic conditions, not of a theory or a\r\nbook. \"Capital\" is the intellectual explanation of the genesis of\r\nSocialism, and neither its cause nor an argument for it by which it must\r\nbe judged. Hence the futility of such missions as that undertaken by Mr.\r\nW. H. Mallock, for example, based upon the assumption that attacks upon\r\nthe text of Marx will serve to destroy or seriously hinder the living\r\nmovement. Like a prophet's rebuke to these critics, as well as to those\r\nwithin the ranks of the Socialist movement who would make of the words\r\nof Marx and Engels fetters to bind the movement to a dogma, come the\r\nwords of Engels, published recently, letters in which he writes\r\nvigorously to his friend Sorge concerning the working-class movement in\r\nEngland and America. Of his compatriots, the handful of German Socialist\r\nexiles in America, who sought to make the American workers swallow a\r\nmass of ill-digested Marxian theory, he writes, \"The Germans have never\r\nunderstood how to apply themselves from their theory to the lever which\r\ncould set the American masses in motion; to a great extent they do not\r\nunderstand the theory itself and treat it in a doctrinaire and dogmatic\r\nfashion.... It is a credo to them, not a guide to action.\" And again,\r\n\"Our theory is not a dogma, but the exposition of a process of\r\nevolution, and that process involves several successive phases.\" Of the\r\nEnglish movement he writes, \"And here an instinctive Socialism is more\r\nand more taking possession of the masses which, _fortunately_, is\r\nopposed to all distinct formulation according to the dogmas of one or\r\nthe other so-called organizations,\" and again, he condemns \"the bringing\r\ndown of the Marxian theory of development to a rigid orthodoxy.\"[96] The\r\ncritics who hope to destroy the Socialist movement of to-day by\r\nstringing together mistaken predictions of Marx and Engels, or who think\r\nthat Socialism is losing its grip because it is adjusting its\r\nexpressions to the changed conditions which the progress of fifty years\r\nhas brought about, utterly mistake the character of the movement. In\r\nits abandonment of the errors of Marx it is most truly Marxian--because\r\nit is expressing life instead of repeating dogma.\r\n\r\nDoubtless Marx anticipated a much more complete concentration of capital\r\nand industry than has yet taken place; doubtless, too, he underrated the\r\npowers of endurance of some petty industries, and saw the breakdown of\r\ncapitalism in a cataclysm, whereas modern Socialists see its merging\r\ninto a form of socialization. But, when all this is admitted, it cannot\r\nbe fairly said that the sum of criticism has seriously affected the\r\ngeneral Marxian theory, as apart from its particular exposition by Marx\r\nhimself. So far as the criticism has touched the subject of capitalist\r\nconcentration, it has been pitifully weak, and the furore it has created\r\nseems almost pathetic. The main results of this criticism may be briefly\r\nsummarized as follows: First, in industry, the persistence, and, in some\r\ncases, even increase, of petty industries; second, in agriculture, the\r\nfailure of large-scale farming, and the decrease of the average farm\r\nacreage; third, in retail trade, the persistence of the small stores,\r\ndespite the growth in size and number of the great department stores;\r\nfourth, the fact that concentration of industry does not imply a like\r\nconcentration of wealth, the number of shareholders in a great\r\nindustrial combination being frequently greater than the number of\r\nowners in the units of industry prior to the combination. At first\r\nsight, and stated in this manner, it would seem as if these conclusions,\r\nif justified by the facts, involved a serious and far-reaching criticism\r\nof the Socialist theory of a universal tendency toward the concentration\r\nof industry and commerce into units of ever increasing magnitude.\r\n\r\nBut upon closer examination, these conclusions, their accuracy admitted,\r\nare seen to involve no very damaging criticism of the theory. To the\r\nsuperficial observer, the mere increase in the number of industrial\r\nestablishments seems a much more important matter than to the careful\r\nstudent, who is not easily deceived by appearances. The student sees\r\nthat while some petty industries undoubtedly do increase in number, the\r\nincrease of large industries employing many more workers and much larger\r\ncapitals is vastly greater. Furthermore, he sees what the superficial\r\nobserver constantly overlooks, namely, that these petty industries are,\r\nfor the most part, unstable and transient, being continually absorbed by\r\nthe larger industrial combinations or crushed out of existence, as soon\r\nas they have obtained sufficient vitality and strength to make them\r\nworthy of notice, either as tributaries to be desired or potential\r\ncompetitors to be feared. Petty industries in a very large number of\r\ncases represent a stage in social descent, the wreckage of larger\r\nindustries whose owners are economically as dependent as the ordinary\r\nwage-workers, or even poorer and more to be pitied. Where, on the\r\ncontrary, it is a stage in social ascent, the petty industry is,\r\nparadoxical as the idea may appear, frequently part of the process of\r\nindustrial concentration. By independent gleaning, it endeavors to find\r\nsufficient business to maintain its existence. If it fails in this, its\r\nowner falls back to the proletarian level from which, in most instances,\r\nhe arose. If it succeeds only to a degree sufficient to maintain its\r\nowner at or near the average wage-earner's level of comfort, it may pass\r\nunnoticed and unmolested. If, on the other hand, it gleans sufficient\r\nbusiness to make it desirable as a tributary, or potentially dangerous\r\nas a competitor, the petty business is pounced upon by its mightier\r\nrival and either absorbed or crushed, according to the temper or need of\r\nthe latter. Critics of the Marxian theory have for the most part\r\ncompletely failed to recognize this significant aspect of the subject,\r\nand attached far too much importance to the continuance of petty\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWhat is true of petty industry is true in even greater measure of retail\r\ntrade. Nothing could well be further from the truth than the hasty\r\ngeneralization of some critics, that an increase in the number of retail\r\nbusiness establishments invalidates the theory of a progressive\r\nconcentration of capital. In the first place, many of these\r\nestablishments have no independence whatsoever, but are merely agencies\r\nof larger enterprises. Mr. Macrosty has shown that in London the cheap\r\nrestaurants are in the hands of four or five firms, and this is a branch\r\nof business which, because it calls for relatively small capital, shows\r\nin a marked manner the increase of establishments. Much the same\r\nconditions exist in connection with the trade in milk and bread.[97]\r\nSimilar conditions prevail in almost all the large cities of this\r\ncountry. Single companies are known to control hundreds of saloons,\r\nrestaurants, cigar stores, shoe stores, bake shops, coal depots, and the\r\nlike. A multitude of other businesses are subject to this rule, and it\r\nis doubtful whether, after all, there has been the real increase of\r\nindividual ownership which Mr. Ghent concedes.[98] However that may be,\r\nit is certain that a very large number of the business establishments\r\nwhich figure as statistical units in the argument against the Socialist\r\ntheory of the concentration of capital might very properly be regarded\r\nas so many evidences in its favor.\r\n\r\nA very large number of small businesses, moreover, are really\r\nmanipulated by speculators, and serve only as a means of divesting\r\nprudent and thrifty artisans and others of their little savings.\r\nWhoever has lived in the poorer quarters of a great city, where small\r\nstores are most numerous, and has watched the changes constantly\r\noccurring in the stores of the neighborhood, will realize the\r\nsignificance of this observation. The writer has known stores on the\r\nupper East Side of New York, where for several years he resided, change\r\nhands as many as six or seven times in a single year. What happened was\r\ngenerally this: A workingman having been thrown out of employment, or\r\nforced to give up his work by reason of age, sickness, or accident,\r\ndecided to attempt to make a living in \"business.\" In a few weeks, or a\r\nfew months at most, his small savings were swallowed up, and he had to\r\nleave the store, making place for the next victim. An acquaintance of\r\nthe writer owns six tenement houses in different parts of New York City,\r\nthe ground floors of which are occupied by small stores. These stores\r\nare rented by the month just as other portions of the buildings are, and\r\nthe owner, on going over his books for a period of five years, found\r\nthat the average duration of tenancy in them had been less than eight\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years in the United States, as a result of the\r\ndevelopment of the many inventions for the production of \"moving\r\npictures,\" a new kind of cheap, popular theater has become common.\r\nUsually the charge of admission is five cents, whence the name\r\n\"Nickelodeon\"; the entertainment consists usually of a number of more or\r\nless dramatic incidents portrayed by means of the pictures, and a few\r\nsongs, generally illustrated by pictures, and sung to the accompaniment\r\nof a mechanical piano. In almost every town in the United States these\r\ncheap pictorial theaters have appeared and their number will, doubtless,\r\nconsiderably swell the total of business establishments. In the small\r\ntowns of the State of New York, the writer made an investigation and\r\nfound that there were frequently several such places in the same town;\r\nthat they were practically all built by the same persons, started by\r\nthem, and then leased to others. These were generally people with small\r\nsavings who, in the course of a few weeks, lost all their money and\r\nretired, their places being taken by other victims of the speculators.\r\nWhat seemed to the casual observer an admirable and conspicuous example\r\nof an increase in petty business, proved, upon closer study, to be a\r\nvery striking example of concentration, disguised for purposes of\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nThus reduced, the increase of small industries and retail establishments\r\naffects the contention that there is a general tendency to concentration\r\nvery little. It does perhaps seriously weaken, or even destroy, some\r\nextreme statements of the theory, contending that the process of\r\nmonopolization must be a direct, simple process of continuous absorption\r\nand elimination, leaving each year fewer small units than before. Small\r\nstores do exist; they have not been put out of existence by the big\r\ndepartment stores as was at one time confidently predicted. They serve a\r\nreal social need by supplying the minor commodities of everyday use in\r\nsmall quantities, just as the petty industries serve a real social need.\r\nMany of them are conducted by married women to supplement the earnings\r\nof their husbands, or by widows; others by men unable to work, whose\r\nincome from them is less than the wages of artisans. Together, these\r\nprobably constitute a majority of the small retail establishments which\r\nshow any tendency to increase.[99]\r\n\r\nThe effect of this increase is still further lessened when it is\r\nremembered that only the critics of Socialism interpret the Marxian\r\ntheory to mean that _all_ petty industry and business must disappear,\r\nthat all must be concentrated into large industrial and commercial\r\nunits, to make Socialism possible. If we are to judge Marxism as the\r\nbasis of the Socialist movement, we must judge it by the interpretation\r\ngiven to it by the Socialists, and not otherwise. There is no Socialist\r\nof note to-day who does not realize that many small industrial and\r\nbusiness enterprises will continue to exist for a very long time, even\r\ncontinuing to exist under a Socialist regime. Kautsky, perhaps the\r\nablest living exponent of the Marxian theories, leader of the \"Orthodox\"\r\nMarxists, admits this. He has very ably argued that the ripeness of\r\nsociety for Socialism, for social production and control, depends, not\r\nupon the number of little industries that still remain, but upon the\r\nnumber of great industries which already exist.[100] The ripeness of\r\nsociety for Socialism is not disproved by the number of ruins and relics\r\nabounding. \"Without a developed great industry, Socialism is\r\nimpossible,\" says this writer. \"Where, however, a great industry exists\r\nto a considerable degree, it is easy for a Socialist society to\r\n_concentrate production, and to quickly rid itself of the little\r\nindustry_.\"[101] It is the increase of large industries, then, which\r\nSocialists regard as the essential preliminary condition of Socialism.\r\n\r\nFar more important than the increase or decrease of the number of units\r\nis their relative significance in the total production, a phase of the\r\nsubject which is rather disingenuously avoided by most critics of\r\nMarxism. Mr. Lucien Sanial, a Socialist statistician of repute, and one\r\nof the profoundest Marxian students in America, has shown this in a\r\nnumber of suggestive tables. For example, he takes twenty-seven typical\r\nmanufacturing industries for the years 1880, 1900, and 1905, and\r\ncompares the number of establishments in each year with the total amount\r\nof capital invested and workers employed. In 1880 the number of\r\nestablishments was 63,233; in 1900 the number was 51,912, and in 1905 it\r\nwas only 44,142. From 1880 to 1905 there had been a decrease in the\r\nnumber of establishments of 35.3 per cent, of which 15 per cent took\r\nplace within the last five years. But within the same period there had\r\nbeen an increase in the amount of capital invested in these twenty-seven\r\nindustries as follows: from $1,276,600,000 in 1880 to $3,324,500,000 in\r\n1900 and to $4,628,800,000 in 1905--a total increase from 1880 to 1905\r\nof 262.6 per cent. On the other hand, the number of wage-workers\r\nincreased in the same period only 60.2 per cent, the number in 1905\r\nbeing 1,731,500, as against 1,611,000 in 1900 and 1,080,200 in 1880.\r\n\r\nIn another table, forty-seven industries are taken. These forty-seven\r\nindustries comprised 29,800 establishments in 1900; five years later\r\nthere were but 26,182. In 1900 the total capital invested in these\r\nindustries was $1,005,400,000, and in 1905 it had increased to\r\n$1,339,500,000. In the same five years the number of wage-workers\r\nincreased only from 618,000 to 749,000. Thus, in the group of larger\r\nindustries and the group of smaller ones we find the same evidences of\r\nconcentration: less establishments, larger capitals, and an increase of\r\nwage-workers not equal to the increase in capitalization.[102]\r\n\r\nIn connection with these figures, the following table may be profitably\r\nstudied, as showing the relative insignificance of the small producer in\r\nthe total volume of manufacture. It will be seen that the two largest\r\nclasses of establishments have only 24,163 establishments, 11.2 per cent\r\nof the total number. But they have $10,333,000,000, or 81.5 per cent of\r\nthe total manufacturing capital, and employ 71.6 per cent of all\r\nwage-workers in manufacturing industries. It may be added that they turn\r\nout 79.3 per cent of the total product. Of the petty industries proper,\r\nthose having a capital of less than $5000, it will be observed that they\r\nnumber 32.9 per cent of the total number of establishments, but employ\r\nonly 1.3 per cent of the capital invested, and only 1.9 per cent of the\r\nwage-workers. It is clear, therefore, that our manufacturing industry in\r\nvery highly concentrated, and that the petty industries are, despite\r\ntheir number, a very insignificant factor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENTS, 1905[103]\r\n\r\nCAPITALS   NUMBER    PER   TOTAL CAPITAL    PER     NO.

A few years ago we witnessed the\r\nrise and rapid growth of the great bonanza farms in this country. It was\r\nshown that the advantages of large capital and the consolidation of\r\nproductive forces resulted, in farming as in manufacture, in greatly\r\ncheapened production.[104] The end of the small farm was declared to be\r\nimminent, and it seemed for a while that concentration in agriculture\r\nwould even outrun concentration in manufacture. This predicted\r\nabsorption of the small farms by the larger, and the average increase of\r\nfarm acreage, has not, however, been fulfilled to any great degree. An\r\nincrease in the number of small farms, and a decrease in the average\r\nacreage, is shown in almost all the states. The increase of great\r\nestates shown by the census figures probably bears little or no relation\r\nto real farming, consisting mainly of great stock grazing ranches in the\r\nWest, and unproductive gentlemen's estates in the East.\r\n\r\nApparently, then, the Socialist theory that \"the big fish eat up the\r\nlittle ones, and are in turn eaten by still bigger ones,\" is not\r\napplicable to agriculture. On the contrary, it seems that the great\r\nfarms cannot compete successfully with the smaller farms. It is\r\ntherefore not surprising that writers so sympathetic to Socialism as\r\nProfessor Werner Sombart and Professor Richard T. Ely should claim that\r\nthe Marxian system breaks down when it reaches the sphere of\r\nagricultural industry, and that it seems to be applicable only to\r\nmanufacture. This position has been taken by a not inconsiderable body\r\nof Socialists in recent years, and is one of the tenets of that critical\r\nmovement within the Socialist ranks which has come to be known as\r\n\"Revisionism.\" Nothing is more delusive than statistical argument of\r\nthis kind, and while these conclusions should be given due weight, they\r\nshould not be too hastily accepted. An examination of the statistical\r\nbasis of the argument is necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, small agricultural holdings do not necessarily\r\nimply economic independence, any more than do petty industries or\r\nbusinesses. When we examine the census figures carefully, the first\r\nimportant fact which challenges attention is that, whereas of the farms\r\nin the United States in 1880, 71.6 per cent were operated by their\r\nowners, in 1900 the _proportion_ had declined to 64.7 per cent. In 1900,\r\nof the 5,739,657 farms in the United States, no less than 2,026,286 were\r\noperated by tenants. Concerning the ownership of these rented farms\r\nlittle investigation has been made, and it is likely that careful\r\ninquiry would elicit the fact that this is a not unimportant phase of\r\nagricultural concentration, though not revealed by the figures in the\r\ncensus reports. It remains to be said concerning these figures, however,\r\nthat they do not lend support to the theory that the small farms are\r\nbeing swallowed up by the larger ones, for in the same period there was\r\na very decided increase in the _number_ of farms operated by their\r\nowners. Thus we have the same set of figures used to support both sides\r\nof the controversy--one side calling attention to the decreased\r\n_proportion_ of farms operated by their owners, the other to the\r\nincreased _number_.\r\n\r\nA similar difficulty presents itself in connection with the subject of\r\nmortgaged farm holdings. In 1890, the mortgaged indebtedness of the\r\nfarmers of the United States amounted to the immense sum of\r\n$1,085,995,960, a sum almost equal to the value of the entire wheat\r\ncrop. Now, while a mortgage is certainly not suggestive of independence,\r\nit may be either a sign of decreasing or increasing independence. It may\r\nbe a step toward the ultimate loss of one's farm or a step toward the\r\nultimate ownership of one. Much that has been written by Populist and\r\nSocialist pamphleteers and editors upon this subject has been based upon\r\nthe entirely erroneous assumption that a mortgaged farm meant loss of\r\neconomic independence, whereas it often happens that it is a step toward\r\nit. The fact is that we know very little concerning the ownership of\r\nthese mortgages, which is the crux of the question. It is known that\r\nmany of the insurance, banking, and trust companies have invested\r\nlargely in farm mortgages. This is another phase of concentration which\r\nthe critics of the theory have overlooked almost entirely. One thing\r\nseems certain, namely, that farm ownership is not on the decline. It is\r\nnot being supplanted by tenantry; the small farms are not being absorbed\r\nby larger ones. It seems a fair deduction from the facts, then, that the\r\nsmall farmer will continue to be an important factor--indeed, the most\r\nimportant factor--in American agriculture for a long time to come,\r\nperhaps permanently. If the Socialist movement is to succeed in America,\r\nit must recognize this fact in its propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nMost of the criticism of the Marxian theory of concentration is based\r\nupon a very unsatisfactory definition of what is meant by concentration.\r\nThe decrease of small units and their absorption or supercession by\r\nlarger units is generally understood when concentration is spoken of.\r\nBut concentration may take other, very different forms. There may be a\r\nconcentration of _control_, for example, without concentration of actual\r\nownership, or there may be concentration of actual ownership disguised\r\nby mortgages, as already suggested. The sweated trades are a familiar\r\nexample of the former method of concentration. It has been shown over\r\nand over again that while small establishments remain a necessary\r\ncondition of sweated industry, there is almost always effective\r\nconcentration of control. To all appearances an independent manufacturer\r\non a small scale, the sweater is generally nothing more than the agent\r\nof some big establishment, which finds it more economical to let the\r\nwork be done in sweatshops than in its own factories. The same thing\r\nholds good of the retail trades, many of the apparently independent\r\nretail stores being simply agencies for big wholesale houses, controlled\r\nby them in every way. In an even larger measure, agriculture is subject\r\nto a control that is quite independent of actual or even nominal\r\nownership of the farm. Manifestly, therefore, we need a more accurate\r\nand comprehensive definition of concentration than the one generally\r\naccepted. Mr. A. M. Simons, in an admirable study of the agricultural\r\nquestion from the Socialist viewpoint, defines concentration as \"a\r\nmovement tending to give a continually diminishing minority of the\r\npersons engaged in any industry, a constantly increasing control over\r\nthe essentials, and a continually increasing share of the total value of\r\nthe returns of the industry.\"[105] It is no part of the purpose of this\r\nchapter to discuss this definition at length. It is sufficient to have\r\nthus emphasized that concentration may be quite as effective when it is\r\nlimited to control as when it embraces ownership.\r\n\r\nThere are, then, other forms of concentration than the physical one, the\r\namalgamation of smaller units to form larger ones, and very often these\r\nforms of concentration go on unperceived and unsuspected. There can be\r\nno doubt that this is especially true of agricultural industry. Many\r\nbranches of farming, as the industry was carried on by our fathers and\r\ntheir fathers before them, have been transferred from the farmhouse to\r\nthe factory. Butter and cheese making, for example, have largely passed\r\nout of the farm kitchen into the factory. The writer recalls a visit to\r\na large farm in the Middle West. The sound of a churn is never heard\r\nthere, notwithstanding that it is a \"dairy farm,\" and all the butter\r\nand cheese consumed in that household is bought at the village store.\r\nDoubtless this farm but presented an exaggerated form of a condition\r\nthat is becoming more and more common. The invention of labor-saving\r\nmachinery and its application to agriculture leads to a division of the\r\nindustry and the absorption by the factory of the parts most influenced\r\nby the new processes. When we remember the tremendous role which complex\r\nagencies outside of the farm play in modern agricultural industry, we\r\nsee the subject of concentration as it applies to that industry in a new\r\nlight. The grain elevators, cold-storage houses, creameries, and even\r\nrailroads, are part of the necessary equipment of production, but they\r\nare owned and operated independently of the farm. There is a good deal\r\nof concentration of production in agriculture which takes the form of\r\nthe absorption of some of its processes by factories instead of by other\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWe must also distinguish between the concentration of industry and the\r\nconcentration of wealth. While there is a natural relation between these\r\ntwo phenomena, they are by no means identical. The trustification of a\r\ngiven industry may bring together a score of industrial units in one\r\ngigantic concern, so concentrating capital and production, but it is\r\nconceivable that every one of the owners of the units which compose the\r\ntrust may have a share in it equal to the capital value of his\r\nparticular unit, but more profitable. In that case, there can obviously\r\nbe no concentration of wealth. What occurs is that all are benefited by\r\ncertain economies, in exact proportion to their holdings in the capital\r\nstock. It may even happen that a larger number of persons participate,\r\nas shareholders, in the amalgamation than were formerly concerned in the\r\nownership of the units of which the amalgamation is composed. Assuming,\r\nfor the purposes of our argument, that these persons are represented by\r\nnew capital, that the former owners of independent units share upon an\r\nequitable basis, there will be increased diffusion of wealth instead of\r\nits concentration. As Professor Ely says, \"If the stock of the United\r\nStates Steel Corporation were owned by individuals holding one share\r\neach, the concentration in industry would be just as great as it is now,\r\nbut there would be a wide diffusion in the ownership of the wealth of\r\nthe corporation.\"[106]\r\n\r\nObvious as this distinction may seem, it is very often lost sight of,\r\nand when recognized it presents difficulties which are almost\r\ninsurmountable. It is well-nigh impossible to present statistically the\r\nrelation of the concentration of capital to the concentration or\r\ndiffusion of wealth, important as the point is in its bearings upon\r\nmodern Socialist theory. While the distinction does not affect the\r\nargument that the concentration of capital and industry makes their\r\nsocialization possible, it is nevertheless an important matter. If, as\r\nsome writers, notably Bernstein,[107] the Socialist, have argued, the\r\nconcentration of capital and industry really leads to the\r\ndecentralization of wealth, and the diffusion of the advantages of\r\nconcentration among the great mass of the people, especially by creating\r\na new class of salaried dependents, then, instead of creating a class of\r\nexploiters ever becoming less numerous, and a class of proletarians ever\r\nbecoming more numerous, the tendency of modern capitalism is to\r\ndistribute the gains of industry over a widening area--a process of\r\ndemocratization in fact. It is very evident that if this contention is a\r\ncorrect one, there must be a softening rather than an intensifying of\r\nclass antagonisms; a tendency away from class divisions, and to greater\r\nsatisfaction with present conditions, rather than increasing discontent.\r\nIf this theory can be sustained, the advocates of Socialism will be\r\nobliged to change the nature of their propaganda from an appeal to the\r\neconomic interest of the proletariat to the general ethical sense of\r\nmankind. There can be no successful movement based upon the interests\r\nof one class if the tendency of modern capitalism is to democratize the\r\nlife of the world and diffuse its wealth over larger social areas than\r\never before.\r\n\r\nThe exponents of this theory have based their arguments upon statistical\r\ndata chiefly relating to: (1) The number of taxable incomes in countries\r\nwhere incomes are taxed; (2) the number of investors in industrial and\r\ncommercial countries; (3) the number of savings bank deposits. As often\r\nhappens when reliance is placed upon the direct statistical method, the\r\nresult of all the discussion and controversy upon this subject is\r\nextremely disappointing and confusing. The same figures are used to\r\nsupport both sides of the argument with equal plausibility. The\r\ndifficulty lies in the fact that the available statistics do not include\r\nall the facts essential to a scientific and conclusive result.\r\n\r\nIt is not intended here to add to the Babel of voices in this\r\ndiscussion, but to present the conclusions of two or three of the most\r\ncareful investigators in this field. Professor Ely[108] quotes a table\r\nof incomes in the Grand Duchy of Baden, based upon the income tax\r\nreturns of that country, which has formed the theme of much dispute. The\r\ntable shows that in the two years, 1886 and 1896, less than one per cent\r\nof the incomes assessed were over 10,000 marks a year, and from this\r\nfact it has been argued that wealth in that country has not been\r\nconcentrated to any very great extent. In like manner, the French\r\neconomist, Leroy-Beaulieu, has argued that the fact that in 1896 only\r\n2750 persons in Paris had incomes of over 100,000 francs a year betokens\r\na wide diffusion of wealth and an absence of concentration.[109] But the\r\nimportant point of the discussion, the _proportion of the total wealth\r\nowned by these classes_, is entirely lost sight of by those who argue in\r\nthis manner. Further, it must always be borne in mind that there is a\r\ndecided tendency in all income tax schedules to understate the amount of\r\nincomes above a certain size, the larger the income the more likelihood\r\nof its being understated in the returns. The psychology of this fact\r\nneeds no elaborate demonstration. Taking the figures for the Grand Duchy\r\nof Baden as they are given, we have no particulars at all concerning the\r\nnumber of incomes under 500 marks, but of the persons assessed upon\r\nincomes of 500 marks and over, in 1886, the poorest two thirds had about\r\none third of the total income, and the richest 0.69 per cent had 12.78\r\nper cent of the total income. So far, the figures show a much greater\r\nconcentration of wealth than appears from the simple fact that less than\r\none per cent of the incomes assessed were over 10,000 marks a year.\r\n\r\nGoing further, we compare the two years, 1886 and 1896, and find that\r\nthis concentration increased during the ten-year period as follows: In\r\n1886, there were 2212 incomes of more than 10,000 marks assessed, being\r\n0.69 per cent of the total number. In 1896, there were 3099 incomes of\r\nmore than 10,000 marks assessed, being 0.78 per cent of the total\r\nnumber. In 1886, 0.69 per cent of the incomes assessed amounted to\r\n51,403,000 marks, representing 12.77 per cent of the total assessed\r\nwealth; while in 1896, 0.78 per cent of the incomes assessed amounted to\r\n81,986,000 marks, representing 15.02 per cent of the total wealth so\r\nassessed. In 1886 there were 18 incomes of over 200,000 marks a year,\r\naggregating 6,864,000 marks, 1.70 per cent of the total value of all\r\nincomes assessed; in 1896, there were 28 such incomes, aggregating\r\n12,481,000 marks, or 2.29 per cent of the total value of all incomes\r\nassessed. The increase of concentration shown by these figures is not\r\ndisputable, it seems to the present writer, when they are thus carefully\r\nanalyzed, notwithstanding the fact that the table from which they are\r\ndrawn is sometimes used to support the opposite contention.\r\n\r\nAccording to the late Professor Richmond Mayo-Smith,[110] seventy per\r\ncent of the population of Prussia have incomes below the income tax\r\nstandard, their total income representing only one third of the total\r\nincome of the population. An additional one fourth of the population\r\nenjoys one third of the total income, while the remaining one third goes\r\nto about four per cent of the people. The significance of these figures\r\nis clearly shown by the following diagram:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                             DIAGRAM\r\n\r\n     SHOWING THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME BY CLASSES IN PRUSSIA]\r\n\r\nIn Saxony the statistics show that \"two thirds of the population possess\r\nless than one third of the income, and that 3.5 per cent of the upper\r\nincomes receive more than 66 per cent at the lower end.\" From a table\r\nprepared by Sir Robert Giffen, a notoriously optimistic statistician,\r\nalways the exponent of an ultra-roseate view of social conditions,\r\nProfessor Mayo-Smith concludes that in England, \"about ten per cent of\r\nthe people receive nearly one half of the total income.\"[111] These\r\nfigures are rather out of date, it is true, but they err in understating\r\nthe amount of concentration rather than otherwise, as the researches of\r\nMr. Chiozza Money, M.P., and others show.[112]\r\n\r\nIn this country, the absence of income tax figures makes it impossible\r\nto get direct statistical evidence as to the distribution of incomes.\r\nThe most careful estimate of the distribution of wealth in the United\r\nStates yet made is that by the late Dr. Charles B. Spahr.[113] Written\r\nin 1895, Dr. Spahr's book cannot be regarded as an accurate presentation\r\nof conditions as they exist at the present moment, yet here again there\r\nis every reason to believe that the process of concentration has gone on\r\nunchecked since he wrote. It is not necessary for our present purpose,\r\nhowever, to accept the estimate of Dr. Spahr as authoritative and\r\nconclusive. The figures are quoted here simply as the result reached by\r\nthe most patient, conscientious, and scientific examination of the\r\ndistribution of wealth in this country yet made. Dr. Spahr's conclusion\r\nwas that in 1895 less than one half of the families in the United States\r\nwere property-less; but that, nevertheless, seven eighths of the\r\nfamilies owned only one eighth of the national wealth, while one per\r\ncent of the families owned more than the remaining ninety-nine per cent.\r\n\r\nMr. Lucien Sanial, in a most careful analysis of the census for 1900,\r\nshows that, classified according to occupations, 250,251 persons\r\npossessed $67,000,000,000, out of a total of $95,000,000,000 given as\r\nthe national wealth; that is to say, 0.9 per cent of the total number in\r\nall occupations owned 70.5 per cent of the total national wealth. The\r\nmiddle class, consisting of 8,429,845 persons, being 29.0 per cent of\r\nthe total number in all occupations, owned $24,000,000,000, or 25.3 per\r\ncent of the total national wealth. The lowest class, the proletariat,\r\nconsisting of 20,393,137 persons, being 70.1 per cent of the total\r\nnumber in all occupations, owned but $4,000,000,000, or 4.2 per cent of\r\nthe total wealth. To recapitulate: Of the 29,073,233 persons ten years\r\nold and over engaged in occupations,\r\n\r\n\r\n      0.9 per cent own    70.5 per cent of total wealth.\r\n     29.0 per cent own    25.3 per cent of total wealth.\r\n     70.1 per cent own     4.2 per cent of total wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nStartling as these figures are, it will be evident upon reflection that\r\nthey do not adequately represent the amount of wealth concentration. The\r\noccupational basis is not quite satisfactory as applied to the richest\r\nclass. It serves for the proletarian class, of course, and for a very\r\nlarge part of the middle class. In these classes, as a rule, the\r\n_occupied_ persons represent wealth ownership. But this is by no means\r\ntrue of the richest class. In this class we have a very considerable\r\nproportion of the wealth owned by _unoccupied_ persons, such as the\r\nwives rich in their own right, children and other unoccupied members of\r\nfamilies rich by inheritance. Mr. Henry Laurens Call, in a paper read\r\nbefore the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at\r\nColumbia University, at the end of 1906, made these figures the basis of\r\nthe startling estimate that one per cent of our population own not less\r\nthan ninety per cent of our total wealth.\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiarity of modern capitalism which enables the great\r\ncapitalists to control vastly more wealth than they own. Take any group\r\nof large capitalists, and it will be found that they _control_ a much\r\ngreater volume of capital than they _own_. The invested capital of a\r\nmultitude of small investors is in their keeping, and they can and do\r\nuse it for purposes of their own. Thus we have a concentration of\r\ncapitalist control which goes far beyond the concentration of ownership.\r\nAnd this concentration of the essential control of the capital of a\r\ncountry becomes more and more important each year. It is recognized\r\nto-day that the most important capitalist is not he who himself owns the\r\ngreatest amount of capital, but he who controls the greatest amount,\r\nquite irrespective of its ownership.\r\n\r\nThe growth of immense private fortunes is an indisputable evidence of\r\nthe concentration of wealth. In 1854 there were not more than\r\ntwenty-five millionaires in New York City, their total fortunes\r\naggregating $43,000,000. There were not more than fifty millionaires in\r\nthe whole of the United States, their aggregate fortunes not exceeding\r\n$80,000,000. To-day there are several individual fortunes of more than\r\n$80,000,000 each. New York City alone is said to have over two thousand\r\nmillionaires, and the United States more than five thousand. By a\r\ncurious mental process, the _New York World_, when the first edition of\r\nthis little book appeared, sought to prove in a labored editorial that\r\nthe increase of millionaires tended to prove an increasing diffusion of\r\nwealth rather than the contrary. It is hardly worth while, perhaps,\r\nmaking any reply to such puerility. Every student knows that the\r\nmultimillionaire is only possible as a result of the concentration of\r\nwealth, that such fortunes are realized by the absorption of numerous\r\nsmaller ones. Further, it is only necessary to add that all the\r\nmillionaires of 1854, together with the half millionaires, owned not\r\nmore than about $100,000,000 out of the total wealth, which was at that\r\ntime something like $10,000,000,000. In other words, they owned not more\r\nthan one per cent of the wealth of the country. In 1890, when the wealth\r\nof the country was slightly more than $65,000,000,000, Senator Ingalls\r\ncould quote in the United States Senate a table showing that the\r\nmillionaires and half millionaires of that time, 31,100 persons in all,\r\nowned $36,250,000,000, or just fifty-six per cent of the entire wealth\r\nof the United States.[114] Professor Ely accepts the logic of the\r\nstatistical data gathered in Europe and the United States, and says\r\n\"such statistics as we have ... all indicate a marked concentration of\r\nwealth, both in this country and Europe.\"[115]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nSumming up, we may state the argument of this chapter very briefly as\r\nfollows: The Socialist theory is that competition is self-destructive,\r\nand that the inevitable result of the competitive process is to produce\r\nmonopoly, either through the crushing out of the weak by the strong, or\r\nthe combination of units as a result of a conscious recognition of the\r\nwastes of competition and the advantages of cooeperation. The law of\r\ncapitalist development, therefore, is from competition and division to\r\ncombination and concentration. As this concentration proceeds, a large\r\nclass of proletarians is formed on the one hand, and a small class of\r\ncapitalist lords on the other, an essential antagonism of interests\r\nexisting between the two classes. Petty industries may continue to\r\nexist, though, upon the whole, the tendency is toward their extinction.\r\nIn certain industries, their number may even increase, but their\r\nrelative importance is constantly decreasing. While Socialism does not\r\npreclude the continued existence of small private industry or business,\r\nit does require and depend upon the development of a large body of\r\nconcentrated industry, monopolies which can be transformed into social\r\nmonopolies whenever the people may decide so to transform them. These\r\nconditions are being fulfilled in the evolution of our economic system.\r\n\r\nThe interindustrial and international trustification of industry shows a\r\nremarkable fulfillment of the law of capitalist concentration which the\r\nSocialists were the first to formulate; the existence of petty\r\nindustries and businesses, or their numerical increase even, being a\r\nrelatively insignificant matter compared with the enormous increase in\r\nlarge industries and businesses, and their share in the total volume of\r\nindustry and commerce. In agriculture, concentration, while it does not\r\nproceed so rapidly or directly as in manufacture and commerce, and while\r\nit takes directions and forms unforeseen by the Socialists of a\r\ngeneration ago, proceeds surely nevertheless. Along with this\r\nconcentration of capital and industry proceeds the concentration of\r\nwealth into proportionately fewer hands. While a certain diffusion of\r\nwealth takes place through the mechanism of capitalist concentration, by\r\ndeveloping a new class of highly salaried officials, and enabling\r\nnumerous small investors to own shares in great industrial and\r\ncommercial corporations, it is not sufficient to balance the\r\nexpropriation which goes on in the competitive struggle, and it is true\r\nthat a larger proportion of the national wealth is owned by a minority\r\nof the population than ever before, that minority being proportionately\r\nless numerous than ever before. Further, the peculiar financial\r\norganization of modern capitalist society enables the ruling capitalists\r\nto control and use to their own advantage the wealth of others invested\r\nin industrial and commercial corporations. Thus to the concentration of\r\nownership must be added the concentration of control, which plays an\r\nincreasingly important part in capitalist economics.\r\n\r\nWhatever defects there may be in the Marxian theory, as outlined by Marx\r\nhimself, and whatever modifications of his statement of it may be\r\nrendered necessary by changed conditions, in its main and essential\r\nfeatures it has successfully withstood all the criticisms which have\r\nbeen directed against it. Economic literature is full of prophecies, but\r\nin its whole range there is not an instance of prophecy more literally\r\nand abundantly fulfilled than that which Marx made concerning the trend\r\nof capitalist development.

Many who\r\nare otherwise sympathetic to Socialism denounce this doctrine as narrow,\r\nbrutal, and productive of antisocialistic feelings of class hatred. Upon\r\nall hands the doctrine is condemned as an un-American appeal to passion\r\nand a wicked exaggeration of social conditions. When President Roosevelt\r\nattacks the preachers of the doctrine, and wrathfully condemns\r\nclass-consciousness as \"a foul thing,\" he doubtless expresses the views\r\nof a majority of American citizens. The insistence of Socialists upon\r\nthis aspect of their propaganda is undoubtedly responsible for keeping a\r\ngreat many outside of their movement who otherwise would be identified\r\nwith it. If the Socialists would repudiate the doctrine that Socialism\r\nis a class movement, and make their appeal to the intelligence and\r\nconscience of all classes, instead of to the interests of a special\r\nclass, they could probably double their numerical strength at once. To\r\nmany, therefore, it seems a fatuous and quixotic policy to preach such a\r\ndoctrine, and it is very often charitably ascribed to the peculiar\r\nintellectual and moral myopia of fanaticism.\r\n\r\nBefore accepting this conclusion, and before indorsing the Rooseveltian\r\nverdict, the reader is bound as a matter of common fairness, and of\r\nintellectual integrity, to consider the Socialist side of the argument.\r\nThere is no greater fanaticism than that which condemns what it does not\r\ntake the trouble to understand. The Socialists claim that the doctrine\r\nis misrepresented; that it does not produce class hatred; and that it is\r\na vital and pivotal point of Socialist philosophy. The class struggle,\r\nsays the Socialist, is a law of social development. We only recognize\r\nthe law, and are no more responsible for its existence than for the law\r\nof gravitation. The name of Marx is associated with the law in just the\r\nsame manner as the name of Newton is associated with the law of\r\ngravitation, but Marx is no more responsible for the social law he\r\ndiscovered than was Newton for the physical law he discovered. There\r\nwere class struggles thousands of years before there was a Socialist\r\nmovement, thousands of years before Marx was born, and it is therefore\r\nabsurd to charge us with the creation of the class struggle, or class\r\nhatred. We realize perfectly well that if we ignored this law in our\r\npropaganda, making our appeal to a universal sense of abstract justice\r\nand truth, many who now hold aloof from us would join our movement. But\r\nwe should not gain strength as a result of their accession to our ranks.\r\nWe should be obliged to emasculate Socialism, to dilute it, in order to\r\nwin a support of questionable value. History teems with examples of the\r\ndisaster which inevitably attends such a course. We should be quixotic\r\nand fatuous indeed if we attempted anything of the kind. Such, briefly\r\nstated, are the main outlines of the reply which the average Socialist\r\ngives to the criticism of the class struggle doctrine described.\r\n\r\nThe class struggle theory is part of the economic interpretation of\r\nhistory. Since the dissolution of primitive tribal society, the modes of\r\neconomic production and exchange have inevitably grouped men into\r\neconomic classes. The theory is thus admirably stated by Engels in the\r\nIntroduction to the _Communist Manifesto_:--\r\n\r\n\"In every historical epoch, the prevailing mode of economic production\r\nand exchange, and the social organization necessarily following from it,\r\nform the basis upon which is built up, and from which alone can be\r\nexplained, the political and intellectual history of that epoch; and,\r\nconsequently, the whole history of mankind (since the dissolution of\r\nprimitive society, holding land in common ownership) has been a history\r\nof class struggles, contests between exploiting and exploited, ruling\r\nand oppressed classes; that the history of these class struggles forms a\r\nseries of evolution in which, nowadays, a stage has been reached where\r\nthe exploited and oppressed class--the proletariat--cannot attain its\r\nemancipation from the sway of the exploiting and ruling class--the\r\nbourgeoise--without, at the same time, and once and for all,\r\nemancipating society at large from all exploitation, oppression, class\r\ndistinctions, and class struggles.\"[116]\r\n\r\nIn this classic statement of the theory, there are several fundamental\r\npropositions. First, that class divisions and class struggles arise out\r\nof the economic life of society. Second, that since the dissolution of\r\nprimitive tribal society, which was communistic in character, mankind\r\nhas been divided into economic groups or classes, and all its history\r\nhas been a history of struggles between these classes, ruling and ruled,\r\nexploiting and exploited, being forever at war with each other. Third,\r\nthat the different epochs in human history, stages in the evolution of\r\nsociety, have been characterized by the interests of the ruling class.\r\nFourth, that a stage has now been reached in the evolution of society\r\nwhere the struggle assumes a form which makes it impossible for class\r\ndistinctions and class struggles to continue if the exploited and\r\noppressed class, the proletariat, succeeds in emancipating itself. In\r\nother words, the cycle of class struggles which began with the\r\ndissolution of rude, tribal communism, and the rise of private property,\r\nends with the passing of private property in the means of social\r\nexistence and the rise of Socialism. The proletariat in emancipating\r\nitself destroys all the conditions of class rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, slavery is historically the first system of\r\nclass division which presents itself. Some ingenious writers have\r\nendeavored to trace the origin of slavery to the institution of the\r\nfamily, the children being the first slaves. It is fairly certain,\r\nhowever, that slavery originated in conquest. When a tribe was conquered\r\nand enslaved by some more powerful tribe, all the members of the\r\nvanquished tribe sunk to one common level of servility and degradation.\r\nTheir exploitation as laborers was the principal object of their\r\nenslavement, and their labor admitted of little gradation. It is easy to\r\nsee the fundamental class antagonisms which characterized slavery. Has\r\nthere been no uprisings of the slaves, no active and conscious struggle\r\nagainst their masters, the antagonism of interests between them and\r\ntheir masters would be none the less apparent. But the overthrow of\r\nslavery was not the result of the rebellions and struggles of the\r\nslaves. While these undoubtedly helped, the principal factors in the\r\noverthrow of chattel slavery as the economic foundation of society were\r\nthe disintegration of the system to the point of bankruptcy, and the\r\nrise of a new, and sometimes, as in the case of Rome, alien ruling\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe class divisions of feudal society are not less obvious than those of\r\nchattel slavery. The main division, the widest gulf, divided the feudal\r\nlord and the serf. Often as brutally ill-treated as their\r\nslave-forefathers had been, the feudal serfs from time to time made\r\nabortive struggles. The class distinctions of feudalism were constant,\r\nbut the struggles between the lords and the serfs were sporadic, and of\r\ncomparatively little moment, just as the risings of their slave\r\nforefathers had been. But alongside of the feudal estate there existed\r\nanother class, the free handicraftsmen and peasants, the former\r\norganized into powerful guilds. It was this class, and not the serf\r\nclass, which was destined to challenge the rule of the feudal nobility,\r\nand wage war upon it. As the feudal class was a landed class, so the\r\nclass represented by the guilds became a moneyed and commercial class,\r\nthe pioneers of our modern capitalist class. As Mr. Brooks Adams[117]\r\nhas shown very clearly, it was this moneyed, commercial class, which\r\ngave to the king the instrument for weakening and finally overthrowing\r\nfeudalism. It was this class which built up the cities and towns from\r\nwhich was drawn the revenue for the maintenance of a standing army, thus\r\nliberating the king from his dependence upon the feudal lords. The\r\ncapitalist class triumphed over the feudal nobility, and its interests\r\nbecame in their turn the dominant interests in society. Capitalism in\r\nits development effectually destroyed all those institutions of\r\nfeudalism which obstructed its progress, leaving only those which were\r\ninnocuous and safely to be ignored.\r\n\r\nIn capitalist society, the main class division is that which separates\r\nthe employing, wage-paying class from the employed, wage-receiving\r\nclass. Notwithstanding all the elaborate arguments made to prove the\r\ncontrary, the frequently heard myth that the interests of Capital and\r\nLabor are identical, and the existence of pacificatory associations\r\nbased upon that myth, there is no fact in the whole range of social\r\nphenomena more self-evident than the existence of an inherent,\r\nfundamental antagonism in the relationship of employer and employee. As\r\nindividuals, in all other relations, they may have a commonality of\r\ninterests, but as employer and employee they are fundamentally and\r\nnecessarily opposed. They may belong to the same church, and so have\r\nreligious interests in common; they may have common racial interests,\r\nas, for instance, if negroes, in protecting themselves against the\r\nattacks made in a book like _The Clansman_, or, if Jews, in opposing\r\nanti-Semitic movements; as citizens they may have the same civic\r\ninterests, be equally opposed to graft in the city government, or\r\nequally interested in the adoption of wise sanitary precautions against\r\nepidemics. They may even have a common industrial interest in the\r\ngeneral sense that they may be equally interested in the development of\r\nthe industry in which they are engaged, and fear, equally, the results\r\nof a depression in trade. But their special interests as employer and\r\nemployee are antithetical.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that, in certain circumstances, these other\r\ninterests may become so accentuated that the class antagonisms are\r\nmomentarily lost sight of, or completely dwarfed in importance; nor is\r\nsuch a denial implied in the Socialist theory. It is not difficult to\r\nsee that in the case of a general uprising against the members of their\r\nrace, in which their lives are imperiled, Jewish employers and employees\r\nmay forget their _class_ interests and remember only that they are Jews.\r\nSo with negroes and other oppressed races. The economic interests of the\r\nclass may be engulfed in the solidarity of the race. It is not\r\ndifficult, either, to see that in the presence of some great common\r\ndanger or calamity, class interests may likewise be completely\r\nsubordinated. An admirable example of this occurred at the time of the\r\nSan Francisco earthquake and fire. The enormous demand for labor\r\noccasioned by that disaster practically enabled the artisans, most of\r\nwhom were organized into unions, to demand and obtain almost fabulous\r\nwages. But there was no thought of taking advantage of the calamity. On\r\nthe contrary, the unions immediately announced that they would make no\r\nattempt to do so. Not only that, but they voluntarily waived rules which\r\nin normal times they would have insisted upon with all their powers. The\r\ntemporary overshadowing of the economic interests of classes by other\r\nspecial interests which have been thrust into special prominence, is\r\nnot, however, evidence that these class interests do not prevail in\r\nnormal times. Recognition of this fact effectually destroys much\r\ncriticism of the theory.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the wage-worker, as wage-worker, is to receive the\r\nlargest wage possible for the least number of hours spent in labor. The\r\ninterest of the employer, as employer, on the other hand, is to secure\r\nfrom the worker as many hours of service, as much labor power, as\r\npossible for the lowest wage which the worker can be induced to accept.\r\nThe workers employed in a factory may be divided by a hundred different\r\nforces. They may be divided by racial differences, for instance; but\r\nwhile preserving these differences in a large measure, they will tend to\r\nunite upon the basis of their economic interests. Some of the great\r\nlabor unions, notably the United Mine Workers,[118] afford remarkable\r\nillustrations of this fact. If the difference of religious interests\r\nleads to division, the same unanimity of economic interests will sooner\r\nor later be developed. No impartial investigator who studies the\r\ninfluence of a great labor union which includes in its membership\r\nworkers of various nationalities and adherents of various religious\r\ncreeds, can fail to observe the fact that the community of economic\r\ninterests which unites them is a powerful factor making for their\r\namalgamation into a harmonious civic whole.\r\n\r\nWith the employers it is the same. They, too, may be divided by a\r\nhundred forces; the competition among them may be keen and fierce, but\r\ncommon economic interests will tend to unite them against the\r\norganizations of the workers they employ. Racial, religious, social, and\r\nother divisions and distinctions, may be maintained, but they will, in\r\ngeneral, unite for the protection and furtherance of their common\r\neconomic interests.\r\n\r\nSo much, indeed, belongs to the very primer stage of economic theory.\r\nAdam Smith is rather out of fashion nowadays, but there is still much in\r\n\"The Wealth of Nations\" which will repay our attention. No Socialist\r\nwriter, not even Marx, has stated the fundamental principle of the\r\nantagonism between the employing and employed classes more clearly, as\r\nwitness the following:--\r\n\r\n\"The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to give as little as\r\npossible. The former are disposed to combine in order to raise, the\r\nlatter in order to lower the wages of labor.... Masters are always and\r\neverywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform, combination,\r\nnot to raise the wages of labor above their actual rate. To violate this\r\ncombination is everywhere a most unpopular action, and a sort of\r\nreproach to a master among his neighbors and equals.... Masters too\r\nsometimes enter into particular combinations to sink the wages of\r\nlabor.... These are always conducted with the utmost silence and\r\nsecrecy, till the moment of execution.... Such combinations, however,\r\nare frequently resisted by a contrary defensive combination of the\r\nworkmen; who sometimes, too, without any provocation of this kind,\r\ncombine of their own accord to raise the price of labor. Their usual\r\npretenses are, sometimes the high price of provisions; sometimes the\r\ngreat profits which the masters make by their work. But whether these\r\ncombinations be offensive or defensive, they are always abundantly heard\r\nof. In order to bring the point to a speedy decision, they have always\r\nrecourse to the loudest clamor, and sometimes to the most shocking\r\nviolence and outrage. They are desperate, and act with the extravagance\r\nand folly of desperate men, who must either starve, or frighten their\r\nmasters into an immediate compliance with their demands. The masters\r\nupon these occasions are just as clamorous upon the other side, and\r\n_never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil magistrate,\r\nand the rigorous execution of those laws which have been enacted with so\r\nmuch severity against the combinations of servants, laborers, and\r\njourneymen_.\"[119]\r\n\r\nThus Adam Smith. Were it essential to our present purpose, it would be\r\neasy to quote from all the great economists in support of the Socialist\r\nclaim that the interests of the capitalist and those of the laborer are\r\nirreconcilably opposed. That individual workers and employers will be\r\nfound who do not recognize their class interests is true, but that fact\r\nby no means invalidates the contention that, in general, men will\r\nrecognize and unite upon a basis of common class interests. In both\r\nclasses are to be found individuals who attach greater importance to the\r\npreservation of racial, religious, or social, than to economic,\r\ninterests. But because the economic interest is fundamental, involving\r\nthe very basis of life, the question of food, clothing, shelter, and\r\ncomfort, these individuals are and must be exceptions to the general\r\nrule. Workers sink their racial and religious differences and unite to\r\nsecure better wages, a reduction of their hours of labor, and better\r\nconditions in general. Employers, similarly, unite to oppose whatever\r\nmay threaten their class interests, without regard to other\r\nrelationships. The Gentile who is himself an anti-Semite has no qualms\r\nof conscience about employing Jewish workmen, at low wages, to compete\r\nwith Gentile workers; he does not object to joining with Jewish\r\nemployers in an Employers' Association, if thereby his economic\r\ninterests may be safeguarded. And the Jewish employer, likewise, has no\r\nobjection to joining with the Gentile employer for mutual protection, or\r\nto the employment of Gentile workers to fill the places of his\r\nemployees, members of his own race, who have gone out on strike for\r\nhigher wages.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe class struggle, therefore, presents itself in the present stage of\r\nsocial development, in capitalist countries, as a conflict between the\r\nwage-paying and the wage-paid classes. That is the dominating and\r\nall-absorbing conflict of the industrial age in which we live. True,\r\nthere are other class interests more or less involved. This is\r\nespecially true in the United States with its enormous agricultural\r\nindustry, to which the description of the industrial conflict cannot be\r\napplied. There are the indefinite, inchoate, vague, and uncertain\r\ninterests of that large, so-called middle class, composed of farmers,\r\nretailers, professional workers, and so on. The interests of this large\r\nclass are not, and cannot be, as definitely defined. They vacillate,\r\nconforming now to the interest of the wage-workers, now to the interest\r\nof the employers. Thus the farmer may oppose an increase in the wages of\r\nfarm laborers, because that touches him directly as an employer. His\r\nrelation to the farm laborer is substantially that of the capitalist to\r\nthe city worker, and his attitude upon that question is the attitude of\r\nthe capitalist class as a whole. At the same time, he may heartily favor\r\nan increase of wages for miners, carpenters, bricklayers, shoemakers,\r\nprinters, painters, factory workers, and non-agricultural laborers in\r\ngeneral, for the reason that while a general rise of wages, resulting in\r\na general rise of prices, will affect him slightly as a consumer, and\r\ncompel him to pay more for what he buys, it will benefit him much more\r\nas a seller of the products of his farm. In short, consciously very\r\noften, but unconsciously oftener still, personal or class interests\r\ncontrol our thoughts, opinions, beliefs, and actions.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible with the data at our disposal at present to make such\r\nan analysis of our population as will enable us to determine the\r\nparticular class interests of the various groups. Of the twenty-four\r\nmillion men and boys engaged in industry there are some six million\r\nfarmers and tenants; three million seven hundred and fifty thousand farm\r\nlaborers; eleven million mechanics, laborers, clerks, and servants; one\r\nmillion five hundred thousand professional workers, agents, and the\r\nlike; and about two million employers, large and small. Accurately to\r\nplace each of these groups is out of the question until such time as we\r\nhave a much more detailed study of our economic life than has yet been\r\nattempted. We may, however, roughly relate some of the groups.\r\n\r\nFirst: It is evident that the interests of the eleven million\r\nwage-earners are, as a whole, opposed to those of the employing class.\r\nThere may be exceptions, as in the case of those whose very occupation\r\nas confidential agents of the capitalists, overseers, and the like,\r\nplaces them outside of the sphere of working-class interests. They may\r\nnot receive a salary much above the wage of the mechanic, yet their\r\nfunction is such as to place them psychologically with the capitalists\r\nrather than with the workers. It is also evident that, while their\r\n_interests_ may be demonstrably antagonistic to those of the employers,\r\nnot all of the wage-earners will be _conscious_ of that fact. The\r\n_consciousness_ of class interests develops slowly among rural and\r\nisolated workers, especially as between the small employer and his\r\nemployee. And even when there is the consciousness of antagonistic\r\ninterests among these workers it is very difficult for them actively to\r\nexpress it. Hence they cannot play an important part in the actual\r\nconflict of classes.\r\n\r\nSecond: We may safely place the three million seven hundred and fifty\r\nthousand farm laborers, as regards their economic _interests_, with the\r\ngeneral mass of wage-workers, with one important qualification. So far\r\nas they are in the actual relation of wage-paid laborers, hired by the\r\nmonth, week, or day, and bearing no other relation to their employers,\r\nthey belong, in their economic interests, to the proletariat. But there\r\nare many farm laborers included in our enumeration who do not hold that\r\nrelation to their employers. They are the sons of the farmers\r\nthemselves, expecting to assume their fathers' positions, and their\r\nposition as wage-paid laborers is largely nominal and fictitious. How\r\nmany such there are it is impossible to ascertain with anything like\r\ncertainty, and we can only say, therefore, that the position of the\r\nclass, as such, must be determined without including these. But while\r\nthis class has economic interests similar to those of the industrial\r\nproletariat, because of their isolation and scattered position, and\r\nbecause of the personal relations which they bear to their\r\nemployers--farmer and laborer often working side by side, equally hard,\r\nand not infrequently having approximately the same standards of\r\nliving--these cannot, to any very great extent, become an active factor\r\nin the class conflict in the same sense as the industrial wage-workers\r\ncan, by engaging in strikes, boycotts, and other manifestations of the\r\nclass war. Still, they may, and in fact do, play an important role in\r\nthe _political_ aspects of the struggle. Let a political movement of the\r\nproletariat arise and it will be found that these agricultural laborers\r\nwill join it not less enthusiastically than their fellows from the\r\nfactories in the cities. It would probably surprise most thoughtful\r\nAmericans if they could see the organization maps in the offices of the\r\nSocialist Party of the United States, dotted with little red-capped pins\r\ndenoting local organizations of the party. These are quite as common in\r\nthe agricultural states as in the industrial states. So, too, in\r\nGermany. The movement is politically nearly as strong in the agrarian\r\ndistricts as elsewhere. This is a fact of vital significance, one which\r\nmust not be lost sight of in studying the progress of Socialism in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThird: Of the exact position of the remaining groups it is very\r\ndifficult to speak with anything like assurance. In an earlier chapter\r\nwe have noticed the persistence of the small farm in America, and the\r\nfact that a class of small farmers forms a very important part of our\r\npopulation. As already observed, the economic condition of the small\r\nfarmer is very often little, if any, superior to that of the laborers he\r\nemploys. Elsewhere, I have shown that the actual income of the small\r\nfarmer is not infrequently less than that of the hired laborer.[120]\r\nThis is just as true of the small dealer, and the small manufacturer.\r\nBut mere poverty of income, companionship in misery, the sharing of an\r\nequally poor existence, does not suffice to place the farmer in the\r\nproletarian class, as many Socialist writers have shown.[121] The small\r\nfarmers constitute a distinct class. They are not, as the small dealers\r\nand manufacturers are, mere remnants of a disappearing class. The class\r\nis a permanent one, apparently, as much so as the class of industrial\r\nwage-workers. As a class it is just as essential to agricultural\r\nproduction as the industrial proletariat is essential to manufacture. It\r\nis thus a class analogous to the industrial proletariat, and Kautsky has\r\nwell said that the small farmer is the \"proletariat of the country.\" The\r\nexploitation of the small farmer is not direct, like that of the\r\nwage-worker by his employer, but indirect, through the great capitalist\r\ntrusts and railroads. It also happens that these derive their chief\r\nincome from the direct exploitation of the wage-workers, so that the\r\nsmall farmer and the wage-worker in the city factory have common\r\nexploiters. As they become conscious of this, the two classes will tend\r\nto unite their forces in the one sphere where such unity of action is\r\npossible, the sphere of political action.\r\n\r\nThis is also true, in some degree at least, of a considerable fraction\r\nof the one million five hundred thousand workers included in the\r\nprofessional and agent classes, and of the two million employers, the\r\nsmall dealers and manufacturers being included in this enumeration. That\r\nthere is such a considerable fraction of each of these two classes whose\r\ninterests lead them to make common cause with the proletariat is not at\r\nall a matter of theory or speculation, but of experience. These classes\r\nare represented very largely in the membership of the Socialist parties\r\nof this country and of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAlthough it is sometimes so interpreted, the theory that classes are\r\nbased upon commonality of interests does not imply that men are never\r\nactuated by other than selfish motives; that a sordid materialism is the\r\nonly motive force at work in the world. Marx and Engels carefully\r\navoided the use of the word _interests_ in such manner as to suggest\r\nthat material interests control the course of history. They invariably\r\nused the term _economic conditions_, and the careful reader will not\r\nfail to perceive that although economic conditions produce interests\r\nwhich form the basis of class divisions, it is not unusual for men to\r\nact contrary to their personal _interests_ as a result of existing\r\n_conditions_. In general, class interests and personal interests\r\ncoincide, but there are certainly occasions when they conflict. Many an\r\nemployer, having no quarrel with his employees and confident that he\r\nwill be the loser thereby, joins in a fight upon labor unions because he\r\nis conscious that the interests of his class are involved. In a similar\r\nway, workingmen enter upon sympathetic strikes, consciously, at an\r\nimmediate loss to themselves, because they place class loyalty before\r\npersonal gain. It is significant of class feeling and temper that when\r\nemployers act in this manner, and lock out employees with whom they have\r\nno trouble, simply to help other employers to win their battles, they\r\nare lauded by the very newspapers which denounce the workers when they\r\nadopt a like policy.\r\n\r\nIt is also true that there are individuals in both classes who never\r\nbecome conscious of their class interests, and steadfastly refuse to\r\njoin with the members of their class. The workingman who refuses to join\r\na union, or who \"scabs\" when his fellow-workers go out on strike, may\r\nact from ignorance or from sheer self-interest and greed. His action may\r\nbe due to his placing personal interest before the larger interest of\r\nhis class, or from being too shortsighted to see that ultimately his own\r\ninterests and those of his class must merge. Many an employer, likewise,\r\nmay refuse to join in any concerted action of his class for either of\r\nthese reasons, or he may even rise superior to his class and personal\r\ninterests and support the workers because he believes in the justness of\r\ntheir cause, realizing perfectly well that their gain means loss to him\r\nor to his class. This ought to be a sufficient answer to those shallow\r\ncritics who think that they dispose of the class struggle theory of\r\nmodern Socialism by enumerating those of its leading exponents who do\r\nnot belong to the proletariat.\r\n\r\nThe influence of class environment upon men's beliefs and ideals is a\r\nsubject which our most voluminous ethicists have scarcely touched upon\r\nas yet. It is a commonplace saying that each age has its own standards\r\nof right and wrong, but little effort has been made, if we except the\r\nSocialists, to trace this fact to its source, to the economic conditions\r\nprevailing in the different ages.[122] Still less effort has been made\r\nto account for the different standards held by the different social\r\nclasses at the same time, and by which each class judges the others. In\r\nour own day the idea of slavery is generally held in abhorrence. There\r\nwas a time, however, when it was almost universally looked upon as a\r\ndivine institution, alike by slaveholder and slave. It is simply\r\nimpossible to account for this complete revolution of feeling upon any\r\nother hypothesis than that slave-labor then seemed absolutely essential\r\nto the life of the world. The slave lords of antiquity, and, more\r\nrecently, the Southern slaveholders in our own country, all believed\r\nthat slavery was eternally right. When the slaves took an opposite view\r\nand rebelled, they were believed to be in rebellion against God and\r\nnature. The Church represented the same view just as vigorously as it\r\nnow opposes it. The slave owners who held slavery to be a divine\r\ninstitution, and the priests and ministers who supported them, were just\r\nas honest and sincere in their belief as we are in holding antagonistic\r\nbeliefs to-day.\r\n\r\nWhat was accounted a virtue in the slave was accounted a vice in the\r\nslaveholder. Cowardice and a cringing humility were not regarded as\r\nfaults in a slave. On the contrary, they were the stock virtues of the\r\npattern slave and added to the estimation in which he was held, just as\r\nsimilar traits are valued in personal servants--butlers, waiters,\r\nvalets, footmen, and other flunkies--in our own day. But similar traits\r\nin the slaveholder, or the \"gentleman\" of to-day, would be regarded as\r\nterrible faults. As Mr. Algernon Lee very tersely puts it, \"The slave\r\nwas not a slave because of his slavish ideals and beliefs; the slave was\r\nslavish in his ideals and beliefs because he lived the life of a\r\nslave.\"[123]\r\n\r\nIn the industrial world of to-day we find a similar divergence of\r\nethical standards. What the laborers regard as wrong, the employers\r\nregard as absolutely and immutably right. The actions of the workers in\r\nforming unions and compelling unwilling members of their own class to\r\njoin them, even resorting to the bitter expedient of striking against\r\nthem with a view to starving them into submission, seem terribly unjust\r\nto the employers and the class to which the employers belong. To the\r\nworkers themselves, on the other hand, such actions have all the\r\nsanctions of conscience. Similarly, many actions of the employers, in\r\nwhich they themselves see no wrong, seem almost incomprehensibly wicked\r\nto the workers.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the wholesale fraud of our ordinary commercial\r\nadvertisements, the shameful adulteration of goods, and a multitude of\r\nother such nefarious practices, it is at once interesting and\r\ninstructive to compare the employers' denunciations of \"the outrageous\r\ninfringement of personal liberty,\" when the \"oppressor\" is a labor\r\nunion, with some of their everyday practices. The same employers who\r\nloudly, and, let it be said, quite sincerely, condemn the members of a\r\nunion who endeavor to bring about the discharge of a fellow-worker\r\nbecause he declines to join their organization, have no scruples of\r\nconscience about discharging a worker simply because he belongs to a\r\nunion, and so effectually \"blacklisting\" him that it becomes almost or\r\nquite impossible for him to obtain employment at his trade elsewhere.\r\nThey do not hesitate to do this secretly, conspiring against the very\r\nlife of the worker. While loudly declaiming against the \"conspiracy\" of\r\nthe workers to raise wages, they see no wrong in an \"agreement\" of\r\nmanufacturers or mine owners to reduce wages. If the members of a labor\r\nunion should break the law, especially if they should commit an act of\r\nviolence during a strike, the organs of capitalist opinion teem with\r\ndenunciation, but there is no breath of condemnation for the outrages\r\ncommitted by employers or their agents against union men and their\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nDuring the great anthracite coal strike of 1903, and again during the\r\ndisturbances in Colorado in 1904, it was evident to every fair-minded\r\nobserver that the mine owners were at least quite as lawless as the\r\nstrikers.[124] But there was hardly a scintilla of adverse comment upon\r\nthe mine owners' lawlessness in the organs of capitalist opinion, while\r\nthey poured forth torrents of righteous indignation at the lawlessness\r\nof the miners. When labor leaders, like the late Sam Parks, for example,\r\nare accused of extortion and receiving bribes, the employers and their\r\nretainers, through pulpit, press, and every other avenue of public\r\nopinion, denounce the culprit, the bribe taker, in unmeasured terms--but\r\nthe bribe giver is excused, or, at worst, only lightly criticised. These\r\nare but a few common illustrations of class conscience. Any careful\r\nobserver will be able to add almost indefinitely to the number.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to compile a catalogue of such examples as these from\r\nthe history of the past few years sufficient to convince the most\r\nskeptical that class interests do produce a class conscience. Mr. Ghent\r\naptly expresses a profound truth when he says: \"There is a spiritual\r\nalchemy which transmutes the base metal of self-interest into the gold\r\nof conscience; the transmutation is real, and the resulting frame of\r\nmind is not hypocrisy, but conscience. It is a class conscience, and\r\ntherefore partial and imperfect, having little to do with absolute\r\nethics. But partial and imperfect as it is, it is generally\r\nsincere.\"[125] No better test of the truth of this can be made than by\r\nreading carefully for a few weeks the comments of half a dozen\r\nrepresentative capitalist newspapers, and of an equal number of\r\nrepresentative labor papers, upon current events. The antithetical\r\nnature of their judgments of men and events demonstrates the existence\r\nof a distinct class conscience. It cannot be interpreted in any other\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nA great many people, while admitting the important role class struggles\r\nhave played in the history of the race, strenuously deny the existence\r\nof classes in the United States. They freely admit the class divisions\r\nand struggles of the Old World, but deny that a similar class antagonism\r\nexists in this country; they fondly believe the United States to be a\r\nglorious exception to the rule, and regard the claim that classes exist\r\nhere as falsehood and treason. The Socialists are forever being accused\r\nof seeking to apply to American life judgments based upon European facts\r\nand conditions. It is easy to visualize the class divisions of\r\nmonarchical countries, where there are hereditary ruling classes--even\r\nthough these are only nominally the ruling classes in most cases--fixed\r\nby law. But it is not so easy to recognize the fact that, even in these\r\ncountries, the power is held by the financial and industrial lords, and\r\nnot by the kings and their titular nobility. The absence of a\r\nhereditary, titular ruling class serves to hide from many people the\r\nreal class divisions existing in this country.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is a perceptible growth of uneasiness and unrest; a\r\nwidening and deepening conviction that while we may retain the outward\r\nforms of democracy, and shout its shibboleths with patriotic fervor,\r\nits essentials are lacking. The feeling spreads, even in the most\r\nconservative circles, that we are developing, or have already developed,\r\na distinct ruling class. The anomaly of a ruling class without legal\r\nsanction or titular prestige has seized upon the popular mind; titles\r\nhave been created for our great \"untitled nobility\"--mock titles which\r\nhave speedily assumed a serious import and meaning. Our financial\r\n\"Kings,\" industrial \"Lords,\" \"Barons,\" and so on, have received their\r\ncrowns and patents of nobility from the populace. President Roosevelt\r\ngives expression to the serious thought of our most conservative\r\ncitizenry when he says: \"In the past, the most direful among the\r\ninfluences which have brought about the downfall of republics has ever\r\nbeen the growth of the class spirit.... If such a spirit grows up in\r\nthis republic, it will ultimately prove fatal to us, as in the past it\r\nhas proven fatal to every community in which it has become\r\ndominant.\"[126]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the chattel slaves, we have had no hereditary\r\nclass in this country with a legally fixed status. But\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Man is more than constitutions,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand there are other laws than those formulated in senates and recorded\r\nin statute books. The vast concentration of industry and wealth,\r\nresulting in immense fortunes on the one hand, and terrible poverty on\r\nthe other, has separated the two classes by a chasm as deep and wide as\r\never yawned between czar and moujik, kaiser and vagrant, prince and\r\npauper, feudal baron and serf. The immensity of the power and wealth\r\nthus concentrated into the hands of the few, to be inherited by their\r\nsons and daughters, tends to establish this class division hereditarily.\r\nHeretofore, passage from the lower class to the class above has been\r\ncomparatively easy, and it has blinded people to the existing class\r\nantagonisms, though, as Mr. Ghent justly observes, it should no more be\r\ntaken to disprove the existence of classes than the fact that so many\r\nthousands of Germans come to this country to settle is taken to disprove\r\nthe existence of the German Empire.[127] The stereotyping of classes is\r\nundeniable. That a few men pass from one class to another is no disproof\r\nof this. The classes exist and the tendency is for them to remain\r\npermanently fixed, as a whole, in our social life.\r\n\r\nBut passage from the lower class to the upper tends to become, if not\r\nabsolutely impossible and unthinkable, at least practically impossible,\r\nand as difficult and rare as the transition from pauperism to princedom\r\nin the Old World is. A romantic European princess may marry a penurious\r\ncoachman, and so provide the world with a nine days' sensation, but\r\nsuch cases are no rarer in the royal courts of Europe than in our own\r\nplutoaristocratic court circles. Has there ever been a king in modern\r\ntimes with anything like the power of Mr. Rockefeller? Is any feature of\r\nroyal recognition withheld from Mr. Morgan when he goes abroad in state,\r\nan uncrowned king, fraternizing with crowned but envious fellow-kings?\r\nThe existence of classes in America to-day is as evident as the\r\nexistence of America itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAntagonisms of class interests have existed from the very beginning of\r\ncivilization, though not always recognized. It is only the consciousness\r\nof their existence, and the struggle which results from that\r\nconsciousness, that are new. As we suddenly become aware of the pain and\r\nravages of disease, when we have not felt or heeded its premonitory\r\nsymptoms, so, having neglected the fundamental class division of\r\nsociety, the bitterness of the strife resulting therefrom shocks and\r\nalarms us. So long as it is possible for the stronger and more ambitious\r\nmembers of an inferior class to rise out of that class and join the\r\nranks of a superior class, so long will the struggle which ensues as the\r\nnatural outgrowth of opposing interests be postponed.\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently, in the United States, this has been possible.\r\nTransition from the status of wage-worker to that of capitalist has been\r\neasy. But with the era of concentration and the immense capitals\r\nrequired for industrial enterprise, and the exhaustion of our supply of\r\nfree land, these transitions become fewer and more difficult, and class\r\nlines tend to become permanently fixed. The stronger and more ambitious\r\nmembers of the lower class, finding it impossible to rise into the class\r\nabove, thus become impressed with a consciousness of their class status.\r\nThe average worker no longer dreams of himself becoming an employer\r\nafter a few years of industry and thrift. The ambitious and aggressive\r\nfew no longer look with the contempt of the strong for the weak upon\r\ntheir less aggressive fellow-workers, but become leaders, preachers of a\r\nsignificant and admittedly dangerous gospel of class consciousness.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt has assailed the preachers of class consciousness\r\nwith all the energy of a confirmed moralizer. It is evident, however,\r\nthat he has never taken the trouble to study either the preachers or\r\ntheir gospel. Never in his utterances has there been any hint given of a\r\nrecognition of the fact that there could be no preaching of class\r\nconsciousness had there been no classes. Never has he manifested the\r\nfaintest recognition of the existence of conditions which develop\r\nclasses, out of which the class consciousness of the propagandists\r\nsprings naturally. He does not see that there is danger only when the\r\npreachers are not wise enough, nor sufficiently educated to see their\r\nposition in its historical perspective; when in blind revolt they\r\nengender class hatred, personal hatred of the capitalist by the worker.\r\nBut when there is the historical perspective, wisdom to see that\r\neconomic conditions develop slowly, and that the capitalist is no more\r\nresponsible for conditions than the worker, there is not only no\r\npersonal hatred for the capitalist engendered, but, more important\r\nstill, the workers get a new view of the relationship of the classes,\r\nand their efforts are directed to the bringing about of peaceful change.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists, accused as they are of seeking to stir up hatred and\r\nstrife, by placing the class struggle in its proper light, as one of the\r\ngreat social dynamic forces, have done and are doing more to allay\r\nhatred and bitterness of feeling, and to save the world from the red\r\ncurse of anarchistic vengeance, than all the Rooseveltian preaching in\r\nwhich thousands of venders of moral platitudes are engaged. The\r\nSocialist movement is vastly more powerful as a force against Anarchism,\r\nin its violent manifestations, than any other agency in the world.\r\nWherever, as in Germany, the Socialist movement is strong, Anarchism is\r\nimpotent and weak. The reason for this is the very obvious one here\r\ngiven. Class divisions are not created by Socialists, but developed in\r\nthe womb of economic conditions. Class consciousness is not something\r\nwhich Socialism has developed. Before there was a Socialist movement, in\r\nthe days of Luddite attacks upon machinery, and Captain Swing's\r\nrick-burners, there was class consciousness expressed in class revolt.\r\nModern Socialism simply takes the class consciousness of the worker and\r\neducates it to see the futility of machine-destroying, or other foolish\r\nand abortive attacks upon capitalists and their property, and organizes\r\nit into a political movement for the peaceful transformation of society.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nNowhere in the world, at any time in its history, has the antagonism of\r\nclasses been more evident than in the United States at the present time.\r\nWith an average of over a thousand strikes a year,[128] some of them\r\ninvolving, directly, tens of thousands of producers, a few capitalists,\r\nand millions of noncombatants, consumers; with strikes like this,\r\nboycotts, lockouts, injunctions, and all the other incidents of\r\norganized class strife reported daily by the newspapers, denials of the\r\nexistence of classes, or of the struggle between them, are manifestly\r\nabsurd. We have, on the one hand, organizations of workers, labor\r\nunions, with a membership of something over two million in the United\r\nStates; one organization alone, the American Federation of Labor, having\r\nan affiliated membership of one million seven hundred thousand. On the\r\nother hand, we have organizations of employers, formed for the expressed\r\npurpose of fighting the labor unions, of which the National Association\r\nof Manufacturers is the most perfect type yet evolved.\r\n\r\nWhile the leaders on both sides frequently deny that their organizations\r\nbetoken the existence of a far-reaching fundamental class conflict, and,\r\nthrough ostensibly pacificatory organizations like the National Civic\r\nFederation, proclaim the \"essential identity of interests between\r\ncapital and labor\"; while an intelligent and earnest labor leader like\r\nMr. John Mitchell joins with an astute capitalist leader like the late\r\nSenator Marcus A. Hanna in declaring that \"there is no necessary\r\nhostility between labor and capital,\" that there is no \"necessary,\r\nfundamental antagonism between the laborer and the capitalist,\"[129] a\r\nbrief study of the constitutions of these class organizations, and their\r\npublished reports, in conjunction with the history of the labor struggle\r\nin the United States, in which the names of Homestead, Hazelton, Coeur\r\nd'Alene and Cripple Creek appear in bloody letters, will show these\r\ndenials to be the offspring of hypocrisy or delusion. If this\r\nmuch-talked-of unity of interests is anything but a stupid fiction, the\r\ngreat and ever increasing strife is only a matter of mutual\r\nmisunderstanding. All that is necessary to secure permanent peace is to\r\nremove that misunderstanding. If we believe this, it is a sad commentary\r\nupon human limitations, upon man's failure to understand his own life,\r\nthat not a single person on either side has arisen with sufficient\r\nintelligence and breadth of vision to state the relations of the two\r\nclasses with clarity and force enough to accomplish that end, to make\r\nthem understand each other.\r\n\r\nLet us get down to fundamental principles.[130] Why do men organize into\r\nunions? Why was the first union started? Why do men pay out of their\r\nhard-earned wages to support unions now? The first union was not started\r\nbecause the men who started it did not understand their employers, or\r\nbecause they were misunderstood by their employers. The explanation\r\ninvolves a deeper insight into things than that. When the individual\r\nworkingman, feeling that from the labor of himself and his fellows came\r\nthe wealth and luxury of his employer, demanded higher wages, a\r\nreduction of the hours of labor, or better conditions in general, he was\r\nmet with a reply from the employer--who understood the workingman's\r\nposition very well, much better, in fact, than the workingman himself\r\ndid--something like this, \"If you don't like this job, and my terms,\r\nthere are plenty of others outside ready to take your place.\" The\r\nworkingman and the employer, then, understood each other perfectly. The\r\nemployer understood the position of the worker, that he was dependent\r\nupon him, the employer, for opportunity to earn his bread. The worker\r\nunderstood that so long as the employer could discharge him and fill his\r\nplace with another, he was powerless. The combat between the workers and\r\nthe masters of their bread has from the first been an unequal one.\r\n\r\nNothing remained for the individual workingman but to join with his\r\nfellows in a collective and united effort. So organizations of workers\r\nappeared, and the employers could not treat the demands for higher wages\r\nor other improvements in conditions as lightly as before. The workers,\r\nwhen they organized, could take advantage of the fact that there were no\r\norganizations of the employers. Every strike added to the ordinary\r\nterrors of the competitive struggle for the employers. The manufacturer\r\nwhose men threatened to strike often surrendered because he feared most\r\nof all that his trade, in the event of a suspension of work, would be\r\nsnatched by his rival in business. So, by playing upon the inherent\r\nweakness of the competitive system as it affected the employers, the\r\nworkers gained many substantial advantages. There is no doubt whatsoever\r\nthat under these conditions the wage-workers got better wages, better\r\nworking conditions, and a reduction in the hours of labor. It was in\r\nmany ways the golden age of trade unionism. But there was an important\r\nlimitation of the workers' power--the unions could not absorb the man\r\noutside; they could not provide all the workers with employment. That is\r\nan essential condition of capitalist industry, there is always the\r\n\"reserve army of the unemployed,\" to use the expressive phrase of\r\nFriederich Engels. Rare indeed are the times when all the available\r\nworkers in any industry are employed, and the time has probably never\r\nyet been when all the available workers in all industries were employed.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this important limitation of power, it is\r\nincontrovertible that the workers were benefited by their organization.\r\nBut only for a time. There came a time when the employers began to\r\norganize unions also. That they called their organizations by other and\r\nhigh-sounding names does not alter the fact that they were in reality\r\nunions formed to combat the unions of the workers. Every employers'\r\nassociation is, in reality, a union of the men who employ labor against\r\nthe unions of the men they employ. When the organized workers went to\r\nindividual, unorganized employers, who feared their rivals more than\r\nthey feared the workers, or, rather, who feared the workers most of all\r\nbecause rivals waited to snatch their trade, a strike making their\r\nemployees allies with their competitors, the employers were easily\r\ndefeated. The workers could play one employer against another employer\r\nwith constant success. But when the employers also organized, it was\r\ndifferent. Then the individual employer, freed from his worst terrors,\r\ncould say, \"Do your worst. I, too, am in an organization.\" Then it\r\nbecame a battle betwixt organized capital and organized labor. When the\r\nworkers went out on strike in one shop or factory, depending upon their\r\nbrother unionists employed in other shops or factories, the employers of\r\nthese latter locked them out, thus cutting off the financial support of\r\nthe strikers. In other cases, when the workers in one place went out on\r\nstrike, the employer got his work done through other employers, by the\r\nvery fellow-members upon whom the strikers were depending for support.\r\nThus the workers were compelled to face this dilemma, either to withdraw\r\nthese men, thus cutting off their financial supplies, or to be beaten by\r\ntheir own members.\r\n\r\nUnder these changed conditions, the workers were beaten time after time.\r\nIt was a case of the worker's cupboard against the master's warehouse,\r\npurse against bank account, poverty against wealth. The workers' chances\r\nare slight in such a combat! A strike means that the employers on one\r\nside, and the workers on the other, seek to force each other to\r\nsurrender by waiting patiently to see who first feels the pinch of\r\nhardship and poverty. Employers and employees determine to play the\r\nwaiting game. Each waits patiently in the hope that the other will\r\nweaken. At last one--most often the workers'--side weakens and gives up\r\nthe struggle. When the workers are thus beaten in a strike, they are not\r\nconvinced that their demands are unreasonable or unjust; they are simply\r\nbeaten because their resources are too small to enable them to stand the\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nWhen the master class, the masters of jobs and bread, organized their\r\nforces, they set narrow and sharp boundaries to the power of labor\r\norganizations. Henceforth the chances of victory were overwhelmingly on\r\nthe side of the employers. The workers learned by bitter and costly\r\nexperience that they could not play the interests of individual\r\nemployers against other employers' interests. Meantime, too, they have\r\nlearned that they are not only exploited as producers, but also as\r\nbuyers, as consumers. For long, dominated by economic theories, the\r\nSocialists refused to recognize this aspect of the labor struggle,\r\nthough the workers felt it strongly enough. They set their fine-spun\r\ntheories against the facts of life. Their contention was that wages\r\nbeing determined by the cost of living, it mattered nothing how much or\r\nhow little the workers got in wages, the cost of living and wages\r\nadjusted themselves to each other. But in actual experience the workers\r\nfound that when prices fall, wages are _quick_ to follow, whereas when\r\nprices soar high, wages are _slow_ to follow. Wages climb with leaden\r\nfeet when prices soar with eagle wings. Because the workers are\r\nconsumers, almost to the last penny of their incomes, having to spend\r\npractically every penny earned, that form of exploitation becomes a\r\nserious matter.\r\n\r\nBut against this exploitation the unions have ever been absolutely\r\npowerless. Workingmen have never made any very serious attempt to\r\nprotect the purchasing capacity of their wages, notwithstanding its\r\ntremendous importance.[131] The result has been that not a few of the\r\n\"victories\" so dearly won by trade union action have turned out to be\r\nhollow mockeries. When better wages have been secured, prices have often\r\ngone up, most often, in fact, so that the net result has been little to\r\nthe advantage of the workers. In many cases, where the advance in wages\r\napplied only to a restricted number of trades, the advance in prices\r\nbecoming general, the total result has been against the working class as\r\na whole, and little or nothing to the advantage of the few who received\r\nthe advance in immediate wages. At this point, the need is felt of a\r\nsocial revolution, not a violent revolution, be it understood, but a\r\ncomprehensive social change which will give to the workers the control\r\nof the implements of labor, and also of the product of their labor. In\r\nother words, the demand arises for independent, working-class action,\r\naiming at the socialization of the means of production and the product.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nA line of cleavage thus presents itself between those, on the one hand,\r\nwho would continue the old methods of economic warfare, together with\r\nthe advocates of physical force, and, on the other hand, the advocates\r\nof united political action by the working class, consciously directed\r\ntoward the socialization of industry and its products. The measure of\r\nthe crystallization of this latter force is represented by the strength\r\nof the political Socialist movement. Whoever has studied the labor\r\nmovement during the past few years must have realized that there is a\r\ntremendous drift of sentiment in favor of that policy in the labor\r\nunions of the country. The clamor for political action in the labor\r\nunions presages an enormous advance of the political Socialist movement\r\nduring the next few years.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between the capitalist and working classes must become a\r\npolitical issue, the supreme political issue. This must result, not only\r\nbecause the collective ownership of property can best be brought about\r\nby political methods, but also because the capitalists themselves have\r\ntaken the industrial struggle into the political arena to suit\r\nthemselves; and when the workers realize the issue and accept it, the\r\ncapitalists will not be able to resist them. One is reminded of the\r\nsaying of Marx that capitalism produces its own gravediggers. In taking\r\nthe industrial issue into the political sphere, to suit their own\r\nimmediate advantages, the capitalists were destined to reveal to the\r\nworkers, sooner or later, their power and opportunity.\r\n\r\nRealizing that all the forces of government are on their side, the\r\nlegislative, judicial, and executive powers being controlled by their\r\nown class, the employers have made the fight against labor political as\r\nwell as economic in its character. When the workers have gone on strike\r\nand the employers have not cared to play the \"waiting game,\" choosing\r\nrather to avail themselves of the great reserve army of unemployed\r\nworkers outside, the natural resentment of the strikers, finding\r\nthemselves in danger of being beaten by members of their own class, has\r\nled to violence which has been remorselessly suppressed by all the\r\npolice and military forces at the command of the government. In many\r\ninstances, the employers have purposely provoked striking workers to\r\nviolence, and then called upon the government to crush the revolt thus\r\nmade. Workers have been shot down at the shambles in almost every state,\r\nno matter which political party has been in power. Nor have these forces\r\nof our class government been used merely to punish lawless union men and\r\nwomen on strike, to uphold the \"sacred majesty of the law,\" as the\r\nhypocritical phrase goes. They have been also used to deny strikers the\r\nrights which belonged to them, and to protect capitalists and their\r\nagents in breaking the laws. No one can read with anything like an\r\nimpartial spirit the records of the miners' strike in the Coeur\r\nd'Alene mine, Idaho, or the labor disturbances in the state of Colorado\r\nfrom 1880 to 1905 and dispute this assertion.\r\n\r\nMost important of all has been the powerful opposition of the makers and\r\ninterpreters of the law. A body of class legislation, in the interests\r\nof the employing class, has been created, while the workers have begged\r\nin vain for protective legislation. In no country of the world have the\r\ninterests of the workers been so neglected as in the United States.\r\nThere is practically no such thing as employers' liability for accidents\r\nto workers; no legislation worthy of mention relating to occupations\r\nwhich have been classified as \"dangerous\" in most industrial countries;\r\nwomen workers are sadly neglected. Whenever a law of distinct advantage\r\nto the workers in their struggle has been passed, a servile judiciary\r\nhas been ready to render it null and void by declaring it to be\r\nunconstitutional. No more powerful blows have ever been directed against\r\nthe workers than by the judiciary. Injunctions have been issued, robbing\r\nthe workers of the most elemental rights of manhood and citizenship.\r\nThey have forbidden things which no law forbids, and even things which\r\nthe Constitution and statute law declare to be legal.\r\n\r\nMr. John Mitchell refers to this subject, in strong but not too strong\r\nterms. \"No weapon,\" he says, \"has been used with such disastrous effect\r\nagainst trade unions as the injunction in labor disputes. By means of\r\nit, trade unionists have been prohibited under severe penalties from\r\ndoing what they had a legal right to do, and have been specifically\r\ndirected to do what they had a legal right not to do. It is difficult to\r\nspeak in measured tones or moderate language of the savagery and venom\r\nwith which unions have been assailed by the injunction, and to the\r\nworking classes, as to all fair-minded men, it seems little less than a\r\ncrime to condone or tolerate it.\"[132] This is strong language, but who\r\nshall say that it is too strong when we remember the many injunctions\r\nwhich have been hurled at organized labor since the famous Debs case\r\nbrought this weapon into general use?\r\n\r\nIn this celebrated case, which grew out of the Pullman strike, in 1894,\r\nEugene V. Debs, president of the American Railway Union, was arrested\r\nand arraigned on indictments of obstructing the mails and interstate\r\ncommerce. Although arraigned, he was not tried, the case being\r\nabandoned, despite his demands for a trial. President Cleveland's strike\r\ncommission subsequently declared, \"There is no evidence before the\r\ncommission that the officers of the American Railway Union at any time\r\nparticipated in or advised intimidation, violence, or destruction of\r\nproperty.\" Realizing that it had no sort of evidence upon which a jury\r\nmight be hoped to convict, a new way was found. Debs and his officers\r\nwere enjoined in a famous \"blanket\" injunction directed against Debs and\r\nall other officials of the union, and \"all persons whomsoever.\" For an\r\nalleged violation of that injunction, Judge Woods, without trial by\r\njury, sentenced Debs to six months' imprisonment and his associates to\r\nthree months'. The animus and class bias of the whole proceeding may be\r\njudged from the fact that President Cleveland selected to represent the\r\nUnited States Government, at Chicago, Mr. Edwin Walker, general counsel\r\nat that very time for the General Managers' Association, representing\r\nthe twenty-four railroads centering or terminating in Chicago. And these\r\nrailroads were operating in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Law at\r\nthe time.[133]\r\n\r\nIn 1899 an injunction was issued out of the United States Circuit Court\r\nof West Virginia against \"John Smith and others,\" without naming the\r\n\"others,\" in the interest of the Wheeling Railway Company. Two men,\r\nneither of them being John Smith, nor found to be the agent of \"John\r\nSmith and others,\" were jailed for contempt of court![134] In 1900\r\nmembers of the International Cigarmakers' Union, in New York City, were\r\nenjoined by Justice Freeman, in the Supreme Court, from even approaching\r\ntheir former employers for the purpose of attempting to arrange a\r\npeaceable settlement! The cigarmakers were further enjoined from\r\npublishing their grievances, or in any manner making their case known to\r\nthe public, if the tendency of that should be to vex the plaintiffs or\r\nmake them uneasy; from trying, even in a peaceful way, in any place in\r\nthe city, even in the privacy of a man's own home, to persuade a new\r\nemployee that he ought to sympathize with the union cause sufficiently\r\nto refuse to work for unjust employers; and, finally, the union was\r\nforbidden to pay money to its striking members to support them and their\r\nfamilies. In the great steel strike of 1901, the members of the\r\nAmalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers were enjoined from\r\npeaceably discussing the merits of their claim with the men who were at\r\nwork, even though the latter might raise no objection. In Pennsylvania,\r\nin the case of the York Manufacturing Company _vs._ Obedick, it was held\r\nthat workmen had \"no legal right\" to persuade or induce other workmen to\r\nquit, or not to accept, employment.[135] In the strike of the members of\r\nthe International Typographical Union against the Buffalo _Express_, the\r\nstrikers were enjoined from discussing the strike, or talking about the\r\npaper in any way which might be construed as being against the paper. If\r\none of the strikers advised a friend not to buy a \"scab\" paper, he was\r\nliable under the terms of that injunction to imprisonment for contempt\r\nof court. The members of the same union were, in the case of the Sun\r\nPrinting and Publishing Company _vs_. Delaney and others, enjoined by\r\nJustice Bookstaver, in the Supreme Court of New York, from publishing\r\ntheir side of the controversy with the _Sun_ as an argument why persons\r\nfriendly to organized labor should not advertise in a paper hostile to\r\nit. In 1906 members of the same union were enjoined by Supreme Court\r\nJustice Gildersleeve from \"making any requests, giving any advice, or\r\nresorting to any persuasion ... to overcome the free will of any person\r\nconnected with the plaintiff [a notorious anti-union publishing company]\r\nor its customers as employees or otherwise.\"[136]\r\n\r\nThese are only a few examples of the abuse of the injunction in labor\r\ndisputes, hundreds of which have been granted, many of them equally\r\nsubversive of all sound principles of popular government. There is\r\nprobably not another civilized country in which such judicial tyranny\r\nwould be tolerated. It is not without significance that in West\r\nVirginia, where, as a result of an outcry against a number of\r\nparticularly glaring abuses of the power to issue injunctions, the\r\nlegislature passed a law limiting the right to issue injunctions, the\r\nSupreme Court decided that the law was unconstitutional, upon the ground\r\nthat the legislature had no right to attempt to restrain the courts\r\nwhich were cooerdinate with itself.\r\n\r\nEven more dangerous to organized labor than the injunction is what is\r\npopularly known by union men as \"Taff Vale law.\" Our judges have not\r\nbeen slow to follow the example set by the English judges in the famous\r\ncase of the Taff Vale Railway Company against the officers of the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Railway Servants, a powerful labor organization.\r\nThe decision in that case was most revolutionary. It compelled the\r\nworkers to pay damages, to the extent of $115,000, to the railroad\r\ncompany for losses sustained by the company through a strike of its\r\nemployees, members of the defendant union. That decision struck terror\r\ninto the hearts of British trade unionists. At last they had to face a\r\nmode of attack even more dangerous than the injunction which their\r\ntransatlantic brethren had so long been contending against. Taff Vale\r\nlaw could not long be confined to England. Very soon, our American\r\ncourts followed the English example. A suit was instituted against the\r\nmembers of a lodge of the Machinists' Union in Rutland, Vermont, and the\r\ndefendants were ordered to pay $2500. A writ was served upon each member\r\nand the property of every one of them attached. Since that time,\r\nnumerous other decisions of a like nature have been rendered in various\r\nparts of the country. Thus the unions have been assailed in a vital\r\nplace, their treasuries. It is manifestly foolish and quite useless for\r\nthe members of a union to strike against an employer for any purpose\r\nwhatever, if the employer is to be able to recover damages from the\r\nunion. Taff Vale judge-made law renders the labor union _hors de combat_\r\nat a stroke.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of the revolutionary judicial decision in England\r\nwas to arouse the workers to the necessity for class-conscious political\r\naction. The cry went up that the unions must adopt a policy of\r\nindependent political action. There is no doubt whatever that the\r\ntremendous advance of the Socialist movement in England during the past\r\nfew years began as a result of the attack made upon the funds of the\r\nlabor unions. From the moment of the Taff Vale decision the Socialist\r\nmovement in England took rapid strides. A similar process is going on in\r\nthis country, gathering momentum with every injunction against organized\r\nlabor, every hostile enactment of legislatures, and every use of the\r\njudicial and executive powers to defeat the workers in their struggle\r\nagainst capitalism. The workers are being educated to political\r\nSocialism by the stern experiences resulting from capitalist rule.\r\nUnderneath the thin veneer of party differences, the worker sees the\r\nclass identity of the great political parties, and cries out, \"A plague\r\non both your houses!\" The Socialist argument comes to him with a twofold\r\nforce: not only does it show him how he is enslaved and exploited as a\r\nproducer, but it convinces him that as a citizen he has it in his power\r\nto control the government and make it what he will. He can put an end to\r\ngovernment by injunctions, to the use of police, state, and federal\r\ntroops to break strikes, and to the sequestration of union funds by\r\nhostile judges. He can, if he so decides, own and control the\r\ngovernment, and, through the government, own and control the essentials\r\nof life: be master of his own labor, his own bread, his own life.\r\n\r\nIf we take for granted that the universal increase of Socialist\r\nsentiment, and the growth of political Socialism, as measured by its\r\nrapidly increasing vote, presage this great triumph of the working\r\nclass; that the heretofore despised and oppressed proletariat is, in a\r\nnot far distant future, to rule instead of being ruled, the question\r\narises, will the last state be better than the first? Will society be\r\nbettered by the change of masters?\r\n\r\nThe very form of the question must be denied. It is not a movement for a\r\nchange of masters. To regard this struggle of the classes as one of\r\nrevenge, of exploited masses ready to overturn the social structure that\r\nthey may become exploiters instead of exploited, is to misread the whole\r\nmovement. The political and economic conquest of society by the working\r\nclass means the end of class divisions once and forever. A social\r\ndemocracy, a society in which all things essential to the common life\r\nand well-being are owned and controlled by the people in common,\r\ndemocratically organized, precludes the existence of class divisions in\r\nour present-day economic and political sense. Profit, through human\r\nexploitation, alone has made class divisions possible, and the Socialist\r\nregime will abolish profit. The working class, in emancipating itself,\r\nat the same time makes liberty possible for the whole race of man, and\r\ndestroys the conditions of class rule.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[116] The _Communist Manifesto_, Kerr edition, page 8.\r\n\r\n[117] In _Centralization and the Law: Scientific Legal Education, An\r\nIllustration_, edited by Melville M.

P.\r\nProudhon's _La Philosophie de la Misere_. Marx had worked out his theory\r\nat least two years before, so Engels tells us, and in his writings of\r\nthat period there are several evidences of the fact. In \"La Misere de la\r\nPhilosophie,\" the theory is fundamental to the work, and not merely the\r\nsubject of incidental allusion. This little book, all too little known\r\nin England and America, is therefore important from this historical\r\npoint of view. In it, Marx for the first time shows his complete\r\nconfidence in the theory. It needed confidence little short of sublime\r\nto challenge Proudhon in the audacious manner of this scintillating\r\ncritique. The torrential eloquence, the scornful satire, and fierce\r\ninvective of the attack, have rather tended to obscure for readers of a\r\nlater generation the real merit of the book, the importance of the\r\nfundamental idea that history must be interpreted in the light of\r\neconomic development, that economic evolution determines social life.\r\nThe book is important for two other reasons. First, it was the author's\r\nfirst serious essay in economic science--in the preface he boldly and\r\nfrankly calls himself an economist--and, second, in it appears a full\r\nand generous recognition of that brilliant coterie of English Socialist\r\nwriters of the Ricardian school from whom Marx has been unjustly, and\r\nalmost spitefully, charged with \"pillaging\" his principal ideas.\r\n\r\nWhat led Marx to launch out upon the troubled sea of economic science,\r\nwhen all his predilections were for the study of pure philosophy, was\r\nthe fact that his philosophical studies had led him to a point whence\r\nfurther progress seemed impossible, except by way of economics. The\r\nIntroduction to \"A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy\"\r\nmakes this perfectly clear. Having decided that \"the method of\r\nproduction in material existence conditions social, political, and\r\nmental evolution in general,\" a study of economics, and especially an\r\nanalysis of modern industrial society, became inevitable. During the\r\nyear 1845, when the theory of the economic interpretation of history was\r\nabsorbing his attention, Marx spent six weeks in England with his\r\nfriend Engels, and became acquainted with the work of the Ricardian\r\nSocialists already referred to.[138] Engels had been living in England\r\nabout three years at this time, and had made an exhaustive investigation\r\nof industrial conditions there, and become intimately acquainted with\r\nthe leaders of the Chartist movement. His fine library contained most of\r\nthe works of contemporary writers, and it was thus that Marx came to\r\nknow them.\r\n\r\nForemost of this school of Socialists which had arisen, quite naturally,\r\nin the land where capitalism flourished at its best, were William\r\nGodwin, Charles Hall, William Thompson, John Gray, Thomas Hodgskin, and\r\nJohn Francis Bray. With the exception of Hall, of whose privately\r\nprinted book, \"The Effects of Civilisation on the People of the European\r\nStates,\" 1805, he seems not to have known, Marx was familiar with the\r\nwritings of all the foregoing, and his obligations to some of them,\r\nespecially Thompson, Hodgskin, and Bray, were not slight. While the\r\ncharge, made by Dr. Anton Menger,[139] among others, that Marx took his\r\nsurplus value theory from Thompson is quite absurd, and rests, as\r\nBernstein has pointed out, upon nothing but the fact that Thompson used\r\nthe words \"surplus value\" frequently, but not at all in the same sense\r\nas that in which Marx uses them,[140] we need not attempt to dispute the\r\nfact that Marx gleaned much of value from Thompson and the two other\r\nwriters. While criticising them, and pointing out their shortcomings,\r\nMarx himself frequently pays tributes of respect to each of them. His\r\nindebtedness to any of them, or to all of them, consists simply in the\r\nfact that he recognized the germinal truths in their writings, and saw\r\nfar beyond what they saw.\r\n\r\nGodwin's most important work, \"An Inquiry Concerning Political Justice,\"\r\nappeared in 1793, and contains the germ of much that is called Marxian\r\nSocialism. In it may be found the broad lines of the thought which marks\r\nmuch of our present-day Socialist teaching, especially the criticism of\r\ncapitalist society. Marx, however, does not appear to have been directly\r\ninfluenced by it to any extent. That he was influenced by it indirectly,\r\nthrough William Thompson, Godwin's most illustrious disciple, is,\r\nhowever, quite certain. Thompson wrote several works of a Socialist\r\ncharacter, of which \"An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution\r\nof Wealth most Conducive to Human Happiness, Applied to the newly\r\nproposed System of Voluntary Equality of Wealth,\" 1824, and \"Labour\r\nRewarded. The Claims of Labour and Capital Conciliated, or How to Secure\r\nto Labour the Whole Products of its Exertions,\" 1827, are the most\r\nimportant and best known. Thompson must be regarded as one of the\r\ngreatest precursors of Marx in the development of modern Socialist\r\ntheory. A Ricardian of the Ricardians, he states the law of wages in\r\nlanguage that is almost as emphatic as Lassalle's famous _Ehernes\r\nLohngesetz_, which Marx made the butt of his satire.[141] Accepting the\r\nview of Ricardo,--and indeed, of Adam Smith and other earlier English\r\neconomists, including Petty,--that labor is the sole source of exchange\r\nvalue,[142] he shows by cogent argument the exploitation of the laborer,\r\nand uses the term \"surplus value\" to designate the difference between\r\nthe cost of maintaining the laborer and the value of his labor product,\r\nassisted, of course, by machinery and other capital, which goes to the\r\ncapitalist. By a most labored argument, Professor Anton Menger has\r\nattempted to create the impression that Marx took, without\r\nacknowledgment, his _theory of the manner in which surplus value is\r\nproduced_ from Thompson, simply because Thompson frequently used the\r\n_term itself_.[143] Marx never claimed to have originated the term. It\r\nis to be found in the writings of earlier economists than Thompson even,\r\nand Marx quotes an anonymous pamphlet entitled _The Source and Remedy of\r\nthe National Difficulties_. _A Letter to Lord John Russell_, published\r\nin London in 1821, in which the phrase \"the quantity of the surplus\r\nvalue appropriated by the capitalist\" appears.[144] Nor did Marx claim\r\nto be the first to distinguish surplus value. That had been done very\r\nclearly by many others, including Adam Smith.[145] What is original in\r\nMarx is the explanation of the manner in which surplus value is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nJohn Gray's \"A Lecture on Human Happiness,\" published in 1825, has been\r\ndescribed by Professor Foxwell as being \"certainly one of the most\r\nremarkable of Socialist writings,\"[146] and the summary of the rare\r\nlittle work which he gives amply justifies the description. Gray\r\npublished other works of note, two of which, \"The Social System, a\r\nTreatise on the Principle of Exchange,\" 1831, and \"Lectures on the\r\nNature and Use of Money,\" 1848, Marx subjects to a rigorous criticism in\r\n\"A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.\" Thomas Hodgskin's\r\nbest-known works are \"Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital,\"\r\n1825, and \"The Natural and Artificial Right of Property Contrasted,\"\r\n1832. The former, which Marx calls \"an admirable work,\" is only a small\r\ntract of thirty-four pages, but its influence in England and America was\r\nvery great. Hodgskin was a man of great culture and erudition, with a\r\ngenius for popular writing upon difficult topics. It is interesting to\r\nknow that in a letter to his friend, Francis Place, he sketched a book\r\nwhich he proposed writing, \"curiously like Marx's 'Capital,'\" according\r\nto Place's biographer, Mr. Wallas,[147] and from which the conservative\r\nold reformer dissuaded him. John Francis Bray was a journeyman printer\r\nabout whom very little is known. His \"Labour's Wrongs and Labour's\r\nRemedy,\" published in Leeds in 1839, Marx calls \"a remarkable work,\" and\r\nin his attack upon Proudhon he quotes from it extensively to show that\r\nBray had anticipated the French writer's theories.[148]\r\n\r\nThe justification for this lengthy digression from the main theme of the\r\npresent chapter lies in the fact that so many critics have sought to\r\nfasten the charge of dishonesty upon Marx, and claimed that the ideas\r\nwith which his name is associated were taken by him, without\r\nacknowledgment, from these English Ricardians. As a matter of fact, no\r\neconomist of note ever quoted his authorities, or acknowledged his\r\nindebtedness to others, more generously than did Marx, and it is\r\nexceedingly doubtful whether even the names of the precursors whose\r\nideas he is accused of stealing would be known to his critics but for\r\nhis frank recognition of them. No candid reader of Marx can fail to\r\nnotice that he is most careful to show how nearly these writers\r\napproached the truth as he conceived it.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhen the February revolution of 1848 broke out, Marx was in Brussels.\r\nThe authorities there compelling him to leave Belgian soil, at the\r\nrequest of the Prussian government, he returned to Paris, but not for a\r\nlong stay. The revolutionary struggle in Germany stirred his blood, and\r\nwith Engels, Wilhelm Wolf, the intimate friend to whom he later\r\ndedicated the first volume of \"Capital,\" and Ferdinand Freiligrath, the\r\nfiery poet of the movement, Marx started the _New Rhenish Gazette_.\r\nUnlike the first _Rhenish Gazette_, the new journal was absolutely free\r\nfrom control by business policy. Twice Marx was summoned to appear at\r\nthe Cologne assizes, upon charges of inciting the people to rebellion,\r\nand each time he defended himself with superb audacity and skill, and\r\nwas acquitted. But in June, 1849, the authorities suppressed the paper,\r\nbecause of the support it gave to the risings in Dresden and the Rhine\r\nProvince. Marx was expelled from Prussia and once more sought a refuge\r\nin Paris, which he was allowed to enjoy only for a very brief time.\r\nForbidden by the French government to stay in Paris, or any other part\r\nof France except Brittany, which, says Liebknecht, was considered\r\n\"fireproof,\" Marx turned to London, the mecca of all political exiles,\r\narriving there toward the end of June, 1849.\r\n\r\nHis removal to London was one of the crucial events in the life of Marx.\r\nIt became possible for him, in the classic land of capitalism, to pursue\r\nhis economic studies in a way that was not possible anywhere else in the\r\nworld. As Liebknecht says: \"Here in London, the metropolis (mother city)\r\nand the center of the world, and of the world of trade--the watch tower\r\nof the world whence the trade of the world and the political and\r\neconomical bustle of the world may be observed, in a way impossible in\r\nany other part of the globe--here Marx found what he sought and needed,\r\nthe bricks and mortar for his work. 'Capital' could be created in London\r\nonly.\"[149]\r\n\r\nAlready much more familiar with English political economy than most\r\nEnglish writers of his time, and with the fine library of the British\r\nMuseum at his command, Marx felt that the time had at last arrived when\r\nhe could devote himself to his long-cherished plan of writing a great\r\ntreatise upon political economy as a secure basis for the theoretical\r\nstructure of Socialism. With this object in view, he resumed his\r\neconomic studies in 1850, soon after his arrival in London. The work\r\nproceeded slowly, however, principally owing to the long and bitter\r\nstruggle with poverty which encompassed Marx and his gentle wife. For\r\nyears they suffered all the miseries of acute poverty, and even\r\nafterward, when the worst was past, the principal source of income, at\r\ntimes almost the only source in fact, was the five dollars a week\r\nreceived from the _New York Tribune_, for which Marx acted as special\r\ncorrespondent, and to which he contributed some of his finest work.[150]\r\nThere are few pictures more pathetic, albeit also heroic, than that\r\nwhich we have of the great thinker and his devoted wife struggling\r\nagainst poverty during the first few years of their stay in London.\r\nOften the little family suffered the pangs of hunger, and Marx and a\r\ngroup of fellow-exiles used to resort to the reading room of the British\r\nMuseum, weak from lack of food very often, but grateful for the warmth\r\nand shelter of that hospitable spot. The family lived some time in two\r\nsmall rooms in a cheap lodging house on Dean Street, the front room\r\nserving as reception room and study, and the back room serving for\r\neverything else. In a diary note, Mrs. Marx has herself left us an\r\nimpressive picture of the suffering of those early years in London.\r\nEarly in 1852, death entered the home for the first time, taking away a\r\nlittle daughter. Only a few weeks later another little daughter died,\r\nand Mrs. Marx wrote concerning this event:--\r\n\r\n\"On Easter of the same year--1852--our poor little Francisca died of\r\nsevere bronchitis. Three days the poor child was struggling with death.\r\nIt suffered so much. Its little lifeless body rested in the small back\r\nroom; we all moved together into the front room, and when night\r\napproached, we made our beds on the floor. There the three living\r\nchildren were lying at our side, and we cried about the little angel,\r\nwho rested cold and lifeless near us. The death of the dear child fell\r\ninto the time of the most bitter poverty ... (the money for the burial\r\nof the child was missing). In the anguish of my heart I went to a French\r\nrefugee who lived near, and who had sometimes visited us. I told him our\r\nsore need. At once with the friendliest kindness he gave me two pounds.\r\nWith that we paid for the little coffin in which the poor child now\r\nsleeps peacefully. I had no cradle for her when she was born, and even\r\nthe last small resting place was long denied her. What did we suffer\r\nwhen it was carried away to its last place of rest!\"[151]\r\n\r\nThe poverty, of which we have here such a graphic view, lasted for\r\nseveral years beyond the publication of the \"Critique,\" on to the\r\nappearance of the first volume of \"Capital.\" When this struggle is\r\nremembered and understood, it becomes easier to appreciate the life work\r\nof the great Socialist thinker. \"It was a terrible time, but it was\r\ngrand nevertheless,\" wrote Liebknecht years afterward to Eleanor Marx.\r\nAs this is the last place in which the personality of Marx, or his\r\npersonal affairs, will be discussed in this volume, and in view of\r\nconstant misrepresentations on the part of unscrupulous opponents of\r\nSocialism, a further word concerning his family life may not be out of\r\nplace. Those persons who regard Socialism as being antagonistic to the\r\nfamily relation, and fear it in consequence, will find no suggestion of\r\nsupport for that view in either the life of Marx or his teaching. The\r\nlove of Marx and his wife for each other was beautiful and idyllic. A\r\ntrue account of their love and devotion would rank with the most\r\nbeautiful love stories in literature. Their friends understood that,\r\ntoo, and there is a world of significance in the one brief sentence\r\nspoken by Engels, when told of the death of his friend's beautiful wife,\r\nwho was likewise his own dear friend: \"Mohr [Negro, a nickname given to\r\nMarx by his friends when young, on account of his mass of black hair and\r\nwhiskers] is dead too,\" he said simply. He knew that from this blow Marx\r\ncould not recover. It was indeed true. Though he lingered on for about\r\nthree months after her death, the life of Marx really ended when the\r\nplaymate of his boyhood, and the lover and companion of all the years of\r\nstruggle, died with the name of her dear \"Karl\" upon her lips.\r\n\r\nMarx was an ideal father as well as an ideal husband. Always\r\npassionately fond of children, he could not resist the temptation to\r\njoin the games of children upon the streets, and in the neighborhoods\r\nwhere he lived the children soon learned to regard him as their friend.\r\nTo his own children he was a real companion, always ready to amuse and\r\nto be amused by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe studious years spent in the reading room of the British Museum\r\ncomplete the anglicization of Marx. \"Capital\" is essentially an English\r\nwork, the fact of its having been written in German, by a German writer,\r\nbeing merely incidental. No more distinctively English treatise on\r\npolitical economy was ever written, not even \"The Wealth of Nations.\"\r\nEven the method and style of the book are, contrary to general opinion,\r\nmuch more distinctly English than German. I do not forget his Hegelian\r\ndialectic with its un-English subtleties, but against that must be\r\nplaced the directness, vigor, and pointedness of style, and the cogent\r\nreasoning, with its wealth of concrete illustrations, which are as\r\ncharacteristically English. Marx belongs to the school of Petty, Smith,\r\nand Ricardo, and their work is the background of his. \"Capital\" was the\r\nchild of English industrial conditions and English thought, born by\r\nchance upon German soil.\r\n\r\nToward the middle of the nineteenth century, English economic thought\r\nwas entirely dominated by the ideas and methods of Ricardo, who has been\r\ndescribed by Senior, not without justice, as \"the most incorrect writer\r\nwho ever attained philosophical eminence.\"[152] So far as such a\r\nsweeping criticism can be justified by looseness in the use of terms, it\r\nis justified by Ricardo's failing in this respect. That he should have\r\nattained the eminence he did, dominating English economic thought for so\r\nmany years, in spite of the confusion which his loose and uncertain use\r\nof words occasioned, is not less a tribute to Ricardo's genius than\r\nevidence of the poverty of political economy in England at that time. In\r\nview of the constant and tiresome reiteration of the charge that Marx\r\npillaged his labor-value theory from Thompson, Hodgskin, Bray, or some\r\nother more or less obscure writer of the Ricardian school, it is well to\r\nremember that there is nothing in the works of any of these writers\r\nconnected with the theory of value which is not to be found in the\r\nearlier work of Ricardo himself. In like manner, the theory can be\r\ntraced back from Ricardo to the master he honored, Adam Smith.\r\nFurthermore, almost a century before the appearance of \"The Wealth of\r\nNations,\" Sir William Petty had anticipated the so-called Ricardian\r\nlabor-value theory of Smith and his followers.\r\n\r\nPetty, rather than Smith, is entitled to be regarded as the founder of\r\nthe classical school of political economy, and Cossa justly calls him\r\n\"one of the most illustrious forerunners of the science of statistical\r\nresearch.\"[153] He may indeed fairly be said to have been the father of\r\nstatistical science, and was the first to apply statistics, or\r\n\"political arithmetick,\" as he called it, to the elucidation of economic\r\ntheory. He boasts that \"instead of using only comparative and\r\nsuperlative Words, and intellectual Arguments,\" his method is to speak\r\n\"in Terms of Number, Weight, or Measure; to use only Arguments of Sense;\r\nand to consider only such Causes, as have visible Foundations in Nature;\r\nleaving those that depend upon the mutable Minds, Opinions, Appetites,\r\nand Passions of particular Men, to the Consideration of others.\"[154]\r\nThe celebrated saying of this sagacious thinker that \"labor is the\r\nfather and active principle of wealth; lands are the mother,\" is more\r\nMarxian than Ricardian. Petty divided the population into two classes,\r\nthe productive and non-productive, and insisted that the value of all\r\nthings depends upon the labor it costs to produce them. This is, as we\r\nshall see, entirely Ricardian, but not Marxian. But these are the ideas\r\nMarx is supposed to have borrowed, without acknowledgment, from\r\ncomparatively obscure followers of Ricardo, in spite of the fact that he\r\ngives abundant credit to the earlier writer. It has been asked with\r\nample justification whether these critics of Marx have read either the\r\nworks of Marx or his predecessors.\r\n\r\nAdam Smith, who accepted the foregoing principles laid down by Petty,\r\nfollowed his example of basing his conclusions largely upon observed\r\nfacts instead of abstractions. It is not the least of Smith's merits\r\nthat, despite his many digressions, looseness of phraseology, and other\r\nadmitted defects, his love for the concrete kept his feet upon the solid\r\nground of fact. With his successors, notably Ricardo and John Stuart\r\nMill, it was far otherwise. They made political economy an isolated\r\nstudy of abstract doctrines. Instead of a study of the meaning and\r\nrelation of facts, it became a cult of abstractions, and the aim of its\r\nteachers seemed to be to render the science as little scientific, and\r\nas dull, as possible. They set up an abstraction, an \"economic man,\" and\r\ncreated for it a world of economic abstractions. It is impossible to\r\nread either Ricardo or John Stuart Mill, but especially the latter,\r\nwithout feeling the artificiality of the superstructures they created,\r\nand the justice of Carlyle's description of such political economy as\r\nthe \"dismal science.\" With a realism greater even than Adam Smith's, and\r\na more logical method than Ricardo or John Stuart Mill, Marx restored\r\nthe science of political economy to its old fact foundations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe superior insight of Marx is shown in the very first sentence of his\r\ngreat work. The careful reader at once perceives that the first\r\nparagraph of the book strikes a keynote which distinguishes it from all\r\nother economic works comparable to it in importance. Marx was a great\r\nmaster of the art of luminous and exact definition, and nowhere is this\r\nmore strikingly shown than in this opening sentence of \"Capital\": \"The\r\nwealth of those societies _in which the capitalist mode of production\r\nprevails_ presents itself as an immense accumulation of commodities, its\r\nunit being a single commodity.\"[155] In this simple, lucid sentence the\r\ntheory of social evolution is clearly implied. The author repudiates,\r\nby implication, the idea that it is possible to lay down universal or\r\neternal laws, and limits himself to the exploration of the phenomena\r\nappearing in a certain stage of historical development. We are not to\r\nhave another abstract economic man with a world of abstractions all his\r\nown; lone, shipwrecked mariners upon barren islands, imaginary\r\ncommunities nicely adapted for demonstration purposes in college class\r\nrooms, and all the other stage properties of the political economists,\r\nare to be entirely discarded. Our author does not propose to give us a\r\nset of principles by which we shall be able to understand and explain\r\nthe phenomena of human society at all times and in all places--the\r\nIsrael of the Mosaic Age, the nomadic life of Arab tribes, Europe in the\r\nMiddle Ages, and England in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn effect, the passage under consideration says: \"Political economy is\r\nthe study of the principles and laws governing the production and\r\ndistribution of wealth. Because of the fact that in the progress of\r\nsociety different systems of wealth production and exchange, and\r\ndifferent concepts of wealth, prevail at different times, and at various\r\nplaces at the same time, we cannot formulate any laws which will apply\r\nto all times and all places. We must choose for examination and study a\r\ncertain form of production, representing a particular stage of\r\nhistorical development, and be careful not to attempt to apply any of\r\nits laws to other forms of production, representing other stages of\r\ndevelopment. We might have chosen to investigate the laws which governed\r\nthe production of wealth in the ancient Babylonian Empire, or in\r\nMediaeval Europe, had we so desired, but we have chosen instead the\r\nperiod in which we live.\"\r\n\r\nThis that we call the capitalist epoch has grown out of the geographical\r\ndiscoveries and the mechanical inventions of the past three hundred\r\nyears or so, especially of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Its\r\nchief characteristic, from an economic point of view, is that of\r\nproduction for sale instead of direct use as in earlier stages of social\r\ndevelopment. Of course, barter and sale are much older than this epoch\r\nwhich we are discussing. In all ages men have exchanged their surplus\r\nproducts for other things more desirable to them, either directly by\r\nbarter or through some medium of exchange. In the very nature of things,\r\nhowever, such exchange as this must have been incidental to the life of\r\nthe people engaging in it, and not its principal aim. Under such\r\nconditions of society wealth consists in the possession of useful\r\nthings. The naked savage, so long as he possessed plenty of weapons, and\r\ncould get an abundance of fish or game, was, from the viewpoint of the\r\nsociety in which he lived, a wealthy man. In other words, the wealth of\r\npre-capitalist society consisted in the possession of use-values, and\r\nnot of exchange-values. Robinson Crusoe, for whom the possibility of\r\nexchange did not exist, was, from this pre-capitalist viewpoint, a very\r\nwealthy man.\r\n\r\nIn our present society, production is carried on primarily for exchange,\r\nfor sale. The first and essential characteristic feature of wealth in\r\nthis stage of social development is that it takes the form of\r\naccumulated exchange-values, or commodities. Men are accounted rich or\r\npoor according to the exchange-values they can command, and not\r\naccording to the use-values they can command. To use a favorite example,\r\nthe man who owns a ton of potatoes is far richer in simple use-values\r\nthan the man whose only possession is a sack of diamonds, but, because\r\nin present society a sack of diamonds will exchange for an almost\r\ninfinite quantity of potatoes, the owner of the diamonds is much\r\nwealthier than the owner of the potatoes. The criterion of wealth in\r\ncapitalist society is exchangeable value as opposed to use-value, the\r\ncriterion of wealth in primitive society. The unit of wealth is\r\ntherefore a commodity, and we must begin our investigation with it. If\r\nwe can analyze the nature of a commodity so that we can understand how\r\nand why it is produced, and how and why it is exchanged, we shall be\r\nable to understand the principle governing the production and exchange\r\nof wealth in this and every other society where similar conditions\r\nprevail, where, that is to say, the unit of wealth is a commodity, and\r\nwealth consists in an accumulation of commodities.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe visit to America, in 1907, of a distinguished English critic of\r\nSocialism, Mr. W. H. Mallock, had the effect of thrusting into\r\nprominence a common misconception of Marxian Socialism, and it is highly\r\nsignificant that, except in the Socialist press, none of the numerous\r\ncomments which the series of university lectures delivered by that\r\ngentleman occasioned, called attention to the fact that they were based\r\nthroughout upon a misstatement of the Marxian position. Briefly, Mr.\r\nMallock insisted that Marx believed and taught that all wealth is\r\nproduced by manual labor, and that, therefore, it ought to belong to the\r\nmanual workers. In order that there may be no misstatement of our\r\namiable critic's position, it will be best to quote his own words. He\r\nsays, in Lecture I: \"The practical outcome of the scientific economics\r\nof Marx is summed up in the formula which is the watchword of popular\r\nSocialism. 'All wealth is due to labor; therefore all wealth ought to go\r\nto the laborer'--a doctrine in itself not novel, but presented by Marx\r\nas the outcome of an elaborate system of economics\"[156] (page 6). The\r\ncareful reader will notice that Mr. Mallock does not profess to give\r\nthe exact words of Marx, nor refer to any particular passage, but says\r\nthat the formula quoted by him is the \"practical outcome\" of the\r\neconomic system of Marx, \"presented by Marx\" as such. But to quote\r\nagain: \"Wealth, says Marx, not only ought to be, but actually can be\r\ndistributed amongst a certain class of persons, namely, the laborers....\r\nBecause these laborers comprise in the acts of labor everything that is\r\ninvolved in the production of it\" (page 7). Again: \" ... Marx makes of\r\nhis doctrine that labor alone produces all economic wealth\" (page 7).\r\nAlso: \" ... that theory of production which the genius of Karl Marx\r\ninvested with a semblance, at all events, of sober, scientific truth,\r\nand which ascribes all wealth to that _ordinary manual labor which\r\nbrings the sweat to the brow of the ordinary laboring man_\" (page\r\n12).[157] All the foregoing passages are taken from a single lecture,\r\nthe first of the series. We will take only a few from the others: \" ...\r\nthe doctrine of Marx that all productive effort is absolutely equal in\r\nproductivity\" (Lecture III, page 46); \"Marx based the ethics of\r\ndistribution on what purported to be an analysis of production\" (Lecture\r\nIV, page 61); \" ... Count Tolstoy, ... like Socialists of the school of\r\nMarx, declares that ordinary manual labor is the source of all wealth\"\r\n(Lecture IV, page 76). \"One is the attempt of Marx and his school,\r\nwhich represents ordinary manual labor as the sole producer of wealth\"\r\n(Lecture IV, page 81); \" ... the Marxian doctrine ... that manual labor\r\nis the sole producer of wealth\" (Lecture V, page 115). It would be easy\r\nto add many other quotations very similar to these, but it is\r\nunnecessary. From the quotations given we can gather Mr. Mallock's\r\nconception of what Marx taught regarding the source of wealth.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Mr. Mallock alleges: (1) That Marx believed and\r\ntaught that all wealth is produced by ordinary manual labor; (2) that he\r\nheld, as a consequence, that all wealth ought to belong to the manual\r\nlaborers, thus basing an ethic of distribution upon production; (3) that\r\nhe taught that all productive effort is absolutely equal in productive\r\nvalue, in other words, that ten hours' work of one kind is economically\r\nas valuable as ten hours' of any other kind, so long as the labor is\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to command the necessary self-restraint to reply with\r\ndignity to such wholesale misrepresentation as this. There is not the\r\nslightest scintilla of a foundation in fact for any one of the three\r\nstatements. Not a single passage can be quoted from Marx which justifies\r\nany one of them. As we shall see, Marx specifically repudiated each one\r\nof them, a great deal more forcefully than Mr. Mallock does. That such\r\nmisrepresentations of Marx should have been permitted to pass\r\nunchallenged in so many of our great colleges and universities is to our\r\nnational shame. We will briefly consider the teaching of Marx under each\r\nof the three heads.\r\n\r\nFirst, the source of wealth. It is true that such phrases as \"Labor is\r\nthe source of all wealth\" are constantly met with in the popular\r\nliterature of Socialism, but so far as that is the case it is not due to\r\nthe teaching of Marx, but rather in spite of it. In the writings of the\r\nearly Ricardian Socialists these phrases abound, but nowhere in all the\r\nwritings of Marx will such a statement be found. For many years the\r\nopening sentence in the Programme of the German party contained the\r\nphrase \"Labor is the source of all wealth and of all culture,\" _but it\r\nwas adopted in spite of the protest of Marx_. The Gotha Programme was\r\nadopted in 1875. A draft was submitted to Marx and he wrote of it that\r\nit was \"utterly condemnable and demoralizing to the party.\" Of the\r\npassage in question, he wrote: \"Labor is _not_ the source of all wealth.\r\nNature is just as much the source of use-values (and of such, to be\r\nsure, is material wealth composed) as is labor, which itself is but the\r\nexpression of a natural force, of human labor-power.\"[158] That the\r\nclause was adopted was a bitter disappointment to Marx, and was due to\r\nthe insistence of the followers of Ferdinand Lassalle. To say that Marx\r\nheld labor to be the sole source of wealth is to misrepresent his whole\r\nteaching.[159]\r\n\r\nBut while the Lassallians, and before them the Ricardians, used the\r\n_phrase_, it is evident that they assumed the inclusion of what Marx\r\ncalls \"Nature.\" They know very well that labor, mere exertion of\r\nphysical strength, could produce nothing. If, for instance, a man were\r\nto spend all his strength trying to lift the pyramids, alone and unaided\r\nby mechanical power, it is quite evident to the meanest intellect that\r\nhis exertions would not produce a single atom of wealth. It is equally\r\nobvious that if we take any use-value, whether it be an exchange-value\r\nor not being immaterial, we cannot eliminate from it the substance of\r\nwhich it is composed. Take, for example, the canoe of a savage, which is\r\na simple use-value, and a meerschaum pipe, which is a commodity. In the\r\ncanoe we have part of the trunk of a tree taken from the primeval\r\nforest, one of Nature's products. But without the labor of the savage it\r\nwould never have become a canoe. It would have remained simply part of\r\nthe trunk of a tree, and would not have acquired the use-value it has as\r\na canoe. But it is likewise true that without the tree the canoe could\r\nnot have existed. So with our meerschaum pipe. It is not simply a\r\nuse-value: it is also an article of commerce, an exchange-value, a\r\ncommodity. Its elements are, the silicate mineral which Nature provided\r\nand the form which human labor has given it. We can apply this test to\r\nevery form of wealth, whether simple use-values or commodities, and we\r\nshall find that, in Mill's phrase, wealth is produced by the application\r\nof human labor to _appropriate natural objects_.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the second point in Mr. Mallock's criticism, namely,\r\nthat Marx held that only \"ordinary manual labor\" is capable of producing\r\nwealth, and that, therefore, all wealth ought to go to the manual\r\nlaborers. One looks in vain for a single passage in all the writings of\r\nMarx which will justify this criticism. It may be conceded at once that\r\nif Marx taught anything of the kind, the defect in Marxian theory is\r\nfatal. But it must be proven that the defect exists--and the _onus\r\nprobandi_ rests upon Mr. Mallock. One need not be a trained economist or\r\na learned philosopher to see how absurd such a theory must be. Suppose\r\nwe take, for example, a man working in a factory, at a great machine,\r\nmaking screws. We go to that man and say: \"Every screw here is made by\r\nmanual labor alone. The machine does not count; the brains of the\r\ninventors of the machine have nothing to do with the making of screws.\"\r\nOur laborer might be illiterate and unable to read a single page of\r\npolitical economy with understanding, but he would know that our\r\nstatement was foolish and untrue. Or, suppose we take the machine itself\r\nand say to the laborer: \"That great machine with all its levers and\r\nwheels and springs working in such beautiful harmony was made entirely\r\nby manual workers, such as molders, blacksmiths, and machinists; no\r\nbrain workers had anything to do with the making of it; the labor of the\r\ninventors, and of the men who drew the plans and supervised the making,\r\nhad nothing to do with the production of the machine\"--our laborer would\r\nrightly conclude that we were either fools or seeking to mock him as\r\none.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, notwithstanding the frequent reiteration of this\r\ncriticism of Marx by Mr. Mallock, he himself, in an unguarded moment,\r\nprovides the answer by which Marx is vindicated! Thus, speaking of the\r\ngreat classical economists, Adam Smith, Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill,\r\nhe points out that they included \"all forms of living industrial effort,\r\nfrom those of a Watt or an Edison down to those of a man who tars a\r\nfence, grouped together under the common name of labor\" (Lecture I, page\r\n16). And again: \"At present the orthodox economists and the socialistic\r\neconomists alike give us _all human effort_[160] tied up, as it were, in\r\na sack, and ticketed 'human labor'\" (Lecture I, page 18). Now, if the\r\nSocialist includes in his definition of labor \"all human effort,\" it\r\nstands to reason that he does not mean only \"ordinary manual labor\" when\r\nhe uses the term. Thus Mallock answers Mallock and vindicates Marx!\r\n\r\nOf course, Marx, like all the great economists, includes in his concept\r\nof labor every kind of productive effort, mental as well as physical, as\r\nMr. Mallock, to the utter destruction of his disingenuous criticism,\r\nunconsciously--we must suppose--admitted. Take, for example, this\r\ndefinition: \"By labor power or capacity for labor is to be understood\r\nthe aggregate of those _mental and physical_ capabilities existing in a\r\nhuman being, which he exercises when he produces a use-value of any\r\ndescription.\"[161] As against this luminous and precise definition, it\r\nis but fair to quote that of Mr. Mallock himself. He defines labor as\r\n\"the faculties of an individual _applied to his own labor_\"[162]--a\r\nmeaningless jumble of words. The fifty-seven letters contained in that\r\nsentence would mean just as much if put in a bag, well shaken, and put\r\non paper just as they happened to fall from the bag.\r\n\r\nMarx never argued that the producers of wealth had a _right_ to the\r\nwealth produced. The \"right of labor to the whole of its produce\" was,\r\nit is true, the keynote of the theories of the Ricardian Socialists. An\r\necho of the doctrine appeared in the Gotha Programme of the German\r\nSocialists to which reference has already been made, and in the popular\r\nagitation of Socialism in this and other countries it is echoed more or\r\nless frequently. Just in proportion as the ethical argument for\r\nSocialism is advanced, and appeals made to the sense of justice, the\r\nrich idler is condemned and an ethic of distribution based upon\r\nproduction becomes an important feature of the propaganda. But Marx\r\nnowhere indulges in this kind of argument. Not in a single line of\r\n\"Capital,\" or his minor economic treatises, can any hint of the doctrine\r\nbe found. He invariably scoffed at the \"ethical distribution\" idea. In\r\nthe judgment of the present writer, this is at once his great strength\r\nand weakness, but that is beside the point of this discussion. Suffice\r\nit to say, though it involves some reiteration, that Marx never took the\r\nposition that Socialism _ought_ to take the place of capitalism,\r\nbecause the producers of wealth _ought_ to get the whole of the wealth\r\nthey produce. His position was rather that Socialism _must_ come, simply\r\nbecause capitalism _could not_ last.\r\n\r\nFinally, we come to the charge that Marx taught that \"all productive\r\neffort is absolutely equal in productivity.\" Incredible as it may seem,\r\nit is nevertheless a fact that everything Marx has to say upon the\r\nsubject is directly opposed to this notion, and that, as we shall see\r\nlater on, his famous theory of value is not only not dependent upon a\r\nbelief in the equal productivity of all productive effort, but would be\r\ncompletely shattered by it. Not only Marx, but also Mill, Ricardo, and\r\nSmith, his great predecessors, recognized the fact that all labor is not\r\nequally productive. Of course, it requires no special genius to\r\ndemonstrate this. That a poor mechanic with antiquated tools will\r\nproduce less in a given number of hours than an expert mechanic with\r\ngood tools, for example, is too obvious for comment. The Marx assailed\r\nby Mr. Mallock, and numerous critics like him, is a myth. The real Marx\r\nthey do not touch--hence the futility of their work. The Marx they\r\nattack is a man of straw, not the immortal thinker. Endowed\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"With just enough of learning to misquote,\"\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir assaults are vain.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nHaving thus disposed of some of the more prevalent criticisms of Marx as\r\nan economist, we are ready for a definite, consecutive statement of the\r\neconomic theory of modern Socialism. First, however, a word as to the\r\nterm \"scientific\" as commonly applied to Marxian Socialism. Even some of\r\nthe friendliest of Socialist critics have contended that the use of the\r\nterm is pretentious, bombastic, and altogether unjustified. From a\r\ncertain narrow point of view, this appears to be an unimportant matter,\r\nand the vigor with which Socialists defend their use of the term seems\r\nexceedingly foolish, and accountable for only as a result of\r\nenthusiastic fetish worship--the fetish, of course, being Marx.\r\n\r\nSuch a view is very crude and superficial. It cannot be doubted that the\r\nSocialism represented by Marx and the modern political Socialist\r\nmovement is radically different from the earlier Socialism with which\r\nthe names of Fourier, Saint-Simon, Cabet, Owen, and a host of other\r\nbuilders of \"cloud palaces for an ideal humanity,\" are associated. The\r\nneed of some word to distinguish between the two is obvious, and the\r\nonly question remaining is whether or not the word \"scientific\" is the\r\nmost suitable and accurate one to make that distinction clear; whether\r\nthe words \"scientific\" and \"utopian\" express with reasonable accuracy\r\nthe nature of the difference. Here the followers of Marx feel that they\r\nhave an impregnable position. The method of Marx is scientific. From the\r\nfirst sentence of his great work to the last, the method pursued is that\r\nof a painstaking scientist. It would be just as reasonable to complain\r\nof the use of the word \"scientific\" in connection with the work of\r\nDarwin and his followers, to distinguish it from the guesswork of\r\nAnaximander, as to cavil at the distinction made between the Socialism\r\nof Marx and Engels and their followers, and that of visionaries like\r\nOwen and Saint-Simon.\r\n\r\nDoubtless both Marx and Engels lapsed occasionally into Utopianism. We\r\nsee instances of this in the illusions Marx entertained regarding the\r\nCrimean War bringing about the European Social Revolution; in the theory\r\nof the increasing misery of the proletariat; in Engels' confident\r\nprediction, in 1845, that a Socialist revolution was imminent and\r\ninevitable; and in the prediction of both that an economic cataclysm\r\nmust create the conditions for a sudden and complete revolution in\r\nsociety. These, I say, are Utopian ideas, evidences that the founders of\r\nscientific Socialism were tinctured with the older ideas of the\r\nUtopists, and even more with their spirit. But when we speak of\r\n\"Marxism,\" what mental picture does the word suggest, what intellectual\r\nconcept is the word a name for? Is it these forecasts and guesses, and\r\nthe exact mode of realizing the Socialist ideal which Marx laid down, or\r\nis it the great principle of social evolution determined by economic\r\ndevelopment? Is it his naive and simple description of the process of\r\ncapitalist concentration, in which no hint appears of the circuitous\r\nwindings that carried the actual process into unforeseen channels, or\r\nthe broad fact that the concentration has taken place and that monopoly\r\nhas come out of competition? Is it his statement of the extent to which\r\nlabor is exploited, or the _fact_ of the exploitation? If we are to\r\njudge Marx by the essential things, rather than by the incidental and\r\nnon-essential things, then we must admit his claim to be reckoned with\r\nthe great scientific sociologists and economists.\r\n\r\nAfter all, what constitutes scientific method? Is it not the recognition\r\nof the law of causation, putting exact knowledge of facts above\r\ntradition or sentiment; accumulating facts patiently until sufficient\r\nhave been gathered to make possible the formulation of generalizations\r\nand laws enabling us to connect the present with the past, and in some\r\nmeasure to foretell the outcome of the present, as Marx foretold the\r\nculmination of competition in monopoly? Is it not to see past, present,\r\nand future as one whole, a growth, a constant process, so that instead\r\nof vainly fashioning plans for millennial Utopias, we seek in the facts\r\nof to-day the stream of tendencies, and so learn the direction of the\r\nimmediate flow of progress? If this is a true concept of scientific\r\nmethod, and the scientific spirit, then Karl Marx was a scientist, and\r\nmodern Socialism is aptly named Scientific Socialism.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[137] An English edition of this work, translated by H.

The passage occurs in Lecture III, page 36.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nOUTLINES OF SOCIALIST ECONOMIC THEORY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe _geist_ of social and political evolution is economic, according to\r\nthe Socialist philosophy. This view of the importance of man's economic\r\nrelations involves some very radical changes in the methods and\r\nterminology of political economy. The philosophical view of social and\r\npolitical evolution as a world-process, through revolutions formed in\r\nthe matrices of economic conditions, at once limits and expands the\r\nscope of political economy. It destroys on the one hand the idea of the\r\neternality of economic laws and limits them to particular epochs. On the\r\nother hand, it enhances the importance of the science of political\r\neconomy as a study of the motive force of social evolution. With Marx\r\nand his followers, political economy is more than an analysis of the\r\nproduction and distribution of wealth; it is a study of the principal\r\ndeterminant factor in the social and political progress of society,\r\nconsciously recognized as such.\r\n\r\nThe sociological viewpoint appears throughout the whole of Marxian\r\neconomic thought. It appears, for instance, in the definition of a\r\ncommodity as the unit of wealth _in those societies in which the\r\ncapitalist mode of production prevails_. Likewise wealth and capital\r\nconnote special social relations or categories. Wealth, which in certain\r\nsimpler forms of social organization consists in the ownership of\r\nuse-values, under the capitalist system consists in the ownership of\r\nexchange-values. Capital is not a thing, but a social relation between\r\npersons established through the medium of things. Robinson Crusoe's\r\nspade, the Indian's bow and arrow, and all similar illustrations given\r\nby the \"orthodox\" economists, do not constitute capital any more than an\r\ninfant's spoon is capital. They do not serve as the medium of the social\r\nrelation between wage-worker and capitalist which characterizes the\r\ncapitalist system of production. The essential feature of capitalist\r\nsociety is the production of wealth in the commodity form; that is to\r\nsay, in the form of objects that, instead of being consumed by the\r\nproducer, are intended to be exchanged or sold at a profit. Capital,\r\ntherefore, is wealth set aside for the production of other wealth with a\r\nview to its exchange at a profit. A house may consist of certain\r\ndefinite quantities of bricks, timber, lime, iron, and other substances,\r\nbut similar quantities of these substances piled up without plan will\r\nnot constitute a house. Bricks, timber, lime, and iron become a house\r\nonly in certain circumstances, when they bear a given ordered relation\r\nto each other. \"A negro is a negro; it is only under certain conditions\r\nthat he becomes a slave. A certain machine, for example, is a machine\r\nfor spinning cotton; it is only under certain defined conditions that it\r\nbecomes capital. Apart from these conditions, it is no more capital than\r\ngold _per se_ is money; capital is a social relation of\r\nproduction.\"[163]\r\n\r\nThis sociological principle pervades the whole of Socialist economics.\r\nIt appears in every economic definition, practically, and the\r\nterminology of the orthodox political economists is thereby often given\r\na new meaning, radically different from that originally given to it and\r\ncommonly understood. The student of Socialism who fails to appreciate\r\nthis fact will most frequently land in a morass of confusion and\r\ndifficulty, but the careful student who fully understands it will find\r\nit of great assistance. Take, as an illustration, the phrase \"the\r\nabolition of capital\" which frequently occurs in Socialist literature.\r\nThe reader who thinks of capital as consisting of _things_, such as\r\nmachinery, materials of production, money, and so on, finds the phrase\r\nbewildering. He wonders how it is conceivable that production should go\r\non if these things were done away with. But the student who fully\r\nunderstands the sociological principle outlined above comprehends at\r\nonce that it is not proposed to do away with the _things_, but with\r\n_certain social relations expressed through them_. He understands that\r\nthe \"abolition of capital\" no more involves the destruction of the\r\nphysical things than the abolition of slavery involved the destruction\r\nof the slave himself. What is aimed at is the social relation which is\r\nestablished through the medium of the things commonly called capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn common with all the great economists, Socialists hold that wealth is\r\nproduced by human labor applied to appropriate natural objects. This, as\r\nwe have seen, does not mean that labor is the sole source of wealth.\r\nStill less does it mean that the mere expenditure of labor upon natural\r\nobjects must inevitably result in the production of wealth. If a man\r\nspends his time digging holes in the ground and filling them up again,\r\nor dipping water from the ocean in a bucket and pouring it back again,\r\nthe labor so expended upon natural objects would not produce wealth of\r\nany kind. Nor is the productivity of mental labor denied. In the term\r\n\"labor\" is implied the totality of human energies expended in\r\nproduction, regardless of whether those energies be physical or mental.\r\nIn modern society wealth consists of social use-values, commodities.\r\n\r\nWe must, therefore, begin our analysis of capitalist society with an\r\nanalysis of a commodity. \"A commodity,\" says Marx, \"is, in the first\r\nplace, an object outside us, a thing that by its properties satisfies\r\nhuman wants of some sort or another. The nature of such wants, whether,\r\nfor instance, they spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no\r\ndifference. Neither are we here concerned to know how the object\r\nsatisfies these wants, whether directly as means of subsistence, or\r\nindirectly as means of production.\"[164] But a commodity must be\r\nsomething more than an object satisfying human wants. Such objects are\r\nsimple use-values, but commodities are something else in addition to\r\nsimple use-values. The manna upon which the pilgrim exiles of the Bible\r\nstory were fed, for instance, was not a commodity, though it fulfilled\r\nthe conditions of this first part of our definition by satisfying human\r\nwants. We must carry our definition further, therefore. In addition to\r\nuse-value, then, a commodity must possess exchange-value. In other\r\nwords, it must have a social use-value, a use-value to others, and not\r\nmerely to the producer.\r\n\r\nThus, things may have the quality of satisfying human wants without\r\nbeing commodities. To state the matter in the language of the\r\neconomists, use-values may, and often do, exist without economic value,\r\nvalue, that is to say, in exchange. Air, for example, is absolutely\r\nindispensable to life, yet it is not--except in special, abnormal\r\nconditions--subject to sale or exchange. With a use-value that is beyond\r\ncomputation, it has no exchange-value. Similarly, water is ordinarily\r\nplentiful and has no economic value; it is not a commodity. A seeming\r\ncontradiction exists in the case of the water supply of cities where\r\nwater for domestic use is commercially supplied, but a moment's\r\nreflection will show that it is not the water, but the social service of\r\nbringing it to a desired location for the consumer's convenience that\r\nrepresents economic value. Over and above that there is, however, the\r\nelement of monopoly-price which enters into the matter. With that we\r\nhave not, at this point, anything to do. Under ordinary circumstances,\r\nwater, like light, is plentiful; its utility to man is not due to man's\r\nlabor, and it has, therefore, no economic value. But in exceptional\r\ncircumstances, as in an arid desert or in a besieged fortress, a\r\nmillionaire might be willing to give all his wealth for a little water,\r\nthus making the value of what is ordinarily valueless almost infinite.\r\nWhat may be called natural use-values have no economic value. And even\r\nuse-values that are the result of human labor may be equally without\r\neconomic value. If I make something to satisfy some want of my own, it\r\nwill have no economic value unless it will satisfy the want of some one\r\nelse. So, unless a use-value is social, unless the object produced is of\r\nuse to some other person than the producer, it will have no value in the\r\neconomic sense: it will not be _exchangeable_.\r\n\r\nA commodity must therefore possess two fundamental qualities. It must\r\nhave a use-value, must satisfy some human want or desire; it must also\r\nhave an exchange-value arising from the fact that the use-value\r\ncontained in it is social in its nature and exchangeable for other\r\nexchange-values. With the unit of wealth thus defined, the subsequent\r\nstudy of economics is immensely simplified.[165]\r\n\r\nThe trade of capitalist societies is the exchange of commodities against\r\neach other, through the medium of money. Commodities utterly unlike each\r\nother in all apparent physical properties, such as color, weight, size,\r\nshape, substance, and so on, and utterly unlike each other in respect to\r\nthe purposes for which intended and the nature of the wants they\r\nsatisfy, are exchanged for one another, sometimes equally, sometimes in\r\nunequal ratio. The question immediately arises: what is it that\r\ndetermines the relative value of commodities so exchanged? A dress suit\r\nand a kitchen stove, for example, are very different commodities,\r\npossessing no outward semblance to each other, and satisfying very\r\ndifferent human wants, yet they may, and actually do, exchange upon an\r\nequality in the market. To understand the reason for this similarity of\r\nvalue of dissimilar commodities, and the principle which governs the\r\nexchange of commodities in general, is to understand an important part\r\nof the mechanism of modern capitalist society.\r\n\r\nThis is the problem of value which all the great economists have tried\r\nto solve. Sir William Petty, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart\r\nMill, and Karl Marx developed what is known as the labor-value theory as\r\nthe solution of the problem. This theory, as developed by Marx, not in\r\nits cruder forms, is one of the cardinal principles in Socialist\r\neconomic theory. The Ricardian statement of the theory is that the\r\nrelative value of commodities to one another is determined by the\r\nrelative amounts of human labor embodied in them; that the quantity of\r\nlabor embodied in them is the determinant of the value of all\r\ncommodities. When all their differences have been carefully noted, all\r\ncommodities have at least one quality in common. The dress suit and the\r\nkitchen range, toothpicks and snowshoes, pink parasols and\r\nsewing-machines, are unlike each other in every other particular save\r\none--they are all products of human labor, crystallizations of human\r\nlabor-power. Here, then, say the Socialists, as did the great classical\r\neconomists, we have a hint of the secret of the mechanism of exchange in\r\ncapitalist society. The amount of labor-power embodied in their\r\nproduction is in some way connected with the measure of the exchangeable\r\nvalue of the commodities.\r\n\r\nStated in the simple, crude form, that the quantity of human labor\r\ncrystallized in them is the basis and measure of the value of\r\ncommodities when exchanged against one another, the labor theory of\r\nvalue is beautifully simple. At least, the formula is simplicity itself.\r\nAt the same time, it is open to certain very obvious criticisms. It\r\nwould be absurd to contend that the day's labor of a coolie laborer is\r\nequal in productivity to the day's labor of a highly skilled mechanic,\r\nor that the day's labor of an incompetent workman is of equal value to\r\nthat of the most proficient. To refute such a theory is as beautifully\r\nsimple as the theory itself. In all seriousness, arguments such as these\r\nare constantly used against the Marxian theory of value, notwithstanding\r\nthat they do not possess the slightest relation to it. Marxism is very\r\nfrequently \"refuted\" by those who do not trouble themselves to\r\nunderstand it.\r\n\r\nThe idea that the quantity of labor embodied in them is the determinant\r\nof the value of commodities was held by practically all the great\r\neconomists. Sir William Petty, for example, in a celebrated passage,\r\nsays of the exchange-value of corn: \"If a man can bring to London an\r\nounce of silver out of the earth in Peru in the same time that he can\r\nproduce a bushel of corn, then one is the natural price of the other;\r\nnow, if by reason of new and more easy mines a man can get two ounces of\r\nsilver as easily as formerly he did one, then the corn will be as cheap\r\nat ten shillings a bushel as it was before at five shillings a bushel,\r\n_caeteris paribus_.\"[166]\r\n\r\nAdam Smith, following Petty's lead, says: \"The real price of everything,\r\nwhat everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the\r\ntoil and trouble of acquiring it. What everything is really worth to the\r\nman who has acquired it, and who wants to dispose of it or exchange it\r\nfor something else, is the toil and labor which it can save to himself,\r\nand which it can impose on other people.... Labor was the first price,\r\nthe original purchase money, that was paid for all things.... If among a\r\nnation of hunters, for example, it usually costs twice the labor to kill\r\na beaver which it does to kill a deer, one beaver would naturally be\r\nworth or exchange for two deer. It is natural that what is usually the\r\nproduce of two days' or two hours' labor, should be worth double of what\r\nis usually the produce of one day's or one hour's labor.\"[167]\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin, whose merit as an economist Marx recognized, takes\r\nthe same view and regards trade as being \"nothing but the exchange of\r\nlabor for labor, the value of all things being most justly measured by\r\nlabor.\"[168] From the writings of almost every one of the great\r\nclassical economists of England it would be easy to compile a formidable\r\nand convincing volume of similar quotations, showing that they all took\r\nthe same view that the quantity of human labor embodied in commodities\r\ndetermines their value. One further quotation, from Ricardo, must,\r\nhowever, suffice. He says:--\r\n\r\n\"To convince ourselves that this (quantity of labor) is the real\r\nfoundation of exchangeable value, let us suppose any improvement to be\r\nmade in the means of abridging labor in any one of the various processes\r\nthrough which the raw cotton must pass before the manufactured stockings\r\ncome to the market to be exchanged for other things; and observe the\r\neffects which will follow. If fewer men were required to cultivate the\r\nraw cotton, or if fewer sailors were employed in navigating, or\r\nshipwrights in constructing, the ship in which it was conveyed to us; if\r\nfewer hands were employed in raising the buildings and machinery, or if\r\nthese, when raised, were rendered more efficient; the stockings would\r\ninevitably fall in value, and command less of other things. They would\r\nfall because a less quantity of labor was necessary to their production,\r\nand would therefore exchange for a smaller quantity of those things in\r\nwhich no such abridgment of labor had been made.\"[169]\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the foregoing quotations that these great writers\r\nregarded the quantity of human labor crystallized in them as the basis\r\nof all commodity values, and their real measure. The great merit of\r\nRicardo lies in his development of the idea of social labor as against\r\nthe simple concept of the labor of particular individuals, or sets of\r\nindividuals. In the passage cited, he includes in the term \"quantity of\r\nhuman labor\" not merely the total labor of those immediately concerned\r\nin the making of stockings, from the cultivation of the raw cotton to\r\nthe actual making of stockings in the factory, but all the labor\r\nindirectly expended, even in the making and navigating of ships, and the\r\nbuilding of the factories. One does, indeed, find hints of the social\r\nlabor concept in Adam Smith, but it is Ricardo who first clearly\r\ndevelops it. Marx further developed this principle, and all criticisms\r\nof the labor-value theory in Marxian economic theory which are based\r\nupon the assumption that quantity of labor means the simple, direct\r\nlabor embodied in commodities fall of their own weight.\r\n\r\nThus, if we take any commodity, we shall find that it is possible to\r\nascertain with tolerable certainty the amount of direct labor embodied\r\nin it, but that it is equally as impossible to ascertain the amount of\r\nthe indirect expenditure of labor power which entered into its making.\r\nIn the case of a table, for example, it may be possible to trace with\r\nsome approximation to accuracy the labor involved in felling the tree\r\nand preparing the lumber out of which the table was made; the labor\r\ndirectly spent in bringing the lumber to the factory, and the direct\r\nlabor expended in making out of the lumber a finished table; allowance\r\nmay also be made for the labor embodied in the nails, glue, stain, and\r\nother articles used in making the table. So we have a fairly accurate\r\nstatement of the direct labor embodied in the table. But what of the\r\nlabor used to make the tools of the men who felled the trees and\r\nprepared the lumber? What of the coal miner and the iron miner and the\r\ntool maker? And what of the numerous and incalculable expenditures of\r\nlabor to make the railroads, the railway engines, and to provide these\r\nwith steam-power? What, also, of the machinery in the factory, and of\r\nthe factory buildings themselves, and, back of them, again, the tool\r\nmakers and the providers of raw materials? It is obvious that no human\r\nintellect could ever unravel the tangled skein of human labor, and that\r\nin actual exchange there can be no calculation of the respective labor\r\ncontent of commodities. If the law of value holds good, it must operate\r\nmechanically, automatically. And this it does, through the incidence of\r\nbargaining and the law of supply and demand.\r\n\r\nWe have noted elsewhere the variations in human capacity and\r\nproductiveness. Superficial critics still frequently charge Marx with\r\nhaving overlooked this very obvious fact, whereas it has not only been\r\nfully treated by him, but was actually covered by Smith and Ricardo\r\nbefore Marx! With these writers and their followers it is the law of\r\naverages which solves the difficulties arising from variations in\r\nindividual capacity and productivity. It is the _average_ amount of\r\nlabor expended in killing the beaver which counts, not the actual\r\nindividual labor in a specified case. Nor did these writers overlook the\r\nimportant differentiation between simple, unskilled labor and labor that\r\nis highly skilled. If A in ten hours' labor produces exactly double the\r\namount of exchange-value which B produces in the same time devoted to\r\nlabor of another kind, it is obvious that the labor of B is not equal in\r\nvalue to that of A. Quantity of labor cannot, therefore, be measured, in\r\nindividual cases, by time units. Despite a hundred passages which,\r\ndetached from their context, seem to imply the contrary, Adam Smith\r\nrecognized this very clearly, and attempted to solve the riddle by a\r\ndifferentiation of skilled and unskilled labor in which he likens\r\nskilled labor to a machine; and insists that the labor and time spent in\r\nacquiring the skill which distinguishes skilled labor must be\r\nreckoned.[170]\r\n\r\nAnother frequent criticism of the Marxian theory has not only been\r\nanswered by Marx himself--is, in fact, ruled out by the terms of the\r\ntheory itself--but was amply replied to by Ricardo.[171] The criticism\r\nin question consists in the selection of what may be called \"unique\r\nvalues,\" or scarcity values, articles which cannot be reproduced by\r\nlabor, and whose value is wholly independent of the quantity of labor\r\noriginally necessary to produce them. Such articles are unique specimens\r\nof coins and postage stamps, autograph letters, rare manuscripts,\r\nStradivarius violins, Raphael pictures, Caxton books, articles\r\nassociated with great personages--such as Napoleon's snuffbox--great\r\nauks' eggs, and so on _ad infinitum_. No possible amount of human labor\r\ncould reproduce these articles, reproduce, that is to say, the exact\r\nutilities in them. Napoleon's snuffbox might be exactly duplicated so\r\nfar as its physical properties are concerned, but the association with\r\nNapoleon's fingers, the sentimental quality which gives it its special\r\nutility, is not reproducible. But the trade of capitalist society does\r\nnot consist in the manufacture and sale of these things, which, after\r\nall, form a very insignificant part of the exchange-values of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nMarx saw the soul of truth in the labor-value theory, as propounded by\r\nhis predecessors, especially Ricardo, and devoted himself to its\r\ndevelopment and systematization. He has been accused of plagiarizing his\r\ntheory from the Ricardians, but it is surely not plagiarism when a\r\nthinker sees the germ of truth in a theory, and, separating it from the\r\nmass of confusion and error which envelops it, restates it in scientific\r\nfashion with all its necessary qualifications. This is precisely what\r\nMarx did. He developed the idea of social labor which Ricardo had\r\npropounded, disregarding entirely individual labor. He recognized the\r\nabsurdity of the contention that the value of commodities is determined\r\nby the amount of labor, either individual or social, _actually embodied\r\nin them_. If two workers are producing precisely similar commodities,\r\nsay coats, and one of them expends twice as much labor as the other and\r\nuses tools and methods representing twice the social labor, it is\r\nclearly foolish to suppose that the exchange-value of his coat will be\r\ntwice as great as that of the other worker, regardless of the fact that\r\ntheir utility is equal. Labor, Marx pointed out, has two sides, the\r\nqualitative and the quantitative. The qualitative side, the difference\r\nin quality between specially skilled and simply unskilled labor, is\r\neasily recognized, though the relative value of the one compared with\r\nthe other may be somewhat obscured. The secret of that obscurity lies\r\nhidden in the quantitative side of labor. Here we must enter upon an\r\nabstract inquiry, that part of the Marxian theory which is most\r\ndifficult to comprehend. Yet, it is not so very difficult, after all, to\r\nunderstand that the years devoted to learning his trade, by a mechanical\r\nengineer, for instance, during all of which years he must be provided\r\nwith the necessities of life, must be reckoned somewhere and somehow;\r\nand that when they are so reckoned, his day's labor may be found to\r\ncontain, concentrated, so to speak, an amount of labor time equivalent\r\nto two or even many days' simple unskilled labor time. It may be, and in\r\nfact is, quite impossible to set forth mathematically the relation of\r\nthe two, for the reason that the process of developing skilled labor is\r\ntoo complex to be unraveled. Of the fact, however, there can be no\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nThe real law of value, then, according to Marx, is as follows: Under\r\ncapitalism, _in free competition_, the value of all commodities, other\r\nthan those unique things which cannot be reproduced by human labor, is\r\ndetermined by the amount of _abstract_ labor embodied in them; or,\r\nbetter, by the amount of social human labor power necessary, on the\r\naverage, for their production. We may conveniently illustrate this\r\ntheory by a concrete example. Let us, therefore, return to our\r\ncoat-makers. Now, always assuming their equal utility, no one will be\r\nwilling to pay twice as much for the coat produced by the slow worker\r\nwith poor tools as for the other. If the more economical methods of\r\nproduction employed by the man who makes his coats in half the time\r\ntaken by the other man are the methods usually employed in the\r\nmanufacture of coats, and the time he takes represents the average time\r\ntaken to produce a coat, then the average value of coats will be\r\ndetermined thereby, and coats produced by the slower, less economical\r\nprocess will command only the same price in the market, the fact that\r\nthey may embody twice the amount of actual labor counting for nothing.\r\nIf we reverse the order of this proposition, and suppose the slower,\r\nless economical methods to be those generally prevailing in the\r\nmanufacture of coats, and the quicker, more economical methods to be\r\nexceptional, then, all other things being equal, the exchange-value, of\r\ncoats will be determined by the amount of labor commonly consumed, and\r\nthe fortunate producer who adopts the exceptional, economical methods\r\nwill, for a time, reap a golden harvest. Only for a time, however. As\r\nthe new methods prevail, competition being the impelling force, they\r\nbecome less and less exceptional, and, finally, the regular, normal\r\nmethods of production and the standard of value.\r\n\r\nIt is this very important qualification, fundamental to the Marxian\r\ntheory, which is most often lost sight of by the critics. They persist\r\nin applying to individual commodities the test of comparing the amounts\r\nof labor-power actually consumed in their production, and so confound\r\nthe Marxian theory with its crude progenitors. In refuting this crude\r\ntheory, they are quite oblivious of the fact that Marx himself\r\naccomplished that by no means difficult feat. To state the Marxian\r\ntheory accurately, we must qualify the bald statement that the\r\nexchange-value of commodities is determined by the amount of labor\r\nembodied in them, and state it in the following manner: _The\r\nexchange-value of commodities is determined by the amount of average\r\nlabor at the time socially necessary for their production._ This is\r\ndetermined, not absolutely in individual cases, but approximately in\r\ngeneral, by the bargaining and higgling of the market, to adopt Adam\r\nSmith's well-known phrase.\r\n\r\nNow, this theory applies to those things, exclusive of the category of\r\n\"unique values,\" which cannot be made by labor and are commonly supposed\r\nto owe their value to their rarity. For example, we may take diamonds. A\r\nman walking along the great wastes of the African _karoo_ comes across a\r\nlittle stream. As he stoops to drink, he sees in the water a number of\r\nglittering diamonds. To pick them out is the work of a few minutes only,\r\nbut the diamonds are worth many thousands of dollars. The law of value\r\nabove outlined applies just as much to them as to any other commodity.\r\nThe value of diamonds is determined by the amount of labor expenditure\r\nnecessary _on an average_ to procure them. If the normal method of\r\nobtaining diamonds were simply to go to the nearest stream and pick them\r\nout, their value would fall, possibly to zero:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"When we have nothing else to wear\r\n     But cloth of gold and satins rare,\r\n     For cloth of gold we cease to care--\r\n       Up goes the price of shoddy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nMost writers do not distinguish between price and value with sufficient\r\nclearness, using the terms as if they were synonymous and\r\ninterchangeable. Where utilities are exchanged directly one for\r\nanother, as in the barter of primitive society, there is no need of a\r\nprice-form to express value. In highly developed societies, however,\r\nwhere the very magnitude of production and exchange makes direct barter\r\nimpossible, and where the objects to be exchanged are not commonly the\r\nproduct of individual labor, a medium of exchange becomes necessary; a\r\nsomething which is generally recognized as a safe and stable commodity\r\nwhich can be used to express in terms of its own weight, size, shape, or\r\ncolor, the value of other commodities to be exchanged. This is the\r\nfunction of money. In various times and places wheat, shells, skins of\r\nanimals, beads, powder, tobacco, and a multitude of other things, have\r\nserved as money, but for various reasons, more or less obvious, the\r\nprecious metals, gold and silver, have been most favored.\r\n\r\nIn all commercial countries to-day, one or other of these metals, or\r\nboth of them, serves as the recognized medium of exchange. They are\r\ncommodities also, and when we say that the value of a commodity is a\r\ncertain amount of gold, we equally express the value of that amount of\r\ngold in terms of the commodity in question. As commodities, the precious\r\nmetals are subject to the same laws as other commodities. If gold should\r\nbe discovered in such abundance that it became as plentiful and easy to\r\nobtain as coal, its value would be no greater than that of coal. It\r\nmight, conceivably, still be used as the medium of exchange, but it\r\nwould--unless protected by legislation or otherwise from the operation\r\nof economic law, and so given a monopoly-price--have an exchange-value\r\nequal to that of coal, a ton of the one being equal to a ton of the\r\nother--provided, of course, that its utility remained. Since the\r\nscarcity of gold is an important element in its utility valuation,\r\ncreating and fostering the desire for its possession, that utility-value\r\nmight largely disappear if gold became as plentiful as coal, in which\r\ncase it would not have the same value as coal, and might cease to be a\r\ncommodity at all.\r\n\r\nPrice, then, is the expression of value in terms of some other\r\ncommodity, which, generally used for that purpose of expressing the\r\nvalue of other commodities, we call money. It is only an approximation\r\nof value, and subject to a much greater fluctuation than value itself.\r\nIt may, for a time, fall far below or rise above value, but in a free\r\nmarket--the only condition in which the operation of the law may be\r\njudged--sooner or later the equilibrium will be regained. Where monopoly\r\nexists, the free market condition being non-existent, price may be\r\nconstantly elevated above value. Monopoly-price is an artificial\r\nelevation of price above value, and must be considered separately as the\r\nabrogation of the law of value.\r\n\r\nFailure to discriminate between value and its price-expression, or\r\nsymbol, has led to endless difficulty. It lies at the bottom of the\r\nnaive theory that value depends upon the relation of supply and demand.\r\nLord Lauderdale's famous theory has found much support among later\r\neconomists, though it is now rather unpopular when stated in its old,\r\nsimple form. Disguised in the so-called Austrian theory of final\r\nutility, it has attained considerable vogue.[172] The theory is\r\nplausible and convincing to the ordinary mind. Every day we see\r\nillustrations of its working: prices are depressed when there is an\r\noversupply, and elevated when the demand of would-be consumers exceeds\r\nthe supply of the commodities they desire to buy. It is not so easy to\r\nsee that these effects are temporary, and that there is an automatic\r\nadjustment going on. Increased demand raises prices for a while, but it\r\nalso calls forth an increase in supply which tends to restore the old\r\nprice level, or may even force prices below it. In the latter case, the\r\nsupply falls off and prices find their real level. The relation of\r\nsupply to demand causes an oscillation of prices, but it is not the\r\ndeterminant of value. When prices rise above a certain level, demand\r\nslackens or ceases, and prices are inevitably lowered. Prices may and do\r\nfall with a decreased demand, but it is clear that unless the producers\r\ncan get a price approximately equal to the value of their commodities,\r\nthey will cease to produce them, and the supply will diminish or cease\r\naltogether. Ultimately, therefore, the fluctuations of price through the\r\nlack of equilibrium between supply and demand adjust themselves, and\r\nprices must tend constantly to approximate values.\r\n\r\nMonopoly-price is, as already observed, an artificial price in the sense\r\nthat the laws of free market exchange do not apply to it. The \"unique\r\nutilities,\" things not reproducible by human labor, command what might\r\nbe termed natural monopoly-prices. There are many other commodities,\r\nhowever, the price of which is not regulated by the quantity of social\r\nhuman labor necessary to produce them, but simply by the desire of the\r\npurchasers and the means they have of gratifying it and the power of the\r\nsellers to control the market and exclude effective competition. Since\r\nKarl Marx wrote, the exceptions to his law of value have become more\r\nnumerous, as a result of the changes in industrial and commercial\r\nconditions. The development of great monopolies and near-monopolies has\r\ngreatly increased the number of commodities which, for considerable\r\nperiods, are placed outside the sphere of the labor-value theory, their\r\nprice depending upon their marginal utility, irrespective of the labor\r\nactually embodied in them or necessary to their reproduction. It may, in\r\nthe opinion of the present writer, be said in criticism of the followers\r\nof Marx that they have not carried on his work, but largely contented\r\nthemselves with repeating generalizations which, true when made, no\r\nlonger fit all the facts. But that is not a criticism of Marx, or of his\r\nwork. What he professed to make was an analysis of the methods of\r\nproduction and exchange in competitive capitalist society. His followers\r\nhave largely failed to allow for the enormous changes which have taken\r\nplace, and go on repeating, unchanged, his phrases.\r\n\r\nProfessor Seligman has pointed out that Ricardo's contention that value\r\nis determined by the cost of production, and the contention of Jevons\r\nthat value is determined by marginal utility, are not mutually\r\nexclusive, but, on the contrary, complementary to each other.[173] The\r\npresent writer has long contended that the marginal utility theory and\r\nthe Marxian labor-value theory are likewise not antagonistic but\r\ncomplementary.[174] This is not the place to enter into the elaborate\r\ndiscussion which this contention involves. Only a brief indication of\r\nthe argument for the claim is here and now possible. First, as we have\r\nseen, Marx is very careful to insist that utility is essential to value,\r\nand that the utility must be a social utility. But social utility does\r\nnot come of itself, from the skies or elsewhere. It is, so far as the\r\nvast majority of commodities is concerned, the product of labor. It is\r\ntrue that the value of a thing is never independent of its social\r\nutility; it is likewise true that this is determined by the social labor\r\nnecessary to the reproduction of that utility. To regard the two\r\ntheories as antagonistic, it seems to be necessary to say either (1)\r\nthat the quantity of social labor necessary to produce certain\r\ncommodities determines their value, utterly regardless of the amount of\r\ntheir social utility, or (2) that we estimate the social utility of\r\ncommodities, estimate what we are willing to pay for them, utterly\r\nregardless of the labor necessary, on an average, for their\r\nreproduction. The latter contention would be absurd, and the former\r\nwould involve the abandonment of the initial premises of the Marxian\r\ntheory, contained in his definition of a commodity. In so far as the\r\nbasis of social utility is the social labor necessary for its\r\nproduction, the labor-value theory of Marx may be said, I think, to\r\ninclude the marginal utility law, as one of the forms in which it\r\noperates.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nLabor, the source and determinant of value, has, _per se_, no value.\r\nOnly when it is embodied in certain forms has it any value. If a man\r\nlabors hard digging holes and refilling them, his labor has no value.\r\nWhat the capitalist buys is not labor, but labor-power. Wages in general\r\nis a form of payment for a given amount of labor-power, measured by\r\nduration and skill. The laborer sells brain and muscle power, which is\r\nthus placed at the temporary disposal of the capitalist to be used up\r\nlike any other commodity that he buys. The philosopher Hobbes, in his\r\n\"Leviathan,\" clearly anticipated Marx in thus distinguishing between\r\nlabor and laboring power in the saying, \"_The value or worth of a man is\r\n... so much as would be given for the Use of his Power_.\" The power to\r\nlabor assumes the commodity form, being at once a use-value and an\r\nexchange-value. At first sight it appears that piecework is an exception\r\nto the general rule that the capitalist buys labor-power and not labor\r\nitself. It seems that when piece-wages are paid it is not the machine,\r\nthe living labor-power, but the product of the machine, labor actually\r\nperformed, that is bought. Superficially, this is so, of course, but it\r\ndoes not affect the principle laid down, because, as a matter of fact,\r\nthe piecework system is only one of the means used to secure a maximum\r\nof labor-power. The average output of pieceworkers in a trade always\r\ntends to become the standard output for the time-workers, and, on the\r\nother hand, the average wage of pieceworkers tends to keep very near the\r\nstandard of time-wages.\r\n\r\nNow, as a commodity, labor-power is subject to the same laws as all\r\nother commodities. Its price, wages, fluctuates just as the price of all\r\nother commodities does, and bears the same relation to its value. It may\r\nbe temporarily affected by the preponderance of supply over demand, or\r\nof demand over supply; it may be made the subject of monopoly in certain\r\ncases. There is, therefore, no such thing as an \"iron law\" of wages, any\r\nmore than there is an \"iron law\" of prices for other commodities.\r\nLassalle took the Ricardian law of wages and, by means of his\r\ncharacteristic exaggeration, distorted it out of all semblance to truth.\r\nSays Ricardo: \"The natural price of labor, therefore, depends on the\r\nprice of the food, necessaries, and conveniences required for the\r\nsupport of the laborer and his family. With a rise in the price of food\r\nand necessaries, the natural price of labor will rise; with the fall in\r\ntheir price, the natural price of labor will fall.\"[175] This Lassalle\r\nmade the basis of his famous \"iron law,\" according to which 96 per cent\r\nof the wage-workers were precluded from improving their economic\r\nposition. Lassalle's chief fault lay in that he made no allowance\r\nwhatever for either state interference, or the organized influence of\r\nthe workers themselves. He also attaches too little importance to what\r\nMarx calls the traditional standards of living.[176] It is nevertheless\r\ntrue that the price of labor-power, wages, tends to approximate its\r\nvalue, just as the price of all other commodities tends, under normal\r\nconditions, to approximate their value.\r\n\r\nAnd just as the value of other commodities is determined by the amount\r\nof social labor necessary on an average for their reproduction, so the\r\nvalue of labor-power is likewise determined. Wages tend to a point at\r\nwhich they will cover the average cost of the necessary means of\r\nsubsistence for the workers and their families, in any given time and\r\nplace, under the conditions and according to the standards of living\r\ngenerally prevailing. Trade union action, for example, may force wages\r\nabove that point, or undue stress in the competitive labor market may\r\nforce wages below it. While, however, a trade union may bring about what\r\nis virtually a monopoly-price for the labor-power of its members, there\r\nis always a counter tendency in the other direction, sometimes even to\r\nthe lowering of the standard of subsistence itself to the minimum of\r\nthings required for physical existence.\r\n\r\nTo class human labor-power with pig iron as a commodity, subject to the\r\nsame laws, may at first seem fantastic to the reader, but a careful\r\nsurvey of the facts will fully justify the classification. The capacity\r\nof the worker to labor depends upon his securing certain things; his\r\nlabor-power has to be reproduced from day to day, for which a certain\r\nsupply of food, clothing, and other necessities of life is essential.\r\nEven with these supplied constantly, the worker sooner or later wears\r\nout and dies. If the race is not to be extinguished, a certain supply of\r\nthe necessities of life must be provided for the children during the\r\nyears of their development to the point where their labor-power becomes\r\nmarketable. The average cost of production in the case of labor-power\r\nincludes, therefore, the necessities for a wife and family as well as\r\nfor the individual worker. Far from being the iron law Lassalle\r\nimagined, this law of wages is one of considerable elasticity. The\r\nstandard of living itself, far from being a fixed thing, determined only\r\nby the necessities of physical existence, varies according to\r\noccupational groups; to localities sometimes, as a result of historical\r\ndevelopment; to nationality and race, as a result of tradition; to the\r\ngeneral standard of intelligence, and the degree in which the workers\r\nare organized for the promotion of their economic interests. The advance\r\nin the culture of the people as a whole, expressing itself in\r\nlegislation for compulsory education, the abolition of child labor,\r\nimprovement of housing and general sanitary conditions, and so on,\r\ntends to raise the standard of living. Finally, the fluctuations in the\r\nprice of labor-power due to the operation of the law of supply and\r\ndemand are much more important than Lassalle imagined.\r\n\r\nThis living commodity, labor-power, differs in one remarkable way from\r\nall other commodities, in that when it is used up in the process of the\r\nproduction of other commodities in which it is embodied, it creates new\r\nvalue in the process of being used up, and embodies that new value in\r\nthe commodity it assists to produce. In the case of raw materials and\r\nmachinery this is not so. In the manufacture of tables, for example, the\r\nwood used up is transformed into tables, embodied in them, but the wood\r\nhas added nothing to its own value. The same is true of machinery. But\r\nwith human labor-power it is otherwise. The capitalist buys from the\r\nlaborer his labor-power at its full value as a commodity. But the\r\nlaborer, in embodying that labor-power in some concrete form, creates\r\nmore value than his wages represents. For the commodity he sells, his\r\n_power_ to labor, he has been paid its full value, namely, the social\r\nlabor-cost of its production; but that power may be capable of producing\r\nthe equivalent of twice its own cost of production. This is the central\r\nidea of the famous and much-misunderstood Marxian theory of\r\nsurplus-value, by which the method of capitalism, the exploitation of\r\nthe wage-workers, and the resulting class antagonisms of the system are\r\nexplained. This theory becomes the groundwork of all the social theories\r\nand movements protesting against and seeking to end the exploitation of\r\nthe laboring masses. To understand it is, therefore, of paramount\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in an earlier chapter, Marx was not the first to\r\nrecognize that the secret of capitalism, the object of capitalist\r\nindustry, is the extraction of surplus-value from the labor-power of the\r\nworker. Nor was he the first to use the term. By no means a happy term,\r\nsince it adds to the difficulty of comprehending the meaning and nature\r\nof _value_, Marx took it from the current economic discussion of his\r\ntime as a term already fairly well understood. What we owe to the genius\r\nof Marx is an explanation of the manner in which surplus-value is\r\nextracted by the capitalist from the labor-power of the worker, and the\r\npart it plays in capitalist society.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the theory can be very briefly stated, but its\r\ndemonstration involves, naturally, a more extensive study. Under normal\r\nconditions, the worker will produce a value equivalent to his means of\r\nsubsistence, or to the wages actually paid to him, in a very small\r\nnumber of hours. If he owned and controlled the means of\r\nproduction,--land, machinery, raw materials, and so on,--he would,\r\ntherefore, need to work only so many hours as the production of the\r\nnecessities of life for himself and his family required. But the laborer\r\nin capitalist society does not own the means of production, that\r\ncondition being quite incompatible with machine production upon a large\r\nscale. A separation of the worker from the ownership of the means of\r\nproduction has taken place as one of the inevitable results of\r\nindustrial evolution. So the laborer must sell the only commodity he has\r\nto sell, namely, his labor-power. He sells the utility of that commodity\r\nto the capitalist for its exchange-value, or market price. Like any\r\nother commodity, the utility of labor-power, its use-value, belongs to\r\nthe purchaser, the capitalist. It is his to use as he sees fit. He has\r\nit used to produce other commodities which he in turn hopes to sell--has\r\nthe labor-power used up in the manufacture of other commodities, just as\r\nhe has the raw materials used up. He buys, for example, the labor-power\r\nof the workers for a day of ten hours. In five hours, say, the worker\r\ncreates value equivalent to his wages, but he does not cease at that\r\npoint. He goes on working for another five hours, thus producing in a\r\nday double the amount of his wages, the exchange-value of the\r\nlabor-power he sold the capitalist. Thus the capitalist, having paid\r\nwages equivalent to the product of five hours, receives the product of\r\nten hours. This balance represents the surplus-value (_Mehrwerth_).\r\n\r\nThis takes place all through industry. If the capitalist employs a\r\nthousand workers under these conditions, each day he receives the\r\nproduct of five thousand hours over and above the product actually paid\r\nfor. This constitutes his income. If the capitalist owned the land,\r\nmachinery, and raw materials, absolutely, without incumbrances of any\r\nkind, the whole of that surplus-value would, naturally, belong to him.\r\nBut as a general rule this is not the case. He rents the land and must\r\npay rent to the landlord, or he works upon borrowed capital and must pay\r\ninterest upon loans, so that the surplus-value extracted from the\r\nlaborer must be divided into rent, interest, and profit. But how the\r\nsurplus-value is divided among landlords, moneylenders, creditors,\r\nspeculators, and actual employers is a matter of absolutely no moment to\r\nthe workers as a class. That is why such movements as that represented\r\nby the followers of Henry George fail to vitally interest the working\r\nclass.[177] The division of the surplus-value wrung from the toil of the\r\nworkers gives rise to much quarrel and strife within the ranks of the\r\nexploiting class, but the working class recognizes, and vaguely and\r\ninstinctively feels where it does not clearly recognize, that it has no\r\ninterest in these quarrels. All that interests it vitally is how to\r\nlessen the extent of the exploitation to which it is subjected, and how\r\nultimately to end that exploitation altogether. That is the objective of\r\nthe movement for the socialization of the means of life.\r\n\r\nSuch, briefly stated, is the theory. We may illustrate it by the\r\nfollowing example: Let us say the average cost of a day's subsistence is\r\nthe product of five hours' social labor, which is represented by a wage\r\nof $1 per day. In a factory there are 1000 workers. Their labor-power\r\nthey have sold at its exchange value, $1 per day per man, a total of\r\n$1000. They use up $1000 worth of labor-power, then. They also use up\r\n$1000 worth of raw material and wear out the plant to the extent of $100\r\nin the course of their work. Now, instead of working five hours each,\r\nthat being the amount of time necessary to reproduce the value of their\r\nwages, as above described, they all work ten hours. Thus, in place of\r\nthe $1000 they received as wages for the labor-_power_ they sold, they\r\ncreate labor _products_, valued at just twice that sum, $2000. According\r\nto our suppositions, therefore, the gross value of the day's product\r\nwill be $3100, the whole of it belonging to the capitalist, for the\r\nsimple and sufficient reason that he bought and paid for, at their full\r\nvalue as commodities, all the elements entering into its production, the\r\nmachinery, materials, and labor-power. The capitalist pays,--\r\n\r\n\r\n     For labor-power                           $1000\r\n     For materials                              1000\r\n     For repairs and replacement of machinery    100\r\n                                                        -----\r\n     He receives, for the gross product         3100    $2100\r\n     The surplus-value is, therefore            1000\r\n\r\n\r\nand this sum is the fund from which rent, interests, and profits must be\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that there is no moral condemnation of the\r\ncapitalist involved in this illustration. He simply buys the commodity,\r\nlabor-power, at its full market price, as in the case of all other\r\ncommodities. No ethical argument enters into it at all. It is very\r\nevident, however, that the interest of the capitalist will be to get as\r\nmuch surplus-value as possible, by buying labor-power at the lowest\r\nprice possible, prolonging the working day, and intensifying the\r\nproductivity of the labor-power he buys, while the interest of the\r\nworkman will be equally against these things. Here we have the cause of\r\nclass antagonism--not in the speeches of agitators, but in the facts of\r\nindustrial life.\r\n\r\nThis is the Marxian theory of surplus-value in a nutshell. Rent,\r\ninterest, and profit, the three great divisions of capitalist income\r\ninto which this surplus-value is divided, are thus traced to the\r\nexploitation of labor, resting fundamentally upon the ownership by the\r\nexploiting class of the means of production. Other economists, both\r\nbefore and since Marx, have tried to explain the source of capitalist\r\nincome in very different ways. An early theory was that profit\r\noriginates in exchange, through \"buying cheap and selling dear.\" That\r\nthis is so in the case of individual traders is obvious. If A sells to B\r\ncommodities above their value, or buys commodities from him below their\r\nvalue, it is plain that he gains by it. But it is equally plain that B\r\nloses. If one group of capitalists gains what another group loses, the\r\ngains and losses balance each other; there is no gain to the capitalist\r\nclass as a whole. Yet that is precisely what occurs--the capitalist\r\nclass as a whole does gain, and gain enormously, despite the losses of\r\nindividual members of that class. It is that gain to the great body of\r\ncapitalists, that general increase in their wealth, which must be\r\naccounted for, and which exchange cannot explain. Only when we think of\r\nthe capitalist class buying labor-power from outside its own ranks,\r\ngenerally at its natural value, and using it, is the problem solved. The\r\ncommodity which the capitalist buys creates a value greater than its own\r\nin being used up.\r\n\r\nThe theory that profit is the wages of risk is answerable in\r\nsubstantially the same way. It does not in any way explain the increase\r\nin the aggregate wealth of the capitalist class to say that the\r\nindividual capitalist must have a chance to receive interest upon his\r\nmoney in order to induce him to turn it into capital, to hazard losing\r\nit wholly or in part. While the theory of risk helps to explain some\r\nfeatures of capitalism, the changes in the flow of capital into certain\r\nforms of investment, and, to some small extent, the commercial crises\r\nincidental thereto, it does not explain the vital problem, the source of\r\ncapitalist income. The chances of gain, as a premium for the risks\r\ninvolved, explain satisfactorily enough the action of the gambler when\r\nhe enters into a game of roulette or faro. It cannot be said, however,\r\nthat the aggregate wealth of the gamblers is increased by playing\r\nroulette or faro. Then, too, the risks of the laborers are vastly more\r\nvital than those of the capitalist. Yet the premium for their risks of\r\nhealth and life itself does not appear, unless, indeed, it be in their\r\nwages, in which case the most superficial glance at our industrial\r\nstatistics will show that wages are by no means highest in those\r\noccupations where the risks are greatest and most numerous. Further, the\r\nwages of the risks for capitalists and laborers alike are drawn from the\r\nsame source, the product of the laborers' toil.\r\n\r\nTo consider, even briefly, all the varied theories of surplus-value\r\nother than these would be a prolonged, dull, and profitless task. The\r\ntheory of abstinence, that profit is the just reward of the capitalist\r\nfor saving part of his wealth and using it as a means of production, is\r\nanswerable by _a priori_ arguments and by a vast volume of facts.\r\nAbstinence obviously produces nothing; it can only save the wealth\r\nalready produced by labor, and no automatic increase of that saved-up\r\nwealth is possible. If it is to increase without the labor of its owner,\r\nit can only be through the exploitation of the labor of others, so that\r\nthe abstinence theory in no manner controverts the Marxian position. On\r\nthe other hand, we see that those whose wealth increases most rapidly\r\nare not given to frugality or abstinence by any means. It may,\r\ncertainly, be possible for an individual to save enough by practicing\r\nfrugality and abstinence to enable him to invest in some profitable\r\nenterprise, but the source of his profit is not his abstinence. That\r\nmust be sought elsewhere. Abstinence may provide him with the means for\r\ntaking the profit, but the profit itself must come from the value\r\ncreated by human labor-power over and above its cost of production.\r\n\r\nStill less satisfactory is the idea that surplus-value is nothing more\r\nthan the \"wages of superintendence,\" or the \"rent of ability.\" This\r\ntheory has been advocated with much specious argument. Essentially it\r\ninvolves the contention that there is no distinction between wages and\r\nprofits, or between capitalists and laborers; that the capitalist is a\r\nworker, and his profits simply wages for his useful and highly important\r\nwork of directing industry. It is a bold theory with a very small basis\r\nof fact. Whoever honestly considers it, must, one would think, see that\r\nit is both absurd and untrue. Not only is the larger part of industry\r\nto-day managed by salaried employees who have no part, or only a very\r\ninsignificant part, in the ownership of the concerns they manage, but\r\nthe profits are distributed among shareholders who, as shareholders,\r\nhave never contributed service of any kind to the industries in which\r\nthey are shareholders. Whatever services are performed, even by the\r\nfigure-head \"dummy\" directors of companies, are paid for before profits\r\nare considered at all. This is the invincible answer to such criticisms\r\nas that of Mr. Mallock, that Marx and his followers have not recognized\r\n\"the functions of the directive ability of the few.\" When all the\r\nsalaries of the directing \"few\" have been paid, as well as the wages of\r\nthe many, and the cost of all materials and maintenance of machinery,\r\nthere remains a surplus to be distributed among those who belong neither\r\nto the \"laboring many\" nor the \"directing few.\" That profit Mr. Mallock\r\ncannot explain away. Marx himself, in \"Capital,\" called attention to the\r\n\"directing ability of the few,\" quite as clearly as Mr. Mallock has\r\ndone. He first shows how the \"collective power of masses\" is really a\r\nnew creation; that it involves a special kind of leadership, or\r\ndirecting authority, just as an orchestra does; then he proceeds to\r\npoint out the development of a special class of supervisors and\r\ndirectors of industry, \"a special kind of wage laborer.... The _work of\r\nsupervision becomes their established and exclusive function_.\"[178]\r\nSocialists, contrary to Mr. Mallock, have not overlooked the function\r\nexercised by the directing few, but they have pointed out that when\r\nthese have been paid, their salaries being sometimes almost fabulous,\r\nthere is still a surplus-value to be distributed among those who have\r\nnot shared in the production, either as mental or manual workers. As Mr.\r\nAlgernon Lee says:--\r\n\r\n\"The profits produced in many American mills, factories, mines, and\r\nrailway systems go in part to Englishmen or Belgians or Germans who\r\nnever set foot in America, and who obviously can have no share in even\r\nthe mental labor of direction. A certificate of stock may belong to a\r\nchild, to a maniac, to an imbecile, to a prisoner behind the bars, and\r\nit draws profit for its owner just the same. Stocks and bonds may lie\r\nfor months or years in a safe-deposit vault, while an estate is being\r\ndisputed, before their ownership is determined; but whoever is declared\r\nto be the owner gets the dividends and interest \"earned\" during all that\r\ntime.\"[179]\r\n\r\nIt is an easy task to set up imaginary figures labeled \"Marxism,\" and\r\nthen to demolish them by learned argument--but the occupation is as\r\nfruitless as it is easy. It remains the one central fact of capitalism,\r\nhowever, that a surplus-value is created by the working class and taken\r\nby the exploiting class, from which develops the class struggle of our\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[163] _The People's Marx_, by Gabriel Deville, page 288.\r\n\r\n[164] _Capital_, Vol. I, Kerr edition, page 41.\r\n\r\n[165] Professor J.

But when they have grasped the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the Marxian system of thought, they realize that it would\r\nbe absurd to attempt to give detailed specifications of the Socialist\r\nstate. As the Socialist movement has outgrown the influence of the early\r\nUtopians, its adherents have abandoned the habit of speculating upon the\r\npractical application of Socialist principles in future society. The\r\nformulation of schemes, more or less detailed, has given place to firm\r\ninsistence that Socialism must be regarded as a principle, namely, the\r\nefficient organization of wealth production and distribution to the end\r\nthat the exploitation of the wealth producers by a privileged class may\r\nbe rendered impossible. Whatever contributes to that end is a\r\ncontribution to the fulfillment of the Socialist ideal.\r\n\r\nStill, it is natural and inevitable that earnest Socialists and\r\nstudents of Socialism should seek something more tangible by way of a\r\ndescription of the future state than the bald statement that it will be\r\nfree from the struggle between exploiting and exploited classes. The\r\nquestion is, can we go further in our attempt to scan the future without\r\nentering the realms of Utopian speculation? If Socialism is, objectively\r\nconsidered, a state of society which is being developed in the womb of\r\nthe present, are there any signs by which its peculiar form and spirit,\r\nas distinguished from the form and spirit of the present, may be\r\nvisualized? Within certain limits, an affirmative answer seems possible\r\nto each of these questions. There are certain fundamental principles\r\nwhich may be said to be essential to the existence of Socialist society.\r\nWithout them, the Socialist state cannot exist. Regardless of the fact\r\nthat Karl Marx never attempted to describe his ideal, to give such a\r\ndescription of his concept of the next epoch in evolution as would\r\nenable us to compare it with the present and to measure the difference,\r\nit is probable that every Socialist makes, privately at least, his own\r\nforecast of the manner in which the new society must shape itself.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing Utopian or fantastic in trying to ascertain the\r\ntendencies of economic development; nothing unscientific in trying to\r\nread out of the pages of social evolution such lessons as may be\r\ncontained therein. So long as we bear in mind that our forecasts must\r\nnot take the form of plans for the arbitrary shaping of the future,\r\nspecifications of the Cooeperative Commonwealth, but that they must, on\r\nthe contrary, be based upon the facts of life--not abstract principles\r\nborn in the heart's desire--and attempt to discern the tendencies of\r\nsocial and economic evolution, we are upon safe ground. Such forecasts\r\nmay indeed be helpful, not only in so far as they provide us with a more\r\nor less concrete picture of the ideal to be aimed at, but also, and even\r\nmore important, in that they at once enable us to gauge from time to\r\ntime the progress made by society toward the realization of the ideal,\r\nand to formulate our policies most effectively. Especially as there are\r\ncertain fundamental principles essential to the existence of a Socialist\r\nstate, we may take these and correlate them, and these principles,\r\ntogether with our estimate of economic tendencies, drawn from the facts\r\nof the present, may provide us with a suggestive and approximate outline\r\nof the Socialist society of the future. So far we may proceed with full\r\nscientific sanction; beyond are the realms of fancy and dream, the\r\nElysian Fields of Utopia.[180] We must not set about our task with the\r\nmental attitude so well displayed by the yearning of Omar--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Ah Love! could you and I with Him conspire\r\n     To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,\r\n     Would not we shatter it to bits--and then\r\n     Remold it nearer to the Heart's Desire!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom that spirit only vain dreams and fantastic vagaries can ever come.\r\nWhat we must bear in mind is that the social fabric of to-morrow, like\r\nthat of yesterday, whose ruins we contemplate to-day, will not spring\r\nup, complete, in response to our will, but will grow out of social\r\nexperience and needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest and most lamentable errors in connection with the\r\npropaganda of modern Socialism has been the assumption of its friends,\r\nin many instances, and its foes, in most instances, that Socialism and\r\nIndividualism are entirely antithetical concepts. Infinite confusion has\r\nbeen caused by setting the two against each other. Society consists of\r\nan aggregation of individuals, but it is something more than that in\r\njust the same sense as a house is something more than an aggregation of\r\nbricks. It is an organism, though as yet an imperfectly developed one.\r\nWhile the units of which it is composed have distinct and independent\r\nlives within certain limits, they are, outside of those limits,\r\ninterdependent and inter-related. Man is governed by two great forces.\r\nOn the one hand, he is essentially an egoist, ever striving to attain\r\nindividual freedom; on the other hand, he is a social animal, ever\r\nseeking association and avoiding isolation. This duality expresses\r\nitself in the life of society. There is a struggle between its members\r\nmotived by the desire for individual expression and gain; and, alongside\r\nof it, a sense of solidarity, a movement to mutual, reciprocal\r\nrelations, motived by the gregarian instinct. All social life is\r\nnecessarily an oscillation between these two motives. The social problem\r\nin its last analysis is nothing more than the problem of combining and\r\nharmonizing social and individual interests and actions springing\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with this social problem, the problem of how to secure\r\nharmony of social and individual interests and actions, it is necessary\r\nfirst of all to recognize that both motives are equally important and\r\nnecessary agents of human progress. The idea largely prevails that\r\nSocialists ignore the individual motive and consider only the social\r\nmotive, just as the ultra-individualists have erred in an opposite\r\ndiscrimination. The Socialist ideal has been conceived to be a great\r\nbureaucracy. Mr. Anstey gave humorous and vivid expression to this idea\r\nin _Punch_ some years ago, when he represented the citizens of the\r\nSocialist state as being all clothed alike, known only by numbers,\r\nstrangers to all the joys of family life, plodding through their\r\nallotted tasks under a race of hated bureaucrats, and having the solace\r\nof chewing gum in their leisure time as a specially paternal provision.\r\nSome such mental picture must have inspired Herbert Spencer's \"Coming\r\nSlavery,\" and it must be confessed that the early forms of Socialism\r\nwhich consisted mainly of detailed plans of cooeperative commonwealths\r\nafforded some excuse for the idea. Most intelligent Socialists, if\r\ncalled upon to choose between them, would probably prefer to live in\r\nThibet under a personal despotism, rather than under the hierarchies of\r\nmost of the imaginary commonwealths which Utopian Socialists have\r\ndepicted.\r\n\r\nEven in the later propaganda of the modern political Socialist movement,\r\nthere has been more than enough justification for those who regard\r\nSocialism as impossible except under a great bureaucracy. In numberless\r\nSocialist programmes and addresses Socialism has been defined as meaning\r\n\"The social ownership and control of all the means of production,\r\ndistribution, and exchange.\" Critics of Socialism are not to be\r\nseriously blamed if they take such \"definitions\" at their face value and\r\ninterpret them quite literally. It is not difficult to see that in order\r\nto place \"all means of production, distribution, and exchange\" under\r\nsocial ownership and control, the creation of such a bureaucracy as the\r\nworld has never seen would be necessary. A needle is a means of\r\nproduction quite as much as an electric power machine in a factory is,\r\nthe difference being in their degrees of efficiency. A jackknife is,\r\nlikewise, in certain circumstances, a means of production, just as\r\nsurely as a powerful planing machine is, the difference being in degrees\r\nof efficiency. So a market basket is a means of distribution quite as\r\nsurely as an ocean steamship is; a wheelbarrow quite as much as a\r\nlocomotive. They differ in degrees of efficiency, that is all. The idea\r\nthat the housewife in the future, when she wants to sew a button upon a\r\ngarment, will be obliged to go to some department and \"take out\" a\r\nneedle, having it properly checked in the communal accounts, and being\r\nresponsible for its return, is, of course, worthy only of opera bouffe.\r\nSo is the notion of the state owning wheelbarrows and market baskets and\r\nmaking their private ownership illegal. \"The socialization of _all_ the\r\nmeans of production, distribution, and exchange,\" literally interpreted,\r\nis folly. But none of those using the phrase must be regarded as\r\nseriously contemplating its literal interpretation. For many years the\r\nphrase was included in the statement of its \"Object\" by the English\r\nSocial Democratic Federation, and even now it appears in a slightly\r\nmodified form, the word \"all\" being omitted,[181] perhaps because of its\r\ntautological character. For several years the writer was a member of the\r\nFederation, actively engaged in the propaganda, and how we spent much of\r\nour time explaining to popular audiences in halls and upon street\r\ncorners that the socialization of jackknives, needles, sewing machines,\r\nmarket baskets, beer mugs, frying pans, and toothpicks was not our aim,\r\nis a merry memory.\r\n\r\nWhen this is understood, the nightmare of the bureaucracy of Socialism\r\nvanishes. It is no longer necessary to fret ourselves asking how a\r\ngovernment is to own and manage everything without making slaves of its\r\ncitizens. The question propounded by that venerable and distinguished\r\nCanadian scholar, Professor Goldwin Smith,[182] whether a government can\r\nbe devised which shall hold all the instruments of production,\r\ndistribute to the citizens their tasks, pick out inventors,\r\nphilosophers, artists, and laborers, and set them to work, without\r\ndestroying personal liberty, loses its force when it is remembered that\r\nSocialism involves no such necessity.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist ideal may be said to be a form of social organization in\r\nwhich every individual will enjoy the greatest possible amount of\r\nfreedom for self-development and expression; and in which social\r\nauthority will be reduced to the minimum necessary for the preservation\r\nand insurance of that right to all individuals. There is an\r\nincontestable right of the individual to full and free self-development\r\nand expression so long as no other individual's right to a like freedom\r\nis infringed upon. No individual right can be an _absolute_ right in a\r\nsociety, but must be subject to such restrictions as may be necessary to\r\nsafeguard the like right of every other individual, and of society as a\r\nwhole. _Absolute_ personal liberty is not possible; to grant it to any\r\none individual would be equivalent to denying it to others. If, in a\r\ncertain community, a need is commonly felt for a system of drainage to\r\nprotect the citizens against the perils of a possible outbreak of\r\ntyphoid or some other epidemic disease, and all the citizens agree upon\r\na scheme except two or three, who, in the name of personal liberty,\r\ndeclare that their property must not be touched, what is to be done? If\r\nthe citizens, out of solicitude for the personal liberty of the\r\nobjecting individuals, abandon or modify their plans, is it not clear\r\nthat the liberty of the many has been sacrificed to the liberty of the\r\nfew, which is the essence of tyranny? Absolute individual liberty is\r\nincompatible with social liberty. The liberty of each must, in Mill's\r\nphrase, be bounded by the like liberty of all. Absolute personal liberty\r\nis a chimera, a delusion.\r\n\r\nEven the Anarchist must come to a realization of the fact that liberty\r\nis not an absolute, but a relative and limited, right. Kropotkin, for\r\nexample, realizes that, even under Anarchism, any individual who did\r\nnot live up to his obligations, or who persisted in conducting himself\r\nin a manner obnoxious or injurious to the community, would have to be\r\nexpelled.[183] This is very like Spencer's practical abandonment of the\r\ndoctrine of _laissez faire_ individualism. Says he: \"Many facts have\r\nshown us that while the individual man has acquired liberty as a citizen\r\nand greater religious liberty, he has also acquired greater liberty in\r\nrespect of his occupations; and here we see that he has simultaneously\r\nacquired greater liberty of combination for industrial purposes. Indeed,\r\nin conformity with the universal law of rhythm, _there has been a change\r\nfrom excess of restriction to deficiency of restriction_. As is implied\r\nby legislation now pending, the facilities for forming companies and\r\nraising compound capitals have been too great.\"[184] Here is a very\r\ndefinite confession of the insufficiency of natural law, the failure of\r\nthe _laissez faire_ theory, and a virtual appeal for restrictive and\r\ncoercive legislation.\r\n\r\nThis is inevitable. The dual forces which serve as the motives of\r\nindividual and collective action, spring, unquestionably, from the fact\r\nthat individuals are at once alike and unlike, equal and unequal. Alike\r\nin our needs of certain fundamental necessities, such as food,\r\nclothing, shelter, cooeperation for producing these necessities, for\r\nprotection from foes, human and other, we are unlike in tastes,\r\nappetites, temperaments, character, will, and so on, till our diversity\r\nbecomes as great and as general as our likeness. Now, the problem is to\r\ninsure equal opportunities of full development to all these diversely\r\nconstituted and endowed individuals, and, at the same time, to maintain\r\nthe principle of equal obligations to society on the part of every\r\nindividual. This is the problem of social justice: to insure to each the\r\nsame social opportunities, to secure from each a recognition of the same\r\nobligations toward all. The basic principle of the Socialist state must\r\nbe justice; no privileges or favors can be extended to individuals or\r\ngroups of individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nPolitically, the organization of the Socialist state must be democratic.\r\nSocialism without democracy is as impossible as a shadow without light.\r\nThe word \"Socialism\" applied to schemes of paternalism, and to\r\ngovernment ownership when the vital principle of democracy is lacking,\r\nis a misnomer. As with Peter Bell--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"A primrose by a river's brim,\r\n     A yellow primrose was to him\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand nothing more than that, so there are many persons to whom Socialism\r\nsignifies nothing more than government ownership. Yet it ought to be\r\nperfectly clear that Russia, with her state-owned railways, and liquor\r\nand other monopolies, is no nearer Socialism than the United States. The\r\nsame applies to Germany with her state railways. Externally similar in\r\none respect to Socialism, they radically differ. In so far as they\r\nprepare the necessary forms for Socialism, all examples of public\r\nownership may be said to be \"socialistic,\" or making for Socialism. What\r\nthey lack is a spiritual quality rather than a mechanical one. They are\r\nnot democratic. Socialism is political democracy allied to industrial\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nJustice requires that the legislative power of society rest upon\r\nuniversal adult suffrage, the political equality of all men and women,\r\nexcept lunatics and criminals. It is manifestly unjust to exact\r\nobedience to the laws from those who have had no share in making them\r\nand can have no share in altering them. Of course, there are exceptions\r\nto this principle. We except (1) minors, children not yet arrived at the\r\nage of responsibility agreed upon by the citizens; (2) lunatics and\r\ncertain classes of criminals; (3) aliens, non-citizens temporarily\r\nresident in the state.\r\n\r\nDemocracy in the sense of popular self-government, the \"government of\r\nthe people, by the people, and for the people,\" of which political\r\nrhetoricians boast, is only approximately attainable in any society.\r\nWhile all can equally participate in the legislative power, all cannot\r\nparticipate directly in the administrative power, and it becomes\r\nnecessary, therefore, to adopt the principle of delegated authority,\r\nrepresentative government. But care must be taken to preserve a maximum\r\nof power in the hands of the people. In this respect the United States\r\nConstitution is defective. It is not, and was not intended by its\r\nframers to be, a democratic instrument,[185] and we are vainly trying\r\nto-day to make democratic government through an undemocratic medium. The\r\npolitical democracy of the Socialist state must be real, keeping the\r\npower of government in the hands of the people.\r\n\r\nHow is this to be done? Direct legislation by the people might be\r\nrealized through the adoption of the principles of popular initiative\r\nand referendum. Or, if representative legislative bodies should be\r\ndeemed best, these measures, together with proportional representation\r\nand the right of recall, might be adopted. There is no apparent reason\r\nwhy _all_ legislation, except temporary legislation as in war time,\r\nfamine, plague, and such abnormal conditions, could not be directly\r\ninitiated and enacted, leaving only the just and proper enforcement of\r\nthe law to delegated authority. In practically all the political\r\nprogrammes of Socialist parties throughout the world, these principles\r\nare included at the present time; not merely as means to secure a\r\ngreater degree of political democracy within the existing social state,\r\nbut also, and primarily, to prepare the required political framework of\r\ndemocracy for the industrial commonwealth of the future.\r\n\r\nThe great problem for such a society, politically speaking, consists in\r\nchoosing wisely the trustees of delegated power and authority, and\r\nseeing that they justly and wisely use it for the common good, without\r\nabuse, either for the profit of themselves or their friends, and without\r\nprejudice to any portion of society. Will there be abuses? Will not\r\npolitical manipulators and bosses betray their trusts? To these\r\nquestions, and all other questions of a like nature, the Socialist can\r\nonly give one answer, namely, that there is no such a thing as an\r\n\"automatic democracy,\" that eternal vigilance will be the price of\r\nliberty under Socialism as it has ever been. There can be no other\r\nsafeguard against the usurpation of power than the popular will and\r\nconscience ever alert upon the watch-towers. With political machinery so\r\nresponsive to the popular will when it is asserted and an alert and\r\nvigilant electorate, political democracy attains its maximum\r\ndevelopment. Socialism requires that development.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWith these general principles prevised, we may consider, briefly, the\r\nrespective rights of the individual and of society. The rights of the\r\nindividual may be summarized as follows: There must be freedom of\r\nmovement, including the right to withdraw from the domain of the\r\ngovernment, to migrate at will to other territories. Freedom of movement\r\nis a fundamental condition of personal liberty, but it is easy to see\r\nthat it cannot be made an absolute right. Quarantine laws, for social\r\nprotection, for example, may seriously inconvenience the individual, but\r\nbe imperatively necessary for all that. There must be immunity from\r\narrest, except for infringing others' rights, with compensation of some\r\nkind for improper arrest; respect of the privacy of domicile and\r\ncorrespondence; full liberty of dress, subject to decency; freedom of\r\nutterance, whether by speech or publication, subject only to the\r\nprotection of others from insult, injury, or interference with their\r\nequal liberties, the individual being held responsible to society for\r\nthe proper use of that right. Freedom of the individual in all that\r\npertains to art, science, philosophy, and religion, and their teaching,\r\nor propaganda, is essential. The state can have nothing to do with these\r\nmatters, they belong to the personal life alone.[186] Art, science,\r\nphilosophy, and religion cannot be protected by any authority of the\r\nstate, nor is such authority needed.\r\n\r\nSubject to the ultimate control of society, certainly, but normally free\r\nfrom collective authority and control, these may be regarded as\r\nimperative rights of the individual. Doubtless many Socialists, in\r\ncommon with many Individualists, would considerably extend the list.\r\nSome, for instance, would include the right to possess and bear arms for\r\nthe defense of person and property. On the other hand, it might be\r\nobjected with good show of reason by other Socialists that such a right\r\nmust always be liable to abuses imperiling the peace of society, and\r\nthat the same ends would be served more surely if individual armament\r\nwere made impossible. Again, some Socialists, like some Individualists,\r\nwould include in the category of private acts outside the sphere of law\r\nand social authority the union of the sexes. They would do away with\r\nlegal intervention in marriage and make it and the parental relation\r\nexclusively a private concern. On the other hand, probably an\r\noverwhelming majority of Socialists would object. They would insist that\r\nthe state must, in the interest of the children, and for its own\r\nself-preservation, assume certain responsibilities for, and exercise a\r\ncertain control over, all marriages. They would have the state insist\r\nupon such conditions as mature age, freedom from dangerous diseases and\r\nphysical defects. While believing that under Socialism marriage would no\r\nlonger be subject to economic motives,--matrimonial markets for titles\r\nand fortunes no longer existing,--and that the maximum of personal\r\nfreedom together with the minimum of social authority would be possible\r\nin the union of the sexes, they would still insist upon the necessity of\r\nthat minimum of legal control.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of the legal marriage tie, and the substitution therefor\r\nof voluntary sex union, which so many people believe to be part of the\r\nSocialist programme, is not only not a part of that programme, but is\r\nprobably condemned by more than ninety-five per cent of the Socialists\r\nof the world, and favored by no appreciable proportion of Socialists\r\nmore than non-Socialists. There is no such thing as a Socialist view of\r\nmarriage, any more than there is a Republican or Democratic view of\r\nmarriage; or any more than there is a Socialist view of vaccination,\r\nvivisection, vegetarianism, or homeopathy. The same may be said of the\r\ndrink evil and tobacco smoking. Some Socialists would prohibit both\r\nsmoking and drinking; others would permit smoking, but prohibit the\r\nmanufacture of intoxicating liquors; most Socialists recognize the\r\nevils, especially of drunkenness, but believe that it would be foolish\r\nat this time to state in what manner the evils must be dealt with by the\r\nSocialist state.\r\n\r\nOur hasty summary by no means exhausts the category of personal\r\nliberties, nor does it rigidly define such liberties. To presume to do\r\nthat would be a piece of charlatanry, social quackery of the worst type.\r\nIt is not for the Socialist of to-day to determine what the citizens of\r\na generation hence shall do. The citizens of the future, like the\r\ncitizens of to-day, will be living human beings, not mere automatons;\r\nthey will not accept places and forms imposed upon them, but make their\r\nown. The object of this phase of our discussion is simply to show that\r\nindividual freedom would by no means be crushed out of existence by the\r\nSocialist state. The intolerable bureaucracy of collectivism is wholly\r\nan imaginary evil. There is nothing in the nature of Socialism as it is\r\nunderstood to-day by its adherents which would prevent a wide extension\r\nof personal liberties in the social regime.\r\n\r\nIn the same general manner, we may summarize the principal functions of\r\nthe state[187] as follows: the state has the right and power to organize\r\nand control the economic system, comprehending in that term the\r\nproduction and distribution of all social wealth, wherever private\r\nenterprise is dangerous to the social well-being, or is inefficient;\r\nthe defense of the community from invasion, from fire, flood, famine, or\r\ndisease; the relations with other states, such as trade agreements,\r\nboundary treaties, and the like; the maintenance of order, including the\r\njuridical and police systems in all their branches; and public education\r\nin all its departments. It will be found that these five functions\r\ninclude all the services which the state may properly undertake, and\r\nthat not one of them can safely be intrusted to private enterprise. On\r\nthe other hand, it is not at all necessary to assume that the state must\r\nhave an _absolute monopoly_ of any one of these groups of functions in\r\nthe social organism. It would not be necessary, for example, for the\r\nstate to prohibit its citizens from entering into voluntary relations\r\nwith the citizens of other countries for the promotion of international\r\nfriendship, for trade reciprocity, and so on. Likewise, the juridical\r\nfunctions being in the hands of the state would not prevent voluntary\r\narbitration; or the state guardianship of the public health prevent\r\nvoluntary associations of citizens from taking measures to advance the\r\nhealth of their communities. On the contrary, all such efforts would be\r\nadvantageous to the state. Our study becomes, therefore, a study of\r\nsocial physiology.\r\n\r\nThe principle already postulated, that the state must undertake the\r\nproduction and distribution of wealth wherever private enterprise is\r\ndangerous, or inefficient, clarifies somewhat the problem of the\r\nindustrial organization of the Socialist regime, which is a vastly more\r\ndifficult problem than that of its political organization. Socialism by\r\nno means involves the suppression of all private industrial enterprises.\r\nOnly when these fail in efficiency or result in injustice and inequality\r\nof opportunities does socialization present itself. There are many\r\npetty, subordinate industries, especially the making of articles of\r\nluxury, which might be well allowed to remain in private hands, subject\r\nonly to such general regulation as might be found necessary for the\r\nprotection of health and the public order. For example, suppose that the\r\nstate undertakes the production of shoes upon a large scale as a result\r\nof the popular conviction that private enterprise in shoemaking is\r\neither inefficient or injurious to society in that the manufacturers\r\nexploit the shoemakers on the one hand, and, through the establishment\r\nof monopoly-prices, the consumers upon the other hand. The state thus\r\nbecomes the employer of shoeworkers and the vender of shoes to the\r\ncitizens. But A, being a fastidious citizen, does not like the factory\r\nproduct of the state any more than he formerly did the factory product\r\nof private enterprise. Under the old conditions, he used to employ B, a\r\nshoemaker who does not like factory work, a craftsman who likes to make\r\nthe whole shoe. Naturally, B was not willing to work for wages\r\nmaterially lower than those he could earn in the factory. A willingly\r\npaid enough for his hand-made shoes to insure B as much wages as he\r\nwould get in the factory. What reason could the state possibly have for\r\nforbidding the continuance of such an arrangement between two of its\r\ncitizens?\r\n\r\nOr take the case of a farmer maintaining himself and family upon a\r\nmodest acreage, by his own labor. He exploits no one, and the question\r\nof inefficiency does not present itself as a public question, for the\r\nreason that there is plenty of farming land available, and any\r\ninefficiency of the small farmer does not injure the community in any\r\nmanner. What object could the state have in taking away that farm and\r\ncompelling the farmer to work upon a communal, publicly owned and\r\nmanaged farm? Of course, the notion is perfectly absurd.[188] On the\r\nother hand, there are things, natural monopolies, which cannot be safely\r\nleft to private enterprise. The same is true of large productive and\r\ndistributive enterprises upon which great masses of the people depend.\r\nLand ownership[189] and all that depends thereon, such as mining,\r\ntransportation, and the like, must be collective.\r\n\r\nIt will help us to get rid of the difficulty presented by petty\r\nindustry and agriculture if we bear in mind that collective ownership is\r\nnot, as is commonly supposed, the supreme, fundamental condition of\r\nSocialism. It is proposed only as a means to an end, not as the end\r\nitself. The wealth producers are exploited by a class whose source of\r\nincome is the surplus-value extracted from the workers. Instinctively,\r\nthe workers struggle against that exploitation, to reduce the amount of\r\nsurplus-value taken by the capitalists to a minimum. To do away with\r\nthat exploitation social ownership and control is proposed. If the end\r\ncould be attained more speedily by other methods, those methods would be\r\nadopted. It follows, therefore, that to make collective property of\r\nthings not used as a means of exploiting labor does not necessarily form\r\npart of the Socialist programme. True, some such things might be\r\nsocialized in response to an urgent demand for efficiency, but, of\r\nnecessity, the struggle will be principally concerned with the\r\nsocializing of the means of production which are used as means of\r\nexploitation by a class deriving its income from the surplus-value\r\nproduced by another class. It is easy enough to see that, according to\r\nthis principle of differentiation, it would be necessary to socialize\r\nthe railroad, but not at all necessary to socialize the wheelbarrow;\r\nwhile it would be necessary to socialize a clothing factory, it would\r\nnot be necessary to take away a woman's domestic sewing machine.\r\nIndependent, self-employment, as in the case of a craftsman working in\r\nhis own shop with his own tools, or groups of workers working\r\ncooeperatively, is quite consistent with Socialism.\r\n\r\nIn the Socialist state, then, certain forms of private industry will be\r\ntolerated, and perhaps even definitely encouraged by the state, but the\r\ngreat fundamental economic activities will be collectively managed. The\r\nSocialist state will not be static and, consequently, what at first may\r\nbe regarded as being properly the subject of private enterprise may\r\ndevelop to an extent or in directions which necessitate its\r\ntransformation to the category of essentially social properties. Hence,\r\nit is not possible to give a list of things which would be socialized\r\nand another list of things which would remain private property, but\r\nperfectly possible to state the principle which must be the chief\r\ndeterminant of the extent of socialization. With this principle in mind\r\nit is fairly possible to sketch the outlines at least of the economic\r\ndevelopment of the collectivist commonwealth; the conditions essential\r\nto that stage of social evolution at which it will be possible and\r\nnatural to speak of capitalism as a past and outgrown stage, and of the\r\npresent as the era of Socialism.\r\n\r\nSocialists, naturally, differ very materially upon this point. Probably,\r\nhowever, an overwhelming majority of the leaders of Socialist thought in\r\nEurope and this country would agree with the writer that it is fairly\r\nprobable that the economic structure of the new society will include at\r\nleast the following measures of socialization: (1) Ownership of all\r\nnatural resources, such as land, mines, forests, waterways, oil wells,\r\nand so on; (2) operation of all the means of transportation and\r\ncommunication other than those of purely personal service; (3) operation\r\nof all industrial production involving large compound capitals and\r\nassociated labor, except where carried on by voluntary, democratic\r\ncooeperation, with the necessary regulation by the state; (4)\r\norganization of all labor essential to the public service, such as the\r\nbuilding of schools, hospitals, docks, roads, bridges, sewers, and the\r\nlike; the construction of all the machinery and plant requisite to the\r\nsocial production and distribution, and of things necessary for the\r\nmaintenance of those engaged in such public services as the national\r\ndefense and all who are wards of the state; (5) a monopoly of the\r\nmonetary and credit functions, including coinage, banking, mortgaging,\r\nand the extension of credit to private enterprise.\r\n\r\nWith these economic activities undertaken by the state, a pure democracy\r\ndiffering vitally from all the class-dominated states of history,\r\nprivate enterprise would by no means be excluded, but limited to an\r\nextent making the exploitation of labor and public needs and interests\r\nfor private gain impossible. Socialism thus becomes the defender of\r\nindividual liberty, not its enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAs owner of the earth and all the major instruments of production and\r\nexchange, society would occupy a position which would enable it to\r\ninsure that the physical and mental benefits derived from its wealth,\r\nits natural resources, its collective experience, genius, and labor,\r\nwere universalized as befits a democracy. It would be able to guarantee\r\nto all its citizens the right to labor, through preventing private or\r\nclass monopolization of the land and instruments of production and\r\nsocial opportunities in general. It would be in a position to make every\r\ndevelopment from competition to monopoly the occasion for further\r\nsocialization. Thus there would be no danger to the state in permitting,\r\nor even fostering, private industry within the limits described. As the\r\norganizer of the vast body of labor essential to the operation of the\r\nmain productive and distributive functions of society, and to the other\r\npublic services, the state would automatically, so to speak, set the\r\nstandards of income and leisure which private industry would be\r\ncompelled, by competitive force, to observe. The regulation of\r\nproduction, too, would be possible, and as a result the crises arising\r\nfrom glutted markets would disappear. Finally, in the control of all the\r\nfunctions of credit, the state would effectually prevent the\r\nexploitation of the mass of the people through financial agencies, one\r\nof the greatest evils of our present system.\r\n\r\nThe application of the principles of democracy to the organization and\r\nadministration of these great economic services of production, exchange,\r\nand credit is a problem full of alluring invitations to speculation.\r\n\"This that they call the Organization of Labor,\" said Carlyle, \"is the\r\nUniversal Vital Problem of the World.\" This description applies not to\r\nwhat we commonly mean by the \"organization of labor,\" namely, the\r\norganization of the laborers in unions for class conflict, but to the\r\norganization of the brain and muscle of the world to secure the greatest\r\nefficiency. This is the great central problem of the socialization of\r\nindustry and the state, before which all other problems pale into\r\ninsignificance. It is comparatively easy to picture an ideal political\r\ndemocracy; and the main structural economic organization of the\r\nSocialist regime, with its private and public functions more or less\r\nclearly defined, is not very difficult of conception. These are\r\nforeshadowed with varying degrees of distinctness in present society,\r\nand the light of experience illumines the pathway before us. It is when\r\nwe come to the methods of organization and management, the _spirit_ of\r\nthe economic organization of the future state, that the light fails and\r\nwe must grope our way into the great unknown with imagination and our\r\nsense of justice for guides.\r\n\r\nMost Socialist writers who have attempted to deal with this subject\r\nhave simply regarded the state as the greatest employer of labor,\r\ncarrying on its business upon lines not materially different from those\r\nadopted by the great corporations of to-day. Boards of experts, chosen\r\nby civil service methods, directing all the economic activities of the\r\nstate--such is their general conception of the industrial democracy of\r\nthe Socialist regime. They believe, in other words, that the methods now\r\nemployed by the capitalist state, and by individual and corporate\r\nemployers within the capitalist state, would simply be extended under\r\nthe Socialist regime. If this be so, a psychological anomaly in the\r\nSocialist propaganda appears in the practical abandonment of the claim\r\nthat, as a result of the class conflict in society, the public ownership\r\nevolved within the capitalist state is essentially different from, and\r\ninferior to, the public ownership of the Socialist ideal. It is\r\nperfectly clear that if the industrial organization under Socialism is\r\nto be such that the workers employed in any industry have no more voice\r\nin its management than the postal employees in this country, for\r\nexample, have at the present time, it cannot be otherwise than absurd to\r\nspeak of it as an industrial democracy.\r\n\r\nHere, in truth, lies the crux of the greatest problem of all. We must\r\nface the fact that, in anything worthy the name of an industrial\r\ndemocracy, the terms and conditions of employment cannot be wholly\r\ndecided without regard to the will of the workers themselves on the one\r\nhand, nor, on the other hand, by the workers alone without reference to\r\nthe general body of the citizenry. If the former method fails to satisfy\r\nthe requirements of democracy by ignoring the will of the workers in the\r\norganization of their work, the alternate method involves a hierarchical\r\ngovernment, equally incompatible with democracy. Some way must be found\r\nby which the industrial government of society, the organization of\r\nproduction and distribution, may be securely and fairly based upon the\r\ndual basis of common civic rights and the rights of the workers in their\r\nspecial relations as such.\r\n\r\nAnd here we are not wholly left to our imaginations, not wholly without\r\nexperience to guide us. In actual practice to-day, in those industries\r\nin which the organization of the workers into unions has been most\r\nsuccessful, the workers, through their organizations, do exercise a\r\ncertain amount of control over the conditions of their employment. Their\r\nright to share in the determination of the conditions of labor is\r\nconceded. They make trade agreements, for instance, in which such\r\nmatters as wages, hours of labor, apprenticeship, output, engagement and\r\ndischarge of workers, and numerous other matters, are provided for and\r\nmade subject to the joint control of the workers and their employers. Of\r\ncourse, this share in the control of the industry in which they are\r\nemployed is a right enjoyed only as a fruit of conquest, won by war and\r\nmaintained by ceaseless vigilance and armed strength. It is not\r\ninconceivable that in the Socialist state there might be a frank\r\nextension of this principle. The workers in the main groups of\r\nindustries might form autonomous organizations for the administration of\r\ntheir special interests, subject only to certain fundamental laws of the\r\nstate. Thus the trade unions of to-day would evolve into administrative\r\npolitico-economic organizations, after the manner of the mediaeval\r\nguilds, and become constructive agencies in society instead of mere\r\nagencies of class warfare as at present.\r\n\r\nThe economic organization of the Socialist state would consist, then, of\r\nthree distinct divisions, as follows: (1) Private production and\r\nexchange, subject only to such general supervision and control by the\r\nstate as the interests of society demand, such as protection against\r\nmonopolization, sanitary laws, and the like; (2) voluntary cooeperation,\r\nsubject to similar supervision and control; (3) production and\r\ndistribution by the state, the administration to be by the autonomous\r\norganizations of the workers in industrial groups, subject to the\r\nfundamental laws and government of society as a whole.[190]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTwo other functions of the economic organization of society remain to be\r\nconsidered, the distribution of labor and its remuneration. In the\r\norganization of industry society will have to achieve a twofold result,\r\na maximum of general, social efficiency, on the one hand, and of\r\npersonal liberty and comfort to the workers on the other. The state\r\nwould not only guarantee the right to labor, but, as a corollary, it\r\nwould impose the duty of labor upon every competent person. The Pauline\r\ninjunction, \"If any man will not work, neither shall he eat,\" would be\r\napplied in the Socialist state to all except the incompetent to labor.\r\nThe immature child, the aged, the sick and infirm members of society,\r\nwould alone be exempted from labor. The result of this would be that\r\ninstead of a large unemployed army, vainly seeking the right to work, on\r\nthe one hand, accompanied by the excessive overwork of the great mass of\r\nthe workers fortunate enough to be employed, a vast increase in the\r\nnumber of producers from this one cause alone would make possible much\r\ngreater leisure for the whole body of workers. Benjamin Franklin\r\nestimated that in his day four hours' labor from every adult male able\r\nto work would be more than sufficient to provide wealth enough for human\r\nwants; and it is certain that, without resorting to any standards of\r\nSpartan simplicity, Franklin's estimate could be easily realised to-day\r\nwith anything approaching a scientific organization of labor.\r\n\r\nNot only would the productive forces be enormously increased by the\r\nabsorption of those workers who under the present system are unemployed,\r\nand those who do not labor or seek labor; in addition to these, there\r\nwould be a tremendous transference of potential productive energy from\r\noccupations rendered obsolete and unnecessary by the socialization of\r\nsociety. Thus there are to-day tens of thousands of bankers, lawyers,\r\ntraders, middlemen, speculators, advertisers, and others, whose\r\nfunctions, necessary to the capitalist system, would in most cases\r\ndisappear. Because of this, they would be compelled to enter the\r\nproducing class. The possibilities of the scientific organization of\r\nindustry are therefore almost unlimited. Every gain made by the state in\r\nthe direction of economy of production would test the private enterprise\r\nexisting and urge it onward in the same direction. Likewise, every gain\r\nmade by the private producers would test the social production and urge\r\nit onward. Whether socialized production extended its sphere, or\r\nremained confined to its minimum limitations, would depend upon the\r\ncomparative success or failure resulting. The state would not be a force\r\noutside of the people, arbitrarily extending its functions regardless of\r\ntheir will. The decision would rest with the people; they would _be_ the\r\nstate, and would, naturally, resort to social effort only where it\r\ndemonstrated its ability to serve the community more efficiently than\r\nprivate enterprise, with greater comfort and liberty to the individual\r\nand to the community.\r\n\r\nWhile in the Socialist regime labor would be compulsory, it is\r\ninconceivable that a free people would tolerate a bureaucratic rule\r\nassigning to each individual his or her proper task, no matter how\r\ningenious the assignment might be. Even if the bureaucracy were\r\nomniscient, such a condition of life would be intolerable. Just as it is\r\nnecessary to insist that all must be secured in their right to labor,\r\nand required to labor, it is necessary also that the choice of one's\r\noccupation should be as far as possible personal and free, subject only\r\nto the laws of supply and demand. The greatest amount of personal\r\nfreedom compatible with the requisite efficiency would be secured to the\r\nworkers in their chosen occupations through their craft organizations.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be objected, all occupations are not equally desirable.\r\nThere are certain forms of work which, disagreeable in themselves, are\r\njust as essential to the well-being of society as the most artistic and\r\npleasing. Who will do the dirty work, and the dangerous work, under\r\nSocialism? Will these occupations also be left to choice, and, if so,\r\nwill there not be an insurmountable difficulty arising from the natural\r\nreluctance of men to choose such work?\r\n\r\nIn answering the question and affirming the principle of free\r\nchoice--for so it must be answered--the Socialist is called upon to show\r\nthat the absence of compulsion would not involve the neglect of these\r\ndisagreeable, but highly important, social services; that it would be\r\ncompatible with social safety to leave them to personal choice. In the\r\nfirst place, much of this kind of work that is now performed by human\r\nlabor could be more efficiently done by mechanical means. Much of the\r\nwork done by sweated women and children in our cities is in fact done in\r\ncompetition with machines. Machinery has been invented, and is now\r\navailable, to do thousands of the disagreeable and hurtful things now\r\ndone by human beings. Professor Franklin H. Giddings is perfectly right\r\nwhen he says: \"Modern civilization does not require, it does not need,\r\nthe drudgery of needle-women or the crushing toil of men in a score of\r\nlife-destroying occupations. If these wretched beings should drop out\r\nof existence and no others take their places, the economic activities of\r\nthe world would not greatly suffer. A thousand devices latent in\r\ninventive brains would quickly make good any momentary loss.\"[191]\r\n\r\nWhen, in England, a law was passed forbidding the practice of forcing\r\nlittle boys through chimneys, to clean them, chimneys did not cease to\r\nbe swept. Other, less disagreeable and less dangerous, means were\r\nquickly invented. When the woolen manufacturers were prevented from\r\nemploying little boys and girls, they invented the piecing machine.[192]\r\nThousands of instances might be compiled in support of the contention of\r\nProfessor Giddings, equally as pertinent as these. Another important\r\npoint is that the amount of such disagreeable and dangerous work to be\r\ndone would be very much less than now. That would be an inevitable\r\nresult of the scientific organization of industry. It is likely that, if\r\nthe subject could be properly investigated, it could be shown that the\r\namount of such labor involved in wasteful and unnecessary advertising\r\nalone is enormous.\r\n\r\nAddressing an audience composed mainly of scientific men upon the\r\nsubject of Socialism, the writer was once questioned upon this phase of\r\nthe subject. \"Gentlemen,\" was the reply, \"it is impossible for me to\r\nsay exactly how the intelligence of the people in a more or less remote\r\nfuture will solve the problem. The Socialist state will be a democracy,\r\nnot a dictatorship. But if I were dictator of society to-day and wanted\r\nto solve the problem, I should assign to such men as yourselves all the\r\nmost disagreeable and dangerous tasks I could find. This I should do\r\nbecause I should know that at once your inventive brains would begin to\r\ndevise mechanical and other means of doing the work. You would make\r\nsewer cleaning as pleasant as any other occupation in the world.\" There\r\nwas, of course, nothing original in the reply, but the men of science\r\nrecognized its force, and it fairly states one important part of the\r\nSocialist answer to the objection we are discussing. Still, with all\r\npossible reduction of the quantity of such work to be done, and with all\r\nthe mechanical genius brought to bear upon it, we may freely concede\r\nthat, for a long time to come, there must be some work quite dangerous,\r\naltogether disagreeable and repellent, and a great difference in the\r\ndegree of attractiveness of some occupations as compared with some\r\nothers. But an occupation repellent in itself might be made attractive,\r\nif the hours of labor were relatively few as compared with other\r\noccupations. If six hours be regarded as the normal working day, it is\r\nquite easy to believe that, for sake of the larger leisure, with its\r\nopportunities for the pursuit of special interests, many a man would\r\ngladly accept a disagreeable position for three hours a day.\r\n\r\nThe same holds true of superior remuneration. Under the Socialist\r\nregime, just as to-day, many a man would gladly exchange his work for\r\nless pleasant work, if the remuneration offered were higher. To the old\r\nUtopian ideas of absolute equality and uniformity of income these\r\nmethods would be fatal, but they are not at all incompatible with\r\nmodern, scientific Socialism. Nothing could well be sillier, or more\r\nfutile, than the Rooseveltian attacks upon the Socialism of to-day as if\r\nit meant equality of possession, or equality of anything except\r\nopportunity.[193] Finally, in connection with this question, we must not\r\nforget that there is a natural inequality of talent, of power. In any\r\nstate of society most men will prefer to do the things they are best\r\nfitted for, the things they can do best. The man who feels himself to be\r\nbest fitted to be a hewer of wood or a drawer of water will choose that\r\nrather than some loftier task. There is no reason at all to suppose that\r\nleaving the choice of occupation to the individual would involve the\r\nslightest risk to society.\r\n\r\nWhile equality of remuneration, meaning by that uniformity of reward\r\nfor labor, is not an essential condition of the Socialist regime, it may\r\nbe freely admitted that _approximate equality of income_ is the ideal to\r\nbe ultimately aimed at. Otherwise, if there should be the present\r\ninequality of remuneration, represented by the enormous salary of a\r\nmanager like Mr. Schwab, to quote a conspicuous example, and the meager\r\nwage of the average laborer, class formations must take place and the\r\nold problems incidental to economic inequality reappear. There is no\r\nneed to regard uniformity of reward for all as the only solution of this\r\nproblem, however. Given such an industrial democracy as is herein\r\nsuggested as the essential condition of Socialism, there is little\r\nreason to doubt that gradually, by the free play of economic law,\r\napproximate equality would be attained. This brings us to the method of\r\nthe remuneration of labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nSocialists are too often judged by their shibboleths, rather than by the\r\nprinciples which those shibboleths imperfectly express, or seek to\r\nexpress. Declaiming, rightly, against the wages system as a form of\r\nslave labor,[194] the \"abolition of wage slavery,\" forever inscribed on\r\ntheir banners, the average man is forced to the conclusion that the\r\nSocialists are working for a system in which the workers will divide\r\ntheir actual products and then barter the surplus for the surplus\r\nproducts of other workers. Either that, or the most rigid system of\r\ngovernmental production and a method of distributing rations and\r\nuniforms similar to that which obtains in the military organization of\r\npresent-day governments. It is easily seen, however, that such plans do\r\nnot conform to the democratic ideals of the Socialists, on the one hand,\r\nnor would either of them, on the other hand, be compatible with the wide\r\npersonal liberty herein put forward as characteristic of the Socialist\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe earlier Utopian Socialists did propose to do away with wages; in\r\nfact, they proposed to do away with money altogether, and invented\r\nvarious forms of \"Labor Notes\" as a means of giving equality of\r\nremuneration for given quantities of labor, and providing a medium for\r\nthe exchange of wealth. But when the Socialists of to-day speak of the\r\n\"abolition of wages,\" or of the wages system, they use the words in the\r\nsame sense as they speak of the abolition of capital: _they would\r\nabolish only the social relations implied in the terms_. Just as they do\r\nnot mean by the abolition of capital the destruction of the machinery\r\nand implements of production, but the social relation in which they are\r\nused to create profit for the few, so, when they speak of the abolition\r\nof the wages system, they mean only the use of wages to exploit the\r\nproducers for the gain of the owners of the means of production and\r\nexchange. Though the name \"wages\" might not be changed, a money payment\r\nfor labor in a democratic arrangement of industry, representing an\r\napproximation to the full value of the labor, minus only its share of\r\nthe cost of maintaining the public services, and the weaker, dependent\r\nmembers of society, would be vastly different from a money payment for\r\nlabor by one individual to other individuals, representing an\r\napproximation to their cost of living, bearing no definite relation to\r\nthe value of their labor products, and paid in lieu of those products\r\nwith a view to the gathering of a rich surplus value by the payer.\r\n\r\nKarl Kautsky, perhaps the greatest living exponent of the theories of\r\nmodern Socialism, has made this point perfectly clear. He accepts\r\nwithout reserve the belief that wages, unequal and paid in money, will\r\nbe the method of remuneration for labor in the Socialist regime.[195]\r\nWhen too many laborers rush into certain branches of industry, the\r\nnatural way to lessen their number and to increase the number of\r\nlaborers in other branches where there is need for them, will be to\r\nreduce wages in the one and to increase them in the other. Socialism,\r\ninstead of being defined as an attempt to make men equal, might perhaps\r\nbe more justly and accurately defined as a social system based upon the\r\nnatural inequalities of mankind. Not human equality, but equality of\r\nopportunity, and the prevention of the creation of artificial\r\ninequalities by privilege, is the essence of Socialism.\r\n\r\nWhat, it may be asked, will society do to prevent the hoarding of wealth\r\non the one hand, and the exploitation of the spendthrift by the\r\nabstinent upon the other? Here, as throughout this discussion, we must\r\nbe careful to refrain from laying down dogmatic rules, giving\r\ncategorical replies to questions which the future will settle in its own\r\nway. At best, we can only reason as to what possible answers are\r\ncompatible with the fundamental principles of Socialism. Thus we may\r\nsafely answer that in the Socialist regime society will not attempt to\r\ndictate to the individual how he shall spend his income. If Jones\r\nprefers _objets d'art_, and Smith prefers fast horses or a steam yacht,\r\neach will be free to follow his inclinations so far as his resources\r\nwill permit. If, on the contrary, one should prefer to hoard his wealth,\r\nhe would be free to do so. The inheritance of such accumulated property,\r\nother than personal objects, of course, might be denied, the state being\r\nmade the only possible inheritor of such accumulated property. Even in\r\nthe absence of such a regulation, the inheritance of hoarded wealth\r\nwould not be a serious matter and would speedily adjust itself. There\r\nwould be no opportunity for its _investment_, so that at most\r\nindividuals inheriting such property would be enabled to live idly, or\r\nwith extra luxury, until it was spent. The fact of inheriting property\r\nwould not give the individual power over the life and labor of others.\r\nBy either method, full play for individual liberty would be coupled with\r\nfull economic security for society. There would be no danger of the\r\ndevelopment of a ruling class as a result of natural inequalities.\r\n\r\nWith such conditions as these, it is not difficult nor in any sense\r\nromantic to suppose that the tendency to hoard wealth would largely\r\ndisappear. In the same way we must regard the possibilities of the\r\nexploitation of man by man developing in the Socialist state, through\r\nthe wastefulness and improvidence of the one and the frugality,\r\nabstinence, and cunning of the other, as slight. With the credit\r\nfunctions entirely in the hands of the state, the improvident man would\r\nbe able to obtain credit upon the same securities as from a private\r\ncreditor, without extortion. Society would further secure itself against\r\nthe weakness and failure of the improvident by insuring all its members\r\nagainst sickness, accident, and old age.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThe administration of justice is necessarily a social function in a\r\ndemocratic society. All juridical functions should be socialized in the\r\nstrict sense of being maintained at the social expense for the free\r\nservice of its citizens. Court fees, advocates' charges, and other\r\nexpenses incidental to the administration of justice in present society\r\nare all anti-democratic and subversive of justice.\r\n\r\nFinally, education is likewise a social necessity which society itself\r\nmust assume responsibility for. We have discovered that for\r\nself-protection society must insist upon a certain minimum of education\r\nfor every child able to receive it; that it is too vital a matter to be\r\nleft to the option of parents or the desires of the immature child. We\r\nhave made a certain minimum of education compulsory and free; the\r\nSocialist state would make a minimum--probably much larger than our\r\npresent minimum--compulsory, but it would also make _all_ education\r\nfree. From the first stages, in the kindergartens, to the last, in the\r\nuniversities, education must be wholly free or equality of opportunity\r\ncannot be realized. So long as a single barrier exists to prevent any\r\nchild from receiving all the education it is capable of profiting by,\r\ndemocracy is unattained.\r\n\r\nWhether the Socialist state could tolerate the existence of elementary\r\nschools other than its own, such as privately conducted kindergartens,\r\nreligious schools, and so on, is by no means agreed upon by Socialists.\r\nIt is like the question of marriage, a matter which is wholly beyond the\r\nscope of present knowledge. The future will decide for itself. There are\r\nthose who believe that the state would not content itself with refusing\r\nto permit religious doctrines or ideas to be taught in the schools, but\r\nwould go further, and, as the protector of the child, guard its\r\nindependence of thought in later life as far as possible by forbidding\r\nreligious teaching of any kind in schools for children below a certain\r\nage. It would not, of course, attempt to prevent parental instruction in\r\nreligious beliefs in the home. Beyond the age prescribed, religious\r\neducation, in all other than public institutions of learning, would be\r\nfreely admitted. This restriction of religious education to the years of\r\njudgment and discretion implies no hostility to religion on the part of\r\nthe state, but complete neutrality. Not the least important of the\r\nrights of the child is the right to be protected from influences which\r\nbias the mind and destroy the possibilities of independent thought in\r\nlater life, or make it attainable only as a result of bitter, needless,\r\ntragic experience. This is one view. On the other hand, there are\r\nprobably quite as many Socialists who believe that the state would not\r\nattempt to prevent the religious education of children of any age, in\r\nschools voluntarily maintained for that purpose, independent of the\r\npublic schools. They believe that the state would content itself with\r\ninsisting that these religious schools must be so built and equipped as\r\nnot to imperil the lives or the health of the children attending them,\r\nand so conducted as not to interfere with the public schools,--all of\r\nwhich means simply that, like vaccination, and the form of marriage\r\ncontract, the question will be settled by the future in its own way.\r\nThere is nothing in the fundamental principles of Socialism, nor any\r\nbody of facts in our present experience, from which we can judge the\r\nmanner of that settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this brief outline of the Socialist state as the writer, in common\r\nwith many of his associates, conceives it, there are many gaps. The\r\ntemptation to fill in the outline somewhat more in detail is strong, but\r\nthat is beyond the borderland which divides scientific and Utopian\r\nmethods. The purpose of the outline is mainly to show that the ideal of\r\nthe Socialism of to-day is something far removed from the network of\r\nlaws and the oppressive bureaucracy commonly imagined; something wholly\r\ndifferent in spirit and substance from the mechanical arrangement of\r\nhuman relations imagined by Utopian romancers. If the Socialist\r\npropaganda of to-day largely consists of the advocacy of laws for the\r\nprotection of labor and dealing with all kinds of evils, it must be\r\nremembered that these are to _ameliorate conditions in the existing\r\nsocial order_. Many of the laws for which Socialists have most\r\nstrenuously fought have their _raison d'etre_ in the conditions of\r\ncapitalist society, and would be quite unnecessary under Socialism. If a\r\nreference to one's personal work may be pardoned, I will cite the matter\r\nof the feeding of school children, in the public schools, at the public\r\nexpense. I have, for many years, advocated this measure, which is to be\r\nfound in most Socialist programmes, and which the Socialists of other\r\ncountries have to a considerable extent carried into practical effect.\r\nYet, I am free to say that the plan is not my ideal of the manner in\r\nwhich children should be fed. It is, at best, a palliative, a necessary\r\nevil, rendered necessary by the conditions of capitalist society. One\r\nhopes that in the Socialist regime, home life would be so far developed\r\nas to make possible the proper feeding and care of all children in their\r\nhomes. This is but an illustration. The Socialist ideal of the state of\r\nthe future, when private property is no longer an instrument of\r\noppression used by the few against the many, is not a life completely\r\nenmeshed in a network of government, but a life controlled by government\r\nas little as possible; not a life ruled and driven by a powerful engine\r\nof laws, but a life as spontaneous and free as possible--a maximum of\r\npersonal freedom with a minimum of restraint.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"These things shall be! A loftier race\r\n     Than e'er the world hath known shall rise\r\n     With flower of freedom in their souls\r\n     And light of science in their eyes.\"[196]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[180] Cf. _Das Erfurter Program_, by Karl Kautsky.\r\n\r\n[181] Cf.

A fanatical religious sect practicing human sacrifice, for\r\ninstance, could not be tolerated by any civilized society. Obscenity in\r\nart is another example.\r\n\r\n[187] I use the word \"state\" throughout this discussion in its largest,\r\nmost comprehensive sense, as meaning the whole political organization of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n[188] This view is fully shared by Kautsky, _Agrarfrage_, pages 443-444,\r\nand by Paul Lafargue, _Revue Politique et Parliamentaire_, October,\r\n1898, page 70.\r\n\r\n[189] Of course, this does not mean that there must not be private _use_\r\nof land.\r\n\r\n[190] The student who cares to pursue the subject will find that this\r\nanalysis is, in the main, agreed to by the most eminent exponents of\r\nMarxian Socialism to-day.

Addington Symonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE MEANS OF REALIZATION[197]\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nYou ask me how the goal I have described is to be attained: \"The\r\npicture,\" you say, \"is attractive, but we would like to know how we are\r\nto reach the Promised Land which it pictures. Show us the way!\" The\r\nquestion is a fair one, and I shall try to answer it with candor, as it\r\ndeserves. But I cannot promise to tell how the change will be brought\r\nabout, to describe the exact process by which social property will\r\nsupplant capitalist private property. The only conditions under which\r\nany honest thinker could give such an answer would necessitate a\r\ncombination of circumstances which has never existed, and which no one\r\nseriously expects to develop. To answer in definite terms, saying, \"This\r\nis the manner in which the change will be made,\" one would have to know\r\nthe exact time of the change; precisely what things would be socialized;\r\nthe thought of the people, their temper, their courage. In a word,\r\nomniscience would be necessary to enable one to make such a reply.\r\n\r\nAll that is possible in this connection for the candid Socialist is to\r\npoint out those tendencies which he believes to be making for the\r\nSocialist ideal, those tendencies in society, whether political or\r\neconomic, which are making for industrial democracy; to consider frankly\r\nthe difficulties which must be overcome before the transition from\r\ncapitalism can be effected, and to suggest such means of overcoming\r\nthese as present themselves to the mind, always remembering that other\r\nmeans may be developed which we cannot now see, and that great storms of\r\nelemental human passion may sweep the current into channels unsuspected.\r\n\r\nThose who are familiar with the writings of Marx know that, in strange\r\ncontrast with the fundamental principles of that theory of social\r\nevolution which he so well developed, he lapsed at times into the\r\nUtopian habit of predicting the sudden transformation of society.\r\nCapitalism was to end in a great final \"catastrophe\" and the new order\r\nbe born in the travail of a \"social revolution.\" I remember that when I\r\njoined the Socialist movement, many years ago, the Social Revolution was\r\na very real event, inevitable and nigh at hand, to most of us. The more\r\nenthusiastic of us dreamed of it; we sang songs in the spirit of the\r\n_Chansons Revolutionaires_, one of which, as I recall, told plainly\r\nenough what we would do--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"When the Revolution comes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSome comrades actually wanted to have military drill at our business\r\nmeetings, merely that we might be ready for the Revolution, which might\r\noccur any Monday morning or Friday afternoon. If this seems strange and\r\ncomic as I relate it to-day, please remember that we were very few and\r\nvery young, and, therefore, very sure that we were to redeem the world.\r\nWe lived in a state of revolutionary ecstasy. Some of us, I think, must\r\nhave gone regularly to sleep in the mental state of Tennyson's May\r\nQueen, with words equivalent to her childish admonition--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"If you're waking call me early,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nso fearful were we that the Revolution might start without us!\r\n\r\nThere can be no harm in these confessions to-day, for we have grown far\r\nenough beyond that period to laugh at it in retrospect. True, there is\r\nstill a good deal of talk about the Social Revolution, and there may be\r\na few Socialists here and there who use the term in the sense I have\r\ndescribed; who believe that capitalism will come to a great crisis, that\r\nthere will be a rising of millions in wrath, a night of fury and agony,\r\nand then the sunrise of Brotherhood above the blood-stained valley and\r\nthe corpse-strewn plain. But most of us, when we use the old term, by\r\nsheer force of habit, or as an inherited tradition, think of the Social\r\nRevolution in no such spirit. We think only of the change that must\r\ncome over society, transferring the control of its life from the few to\r\nthe many, the change that is now going on all around us. When the time\r\ncomes that men and women speak of the state in which they live as\r\nSocialism, and look back upon the life we live to-day with wonder and\r\npity, they will speak of the period of revolution as including this very\r\nyear, and, possibly, all the years included in the lives of the youngest\r\npersons present. At all events, no considerable body of Socialists\r\nanywhere in the world to-day, and no Socialist whose words have any\r\ninfluence in the movement, believe that there will be a sudden, violent\r\nchange from capitalism to Socialism.\r\n\r\nIf it seemed necessary, abundant testimony to the truthfulness of this\r\nclaim could be produced. But I shall content myself with two\r\nwitnesses--chosen from the multitude of available witnesses for reasons\r\nwhich will unfold themselves. The first witness is Marx himself. I\r\nchoose his testimony, mainly, because there is no other name so great as\r\nhis, and, secondly, to show that his profoundest thought rejected the\r\nidea of sudden social transformations which at times he seemed to favor.\r\nIt is 1850. Marx is in London, actively engaged in a German Communist\r\nmovement with its Central Committee in that great metropolis. The\r\nmajority are impatient, feverishly urging revolt; they are under the\r\nillusion that they can make the Social Revolution at once. Marx tells\r\nthem, on the contrary, that it will take fifty years \"not only to change\r\nexisting conditions but to change yourselves and make yourselves worthy\r\nof political power.\" They, the majority, say on the other hand, \"We\r\nought to get power at once, or else give up the fight.\" Marx tries\r\nvainly to make them see this, and resigns when he fails, scornfully\r\ntelling them that they \"substitute revolutionary phrases for\r\n_revolutionary evolution_.\"[198] Mark well that term, \"revolutionary\r\nevolution,\" for it bears out the description I have attempted of the\r\nsense in which we speak of revolution in the Socialist propaganda of\r\nto-day. And mark well, also, that Marx gave them fifty years simply to\r\nmake themselves worthy of political power.\r\n\r\nAs the second witness, I choose Liebknecht, whose name must always be\r\nassociated with those of Marx, Engels, and Lassalle, in Socialist\r\nhistory. Not alone because of the fact that Liebknecht, more than almost\r\nany other man, has influenced the tactics of the international Socialist\r\nmovement, but for the additional reason that detached phrases of his are\r\nsometimes quoted in support of the opposite view. Words spoken in\r\noratorical and forensic passion, or in the bravado of irresponsible\r\nyouthfulness, and texts torn from their contexts, are used to show that\r\nLiebknecht anticipated the violent transformation of society. But heed\r\nthis, one of many similar statements of his maturest and profoundest\r\nthought: \"_But we are not going to attain Socialism at one bound. The\r\ntransition is going on all the time_, and the important thing for us ...\r\nis not to paint a picture of the future--which in any case would be\r\nuseless labor--_but to forecast a practical programme for the\r\nintermediate period, to formulate and justify measures that shall be\r\napplicable at once, and that will serve as aids to the new Socialist\r\nbirth_.\"[199]\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for quotations from the mightiest of all our hosts. What\r\nI would make clear is not merely that the greatest of Socialist\r\ntheorists and tacticians agree that the change will be brought about\r\ngradually, and not by one stroke of revolutionary action, but that, more\r\nimportant still, the Socialist Party of this country, and all the\r\nSocialist parties of the world, are based upon that idea. That is why\r\nthey have their political programmes, aiming to make the conditions of\r\nlife better now, in the transition period, and also to aid in the happy,\r\npeaceful birth of the new order.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHaving disposed of the notion that Socialists expect to realize their\r\nideals by a single stroke, and thus swept away some of the greatest\r\nobstacles which rise before the imagination of the student of\r\nSocialism, we obtain a clearer vision of the problem. And that is no\r\nsmall advance toward its solution.\r\n\r\nConcerning the political organization of the Socialist state, so far as\r\nthe extension of political democracy is concerned, not much need be\r\nsaid. You can very readily comprehend that this may be done by legal,\r\nconstitutional means. Step by step, just as we attain power enough to do\r\nso, we shall extend the power of the people until we have a complete\r\npolitical democracy. Where, as in some of the Southern States, there is\r\nvirtually a property qualification for the franchise, where that remnant\r\nof feudalism, the poll tax, remains, Socialists, whenever they come into\r\npower in those states, or whenever they are strong enough to force the\r\nissue, will insist upon making the franchise free. And where, as in this\r\nstate, there is a sex qualification for the franchise, women being\r\ndenied the suffrage, they will work unceasingly to do away with that\r\nrelic of barbarism. By means of such measures as the Initiative and\r\nReferendum, and election of judges by the people, the sovereignty of the\r\npeople will be established. It may be that without some constitutional\r\namendments it will be found impossible to make political democracy\r\ncomplete. In that case, moving along the line of least resistance, they\r\nwill do all that they can within the limits of the Constitution as it\r\nis, changing it whenever by reason of their power they deem that\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\nAs to the organization of the industrial life of the Socialist state,\r\nbringing industry from private to public control, here, too, Socialists\r\nwill work along the line of least resistance. First of all, it must be\r\nremembered that there are tendencies to that end within society at\r\npresent. Every development of industry and commerce, from competition to\r\nmonopoly, so far as it centers the control in few hands and organizes\r\nthe industry or business, makes it possible to take it over without\r\ndislocation, and, at the same time, makes it the interest of a larger\r\nnumber to help in bringing about that transfer. In like manner every\r\nvoluntary cooeperative organization of producers makes for the Socialist\r\nideal. This is a far less important matter in the United States than in\r\nEngland and other European countries. Finally, we have the enormous\r\nextension of public functions developed already in capitalist society,\r\nand being constantly extended. Our postal system, public schools, state\r\nuniversities, libraries, museums, art galleries, parks, bureaus of\r\nresearch and information, hospitals, sanatoria, municipal ferries, water\r\nsupply, fire departments, health boards, lighting systems, these, and a\r\nthousand other activities of our municipalities and states, and the\r\nnation, are so many forms created by capitalism to meet its own needs\r\nwhich belong, however, to Socialism and require only to be infused with\r\nthe Socialist spirit. This will be done as they come under the\r\ninfluence of Socialists elected to various legislative and\r\nadministrative bodies in ever increasing number as the movement grows.\r\n\r\nAll this is not difficult to comprehend. What is more likely to perplex\r\nthe average man is the method by which Socialists propose to effect the\r\ntransfer of individual or corporate property to the collectivity. Will\r\nit be confiscated, taken without recompense; and if so, will it not be\r\nnecessary to take the bank savings of the poor widow as well as the\r\nmillions of the millionaire? On the other hand, if compensation is\r\ngiven, will there not be still a privileged class, a wealthy class, that\r\nis, and a poorer class? These are the questions I see written upon your\r\nfaces as I look down upon them and read the language of their strained\r\ninterest. Every face seems a challenge to answer these questions. I\r\nshall try to answer them with perfect candor, as far as that is possible\r\nwithin the limits of our time. May I not ask you, then, to follow\r\ncarefully a brief series of propositions, or postulates, which I shall,\r\nwith your permission, lay before you?\r\n\r\n_First:_ The act of transfer, whether it take the form of confiscation\r\nor otherwise, must be the will of a legal majority of the people. If the\r\nunit is the city, a legal majority of the citizens there; if the unit is\r\nthe state, then a legal majority of the citizens of the state; if the\r\nunit is the nation, then a legal majority in the nation. I use the term\r\n\"legal majority\" to indicate my profound conviction that the process\r\nitself must be a legal, constitutional process. Of course, in the event\r\nof some great upheaval occurring, such as, for example, the rising of a\r\nsuffering and desperate people in consequence of some terrific panic or\r\nperiod of depression, brought on by capitalist misrule, or by war, this\r\nmight be swept away. Throughout the world's history such upheavals have\r\noccurred, when the people's wrath, or their desperation, has assumed the\r\nform of a cyclone, and in such times laws have been of no more\r\nresistance than straws in the pathway of the cyclone sweeping across the\r\nplain. Omitting such dire happenings from our calculations--for so we\r\nmust wish to do--we may lay down this principle of the imperative\r\nnecessity for a legal majority, acting in legal manner.\r\n\r\n_Second:_ The process must be gradual. There will be no _coup de force_.\r\nNo effort will be made to socialize those industries which have not been\r\nmade ready by a degree of monopolization. This we can say with\r\nconfidence, if for no other reason than that we cannot conceive a legal\r\nmajority being stirred sufficiently to take action in the absence of\r\nsome degree of oppression or danger, such as monopoly alone contains.\r\nFurther, as a matter of hard, practical sense, it is not conceivable\r\nthat any government will ever be able to deal with all the industries\r\nat one time. The railroads may be first to be taken, or it may be the\r\nmines in one state and the oil wells in another. The important point is\r\nto see that the process of socialization _must_ be piecemeal and\r\ngradual. This does not mean that it must be a _slow_ process, suggesting\r\nthe slowness of geologic formations, but that it must be gradual,\r\nprogressive, advancing from step to step, and giving opportunities for\r\nadjusting things. Otherwise there would be chaos and anarchy.\r\n\r\n_Third:_ The manner of the acquisition must be determined by the people\r\nat the time, and not fixed by us in advance, according to some abstract\r\nprinciple. If the people decide to take any particular individual or\r\ncorporate property without compensation, that will be done. And they\r\nwill have great historic precedents for their action. The Socialists of\r\nEurope could point to the manner in which many of the feudal estates and\r\nrights were confiscated, while American Socialists could point to the\r\nmanner in which, without indemnity or compensation, chattel slavery was\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\nSo much is said merely by way of explanation, first, that the manner of\r\nacquiring private and corporate property and making it social property\r\nis not to be decided in advance, and secondly, that there are historic\r\nprecedents for confiscation. On the other hand, there is no good reason\r\nwhy compensation should not be paid for such properties. You start! You\r\nhave been more shocked than if I had said we should seize the properties\r\nand cut the throats of the proprietors! Be assured: I am not forgetting\r\nmy promise to be frank with you, nor am I expressing my personal opinion\r\nmerely when I say that there is nothing in the theory of modern\r\nSocialism which precludes the possibility of compensation. There is no\r\nSocialist of repute and authority in the world, so far as my knowledge\r\ngoes, who makes a contrary claim. I should regard it as unworthy to lay\r\ndown as the Socialist position views which were my own, and which were\r\nnot shared by the great body of Socialist thinkers throughout the world.\r\nIt is not less nor more than the truth that all the leading Socialists\r\nof the world agree that compensation could be paid without doing\r\nviolence to a single Socialist principle, and most of them favor\r\nit.[200]\r\n\r\nOnce more I shall appeal to the authority of Marx. Engels wrote in 1894:\r\n\"We do not at all consider the indemnification of the proprietors as an\r\nimpossibility, whatever may be the circumstances. How many times has not\r\nKarl Marx expressed to me the opinion that if we could buy up the whole\r\ncrowd it would really be the cheapest way of relieving ourselves of\r\nthem.\"[201] Not only Marx, then, in the most intimate of his discussions\r\nwith Engels, his bosom friend, but Engels himself, in almost his last\r\ndays, refused to admit the impossibility of paying indemnity for\r\nproperties socialized, \"_whatever may be the circumstances_.\"\r\n\r\nNow, as to the difficulties--especially as to the widow's savings. The\r\nsocialization of non-productive wealth is not contemplated by any\r\nSocialist, no matter whether it consist of the widow's savings in a\r\nstocking or the treasures in the safe deposit vaults of the rich. Mere\r\nwealth, whether in money or precious gems and jewels, need not trouble\r\nus. Non-productive wealth is outside of our calculation. In the next\r\nplace, as I have attempted to make clear, the petty business, the\r\nindividual store, the small workshop, and the farm operated by its\r\nowner, would not, necessarily, nor probably, be disturbed. We have to\r\nconsider only the great agencies of exploitation, industries operated by\r\nmany producers of surplus-value for the benefit of the few. Let us, for\r\nexample, take a conspicuous industrial organization, the so-called Steel\r\nTrust. Suppose the Socialists to be in power: there is a popular demand\r\nfor the socialization of the steel industry. The government decides to\r\ntake over the plant of the Steel Trust and all its affairs, and the\r\nsupport of the vast majority of the people is assured. First a\r\nvaluation takes place, and then bonds, government bonds, are issued.\r\nUnlike what happens too often at the present time, the price fixed is\r\nnot greatly in excess of the value the people acquire--one of the means\r\nby which the capitalists fasten their clutches on the popular throat.\r\nThe Socialist _spirit_ enters into the business. Bonds are issued to all\r\nthe shareholders in strict proportion to their holdings, and so the poor\r\nwidow, concerning whose interests critics of Socialism are so\r\nsolicitous, gets bonds for her share. She is therefore even more secure\r\nthan before, since it is no longer possible for unscrupulous individuals\r\nto plunder her by nefarious stock transactions.\r\n\r\nSo far, good and well. But, you may rightly say, this will not eliminate\r\nthe unearned incomes. The heavy stockholders will simply become rich\r\nbondholders. Temporarily, that is true. But when that has been\r\naccomplished in a few of the more important industries, they will find\r\nit difficult to invest their surplus incomes profitably. There will also\r\nbe a surplus to the state over and above the amounts annually paid in\r\nredemption of the bonds. Finally, it will be possible to adopt measures\r\nfor eliminating the unearned incomes entirely by means of taxation, such\r\nas the progressive income tax, property and inheritance taxes. Taxation\r\nis, of course, a form of confiscation, but it is a form which has\r\nbecome familiar, which is perfectly legal, and which enables the\r\nconfiscatory process to be stretched out over a long enough period to\r\nmake it comparatively easy, to reduce the hardship to a minimum. By\r\nmeans of a progressive income tax, a bond tax, and an inheritance tax,\r\nit would be possible to eliminate the unearned incomes of a class of\r\nbondholders from society within a reasonable period, without inflicting\r\ninjury or hardship upon any human being.\r\n\r\nI do not, let me again warn you, set this plan before you as one which\r\nSocialism depends upon, which must be adopted. I do not say that the\r\nSocialist parties of the world are pledged to this method, for they are\r\nnot. The subject is not mentioned in any of our programmes, so far as I\r\nrecall them at this moment. We are silent upon the subject, not because\r\nwe fear to discuss it, but because we realize that the matter will be\r\ndecided when the question is reached, and that each case will be decided\r\nupon its merits. Still, it is but fair to express my belief that it is\r\nto the interest of the workers, no less than of the rest of society,\r\nthat the change to a Socialist state be made as easy and peaceable as\r\npossible. Socialists, being human beings and not monsters, naturally\r\ndesire that the transition to Socialism shall be made with as little\r\nfriction and pain as possible. Left to their own choice, I am confident\r\nthat those upon whom the task of effecting the change falls will not\r\nchoose the way of violence, if the way of peace is left open to them.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of this opportunity, I have tried to be as frank as I\r\nam to myself in those constant self-questionings which are inseparable\r\nfrom the work of the serious propagandist and honest teacher. Further I\r\ncannot go. If I have not been able to tell definitely how the change\r\n_will_ be wrought, I have at least been able, I hope, to show that it\r\n_may_ be brought about peaceably and without bloodshed. If this has\r\ngiven any one a new view of Socialism--opened, as it were, a doorway\r\nthrough which you can get a glimpse of the City Beautiful, and the way\r\nleading to its gates--then my reward is infinitely precious.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[197] From the stenographic report of an address given to some students\r\nof Socialism in New York, October, 1907.\r\n\r\n[198] Cf.
