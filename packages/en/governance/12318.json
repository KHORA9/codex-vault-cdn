RICHARDSON\r\n\r\nA Representative from the State of Tennessee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME VIII\r\n\r\n1897\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrefatory Note\r\n\r\nThis volume comprises the Garfield-Arthur term of four years and the\r\nfirst term of Cleveland. The period covered is from March 4, 1881, to\r\nMarch 4, 1889. The death of President Garfield at the hand of an\r\nassassin early in his Administration created a vacancy in the office of\r\nthe Chief Executive, and for the fourth time in our history the\r\nVice-President succeeded to that office. The intense excitement\r\nthroughout the land brought about by the tragic death of the President,\r\nand the succession of the Vice-President, caused no dangerous strain\r\nupon our institutions, and once more proof was given, if, indeed,\r\nfurther evidence was required, that our Government was strong enough to\r\nquietly and peacefully endure a sudden change of rulers and of\r\nadministration, no matter how distressing and odious the cause.\r\n\r\nDuring the Administration of President Arthur a treaty between the\r\nUnited States and the Republic of Nicaragua was signed, providing for an\r\ninteroceanic canal across the territory of that State. An able and\r\nlearned discussion of this proposition will be found among his papers.\r\nThis treaty was pending when he retired from office, and was promptly\r\nwithdrawn by President Cleveland. The act to regulate and improve the\r\ncivil service of the United States was approved by President Arthur, and\r\nhe put into operation rules and regulations wide in their scope and\r\nfar-reaching for the enforcement of the measure. In his papers will be\r\nfound frequent and interesting discussions of this question. His vetoes\r\nof \"An act to execute certain treaty stipulations relating to Chinese\"\r\nand of \"An act making appropriations for the construction, repair, and\r\npreservation of certain works on rivers and harbors, and for other\r\npurposes,\" are interesting and effective papers.\r\n\r\nThe latter half of the period comprised in this volume, as already\r\nstated, covers the Administration of Cleveland. His accession to the\r\nPresidency marked the return of the Democratic party to power. No\r\nDemocrat who had been chosen by his party had held the office since the\r\nretirement of Buchanan, in 1861. President Cleveland's papers fill 558\r\npages of this volume, occupying more space than any other Chief\r\nMagistrate, Andrew Johnson being next with 457 pages. At an early date\r\nafter Mr. Cleveland's inauguration he became involved in an important\r\nand rather acrimonious discussion with the Senate on the subject of\r\nsuspensions from office. The Senate demanded of him and of the heads of\r\nsome of the Executive Departments the reasons for the suspension of\r\ncertain officials and the papers and correspondence incident thereto. In\r\nan exhaustive and interesting paper he declined to comply with the\r\ndemand. His annual message of December, 1887, was devoted exclusively to\r\na discussion of the tariff. It is conceded by all to be an able\r\ndocument, and is the only instance where a President in his annual\r\nmessage made reference to only one question. His vetoes are more\r\nnumerous than those of any other Chief Executive, amounting within the\r\nfour years to over three hundred, or more than twice the number in the\r\naggregate of all his predecessors. These vetoes relate to almost all\r\nsubjects of legislation, but mainly to pension cases and bills providing\r\nfor the erection of public buildings throughout the country.\r\n\r\nJames D. Richardson.\r\n\r\nJuly 4, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames A. Garfield\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1881, to September 19, 1881\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames A. Garfield\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Abram Garfield was born in Orange, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, November\r\n19, 1831. His father, Abram Garfield, was a native of New York, but of\r\nMassachusetts ancestry; descended from Edward Garfield, an English\r\nPuritan, who in 1630 was one of the founders of Watertown. His mother,\r\nEliza Ballou, was born in New Hampshire, of a Huguenot family that fled\r\nfrom France to New England after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes\r\nin 1685. Garfield, therefore, was from lineage well represented in the\r\nstruggles for civil and religious liberty, both in the Old and in the\r\nNew World. His father moved to Ohio in 1830 and settled in what was then\r\nknown as the \"Wilderness,\" now as the \"Western Reserve,\" which was\r\noccupied by Connecticut people. He died at the age of 33, leaving a\r\nwidow and four small children, of whom James was the youngest. Mrs.\r\nGarfield brought up her family unaided, and impressed upon them a high\r\nstandard of moral and intellectual worth. James attended school in a log\r\nhut at the age of 3 years, learned to read, and began that habit of\r\nomnivorous reading which ended only with his life. At 10 years of age\r\nwas accustomed to manual labor, helping out his mother's meager income\r\nby work at home or on the farms of the neighbors. Attended the district\r\nschool in the winter months, made good progress, and was conspicuous for\r\nhis assiduity. At the age of 14 had a fair knowledge of arithmetic and\r\ngrammar, and was particularly apt in the facts of American history. His\r\nimagination was especially kindled by tales of the sea, and he so far\r\nyielded to his love of adventure that in 1848 he went to Cleveland and\r\nproposed to ship as a sailor on board a lake schooner. Seeing that this\r\nlife was not the romance he had conceived, he turned promptly from the\r\nlake; but loath to return home without adventure and without money, he\r\ndrove some months for a boat on the Ohio Canal, when he was promoted\r\nfrom the towpath to the boat. Attended the Geauga Seminary at Chester,\r\nOhio, during the winter of 1849-50. In the vacations learned and\r\npracticed the trade of a carpenter, helped at harvest, taught--did\r\nanything and everything to earn money to pay for his schooling. After\r\nthe first term he asked and needed no aid from home; he had reached the\r\npoint where he could support himself. Was converted under the\r\ninstructions of a Christian preacher, was baptized and received into\r\nthat denomination. As soon as he finished his studies in Chester entered\r\n(1851) the Hiram Eclectic Institute (now Hiram College), at Hiram,\r\nPortage County, Ohio, the principal educational institution of his\r\nchurch. He was not very quick of acquisition, but his perseverance was\r\nindomitable and he soon had an excellent knowledge of Latin and a fair\r\nacquaintance with algebra, natural philosophy, and botany. His\r\nsuperiority was easily recognized in the prayer meetings and debating\r\nsocieties of the college, where he was assiduous and conspicuous. Living\r\nhere was inexpensive, and he readily made his expenses by teaching in\r\nthe English departments, and also gave instruction in the ancient\r\nlanguages. Entered Williams College in the autumn of 1854, and graduated\r\nwith the highest honors in the class of 1856. Returned to Ohio and\r\nresumed his place as a teacher of Latin and Greek at Hiram Institute,\r\nand the next year, being then only 26 years of age, was made its\r\npresident. The regulations and practices of his church, known as the\r\nChristian Church, or Church of the Disciples, permitted him to preach,\r\nand he used the permission. He also pursued the study of law, entering\r\nhis name in 1858 as a student in a law office in Cleveland, but studying\r\nin Hiram. Cast his first vote in 1856 for John C. Fremont, the first\r\nRepublican candidate for the Presidency. Married Lucretia Rudolph\r\nNovember 11, 1858. In 1859 was chosen to represent the counties of\r\nSummit and Portage in the Ohio senate. In August, 1861, Governor William\r\nDennison commissioned him lieutenant-colonel in the Forty-second\r\nRegiment Ohio Volunteers. Was promoted to the command of this regiment.\r\nIn December, 1861, reported to General Buell in Louisville, Ky. Was\r\ngiven a brigade and assigned the difficult task of driving the\r\nConfederate general Humphrey Marshall from eastern Kentucky. General\r\nGarfield triumphed over the Confederate forces at the battle of Middle\r\nCreek, January 10, 1862, and in recognition of his services was made a\r\nbrigadier-general by President Lincoln. During the campaign of the Big\r\nSandy, while Garfield was engaged in breaking up some scattered\r\nConfederate encampments, his supplies gave out and he was threatened\r\nwith starvation. Going himself to the Ohio River, he seized a steamer,\r\nloaded it with provisions, and on the refusal of any pilot to undertake\r\nthe perilous voyage, because of a freshet that had swelled the river, he\r\nstood at the helm for forty-eight hours and piloted the craft through\r\nthe dangerous channel. In order to surprise Marshall, then intrenched in\r\nCumberland Gap, Garfield marched his soldiers 100 miles in four days\r\nthrough a blinding snowstorm. Returning to Louisville, he found that\r\nGeneral Buell was away; overtook him at Columbia, Tenn., and was\r\nassigned to the command of the Twentieth Brigade. Reached Shiloh in time\r\nto take part in the second day's fight. Was engaged in all the\r\noperations in front of Corinth, and in June, 1862, rebuilt the bridges\r\non the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, and exhibited noticeable\r\nengineering skill in repairing the fortifications of Huntsville. Was\r\ngranted leave of absence July 30, 1862, on account of ill health, and\r\nreturned to Hiram, Ohio, where he lay ill for two months. Went to\r\nWashington on September 25, 1862, and was ordered on court-martial duty.\r\nNovember 25 was assigned to the case of General Fitz John Porter. In\r\nFebruary, 1863, returned to duty under General Rosecrans, then in\r\ncommand of the Army of the Cumberland. Rosecrans made him his chief of\r\nstaff, with responsibilities beyond those usually given to this office.\r\nIn this field Garfield's influence on the campaign in middle Tennessee\r\nwas most important. One familiar incident shows and justifies the great\r\ninfluence he wielded in its counsels. Before the battle of Chickamauga,\r\nJune 24, 1863, General Rosecrans asked the written opinion of seventeen\r\nof his generals on the advisability of an immediate advance. All others\r\nopposed, but Garfield advised it, and his arguments were so convincing\r\nthat Rosecrans determined to seek an engagement. General Garfield wrote\r\nout all the orders of that fateful day, September 19, excepting one, and\r\nthat one was the blunder that lost the day. Garfield volunteered to take\r\nthe news of the defeat on the right to General George H. Thomas, who\r\nheld the left of the line. It was a bold ride, under constant fire, but\r\nhe reached Thomas and gave the information that saved the Army of the\r\nCumberland. For this action he was made a major-general September 19,\r\n1863--promoted for gallantry on a field that was lost. Yielded to Mr.\r\nLincoln's urgent request and on December 5, 1863, resigned his commission\r\nand hastened to Washington to sit in Congress, to which he had been\r\nchosen fifteen months before. Was offered a division in the Army of the\r\nCumberland by General Thomas, but yielded to the representations of the\r\nPresident and Secretary Stanton that he would be more useful in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. Was placed on the Committee on Military\r\nAffairs, then the most important in Congress. In the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress (1865) was changed, at his own request, from the Committee on\r\nMilitary Affairs to the Committee on Ways and Means. In the Fortieth\r\nCongress (1867) was restored to the Committee on Military Affairs and\r\nmade its chairman. In the Forty-first Congress the Committee on Banking\r\nand Currency was created and he was made its chairman. Served also on\r\nthe Select Committee on the Census and on the Committee on Rules. Was\r\nchairman of the Committee on Appropriations in the Forty-second and\r\nForty-third Congresses. In the Forty-fourth, Forty-fifth, and\r\nForty-sixth Congresses (the House being Democratic) was assigned to the\r\nCommittee on Ways and Means. In 1876, at President Grant's request, went\r\nto New Orleans in company with Senators Sherman and Matthews and other\r\nRepublicans, to watch the counting of the Louisiana vote. He made a\r\nspecial study of the West Feliciana Parish case, and embodied his views\r\nin a brief but significant report. In January, 1877, made two notable\r\nspeeches in the House on the duty of Congress in a Presidential\r\nelection, and claimed that the Vice-President had a constitutional\r\nright to count the electoral vote. Opposed the Electoral Commission,\r\nyet when the commission was ordered was chosen by acclamation to fill\r\none of the two seats allotted to Republican Representatives. Mr. Blaine\r\nleft the House for the Senate in 1877, and this made Mr. Garfield the\r\nundisputed leader of his party in the House. At this time and\r\nsubsequently was its candidate for Speaker. Was elected to the United\r\nStates Senate January 13, 1880. Attended the Republican convention which\r\nmet at Chicago in June, 1880, where he opposed the renomination of\r\nPresident Grant and supported Senator Sherman. On the thirty-sixth\r\nballot the delegates broke, their ranks, and, rushing to General\r\nGarfield, he was unanimously nominated for President on June 8, 1880.\r\nWas elected November 2, 1880, receiving 214 electoral votes to 144 that\r\nwere cast for Winfield S. Hancock. Was shot July 2, 1881, by an assassin\r\nin the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad station, in Washington, and died\r\nfrom the effects of the wound September 19 at Elberon, N.J. He was\r\nburied at Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens: We stand to-day upon an eminence which overlooks a\r\nhundred years of national life--a century crowded with perils, but\r\ncrowned with the triumphs of liberty and law. Before continuing the\r\nonward march let us pause on this height for a moment to strengthen our\r\nfaith and renew our hope by a glance at the pathway along which our\r\npeople have traveled.\r\n\r\nIt is now three days more than a hundred years since the adoption of the\r\nfirst written constitution of the United States--the Articles of\r\nConfederation and Perpetual Union. The new Republic was then beset with\r\ndanger on every hand. It had not conquered a place in the family of\r\nnations. The decisive battle of the war for independence, whose\r\ncentennial anniversary will soon be gratefully celebrated at Yorktown,\r\nhad not yet been fought. The colonists were struggling not only against\r\nthe armies of a great nation, but against the settled opinions of\r\nmankind; for the world did not then believe that the supreme authority\r\nof government could be safely intrusted to the guardianship of the\r\npeople themselves.\r\n\r\nWe can not overestimate the fervent love of liberty, the intelligent\r\ncourage, and the sum of common sense with which our fathers made the\r\ngreat experiment of self-government. When they found, after a short\r\ntrial, that the confederacy of States was too weak to meet the\r\nnecessities of a vigorous and expanding republic, they boldly set it\r\naside, and in its stead established a National Union, founded directly\r\nupon the will of the people, endowed with full power of\r\nself-preservation and ample authority for the accomplishment of its\r\ngreat object.\r\n\r\nUnder this Constitution the boundaries of freedom have been enlarged,\r\nthe foundations of order and peace have been strengthened, and the\r\ngrowth of our people in all the better elements of national life has\r\nindicated the wisdom of the founders and given new hope to their\r\ndescendants. Under this Constitution our people long ago made themselves\r\nsafe against danger from without and secured for their mariners and flag\r\nequality of rights on all the seas. Under this Constitution twenty-five\r\nStates have been added to the Union, with constitutions and laws, framed\r\nand enforced by their own citizens, to secure the manifold blessings of\r\nlocal self-government.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of this Constitution now covers an area fifty times\r\ngreater than that of the original thirteen States and a population\r\ntwenty times greater than that of 1780.\r\n\r\nThe supreme trial of the Constitution came at last under the tremendous\r\npressure of civil war. We ourselves are witnesses that the Union emerged\r\nfrom the blood and fire of that conflict purified and made stronger for\r\nall the beneficent purposes of good government.\r\n\r\nAnd now, at the close of this first century of growth, with the\r\ninspirations of its history in their hearts, our people have lately\r\nreviewed the condition of the nation, passed judgment upon the conduct\r\nand opinions of political parties, and have registered their will\r\nconcerning the future administration of the Government. To interpret and\r\nto execute that will in accordance with the Constitution is the\r\nparamount duty of the Executive.\r\n\r\nEven from this brief review it is manifest that the nation is resolutely\r\nfacing to the front, resolved to employ its best energies in developing\r\nthe great possibilities of the future. Sacredly preserving whatever has\r\nbeen gained to liberty and good government during the century, our\r\npeople are determined to leave behind them all those bitter\r\ncontroversies concerning things which have been irrevocably settled, and\r\nthe further discussion of which can only stir up strife and delay the\r\nonward march.\r\n\r\nThe supremacy of the nation and its laws should be no longer a subject\r\nof debate. That discussion, which for half a century threatened the\r\nexistence of the Union, was closed at last in the high court of war by a\r\ndecree from which there is no appeal--that the Constitution and the laws\r\nmade in pursuance thereof are and shall continue to be the supreme law\r\nof the land, binding alike upon the States and the people. This decree\r\ndoes not disturb the autonomy of the States nor interfere with any of\r\ntheir necessary rights of local self-government, but it does fix and\r\nestablish the permanent supremacy of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe will of the nation, speaking with the voice of battle and through\r\nthe amended Constitution, has fulfilled the great promise of 1776 by\r\nproclaiming \"liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the negro race from slavery to the full rights of\r\ncitizenship is the most important political change we have known since\r\nthe adoption of the Constitution of 1787. No thoughtful man can fail to\r\nappreciate its beneficent effect upon our institutions and people. It\r\nhas freed us from the perpetual danger of war and dissolution. It has\r\nadded immensely to the moral and industrial forces of our people. It has\r\nliberated the master as well as the slave from a relation which wronged\r\nand enfeebled both. It has surrendered to their own guardianship the\r\nmanhood of more than 5,000,000 people, and has opened to each one of\r\nthem a career of freedom and usefulness. It has given new inspiration to\r\nthe power of self-help in both races by making labor more honorable to\r\nthe one and more necessary to the other. The influence of this force\r\nwill grow greater and bear richer fruit with the coming years.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this great change has caused serious disturbance to our\r\nSouthern communities. This is to be deplored, though it was perhaps\r\nunavoidable. But those who resisted the change should remember that\r\nunder our institutions there was no middle ground for the negro race\r\nbetween slavery and equal citizenship. There can be no permanent\r\ndisfranchised peasantry in the United States. Freedom can never yield\r\nits fullness of blessings so long as the law or its administration\r\nplaces the smallest obstacle in the pathway of any virtuous citizen.\r\n\r\nThe emancipated race has already made remarkable progress. With\r\nunquestioning devotion to the Union, with a patience and gentleness not\r\nborn of fear, they have \"followed the light as God gave them to see the\r\nlight.\" They are rapidly laying the material foundations of\r\nself-support, widening their circle of intelligence, and beginning to\r\nenjoy the blessings that gather around the homes of the industrious\r\npoor. They deserve the generous encouragement of all good men. So far as\r\nmy authority can lawfully extend, they shall enjoy the full and equal\r\nprotection of the Constitution and the laws.\r\n\r\nThe free enjoyment of equal suffrage is still in question, and a frank\r\nstatement of the issue may aid its solution. It is alleged that in many\r\ncommunities negro citizens are practically denied the freedom of the\r\nballot. In so far as the truth of this allegation is admitted, it is\r\nanswered that in many places honest local government is impossible if\r\nthe mass of uneducated negroes are allowed to vote. These are grave\r\nallegations. So far as the latter is true, it is the only palliation\r\nthat can be offered for opposing the freedom of the ballot. Bad local\r\ngovernment is certainly a great evil, which ought to be prevented; but\r\nto violate the freedom and sanctities of the suffrage is more than an\r\nevil. It is a crime which, if persisted in, will destroy the Government\r\nitself. Suicide is not a remedy. If in other lands it be high treason to\r\ncompass the death of the king, it shall be counted no less a crime here\r\nto strangle our sovereign power and stifle its voice.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that unsettled questions have no pity for the repose\r\nof nations. It should be said with the utmost emphasis that this\r\nquestion of the suffrage will never give repose or safety to the States\r\nor to the nation until each, within its own jurisdiction, makes and\r\nkeeps the ballot free and pure by the strong sanctions of the law.\r\n\r\nBut the danger which arises from ignorance in the voter can not be\r\ndenied. It covers a field far wider than that of negro suffrage and the\r\npresent condition of the race. It is a danger that lurks and hides in\r\nthe sources and fountains of power in every state. We have no standard\r\nby which to measure the disaster that may be brought upon us by\r\nignorance and vice in the citizens when joined to corruption and fraud\r\nin the suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe voters of the Union, who make and unmake constitutions, and upon\r\nwhose will hang the destinies of our governments, can transmit their\r\nsupreme authority to no successors save the coming generation of voters,\r\nwho are the sole heirs of sovereign power. If that generation comes to\r\nits inheritance blinded by ignorance and corrupted by vice, the fall of\r\nthe Republic will be certain and remediless.\r\n\r\nThe census has already sounded the alarm in the appalling figures which\r\nmark how dangerously high the tide of illiteracy has risen among our\r\nvoters and their children.\r\n\r\nTo the South this question is of supreme importance. But the\r\nresponsibility for the existence of slavery did not rest upon the South\r\nalone. The nation itself is responsible for the extension of the\r\nsuffrage, and is under special obligations to aid in removing the\r\nilliteracy which it has added to the voting population. For the North\r\nand South alike there is but one remedy. All the constitutional power of\r\nthe nation and of the States and all the volunteer forces of the people\r\nshould be surrendered to meet this danger by the savory influence of\r\nuniversal education.\r\n\r\nIt is the high privilege and sacred duty of those now living to educate\r\ntheir successors and fit them, by intelligence and virtue, for the\r\ninheritance which awaits them.\r\n\r\nIn this beneficent work sections and races should be forgotten and\r\npartisanship should be unknown. Let our people find a new meaning in the\r\ndivine oracle which declares that \"a little child shall lead them,\" for\r\nour own little children will soon control the destinies of the Republic.\r\n\r\nMy countrymen, we do not now differ in our judgment concerning the\r\ncontroversies of past generations, and fifty years hence our children\r\nwill not be divided in their opinions concerning our controversies. They\r\nwill surely bless their fathers and their fathers' God that the Union\r\nwas preserved, that slavery was overthrown, and that both races were\r\nmade equal before the law. We may hasten or we may retard, but we can\r\nnot prevent, the final reconciliation. Is it not possible for us now to\r\nmake a truce with time by anticipating and accepting its inevitable\r\nverdict?\r\n\r\nEnterprises of the highest importance to our moral and material\r\nwell-being unite us and offer ample employment of our best powers. Let\r\nall our people, leaving behind them the battlefields of dead issues,\r\nmove forward and in their strength of liberty and the restored Union win\r\nthe grander victories of peace.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity which now prevails is without parallel in our history.\r\nFruitful seasons have done much to secure it, but they have not done\r\nall. The preservation of the public credit and the resumption of specie\r\npayments, so successfully attained by the Administration of my\r\npredecessors, have enabled our people to secure the blessings which the\r\nseasons brought.\r\n\r\nBy the experience of commercial nations in all ages it has been found\r\nthat gold and silver afford the only safe foundation for a monetary\r\nsystem. Confusion has recently been created by variations in the\r\nrelative value of the two metals, but I confidently believe that\r\narrangements can be made between the leading commercial nations which\r\nwill secure the general use of both metals. Congress should provide that\r\nthe compulsory coinage of silver now required by law may not disturb our\r\nmonetary system by driving either metal out of circulation. If possible,\r\nsuch an adjustment should be made that the purchasing power of every\r\ncoined dollar will be exactly equal to its debt-paying power in all the\r\nmarkets of the world.\r\n\r\nThe chief duty of the National Government in connection with the\r\ncurrency of the country is to coin money and declare its value. Grave\r\ndoubts have been entertained whether Congress is authorized by the\r\nConstitution to make any form of paper money legal tender. The present\r\nissue of United States notes has been sustained by the necessities of\r\nwar; but such paper should depend for its value and currency upon its\r\nconvenience in use and its prompt redemption in coin at the will of the\r\nholder, and not upon its compulsory circulation. These notes are not\r\nmoney, but promises to pay money. If the holders demand it, the promise\r\nshould be kept.\r\n\r\nThe refunding of the national debt at a lower rate of interest should be\r\naccomplished without compelling the withdrawal of the national-bank\r\nnotes, and thus disturbing the business of the country.\r\n\r\nI venture to refer to the position I have occupied on financial\r\nquestions during a long service in Congress, and to say that time and\r\nexperience have strengthened the opinions I have so often expressed on\r\nthese subjects.\r\n\r\nThe finances of the Government shall suffer no detriment which it may be\r\npossible for my Administration to prevent.\r\n\r\nThe interests of agriculture deserve more attention from the Government\r\nthan they have yet received. The farms of the United States afford homes\r\nand employment for more than one-half our people, and furnish much the\r\nlargest part of all our exports. As the Government lights our coasts for\r\nthe protection of mariners and the benefit of commerce, so it should\r\ngive to the tillers of the soil the best lights of practical science and\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nOur manufactures are rapidly making us industrially independent, and are\r\nopening to capital and labor new and profitable fields of employment.\r\nTheir steady and healthy growth should still be matured. Our facilities\r\nfor transportation should be promoted by the continued improvement of\r\nour harbors and great interior waterways and by the increase of our\r\ntonnage on the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe development of the world's commerce has led to an urgent demand for\r\nshortening the great sea voyage around Cape Horn by constructing ship\r\ncanals or railways across the isthmus which unites the continents.\r\nVarious plans to this end have been suggested and will need\r\nconsideration, but none of them has been sufficiently matured to warrant\r\nthe United States in extending pecuniary aid. The subject, however, is\r\none which will immediately engage the attention of the Government with a\r\nview to a thorough protection to American interests. We will urge no\r\nnarrow policy nor seek peculiar or exclusive privileges in any\r\ncommercial route; but, in the language of my predecessor, I believe it\r\nto be the right \"and duty of the United States to assert and maintain\r\nsuch supervision and authority over any interoceanic canal across the\r\nisthmus that connects North and South America as will protect our\r\nnational interest.\"\r\n\r\nThe Constitution guarantees absolute religious freedom. Congress is\r\nprohibited from making any law respecting an establishment of religion\r\nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The Territories of the United\r\nStates are subject to the direct legislative authority of Congress, and\r\nhence the General Government is responsible for any violation of the\r\nConstitution in any of them. It is therefore a reproach to the\r\nGovernment that in the most populous of the Territories the\r\nconstitutional guaranty is not enjoyed by the people and the authority\r\nof Congress is set at naught. The Mormon Church not only offends the\r\nmoral sense of manhood by sanctioning polygamy, but prevents the\r\nadministration of justice through ordinary instrumentalities of law.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment it is the duty of Congress, while respecting to the\r\nuttermost the conscientious convictions and religious scruples of every\r\ncitizen, to prohibit within its jurisdiction all criminal practices,\r\nespecially of that class which destroy the family relations and endanger\r\nsocial order. Nor can any ecclesiastical organization be safely\r\npermitted to usurp in the smallest degree the functions and powers of\r\nthe National Government.\r\n\r\nThe civil service can never be placed on a satisfactory basis until it\r\nis regulated by law. For the good of the service itself, for the\r\nprotection of those who are intrusted with the appointing power against\r\nthe waste of time and obstruction to the public business caused by the\r\ninordinate pressure for place, and for the protection of incumbents\r\nagainst intrigue and wrong, I shall at the proper time ask Congress to\r\nfix the tenure of the minor offices of the several Executive Departments\r\nand prescribe the grounds upon which removals shall be made during the\r\nterms for which incumbents have been appointed.\r\n\r\nFinally, acting always within the authority and limitations of the\r\nConstitution, invading neither the rights of the States nor the reserved\r\nrights of the people, it will be the purpose of my Administration to\r\nmaintain the authority of the nation in all places within its\r\njurisdiction; to enforce obedience to all the laws of the Union in the\r\ninterests of the people; to demand rigid economy in all the expenditures\r\nof the Government, and to require the honest and faithful service of all\r\nexecutive officers, remembering that the offices were created, not for\r\nthe benefit of incumbents or their supporters, but for the service of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nAnd now, fellow-citizens, I am about to assume the great trust which you\r\nhave committed to my hands. I appeal to you for that earnest and\r\nthoughtful support which makes this Government in fact, as it is in law,\r\na government of the people.\r\n\r\nI shall greatly rely upon the wisdom and patriotism of Congress and of\r\nthose who may share with me the responsibilities and duties of\r\nadministration, and, above all, upon our efforts to promote the welfare\r\nof this great people and their Government I reverently invoke the\r\nsupport and blessings of Almighty God.\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nExecutive Mansion,\r\n_Washington, April 6, 1881.\r\nTo the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith in response to the resolution of the Senate of the\r\n18th ultimo, a report of the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\npapers, in relation to the capitulations of the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nJAMES A.

The\r\nPresident had just reached the Baltimore and Potomac station, at about\r\n9.20, intending, with a portion of his Cabinet, to leave on the limited\r\nexpress for New York. I rode in the carriage with him from the Executive\r\nMansion and was walking by his side when he was shot. The assassin was\r\nimmediately arrested, and the President was conveyed to a private room\r\nin the station building and surgical aid at once summoned. He has now,\r\nat 10.20, been removed to the Executive Mansion. The surgeons, on\r\nconsultation, regard his wounds as very serious, though not necessarily\r\nfatal. His vigorous health gives strong hopes of his recovery. He has\r\nnot lost consciousness for a moment. Inform our ministers in Europe.\r\n\r\nJAMES G.

NICHOLS,\r\n_Acting Secretary of the Navy._\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Medical Record, New York, 1881, vol. 20, p. 364.]\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL BULLETIN OF THE AUTOPSY ON THE BODY OF PRESIDENT GARFIELD.\r\n\r\nThe following official bulletin was prepared by the surgeons who have\r\nbeen in attendance upon the late President:\r\n\r\nBy previous Arrangement a _post-mortem_ examination of the body of\r\nPresident Garfield was made this afternoon in the presence and with the\r\nassistance of Drs. Hamilton, Agnew, Bliss, Barnes, Woodward, Reyburn,\r\nAndrew H. Smith, of Elberon, and Acting Assistant Surgeon D.S. Lamb, of\r\nthe Army Medical Museum, of Washington. The operation was performed by\r\nDr. Lamb. It was found that the ball, after fracturing the right\r\neleventh rib, had passed through the spinal column in front of the\r\nspinal cord, fracturing the body of the first lumbar vertebra, driving a\r\nnumber of small fragments of bone into the adjacent soft parts, and\r\nlodging below the pancreas, about 2-1/2 inches to the left of the spine\r\nand behind the peritoneum, where it had become completely encysted.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of death was secondary hemorrhage from one of the\r\nmesenteric arteries adjoining the track of the ball, the blood rupturing\r\nthe peritoneum and nearly a pint escaping into the abdominal cavity.\r\nThis hemorrhage is believed to have been the cause of the severe pain in\r\nthe lower part of the chest complained of just before death. An abscess\r\ncavity 6 inches by 4 in dimensions was found in the vicinity of the gall\r\nbladder, between the liver and the transverse colon, which were strongly\r\nadherent. It did not involve the substance of the liver, and no\r\ncommunication was found between it and the wound.\r\n\r\nA long suppurating channel extended from the external wound, between the\r\nloin muscles and the right kidney, almost to the right groin. This\r\nchannel, now known to be due to the burrowing of pus from the wound, was\r\nsupposed during life to have been the track of the ball.\r\n\r\nOn an examination of the organs of the chest evidences of severe\r\nbronchitis were found on both sides, with broncho-pneumonia of the lower\r\nportions of the right lung, and, though to a much less extent, of the\r\nleft. The lungs contained no abscesses and the heart no clots. The liver\r\nwas enlarged and fatty, but not from abscesses. Nor were any found in\r\nany other organ except the left kidney, which contained near its surface\r\na small abscess about one-third of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the history of the case in connection with the autopsy it\r\nis quite evident that the different suppurating surfaces, and especially\r\nthe fractured, spongy tissue of the vertebrae, furnish a sufficient\r\nexplanation of the septic condition which existed.\r\n\r\nD.W.

LAMB.\r\n\r\n\r\n[September 20, 1881.]\r\n\r\nFORMAL OATH OF OFFICE ADMINISTERED TO PRESIDENT ARTHUR.\r\n\r\nPresident Chester A. Arthur took the formal oath of office as President\r\nof the United States in the room of the Vice-President, in the Capitol,\r\nThursday, September 22, 1881, at 12.10 o'clock p.m. Chief Justice\r\nMorrison R. Waite administered the oath prescribed by the Constitution\r\nin the presence of the members of the Cabinet, the Justices of the\r\nSupreme Court, ex-Presidents Grant and Hayes, General W.T. Sherman, and\r\na number of Senators and Representatives.\r\n\r\n[For Inaugural Address of President Arthur see pp. 33-34.]\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur, in his first annual message to the first session of\r\nthe Forty-seventh Congress, thus announced the death of his predecessor:\r\n\r\n    An appalling calamity has befallen the American people since their\r\n    chosen representatives last met in the halls where you are now\r\n    assembled. We might else recall with unalloyed content the rare\r\n    prosperity with which throughout the year the nation has been\r\n    blessed. Its harvests have been plenteous; its varied industries\r\n    have thriven; the health of its people has been preserved; it has\r\n    maintained with foreign governments the undisturbed relations of\r\n    amity and peace. For these manifestations of His favor we owe to Him\r\n    who holds our destiny in His hands the tribute of our grateful\r\n    devotion.\r\n\r\n    To that mysterious exercise of His will which has taken from us the\r\n    loved and illustrious citizen who was but lately the head of the\r\n    nation we bow in sorrow and submission.\r\n\r\n    The memory of his exalted character, of his noble achievements, and\r\n    of his patriotic life will be treasured forever as a sacred\r\n    possession of the whole people.\r\n\r\n    The announcement of his death drew from foreign governments and\r\n    peoples tributes of sympathy and sorrow which history will record as\r\n    signal tokens of the kinship of nations and the federation of\r\n    mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senate on December 6, 1881, adopted the following resolution:\r\n\r\n    _Resolved_, That a committee of six Senators be appointed on the\r\n    part of the Senate to join such committee as may be appointed on the\r\n    part of the House to consider and report by what token of respect\r\n    and affection it may be proper for the Congress of the United States\r\n    to express the deep sensibility of the nation to the event of the\r\n    decease of the late President, James A.
