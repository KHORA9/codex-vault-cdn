Charles\r\nRepton, Bart., M.V.O., O.M., Warden of the Court of Dowry, a man past\r\nmiddle age but in the height of industry, sat at breakfast in his\r\nhouse: a large house overlooking Hyde Park from the North, close to the\r\ncorner of the Edgware Road, and therefore removed by at least a hundred\r\nyards from the graphic representation which marks the site of the old\r\nPermanent Gallows that once stood at Tyburn.\r\n\r\nI have said that he was Warden of the Court of Dowry, and the reader,\r\nif she has any acquaintance with parliamentary affairs, will remember\r\nthat at the time of which I speak, the month of March, 1915, that post\r\ncommonly carried with it Cabinet rank. The experienced in political\r\nmatters will certainly induce that he was also in the House of\r\nCommons. He sat there for Pailton, a borough which had been the last\r\nto elect him after previous experiences in Merionethshire, Kirkby,\r\nBruton, Powkeley and the Wymp division of Dorset, in which last his\r\nsomewhat constrained and cold manner had perhaps led to his defeat.\r\n\r\nIt was not his first experience of office, but he had never stood so\r\nhigh in the Councils of the Nation, nor had his presence in the Cabinet\r\never more weighed with the young and popular Prime Minister (who was\r\nsuffering slightly from his left lung) than at this moment. For though\r\nCharles Repton did not belong by birth to the group of families from\r\nwhich the Prime Minister had sprung, he was of those who, as they\r\nadvance through life, accumulate an increasing number of clients, of\r\ndependents and of friends who dare not trifle with such friendships.\r\n\r\nIn figure he was tall and somewhat lean; he was clean-shaven; his\r\nbrilliant white hair was well groomed; his brown eyes were singularly\r\npiercing, and, in contrast with his head, two thick, very dark\r\nand strongly arched eyebrows emphasized his expression. He was by\r\npersuasion at this time of his life a Second Day Wycliffite, and had\r\nindeed professed his connection with that body since at least his\r\nfortieth year, before which period in his career he had permanently\r\nresided in a suburb of Leicester, to which in turn he had removed from\r\nNewcastle.\r\n\r\nBy profession he was, or rather had been, a solicitor, in which\r\ncalling he had ever advised those clients who had the wisdom to\r\naccumulate wealth to leave the investment of it at his discretion,\r\nnor were they disappointed in the regular receipt of a moderate but\r\nsecure income calculated at a reasonable rate; while to those who (for\r\nwhatever reason) lay under the necessity of borrowing, he was ever\r\nready to advance at a somewhat higher rate such sums as he had at his\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nBut this humdrum course of professional life could never satisfy\r\nabilities of his calibre. Shortly after his entry into political life\r\nhe had undertaken the management of numerous industrial ventures,\r\nseveral of which had proved singularly successful, while those which\r\nhad been less fortunate came to grief through the action of others than\r\nhimself: nay it was often shown when the winding-up order came that\r\nsuch risks had attracted but little of his spare cash.\r\n\r\nHe was that morning in March, 1915, eating an egg. He had before him a\r\ncopy of the _Times_, the affairs of which newspaper were among his most\r\nvalued connections. The moments he could spare from its perusal were\r\ngiven to the methodical cutting open of envelopes and the glancing at\r\ntheir contents,--an exercise which it was his rule most methodically\r\nto pursue before he permitted his secretary to deal with the answers.\r\nIndeed some one or two of these missives he put into his pocket to be\r\ndealt with at his private leisure.\r\n\r\nHe was alone, for his wife--Maria, Lady Repton--would commonly affect\r\nto come down after he had left the house; and this, no matter how late\r\ndivisions might have kept him upon the previous evening, he invariably\r\ndid at the hour of half-past nine. I may add that he had no children,\r\nbut could boast no less than five horses in town and sixteen in the\r\ncountry, all his own property, and used to drag in the country I know\r\nnot how many vehicles; in London three, each suitable for its own\r\nfunction. Of motor cars he kept but one, but that large and in colour\r\na very bright sky-blue. As he had no proficiency in riding, he did not\r\nindulge in that exercise; but he was fond of golf and was acquainted\r\nwith all the technical terms of the game.\r\n\r\nTo do him justice he was not without means, nay, he was what many would\r\ncall wealthy, and the salary of £5000 to which, amid the enthusiastic\r\ncheers of the Legislature, the Wardenship of the Court of Dowry had\r\nrecently been raised was of no great consequence to his position.\r\n\r\nTo another, alas! in the vast and heartless city, such a salary was\r\nshortly to mean far more,--and GEORGE MULROSS DEMAINE, upon whom I\r\nwill not for the moment linger, would have been even more benefited in\r\npocket than in status by the handling of it.\r\n\r\nCareless, however, as Sir Charles Repton might be of a fringe of income\r\nobtainable only while his own Party were in office, it was imagined\r\nthat he was not a little attached to other advantages connected with\r\nhis Wardenship. It is doubtful whether a man of this firm, reticent\r\nand dominating character could really be attached to such accidents\r\nof his post as the carrying of a model ship, bareheaded, in the great\r\nprocession upon Empire Day, the wearing upon state occasions of shoes\r\nwhich curled up at the toe and were caught back to the ankles by small\r\nsilver chains, or the presence upon these ornaments of several tiny\r\nbells that jingled as he walked; anachronisms of this kind can have\r\nproduced little but discomfort in one of his stern mould when, upon\r\nthe rare occasions of court functions, he was compelled to adopt the\r\nofficial dress. But there was more!\r\n\r\nThe Wardenship of the Court of Dowry carried with it something regal in\r\nthat great world of affairs in which he moved, and bitter as had been\r\nthe attacks upon his colleagues in the Nationalist Cabinet,--especially\r\nduring the futile attempt to pass the Broadening of the Streets\r\nBill--Sir Charles had always been treated with peculiar and exceptional\r\nrespect, though he would never have used methods so underhand as to\r\nforeclose upon any newspaper with whom he might have a political\r\ndifference or to embarrass by official action any considerable\r\nadvertiser of patent medicines whose manufacture came under the purview\r\nof his Department.\r\n\r\nIt would be an exaggeration to say that he had raised one of the minor\r\nGovernment posts to the level of the Foreign Office, but, at any rate,\r\nit had under his reign become almost as prominent as it had been when\r\nGHERKIN had first raised it to the rank of a principal function in the\r\nState. It was one of the great spending departments; Repton saw to that.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Repton prepared to leave his house, I say, at half-past\r\nnine; his mind was intent upon the business of the morning, which\r\nwas a Board meeting of the Van Diemens. It need not yet concern the\r\nreader, it is enough for her to know (and the knowledge is consonant\r\nwith Repton’s character) that the Company was prepared to develop all\r\nthat North-eastern littoral of the Australian Continent for which it\r\nhad obtained a charter but which no enterprise had as yet succeeded in\r\nbringing into line with the vast energies of the Empire.\r\n\r\nOf the strategical advantages such a position can give, I need not\r\nspeak. Luckily they were in the hands of patriots.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively small sum of £4,000,000 which by its charter the\r\nCompany was permitted to raise would have been subscribed twenty times\r\nover in the rush for shares seven years before, and it is common\r\nknowledge that at a particular moment during which values must surely\r\nhave been inflated, they reached a premium of between 800 and 900 per\r\ncent. The cool process of reflection which often follows such errors\r\nhad by this time driven them if anything too low, and the original one\r\npound share which had twice all but touched £9, had been for now many\r\nmonths unsaleable at a nominal price of 16/3.\r\n\r\nThere exists a sound rule of public administration of this\r\ncountry--inaugurated, I believe, by Mr. Gladstone--which forbids a\r\nCabinet Minister to hold any public directorship at the same time as\r\nhis official post, and indeed it is this rule which renders it usual\r\nfor a couple of men upon opposite sides of the House to come to an\r\narrangement whereby the one shall be Director while his colleague is in\r\noffice, lest important commercial affairs should be neglected through\r\nthe too rigid application of what is in principle so excellent a rule.\r\nBut there had been no necessity for this arrangement in the case of so\r\ngreat an Imperial business as the Van Diemens: it touched too nearly\r\nthe major interests of the country for its connection with a Cabinet\r\nMinister to be remarkable, and all patriotic opinion was sincerely glad\r\nwhen, in the preceding January, Sir Charles Repton had consented to\r\nacquire without direct purchase a few thousand shares and to take an\r\nactive part in raising the fortunes of the scheme.\r\n\r\nIt was recognised upon all sides that the act was one of statesman-like\r\nself-sacrifice, and there were perhaps but two papers in London (two\r\nevening papers of large circulation but of no high standing) which so\r\nmuch as alluded to Sir Charles’ labours in this field.\r\n\r\nOf these one, the _Moon_, catered especially for that very\r\nconsiderable public which will have England mistress of the waves,\r\nwhich is interested in the printed results of horse-racing, which had\r\nformerly triumphantly carried at the polls the demand for protection,\r\nand which was somewhat embittered by so many years of office during\r\nwhich the Nationalist Party had done little more than tax the parts of\r\nmotor cars, foreign unsweetened prunes, moss litter, and such small\r\nquantities of foreign sulphuric acid as are used in the manufacture of\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\nThe other, the _Capon_--to give it its entire name--was of a finer\r\nstamp. All the young enthusiasts read it, and it was enormously bought\r\nfor its Notes on Gardening, its caricatures, its clever headlines, and\r\nits short, downright little leaders not twenty lines long, printed, by\r\na successful innovation, in capitals throughout, and in a red ink that\r\nshowed up finely against the plain black and white of the remainder.\r\n\r\nBoth these papers had continually and violently attacked the connection\r\nof one of our few great statesmen with the last of the vast enterprises\r\nof Empire. The _Capon_, whose editor was a young man with very wild\r\neyes and hair like a weeping willow, attacked it on principle. The\r\n_Moon_--whose proprietor was an intimate friend of Sir Charles’\r\nown--was more practical, and attacked the connection between Repton and\r\nthe Company with good old personalities worthy of a more virile age.\r\n\r\nWell then, at this hour of half-past nine on that March day of 1915,\r\nCharles Repton rose from his breakfast. He touched the crumbs upon\r\nhis waistcoat so that they fell, and those upon his trousers also. He\r\nlooked severely at the footman in the hall, who quailed a little at\r\nthat glance, he rapidly put on his coat unaided, and asked briefly to\r\nsee the butler.\r\n\r\nThe butler came.\r\n\r\n“I’m out to lunch.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sir Charles.”\r\n\r\n“Tell Parker that if one of my letters is ever left again on the table\r\nafter I have gone, I shall speak to Lady Repton.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sir Charles.”\r\n\r\n“The car is not to be used on any account.”\r\n\r\n“No, Sir Charles.”\r\n\r\nHe turned round abruptly and went down the steps and into the street,\r\nwhile one of his large footmen shut the huge door ever so gently behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of such character, who conducted his household so firmly,\r\nthat the man, though now five months in his service, dared exchange no\r\njest with the butler who went quietly off to his own part of the house\r\nagain. It was a singular proof of what rigid domestic government can do.\r\n\r\nFrom her room Maria, Lady Repton, when she was quite sure that her\r\nhusband was gone, slunk downstairs. With a cunning that was now a\r\ntrifle threadbare, she discovered from Parker the housekeeper, from the\r\nsecretary, from the butler, by methods which she fondly believed to be\r\nindirect, what plans her husband had formed for the day. She sighed\r\nto learn that she might not have the car, for she had designed to go\r\nand see her dear old friend widow, Mrs. Hulker, formerly of Newcastle,\r\nnow of Ealing, a woman of great culture and refinement and one who gave\r\nMaria, Lady Repton, nearly all her information upon books and life. Of\r\ncourse there was always the Tube and the Underground, but they greatly\r\nwearied this elderly lady, and it was too far to drive. She sighed a\r\nlittle at her husband’s order.\r\n\r\nHe, meanwhile, was out in Oxford Street, and with the rapidity that\r\ndistinguishes successful men, had decided not to take a motor-bus but\r\nto walk. The March day was cold and clear and breezy, and he went\r\neastward at a happy gait. He did not need to be at his work until close\r\nupon eleven, and even that he knew to be full early for at least one\r\ncolleague, the stupidest of all the Directors, a certain Bingham, upon\r\nwhose late rising he counted. For the intolerable tedium of arguing\r\nagainst a man who invariably took the unintelligent side was one of\r\nthe few things which caused Sir Charles to betray some slight shade of\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\nThe day pleased him, as indeed it pleased the greater part of London,\r\nfrom its fineness. He walked upon the sunny side of the street, and his\r\nsmile, though restrained and somewhat sadly dignified, was the more\r\ngenial from the influence of the weather. His brain during this brief\r\nexercise was not concerned, as those ignorant of our great men might\r\nimagine, with affairs of State, nor even with the choice of investments\r\nupon which he was in so short a time to determine. He was occupied\r\nrather in planning (for his power of organisation was famous) how\r\nexactly he should fit in his engagements for the day.\r\n\r\nA Board meeting, especially if there is any chance of long argument\r\nwith a late riser of exceptional stupidity, may last for an indefinite\r\ntime. He gave it an hour and a half.\r\n\r\nThen he must lunch, and that hour was earmarked for a certain foreigner\r\nwho could not wholly make up his mind whether to build a certain bridge\r\nover a certain river for a certain government or no.\r\n\r\nBy a quarter to three he must be in the House of Commons to answer\r\nquestions, for those which fell to his share came early upon the paper,\r\nand it was the pride of this exact and efficient man to keep no one\r\nwaiting. Before four he must see the manager of a bank; the matter\r\nwas urgent, he did not wish to write or telephone. By five he must be\r\nback again in his room in the House of Commons to receive a deputation\r\nof gentlemen who would arrive from his distant constituency, and who\r\nproposed with a mixture of insistence and of fear to demand certain\r\ncommercial advantages for their town at the expense of a neighbouring\r\nborough whose representative but rarely busied himself with the Great\r\nCouncil of the Nation.\r\n\r\nAt six he must order with particular care a dinner upon which (in his\r\nopinion) the chances of the Saltoon Development largely depended. At\r\nseven he must dress, at eight he must dine. His guests (many of whom to\r\nhis knowledge would drink to excess) would certainly detain him till\r\nlong after ten. He must be back in the House to vote at eleven; for\r\nsome half-hour or so after eleven he must be present to attend a short\r\ndebate (or what he hoped would prove a short debate) concerning his own\r\nDepartment. He would be lucky if he was in bed by twelve.\r\n\r\nLet the reader leave him there walking in Oxford Street and turn her\r\nattention to George Mulross Demaine, or rather, to Mount Popocatapetl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will generally be conceded that an underground river flowing with\r\nterrific force through a region of perennial fire, must, of its nature,\r\nform a most insecure foundation for any large body of masonry; and the\r\ndanger of building upon such a bottom will be the more apparent if the\r\nmaterials used in the construction of the edifice be insufficiently\r\ncemented through the business capacity of a contractor indifferent to\r\nthe voice of conscience.\r\n\r\nYet such were the conditions upon the flanks of Mt. Popocatapetl when,\r\nin the Autumn of 1914, it was determined to erect on such a site the\r\nPopocatapetl Dam, for the containment of the Popocatapetl reservoir and\r\nthe ultimate irrigation of El Plan.\r\n\r\nMt. Popocatapetl rises in a graceful cone to the height of 22,130\r\nfeet above the level of the sea. Its summit is crowned with eternal\r\nsnows, while round its base, in spite of numerous earthquakes,\r\nconstantly followed by the outburst of vast fountains of boiling water,\r\ncling a score of towns and villages, some with Spanish, others with\r\nunpronounceable names. To these the beneficent and lengthy rule of\r\nGen. Porfirio Diaz has lent a political security which Nature would\r\ndo well to copy,--has led the inhabitants to seek their treasure upon\r\nearth, and has bequeathed the inestimable advantage of the great\r\nPopocatapetl Dam.\r\n\r\nI say the “inestimable advantage,” for though the construction of this\r\nremarkable barrage has wholly cut off the insufficient water supply of\r\nthis region, it has brought into the neighbourhood very considerable\r\nsums of American money, an active demand for labour, and a line of\r\nrailway at the terminus of which can be purchased the most enlightened\r\nnewspapers of the New World. The simplest journalist,--should\r\nsuch a being be possessed of the means to travel in these distant\r\nregions--might also inform the residents,--should they in turn be\r\nwilling to hear him patiently,--that the irrigation of El Plan, though\r\n150 miles distant from their now desiccated homes, can not but react to\r\ntheir advantage and create a market for their wares.\r\n\r\nMysterious designs of Providence! This mountain (among the noblest\r\nof volcanic phenomena) was destined to threaten with ruin a great\r\nEnglish family, to precipitate onto the Treasury bench a young man of\r\nunassuming manners and of insufficient capacity, to shake half the\r\nfinances of the world, and to determine a peerage for a man to whom\r\nsuch ornaments were baubles!\r\n\r\nTo appreciate by what chain of circumstances Popocatapetl’s hoary head\r\nmight with its nod produce so distant a consequence, it is necessary\r\nfor the reader once again to fix her mind most firmly upon the truth\r\nthat an underground river flowing with terrific force through a region\r\nof perennial fire, must of its nature form a most insecure foundation\r\nfor any considerable body of masonry, and that the danger of building\r\nupon such a bottom will be the more apparent if the material used, etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the light of this knowledge, which (in common with the majority\r\nof rational beings) Ole Man Benson possessed, an investment in the\r\nstocks of a Company whose dividends depended upon the security of such\r\nan edifice might have seemed to those ill-acquainted with our modern\r\nCaptains of Industry, an unpardonable folly.\r\n\r\nIt is none the less true that Ole Man Benson carried a heavy load of\r\n“Popocatapetls,” naked and unashamed.\r\n\r\nHe did not positively control Popocatapetls. Heaven forbid! But apart\r\nfrom a considerable block of which he was the actual owner, no small\r\nfraction was held by the Durango Investment Company, the majority of\r\nwhose shares being the property of the Texas and Western Equalisation\r\nSyndicate, gave to Ole Man Benson in his capacity of Chief Equaliser,\r\na distant but effective control over the second lot of Popocatapetls\r\nin question; while the very large investment of which the N.N.O. and\r\nS.L. Line had made at his command of their reserve funds in the same\r\ncompany, gave him in his capacity of Chief Terroriser thereof yet a\r\nthird grip upon the venture.\r\n\r\nOne way and another Ole Man Benson stood in for Popocatapetls in\r\na manner as healthy as it was unmistakable. And strangely enough,\r\nthe fiercer the perennial fires and the louder the roaring of the\r\nsubterranean river, the more steadily did Popocatapetls rise, the more\r\nsublimely did Wall Street urge their ascension, the more vigorously\r\ndid the American investor (who was alone concerned) buy as he was told\r\nuntil, upon a certain day, a great Republican statesman of undoubted\r\nintegrity but of perhaps too high an idealism, was announced to speak\r\nupon the great national enterprise.\r\n\r\nOle Man Benson loved, trusted and revered this statesman and supported\r\nhim in every way: his name escapes me, but upon his decision the future\r\nof the undertaking would without question lie; and such was the bond\r\nbetween the two men that the politician had not hesitated to receive\r\nfrom the capitalist certain rough notes which had been jotted down in\r\nthe office for the supreme verdict which was to be delivered to the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nIt was to be delivered at Washington upon a certain Wednesday (the date\r\nis memorable) at the unconventional hour of ten, in order that a full\r\nreport of it might reach the foolish and the wise in New York City in\r\nample time for its effects to be fully felt upon the markets; and _Ole\r\nMan Benson_ had given instructions to sell not later than half-past\r\nthree of that same fateful Wednesday.\r\n\r\nBut what, you cry (if such is your habit), what of all this in\r\nconnection with the ancient houses of this land? With the Cabinet? With\r\npeerages and the rest?\r\n\r\nTut! Have you never heard how sensitive is the modern world to every\r\nbreath of commercial news, and how all the modern world is one? Well\r\nthen, I must explain:\r\n\r\nSome two years before, in London, one GEORGE MULROSS DEMAINE had lain\r\nlanguishing for lack of money.\r\n\r\nHe was of good birth, and doubtless had he possessed a secure\r\nand flowing fortune, his natural diffidence would have been less\r\npronounced, and the strange fatality by which he could hardly place his\r\nhands and feet in any position without causing some slight accident to\r\nthe furniture, would have passed unnoticed, or would have been put down\r\nto good nature. But George Mulross was wholly devoid of means.\r\n\r\nGeorge Mulross Demaine, like so many of his rank, was related to Mary\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nNow Mary Smith, her pleasing, energetic person, her lively eyes and\r\ndear soul, the reader can never fully know unless she has perused or\r\nrather learned by heart, that entrancing work, “Mr. Clutterbuck’s\r\nElection,” in which, like a good fairy, she plumps across the scene\r\nand is perceived to be the friend, the confidant, the cousin, the\r\nsister-in-law or the aunt of at least three-quarters of what counts in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nShe will not feel, I say, unless she has made that work her bible, how\r\nfrom St. James’s Place Mary Smith blessed Society with her jolly little\r\nhands, and indulged in the companionship of characters as varied as the\r\nPeabody Yid and Victoria Mosel.\r\n\r\nWhat a woman! Her little shooting-box in Scotland! Her place in the\r\nWest Country! The country house which she so rarely visited in the\r\nMidlands but which she lent in the freest manner! Her vivacity, her\r\ncharm, her go, her scraps of French--her inheritance from her late\r\nhusband, himself an American and Smith, as I need hardly say, by name!\r\n\r\nThe reader unacquainted with the Work which I refer her to, must\r\nfurther have introduced to her at the proper place the notable figure\r\nof cousin William Bailey, at what an expense of repetition upon my part\r\nI need hardly say. He also was of the gang; he also had been elected of\r\nthe people: but violent eccentricities now kept him apart from his true\r\nworld. Thus he professed a vast interest in Jews, making them out to\r\nbe the secret masters of England. How far that fanaticism was sincere,\r\nhe could not himself have told you. It diverted him hugely to discover\r\nmares’ nests of every kind; he was never happier than when he was\r\ntracking the relationship between governing families or the connection\r\nof some spotless politician with a spotted financial adventure. There\r\nwas but one excuse for his manias, that he remained, through the most\r\nardent pursuit of them, a genial cynic. We shall meet him again.\r\n\r\nMary Smith, then, was related to all of them and they were all related\r\nto each other, and in their relationship there was friendship also, and\r\nthey governed England and the taxes bore them on.\r\n\r\nThat the Leader of the Opposition should be Mary Smith’s close friend\r\ngoes without saying; much closer and dearer to her was her other\r\ncousin, the young and popular Prime Minister, to his friends Dolly, to\r\nthe world a more dignified name, who suffered slightly from his left\r\nlung. He had attained his high position before his fiftieth year was\r\nclosed. For over four years he had conducted with consummate skill the\r\nfortunes of the Nationalist Party, and was at that very moment when\r\nPopocatapetl nursed so sullenly its internal rage, piloting in distant\r\nWestminster the Broadening of the Streets Bill through an excited\r\nsession of Parliament.\r\n\r\nBut of all her relatives, near or distant, of all the friends whom she\r\ncalled by their Christian name, not the Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nnot the First Sea Lord, not the six chief members of the front\r\nOpposition bench, not the eight or nine disappointed men with corner\r\nseats, not the score or so of great financiers whom she honoured at\r\nher board,--not the Secretary of State for the Colonies (a diminished\r\npost since the Sarawatta business),--not the young and popular Prime\r\nMinister himself, who suffered slightly from the left lung,--was quite\r\nso dear to her as that sort of nephew, George Mulross Demaine.\r\n\r\nThe relationship was distant, and it was less on account of the ties of\r\nblood than by reason of the strong friendship that had always existed\r\nbetween his father and herself that Mary Smith first befriended the lad\r\nas she had already befriended so many others. For Demaine’s father,\r\nthough what the world would call a failure and even for many years\r\nseparated from his wife, had always exercised a peculiar charm over his\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nOpinion had been sharply divided upon several episodes of his life, so\r\nsharply that towards the close of it he preferred to live abroad, and\r\nGeorge’s boyhood had been passed in the most uneasy of experiences, now\r\nwith his father in Ireland, now with his mother in the neighbourhood of\r\nConstantinople, and occasionally under the roof of Mary Smith during\r\nher short married life.\r\n\r\nShe had grown to do for him what she would not do for another--for\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald for instance,--for he was not a scatterbrain nor\r\none to get rid of money with nothing to show for it. He was simply a\r\nquiet, unostentatious English lad, a little awkward (as we know) with\r\nhis hands and feet but hiding a heart of gold, and destined to inherit\r\nnothing. He was not yet of age when his mother died, and during the\r\nfirst years of his manhood he passed more and more time under the\r\nroof of this kindly and powerful woman who had determined that the\r\nmisfortunes or faults of his parents should not be visited upon him.\r\n\r\nShe took him everywhere, she kept him in pocket money and, most\r\nimportant of all, two years ago she had arranged his marriage.\r\n\r\nThe moment was opportune: he was twenty-five, he had lost his father,\r\nhe was penniless, the title of Grinstead into which he would certainly\r\ncome was distant and was unprovided for. He had not chosen, or rather\r\nhad not been given, the opportunity of entering, the army, but\r\nthere had been just enough bungling about that to make him miss the\r\nuniversity also. He was so unfitted for diplomacy that even William\r\nBailey, who was accustomed to recommend for that profession the least\r\nvivacious of his young friends, shook his head when it was proposed,\r\nand after a very short experience in Paris he was withdrawn from it.\r\n\r\nNo profession naturally proposed itself to a man of his talents, and\r\nhe had not the initiative to live as a free lance. His marriage,\r\ntherefore, was one of these providential things which seemed to fit\r\nalmost too exactly into the general scheme of life to be true. He\r\nmet his wife when Mary Smith (after making all her inquiries at the\r\nPetheringtons’) had caught and branded that heiress: and the wife so\r\nbranded was Sudie Benson, the daughter of so wealthy an American as\r\nmade the traffic of London not infrequently halt for his convenience,\r\nand who rather more than two years before my story bursts open, had\r\nseen fit to bring the radiant girl to London.\r\n\r\nThe two were forcibly introduced--I mean the boy and the girl--they\r\nunderstood from the first what their destiny was to be. She could\r\nfind no fault in the society which swam round her and to which such\r\na marriage would introduce her activities; he saw no drawback to the\r\nalliance save one or two mannerisms in his prospective father-in-law,\r\nwhich time might modify--or on the other hand, might not.\r\n\r\nOle Man Benson, to give him once more the name by which he was known\r\nand hated in another sphere, from the first ten thousand[1] which by\r\nthe age of forty-three he had laboriously accumulated in shredded\r\ncodfish, had dealt not with things, as do lesser men, but with figures.\r\nHe had gone boldly forward like a young Napoleon, using, it must be\r\nremembered, not only the money of others but very often his own as well.\r\n\r\nHe had been born of Scotch-Irish parents, probably of the name of\r\nBenson, and certainly married in the First Baptist Church of Cincinnati\r\nnot quite three-quarters of a century ago. He was the youngest child of\r\na numerous family, and was baptized or named after the poet Theocritus,\r\nwith a second or middle name of Chepstow, which in his signature he\r\ncommonly reduced to its initial letter.\r\n\r\nTheocritus C. Benson, now familiar to the whole Anglo-Saxon race of\r\nevery colour and clime, was of that type always rare but now, though\r\nrare, conspicuous, which can so organise and direct the acts of others\r\nas to bring order out of chaos, chaos out of order, and alternately\r\naccumulate and disperse fortunes hitherto unprecedented in the history\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nHe was accustomed (in the interviews which he was proud to grant to\r\nthe newspapers of England, America and the Colonies) to ascribe his\r\ngreat position to unwearied industry and to an abhorrence of all excess\r\n(notably in the consumption of fermented liquors) and particularly of\r\nthe horrid practice of gambling. His puritan upbringing, which had\r\ntaught him to look upon cards as the Devil’s picture-book, and upon\r\nracing as akin to the drama in its spiritual blight, was, he would\r\nconstantly assert, the key to all that he had done since he left his\r\nfather’s home. But in this manly self-judgment the Hon. Mr. Benson did\r\nhimself an injustice. These high qualities are to be discovered in many\r\nmillion of his fellow-citizens, and he might as well have pointed, as\r\nsometimes he did point with pride, to the number of his Lodge or to his\r\nignorance of foreign languages as the causes of his repeated triumphs.\r\n\r\nThere was more: To his hatred of hazard and to his stern sense of duty\r\nand unbending industry, he added something of that daring which has\r\nmade for the greatness of the blood in all its adventures Overseas,\r\nand for no branch more than for the Scotch-Irish.\r\n\r\nHe would boldly advance sums in blind confidence of the future, the\r\nmere total of which would have appalled a lesser man, and he would as\r\nboldly withdraw them to the ruin of prosperous concerns, where another\r\nwould have been content to let production take its own course. And this\r\nfine command of cash and of credit which he used as a General uses an\r\narmy, had in it something of personal courage; for towards the latter\r\npart of his life, when he had come to control a vast private fortune,\r\nit was imperative that in many a bold conception he himself should\r\nstand to lose or gain.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when his only daughter left her happy Belgian convent to\r\nbe presented at the Court of St. James, he was, though at the height of\r\nhis fortunes, a lonely and to some extent an embittered man.\r\n\r\nHis wife had married another: their only child he had not seen for\r\nthree years, and though he knew that her robust common sense would\r\nstand against the religious environment of the gentle nuns who had been\r\nentrusted with her upbringing, yet he could not but feel that she had\r\npassed the most formative years of her life in an alien air, and under\r\ninfluences quite other than those of the Ohio Valley.\r\n\r\nHe had therefore determined to decline numerous and advantageous offers\r\nand to be present himself in London during the season which saw her\r\nintroduction to the world, and there, in spite of his unfamiliarity\r\nwith English ways, he soon appreciated the central position of Mary\r\nSmith whose late husband indeed he had come across a quarter of a\r\ncentury before when he was freezing the Topekas off the Pit.\r\n\r\nTheocritus C. Benson had seen young Demaine and was contented; he was\r\nalso naturally anxious to come across old Lord Grinstead if possible,\r\nthat he might estimate for himself how long his daughter might have\r\nto wait for her title. Indeed he would not allow the marriage to take\r\nplace until the old man had been pointed out to him, shrivelled almost\r\nto nothingness and pulled with extreme caution and deliberation in a\r\nbath-chair through the private gardens of Bayton House.\r\n\r\nHad he known that the figure thus exhibited to him so far from being\r\nthat of the aged peer was but the carcase of a ruined dependant it\r\nwould perhaps have done little to alter his decision, for though Lord\r\nGrinstead was of gigantic stature, with purple face and thunderous\r\nvoice, yet his habit of gross and excessive drinking gave him a tenure\r\nof life at least as precarious as that of the enfeebled figure upon\r\nwhich the financier had gazed; and what is more, Lord Grinstead, though\r\nan execrable horseman, had suddenly begun to hunt upon hired mounts\r\nwith a recklessness and tenacity which, if from that cause alone,\r\nshould speedily ensure a violent death.\r\n\r\nWhen all was happily settled, when Demaine had been given away by his\r\nprincipal creditor, and Sudie by her upright and handsome old father,\r\nwhen the last of the wedding gifts had been exchanged at the usual\r\ndiscount and the young couple had gone off to Honiton Castle which had\r\nbeen lent them for £2000 during the honeymoon, another aspect of life\r\nhad to be considered.\r\n\r\nA point upon which Mary Smith had done her best and failed was the\r\nsettlements--£1500 a year to stand between his child and starvation\r\nor worse, Theocritus was willing to determine. It was the sum he\r\nhad himself named before the first negotiations were begun; but as\r\nthey proceeded he refused to change it by one penny, and at last the\r\ndiscussion was abandoned in despair. All the young people might need\r\nthey should have--she was his only child, they could trust him to be\r\nmore than generous. Capital sums when they were required for anything\r\nbut direct investment, should be always at their disposal, and the half\r\nor more than the half of his enormous income should be ready to their\r\ncall; but he resolutely retained to himself the right to control the\r\nmanagement of all save the infinitesimal sum which was to stand between\r\nSudie and her husband’s tyranny, or the world’s harshness.\r\n\r\nMary Smith’s veiled threats and open flattery were alike useless. She\r\ncapitulated, told the young woman to earmark her tiny allowance for\r\njourneys, and gained from Theocritus Chepstow only this:--that he would\r\nbuy a freehold for them, build and furnish it. Theocritus was on like\r\na bird; and the lovely little lodge which London now knows as Demaine\r\nHouse, with its curious formal gardens, odd Dutch stables and Grecian\r\nweathercock on the site of the old mews in what is now Benson Street,\r\nis the proof that he kept his promise.\r\n\r\nFor a year Ole Man Benson had not only kept his promise in the way of\r\nbuilding and furnishing for the young people: he had done more. He had\r\nfloated them upon London with all the revenue that could be reserved\r\nfrom the new venture upon which he designed to double the colossal sums\r\nwhich directly or indirectly stood to his name, and every penny that he\r\ncould spare from his first early purchases of Popocatapetls went into\r\nthe status and future social position of his daughter. Now, after two\r\nyears, Popocatapetl Dam was finished and yet greater things lay before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDemaine was put into Parliament by a majority comparable only to the\r\nfinancial advantages which had secured it. His birth, her voice and its\r\ntimbre, gathered into Demaine House all that so small a Great House\r\ncould hold.\r\n\r\nSo things had stood to within a week of the March day upon which we\r\nsaw that very different man, Charles Repton, walking into the City of\r\nLondon....\r\n\r\nBut from the name of Charles Repton let me rapidly slew off to the\r\nsombre pyramid of that peak in the neighbourhood of Darien and recall\r\nthe caprice of Popocatapetl upon which so much was to depend.\r\n\r\nIt was a Wednesday in that March of 1915 that the Statesman was to\r\nspeak in Washington at ten: (for two years Demaine House had thriven,\r\nit slept that Tuesday night unconscious of its fate). It was for the\r\nWednesday at 3.30 that the order to sell stood in Ole Man Benson’s\r\nname.... Well ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nLate upon that Tuesday night Ole Man Benson boarded the Louis XV.\r\nRosewood Express de Luxe as it steamed out of the Chicago Depot of the\r\nM.N. & C.: he was off to his mountain property in Idaho, and in the\r\nprivacy of his section, Ole Man Benson slept.\r\n\r\nNot so the forces of Nature, so often destructive of the schemes of\r\npigmy man!\r\n\r\nAn appalling convulsion altogether exceeding anything heard or dreamt\r\nof since the beginning of time, totally destroyed the Popocatapetelian\r\nlandscape in the small hours of that same morning; and as, a thousand\r\nmiles to the north, the Louis XV. Rosewood Express de Luxe rolled in a\r\nterrific manner upon its insufficient rock ballast, the subterranean\r\nriver, the perennial fires and the unscrupulously erected edifice of\r\nthe great dam, shot aloft in a vast confusion and were replaced by a\r\nchasm some quarter of a mile in breadth and of a depth unfathomable to\r\nmortal plummets. It was March; March 1915. In Iowa in March it snows.\r\nThe locomotive and two of the cars attached to the Louis XV. Rosewood\r\nExpress de Luxe were buried a little beyond Blucher in a drift of snow\r\nthe height and dimensions of which exceeded the experience of the\r\noldest settler in that charming prairie town. _The same storm which had\r\ncaused the misadventure had broken the wires for many miles around._\r\n\r\nOle Man Benson awoke, therefore, to a scene of great discomfort, but\r\nupon such a date and with a prospect of so considerable an increase\r\nof fortune awaiting him upon that very day, he was the gayest of the\r\ncompany, and in spite of his years he shovelled away with the best of\r\nthem, a-splendid-type-of-Anglo-Saxon-manhood.\r\n\r\nBy one o’clock that noon the telegraph at last was working, and the\r\nfirst messages came through to the little depot; they concerned a riot\r\nin a local home for paralytics. Next, before two, news was conveyed of\r\nan outbreak of religious mania in the town of Omaha. It was not till a\r\nlate hour in the evening that Ole Man Benson, waiting anxiously for the\r\nreport of the great speech, heard the earliest tidings of the practical\r\njoke which Providence--in spite of Gen. Porfirio Diaz’ equable and\r\nmasterly rule--had played him in the distant tropics.\r\n\r\nThe same rapidity of thought which had enabled Theocritus to accumulate\r\nhis vast fortune enabled him in that moment to perceive that he was\r\nruined. Not indeed necessarily for ever,--he had known such things\r\nbefore--but at any rate in a manner sufficiently hefty to produce his\r\nimmediate collapse.\r\n\r\nWhen, next morning, he could bring himself to read the papers, the\r\ndisaster appeared before him in its exact proportions and tremendous\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nThat speech, that statesman-like speech, had never been delivered--and\r\nfor the best of reasons: Popocatapetl had unbosomed first! In the wild\r\nfall of prices nothing had done more to ruin the market than the heavy\r\nselling of agents acting on account of Theocritus C. Benson. There\r\nwere dozens within the roaring walls of the building in Wall Street,\r\nthousands in the anxious streets without, who saw in the Benson selling\r\nyet another move of diabolical cunning proceeding from that Napoleonic\r\nbrain. His agents had done their work thoroughly and well. They had\r\nanticipated his orders with such promptitude that no stock was left\r\nunsaleable upon their hands, and when, before the end of that black\r\nday, Popocatapetls were offering at the cost of haulage, they could\r\nproudly say that every interest of their client’s in the ruined concern\r\nhad been disposed of. And Theocritus C. Benson, henceforward known as\r\nthe Earthquake King, was left with no unsaleable paper upon his hands,\r\nbut on the contrary with a solid cash result equivalent to at least\r\nthree cents on the dollar of his yesterday’s fortune. This it is to be\r\nfaithfully served in the intricacies of modern speculation!\r\n\r\nA truce to Ole Man Benson! If I have introduced his wretched\r\ncommercial adventures at such length it is but to explain the\r\nportentous effect which they had upon the fortunes of one British\r\nstatesman.\r\n\r\nFar off in London (Eng.) George Mulross Demaine saw nothing in his\r\nmorning newspaper but the news (to him a serious matter) that Pink Eye\r\nwas scratched for the Grand National. His wife, whom her father had\r\nshielded from the vulgar atmosphere of commerce, noted indeed the news\r\nfrom the Western Hemisphere and was for a passing moment concerned; but\r\nOle Man Benson did not telegraph, for there were no flies upon him, nor\r\ndid Ole Man Benson even write, and for the same entomological reason.\r\n\r\nOh! no. Ole Man Benson proceeded to New York, had certain interviews\r\nwith certain people, took certain drugs, went through a certain cure,\r\nlaid as he hoped the foundations of yet another scheme, and not until\r\n30th of March, a full week after the matter I have described, did\r\nTheocritus dictate a brief note to his daughter, which I will here\r\ntranscribe:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (If not delivered, please return         “2909 KANAKA BUILDING\r\n      within three days to                      NEW YORK CITY\r\n      Theocritus C. Benson.)                      30/3/’15\r\n\r\nComing across on Potassic. Depart 4th--probable arrival Plymouth 11th.\r\nShall cable.\r\n                                           (Signed)      FATHER”\r\n\r\nWith true business instinct the great organiser dispatched the cable\r\nupon the 4th of April, so that his daughter received upon the evening\r\nof the same day in her London house the reassuring word “eleventh,”\r\nwhich her reception of the letter a few days later easily enabled her\r\nto comprehend; and on 11th of April, sure enough, Ole Man Benson in\r\na grave and sober manner embraced his daughter on the landing-stage\r\nat Plymouth. George Mulross Demaine was also there, standing a little\r\nbehind the affectionate group, clothed in a large green ulster and a\r\ncap of the same cloth and colour with an enormous peak.\r\n\r\nThey got into the train together and all the way up to London the\r\nmaster of empty millions said nothing.\r\n\r\nAs they were driving to Demaine House he spoke: “Any o’ your folk to\r\nsupper?” he said.\r\n\r\nHis daughter with filial gaiety assured him that she had waited his\r\norders, to which he replied, “Good girl Sudie.”\r\n\r\nDuring the meal he was as silent as he had been upon the journey, and\r\nat the end of it he gave his son-in-law to understand that he desired\r\nto talk business with his daughter and preferred to be alone with her:\r\nand George Mulross went out, taking his wine with him, for his wife’s\r\nfather drank none, but only Toxine.\r\n\r\nThe message Ole Man Benson had to deliver to Sudie was simple\r\nenough: there would, for he could not say how long, be no more money\r\nforthcoming. He hoped the position might be retrieved; he was\r\nconfident it would be retrieved before the Fall, by Thanksgiving at\r\nlatest. Till then, nit!\r\n\r\nSudie had all her father’s readiness; she pointed out to him at once\r\nthat under the conditions of English politics the total cessation of\r\nan income the source of which was familiar to her husband’s friends,\r\nwould at once affect her father’s credit in future transactions, and\r\nclearly showed that no investment could be more to his advantage than\r\nthe placing of sums at her disposal for the proper up-keep of his\r\ndaughter’s position in the society of London.\r\n\r\nTo this powerful argument Theocritus immediately replied that those who\r\nlooked for hens’ teeth were liable to be stung; that cigars containing\r\nexplosive matter had been offered him too frequently in the past for\r\nhim now to entertain the thought of consuming them; and that when he\r\nwas bulling London he would advise. By which parables he intended to,\r\nand did, convey to his daughter his fixed conclusion that it was up to\r\nher to bear futures: and lest she should have failed wholly to seize\r\nhis point, he told her briefly and in the plainest terms that whatever\r\nrocks were going were wanted--badly--to sling at something with more\r\ndough in it than Mayfair.\r\n\r\nWith that their brief discourse was ended.\r\n\r\nThis little conversation over, Demaine was given to understand that\r\nhe might re-enter the room. He was a little shy in doing so, for\r\ninterviews of this sort usually meant some new gift or subsidy, but it\r\nwas shyness of a pleasant sort and he had little doubt that he should\r\nhear in a moment the extent or at least the nature of the new bounty\r\nwhich his young household was to receive. He was therefore only puzzled\r\nby the novelty of phrasing when his father-in-law, looking at him in a\r\nmanner rather humorous than severe, remarked:\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve stacked it up with Sudie, and she may stack it up with\r\nyou.” Then in a kinder tone, he added: “You catch?”\r\n\r\n“Yes sir,” said George untruthfully.\r\n\r\n“Why then, ’nuff’s said,” concluded the Captain of Industry, and very\r\nthoughtfully he picked his teeth with a long fine silver point which\r\nhe habitually carried in his waistcoat for that purpose of the toilet.\r\n“It’s no call ter last long,” he muttered half to himself and half to\r\nthe bewildered Demaine; “anyhow the pump’s sucking; and there’s no more\r\noil,”--to elucidate which somewhat cryptic phrase Sudie begged her\r\nhusband not to stand gaping there like a booby, but to sit down and\r\nunderstand as much of it as he could.\r\n\r\nWhereupon in the clearest possible language, punctuated by her father’s\r\ndecisive and approving nods, she translated into older idioms exactly\r\nwhat had happened, and exactly what it meant. They were worth just\r\n£1500 a year between them from that day onwards for--well, till there\r\nwas a change.\r\n\r\nIt was not tact but nervousness that prevented George at the end of\r\nthis dreadful passage from suggesting that his father-in-law could do\r\nagain what he had done before, that the strain was temporary, and that\r\nhe for his part hoped for the best; but his wife, who was by this time\r\nfairly well accustomed to follow his thought, was careful to point out\r\nthat whatever the future might do for them, the present was dirt black,\r\nand the present meant at least two years:\r\n\r\n“At least two years?” (to her father).\r\n\r\nTo which her father very simply and plainly answered her: “Yep.”\r\n\r\nThere was much of the splendid blood of Theocritus in Sudie; indeed it\r\nis often observed that the genius of the father will descend to the\r\ndaughter--and _vice versa_. The very next sentence, therefore, with\r\nwhich Sudie prodded her disconsolate spouse, was a demand for a list of\r\nthose who might be ready to take Demaine House, to take it at once, to\r\ntake it furnished, to take it high, to take it by the year and not for\r\nthe season, and, when they had taken it, to _pay_.\r\n\r\nDemaine immediately suggested the name of such of his acquaintance as\r\nmight most desire to occupy such a position in London, and were also\r\nleast able to do so, but he was careful to add after each name, some\r\nsuch remark as “But of course they won’t do,” or “but I don’t think he\r\ncan afford it,”--until his father-in-law in a pardonable lassitude went\r\nout.\r\n\r\n“The best thing you can do,” said his wife with renewed decision when\r\nthey were alone, “is to get up right here and go round to Mary’s.” For\r\nit was a notable circumstance in Sudie’s relations with Mrs. Smith\r\nthat while that lady gave _her_ her full title, _she_ would invariably\r\nallude to Mrs. Smith by the more affectionate medium of the Christian\r\nname.\r\n\r\nDemaine assented. He found his father-in-law at the door; they went\r\nout together into the night, and when he had timidly admitted that he\r\nwas going South towards St. James’s, the financier with rapid decision\r\nannounced that he was going North towards Marylebone,--and they parted.\r\n\r\nMary Smith was not in. It was only eleven and the theatre detained\r\nher. George waited. He took counsel from several valuable pictures,\r\nwas careful to touch and handle nothing upon her tables (for he knew\r\nthat she detested an accident and with almost-canine-sagacity could\r\ninvariably detect his interference), and stood, not at ease.\r\n\r\nShe came in at twelve; she brought a party with her, and she insisted\r\nupon supper. It was one before she could talk to him alone, and she\r\ntalked to him until two.\r\n\r\nThe first thing she did was to tell him that he could not let his house\r\nthat season and that he must make up his mind to it. The second was to\r\ndiscover what balance there was at the bank--and to hear that it was\r\npitifully small. The third was to offer him a short loan that would\r\ncarry him over at least a few weeks of necessary expense, and the\r\nfourth to tell him that, not upon the morrow but upon the day after,\r\nshe would have decided.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he must post a letter for her.\r\n\r\nShe sat down and wrote at once to William Bailey.\r\n\r\n“When you get outside, George,” she said as she gave him the letter,\r\n“you will see a very large pillar box. It is much larger than most\r\npillar boxes; it has two slits in it instead of one. Do you follow me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said humbly.\r\n\r\n“You will not put this letter in your pocket, George,” she went on\r\nfirmly and kindly, as certain practitioners do when they propose to\r\nhypnotise their patients. “You will carry it in front of you like\r\nthis.” She put it into his right hand, crooked his arm, held his wrist\r\nupright, so that his eyes could not help falling upon the missive. “The\r\nmoment you get outside you will put it in the _right_-hand slit of the\r\npillar box, won’t you?”\r\n\r\nHe said “yes” again, as humbly as before. And as he went out he did all\r\nthat she had asked him, though to make the matter more sure she watched\r\nfor a moment from the window.\r\n\r\nWhen William Bailey received the letter next morning he was in the\r\nbest of moods. For one thing he was going to leave London for three\r\nweeks,--a prospect that always delighted him. For another he was going\r\nto do some sea fishing, a sport of which he was passionately fond.\r\nFor a third, an Austrian money-lender and a baron at that, had shot\r\nhimself--it had of course been kept out of the English papers, but he\r\nhad read all the details in one of the anti-semitic rags which are the\r\ndisgrace of Vienna, and his spirits had risen, buoyant at the news.\r\nFinally, and what was of perhaps most importance for an eccentric and\r\nmiddle-aged celibate, the house which he had hired for a month he knew\r\nexactly suited him. It was the house of Merry, the architect, and stood\r\njust so far from Parham Town as would give him the isolation he adored,\r\nyet just so near to Parham Harbour as would put him in touch with the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons he read Mary Smith’s little note in great gaiety\r\nof heart, and in a mood in which men of influence are willing to do\r\nwhat they can for their kind.\r\n\r\nLike many men of wealth and ability whom opportunity has made\r\neccentric, William Bailey could not bear to handle the pen. He\r\nhesitated for some moments between the extreme boredom of writing and\r\nthe tantalising business of the telephone, decided in favour of the\r\nformer, wrote on a form--\r\n\r\n  “Get Dolly to make room for him.\r\n\r\n                     (Signed)      BILL”--\r\n\r\nand sent the message out to be telegraphed to his cousin.\r\n\r\nMary Smith, receiving it, received with it a great light.\r\n\r\nIt was not always easy for her to follow the changes that took place in\r\npolitical appointments, but she was certain of _this_, that the present\r\nadministration contained more unfamiliar names than she cared to think\r\nof, and that there _must_ be room in such a crowd for a man of poor\r\nGeorge’s standing.\r\n\r\nNow from the moment that such thoughts as these entered Mary Smith’s\r\nhead about a man’s appointment, that man was safe: poor George’s future\r\nwas therefore ultimately secure. But there was no time to lose. He\r\nmust get on to the front bench, and he must get there with a salary,\r\nand the salary must be sufficient, and the promotion must be rapid.\r\nShe remembered that Dolly would be at the Petheringtons’ that evening,\r\nand she determined to be there too. She hoped and prayed that nothing\r\nwould bring George, though since George was everywhere the chances were\r\nagainst her prayer being answered.\r\n\r\nFor the moment she thought of warning him not to come, then,\r\nremembering certain indiscretions of his in the past, she thought it\r\nbest to say nothing, but to trust to chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Repton, manifold as were his financial interests, knew nothing\r\nof Popocatapetls, and cared less.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which his life was to be influenced by that very distant\r\ncataclysm was hidden from him; as (for that matter) it would be hidden\r\nfrom the reader also had not this book been most boldly published.\r\n\r\nYet another thing the full import of which may escape the reader, is\r\nthe fact that Sir Charles Repton was extremely tender just behind the\r\nears; but for this the reader herself alone and not the author is to\r\nblame, for if the reader had any knowledge of Caryll’s Ganglia she\r\nwould have guessed at twenty things. But no matter: Caryll’s Ganglia\r\nand their effect upon self-control very much interrupt the chain of\r\nthose absorbing adventures which, if she will continue, the reader will\r\npresently peruse.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, those regions of the head which lie behind either ear were for\r\nsome reason or other very tender, large, sensitive to pressure, and in\r\na way abnormal in Sir Charles Repton.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, somewhere about the corner of Tottenham Court Road\r\n(on that March day on which we left him walking to his Board meeting),\r\nhis hat blew off: when he had run after it: when in doing so he had\r\nruffled his fine crop of white hair; and when, to have it all set\r\nright, he had gone into a second-rate barber’s, it may well be imagined\r\nthat he gave the man who served him minute instructions that the head\r\nrest upon the back of the chair should be made comfortable--and so it\r\nwas. And on to it Sir Charles Repton leant gingerly the head upon whose\r\nclear action depended the future fortunes of Van Diemens.\r\n\r\nThe man in brushing his hair with an apparatus of singular power,\r\nturned the monologue on to the commonplaces of the moment, which\r\nincluded the bestiality of the Government and the abhorrent nature\r\nof the Italian people, of whom at that particular moment in 1915 the\r\npeople of London stood in abject terror.\r\n\r\nWhether it was the pressure of the violent rotating brush or some\r\nlooseness in the screw that held the support behind him, with a shock\r\nand a clang that support slipped, and Sir Charles Repton’s head came\r\nsmartly down, first through nothingness and then on to two iron nuts\r\nwhich exactly corresponded to those processes of the skull just\r\nbehind either ear, in which, as I have taken pains to remark, he was\r\npeculiarly sensitive: for they were largely developed in him and\r\nnourished it would seem by an unusual supply of blood.\r\n\r\nSharp as was the pain, Charles Repton controlled himself, listened to\r\nthe explanations and apologies of the barber, and submitted himself\r\nagain to the grooming for which he had entered.\r\n\r\nWhen he went out again into the street he had almost forgotten the\r\naccident. The two places where his head had been struck swelled\r\nslightly and he touched them now and again, but they soon passed from\r\nhis mind; within ten minutes they were no longer painful; yet was there\r\nset up in them from that moment, an irritation which was to have no\r\ninconsiderable consequence.\r\n\r\nHe went on into the City, ordered one or two things which he had set\r\ndown in his memorandum before starting, looked in at a City Club\r\nwhere he knew one or two items of news were awaiting him, and slowly\r\nbetook himself to the offices of the Van Diemens Company. He had\r\nthoroughly planned out the scheme of that morning’s work; it needed no\r\nrecapitulation in his mind, yet as his habit was, just before opening\r\nthe door of the Board Room, in the few seconds of going up the stairs,\r\nhe briefly presented his scheme of tactics to his own mind.\r\n\r\nThe Directors must ask the shareholders for fresh capital; a nominal\r\nmillion, an increase of 25 per cent. upon the value of the shares at\r\npar. That was the first point.\r\n\r\nThe second point was the object for which this levy should nominally\r\nbe demanded. On that also he had made up his mind. Paton had quite\r\nunconsciously suggested to him the master idea; a little belt of\r\nuntravelled and unknown country (locally known as the “Out and Out”)\r\nwherein the degraded Kawangas--so Paton had told him, and after all\r\nPaton had been there--held their orgies in Mutchi-time, alone separated\r\nPerks’ Bay from the Straits, and the long detour which all traffic must\r\nnow make between the coaling station and the high road to the East,\r\ncould be cut off by a line crossing that region. Paton had assured him\r\nwith immense enthusiasm that such a line would give its possessor the\r\nstrategic key to the gate of everything East of the Bay of Bengal,\r\nand, what was more important in Sir Charles’ eyes than Paton’s own\r\nopinion, a vast mass of gentlemen in the suburbs of London and perhaps\r\nfive-sixths of the journalists in Fleet Street, were ready to rally to\r\nthe idea. It had been well preached and well dinned in.\r\n\r\nThese two points were clear: they must ask for a million and they must\r\nask it for the purpose of building a railway that would at last ensure\r\nthe Empire against the nightmare of foreign rivals.\r\n\r\nThere was a third point. The shareholders would not or could not\r\nsubscribe a million but that was easily turned. They should be asked\r\nfor no more than 200,000,--a shilling a share--in cash down, “the\r\nremainder to be paid,” etc. etc.\r\n\r\nHad not Sir Charles possessed an iron control of his face, the strong\r\nset smile which he wore as he entered the Board Room would have\r\nbroadened at the recollection of that last detail. On the other hand\r\nhad he not possessed such self-control some movement of annoyance\r\nmight have escaped him to discover present at the table, among his\r\nother colleagues, the late-rising and impervious Bingham. The sight\r\nwas sufficient to exasperate a man of less balance. The hour had been\r\ncarefully chosen to avoid such an accident, and that accident meant\r\nperhaps another half-hour or more of close argument and of subtle\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nFor his colleague Bingham added to a native idiocy of solid texture and\r\nformidable dimensions, the experience of extensive travel; and he was\r\nin particular well acquainted with the district with regard to which\r\nthe Board must that day make its decision. It was certain, therefore,\r\nthat his fellow-Directors would listen to him with peculiar respect,\r\nnot only on account of his stupidity which necessarily commanded a\r\ncertain attention, but also on account of his intimacy with plain\r\nmatters of fact: he had been upon the spot: he was the man who knew.\r\n\r\nIt was just as Repton had feared. Business that might have been done in\r\na quarter of an hour and a decision which contained no more than the\r\nissue of pieces of paper was turned into a long practical discussion by\r\nthe intolerable ponderance of Bingham, who would wait until every one\r\nhad had his say, and then would bring in some dreadful little technical\r\npoint about a marsh, a rainy season or a fly; he was careful to pepper\r\nhis conversation with local terms a hundred times more remote than the\r\nKawanga and Mutchi-time; in every conceivable manner he put his spoke\r\ninto the wheels of business.\r\n\r\nSo considerable was the effect produced by the redoubtable Bingham at\r\nthat table that, were Cæsarism a common political theory in elderly\r\nmen, the whole conduct of Van Diemens would for the future have been\r\nput into his hands. Luckily for the Company its forms were not so\r\ndemocratic.\r\n\r\nCharles Repton waited patiently. When he spoke his point was as simple\r\nas falling off a log: what was wanted was not a railway in itself, it\r\nwas a new issue of capital. He was profoundly indifferent what label\r\nshould be tied onto that issue, so long as it was a label good enough\r\nto get the original shareholders to come in. The public would never\r\ncome in as things were: its pusillanimity was increased by the fact\r\nthat the Company had been in existence for now eleven years and had\r\nhitherto failed to pay a dividend of any kind. After some thought he\r\nhad decided, in company with one or two others upon the Board, that a\r\nrailway through a certain district of the concession, locally known\r\nas “The Out and Out,” and remarkable for the fact that no white man\r\nhad yet visited it, would be the best attraction he could offer. He\r\nwas prepared to show by the aid of maps upon which should be marked\r\nall favourable things, that a line driven through this district would\r\nunite with the world two provinces teeming with inexhaustible wealth,\r\nof a heavenly climate, and hitherto by the mere accident of the Out\r\nand Out belt, cut off from the longing embraces of commerce. More;\r\nhe could show that this single line of railway would bestow upon his\r\nbeloved country so vast a strategic superiority over all other nations\r\nas would ensure her immediate success in any campaign, no matter what\r\nthe quality of the troops she might employ. To this he added the\r\nattractions of touring in the tropics and the allurements of big game\r\nfor those wealthy gentlemen whom he designed in the new prospectus to\r\nterm Shikaris.\r\n\r\nWith the new capital subscribed and long before the line was surveyed,\r\nthere was little doubt that the shares which had fallen from over £9 to\r\nthe comparatively low quotation--but oh! not price--of 16/3 (at which\r\nquotation he had first consented to tender his services to the Company)\r\nwould rise to certainly over £1, perhaps to nearer £2, and what was\r\nmore to the point they would be readily saleable. He was prepared in\r\nthat event to transfer his property in them to others, a course which\r\nhe sincerely hoped his fellow-shareholders would also follow, though of\r\ncourse he would not take it upon himself to advise any one of them.\r\n\r\nBingham, like the practical man he was, pinned himself to the railway.\r\nHe _knew_ the Out and Out; not that he’d ever been there,--no white\r\nman had,--but he had talked to several of the Kawanga in Mutchi-time,\r\nand he shook his head despondently. There was one continuous line of\r\nprecipice 3000 feet deep; there was a river which was now a stream\r\nfive miles broad, now a marsh and now again dry--, sometimes for years\r\non end. There was a dense mass of forest; there was that much more\r\ndifficult thing, a belt of shifting sand dunes; there were nearly 300\r\nmiles without water through these. He was prepared to speak all day\r\nupon the difficulties of building a railway which none but the least\r\nintelligent had ever designed to build.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Repton could ride himself on the curb, and more than\r\nanything else this mastery had given him his present great position;\r\nbut that day he had to exercise his will to the full, and in that\r\nexercise he felt slight twinges behind the ear where the barber’s rest\r\nhad struck him. It was all he could do to prevent himself from drumming\r\non the table or from making those interruptions which only serve as\r\nfuel to the slow criticisms of the dull.\r\n\r\nAt last--and heaven knows with what subtlety and patience--he\r\nconquered. There was a vote (a thing he had wished to avoid), but he\r\ncarried it by two; and it was agreed that the issue of new capital\r\nshould be made, that a General Meeting of the shareholders should\r\nbe called for Tuesday the 2nd of June, and that he, Repton, should\r\nhave the task of laying the scheme before them. The new prospectus,\r\nwhich he had already drafted, was passed round and with a very few\r\nemendations accepted. Then, after as heavy a bit of work as had ever\r\nbeen undertaken in the way of persuasion, the principal brain in that\r\ncompany was at last free for other things.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past one. He had just time to meet and to convince yet\r\nanother fool upon another matter: the foreigner acting as agent for his\r\nGovernment, on the matter of the bridge: a bridge which the Foreign\r\nGovernment might or might not build, and, if they built, might or might\r\nnot order from a firm which Repton had reason to befriend. Repton must\r\nlunch with that foreigner: he must persuade him to build: he must\r\nget the order--then he must be in his place in the House in time for\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThe foreigner was as wax in his hands: not as good warm wax,\r\nadulterated wax, candle wax, but rather as beeswax, very ancient\r\nand hard. It was a full hour before that wax was pliable, but once\r\nagain the unceasing, managed, strict watchfulness, the set face which\r\nhad always in it something stern but never anything aggressive, the\r\nbalance of judgment, conquered. Down to the smallest detail of that\r\nconversation Repton was the artist, his host at the lunch was the\r\npublic, accepting and gradually convinced, and the bridge was ordered\r\nfor the Foreign Government, though it was a useless bridge leading\r\nfrom nowhere to nowhere, and though it could have been built much more\r\nsolidly and much better by the people of the place than by the English\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\nThen Repton went on to the House of Commons, and there, as in every\r\nduty of the day, the weight of his character told.\r\n\r\nThe questions were slight, there were not half a dozen that concerned\r\nhis Department, but he answered them all with that curious restraint of\r\ntone which somehow made it difficult to cross-examine his Department.\r\nAnd he faced the House with such a poise and expression that one almost\r\nwondered, as one looked at him, upon which side he was sitting, or\r\nwhether indeed the mere game of In’s and Out’s entered into his brain\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be quite above the divisions of party. He seemed a sort\r\nof Ambassador from the permanent officials and to carry into the House\r\nof Commons an atmosphere at once judicial and experienced which no one\r\ncould resist. When he had first accepted the Wardenship of the Court\r\nof Dowry it had been wondered that he should take so secondary a post.\r\nNow, after these four years, it was rather wondered why no one had seen\r\ntill then the possibilities that lay in the position.\r\n\r\nAfter that typical and decisive day, Repton, for more than a month,\r\nrefrained from debate.\r\n\r\nHe was ever in his seat on those two days in each week when it was his\r\nbusiness to answer questions: he never let his understrapper appear for\r\nhim; for one full fortnight he was permanently in attendance, watching\r\nthe fortunes before a select committee of a certain Bill, for which the\r\npublic cared nothing but which he knew might change in a very important\r\nparticular the public fortune--but in general he seemed to be in\r\nretirement. He was planning hard.\r\n\r\nA mixture of Imperial sentiment and personal pride urged him to put\r\nVan Diemens on their legs, and all April, all through the Easter\r\nRecess, he remained in London working. He worked right on into May; for\r\nthe first week after Parliament met again he was seen but little; one\r\nthing only troubled him, that at long intervals--sometimes as long as\r\nten days, an uneasy twinge behind the ears, the result of that little\r\nhalf-forgotten accident, incommoded him. These twinges came a trifle\r\nmore frequently as May advanced. After the last of them he had felt a\r\nlittle dazed--no more. And still he worked and worked, holding twenty\r\nreins in his hands.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of May the fruit of all this labour began to appear.\r\nCamptons were reconstructed, arbitration had been forced upon the\r\nDocks combination in the North just in time to prevent a wholesale\r\ntransference of shipping abroad, and more important than all, perhaps,\r\nthere had begun to crop up in the papers, here, there, and everywhere,\r\nthe mention--and the flattering mention--of Van Diemens, and the\r\nwealthy were already familiar with the conception of a certain railway\r\nin the land which was under the Van Diemens charter.\r\n\r\nThe wealthy, but as yet only the wealthy; it is as fatal to be too\r\nearly as to be too late, and that brain which knew how to drive and\r\ncompel, had also known so well how to restrain, that the shares still\r\nremained unsaleable with the meaningless quotation of sixteen shillings\r\nand a few fluctuating pence still attached to them in the market lists.\r\n\r\nSo Repton stood in the middle of May, 1915, when he became aware that\r\nan obscure member (obscure at least in the House of Commons--and Repton\r\nnoticed little of, and cared nothing for, the merely luxurious world of\r\nLondon), an aristocrat of sorts, one of the _Demaine_,--George Demaine\r\nit seemed, was being talked about. He was being pushed somehow. Repton\r\nhardly heeded so commonplace a phenomenon, save perhaps to wonder what\r\njob was on:--he continued to push Van Diemens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Petheringtons’ house, to which Mary Smith drove on the evening of\r\n12th of April, under the two pretty little electric lights of her car,\r\none for either side of her face, was one of a hundred similar London\r\nhouses, a huge brown cube in the middle of Grosvenor Square.\r\n\r\nIt was no longer called Petherington House; it had once again regained\r\nits more familiar appellation of No. 89, under which it had been\r\nfamous for the complete lack of entertainment of any sort which had\r\ndistinguished the short session of 1912. Then old Hooker had died, the\r\nchanges in the Cabinet had come, Hooker’s wife had married the Bishop\r\nand also died immediately, and finally the Petheringtons had taken the\r\nplace, foolishly called it by their own title for a few months, and\r\nfinding it unknown to cabmen and to their friends’ chauffeurs also\r\nunder this appellation, they slowly reverted to the old name.\r\n\r\nIf hospitality is a fault when pushed to an extreme, the Petheringtons\r\nexhibited that fault. But so excellent were their arrangements--for\r\nbusiness will out even in the smallest details of domestic life--that\r\nno one suffered in the crush, and that it was perfectly easy in the\r\ntime a guest ordinarily allowed himself for the function, to go up the\r\nstairs and down again, though perhaps too much time was wasted at the\r\nnecessarily narrow entrance where men must seek their hats and coats.\r\n\r\nThe movement of Society in this particular case was rendered the more\r\nfacile by the emptiness of the hall, from which everything had been\r\ntaken except the Great Stuffed Bear which had been shot by the servant\r\nof a trapper who had sold it to the correspondent of the furrier\r\nof Lady Petherington, and which now stood holding a tray, with an\r\nexpression of extreme ferocity, and labelled “The Caucasus, 17th June,\r\n1910,”--for in those mountains Mr. Petherington--as he then was--had\r\ntravelled.\r\n\r\nMary Smith was not disappointed. Mooning aimlessly about the crowded\r\nrooms above, in an atmosphere surcharged with mauve Moravian music--the\r\nloudest of its kind--shuffled the anxious and slightly bowed form of\r\nDolly, the young and popular Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nA foreigner might have thought him to have few friends, so slowly\r\ndid he proceed and with so curious a gaze from one group to another,\r\nseeming half stunned by the vigour of the band and fascinated by the\r\nvigorous contortions of Mr. Arthur Worth who conducted it for all he\r\nwas--I mean with his utmost capacity of gesture and expression. That\r\nforeigner would have suffered an illusion. The Prime Minister was\r\nperfectly well known in face and figure to every one in that room, and\r\nthere were few who did not hope for some advantage from his presence,\r\nbut fewer, far fewer still, who attempted to obtain it. I must of\r\ncourse except Professor Kahn.\r\n\r\nDolly knew his Mary Smith, and resigned himself to suffer. She had\r\nnot come there that night for nothing. She got up to him within half\r\na minute of the view, and found him with peculiar dexterity through a\r\nmaze of wealthy people. She quietly took him away, and sat him in a\r\nlarge chair that stood in a remote recess, where the light was subdued;\r\nshe took advantage of a deafening crash in the music to which its\r\nprevious successes were child’s play, and shouted:\r\n\r\n“When are you going to have your next move?”\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister implored her not to talk shop. Then somewhat\r\ninconsequently he added, weakening: “Why do you want to know?”\r\n\r\nThe music was now whining and part of it was taking breath for another\r\ncharge. It was therefore in quite a low but exceedingly business-like\r\ntone that Mary Smith remarked:\r\n\r\n“Because I want you to do something for Dimmy.”\r\n\r\nThe name suggested to the Prime Minister one of twenty little jobs; he\r\nthought of a jolly little one in Ireland. But she added: “You know what\r\nhas happened?”\r\n\r\nHe didn’t.\r\n\r\nShe told him briefly: Ole Man Benson was broke.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister remembered the explosion of Popocatapetl: he had\r\nvaguely connected the news with something at the time: now he knew what\r\nit was. He looked extremely grave. And when Mary went on to tell him\r\nthat Mrs. Demaine had only £1500 he looked graver still.\r\n\r\n“There isn’t anything of a big sort going just now, Mary,” he said in\r\nquite another tone. But he was thinking his clearest. “I don’t know him\r\nas well as you do,” he added. “Can he _do_ anything?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mary Smith decidedly, “he can’t. But he’d go well in\r\nharness.”\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister seemed to live more actively as he considered the\r\nproblem. The warm air, the scent of clothes and flowers suited him well.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with his left lung which had so endeared him to his\r\nfellow-citizens, he felt far less keenly in the beginning of a warm\r\nspring than at any other time, and evenings such as this rewarded him\r\nfor the sacrifice he made every winter to his duty and to England. Of\r\nthe four years during which he had held the highest of human offices\r\nhe had spent but one winter on the Riviera, and though it had been\r\nnecessary in one year to forego an Autumn session, such a session had\r\nnot in the other three years delayed the meeting of Parliament beyond\r\nthe end of February. His youth stood him in good stead during this\r\nordeal; but there were those (and they were they who loved him most)\r\nwho looked with anxiety upon the frail form and thought, although\r\nthey dared not say, that the years were slipping by and that what a\r\nman could do with impunity when still upon the right side of fifty,\r\nwould become another matter when his fifty-fifth year was passed....\r\nThere was of course always the hope of opposition and its leisure....\r\nThe Broadening of the Streets Bill had roused a tempest of Party\r\npassion.... He had already been publicly stoned in the North.... But no\r\nmatter; for the moment the Prime Minister was full of appreciation, and\r\nfor his cousin’s purposes in the kindliest of moods.\r\n\r\nNevertheless he thought (and his cousin read his thoughts) that she was\r\nasking the impossible. An idea struck him.\r\n\r\n“Has Dimmy been called to the Bar?” he asked.\r\n\r\nShe looked up, puzzled. “I don’t think so.... No, I know he hasn’t. I\r\nput up a hundred for him in 1908 and he buzzed it. I should certainly\r\nhave heard if he had done anything more before his marriage. Naturally\r\n_since_ then....”\r\n\r\n“Yes, naturally,” said the Prime Minister sympathetically. He mused.\r\n“He wouldn’t go abroad?” he said, looking round.\r\n\r\n“What on earth’s the good of that?” said Mary Smith a little testily.\r\n\r\n“Well,” answered the Prime Minister vaguely, as he reviewed certain\r\nposts in his mind, “... No. There isn’t much in that. Anything that\r\ncould be of any use wants leading up to.” And he plunged into thought\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThen with a gesture that many had noticed in him and had thought a mere\r\nidle trick but which was really an accompaniment to calculation, he put\r\nhis ten fingers down upon his knees and lifted them slowly one after\r\nanother. When he had so lifted nine (it was the ring finger of his left\r\nhand) a touch of animation passed over his face, an expression his\r\ncousin could see even in that subdued light.\r\n\r\n“How long does he want it for?” he asked.\r\n\r\nMary Smith was inclined to say “For ever,” but she checked herself; she\r\nremembered the face and manner of Theocritus C. Benson, she trusted his\r\nfuture fortune, and she said:\r\n\r\n“I think even a little while would make a difference.”\r\n\r\nThey were both thinking of the same thing. But the Prime Minister\r\nunderstood what perhaps she did not, that there is no such thing as\r\nautocratic intervention in our public life, that time is required\r\nfor every innovation, and that he who leads must also follow. He was\r\nreviewing as she spoke the prejudices and the ambitions of perhaps\r\ntwenty men, and the power of each. When he spoke again it was as though\r\nhis decision were final:\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how I could do anything for him in the House. He’s hardly\r\never spoken, and when he did he made a fool of himself.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Mary sympathetically.\r\n\r\n“He’s the only man,” went on Dolly reflectively, “whom I’ve ever seen\r\nfall right _off_ a bench in the House of Commons....”\r\n\r\n“You mean he’s physically awkward?” replied Mary in the tone of a\r\nwoman who knows how to despise such trifles--but she scented danger.\r\n“I’ve never known Dimmy betray one word that was confided to him,” she\r\ncontinued gravely.\r\n\r\n“If one were beginning all over again,” said Dolly, as though thinking\r\naloud. “But then,” he added, getting up from his chair and making as\r\nthough to walk away,--“_that’s_ impossible,--there’s Repton.”\r\n\r\nIt has been said that women are inconsequent in their conversation and\r\nthat if they desire to obtain a favour they do so by disconnected hints\r\nwhich men cannot follow. It may be so. But perhaps on this very account\r\ndo they succeed. At any rate from the moment that the Prime Minister\r\nhad let drop the phrase “there’s Repton,” Mary Smith’s plan was formed.\r\nShe did not like Sir Charles Repton, largely because he had not known\r\nher well. She had half forgotten him; she understood now that in some\r\nway he stood as an obstacle to what she desired for poor George, and\r\nfrom that moment she determined that Repton should be thrust into the\r\nHouse of Lords. All she said was:\r\n\r\n“Yes, I forgot Repton.”\r\n\r\nAnd then she went back into the crowded rooms, pushing the friend of\r\nher girlhood playfully before her with her forefinger pressed into the\r\nsmall of his back, until they reached the open door and entered the\r\nmain rooms.\r\n\r\nThe music of Mr. Arthur Worth’s band rose, a triumphant tyrant over,\r\nthe howling talk, when, during a sharp momentary and calculated pause\r\nin the tornado of violins came the loud and unexpected crash of some\r\nheavy object falling violently in the hall below. Mary Smith moved very\r\nrapidly and silently downstairs towards the sound.\r\n\r\nIt was as she expected; George Mulross had come! A little flushed and\r\nvery much annoyed, he had upset the Great Stuffed Bear which stood near\r\nthe door of the house. George was looking at the Prostrate Monster with\r\nangry defiance, and nothing but his dignity forbade him to attempt\r\nto raise it. The accident was enough to decide Mary. She dreaded the\r\nimpression Dolly might receive if the poor lad went up now and was\r\nflurried again. She went up and put her hand on his shoulder as he\r\nstood there. He jumped round and discovered her.\r\n\r\n“Oh Lord!” he said.\r\n\r\n“Dimmy,” she commanded firmly, “go out at once. A great deal depends on\r\nit. Go out at once. Don’t wait!”\r\n\r\nHe began to say something about his wife and a carriage.\r\n\r\n“_Go out at once!_” said Mary Smith.\r\n\r\nHe tried to say something about his hat and coat.\r\n\r\nSome yards before them at the open door the noise of a carriage was\r\nheard and there were servants waiting. Behind them more servants. But\r\nMary Smith knew her world.\r\n\r\nIt was a choice of evils, and George Mulross Demaine went out into\r\nthe night, hatless and coatless. The policemen were pleased to see\r\nsuch familiarity among the great. They doubted not that the gentleman\r\nwas taking the air, but they wondered why he walked so very rapidly\r\neastward through Mayfair.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile from the carriage the daughter of Theocritus C. Benson came\r\nout, not without decision, and very soon the rooms of that house were\r\nfilled and even its Moravian music dominated by the acuteness of her\r\nlaugh and the tremendous decision of her tread.\r\n\r\nWhen every one had gone, one hat and coat remained. The footman pawned\r\nthem: they were those of George Mulross Demaine.\r\n\r\nHe, poor fellow, saw in all this nothing but that eternity of bad luck\r\nto which he was born. When his wife asked him next day why he had left\r\nthe Petheringtons’ so early, he told some ordinary lie: he had left\r\nindeed because one wiser than he had told him to leave, but he could\r\nmake neither head nor tail of the whole affair: and his foot hurt him\r\nwhere the Bear had crushed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nEaster, as those who survive will know, fell early in 1915--to be\r\nexact, upon April 4th; Ole Man Benson had returned on the 11th; on the\r\n12th Mary had seen Dolly; and the week after Ole Man Benson’s return\r\nto these shores, the week after he had delivered his important and\r\nsomewhat depressing news to the young household, the week after Mary\r\nand Dolly had conferred at the Petheringtons’--was the week in which\r\nParliament met after the Recess, the third week in April.\r\n\r\nIn that week also there began to crop up here and there unexpectedly,\r\nbeautifully, like the spring flowers, short newspaper notes upon George\r\nMulross Demaine.\r\n\r\nThey were notes of where he had been, whether he had been there or\r\nnot,--at least at first they were notes of that kind. There had always\r\nbeen some such notes on him in the papers, but they seemed to be\r\ngetting numerous.\r\n\r\nThe public would hear that George Mulross loved his great poodle\r\ndog; next that the pressure of his engagements forbade him to open\r\nan Enormous Institution for the Cultivation and Study of Virulent\r\nDiseases, and in connection with this news the Institution was\r\ndescribed at great length, and the passionate regrets at the absence of\r\nGeorge Mulross Demaine sounded like a small but perceptible dirge in\r\nthe corners of the daily press.\r\n\r\nHe was attacked gently but cleverly in a paper upon his own side of\r\npolitics; short biographical notes, only a few among several score,\r\ngave details of his happy little ways. He was fond of riding, said one\r\nauthor who can have had but little intimacy with her subject; he was\r\nfond of children, said another who had even less. He had “an eye for\r\nblack game,” said a third, whose lack of intimacy included not only\r\nGeorge himself but certainly black game as well.\r\n\r\nLater came anecdotes of his goodness of heart; how he had run over a\r\nboy in the Park with his motor and had then picked him up; and how he\r\nhad good-humouredly refrained from telling people who he was in the\r\nrailway accident, and had permitted the wounded to be taken to hospital\r\nbefore he himself would accept conveyance.\r\n\r\nFinally, as the month ended, and as May brought in the London season,\r\nGeorge Mulross began to find himself uncomfortably prominent. For he\r\nvery sincerely and very heartily hated fame. He could not so much as\r\nupset a glass of wine or stumble over public stairs without hearing\r\nhis name whispered; and once when he had called at the wrong number,\r\nthe servant, recognising him from some caricature in the papers, had\r\nmentioned his own name to him with reverence, though the door was the\r\ndoor of a house whose occupants he did not know.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the tiny balance at the bank had gone. The overdraft was\r\nlarge and at any moment there might come a note which he dreaded. And\r\nMary Smith had compelled him to look for a small house in Westminster\r\nand to make every preparation for leaving Demaine House. He kicked\r\nfeebly, but she insisted: and even Sudie gave way.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t enough to keep the house dry,” Mary said. And she\r\ncompelled them both to a sense of business which Theocritus himself\r\nwould have failed to make them feel.\r\n\r\nAll this business was well advanced when Mary Smith proceeded to the\r\nnext stage of the campaign.\r\n\r\nShe carefully looked up the nature of the Court of Dowry, and when she\r\nhad learned all that she could learn from her books (it took her half a\r\nday--though she was a woman of exceptional intelligence and excellent\r\neducation) she set herself to learn all that could be learned from\r\nliving men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Court of Dowry, in its very survival and still more perhaps in the\r\nfunctions to-day attached to it, affords an admirable example of the\r\nvalue of fixed institutions in the life of a people.\r\n\r\nIt was originally instituted to try cases falling within the\r\njurisdiction of that Queen Mother of the Middle Ages to whom the poet\r\nGray so pathetically alludes in the striking lines\r\n\r\n  “She-wolf of France with unrelenting fangs\r\n  Tearing the bowels,” etc.\r\n\r\nIt had cognizance of all Escheats, Novels Tabulate and Malprisions\r\nReguardaunt in the County of Ponthieu and the Seniory of Lucq. But when\r\nactive jurisdiction over these continental territories was interrupted\r\nunder King Henry VI., there remained no function for the Court but the\r\ntrial of cases arising in or without foreign ports upon decks subject\r\nto the Crown of England.\r\n\r\nIt lingered thus into the beginning of the sixteenth century, at\r\nwhich moment it was reduced to a Clerk known as the _Mangeur_, and a\r\nWarden, each holding what were virtually sinecures (and not highly paid\r\nsinecures at that) about the Palace.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII., whom we cannot call a good but whom surely we may call a\r\ngreat man, rudely suppressed the office of Mangeur with a cruel jest\r\nat the executioner’s expense, and only permitted the Wardenship itself\r\nto survive on the strict understanding that the salary should be paid\r\nto himself. The title, however, remained, a minor distinction among\r\nthe numerous baubles of the time, and was, if I may so express it,\r\nresurrected from obscurity by the great family of Heygate at the moment\r\nof the Restoration of Charles II.\r\n\r\nIn their gladness at their recovery of a legitimate sovereign, this\r\ndominant house (now represented by the Parrells) trapped themselves in\r\nevery accoutrement of joy, and, among other posts, the Wardenship of\r\nthe Court of Dowry was voted in 1661 an annual salary of £2000, for\r\nwhich sum held by the same Act as an hereditary right, the head of the\r\nHouse of Heygate was content to license the annual holding of the Court\r\nwithin the Royal Manor and Liberties of Tooting.\r\n\r\nAt first this Court sat for one full day in each year--St. Luke’s--but\r\nlater, from 1731, this session was maintained in fiction alone. A crier\r\nin Westminster Hall, at the opening of every Hilary Term, would rapidly\r\nread out a list of three fictitious cases which went by default, claim\r\nseventeen and sixpence, and for ever after hold his peace.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century the fixed yearly salary of £2000\r\nhereditarily enjoyed by the Heygate family steadily grew, till, by\r\nthe time of the Reform Bill, it had reached the very considerable sum\r\nof £15,000, still payable to the Heygates though now all vestige of\r\nactivity in the office had disappeared.\r\n\r\nOur grandfathers, in the zeal of that somewhat iconoclastic moment,\r\nswept away the corrupt figment. The emoluments of the post were\r\nruthlessly cut down to the original £2000; its hereditary character\r\nwas, after a violent debate in the House of Lords, destroyed by a\r\nmajority of over fifty votes, determined (as were so many of the great\r\nchanges of that time!) by the voice of Eldon. The Detainer of the\r\noffice (for such was his official title) received in compensation\r\na lump sum of half a million only--not twenty years’ purchase--and\r\ncertain apparently unimportant functions were attached to the place\r\nwhich from that day forward became an appointment changing with the\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nMark here the silent virtue of organic constitutional growth, and how\r\na gentry can find it possible to create where demagogues would have\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nPoint by point and function by function, one marine interest after\r\nanother attached itself to the Court of Dowry as the beautiful\r\norganisms of the sea attach themselves to the ships that plough its\r\nwaters, until there had grown up round the Court of Dowry by the end\r\nof the nineteenth century so considerable a mass of precedent and\r\ncustom and, with the vast extension of our maritime commerce, duties so\r\nmanifold and of such moment to the nation, that the office re-emerged\r\nafter its life of six centuries, an organ of capital importance in the\r\nworkings of English Government.\r\n\r\nAs must be the case in any old and secure State, certain anomalous\r\nduties were further attached to it: the inspection of patent medicines\r\nfor instance, the giving out of contracts for buoys and rockets,\r\nand the formal stamping of licences to sell sarsaparilla. Even so\r\nthe wretched and insufficient salary of £2000 remained the sole\r\nremuneration of the Warden, though the great name of GHERKIN had raised\r\nit to be among the foremost posts of the Cabinet, and it had since\r\nseen the brilliancy, the learning and the judgment respectively of\r\na Dibley, a Powker and a Hump. By 1912 its strict control over the\r\ngreat steamship lines, its supervision of wrecks, derelicts, Hunnage,\r\nMixings, and Ports Consequent, made it second only to the Foreign\r\nOffice in the matter of public interest, and, like the Foreign Office,\r\nlargely removed from the wranglings of party.\r\n\r\nSome months later the salary was raised, amid the cheers (as I have\r\nsaid) of a united House, to £5000 a year, with a further allowance of\r\n£5000 for the expenses of entertainment and travel, which fall with\r\npeculiar severity upon this great Department; and in the hands of\r\nCharles Repton it had risen to be something even more, if that were\r\npossible, than GHERKIN had made it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo much did Mary Smith discover: partly in what she already knew,\r\npartly in her reading. The living voices of men told her further things.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that in the dingy offices which (by a lovely trait in the\r\ncharacter of politics!) house this great Department--they stand between\r\nParliament Street and New Scotland Yard--a certain Mr. Sorrel had for\r\nnow seven years exercised his marvellous and hidden powers, and while\r\nall were prepared to admit the genius of Charles Repton, those who best\r\nknew the workings of a great Government office, spoke almost as though\r\nMr. Sorrel were in himself the Court of Dowry.\r\n\r\nThe quaint customs attaching to the office of Warden, the little\r\nbells upon the shoes, the bearing of a model ship, bareheaded, upon\r\nEmpire Day (a recent innovation and one awkward only to the bald or\r\nthe blind), though to some they seemed a drawback, to others were but\r\nan additional attraction, and the ceremony of waggling in backwards\r\nupon all fours into the presence of the Sovereign at Inauguration, had\r\nbeen, with perhaps doubtful wisdom, abolished, to suit the eccentric\r\nRadicalism of GHERKIN, who refused to take office under any other\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe Accolade, or Ceremonial Stroke, however, heavily administered with\r\na beam of ebony across the back of the Warden Accept, was retained\r\nand has often afforded a subject for illustration and archæological\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nMary Smith learnt even more. She learnt that while decency forbade any\r\nsaving to be effected on the further £5000 that was an allowance for\r\nentertainment and travel, yet custom allowed it to be spent in all\r\nforms of hospitality, and that travel might include such social visits\r\nas were necessary to the occupant of so high an office. When she learnt\r\nthis she was but the more confirmed in her determination that Charles\r\nRepton who for the moment encumbered the post of Warden, should accept\r\na barony, and that quickly; for she saw the agony of Demaine House\r\nalready begun. Upon a certain morning in the mid-week of May the last\r\nstage of her beneficent action was ready.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his study on that same morning, Charles Repton, a little weary but\r\nwith all his action planned and designed, suffered again for a moment\r\nthat slight dull pain behind the ears, where Caryll’s Ganglia are: he\r\nwas dazed. He went out and sought his wife, and she was astonished to\r\nsee as he put to her some simple question on the management of the\r\nhousehold, a look of innocence in his eyes. It quickly faded. The pain\r\nalso departed, and he returned to his study.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMary Smith sent a note over to Demaine House.\r\n\r\nMary’s note found George Mulross Demaine risen after a lonely lunch and\r\nwondering, as he regularly wondered every day, what was going to turn\r\nup.\r\n\r\nHis wonderment had bewilderment in it also. Something was going to turn\r\nup he knew ... people were noticing him so. Only last evening there was\r\na savage attack upon him in the _Moon_, saying that he had torn Hares\r\nto pieces with his own reeking hands, and killed a Carted Stag with a\r\nblunt knife; while the _Capon_, with more truth, had pointed out the\r\nbeauty of the Sir Joshuas in his house, but had erroneously suggested\r\nthat they were heirlooms in his family.\r\n\r\nHe was still gazing at the May morning and gloomily considering the\r\nbuds in the formal garden, when Mary’s note was forced upon him by a\r\nhuge Dependant.\r\n\r\nA note in the firm hand of Mary Smith was always a pleasant thing to\r\nget; for a bewildered man it had something in it of salvation.\r\n\r\nGeorge Mulross went in a mood lighter than any he had known for many\r\nweeks, towards his cousin’s house. He found her, of course, alone.\r\n\r\n“Dimmy,” she said, lifting his hand gently from the chimneypiece\r\nwhere he was moving it aimlessly among several breakable and valuable\r\nthings,--“Dimmy, when did you last ask a question in the House?”\r\n\r\nHe looked frightened, and said:\r\n\r\n“Oh! ages ago.”\r\n\r\n“Now look here, Dimmy,” she said smoothly, “I want you to go and ask\r\nthis to-day,”--and she handed him a bit of paper.\r\n\r\n“Have you got any money in it?” he asked innocently.\r\n\r\n“No, certainly not,” she answered. “You silly ass! What could that have\r\nto do with it? Read it.”\r\n\r\nHe read: “_Mr. G. M. Demaine: to ask the Prime Minister whether his\r\nattention has been called to the fact that the Van Huren Company is not\r\nregistered in London as the law provides, and what steps he proposes to\r\ntake in view of this evasion of a public safeguard?_”\r\n\r\n“What on earth have I to do with that?” he asked, looking up at her, a\r\nlittle put out and evidently unwilling to take any risks. “What is it\r\nanyhow?”\r\n\r\n“Now look here, Dimmy,” she said, “do be a good fellow: it’s all for\r\nyour good.”\r\n\r\n“Well anyhow,” he said, “I can’t get an answer for two days.”\r\n\r\n“Yes you can,” she said, “I’ve sent Dolly a little note typewritten,\r\nand signed it in your name; and you can call it a ‘matter of which you\r\nhave given him private notice.’”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you have!” said Demaine, almost moved to energy.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have,” said Mary Smith firmly. “There are a hundred and eight\r\nquestions to-day; it’s half-past three and you’ve time to get down to\r\nthe House comfortably. I’ll take you there.”\r\n\r\nShe did: and amid the general indifference of most members in a crowded\r\nHouse, the amusement of perhaps a couple of dozen, and the red-hot\r\nsilent rage of at least two, G. M. Demaine in a half-audible voice,\r\nmumbled his query.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister received more than a murmur of applause when he\r\nanswered in his clear and rather high voice that in a matter of such\r\nimportance and in a moment such as this, it was not to the interest of\r\nthe country to give a public reply.\r\n\r\nIf there was one thing George Mulross Demaine dreaded more than another\r\nit was to be questioned, and still more to be congratulated, upon\r\nthings he did not understand. Luckily for him a scene of some violence\r\nconnected with the religious differences of the Scotch, prevented the\r\nimmediate opening of the debate at the end of Questions, and he had the\r\nopportunity to slip away. But to his terror he found the motor waiting\r\nfor him and Mary Smith beckoning him from within; like the fascinated\r\nbird of the legend he was captured. He hoped that she would drive him\r\nto some more congenial air. But no, she produced, from a large and\r\nbusiness-like wallet which she only carried in her most imperious\r\nmoments, two questions to be set down for the day after the morrow.\r\n\r\nHe took them with a groan and yielded as yield he must to her command\r\nthat he should set them down. They were of no importance, the one was\r\nto his uncle by a second marriage, the First Civil Lord, to ask him the\r\nname of a Company that had proved less able than was expected in the\r\nmanufacture of armour plates; the other to his cousin the Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer asking if the action of some obscure servant of\r\nthe Treasury in a peaceful Buckinghamshire village had received the\r\nattention which his recent services seemed to require.\r\n\r\nThe day and hour came round. George Mulross in a voice perhaps a little\r\nmore assured than that of two days before, said when his turn came:\r\n“Twenty-nine.”\r\n\r\nTo his surprise the Chancellor of the Exchequer answered with some\r\ntartness that he had nothing whatever to add to his predecessor’s\r\nanswer of July 9th ten years before, and added amid general approval,\r\nthat insinuations such as were those contained in the question were\r\ngreatly to be deplored.\r\n\r\nA man of excitable temperament had already leapt to his feet to ask a\r\nsupplementary question when he was sharply checked by the Chair and the\r\ncurious incident closed.\r\n\r\nSome ten minutes passed and once again, sweating with fear, Demaine\r\nheard his name called out and said in a voice still audible:\r\n“Fifty-four.--I mean Forty-five.”\r\n\r\nThe First Lord of the Admiralty rose solemnly in all the dignity of\r\nhis great white beard, adjusted his spectacles, looked fully at the\r\nintruder upon his peace, and said with his unmistakable accent, that\r\nthe name of the Company could be dithcovered through the ordinary\r\nthourceth of information.\r\n\r\nSo the game continued for ten days. In vain did his friends assure him\r\nthat he was losing position in the House by this perpetual pose of\r\nthe puritan and the sleuth hound. Mary Smith was a woman who must be\r\nobeyed, and of twenty-three questions which she put into his unwilling\r\nlips at least one had gone home. And the First Lord of the Admiralty\r\nin the same dignity of the same white beard and with the same striking\r\naccent, had admitted the nethethity of thtriking from the litht of\r\ncontractorth the name of the firm of which, until that moment, the\r\nunhappy George Mulross had never even heard.\r\n\r\nHe knew, he felt, that he, the most blameless of men, was making\r\nenemies upon every side. The allusions to his public spirit which were\r\nnow occasionally to be discovered in the Opposition papers, the little\r\nbitter sentences in those which were upon the contrary subsidised by\r\nhis own party, filled him with an equal dread.\r\n\r\nHe was in no mood for going further, when upon the top of all this Mary\r\nSmith quietly insisted that he must make a speech.\r\n\r\nIt need not be long: she would write it out for him herself. He must\r\nlearn it absolutely by heart and must take the greatest care to\r\npronounce the words accurately. She chose a debate in which he could\r\ntalk more or less at large and put before him as gentle, as well\r\nreasoned, as terse and as broad-minded a piece of wisdom as the House\r\nmight have listened to for many months.\r\n\r\nMorning and afternoon, a patient governess, Mary Smith heard him recite\r\nthat speech; but as day succeeded day she slowly determined that it\r\nwouldn’t do. One slip might be his ruin. Upon the tenth rehearsal he\r\nstill said “very precious” for “meretricious.” He was still unable\r\nto restrain a sharp forward movement at the words “I will go a step\r\nfurther”; and he could never get in its right order the simple phrase:\r\n“I yield to no one in my admiration for the right honourable gentleman.”\r\n\r\nFirst he would yield to a right honourable gentleman; then no one would\r\nyield to him; then he would yield to no admiration, and at last she\r\ngave it up in despair.\r\n\r\nA woman of less tenacity would have abandoned her design; not so Mary\r\nSmith. She discovered with careful art that there was no reason why a\r\nWarden of the Court of Dowry should speak in the House at all; he might\r\nhold his post for three years and do no more than answer questions,\r\nleaving to a subordinate the duty of speaking upon those very rare\r\npublic Bills, which, however distantly, concerned his office.\r\n\r\nShe had already made him a name; she was determined not to destroy it\r\nby following up this false scent of training him to public speaking. At\r\nlast, as the month of May was drawing to a close, she determined to put\r\nhim upon the rails.\r\n\r\nDolly and she were agreed. Perhaps Dimmy would need to be persuaded;\r\nhe was naturally modest, and what was more he would very certainly be\r\nafraid, but still more certainly he wanted money most abominably.\r\n\r\nWhen the day came for him to receive his great illumination she called\r\nhim to her once more, and once more he found her alone. She lunched\r\nhim first, and gave him a wine of which she knew he could drink in\r\nmoderation, for she felt he would need courage; she let him drink his\r\ncoffee, she lit her own tiny cigar, and at last she said:\r\n\r\n“Dimmy, what does it take you to live?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Dimmy with some terror in his eyes.\r\n\r\nMary Smith looked at him a little quizzically. He did not like those\r\nlooks though he was fond of her. It made him feel like an animal.\r\n\r\n“Dimmy,” she said, “could you and Sudie manage it on seven thousand a\r\nyear, or say on six thousand?”\r\n\r\nDimmy thought long and painfully. For him there were but two scales of\r\nincome, the poor and the rich. In the days when it was such a bore to\r\nraise a sovereign, he was poor. For nearly two years with an unlimited\r\ncapital behind him, and about twenty thousand a year for his wife to\r\nspend, he had considered himself positively and fixedly among the\r\nrich. He had felt comfortable: he had had elbow room. Six thousand\r\npounds puzzled him: it was neither one thing nor the other. A brilliant\r\nthought struck him.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me, Mary,” he said gently, “some one who has got about\r\nsix thousand? I think I could judge _then_.”\r\n\r\n“I can tell you one positively,” said Mary Smith. “Charlie Fitzgerald\r\nand his wife. Till the old Yid dies they’ve got six thousand exactly.\r\nI ought to know, considering that I went over every scrap of paper in\r\norder to make sure of Charlie repaying me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Demaine judicially. “Charlie Fitzgerald and his wife....” He\r\nthought for a long time. “Well, they’re pretty comfortable,” he said\r\nsuddenly. “Of course they haven’t got a place and grounds; I suppose if\r\nthey had a place and grounds they couldn’t do it.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mary, “but the house in Westminster is very large when\r\nyou get inside through the narrow part. When are you going into\r\nWestminster, Dimmy?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Dimmy hopelessly. “Sudie’s got all muddled about\r\nit. She saw ‘City of Westminster’ stuck up on one of those khaki\r\nDreadnought hats that the street sweepers wear, an’ the man was getting\r\nhorrors into a cart right up by our house, an’ she said that where we\r\n_were_ was Westminster anyhow. And then when I argued with her she\r\nshoved me to the window and pointed out his hat. She was quite rough.”\r\nAnd George Mulross sighed.\r\n\r\nMary Smith got testy. “Don’t talk rubbish,” she said, “and don’t bother\r\nme about your wife. Have you looked at anything in Westminster at all?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Demaine humbly.\r\n\r\n“You must know,” said Mary sharply, and with a strong inclination to\r\nslap him. “Have you looked in Dean’s Yard, for instance?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Demaine, slowly reviewing his perambulations of the last\r\nfew days. “Yes, I’ve looked at Dean’s Yard. There’s nothing there....\r\nAll the rest seems to be so slummy, Mary.”\r\n\r\n“There are some exceedingly good new houses,” said Mary severely, “and\r\neverybody’s going there; and the old houses are perfectly delicious.\r\nAnyhow, Westminster’s the place; and I’ll tell you something else.\r\nYou’ve got to take office!”\r\n\r\nGeorge Mulross, worried as he always was when she began drilling him,\r\non hearing the word “office” said simply:\r\n\r\n“Well I won’t, that’s flat. I don’t believe in it. I’ve seen lots of\r\nmen do that kind of thing. They get to the City and they think they’re\r\nlearning business, and they’re rooked before....”\r\n\r\n“I said ‘TAKE office’!” shouted Mary Smith, “TAKE office--get a\r\npost.... Dolly will give you a post. Now do you understand?”\r\n\r\n“What?” said Demaine vaguely.\r\n\r\n“Dimmy,” she said more quietly but with great firmness, “look at me.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her. It was a muscular strain upon his eyes to keep them\r\nfixed under her superior will.\r\n\r\n“That’s right.... Now listen carefully. The salary of the Wardenship of\r\nthe Court of Dowry is five thousand a year--and ex’s.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Demaine.\r\n\r\n“When the Wardenship of the Court of Dowry is vacant--if you play up\r\nworth tuppence, it’s yours for the asking. Do ... you ... understand?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” repeated George Demaine.\r\n\r\nIt was as though he had been told that he had been asleep all these\r\nyears, that his real name was Jones and that he lived in Australia, or\r\nas though he had discovered himself to be covered with feathers. He was\r\nutterly at sea. Then he said slowly:\r\n\r\n“Repton’s Warden of the Court of Dowry.” He was proud of knowing this,\r\nfor he often blundered about the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n“Will you or will you not fix your mind upon what I have said?” said\r\nMary Smith.\r\n\r\nThe full absurdity of it grew increasingly upon Demaine’s imagination.\r\n“The House would think Dolly was mad,” he remarked with really\r\nbeautiful humility.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” said Mary Smith in disgust, “the House will know nothing\r\nabout it one way or the other. The House doesn’t meddle with\r\ngovernment--thank God! You’re popular enough I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” said Demaine.\r\n\r\n“And you never speak, do you?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Demaine, “only once three years ago, the time I fell down,\r\nyou know; an’ that was quite short.”\r\n\r\n“How many people do you know in the House?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Demaine.\r\n\r\n“Oh NONSENSE!... I mean how many people would write to you for\r\ninstance, and congratulate you?”\r\n\r\nDemaine gave it up. But one could see from his demeanour what she had\r\nguessed from her own study of the debates and from her great knowledge\r\nof London: a month ago people just knew that Demaine was in the House\r\nand that was about all. They knew him now as a man whose name they had\r\nseen fifty times and who asked questions. A better candidature could\r\nnot be conceived, and his close family connection with so many men on\r\nboth front benches would render the appointment reasonable in all eyes.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of things were lumbering against each other in George\r\nMulross’ brain. He wondered whether one had to know anything, or what\r\none had to do, and how the money was paid; and whether income tax was\r\ndeducted at source; and how long the Government would stay in. Then the\r\nabsurdity of it recurred to him.\r\n\r\n“Of course there was Pitson,” he murmured, “and everybody laughed and\r\nsaid he was a half-wit,--but he was in with everybody, although he was\r\na half-wit.”\r\n\r\n“So are you,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I don’t laugh and go about as he did.”\r\n\r\n“It’s against a man to laugh much,” said Mary, “and really, if it comes\r\nto going about, even a dog can do that. You’ve only got to go and sniff\r\nround people.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation could not profitably be continued. Demaine had been\r\nintroduced to the idea, and that was all Mary desired to do.\r\n\r\nShe sent him home and invited herself that weekend to a house in which\r\nshe would find Dolly: the Kahns’--but no matter. Dolly was there.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prime Minister saw that dear figure of hers with its promise\r\nof importunities he groaned in spirit. She brought him up to the\r\nsticking point during a long walk on Sunday afternoon, and he promised\r\nher that at least he would sound.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t know, Mary,” he said, half trying to retreat, “Repton’s\r\nnot a man to speak unless he chooses, and he’s like a stone wall\r\nagainst one unless he also chooses to hear.”\r\n\r\n“Take him walking as I’m taking you,” said Mary.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday, the 31st of May. The weather had begun to be large and\r\nopen and warm. He thought there was something in what she said.\r\n\r\n“Meet him as he comes out of his house to-morrow. Do you know when he\r\ncomes out?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Prime Minister a little shamefacedly, “I do. It’s\r\nalways half-past nine.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mary, “I really don’t see what your trouble is.”\r\n\r\n“It’s an absurd hour to catch a man, half-past nine--and I should have\r\nto get up God knows when--besides to-morrow’s a bad day,” said the\r\nPremier, pressing his lips together when he had spoken. “It’s a bad\r\nmoment. It’s a big week for him. He’s got a dinner on that’s something\r\nto do with his dam companies to-morrow evening. I know that. And\r\nthen Tuesday he’s got that big Van Diemens meeting in the City. And\r\nbefore the end of the week, I know he’s talking at the big Wycliffite\r\nConference--I can’t remember the day though. Pottle told me about it.”\r\n\r\nThey had turned to go home, and Mary Smith for the first hundred yards\r\nor so was honestly wondering in her mind why men found so difficult\r\nwhat women find so easy.\r\n\r\n“I’ve told you what to do,” she said. “Catch him by accident outside\r\nhis house as he leaves after breakfast, then he’ll walk with you. Say\r\nyou’re walking. Anything can be said when one’s walking.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure he’ll come with me?” asked the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n“Positive!” said Mary Smith in a very quiet tone.\r\n\r\nThe air was serene above them, and one lark had found his way so high\r\nthat they could hardly hear him singing. The Prime Minister wished from\r\nthe bottom of his heart that he could live in that field for a week. He\r\nrose to one despairing rally:\r\n\r\n“Mary,” he said, “suppose it rains?”\r\n\r\n“Oh Dolly, Dolly, Dolly!” she answered, stopping short and standing in\r\nfront of him. “It’s for all the world as though you were just back from\r\nschool for the last time, and I was a little girl who had been sent for\r\non the grand occasion to tea.”\r\n\r\nShe put both hands on his awkward shoulders to stop him, and she kissed\r\nhim anywhere upon the face.\r\n\r\n“It won’t rain, Dolly,” she said, “I’ve seen to that.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Repton had taken no weekends. Charles Repton had sat tight in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe end of that May did not tempt him to move; he was right on to his\r\nbusiness, and never had his silent life been more silent or Maria, Lady\r\nRepton, felt more alone, though she did as she was bid and remained\r\nimmovable in her London house, only seeing, when the leisure was\r\nafforded her, her few dear friends (none conspicuous), and once or\r\ntwice presiding at a great dinner of her husband’s.\r\n\r\nBeyond all his other concerns one chief concern was resolving itself in\r\nCharles Repton’s head. He was wondering exactly where he stood between\r\ncommerce and politics.\r\n\r\nThese moments, not of doubt but of a necessity for decision, are the\r\ntests of interior power. Some half-dozen such moments had marked the\r\ncareer of his strict soul: one when he had determined to risk the\r\ntransition from his native town to Newcastle carefully calculating the\r\ncapital of clients and how much could be successfully lent in that\r\ncentre: another, when he had risked the expense of his first election:\r\na third when he had decided to take office--and there were others.\r\n\r\nNow as May drew to its close, as the discussion on the Budget was\r\nin full swing and as the eager public notice of Van Diemens was on\r\nthe point of filling the press, he was in some balance as to whether\r\nthe precise proportion of activity which he gave to the House of\r\nCommons--it was a large proportion--might not be absorbing just too\r\nmuch of his energy.\r\n\r\nHe calculated most exactly--as a man calculates a measurable thing, an\r\nacreage, or a weight of metal--what the future proportions should be.\r\n\r\nHe must remain in touch with everything that passed at Westminster; on\r\nthat he was fixed. But he knew that there was a growing criticism of\r\nhis combination of high political idealism with affairs in the City.\r\nThe _Moon_ had said one exceedingly unpleasant thing about the Oil\r\nConcession in Burmah--it was only a newspaper but he had had to settle\r\nit. The _Capon_ was paying a little more attention than he liked to his\r\nposition in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nHe thought hard, and under the process of his thought his mind somewhat\r\ncleared. But he had come to no decision when, late in the night of\r\nSunday, the 31st of May, he marshalled the papers upon his desk,\r\ndeliberately turned his mind off the problems that had been engaging\r\nhim, and drew up a list of his next engagements.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Monday the 1st of June, after leaving his house\r\npunctually at half-past nine, he was to give half the morning to the\r\nWardenship. He was to return home at noon. From noon to lunch he must\r\nsee to his accounts. It was doubly important, for it was a Monday and\r\nit was the first of the month. He would lunch: preferably alone, for he\r\nwould be tired, and he would give Maria to understand that he must be\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 2nd, was the speech to the General Meeting of Van\r\nDiemens. He glanced at his notes for that speech; they were all in\r\nexcellent sequence, and he felt, so far as men of that stern temper can\r\nfeel it, a little touch of pride when he noted the procession of the\r\nargument. He saw in his mind’s eye first the conviction and then the\r\nenthusiasm of the men whom he must convince: the vivid portrayal of the\r\nEmpire’s need of the railway: the ease of building it,--the delivery of\r\nthe great metaphor wherein he compared that thin new line of iron to\r\nthe electrical connection which turns potential and useless electrical\r\nenergy into actual and working force.\r\n\r\nHe re-read the phrase in which he called it “completing the circuit”;\r\nhe did not doubt at all that the meeting would follow him. Sentence\r\nafter sentence passed before his memory (for he had carefully learned\r\nthe peroration by heart); the name of Nelson shone in one of them, the\r\nname of Rhodes in another, of Joel in a third, till the great oration\r\nclosed with a vision, brief, succinct (but how vivid!) of the Gate of\r\nthe East and of England’s hand upon it, holding\r\n\r\n        “... the keys\r\n  Of such teeming destinies”\r\n\r\nthrough them: through them!\r\n\r\nIt was a great speech.\r\n\r\nHe turned more carelessly to the already typewritten stuff which he\r\nmust deliver upon the Thursday to the Wycliffite Conference. It would\r\ndo--and it was of importance for the moment. It reminded him a little\r\ncontemptuously of the High Meat Teas in the North of England and of\r\nhis youth, and of that maundering war between Church and Chapel which\r\nwas then of real moment to him, and which now he still had wearily to\r\nwage,--at least in public.\r\n\r\nWhether this little bout of study had been too much for a man who had\r\nalready spent a full month glued to his work, or whatever else was the\r\ncause, he felt as midnight approached a trifle brain-sick. He leant his\r\nhead upon his hand, and it seemed to him--he hoped it was an illusion\r\nfor the sensation was yet vague--but it _did_ seem to him that the pain\r\nbehind the ears, or at least an oppression there, was beginning. He\r\nmuttered an exclamation so sharp as would have astonished those who had\r\nnever seen him under a strain. Then he went quickly upstairs to the\r\ndrawing-room and found his wife, sitting all alone with her book.\r\n\r\nShe looked up as he entered, and again she was startled by that strange\r\ninnocence in his eyes. Odd, (but what living!) flashes of thirty, of\r\nforty years ago pierced her heart. Youth goes down every lane, and\r\nthese two, just after their marriage, just before the first loan he had\r\nmade, had been, for a month or so, young: the memory of it was a jewel\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nHe came in at that instant loosened: he was walking ill: he made\r\ntowards her as though he were seeking a refuge, and still that\r\npersistent innocence shone from his eyes. He sat down beside her,\r\nbreathing uncertainly, groped out and took her hand. He had made no\r\nsuch movement since--what year? Since before what first hardening had\r\nfrightened her? How many years, how long a life ago?\r\n\r\nThe mood was of no long duration. She could have wished it had been\r\nlonger. He slept with a sort of deep lethargy that was not his way, and\r\ntwice in the night she rose to watch him; but with the morning all his\r\npowers and, alas! all that difference had returned.\r\n\r\nShe was to see nothing of him while he went through every detail of his\r\naffairs for the week and the month with his assistant; she was not even\r\nto be allowed to see something of him at his midday meal; she watched\r\nhim as he went out of the house at the invariable hour to drive to the\r\noffice of the Court of Dowry. And as she watched him with new feelings\r\nin her, and the breaking of dead crusts, she saw another man accost\r\nhim, the cab turned away, and the two go together, walking, towards\r\nthe Park. She knew the figure though she came so little into the life\r\nof London, and she recognised, in the sloppy clothes and the stooping\r\nwalk, the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf you are a member of the governing classes of this great Empire it is\r\nnot an easy thing to approach a house between the Edgware Road and Hyde\r\nPark from the North, at half-past nine in the morning it is supremely\r\ndifficult if you are making for Westminster.\r\n\r\nIt presupposes being carted at an impossible hour to some place in the\r\nNorth West, and there let loose and making a run for home. And why\r\nshould any man of position be carted to any place in the North West at\r\ndawn? On the whole the best excuse is Paddington Station. Eton is a\r\ngood place to come from, for the liar comes in at Paddington. It was\r\nfrom Eton, therefore, that the Prime Minister came that morning ...\r\nanyhow he was N.W. of the Park before nine. He walked slowly towards\r\nthe Marble Arch. As he approached Charles Repton’s house he walked\r\nsomewhat more slowly, but he had timed himself well.\r\n\r\nThe tall straight figure came out and hailed a cab.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister crossed before him, turned round in amiable\r\nsurprise, and said: “My _dear_ Repton!”\r\n\r\nAnd Repton greeted, with somewhat less effusion, the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n“I was walking from Paddington,” said the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n“Have you eaten?” said Sir Charles, as he paid the cabman a shilling\r\nfor nothing.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I breakfasted before I started. I was walking down to\r\nWestminster. Can’t you come with me?”\r\n\r\nSir Charles found it perfectly easy, and the two men walked through the\r\nPark together towards Hyde Park Corner and Constitution Hill.\r\n\r\nTo most men the difficulty of the transition from daily converse to\r\nimportant transactions is so difficult that they will postpone it\r\nto the very end of an interview. The Prime Minister was not of that\r\nkind. They had not got two hundred yards beyond that large arena near\r\nthe Marble Arch wherein every Sunday the Saxon folk thresh out and\r\ndetermine for ever the antinomy of predestination and free will--not\r\nto mention other mysteries of the Christian religion,--when the Prime\r\nMinister had reminded Charles Repton of the absolute necessity of a new\r\nman on the Government bench in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nCharles Repton heartily agreed, and for ten minutes gave his reasons.\r\nHe hoped, he said in an iron sort of way, that he was talking sense,\r\nand that he was not meddling with things not his business. He was\r\nwarmly encouraged to go on, and he minutely described the kind of\r\nman whom he thought was wanted. They had too many business men as it\r\nwas, and there were too many men fresh from the House of Commons. The\r\nGovernment forces in the Upper House had come to be a sort of clique,\r\nhalf of them very intelligent, but now and then, especially in big\r\ndebates, out of touch with their colleagues. Could not some man of real\r\nposition, a man with a long established title, wealthy and thoroughly\r\nwell known if only in a small world for some proficiency of his, be got\r\nto take an interest in the Government programme? A man like Pulborough,\r\nfor instance? If Pulborough had had to earn his living he would have\r\nbeen the best bantam breeder alive. And then, look at his talents, why,\r\nhe designed all the new work at Harberry himself, etc. And so forth.\r\n\r\nAs they were crossing by the Wellington statue, the Prime Minister, in\r\nthe uneasy intervals of dodging the petrol traffic, explained that that\r\nwas not in his mind. He must have some one who had heard everything\r\nin the Cabinet for the last two years. “Repton,” he said ... (as they\r\nleft the refuge pavement--a taxi-cab all but killed him).... “Repton,\r\nwould you, have you thought of ....” Two gigantic motor-buses swerved\r\ntogether and the politicians were separated. The Prime Minister saw the\r\nWarden far ahead, a successful man, whole upon the further shore. The\r\nPrime Minister leapt in front of a bicycle, caught the kerb and ended\r\nhis sentence “... a peerage yourself?”\r\n\r\nThey had come through all the perils of that space and were walking\r\nquietly down Constitution Hill; Dolly could develop his thought more\r\nfreely, and in the most natural way in the world he put it that they\r\ncould not do without Charles Repton.\r\n\r\nHe was very careful not to force the position. Charles Repton was\r\nabsolutely essential: they must have him or they must have nobody.\r\n\r\nAn Egyptian smile, a smile of granite, could be guessed rather than\r\nseen upon Charles Repton’s firm lips.\r\n\r\n“Would you propose that I should be Master of the Horse?” he said.\r\n\r\n“No,” said the Prime Minister, smiling very much more easily, “nor\r\nManager of the King’s Thoroughbred Stud, either. But I know that\r\nAbenford is mortally tired of the Household; though what there is to be\r\ntired of,” he added....\r\n\r\nTo the Prime Minister’s very great surprise, Charles Repton simply\r\nreplied: “If I went to the Lords, I should go without office.”\r\n\r\nAt this unexpected solution the Prime Minister was in duty bound to\r\npropose a hundred reasons against it. He implored Repton to remember\r\nhis great position and the peculiar value that he had for him, the\r\nPrime Minister. “It’s never more than three men that do the work,\r\nRepton, whether you’re dealing with ten in committee or half a\r\nthousand. You know that.”\r\n\r\nBut Charles Repton was firm. These solid masters of finance are glad\r\nto think out their world; in a sense nothing comes to them that is\r\nunexpected when it comes. Their brains may be compared to the great\r\nnew War Office in Whitehall, where a hundred minutely detailed plans\r\nfor the invasion of Germany, France, Russia, Spain, Italy and the\r\nBaltic States, lie pigeonholed, in perfect order, ready to be put\r\ninto immediate execution at the pronouncement of the stern words\r\n_Krieg-mobil_.\r\n\r\nLong before the simple intrigues of the drawing-rooms had taken shape,\r\nCharles Repton had swept the whole landscape with his inward eye. He\r\nknew every fold of the terrain, he had measured every range. He had\r\ndetermined that, upon the whole, a peerage was worth his while: now; at\r\nthe very height of his fortune.\r\n\r\nTo have a permanent place, free from office, with the prestige\r\nof title, with committees open to him and every official source\r\npermanently to his hand, was worth his while. It was worth his while\r\nto go to the House of Lords had it been a matter for his free choice;\r\nand if he went to the House of Lords he must go a free man. It would do\r\nmore to save Van Diemens than any other step, and that great Company\r\nwas worth twenty places in the Cabinet. Van Diemens was the master of\r\nthis Cabinet and the last.\r\n\r\nHe had made up his mind then that a peerage was worth his while even\r\nif it depended entirely on his choice. Now that he could make it a\r\nfavour, it was doubly worth his while. The alternative meant useless\r\nfriction.... Yes, he would take that peerage: but there was one thing\r\nthat he must have quite clear:----\r\n\r\nThe two men walked together in silence past the Palace; they went\r\nthrough the superb new entrance to St. James’s Park, crossed the\r\nbridge, and turned towards Westminster.\r\n\r\nIt had been a shock. The relief for the Prime Minister was somewhat too\r\ngreat, and the last thing that Repton had to say was awkward; but he\r\nwas accustomed to leap such hedges. He began boldly:\r\n\r\n“Do you happen to know what I have set aside for the regular purposes\r\nof the Party?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister shook his head. If there was one thing he detested,\r\nit was the kitchen side of politics.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll tell you,” said Repton. “I’ve put exactly the same sum\r\naside every year for fifteen years, whether we’ve been in office or out\r\nof it. Not a large sum, only five hundred pounds. Pottle will tell you.”\r\n\r\nThe Premier made such a movement with his head as showed that he did\r\nnot care.\r\n\r\n“Only five hundred pounds but exactly five hundred pounds,” continued\r\nRepton firmly. “Now Pottle must understand quite clearly that that\r\nsubscription will neither be increased nor diminished.” He spoke as men\r\nspeak in a shop, and in a shop of which they have the whip hand.\r\n\r\n“That’s between you and Pottle,” said the Prime Minister in the tone of\r\none who doesn’t want to go on with the subject.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Repton, looking straight in front of him, “it _has_ got to\r\nbe understood quite clearly. I’ve made it a standing order. Pottle’s\r\nnever pestered me, but he _can_ pester like the deuce.... And I’ve\r\nabsolutely made up my mind.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course,” said the Prime Minister. “I think it’s wise,”\r\nhe went on,--“It isn’t my business, but I do think it wise to keep in\r\ntouch with the Central Office. But it’s between you and Pottle.”\r\n\r\nThere was another long silence as they went down Great George Street.\r\n\r\n“That’s all,” said Repton, opposite the Pugin fountain. The two men\r\nwalked on. The statues of great men long dead looked down upon them;\r\nthose statues were unused to such conversations. One of the statues\r\nmust have thought Charles Repton a tactless fellow, but Charles\r\nRepton had calculated everything, even to his chances of life and to\r\nthe number of active years that probably lay before him. And nothing\r\nwould have more offended or disturbed him than any ambiguity upon the\r\nbusiness side of the transaction.\r\n\r\nThey parted, one for the Court of Dowry, the other for Downing Street,\r\nand the affair was settled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the Prime Minister asked Demaine to come and have a\r\ncup of tea. He said he would rather it was in his own room; he took\r\nDemaine’s arm and led him round.\r\n\r\n“Have you anything on to-night, Dimmy?” he said.\r\n\r\nDimmy thought. “I don’t know,” he answered after a long examination of\r\npossible engagements.\r\n\r\n“Well, you’ve got to be here for the division anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” said Dimmy. His high record of divisions was the sheet anchor\r\nof his soul: he had sat up all night sixteen times.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Prime Minister hesitating, as though after all he\r\ndidn’t want to drink a cup of tea, “you might see me then ... no, come\r\nalong now.”\r\n\r\nAnd as they drank their tea he told his companion that there was to be\r\na change in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said, “I want to leave you perfectly free.” He seemed to be\r\nsuffering a little as he said it, but he went on tenaciously: “I want\r\nto leave you perfectly free; ... but of course you know your name has\r\nbeen put before me?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” began Demaine.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister stopped him with his hand. “Well, anyhow it _has_.”\r\nHe paused and thought. “I can’t tell how it would suit you, but I think\r\nI can tell how you would suit it. Now on _that_ point I’m satisfied,\r\nDimmy. You know the kind of work it is?”\r\n\r\nBut Demaine didn’t know.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Prime Minister, leaning back easily and joining his\r\nhands, “it’s like all those things: you’ve got your staff ... in one\r\nway the work’s cut and dried. It’s very varied work. No man can be\r\nexpected to grasp it all round. But,” (leaning forward) “like all these\r\nthings, it wants a sort of general point of view, you understand me?”\r\n\r\nDimmy did not dare to shake his head.\r\n\r\n“It wants a sort of ...” the Prime Minister swept his hand over the\r\ntable--“a sort of what I may call a--well, a--a _common sense_,\r\nespecially about sudden things. You have to decide sometimes.... But\r\nyou’ll soon get into it,” he added in a tone of relief. “You’ll have\r\nSorrel with you all the first few days; he’s exceedingly easy to get on\r\nwith; he’s been there for years--that is, of course, if you take it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Demaine in a whirl, “yes, if I take it I shall have Sorrel.”\r\n\r\n“Then of course,” went on the Prime Minister rapidly, “it’s the kind\r\nof place which you can make anything of. It can count enormously; it\r\ncounted enormously under Gherkin until he died. And Repton of course\r\nhas made quite a splash in it.”\r\n\r\nDemaine shuddered slightly.\r\n\r\n“But there’s no necessity,” continued the other quickly, “it’s really\r\nbetter without a splash. It’s a plodding sort of attention that’s\r\nwanted,” he ended wearily; then with an afterthought he added: “Why\r\nnot go to Sorrel now?”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t you give me a note?” asked Demaine nervously.\r\n\r\n“Oh nonsense,” answered his cousin, upon whom the strain was beginning\r\nto tell. “Just go up and see him in his office. He’s the mildest of\r\nmen.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Demaine sighing. He finished his tea and went\r\nout,--and as he left the Prime Minister called after him: “Don’t forget\r\nto find me after the division to-night. Then I can tell you if anything\r\nis settled.”\r\n\r\nDemaine walked undeterminedly towards the Dowry Offices behind Scotland\r\nYard; his heart failed him; he did not go in. He stood aimlessly in\r\nWhitehall, staring at the traffic; his knees were not quite straight\r\nand his mouth was half open.\r\n\r\nPast him, as he so stood, strode, full of vigour and of will, the\r\nfixed form of Sir Charles Repton, walking towards Trafalgar Square.\r\nThe younger man followed him with his eyes and felt in his heart what\r\na gulf there was between them. He was by no means of those who dare,\r\nand the thought of office appalled him. Then suddenly he remembered the\r\nsalary. His legs straightened beneath him and he forced himself up the\r\nstairs to where he might ask to see Mr. Sorrel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Charles Repton strode up Whitehall. His day’s work had been heavy,\r\nin the hours since that morning conversation, and he was suffering.\r\n\r\nIt was no spiritual suffering which affected that strong character:\r\nhis life was fixed; the decision he had taken was final. Nay, every\r\ncircumstance surrounding that decision delighted him. The peerage had\r\nbeen offered at precisely the right moment; he himself could have\r\nchosen no better. It was the moment when he particularly desired to\r\nbe at once more powerful, if that could be, and yet free; more fixed\r\nin his political tenure, yet more at large to catch the hand of\r\nopportunity. For all his strategy was centred upon the Company which he\r\nwas determined to save.\r\n\r\nThat from which he now suffered was physical; he suffered that pain at\r\nthe back of the head: it had a novel intensity about it; it was not\r\nexactly a headache, it was a sort of weight, an oppression, and as he\r\nwent on northward the pressure got worse and more concentrated just\r\nbehind either ear.\r\n\r\nHe would not relax his pace. He saw a taxi which had just discharged\r\na fare at Cox’s Bank; in spite of the trouble in his head which was\r\nrapidly increasing, he was clear enough to note that the little flag\r\nwas up, that the man was free and was about to go away. He signalled to\r\nhim and got in, and gave the address of his house, bidding him call at\r\nthe Club on his way.\r\n\r\nHe remembered, though the bother was getting worse, that there was a\r\nbig dinner that evening; he tried to remember the names, then quite\r\nsuddenly a stab of pain behind the right ear almost made him cry out.\r\nBut Repton was indomitable and he stifled the cry. Hardly had he so\r\nconquered himself when he felt another similar violent agony behind\r\nthe left ear: a man less master of himself would have fainted. It was\r\nover in a moment, but he was white and actually uncertain of his steps\r\nwhen he got out at the Club and went up to the porter’s box to ask for\r\nletters and messages. There were none.\r\n\r\n“Are you certain there are none?” he asked in a weak voice.\r\n\r\nThat query was so unusual from the man that the porter looked up\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\n“Don’t look at me as though I was stuffed,” said Sir Charles sharply,\r\n“don’t you know what your place is worth?”\r\n\r\nThe man grumbled a little.\r\n\r\nWith the most unworthy ferocity, but perhaps the pain must excuse him,\r\nSir Charles bent his head in to the little window in the glass and\r\nhissed: “This kind of thing has happened before. Just you bally well\r\nsort the papers in front of you and make sure.”\r\n\r\nHis hands were trembling with constricted rage the porter ran through\r\nthe bundle, and found a card.\r\n\r\n“What did I tell you, you b----y snipe!” darted the now uncontrollable\r\nBaronet. Then recovering himself he said with no shame but in a little\r\nconfusion: “I’ve had enough of this.” He looked at the card: it was an\r\nadvertisement inviting him to spend a week for eleven guineas in lovely\r\nLucerne, and there was a picture of the Rigi Kulm. He tore the card up\r\nsavagely, threw it into the waste-paper basket, hurriedly went down the\r\nsteps of his Club, bolted into the taxi and slammed the door behind him.\r\n\r\nThe driver had let the engine stop. Sir Charles sat tapping either\r\nfoot, his eyes alight, and his hands working nervously. The man was\r\nworking the barrel organ in front of the machine; the piston started\r\nonce or twice vigorously, then died down again. Sir Charles got out.\r\n\r\n“If you can’t make your damn kettle go,” he said,--then he suddenly\r\nsmiled. “What a good-natured face you have,” he remarked with an abrupt\r\ntransition of tone. “It’s a brutal thing for men like me with enormous\r\nincomes to bully people who have to be out in all weathers, though I\r\nmust say you taxi-men are a privileged lot! You’ve always got a herd\r\nof poor fellows round you, running messages for you and what not. You\r\nknow,” he went on still more familiarly, “if you didn’t look so jolly\r\ngood-natured I wouldn’t get into the cab again: but I will now. I will\r\nnow,” he nodded reassuringly to show there was no ill-feeling, and he\r\nclimbed again into the taxi, which at last started off upon its journey.\r\n\r\nSir Charles, within that vehicle, preserved for some moments the\r\nexpression of strong silence which was at least one-half of his\r\nfortune. Suddenly that expression broke down; something tickled him\r\nhugely. Such a merry look came into his eyes as had perhaps not visited\r\nthem since he was a child--if then. It occurred to him to look out of\r\nthe window. The fact that the window was up in no way incommoded him.\r\nHe butted his head through it and then very cautiously drew it in again.\r\n\r\n“That’s dangerous,” he muttered, “might have cut myself.”\r\n\r\nThe driver of the taxi heard nothing. Sir Charles looked through the\r\nstar of broken glass for a moment, then cautiously lowered the sash. He\r\nput his head out again, smiling almost to the point of laughter, and\r\nasked the driver whether he had noticed the absurd pomposity of the\r\ntwo sentries and the policemen outside Marlborough House. The taxi man\r\nsimply said “Yes sir,” and went on driving.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes Sir Charles was silent, ruminating and smiling\r\nwithin. Then he put his head out again.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but did you?” he asked.\r\n\r\nAnd just at that point the traffic was stopped to allow a cross current\r\nfrom another street to pass.\r\n\r\n“What a fool a man can make of himself,” said Sir Charles suddenly\r\nto nobody, communing half aloud with his own soul. “It’s an amazing\r\nthing! I can’t conceive why I should put my head out of a window like\r\nthat to tell him the way.... I suppose I was telling him the way ...\r\nbut my head is so bad!... What a fool a man can make of himself!” The\r\nsternness of his expression returned. He remembered that the taxi-man\r\nknew his address and he bethought him how to escape from humiliation.\r\nWhen they had driven up to his house he would pretend it was the wrong\r\nnumber and drive somewhere else.\r\n\r\nYet again his mood changed and he burst into an explosion of laughter\r\nas he remembered the sentries. Then the name over a shop which recalled\r\nto him certain mortgages tickled his fancy. He almost stopped the taxi\r\nto get out and have a bout of fun with the proprietors of that shop but\r\nhe was going swiftly through the streets and he preferred his ease.\r\n\r\nLong before they reached the Marble Arch he had forgotten all about\r\nhis intention of secrecy. Nay, he had forgotten about his dinner; he\r\nonly knew he was going home. And when he got out he saw upon the little\r\nmachine the notice “1/10.”\r\n\r\n“The register marks one and tenpence,” he said slowly and gravely\r\nto the driver, upon whose honest and happy face the tendency to\r\nastonishment was hardly controlled. “Now I don’t think these machines\r\nare infallible--far from it--but it isn’t worth my while, you\r\nunderstand, to argue it. So there’s one and tenpence.” He laboriously\r\ncounted out the money. “Wait a moment,” he said, “give me back three\r\ncoppers.”\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Give me back three coppers,” snapped Sir Charles testily, “I want to\r\nget rid of a thruppeny-bit,” and he handed over the offensive coin.\r\n\r\n“Now wait a minute, wait a minute,” he added, “don’t be in a hurry. I\r\nalways give a tip to taxi drivers--I really don’t know why,” he said\r\nwith a sudden change of expression, “there’s no particular favour, and\r\nthey earn lots of money. But one’s got to--I suppose if one didn’t,”\r\nhe continued in a ruminative tone, “they’d mark one in some way, same\r\nway they do the boxes in hotels, and your watch, me boy, when you pawn\r\nit,” he ended with an explosion of mirth, digging the man sharply in\r\nthe ribs. “Eh?” He pulled out two pence, added another penny, and then\r\nanother, took out a sixpence, put it back again, finally put the three\r\npence into the man’s hand, and went up to his door.\r\n\r\nThe taxi-man as he was driving off nodded familiarly to a policeman,\r\nand, by drawing up all one side of his face while he left the other in\r\nrepose, gave it to be understood that he had grave doubts of the mental\r\nbalance of the gentleman whom he had just conveyed to his residence.\r\n\r\nAlas, for simple men! The policeman strode up to him, rated him\r\nsoundly, asked what he meant by it, and in general gave him to\r\nunderstand that he was dealing with no ordinary household. And the\r\ntaxi-man, who was but recently landed from the sea, went off pondering,\r\nas far as the congested traffic would allow him, upon the mysteries of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe policeman solemnly returned to his duty, which was that of guarding\r\nthe residence of so great a citizen, and Sir Charles, putting his hat\r\nupon the table in the hall, went past the two servants upon whose\r\npresence in that vestibule he insisted, and walked majestically up the\r\nstaircase, as though the last half-hour had not been.\r\n\r\nBut he felt during this progress unaccountable desires. Before he was\r\nhalf-way up they were too strong for him. He stopped, leaned over the\r\nbannisters, looked at the two well-trained domestics who stood like\r\nstatues below him, and said: “Henry!”\r\n\r\nHenry, with a perfect turn of the head, answered, “Yes, Sir Charles?”\r\n\r\n“William!”\r\n\r\nWilliam, with a precisely similar change of attitude, said, “Yes, Sir\r\nCharles?”\r\n\r\n“What does it feel like to stand like that when another man, who simply\r\nhappens to be richer than you, is going by?”\r\n\r\nThe well-trained domestics made no reply.\r\n\r\n“Are you dumb?” he shouted angrily. “What’s it feel like, I say?...\r\nBlasted fools!” he muttered, when he had endured for a few seconds\r\ntheir continued silence. He went on up the stairs, saying half to\r\nhimself and half to them: “Catch _me_ doing it. Why, there’s more money\r\nin a whelk stall!”\r\n\r\nHe found his wife reading. She put down her book and asked him timidly\r\nwhat had been going on in the House.\r\n\r\nHis only answer was to put his hand to his head and say that he was\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nAnd so he was, for the pain, though less violent, had returned. She\r\nsuggested, though very hesitatingly, that he should lie down. He made\r\nno reply. He put his hand before his eyes and waited with set teeth\r\nuntil the first violence of the pang had passed, and then said to her\r\ngently: “I beg your pardon, dear, what did you say?”\r\n\r\nIt was nearly twenty years since she had heard that tone from him. She\r\nwas frightened.\r\n\r\n“Did you ask what was going on in the House?” he sighed. “Well, I can\r\ntell you.” He put his hands on the chimneypiece and looked down at\r\nthe fender. “There’s going on there,” he said decidedly, “as crass,\r\nimbecile and hypocritical a piece of futility as God permits: as\r\nAlmighty God permits!”\r\n\r\n“Oh Charles!” she cried, “Charles! Is there any trouble?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, looking round at her with mild surprise, “just the\r\nusual thing. Nobody has the slightest idea what they’re talking about,\r\nand nobody cares.”\r\n\r\n“Charles!” she said, feeling the gravity of the moment, for he was\r\nevidently suffering in some mysterious way. “Have you left it all right\r\nin your room? Haven’t you any appointments or anything?”\r\n\r\n“I never thought of that,” he answered. His eyes had in them an\r\nexpression quite childlike and he said suddenly: “One can still see\r\nwhat you were like when I married you, Maria. Turn your face round a\r\nlittle.”\r\n\r\nShe did so, with her face full of colour.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “they keep their profiles best. You can remember them\r\nby their profiles.”\r\n\r\n“Charles darling,” said Lady Repton getting up, her white hair shining\r\nagainst the flush of her forehead. “Let me look after you.” She had not\r\nused such a tone nor dreamed of such an endearment for many many years.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind, old girl,” he said, “I don’t mind,” and the innocence of\r\nhis eyes continued. Then as though something else were battling within\r\nhim he began abruptly: “Maria, have you got a full list of the people\r\nwho are coming to-night? I thought not. I’m sorry to have to speak of\r\nit again, I told you when we first came to town, and I’ve told you\r\nfifty times since, that I can do nothing without such a list.”\r\n\r\n“But I’ve got it,” she said, in great suffering, “I’ve got it,\r\nCharles.”\r\n\r\nHis eyes changed again. “You’ve got what?”\r\n\r\n“The list of the people who are coming, Charles.”\r\n\r\n“Oh ... I didn’t understand. The list of the people who are coming,” he\r\nrepeated slowly. “Well, show it to me in a moment.” He moved towards\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n“I’ll come with you,” she said.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since her husband had decided to enter Parliament\r\nand had entered it, twenty years before, while their child was still\r\nalive, Lady Repton had to take a decision of importance. She decided in\r\nfavour of the dinner. It was too late to change it, and she must trust\r\nto chance, but evidently some terrible thing had befallen the Warden of\r\nthe Court of Dowry.\r\n\r\nAs he was dressing she heard him now and then humming a chance tune\r\n(a thing which in his normal self he would no more have dreamed of\r\ndoing than of walking the streets without his hat) and now and then\r\ncommenting upon the character and attributes of the opera singer\r\nwhom he had last heard sing it. She heard him launch out into a long\r\nmonologue, describing the exact career of the new soprano at Covent\r\nGarden, the name of her father and her mother, the name of the Russian\r\nGrand Duke, the name of a wealthy English lady who had asked her (and\r\nhim) to supper, and then, oh horror! the name of an English statesman.\r\nThere was a burst of laughter which Lady Repton could hardly bear: and\r\nthen a silence.\r\n\r\nWhen they met again and their guests had begun to come he seemed right\r\nenough, except that now and then he would say things which every one\r\nin the room knew well enough to be true, but which were by no means\r\nsuitable to the occasion.\r\n\r\nIt was thought eccentric in him, especially by those who knew him best,\r\nthat he should comment somewhat upon what man was paired off with what\r\nwoman in the procession, and it was thought exceedingly coarse by his\r\npartner that he should explain a strong itching upon his right ankle to\r\nbe due, not to a flea, for his man was most careful, but to some little\r\nskin trouble.\r\n\r\nThe noise of talking during the dinner covered any other indiscretions,\r\nand when the men were alone with him over the wine, he sat gloomily\r\nenough, evidently changed but guilty of nothing more exceptional than a\r\ncomplete ignorance of where the wine came from or what it was.\r\n\r\nThere were the beginnings of a quarrel with a pompous and little-known\r\nfellow-member of his own Party who attempted to talk learnedly on wine.\r\nRepton had begun, “What on earth d’you know about wine? Why, your old\r\nfather wouldn’t allow you swipes when you went to fetch the supper\r\nbeer!” He had begun thus, I say, to recall the humble origins of the\r\npolitician, when he added: “But there, what’s the good of quarreling?\r\nYou’re all the same herd,”--his evident illness excused him. He\r\nled them back to the women, a gloomy troupe; they began to leave\r\nuncommonly early.\r\n\r\nThe one who lingered last was a very honest man, stupid,\r\nstraightforward and rich. He was fond of Charles Repton, simply because\r\nRepton had once done him a very cheap good turn in the matter of a\r\nlegal dispute; he had stopped a lawsuit. And this man ever, since--it\r\nwas now five years ago,--was ready to serve that household. His name, I\r\nshould add, was Withers, and he was a Commoner; he sat for Ashington.\r\nHe had not only this loyal feeling for Charles Repton, which he was\r\nperhaps the only man in London to feel; he had also a simple admiration\r\nfor him, for his career, for his speeches, for his power of introducing\r\nimpromptu such words as “well,” and “now” and “I will beg the House to\r\nobserve” into his careful arguments. Lady Repton trusted him, and she\r\nwas glad to see him remaining alone after the others had left. Charles\r\nRepton was sitting at the end of the room, staring at nothingness.\r\n\r\nWithers whispered to Lady Repton a rapid query as to what had happened.\r\nShe could tell him nothing, but her eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t it be better,” said Withers hurriedly, in a low tone, “if I\r\ngot him back to vote to-night? There’ll be three divisions at eleven.\r\nThere’s bound to be a scandal if he doesn’t turn up.”\r\n\r\n“Yes--no--very well,” said Lady Repton. “I don’t understand it. I don’t\r\nunderstand anything.” She almost broke down.\r\n\r\n“Repton,” said Withers, “won’t you come along with me? It’s half-past\r\nten, there’ll be three divisions.”\r\n\r\nRepton startled them both nearly out of their skins. “Divisions?” he\r\nshrieked, jumping up. “Go down and maunder past those green boxes in\r\na great stifling pack for nothing at all? Not if I know it! Why I can\r\nguess you the majority from here. And if there wasn’t any majority\r\nI should blasted well like to know the difference it would make!\r\nDivisions! Oh chase me!” And he snorted and sat down again.\r\n\r\nWithers did not know whether to stay or to go, but before he could\r\nreply Charles Repton in the most ordinary of tones went on: “I can’t\r\nunderstand a man like you, Withers, putting up with it. You’re rich,\r\nyou’re a gentleman born, which I’m not; you’d be just as big a man in\r\nBuckinghamshire, especially nowadays when the county’s crawling with\r\nJews, if you were out of the House. You’d be infinitely freer. You know\r\nperfectly well the country’ll stagger along without the silly tom-fool\r\nbusiness or with it, and that neither it nor anything else can prevent\r\nthe smash. Why don’t you go and live your life of a squire like a\r\nsensible chap? And make one prayer that you may die before the whole\r\nbag of tricks comes to an end?”\r\n\r\n“Come along, Charles,” said Withers smoothly, “do come along.”\r\n\r\n“Not I!” said Repton, “I’m going to bed. I’m tired, and my head hurts\r\nme!” And he went out like a boor.\r\n\r\n“Lady Repton,” said Withers very gently when he had gone, “what has\r\nCharles got to do to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“He never tells me,” said the wretched lady. “I suppose he will go into\r\nthe City as usual.”\r\n\r\n“It’s very unwise,” said Withers, “and yet I don’t know after all. It\r\nmight help him to be in harness, and you’ll have him out of the house\r\nwhile you’re making your plans. I’ll do what I can, Lady Repton, I’ll\r\ndo what I can. Isn’t to-morrow the meeting of the Van Diemens Company?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t tell,” said Lady Repton despairingly. She was impatient to\r\nbe seeing to her husband. She had grown terrified during the last few\r\nhours when he was out of her sight.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is,” said Withers. “Oh that’ll be all right. It’ll do him all\r\nthe good in the world: I’m sure it will. Good-night.”\r\n\r\nHe came back again. He remembered something: “Of course,” he said a\r\nlittle awkwardly, “ I don’t know anything about these things, but I\r\nread in the paper that he was down to speak at the big Wycliffite\r\nmeeting. Don’t let him go there, Lady Repton, until you’re quite\r\ncertain, will you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh no,” she said with the terrified look coming back again upon her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“It’s not like business,” said Withers. “There’d be excitement, you\r\nknow. Good-night.” And he went out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThose of Charles Repton’s guests who were Members of the House of\r\nCommons had returned to it. One or two of them had hinted that things\r\nwere a little queer with Repton, but Withers when he got back just in\r\ntime for the divisions, found no rumours as yet, and was profoundly\r\ngrateful. One man only who had been present at the dinner, took him\r\naside in the Lobby and asked him whether Charles Repton had had any\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nWithers laughed the question away, and explained that he had known\r\nRepton for many years and that now and then he did give way to these\r\nsilly fits of temper. It was digestion, he said; perhaps the guest had\r\nnoticed there were no onions.\r\n\r\nThe House had something better to gossip about, for after the divisions\r\nDemaine was seen going arm in arm with the Prime Minister into his room\r\nfor a moment. There had been plenty of talk of Demaine lately: that\r\nvisit increased it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCertain members more curious or fussy than the rest scoured the\r\njournalists in the lobbies: they had news.\r\n\r\nIt was all settled. The paragraphs had been sent round to the papers.\r\nThe Lobby correspondents had each of them quite special and peculiar\r\nmeans of knowing that Certain Changes were expected in the Cabinet in\r\nthe near future; that the House of Lords was to be strengthened by the\r\naddition of talents which were universally respected; several names had\r\nbeen mentioned for the vacancy; perhaps Mr. Demaine, with his special\r\ntraining and the experience drawn from his travels would, on the\r\nwhole, form the most popular appointment.\r\n\r\nThus had the announcement been given in its vaguest form by the Prime\r\nMinister’s secretary; two or three favoured journals had been permitted\r\nto say without doubt that Charles Repton had resigned; the exact title\r\nunder which he would accept a peerage was suggested, and Demaine was\r\nput down in black and white as being certainly his successor.\r\n\r\nAll this Demaine was told meanwhile that evening in the Prime\r\nMinister’s room.\r\n\r\nHis interview with Sorrel had been exceedingly satisfactory, and\r\nnever in his life, not in the moments when he could spend most of his\r\nfather-in-law’s money, had Demaine experienced so complete a respect\r\nand so eager a service. He felt himself already Warden, and what was\r\nbetter, he felt himself perfectly capable of the Wardenship. His mood\r\nrose and rose. He forgot Sudie; he had not even told her when he would\r\nbe home. He shook his cousin’s hand as warmly as might a provincial,\r\nand went out by the entry under Big Ben, to calm down the exuberance of\r\nhis joy with breaths of the fresh night air along the Embankment. It\r\nwas nearly twelve o’clock.\r\n\r\nSo ended for George Mulross Demaine that Monday, June 1st, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Charles Repton woke upon the Tuesday morning he felt better\r\nthan he had felt at any moment since the loss of his youth. There\r\nseemed something easy in the air about him, and within his mind a lack\r\nof business and friction which he did not account for at the time, but\r\nwhich perhaps in a vague manner he may have ascribed to the purity of\r\nthe air and the beauty of the day.\r\n\r\nThe sun was streaming into his windows from over the Park. It was\r\nalready warm, and as he dressed and shaved himself he allowed his\r\nthoughts to wander with an unaccustomed freedom over the simple\r\nthings of life. He noted the colour of the trees; he was glad to see\r\nthe happiness of the passers-by in the streets below; he felt an\r\nunaccountable sympathy with the human race, and he was even touched\r\nwith contempt as he gazed at the long procession of wealthy houses\r\nwhich marked the line of Park Lane.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast he ate heartily, though he was alone; he looked at the\r\nsmall batch of letters which awaited him, and when he opened his\r\nnewspaper he positively laughed at the opinions expressed in the\r\nleading article. He nearly broke into another laugh as he read the news\r\nfrom America, and then--with a gesture which horrified the two solemn\r\nservants who had watched the unaccountable change in their master’s\r\nmanner, he tore the paper rapidly into four pieces and threw it on the\r\nfloor. Having done this he jumped up gaily, nodded to the menials, said\r\n“You didn’t expect that,” walked briskly out, took his hat and coat\r\nand with no conscious purpose but as habit moved him jumped into a\r\nmotor-bus going East.\r\n\r\nThe conductor, who had a respect for Sir Charles Repton’s clothes, and\r\nespecially for his spats, and who seemed to recognise his face, asked\r\nhim gently how much he desired to spend upon a ticket: to which he\r\nanswered in a breezy manner, “Penny of course. Never pay more than a\r\npenny; then if the beastly thing breaks down you’re not out of pocket\r\n... ’sides which,” he went on as though talking to himself, “if they\r\nforget about you you can have tuppence-worth or thruppence-worth for\r\nthe same money!” And he chuckled.\r\n\r\nThe conductor looked at him first in terror, then smiled responsively\r\nand went forward to deal with less fortunate people, while Sir Charles\r\nhummed gently to himself,--a little out of tune but none the less\r\ncheerfully on that account--an air of ribald associations.\r\n\r\nThe top of the bus was pretty full, and a workman who had occasion to\r\ntravel in the same direction as his betters saw fit to sit down in\r\nthe one empty place beside the Baronet. It would have been difficult\r\nto decide upon what occupation this honest man had most recently\r\nbeen engaged: but there had certainly entered into it oil, wet clay,\r\nprobably soot, and considerable masses of oxidised copper. It was not\r\nremarkable, therefore, that, beside such a companion, especially as\r\nthat companion was a large man, Sir Charles should have found himself\r\nconsiderably incommoded. What _was_ remarkable was the manner in which\r\nthe Baronet expressed his annoyance. He turned round upon the workman\r\nwith an irritated frown and said:\r\n\r\n“I can’t make out why they allow people like you on omnibuses!”\r\n\r\n“Yer carn’t wort?” said the breadwinner in a threatening voice.\r\n\r\n“I say I · can’t · make · out,” answered Sir Charles, carefully picking\r\nout each word--“I · can’t · make · out · why · they · allow · people ·\r\nlike · you on omnibuses,--dirty _brutes_ like you, I should say. Why\r\nthe devil....”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the workman seized Sir Charles by the collar. Sir\r\nCharles, though an older man, was by no means weak; his tall body was\r\nwell-knit and active, and he felt unaccountably brawny that morning; he\r\ngot the thumb and forefinger of his left hand like a pitchfork under\r\nhis opponent’s chin, and there began what promised to be a very pretty\r\nscuffle. Everybody on the top of the bus got up, a woman tittered, and\r\na large consequential fellow who attempted to interfere received a\r\nviolent backhander from the huge left hand of the Operative, the wrist\r\nof which was firmly grasped by the right of the Politician and was\r\nstruggling in the air.\r\n\r\nThe bus stopped, a crowd gathered, the workman, as is customary with\r\nhard-working people, was easily appeased; Sir Charles, a good deal\r\nruffled, got off the bus, and pressing two shillings into the hand of a\r\npoliceman who was preparing to take notes, said loudly:\r\n\r\n“That’s all right! You can’t do anything against _me_, and of course I\r\ncan prevent the thing getting into the papers; but it’s always better\r\nto give a policeman money,--safe rule!”\r\n\r\nWith that he wormed his way through the increasing mob and disappeared\r\ninto a taxi, the driver of which, with singular sagacity, drove off\r\nrapidly without asking for any direction. When he was well out of it,\r\nRepton put his head out of the window and addressed the driver in the\r\nfollowing remarkable words:\r\n\r\n“I don’t really know where you’d better go: of course if you go to my\r\nClub I could change there” (his collar was torn off him and his hat was\r\nbadly battered) “but on the whole you’d better take me to Guy’s--No\r\nyou hadn’t, go to the Club. Stop at a Boy Messenger’s on your way.”\r\n\r\n“What Club, sir?” asked the driver with the deference due to a man at\r\nonce wealthy and mad.\r\n\r\n“You won’t know it,” said Sir Charles kindly and still craning in a\r\nconstrained manner out of the window. “By the way, why don’t they have\r\na speaking-tube or something from inside to you people? It’s awkward\r\nturning one’s head outside like a snake. You won’t know it, but I’ll\r\nshout to you when we get to the bottom of St. James’s Street.”\r\n\r\nThe driver, now convinced that he had to do with something quite out\r\nof the ordinary, touched his cap in a manner almost military, and fled\r\nthrough the streets of London. At a Boy Messenger’s office Sir Charles\r\nsent home for clothes and for a change, got to his Club, informed the\r\nastonished porter that it was a very fine day, that he had just had a\r\nfight on the top of a bus, that by God the Johnnie didn’t know who he\r\nwas tackling! He, Sir Charles, was no longer a young man, but he would\r\nhave shown him what an upper cut was if he could have got a free swing!\r\nHe proceeded to illustrate the nature of this fence--then suddenly\r\nasked for his letters, and for a dressing-room.\r\n\r\nAfter this, which had all been acted in the most rapid and violent\r\nmanner, he ran up the steps, stood for a few moments with his hands\r\nin his pockets gazing at the telegrams, and forgetful that he had no\r\ncollar on, that his coat was torn, that there was blood upon his hands,\r\nand that half of his waistcoat was wide open with two buttons missing.\r\nHe found the telegrams of some interest; he did not notice the glances\r\ndirected towards him by those who passed in and out of the building,\r\nnor the act of a page who in passing the porter’s box tapped his\r\nforehead twice with his forefinger.\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment in thought, then it suddenly occurred to him that\r\nit would have been a wiser thing to have gone straight home. He got\r\nanother taxi and drove to his house. There, after a brief scene with\r\nthe footman in which he rehearsed all that he had already given them at\r\nthe Club, he ordered his clothes to be put out for him, and took a very\r\ncomfortable bath.\r\n\r\nLuckily for him he found lying upon his table when he came down, a note\r\nwhich he had left there the night before with regard to the Van Diemens\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n“Forgot that,” he said, a little seriously. “Good thing I found it.”\r\n\r\nHe picked it up, folded it once or twice, unfolded it, re-read it\r\nperhaps three times, and while he was so employed heard the grave voice\r\nof his secretary begging him to go into town in the motor.\r\n\r\nRepton did not for the moment see any connection between his recent\r\nadventures and this request, but he was all compliance, and nodding\r\ncheerfully he waited for the machine to come round. When it had come he\r\nlooked at it closely for a moment, confided to the chauffeur that he\r\nintensely disliked its colour, but that it was a bargain and he wasn’t\r\ngoing to spend any money on changing it, because he meant to sell it\r\nto some fool at the end of the season--got in, and was driven to the\r\nCannon Street Hotel.\r\n\r\nHe was a little late. The platform was already occupied and his empty\r\nchair was waiting for him.\r\n\r\nAt his entry there was some applause, such as would naturally greet\r\nthe man who was known to be the Directing Brain of all that interest.\r\nNone noticed a change in him. His clothes were perhaps a little less\r\nspick and span: it was unusual to see him stretch his arms two or three\r\ntimes before he sat down, and those who knew him best, in his immediate\r\nneighbourhood upon the platform, were astonished to see him smile and\r\nnod familiarly to several of the less important Directors; but on the\r\nwhole he behaved himself in a fairly consecutive manner, and if he did\r\nwhisper to a colleague upon his right that he looked as though he had\r\nbeen drinking a little too much overnight, the unaccustomed jest was\r\nallowed to pass without comment.\r\n\r\nWhen the moment came for him to speak, he jumped up, perhaps a little\r\ntoo briskly, faced his audience with less than his usual solemnity,\r\nnay, with something very like a grin, and struck the first note of his\r\ngreat speech in a manner which they had hitherto never heard from his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly calculated to compel their attention if not their\r\nconviction, for the very first words which he shouted into the body of\r\nthe hall, were these:\r\n\r\n“_WHAT ARE WE HERE FOR?_”\r\n\r\nAfter that rhetorical question, delivered in a roar that would have\r\nfilled the largest railway station in London, he repeated it in a\r\nsomewhat lower tone, clenched his fists, struck them squarely on the\r\ntable, and answered as though he were delivering a final judgment:\r\n\r\n“_MONEY!...._\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen,” he went on, raising his right hand and wagging\r\nhis forefinger at them--“we are here for money! And don’t you forget\r\nit!”\r\n\r\nHe blew a great breath, watched them quizzically a moment and then\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n“What _most_ of you _most_ lack is the power of thinking clearly. I can\r\nsee it in your faces. I can see it in the way you sit. And people who\r\ncan’t think clearly don’t make _money_. No one can think clearly who\r\nhasn’t got a good grip of his first principles and doesn’t know first\r\nof all what he wants before he tries to get it. Well, I repeat it, and\r\nI challenge any one to deny it: what we want is _money_! Let us make\r\nthat quite clear. Let us anchor ourselves to that ... and when we once\r\nhave that thoroughly fixed in our minds we can go on to the matter of\r\nhow we are to get it.”\r\n\r\n“Now ladies and gentlemen,” he proceeded in a more conversational\r\nmanner, rubbing his hands together, and smiling at them with excessive\r\nfreedom, “let us first of all take stock. Sitting here before me and\r\nround me here upon this platform (he waved his right arm in a large\r\ngesture) are four million pounds of Van Diemens stock. Four million\r\npounds, ladies and gentlemen! But wait a moment. At what price was\r\nthat stock bought? I am not asking at what price _I_ bought,”--here\r\nhe looked to the left and the right, sweeping the hundreds of faces\r\nbefore him--“I am not asking at what price _I_ bought: my position\r\ndiffers from yours, my hearties; I’m in the middle of things and my\r\nofficial position obtains me even more knowledge than I should gather\r\nwith my own very excellent powers of observation: I’ve spent a whole\r\nlifetime in watching markets, and I have never cared a _dump_--I\r\nrepeat, ladies and gentlemen, a DUMP, for anything except the profit. I\r\nhave never listened to any talk about the ‘development of a country’ or\r\n‘possibilities’ or ‘the future,’ or any kid of that sort. I’ve bought\r\npaper and sold paper ... and I’ve done uncommonly well out of it.”\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, more for breath than for anything else, for he\r\nhad been speaking very rapidly; and in the terrified silence round\r\nhim Bingham was heard muttering as though in reply to some whispered\r\nquestion: “You leave him _alone_! It may be unconventional, but....”\r\n\r\n“The question is, ladies and gentlemen, at what price have you bought\r\n... on the average? Many of you are country parsons, many of you ladies\r\nwith far more money than you have knowledge what to do with it. Not\r\na few of you stock-brokers--an exceptionally inexperienced class of\r\nmen--you are a fair average lot of British investors, and I ask _at\r\nwhat price did you buy?_” He looked at them fixedly for a few moments,\r\nthen pulling out a scrap of paper he read it briefly:\r\n\r\n“‘From figures that have been laid before me I find that the average\r\nprice at which the present shareholders bought was eight pounds sixteen\r\nshillings and a few pence,’” and then added “We’ll call it eight\r\npounds. Always be on the Conservative side.”\r\n\r\nAt this remark, which was supposed to contain a political jest, two\r\nold ladies in the second row tittered, but finding themselves alone,\r\nstopped tittering.\r\n\r\n“I say take it at eight pounds. Well, that four million of stock stands\r\nfor thirty-two million pounds. _Thirty-two million pounds!_” he said\r\nwith a rising voice--“THIRTY-TWO MILLION POUNDS!” he roared,--banging\r\nthe table with his fist and leaning forward with a determined jowl....\r\n“And what’s left of it? _Nothing!_”\r\n\r\nThere was another dead silence at the end of this striking phrase, and\r\nBingham was again heard to mutter: “You leave him _alone_; he knows\r\nwhat he’s at!” A certain uneasy shuffling of feet behind him caused\r\nRepton to turn his head snappishly, then he looked round again and\r\nresumed his great oration.\r\n\r\n“I say _nothing_.... Oh! I know there are some of you stupid enough\r\nto think that you have still got sixteen and thruppence a share.\r\nThat was the quotation in the paper this morning. Eugh!” he sniffed\r\nsardonically, “You try and _sell_ at that and you’ll soon find what\r\nyou’ve got! No! you haven’t even got that sixteen and thruppence. You\r\nhaven’t got two shillings in the pound for what you put in. You’ve got\r\nnothing! nothing! nothing!! Put that in your pipes and smoke it....”\r\n\r\n“And so, gentlemen,” he added, leaning his body backwards and putting\r\nhis thumbs into his waistcoat, “the business before us is how to get\r\nout of this hole. There are perhaps some of you,” he went on, frowning\r\nintellectually, “there are perhaps some of you who imagine that the\r\nGovernment is going to buy. Well, I’m a member of the Government and I\r\ncan tell you they are _not_.”\r\n\r\nAt this appalling remark the elements of revolution upon the platform\r\nall but exploded, but the solid weight of Bingham was still there, and\r\nif I may hint at a phrase with which the reader is already familiar,\r\nhe suggested that Sir Charles knew what he was about and should be let\r\n_alone_.\r\n\r\n“Even if they did buy,” Repton went on seriously and argumentatively,\r\n“they could hardly buy at more than par. I’m the last man,” he\r\ncontinued rapidly “to jaw about public opinion or things of that sort.\r\nThe real reason why they won’t buy is the Irish. But even if they did\r\nbuy they could hardly give more than par. And what’s par?” he said with\r\ngreat disdain. “No, that cock won’t fight!... Mind you, I’m not saying\r\nyou couldn’t have got the Government to buy a little time ago. I think\r\nyou could. But you can’t now.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think there’s a single man on either front bench--” this was\r\nsaid meditatively and tapping off the fingers of one hand with the\r\nforefinger of the other--“who’s personally interested, and I don’t\r\n_think_ there’s any direct connection since Cooke died between the\r\nCabinet and any one who is--except me. No, that’s not the way out. What\r\nyou’ve got to do, ladies and gentlemen, is to throw a sprat to catch a\r\nwhale.”\r\n\r\n“A sprat,” he meditatively repeated, “to catch a whale: a great Whale\r\nfull o’ blubber! ... an’ how are you going to do that?”\r\n\r\n“Now listen”--his tone had become very earnest and he was leaning\r\nforward, bent and fixed and holding them with his fine strong eyes,\r\n“listen, there are three steps. You’ve got first of all to show the\r\npublic that you _believe_ in the future of the Company; next you’ve\r\ngot to decide upon a dodge to show that: something that’ll make every\r\none think that you the shareholders do really believe in that future.\r\nWhat’s the third step? Why up goes the price--real price--money\r\noffered--_then you can sell_. That’s my opinion,” he concluded,\r\nclapping his hands together and laying them upon the table before him:\r\nand he let it sink in.\r\n\r\n“Now you’ll notice,” he went on, “in the prospectus you have received,\r\nsome talk of a railway. We’re asking money from you to build a railway.\r\nNow why are we doing that? Please follow me carefully.”\r\n\r\nThe hundreds of heads bent forward and the intelligences they contained\r\nwere prepared to follow him carefully. He was a great man.\r\n\r\n“We have asked you to build a railway,” he pronounced, leaving a little\r\nspace of time between each word, “because a railway still catches\r\non. I don’t know why, but it _does_. Mines don’t. You might discover\r\nore all over the place and they wouldn’t go: I’ve got two men of\r\nmy own, engineers, _experts_, who’ll discover ore anywhere; they’d\r\ndiscover tons before three o’clock this afternoon and you might swear\r\nyour dying oath to them, but the public wouldn’t believe you. As for\r\nagriculture,--Piff! And as for climate, Boo! But _railways_ still work.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. You raise your capital for your railway. What that railway\r\nmay be imagined to do is set out in full before you and I won’t go into\r\nit. But I will ask you especially to note the passage in which it is\r\ndescribed as giving a strategical supremacy to the Empire. You know\r\nwhat the Empire is. You _may_ know, some o’ you, what strategy is.\r\nLooks as if there were a fleecy general or two among you! But that’s\r\nas may be--just note the phrase. It’s safety! That’s what it is! No\r\nodds. No blighter to run any risk of having to fight any one anywhere!\r\nGrand!”... “I _think_ also,” he mused, “something could be done with\r\nthe tourist side ... there are falls and mountains and things ... but\r\nno matter: the point is the railway.”\r\n\r\nHe drank from a glass of water on the table, turned round angrily and\r\nsaid: “Good lord what water! It’s bad enough to have to drink water\r\nin public for a show, but it needn’t be tepid! If the place wasn’t\r\nso public I’d spit it out again!” Then facing the audience again:\r\n“However.... About that railway. First understand clearly, ladies\r\nand gentlemen, _that railway is not going to be built_! There is no\r\nintention of building it. There is no intention of surveying it.”\r\n\r\nTwo or three voices rose in protest at the back of the hall. Sir\r\nCharles leaned forward and put out his hand appealingly:--\r\n\r\n“One moment, one moment pray! Hear me out! I don’t mean that _no_ one\r\nwill build it. That’s not our funeral. I mean that _we_ won’t. The\r\n‘Company’ may, whatever that means. But you and I--the people who have\r\ngot into this hole--_we_ won’t. It won’t be _our_ money. Seize that!\r\nGet a hold of that! It’s the key to the whole business.”\r\n\r\nLittle gasps and one profound sigh, but no interruptions followed this\r\nexplanation, and Sir Charles with perfect coolness continued:\r\n\r\n“What we want is five shillings a share--only five shillings a share.\r\nFive shillings where most of you have already given a hundred and\r\nsixty! Five shillings a share ... four million shares ... that’s a\r\nmillion. And mind you, only a nominal million. We don’t want your two\r\nhalf-crowns; bless you no. All we want in cash is a shilling. For the\r\nrest, you’ll see in a moment. Well, there you are then, a shilling, a\r\nmiserable shilling. Now just see what that shilling will do!”\r\n\r\n“In the first place it’ll give publicity and plenty of it. Breath\r\nof public life, publicity! Breath o’ finance too! We’ll have that\r\nrailway marked in a dotted line on the maps: all the maps: school\r\nmaps: office maps. We’ll have leaders on it and speeches on it. And\r\ngood hearty attacks on it. And th-e-n....” He lowered his voice to a\r\nvery confidential wheedle,--“the price’ll begin to creep up--Oh ... o\r\n... oh! the _real_ price, my beloved fellow-shareholders, the price\r\nat which one can really _sell_, the price at which one can handle the\r\n_stuff_.”\r\n\r\nHe gave a great breath of satisfaction. “Now d’ye see? It’ll go to\r\nforty shillings right off, it ought to go to forty-five, it may go\r\nto sixty!... And then,” he said briskly, suddenly changing his tone,\r\n“then, my hearties, you blasted well sell out: you unload ... you dump\r\n’em. Plenty more fools where your lot came from. I won’t advise,--sell\r\nout just when you see fit. Every man for himself, and every woman\r\ntoo,” he said, bowing politely to the two old ladies in the second\r\nrow,--“and the devil take the hindmost. But you’ll all have something,\r\nyou’ll none of you lose it all as it looked like last week. Most of\r\nyou’ll lose on your first price: late comers least: a few o’ ye’ll make\r\nif you bought under two pounds. Anyhow _I_ shall.... There! if that\r\nisn’t finance I don’t know what is!”\r\n\r\nAnd with a large happy, final, satisfactory and conclusive smile, the\r\nBuilder of Empire, to the astonishment of every one, looked at his\r\nwatch, called upon his Creator as a witness to the lateness of the\r\nhour, and suddenly went out.\r\n\r\nIt would be delicious to describe what happened in the vast body of\r\nthat hall when the Chief had left it: how the shareholders made a noise\r\nlike angry bees swarming; how a curate who had done no man any harm was\r\nsquashed against a wall and broke two ribs; how five or six excited\r\nand almost tearful men surrounded the reporters and fought for their\r\nnotebooks; how Bingham continued to reiterate that Charles Repton knew\r\nwhat he was at; and how a certain quiet little man with a bronzed face\r\nand very humorous eyes, slunk out and got rid of his block of shares\r\nwithin the hour, to a young hearty Colonial gentleman who was wealthy\r\nand had come to London to learn the business ways of our City.[2]\r\n\r\nBut I must follow Sir Charles in his rapid drive to the House of\r\nCommons. I must mention his unconventional remark to the policeman to\r\nthe effect that he hoped that old fool Pottle hadn’t come in yet; and\r\nhis taking his place on the front bench just after prayers with a look\r\nso merry and free that it illumined the faces opposite like a sun.\r\n\r\nThe questions to which he had to reply came somewhat late on the paper,\r\nand he caused not a little scandal by suggesting in a low tone such\r\nanswers to his colleagues for _their_ questions as seemed to him at\r\nonce humorous and apposite.\r\n\r\nThe aged Home Secretary especially afforded him fine sport, and when a\r\nquestion was asked with regard to the new Admiralty docks at Bosham,\r\nhe went to the length of chucking a cocked-hat note to the principal\r\ncontractor who sat solemnly upon the benches behind him, nodding\r\ncheerfully over his shoulder and whispering loudly: “It’s all up!”\r\n\r\nAll this boded ill for what might happen when his own turn came; and\r\nindeed the scene that followed was of a kind entirely novel in the long\r\nhistory of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple question; Question 63. Not ten minutes of question-time\r\nwere left when it was asked. It was put by a gentle little man who had\r\nput it down for the sake of a friend who lived on the South Coast, and\r\nit was simply to ask the right honourable Baronet, the Warden of the\r\nCourt of Dowry, whether his attention had been called to the presence\r\nupon the Royal Sovereign shoals of a wreck which endangered navigation,\r\nand what he intended to do in the matter.\r\n\r\nCharles Repton jumped up like a bird; he jovially and rapidly read the\r\ntypewritten answer which his permanent officials had given him--to the\r\neffect that he had nothing to add to the reply given three years before\r\nwith regard to the same wreck, which was then, they were careful to\r\npoint out, far more dangerous than at the present day.\r\n\r\nBut when he had finished reading the official reply, he looked up\r\ngenially at his interlocutor and said:\r\n\r\n“We don’t want to interfere with that wreck: it’s full of gin!”\r\n\r\nAn angry fanatic hearing the word “gin” rose at once and put the\r\nsupplementary question: “May I ask whether that gin was destined for\r\nthe unfortunate natives of the Lagos Hinterland?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Warden of the Court of Dowry politely, “Yes sir, you\r\nmay: but they will never get it. However, several thousand tons of gin\r\nI am glad to say have gone out to the negroes of our colonies since\r\nthe ship was lost, to the no small advantage,” he added, “of my friend\r\nMr. Garey; whom, by the way,” he continued with conversational ease,\r\n“we all hope to see in this House shortly, for old Southwick who’s up\r\nagainst him hasn’t got a dog’s chance, and you probably know that we\r\nare forcing Pipps to resign. Bound to be an election!”\r\n\r\nHe sat down. It was a quarter to four and the House was saved. But\r\nthough the decorum of that great assembly prevented one word from\r\nbeing uttered as to what had passed, the Lobbies were full of it, and\r\nwhen the first division was taken men who ordinarily filed past the\r\nTreasury bench avoided it, while from distant and dark corners where\r\none cannot be observed, long and intent looks were darted at the happy\r\nWarden of the Court of Dowry.\r\n\r\nHe sat there gay and quite unconscious of the effect he had produced,\r\npassed with his Party into the Lobbies for the division, greeting with\r\nfamiliar joy men who appeared rather anxious to avoid his eye, and\r\nmaking, I regret to say, such unseemly jests upon the Party system as\r\nhad never been heard within those walls before.\r\n\r\nThe young Prime Minister, though suffering so considerably from the\r\nleft lung, was never at a loss where tact, and especially tact combined\r\nwith rapid action, was necessary. A horrified servant called him from\r\nhis room and described what was passing. He did not stop to ask why\r\nor how the thing had happened. He came in rapidly through the door\r\nbehind the Speaker’s chair, and beckoned to Sir Charles Repton who was\r\nat that moment occupied in drawing a large caricature of the Leader\r\nof the Opposition, with his hands deep into the pocket of an amiable\r\nfarmer-like gentleman in top-boots and whiskers, who made a presentable\r\nimage of John Bull.\r\n\r\nCharles Repton got up at once and went out to his Chief. “What d’you\r\nthink of this?” he said, showing his picture.\r\n\r\nThe young Prime Minister smiled as death would smile. “It’s very good,\r\nit’s very good,” he said hurriedly. “Have it coloured ... colour it\r\nyourself. Oh, do what you like with it.... Come with me. Come into my\r\nroom, do. No, I’ll tell you what, I want to speak to you. Let’s get out\r\ninto the air.”\r\n\r\nHe walked his subordinate away rapidly arm in arm across Parliament\r\nSquare towards St. James’s Park, talking about a thousand things and\r\nnever giving Repton time for a word. Then he said suddenly: “What I\r\nreally want to say to you, Repton, is ...” He abruptly broke off. “Is\r\nLady Repton at home?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Repton a little puzzled, “or she will be by this time. I\r\nmake her show me her plan for the afternoon at lunch, and she’s got to\r\nsuit me, or there’s a row.”\r\n\r\n“Well now,” said the Prime Minister, “will you do me a great favour?”\r\nHe put his hand on Repton’s shoulder and looked candidly into his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Certainly my dear fellow,” answered the Warden of the Court of Dowry\r\nin the utmost good humour. “After all my position depends upon you, and\r\na good deal of my income depends upon my position. It isn’t likely I\r\nshould put your back up, even if I didn’t like you, which is far from\r\nbeing the case, though I must say I don’t think you’re a man of very\r\nexceptional talent. I think you owe most of your position to birth.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” said the Prime Minister hurriedly, “I understand. Now what\r\nI want you to do is this: jump into the first thing you see and _go\r\nstraight home_. You will see why when you get there. It’s absolutely\r\nurgent. Will you?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Repton more puzzled than ever. “All you politicians\r\nare such liars that I make a point of believing the exact opposite\r\nof what you say: but if you tell me it’s of any service to you, it\r\ncertainly does _me_ no harm.” And whistling gaily he walked off towards\r\na cab that was meandering across the Parade.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prime Minster had seen him well off he went as rapidly as\r\ndignity would allow into Downing Street, took the telephone from his\r\nsecretary and in an agony of apprehension lest he should be too late,\r\nat last heard Lady Repton’s voice. He told her that her husband was\r\nthe victim of a most distressing malady; she would understand it when\r\nshe saw him. He implored her to save so valuable a man for the country\r\nby managing in some way or other to confine him to the house until he\r\nshould be medically examined.\r\n\r\nIt was a great relief to the young fellow to have got this duty done.\r\nHis fifty-four years seemed to weigh less upon him: for the ten minutes\r\nbetween leaving the House and seeing Repton off he had been on a grill:\r\nthere was still ridicule to be faced, but he had a sentiment of having\r\nachieved his end and of having just saved as difficult a situation as\r\never the chief of a State had had to meet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious moment, but many moments are necessarily anxious\r\nin the life of a man who holds in his hands the destinies of Great\r\nBritain, and the young and popular Prime Minister had the stuff in\r\nhim to stand worse scenes than that, but he was exhausted and he was\r\nslightly troubled. The full consequences of the dreadful affair had not\r\nyet shaped themselves in his mind.\r\n\r\nHe walked back to his room in the House of Commons, ruminating during\r\nthose few steps upon the developments that might arise from Repton’s\r\nterrible accident, and beginning to plan how he should arrange matters\r\nwith Demaine. It would want caution, for Demaine was slow to understand\r\n... but then there was a corresponding advantage to that, for like all\r\nslow men, Dimmy could hold his tongue.... In fact he couldn’t help it.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister was pleased to think that he had that second\r\nstring to his bow, and that opinion had been sufficiently prepared\r\nfor the change. Repton would be certified of course, the sooner the\r\nbetter,--that would prevent any necessity for a peerage. Demaine’s\r\ntaking the place would seem more natural, and those gadflies, the\r\n_Moon_ and the _Capon_, would not fall into a fever about the\r\nappointment.... Perhaps after all the Repton business would be an\r\nadvantage in the long run!\r\n\r\nThe more he thought of his choice of Demaine the more pleased he was,\r\nand he had almost persuaded himself that the appointment was due to\r\nsome extreme cunning upon his own part, when, coming round from his\r\nroom into the Lobbies, he casually asked a colleague where Demaine was\r\nat the moment.\r\n\r\nThe colleague didn’t know. “I have my back turned to the benches behind\r\nus you know,” he explained elaborately.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister cast upon him a look of contempt, and asked the\r\ndoorkeeper whether he had seen Mr. Demaine.\r\n\r\n“G. M. Demaine,” said the doorkeeper solemnly, running his finger down\r\na list.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister was almost moved to reprove him, but dignity forbade.\r\n\r\n“Not in the House!” said the man curtly, addressing as an equal the\r\nchief power in England; for his post was secure, the Prime Minister’s\r\nprecarious.\r\n\r\n“You mean not on the benches: I can see that for myself!” said the\r\nPrime Minister sharply.\r\n\r\n“I mean he hasn’t passed this door, sir,” said the official with quiet\r\ndignity, and Dolly went off considerably nettled, and looked into the\r\ntea-room and the libraries, and even wasted a little time in going\r\nround by the smoking-room. The policemen in the central hall had\r\nnot seen Demaine, nay, a constituent with an exceedingly long black\r\nmoustache and fierce eyes had been waiting by appointment with Demaine\r\nfor two hours, and Demaine had not been found. The Prime Minister\r\ncondescended so much as to speak to this man, and the man, not knowing\r\nwhom he might be addressing, told him plainly that “if Mr. Demaine\r\ninterpreted his duties in this fashion, he couldn’t answer for his\r\nseat, that was all!”\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister further condescended to go out of the House in the\r\nordinary way, and the policeman who guarded the ordinary portal had not\r\nseen Mr. Demaine.\r\n\r\nIt was really very awkward and exasperating, though it was only a\r\ndetail. He must see Demaine that afternoon: it was imperative. But\r\nit was also important that he should see him as soon as possible. He\r\nwanted to keep him out of the way till he was coached.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in this happy English life of ours more soothing to\r\nthe brain in moments of anxiety, than the perusal of any one of those\r\ngreat Organs of Opinion which are the characteristic of our people and\r\nthe envy of Europe, and of these it must be admitted none stand on\r\nquite the same intellectual and moral plane as the best two or three\r\nof our London evening papers. One of these the Prime Minister had\r\nalways found particularly soothing. He bought it of the newsman at the\r\ncorner of Parliament Square and opened it as he walked along at leisure\r\ntowards Downing Street.\r\n\r\nThere was one corner of this sheet which was always a recreation to\r\nDolly in the few moments he could spare from the House: it was the\r\ncorner in which prizes were offered for the best pun, on condition of\r\ncourse that nothing coarse or personally offensive should be sent in\r\nby the competitors. To this he had turned an indifferent eye, when for\r\nthe second time that day he received a shock which was almost like a\r\nblow in the face....\r\n\r\nThere, in great letters, with a flamboyance surely unworthy of a paper\r\nthat professed to support his own Party, was the headline:\r\n\r\n  “DISAPPEARANCE OF A MINISTER ELECT.”\r\n\r\nAnd his forebodings did not deceive him.... It was ... it was ... the\r\npermanently unlucky Demaine!\r\n\r\nHe cursed the crass imbecility by which such a thing could have got\r\ninto the papers at all. He strode to his house and to his room,\r\ncrumpled the paper which he was still holding, unfolded it, and then\r\nread the news again. There were but a few lines of it: Demaine had\r\ndisappeared, and the full detective power of London was attempting to\r\nsolve the mystery of his disappearance.\r\n\r\nWhat madness to let such things get out!\r\n\r\nWhy, twenty things might have happened! He might simply have stopped in\r\nthe house of a friend and not bothered to tell his wife that he was not\r\ncoming home; he might simply have fallen ill and have been taken to a\r\nhospital or to a hotel. What a piece of idiocy to put it into the Press\r\nat all!\r\n\r\nMuch as he hated the exercise, he rang to be put through to Demaine\r\nHouse, and heard from Sudie herself, whom he knew but distantly, that\r\nher fears had done all.\r\n\r\nShe had sat up for George till nearly five o’clock in the morning;\r\nunderrating perhaps her husband’s talents, and notably his ability to\r\nfind his way home, she thought it possible he had fallen a victim to\r\nan unscrupulous taxi driver or that any one of a thousand other fates\r\nmight have befallen him.\r\n\r\nWith too little comprehension of the social forces that build up\r\nthe society of the Mother Land, Sudie had communicated at once with\r\nScotland Yard, and on learning that her husband had last been seen\r\nleaving the House of Commons and walking towards the river, she had\r\ntaken the unpardonable step of sending messages to all the evening\r\npapers in the hope that such publicity would advance the solution of\r\nthe mystery.\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly damnable! As though the cares of his office were not\r\nenough, the Prime Minister found himself upon this Tuesday afternoon\r\nwith a doubtful and anxious division awaiting him in the evening, with\r\none of his Ministers gone mad, and his successor the subject at the\r\nbest of a vulgar mystery, and at the worst of a hopeless disappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phrase “intoxicated with pleasure,” too common in our literature,\r\nwould most inexactly describe the condition of George Mulross Demaine\r\nas he left the Prime Minister’s room upon that Monday midnight.\r\n\r\nIn the first place he was not and never had been intoxicated, and even\r\nwhen he exceeded (as in youth he frequently had) in the matter of wine,\r\nspirits, liqueurs and fancy liquids, the effect of such excess had\r\nrather been atrophy than intoxication. Nor had he ever felt what poets\r\nfinely call the “sting of joy.”\r\n\r\nBut he was pleased: he was very pleased. Thoughts that in another more\r\nvolatile and less substantial brain might have crowded, appeared slowly\r\nseparated one from another and in a solemn procession. They comforted\r\nrather than exhilarated him.\r\n\r\nFirst of all there was the £5000 a year: that was something.\r\n\r\nHe ruminated on that about as far as Cleopatra’s Needle; there, as he\r\nleant upon the parapet of the Embankment and looked down into the\r\nwater, a second thought rose upon the horizon of his mind: the £5000 a\r\nyear would be his, not Sudie’s.\r\n\r\nIn the first stage of this nightly ramble he had barged into two men:\r\none a poor man who had made the accident the excuse for the delivery\r\nof money; the second a rich one who cursed him abominably, but George\r\nwas in too equable a mood to mind. Now, as he left Cleopatra’s Needle\r\nbehind him and strolled still farther eastward, ruminating upon the\r\nfact that the £5000 a year would be his and not Sudie’s, he had the\r\nmisfortune to cannon against yet a third, to whom he apologised: but it\r\nwas a post, not a man.\r\n\r\nHe looked at it with those slow, sensible eyes of his for perhaps\r\nthirty seconds, and saw in large red letters under the electric light\r\n“Motors to the right of this post.”\r\n\r\nHe repeated the phrase mechanically as was often his wont upon reading\r\nanything, and it set up a new train of thought. Post.... The post\r\noffered him was not permanent ... but he considered the careers of his\r\nfriends and he could remember none, neither Ted nor Johnny nor old\r\nBill Curliss, nor Fittleworth nor Glegg, who from the moment they had\r\nreceived such promotion had not gone forward.\r\n\r\nIt always meant something, even when one was out of office, and then\r\nwho knows? One might be in office again. A Party may be in office\r\ntwice running! Stranger things had happened. And then, even if they\r\nwent out of office, Ole Man Benson would have brought something off by\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nLook at it how he would, heaven was smiling on him, and he in return,\r\nand as though in gratitude, smiled at the gaunt front of Blackfriars\r\nStation, opposite which he had now arrived.\r\n\r\nBetween him and it there lay the street, and he was naturally too\r\ncautious to attempt to cross until he had gazed carefully to the front\r\nand right. But at midnight there is no pressure of traffic in the City\r\nof London, and when he had allowed a belated dray and a steam roller\r\nto pass him at their leisure he hurriedly crossed over with a vague\r\nintention of taking the train.\r\n\r\nLike many men of the governing classes, whose mental activities are\r\nnaturally divorced from the petty details of London life, and who are\r\nindependent of that daily round which makes the less fortunate only\r\ntoo familiar with our means of communication, George Mulross Demaine\r\nwas not quite certain where the Underground went to, nor what part\r\nof London precisely it served. But he had been taught from childhood\r\nthat it was circular in form, and that round it like Old Ocean[3] in a\r\nperpetual race, went along streams of trains. Enter it where you would,\r\nand you might leave it somewhere upon its periphery.\r\n\r\nHe knew that St. James’s Park Station was at his very door. He asked\r\nfor and obtained a ticket with that promptitude which distinguishes the\r\nservice of our premier Metropolitan line, left the change for sixpence\r\nby an oversight on the ledge of the ticket window, and then, as Fate\r\nwould have it, turned to the left-hand stairs.\r\n\r\nThe official whose duty it was to examine and to cut designs upon the\r\ntickets presented to him by the public, was that evening (under the\r\nguidance of Fate) most negligent.\r\n\r\nHe should surely have seen that he was dealing with an Obvious\r\nGentleman and should gently have directed him to the opposing platform.\r\nAs it was he did no more than half puncture the cardboard without so\r\nmuch as glancing at it, and George Mulross Demaine (in whom now yet\r\nanother pleasing thought had arisen--that there were such things as\r\nCabinet pensions--) sauntered down on to the platform.\r\n\r\nA train roared in; he stumbled into it just in time to save his coat\r\nfrom the shutting of the gate, and sat contentedly until he should hear\r\nthe conductor shout “St. James’s Park!” But this cue word which would\r\nhave aroused him to action, he was destined not to hear.\r\n\r\nThe Mansion House went by, and Cannon Street, but yet another pleasing\r\nthought having arisen in his mind he noted them not.\r\n\r\nA shout of “Monument” startled him, for he had heard in a general way\r\nof the Monument, and it was nowhere near his home. When he came to Mark\r\nLane he was seriously alarmed, and at the cry of Aldgate East, his mind\r\nwas made up. He got out.\r\n\r\nHe asked with the utmost courtesy of the man who took the tickets what\r\nhe should do to get to St. James’s Park, and the man who took the\r\ntickets replied with less courtesy but with great rapidity that he had\r\nbetter turn sharp to the right and that on his right again he would\r\nfind Aldgate Station, whence there was still a service of trains, late\r\nas was the hour.\r\n\r\nAlas, for the various locutions of various ranks in our society! he did\r\nturn sharp to the right; he went right round the corner into Middlesex\r\nStreet, and to the right again into Wentworth Street, but not a station\r\ncould be seen. The summer night was of a glimmering sort of darkness.\r\nIt was hot, and many of the local families were still seated upon their\r\nsteps, speaking to each other in a dialect of the Lithuanian Ghetto\r\nwhich George Mulross erroneously took for an accent native to the\r\nLondon poor.\r\n\r\nHe stepped up to one and asked whether he were yet near the station.\r\nThe voluble reply “Shriska beth haumelshee! Chragso! Yeh!” illumined\r\nhim not at all, and as he moved off uncertainly up the street, a roar\r\nof harsh laughter tended to upset his nerves.\r\n\r\nHe could not bear this raking fire: he turned, most imprudently, up\r\na narrow court which was in total darkness; and, then at first to his\r\nsurprise but almost immediately afterwards to his grave chagrin, he\r\nfelt a voluminous and exceedingly foul cotton sheet drawn sharply round\r\nhis throat, twisted, the slack of it thrown over his head, and one end\r\ncrammed into his mouth for a gag; almost at the same moment his wrists\r\nwere jerked behind him, a rope whose hardness must have been due to\r\ntar was hitched round them with surely excessive violence, putting him\r\nto grievous pain, his feet were lifted from under him, he felt several\r\nhands grasping his head and shoulders at random, a couple of them\r\nseizing his ankles; he was reversed, and in the attitude described at\r\nthe Home Office as “The Frogs’ March” he felt himself carried for some\r\nfew yards, and at last reversed again and placed face upwards upon a\r\nnarrow and hard surface.\r\n\r\nThrough the filthy cotton which still enveloped his face, the\r\ndisgusting stains of which were dimly apparent to him, he saw the\r\nglimmer of a light, and he heard round him language the accent and many\r\nof the words of which were so unfamiliar to him that he could make\r\nnothing of it. He was incommoded beyond words.\r\n\r\nWhatever his defects, George Mulross Demaine was not lacking in\r\nphysical courage; he begged them in a mumble through the gag that\r\ncovered his mouth, to let him go. There was no direct reply, but only\r\na good deal of whispering, which so far as he could make it out--and\r\nmuch of it was foreign--related to his person rather than to his\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to move betrayed the fact that some heavy body was seated\r\nupon his shins; another attempt to raise the upper half of his body was\r\nmet by so sharp a reminder upon the side of his head that he thought it\r\nbetter for the moment to lie still.\r\n\r\nWhat followed was an examination of his clothes and their contents,\r\nwhich showed his new neighbours to be unacquainted with the sartorial\r\nhabits of the wealthy. The two slits in his cape were taken for pockets\r\nand their emptiness provoked among other comments the shrill curse of\r\na woman. His trouser pockets, wherein it was fondly hoped that metal\r\nmight lie hid, and wherein he would rather have died than have put\r\nanything, similarly drew blank, and to their disgust, of the two little\r\nlines on the waistcoat one was a sham and the other contained nothing\r\nbut a spare stud. However, this contained a small precious stone, and\r\nwas the immediate object of a pretty severe scuffle.\r\n\r\nHe was next reversed yet a third time without dignity, and in a manner\r\nthe violence of which was most wounding: but in his tail pocket was\r\nnothing but a large new silk handkerchief which went (apparently by\r\ncustom, for there was no discussion) to the captain of the tribe.\r\n\r\nPurse there was none, a thing that bewildered them; not even a\r\nportmonnaie, until, to their mingled astonishment and joy, some one\r\nacuter than the rest discovered in a mass of seals at his watch chain,\r\na little globular receptacle which opened with a spring, and revealed\r\nno less than four sovereigns.\r\n\r\nIt was a poor haul, but the clothes remained. Not for long. They were\r\nall removed, and that not with roughness but, he was glad to note,\r\ntenderly: less perhaps from the respect they bore him than from a\r\nconsideration of the value of the cloth. The precise manoeuvre\r\nwhereby the difficulty of the ankles and the wrists was eliminated,\r\nI leave to those of my readers who are better acquainted with such\r\nproblems than I. There are several well-known methods, I understand,\r\nwhereby a man may have his trousers and his coat removed and yet his\r\nhands and feet preserved in custody.\r\n\r\nHis boots (they were astonished to note) were elastic-sided. They were\r\nunder the impression that among the wealthy buttoned boots alone were\r\ntolerated at the evening meal and thenceforward until such hours as the\r\nwealthy seek repose. But they were good mess boots, and take it all in\r\nall, his clothing, every single article of which was soon folded and\r\nput into its bundle, made the best part of their booty.\r\n\r\nThen there was a considerable movement of feet, a murmur of voices\r\npurposely low; there seemed to be one person left, agile and rapid in\r\nmovement ... perhaps two: at any rate after these or this one had held\r\nhim for some thirty seconds, during which he had the sense and prudence\r\nto lie still, there was a sharp sliding of feet, the quick but almost\r\nnoiseless shutting of a door, and he found that he was free.\r\n\r\nHis first act was to disembarrass himself of his stinking head-gear,\r\nbut his captors had laid their trap with science, and it was precisely\r\nthis which was destined to give them the leisure for their escape. The\r\nsheet was tied to his head by a series of small hard knots which took\r\nhim, between them, quite a quarter of an hour to undo.\r\n\r\nAt last he was free. He tore the filthy thing from his head and the\r\nbunch of it from his mouth with the same gesture, overcame a strong\r\ndesire to vomit, and looked round him.\r\n\r\nHe found himself seated upon a sort of narrow bench attached by iron\r\nclamps to the wall of a small and exceedingly noisome room, which even\r\nat that moment he had the wit to think that he would certainly have\r\ndealt with by the local inspector when he should have assumed what he\r\nhad heard called the reins of office.\r\n\r\nBut for the moment other considerations occupied him to the exclusion\r\nof the condition of the room. A dirty paraffin lamp with no shade stood\r\non the rickety table; the one window was blinded by a large old wooden\r\nshutter barred down against it; on the cracked, distempered walls,\r\nstained with a generation of grease and smoke, hung a paper upon which\r\na few figures had been scrawled roughly in pencil, and most of them\r\nscratched out again, and here and there the same pencil or others had\r\ninscribed the surface of the plaster with sentiments and illustrations\r\nmost uncongenial to his breeding.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that met his eye was a peculiarly repulsive pair of\r\nbreeches, an old green-black torn overcoat, and a pair of workmen’s\r\nboots, cracked, grey with weather, laceless and apparently as stiff as\r\nwood. He had no choice: his first business was to find aid. He must put\r\nthese on, break his way out of this den as best he could, and summon\r\nthe Police.\r\n\r\nHe had never had his feet in such things as those boots before; it was\r\nlike shuffling in boxes. He hated to feel the clammy grease of the\r\ntrousers and coat against his skin.\r\n\r\nHe left the lamp burning and made for the door. To his astonishment\r\nthe latch was open. To his further astonishment it gave into an open\r\npassage like a tunnel, with no door but a plain arch opening into the\r\ncourt beyond. He shuffled out. He was glad that it was not yet day.\r\nFortunately it was not cold.\r\n\r\nHe turned, he knew not whither, following the streets aimlessly, but\r\nmore or less in one direction, until he saw in a blotted silhouette\r\nagainst the darkness of the walls, the glad and familiar form of a\r\npoliceman. It was like coming home! It was like making a known harbour\r\nlight after three days of lost reckonings and a gale.\r\n\r\nHe went up to the man and began in that pleasant but not condescending\r\ntone in which he had ever addressed members of the force:\r\n\r\n“Policeman, can you tell me....”\r\n\r\nHe got no further. The agile though weighty custodian of order, with\r\nthe low and determined remark, “I know yer!” had seized him by the\r\nshoulders, whirled him round and away, so that he fell, bruised and a\r\nlittle dazed, against the steps of a house.\r\n\r\nGeorge was angered. He had already risen with some remark on his\r\nlips about taking a number when he saw his antagonist make a sharp\r\ngesture--there was a shrill whistle, immediately afterwards an\r\nanswering whistle from perhaps a hundred yards away, and George Mulross\r\nDemaine,--blame him if you will,--kicked off the impossible boots, and\r\nran for it.\r\n\r\nThey let him run, and it is not for us to criticise. He left their\r\ndistrict at any rate.\r\n\r\nHe had run for but a few moments in his absurd and horrible greatcoat\r\nand on his naked feet, until he saw down the end of an alley a great\r\ngate, a light to one side of it, and beyond it an empty space of\r\nglimmering nightly sky. Ignorant of where he was or what he did, but\r\ndetermined upon safety, he looked round and to his horror saw the form\r\nof yet another policeman pacing slowly towards the place where he was\r\ncrouching.\r\n\r\nThat determined him. With an agility that none of his acquaintances,\r\nnot even his wife, would have believed to be in him, he slunk quite\r\nclose to earth in the shadow of the great gate and entered the open\r\nspace beyond.\r\n\r\nSuch a space he had never seen. Under the very faint light which was\r\nnow beginning to show over the east of heaven, he guessed that he was\r\nupon the river, for he saw masts against the sky and that peculiar pale\r\nglint of water which, even at night, may be distinguished between the\r\nhulls of ships. All he sought was shadow, and the great wharves of the\r\ndocks--for he had blundered into the docks--give ample opportunity.\r\n\r\nHe heard a measured step pacing slowly towards him. He crept along the\r\nedge of the quay into a sort of narrow lane that lay between a row of\r\nhigh barrels and the bulwarks of a big steamship which just showed\r\nabove the stone. He flattened himself against the high barrels which,\r\nhad he been better acquainted with the details of commerce, he would\r\nhave known to contain fishbone manure.\r\n\r\nThe measured tread came nearer; it passed, it reached a certain point\r\nin the distance, it turned and passed again. It reached yet another\r\nextreme of its beat, turned and re-passed.... And all the while the\r\nlight was growing: and as it grew the nervous agony of George Mulross\r\ngrew with it, but more rapidly.\r\n\r\nHe could now just see the figure of the watchman near the gate, he\r\ncould distinguish part of the nearer rigging; in half an hour he would\r\nbe visible to whatever eyes were watching for vagabonds. He knew what\r\nthat meant; further humiliation, perhaps further dangers. There was not\r\na gentleman for miles,--and with that thought the heart of this most\r\nunfortunate of gentlemen beat slow.\r\n\r\nThe reader has been sufficiently told that Mr. Demaine, however solid\r\nthe quality of his brain, was not a man of rapid decision. But agony\r\nand peril are sharp spurs, and as the conception of a gentleman floated\r\nthrough his mind he suddenly remembered that ships had captains.\r\n\r\nUpon their exact functions he was hazy; he would know it better no\r\ndoubt when he had undertaken his functions in the Court of Dowry (the\r\nblessed thought warmed him for a moment even in that dreadful dawn!);\r\nanyhow, the word “captain” meant something ... it wasn’t like a captain\r\nin the army of course ... but then there were captains and captains\r\n... of course the Royal Navy was superior to the Merchant Service ...\r\nbut it was all the same kind of thing--only upper and lower, like\r\na barrister and a solicitor.... For instance there was the Naval\r\nReserve.... And he remembered a captain upon an Atlantic liner who was\r\na splendid great fellow, and he was sure could tell any one at once.\r\nAnd the captain of Billy’s schooner was better than that because he\r\nunderstood about motor engines.\r\n\r\nHe had just come to the point of remembering that on the P. and O.\r\nit was rather a grand thing to dine with the captain, when his mind\r\narrived at its conclusion. He would slip over the side of the big ship,\r\nand when the proper time came he would reveal himself to the captain\r\nfor what he was. The captain would show him every courtesy, he would\r\ngive him a change of clothes, ready-made but decent, he would know\r\nwhere there was a telephone, he would have authority to speak to the\r\nwatchman and the rest, he would send for a taxi, and George’s troubles\r\nwould be over....\r\n\r\nGeorge prepared to slip over the side.\r\n\r\nNow to slip over the side in a book is one thing, but to do it on a\r\nreal ship is another. The bulwarks were high and greasy and salt and\r\nslimy. Demaine was weakened by a night of terrors, and he came down\r\non the hard iron deck of the tramp with a noise resembling distant\r\nthunder, and in a manner that hurt him very much indeed.\r\n\r\nIt was a new misadventure and one that had to be repaired. He heard\r\nvoices and bolted for a large coil of rope which lay beneath the shadow\r\nof the turtle-deck. Here the stench, though somewhat different in\r\nquality from that of the fishbone manure, was not less noisome, and\r\ncarried with it a reminiscence of Channel passages which weakened the\r\nvery soul within George Mulross Demaine. But the sensation was soon\r\nswamped in one much more poignant; this was aroused in him by the\r\napproach of two inharmonious voices, one of which was borne towards him\r\nperpetually clamouring:\r\n\r\n“Yes ah deed!”\r\n\r\nWhile the other repeated as a sort of antiphon:\r\n\r\n“Noa ee diddun, tha silly fule!”\r\n\r\nWhen this dialogue was exhausted the first voice in a lower and much\r\nmore determined tone hissed: “Ah’ll ave im aowt!” and a large stave\r\nwhich might, for all Demaine knew, be a marlingspike or some other\r\nhorrid instrument, began rummaging behind the coil of rope.\r\n\r\n“T’ould man sez ef ah doan catch next ’un ee’ll skin me live!”\r\n\r\nTo this the second voice reiterated his certitude that his companion\r\nwas a silly fool, and that he had had stowaways upon the brain since he\r\nwas last made responsible for the presence of one of these supercargoes\r\nupon the _Lily_.\r\n\r\nThe voices moved away and Demaine, while he breathed somewhat more\r\nfreely, was back again in his former doubt and terror.\r\n\r\nIt grew to be broad day; he heard the rattling of chains; the presence\r\nof men upon every hand made him but the more determined to remain\r\nin his hiding-place until he could approach the Captain in some\r\nmore convenient manner than through the medium of the unfeeling and\r\nill-educated North Countrymen who seemed to compose the crew.\r\n\r\nHe felt the great ship swinging, he could see the patch of cloud in\r\nthe sky of which he had a glimpse, turning as she turned, he felt the\r\nslight throb of her engines; she was passing down the dock, she was out\r\nof the gate--she was almost in the river, when, to his horror ... the\r\ncoil of rope which had been his bulwark against an unfeeling world,\r\n_began slowly to uncoil at the top_, with the motion of some great and\r\nwicked snake that was making for its harmless prey.\r\n\r\nHad George Mulross attained that acquaintance with seafaring terms\r\nwhich is proper to an administrator of this sea-girt isle (and\r\nespecially to a Warden of the Court of Dowry), he would have known that\r\nthe rapidly disappearing coil before him was being used as a warping\r\nrope, and he would have connected the steady clank of the donkey engine\r\nwhich accompanied its disappearance with the absorption of fathom after\r\nfathom of what had been kindly shelter. But even had he known these\r\nthings it is doubtful whether they would have interested him at the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nHe crouched lower and lower as the coil diminished, occupying the\r\nsmallest space compatible with keeping his legs tucked away behind\r\nwhat was left of the cable: but the Gods were deaf that morning to all\r\nprayers. The last eighteen inches of the coil’s height were reached and\r\nstill the pitiless donkey engine clanked, and still the lengths went\r\nslithering away, until at last his back appeared above the element it\r\nlived in,--the unmistakable back of a human being, clothed in a ragged\r\ngreen-black coat.\r\n\r\nTo the trained and piercing eye of sailor-men the object was\r\nunmistakable, and like two cats upon one mouse his acquaintances of\r\nan hour before pounced upon his trembling form: the sceptical one now\r\nconverted and protesting that he had been convinced from the first of\r\nthe stowaway’s presence, the other in cruel triumph dragging him along\r\nthe deck and threatening him with such consequences as not even the\r\npeculiar idiom of the North Country could completely veil.\r\n\r\nWith such energy as remained to him, George sprang up at the first\r\nopportunity they gave him. He had the sense not to run upon those\r\ncrowded and confined decks. The button torn off his coat-collar in the\r\nscramble showed his bare neck and chest. Masses of grime, tar and dust\r\nstreaked his face; his hair was most untidy, and his bootless feet were\r\ncaked in mud.\r\n\r\n“I want to see the captain,” he said between his gasps.\r\n\r\n“Tha wants...!” began his irate captor,--then plain words failed him,\r\nand he took refuge in a few oaths. The other said more quietly:\r\n\r\n“Tha’lt see im, ladd; ow! tha’lt see im,”--and he nodded twice gravely\r\nin a manner which George would have found reassuring had he not already\r\nbegun to suspect that the lower classes were capable of sarcasm.\r\n\r\n“Tha’lt see im!” he suddenly repeated with the utmost ferocity; and\r\ncatching Demaine sharply by the back of the neck he ran him in to the\r\nsemi-darkness under the bridge where, as luck would have it, the first\r\nofficer in a somewhat surly mood was going down off duty.\r\n\r\nI should over-weight these pages were I so much as to attempt the\r\nlanguage of the first officer when he cast eyes upon the unfortunate\r\nfigure before him. A stowaway! It was the second time it had happened\r\nin three months.\r\n\r\nOne stammering attempt to make himself heard so dreadfully increased\r\nthe power of this man’s passion that George perforce was silent. The\r\nfirst officer’s rage rose into a sort of typhoon, and had the law or\r\neven the custom of the sea permitted him to do one quarter of that with\r\nwhich he threatened the poor vagabond, a British ship would certainly\r\nbe no fit place to live in. As a matter of fact when his tirade was\r\nover he confined himself to a general curse upon the town of London and\r\nits inhabitants, to a particular one directed with menace against the\r\nable seaman who had captured the stowaway, and at last, with directions\r\nthat he should be shown to the captain when the ship was in the fairway\r\nand the anxious business of getting her out was over.\r\n\r\nFor some little time, therefore, Demaine still stood a butt for the\r\noccasional but half-exhausted ribaldry of his two guardians, and not\r\nuntil the waterman’s boat had dropped away from alongside and the\r\nwarping rope had splashed into the slime of the Thames, not until the\r\ndonkey engine had clanked once more and got it aboard, horrible with\r\nall the horrors of that water, and not until the engine was going\r\nfairly and the _Lily_ dropping swiftly down the tide, was the captain\r\nready to sit in judgment.\r\n\r\nCaptain Higgins was a man who had made method and self-control the\r\nhinges of success in life. _His_ Caryll’s Ganglia were all right!\r\n\r\nAccuracy in accounts, faithfulness to employers, and strict discipline\r\naboard, were, as he was proud of repeating, his motto. And when he\r\nheard that yet another stowaway had claimed the hospitality of the\r\n_Lily_, he betrayed no unusual perturbation but sat down at his little\r\ndesk, and ordered the prisoner to be brought in.\r\n\r\nGeorge, somewhat hurriedly introduced by both arms between his now\r\nsilent captors, perceived sitting at that table a sight very different\r\nfrom that which he had expected. He saw a very small, thin man with a\r\nlittle pointed red beard and the eyes of a weasel, wearing a well-used\r\nand somewhat dirty peaked cap, upon the front of which was embroidered\r\na coat of arms long indistinguishable, and surrounded by a scroll of\r\ntawdry and threadbare gold braid.\r\n\r\nThis was the individual upon whom Demaine’s hopes of speedy restoration\r\ndepended. He was determined not to speak first, though he was certain\r\nthat the superior education of the officer would pierce through his\r\ninvoluntary disguise.\r\n\r\nCaptain Higgins pulled out a large, official-looking paper divided into\r\ncertain mysterious compartments, each headed with a printed rubric, and\r\nsaid briefly, without looking up and with his pen ready to write:\r\n\r\n“Name?”\r\n\r\n“Demaine,” said George, with all the dignity he could summon....\r\n“But----”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” commanded Captain Higgins sharply, still without looking up\r\nfrom the paper on which he scratched rapidly and in an official manner:\r\n“Mane.” “First name,” he chanted musingly, his pen suspended to write\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n“George Mulross,” enunciated that individual, and “George Ross” went\r\ndown onto the sheet.\r\n\r\nHe began once more by clearing his throat, but though he had not yet\r\nsaid a word, Captain Higgins looked up with such an expression in his\r\nsmall and unpleasing eyes as would brook no nonsense.\r\n\r\n“George Ross Mane,” said he, speaking through his nose. “You have been\r\ndiscovered on my ship, the _Lily_, one thousand three hundred and\r\ntwenty tons burthen, London rating, bound from London to Portland with\r\nagricultural and general cargo.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Higgins loved these formalities.\r\n\r\n“I have no jew-risdiction in the matter....” And here\r\nhe began speaking by rote out of a dirty little book\r\nin which were laid down the elements of his trade:\r\n“Of-breach-of-contract-tort-replevin-stave-jury-or-execution-major-and-\r\nminor-nor-authority-to-act-savin’-always-and-exceptin’-in-such-way-as-\r\nand-whereby-discipline-accoutrement-good\r\norder-_and_-the-fear-of-the-Lord-proper-to-the-navigatin’-of-this-ship-\r\nfrom-her-departure-to-her-port-of-destination-is-concerned-_wherefore_-\r\nyou-shall-be-fed-in-such-manner-as-shall-keep-you-livin’-until-the-next-\r\nport-or-ports-whereat-this-good-ship-may-touch-and-there-delivered-to-\r\nthe-Sheriff-or-his-officers-or-other-justices-of-our-Sovereign-Lord-the-\r\nKing-and-of-his-peace: Take-away-the-prisoner! Gawd-save-the-King.”\r\n\r\nThis sentence, which was delivered in one breath and with the rapidity\r\nof an expert, became towards its close a torrent of syllables ending up\r\nsharp upon the word “King” as upon a bell, and followed by a stinging\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“I demand,” shouted George in an uncontrolled voice over his shoulder\r\nas they dragged him away.\r\n\r\n“Put him in irons!” cried Captain Higgins as loudly as was consistent\r\nwith order, discipline and self-control. “Put the ---- in irons!”\r\nAnd after this natural exhibition of feeling (which in his heart he\r\nregretted) the navigator returned to the bridge, relieved the second\r\nofficer there present, and continued to take his ship down the fairway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a little cubical space with iron sheeting above, below and all\r\nround, and a dirty porthole still streaked with the salt of the sea,\r\nthe prospective Warden of the Court of Dowry sat upon the floor in a\r\ndespondent mood.\r\n\r\nThere was already a slight swell upon the vessel; his dungeon was\r\nfar forward and he felt it to the full. They had brought him some\r\ndetestable mess or other in a battered pannikin at noon. He had sent it\r\naway untasted. Whither they were taking him, what would be his fate,\r\nhad formed for too many hours the subject of his speculations.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the ship was beginning to drive even these gloomy\r\nconsiderations from his mind. He had already discovered two things:\r\nfirst that the term “irons” was a purely conventional one; and\r\nsignified no more than that his harsh treatment might be made\r\nindefinitely severe. Secondly, that he was permitted to communicate\r\nwith an extraordinarily lop-sided boy of some fifteen years who acted\r\nas general drudge in the ship and was deputed to bring him his food\r\nfrom the galley. He was about to discover a third feature in his new\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nA person evidently containing mixed the blood of the Caucasian and of\r\nthe Negroid races approached him in his confinement and ordered him in\r\nbroken English to follow up on deck.\r\n\r\nThe sea air revived him somewhat, but George was far from well when the\r\nhalf-breed, kicking towards him a lump of something which reminded poor\r\nDemaine of a diseased brick, a bucket of dirty water and a large and\r\npeculiarly evil mop, bade him scrub.\r\n\r\nBut George’s first attempts at this new trade were such that his\r\noverseer after looking at him first in astonishment and then in anger,\r\nassured him that any lack of good-will would necessarily be followed by\r\nsome form of physical compulsion, the which, so far as his victim could\r\ngather from the torrent of broken English, would probably consist in a\r\nlarruping with the rope’s end.\r\n\r\nDoggedly and despairingly the poor fellow scrubbed away. He scrubbed\r\nperhaps too hard; at any rate he produced a patch of surpassing\r\nbrilliance though of exiguous dimensions; and as the result of his\r\nefforts turned faint and ill with something worse than sea-sickness.\r\nHe rose from his knees and tottered to his legs, and began aimlessly\r\nswabbing the odd patch of cleanliness with which he had diversified the\r\nbeastly decks of the _Lily_.\r\n\r\nBut the friend and brother (if I may so term the Eurafrican) could bear\r\nno more, and seizing the unstable landsman by the arm he thrust him,\r\nstumbling, down the stairway, and locked him again into his cell.\r\n\r\nThe exhaustion of nature had caused the unfortunate politician to fall\r\ninto a troubled doze, when he was aroused by a gentle kick, and saw\r\nbefore him the boy, the battered pannikin, a piece of bread which had\r\nunfortunately dropped upon the deck aft of the funnel on its way, and,\r\nwithin the tin, a peculiarly loathsome liquid compound upon which, like\r\nthe magic island of Delos, floated at large a considerable glob of fat.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want it,” said George feebly, “take it away.”\r\n\r\nTo his surprise--if surprise is not too strong a word for the faint\r\nemotions that still stirred him, the boy began, as the conventional\r\nterm goes, to look ugly.\r\n\r\n“Na yer dahn’t!” he said, “yer dahn’t gemme inter trouble, yer brute!\r\nYer gort them two Newcastle men inter trouble, and the myte seyes yer\r\nnearly gort im. And yer gort Blacky inter trouble; yer dahn’t ger _me_!\r\nYer gottereatit!”\r\n\r\n“I can’t!” again said George feebly.\r\n\r\n“Yer gottereatit!” repeated the boy, with that dogged assumption of\r\nauthority which so ill fits the young. “By Gawd, if yer get cookie\r\ninter trouble, I’ll ave the next watch dahn an’ they’ll skin yer.”\r\n\r\n“Throw it away,” said George, “there’s a good boy. Throw it\r\noverboard. I’ll make it all right in the long run,” he added, nodding\r\nencouragingly.\r\n\r\nThe boy looked doubtful. “I dursent,” he said sullenly. “Sides which,\r\now’ll yer myke it all roight?”\r\n\r\n“Never you mind,” whispered George mysteriously. “You leave me the\r\nbread--I might try that ... the clean part,” he added after a sudden\r\nwave of nausea--“but chuck the rest, there’s a good lad. I can’t bear\r\nit.” His whisper almost rose to a little scream.... “I can’t bear to\r\nlook at it.”\r\n\r\nThe boy still continued to eye him doubtfully and contemptuously.\r\n\r\n“Yer cawn’t myke it all roight!” he said, but he bethought him that if\r\nthe wretched prisoner could not eat he should catch it from the cook\r\njust the same, and that his own interest lay in the disposal of the\r\ngarbage. He drank a good swill of it himself--he was not over-fed on\r\nthe _Lily_,--went up on deck for a moment,--and George could hear the\r\nsplash as the horror went overboard.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the boy had returned.\r\n\r\n“Yer ought ter be griteful,” he said, “I’ve sived yer a lickin.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said George warmly, with his mouth full. He had found\r\nhimself able to munch the bread, and it did him good.\r\n\r\nThe boy lingered; he took the same interest in the stowaway that he\r\nmight have taken in an animal at the Zoological Gardens, and the\r\nepisode broke the monotony of his fourth voyage.\r\n\r\n“Yer’ll ketch it at Parham!” he said in a cheery tone.\r\n\r\nGeorge did not understand. “Why Parham?” he asked weakly.\r\n\r\n“Coz that’s where they’ll land yer. That’s where they’ll put yer\r\nshore. They’ll ave the cops there roight on the quay wytin for yer,\r\nand they’ll put yer ahverboard in the little dinghy, they wull: they\r\nwahn’t thrah yer bundle arter ye, anforwhoy? acause yer arn’t got none.\r\nBut they’ll send one of th’ orficers and ee’ll and yer ahver ter th’\r\ncops, and ee’ll sye: ‘ee’s been very vilent’--that’s what ee’ll sye;\r\nthat’s what they said wiv the larst un; and they clapped th’ darbies on\r\n_im_ ... saw em meself,” continued the boy most untruthfully. Then not\r\nknowing his man and going a step too far, he continued: “Ee was ung, ee\r\nwas: ung in Lewes Gaol,” he ended, to give the story point and finish.\r\n\r\nThe poor pedantry of maps does not weigh upon the governing classes of\r\nthis country, and Demaine might have had some difficulty in answering\r\nin an examination exactly where Parham lay, but he knew that it was\r\non the south coast, he knew one reached it easily in an hour or two\r\nfrom London, because he had gone to golf there. He knew that there was\r\na good motor track between the harbour and Highcliff, and altogether\r\nParham sounded to him like an echo from now forgotten, dearer, and long\r\ndead days. He affected indifference.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, “it’s all the same to me.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the boy, not ready to relinquish the delicious morsel, “sah\r\nyer sye! Ut wahn’t be th’ syme tomorrermornin’.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean,” said George, with--what might seem in such a man\r\nimpossible--a touch of cunning lent him by adversity, “Do you mean that\r\nthis old tub can make Parham in twenty-four hours?”\r\n\r\n“I dunno bout arhs,” said the boy surlily, “an’ she’s norr a tub\r\neither” (for they have a curious loyalty to their temporary homes),\r\n“but it’s a dy’s run. Any fool knahs that,” he added courteously.\r\n\r\nGeorge dared not betray the hope that was rising in his heart. Luckily\r\nfor him the boy volunteered his next information.\r\n\r\n“We’re orf Long Nahse now,” he said, “but I dunno bout th’ toide\r\noutsoide.”\r\n\r\n“No?” said George, merely desiring to prolong this all-important\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“Nah: I dahn’t, I tell yer!” said the boy defiantly, “nor there’s norr\r\nmany does. I’ll lye yer dahn’t yerself.”\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the conversation and just as an awkward pause\r\ninterrupted it, a new terror struck the boy.\r\n\r\n“Oh chise me!” he said, “look at yer tin!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” asked George as he peered into the empty tin.\r\n\r\n“It’s gorn empty,” whimpered the boy.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said George, his spirits already improved by the news of\r\nParham, “what of it?”\r\n\r\n“Whoy,” said the unhappy scullion, “Whoy, yer cuddenever empty that\r\ntin--they’ll foind me aht!” he said, and began to sniffle. “Wort are\r\nyer to empty it wiv, yer fool? Yer eyn’t got a spoon!”\r\n\r\n“Say I licked it,” said George with attempted humour.\r\n\r\n“They’d blieve ut of yer,” said the boy viciously, “ye’re nothin but a\r\nwoilbeast! Gettin us all inter trouble!” He sniffled. “Ye’re a curse\r\non th’ ship, that’s wort you are, an I blieve she’ll founder. I blieve\r\nshe’ll stroike in th’ noight and go to Ell. _You_’ll be drahwnded,\r\nanyow!” he viciously added as he restrained his tears in prospect of\r\nthe wrath to come.\r\n\r\nBut the thought of safety which the mention of Parham had brought\r\nrevived George, and he bore no ill-will. “Look here,” he said, “I’ll\r\nswab it out with my bread and they’ll think I cleaned it up, but it’s\r\non condition that you chuck the bread overboard,” he added.\r\n\r\nThe boy accepted the pact and was comforted. It was a cheap act of\r\nkindness, but he hoped it might stand him in good stead a few hours\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe June night fell gradually upon the sea, the slight swell dropped to\r\nsomething almost imperceptible. Through his miserable porthole George\r\ncould see great sheets of moonlight playing upon the easy surface, and\r\nthere was no noise but the regular thud of the engine.\r\n\r\nHe fell into a profound sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nAs George Mulross Demaine drifted down river in his cell that Tuesday\r\nafternoon the 2nd of June, Dolly sat blankly in Downing Street with the\r\nwaters of despair at his lips.\r\n\r\nEvil breeds evil.\r\n\r\nAs he considered the gloomy prospect, new aspects of it rose before\r\nhim. Not only was he privately between these two fires, the sudden\r\nmadness of the outgoing Warden, the disappearance of his successor,\r\nbut the retirement of Charles Repton had been publicly announced and\r\nDimmy’s nomination had appeared alongside with it in the morning\r\npapers. The double news was all over England.\r\n\r\nYet another torturing thought suggested itself. How and when should he\r\nfill the vacancy? What was he to do?\r\n\r\nRepton was impossible. His disaster was not in the papers, thank God,\r\nand could not be, under the decent rules which govern our press. But\r\nit was already the chief tittle-tattle of every house that counted\r\nin London. There could be no interregnum with Repton still nominally\r\nfilling the place. He might wait as long as he dared, give it to a\r\nthird man, and then have Demaine turn up smiling and hungry: and if\r\nthat happened the Prime Minister would earn what he dreaded most on\r\nearth, the enmity of those who had been his friends; perhaps a breach\r\nwith Mary Smith herself.\r\n\r\nHe was not fit to do more than survey the misfortune of the moment: he\r\nwas still in his perplexity, when he heard the bell ringing in the next\r\nroom, and was told that he himself was personally and urgently wanted\r\nupon the telephone.\r\n\r\nHe put up his hand but the secretary would take no denial; it was\r\nsomething absolutely personal. Who was it from? It was from Lady Repton.\r\n\r\nIf it can be said of any wealthy and powerful man that he ever betrays\r\nin his features or gait a purely mental anxiety, then that might be\r\nsaid in some degree of the unfortunate Prime Minister at that moment.\r\nHe suffered so acutely that his left lung, the sense of which never\r\nwholly left him, seemed to oppress him with actual physical pain.\r\n\r\nHe took the telephone, dreading what he might hear.\r\n\r\nIt was a trifle less of a blow than he had expected. All he heard was\r\nthe agitated voice of Lady Repton assuring him that she had waited as\r\nlong as possible before troubling him, but that she was now really\r\nanxious, because Charles had not come home. Had he gone in a taxi or a\r\nhansom, or how? It was more than half an hour since the Prime Minister\r\nhad telephoned her, and Charles was always _so_ regular.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps weariness or perhaps a sense that he could do nothing\r\nwhich made the Prime Minister merely answer that he was sure to come in\r\na moment.\r\n\r\n“Repton has been very busy to-day,” he said, “and has had a great deal\r\non his mind. He has become a little unhinged: that is the whole truth,\r\nLady Repton: nothing more. But I think he should be carefully nursed.\r\nPray do not be anxious.”\r\n\r\nThe words faltered a little, for he himself was more than anxious.\r\nHeaven only knew what Repton might not be capable of, until they had\r\ngot him safe behind the four walls of his home.... And after that the\r\ndoctors.\r\n\r\nHe stopped the conversation a little rudely, by taking advantage of a\r\nlong pause to ring off. While he was in the act of doing so a servant\r\nasked him in the most natural manner in the world whether he would not\r\nsee Sir Charles Repton who was waiting below.\r\n\r\nI grieve to record that the young and popular Prime Minister gave vent\r\nto the exclamation “Good God!” For a moment he thought of refusing to\r\nsee him; then he heard coming up through the distances of the official\r\nhouse a cheery voice saying:\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’s all very well for you, you’re a butler with a regular place;\r\nwhen the Government goes out you don’t. You’re a sort of permanent\r\nofficial. But we...!”\r\n\r\n“Show him up,” said the Prime Minister in a qualm, “show him up at\r\nonce. _At once!_” he repeated, losing all dignity in his haste, and\r\ntempted to push the solemn form of the domestic who stalked upon his\r\nmission of doom as majestically as though he were about to announce a\r\nforeign Ambassador, or to give notice.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Charles Repton had entered.\r\n\r\nHe had bought, during his brief odyssey, a gigantic Easter Lily in a\r\nBond Street shop which sells such ornaments. This blossom flourished in\r\nthe lapel of his coat and pervaded the whole room with its perfume.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” he shouted, running up to the horrified Prime\r\nMinister and taking him by both hands, “My dear fellow! Come, no pride;\r\nyou know as well as I do it’s all bunkum. Why, I could buy and sell you\r\nany day of the week. It’s true,” he mused, “there’s birth of course,\r\nbut it’s a fair bargain. Birth gives you your place and brains give me\r\nmine. Do you mind smoking?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Prime Minister, after which he said, “No,--I don’t know\r\n... I don’t care. Why didn’t you go home?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t go home,” said Sir Charles solemnly, and thinking what the\r\nreason was ... “didn’t ... go ... home, because--Oh, I know, because I\r\nwanted to talk to you about that peerage.”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake don’t talk so loud,” said Dolly with real venom in his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n“All right then I won’t,” shouted Sir Charles, “though I really don’t\r\nsee what there is to be ashamed of. You’re going to give me a peerage\r\nand I’m going to take one. You know as well as I do that you didn’t\r\nthink I’d take one and I wasn’t quite sure myself. Mind you, it’s\r\nfree,” he added coarsely, “gratis, _and_ for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” said the unhappy Premier,--\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, I know, that’s the double-ruff dodge. You won’t ask for\r\nanything, but old Pottle will. And then when I come to you and complain\r\nyou will say you know nothing about it. Of course I shan’t pay! It’ll\r\nbe no good asking me; but what I want is not to be _pestered_.”\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister almost forced him down into the chair from which he\r\nhad risen, and said again:\r\n\r\n“Do talk lower, Repton. Do remember for a moment where you are. No,\r\ncertainly you shan’t be bothered.”\r\n\r\n“What else was there?” continued Sir Charles genially, interrogating\r\nthe ceiling and twiddling his thumbs. “There was something, I know,” he\r\ncontinued, looking sideways at the carpet.\r\n\r\nHe got up, walking slowly towards the door, and still murmuring:\r\n“There was something else, I know.” He touched his forehead with his\r\nhand, stood still a moment as if attempting to remember, then shook\r\nhis head and said: “No, it’s no use. It was something to do with some\r\nconcession or other, but I’m not fit for business to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Repton,” said Dolly in a tone which he rarely used and had never found\r\nineffectual, “don’t say anything as you go out, don’t say anything to\r\nanybody. Do get into a cab and go straight home. You promised me you\r\nwould.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll keep my promise,” said Sir Charles with fine candour, “I always\r\ndo. See if I don’t. Look here, to please you I’ll make him drive across\r\nthe Parade here under your windows. There!”\r\n\r\nAnd he was true to his word. He did indeed dig the servant in the\r\nribs as that functionary handed him his hat, his malacca cane and his\r\ngloves, he also wished to see if the butler could wrestle, and he\r\nwinked a great wink at one of the footmen, but he said no word. He\r\njumped into the cab that was waiting for him, and told the driver to go\r\nround by Delahaye Street onto the Parade.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister was cautiously watching from a window to make sure\r\nthat the new incubus upon his life was on its way to incarceration,\r\nwhen he found himself only too effectually assured: for he saw, leaning\r\nout of a hansom which was going at a great pace towards the Mall, a\r\ndistant figure waving its hat wildly and calling in tones that could be\r\nheard over the whole space of the Parade:\r\n\r\n“I’m keeping my word, Dolly, I’m keeping my word!”\r\n\r\nSo went Sir Charles Repton homeward, and a settled darkness gathered\r\nand fell upon the Premier’s heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir Charles did keep his word.\r\n\r\nHe drove straight to his house, enlivening the way by occasional whoops\r\nand shouting bits of secret information very valuable to investors,\r\nto sundry acquaintances whom he recognised upon the way. At one point\r\n(it was during a block at the top of St. James’s Street) he insisted\r\non getting out for a moment, seizing by the hand the dignified Lord\r\nString who had advised the highest personages in matters of finance,\r\nand telling him with a comical grin that if he had bought Meccas that\r\nday on behalf of the Great he had been most imprudent, for there was\r\nan Arab rising and the big viaduct was cut--the first misfortune that\r\nhitherto prosperous line had suffered.\r\n\r\nNear the Marble Arch a change came over him. He felt a sudden and\r\nviolent pain behind the ears, and clapped his hands to the place. He\r\ndid more: when the spasm was over he put up the little door and told\r\nthe cabby; he made him a confidant; he told him the pain had been very\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\nThe driver, who was not sympathetic, replied in an unsuitable manner,\r\nand they were in the midst of a violent quarrel when two or three\r\nminutes later the cabman, who was handicapped by having to conduct his\r\nvehicle through heavy traffic, drove up to the house.\r\n\r\nLady Repton was waiting near the door; she sent out no servant, she\r\ncame out to the cab herself, silenced the rising vocabulary of the\r\ndriver with a most unexpected piece of gold, and tripped up again into\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nSir Charles was philosophising aloud upon the gold band round his\r\numbrella, letting his domestics thoroughly understand the precise\r\nadvantages and disadvantages of such an ornament, when she took him by\r\nthe arm quite gently and began leading him upstairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in Downing Street an indispensable secretary of the name of\r\nEdward was hearing what he had to do.\r\n\r\nEdward had been at King’s, for his father had sent him there. From the\r\nTreasury which he adorned he had been assumed by the Prime Minister,\r\nhis father’s chief college friend, and given the position of private\r\nsecretary; admirably did he fill its functions.\r\n\r\nHe was a silent Welshman, descended from a short line of small squires,\r\nand he comprehended, in a manner not wholly natural to a man under\r\nthirty, the frailties of the human heart. The instructions he received\r\nfrom his chief, however, were of the simplest possible type, and called\r\nfor the moment upon none of his exceptional powers.\r\n\r\nThere was to be no writing and no telephoning: he was to call upon\r\nBowker, because Bowker had the largest specialist experience of nervous\r\ndiseases in London, and therefore in the world.\r\n\r\nHe was to come as from the Reptons, and to give an appointment at\r\nRepton’s house, telling the doctor that he should there find Sir\r\nAnthony Poole. He was to go at once to Sir Anthony Poole, whose general\r\nreputation stood higher than any other medical man’s, to approach him\r\nas from the Reptons, to give him a similar appointment and to inform\r\nhim that he would meet there Dr. Bowker. He was to tell them the whole\r\nsad truth, and beg for a certificate. The unfortunate gentleman could\r\nthen be given the advantages of a complete rest cure.\r\n\r\nHe was next to go to Lady Repton’s at once, and ask her leave to call\r\nupon Dr. Bowker and Sir Anthony Poole. She would give it: the Prime\r\nMinister had no doubt of that. He was to suggest to her the hour he\r\nhad already named to those eminent men. That very evening Sir Charles\r\nwould be certified a lunatic, and one load at least would be off the\r\nPremier’s mind; and a load off his mind, remember, was a load off\r\nhis lung, and consequently an extension of lease granted to a life\r\ninvaluable to the State.\r\n\r\nWithin three-quarters of an hour Edward Evans had done all these\r\nthings. He had even cut matters so fine that the physicians were to\r\ncall at seven, and Lady Repton would telephone the result--she dared\r\ntrust no other agency.\r\n\r\nSo far as a man in acute anxiety can be satisfied, the young and\r\npopular Prime Minister was satisfied, but his left lung was at least\r\none-half of his being as he went back again on his weary round to the\r\nHouse of Commons, and the other half of his being was fixed upon a\r\ncontemplation of his fifty-fifth year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the door of Sir Charles Repton’s house was drawn up an exceedingly\r\nneat brougham, and Dr. Bowker had entered.\r\n\r\nA few moments later there walked up to it the tall strong frame of\r\na man a trifle over-dressed but redeeming such extravagances by a\r\nsplendidly strong old face, and he was Sir Anthony Poole.\r\n\r\nTwo things dominated the conceptions of Sir Anthony: the first the\r\nantiquity of his family, which was considerable; the second a healthy\r\ncontempt for the vagaries of the modern physical science.\r\n\r\nHe was himself as learned in his profession as any man would care to\r\nbe, but his common sense, he flattered himself, was far superior to\r\nhis learning,--and he flattered himself with justice. He was a devout\r\nChristian of some Anglican persuasion; his family numbered thirteen\r\nsons and one daughter. His income was enormous. I should add that a\r\nknowledge of the world had taught him what real value lay behind men\r\nlike Sir Charles Repton, who had stood the strain of public life and\r\nhad found it possible to do such great service to their country.\r\n\r\nThe mind of Dr. Bowker was dominated also by two considerations: the\r\nfirst a permanent irritation against the survival of those social\r\nforms which permitted men an advantage purely hereditary; the second\r\na conviction, or rather a certitude, drawn from clear thinking, that\r\norganisation and method could deal with the cloudy blunders of mere\r\ngeneral knowledge as a machine can deal with dead matter, or as an army\r\ncan deal with civilians.\r\n\r\nDr. Bowker’s birth was reputable and sound; his father had been a\r\ndoctor before him in a country town, and an earnest preacher in the\r\nlocal chapel; his grandfather a sturdy miner, his great-grandfather a\r\nturnkey in Nottingham Gaol.\r\n\r\nHe was therefore of the middle rank of society; but after all, his\r\nsocial gospel such as it was weighed upon him less than his scientific\r\ncreed. He did not _think_: he _knew_. What he did not know he did\r\nnot pretend to know. For the rest he was always a little nervous and\r\nawkward in society, and preferred the communion of his books and an\r\noccasional spin upon a bicycle to the conversation of the rich.\r\n\r\nI should add that he revered Sir Charles Repton not only as all men\r\nof the world must revere a great statesman who has found it possible\r\nfor many years of the strain of public life to be of service to his\r\ncountry, but also as a man of inestimable value in proving that the\r\nsolid Nonconformist stock could do in administration, when it chose to\r\nenter that sphere, what it had so triumphantly shown it could do in\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe two men were shown into an enormous room on the ground floor where\r\nit was the custom of Sir Charles (in happier days!) to receive those\r\nwhom he feared or would inveigle. Lady Repton at once joined them.\r\n\r\nShe was agitated; it was even distressing to watch her agitation. She\r\ndescribed to them the violent pain which her husband had suffered\r\ntwice, first the yesterday evening just before dinner, next at this\r\nmoment on driving up to his house in a cab. She described as best\r\nshe could the situation of these spasms of suffering, and she more\r\nthan hinted that she connected with them a novel and very astonishing\r\ndemeanour on her husband’s part which (here she almost broke down)\r\nshe hoped would justify them in ordering him if necessary with their\r\n_fullest_ authority, to take a rest cure. She warned them that she had\r\ntold him nothing; she had always heard it was wise in such cases. He\r\nthought they had come merely as advisers upon the pains he had felt\r\nbehind the ear, but a few words of his conversation would be enough to\r\nconvince them of that much graver matter.\r\n\r\nShe left them for a moment together, and went to prepare her husband.\r\nShe was a woman of heroic endurance. Her father had been in his time\r\na God-fearing man, and had accumulated a small competence in the jute\r\nline.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Bowker, let it be remembered, was a specialist in nervous diseases.\r\nSir Anthony Poole, let it also be remembered, was not, but he was\r\nsomething infinitely better in his own estimation: he was a man who\r\nhad attended more distinguished people and with greater success than\r\nany other physician in London. Dr. Bowker’s word as a specialist could\r\nnot be doubted. Sir Anthony Poole had only to express an opinion upon a\r\nman’s health in any particular and that opinion became positive gospel\r\nto all who heard it.\r\n\r\nThe medical judgment of no two men given concurrently could carry\r\ngreater weight. By an accident not infrequent in all professions, these\r\ntwo great men, though their rivalry was not strictly in the same field,\r\neach undervalued the scientific aptitude of the other. Each would have\r\ngone to the stake for the corporate value of that small ring to which\r\nboth belonged, but neither would admit the claim of the other to a\r\nspecial if undefined precedence.\r\n\r\nOn the rare occasions when they met, however, they observed all the\r\ncourtesies of life, and on this occasion in the large ground-floor room\r\nof Sir Charles Repton’s house, they sat, when Lady Repton had gone out,\r\nexchanging platitudes of a very attenuated, refined sort, in a tone\r\nworthy of their correct grooming and distinguished appearance. By a\r\nsingular inadvertence they were summoned together.\r\n\r\n“Sir Anthony,” said Dr. Bowker, bowing, smiling and making a motion\r\nwith his hand towards the door.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Bowker,” said Sir Anthony, copying the courteous inclination,\r\nand thus it was that Sir Anthony Poole had precedence, and first\r\ninterrogated Sir Charles Repton alone.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was brief. When Sir Charles had answered the first\r\nquestions very simply, that he had two or three times in the last\r\ntwenty-four hours felt shooting pains behind the ear, he began to speak\r\nin an animated way upon a number of things, and described a humorous\r\nincident he had recently witnessed in the Strand with a vigour highly\r\nsuspicious to so experienced a physician as Sir Anthony Poole.\r\n\r\nSir Anthony asked him what he ate and drank, received very commonplace\r\nanswers, and was twice assured by the Baronet, whose wife had used that\r\nsimple method to deceive him, that he had not for weeks felt any return\r\nof his old complaint, and that he only regretted that Lady Repton\r\nshould have put Sir Anthony to the trouble of calling. He understood\r\nalso that Dr. Bowker had been sent for.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Sir Anthony a little uneasily. “I really imagined that the\r\nmatter would be rather worse than it seems to be. You know it is our\r\ncustom sometimes to call in another....”\r\n\r\n“Yes I know,” said Repton, with a slight smile, “it’s a pity you\r\ncalled in old Bowker. I know he’s very good at nerves or aches or\r\nsomething, but he’s such an intolerable old stick. The fact is, Sir\r\nAnthony,” he said, fixing that eminent scientist with a keen look and\r\nslightly lowering his voice, “the fact is, Dr. Bowker _isn’t quite a\r\ngentleman_.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a little severe,” said Sir Anthony, smiling, “you’re a little\r\nsevere, Sir Charles!”\r\n\r\n“Mind you,” added Repton, “I don’t say anything against him in his\r\nprofessional capacity.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” said Sir Anthony.\r\n\r\n“But there are cases when a man’s manners do make a\r\ndifference,--especially in your profession.”\r\n\r\nSir Anthony beamed. “Well, Sir Charles,” he said, “I’m very glad to\r\nhear it’s no worse,”--and as Sir Anthony went out he muttered to\r\nhimself: “No more mad than I am; but he mustn’t go talking like that\r\nabout other people.” And the physician chuckled heartily.\r\n\r\nDr. Bowker’s introduction to, and private stay with, the patient was\r\nbriefer even than had been Sir Anthony’s. He chose for his gambit the\r\nremark: “Sir Anthony Poole has just seen you I believe, Sir Charles?”\r\n\r\n“Yes he has,” answered Charles Repton in a pleasant and genial tone,\r\n“yes he has, Dr. Bowker, though why,” he added, with a happy laugh, “I\r\ncan’t conceive. After all, if I wanted a doctor for any reason I should\r\nnaturally send to a specialist.”\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Charles had answered the next few questions very simply, that\r\nhe had two or three times in the last twenty-four hours felt shooting\r\npains behind the ear, he then reverted to his praise of the specialist.\r\n\r\n\r\n“If I had any nervous trouble, for instance, Dr. Bowker, I should send\r\nfor you. If I had trouble with my tibia, I should send for Felton.”\r\n\r\nDr. Bowker nodded the most vigorous approval. It was evident that Sir\r\nCharles Repton’s considerable if superficial learning was standing him\r\nin good stead.\r\n\r\n“If I had trouble with my aural ducts I should send for Durand, or,”\r\nhe continued, in the tone of one who continues to illustrate a little\r\npompously, “if my greater lymphatics were giving me trouble, Pigge is\r\nthe first name that would suggest itself.”\r\n\r\nDr. Bowker’s enthusiasm knew no bounds. “You are quite right, Sir\r\nCharles,” he said, “you are quite right.” He almost took the Baronet’s\r\nhand in the warmth of his agreement. “If more men--I will not say of\r\nyour distinction and position, but if more people--er--of what I may\r\ncall the--er--directing brain of the nation, were of your opinion, it\r\nwould be a good day for Medicine.”\r\n\r\n“Now a man like Poole,” went on Charles Repton nonchalantly, “what does\r\nhe know, what _can_ he know, about any particular trouble? And mind\r\nyou, an educated man always knows in more or less general terms what\r\nhis particular trouble is. Why Poole--well....” Here Sir Charles ended\r\nwith a pitying little smile.\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said Dr. Bowker, bursting with assent, “I understand\r\nthe old trouble has not returned. And if it had, as you very well said,\r\nit would be Felton’s job rather than mine. Of course it has a nervous\r\naspect; everything has, but every specialist has his own field.”\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. Bowker went out, communing with himself and deciding that\r\nthe foolish anxiety of wives might be an excellent thing for the\r\nprofession, but was hardly fair upon the purses of their husbands.\r\n\r\n“Well, Sir Anthony?” said Dr. Bowker as he entered the ground-floor\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“Well, Dr. Bowker?” said Sir Anthony with a responsive smile.\r\n\r\n“I really don’t see why they sent for us,” said Dr. Bowker.\r\n\r\n“I thoroughly agree,” said Sir Anthony Poole.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing more to be done, I think?” said Dr. Bowker.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” said Sir Anthony Poole.\r\n\r\n“Shall we speak to Lady Repton?” said Dr. Bowker.\r\n\r\n“We’ll write her,” said Sir Anthony Poole.\r\n\r\nThey took leave of Lady Repton in a solemn and sympathetic manner,\r\nassuring her that it was better to give their impression in writing,\r\nand that she should receive it in the course of that evening. And\r\nhaving so fulfilled their mission, these two eminent men went off\r\ntogether with a better feeling between them than either would have\r\nthought possible an hour before.\r\n\r\n“He is a singularly intelligent man,” said Sir Anthony Poole as they\r\nparted at the door of Dr. Bowker’s Club, “a singularly intelligent\r\nman. Of course one would have expected it from his position, but I did\r\nnot know until to-day how really remarkably intelligent and cultivated\r\nhe was.”\r\n\r\n“I thoroughly agree with you,” said Dr. Bowker, taking his leave, “he\r\nis what I call....” He sought a moment for a word.... “He is what I\r\ncall a really cultivated and intelligent man.”\r\n\r\nThat evening Lady Repton received a short but perfectly clear opinion\r\nsigned by both these first-class authorities, that her husband was in\r\nthe full possession of his faculties, and that it would be the height\r\nof imprudence to set down any extravagance of temper or momentary zeal\r\nupon any particular question to mental derangement or to connect it\r\nwith a slight accidental headache.\r\n\r\nLady Repton in her grievous anxiety (for at the very moment she\r\nread the message she heard Sir Charles talking to a policeman out\r\nof a window, and telling him that it was ridiculous to try and look\r\ndignified in such a uniform), Lady Repton I say, at her wits’ end for\r\nadvice, was bold enough to ring up the Prime Minister whom she hardly\r\nknew, and to tell him all: There was no chance of a certificate; what,\r\noh what should she do?\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister was not sympathetic. He did not desire further\r\nacquaintance with the lady.\r\n\r\nThe Premier’s cup was full. His Warden of the Court of Dowry had\r\nresigned: the new Warden was appointed. The Warden who had resigned\r\nhad gone mad; the Warden whom he had appointed had fled. At least--at\r\nleast he might have been spared the madman! But no, he was not granted\r\neven this! the madman was still loose over London like a roaring lion,\r\ncapable of doing infinite things within the next twenty-four hours.\r\nWhat was a peerage to a madman? What was a Wardenship of the Court of\r\nDowry to a man who was not? The crumb of comfort that would have been\r\nafforded him by locking up the wretched lunatic who was the root of\r\nhalf his troubles was snatched from him.\r\n\r\nIt was enough to make a man cut his throat.\r\n\r\nSo ended that dreadful Tuesday in Downing Street, and all night long\r\nbetween his fits of tortured and horror-stricken sleep wherein his left\r\nlung and his fifty-fifth year were the baleful demons of his dreams,\r\nthe young and popular Prime Minister would wake in a cold sweat and\r\nimagine some new horror proceeding from Repton let loose.\r\n\r\nThe summer night is short. Wednesday most gloriously dawned, and after\r\ntwo hours of attempted slumber under the newly risen light, the Prime\r\nMinister arose, a haggard man.\r\n\r\nThe lines on either side of the young Prime Minister’s mouth had grown\r\nheavier during the suffering of the night.\r\n\r\nHad he been married and had his wife felt for him that affection which\r\nhis character would surely have called forth she would have been\r\nanxious to observe the change. But such is the strain of political\r\nlife and such the ambitions it arouses, that his suffering passed\r\nunnoticed with the majority, and with the rest was a subject for secret\r\ncongratulation.\r\n\r\nHe was down very early. Before he had eaten he went rapidly and\r\nnervously into his secretary’s room and said:\r\n\r\n“Any news, Edward?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said his secretary, looking if possible more nervous than his\r\nchief, “I’m sorry to say there is. The _Herald_ is advertising an\r\ninterview with Repton.”\r\n\r\n“The _Herald_!” said the Prime Minister between his set teeth.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the _Herald_,” answered the secretary, “it really doesn’t much\r\nmatter,” he continued wearily, (he had been up most of the night) “if\r\nit wasn’t the _Herald_ it would be somebody else.”\r\n\r\n“We must pot ’em as they come,” answered the Premier grimly, “and the\r\n_Herald_ won’t publish that interview at any rate.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, let them publish it,” said the secretary.... “I’ll write it if\r\nyou like.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I mean,” said the Prime Minister. “I mean they won’t\r\npublish what people think they will.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Evans, “they won’t.... He’s been shouting out of a window,”\r\nthe secretary went on by way of news.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister groaned.\r\n\r\n“What has he been shouting?” he breathed hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Oh just insults, nothing important, but the police have complained.\r\nAnd late last night he pointed out Betswick, who was a little buffy,\r\nstumbling down the pavement--sitting down, some say--. He shouted from\r\nhis window to a lot of people in the street that it was Betswick.\r\nAnd now Betswick is afraid of going to open the Nurses’ Home this\r\nafternoon.... It’s a damned shame!” ended the secretary, exploding.\r\n“What the devil are you to do with a man ... it’s like--it’s like--it’s\r\nlike an anarchist with little packets of dynamite.”\r\n\r\n“Have you looked at the papers yet, Edward?” asked the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n“Some of ’em,” answered his secretary gloomily.\r\n\r\n“Nothing in the _Times_?”\r\n\r\n“Oh no,” said Edward, “nothing in any of the eleven London papers on\r\nthe official list.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think the others count?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” answered the secretary thoughtfully, “there are the two evening\r\npapers that have been making such a fuss about the Concessions in\r\nBurmah.”\r\n\r\n“Edward,” said the Prime Minister, “it’s a desperate remedy, but take\r\nthe paper you have here, write out a note and get them to lunch. Not\r\nwith me--with you. They’ll come.”\r\n\r\n“Lunch is no good,” said Edward.\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Evening papers go to press in the morning.”\r\n\r\n“Do they indeed?” said the Prime Minister, with the first lively glance\r\nhe had delivered since the beginning of this terrible debacle. “That’s\r\nreally worth knowing! I never knew that.” He gazed into space, then\r\nsuddenly waking up he said: “Why then, Edward, there’s no time to lose!\r\nGo and see them at once. Go and see them yourself, Edward.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t much good,” said Edward. “I know one of them, and the other’s\r\ndotty.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said the Prime Minister, “never mind. Do it somehow. Kill\r\n’em if you must,” he added jocosely, and his secretary went.\r\n\r\nThe Premier left his secretary’s room and mournfully approached his\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nUpon his table a time-honoured device constructed of brass and wood was\r\ndesigned to hold the newspaper while the tenant of that historic house\r\nmight be at meals. Upon this was propped up, open at the leading page,\r\na copy of the _Times_. The leaders were discreet. He found no word from\r\nbeginning to end, save a little note in small type to the effect that\r\nSir Charles Repton would be unable to speak at the great Wycliffite\r\nCongress, he was confined to the house with influenza; a similar note\r\nhe was assured had appeared in all the eleven newspapers upon the\r\nofficial list, and through them would be distributed to the provincial\r\npress; the only thing left to the discretion of their editorial\r\ndepartments being the disease from which the distinguished patient\r\nmight be suffering, which appeared in one as phlebitis, in another as\r\ntracheotomy, and in a third as a severe cold.\r\n\r\nOf Demaine not a word.\r\n\r\nDolly thanked Heaven for the discipline which makes the Press of London\r\nthe most powerful instrument of Government in the world.\r\n\r\nHis thanks were premature; and the gentle, somewhat mournful atheism\r\nwhich was his only creed received excellent support when he saw among\r\ncertain items of news which were laid upon his table every morning,\r\ntwo cuttings from foreign papers which told at great length and in\r\nthe plainest details the whole story of the dreadful episode in the\r\nCity, and connected it in so many words with the scandalous scene in\r\nthe House of Commons. He could only comfort himself by reflecting that\r\nnews which leaked out abroad was rarely if ever permitted to enter the\r\nIsland. He reflected that time is a remedy for all evils, and he made\r\nready for the duties of the day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his secretary, Edward,--to give him his full title, Teddy\r\nEvans--had come to the first of the two offices which it was his\r\nbusiness to visit. It was not yet nine o’clock and there was still time\r\nto cut on the machine.\r\n\r\nAt the Treasury Evans had written regularly for a large evening\r\npaper,--he knew his way about such an organism. He betrayed no undue\r\nhaste, well knowing the subtle delight the menials would have before\r\nsuch a display of retarding his every effort, and when the fat man, Mr.\r\nCerberus, who keeps the door of the _Capon_ offices, had pushed to him\r\na dirty scrap of paper on which he was to write his name and business,\r\nhe quietly asked for an envelope as well. It was given him with some\r\ngrumbling.\r\n\r\nHe wrote his message: “If you have begun machining, stop. I’ve been\r\nsent up here urgently.--E. E.”\r\n\r\nHe closed it, gummed it down, and waited. He had not ten seconds to\r\nwait. A young man who looked and was underfed, a gaunt tall young man\r\nwith hair as long and as dank as the waving weeds of the sea, received\r\nhim with immense solemnity. It was not often that affairs of State came\r\nhis way. One such had come earlier in that very year. It had been the\r\noccasion of his lunching with the exalted individual who now sat before\r\nhim, and he had never forgotten it.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Evans,” he said rather pompously, lifting his left hand and fixing\r\ntwo large burning, feverish eyes upon the secretary, “this place is the\r\nconfessional. Anything you say shall be sacred ... absolutely sacred!”\r\n\r\nBut Evans was cheery enough.\r\n\r\n“It’s nothing of any importance,” he said, “but, well, I’m a great\r\nfriend of the Reptons.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said the editor sympathetically, which was odd, for Evans\r\nonly just knew the Reptons’ address from having to write them letters,\r\nand the Reptons only just knew the look of Evans’ face from having once\r\nhad to ask him to a dinner of an official sort.\r\n\r\n“Well,” went on Evans unblushingly (how valuable are men of\r\nthis kind!), “I am a great friend, especially of dear old Lady\r\nRepton--through my mother,” he added in an explanatory tone, “but I\r\nwon’t go into that. The point is this: the whole family are really\r\ndreadfully concerned.”\r\n\r\n“I know, I know,” said the editor of the _Capon_, still most\r\nsympathetic, and most grave.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Evans with affected ill-ease, “the fact is we don’t want\r\nanything said about it at all--nothing. That’s the simplest way, after\r\nall. It’s a great trouble. You really would do me a personal service,\r\nand they would be so grateful.”\r\n\r\n“By all means,” said the editor of the _Capon_. He turned to a\r\nspeaking-tube upon his right and was about to pull out the whistle,\r\nwhen a violent blast blew that instrument at the end of its chain into\r\nhis face. The editor expressed disgust, and when this expression was\r\nover, asked for the statement. The statement was brought.\r\n\r\n“They’re waiting for the machine, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe editor ran his blue pencil down the list, made a little X against\r\none item, and said: “Bring me a proof of that, will you?”\r\n\r\nA slip of proof came up: it was to the effect that Sir Charles Repton\r\nwas to speak at the Wycliffite Congress and from his candid and\r\nvigorous action of the day before, both in the House and outside it, it\r\nwas hoped that his address would act as a clarion call in the present\r\ncrisis of religion. (“And it would!” thought Edward, all goose-flesh at\r\nthe thought).\r\n\r\n“There’s no harm in that,” he said. Then with sudden thought: “What’s\r\nthe leader about?”\r\n\r\n“The Concessions,” said the editor of the _Capon_, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Evans, “we don’t agree about that, do we?” And he smiled\r\nback.\r\n\r\n“Shall I leave general orders about Repton items during the day?” said\r\nthe editor.\r\n\r\n“Why yes,” said Evans, and then remembering his little subterfuge he\r\nadded: “Don’t print anything unless it’s directly from the family. You\r\nunderstand me?”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said the editor. “Riggles, the sub-editor will be in\r\ncharge after this. I’m going home.”\r\n\r\nHe wrote in a large hand upon a large sheet of paper: “No Repton items,\r\nnot even Press Agency, except from the house itself. F. D.”--for his\r\nname was Francis Davis. “Take that to Mr. Riggles,” he said to the\r\ndevil, and the two men went out together.\r\n\r\nWell knowing that Davis’ house lay in the extreme of the suburbs,\r\nand that he himself was going into the heart of Fleet Street, Evans\r\noffered to give his companion a lift. To his disgust it was accepted,\r\nand he was constrained to drive the editor of the _Capon_ to St.\r\nPaul’s Station; it lost him ten minutes, and those ten minutes were\r\nnearly fatal. For when he had got back at full speed to the offices of\r\nthe _Moon_, the paper had gone to press. The machines were shaking\r\nand thundering away in the basement, and mile after mile of diffused\r\nculture was pouring out in a cataract to feed the divine thirst for\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nIt seemed too late, but Evans went boldly through it all the same.\r\nThe editor was gone, but to the sub-editor he sent in his card and\r\nwrote upon it “From the Prime Minister.” It was a time needing heroic\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nHe asked to see an advance copy. The leader was Repton--Repton--Repton,\r\nnothing but Repton.... Repton had given away the wickedness of modern\r\nfinance; Repton for purposes of his own was prepared to expose the\r\nmockery of our politics; Repton would tell them the truth about the\r\nConcessions; they had a promise of an interview with Repton. What\r\nmotives might have caused Repton to act as he had done they could not\r\ndetermine. It was sufficient for them that Repton, etc....\r\n\r\nThe leader had a title, and the title of the leader was Repton. It had\r\ncoined a new word: the word was “to Reptonise,” upon the model of “to\r\npeptonise.” The _Moon_ threatened to reptonise the whole of our public\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nEvans spent about thirty seconds looking at the floor.\r\n\r\n“Can they stop the machines, Mr. Price?” he asked, for Price was the\r\nsub-editor’s name.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the sub-editor, “Why?”\r\n\r\nEvans walked to the window and looked out into the City street and\r\nsaid without showing his face:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Price, your proprietor is a very valued member of our party.”\r\n\r\nAt the word “proprietor,” Mr. Price changed colour. Yet Evans had not\r\nmeant the proprietor of Mr. Price, he had merely meant the proprietor\r\nof the _Moon_.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Price, I will tell you all” (and he told him more than all!).\r\n“Your proprietor left for Canada during the Easter Recess; he was taken\r\nill in Montreal; he is on his way back, and he will be home next week.”\r\n\r\nMr. Price nodded and at the same time inwardly admired the omniscience\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\n“Now, Mr. Price,” continued Edward, still gazing at the street\r\nopposite, “there is the promise of a peerage. These things are hardly\r\never mentioned, and I tell it to you quite frankly. If that leader\r\nappears,”--turning round sharply--“the peerage will not be conferred,\r\nand your proprietor shall be told that that leader was the cause of it.”\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Evans,” began the sub-editor blankly.\r\n\r\nEvans was suddenly determined. It was astonishing to see the change in\r\nthe man. His conduct and attitude would have seemed remarkable to the\r\nmost indifferent observer: to one who knew that the proprietor of the\r\n_Moon_ had never been, until that moment, within five hundred miles of\r\na peerage, it would have seemed amazing.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Price,” said Evans rapidly and very clearly, “you are in a cleft\r\nstick. If you don’t print your present issue, if you must delay it, it\r\nwill cost your proprietor a heavy sum directly and indirectly. I know\r\nthat. But if you _do_ print it will cost him no money, but....”\r\n\r\nMr. Price thought of the little home at Peckham; of the three young\r\nPrices, of Mrs. Price and of sundry affections that grow up in the most\r\narid and most unexpected soils: he was in an agony as to which course\r\nwould least destroy him: he made one last appeal:\r\n\r\n“May I have it in writing?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not!” said Evans.\r\n\r\n“Very well, Mr. Evans,” said the sub-editor humbly, “I’ll stop the\r\nmachines,” and with a heavy heart he rang the bell.\r\n\r\nThus it was that the _Moon_ came out an hour later than usual, and\r\nthat the leader dealt at so singular a moment with the pestilent\r\nvices of the King of Bohemia, and with his gross maladministration of\r\nSpitzbergen which it summoned to the bar of European opinion.\r\n\r\nThose who have wondered why Edward, without previous training so soon\r\nafter this incident was made a partner of the great bank he now adorns,\r\nwould wonder less if they had been present at that interview.\r\n\r\nThe press was safe.\r\n\r\nThat the agencies were safe went of course without saying. Block A\r\n(as a group of eight papers owned by one man is familiarly called by\r\npermanent officials) had been squared, the day before. Block B, another\r\ngroup of six owned by a friend of his, was for private reasons unable\r\nto publish news of this kind. The _Evening German_ wouldn’t dare, and\r\nthe _Bird of Freedom_ wouldn’t know. The _Press_ was safe so far as\r\nRepton was concerned.\r\n\r\nBut what about Demaine?\r\n\r\nThe _Herald_ had been informed pretty sharply that it was compelled for\r\nunavoidable reasons to postpone its interview with Sir Charles Repton.\r\nThe very paragraph had been written out by Edward, and the _Herald_ had\r\nswallowed the pill.\r\n\r\nBut what about Demaine?\r\n\r\n_That_ had got ahead of them, and there was nothing to do but to wait\r\nuntil Demaine should be found. The very moment that he was found they\r\ncould act and an explanation should be given that would soon cause the\r\nmystery to be forgotten. But a silence still surrounded that unlucky\r\nname.\r\n\r\nNothing had been heard in the Lobbies, nothing from Scotland Yard.\r\nFinally, and more important, Mary Smith herself could tell Dolly\r\nnothing, and if _she_ could not, certainly no one else in London could.\r\n\r\nShe was really fond of her cousin, and for his sake she comforted, and,\r\nwhat was more important, restrained the imprudent Sudie.\r\n\r\nAs for Ole Man Benson, beyond a natural regret that such an asset as a\r\nson-in-law in the Cabinet was still held over as a contingent and that\r\nhe could not for the moment close upon the option, he took the matter\r\nin a calm and philosophical spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh Liberty!” says the Bulgarian poet Machinchose in a fine apostrophe,\r\ntoo little known in this country. “Oh Liberty,” etc.\r\n\r\nNever had George Mulross Demaine known the sweets of that word in the\r\ndays when he enjoyed its privilege to the full. Now, as the brilliant\r\ndawn of that Wednesday awakened him upon the deep he learned the beauty\r\nof Freedom.\r\n\r\nIts meaning saturated his very being as he woke in his miserable cell,\r\nrefreshed but very weak, and saw shafts of the happy morning sun coming\r\nlevel with the dancing of the sea, and making a rhythmic change of\r\nunreal network in the oval patch of light that was cast by the porthole\r\nagainst the filthy rust of the walls.\r\n\r\nHe felt mechanically for his watch and found nothing but bare skin;\r\nthen (such a teacher is adversity!) he to whom induction was grossly\r\nunfamiliar, began to induce away like any child of Nature.\r\n\r\nThe sunlight was level, for the image of the porthole upon the wall was\r\nbut little lower than the porthole itself:--therefore the sun had but\r\njust risen.\r\n\r\nIt was June, therefore if the sun had but just risen the hour was very\r\nearly: how early he certainly could not have answered if you had asked\r\nhim a week ago, but adversity, that admirable schoolmistress, was\r\ndeveloping the mind of George Mulross as the blossom of a narcissus\r\ndevelops under the first airs of Spring, and he was capable of\r\nremembering a sunrise after the ball at the Buteleys’, and another\r\nafter a big supper at Granges’. He was in bed before half-past five on\r\neach occasion. It must therefore be between four and five o’clock.\r\n\r\nThe term “solstice” was unfamiliar to this expectant member of the\r\nBritish Executive, but he seemed to remember that somewhere about this\r\ntime of year the nights were at their shortest.\r\n\r\nHe was full of a new pride as he made these discoveries. Then two\r\nthings struck him at once: the first that he was ravenously hungry, the\r\nsecond that all motion of the ship had ceased. He heard no sound of any\r\nkind except the gentle lapping of the tiny waves alongside, for it was\r\ncalm except for the little breeze of morning.\r\n\r\nHe attempted with his new-found powers to pass the time in further\r\ninduction, to guess by the position of the light how the ship lay, but\r\nas he had forgotten at which end of a ship the anchor is let go, and as\r\nhe had no notion of the tide in the English Channel, nor even whether\r\ntides ran for six hours or twelve (he was sure it was one of the two),\r\nand as, in general, he was grossly ignorant of the data upon which\r\nsuch an induction should proceed, the effort soon fatigued him. He was\r\ncontent to prop himself up against the wall and crave for food.\r\n\r\nHe heard a step outside, he struck the door with his fist. To his\r\ndelight a key turned in it, and the doubtful visage of the boy once\r\nmore appeared. Early as was the hour, and divine the weather, the boy\r\nwas still gloomy.\r\n\r\n“Gettin’ us inter more trouble, orl on us, yer dirty skunk!” was his\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I’m very sorry,” said George. “I only knocked because I’m so\r\nterribly hungry. Can’t you get me something to eat?”\r\n\r\n“Yus,” said the boy thoughtfully, “I dahn’t think! Yer’d myke me chuck\r\nit. Yer’s particler as a orspital nuss,” he added, with a recollection\r\nof a brazen woman in gaudy uniform whom a kind lady had thrust upon his\r\nmother’s humble home just before he had gone aboard.\r\n\r\nDemaine was in acute necessity. “Look here,” he said, “get me some\r\nbread.”\r\n\r\n“Whaffor?” asked the boy.\r\n\r\nDemaine nodded mysteriously, and once again was his gaoler torn between\r\na desire for some ultimate gain and the certitude that no present gain\r\nwas obtainable.\r\n\r\nHe was a London lad, with all the advantages that London birth implies,\r\nand it had already occurred to him that Demaine’s accent, manner and\r\ncuticle differed in a strange way from those of your stock stowaway.\r\nHe had been impressed in the matter of the food; he was more impressed\r\nby certain little turns of language which he associated with those\r\nhateful, but, as he had been told, wealthy people, who came down and\r\ndid good amid his mother’s neighbours in the East End; and when he\r\nhad thought it well over and tamed his prisoner further by one more\r\nwell-chosen epithet, he went off and came back with a hunk of bread.\r\n\r\n“Yer lucky,” he said as he returned, “thet yer on a short trip.\r\nOtherwyes t’d uv been biscuit....” Then he added, “and gryte wurms in\r\nut!”\r\n\r\nGeorge did not reply. He bit into the bread in ecstasy, and his eyes,\r\nwhich his acquaintances in London commonly discovered to be lifeless,\r\npositively gleamed upon this summer morning.\r\n\r\n“They gotter communicyte wiv the orfferities fust,” said the boy\r\npompously.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said George with his mouth full.\r\n\r\n“Ho! yus, it is!” sneered the boy, who thought there was something of\r\nthe toff in this use of the simply affirmative. “An’ after that they’ll\r\nland yer, and yer’ll ave the darbies on afore breakfast-toime.” He\r\nadded nothing this time about hanging. The details of the moment were\r\ntoo absorbing.\r\n\r\n“How do you mean ‘communicate’?” asked George carelessly and all ears.\r\n\r\n“Woy, wiv a flag, that’s ow,” said the boy.\r\n\r\nDemaine had often been told of the long and complicated messages which\r\nlittle pieces of bunting could convey, and he had himself presented to\r\na country school a whole series of flags which, in a certain order,\r\nsignified that England expected every man to do his duty. But he could\r\nnot conceive how so complete a message as the presence and desired\r\narrest of an unfortunate stowaway could be conveyed to the authorities\r\nashore by any such simple means, unless indeed the presence of\r\nstowaways was so common an occurrence that a code signal was used for\r\nthe purpose of disembarking that cargo.\r\n\r\nThe boy illumined him.\r\n\r\n“They got th’ flag up,” he said, “syin’ ‘Send a baht,’ and when they\r\nsees it they’ll run up one theirselves--then’s yer toime.”\r\n\r\nBut the boy’s information, as is common with the official statements of\r\ninferiors, was grossly erroneous.\r\n\r\nA voice came bawling down from above, ordering him to tumble up with\r\nthe prisoner.\r\n\r\nTumble up George did; that is, he crawled up the steep and noisome\r\nladder, and as he put his head out into the glorious air, thought that\r\nnever was such contrast between heaven and hell. He drank the air and\r\nput his shoulders back to it, to the risk of the green-black coat.\r\n\r\nGeorge Mulross was one of those few men who have never written verse,\r\nbut he was capable that moment if not of the execution at least of the\r\nsentiment which the more classical of my readers are weary of in Prom.\r\nVinc. Chor. A. 1-19, Oh the god-like air! The depth and the expanse of\r\nsky!\r\n\r\nThe fatherly sky was all light, the sun was climbing, and a vivid\r\nbelt of England lay, still asleep, green and in repose under that\r\nbeneficence; and in the midst of it, set all round with fields, lay a\r\nlovely little town. It was Parham.\r\n\r\nDemaine had once or twice noted how strangely glad the houses of men\r\nseem from off the sea, but as he was familiar rather with Calais and\r\nDover, with Ostend, Folkestone and Boulogne than with other ports, and\r\nas he had more often approached them in winter weather than in the\r\nLondon season, there was something miraculously new to him in this\r\nvision which had been the delight of his forefathers: England from the\r\nsummer sea.\r\n\r\nThe clear spirit bubbling within him encountered another and muddier\r\nbut forceful current as his eyes fell upon the first officer.\r\n\r\nThat individual surveyed him with hatred but did not deign to throw\r\nhim a word. He bade the lad stand by George in a particular place upon\r\nthe deck till he should be sent for; he next threatened several of the\r\nboy’s vital organs if his prisoner were not properly kept in view, and\r\nhaving pronounced these threats, lurched away.\r\n\r\n“Th’ old man’ll want yer soon, ter fill in is sheet,” said the lad\r\nby way of making conversation. “Myebe ee’ll ave ye larrupped, myebe\r\nee wahn’t. Ee didn’t the larst un,” he put in as an afterthought,\r\nas though it were the custom to larrup some seven stowaways out of\r\neight by way of parting, and to make capricious exception of certain\r\nfavourites.\r\n\r\n“Yer’ll ave to tyke thut sheet wiv yer; leastwyes whoever’s in charge\r\nof the baht’ll ave ter, an thye gives ut to th’ cops, and th’ cops\r\nshahs ut to the beak. As to do ut, to ave everyin roight and reglar.\r\nOtherwyes they cudden put yer awye--and they’re bahnd ter do that: not\r\narf!”\r\n\r\nBut Demaine was not heeding the discomforting comment of his warder. He\r\nwas balancing in his mind the poor chances of the morning, and as he\r\nbalanced them they seemed blacker with every moment.\r\n\r\nThe shore was perhaps half a mile away: the hour say five, perhaps\r\nhalf-past. By six, or half-past six at the latest, the earliest people\r\nin Parham would be astir.\r\n\r\nThe fixed inveterate hope of the governing class that a gentleman can\r\nalways get out of a hole, had dwindled within him to that dying spark\r\nto which it dwindles during invasions and at the hour of death.\r\n\r\nHe did not trust his accent, he did not trust his skin, he did not\r\ntrust his parentage, he did not trust his wealth--alas, his former\r\nwealth!--to speak more accurately, his wife’s former wealth,--to speak\r\nstill more accurately, the former wealth of his wife’s father.\r\n\r\nHe trusted nothing but blind chance, his muscles and flight.\r\n\r\nHe hated the vision which was in immediate prospect of the little\r\nweasel-faced captain with his pointed red beard, reciting by rote\r\nyet another string of idiotic sentences from a manual; he hated the\r\nvision of the next step, the men in blue, with their violence and their\r\nclosing of his mouth by brutal means. Whether he could convince a\r\nmagistrate he did not pause to inquire. The way was too long--it was a\r\ndark corridor leading to Doom.\r\n\r\nHe heard a second voice calling the boy to the accompaniment of oaths\r\nquite novel and individual and in a high voice that he had not yet\r\nheard, and he thought that his hour had come.\r\n\r\nBut the boy’s reply undeceived him.\r\n\r\n“Oi dursn’t!” he yelled down the decks, “Oi gotter look arter th’\r\nSkunk.”\r\n\r\nApparently, thought George bitterly, he already had a fixed traditional\r\nname aboard the _Lily_, like Blacky and the Old Man.\r\n\r\nThe cook, for it was he, emerged from the galley aft, stood in the\r\nbrilliant sunlight and delivered rapid blasphemy with tremendous\r\nvelocity and unerring aim.\r\n\r\nThe boy whimpered and was irresolute.\r\n\r\nIf the threats of the mate had been less practical, those of the cook\r\nmight have had less effect, but between the prospect of the excision of\r\nhis liver and of a series of hearty buffets and mighty kicks endways,\r\nwhat reasonable youth would hesitate in a civilisation such as ours?\r\n\r\nThe boy faltered visibly, and turning upon the Skunk informed him once\r\nagain that he was always gettin’ people inter trouble. Nay, more, he\r\nthreatened to pay out the innocent cause of his despair for the divided\r\nduty in which he found himself.\r\n\r\nThe cook re-emerged; he had fixed on a new belt of ammunition and began\r\nfiring in a manner if possible more direct and devastating and quite as\r\nrapid, as that which had distinguished the first volley. And the boy,\r\nwho was, after all, more directly the servant of the cook than of any\r\none else on board, wavered and broke. With a clear statement of the\r\nconsequences should Demaine move an inch from the spot, and a promise\r\nto return before a man could spit to leeward, the boy dashed off to\r\nthe galley, and for perhaps five seconds, perhaps ten, the prospective\r\nWarden of the Court of Dowry was free.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the human mind, says Marcus Aurelius (imitative in this\r\nsentence, as in most of his egregious writings), resembles that of a\r\nserpent.\r\n\r\nThere are serpents and serpents. Minds of Demaine’s type move commonly\r\nwith the motion of a gorged python but just roused from sleep; but\r\neven the python will, under compulsion, dart,--and, in those five\r\nseconds, not reason but an animal instinct drove the politician’s soul.\r\n\r\nHe was up, on to the bale, over the bulwark and down ten feet into the\r\nsea, before he had even had time to formulate a plan. He could swim,\r\nand that was enough for him.\r\n\r\nThe splash made by Demaine’s considerable form as it displaced in an\r\namount equal to his weight the waters of the English Channel, came to\r\nthe ears of the Watch, who was leaning comfortably over the farther\r\nrailing at the other end of the vessel, looking out to seaward and\r\nruminating upon a small debt which he had left behind him in the parish\r\nof Wapping. With no loss of dignity the Watch shuffled forward to see\r\nwhether aught was displaced. The splash had been a loud one, but it\r\nmight have been something thrown from the galley.\r\n\r\nHe first of all looked carefully over the starboard bow to seaward.\r\nThere was no foam upon the water: everything was still. It occurred to\r\nhim to cross the deck; he did so in a leisurely manner and thought he\r\nnoted far down the side, and already drifting astern with the tide, a\r\nrapidly disappearing ring of foam. He was a stupid man (though I say\r\nit that shouldn’t, for he came from Bosham, noble and fateful Mistress\r\nof the Sea), and he looked at the ring of foam in a fascinated manner,\r\nconsidering what could have caused it, until he was roused to life and\r\nto his duties by the thunder of the first officer who from the bridge\r\ndemanded of him in perfectly unmistakable language what he had done to\r\nthe Skunk.\r\n\r\nThe sense of innocence was so strong in the honest seafaring soul that\r\nhe replied by a simple stare which almost gave the first officer a fit,\r\nand in the midst of the language that followed, the boy, positively\r\npale with fear, came tearing from the galley and found, not his charge,\r\nbut the Bosham man gazing like a stuck pig at his superior above, and\r\nat the world in general.\r\n\r\nThe reappearance of the boy was a welcome relief to the chief officer’s\r\nlungs and intelligence; it added fuel to his flame. He very nearly\r\nleapt down from the bridge in his paroxysms of wrath, and heaven only\r\nknows what he would have done to the wretched lad whom he would render\r\nresponsible for the misadventure had he not at that moment caught sight\r\nof a little speck upon the sunlit water far astern: it was the head of\r\nGeorge Mulross Demaine, battling with fate.\r\n\r\nThe prospective Warden of the Court of Dowry could swim fairly well.\r\nIt had been his practice to swim in a tank. He had swum now and then\r\nnear shore, but he had no conception of the amount of salt water that\r\ncan get into a man’s mouth in a really long push over a sea however\r\nslightly broken, especially if one enters that sea in a sort of bundle,\r\nwithout taking a proper header. Moreover, the phenomenon of the tide\r\nastonished him; he had imagined in his innocence that the sea also was\r\na kind of tank and that he had a dead course of it for the shore, the\r\nnearest point of which lay just eastward of the harbour mouth.\r\n\r\nAs it was, England seemed to be flitting by at a terrible rate, and\r\nthe _Lily_, when he turned upon his back and floated for a moment to\r\nobserve her, had all the appearance of a ship proceeding at full speed\r\nup Channel, so rapidly did he drift away.\r\n\r\nHe swam too hurriedly and he exhausted himself, for his mind was full\r\nof terrors: they might fire upon him--he did not know what dreadful\r\narsenal the _Lily_ might not contain!\r\n\r\nHe remembered having noticed upon the cross-Channel steamers\r\nexceedingly bright little brass guns, the purpose and use of which had\r\noften troubled him. Now he knew!--and he hoped against hope that no\r\nsuch instrument of death swivelled upon the poop of the _Lily_.\r\n\r\nHe dreaded every moment to catch the sharp spit of flame against the\r\nsunlight, a curl of smoke, the scream of the light shell, the ricochet,\r\nthe boom that would come later sullenly upon the air, and all the rest\r\nthat he had read of:--the first shot to find the range: the dreadful\r\nsecond that would sink him.\r\n\r\nHe was relieved, as minute after minute passed, and no such experiment\r\nin marine ballistics was tried. There was faintly borne to his ears\r\nas he was swept down the ceaseless stream of Ocean, a little clamour\r\nwhich, on the spot itself, was a roaring babel; he saw a group of men\r\nwrestling with the davits, but the davits were stiff, and boat-drill\r\nwas not in the programme of the _Lily_. Indeed of all the crew but two\r\nhad ever handled such a contrivance as a davit before, and of these one\r\nwas an Italian.\r\n\r\nAnother man than Captain Higgins would have been profoundly grateful\r\nto see the stowaway drown; not so that conscientious servant of the\r\nFirm. The stowaway received such food and lodging as had kept him\r\nliving until such time as he could be handed over to the Sheriff or\r\nhis officers or any other servants or justices of our lord the King,\r\nwho were competent to deal with breach of contract, tort, replevin and\r\ndemurrer. The stowaway was responsible to the Law, and Captain Higgins\r\nwas responsible for the stowaway; therefore must a boat be lowered. And\r\nbecause there was something grander in swinging out the davits in full\r\nview of a British town and harbour than in chucking the dinghy into the\r\nwater, swing out the davits he would,--and he lost ten minutes over\r\nit--ten precious minutes during which the tide had carried the little\r\nspeck that was the head of George Mulross Demaine almost beyond the\r\npower of his spyglass.\r\n\r\nCaptain Higgins capitulated; he left the davits as they were--one stuck\r\nfast, the other painfully screwed half round, a deplorable spectacle\r\nfor the town of Parham, and one shameful to the reputation of the\r\nsailor-men aboard the _Lily_, and he ordered the little dinghy out over\r\nthe side.\r\n\r\nThey unlashed her and let her down. Two men tumbled into her, the\r\nsecond officer took command, and they rowed away down tide with all the\r\nvigour that Captain Higgins’ awful discipline could inspire, directed\r\nin their course by his repeated injunctions and proceeding at a pace\r\nthat must surely at last overhaul the fugitive.\r\n\r\nWhen Demaine heard the beat of the oars and again floated to look\r\nbackwards, he estimated the distance between himself and the shore and\r\ngave himself up for lost. Now indeed there could be no doubt of the\r\nrope’s end! He could not disappear like a whale for any appreciable\r\ntime beneath the surface; the tales he had read (and believed) of\r\nheroes in the Napoleonic and other wars, who themselves, single-handed\r\nand in the water, had fought a whole ship’s crew with success, he\r\nnow dismissed as idle fables. There was nothing left for him but,\r\nsomewhat doggedly, to continue the overhand stroke, for now that he\r\nwas discovered there was no point in the slower breast stroke that had\r\nhelped to conceal him. They were making (as they said in the days of\r\nthe Clippers) perhaps three feet to his one, but freedom is dear to the\r\nhuman heart, and he pegged away.\r\n\r\nThe Shining Goddesses of the Sea loved him more than they loved the\r\nodious denizens of the _Lily_; they set the tide in shore, and the Sea\r\nLady, the Silver-Footed One, led the little waves along in his favour.\r\n\r\nHe had come to a belt of water where the tide set inward very rapidly,\r\nalong a gulley or deep of the shore water. It was a godsend to him, for\r\nhis pursuers were still in the outer tide. He was now not a quarter\r\nof a mile from the water-mark, and still going strong, with perhaps\r\ntwo hundred yards between the boat and him; he could not feel their\r\nhot breath upon his neck, but he could hear the rhythmic yell of the\r\nofficer astern, criticising the moral characters of his crew with a\r\nregular emphatic cadence that followed the stroke of the oars ... when\r\nhis cold, numbed right foot struck something; then his left struck\r\nsand: ... It was England! And the English statesman, like Antæus, was\r\nglad and was refreshed.\r\n\r\nHe stumbled along out of it--the water on the shelving sand was here\r\nnot three feet deep. He stumbled and raced along through the splashing\r\nwater. It fell to his knees, to his shins, to his ankles, and he was on\r\ndry land!\r\n\r\nA very pretty problem for the amateur tactician learned in the matter\r\nof landing-parties, was here presented. The dinghy must ground far out:\r\nshe could not be abandoned; it was an even race, and his pursuers would\r\nbe one man short from the necessity of leaving some one in a boat which\r\nhad grounded too far out for beaching.\r\n\r\nSome such combination occurred in a confused way to Demaine, but\r\nhe had no time for following it up. He did what he had done more\r\nthan once in the last unhappy days--he ran. His numbed feet suffered\r\nagonies upon the shingle above the sand, but he ran straight inland,\r\nhe crossed a rough road, went stumbling over a salted field, and made\r\nfor a wind-driven and scraggy spinney that lay some half a mile inland,\r\ndefying the sea winds. As he approached that spinney he saw two men\r\nfrom the boat just coming full tilt over the ridge of the sea road; as\r\nhe plunged into it they were in the midst of the field beyond.\r\n\r\nThe undergrowth in the spinney was thick, but Demaine had the sense to\r\ndouble, and he crept cautiously but rapidly along, separating the thick\r\nbranches as noiselessly as he could, and bearing heroically with the\r\ninnumerable brambles that tore his flesh. He halted a moment to look\r\nthrough a somewhat thinner place towards the field, and there, to his\r\nconsiderable astonishment, he perceived the two sailor-men dawdling\r\nalong in amicable converse and apparently taking their time, as though\r\nthey were out upon a holiday rather than in the pursuit of a criminal.\r\n\r\nIt dawned upon George that there was a reason for this: the second\r\nofficer could not leave the boat. The boat and the sea were hidden by\r\nthe ridge of the sea road, and the longer the time the hearty fellows\r\ncould spend ashore, the greater their relief from labour and their\r\nenjoyment of a pleasant day. He saw them sauntering towards the\r\nspinney; they took sticks and beat it in a sort of aimless, perfunctory\r\nmanner, poking into the brushwood half-heartedly here and there, as\r\nthough Demaine had been a hare whom they desired to start from its\r\nform. They wandered off along the edge of the wood in a direction\r\nopposite to his own, and paused a moment to light their pipes upon\r\ntheir way.\r\n\r\nIt was a peaceful scene: but a moment would come when that scene could\r\nnot be prolonged, and when their activity must be renewed. Demaine,\r\ntherefore, pushed through the brushwood, still going as noiselessly as\r\nhe could, and came out to the landward side of it upon a disused lawn.\r\n\r\nThe grass was brown and rank and trampled. It had not been mown that\r\nseason. An old sun-dial stood in the midst of it; a wall bounded it\r\nupon two sides, and there was the beginning of a gravel path. He\r\nfollowed that path between two rows of rusty laurels, and round a sharp\r\nturn came upon the house to which this derelict domain belonged. He\r\ncame upon it suddenly.\r\n\r\nIt stood low and had been masked from him by a belt of trees. He saw\r\na little back door, and,--fatal as had such reasoning been in his\r\nimmediate past,--he reasoned once more: that where there was a house\r\nwith servants’ offices, there would be a difference of social rank,\r\nthere would be education, there would be understanding, and he must\r\ncertainly come into his own.\r\n\r\nHis bleeding feet, the soaked rags that clung upon him, his hair\r\nhanging in absurd straight lines clogged with salt, would, could he\r\nhave seen them in a looking-glass, have given him pause. But the\r\nexhaustion of these terrible hours was now upon him; the heat of the\r\nsun was increasing,--he was under an absolute necessity for food and\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nHe boldly opened the door and went in.\r\n\r\nHe found himself in a little room of which this door was evidently the\r\nprivate communication with the garden; it was a room that lifted his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it was lined everywhere with books, and though he\r\nhimself had read perhaps but eighteen volumes in the whole course of\r\nhis early manhood, yet a room lined with books justly suggested to\r\nhim cultivation, leisure, and a certain amount of wealth. A volume\r\nwas lying with its flyleaf open upon the table. He saw pasted in it\r\na book-plate in the modern style, made out in the name of Carolus\r\nMerry Armiger. Mr. Armiger, it seemed, was his unsuspecting host. Mr.\r\nArmiger’s literary occupations did not interest George Mulross; such as\r\nthey were he gathered them to have some connection with the Ten Lost\r\nTribes.\r\n\r\nManuscripts were lying upon the table, manuscripts consisting of long\r\ndouble lists of names with a date between them. The Jewish Encyclopedia\r\nwas ranged in awful solemnity before these manuscripts; the Court\r\nGuides, reference books and almanacs of London, Berlin, New York,\r\nFrankfort, Paris, Rome and Vienna, were laid ready to hand, and sundry\r\nslips detailing the family origins and marital connections of most\r\nEuropean statesmen, including of course our own, completed the work\r\nupon which the chief resident of the house appeared to be engaged.\r\n\r\nForgetting the deplorable condition in which he was, a big scarecrow\r\nreeking and dripping salt water from sodden black rags that clung to\r\nhis nakedness, George Mulross sank into a large easy-chair and breathed\r\na sigh of profound content.\r\n\r\nThey might look as long as they chose, he thought they would look for\r\nhim in vain! His pursuers did not know who he was nor that he had come\r\nback into his own rank of life again and had certainly found, though\r\nthey were as yet unknown to him, equals who would as certainly befriend\r\nand protect him.\r\n\r\nHe pictured the scene to himself:--the owner of the house enters--he is\r\nwearing spectacles, he is a busy literary man, a professor perhaps--who\r\ncould tell?--a learned Rabbi! The papers and the books upon the table\r\nseemed to concern the Hebrew race. At any rate, a literary man--a solid\r\nliterary man. He would come in, preoccupied, as is the manner of his\r\ntribe, he would look fussily for something that he had mislaid upon the\r\ntable, his eyes would light upon the form of George Mulross Demaine. At\r\nfirst sight he would be surprised. A man partially naked, glistening in\r\nthe salt of the sea, his hair falling in absurd straight wisps clotted\r\nwith damp, his face a mixture of grime and white patches where the\r\nwater had washed it, his nails a dense black, his bare feet bleeding,\r\nwould stand before him. But this strange figure would speak a word, and\r\nall would be well. He would say:\r\n\r\n“Sir, my name is Demaine. You are perhaps acquainted with that name. I\r\nbeg you to listen to me and I will briefly tell you,” etc. etc.\r\n\r\nThe literary man would be profoundly and increasingly interested as the\r\nnarrative proceeded, and at its close a warm bath and refreshment of\r\nthe best would be provided, a certain deference even would appear in\r\nhis host’s manner when he had fully gathered that he was speaking to a\r\nCabinet Minister, and from that moment the unhappy business would be no\r\nmore than an exciting memory.\r\n\r\nAs George Mulross so mused he rose from his chair and was horrified to\r\nnote that there stood in the hollow of it little pools of salt water,\r\nthat the back was dripping wet, and that where his feet had reposed\r\nupon the Axminster carpet damp patches recalling the discovery of the\r\nMan Friday, the marks of human feet, were clearly apparent.\r\n\r\nEven as he noted these things and appreciated that they would\r\nconstitute some handicap to his explanation, he heard voices outside\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nAlas, they were not the voices of the governing classes, they were\r\nnot the voices of refinement and leisured ease. Oh! no. They were the\r\nvoices of two domestics engaged in altercation, the one male, the\r\nother female; and the latter, after affirming that it was none of her\r\npartner’s business, evidently approached the door of the room in which\r\nhe was.\r\n\r\nFor a moment his heart stopped beating. He heard her hand upon the\r\nouter handle of the door; by what form of address could he melt that\r\nuncultivated heart? Those bitter hours of his just passed had filled\r\nhim with a mixture of terror and hatred for such English men and women\r\nas work for their living. He had always regarded them as of another\r\nspecies: he beheld them now in the aspect of unreasoning wolves.\r\n\r\nBy the grace of heaven the door was locked. He heard a female\r\nexpletive, extreme in tone though mild in phrase, directed towards the\r\ndomestic habits of her master, especially with regard to the privacy\r\nof his study, and he next heard her steps moving away. She was coming\r\nround by the garden; there was not a moment to lose ... and there was\r\nnot a cranny in which to hide.\r\n\r\nI have expatiated on the effect of misery and of terror upon George’s\r\nbrain: I have but here to add that for two seconds he was a veritable\r\nNapoleon in his survey of terrain. He grasped in a flash that if he\r\nretreated by the garden door he was full in the line of the enemy’s\r\nadvance without an alternative route towards any base; and with such an\r\ninspiration as decided Jena, he made for the chimney.\r\n\r\nThe eccentricities of the master of the house (for he was obviously\r\neccentric) appeared to include a passion for old-fashioned fireplaces;\r\nat any rate there was no register nor any other devilish device for\r\nimpeding the progress of the human form, and George, with a dexterity\r\nremarkable in one of his bulk, hoisted himself into the space\r\nimmediately above the grate. There the chimney narrowed rapidly to a\r\nsmall flue, and he must perforce support himself by the really painful\r\nmethod of pressing with his feet against the one wall, and with his\r\ncramped shoulders against the other, lying in the attitude of a man\r\ncurled up in bed upon his right side,--but in no such comfort, for\r\nwhere the bed should be was air.\r\n\r\nHe had not gained his lair a moment too soon. He could discover from\r\nit the hearth-rug, a small strip of the carpet, and the legs of sundry\r\ntables and chairs, when he heard the garden door open, and other\r\nlegs,--human legs--natty, and their extremities alone visible, passed\r\namong the legs of the inanimate things. The head which owned them\r\nfar above continued, as the legs and feet bore it round the room, to\r\ncriticise the habits of its master. It dusted, it went to the farther\r\nside of the apartment, the feet disappeared. They reappeared suddenly\r\nwithin his line of vision and stopped dead, while the invisible head\r\nremarked in a tone of curiosity:\r\n\r\n“Whatever’s that!”\r\n\r\nShe was looking at the imprint of the feet. Next he heard her patting\r\nthe damp arm-chair, and exclaiming that she never!\r\n\r\nThe strain upon George Mulross Demaine was increasing, but had it been\r\ntenfold as severe he dared not descend. A slight involuntary movement\r\ndue to an effort to ease his shoulder off a point of brick produced a\r\nfall of soot which most unpleasantly covered his face.\r\n\r\nHe could hear a startled exclamation from the wench, her decision that\r\nshe didn’t understand the house at all, and her sudden exit.\r\n\r\nHardly had she shut the garden door behind her when a key was heard\r\nturning in the lock in the other door opening into the house, and the\r\nExpected Stranger, the Unknown Host, entered. The moment of George’s\r\nsalvation was at hand.\r\n\r\nTwo very large flat boots slowly tramped into the narrow region he\r\ncould survey: above each nine inches of creased grey trouser leg could\r\nbe seen; the boots, the trouser legs, did not approach the arm-chair;\r\nthey took little notice apparently of things about them. Their owner\r\ngrunted his satisfaction that none of his papers had been removed by\r\nthe maid to whom he applied a most indiscreet epithet; he grunted\r\nfurther satisfaction that she had laid his fire and not lit it.\r\nApparently it was among his other eccentricities to have a fire upon a\r\nJune morning simply because the room was cold, and to let it die down\r\nbefore noon.\r\n\r\nThe Unknown came close to the grate. George heard large hands fumbling\r\nupon the mantelpiece, the unmistakable rattle of a match-box; next\r\nan arm midway to the shoulder, and at its extremity a hand bearing\r\na lighted match appeared, and the Stranger Host thoughtfully lit the\r\nNewspaper upon which the fire was laid.\r\n\r\nThe dense and acrid smoke produced by our Great Organs of Opinion when\r\nthey are put to this domestic purpose rose up and enveloped the unhappy\r\nGeorge. It was the limit! And with one cry and with one roar, as\r\nMacaulay finely says of another crisis, the prospective Warden of the\r\nCourt of Dowry slid down into the grate, ruining the careful structure\r\nof coal and wood, and stood in the presence of--he could scarcely\r\nbelieve his eyes--William Bailey!\r\n\r\nThat tall, bewhiskered, genial oligarch expressed no marked\r\nastonishment. It is, alas! a characteristic of the eccentric that,\r\njust as he sees the world all wrong where it is normal, so, before the\r\nabnormal he is incapable of expressing reasonable emotion. All he said\r\nwas, in a mild tone of voice:\r\n\r\n“Well! well! well!”\r\n\r\nTo which Demaine answered, with the solemnity the occasion demanded:\r\n\r\n“William, don’t you know me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know you,” said William Bailey thoughtfully, “Dimmy, by God!...\r\nDimmy, d’you know that you present a most extraordinary spectacle?”\r\n\r\n“You needn’t tell me that,” said Dimmy bitterly, drawing his hand\r\nacross his mouth and displaying two red lips which appeared in the\r\nmidst of his features like those of a comedy negro. “The point is what\r\ncan you do for me?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Dimmy,” said William Bailey, his interest increasing as the\r\nsituation grew upon him, “I am delighted to hear that phrase! I haven’t\r\nheard it since I gave up politics! I haven’t heard it since they tried\r\nto make me an Under Secretary,--only it used to be worded a little\r\ndifferently. Old schoolfellows of mine whom I had thrashed with a\r\ncricket stump in years gone by used to come up washing their hands and\r\nsaying, ‘What can I do for you?’ Now for once in my life some one has\r\nasked me what _I_ can do for _him_. Sweet Dimmy, all I have is at your\r\ndisposal. Would you like to borrow some money, or would you prefer to\r\nwash?”\r\n\r\n“I wish you’d chuck that sort of thing,” said Demaine, angrily and with\r\ninsufficient respect for a senior. “It isn’t London and I’m not out for\r\njokes. I’m in trouble.”\r\n\r\n“In trouble?” said William Bailey, asking the question sympathetically.\r\n“Oh don’t say that! Dirty, maybe, and very funnily dressed, but not, I\r\nhope, in trouble?”\r\n\r\n“Damn it!” said the other, “what are you in this house?”\r\n\r\n“What I am out of it,” said William Bailey cheerfully, “a harmless\r\neccentric with a small property, several bees in my bonnet (the present\r\none an anti-Semitic bee), and a great lover of my friends, Dimmy,\r\nespecially men of my own blood. Now then, what do you want?”\r\n\r\n“Do you own this house, or do you not?” demanded Dimmy.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said William Bailey, “it is very good of you to ask. I am what\r\nthe law calls a lessor or lessee, or perhaps I am a bailee of the\r\nhouse. The house itself belongs to Merry. You know Merry, the architect\r\nwho builds his father’s houses?”\r\n\r\n“The books have got ‘Armiger’ in them,” said Dimmy suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“That’s a title,” replied William Bailey, “not an English title,” he\r\ncontinued hurriedly, “it was given him by the Pope.”\r\n\r\n“Anyhow, you’re master here?” said Demaine anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” said Bailey, “I’ve been master here since the end of the\r\nfirst week. At first there was some doubt whether it was Elise or the\r\ngroom or Parrett, the housekeeper, who was master. But I won, Dimmy,”\r\nhe said, rubbing his hands contentedly, “I brought down my servant\r\nZachary and between us we won. They’re as tame as pheasants now.”\r\n\r\n“Very well then,” said Demaine, “you’ve got to do two things. You’ve\r\ngot to cleanse me and to clothe me and to hide me during the next few\r\nhours if the necessity arises.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know why you shouldn’t cleanse yourself,” said William Bailey\r\nthoughtfully. “You’ve never learned a trade, Dimmy, and you were never\r\nhandy or quick at things, but you’re a grown man, and there’s lots of\r\nhot water and soap and stuff in the bathroom; there was a beastly thing\r\ncalled a loofah that Merry had left there, but I’ve burned it.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be a fool, Bill!” pleaded Demaine, “there isn’t time, really\r\nthere isn’t. Then tell me, what clothes have you?”\r\n\r\n“Mine are too narrow in the shoulders for you,” said William Bailey,\r\nthinking, “Zachary is altogether too thin. You’re big, Dimmy, not to\r\nsay fat. The trousers wouldn’t meet and the coat wouldn’t go on. But I\r\ncan put you to bed and send for clothes. What d’you mean about hiding?\r\nI can see you have some reasons for privacy; in fact if you _hadn’t_,\r\ngetting up that chimney would be a schoolboy sort of thing to do at\r\nyour age. Have you been bathing without a licence, and some one stolen\r\nyour clothes? Or have they been having a jolly rag at the Buteleys’?\r\nThey’re close by.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you when I’ve washed,” said Demaine wearily, “only now do\r\nlet me slip up to the bathroom like a good fellow. Good God, I’m tired!”\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey opened the door and peered cautiously into the corridor,\r\nlistened for footsteps and heard none, and then, after locking the door\r\nof the study behind him, as was his ridiculous habit, he popped up a\r\nnarrow pair of stairs, with Dimmy, whose old nature had sufficiently\r\nreturned to cause him to stumble, following at his heels.\r\n\r\nThey were not quite out of the range of the front door when there came\r\na violent pull at the bell, and Elise went forward to open it.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey pushed his guest and cousin into the bathroom and went\r\ndown to meet two policemen who stood with awful solemnity, clothed\r\nin suspicion and in power, at his threshold. From the depths of his\r\nsanctuary and through the crack of the half-open window, Demaine heard\r\na conversation that did not please him.\r\n\r\n“Very sorry to have to ask you sir,” a deep bass was saying, “we’re\r\nbound to do it.”\r\n\r\n“We’re bound to do it,” echoed a tenor.\r\n\r\nDemaine did not hear his cousin’s reply.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure he’s been on the premises, sir?” came from the first\r\npoliceman, whom I will call “_Basso Profondo_.”\r\n\r\n“Positive,” answered William Bailey’s voice, cheerful and loud.\r\n“Positive!”\r\n\r\n“Did you see him with your own eyes, sir?” this from the second\r\npoliceman, whom I will call “_Tenore Stridente_.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I did, or I wouldn’t be telling you this,” came again from\r\nWilliam Bailey a little testily.\r\n\r\n“Well now, sir, we’ve suspicions that he’s on the place still.”\r\n\r\n“You’re wrong there,” said William Bailey, “he ran off down the Parham\r\nroad when he heard my dog bark.”\r\n\r\n“We didn’t meet any one on the Parham road, sir:” it was the voice of\r\nthe Tenore policeman who spoke, evidently a less ingenuous man than the\r\nBasso.\r\n\r\n“I can’t help that,” said William Bailey. “You’re welcome to look over\r\nthe house.”\r\n\r\nThey thanked him and walked in like an army.\r\n\r\n“It is for your own good, sir,” said the first policeman, in his deep\r\nbass.\r\n\r\n“Besides which it’s our duty,” said the second policeman in his _tenore\r\nstridente_.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said William Bailey, “of course, and I hope that while one\r\nof you is doing the good, the other will look after the duty. It’s the\r\nkind of thing people like me are very fond of doing, hiding stowaways.\r\nI’ve hidden bushels of them.”\r\n\r\nThe tenor was indifferent to his sarcasm, the bass was touched.\r\n\r\n“You know very well, sir,” he said, “what the criminal classes are, or\r\nrather you gentlemen don’t know. Why, he’d cut the women’s throats in\r\nthe night and make off with the valuables.”\r\n\r\n“Would he cut mine?” asked William Bailey as he followed them from room\r\nto room.\r\n\r\n“He’s capable of it,” said the bass, nodding mysteriously. “He’s not an\r\nordinary stowaway,” he continued, lowering his voice almost to a gruff\r\nwhisper, “_he’s well known to the police_. He’s _Stappy_, that’s what\r\nhe is, STAPPY THE CLINKER! He’s done this trick before, getting aboard\r\na vessel and pretending he’s a vagabun; the Chief knows all about him!\r\nHe did a man in last Monday night in London!”\r\n\r\nTo the unhappy man in the bathroom there returned with vivid horror the\r\nrecollection of Lewes Gaol; but so long as William Bailey’s wits did\r\nnot fail him he knew that more than even chances were in his favour.\r\nHis mood changed suddenly, however, when the police, who had been\r\nperambulating the small rooms near his retreat, suddenly rattled the\r\ndoor of his bathroom and said:\r\n\r\n“What’s in here?”\r\n\r\n“I do beg of you to take care, gentlemen,” said William Bailey angrily,\r\n“that’s the bathroom, and if you want to know, my niece is inside.”\r\n\r\n“Oh I beg your pardon,” said the bass, “I’m sure.” He had the sense not\r\nto doubt the master of the house in a matter directly concerning his\r\nown interest. But the tenor added:\r\n\r\n“We must make a note of it, sir.”\r\n\r\n“By all means,” said William Bailey, “by all means. Her name is\r\nRebecca.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Mulross Demaine, in the delight of the very warm water, was\r\nsoothed to hear them tramping heavily down the stairs once more.\r\n\r\nThey examined every room and cranny of the place until they came to the\r\nstudy door.\r\n\r\n“It’s my study,” said William Bailey apologetically, “I always keep it\r\nlocked.”\r\n\r\nHe unlocked it and they entered. Their trained eyes could see nothing\r\nunusual in the aspect of the room until the tenor inadvertently\r\nputting his hand upon the back of the arm-chair discovered it to be\r\nboth wet and to the taste salt. He had found a clue! In a voice of\r\nexcitement unworthy of his office, the intelligent officer shouted:\r\n\r\n“We’ve got ’im sir, we’ve got ’im! He’s been here! Look--sea water.\r\nWe’ve got ’im!” He looked round wildly as though expecting to see the\r\nrunaway appear suddenly in mid-air between the floor and the ceiling.\r\n\r\n“It is certainly most disconcerting,” said William Bailey in evident\r\nalarm. “But wait a minute. Perhaps he came in here from the garden to\r\nsee what he could get, found the door locked on the outside and made\r\nout through the garden again; that would explain everything.”\r\n\r\n“No it wouldn’t sir,” said the bass respectfully, “it wouldn’t explain\r\n_that_!” And his mind, which, if slower than his colleague’s, was prone\r\nto sound conclusions, pointed his hand to the wreck of the fire, to the\r\nheaps of soot that lay upon it, and the disturbance of the fender.\r\n\r\n“He’s gone up the chimney, that’s what he’s done,” said the tenor.\r\n\r\n“That’s what he’s done,” said the bass, putting the matter in his own\r\nway, “he’s gone up the chimney.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey put his head in and looked up the flue, the top of which\r\nwas a little square of blue June sunlight above. “I don’t see him,”\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\nThe constables, one after the other, solemnly performed the same feat.\r\n\r\n“A man couldn’t get up that,” said Bailey stoutly.\r\n\r\n“Ah, _Stappy_ could,” said the bass in a tone of one who talks of\r\nan old acquaintance, “Stappy could get out of anywhere, or through\r\nanything! He’s a wonderful man, sir!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the tenor solved the whole business.\r\n\r\n“He’s on the roof!” he said.\r\n\r\nNothing would suit them but ladders must be brought, and they must\r\nclimb upon the slates, while William Bailey, consoling himself with the\r\nthought that the property was not his, took the opportunity of dashing\r\nup to the bathroom and banging at the door.\r\n\r\n“Dimmy, Dimmy!” he whispered loudly, “Dimmy, get out.”\r\n\r\n“I’m all wet,” said Dimmy.\r\n\r\n“You’re used to that,” said Bailey unfeelingly. “Dry your feet. Never\r\nmind the rest. Quick!” He threw a dressing-gown in, and Dimmy, as clean\r\nas Sunday morning, emerged.\r\n\r\n“Are your feet quite dry, Dimmy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said that great Commoner, still a trifle ruffled.\r\n\r\n“Well then, let me think.... Go in there.”\r\n\r\nHe pushed Demaine into a little writing-room that gave out of the\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\n“Now then, go to that little table and sit perfectly\r\ntight. Do as I tell you and you are saved.\r\nDepart-by-but-one-iota-from-my-specific-instructions-and though you’ll\r\nultimately be redeemed by your powerful relatives from the ignominy of\r\nincarceration, you cannot fail to become a laughing-stock before your\r\nfellow-citizens! Do you take me, Dimmy?”\r\n\r\nDimmy, who like the rest of the family was never quite certain whether\r\nWilliam Bailey’s final outbreak into downright lunacy might not take\r\nplace at any moment, suddenly sat where he was bid, and his cousin\r\nreturned within thirty seconds bearing a woman’s walking-cloak and\r\na respectable bonnet which, I regret to say, were those of Parrett\r\nherself. Bailey huddled the cloak upon the younger man, banged the\r\nbonnet upon his head, tied the ribbons under his chin, disposed his\r\nperson with the back to the door, in the attitude of one writing a\r\nnote, and said:\r\n\r\n“Dimmy, could you talk in a high voice?”\r\n\r\n“No, I can’t!” said Dimmy.\r\n\r\n“Try. Say ‘Oh don’t, I’m busy.’”\r\n\r\n“I can’t!” said Dimmy again.\r\n\r\n“Great heavens! is there no limit to the things you can’t do?” said\r\nWilliam Bailey testily. “Try.”\r\n\r\nAt a vast sacrifice of that self-respect which was his chiefest\r\ntreasure, Dimmy uttered the grotesque words in a faint falsetto.\r\n\r\n“Excellent!” said William Bailey. “Now when you hear the word\r\n‘Rebecca’ that’s your cue. Say it again.”\r\n\r\nThe second step is easier than the first, and Dimmy this time replied\r\nat once, the falsetto quite just: “Oh don’t, I’m busy.” And William\r\nBailey was satisfied.\r\n\r\nBy this time the policemen could be heard scrambling down from the\r\nroof; they had found nothing, which, seeing that the roof was in shape\r\nexactly pyramidical, was not wonderful.\r\n\r\n“Well, he’s gone, sir,” said the bass a little relieved.\r\n\r\n“We must see the bathroom before we leave, though,” added the tenor\r\nfixedly.\r\n\r\n“By all means,” said William Bailey, “if it’s empty,” he added with a\r\ndecent reserve.\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs and on their way he opened the writing-room door,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n“Oh, there she is. Rebecca!”\r\n\r\n“Oh don’t worry me, I’m busy,” boomed in a manly voice from the seated\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n“Sorry I’m sure sir,” said the tenor, who was now sincerely apologetic.\r\n“We have no desire to disturb the lady, but it was our duty.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said William Bailey hurriedly, “of course,” and he shut\r\nthe door, mentally renewing his profound faith in the imbecility of\r\npolitical life.\r\n\r\nThe active and intelligent officers of the law gazed mechanically round\r\nthe bathroom; they were too modest to examine a certain damp heap of\r\nblack cloth that was flung huddled into a corner. They went out with\r\nevery assurance that they would not have disturbed Mr. Bailey for\r\na moment had they not been compelled by that sense of duty to their\r\ncountry to which they had already so frequently alluded.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey accompanied them to the gate, in the fixed desire to see\r\nthem off the place, and with a heartfelt silent prayer that Parrett\r\nwould not go into the writing-room until he had returned.\r\n\r\nAs they reached the gate the bass, who remembered the necessity for\r\nsubscriptions to local clubs, charities and balls, and especially to\r\nthe Policemen’s balls, charities and clubs, said once more that he\r\nhoped Mr. Bailey understood they had only done their duty.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he added, “we know Mr. Merry very well, and we take it\r\nyou’re a friend of his.”\r\n\r\n“Yes sir,” said the tenor more severely, “and we know who you are. We\r\nknow everybody in the place, sir. It’s our business. We know what they\r\ndo, where they come from and where they go to. They can’t escape us.”\r\n\r\nWith this cheerful assurance the bass and the tenor both slightly\r\nsaluted, and the gate shut behind them.\r\n\r\nOutside the gate a little crowd consisting of the two sailor-men,\r\na dingy officer of the mercantile marine, three young boys, a\r\ndraggle-tailed village girl, and a spaniel, awaited the return of the\r\npolice, and when it was known that they had drawn blank, this little\r\ncrowd paradoxically enough gave cry. Each was now as certain that he\r\nhad seen the fugitive in some one of a hundred opposing and impossible\r\ndirections as he had formerly been determined that the refugee was\r\nstill concealed in Mr. Merry’s house.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey hurried back: he went straight to the writing-room. He\r\nthanked heaven that no one had disturbed Rebecca. Without an apology\r\nhe rapidly untied the ribbons of the bonnet, hoicked off the cloak and\r\nwas bearing them back to Parrett’s room when he heard the voice of that\r\nadmirable female raised in hot remonstrance against the misdeeds of a\r\ndomestic.\r\n\r\nIn tactics as in strategy there is a disposition known as the\r\noffensive-defensive. William Bailey was familiar with it. He adopted\r\nit now, and in a voice that silenced every other sort, he roared his\r\ncomplaint that the servants perpetually left their clothes hanging\r\nabout at random right and left all over the house.\r\n\r\n“Whose is this?” he demanded, pointing to the cloak and bonnet where he\r\nhad flung them sprawling on a chair.\r\n\r\n“It’s mine, sir,” said Parrett with considerable dignity.\r\n\r\n“Oh it is, is it?” said Bailey a little mollified. “I’m sorry, Parrett.\r\nIf I’d known it was yours I’d have spoken to you privately.”\r\n\r\n“I never left them there, sir!” said Parrett all aruffle with\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n“I never said you did, I never said you did. It’s none of my business.\r\nI don’t care who left them there; but I will have this house _orderly_\r\nor I will not have it at _all_,” with which enigmatical sentence for\r\nthe further discipline of Merry’s impossible household, he went back to\r\nDemaine in his dressing-gown and brought him through the corridor to\r\nthe study.\r\n\r\n“Now my dear fellow,” he said, “are you cold?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Dimmy.\r\n\r\n“Are you hungry?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Dimmy.\r\n\r\n“Are you thirsty?”\r\n\r\n“I am very tired,” said Dimmy.\r\n\r\n“Very well then, you shall eat and drink. I will try and light the\r\nfire.”\r\n\r\nHe did so and the room, which was already warm with the June sun,\r\nbecame like an oven. As he rose from his chair Demaine said in some\r\nanxiety: “For heavens’ sake don’t send for the servants!”\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to,” said William Bailey simply. He went to a cupboard\r\nand brought out some ham, a loaf and a bottle of wine.\r\n\r\nDemaine ate and drank. When he had eaten and drunk he could hardly\r\nsupport himself for fatigue.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey took him to his own room and told him to sleep there.\r\n“I’ve established,” he said, in a genial tone, “so healthy a reign of\r\nterror in this house that you certainly will not be disturbed if you\r\nsleep in my bed. I will see about the clothes.”\r\n\r\nAnd thus, after so many and so great adventures, George Mulross Demaine\r\nslept once again between sheets, in a bed well aired, in a room with\r\nreasonable pictures upon the walls, and reasonable books upon the\r\ntable, with blankets, with curtains, with pillows, with mahogany\r\ntallboys, with three kinds of looking-glasses, with an eider-down\r\nquilt, with a deep carpet, with a silver reading lamp, soothed by a\r\ncomplete cleanliness, and, in a word, amid all that the governing\r\nclasses have very properly secured for themselves during their short\r\npilgrimage through the wilderness of this world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through that hot noon and down the beginning of the sun’s decline,\r\nGeorge Mulross slept heavily; he slept as in a death, in Parham.\r\n\r\nHe slept in the house of Carolus Merry Armiger, under the shield and\r\ntutelage of William Bailey, eccentric, and with God’s benediction upon\r\nhim. His troubles were at an end.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in London, the young and popular Prime Minister had received\r\nhis secretary’s report. The _Moon_ and the _Capon_ were squared.\r\n\r\nHow squared he was not busy to inquire. Gold and silver he had\r\nnone--for those purposes at least--that would not be in the best\r\ntraditions of our public life: but they _were_ squared: Edward assured\r\nhim they were squared, and there was an end of it.\r\n\r\nThere was more even than Edward’s assurance, though that was as solid\r\nas marble; there were two early copies of the papers themselves which\r\nhad been ordered and brought to him. The leader of the one dealt with\r\nthose eternal Concessions in Burma, and he smiled. There was not a\r\nword about Repton. The leader of the other was on Fiddlededee, and the\r\nPrime Minister experienced an immense relief.\r\n\r\nBut there was still Demaine,--or rather, there was still no Demaine.\r\nAnd there was still Repton, mad--mad--mad!\r\n\r\nBetween Dolly and the awful unstable equilibrium of the modern world,\r\nbetween him and a cosmic explosion, was nothing but the four walls\r\nround Repton, Lady Repton who bored him, and the sagacity of Edward. It\r\nwas a quarter to three, a time when meaner men must wend them to the\r\nHouse of Commons. He also wended. He was the shepherd and he must look\r\nafter his sheep.\r\n\r\nThat august assembly was astonished to perceive the Premier positively\r\npresent upon the front bench during the process of that appeal to the\r\nAlmighty which precedes the business of the day. But _that_ did not get\r\ninto the papers:--there is a limit!\r\n\r\nAs he knelt there he knew that a man whom he could not disobey was\r\nabout to ask a question of which he had given private notice. He feared\r\nit much, he more feared those supplementary questions which are so\r\nuseless to the scheme of our polity but which buzz like unnecessary\r\nmidges round the cooking of the national food. And when prayers were\r\nover and questions begun, not an inquiry as to an Admiralty contract,\r\nnot a simple demand for information from the Home Secretary as to the\r\nincarceration of a beggar or the torture of some insignificant pauper,\r\nbut put his heart into his mouth.\r\n\r\nMr. Maloney’s long cross-examination on the matter of the postmistress\r\nat Crosshaurigh gave him a little breathing space. They couldn’t bring\r\nRepton or Demaine in on that! But there was an ominous question about a\r\nwreck, and who should answer it? He had indeed arranged that the answer\r\nshould proceed from the Treasury, but the clouds were lowering.\r\n\r\nThe question came as mild as milk: it was concerned with the wreck\r\nwhich still banged and battered about on the Sovereign Shoals; it had\r\nbeen put down days before, and the chief legal adviser of the Crown\r\nrose solemnly to reply.\r\n\r\n“My right honourable friend has asked me to answer this question. He\r\nhas no further information beyond that which he has already furnished\r\nto the honourable gentleman, but every inquiry is being made and papers\r\nwill shortly be laid upon the table of the House.”\r\n\r\nThe fanatic rose, the inevitable fanatic, towering from the benches,\r\nand thundered his supplementary demand: What had been done with the\r\ngin? He was told to give notice of the question.\r\n\r\nFor three dreadful seconds the Prime Minister feared some consequence.\r\nHis fears were well grounded. A gentleman rose and spoke from the\r\ndarkness under the gallery and desired to know why the _Warden of the\r\nCourt of Dowry_ was not present to deal with matters concerning his\r\nDepartment? He would have been reproved by the Chair had not the young\r\nand popular Prime Minister taken it upon himself to rise and reply.\r\n\r\n“It is the first time,” he said, “and I hope it will be the last, that\r\nI have heard the illness of a colleague made the excuse for such an\r\ninterruption.”\r\n\r\nFrom the benches behind him those who knew the truth applauded and\r\nthose who did not applauded more loudly still.\r\n\r\nWith what genius had he not saved the situation! And the questions\r\nmeandered on, and all was well, save for that last dreadful query of\r\nwhich he had had private notice.\r\n\r\nIt was put at the end of question-time, not, oddly enough, by the\r\nmember who most coveted the apparently vacant Wardenship, nor even by\r\nany relative of that member, nay, not even by a friend: a member surely\r\ninnocent of all personal motives put that question. He desired to know,\r\nwhether rumours appearing in the papers upon the Wardenship of the\r\nCourt of Dowry were well founded, whether the Wardenship of the Court\r\nof Dowry were not for the moment vacant, and if so what steps were\r\nbeing taken to fill that vacancy.\r\n\r\nThe reply was curt and sufficient: “The honourable member must not\r\nbelieve everything he reads in the newspapers.”\r\n\r\nIt is not often that wit of a lightning kind falls zigzag and\r\nblasts the efforts of anarchy in the National Council. Wit is very\r\nproperly excluded from the exercise of legislative power; but when it\r\nappears--when there is good reason for its appearance--its success is\r\noverwhelming: and by the action of this one brilliant phrase, perhaps\r\nthe most dangerous crisis through which the Constitution has passed\r\nsince the flight of James II. was triumphantly passed.\r\n\r\nQuestion-time was over. The young and popular Prime Minister, now\r\nwholly oblivious of his left lung, answered one or two minor questions,\r\ngave assurances as to the order of business, and left the House a\r\nhappier man than he had entered it. He went straight to Downing Street.\r\nWhen he got to his room Edward was there awaiting him.\r\n\r\n“They’ve got Demaine,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe luck had turned!\r\n\r\nFor half a minute Dolly couldn’t speak: then he gasped:\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Edward. “I don’t think anybody knows. There was a\r\ntelephone message sent to the Press everywhere.”\r\n\r\nA thousand horrid thoughts! Found dead? Found wandering and imbecile?\r\nFound----? He was faster bound than ever--and that just in the hour\r\nwhen he must act and decide. He said again:\r\n\r\n“Where did it come from?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t find out.”\r\n\r\n“Edward,” said the Premier faintly, as he sat down and fell to pieces,\r\n“you know how to do these things.... Puff!-- ... Do go like ... a good\r\nfellow--find out ... quietly ... ch ... _where_ it came from.”\r\n\r\nEdward went into the next room and called up 009 Central. He was given\r\n1009, kept his temper and repeated his call. A Being replied to him in\r\nan angry woman’s voice and begged him not to shout into the receiver.\r\n\r\nHe asked for the clerk in charge and waited ten minutes. Nothing\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister in his room was not at ease. His mood was if\r\nanything burdened by the delivery of an express message which ran:\r\n“They’ve found Dimmy. M. S.” The writing was the writing of Mary Smith.\r\nHe asked the messenger with some indifference to find out who had sent\r\nthe message and where it had come from.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the absence of Edward, he went into an outer room and\r\nbegged them to call up Mrs. Smith’s house. When he returned there was a\r\ntelegram from Charing Cross upon his table which ran:\r\n\r\n“George found.”\r\n\r\nThere was no signature. He waited patiently for the return of Edward or\r\nthe messenger or of something--hang it all, _something_!\r\n\r\nThe little buzzer on his table buzzed gently and the telephone\r\nwhispered into his ear that “Mrs. Demaine wished him to know that Mr.\r\nDemaine was found.” He had already asked “Where is he?” when he was cut\r\noff.\r\n\r\nHe had received so much information and no more when Edward returned\r\nwith the information that the news had come in from Trunk Seven.\r\n\r\n“What is Trunk Seven?” said the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Edward.\r\n\r\nThey sat together for a moment in silence. The Premier, as befitted his\r\noffice, was a man of resource. Outside Westminster Bridge Underground\r\nStation men of insufficient capital but of economic ambition deal in\r\nthe retail commerce of news. It occurred to the Prime Minister to\r\nreassure himself from their posters, and from a room that gave upon\r\nWestminster Bridge Road, his excellent eyesight--for it was among his\r\npoints that his eyesight at fifty-four was still strong--perused the\r\nplacards opposite.\r\n\r\nThey were clear enough.\r\n\r\n  “LOST MINISTER FOUND”\r\n\r\nsaid the most decent.\r\n\r\n  “DEMAINE RESULT”\r\n\r\nsaid the _Capon_, which appeared to have forgotten its good manners.\r\n\r\nIt ought not to be difficult to get the _Capon_ without loss of\r\ndignity. He returned to his room and in about five minutes the _Capon_\r\nwas brought to him.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading “Stop Press News,” he saw “Demaine Result,” and\r\nthen underneath, more courteously: “Mr. Demaine has been heard of.” It\r\nwas printed in faint wobbly type in a big blank space--and there was\r\nnothing more.\r\n\r\nEdward, entering at that moment, told him that the exact point from\r\nwhich the message had been sent could not be discovered until Brighton\r\nhad cleared.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nHe was going to call up Mary Smith, but Edward assured him that nothing\r\nmore than an inept half-wit maid would answer the demand--he had tried\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDolly sat on in patience and wondered where Demaine had been\r\ndiscovered. The matter was of some moment. Without the least doubt he\r\nwould have to make up his mind as to the succession of the office that\r\nvery afternoon, and it was already close on five.\r\n\r\nDemaine might be discovered suffering from a loss of memory (though\r\nwhat he had to remember Dolly couldn’t conceive); he might have been\r\ndiscovered in the hands of the police. He might have been discovered\r\nattempting for some unknown reason to fly the country. Till the Premier\r\nknew more he could not act.\r\n\r\nFor a good half-hour he persuaded himself that it was better to wait.\r\nThen he went out and motored to Mary’s.\r\n\r\nAnd Mary of course was not at home.\r\n\r\nHe went on to Demaine House, and found there nothing but a man making a\r\nvery careful inventory of all the pictures, all the furniture and all\r\nthe glass. He came back to his room, and at last the mystery was solved.\r\n\r\nAll good things come to an end, as do all delays and all vexations,\r\nand life itself. By a method less expeditious than some of those\r\nwhich modern civilisation has put at our disposal, the full truth was\r\nrevealed to him.\r\n\r\nGeorge Mulross Demaine was at that moment (it was six o’clock) upon\r\nthat afternoon of Wednesday, the 3rd of June, ... drinking brandy and\r\nsoda in great quantities and refusing tea, at the Liverpool Street\r\nHotel. A courteous message from the Manager thereof was the source of\r\nthe information, and Edward--Edward who never failed--had been the\r\nfirst to receive it.\r\n\r\nThe message had gone up and down London a good deal before it had got\r\nto the House of Commons; at Demaine House the Manager had been told to\r\ntry Mary Smith’s number, and at Mary Smith’s the half-wit having almost\r\nhad her head blown off by Edward’s repeated violence, very sensibly\r\nsuggested that the Manager should telephone direct to the House of\r\nCommons and give a body peace.\r\n\r\nAn instant demand (said Edward) that Demaine should himself come to\r\nthe instrument, had been followed by a very long pause, after which he\r\nwas told that the gentleman had gone off in a four-wheeler with a lame\r\nhorse, and had left the bill unpaid.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to do but to wait.\r\n\r\nHalf-past six struck, and the quarter. Their fears were renewed when,\r\njust upon seven, a figure strangely but neatly clothed was shown into\r\nthe room, by a servant who displayed such an exact proportion between\r\ncensure and respect as would have puzzled the most wearisome of modern\r\ndramatists to depict.[4]\r\n\r\nIt was Demaine!\r\n\r\nHis clothes were indeed extraordinary. You could not say they fitted,\r\nand you could not say they did not fit. The trousers and the coat and\r\nthe waistcoat were made of one cloth, a quiet yellow. The lines of the\r\nshoulders, the arms, the legs, the very stomach, were right lines: they\r\nwere lines proceeding from point to point; they were lines taking the\r\nshortest route from point to point. They were straight: they were plumb\r\nstraight. The creases upon the trousers were not those adumbrations\r\nof creases which the most vulgar of the smart permit to hint at the\r\nnewness of their raiment: they were solid ridges resembling the roofs\r\nof new barns or the keels of racing ships. The lapels of the coat did\r\nnot sit well upon it; rather they were glued to it. The waistcoat did\r\nnot fit, it stuck. And above this strange accoutrement shone, with more\r\nfitness than Edward and Dolly could have imagined, the simple face of\r\nGeorge Mulross Demaine.\r\n\r\nHis hair--oh horror!--was oiled; one might have sworn that his face was\r\noiled as well.\r\n\r\nThe colour of his skin resembled cedarwood save on the nose, where it\r\nresembled old oak. If ever a man was fit, that man was George Mulross,\r\nbut if ever a man was changed, George Mulross was also that man.\r\n\r\n“Sit down,” said the Prime Minister delightedly. “Oh my dear George,\r\nsit down!”\r\n\r\n“I can’t,” said George, using that phrase perhaps for the twentieth\r\ntime during the last forty-eight hours. “They’re ready-made,” he\r\nexplained, blushing (as Homer beautifully puts it of Andromache)\r\nthrough his tan. “I didn’t sit down in the train and I didn’t sit down\r\nin the cab.”\r\n\r\n“Where have you been, George?” asked the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had an adventure,” said George modestly.\r\n\r\n“But hang it all, where have you _been_?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been to sea,” said George.\r\n\r\n“Oh-h-h-h-h-h!” said the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n“Beastly luck, isn’t it?” said George simply.\r\n\r\n“It’s worse than that,” said Edward grimly.\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked George with something like fright upon his honest if\r\noleaginous face.\r\n\r\n“Well, never mind,” said Dolly. “It must have been pretty tough. Were\r\nyou blown out to sea?”\r\n\r\nGeorge Mulross Demaine’s only reply was to feel inside his coat for\r\nthe place where pockets are often constructed for the well-to-do, but\r\nwhere no pocket seemed to exist. He made five or six good digs for\r\nit, but it was not there. He looked up huntedly and said: “Wait a\r\nminute.” He put his hand into his waistcoat. There again there was no\r\nreceptacle, but that which should have held his watch--and even the\r\nyoung idealism of the Prime Minister permitted him to wonder why no\r\nwatch was there. Then George did what I hope no member of the governing\r\nclass has ever done before--he felt in his trousers pocket, and thence\r\nhe pulled out a bit of paper.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, concealing the writing from them, “You’re quite\r\nright. I _was_ blown out to sea. I had a”--(here he peered closely\r\nat the paper and apparently could not make out a word.) “Oh yes,”\r\nhe said, “a terrible time.” His diction was singularly monotonous.\r\n“I-thought-I-should-never-have-survived-that-terrible-night.\r\nA-foreign-ship-passed-me-but-the-scoundrels-left-me-to-my-fate.\r\nI-was-nearly-dead-when-under-the-first-rays-of-morning-I-saw-the-\r\nBritish-flag-and-my-heart-leaped-within-me.”\r\n\r\nEdward, though not usually impetuous, bereft him of the document, and\r\nas he did so the Prime Minister saw the square firm characters.\r\n\r\n“Good lord!” shouted the Premier, “It’s Bill!”\r\n\r\nAnd it _was_ the writing of William Bailey.\r\n\r\n“William’s been very good to me, if you mean that,” said Demaine\r\nreproachfully.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister burst into the first hearty laugh he had enjoyed in\r\nfifteen years. After all, men like Bailey were of some use in the world!\r\n\r\nIn spite of Dimmy’s obvious choler, with the tears of laughter in\r\nhis eyes, and interrupted by little screams of merriment, the Prime\r\nMinister completed the reading.\r\n\r\n“‘I bit my arm, I sucked the blood, I cried “A sail! a sail!”; and in\r\nless time than it takes to read this, hearty English hands were tugging\r\nat the oars.’ (“Oh Edward, Edward!” gasped the exhausted man, and when\r\nhe had recovered his breath continued:) ‘With the tenderness almost of\r\na woman he lifted ...’ (“Who lifted you?” he asked between his shrieks\r\nand wagging his forefinger to George Demaine. “Oh George, who lifted\r\nyou?”) ... ‘He lifted me on board the good ship _Lily_, and when I told\r\nhim of the treacherous action of the foreigners, muttered “Scoundrel”\r\nbetween his teeth. But a man has naught to fear when the brave hearts\r\nof his countrymen are his shield. They landed me at Lowestoft, pressing\r\ninto my hands their petty savings, and left me with three hearty cheers\r\nthat did me almost as much good as to feel my feet once more upon\r\nBritish soil.’”\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister laid his head upon the table, wagged it gently from\r\nside to side, uttered a series of incongruous sounds, and very nearly\r\nbroke down.\r\n\r\nGeorge Mulross Demaine was exceedingly angry.\r\n\r\n“It may seem very funny to you,” he began, “but----”\r\n\r\n“Don’t, George!” said the Premier, going off again, “Don’t!”\r\n\r\nBut George was boiling. “How would you like it----” he began\r\nshouting.... When the door opened and there was announced with extreme\r\nsolemnity Mr. Pickle, Mr. Hogge, Mr. Gracechurch, Mr. Fuell, Mr. Nydd,\r\nSir John Clegg, Lord Cuthbertson, and last but by no means least, Mr.\r\nHowll....\r\n\r\nOne would have said that nothing had happened. There were three doors\r\nto the room--as is proper to every room in which farces are played.\r\n\r\nThrough one of these Edward very gently led the stiff but still burning\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\nThrough the second appeared an official gentleman commonly present at\r\ninterviews of this kind.\r\n\r\nThrough the third the deputation had entered; and the young and\r\npopular Prime Minister, all sympathy, all heart, all ears, all teeth,\r\nall intelligence, heard such an indictment of the maladministration\r\nof Spitzbergen by the infamous King of Bohemia as he had perhaps not\r\nlistened to more than thirty-eight times during the course of the last\r\ntwo years.\r\n\r\nEdward took George by the arm through room after room, down a corridor,\r\ninto a hall, then as though by magic an excellent motor appeared.\r\n\r\nThey got in, Edward still making himself perfectly charming, Dimmy in a\r\nconstrained attitude stretched tangentially to the edge of the seat,\r\nand the motor drove them for a very great number of miles, during which\r\njourney Edward learned all the main story; the robbery, the refuge\r\naboard-ship, the escape, and the fortunate discovery of William Bailey.\r\n\r\nGeorge was given to understand with that method and insistence most\r\nproper to his character that _that_ story had better be forgotten\r\nand that only what he had been given to read,--and only the gist of\r\nthat,--might very well be published to his wife and to the world....\r\n\r\nIt was an understood matter. George did now and then like to row and\r\nfish; a friend had asked him to run down to Port Victoria--it was only\r\nan hour; the friend hadn’t turned up. George only meant to go out for a\r\nminute, put up the sprits’l like a fool, got blown right away in front\r\nof a so’wester into the Swin; then the wind going round a point-o’-two\r\ngot blown, begad, right over the Gunfleet. High tide luckily, and the\r\nrest naturally followed.\r\n\r\nThese nautical experiences filled George with doubts.\r\n\r\n“There wasn’t any so’wester,” he said with bovine criticism.\r\n\r\n“You silly ass,” said Edward, “who notices a thing like that in London?”\r\n\r\n“You’d notice it at sea,” said George with profound conviction.\r\n\r\n“Anyhow, unless you want a good story against you to the end of your\r\nlife, you’ve got to be outside for thirty-six hours, and you’ve got to\r\nland a dam long way off from Parham,--I can tell you that!” said Edward\r\nfirmly.\r\n\r\nAnd George agreed.\r\n\r\nThey dined together at Richmond, which suburban town they had reached\r\nby Edward’s directions, and George, replete after so much suffering,\r\nbecame most genial. He betrayed in his conversation the fact that Sudie\r\nmight or might not know the truth; he had not dared to communicate\r\nwith her. William Bailey had done so after getting his new clothes,\r\nbut there had been no one at home. There was only a man in, making an\r\ninventory, and the footman thought the message had something to do with\r\nhim. What Sudie might have heard from others he didn’t know.\r\n\r\n“Where did the telephone message come from?” asked Edward who\r\nremembered the torturing anxiety of his Chief upon that point which now\r\nseemed so futile.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” George bleated, if I may use so disrespectful a term of\r\na man with £100 a week. “I really don’t know. He hired a motor, I know\r\nthat, and he drove it himself.”\r\n\r\n“Oh he did, did he? Where did he drive it to?”\r\n\r\n“To a station,” said George lucidly.\r\n\r\n“A long way off?” asked Edward.\r\n\r\n“Oh dear!” said George, “Don’t ask me. Right away over all sorts of\r\nplaces.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Demaine, listen,” said Evans, concentrating “Could you see the\r\nsea?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said George with a shudder.\r\n\r\n“Could you see the river,--anything?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said George. “We got there at three, and William telephoned from\r\nthe station.”\r\n\r\n“But damn it all!” cried Edward, “what was the name of the station?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said George, “I didn’t notice.”\r\n\r\nEdward tried another approach. “Were there houses round it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, lots,” said George, “lots--and they had laurels, and there was\r\na lot of gas lamp-posts, and there was a tramway--oh it was a beastly\r\nplace!”\r\n\r\nThen Evans understood and Kent, the Garden of England, was in his mind:\r\nKent and one of its deeply bosomed towns, Chislehurst haply or St. Mary\r\nCray. “But why did you go to Liverpool Street when you got in at Cannon\r\nStreet?” he said.\r\n\r\n“How did you know I got in at Cannon Street?” asked George with\r\nwide-open eyes like a child who sees the secretly marked card come out\r\nof the pack.\r\n\r\n“Never mind. Why did you go to Liverpool Street?”\r\n\r\n“William told me to,” answered George simply.\r\n\r\n“You’ll make a good front benchman,” said Edward half to himself. “Do\r\nyou know why he told you to go to Liverpool Street?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said George, “I don’t.... I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Edward, as though conveying a profound secret, “if ever\r\nyou happen to be at Lowestoft, that’s the way you get in to London.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, is it?” said George blankly.\r\n\r\n“Where did he buy your clothes?” asked Edward suddenly, “what shop?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, in Parham somewhere,” said George, “I don’t know where. I put ’em\r\non before I started of course. I couldn’t stay in a dressing-gown.”\r\n\r\nA thought occurred to Edward. He pulled back the collar of Demaine’s\r\ncoat, and saw marked upon a tape, “Harrington Brothers, Parham.”\r\nWithout so much as asking his leave he cut the label.\r\n\r\n“What’s on the shirt?” he asked laconically.\r\n\r\nGeorge opened his waistcoat and looked. “Six sixty-six,” he said.\r\n\r\n“It is the mark of the beast,” said Edward.\r\n\r\n“Who do you mean?” said George, bewildered. “William Bailey lent it to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“If you’d told me that,” said Edward, “I wouldn’t have asked you what\r\nthe mark was; and what’s more, if you had told me the mark I could\r\nhave told you the owner. Good lord!” he muttered, “what other man in\r\nEngland!... Had he hauled his Jewish Encyclopedia down there?” he\r\nsuddenly turned round to ask.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said George eagerly, “how did you know?”\r\n\r\n“Oh nothing,” said Edward, “only I know he is fond of it. Did you eat\r\nham?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said George thinking closely, “I did. Yes, I remember\r\ndistinctly, I did.”\r\n\r\nThe expression of Edward was completely satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe time had come for their return. George, whose carelessness about\r\nmoney had received very distinct and very severe shocks in the last few\r\nmonths--nay, in the last few days--insisted upon paying, and Edward,\r\nwho knew more than was good for him, allowed him to pay: and further\r\nadvised him to spend the morrow, Thursday, in bed. “At any rate,” he\r\nconcluded, “not where the sharks can get at you. Wait till Dolly sends,\r\nand that’ll be Friday, I know.”\r\n\r\nThey drove back to Demaine House, and Sudie, having heard the news from\r\nhalf London, was left to deal with the truant as she saw fit.\r\n\r\nAs for Edward, he was back late at night in Downing Street where\r\nbread-and-butter called him. But he found his chief with the mood of\r\nthat happy afternoon long past, for, one encumbrance well discharged,\r\nthe other did but the more gravely harass him, and the memory of\r\nRepton, of Repton doing he knew not what,--perhaps at that very moment\r\nwrecking any one of twenty political arrangements--tortured him beyond\r\nbearing.\r\n\r\nBut as the Premier had justly thought that afternoon, the tide had\r\nturned; and when the tide turns in the fairway of a harbour, though it\r\nturns here and there with eddies and with doubt, at last it sets full,\r\nand so it was now with the fortunes of our beloved land and of its\r\ntwentyfold beloved Cabinet.\r\n\r\nRepton was at that very moment restored to his right mind--his Caryll’s\r\nGanglia were restored to their normal function--and would never tell\r\nthe truth again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAll night Sir Charles Repton had tossed in an uneasy slumber; all night\r\nhis faithful wife Maria had sat up watching him. She dared not trust a\r\ntrained nurse; she dared not trust a single member of the household,\r\nfor he muttered as he slept strange things concerning the governance of\r\nEngland, and stranger things concerning his own financial schemes.\r\n\r\nAt one moment, it was about half-past four in the morning,--much at the\r\ntime when Demaine, seventy miles away, upon the bosom of the ocean, had\r\nwoken to see the sun--his predecessor in the Wardenship of the Court\r\nof Dowry (and still the titular holder of that office) had started\r\nsuddenly up in bed, and violently denounced a man with an Austrian name\r\nas having cheated him by obtaining prior information upon the Budget.\r\nHe asked rapidly in his mania why Consols had gone up in the first week\r\nof April, and would not be pacified until his wife, with the tact that\r\nis born of affection, had assumed the rôle of the unpleasing foreigner\r\nand had confessed all. Then and then only was he pacified and fell into\r\nthe first true sleep he had enjoyed for twenty-four hours. He slept\r\nuntil eleven, and she, brave woman that she was, snatched some little\r\nsleep at his side, but only upon the edge of sleep as it were, waking\r\nat any moment to shield him from the consequences of his disease.\r\n\r\nWhen he woke she herself made it her duty to go downstairs and fetch\r\nhim his breakfast, but though his repose had recruited his body, his\r\ndear mind was still unhinged.\r\n\r\nHe would have it that the Royal Family when they invested in some\r\nconcern were not registered under their true names, and he began a long\r\nwild rambling harangue about the death duties and some new story about\r\nyet another outlandish name, and the insufficiency of the taxes for\r\nwhich it was responsible. The whole thing was described in a manner so\r\nclear and sensible as added to the horror of the contrast between his\r\nsanity and that other dreadful mood.\r\n\r\nBy noon, still lying in his bed, he was contrasting to her wearied ear\r\nthe cost of the Tubes in London as against those in Paris, and making\r\njokes about “boring through the London clay.” He went on to ask why a\r\nfriend of his had drawn his salary as a Minister for some little time\r\nafter his death, and suddenly went off at a tangent upon the noble\r\nself-sacrifice of Lord Axton in exiling himself to a tropic clime,\r\nthreatening that unfortunate peer with certain bankruptcy and possible\r\nimprisonment unless a report upon the Bitsu Marsh were favourable. Then\r\nfor a blessed half-hour he was silent.\r\n\r\nAt the end of it he called for a pen and paper, and wrote a number of\r\nshort notes. Luckily he gave them to her to be posted; she read but a\r\nfew, and with trembling hands she burned them all, even the stamps,\r\nthough she knew how particular he had been in the old days on that\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nHe dressed and came down. She persuaded him--oh how lovingly,--to\r\nsit in his favourite room overlooking the Park. She forgot that it\r\noverlooked the crowded throng, and from close upon one until late in\r\nthe afternoon this devoted angel clung to him while he poured out\r\nmeaningless denunciations of all his world, up hill and down dale,\r\nrelieved from time to time (a relief to him but not to her) by a sudden\r\nthrowing up of the window, and an address to the passers-by.\r\n\r\nHe warned more than one omnibus as it passed, of an approaching combine\r\nbetween the various lines, and urged the shareholders to buy while yet\r\nthere was time. At one awful moment he had begun excitedly to point out\r\nthe figure of a Bishop upon the opposite pavement and to begin a full\r\nbiography of that hierarch, when she thought it her duty to slam down\r\nthe window and to bear the weight of his anger rather than permit the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nSmall knots of people gathered outside the house, but the police had\r\nbeen warned and they were easily dispersed, with no necessity for\r\nviolence beyond the loss of a tooth or two on the part of the crowd.\r\n\r\nAs though her task were not enough, the house was full of the noise of\r\nbells, message after message calling for news and for information, but\r\nshe had already given orders to the secretary to write out whatever\r\ncommonplace messages might occur to him, and he faithfully performed\r\nhis duty.\r\n\r\nIn her confusion she could see no issue but to try yet another night’s\r\nsleep, and when he carried his hand to his head as he now and then\r\ndid, when the touch of pain stung him, she comforted herself with this\r\nassurance, that a paroxysm of such violence could not long endure.\r\n\r\nI say a paroxysm of such violence, though there was nothing violent in\r\nthe man’s demeanour: the horror lay in the cold contrast between the\r\npleasant easy tone in which the things were said and the things that\r\nwere said in that pleasant easy tone, while the violence was no more\r\nthan the violence of contrast between his absurd affirmations and the\r\nquiet current of the national life.\r\n\r\nThe printing of one-tenth of those simple, easily delivered words might\r\nhave ruined the country. We owe it to Lady Repton--and I trust it will\r\nnever be forgotten--that no syllable of them all was printed, and that\r\nthe greater part of them were not even heard by any other ear than her\r\nown.\r\n\r\nShe had persuaded him to an early dinner; she had even put it at the\r\namazing hour of half-past seven. She had ordered such food as she knew\r\nhe best loved, and the wine that soothed him most--which happened to\r\nbe a Norman champagne. She was particular to request a full service of\r\nattendance, for her experience told her that in such surroundings he\r\nwas ever at his best.\r\n\r\nAnother attack of pain in the head seized him and passed. She sat\r\ndoggedly, and endured. This admirable wife after her day-long watch was\r\nexhausted and heart-sick. She saw no issue anywhere. She sat by her\r\nhusband’s side, starting nervously at the least sound from below, and\r\nlistening to his impossible commentaries upon contemporary life, his\r\nhair-raising stories of his friends, his colleagues and even of her own\r\nreligious pastors, and his bouts of self-revelations, or rather let\r\nus hope, of diseased imaginings, when there was put into her hand an\r\nexpress letter.\r\n\r\nThe superscription was peculiar; it ran:\r\n\r\n  To the Rt. Hon.\r\n      To the\r\n          The Lady C. Repton, M.V.O.\r\n\r\nShe opened it in wonderment. Its contents were far simpler than its\r\nexterior: they ran as follows:\r\n\r\n  “MADAM,--Your husband’s case noted as per enclosed cutting. I know\r\n  what is wrong with him and I can cure him. My price is five hundred\r\n  dollars ($500.00) one hundred pounds (£100). The operation is\r\n  warranted not to take more than ten minutes of his valuable time.\r\n\r\n  “Will call upon you when you are through tea and he is quite rested,\r\n  somewheres round eight o’clock.\r\n\r\n                          “Yrs. etc.,       SCIPIO KNICKERBOCKER”\r\n\r\n\r\nCaught in the fold of this short note was a newspaper paragraph and a\r\ncard printed in gold letters upon imitation ivory:\r\n\r\n  DR. SCIPIO KNICKERBOCKER, M.D.\r\n      415 Tenth St.\r\n          London, Ont.\r\n\r\n  And the Savoy Hotel.\r\n\r\nHad she been alone she would have prayed for guidance.\r\n\r\nEight o’clock, of all hours! And what was “Ont.”?\r\n\r\nDrowning women catch at straws. Under no other conceivable\r\ncircumstances would Lady Repton have caught at such a wretched straw\r\nas this. But the faculty had deserted her, she had no remedy; she saw,\r\nshe knew, everybody knew, that her husband was mad; she divined from\r\ntwenty indications and especially from the suddenness of the pain, that\r\nthe madness was some simple case of mechanical pressure. And suppose\r\nthis man really knew how to cure him? She dared not ask her husband to\r\nput yet earlier the hour of his meal, at which he had already grumbled;\r\nbeside which, it was too late. The incomprehensible Scipio would arrive.\r\n\r\nShe was still in an agony of doubt when she accompanied her husband\r\n(who as he went down the stairs and entered the dining-room was\r\nchatting gaily upon the amours of a prominent member of the Opposition)\r\nand as their lonely meal proceeded in the presence of those great\r\nover-dressed mutes, their servants, to all her other anxieties was\r\nadded her irresolution upon the prime question, whether she should or\r\nshould not accept the desperate aid of an utterly unknown man, perhaps\r\nan adventurer.\r\n\r\nJust as Sir Charles had finished his soup, and with it his amusing\r\nlittle story about the Baronetcy which though it had been paid for by\r\nthe son and heir (who was solvent) came out after all in the Birthday\r\nList as a Knighthood,--just as he had finished his soup I say, he gave\r\na loud cry and put both hands to his head just behind the ears.\r\n\r\n“Crickey how it hurts, William!” he remarked to the butler.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sir Charles,” said the butler in the tone of a hierarch at his\r\ndevotions.\r\n\r\n“It’s gone now,” said the Baronet, with a sigh of relief, “but it\r\n_does_ hurt when it comes! What’s the fish?” and he continued his meal.\r\n\r\nHe drank a great gulp of wine and was better.... “It’s dry,” he said\r\ndoubtfully, “it’s too dry ... but there are advantages to _that_. You\r\nknow why they make wine dry, William?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sir Charles.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you do, do you? You’re getting too smart. You couldn’t tell me,\r\nI’ll bet brazils!”\r\n\r\n“No, Sir Charles.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Repton with a merry wink, “it’s to save your mouth next\r\nmorning!” Then up went his hands to his head again and he groaned.\r\n\r\n“Is your head hurting you again, darling?” said Lady Repton when she\r\nsaw the gesture repeated.\r\n\r\n“Yes, damnably,” said Sir Charles in a loud tone. “It’s hurting just\r\nunder both ears, just where Sambo gave ... ah! that’s better ... (a\r\ngasp) ... gave the Tomtit that nasty one in the big fight I went to see\r\nlast week--the night I telephoned home to say that I was kept at the\r\nHouse,” he added by way of explanation.\r\n\r\nThe servants stood around like posts, and Lady Repton endured her agony.\r\n\r\n“I think what I should have enjoyed most,” mused Sir Charles after this\r\nrevelation, “would have been to run across old Prout just as I came out\r\nof that Club. Not that he knows anything about such things, but still,\r\nit was a pretty lousy place. Besides which, the people I was with! It\r\nwould have been fun to see old Prout sit up. Shouldn’t wonder if he’d\r\nrefused to let me speak at the Parson’s Show after that; and in _that_\r\ncase,” ended Sir Charles significantly tapping his trousers pocket,\r\n“there’d be an end to the wherewith!” He nodded genially to his wife.\r\n“There’d be a drying up of the needful! Wouldn’t there, William?” he\r\nsuddenly demanded of the gorgeous domestic, who was at that moment\r\npouring him out some wine.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sir Charles,” said the hireling in a tone of the deepest respect.\r\n\r\n“That’s what keeps ’em going, my dear,” he said, “and here’s to you,”\r\nhe added, lifting his glass. “Are you put out about something?” he\r\nsaid, with real kindness in his voice.\r\n\r\n“It’s nothing, it’s nothing,” said that really Christian woman, nearly\r\nbursting into tears.\r\n\r\n“I’m really very sorry if I’ve hurt your feelings in any way, my dear,”\r\nsaid Charles Repton.\r\n\r\nNo symptom of his malady was more distressing than this unmanly\r\nsoftness, it was so utterly different from his daily habit.\r\n\r\n“I’d never dream of wounding her ladyship intentionally; would I,\r\nWilliam?” he asked again.\r\n\r\n“No, Sir Charles,” said William.\r\n\r\n“I think we’d better go upstairs, dear,” said the unfortunate lady. “Oh\r\ndear!” she sighed as a sudden peal rang through the house, and then\r\nsubsiding, she said: “Oh it’s only a bell!”\r\n\r\n“Her ladyship’s nervous to-night, William,” said Repton as one man\r\nshould to another.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sir Charles,” repeated William in a grave monotone.\r\n\r\nA card was brought in upon a salver of enormous dimensions and of\r\nremarkable if hideous workmanship.\r\n\r\nLady Repton recognised the name.\r\n\r\n“I must go out a moment. I’ll be back in a moment, Charles.” She looked\r\nat him with a world of anxiety and affection, and left him chatting\r\ngaily to the servant.\r\n\r\nScipio Knickerbocker stood without.\r\n\r\nAny doubts upon the matter were settled not only by his appearance but\r\nby his first phrase which ran in a singular intonation:\r\n\r\n“Lady _C._ Repton? I am Scipio Knickerbocker, M.D. (Phillipsville),\r\nMa’am,”--and he bowed. He was an exceedingly small man; he wore very\r\nlong hair beautifully parted in the middle; his jaw was so square,\r\ndeep and thrust forward as to be a positive malformation, but to\r\nconvey at the same time an impression of indomitable will, not to\r\nsay mulish obstinacy. His arms and legs were evidently too thin for\r\nhealth, and the development of his chest was deplorable. He was dressed\r\nin exceedingly good grey cloth, but his collar, oddly enough, was of\r\ncelluloid. His buttoned boots were of patent leather, his tie had been\r\ntied once and for ever, and sewed into the shape it bore. He carried in\r\nhis left hand an ominous little black leather bag.\r\n\r\n“Come into this room,” said Lady Repton hurriedly. She took him into\r\na small room next to the dining-room, and communicating with it by a\r\nlittle door; she switched on the electric light and stood while she\r\nasked him breathlessly what credentials he had.\r\n\r\n“Ma’am,” said the physician in a metallic staccato, “I hev no\r\ncredentials. What I propose to-night will be my sole credential.”\r\n\r\nIn the silence before her reply, Sir Charles’ merry monologue,\r\noccasionally broken by the grave assent of the butler, could be heard\r\nin the next room.\r\n\r\n“What do you say you can do?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Ma’am, let me first tell _you_ right now what the Senator’s gotten\r\nwrawng with him. In nineteen fourteen, month of September, I could not\r\nhev told you; but in nineteen fourteen, month of October, I could: fur\r\nyour distinguished British physicist _and_ biologist, Henry Upton, then\r\npro-mulgated his eppoch-making discovery. You hev hurd tell of Caryll’s\r\nGanglia?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Lady Repton nervously, and in a quavering voice, “I have\r\nnot.”\r\n\r\n“Ma’am,” said the Imperial authority with perfect composure, “I hev\r\nthem here.”\r\n\r\nHe dived into his bag and produced a little card on which was perfectly\r\nindicated the back of the human head, only with the skin and hair\r\nremoved; two lumps on either side of the neck of this diagram bore in\r\nlarge red letters, “Caryll’s Ganglia,” and two white lines leading from\r\nthem bore in smaller type, “Caryll’s Ducts.”\r\n\r\nThis card he gravely put into her hands. She looked at it with some\r\ndisgust: it reminded her of visits to the butchers’ during the\r\nimpecuniosity of her early married life.\r\n\r\nWhen, as the Son of Empire fondly imagined, his hostess had thoroughly\r\ngrasped the main lines of cerebral anatomy, he suddenly thrust his hand\r\ninto the bag again and pulled out a little pamphlet, which, as it is\r\ncarefully printed at the end of this book and as the reader will most\r\ncertainly skip it, I shall not inflict upon her in this place.\r\n\r\nIt was a reproduction, in portable form, of the great lecture delivered\r\nin the January of that year at the Royal Institute. It set forth the\r\nlate Henry Upton’s discovery that Caryll’s Ganglia were the seat of\r\nself-restraint and due caution in the Human Brain.\r\n\r\nThe poor woman was too bewildered to make head or tail of it, and\r\nwhether the reader give herself the pains to peruse it or no is\r\nindifferent, for its contents in no way affect this powerful and moving\r\ntale.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” he said when she lifted her eyes from it and as he fondly\r\nimagined had mastered its details,--“you do not perhaps see the\r\ncon-nection.”\r\n\r\nHer face assured him that she did not.\r\n\r\n“Neither,” he added grandiloquently, “did the world, until I perceived\r\nthat if indeed such functions attached to Caryll’s Ganglia, why\r\nthe least obstruction of their ducts would condemn the sufferer to\r\noccasional violent pain accompanied by such inability to refrain\r\nfrom expression as must ruin his career and ultimately make a wreck\r\nof his bodily frame. Madame, cases of such obstruction I hev found\r\nto hev occurred in the ducts. Madame, _I_ discovered by what slight\r\ntouch of the lancet the tiny _im_pediment could be instantly removed.\r\nMadame,” he continued, “the Caryll’s ducts in Sir Charles’ head are\r\nob-structed, hence the recurrent pain and the lamentable attack of\r\nVERACITITIS from which he in-dub-it-ab-ly suffers.”\r\n\r\n“Velossy what?” gasped Lady Repton.\r\n\r\n“_Veracititis_, Ma’am. The phrase is my own; for it is I who have\r\nidentified the relation between the ganglia and the distressing\r\nsymptoms you have observed. He stands before you, _he_ does. Madame, it\r\nis already enshrined in the proofs of the Columbia Encyclopedia”--he\r\ndived once more into his bag and handed her yet another paper--“as\r\n_Veracititis Knickerbockeriensis_. In Ontario since Washington’s\r\nBirthday, we hev hed three cases; I was called over privately a month\r\nago for a most distressing case, luckily suppressed--never hurd of,\r\nMadame, outside the family. I hev operated with success. Ma’am, I can\r\noperate with success upon your husband.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment a loud scream of pain from the next room, followed by a\r\ngasp of relief and the expletive “Great Cæsar’s Ghost!” almost decided\r\nSir Charles’ faithful spouse. Another scream that proved the spasms to\r\nbe increasing in violence quite decided her. She hurriedly re-entered\r\nthe dining-room, found Sir Charles white with the severity of the\r\nsuffering, and took him gently by the hand.\r\n\r\n“Darling,” she said, “I have a practitioner who can relieve this. He is\r\nwaiting for you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” sighed Sir Charles, as the pain left him, “I’m glad to hear it,\r\nprofoundly glad. They’re all such scoundrels, Maria, ... but if he’s a\r\nsurgeon and can cut something out, I’ll trust him.”\r\n\r\n“It won’t be as bad as that,” said Maria, tenderly helping the Baronet\r\nout through the small door towards the inner room.\r\n\r\nHardly had he set his eyes on the little doctor when he burst into a\r\nhearty laugh.\r\n\r\n“What a ridiculous little ass, Maria!” he said at the top of his voice.\r\n“Good lord, what a little rat!”\r\n\r\nIf proof were wanted of the truth of Scipio’s contention, his demeanour\r\nat this painful moment was sufficient. It was plainly evident to Lady\r\nRepton’s not insufficient dose of intellect that no man would have\r\nstood firm who had not seen the ghastly disease in its worst forms\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Sir Charles, “so you’re going to cut me up, are you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! _My_ no!” said Scipio. “Lady Repton would never hev permitted\r\na serious operation without your full con-currence. My proposition,\r\nSenator, is nawthing but two slight pricks in the neighbourhood of the\r\npain. Ye’ll hardly feel it, but it’ll change ye,” added the determined\r\nKnickerbocker with a suspicion of a smile upon his bony jaws.\r\n\r\n“What with?” said Sir Charles a little nervously. (“Ouch!” by way of\r\ndigression as there was a stab of pain.) “Yes, anything, s’long as you\r\ncan do it quickly.”\r\n\r\n“It don’t take but a moment,” said Scipio. “But there’d better be some\r\none hold your hands. There’s no pain worth accountin’.”\r\n\r\n“Might we re-quest the Senator to be seated?” he politely suggested to\r\nthe lady.\r\n\r\nSir Charles as politely commented: “I’m not a Senator, you skimpy\r\nlittle fool! Good lord, Maria, where do people like that come from?”\r\n\r\nAnd as he chatted thus, Scipio passed one firm hard skeleton hand over\r\nthe top of that great brain, and with the other, even as Sir Charles,\r\nwith his chin bent upon his chest, was occupied in explaining to Maria\r\nthe physical deficiencies of his medical attendant, he put the edge of\r\nthe lancet in the precise position behind the ear which his science had\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n“It’s his beastly Yankee accent, if it isn’t that beastlier thing, the\r\nAustralian,” the great Imperialist was in the act of saying when the\r\nlancet struck suddenly and was as suddenly withdrawn.\r\n\r\n“You’re quite right, monkey,” said Sir Charles in a weaker voice, “it’s\r\nonly a prick, and I think”--his voice still sinking,--“that it’s only\r\ndue to your great position in the medical world that I should express\r\nmy heartfelt thanks for your courteous services. It is men like you,\r\nsir, who mean to suffering humanity....” Sir Charles suddenly stopped.\r\nHis voice grew a little louder. “Did you say he was a Yankee or an\r\nAustralian, Maria? Australians have the Cockney ‘a’; a filthy thing it\r\nis, too!”\r\n\r\nThe skeleton hand was poised again upon Sir Charles’ head; he felt\r\nhis chin pressed down upon his chest; there was another sharp little\r\nstroke, this time behind his left ear, and with a deep sigh he seemed\r\nto sink into himself.\r\n\r\nScipio quietly touched the delicate point of his instrument with\r\nantiseptic wool, put it back into its case and watched his patient with\r\na professional eye.\r\n\r\nThe man was dazed. He gripped his wife’s hand until he almost caused\r\nher pain, and they could hear him mutter disconnected words:\r\n\r\n“The highest possible appreciation.... My public position alone ...\r\nsufficient reward ... in its way a link between ... provinces ... our\r\ngreat Empire ... daughter ... daughter ... daughter....” Then almost\r\ninaudibly “... nations.”\r\n\r\nFor perhaps five minutes the Great Statesman was silent, and his\r\nbreathing was so regular that he might have been asleep.\r\n\r\n“Will he go to sleep, doctor?” whispered Lady Repton.\r\n\r\nScipio Knickerbocker shook his head. “He’ll be less rattled every\r\nminute, Ma’am,” was his pronouncement, and once again he proved his\r\nscience by the justice of his prognostication.\r\n\r\nSir Charles stood up, a little groggy, leant one hand on the back of a\r\nchair, took a deep breath, stood up more strongly, and said at last in\r\na voice still weak but quite clear:--\r\n\r\n“Thank you sir. How can I thank you? I seem to remember”--he passed his\r\nhand over his forehead--“I seem to remember some one telling me that\r\nyou were born,--though I assure you it is impossible for us in England\r\nto distinguish it,--in one of our Britains Overseas. Sir, an action\r\nsuch as that which you have just done--a good deed if I may call it\r\nso,” he went on more loudly, seizing Scipio’s right hand between both\r\nof his, “is a cement of Empire! I will never forget it, never! Will you\r\nexcuse me a moment sir, while I speak to Lady Repton?”\r\n\r\nWith his best and most winning smile Sir Charles asked this question of\r\nScipio, who for the tenth or eleventh time that evening, bowed with a\r\nkink in the fourteenth vertebra.\r\n\r\nHe drew his wife into the hall.\r\n\r\n“I suppose he wants payment on the spot, doesn’t he, Maria? These\r\nspecialists usually do.”\r\n\r\n“Yes dear,” said Lady Repton, her old awe returning with his changed\r\nmood. “Yes dear, I’m afraid he does ... he ... in fact, I’m afraid I\r\npromised it him.”\r\n\r\n“How much?” said Sir Charles sternly.\r\n\r\n“Well dear, it doesn’t matter, does it? I’ll pay.”\r\n\r\n“But it does matter. It matters a great deal, Maria. It all comes out\r\nof _my_ pocket in the long run. How much did he stipulate for?”\r\n\r\n“A hundred pounds,” said Lady Repton.\r\n\r\n“Oh come,” said Sir Charles, greatly relieved. “A hundred! That’s a\r\ngood lot. How often will he come for that?”\r\n\r\n“He won’t want to come again, dear,” said Lady Repton.\r\n\r\n“What!” said Sir Charles, “a hundred pounds for that?”\r\n\r\n“My dear--if you knew the difference!” said Lady Repton.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I know,” he said impatiently, “the pain’s gone. It can’t be\r\nhelped, and of course ninety’s a broken sum. He’d have taken fifty,\r\nMaria. I ought to have seen to this myself,” he added.\r\n\r\nAnd so, the matter settled, he returned.\r\n\r\n“You’ll allow me to leave you one moment with her ladyship,” he said in\r\nhis most winning manner. Then suddenly, “_Good_-night,” and with a warm\r\ngrasp of the hand Sir Charles left them.\r\n\r\nLady Repton was moved beyond words. She put into the young man’s hand a\r\npacket of notes which she had carefully prepared. “It is nothing,” she\r\nsaid, “it is nothing for what you have done, but oh, doctor, will it\r\nlast?”\r\n\r\n“It’ll last for ever--at least,” he corrected himself hurriedly,\r\n“they’ve all lasted so fur, and it’s more’n a year since I did the\r\nfirst. It isn’t the _kind_ er thing that comes on again. ’Tain’t a\r\ngrowth.” He was almost going to say what it was, when he remembered\r\nthat he held the monopoly. Then, lest he should stay too long in\r\nthat house where he was, after all, but a paid instrument, he very\r\ncourteously bade her good-night, and as he went home, carrying\r\nhis little bag, Scipio reflected that he liked Maria, Lady Repton,\r\nbetter than he did her husband. But he remembered that operations for\r\nVeracititis were, of their nature, causes for grievous disillusion.\r\n\r\nHe put the matter from his mind and took a cab back to his hotel and to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nThus was Sir Charles Repton cured of Veracititis, late upon Wednesday\r\nnight, the 3rd of June, 1915, and he slept his old sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Friday morning, the 5th of June, 1915, and the young and popular\r\nPrime Minister was busied in the Inaugural Ceremony of the Wardenship\r\nof the Court of Dowry.\r\n\r\nRepton or no Repton, the place must be filled. Demaine was back and\r\nDemaine must be there on the front bench before there was an explosion.\r\n\r\nThe Inaugural Ceremony which introduces a Statesman to the Wardenship\r\nof the Court of Dowry, technically called “L’Acceptance,” in strict\r\nconstitutional practice requires the presence of at least three\r\npersons, the outgoing Warden (technically the Dischargee), the incoming\r\nWarden (technically the Discoverer) and the Sovereign; but since\r\nGHERKIN had, in spite of his eccentric Radicalism, raised the office\r\nto its present position, the outgoing Warden could be represented by\r\nproxy, though such a substitution was rarely made since it eliminated\r\nthe quaint custom of the “Braise”--one hundred pounds one hundred\r\nshillings one hundred pence, and a new brass farthing specially minted\r\nfor the occasion, the whole in a silver-gilt case, and handed over to\r\nthe outgoer, to be regarded with historic respect and some one of its\r\ncoins to be kept as an heirloom.[5]\r\n\r\nBut Dolly, as he considered the situation on the Friday morning, Friday\r\nthe 5th of June, 1915, could see no way out of it; he must simply tell\r\nLady Repton briefly, and best by telephone, that she must not dream of\r\nher husband’s appearing at Court, even with a keeper, and that it would\r\nbe necessary for the Repton household to forego the hundred sovereigns,\r\nthe hundred shillings, the hundred pence and the new brass farthing\r\nspecially minted for the occasion (the whole in a silver-gilt case),\r\nrather than have a scandal.\r\n\r\nIt was Friday, and he was glad to remember it, a Private Members’ Day.\r\nThere were no questions. There was all Saturday and Sunday before\r\nhim. He would arrange for the Inauguration the very next week. He was\r\nalready advised that the officials had been permitted by the highest\r\nauthority, in view of Demaine’s recent privations when he was blown\r\nout to sea in the little boat, treacherously abandoned by the foreign\r\nvessel and rescued by the willing hands, etc., to omit the final\r\naccolade with the ebony cudgel which had now for so many generations\r\nformed the last and most picturesque feature of the ritual.\r\n\r\nHe took up his telephone and asked the next room to put him on to\r\nthe Reptons. He held the receiver while a servant told him that his\r\nmessage should be immediately communicated, and then in a few seconds,\r\nheard, to his great astonishment, not the tremulous tones of Maria, but\r\nthe masterly voice of Sir Charles, as incisive and direct as of old,\r\nsaying, “What is it?” in the tone of a man who must come at once to\r\nbusiness and has many things to do.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” cried Dolly into the machine, quite taken aback. “That’s you,\r\nRepton, is it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course,” came the answer shortly. “Well?”\r\n\r\n“Oh nothing. Are you feeling better?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean.” This in restrained, quite unmistakable\r\ntones. “My headache’s gone, if that’s what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“Ye-es,” said the Prime Minister, wondering what on earth to say.\r\n“Yes.... Oh it’s gone, has it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes it has; I’ve told you that already.” Then after a pause, “Look\r\nhere, I’m really very busy. I’ve got three men here about that absurd\r\nconcession. You gave me a free hand, and I can’t wait. Hope I’m not\r\nrude. It’s really very kind to ask after my health. You’ll be in the\r\nHouse at twelve?” And the telephone suddenly rang off.\r\n\r\nDolly was in a stupor; he did what he always did, when things perplexed\r\nhim: he sent for Edward.\r\n\r\n“Edward,” he said, “that cracked Dissenter has got three men in his\r\nhouse and is talking about the oil concession to them! Oh lord!”\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister was evidently frightened and troubled, but he did\r\nnot seem less frightened and more troubled than the occasion warranted.\r\nHe couldn’t make Repton out: there seemed to be another change.\r\n\r\nEdward answered simply: “Why that makes three more who know,--that’s\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“Do get a taxi,” said the Prime Minister, “and see what you can do.”\r\nAnd he waited anxiously till Edward returned.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Dolly as he entered.\r\n\r\n“Well!” said Edward. “He wasn’t very polite, but--but--are you quite\r\nsure that you weren’t worried when you saw him on Tuesday?”\r\n\r\n“Worried,” said Dolly, “I should think I was!”\r\n\r\n“Well that’s what I mean,” said Edward a little uneasily. “Didn’t you\r\n... didn’t you perhaps exaggerate a little?”\r\n\r\n“_Exaggerate!_” said Dolly, jumping up with all his youthful vigour,\r\nand looking for the moment less than forty-eight in his excitement,\r\n“Why man alive, he was wearing a huge great Easter Lily in his\r\nbuttonhole, and he tried to wrestle with the butler in the hall!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but you know,” said Edward, “there’s gaiety in everybody, and it\r\ncomes out now and----”\r\n\r\n“Oh gaiety be blasted!” interrupted Dolly. “The man was raving!”\r\n\r\n“Well, they wouldn’t certify him anyhow,” said Edward, “and he’s\r\nnot raving _now_! He’s as sane as a waxen image, and as sharp as an\r\nunexpected pin. I’m glad _I’m_ not doing business with him to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Look here,” protested the Prime Minister. “If he wasn’t off, why\r\ndid he stay at home like a prisoner all Wednesday, with Lady Repton\r\npreventing any one seeing him? And what was he doing all yesterday,\r\nThursday? Why didn’t he come down to the House, eh, if he wasn’t off?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say he wasn’t ill,” said Edward blandly. “I only said there\r\nmight have been some exaggeration.”\r\n\r\n“Oh very well,” ended the Prime Minister wearily, “oh very well!”\r\n\r\nEdward came to a swift decision and telephoned first to the _Moon_ then\r\nto the _Capon_ privately that “it was all right about Repton; there’d\r\nbeen a mistake.” His chief went out on the duties of the day.\r\n\r\nYet _another_ change of plan! More bother! He would have to go through\r\nwith the peerage now! He went gloomily down to the House of Commons and\r\nlearned that Charles Repton was already in his place, stiff, groomed\r\nand regular upon the Treasury bench.\r\n\r\nDolly came in nervously and shook hands with him.\r\n\r\nSir Charles took his hand rather coldly; he did not see why a couple\r\nof days’ headache which no one had heard about should be made the\r\nexcuse for so much public affection. It emphasised the thing. And he\r\nsat through the first hour of the debate looking as if he would have\r\nbeen just as well pleased to be made less fuss about. “Anyhow,” he\r\nthought to himself by way of consolation, “I shall be rid of it next\r\nweek,” and his mind turned in an equable fashion to his taking his seat\r\nin the Upper House and to what his first business there might be.\r\n\r\nAs he was so thinking George Mulross Demaine came in quietly by one of\r\nthe side doors. As he entered there was a little subdued cheering from\r\nthose who remembered the announcement of his approaching appointment.\r\nIt flurried him a little. He sat down and tried to forget it, while the\r\ndebate maundered on.\r\n\r\nIn the Lobbies Repton continued to suffer somewhat from occasional\r\ncongratulations on his return to health. He did not easily understand\r\nthem, and he was a trifle gruff in his replies. He was going into the\r\nlibrary for a little peace when a messenger put a note into his hand;\r\nit was from the Duke of Battersea.\r\n\r\n“More fuss!” he thought, but he went immediately with his stiff,\r\nupright gait to where that great Financier was waiting for him, and he\r\ngreeted him warmly enough.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, like the business man he was, was very brief and to the\r\npoint. He congratulated Charles Repton not (thank heaven!) on having\r\ngot rid of the slight headache which seemed to have filled the thoughts\r\nof too many people, but upon the great accession the Upper House was\r\nto receive, and then the Duke having said so much went on to what he\r\nreally had to say, his pronunciation marred only by that slight lisp\r\nwhich ill-natured reports so constantly exaggerated. Sir Charles Repton\r\n(he said) would remember the very disgraceful case of the editor of the\r\n_Islington Hebdomadal Review_?\r\n\r\nCharles Repton tried to remember, but could not.\r\n\r\nWell, it wath the cathe of the man who had very properly got twenty\r\nyearth of the betht for thaying that he could reveal how old\r\nBallymulrock had got his peerage ... a dithgratheful cathe! There wath\r\nblackmail behind it!\r\n\r\nYes, Charles Repton could remember now, and he smiled a grim smile as\r\nhe considered the peculiar ineptitude of that particular convict. Why\r\nold Ballymulrock was the seventh in the title, he had nothing a year,\r\nhe was a doddering old bachelor of eighty-seven, he had got it by a\r\nfluke from a half-nephew, and it was only an Irish elective peerage at\r\nthat! The convict had pleaded a misprint! What a fool! Yes, Sir Charles\r\nRepton could remember the case. What about it? “I’m not going to take\r\nany action to save him,” he said sharply, “if that’s what you want: he\r\ndeserved all he got! If you want some one get Birdwhistlethorpe; Isaacs\r\nthat was: he knows North London.”\r\n\r\n“Noh, noh, noh,” said the aged Duke of Battersea in alarm, “you\r\nmithunderthand me!” And he went on to tell the outgoing Warden that\r\nthey were determined to bring this sort of thing before the House of\r\nLords in a Resolution. Would he move?\r\n\r\n“I don’t see what I’ve got to do with it,” said Repton shortly.\r\n\r\nThe Duke smiled as he had smiled years ago, when he produced Lord\r\nBenthorpe’s paper and brought that now forgotten personage to heel. Had\r\nSir Charles seen what the _Moon_ had been saying that very day?\r\n\r\nNo, Sir Charles hadn’t. He supposed it was about the oil concessions.\r\nHe paid no attention to the _Moon_. But Edward’s telephone to the\r\n_Moon_ and the _Capon_ had borne dreadful fruit. Each editor had\r\nthought to have regained his freedom.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Battersea’s smile grew more portentous; he discovered a\r\ncutting in the inner pocket of a coat which somehow or other always\r\nlooked greasy upon him, and as Sir Charles read it, his face darkened.\r\n\r\n“It’s pretty scandalous,” he said as he laid it down. For the leader\r\nin the _Moon_ gave it to be understood in no very roundabout way that\r\nthere had been a deal over Repton’s peerage.\r\n\r\n“The _Capon’th_ worth, _far_ worth!” insinuated the Duke of Battersea.\r\n\r\n“Is it?” said Sir Charles, “indeed!”\r\n\r\n“Yeth, indeed yeth,” said the aged Duke, putting the paper forward as\r\nthough over a counter; and Sir Charles Repton could not forbear to\r\nread it. It certainly _was_ worse; it simply said point blank that the\r\nBurmah Oil Concession was the price of Repton’s promotion to the Upper\r\nHouse. And the passage ended with these words:\r\n\r\n  “We have no desire to add to a domestic affliction which no friend\r\n  of the Government regrets more sincerely than we do ourselves, and\r\n  we are willing to believe that the unfortunate gentleman, who we\r\n  fear can never again take his old place in public life, was himself\r\n  quite innocent of any such dealing; but ambitions other than his own\r\n  may have been concerned in this matter, and the giving of permanent\r\n  legislative power to a man who now notoriously can no longer take\r\n  part in active public life, does but add to the scandal.”\r\n\r\nThat decided him! He would nip off that headache legend at once, and\r\nsharply!\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “I’ll move as soon as you like, and the sooner the\r\nbetter.” He did not say it as though he was granting a favour; and it\r\nwas easy to see that the Duke was a little afraid of him:--\r\n\r\nAfter a pause during which the two men rose to part, the old gentleman\r\nsuggested that Methlinghamhurst should speak after him.\r\n\r\n“Messlingham _who_?” said Repton, puzzled. The name was unfamiliar to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“No, not Methlinghamhurtht! _Meth_linghamhurtht,” said the Duke of\r\nBattersea, rather too loud. “_Meth_linghamhurtht!”\r\n\r\nSir Charles shook his head, still puzzled. “I daresay he’s all right,”\r\nhe said all starch.\r\n\r\n“_You_ know,” said the Duke of Battersea, craning forward in a\r\nconfidential way, “Clutterbuck that wath.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Clutterbuck! Yes, I remember. Well? Can he speak?”\r\n\r\n“Not very well,” hesitated the Duke of Battersea, “but you know he\r\nwanted....”\r\n\r\n“I really don’t care,” said Sir Charles moving away. “Anyhow I’ll do\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke was profuse in his thanks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCharles Repton returned to the House of Commons. Another message!\r\n\r\n“The Prime Minister begged to see Sir Charles Repton:” really there was\r\nno end to the number of people wanting to see him that day! Charles\r\nRepton went towards Dolly’s room with such muscles showing upon his\r\nface as would have made any one afraid to say another word about\r\nthe headache,--but it was not of the headache, at least not of that\r\ndirectly, that Dolly had to speak.\r\n\r\n“Repton,” he said apologetically and in some dread, “I’m afraid I made\r\narrangements for a proxy next week--I mean for L’Acceptance you know.”\r\n\r\n“Oh you did!” said Sir Charles, really nettled. “You might have asked\r\nme first I think!”\r\n\r\n“Well, you see,” began his unfortunate chief,--\r\n\r\n“As a fact I don’t see,” said Repton drily, “but I suppose you’ve put\r\nit right. I’ve written to say I should be there.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, certainly, certainly,” said Dolly hurriedly, “I’ve changed\r\nit.” As a fact he’d done nothing of the kind and was wondering what he\r\nshould say to the proxy. “Certainly!”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Charles Repton moving towards the door. “That’s all,\r\nI suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s all,” said Dolly, with perhaps a hundred more things to\r\nsay. “I’ll see that you get notice of the exact hour.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Charles Repton briefly, and he shut the door quietly\r\nbut firmly behind him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe inaugural ceremony, though shorn for some years of the backward\r\nentrance which was its most picturesque feature, and now (though not\r\nas a precedent) of the accost with the ebony cudgel, was impressive\r\nenough. The silver-gilt case with the Three Hundred and One specially\r\nminted Coins had been put into Charles Repton’s Seisin by the Symbol\r\nof the Flask of Palm Oil, and was already on its way to his house; the\r\ntinkling shoes had been rapidly put on and off, and Demaine had sworn\r\nfealty for sergeanty in Ponthieu and the Seniory of Lucq, and all the\r\nembroglio was done.\r\n\r\nLord Repton (for he was content with that simple title--in the Manor\r\nof Giggleswick) was present for the first time upon the red benches,\r\nawaiting the moment for the debate upon the Resolution in which he was\r\nto open and move.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons George Mulross Demaine, who for the last\r\nfew days had been coaching steadily in the duties of his post, and\r\nespecially in the really difficult technicalities of replying to\r\nquestions, was reading his notes for the last time in the comfortable\r\nroom assigned to his office, and repeating to himself in a low tone the\r\nwords he had so carefully committed to memory. Edward was with him to\r\ngive him courage; and he needed such companionship.\r\n\r\nAt last he was summoned.\r\n\r\nThe House was very full for question-time, for it was known or\r\nsuspected that something of importance would take place that day. The\r\nfull nature of the crisis had been understood by very few, but the\r\ndisappearance of Demaine and his return, his terrible adventures in the\r\nfishing-boat, his night at sea, the dastardly action of the foreign\r\ncrew, and the heroic succour which had ultimately reached him were\r\npublic property.\r\n\r\nThe silent and little known young member whose disappearance from the\r\nbenches under the gallery would never have been noticed, was half a\r\nhero already in the popular mind, and had become particularly dear to\r\nhis colleagues during the anxious moments when he was believed to be\r\nlost, and when the press of London had worked that mystery for all it\r\nwas worth.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons knows a _Man_.\r\n\r\nThere was, therefore, loud and hearty cheering, which, according to the\r\nbeautiful tradition of our public life, was confined to no one part of\r\nthe assembly, when, that happy Friday, George Mulross entered rapidly\r\nfrom behind the Speaker’s chair, stumbled over the outstretched foot of\r\nthe Admiralty, his second uncle by marriage, and took his seat for the\r\nfirst time among his new colleagues upon the Treasury Bench.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister accompanied him. Congratulations suitable to the\r\noccasion were to be seen in the gestures of those in his immediate\r\nneighbourhood, and he himself wore the blest but sickly smile of a man\r\nwho is about to be hanged but who is possessed of a fixed faith in a\r\nhappy eternity.\r\n\r\nOnly one question was set down to him; he had read it and re-read it;\r\nhe had read and re-read the typewritten answer which Mr. Sorrel had\r\nfurnished him and which he had now got by heart beyond, he hoped,\r\nthe possibility of error. The questioner had chivalrously offered\r\nto withdraw his query in deference to the fatigues and anxieties\r\nthrough which the new Warden of the Court of Dowry had so recently\r\npassed, but the Prime Minister, though appreciative of that offer,\r\nrather determined that his dear young relative should win his spurs;\r\nand trivial as the subject was, Question No. 31 was by far the most\r\nimportant upon the paper for most of those present.\r\n\r\nIt concerned (of course) the wreck which still banged about, the sport\r\nof wind and wave, upon the Royal Sovereign Shoals. This aching tooth\r\nof Empire had cropped up again in yet another aspect. The Member for\r\nHarrowell, a landowner upon that coast, wanted to know whether it was\r\nnot a fact that large planks studded, he was ashamed to say, with long\r\nrusty nails, had not drifted shorewards from the wreck and grievously\r\nscratched such persons as were indulging in mixed bathing just off the\r\npopular and rapidly rising seaside resort which lay a little east by\r\nnorth of the wretched derelict.\r\n\r\nQuestion No. 29 was answered, Question 30 was answered. Demaine’s\r\nordeal had come.\r\n\r\nHe heard a low mumbling noise some distance down the benches which he\r\nwould never have taken to be the single word “Thirty-one” had not his\r\nmother’s half-sister’s husband the Chancellor of the Exchequer given\r\nhim a sharp dig in the ribs with his elbow and jolted him onto his\r\nfeet. His hands shook like a motor car at rest as he began his reply.\r\n\r\n“I have nothing to tell my right honourable gentleman--I mean my\r\nhonourable gentleman....” Here there was a pause, painful to all\r\npresent with the exception of one ribald fellow who cackled twice and\r\nthen was silent.... “I have nothing to add,” George Mulross began again\r\nwith a lump in his throat, “in reply to my honourable friend--to\r\nwhat my predecessor said in reply to a similar” (another pause) ...\r\n“Oh,--_question_--upon the tenth of this month.”\r\n\r\nHe had read all of it out now, anyhow, and he sat down, a trifle\r\nunsteadily, feeling for the seat.\r\n\r\n“Arre we to onderrstand,” boomed the voice of the inevitable fanatic,\r\n“that the carrgo of GIN is yet aboorrd...?”\r\n\r\n“Hey! what?” said Demaine over his shoulder, with a startled air.\r\n\r\n“Get up and ask for notice,” whispered a colleague very hurriedly. “Get\r\nup and say ‘I must ask for notice of that question.’ Say ‘I must ask\r\nfor notice of that question.’ Get up quick.”\r\n\r\nDemaine got up, took hold of the box, turned his back upon the\r\nquestioner and looking full at the harmless and startled Opposition\r\nsaid, not without menace:\r\n\r\n“I must ask for a notice of that question”--and sat down.\r\n\r\nThere were a few more sympathetic cheers and all was well. The Warden\r\nof the Court of Dowry was launched upon his great career.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, beyond the Central Hall, Lord Repton of Giggleswick was\r\nrising for the first time among his Peers.\r\n\r\nThat House also was full and was prepared to give the spare towering\r\nfigure and the stoical face a sympathetic hearing, for the recognition\r\nof a man who had served his country so faithfully and so well and who\r\nhad recently suffered a temporary malady of so distressing a nature was\r\nuniversal and sincere.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords knows a _Man_.\r\n\r\nLord Repton, even as plain Sir Charles, had always been an admirable\r\nparliamentary speaker: not only quick at debate but with a grave and\r\nlucid delivery which, coupled with his intimate grasp of detail and the\r\nsense of balanced judgment behind his tone, made his one of the most\r\neffective voices in our public life.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to say by what art he contrived to give in that\r\nlarge assembly the impression of speaking as quietly as though he were\r\nin a private room, and yet so managed that every word of his--every\r\nsyllable,--was heard in every corner of the House.\r\n\r\nIn the Peeresses’ Gallery women in mauve, heliotrope, eau-de-nil,\r\ncrapaud mort, and magenta, made a brilliant scheme of colour.\r\n\r\nThe Lords, who upon occasions of privilege are by custom robed, gave to\r\nthe splendid place the deeper tone of red plush and white pelts with\r\nsmall black tails which is otherwise reserved for such great occasions\r\nof state as the Opening of Parliament, the Coronation, an Impeachment\r\nor a Replevin at Large; at the bar a crowd of Commoners pressed, many\r\nof whom recognised in the faces before them those of brothers, fathers,\r\nfirst cousins, debtors, creditors and clients in business. It was\r\nan animated and an impressive scene, and the audience, large as it\r\nwas, would doubtless have been larger but for an unfortunate blunder\r\nby which the Eton and Harrow match and a particularly interesting\r\nrehearsal of the Mizraim dance were both fixed for that very afternoon.\r\n\r\nAs it was, the two hundred or more Peers present were finely\r\nrepresentative of all that is best and worst in the national life.\r\nThe aged Duke of Battersea had made a point not only of coming but\r\nof speaking upon such an occasion; the Bishops had turned up in full\r\nforce, and the Colonial Peers, now happily added to the ancient House,\r\nwere remarkable not only for their strict attention to this historic\r\nbusiness, but for their somewhat constrained attitudes: not one was\r\nabsent from his seat.\r\n\r\nThe report of a speech, however excellent, is but a dull reflection of\r\nthe original, as all may judge who consider the contrast between the\r\nentrancing rhetoric which daily holds spellbound the House of Commons\r\nand the plain prose appearing in the morning papers.\r\n\r\nIt would ill repay the reader for the courtesy and charm she has shown\r\nthroughout the perusal of these pages, were I to inflict upon her a\r\nmere verbatim transcript of Lord Repton’s famous harangue. But the\r\ngist of it well merits record here, not only because it did much to\r\nkill a poisonous spirit which had till then been growing in English\r\njournalism--but also because it was in itself a typical and splendid\r\nmonument of the things that build up the soul of a great man.\r\n\r\nHe began in the simplest manner with a review of what had determined\r\nsome of them to bring forward this Resolution. It needed no reiteration\r\nupon his part, and indeed the matter was so painful that the mere\r\nrecalling of it must be made as brief as possible.\r\n\r\n“It has been suggested that places in that House are acquired by\r\nprocess of purchase.\r\n\r\n“There, in plain English, is the accusation.”\r\n\r\nHe would remark in passing that the cowards and slanderers--he did\r\nnot hesitate to use strong language--(and even the sanctity of the\r\nprecincts could not check a murmur of approval), the cowards and\r\nslanderers who brought forward that general accusation, dared not make\r\nit particular.\r\n\r\n“In one case,” he said, turning gravely to the place where he expected\r\nto see but was disappointed not to see the very aged frame of Lord\r\nBallymulrock, “in one case which referred to a peer whose health I am\r\ndistressed to say has made it impossible for him to be present upon\r\nthis occasion” (a protest from an exceedingly old man who sat folded up\r\non high--it was Bally himself!), “in one case a direct accusation has\r\nbeen made.... Melords, you know the issue. An appeal still lies, and it\r\nis not for me to deal with a matter which is _sub judice_; but apart\r\nfrom that case, these anonymous hacks who have for so long corrupted or\r\nattempted to corrupt the public mind in respect to this House, confine\r\nthemselves to generalities upon which the law can take no hold.”\r\n\r\nIt was upon this very account that the general resolution of which\r\nhe had spoken had been framed, and he would pass at once from the\r\nunsavoury recollection of such acts, to that part of his argument which\r\nhe thought would have most weight with his fellow-subjects.\r\n\r\n“This House, including the more recent creations, the Colonial Peers,\r\nand the ex-officio additions with which a recent--and in my opinion a\r\nbeneficent reform--has recruited it, still numbers less than fifteen\r\nhundred men. Of these the ex-officio members, the lords spiritual”\r\n(and he bowed to the Bishop of Shoreham, who was deaf) “the elected\r\nmembers from the Britains Overseas (among whom I am glad to see present\r\nthe Nerbuddah Yah) between them account for no less than forty-two.\r\nTwo hundred and eighty” (he quoted from a paper in his hand) “are\r\nimbeciles, minors or permanent invalids; somewhat over fifty are for\r\none reason or another incapacitated from attendance at their debates;\r\nten are in gaol.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Melords,” he continued, “of the eleven hundred remaining--they\r\nare roughly eleven hundred,--what do we find? We find”--emphatically\r\nstriking his right-hand fist into his left-hand palm,--“we find no\r\nless than five hundred and twelve to be the sons of their fathers--or\r\nin some other way direct heirs: ninety-eight to have succeeded to their\r\ntitles from collaterals of the first or of the second degree; sixteen\r\nto have succeeded in some more distant manner; eleven to owe their\r\nposition to the revival of ancient tenures; the claims of six to have\r\nbeen recently proved through the female line; and one by Warranty and\r\nNovel Disseizin. What remains?”\r\n\r\nHe looked round the eager assembly before him with an attitude of the\r\nhead dignified but wonderfully impressive.\r\n\r\n“Melords, I ask again, what remains? _Less than four hundred men_, the\r\nrepresentatives of all the chief energies of our national life. We\r\nhave here the great champions of industry, the great admirals of our\r\nfleets, the great generals of our armies--and I am happy to include\r\nthe Salvation Army, (the head of that great organisation lifted his\r\nbiretta)--men who have distinguished themselves in every conceivable\r\npath of public life, who have loyally served their country and many of\r\nwhom after such service are still honourably poor.”\r\n\r\nAt this phrase which was evidently the approach to his peroration, many\r\nPeers who had hitherto been sitting with their knees apart, crossed one\r\nleg over the other; some few who, on the contrary, had had their legs\r\ncrossed, uncrossed them and reposed both feet upon the floor; more than\r\none took the opportunity to recline his head upon his right hand, and\r\nthe most venerable member of the bench of Bishops coughed in a manner\r\nthat would have wrung a heart of stone.\r\n\r\nWhen these slight interruptions were over, Lord Repton of Giggleswick\r\nfound it possible to proceed. He showed by a strict process of inquiry\r\nhow those to whom the abominable suggestion might conceivably apply,\r\ncould not by any stretch of the imagination amount to eighty in number.\r\n\r\n“Less than eighty men, Melords, in an assembly of fifteen hundred!\r\nHardly five per cent.--hardly, if I may use a bold metaphor, thirteen\r\npence in the pound! It is by this proportion alone, even did these\r\ndetestable falsehoods contain--which they do not--a grain of truth,\r\nthat our whole body is forsooth to be judged! But, Melords, who are\r\nthese eighty men, if I do not insult them by permitting my argument to\r\napproach their names?\r\n\r\n“I will not cite my own case; my public career is open for any man to\r\nexamine, and I think I know the temper of my own people too well to\r\ndelay upon that score. But there are around me others perhaps (I know\r\nnot) more sensitive, or less experienced in the petty villainies of the\r\nworld, than am I, who may have thought themselves especially marked out.\r\n\r\n“I ask, against which of them could such an accusation be levelled by\r\nname, without the certitude of such a result in any Court of Justice as\r\nwould silence the mouth of the libeller for many years? Is it, Melords,\r\nthe man to whom we owe the great reservoir at Sing Yan? Is it that\r\nworld-famous Englishman who by his organising ability, his untiring\r\nindustry and his knowledge of men, has built up the United Sausage\r\nCompany’s emporiums throughout the length and breadth of the land?\r\n\r\n“I might extend the list indefinitely: Melords, to no one of these, to\r\nno one member of this House I venture to say, can words of this kind be\r\naddressed without their falsity being apparent almost without need for\r\nproof.\r\n\r\n“I repeat in the words of Burke, ‘No, no, no, a thousand times no.’ I\r\nam not ashamed to recall the glorious phrase with which these walls\r\nechoed to the voice of Ephraim ten years ago: ‘Give me such principles\r\nas these and I will trample them into the dust beneath my feet!’”\r\n\r\nHaving said so much, Lord Repton sat down, and it is a tribute to the\r\nfire and the conviction of the man that a young heiress of African\r\nOrigin but recently married, who had been listening intently from the\r\nPeeresses’ Gallery throughout the latter part of the speech, gave a low\r\nmoan and fainted clean away.\r\n\r\nHer young form was borne down to the buttery by a strong posse of\r\nattendants where the air from the Terrace soon revived her. I mention\r\nthe incident only as a signal proof of the oratorical powers that had\r\nillumined Repton’s great career.\r\n\r\nAfter such an effort Lord Methlinghamhurst necessarily somewhat palled,\r\nespecially as an imperfection in his diction, failing eyesight and a\r\ncertain loss of memory compelled him to make long and uncomfortable\r\npauses over the large printed slip which he held in his hand, but\r\nit was over at last, and the Duke of Battersea rose amid the evident\r\ninterest of such as remained to hear him, no less than five of whom\r\nwere concerned with himself in the Anapootra Ruby Mines.\r\n\r\nThe great financier did well to interpose upon such an occasion. His\r\nlisp, with which the House was now familiar, was the only impediment to\r\na sincere and vigorous piece of English. There was not a word which the\r\nmost exuberant would presume to add, nor one which the most fastidious\r\nwould dare to erase.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings had occupied something close upon three-quarters of\r\nan hour, and the Senate, unused to such delays, was impatient to pass\r\nto the vote, when, to the universal horror of that hall, Ballymulrock\r\ntottered to his feet. There was almost a stampede. Luckily the Aged Man\r\nwas as brief as he was inaudible. It was a couple of squeaks, several\r\nmutters, and a collapse. They proceeded to put the question.\r\n\r\nThe Peers flocked back again to their places in great numbers; others\r\nstood ready for the Lobbies--but there was no need.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those rare moments when many hundreds of hearts, to quote\r\na wild and lovely poem, beat as one; and with a silent unanimity which\r\neye-witnesses declare to have formed the most impressive sight since\r\nthe first great review of Specials upon Salisbury Plain, the Resolution\r\nwas adopted.\r\n\r\nThus was destroyed, let us hope for ever, what was rapidly growing to\r\nbe a formidable legend and one that would have undermined the security\r\nof the State and the honour of our public life in the eyes of rival\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nIt was not the least of the services which Charles Repton had rendered\r\nto the State, and as we raise our grateful hats to Providence for the\r\nrecovery that made his action possible, let us not forget the genius of\r\nthe Young Canadian Doctor who was the author of that miraculous moment\r\nin a story of a thousand years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Private Members’ time was ended. The House sat on upon the\r\nBroadening of the Streets Bill, the intense unpopularity of which\r\nrendered it especially urgent.\r\n\r\nWhen the House of Commons rose, near midnight, Dolly and Dimmy went\r\nout together by the door of the private rooms into the cool air and\r\nthere in the courtyard were the glowing lamps of Mary’s motor car. She\r\nbeckoned them and they got in.\r\n\r\n“You got to come to supper to-night,” she said mysteriously. “They’ll\r\nall be there.”\r\n\r\nDimmy was agreeable. Dolly tried to plead something but she shut him\r\nup, and after them in single file raced through London half a dozen\r\ntaxis and cars and broughams all making in a stream for St. James’s.\r\n\r\nIt made such a supper-party as Mary Smith alone in London could gather!\r\n\r\nHer sister-in-law, with the Leader of the Opposition, and his\r\nbrother; his right-hand man who had been Chancellor in the last\r\nadministration; his nephew, the Postmaster General; Dolly himself;\r\nDolly’s brother-in-law, the Secretary for India; his little nephew’s\r\nwife’s cousin at the Board of Trade, and his stepmother’s brother at\r\nthe Admiralty, sat down,--and so did Dimmy, who was there without his\r\nwife, and also, I regret to say, without a stud, or rather without the\r\nhead of a stud, in his shirt; for somehow it had broken off.\r\n\r\nBut the reader will have but an imperfect picture of that jolly table\r\nif she imagines that it was a mere family party.\r\n\r\nOur public life is a larger thing than that! Of the five members of the\r\ntwo front benches who were not connected by marriage, two were present:\r\nthe Minister for Education who could draw such screamingly funny things\r\non blotting-paper, and Beagle, back two days before from Berlin, who\r\ncould imitate a motor car with his mouth better than any man in Europe.\r\nAnd there also, by a sort of licence, was the Duke of Battersea,\r\nbrought by Charlie Fitzgerald and his wife.\r\n\r\nThey had already sat down when William Bailey, whom no one had invited,\r\ncame ponderously and good-humouredly in, affected to stare at the Duke,\r\nand made a place for himself as far as possible from that controller\r\nof hemispheres, who was in his usual chair on Mary Smith’s right hand,\r\nwith bulbous baggy eyes for none but her.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey smiled all that evening and smiled especially at\r\nDimmy--but he remained very silent; when, a little before two, they\r\nbegan to make a move, he had not said a dozen words--and Dimmy was\r\nexceedingly grateful.\r\n\r\nNay, his friendship extended further: he saw Demaine as they all got up\r\nfrom table nervously stuffing a corner of the cloth in mistake for his\r\nhandkerchief into his trousers pocket.\r\n\r\n“Look out, Dimmy!” he said.\r\n\r\nDimmy jumped, and the tablecloth jumped with him, and then a crash--a\r\ngreat crash of broken glass, and the falling of candles.\r\n\r\nMary Smith was very nearly annoyed, but on such an occasion she forgave\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNorth of the Park, for now two hours, Lord Repton of Giggleswick had\r\nslept an easy sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE PSEUDOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF CARYLL’S GANGLIA\r\n\r\nA PAMPHLET\r\n\r\n_Which the reader need not read. It is quite as easy to understand the\r\nbook without it._\r\n\r\n  Extract from a lecture delivered, for a grossly insufficient fee, by\r\n    a professor of great popular reputation at the Royal Institution on\r\n    January 26th, 1915:--\r\n\r\n“The _Review of Comparative Biology_ in its October issue contained a\r\nshort and modest paper over the name of Henry Upton which is destined\r\nto influence modern thought more profoundly than anything that has\r\nappeared since _Lux Mundi_ or the _Origin of Species_. Henry Upton has\r\nbeen taken from us. Or, to use a phrase consecrated by his own reverent\r\nquotation of it, he has ‘Passed beyond the Veil,’ he has crossed the\r\nbar; but short as the time is since this brief essay was given to the\r\nworld, his name is already famous.\r\n\r\n“You will have heard the echoes of passionate discussions upon his\r\nfamous theory; it is my business this afternoon to put before you in\r\nclear and popular language that you can easily understand, what that\r\ntheory was; and when I have done so I make no doubt that you will see\r\nwhy it has been thought so transcendently important.\r\n\r\n“Briefly, Henry Upton declared himself finally convinced that between\r\nMan and the Simius Gabiensis there existed a differentiation so marked\r\nas to destroy all possibility of any recent common origin for the two\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n“When I add that Simius Gabiensis is but the technical name for the\r\nRingtailed Baboon of our childhood you will at once appreciate what a\r\nrevolution such a pronouncement must work if it can be sustained: and\r\nit has been sustained!\r\n\r\n“It is common knowledge and will be familiar to the youngest child in\r\nthis room that the Ringtailed Baboon is the highest of the Anthropoids,\r\nand the one nearest approaching the majesty of the Human Species--Homo\r\nSapiens; and if between him and ourselves the link of affinity prove\r\nfar removed, it seems indeed as though the whole edifice of modern\r\nbiology and of modern thought itself will fall to the ground.\r\n\r\n“The superficial differences to be discovered between a cleanly and\r\nwell-bred gentleman and the Ringtailed Baboon are common property: the\r\nbeard in the Anthropoid is not so clearly defined as in the allied\r\norganism of Man, but covers the whole face; the superciliary arch\r\nis more prominent, the diaphragm tessarated and refulgent, while the\r\nCardiac Aneries are at once paler and less vasculate in form: the\r\nrings upon the tail are of course peculiar to the Simian, and almost\r\nuniversally absent in the human species, while the speech of the latter\r\nis far more complex and articulate than that of the former.\r\n\r\n“But I need not detain this cultured audience with considerations\r\nquite unworthy of physical science. All the weight of real evidence\r\npointed to the close relationship between the two types, and it was a\r\ncommonplace of the classroom that in all fundamentals the two animals\r\nbetrayed an ancestor less remote than that of the dog and the wolf.\r\nNow, since Henry Upton’s work appeared, we are certain that that\r\nancestor is more remote than the ancestor of the hippopotamus and the\r\nJersey cow, and probably more remote than that of the mongoose and the\r\nGreat Auk.\r\n\r\n“In every text-book we read (and we believed the statement) that\r\nbetween a really poor man and the highest specimens of our race lay a\r\ngulf wider than that which separated the former from the Ringtailed\r\nBaboon and even from the Gorilla and the Barbary Ape. To-day all that\r\nis gone!\r\n\r\n“Now let me turn to the evidence. Briefly, again, Henry Upton proved\r\nthat CARYLL’S GANGLIA were not, as had been imagined, unimportant or\r\nuseless organs, but were organically necessary to the full conduct of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n“It had of course been known since Caryll first described and mapped\r\nthese ganglia, that they were present in Man and absent in all other\r\nanimals. But they were not unique in this, and the obscure part which\r\nthey seemed to play in our economy attracted little attention from\r\nthe student. Suddenly these humble agglutinations of organic matter\r\nwere lifted into the blaze of fame by an Englishman whose name will\r\nnot perish so long as our civilisation endures. For Henry Upton showed\r\nthat in these ganglia lay the capital distinction between man and his\r\ncongener; if I, myself, for instance, differ in any way from ‘Pongo’ in\r\nRegent’s Park, it is to Caryll’s Ganglia, under Providence, that I owe\r\nthe privilege.\r\n\r\n“Henry Upton was not the man to proceed upon _a priori_ reasoning,\r\nor to state as a conclusion what was still a bare hypothesis. He had\r\nsuspected the truth ten years before committing it to print: they were\r\nten years of anxiety, nay, of agony, during which a bolder or less\r\nscrupulous man might snatch from him the merit of prior discovery; but\r\nhe felt it was his duty to Science to continue the vast labour and the\r\npatient research, until he could speak once and for all.\r\n\r\n“Upton tabulated in all the enormous number of 57,752 recorded\r\nexperiments. He first noted the comparative sizes of the ganglia, in\r\nchildren and adults, in women and in men, showing them to be larger\r\nin men than in women, and in children rudimentary before the seventh\r\nyear. He next proved that in certain professions, notably in those of\r\nthe money-lender, the solicitor and the politician, hypertrophy of the\r\nganglia was to be discovered. The conclusions to which this pointed\r\nwill soon be evident. His theory already began to take shape. Luckily\r\nfor English science, this great man was possessed of private means. He\r\norganised a staff of enthusiastic young workers who occupied themselves\r\nin treading upon the toes of people in omnibuses, sitting upon top\r\nhats, asking direct questions of slight acquaintances concerning their\r\nfinancial affairs, and coughing violently and with long, uninterrupted\r\nspasms at the most exciting moments of melodramatic plays. The result\r\nwas in each case tabulated, and in over 5·08 per cent. of the cases it\r\nwas possible with care to discover the position of the ganglia in those\r\nwho responded to the stimuli. Without a single exception the importance\r\nof the ganglia varied directly with the self-restraint exercised\r\nagainst such stimuli. Those who struck out, swore, or in any other way\r\nbetrayed immediate violence, were found to possess small and sometimes\r\npartially atrophied C. G’s. Those who protested sullenly or confined\r\nthemselves to angry glances were normal; those who contained themselves\r\nas though nothing had happened, invariably possessed ganglia of a\r\nlarge and peculiarly healthy type, while those who actually expressed\r\nenjoyment and begged for a repetition of the performance had ganglia of\r\nso astonishing a size as to cause protuberances on either side of the\r\nhead, for Caryll’s Ganglia lie (as most of you probably know) a little\r\nsouth-east and by east of the Aural Cavity.\r\n\r\n“It might by this time have seemed sufficiently proved that Caryll’s\r\nGanglia were the seat of all that restraint and balance upon\r\nwhich human society depends; but Upton was not satisfied until he\r\nhad clinched the process of proof by a negative experiment upon\r\nanimals:--And here let me point out in passing that had certain\r\nwell-meaning fanatics their own way, this great revelation would never\r\nhave been made. The horse, the pig, the common house-fly, the bee, the\r\ndog and the wild goose, to give but a few examples, were severally\r\ntested, and in each case it was discovered that a clout, a fillip, or\r\nany other simple stimulus was at once responded to. In no case was a\r\ntrace of Caryll’s Ganglia to be found.\r\n\r\n“You all know the end!\r\n\r\n“The essay was printed, Upton’s name had already flown to the utmost\r\ncorners of the globe, when he read in some obscure narrative of travel\r\nthat the little armadillo that can sleep without a pillow, though\r\npossessing no ganglia, was capable of the same balance and restraint\r\nas man, could control himself under all but the most violent stimuli,\r\nconceal his most poignant necessities, and smile in the presence of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n“Upton was a Scientist of the Scientists. One single exception and he\r\nwould retract from his position. He sailed for the Amazon, interviewed\r\nthe armadillo, but at the first pin he thrust into the fleshy portion\r\nof the animal’s steaks, a little below the armoured belt, it belied the\r\nfalse report by turning savagely round and biting off his head. His\r\nremains were reverently brought home to London. He lies in Westminster\r\nAbbey, the last and perhaps the greatest of martyrs to scientific\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n“If Henry Upton’s immortal achievement seems for a moment to have\r\nbroken down the very keystone in the arch of social progress, and to\r\nhave made null the whole structure of biological truth; if it leaves\r\nMan no longer propped up by a knowledge of cousinship and brotherhood\r\nwith the beasts of the field, but all alone, an exile upon earth,\r\nnevertheless we must take courage. The Bishop of Shoreham has told us\r\n(Etc., etc., etc.).”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Printed by_\r\n  MORRISON & GIBB LIMITED\r\n  _Edinburgh_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Dollars, not pounds.\r\n\r\n[2] He did.\r\n\r\n[3] [Greek:           ... mega sthenos Ôkeanoio\r\n            Antyga par pymatên sakeos pyka poiêtoio.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] I refer to Mr. Bulge, and I refer to him both as an actor and as an\r\nauthor.
