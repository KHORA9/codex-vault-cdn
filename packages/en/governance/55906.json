(1)\r\n\r\n(_Edinburgh Review_, October 1844.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMore {1}than ten years ago we commenced a sketch of the political life\r\nof the great Lord Chatham. We then stopped at the death of George the\r\nSecond, with the intention of speedily resuming our task. Circumstances,\r\nwhich it would be tedious to explain, long prevented us from carrying\r\nthis intention into effect. Nor can we regret the delay. For the\r\nmaterials which were within our reach in 1834 were scanty and\r\nunsatisfactory, when compared with those which we at present possess.\r\nEven now, though we have had access to some valuable sources of\r\ninformation which have not yet been opened to the public, we cannot but\r\nfeel that the history of the first ten years of the reign of George the\r\nThird is but imperfectly known to us. Nevertheless, we are inclined to\r\nthink that we are in a condition to lay before our readers a narrative\r\nneither uninstructive nor uninteresting. We therefore return with\r\npleasure to our long interrupted labour.\r\n\r\nWe left Pitt in the zenith of prosperity and glory,\r\n\r\n     (1)  1._Correspondence of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham_. 4\r\n     vols. 8vo.

London: 1843-4.\r\n\r\n{2}the idol of England, the terror of France, the admiration of the\r\nwhole civilised world. The wind, from whatever quarter it blew, carried\r\nto England tidings of battles won, fortresses taken, provinces added\r\nto the empire. At home, factions had sunk into a lethargy, such as\r\nhad never been known since the great religious schism of the sixteenth\r\ncentury had roused the public mind from repose.\r\n\r\nIn order that the events which we have to relate may be clearly\r\nunderstood, it may be desirable that we should advert to the causes\r\nwhich had for a time suspended the animation of both the great English\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nIf, rejecting all that is merely accidental, we look at the essential\r\ncharacteristics of the Whig and the Tory, we may consider each of them\r\nas the representative of a great principle, essential to the welfare of\r\nnations. One is, in an especial manner, the guardian of liberty, and the\r\nother, of order. One is the moving power, and the other the steadying\r\npower of the state. One is the sail, without which society would make\r\nno progress, the other the ballast, without which there would be small\r\nsafety in a tempest. But, during the forty-six years which followed\r\nthe accession of the House of Hanover, these distinctive peculiarities\r\nseemed to be effaced. The Whig conceived that he could not better serve\r\nthe cause of civil and religious freedom than by strenuously supporting\r\nthe Protestant dynasty. The Tory conceived that he could not better\r\nprove his hatred of revolutions than by attacking a government to\r\nwhich a revolution had given birth. Both came by degrees to attach more\r\nimportance to the means than to the end. Both were thrown into unnatural\r\nsituations; and both, like animals transported to an uncongenial\r\n{3}climate, languished and degenerated. The Tory, removed from the\r\nsunshine of the court, was as a camel in the snows of Lapland. The Whig,\r\nbasking in the rays of royal favour, was as a reindeer in the sands of\r\nArabia.\r\n\r\nDante tells us that he saw, in Maleholge, a strange encounter between\r\na human form and a serpent. The enemies, after cruel wounds inflicted,\r\nstood for a time glaring on each other. A great cloud surrounded them,\r\nand then a wonderful metamorphosis began. Each creature was transfigured\r\ninto the likeness of its antagonist. The serpent’s tail divided itself\r\ninto two legs; the man’s legs intertwined themselves into a tail. The\r\nbody of the serpent put forth arms; the arms of the man shrank into his\r\nbody. At length the serpent stood up a man, and spake; the man sank\r\ndown a serpent, and glided hissing away. Something like this was the\r\ntransformation which, during the reign of George the First, befell the\r\ntwo English parties. Each gradually took the shape and colour of its\r\nfoe, till at length the Tory rose up erect the zealot of freedom, and\r\nthe Whig crawled and licked the dust at the feet of power.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, when these degenerate politicians discussed questions\r\nmerely speculative, and, above all, when they discussed questions\r\nrelating to the conduct of their own grandfathers, they still seemed to\r\ndiffer as their grandfathers had differed. The Whig, who, during three\r\nParliaments, had never given one vote against the court, and who was\r\nready to sell his soul for the Comptroller’s staff or for the Great\r\nWardrobe, still professed to draw his political doctrines from Locke and\r\nMilton, still worshipped the memory of Pym and Hampden, and would still,\r\non the thirtieth of January, {4}take his class, first to the man in the\r\nmask, and then to the man who would do it without a mask. The Tory, on\r\nthe other hand, while he reviled the mild and temperate Walpole as a\r\ndeadly enemy of liberty, could see nothing to reprobate in the iron\r\ntyranny of Strafford and Land. But, whatever judgment the Whig or the\r\nTory of that age might pronounce on transactions long past, there can\r\nbe no doubt that, as respected the practical questions then pending, the\r\nTory was a reformer, and indeed an intemperate and indiscreet reformer,\r\nwhile the Whig; was conservative even to bigotry. We have ourselves,\r\nseen similar effects produced in a neighbouring country by similar\r\ncauses. Who would have believed, fifteen years ago, that M. Guizot and\r\nM. Villemain would have to defend property and social order against the\r\nattacks of such enemies as M. Genoude and M. de La Roche Jaquelin?\r\n\r\nThus the successors of the old Cavaliers had turned demagogues; the\r\nsuccessors of the old Roundheads had turned courtiers. Yet was it long\r\nbefore their mutual animosity began to abate; for it is the nature of\r\nparties to retain their original enmities far more firmly than their\r\noriginal principles. During many years, a generation of Whigs, whom\r\nSidney would have spurned as slaves, continued to wage deadly war with a\r\ngeneration of Tories whom Jeffreys would have hanged for Republicans.\r\n\r\nThrough the whole reign of George the First, and through nearly half of\r\nthe reign of George the Second, a Tory was regarded as an enemy of the\r\nreigning house, and was excluded from all the favours of the crown.\r\nThough most of the country gentlemen were Tories, none but Whigs were\r\ncreated peers and baronets. {5}Though most of the clergy were Tories,\r\nnone but Whigs were appointed deans and bishops. In every county,\r\nopulent and well descended Tory squires complained that their names were\r\nleft out of the commission of the peace, while men of small estate and\r\nmean birth, who were for toleration and excise, septennial parliaments\r\nand standing armies, presided at quarter sessions, and became deputy\r\nlieutenants.\r\n\r\nBy degrees some approaches were made towards a reconciliation. While\r\nWalpole was at the head of affairs, enmity to his power induced a large\r\nand powerful body of Whigs, headed by the heir apparent of the\r\nthrone, to make an alliance with the Tories, and a truce even with the\r\nJacobites. After Sir Robert’s fall, the ban which lay on the Tory party\r\nwas taken off. The chief places in the administration continued to be\r\nfilled by Whigs, and, indeed, could scarcely have been filled otherwise;\r\nfor the Tory nobility and gentry, though strong in numbers and in\r\nproperty, had among them scarcely a single man distinguished by talents,\r\neither for business or for debate. A few of them, however, were admitted\r\nto subordinate offices; and this indulgence produced a softening effect\r\non the temper of the whole body. The first levee of George the Second\r\nafter Walpole’s resignation was a remarkable spectacle. Mingled with the\r\nconstant supporters of the House of Brunswick, with the Russells, the\r\nCavendishes, and the Pelhams, appeared a crowd of faces utterly unknown\r\nto the pages and gentlemen ushers, lords of rural manors, whose ale and\r\nfox-hounds were renowned in the neighbourhood of the Mendip hills, or\r\nround the Wrekin, but who had never crossed the threshold of the palace\r\nsince the days when Oxford, with the white staff in his hand, stood\r\nbehind Queen Anne. {6}During the eighteen years which followed this\r\nclay, both factions were gradually sinking deeper and deeper into\r\nrepose. The apathy of the public mind is partly to be ascribed to\r\nthe unjust violence with which the administration of Walpole had been\r\nassailed. In the body politic, as in the natural body, morbid languor\r\ngenerally succeeds morbid excitement. The people had been maddened\r\nby sophistry, by calumny, by rhetoric, by stimulants applied to the\r\nnational pride. In the fulness of bread, they had raved as if famine had\r\nbeen in the land. While enjoying such a measure of civil and religious\r\nfreedom as, till then, no great society had ever known, they had cried\r\nout for a Timoleon or a Brutus to stab their oppressor to the heart.\r\nThey were in this frame of mind when the change of administration took\r\nplace; and they soon found that there was to be no change whatever in\r\nthe system of government. The natural consequences followed. To frantic\r\nzeal succeeded sullen indifference. The cant of patriotism had not\r\nmerely ceased to charm the public ear, but had become as nauseous as the\r\ncant of Puritanism after the downfall of the Rump. The hot fit was over:\r\nthe cold fit had begun: and it was long before seditious arts, or even\r\nreal grievances, could bring back the fiery paroxysm which had run its\r\ncourse and reached its termination.\r\n\r\nTwo attempts were made to disturb this tranquillity. The banished heir\r\nof the House of Stewart headed a rebellion; the discontented heir of\r\nthe House of Brunswick headed an opposition. Both the rebellion and\r\nthe opposition came to nothing. The battle of Culloden annihilated\r\nthe Jacobite party. The death of Prince Frederic dissolved the faction\r\nwhich, under his guidance, had feebly striven to annoy his father’s\r\ngovernment. {7}His chief followers hastened to make their peace with the\r\nministry; and the political torpor became complete.\r\n\r\nFive years after the death of Prince Frederic, the public mind was for\r\na time violently excited. But this excitement had nothing to do with the\r\nold disputes between Whigs and Tories. England was at war with France.\r\nThe war had been feebly conducted. Minorca had been torn from us. Our\r\nfleet had retired before the white flag of the House of Bourbon. A\r\nbitter sense of humiliation, new to the proudest and bravest of nations,\r\nsuperseded every other feeling. The cry of all the counties and great\r\ntowns of the realm was for a government which would retrieve the honour\r\nof the English arms. The two most powerful men in the country were the\r\nDuke of Newcastle and Pitt. Alternate victories and defeats had made\r\nthem sensible that neither of them could stand alone. The interest of\r\nthe state, and the interest of their own ambition, impelled them to\r\ncoalesce. By their coalition was formed the ministry which was in power\r\nwhen George the Third ascended the throne.\r\n\r\nThe more carefully the structure of this celebrated ministry is\r\nexamined, the more shall we see reason to marvel at the skill or the\r\nluck which had combined in one harmonious whole such various and, as it\r\nseemed, incompatible elements of force. The influence which is derived\r\nfrom stainless integrity, the influence which is derived from the vilest\r\narts of corruption, the strength of aristocratical connection, the\r\nstrength of democratical enthusiasm, all these things were for the\r\nfirst time found together. Newcastle brought to the coalition a vast\r\nmass of power, which had descended to him from Walpole and Pelham. The\r\npublic offices, the church, {8}the courts of law, the army, the navy,\r\nthe diplomatic service, swarmed with his creatures. The boroughs,\r\nwhich long afterwards made up the memorable schedules A and B, were\r\nrepresented by his nominees. The great Whig families, which, during\r\nseveral generations, had been trained in the discipline of party\r\nwarfare, and were accustomed to stand together in a firm phalanx,\r\nacknowledged him as their captain. Pitt, on the other hand, had what\r\nNewcastle wanted, an eloquence which stirred the passions and charmed\r\nthe imagination, a high reputation for purity, and the confidence and\r\nardent love of millions.\r\n\r\nThe partition which the two ministers made of the powers of government\r\nwas singularly happy. Each occupied a province for which he was well\r\nqualified; and neither had any inclination to intrude himself into\r\nthe province of the other. Newcastle took the treasury, the civil and\r\necclesiastical patronage, and the disposal of that part of the secret\r\nservice money which was then employed in bribing members of Parliament.\r\nPitt was Secretary of State, with the direction of the war and of\r\nforeign affairs. Thus the filth of all the noisome and pestilential\r\nsewers of government was poured into one channel. Through the other\r\npassed only what was bright and stainless. Mean and selfish politicians,\r\npining for commissionerships, gold sticks, and ribands, flocked to\r\nthe great house at the corner of Lincoln’s Inn Fields. There, at every\r\nlevee, appeared eighteen or twenty pair of lawn sleeves; for there was\r\nnot, it was said, a single Prelate who had not owed either his first\r\nelevation or some subsequent translation to Newcastle. There appeared\r\nthose members of the House of Commons in whose silent votes the main\r\nstrength of the government lay. One wanted a {9}place in the excise for\r\nhis butler. Another came about a prebend for his son. A third whispered\r\nthat he had always stood by his Grace and the Protestant succession;\r\nthat his last election had been very expensive; that potwallopers had\r\nnow no conscience; that he had been forced to take up money on mortgage;\r\nand that he hardly knew where to turn for five hundred pounds. The Duke\r\npressed all their hands, passed his arms round all their shoulders,\r\npatted all their backs, and sent away some with wages, and some with\r\npromises. From this traffic Pitt stood haughtily aloof. Not only was\r\nhe himself incorruptible, but he shrank from the loathsome drudgery of\r\ncorrupting others. He had not, however, been twenty years in Parliament,\r\nand ten in office, without discovering how the government was carried\r\non. He was perfectly aware that bribery was practised on a large scale\r\nby his colleagues. Hating the practice, yet despairing of putting it\r\ndown, and doubting whether, in those times, any ministry could stand\r\nwithout it, he determined to be blind to it. He would see nothing, know\r\nnothing, believe nothing. People who came to talk to him about shares\r\nin lucrative contracts, or about the means of securing a Cornish\r\ncorporation, were soon put out of countenance by his arrogant humility.\r\nThey did him too much honour. Such matters were beyond his capacity.\r\nIt was true that his poor advice about expeditions and treaties was\r\nlistened to with indulgence by a gracious sovereign. If the question\r\nwere, who should command in North America, or who should be ambassador\r\nat Berlin, his colleagues would probably condescend to take his\r\nopinion. But he had not the smallest influence with the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and could not venture to ask even for a tidewaiter’s place.\r\n{10}It may be doubted whether he did not owe as much of his popularity\r\nto his ostentatious purity as to his eloquence, or to his talents for\r\nthe administration of war. It was every where said with delight and\r\nadmiration that the great Commoner, without any advantages of birth\r\nor fortune, had, in spite of the dislike of the Court and of the\r\naristocracy, made himself the first, man in England, and made England\r\nthe first country in the world; that his name was mentioned with awe in\r\nevery palace from Lisbon to Moscow; that his trophies were in all the\r\nfour quarters of the globe; yet that he was still plain William Pitt,\r\nwithout title or riband, without pension or sinecure place. Whenever he\r\nshould retire, after saving the state, he must sell his coach horses and\r\nhis silver candlesticks. Widely as the taint of corruption had spread,\r\nhis hands were clean. They had never received, they had never given, the\r\nprice of infamy. Thus the coalition gathered to itself support from all\r\nthe high and all the low parts of human nature, and was strong with the\r\nwhole united strength of virtue and of Mammon.\r\n\r\nPitt and Newcastle were co-ordinate chief ministers. The subordinate\r\nplaces had been filled on the principle of including in the government\r\nevery party and shade of party, the avowed Jacobites alone excepted,\r\nnay, every public man who, from his abilities or from his situation,\r\nseemed likely to be either useful in office or formidable in opposition.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs, according to what was then considered as their prescriptive\r\nright, held by far the largest share of power. The main support of\r\nthe administration was what may be called the great Whig connection, a\r\nconnection which, during near half a century, had {11}generally had the\r\nchief sway in the country, and which derived an immense authority from\r\nrank, wealth, borough interest, and firm union. To this connection, of\r\nwhich Newcastle was the head, belonged the houses of Cavendish, Lennox,\r\nFitzroy, Bentinck, Manners, Conway, Wentworth, and many others of high\r\nnote.\r\n\r\nThere were two other powerful Whig connections, either of which might\r\nhave been a nucleus for a strong opposition. But room had been found\r\nin the government for both. They were known as the Grenvilles and the\r\nBedfords.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Grenvilles was Richard Earl Temple. His talents\r\nfor administration and debate were of no high order. But his great\r\npossessions, his turbulent and unscrupulous character, his restless\r\nactivity, and his skill in the most ignoble tactics of faction, made him\r\none of the most formidable enemies that a ministry could have. He was\r\nkeeper of the privy seal. His brother George was treasurer of the navy.\r\nThey were supposed to be on terms of close friendship with Pitt, who had\r\nmarried their sister, and was the most uxorious of husbands.\r\n\r\nThe Bedfords, or, as they were called by their enemies, the Bloomsbury\r\ngang, professed to be led by John Duke of Bedford, but in truth led him\r\nwherever they chose, and very often led him where he never would have\r\ngone of his own accord. He had many good qualities of head and\r\nheart, and would have been certainly a respectable, and possibly a\r\ndistinguished man, if he had been less under the influence of his\r\nfriends, or more fortunate in choosing them. Some of them were indeed,\r\nto do them justice, men of parts. But here, we are afraid, eulogy\r\nmust end. {12}Sandwich and Rigby were able debaters, pleasant boon\r\ncompanions, dexterous intriguers, masters of all the arts of jobbing\r\nand electioneering, and both in public and private life, shamelessly\r\nimmoral. Weymouth had a natural eloquence, which sometimes astonished\r\nthose who knew how little he owed to study. But he was indolent and\r\ndissolute, and had early impaired a fine estate with the dice box, and a\r\nfine constitution with the bottle. The wealth and power of the Duke, and\r\nthe talents and audacity of some of his retainers, might have seriously\r\nannoyed the strongest ministry. But his assistance had been secured. He\r\nwas Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; Rigby was his secretary; and the whole\r\nparty dutifully supported the measures of the Government.\r\n\r\nTwo men had, a short time before, been thought likely to contest with\r\nPitt the lead of the House of Commons, William Murray and Henry Fox. But\r\nMurray had been removed to the Lords, and was Chief Justice of the Kings\r\nBench. Fox was indeed still in the Commons: but means had been\r\nfound to secure, if not his strenuous support, at least his silent\r\nacquiescence. He was a poor man; he was a doting father. The office of\r\nPaymaster-General durum an expensive war was, in that age, perhaps the\r\nmost lucrative situation in the gift of the government. This office was\r\nbestowed on Fox. The prospect of making a noble fortune in a few years,\r\nand of providing amply for his darling boy Charles, was irresistibly\r\ntempting. To hold a subordinate place, however profitable, after having\r\nled the House of Commons, and having been intrusted with the business of\r\nforming a ministry, was indeed a great descent. But a punctilious sense\r\nof personal dignity was no part of the character of Henry Fox. {13}We\r\nhave not time to enumerate all the other men of weight who were, by\r\nsome tie or other, attached to the government. We may mention Hardwicke,\r\nreputed the first lawyer of the age; Legge, reputed the first financier\r\nof the age; the acute and ready Oswald; the bold and humorous Nugent;\r\nCharles Townshend, the most brilliant and versatile of mankind; Elliot,\r\nBarrington, North, Pratt. Indeed, as far as we recollect, there were in\r\nthe whole House of Commons only two men of distinguished abilities who\r\nwere not connected with the government; and those two men stood so\r\nlow in public estimation, that the only service which they could have\r\nrendered to any government would have been to oppose it. We speak of\r\nLord George Sackville and Bubb Dodington.\r\n\r\nThough most of the official men, and all the members of the cabinet,\r\nwere reputed Whigs, the Tories were by no means excluded from\r\nemployment. Pitt had gratified many of them with commands in the\r\nmilitia, which increased both their income and their importance in their\r\nown counties; and they were therefore in better humour than at any time\r\nsince the death of Anne. Some of the party still continued to grumble\r\nover their punch at the Cocoa Tree; but in the House of Commons not a\r\nsingle one of the malecontents durst lift his eyes above the buckle of\r\nPitt’s shoe.\r\n\r\nThus there was absolutely no opposition. Nay, there was no sign from\r\nwhich it could be guessed in what quarter opposition was likely to\r\narise. Several years passed during which Parliament seemed to have\r\nabdicated its chief functions. The Journals of the House of Commons,\r\nduring four sessions, contain no trace of a division on a party\r\nquestion. The supplies, {14}though beyond precedent great, were voted\r\nwithout discussion. The most animated debates of that period were on\r\nroad bills and inclosure bills.\r\n\r\nThe old King was content; and it mattered little whether he were content\r\nor not. It would have been impossible for him to emancipate himself from\r\na ministry so powerful, even if he had been inclined to do so. But he\r\nhad no such inclination. He had once, indeed, been strongly prejudiced\r\nagainst Pitt, and had repeatedly been ill used by Newcastle; but the\r\nvigour and success with which the war had been waged in Germany, and the\r\nsmoothness with which all public business was carried on, had produced a\r\nfavourable change in the royal mind.\r\n\r\nSuch was the posture of affairs when, on the twenty-fifth of October,\r\n1760, George the Second suddenly died, and George the Third, then\r\ntwenty-two years old, became King. The situation of George the\r\nThird differed widely from that of his grandfather and that of his\r\ngreatgrandfather. Many years had elapsed since a sovereign of England\r\nhad been an object of affection to any part of his people. The first two\r\nKings of the House of Hanover had neither those hereditary rights which\r\nhave often supplied the defect of merit, nor those personal qualities\r\nwhich have often supplied the defect of title. A prince may be popular\r\nwith little virtue or capacity, if he reigns by birthright derived from\r\na long line of illustrious predecessors. An usurper may be popular, if\r\nhis genius has saved or aggrandised the nation which he governs. Perhaps\r\nno rulers have in our time had a stronger hold on the affection of\r\nsubjects than the Emperor Francis, and his son-inlaw the Emperor\r\nNapoleon. But imagine a ruler with no better title than Napoleon, and\r\nno better understanding {15}than Francis. Richard Cromwell was such a\r\nruler; and, as soon as an arm was lifted up against him, he fell without\r\na struggle, amidst universal derision. George the First and George\r\nthe Second were in a situation which bore some resemblance to that of\r\nRichard Cromwell. They were saved from the fate of Richard Cromwell by\r\nthe strenuous and able exertions of the Whig party, and by the general\r\nconviction that the nation had no choice but between the House of\r\nBrunswick and popery. But by no class were the Guelphs regarded with\r\nthat devoted affection, of which Charles the First, Charles the Second,\r\nand James the Second, in spite of the greatest faults, and in the midst\r\nof the greatest misfortunes, received innumerable proofs. Those Whigs\r\nwho stood by the new dynasty so manfully with purse and sword did so\r\non principles independent of, and indeed almost incompatible with, the\r\nsentiment of devoted loyalty. The moderate Tories regarded the foreign\r\ndynasty as a great evil, which must be endured for fear of a greater\r\nevil. In the eyes of the high Tories, the Elector was the most hateful\r\nof robbers and tyrants. The crown of another was on his head; the blood\r\nof the brave and loyal was on his hands. Thus, during many years, the\r\nKings of England were objects of strong personal aversion to many of\r\ntheir subjects, and of strong personal attachment to none. They found,\r\nindeed, firm and cordial support against the pretender to their throne;\r\nbut this support was given, not at all for their sake, but for the sake\r\nof a religious and political system which would have been endangered\r\nby their fall. This support, too, they were compelled to purchase by\r\nperpetually sacrificing their private inclinations to the party which\r\nhad set them on the throne, and which maintained them there. {16}At the\r\nclose of the reign of George the Second, the feeling of aversion with\r\nwhich the House of Brunswick had long been regarded by half the nation\r\nhad died away: but no feeling of affection to that house had yet sprung\r\nup. There was little, indeed, in the old King’s character to inspire\r\nesteem or tenderness. He was not our countryman. He never set foot on\r\nour soil till he was more than thirty years old. His speech betrayed\r\nhis foreign origin and breeding. His love for his native land, though\r\nthe most amiable part of his character, was not likely to endear him to\r\nhis British subjects. He was never so happy as when he could exchange\r\nSt. James’s for Hernhansen. Year after year, our fleets were employed\r\nto convoy him to the Continent, and the interests of his kingdom were as\r\nnothing to him when compared with the interests of his Electorate. As to\r\nthe rest, he had neither the qualities which make dulness respectable,\r\nnor the qualities which make libertinism attractive. He had been a bad\r\nson and a worse father, an unfaithful husband and an ungraceful lover.\r\nNot one magnanimous or humane action is recorded of him; but many\r\ninstances of meanness, and of a harshness which, but for the strong\r\nconstitutional restraints under which he was placed, might have made the\r\nmisery of his people.\r\n\r\nHe died; and at once a new world opened. The young King was a born\r\nEnglishman. All his tastes and habits, good or bad, were English. No\r\nportion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with. Even the\r\nremaining adherents of the House of Stuart could scarcely impute to him\r\nthe guilt of usurpation. He was not responsible for the Revolution, for\r\nthe Act of Settlement, for the suppression of the risings of 1715 and of\r\n1745. He was innocent of the blood {17}of Derwentwater and Kilmarnock,\r\nof Balmerino and Cameron. Born fifty years after the old line had been\r\nexpelled, fourth in descent and third in succession of the Hanoverian\r\ndynasty, he might plead some show of hereditary right. His age, his\r\nappearance, and all that was known of his character, conciliated public\r\nfavour. He was in the bloom of youth; his person and address were\r\npleasing. Scandal imputed to him no vice; and flattery might, without\r\nany glaring absurdity, ascribe to him many princely virtues.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange, therefore, that the sentiment of loyalty, a sentiment\r\nwhich had lately seemed to be as much out of date as the belief in\r\nwitches or the practice of pilgrimage, should, from the day of his\r\naccession, have begun to revive. The Tories in particular, who had\r\nalways been inclined to Kingworship, and who had long felt with pain\r\nthe want of an idol before whom they could bow themselves down, were\r\nas joyful as the priests of Apis, when, after a long interval, they had\r\nfound a new calf to adore. It was soon clear that George the Third was\r\nregarded by a portion of the nation with a very different feeling from\r\nthat which his two predecessors had inspired. They had been merely\r\nFirst Magistrates, Doges, Stadtholders; he was emphatically a King, the\r\nanointed of heaven, the breath of his people’s nostrils. The years of\r\nthe widowhood and mourning of the Tory party were over. Dido had kept\r\nfaith long enough to the cold ashes of a former lord; she had at last\r\nfound a comforter, and recognised the vestigus of the old flame. The\r\ngolden days of Harley would return. The Somersets, the Lees, and the\r\nWyndhams would again surround the throne. The latitudinarian Prelates,\r\nwho had not been ashamed to correspond with Doddridge and to {18}shake\r\nhands with Winston, would he succeeded by divines of the temper of South\r\nand Atterbury. The devotion which had been so signally shown to the\r\nHouse of Stuart, which had been proof against defeats, confiscations,\r\nand proscriptions, which perfidy, oppression, ingratitude, could not\r\nweary out, was now transferred entire to the House of Brunswick. If\r\nGeorge the Third would but accept the homage of the Cavaliers and High\r\nChurchmen, he should be to them all that Charles the First and Charles\r\nthe Second had been.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, whose accession was thus hailed by a great party long\r\nestranged from his house, had received from nature a strong will, a\r\nfirmness of temper to which a harsher name might perhaps be given, and\r\nan understanding not, indeed, acute or enlarged, but such as qualified\r\nhim to be a good man of business. But his character had not yet fully\r\ndeveloped itself. He had been brought up in strict seclusion. The\r\ndetractors of the Princess Dowager of Wales affirmed that she had kept\r\nher children from commerce with society, in order that she might hold an\r\nundivided empire over their minds. She gave a very different explanation\r\nof her conduct. She would gladly, she said, see her sons and daughters\r\nmix in the world, if they could do so without risk to their morals. But\r\nthe profligacy of the people of quality alarmed her. The young men were\r\nall rakes; the young women made love, instead of waiting till it was\r\nmade to them. She could not bear to expose those whom she loved best to\r\nthe contaminating influence of such society. The moral advantages of\r\nthe system of education which formed the Duke of York, the Duke of\r\nCumberland, and the Queen of Denmark, may perhaps be questioned. George\r\nthe Third was indeed no libertine; but he brought to the {19}throne\r\na mind only half opened, and was for some time entirely under the\r\ninfluence of his mother and of his Groom of the Stole, John Stuart, Earl\r\nof Bute.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Bute was scarcely known even by name, to the country which\r\nhe was soon to govern. He had indeed, a short time after he came of age,\r\nbeen chosen to fill a vacancy, which, in the middle of a parliament, had\r\ntaken place among the Scotch representative peers. He had disobliged\r\nthe Whig ministers by giving some silent votes with the Tories, had\r\nconsequently lost his seat at the next dissolution, and had never been\r\nreelected. Near twenty years had elapsed since he had borne any part in\r\npolitics. He had passed some of those years at his seat, in one of\r\nthe Hebrides, and from that retirement he had emerged as one of the\r\nhousehold of Prince Frederick. Lord Bute, excluded from public life, had\r\nfound out many ways of amusing his leisure. He was a tolerable actor\r\nin private theatricals, and was particularly successful in the part of\r\nLothario. A handsome leg, to which both painters and satirists took care\r\nto give prominence, was among his chief qualifications for the stage.\r\nHe devised quaint dresses for masquerades. He dabbled in geometry,\r\nmechanics, and botany. He paid some attention to antiquities and works\r\nof art, and was considered in his own circle as a judge of painting,\r\narchitecture, and poetry. It is said that his spelling was incorrect.\r\nBut though, in our time, incorrect spelling is justly considered as a\r\nproof of sordid ignorance, it would be unjust to apply the same rule to\r\npeople who lived a century ago. The novel of Sir Charles Grandison\r\nwas published about the time at which Lord Bute made his appearance\r\nat Leicester House. Our readers may perhaps remember the account\r\nwhich Charlotte {20}Grandison gives of her two lovers. One of them, a\r\nfashionable baronet who talks French and Italian fluently, cannot write\r\na line in his own language without some sin against orthography: the\r\nother, who is represented as a most respectable specimen of the young\r\naristocracy, and something of a virtuoso, is described as spelling\r\npretty well for a lord. On the whole, the Earl of Bute might fairly be\r\ncalled a man of cultivated mind. He was also a man of undoubted honour.\r\nBut his understanding was narrow, and his manners cold and haughty.\r\nHis qualifications for the part of a statesman were best described by\r\nFrederic, who often indulged in the unprincely luxury of sneering at his\r\ndependents. “Bute,” said his Royal Highness, “you are the very man to\r\nbe envoy at some small proud German court where there is nothing to do.”\r\n Scandal represented the Groom of the Stole as the favoured lover of\r\nthe Princess Dowager. He was undoubtedly her confidential friend. The\r\ninfluence which the two united exercised over the mind of the King was\r\nfor a time unbounded. The Princess, a woman and a foreigner, was not\r\nlikely to be a judicious adviser about affairs of state. The Earl\r\ncould scarcely be said to have served even a noviciate in politics. His\r\nnotions of government had been acquired in the society which had been in\r\nthe habit of assembling round Frederic at Kew and Leicester House, That\r\nsociety consisted principally of Tories, who had been reconciled to the\r\nHouse of Hanover by the civility with which the Prince had treated them,\r\nand by the hope of obtaining high preferment when he should come to the\r\nthrone. Their political creed was a peculiar modification of Toryism. It\r\nwas the creed neither of the Tories of the seventeenth nor of the Tories\r\nof {21}the nineteenth century. It was the creed, not of Filmer and\r\nSacheverell, not of Perceval and Eldon, but of the sect of which\r\nBolingbroke may be considered as the chief doctor. This sect deserves\r\ncommendation for having pointed out and justly reprobated some great\r\nabuses which sprang up during the long domination of the Whigs. But\r\nit is far easier to point out and reprobate abuses than to propose\r\nbeneficial reforms: and the reforms which Bolingbroke proposed would\r\neither have been utterly inefficient, or would have produced much more\r\nmischief than they would have removed.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution had saved the nation from one class of evils, but had at\r\nthe same time--such is the imperfection of all things human--engendered\r\nor aggravated another class of evils which required new remedies.\r\nLiberty and property were secure from the attacks of prerogative.\r\nConscience was respected. No government ventured to infringe any of\r\nthe-rights solemnly recognised by the instrument which had called\r\nWilliam and Mary to the throne. But it cannot be denied that, under the\r\nnew system, the public interests and the public morals were seriously\r\nendangered by corruption and faction. During the long struggle against\r\nthe Stuarts, the chief object of the most enlightened statesmen had been\r\nto strengthen the House of Commons. The struggle was over; the victory\r\nwas won; the House of Commons was supreme in the state: and all the\r\nvices which had till then been latent in the representative system were\r\nrapidly developed by prosperity and power. Scarcely had the executive\r\ngovernment become really responsible to the House of Commons, when it\r\nbegan to appear that the House of Commons was not really responsible\r\nto the nation. Many of the constituent bodies were under the absolute\r\ncontrol {22}of individuals; many were notoriously at the command of the\r\nhighest bidder. The debates were not published. It was very seldom known\r\nout of doors how a gentleman had voted. Thus, while the ministry was\r\naccountable to the Parliament, the majority of the Parliament was\r\naccountable to nobody. In such circumstances, nothing could be more\r\nnatural than that the members should insist on being paid for their\r\nvotes, should form themselves into combinations for the purpose of\r\nraising the price of their votes, and should at critical conjunctures\r\nextort large wages by threatening a strike. Thus the Whig ministers\r\nof George the First and George the Second were com-pelled to reduce\r\ncorruption to a system, and to practise it on a gigantic scale.\r\n\r\nIf we are right as to the cause of these abuses, we can scarcely be\r\nwrong as to the remedy. The remedy was surely not to deprive the House\r\nof Commons of its weight in the state. Such a course would undoubtedly\r\nhave put an end to parliamentary corruption and to parliamentary\r\nfactions: for, when votes cease to be of importance, they will cease\r\nto be bought; and, when knaves can get nothing by combining, they will\r\ncease to combine. But to destroy corruption and faction by introducing\r\ndespotism would have been to cure bad by worse. The proper remedy\r\nevidently was, to make the House of Commons responsible to the nation;\r\nand this was to be effected in two ways; first, by giving-publicity to\r\nparliamentary proceedings, and thus placing every member on his trial\r\nbefore the tribunal of public opinion; and secondly, by so reforming the\r\nconstitution of the House that no man should be able to sit in it\r\nwho had not been returned by a respectable and independent body of\r\nconstituents. {23}Bolingbroke and Bolingbroke’s disciples recommended\r\na very different mode of treating the diseases of the state. Their\r\ndoctrine was that a vigorous use of the prerogative by a patriot\r\nKing would at once break all factious combinations, and supersede the\r\npretended necessity of bribing members of Parliament. The King had\r\nonly to resolve that he would be master, that he would not be held in\r\nthraldom by any set of men, that he would take for ministers any persons\r\nin whom he had confidence, without distinction of party, and that he\r\nwould restrain his servants from influencing by immoral means either\r\nthe constituent bodies or the representative body. This childish scheme\r\nproved that those who proposed it knew nothing of the nature of the evil\r\nwith which they pretended to deal. The real cause of the prevalence of\r\ncorruption and fiction was that a House of Commons, not accountable to\r\nthe people, was more powerful than the King. Bolingbroke’s remedy could\r\nbe applied only by a King more powerful than the House of Commons. How\r\nwas the patriot Prince to govern in defiance of the body without whose\r\nconsent he could not equip a sloop, keep a battalion under arms, send\r\nan embassy, or defray even the charges of his own household? Was he to\r\ndissolve the Parliament? And what was he likely to gain by appealing to\r\nSudbury and Old Sarum against the venality of their representatives?\r\nWas he to send out privy seals? Was he to levy ship-money? If so, this\r\nboasted reform must commence in all probability by civil war, and,\r\nif consummated, must be consummated by the establishment of absolute\r\nmonarchy. Or was the patriot King to carry the House of Commons with him\r\nin his upright designs? By what means? Interdicting himself from the\r\nuse of corrupt influence, what motive {24}was he to address to the\r\nDodingtons and Winningtons? Was cupidity, strengthened by habit, to be\r\nlaid asleep by a few fine sentences about virtue and union?\r\n\r\nAbsurd as this theory was, it had many admirers, particularly among men\r\nof letters. It was now to be reduced to practice; and the result was, as\r\nany man of sagacity must have foreseen, the most piteous and ridiculous\r\nof failures.\r\n\r\nOn the very day of the young King’s accession, appeared some signs which\r\nindicated the approach of a great change. The speech which he made to\r\nhis council was not submitted to the cabinet. It was drawn up by Bute,\r\nand contained some expressions which might be construed into reflections\r\non the conduct of affairs during the late reign. Pitt remonstrated,\r\nand begged that these expressions might be softened down in the printed\r\ncopy; but it was not till after some hours of altercation that Bute\r\nyielded; and, even after Bute had yielded, the King affected to hold\r\nout till the following afternoon. On the same day on which this singular\r\ncontest took place, Bute was not only sworn of the privy council, but\r\nintroduced into the cabinet.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, Lord Holdernesse, one of the Secretaries of State, in\r\npursuance of a plan concerted with the court, resigned the seals. Bute\r\nwas instantly appointed to the vacant place. A general election speedily\r\nfollowed, and the new Secretary entered parliament in the only way in\r\nwhich he then could enter it, as one of the sixteen representative peers\r\nof Scotland. (1)\r\n\r\n     (1) In the reign of Anne, the House of Lords had resolved\r\n     that, under the 23d article of Union, no Scotch peer could\r\n     be created a peer of Great Britain. This resolution was not\r\n     annulled till the year 1782.\r\n\r\n{25}Had the ministers been firmly united it can scarcely be doubted\r\nthat they would have been able to withstand the court. The parliamentary\r\ninfluence of the Whig aristocracy, combined with the genius, the virtue,\r\nand the firmness of Pitt, would have been irresistible. But there had been\r\nin the cabinet of George the Second latent jealousies and enmities,\r\nwhich now began to show themselves. Pitt had been estranged from his old\r\nally Legge, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Some of the ministers were\r\nenvious of Pitt’s popularity. Others were, not altogether without cause,\r\ndisgusted by his imperious and haughty demeanour. Others, again, were\r\nhonestly opposed to some parts of his policy. They admitted that he had\r\nfound the country in the depths of humiliation, and had raised it to\r\nthe height of glory: they admitted that he had conducted the war with\r\nenergy, ability, and splendid success; but they began to hint that the\r\ndrain on the resources of the state was unexampled, and that the public\r\ndebt was increasing with a speed at which Montague or Godolphin would\r\nhave stood aghast. Some of the acquisitions made by our fleets and\r\narmies were, it was acknowledged, profitable as well as honourable; but,\r\nnow that George the Second was dead, a courtier might venture to ask why\r\nEngland was to become a party in a dispute between two German powers.\r\nWhat was it to her whether the House of Hapsburg or the House of\r\nBrandenburg ruled in Silesia? Why were the best English regiments\r\nfighting on the Main? Why were the Prussian battalions paid with English\r\ngold? The great minister seemed to think it beneath him to calculate the\r\nprice of victory. As long as the Tower guns were fired, as the streets\r\nwere illuminated, as French banners were carried in triumph through\r\nLondon, it was to him matter of indifference to what extent {26}the\r\npublic burdens were augmented. Nay, he seemed to glory in the magnitude\r\nof those sacrifices which the people, fascinated by his eloquence and\r\nsuccess, had too readily made, and would long and bitterly regret. There\r\nwas no check on waste or embezzlement. Our commissaries returned from\r\nthe camp of Prince Ferdinand to buy boroughs, to rear palaces, to rival\r\nthe magnificence of the old aristocracy of the realm. Already had\r\nwe borrowed, in four years of war, more than the most skilful and\r\neconomical government would pay in forty years of peace. But the\r\nprospect of peace was as remote as ever. It could not be doubted\r\nthat France, smarting and prostrate, would consent to fair terms of\r\naccommodation; but this was not what Pitt wanted. War had made him\r\npowerful and popular; with war, all that was brightest in his life was\r\nassociated: for war his talents were peculiarly fitted. He had at length\r\nbegun to love war for its own sake, and was more disposed to quarrel\r\nwith neutrals than to make peace with enemies.\r\n\r\nSuch were the views of the Duke of Bedford and of the Earl of Hardwicke;\r\nbut no member of the government held these opinions so strongly as\r\nGeorge Grenville, the treasurer of the navy. George Grenville was\r\nbrother-in-law of Pitt, and had always been reckoned one of Pitt’s\r\npersonal and political friends. But it is difficult to conceive two men\r\nof talents and integrity more utterly unlike each other. Pitt, as his\r\nsister often said, knew nothing accurately except Spenser’s Fairy Queen.\r\nHe had never applied himself steadily to any branch of knowledge. He was\r\na wretched financier. He never became familiar even with the rules of\r\nthat House of which he was the brightest ornament. He had never studied\r\npublic law {27}as a system; and was, indeed, so ignorant of the whole\r\nsubject, that George the Second, on one occasion, complained bitterly\r\nthat a man who had never read Vattel should presume to undertake the\r\ndirection of foreign affairs. But these defects were more than redeemed\r\nby high and rare gifts, by a strange power of inspiring great masses\r\nof men with confidence and affection, by an eloquence which not only\r\ndelighted the ear, but stirred the blood, and brought tears into the\r\neyes, by originality in devising plans, by vigour in executing them.\r\nGrenville, on the other hand, was by nature and habit a man of details.\r\nHe had been bred a lawyer; and he had brought the industry and acuteness\r\nof the Temple into official and parliamentary life. He was supposed to\r\nbe intimately acquainted with the whole fiscal system of the country. He\r\nhad paid especial attention to the law of Parliament, and was so learned\r\nin all things relating to the privileges and orders of the House of\r\nCommons that those who loved him least pronounced him the only person\r\ncompetent to succeed Onslow in the Chair. His speeches were generally\r\ninstructive, and sometimes, from the gravity and earnestness with which\r\nhe spoke, even impressive, but never brilliant, and generally tedious.\r\nIndeed, even when he was at the head of affairs, he sometimes found it\r\ndifficult to obtain the ear of the House. In disposition as well as in\r\nintellect, he differed widely from his brother-in-law. Pitt was utterly\r\nregardless of money. He would scarcely stretch out his hand to take it;\r\nand, when it came, he threw it away with childish profusion. Grenville,\r\nthough strictly upright, was grasping and parsimonious. Pitt was a man\r\nof excitable nerves, sanguine in hope, easily elated by success\r\nand popularity, keenly sensible of injury, but prompt to forgive;\r\n{28}Grenville’s character was stern, melancholy, and pertinacious.\r\nNothing was more remarkable in him than his inclination always to look\r\non the dark side of things. He was the raven of the House of Commons,\r\nalways croaking defeat in the midst of triumphs, and bankruptcy with an\r\noverflowing exchequer. Burke, with general applause, compared him, in a\r\ntime of quiet and plenty, to the evil spirit whom Ovid described looking\r\ndown on the stately temples and wealthy haven of Athens, and scarce able\r\nto refrain from weeping because she could find nothing at which to weep.\r\nSuch a man was not likely to be popular. But to unpopularity Grenville\r\nopposed a dogged determination, which sometimes forced even those who\r\nhated him to respect him.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that Pitt and Grenville, being such as they were, should\r\ntake very different views of the situation of affairs. Pitt could see\r\nnothing but the trophies; Grenville could see nothing but the bill. Pitt\r\nboasted that England was victorious at once in America, in India, and in\r\nGermany, the umpire of the Continent, the mistress of the sea. Grenville\r\ncast up the subsidies, sighed over the army extraordinaries, and groaned\r\nin spirit to think that the nation had borrowed eight millions in one\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nWith a ministry thus divided it was not difficult for Bute to deal.\r\nLegge was the first who fell. He had given offence to the young King in\r\nthe late reign, by refusing to support a creature of Bute at a Hampshire\r\nelection. He was now not only turned out, but in the closet, when he\r\ndelivered up his seal of office, was treated with gross incivility.\r\n\r\nPitt, who did not love Legge, saw this event with indifference. But the\r\ndanger was now fast approaching {29}himself. Charles the Third of Spain\r\nhad early conceived a deadly hatred of England. Twenty years before,\r\nwhen he was King of the Two Sicilies, he had been eager to join the\r\ncoalition against Maria Theresa, But an English fleet had suddenly\r\nappeared in the Bay of Naples. An English captain had landed, had\r\nproceeded to the palace, had laid a watch on the table, and had told his\r\nmajesty that, within an hour, a treaty of neutrality must be signed, or\r\na bombardment would commence. The treaty was signed; the squadron sailed\r\nout of the bay twenty-four hours after it had sailed in; and from that\r\nday the ruling passion of the humbled Prince was aversion to the English\r\nname. He was at length in a situation in which he might hope to gratify\r\nthat passion. He had recently become King of Spain and the Indies. He\r\nsaw, with envy and apprehension, the triumphs of our navy, and the rapid\r\nextension of our colonial Empire. He was a Bourbon, and sympathized with\r\nthe distress of the house from which he sprang. He was a Spaniard; and\r\nno Spaniard could bear to see Gibraltar and Minorca in the possession of\r\na foreign power. Impelled by such feelings, Charles concluded a secret\r\ntreaty with France. By this treaty, known as the Family Compact, the\r\ntwo powers bound themselves not in express words, but by the clearest\r\nimplication, to make war on England in common. Spain postponed the\r\ndeclaration of hostilities only till her fleet, laden with the treasures\r\nof America, should have arrived.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the treaty could not be kept a secret from Pitt. He\r\nacted as a man of his capacity and energy might be expected to act. He\r\nat once proposed to declare war against Spain, and to intercept {30}the\r\nAmerican fleet. He had determined, it is said, to attack without delay\r\nboth Havanna and the Philippines.\r\n\r\nHis wise and resolute counsel was rejected. Bute was foremost in\r\nopposing it, and was supported by almost the whole cabinet. Some of\r\nthe ministers doubted, or affected to doubt, the correctness of Pitt’s\r\nintelligence; some shrank from the responsibility of advising a course\r\nso bold and decided as that which he proposed; some were weary of his\r\nascendency, and were glad to be rid of him on any pretext. One only of\r\nhis colleagues agreed with him, his brother-in-law, Earl Temple.\r\n\r\nPitt and Temple resigned their offices. To Pitt the young King behaved\r\nat parting in the most gracious manner. Pitt, who, proud and fiery every\r\nwhere else, was always meek and humble in the closet, was moved even to\r\ntears. The King and the favourite urged him to accept some substantial\r\nmark of royal gratitude. Would he like to be appointed governor of\r\nCanada? A salary of five thousand pounds a year should be annexed to the\r\noffice. Residence would not be required. It was true that the governor\r\nof Canada, as the law then stood, could not be a member of the House of\r\nCommons. But a bill should be brought in, authorising Pitt to hold\r\nhis government together with a seat in Parliament, and in the preamble\r\nshould be set forth his claims to the gratitude of his country. Pitt\r\nanswered, with all delicacy, that his anxieties were rather for his wife\r\nand family than for himself, and that nothing would be so acceptable to\r\nhim as a mark of royal goodness which might be beneficial to those\r\nwho were dearest to him. The hint was taken. The same Gazette which\r\nannounced the retirement of the Secretary of {31}State announced also\r\nthat, in consideration of his great public services, his wife had been\r\ncreated a peeress in her own right, and that a pension of three thousand\r\npounds a year, for three lives, had been bestowed on himself. It was\r\ndoubtless thought that the rewards and honours conferred on the great\r\nminister would have a conciliatory effect on the public mind. Perhaps,\r\ntoo, it was thought that his popularity, which had partly arisen from\r\nthe contempt which he had always shown for money, would be damaged by a\r\npension; and, indeed, a crowd of libels instantly appeared, in which he\r\nwas accused of having sold his country. Many of his true friends thought\r\nthat he would have best consulted the dignity of his character by\r\nrefusing to accept any pecuniary reward from the court. Nevertheless,\r\nthe general opinion of his talents, virtues, and services, remained\r\nunaltered. Addresses were presented to him from several large towns.\r\nLondon showed its admiration and affection in a still more marked\r\nmanner. Soon after his resignation came the Lord Mayor’s day. The King\r\nand the royal family dined at Guildhall. Pitt was one of the guests.\r\nThe young Sovereign, seated by his bride in his state coach, received a\r\nremarkable lesson. He was scarcely noticed. All eyes were fixed on the\r\nfallen minister; all acclamations directed to him. The streets, the\r\nbalconies, the chimney tops, burst into a roar of delight as his chariot\r\npassed by. The ladies waved their handkerchiefs from the windows. The\r\ncommon people clung to the wheels, shook hands with the footmen, and\r\neven kissed the horses. Cries of “No Bute!”\r\n\r\n“No Newcastle salmon!” were mingled with the shouts of “Pitt for ever!”\r\n When Pitt entered Guildhall, he was welcomed by loud huzzas and clapping\r\nof hands, {32}in which the very magistrates of the city joined. Lord\r\nBute, in the mean time, was hooted and pelted through Cheapside, and\r\nwould, it was thought, have been in some danger, if he had not taken\r\nthe precaution of surrounding his carriage with a strong body guard\r\nof boxers. Many persons blamed the conduct of Pitt on this occasion as\r\ndisrespectful to the King. Indeed, Pitt himself afterwards owned that\r\nhe had done wrong. He was led into this error, as he was afterwards\r\nled into more serious errors, by the influence of his turbulent and\r\nmischievous brother-in-law, Temple.\r\n\r\nThe events which immediately followed Pitt’s retirement raised his fame\r\nhigher than ever. War with Spain proved to be, as he had predicted,\r\ninevitable. News came from the West Indies that Martinique had been\r\ntaken by an expedition which he had sent forth. Havanna fell; and it was\r\nknown that he had planned an attack on Favanna. Manilla capitulated;\r\nand it was believed that he had meditated a blow against Manilla. The\r\nAmerican fleet, which he had proposed to intercept, had unloaded an\r\nimmense cargo of bullion in the haven of Cadiz, before Bute could\r\nbe convinced that the Court of Madrid really entertained hostile\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\nThe session of Parliament which followed Pitt’s retirement passed over\r\nwithout any violent storm. Lord Bute took on himself the most prominent\r\npart in the House of Lords. He had become Secretary of State, and indeed\r\nprime minister, without having once opened his lips in public except as\r\nan actor. There was, therefore, no small curiosity to know how he would\r\nacquit himself. Members of the House of Commons crowded the bar of the\r\nLords, and covered the steps of the throne. It was generally expected\r\n{33}that the orator would break down; but his most malicious hearers\r\nwere forced to own that he had made a better figure than they expected.\r\nThey, indeed, ridiculed his action as theatrical, and his style as\r\ntumid. They were especially amused by the long pauses which, not from\r\nhesitation, but from affectation, he made at all the emphatic words, and\r\nCharles Townshend cried out, “Minute guns!” The general opinion however\r\nwas, that, if Bute had been early practised in debate, he might have\r\nbecome an impressive speaker.\r\n\r\nIn the Commons, George Grenville had been intrusted with the lead. The\r\ntask was not, as yet, a very difficult one: for Pitt did not think fit\r\nto raise the standard of opposition. His speeches at this time were\r\ndistinguished, not only by that eloquence in which he excelled all his\r\nrivals, but also by a temperance and a modesty which had too often been\r\nwanting to his character. When war was declared against Spain, he justly\r\nlaid claim to the merit of having foreseen what had at length\r\nbecome manifest to all, but he carefully abstained from arrogant and\r\nacrimonious expressions; and this abstinence was the more honourable to\r\nhim, because his temper, never very placid, was now severely tried, both\r\nby gout and by calumny. The courtiers had adopted a mode of warfare,\r\nwhich was soon turned with far more formidable effect against\r\nthemselves. Half the inhabitants of the Grub Street garrets paid their\r\nmilk scores, and got their shirts out of pawn, by abusing Pitt. His\r\nGerman war, his subsidies, his pension, his wife’s peerage, were shin\r\nof beef and gin, blankets and baskets of small coal, to the starving\r\npoetasters of the Fleet. Even in the House of Commons, he was, on one\r\noccasion during {34}this session, assailed with an insolence and malice\r\nwhich called forth the indignation of men of all parties; but he endured\r\nthe outrage with majestic patience. In his younger days he had been but\r\ntoo prompt to retaliate on those who attacked him; but now, conscious of\r\nhis great services, and of the space which he filled in the eyes of all\r\nmankind, he would not stoop to personal squabbles. “This is no season,”\r\n he said, in the debate on the Spanish war, “for altercation and\r\nrecrimination. A day has arrived when every Englishman should stand\r\nforth for his country. Arm the whole; be one people; forget every thing\r\nbut the public. I set you the example. Harassed by slanderers, sinking\r\nunder pain and disease, for the publie I forget both my wrongs and my\r\ninfirmities!” On a general review of his life, we are inclined to think\r\nthat his genius and virtue never shone with so pure an effulgence as\r\nduring the session of 1762.\r\n\r\nThe session drew towards the close; and Bute, emboldened by the\r\nacquiescence of the Houses, resolved to strike another great blow, and\r\nto become first minister in name as well as in reality. That coalition,\r\nwhich a few months before had seemed all powerful, had been dissolved.\r\nThe retreat of Pitt had deprived the government of popularity. Newcastle\r\nhad exulted in the fall of the illustrious colleague whom he envied and\r\ndreaded, and had not foreseen that his own doom was at hand; he still\r\ntried to flatter himself that he was at the head of the government; but\r\ninsults heaped on insults at length undeceived him. Places which\r\nhad always been considered as in his gift, were bestowed without any\r\nreference to him. His expostulations only called forth significant hints\r\nthat it was time for him to retire. {35}One day he pressed on Bute the\r\nclaims of a Whig Prelate to the archbishopric of York. “If your grace\r\nthinks so highly of him,” answered Bute, “I wonder that you did not\r\npromote him when you had the power.” Still the old man clung with a\r\ndesperate grasp to the wreck. Seldom, indeed, have Christian meekness\r\nand Christian humility equalled the meekness and humility of his patient\r\nand abject ambition. At length he was forced to understand that all\r\nwas over. He quitted that Court where he had held high office during\r\nforty-five years, and hid his shame and regret among the cedars of\r\nClaremont. Bute became first lord of the treasury.\r\n\r\nThe favourite had undoubtedly committed a great error. It is impossible\r\nto imagine a tool better suited to his purposes than that which he thus\r\nthrew away, or rather put into the hands of his enemies. If Newcastle\r\nhad been suffered to play at being first minister, Bute might\r\nsecurely and quietly have enjoyed the substance of power. The gradual\r\nintroduction of Tories into all the departments of the government might\r\nhave been effected without any violent clamour, if the chief of the\r\ngreat Whig connection had been ostensibly at the head of affairs. This\r\nwas strongly represented to Bute by Lord Mansfield, a man who may justly\r\nbe called the father of modern Toryism, of Toryism modified to suit an\r\norder of things under which the House of Commons is the most powerful\r\nbody in the state. The theories which had dazzled Bute could not\r\nimpose on the fine intellect of Mansfield. The temerity with which Bute\r\nprovoked the hostility of powerful and deeply rooted interests,\r\nwas displeasing to Mansfield’s cold and timid nature. Expostulation,\r\nhowever, was vain. Bute was impatient of advice, {36}drunk with success,\r\neager to he, in show as well as in reality, the head of the government.\r\nHe had engaged in an undertaking in which a screen was absolutely\r\nnecessary to his success, and even to his safety. He found an excellent\r\nscreen ready in the very place where it was most needed; and he rudely\r\npushed it away.\r\n\r\nAnd now the new system of government came into full operation. For the\r\nfirst time since the accession of the House of Hanover, the Tory party\r\nwas in the ascendant. The prime minister himself was a Tory. Lord\r\nEgremont, who had succeeded Pitt as Secretary of State, was a Tory, and\r\nthe son of a Tory. Sir Francis Dash wood, a man of slender parts,\r\nof small experience, and of notoriously immoral character, was made\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, for no reason that could be imagined,\r\nexcept that he was a Tory, and had been a Jacobite. The royal household\r\nwas filled with men whose favourite toast, a few years before, had been\r\nthe King over the water. The relative position of the two great national\r\nseats of learning was suddenly changed. The University of Oxford had\r\nlong been the chief seat of disaffection. In troubled times, the High\r\nStreet had been lined with bayonets; the colleges had been searched by\r\nthe King’s messengers. Grave doctors were in the habit of talking very\r\nCiceronian treason in the theatre; and the undergraduates drank bumpers\r\nto Jacobite toasts, and chanted Jacobite airs. Of four successive\r\nChancellors of the University, one had notoriously been in the\r\nPretender’s service; the other three were fully believed to be in secret\r\ncorrespondence with the exiled family. Cambridge had therefore been\r\nespecially favoured by the Hanoverian Princes, and had shown herself\r\ngrateful {37}for their patronage. George the First had enriched her\r\nlibrary; George the Second had contributed munificently to her Senate\r\nHouse. Bishoprics and deaneries were showered on her children. Her\r\nChancellor was Newcastle, the chief of the Whig aristocracy; her High\r\nSteward was Hardwicke, the Whig head of the law. Both her burgesses\r\nhad held office under the Whig ministry. Times had now changed. The\r\nUniversity of Cambridge was received at St. James’s with comparative\r\ncoldness. The answers to the addresses of Oxford were all graciousness\r\nand warmth.\r\n\r\nThe watchwords of the new government were prerogative and purity. The\r\nsovereign was no longer to be a puppet in the hands of any subject, or\r\nof any combination of subjects. George the Third would not be forced to\r\ntake ministers whom he disliked, as his grandfather had been forced to\r\ntake Pitt. George the Third would not be forced to part with any whom\r\nhe delighted to honour, as his grandfather had been forced to part with\r\nCarteret. At the same time, the system of bribery which had grown up\r\nduring the late reigns was to cease. It was ostentatiously proclaimed\r\nthat, since the accession of the young King, neither constituents nor\r\nrepresentatives had been bought with the secret service money. To free\r\nBritain from corruption and oligarchical cabals, to detach her from\r\ncontinental connections, to bring the bloody and expensive war with\r\nFrance and Spain to a close, such were the specious objects which Bute\r\nprofessed to procure.\r\n\r\nSome of these objects he attained. England withdrew, at the cost of\r\na deep stain on her faith, from her German connections. The war with\r\nFrance and Spain was terminated by a peace, honourable indeed\r\nand advantageous {38}to our country, yet less honourable and less\r\nadvantageous than might have been expected from a long and almost\r\nunbroken series of victories, by land and sea, in every part of the\r\nworld. But the only effect of Bute’s domestic administration was to make\r\nfaction wilder, and corruption fouler than ever.\r\n\r\nThe mutual animosity of the Whig and Tory parties had begun to languish\r\nafter the fall of Walpole, and had seemed to be almost extinct at the\r\nclose of the reign of George the Second. It now revived in all its\r\nforce. Many Whigs, it is true, were still in office. The Duke of Bedford\r\nhad signed the treaty with France. The Duke of Devonshire, though much\r\nout of humour, still continued to be Lord Chamberlain. Grenville, who\r\nled the House of Commons, and Fox, who still enjoyed in silence the\r\nimmense gains of the Pay Office, had always been regarded as strong\r\nWhigs. But the bulk of the party throughout the country regarded the new\r\nminister with abhorrence. There was, indeed, no want of popular themes\r\nfor invective against his character. He was a favourite; and favourites\r\nhave always been odious in this country. No mere favourite had been at\r\nthe head of the government since the dagger of Felton had reached the\r\nheart of the Duke of Buckingham. After that event the most arbitrary and\r\nthe most frivolous of the Stuarts had felt the necessity of confiding\r\nthe chief direction of affairs to men who had given some proof of\r\nparliamentary or official talent. Strafford, Falkland, Clarendon,\r\nClifford, Shaftesbury, Lauderdale, Dauby, Temple, Halifax, Rochester,\r\nSunderland, whatever their faults might be, were all men of acknowledged\r\nability. They did not owe their eminence merely to the favour of the\r\nsovereign. On the contrary, they owed the favour of the {39}sovereign to\r\ntheir eminence. Most of them, indeed, had first attracted the notice of\r\nthe court by the capacity and vigour which they had shown in opposition.\r\nThe Revolution seemed to have for ever secured the state against the\r\ndomination of a Carr or a Villiers. Now, however, the personal regard\r\nof the King had at once raised a man who had seen nothing of public\r\nbusiness, who had never opened his lips in parliament, over the heads\r\nof a crowd of eminent orators, financiers, diplomatists. From a\r\nprivate gentleman, this fortunate minion had at once been turned into\r\na Secretary of State. He had made his maiden speech when at the head of\r\nthe administration. The vulgar resorted to a simple explanation of the\r\nphenomenon, and the coarsest ribaldry against the Princess Mother was\r\nscrawled on every wall and sung in every alley.\r\n\r\nThis was not all. The spirit of party, roused by impolitic provocation\r\nfrom its long sleep, roused in turn a still fiercer and more malignant\r\nFury, the spirit of national animosity. The grudge of Whig against Tory\r\nwas mingled with the grudge of Englishman against Scot. The two sections\r\nof the great British people had not yet been indissolubly blended\r\ntogether. The events of 1715 and of 1745 had left painful and enduring\r\ntraces. The tradesmen of Cornhill had been in dread of seeing their\r\ntills and warehouses plundered by barelegged mountaineers from the\r\nGrampians. They still recollected that Black Friday, when the news\r\ncame that the rebels were at Derby, when all the shops in the city were\r\nclosed, and when the Bank of England began to pay in sixpences. The\r\nScots, on the other hand, remembered, with natural resentment, the\r\nseverity with which the insurgents had been chastised, the military\r\noutrages, the humiliating laws, the heads {40}fixed on Temple Bar, the\r\nfires and quartering blocks on Kennington Common. The favourite did not\r\nsuffer the English to forget from what part of the island he came. The\r\ncry of all the south was that the public offices, the army, the navy,\r\nwere filled with highcheeked Drummonds and Erskines, Macdonalds and\r\nMacgillivrays, who could not talk a Christian tongue, and some of whom\r\nhad but lately begun to wear Christian breeches. All the old jokes on\r\nhills without trees, girls without stockings, men eating the food of\r\nhorses, pails emptied from the fourteenth story, were pointed against\r\nthese lucky adventurers. To the honour of the Scots it must be said,\r\nthat their prudence and their pride restrained them from retaliation.\r\nLike the princess in the Arabian tale, they stopped their ears tight,\r\nand, unmoved by the shrillest notes of abuse, walked on, without once\r\nlooking round, straight towards the Golden Fountain.\r\n\r\nBute, who had always been considered as a man of taste and reading,\r\naffected, from the moment of his elevation, the character of a Mæcenas.\r\nIf he expected to conciliate the public by encouraging literature and\r\nart, he was grievously mistaken. Indeed, none of the objects of his\r\nmunificence, with the single exception of Johnson, can be said to\r\nhave been well selected; and the public, not unnaturally, ascribed the\r\nselection of Johnson rather to the Doctor’s political prejudices than to\r\nhis literary merits: for a wretched scribbler named Shebbeare, who had\r\nnothing in common with Johnson except violent Jacobitism, and who had\r\nstood in the pillory for a libel on the Revolution, was honoured with\r\na mark of royal approbation, similar to that which was bestowed on the\r\nauthor of the English Dictionary, and of the Vanity of Human Wishes. It\r\n{41}was remarked that Adam, a Scotchman, was the court architect, and\r\nthat Ramsay, a Scotchman, was the court painter, and was preferred to\r\nReynolds. Mallet, a Scotchman, of no high literary fame, and of infamous\r\ncharacter, partook largely of the liberality of the government. John\r\nHome, a Scotchman, was rewarded for the tragedy of Douglas, both with a\r\npension and with a sinecure place. But, when the author of the Bard,\r\nand of the Elegy in a Country Churchyard, ventured to ask for a\r\nProfessorship, the emoluments of which he much needed, and for the\r\nduties of which he was, in many respects, better qualified than any man\r\nliving, he was refused; and the post was bestowed on the pedagogue under\r\nwhose care the favourite’s son-in-law, Sir James Lowther, had made such\r\nsignal proficiency in the graces and in the humane virtues.\r\n\r\nThus, the first lord of the treasury was detested by many as a Tory, by\r\nmany as a favourite, and by many as a Scot. All the hatred which flowed\r\nfrom these various sources soon mingled, and was directed in one torrent\r\nof obloquy against the treaty of peace. The Duke of Bedford, who\r\nhad negotiated that treaty, was hooted through the streets. Bute was\r\nattacked in his chair, and was with difficulty rescued by a troop of the\r\nguards. He could hardly walk the streets in safety without disguising\r\nhimself. A gentleman who died not many years ago used to say that he\r\nonce recognised the favourite Earl in the piazza of Covent Garden,\r\nmuffled in a large coat, and with a hat and wig drawn down over his\r\nbrows. His lordship’s established type with the mob was a jack boot,\r\na wretched pun on his Christian name and title. A jack boot, generally\r\naccompanied by a petticoat, was sometimes fastened on a {42}gallows,\r\nand sometimes committed to the flames. Libels on the court, exceeding\r\nin audacity and rancour any that had been published for many years, now\r\nappeared daily, both in prose and verse. Wilkes, with lively insolence,\r\ncompared the mother of George the Third to the mother of Edward the\r\nThird, and the Scotch minister to the gentle Mortimer. Churchill, with\r\nall the energy of hatred, deplored the fate of his country, invaded by\r\na new race of savages, more cruel and ravenous than the Picts or the\r\nDanes, the poor, proud children of Leprosy and Hunger. It is a\r\nslight circumstance, but deserves to be recorded, that in this year\r\npamphleteers first ventured to print at length the names of the great\r\nmen whom they lampooned. George the Second had always been the K------.\r\nHis ministers had been Sir R------W------, Mr. P------, and the Duke of\r\nN------. But the libellers of George the Third, of the Princess Mother,\r\nand of Lord Bute did not give quarter to a single vowel.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed that Lord Temple secretly encouraged the most scurrilous\r\nassailants of the government. In truth, those who knew his habits\r\ntracked him as men track a mole. It was his nature to grub underground.\r\nWhenever a heap of dirt was flung up it might well be suspected that he\r\nwas at work in some foul crooked labyrinth below. Pitt turned away from\r\nthe filthy work of opposition, with the same scorn with which he had\r\nturned away from the filthy work of government. He had the magnanimity\r\nto proclaim every where the disgust which he felt at the insults offered\r\nby his own adherents to the Scottish nation, and missed no opportunity\r\nof extolling the courage and fidelity which the Highland regiments had\r\ndisplayed through the whole war. But, though he disdained to {43}use any\r\nbut lawful and honourable weapons, it was well known that his fair blows\r\nwere likely to be far more formidable than the privy thrusts of his\r\nbrother-in-law’s stiletto.\r\n\r\nBute’s heart began to fail him. The Houses were about to meet. The\r\ntreaty would instantly be the subject of discussion. It was probable\r\nthat Pitt, the great Whig connection, and the multitude, would all be on\r\nthe same side. The favourite had professed to hold in abhorrence those\r\nmeans by which preceding ministers had kept the House of Commons in\r\ngood humour. He now began to think that he had been too scrupulous. His\r\nUtopian visions were at an end. It was necessary, not only to bribe,\r\nbut to bribe more shamelessly and flagitiously than his predecessors, in\r\norder to make up for lost time. A majority must be secured, no matter\r\nby what means. Could Grenville do this? Would he do it? His firmness\r\nand ability had not yet been tried in any perilous crisis. He had been\r\ngenerally regarded as a humble follower of his brother Temple, and of\r\nhis brother-in-law Pitt, and was supposed, though with little reason, to\r\nbe still favourably inclined towards them. Other aid must be called in.\r\nAnd where was other aid to be found?\r\n\r\nThere was one man, whose sharp and manly logic had often in debate been\r\nfound a match for the lofty and impassioned rhetoric of Pitt, whose\r\ntalents for jobbing were not inferior to his talents for debate, whose\r\ndauntless spirit shrank from no difficulty or danger, and who was as\r\nlittle troubled with scruples as with fears. Henry Fox, or nobody, could\r\nweather the storm which was about to burst. Yet was he a person to whom\r\nthe court, even in that extremity, was unwilling to have recourse. He\r\nhad always been regarded {44}as a Whig of the Whigs. He had been the\r\nfriend and disciple of Walpole. He had long been connected by close ties\r\nwith William Duke of Cumberland. By the Tories he was more hated than\r\nany man living. So strong was their aversion to him that when, in\r\nthe late reign, he had attempted to form a party against the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, they had thrown all their weight into Newcastle’s scale. By\r\nthe Scots, Fox was abhorred as the confidential friend of the conqueror\r\nof Culloden. He was, on personal grounds, most obnoxious to the Princess\r\nMother. For he had, immediately after her husband’s death, advised the\r\nlate King to take the education of her son, the heir apparent, entirely\r\nout of her hands. He had recently given, if possible, still deeper\r\noffence; for he had indulged, not without some ground, the ambitious\r\nhope that his beautiful sister-in-law, the Lady Sarah Lennox, might be\r\nqueen of England. It had been observed that the King at one time\r\nrode every morning by the grounds of Holland House, and that, on such\r\noccasions, Lady Sarah, dressed like a shepherdess at a masquerade, was\r\nmaking hay close to the road, which was then separated by no wall from\r\nthe lawn. On account of the part which Fox had taken in this singular\r\nlove affair, he was the only member of the Privy Council who was not\r\nsummoned to the meeting at which his Majesty announced his intended\r\nmarriage with the Princess of Mecklenburg. Of all the statesmen of the\r\nage, therefore, it seemed that Fox was the last with whom Bute the\r\nTory, the Scot, the favourite of the Princess Mother, could, under any\r\ncircumstances, act. Yet to Fox Bute was now compelled to apply.\r\n\r\nFox had many noble and amiable qualities, which in private life shone\r\nforth in full lustre, and made him {45}dear to his children, to his\r\ndependents, and to his friends; but as a public man he had no title\r\nto esteem. In him the vices which were common to the whole school of\r\nWalpole appeared, not perhaps in then-worst, but certainly in their most\r\nprominent form; for his parliamentary and official talents made all his\r\nfaults conspicuous. His courage, his vehement temper, his contempt for\r\nappearances, led him to display much that others, quite as unscrupulous\r\nas himself, covered with a decent veil. He was the most unpopular of the\r\nstatesmen of his time, not because he sinned more than many of them, but\r\nbecause he canted less.\r\n\r\nHe felt his unpopularity; but he felt it after the fashion of strong\r\nminds. He became, not cautious, but reckless, and faced the rage of the\r\nwhole nation with a scowl of inflexible defiance. He was born with a\r\nsweet and generous temper; but he had been goaded and baited into a\r\nsavageness which was not natural to him, and which amazed and shocked\r\nthose who knew him best. Such was the man to whom Bute, in extreme need,\r\napplied for succour.\r\n\r\nThat succour Fox was not unwilling to afford. Though by no means of\r\nan envious temper, he had undoubtedly contemplated the success and\r\npopularity of Pitt with bitter mortification. He thought himself Pitt’s\r\nmatch as a debater, and Pitt’s superior as a man of business. They had\r\nlong been regarded as well-paired rivals. They had started fair in the\r\ncareer of ambition. They had long run side by side. At length Fox had\r\ntaken the lead, and Pitt had fallen behind. Then had come a sudden turn\r\nof fortune, like that in Virgil’s foot-race. Fox had stumbled in the\r\nmire, and had not only been defeated, but befouled. Pitt had reached the\r\ngoal, and received the prize. The emoluments {46}of the Pay Office might\r\ninduce the defeated statesman to submit in silence to the ascendency of\r\nhis competitor, but, could not satisfy a mind conscious of great powers,\r\nand sore from great vexations. As soon, therefore, as a party arose\r\nadverse to the war and to the supremacy of the great war minister, the\r\nhopes of Fox began to revive. His fends with the Princess Mother, with\r\nthe Scots, with the Tories, he was ready to forget, if, by the help of\r\nhis old enemies, he could now regain the importance which he had lost,\r\nand confront Pitt on equal terms.\r\n\r\nThe alliance was, therefore, soon concluded. Fox was assured that, if he\r\nwould pilot the government out of its embarrassing situation, he should\r\nbe rewarded with a peerage, of which he had long been desirous. He\r\nundertook on his side to obtain, by fair or foul means, a vote in favour\r\nof the peace. In consequence of this arrangement he became leader of\r\nthe House of Commons; and Grenville, stifling his vexation as well as he\r\ncould, sullenly acquiesced in the change.\r\n\r\nFox had expected that his influence would secure to the court the\r\ncordial support of some eminent Whigs who were his personal friends,\r\nparticularly of the Duke of Cumberland and of the Duke of Devonshire.\r\nHe was disappointed, and soon found that, in addition to all his other\r\ndifficulties, he must reckon on the opposition of the ablest prince of\r\nthe blood, and of the great house of Cavendish.\r\n\r\nBut he had pledged himself to win the battle; and he was not a man to go\r\nback. It was no time for squeamishness. Bute was made to comprehend that\r\nthe ministry could be saved only by practising the tactics of Walpole to\r\nan extent at which Walpole {47}himself would have stared. The Pay Office\r\nwas turned into a mart for votes. Hundreds of members were closeted\r\nthere with Fox, and, as there is too much reason to believe, departed\r\ncarrying with them the wages of infamy. It was affirmed by persons who\r\nhad the best opportunities of obtaining information, that twenty-five\r\nthousand pounds were thus paid away in a single morning. The lowest\r\nbribe given, it was said, was a bank-note for two hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nIntimidation was joined with corruption. All ranks, from the highest to\r\nthe lowest, were to be taught that the King would be obeyed. The Lords\r\nLieutenants of several counties were dismissed. The Duke of Devonshire\r\nwas especially singled out as the victim by whose fate the magnates\r\nof England were to take warning. His wealth, rank, and influence, his\r\nstainless private character, and the constant attachment of his\r\nfamily to the House of Hanover did not secure him from gross personal\r\nindignity. It was known that he disapproved of the course which the\r\ngovernment had taken; and it was accordingly determined to humble the\r\nPrince of the Whigs, as he had been nicknamed by the Princess Mother. He\r\nwent to the palace to pay his duty. “Tell him,” said the King to a page,\r\n“that I will not see him.” The page hesitated. “Go to him,” said the\r\nKing, “and tell him those very words.” The message was delivered.\r\nThe Duke tore off his gold key, and went away boiling with anger. His\r\nrelations who were in office instantly resigned. A few days later, the\r\nKing called for the list of Privy Councillors, and with his own hand\r\nstruck out the Duke’s name.\r\n\r\nIn this step there was at least courage, though little wisdom or good\r\nnature. But, as nothing was too high {48}For the revenge of the court,\r\nso also was nothing too low. A persecution, such as had never been\r\nknown before, and has never been known since, raged in every public\r\ndepartment. Great numbers of humble and laborious clerks were deprived\r\nof their bread, not because they had neglected their duties, not because\r\nthey had taken an active part against the ministry, but merely because\r\nthey had owed their situations to the recommendation of some nobleman\r\nor gentleman who was against the peace. The proscription extended to\r\ntidewaiters, to gaugers, to doorkeepers. One poor man to whom a pension\r\nhad been given for his gallantry in a fight with smugglers, was deprived\r\nof it because he had been befriended by the Duke of Grafton. An aged\r\nwidow, who, on account of her husband’s services in the navy, had, many\r\nyears before, been made housekeeper to a public office, was dismissed\r\nfrom her situation, because it was imagined that she was distantly\r\nconnected by marriage with the Cavendish family. The public clamour, as\r\nmay well be supposed, grew daily louder and louder. But the louder\r\nit grew, the more resolutely did Fox go on with the work which he had\r\nbegun. His old friends could not conceive what had possessed him. “I\r\ncould forgive,” said the Duke of Cumberland, “Fox’s political vagaries;\r\nbut I am quite confounded by his inhumanity. Surely he used to be the\r\nbest-natured of men.”\r\n\r\nAt last Fox went so far as to take a legal opinion on the question,\r\nwhether the patents granted by George the Second were binding on George\r\nthe Third. It is said, that, if his colleagues had not flinched, he\r\nwould at once have turned out the Tellers of the Exchequer and Justices\r\nin Eyre.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Parliament met. The ministers, more {49}hated by the\r\npeople than ever, were secure of a majority, and they had also reason to\r\nhope that they would have the advantage in the debates as well as in the\r\ndivisions; for Pitt was confined to his chamber by a severe attack of\r\ngout. His friends moved to defer the consideration of the treaty till\r\nhe should be able to attend: but the motion was rejected. The great\r\nday arrived. The discussion had lasted some time, when a loud huzza was\r\nheard in Palace Yard. The noise came nearer and nearer, up the stairs,\r\nthrough the lobby. The door opened, and from the midst of a shouting\r\nmultitude came forth Pitt, borne in the arms of his attendants. His face\r\nwas thin and ghastly, his limbs swathed in flannel, his crutch in his\r\nhand. The bearers set him down within the bar. His friends instantly\r\nsurrounded him, and with their help he crawled to his seat near the\r\ntable. In this condition he spoke three hours and a half against the\r\npeace. During that time he was repeatedly forced to sit down and to use\r\ncordials. It may well be supposed that his voice was faint, that his\r\naction was languid, and that his speech, though occasionally brilliant\r\nand impressive, was feeble when compared with his best oratorical\r\nperformances. But those who remembered what he had done, and who saw\r\nwhat he suffered, listened to him with emotions stronger than any that\r\nmere eloquence can produce. He was unable to stay for the division, and\r\nwas carried away from the House amidst shouts as loud as those which had\r\nannounced his arrival.\r\n\r\nA large majority approved the peace. The exultation of the court was\r\nboundless. “Now,” exclaimed the Princess Mother, “my son is really\r\nKing.” The young sovereign spoke of himself as freed from the\r\n{50}bondage in which his grandfather had been held. On one point, it\r\nwas announced, his mind was unalterably made up. Under no circumstances\r\nwhatever should those Whig grandees, who had enslaved his predecessors\r\nand endeavoured to enslave himself, be restored to power.\r\n\r\nThis vaunting was premature. The real strength of the favourite was\r\nby no means proportioned to the number of votes which he had, on\r\none particular division, been able to command. He was soon again in\r\ndifficulties. The most important part of his budget was a tax on cider.\r\nThis measure was opposed, not only by those who were generally hostile\r\nto his administration, but also by many of his supporters. The name of\r\nexcise had always been hateful to the Tories. One of the chief crimes of\r\nWalpole in their eyes, had been his partiality for this mode of raising\r\nmoney. The Tory Johnson had in his Dictionary given so scurrilous a\r\ndefinition of the word Excise, that the Commissioners of Excise had\r\nseriously thought of prosecuting him. The counties which the new impost\r\nparticularly affected had always been Tory counties. It was the boast of\r\nJohn Philips, the poet of the English vintage, that the Cider-land had\r\never been faithful to the throne, and that all the pruning-hooks of her\r\nthousand orchards had been beaten into swords for the service of the\r\nill fated Stuarts. The effect of Bute’s fiscal scheme was to produce an\r\nunion between the gentry and yeomanry of the Cider-land and the Whigs of\r\nthe capital. Herefordshire and Worcestershire were in a flame. The city\r\nof London, though not so directly interested, was, if possible, still\r\nmore excited. The debates on this question irreparably damaged the\r\ngovernment. Dashwood’s financial statement {51}had been confused and\r\nabsurd beyond belief, and had been received by the House with roars of\r\nlaughter. He had sense enough to be conscious of his unfitness for the\r\nhigh situation which he held, and exclaimed in a comical fit of despair,\r\n“What shall I do? The boys will point at me in the street, and cry,\r\n‘There goes the worst Chancellor of the Exchequer that ever was.’”\r\n George Grenville came to the rescue, and spoke strongly on his favourite\r\ntheme, the profusion with which the late war had been carried on. That\r\nprofusion, he said, had made taxes necessary. He called on the gentlemen\r\nopposite to him to say where they would have a tax laid, and dwelt\r\non this topic with his usual prolixity. “Let them tell me where,” he\r\nrepeated in a monotonous and somewhat fretful tone. “I say, sir, let\r\nthem tell me where. I repeat it, sir; I am entitled to say to them,\r\nTell me where.” Unluckily for him, Pitt had come down to the House that\r\nnight, and had been bitterly provoked by the reflections thrown on\r\nthe war. He revenged himself by murmuring, in a whine resembling\r\nGrenville’s, a line of a well known song, “Gentle Shepherd, tell me\r\nwhere.”\r\n\r\n“If,” cried Grenville, “gentlemen are to be treated in this way----”\r\n\r\nPitt, as was his fashion, when he meant to mark extreme contempt, rose\r\ndeliberately, made his bow, and walked out of the House, leaving\r\nhis brother-in-law in convulsions of rage, and every body else in\r\nconvulsions of laughter. It was long before Grenville lost the nickname\r\nof the Gentle Shepherd.\r\n\r\nBut the ministry had vexations still more serious to endure. The hatred\r\nwhich the Tories and Scots bore to Fox was implacable. In a moment of\r\nextreme peril, they had consented to put themselves under his guidance.\r\n{52}But the aversion with which they regarded him broke forth as soon\r\nas the crisis seemed to be over. Some of them attacked him about the\r\naccounts of the Pay Office. Some of them rudely interrupted him when\r\nspeaking, by laughter and ironical cheers, he was naturally desirous to\r\nescape from so disagreeable a situation, and demanded the peerage which\r\nhad been promised as the reward of his services.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that there must be some change in the composition of the\r\nministry. But scarcely any, even of those who, from their situation,\r\nmight be supposed to be in all the secrets of the government,\r\nanticipated what really took place. To the amazement of the Parliament\r\nand the nation, it was suddenly announced that Bute had resigned.\r\n\r\nTwenty different explanations of this strange step were suggested. Some\r\nattributed it to profound design, and some to sudden panic. Some said\r\nthat the lampoons of the opposition had driven the Earl from the field;\r\nsome that he had taken office only in order to bring the war to a close,\r\nand had always meant to retire when that object had been accomplished.\r\nHe publicly assigned ill health as his reason for quitting business,\r\nand privately complained that he was not cordially seconded by his\r\ncolleagues, and that Lord Mansfield, in particular, whom he had himself\r\nbrought into the cabinet, gave him no support in the House of Peers.\r\nMansfield was, indeed, far too sagacious not to perceive that Bute’s\r\nsituation was one of great peril, and far too timorous to thrust himself\r\ninto peril for the sake of another. The probability, however, is that\r\nBute’s conduct on this occasion, like the conduct of most men on most\r\noccasions, was determined by mixed motives. We suspect that he was sick\r\nof office; for {53}this is a feeling much more common among ministers\r\nthan persons who see public life from a distance are disposed to\r\nbelieve; and nothing could be more natural than that this feeling should\r\ntake possession of the mind of Bute. In general, a statesman climbs by\r\nslow degrees. Many laborious years elapse before he reaches the topmost\r\npinnacle of preferment. In the earlier part of his career, therefore, he\r\nis constantly lured on by seeing something above him. During his ascent\r\nhe gradually becomes inured to the annoyances which belong to a life\r\nof ambition. By the time that he has attained the highest point, he has\r\nbecome patient of labour and callous to abuse. He is kept constant to\r\nhis vocation, in spite of all its discomforts, at first by hope, and\r\nat last by habit. It was not so with Bute. His whole public life lasted\r\nlittle more than two years. On the day on which he became a politician\r\nhe became a cabinet minister. In a few months he was, both in name and\r\nin show, chief of the administration. Greater than he had been he could\r\nnot be. If what he already possessed was vanity and vexation of spirit,\r\nno delusion remained to entice him onward. He had been cloyed with the\r\npleasures of ambition before he had been seasoned to its pains. His\r\nhabits had not been such as were likely to fortify his mind against\r\nobloquy and public hatred. He had reached his forty-eighth year in\r\ndignified ease, without knowing, by personal experience, what it was\r\nto be ridiculed and slandered. All at once, without any previous\r\ninitiation, he had found himself exposed to such a storm of invective\r\nand satire as had never burst on the head of any statesman. The\r\nemoluments of office were now nothing to him; for he had just succeeded\r\nto a princely property by the death of his father-in-law. All the\r\nhonours {54}which could be bestowed on him he had already secured. He\r\nhad obtained the Garter for himself, and a British peerage for his son.\r\nHe seems also to have imagined that by quitting the treasury he should\r\nescape from danger and abuse without really resigning power, and should\r\nstill be able to exercise in private supreme influence over the royal\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been his motives, he retired. Fox at the same time\r\ntook refuse in the House of Lords; and George Grenville became First\r\nLord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nWe believe that those who made this arrangement fully intended that\r\nGrenville should be a mere puppet in the hands of Bute; for Grenville\r\nwas as yet very imperfectly known even to those who had observed him\r\nlong. He passed for a mere official drudge; and he had all the industry,\r\nthe minute accuracy, the formality, the tediousness, which belong to\r\nthe character. But he had other qualities which had not yet shown\r\nthemselves, devouring ambition, dauntless courage, selfconfidence\r\namounting to presumption, and a temper which could not endure\r\nopposition. He was not disposed to be any body’s tool; and he had no\r\nattachment, political or personal, to Bute. The two men had, indeed,\r\nnothing in common, except a strong propensity towards harsh and\r\nunpopular courses. Their principles were fundamentally different. Bute\r\nwas a Tory. Grenville would have been very angry with any person\r\nwho should have denied his claim to be a Whig. He was more prone to\r\ntyrannical measures than Bute; but he loved tyranny only when disguised\r\nunder the forms of constitutional liberty. He mixed up, after a\r\nfashion then not very unusual, the theories of the republicans of the\r\nseventeenth century with the technical maxims {55}of English law,\r\nand thus succeeded in combining anarchical speculation with arbitrary\r\npractice. The voice of the people was the voice of God; but the only\r\nlegitimate organ through which the voice of the people could be uttered\r\nwas the Parliament. All power was from the people; but to the Parliament\r\nthe whole power of the people had been delegated. No Oxonian divine had\r\never, even in the years which immediately follow ed the Restoration,\r\ndemanded for the King so abject, so unreasoning a homage, as Grenville\r\non what he considered as the purest Whig principles, demanded for the\r\nParliament. As he wished to see the Parliament despotic over the nation,\r\nso he wished to see it also despotic over the court. In his view the\r\nprime minister, possessed of the confidence of the House of Commons,\r\nought to be Mayor of the Palace. The King was a mere Childeric or\r\nChilperic, who might well think himself lucky in being permitted to\r\nenjoy such handsome apartments at St. James’s, and so fine a park at\r\nWindsor.\r\n\r\nThus the opinions of Bute and those of Grenville were diametrically\r\nopposed. Nor was there any private friendship between the two statesmen.\r\nGrenville’s nature was not forgiving; and he well remembered how, a few\r\nmonths before, he had been compelled to yield the lead of the House of\r\nCommons to Fox.\r\n\r\nWe are inclined to think, on the whole, that the worst administration\r\nwhich has governed England since the Revolution was that of George\r\nGrenville. His public acts may be classed under two heads, outrages on\r\nthe liberty of the people, and outrages on the dignity of the crown.\r\n\r\nHe began by making war on the press. John Wilkes, member of Parliament\r\nfor Aylesbury, was singled out {56}for persecution. Wilkes had, till\r\nvery lately, been known chiefly as one of the most profane, licentious,\r\nand agreeable rakes about town. He was a man of taste, reading, and\r\nengaging manners. His sprightly conversation was the delight of\r\ngreen rooms and taverns, and pleased even grave hearers when he was\r\nsufficiently under restraint to abstain from detailing the particulars\r\nof his amours, and from breaking jests on the New Testament. His\r\nexpensive debaucheries forced him to have recourse to the Jews. He\r\nwas soon a ruined man, and determined to try his chance as a political\r\nadventurer. In parliament he did not succeed. His speaking, though pert,\r\nwas feeble, and by no means interested his hearers so much as to make\r\nthem forget his face, which was so hideous that the caricaturists were\r\nforced, in their own despite, to flatter him. As a writer, he made a\r\nbetter figure. He set up a weekly paper, called the North Briton.\r\nThis journal, written with some pleasantry, and great, audacity and\r\nimpudence, had a considerable number of readers. Forty-four numbers had\r\nbeen published when Bute resigned; and, though almost every number had\r\ncontained matter grossly libellous, no prosecution had been instituted.\r\nThe forty-fifth number was innocent when compared with the majority of\r\nthose which had preceded it, and indeed contained nothing so strong as\r\nmay in our time be found daily in the leading articles of the Times and\r\nMorning Chronicle. But Grenville was now at the head of affairs. A new\r\nspirit had been infused into the administration. Authority was to be\r\nupheld. The government was no longer to be braved with impunity.\r\nWilkes was arrested under a general warrant, conveyed to the Tower, and\r\nconfined there with circumstances of unusual severity. His papers were\r\n{57}seized, and carried to the Secretary of State. These harsh and\r\nillegal measures produced a violent outbreak of popular rage, which\r\nwas soon changed to delight and exultation. The arrest was pronounced\r\nunlawful by the Court of Common Pleas, in which Chief Justice Pratt\r\npresided, and the prisoner was discharged. This victory over the\r\ngovernment was celebrated with enthusiasm both in London and in the\r\ncider counties.\r\n\r\nWhile the ministers were daily becoming more odious to the nation, they\r\nwere doing their best to make themselves also odious to the court. They\r\ngave the King plainly to understand that they were determined not to\r\nbe Lord Bute’s creatures, and exacted a promise that no secret adviser\r\nshould have access to the royal ear. They soon found reason to suspect\r\nthat this promise had not been observed. They remonstrated in terms less\r\nrespectful than their master had been accustomed to hear, and gave him a\r\nfortnight to make his choice between his favourite and his cabinet.\r\n\r\nGeorge the Third was greatly disturbed. He had but a few weeks before\r\nexulted in his deliverance from the yoke of the great Whig connection.\r\nHe had even declared that his honour would not permit him ever again to\r\nadmit the members of that connection into his service. He now found that\r\nhe had only exchanged one set of masters for another set still harsher\r\nand more imperious. In his distress he thought on Pitt. From Pitt it was\r\npossible that better terms might be obtained than either from Grenville,\r\nor from the party of which Newcastle was the head.\r\n\r\nGrenville, on his return from an excursion into the country, repaired to\r\nBuckingham House. He was astonished to find at the entrance a chair, the\r\nshape of which {58}was well known to him, and indeed to all London. It\r\nwas distinguished by a large boot, made for the purpose of accommodating\r\nthe great Commoner’s gouty leg. Grenville guessed the whole. His\r\nbrother-in-law was closeted with the King. Bute, provoked by what he\r\nconsidered as the unfriendly and ungrateful conduct of his successors,\r\nhad himself proposed that Pitt should be summoned to the palace.\r\n\r\nPitt had two audiences on two successive days. What passed at the first\r\ninterview led him to expect that the negotiation would be brought to a\r\nsatisfactory close; but on the morrow he found the King less complying.\r\nThe best account, indeed the only trustworthy account of the conference,\r\nis that which was taken from Pitt’s own mouth by Lord Hardwicke. It\r\nappears that Pitt strongly represented the importance of conciliating\r\nthose chiefs of the Whig party who had been so unhappy as to incur the\r\nroyal displeasure. They had, he said, been the most constant friends of\r\nthe House of Hanover. Their power was great; they had been long versed\r\nin public business. If they were to be under sentence of exclusion, a\r\nsolid administration could not be formed. His Majesty could not bear to\r\nthink of putting himself into the hands of those whom he had recently\r\nchased from his court with the strongest marks of anger. “I am sorry,\r\nMr. Pitt,” he said, “but I see this will not do. My honour is concerned.\r\nI must support my honour.” How his Majesty succeeded in supporting his\r\nhonour, we shall soon see.\r\n\r\nPitt retired, and the King was reduced to request the ministers, whom he\r\nhad been on the point of discarding to remain in office. During the\r\ntwo years which followed, Grenville, now closely leagued with the\r\n{59}Bedfords, was the master of the court; and a hard master he proved.\r\nHe knew that he was kept in place only because there was no choice\r\nexcept between himself and the Whigs. That under any circumstances the\r\nWhigs would be forgiven, he thought impossible. The late attempt to get\r\nrid of him had roused his resentment; the failure of that attempt had\r\nliberated him from all fear. He had never been very courtly. He now\r\nbegun to hold a language, to which, since the days of Cornet Joyce and\r\nPresident Bradshaw, no English King had been compelled to listen.\r\n\r\nIn one matter, indeed, Grenville, at the expense of justice and liberty,\r\ngratified the passions of the court while gratifying his own. The\r\npersecution of Wilkes was eagerly pressed. He had written a parody on\r\nPope’s Essay on Man, entitled the Essay on Woman, and had appended to it\r\nnotes, in ridicule of Waburton’s famous Commentary. This composition was\r\nexceedingly profligate, but not more so, we think, than some of Pope’s\r\nown works, the imitation of the second satire of the first book of\r\nHorace, for example; and, to do Wilkes justice, he had not, like Pope,\r\ngiven his ribaldry to the world. He had merely printed at a private\r\npress a very small number of copies, which he meant to present to some\r\nof his boon companions, whose morals were in no more danger of being\r\ncorrupted by a loose book than a negro of being tanned by a warm sun.\r\nA tool of the government, by giving a bribe to the printer, procured\r\na copy of this trash, and placed it in the hands of the ministers. The\r\nministers resolved to visit Wilkes’s offence against decorum with the\r\nutmost rigour of the law. What share piety and respect for morals had in\r\ndictating this resolution, our readers may judge from the fact that no\r\nperson was more {60}eager for bringing the libertine poet to punishment\r\nthan Lord March, afterwards Duke of Queensberry.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the session of Parliament, the book, thus\r\ndisgracefully obtained, was laid on the table of the Lords by the Earl\r\nof Sandwich, whom the Duke of Bedford’s interest had made Secretary of\r\nState. The unfortunate author had not the slightest suspicion that his\r\nlicentious poem had ever been seen, except by his printer and by a few\r\nof his dissipated companions, till it was produced in full Parliament.\r\nThough he was a man of easy temper, averse from danger, and not very\r\nsusceptible of shame, the surprise, the disgrace, the prospect of utter\r\nruin, put him beside himself. He picked a quarrel with one of Lord\r\nBute’s dependents, fought a duel, was seriously wounded, and when half\r\nrecovered, fled to France. His enemies had now their own way both in the\r\nParliament and in the King’s Bench. He was censured, expelled from the\r\nHouse of Commons, outlawed. His works were ordered to be burned by the\r\ncommon hangman. Yet was the multitude still true to him. In the minds\r\neven of many moral and religious men, his crime seemed light when\r\ncompared with the crime of his accusers. The conduct of Sandwich, in\r\nparticular, excited universal disgust. His own vices were notorious;\r\nand, only a fortnight before he laid the Essay on Woman before the House\r\nof Lords, he had been drinking and singing loose catches with Wilkes at\r\none of the most dissolute clubs in London. Shortly after the meeting of\r\nParliament, the Beggar’s Opera was acted at Covent Garden theatre. When\r\nMacheath uttered the words--“That Jemmy Twitcher should peach me I\r\nown surprised me,”--pit, boxes, and galleries, burst into a roar which\r\nseemed likely to bring the roof down.\r\n\r\nFrom {61}that day Sandwich was universally known by the nickname of\r\nJemmy Twitcher. The ceremony of burning the North Briton was interrupted\r\nby a riot. The constables were beaten; the paper was rescued; and,\r\ninstead of it, a jack boot and a petticoat were committed to the flames.\r\nWilkes had instituted an action for the seizure of his papers against\r\nthe Undersecretary of State. The jury gave a thousand pounds damages.\r\nBut neither these nor any other indications of public feeling had power\r\nto move Grenville. He had the Parliament with him: and, according to his\r\npolitical creed, the sense of the nation was to be collected from the\r\nParliament alone.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, he found reason to fear that even the Parliament might\r\nfail him. On the question of the legality of general warrants, the\r\nOpposition, having on its side all sound principles, all constitutional\r\nauthorities, and the voice of the whole nation, mustered in great\r\nforce, and was joined by many who did not ordinarily vote against the\r\ngovernment. On one occasion the ministry, in a very full House, had\r\na majority of only fourteen votes. The storm, however, blew over. The\r\nspirit of the Opposition, from whatever cause, began to flag at the\r\nmoment when success seemed almost certain. The session ended without any\r\nchange. Pitt, whose eloquence had shone with its usual lustre in all the\r\nprincipal debates, and whose popularity was greater than ever, was still\r\na private man. Grenville, detested alike by the court and by the people,\r\nwas still minister.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Houses had risen, Grenville took a step which proved,\r\neven more signally than any of his past acts, how despotic, how\r\nacrimonious, and how fearless his nature was. Among the gentlemen\r\nnot ordinarily {62}opposed to the government, who, on the great\r\nconstitutional question of general variants, had voted with the\r\nminority was Henry Conway, brother of the Earl of Hertford, a brave\r\nsoldier, a tolerable speaker, and a well-meaning, though not a wise or\r\nvigorous politician, he was now deprived of his regiment, the merited\r\nreward of faithful and gallant service in two wars. It was confidently\r\nasserted that in this violent measure the King heartily concurred.\r\n\r\nBut whatever pleasure the persecution of Wilkes, or the dismissal\r\nof Conway, may have given to the royal mind, it is certain that his\r\nMajesty’s aversion to his ministers increased day by day. Grenville was\r\nas frugal of the public money as of his own, and morosely refused\r\nto accede to the King’s request, that a few thousand pounds might\r\nbe expended in buying some open fields to the west of the gardens of\r\nBuckingham House. In consequence of this refusal, the fields were soon\r\ncovered with buildings, and the King and Queen were overlooked in their\r\nmost private walks by the upper windows of a hundred houses. Nor was\r\nthis the worst. Grenville was as liberal of words as he was sparing\r\nof guineas. Instead of explaining himself in that clear, concise, and\r\nlively manner, which alone could win the attention of a young mind new\r\nto business, he spoke in the closet just as he spoke in the House of\r\nCommons. When he had harangued two hours, he looked at his watch, as\r\nhe had been in the habit of looking at the clock opposite the Speaker’s\r\nchair, apologised for the length of his discourse, and then went on for\r\nan hour more. The members of the House of Commons can cough an orator\r\ndown, or can walk away to dinner; and they were by no means sparing in\r\nthe use of these privileges when Grenville was {63}on his legs. But the\r\npoor young King had to endure all this eloquence with mournful civility.\r\nTo the end of his life he continued to talk with horror of Grenville’s\r\norations.\r\n\r\nAbout this time took place one of the most singular events in Pitt’s\r\nlife. There was a certain Sir William Pynsent, a Somersetshire baronet\r\nof Whig politics, who had been a Member of the House of Commons in\r\nthe days of Queen Anne, and had retired to rural privacy when the Tory\r\nparty, towards the end of her reign, obtained the ascendency in her\r\ncouncils. His manners were eccentric. His morals lay under very odious\r\nimputations. But his fidelity to his political opinions was unalterable.\r\nDuring fifty years of seclusion he continued to brood over the\r\ncircumstances which had driven him from public life, the dismissal of\r\nthe Whigs, the peace of Utrecht, the desertion of our allies. He now\r\nthought that he perceived a close analogy between the well remembered\r\nevents of his youth and the events which he had witnessed in extreme\r\nold age; between the disgrace of Marlborough and the disgrace of Pitt;\r\nbetween the elevation of Harley and the elevation of Bute; between the\r\ntreaty negotiated by St. John and the treaty negotiated by Bedford;\r\nbetween the wrongs of the House of Austria in 1712 and the wrongs of the\r\nHouse of Brandenburgh in 1762.\r\n\r\nThis fancy took such possession of the old man’s mind that he determined\r\nto leave his whole property to Pitt. In this way Pitt unexpectedly came\r\ninto possession of near three thousand pounds a year. Nor could all the\r\nmalice of his enemies find any ground for reproach in the transaction.\r\nNobody could call him a legacy hunter. Nobody could accuse him of\r\nseizing that to which others had a better claim.\r\n\r\nFor {64}he had never in his life seen Sir William; and Sir William had\r\nleft no relation so near as to be entitled to form any expectations\r\nrespecting the estate.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of Pitt seemed to flourish; but his health was worse than\r\never. We cannot find that, during the session which began in January\r\n1760, he once appeared in parliament. He remained some months in\r\nprofound retirement at Hayes, his favourite villa, scarcely moving\r\nexcept from his armchair to his bed, and from his bed to his armchair,\r\nand often employing his wife as his amanuensis in his most confidential\r\ncorrespondence. Some of his detractors whispered that his invisibility\r\nwas to be ascribed quite as much to affectation as to gout. In truth his\r\ncharacter, high and splendid as it was, wanted simplicity. With genius\r\nwhich did not need the aid of stage tricks, and with a spirit which\r\nshould have been far above them, he had yet been, through life, in the\r\nhabit of practising them. It was, therefore, now surmised that, having\r\nacquired all the consideration which could be derived from eloquence and\r\nfrom great services to the state, he had determined not to make himself\r\ncheap by often appearing in public, but, under the pretext of ill\r\nhealth, to surround himself with mystery, to emerge only at long\r\nintervals and on momentous occasions, and at other times to deliver\r\nhis oracles only to a few favoured votaries, who were suffered to make\r\npilgrimages to his shrine. If such were his object, it was for a time\r\nfully attained. Never was the magic of his name so powerful, never was\r\nhe regarded by his country with such superstitious veneration, as during\r\nthis year of silence and seclusion.\r\n\r\nWhile Pitt was thus absent from Parliament, Grenville proposed a measure\r\ndestined to produce a great revolution, {65}the effects of which will\r\nlong be felt by the whole human race. We speak of the act for imposing\r\nstamp duties on the North American colonies. The plan was eminently\r\ncharacteristic of its author. Every feature of the parent was found in\r\nthe child. A timid statesman would have shrunk from a step, of which\r\nWalpole, at a time when the colonies were far less powerful, had\r\nsaid--“He who shall propose it will be a much bolder man than I.” But\r\nthe nature of Grenville was insensible to fear. A statesman of large\r\nviews would have felt that to lay taxes at Westminster on New England\r\nand New York, was a course opposed, not indeed to the letter of the\r\nStatute Book, or to any decision contained in the Term Reports, but\r\nto the principles of good government, and to the spirit of the\r\nconstitution. A statesman of large views would also have felt, that\r\nten times the estimated produce of the American stamps would have been\r\ndearly purchased by even a transient quarrel between the mother country\r\nand the colonies. But Grenville knew of no spirit of the constitution\r\ndistinct from the letter of the law, and of no national interests except\r\nthose which are expressed by pounds, shillings, and pence. That his\r\npolicy might give birth to deep discontents in all the provinces, from\r\nthe shore of the Great Lakes to the Mexican sea; that France and\r\nSpain might seize the opportunity of revenge; that the empire might\r\nbe dismembered; that the debt, that debt with the amount of which he\r\nperpetually reproached Pitt, might, in consequence of his own policy,\r\nbe doubled; these were possibilities which never occurred to that small,\r\nsharp mind.\r\n\r\nThe Stamp Act will be remembered as long as the globe lasts. But, at\r\nthe time, it attracted much less notice in this country than another Act\r\nwhich is now almost {66}utterly forgotten. The King fell ill, and was\r\nthought to be in a dangerous state. His complaint, we believe, was the\r\nsame which, at a later period, repeatedly incapacitated him for the\r\nperformance of his regal functions. The heir apparent was only two years\r\nold. It was clearly proper to make provision for the administration of\r\nthe government, in case of a minority. The discussions on this point\r\nbrought the quarrel between the court and the ministry to a crisis. The\r\nKing wished to be intrusted with the power of naming a regent by will.\r\nThe ministers feared, or affected to fear, that, if this power were\r\nconceded to him, he would name the Princess Mother, nay, possibly the\r\nEarl of Bute. They, therefore, insisted on introducing into the bill\r\nwords confining the King’s choice to the royal family. Having thus\r\nexcluded Bute, they urged the King to let them, in the most marked\r\nmanner, exclude the Princess Dowager also. They assured him that the\r\nHouse of Commons would undoubtedly strike her name out, and by this\r\nthreat they wrung from him a reluctant assent. In a few days, it\r\nappeared that the representations by which they had induced the King\r\nto put this gross and public affront on his mother were unfounded. The\r\nfriends of the Princess in the House of Commons moved that her name\r\nshould be inserted. The ministers could not decently attack the parent\r\nof their master. They hoped that the Opposition would come to their\r\nhelp, and put on them a force to which they would gladly have yielded.\r\nBut the majority of the Opposition, though hating the Princess, hated\r\nGrenville more, beheld his embarrassment with delight, and would do\r\nnothing to extricate him from it. The Princess’s name was accordingly\r\nplaced in the list of persons qualified to hold the regency.\r\n\r\nThe {67}King’s resentment was now at the height. The present evil seemed\r\nto him more intolerable than any other. Even the junta of Whig grandees\r\ncould not treat him worse than he had been treated by his present\r\nministers. In his distress, he poured out his whole heart to his uncle,\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland. The Duke was not a man to be loved; but he\r\nwas eminently a man to be trusted. He had an intrepid temper, a strong\r\nunderstanding, and a high sense of honour and duty. As a general, he\r\nbelonged to a remarkable class of captains, captains, we mean, whose\r\nfate it has been to lose almost all the battles which they have fought,\r\nand yet to be reputed stout and skilful soldiers. Such captains were\r\nColigni and William the Third. We might, perhaps, add Marshal Soult\r\nto the list. The bravery of the Duke of Cumberland was such as\r\ndistinguished him even among the princes of his brave house. The\r\nindifference with which he rode about amidst musket balls and cannon\r\nballs was not the highest proof of his fortitude. Hopeless maladies,\r\nhorrible surgical operations, far from unmanning him, did not even\r\ndiscompose him. With courage, he had the virtues which are akin to\r\ncourage. He spoke the truth, was open in enmity and friendship, and\r\nupright in all his dealings. But his nature was hard; and what seemed\r\nto him justice was rarely tempered with mercy. He was, therefore, during\r\nmany years one of the most unpopular men in England. The severity with\r\nwhich he had treated the rebels after the battle of Culloden, had gained\r\nfor him the name of the Butcher. His attempts to introduce into the army\r\nof England, then in a most disorderly state, the rigorous discipline of\r\nPotsdam, had excited still stronger disgust. Nothing was too bad to be\r\nbelieved of him. Many honest people were {68}so absurd as to fancy that,\r\nif he were left Regent during the minority of his nephews, there would\r\nbe another smothering in the Tower. These feelings, however, had passed\r\naway. The Duke had been living, during some years, in retirement. The\r\nEnglish, full of animosity against the Scots, now blamed his Royal\r\nHighness only for having left so many Camerons and Macphersons to be\r\nmade gaugers and customhouse officers. He was, therefore, at present,\r\na favourite with his countrymen, and especially with the inhabitants of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nHe had little reason to love the King, and had shown clearly, though not\r\nobtrusively, his dislike of the system which had lately been pursued.\r\nBut he had high and almost romantic notions of the duty which, as a\r\nprince of the blood, he owed to the head of his house. He determined\r\nto extricate his nephew from bondage, and to effect a reconciliation\r\nbetween the Whig party and the throne, on terms honourable to both.\r\n\r\nIn this mind he set off for Hayes, and was admitted to Pitt’s sick room;\r\nfor Pitt would not leave his chamber, and would not communicate with any\r\nmessenger of inferior dignity. And now began a long series of errors on\r\nthe part of the illustrious statesman, errors which involved his country\r\nin difficulties and distresses more serious even than those from\r\nwhich his genius had formerly rescued her. His language was haughty,\r\nunreasonable, almost unintelligible. The only thing which could be\r\ndiscerned through a cloud of vague and not very gracious phrases, was\r\nthat he would not at that moment take office. The truth, we believe,\r\nwas this. Lord Temple, who was Pitt’s evil genius, had just formed a\r\nnew scheme of politics. Hatred of Bute and {69}of the Princess had, it\r\nshould seem, taken entire possession of Temple’s soul. He had quarrelled\r\nwith his brother George, because George had been connected with Bute and\r\nthe Princess. Now that George appeared to be the enemy of Bute and\r\nof the Princess, Temple was eager to bring about a general family\r\nreconciliation. The three brothers, as Temple, Grenville, and Pitt, were\r\npopularly called, might make a ministry, without leaning for aid either\r\non Bute or on the Whig connection. With such views, Temple used all his\r\ninfluence to dissuade Pitt from acceding to the propositions of the Duke\r\nof Cumberland. Pitt was not convinced. But Temple had an influence\r\nover him such as no other person had ever possessed. They were very old\r\nfriends, very near relations. If Pitt’s talents and fame had been useful\r\nto Temple, Temple’s purse had formerly, in times of great need, been\r\nuseful to Pitt. They had never been parted in politics. Twice they had\r\ncome into the cabinet together; twice they had left it together. Pitt\r\ncould not bear to think of taking office without his chief ally. Yet\r\nhe felt that he was doing wrong, that he was throwing away a great\r\nopportunity of serving his country. The obscure and unconciliatory\r\nstyle of the answers which he returned to the overtures of the Duke of\r\nCumberland, may be ascribed to the embarrassment and vexation of a mind\r\nnot at peace with itself. It is said that he mournfully exclaimed to\r\nTemple,\r\n\r\n               “Extinxti te meque, soror, populumque, putresque\r\n\r\n               Siclonios, urbemque tuam.”\r\n\r\nThe prediction was but too just.\r\n\r\nFinding Pitt impracticable, the Duke of Cumberland advised the King to\r\nsubmit to necessity, and to keep Grenville and the Bedfords. It was,\r\nindeed, not a {70}time at which offices could safely be left vacant.\r\nThe unsettled state of the government had produced a general relaxation\r\nthrough all the departments of the public service. Meetings, which at\r\nanother time would have been harmless, now turned to riots, and rapidly\r\nrose almost to the dignity of rebellions. The Houses of Parliament were\r\nblockaded by the Spitalfields weavers.\r\n\r\nBedford House was assailed on all sides by a furious rabble, and was\r\nstrongly garrisoned with horse and foot. Some people attributed these\r\ndisturbances to the friends of Bute, and some to the friends of Wilkes.\r\nBut, whatever might be the cause, the effect was general insecurity.\r\nUnder such circumstances the King had no choice. With bitter feelings of\r\nmortification, he informed the ministers that he meant to retain them.\r\n\r\nThey answered by demanding from him a promise on his royal word never\r\nmore to consult Lord Bute.\r\n\r\nThe promise was given. They then demanded something more. Lord Bute’s\r\nbrother, Mr. Mackenzie, held a lucrative office in Scotland. Mr.\r\nMackenzie must be dismissed. The King replied that the office had been\r\ngiven under very peculiar circumstances, and that he had promised never\r\nto take it away while he lived. Grenville was obstinate; and the King,\r\nwith a very bad grace, yielded.\r\n\r\nThe session of Parliament was over. The triumph of the ministers was\r\ncomplete. The King was almost as much a prisoner as Charles the First\r\nhad been, when in the Isle of Wight. Such were the fruits of the policy\r\nwhich, only a few months before, was represented as having for ever\r\nsecured the throne against the dictation of insolent subjects.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty’s natural resentment showed itself in every {71}look and\r\nword. In his extremity he looked wistfully towards that Whig connection,\r\nonce the object of his dread and hatred. The Duke of Devonshire, who had\r\nbeen treated with such unjustifiable harshness, had lately died, and had\r\nbeen succeeded by his son, who was still a boy. The King condescended to\r\nexpress his regret for what had passed, and to invite the young Duke to\r\ncourt. The noble youth came, attended by his uncles, and was received\r\nwith marked graciousness.\r\n\r\nThis and many other symptoms of the same kind irritated the ministers.\r\nThey had still in store for their sovereign an insult which would have\r\nprovoked his grandfather to kick them out of the room. Grenville and\r\nBedford demanded an audience of him, and read him a remonstrance of many\r\npages, which they had drawn up with great care. His Majesty was\r\naccused of breaking his word, and of treating his advisers with\r\ngross unfairness. The Princess was mentioned in language by no means\r\neulogistic. Hints were thrown out that Bute’s head was in danger. The\r\nKing was plainly told that he must not continue to show, as he had done,\r\nthat he disliked the situation in which he was placed, that he must\r\nfrown upon the Opposition, that he must carry it fair towards his\r\nministers in public. He several times interrupted the reading, by\r\ndeclaring that he had ceased to hold any communication with Bute. But\r\nthe ministers, disregarding his denial, went on; and the King listened\r\nin silence, almost choked by rage. When they ceased to read, he merely\r\nmade a gesture expressive of his wish to be left alone. He afterwards\r\nowned that he thought he should have gone into a fit.\r\n\r\nDriven to despair, he again had recourse to the Duke of {72}Cumberland;\r\nand the Duke of Cumberland again had recourse to Pitt. Pitt was really\r\ndesirous to undertake the direction of affairs, and owned, with many\r\ndutiful expressions, that the terms offered by the King were all that\r\nany subject could desire. But Temple was impracticable; and Pitt, with\r\ngreat regret, declared that he could not, without the concurrence of his\r\nbrother-in-law, undertake the administration.\r\n\r\nThe Duke now saw only one way of delivering his nephew. An\r\nadministration must be formed of the Whigs in opposition, without Pitt’s\r\nhelp. The difficulties seemed almost insuperable. Death and desertion\r\nhad grievously thinned the ranks of the party lately supreme in the\r\nstate. Those among whom the Duke’s choice lay might be divided into two\r\nclasses, nun too old for important offices, and men who had never been\r\nin any important office before. The cabinet must be composed of broken\r\ninvalids or of raw recruits.\r\n\r\nThis was an evil, yet not an unmixed evil. If the new Whig statesmen had\r\nlittle experience in business and debate, they were, on the other\r\nhand, pure from the taint of that political immorality which had deeply\r\ninfected their predecessors. Long prosperity had corrupted that great\r\nparty which had expelled the Stuarts, limited the prerogatives of\r\nthe Crown, and curbed the intolerance of the Hierarchy. Adversity had\r\nalready produced a salutary effect. On the dav of the accession of\r\nGeorge the Third, the ascendency of the Whig party terminated; and on\r\nthat day the purification of the Whig party began. The rising chiefs of\r\nthat party were men of a very different sort from Sandys and Wilmington,\r\nfrom Sir William Yonge and Henry Fox. They were men worthy to have\r\ncharged by the side of Hampden {73}at Chalgrove, or to have exchanged\r\nthe last embrace with Russell on the scaffold in Lincoln’s Inn Fields.\r\nThey carried into politics the same high principles of virtue which\r\nregulated their private dealings, nor would they stoop to promote even\r\nthe noblest and most salutary ends by means which honour and probity\r\ncondemn. Such men were Lord John Cavendish, Sir George Savile, and\r\nothers whom we hold in honour as the second founders of the Whig party,\r\nas the restorers of its pristine health and energy after half a century\r\nof degeneracy.\r\n\r\nThe chief of this respectable band was the Marquess of Rockingham, a man\r\nof splendid fortune, excellent sense, and stainless character. He was\r\nindeed nervous to such a degree that, to the very close of his life,\r\nhe never rose without great reluctance and embarrassment to address the\r\nHouse of Lords. But, though not a great orator, he had in a high degree\r\nsome of the qualities of a statesman. He chose his friends well; and\r\nhe had, in an extraordinary degree, the art of attaching them to him by\r\nties of the most honourable kind. The cheerful fidelity with which they\r\nadhered to him through many years of almost hopeless opposition was less\r\nadmirable than the disinterestedness and delicacy which they showed when\r\nhe rose to power.\r\n\r\nWe are inclined to think that the use and the abuse of party cannot be\r\nbetter illustrated than by a parallel between two powerful connections\r\nof that time, the Rockinghams and the Bedfords. The Rockingham party\r\nwas, in our view, exactly what a party should be. It consisted of men\r\nbound together by common opinions, by common public objects, by mutual\r\nesteem. That they desired to obtain, by honest and constitutional means,\r\nthe direction of affairs they openly avowed. {74}But, though often\r\ninvited to accept the hon-oui’s and emoluments of office, they steadily\r\nrefused to do so on any conditions inconsistent with their principles.\r\nThe Bedford party, as a party, had, as far as we can discover, no\r\nprinciple whatever. Rigby and Sandwich wanted public money, and\r\nthought that they should fetch a higher price jointly than singly. They\r\ntherefore acted in concert, and prevailed on a much more important and a\r\nmuch better man than themselves to act with them.\r\n\r\nIt was to Rockingham that the Duke of Cumberland now had recourse.\r\nThe Marquess consented to take the treasury. Newcastle, so long the\r\nrecognized chief of the Whigs, could not well be excluded from the\r\nministry. He was appointed keeper of the privy seal. A very honest\r\nclear-headed country gentleman, of the name of Dowdeswell, became\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer. General Conway, who had served under the\r\nDuke of Cumberland, and was strongly attached to his royal highness, was\r\nmade Secretary of State, with the lead in the House of Commons. A great\r\nWhig nobleman, in the prime of manhood, from whom much was at that time\r\nexpected, Augustus Duke of Grafton, was the other Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe oldest man living could remember no government so weak in oratorical\r\ntalents and in official experience. The general opinion was, that the\r\nministers might hold office during the recess, but that the first day\r\nof debate in Parliament would be the last day of their power. Charles\r\nTownshend was asked what he thought of the new administration. “It is,”\r\n said he, “mere lutestring; pretty summer wear. It will never do for the\r\nwinter.”\r\n\r\nAt this conjuncture Lord Rockingham had the wisdom {75}to discern the\r\nvalue, and secure the aid, of an ally, who, to eloquence surpassing\r\nthe eloquence of Pitt, and to industry which shamed the industry of\r\nGrenville, united an amplitude of comprehension to which neither Pitt\r\nnor Grenville could lay claim. A young Irishman had, some time before,\r\ncome over to push his fortune in London. He had written much for the\r\nbooksellers; but he was best known by a little treatise, in which the\r\nstyle and reasoning of Bolingbroke were mimicked with exquisite\r\nskill, and by a theory, of more ingenuity than soundness, touching\r\nthe pleasures which we receive from the objects of taste. He had also\r\nattained a high reputation as a talker, and was regarded by the men\r\nof letters who supped together at the Turk’s Head as the only match in\r\nconversation for Dr. Johnson. He now became private secretary to Lord\r\nRockingham, and was brought into Parliament by his patron’s influence.\r\nThese arrangements, indeed, were not made without some difficulty. The\r\nDuke of Newcastle, who was always meddling and chattering, adjured the\r\nfirst lord of the treasury to be on his guard against this adventurer,\r\nwhose real name was O’Rourke, and whom his grace knew to be a wild\r\nIrishman, a Jacobite, a Papist, a concealed Jesuit. Lord Rockingham\r\ntreated the calumny as it deserved; and the Whig party was strengthened\r\nand adorned by the accession of Edmund Burke.\r\n\r\nThe party, indeed, stood in need of accessions; for it sustained about\r\nthis time an almost irreparable loss. The Duke of Cumberland had formed\r\nthe government, and was its main support. His exalted rank and great\r\nname in some degree balanced the fame of Pitt. As mediator between the\r\nWhigs and the Court, he held a place {76}which no other person could\r\nfill. The strength of his character supplied that which was the chief\r\ndefect of the new ministry. Conway, in particular, who, with excellent\r\nintentions and respectable talents, was the most dependent, and\r\nirresolute of human bennes, drew from the counsels of that masculine\r\nmind a determination not his own. Before the meeting of Parliament the\r\nDuke suddenly died. His death was generally regarded as the signal of\r\ngreat troubles, and on this account, as well as from respect for his\r\npersonal qualities, was greatly lamented. It was remarked that the\r\nmourning in London was the most general ever known, and wars both deeper\r\nand longer than the Gazette had prescribed.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, every mail from America brought alarming tidings.\r\nThe crop which Grenville had sown his successors had now to reap. The\r\ncolonies were in a state bordering on rebellion. The stamps were burned.\r\nThe revenue officers were tarred and feathered. All traffic between\r\nthe discontented provinces and the mother country was interrupted.\r\nThe Exchange of London was in dismay. Half the firms of Bristol and\r\nLiverpool were threatened with bankruptcy. In Leeds, Manchester,\r\nNottingham, it was said that three artisans out of every ten had been\r\nturned adrift. Civil war seemed to be at hand; and it could not be\r\ndoubted that, if once the British nation were divided against itself,\r\nFrance and Spain would soon take part in the quarrel.\r\n\r\nThree courses were open to the ministers. The first was to enforce\r\nthe Stamp Act by the sword. This was the course on which the King, and\r\nGrenville, whom the King hated beyond all living men, were alike bent.\r\nThe natures of both were arbitrary and stubborn. {77}They resembled each\r\nother so much that they could never be friends; but they resembled\r\neach other also so much that they saw almost all important practical\r\nquestions in the same point of view. Neither of them would bear to be\r\ngoverned by the other; but they were perfectly agreed as to the best way\r\nof governing the people.\r\n\r\nAnother course was that which Pitt recommended. He held that the British\r\nParliament was not constitutionally competent to pass a law for taxing\r\nthe colonies. He therefore considered the Stamp Act as a nullity, as\r\na document of no more validity than Charles’s writ of shipmoney, or\r\nJames’s proclamation dispensing with the penal laws. This doctrine seems\r\nto us, we must own, to be altogether untenable.\r\n\r\nBetween these extreme courses lay a third way. The opinion of the most\r\njudicious and temperate statesmen of those times was that the British\r\nconstitution had set no limit whatever to the legislative power of\r\nthe British King, Lords, and Commons, over the whole British Empire.\r\nParliament, they held, was legally competent to tax America, as\r\nParliament was legally competent to commit any other act of folly or\r\nwickedness, to confiscate the property of all the merchants in Lombard\r\nStreet, or to attaint any man in the kingdom of high treason, without\r\nexamining witnesses against him, or hearing him in his own defence. The\r\nmost atrocious act of confiscation or of attainder is just as valid an\r\nact as the Toleration Act or the Habeas Corpus Act. But from acts\r\nof confiscation and acts of attainder lawgivers are bound, by every\r\nobligation of morality, systematically to refrain. In the same manner\r\nought the British legislature to refrain from taxing the American\r\ncolonies. The Stamp Act {78}was indefensible, not because it was beyond\r\nthe constitutional competence of Parliament, but because it was unjust\r\nand impolitic, sterile of revenue, and fertile of discontents. These\r\nsound doctrines were adopted by Lord Rockingham and his colleagues, and\r\nwere, during a long course of years, inculcated by Burke, in orations,\r\nsome of which will last as long as the English language.\r\n\r\nThe winter came; the Parliament met; and the state of the colonies\r\ninstantly became the subject of fierce contention. Pitt, whose health\r\nhad been somewhat restored by the waters of Bath, reappeared in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and, with ardent and pathetic eloquence, not only\r\ncondemned the Stamp Act, but applauded the resistance of Massachusetts\r\nand Virginia, and vehemently maintained, in defiance, we must say,\r\nof all reason and of all authority, that, according to the British\r\nconstitution, the supreme legislative power does not include the power\r\nto tax. The language of Grenville, on the other hand, was such as\r\nStrafford might have used at the council table of Charles the First,\r\nwhen news came of the resistance to the liturgy at Edinburgh. The\r\ncolonists were traitors; those who excused them were little better.\r\nFrigates, mortars, bayonets, sabres, were the proper remedies for such\r\ndistempers.\r\n\r\nThe ministers occupied an intermediate position; they proposed to\r\ndeclare that the legislative authority of the British Parliament over\r\nthe whole Empire was in all cases supreme; and they proposed, at the\r\nsame time, to repeal the Stamp Act. To the former measure Pitt objected;\r\nbut it was carried with scarcely a dissentient voice. The repeal of\r\nthe Stamp Act Pitt strongly supported; but against the Government was\r\narrayed {79}a formidable assemblage of opponents. Grenville and the\r\nBedfords were furious. Temple, who had now allied himself closely with\r\nhis brother, and separated himself from Pitt, was no despicable enemy.\r\nThis, however, was not the worst. The ministry was without its natural\r\nstrength. It had to struggle, not only against its avowed enemies, but\r\nagainst the insidious hostility of the King, and of a set of persons\r\nwho, about this time, began to be designated as the King’s friends.\r\n\r\nThe character of this faction has been drawn by Burke with even more\r\nthan his usual force and vivacity. Those who know how strongly, through\r\nhis whole life, his judgment was biassed by his passions, may not\r\nunnaturally suspect that he has left us rather a caricature than a\r\nlikeness; and yet there is scarcely, in the whole portrait, a single\r\ntouch of which the fidelity is not proved by facts of unquestionable\r\nauthenticity.\r\n\r\nThe public generally regarded the King’s friends as a body of which Bute\r\nwas the directing soul. It was to no purpose that the Earl professed to\r\nhave done with politics, that he absented himself year after year from\r\nthe levee and the drawing-room, that he went to the north, that he went\r\nto Rome. The notion that, in some inexplicable manner, he dictated\r\nall the measures of the court, was fixed in the minds, not only of\r\nthe multitude, but of some who had good opportunities of obtaining\r\ninformation, and who ought to have been superior to vulgar prejudices.\r\nOur own belief is that these suspicions were unfounded, and that he\r\nceased to have any communication with the King on political matters some\r\ntime before the dismissal of George Grenville. The supposition of\r\nBute’s influence is, indeed, by {80}no means necessary to explain\r\nthe phænomena. The King in 1765, was no longer the ignorant and\r\ninexperienced boy who had, in 1760, been managed by his mother and his\r\nGroom of the Stole. He had, during several years, observed the struggles\r\nof parties, and conferred daily on high questions of state with able and\r\nexperienced politicians. His way of life had developed his understanding\r\nand character. He was now no longer a puppet, but had very decided\r\nopinions both of men and things. Nothing could be more natural than that\r\nhe should have high notions of his own prerogatives, should be impatient\r\nof opposition, and should wish all public men to be detached from each\r\nother and dependent on himself alone; nor could anything be more natural\r\nthan that, in the state in which the political world then was, he should\r\nfind instruments fit for his purposes.\r\n\r\nThus sprang into existence and into note a reptile species of\r\npoliticians never before and never since known in our country. These\r\nmen disclaimed all political ties, except those which bound them to the\r\nthrone. They were willing to coalesce with any party, to abandon any\r\nparty, to undermine any party, to assault any party, at a moment’s\r\nnotice. To them, all administrations, and all oppositions were the same.\r\nThey regarded Bute, Grenville, Rockingham, Pitt, without one sentiment\r\neither of predilection or of aversion. They were the Kings friends. It\r\nis to be observed that this friendship implied no personal intimacy.\r\nThese people had never lived with their master as Dodington at one time\r\nlived with his father, or as Sheridan afterwards lived with his son.\r\nThey never hunted with him in the morning, or played cards with him in\r\nthe evening, never shared his mutton or walked {81}with him among his\r\nturnips. Only one or two of them ever saw his face, except on public\r\ndays. The whole band, however, always had early and accurate information\r\nas to his personal inclinations. These people were never high in the\r\nadministration. They were generally to be found in places of much\r\nemolument, little labour, and no responsibility; and these places they\r\ncontinued to occupy securely while the cabinet was six or seven times\r\nreconstructed. Their peculiar business was not to support the ministry\r\nagainst the opposition, but to support the King against the ministry.\r\nWhenever his Majesty was induced to give a reluctant assent to the\r\nintroduction of some bill which his constitutional advisers regarded\r\nas necessary, his friends in the House of Commons were sure to speak\r\nagainst it, to vote against it, to throw in its way every obstruction\r\ncompatible with the forms of Parliament. If his Majesty found it\r\nnecessary to admit into his closet a Secretary of State or a First\r\nLord of the Treasury whom he disliked, his friends were sure to miss no\r\nopportunity of thwarting and humbling the obnoxious minister. In return\r\nfor these services, the King covered them with his protection. It was\r\nto no purpose that his responsible servants complained to him that they\r\nwere daily betrayed and impeded by men who were eating the bread of\r\nthe government. He sometimes justified the offenders, sometimes excused\r\nthem, sometimes owned that they were to blame, but said that he must\r\ntake time to consider whether he could part with them. He never would\r\nturn them out; and, while every thing else in the state was constantly\r\nchanging, these sycophants seemed to have a life estate in their\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nIt {82}was well known to the King’s friends that, though his Majesty had\r\nconsented to the repeal of Stamp Aet, he had consented with a very bad\r\ngrace, and that though he had eagerly welcomed the Whigs, when, in his\r\nextreme need and at his earnest entreaty, they had undertaken to free\r\nhim from an insupportable yoke, he had by no means got over his early\r\nprejudices against his deliverers. The ministers soon found that,\r\nwhile they were encountered in front by the whole force of a strong\r\nopposition, their rear was assailed by a large body of those whom they\r\nhad regarded as auxiliaries.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Lord Rockingham and his adherents went on resolutely with\r\nthe bill for repealing the Stamp Act. They had on their side all the\r\nmanufacturing and commercial interests of the realm. In the debates the\r\ngovernment was powerfully supported. Two great orators and statesmen,\r\nbelonging to two different generations, repeatedly put forth all their\r\npowers in defence of the bill. The House of Commons heard Pitt for the\r\nlast time, and Burke for the first time, and was in doubt to which of\r\nthem the palm of eloquence should be assigned. It was indeed a splendid\r\nsunset and a splendid dawn.\r\n\r\nFor a time the event seemed doubtful. In several divisions the ministers\r\nwere hard pressed. On one occasion, not less than twelve of the King’s\r\nfriends, all men in office, voted against the government. It was to no\r\npurpose that Lord Rockingham remonstrated with the King. His Majesty\r\nconfessed that there was ground for complaint, but hoped that gentle\r\nmeans would bring the mutineers to a better mind. If they persisted in\r\ntheir misconduct, he would dismiss them.\r\n\r\nAt length the decisive day arrived. The gallery, the lobby, the Court of\r\nRequests, the staircases, were crowded {83}with merchants from all the\r\ngreat ports of the island. The debate lasted till long after midnight.\r\nOn the division the ministers had a great majority. The dread of civil\r\nwar, and the outcry of all the trading towns of the kingdom, had been\r\ntoo strong for the combined strength of the court and the opposition.\r\n\r\nIt was in the first dim twilight of a February morning that the doors\r\nwere thrown open, and that the chiefs of the hostile parties showed\r\nthemselves to the multitude. Conway was received with loud applause.\r\nBut, when Pitt appeared, all eyes were fixed on him alone. All hats were\r\nin the air. Loud and long huzzas accompanied him to his chair, and a\r\ntrain of admirers escorted him all the way to his home. Then came forth\r\nGrenville. As soon as he was recognised, a storm of hisses and curses\r\nbroke forth. He turned fiercely on the crowd, and caught one man by the\r\nthroat. The bystanders were in great alarm. If a scuffle began, none\r\ncould say how it might end. Fortunately the person who had been collared\r\nonly said, “If I may not hiss, sir, I hope I may laugh,” and laughed in\r\nGrenville’s face.\r\n\r\nThe majority had been so decisive, that all the opponents of the\r\nministry, save one, were disposed to let the bill pass without any\r\nfurther contention. But solicitation and expostulation were thrown away\r\non Grenville.\r\n\r\nHis indomitable spirit rose up stronger and stronger under the load of\r\npublic hatred. He fought out the battle obstinately to the end. On the\r\nlast reading he had a sharp altercation with his brother-in-law, the\r\nlast of their many sharp altercations. Pitt thundered in his loftiest\r\ntones against the man who had wished to dip the ermine of a British King\r\nin the blood of the British people. Grenville replied with his wonted\r\nintrepidity {84}and asperity. “If the tax,”’ he said, “were still to\r\nbe laid on, I would lay it on. For the evils which it may produce my\r\naccuser is answerable. His profusion made it necessary. His declarations\r\nagainst the constitutional powers of Kings, Lords, and Commons, have\r\nmade it doubly necessary. I do not envy him the huzza. I glory in the\r\nhiss. If it were to be done again, I would do it.”\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Stamp Act was the chief measure of Lord Rockingham’s\r\ngovernment. But that government is entitled to the praise of having\r\nput a stop to two oppressive practices, which, in Wilkes’s case, had\r\nattracted the notice and excited the just indignation of the public.\r\nThe House of Commons was induced by the ministers to pass a resolution\r\ncondemning the use of general warrants, and another resolution\r\ncondemning the seizure of papers in cases of libel.\r\n\r\nIt must be added, to the lasting honour of Lord Rockingham, that his\r\nadministration was the first which, during a long course of years,\r\nhad the courage and the virtue to refrain from bribing members of\r\nParliament. His enemies accused him and his friends of weakness, of\r\nhaughtiness, of party spirit; but calumny itself never dared to couple\r\nhis name with corruption.\r\n\r\nUnhappily his government, though one of the best that has ever existed\r\nin our country, was also one of the weakest. The King’s friends assailed\r\nand obstructed the ministers at every turn. To appeal to the King was\r\nonly to draw forth new promises and new evasions. His Majesty was sure\r\nthat there must be some misunderstanding. Lord Rockingham had better\r\nspeak to the gentlemen. They should be dismissed on the next fault. The\r\nnext fault was soon committed, and his Majesty {85}still continued to\r\nshuffle. It was too bad. It was quite abominable; but it mattered less\r\nas the prorogation was at hand. He would give the delinquents one more\r\nchance. If they did not alter their conduct next session, he should not\r\nhave one word to say for them. He had already resolved that, long before\r\nthe commencement of the next session, Lord Rockingham should cease to be\r\nminister.\r\n\r\nWe have now come to a part of our story which, admiring as we do the\r\ngenius and the many noble qualities of Pitt, we cannot relate without\r\nmuch pain. We believe that, at this conjuncture, he had it in his power\r\nto give the victory either to the Whigs or to the King’s friends. If he\r\nhad allied himself closely with Lord Rockingham, what could the court\r\nhave done? There would have been only one alternative, the Whigs or\r\nGrenville; and there conld be no doubt what the King’s choice woidd be.\r\nHe still remembered, as well he might, with the uttermost bitterness,\r\nthe thraldom from which his uncle had freed him, and said about this\r\ntime, with great vehemence, that he would sooner see the Devil come into\r\nhis closet than Grenville.\r\n\r\nAnd what was there to prevent Pitt from allying himself with Lord\r\nRockingham? On all the most important questions their views were the\r\nsame. They had agreed in condemning the peace, the Stamp Act, the\r\ngeneral warrant, the seizure of papers. The points on which they\r\ndiffered were few and unimportant. In integrity, in disinterestedness,\r\nin hatred of corruption, they resembled each other. Their personal\r\ninterests could not clash. They sat in different Houses, and Pitt had\r\nalways declared that nothing should induce him to be first lord of the\r\ntreasury.\r\n\r\nIf the opportunity of forming a coalition beneficial to {86}the state,\r\nand honourable to all concerned, was suffered to escape, the fault\r\nwas not with the Whig ministers. They behaved towards Pitt with an\r\nobsequiousness which, had it not been the effect of sincere admiration\r\nand of anxiety for the public interests, might have been justly called\r\nservile. They repeatedly gave him to understand that, if he chose to\r\njoin their ranks, they were ready to receive him, not as an associate,\r\nbut as a leader. They had proved their respect for him by bestowing a\r\npeerage on the person who, at that time, enjoyed the largest share of\r\nhis confidence, Chief Justice Pratt. What then was there to divide Pitt\r\nfrom the Whigs? What, on the other hand, was there in common between him\r\nand the King’s friends, that he should lend himself to their purposes,\r\nhe who had never owed any thing to flattery or intrigue, he whose\r\neloquence and independent spirit had overawed two generations of slaves\r\nand jobbers, he who had twice been forced by the enthusiasm of an\r\nadmiring nation on a reluctant Prince?\r\n\r\nUnhappily the court had gained Pitt, not, it is true, by those ignoble\r\nmeans which were employed when such men as Rigby and Wedderburn were\r\nto be won, but by allurements suited to a nature noble even in its\r\naberrations. The King set himself to seduce the one man who could turn\r\nthe Whigs out without letting Grenville in. Praise, caresses, promises,\r\nwere lavished on the idol of the nation. He, and he alone, could put an\r\nend to fiction, could bid defiance to all the powerful connections\r\nin the land united, Whigs and Tories, Rockinghams, Bedfords, and\r\nGrenvilles. These blandishments produced a great effect. For though\r\nPitt’s spirit was high and manly, though his eloquence was often exerted\r\nwith formidable effect against the court, {87}and though his theory of\r\ngovernment had been learned in the school of Locke and Sydney, he had\r\nalways regarded the person of the sovereign with profound veneration.\r\nAs soon as he was brought face to face with royalty, his imagination and\r\nsensibility were too strong for his principles. His Whiggism thawed\r\nand disappeared; and he became, for the time, a Tory of the old Ormond\r\npattern. Nor was he by any means unwilling to assist in the work of\r\ndissolving all political connections. His own weight in the state was\r\nwholly independent of such connections. He was therefore inclined to\r\nlook on them with dislike, and made far too little distinction between\r\ngangs of knaves associated for the mere purpose of robbing the public,\r\nand confederacies of honourable men for the promotion of great public\r\nobjects. Nor had he the sagacity to perceive that the strenuous efforts\r\nwhich he made to annihilate all parties tended only to establish the\r\nascendency of one party, and that the basest and most hateful of all.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether he would have been thus misled, if his mind\r\nhad been in full health and vigour. But the truth is that he had for\r\nsome time been in an unnatural state of excitement. No suspicion of\r\nthis sort had yet got abroad. His eloquence had never shone with more\r\nsplendour than during the recent debates. But people afterwards called\r\nto mind many things which ought to have roused their apprehensions. His\r\nhabits were gradually becoming more and more eccentric. A horror of all\r\nloud sounds, such as is said to have been one of the many oddities of\r\nWallenstein, grew upon him. Though the most affectionate of fathers, he\r\ncould not at this time bear to hear the voices of his own children, and\r\nlaid out great {88}sums at Hayes in buying up houses contiguous to his\r\nown, merely that he might have no neighbours to disturb him with their\r\nnoise. He then sold Hayes, and took possession of a villa at Hampstead,\r\nwhere he again began to purchase houses to right and left. In expense,\r\nindeed, he vied, during this part of his life, with the wealthiest of\r\nthe conquerors of Bengal and Tanjore. At Burton Pynsent, he ordered a\r\ngreat extent of ground to be planted with cedars. Cedars enough for\r\nthe purpose were not to be found in Somersetshire. They were therefore\r\ncollected in London, and sent down by land carriage. Relays of labourers\r\nwere hired; and the work went on all night by torchlight. No man could\r\nbe more abstemious than Pitt: yet the profusion of his kitchen was a\r\nwonder even to epicures. Several dinners were always dressing; for his\r\nappetite was capricious and fanciful; and at whatever moment he felt\r\ninclined to eat, he expected a meal to be instantly on the table. Other\r\ncircumstances might be mentioned, such as separately are of little\r\nmoment, but such as, when taken together, and when viewed in connection\r\nwith the strange events which followed, justify us in believing that his\r\nmind was already in a morbid state.\r\n\r\nSoon after the close of the session of Parliament, Lord Rockingham\r\nreceived his dismissal. He retired, accompanied by a firm body of\r\nfriends, whose consistency and uprightness enmity itself was forced to\r\nadmit. None of them had asked or obtained any pension or any sinecure,\r\neither in possession or in reversion. Such disinterestedness was then\r\nrare among politicians. Their chief, though not a man of brilliant\r\ntalents, had won for himself an honourable fame, which he kept pure\r\nto the last. He had, in spite of difficulties which seemed {89}almost\r\ninsurmountable, removed great abuses and averted a civil war. Sixteen\r\nyears later, in a dark and terrible day, he was again called upon to\r\nsave the state, brought to the very brink of ruin by the same perfidy\r\nand obstinacy which had embarrassed, and at length overthrown, his first\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nPitt was planting in Somersetshire when he was summoned to court by a\r\nletter written by the royal hand. He instantly hastened to London. The\r\nirritability of his mind and body were increased by the rapidity\r\nwith which he travelled; and when he reached his journey’s end he was\r\nsuffering from fever. Ill as he was, he saw the King at Richmond, and\r\nundertook to form an administration.\r\n\r\nPitt was scarcely in the state in which a man should be who has to\r\nconduct delicate and arduous negotiations. In his letters to his wife,\r\nhe complained that the conferences in which it was necessary for him\r\nto bear a part heated his blood and accelerated his pulse. From other\r\nsources of information we learn, that his language, even to those whose\r\nco-operation he wished to engage, was strangely peremptory and despotic.\r\nSome of his notes written at this time have been preserved, and are in a\r\nstyle which Lewis the Fourteenth would have been too well bred to employ\r\nin addressing any French gentleman.\r\n\r\nIn the attempt to dissolve all parties, Pitt met with some difficulties.\r\nSome Whigs, whom the court would gladly have detached from Lord\r\nRockingham, rejected all offers. The Bedfords were perfectly willing to\r\nbreak with Grenville; but Pitt would not come up to their terms. Temple,\r\nwhom Pitt at first meant to place at the head of the treasury, proved\r\nintractable. A coldness indeed had, during some months, been fast\r\ngrowing {90}between the brothers-in-law, so long and so closely allied\r\nin politics. Pitt was angry with Temple for opposing the repeal of the\r\nStamp Act. Temple was angry with Pitt for refusing to accede to that\r\nfamily league which was now the favorite plan at Stowe. At length the\r\nEarl proposed an equal partition of power and patronage, and offered, on\r\nthis condition, to give up his brother George. Pitt thought the\r\ndemand exorbitant, and positively refused compliance. A bitter quarrel\r\nfollowed. Each of the kinsmen was true to his character. Temple’s\r\nsoul festered with spite, and Pitt’s swelled into contempt. Temple\r\nrepresented Pitt as the most odious of hypocrites and traitors. Pitt\r\nheld a different and perhaps a more provoking tone. Temple was a good\r\nsort of man enough, whose single title to distinction was, that he had\r\na large garden, with a large piece of water, and a great many pavilions\r\nand summer-houses. To his fortunate connection with a great, orator and\r\nstatesman he was indebted for an importance in the state which his own\r\ntalents could never have gained for him. That importance had turned\r\nhis head. He had begun to fancy that he could form administrations, and\r\ngovern empires. It was piteous to see a well meaning man under such a\r\ndelusion.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these difficulties, a ministry was made such as the\r\nKing wished to see, a ministry in which all his Majesty’s friends were\r\ncomfortably accommodated, and which, with the exception of his Majesty’s\r\nfriends, contained no four persons who had ever in their lives been in\r\nthe habit of acting together. Men who had never concurred in a single\r\nvote found themselves seated at the same board. The office of paymaster\r\nwas divided between two persons who had never {91}exchanged a word. Most\r\nof the chief posts were filled either by personal adherents of Pitt, or\r\nby members of the late ministry, who had been induced to remain in place\r\nafter the dismissal of Lord Rockingham. To the former class belonged\r\nPratt, now Lord Camden, who accepted the great seal, and Lord Shelburne,\r\nwho was made one of the Secretaries of State. To the latter class\r\nbelonged the Duke of Grafton, who became First Lord of the Treasury,\r\nand Conway, who kept his old position both in the government and in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Charles Townshend, who had belonged to every party,\r\nand cared for none, was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Pitt himself was\r\ndeclared prime minister, but refused to take any laborious office. He\r\nwas created Earl of Chatham, and the privy seal was delivered to him.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say, that the failure, the complete and\r\ndisgraceful failure, of this arrangement, is not to be ascribed to any\r\nwant of capacity in the persons whom we have named. None of them was\r\ndeficient in abilities; and four of them, Pitt himself, Shelburne,\r\nCamden, and Townshend, were men of high intellectual eminence. The fault\r\nwas not in the materials, but in the principle on which the materials\r\nwere put together. Pitt had mixed up these conflicting elements, in\r\nthe full confidence that he should be able to keep them all in perfect\r\nsubordination to himself, and in perfect harmony with each other. We\r\nshall soon see how the experiment succeeded.\r\n\r\nOn the very day on which the new prime minister kissed hands, three\r\nfourths of that popularity which he had long enjoyed without a rival,\r\nand to which he owed the greater part of his authority, departed from\r\nhim. A violent outcry was raised, not against that part {92}of his\r\nconduct which really deserved severe condemnation, but against a step\r\nin which we can see nothing to censure. His acceptance of a peerage\r\nproduced a general burst of indignation. Yet surely no peerage had ever\r\nbeen better earned; nor was there ever a statesman who more needed the\r\nrepose of the Upper House. Pitt was now growing old. He was much older\r\nin constitution than in years. It was with imminent risk to his\r\nlife that he had, on some important occasions, attended his duty in\r\nParliament. During the session of 1764, he had not been able to take\r\npart in a single debate. It was impossible that he should go through the\r\nnightly labour of conducting the business of the government in the House\r\nof Commons. His wish to be transferred, under such circumstances, to a\r\nless busy and a less turbulent assembly,-was natural and reasonable. The\r\nnation, however, overlooked all these considerations. Those who had most\r\nloved and honoured the great Commoner were loudest in invective against\r\nthe new made Lord. London had hitherto been true to him through every\r\nvicissitude. When the citizens learned that he had been sent for from\r\nSomersetshire, that he had been closeted with the King at Richmond, and\r\nthat he was to be first minister, they had been in transports of joy.\r\nPreparations were made for a grand entertainment and for a general\r\nillumination. The lamps had actually been placed round the monument,\r\nwhen the Gazette announced that the object of all this enthusiasm was\r\nan Earl. Instantly the feast was countermanded. The lamps were taken\r\ndown. The newspapers raised the roar of obloquy. Pamphlets, made up of\r\ncalumny and scurrility, filled the shops of all the booksellers; and of\r\nthose pamphlets, the most galling were written under {93}the direction\r\nof the malignant Temple. It was now the fashion to compare the two\r\nWilliams, William Pulteney and William Pitt. Both, it was said, had, by\r\neloquence and simulated patriotism, acquired a great ascendency in the\r\nHouse of Commons and in the country. Both had been intrusted with the\r\noffice of reforming the government. Both had, when at the height of\r\npower and popularity, been seduced by the splendour of the coronet. Both\r\nhad been made earls, and both had at once become objects of aversion\r\nand scorn to the nation which a few hours before had regarded them with\r\naffection and veneration.\r\n\r\nThe clamour against Pitt appears to have had a serious effect on the\r\nforeign relations of the country. His name had till now acted like\r\na spell at Versailles and Saint Ildefonso. English travellers on the\r\nContinent had remarked that nothing more was necessary to silence\r\na whole room full of boasting Frenchmen than to drop a hint of the\r\nprobability that Mr. Pitt would return to power. In an instant there was\r\ndeep silence: all shoulders rose, and all faces were lengthened. Now,\r\nunhappily, every foreign court, in learning that he was recalled to\r\noffice, learned also that he no longer possessed the hearts of his\r\ncountrymen. Ceasing to be loved at home, he ceased to be feared abroad.\r\nThe name of Pitt had been a charmed name. Our envoys tried in vain to\r\nconjure with the name of Chatham.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which beset Chatham were daily increased by the\r\ndespotic manner in which he treated all around him. Lord Rockingham had,\r\nat the time of the change of ministry, acted with great moderation, had\r\nexpressed a hope that the new government would act on the principles\r\nof the late government, and had even interfered to prevent many of his\r\nfriends from quitting {94}office. Thus Saunders and Keppel, two\r\nnaval commanders of great eminence, had been induced to remain at the\r\nAdmiralty, where their services were much needed. The Duke of Portland\r\nwas still Lord Chamberlain, and Lord Besborough Postmaster. But within a\r\nquarter of a year, Lord Chatham had so deeply affronted these men,\r\nthat they all retired in disgust. In truth, his tone, submissive in the\r\ncloset, was at this time insupportably tyrannical in the cabinet. His\r\ncolleagues were merely his clerks for naval, financial, and diplomatic\r\nbusiness. Conway, meek as he was, was on one occasion provoked into\r\ndeclaring that such language as Lord Chatham’s had never been heard west\r\nof Constantinople, and was with difficulty prevented by Horace Walpole\r\nfrom resigning, and rejoining the standard of Lord Rockingham.\r\n\r\nThe breach which had been made in the government by the defection of\r\nso many of the Rockinghams, Chatham hoped to supply by the help of the\r\nBedfords. But with the Bedfords he could not deal as he had dealt with\r\nother parties. It was to no purpose that he bade high for one or two\r\nmembers of the faction, in the hope of detaching them from the rest.\r\nThey were to be had; but they were to be had only in the lot. There was\r\nindeed for a moment some wavering and some disputing among them. But\r\nat length the counsels of the shrewd and resolute Rigby prevailed. They\r\ndetermined to stand firmly together, and plainly intimated to Chatham\r\nthat he must take them all, or that he should get none of them. The\r\nevent proved that they were wiser in their generation than any other\r\nconnection in the state. In a few months they were able to dictate their\r\nown terms.\r\n\r\nThe most important public measure of Lord Chatham’s {95}administration\r\nwas his celebrated interference with the corn trade. The harvest had\r\nbeen bad; the price of food was high; and he thought it necessary\r\nto take on himself the responsibility of laying an embargo on the\r\nexportation of grain. When Parliament met, this proceeding was attacked\r\nby the opposition as unconstitutional, and defended by the ministers as\r\nindispensably necessary. At last an act was passed to indemnify all who\r\nhad been concerned in the embargo.\r\n\r\nThe first words uttered by Chatham, in the House of Lords, were in\r\ndefence of his conduct on this occasion. He spoke with a calmness,\r\nsobriety, and dignity, well suited to the audience which he was\r\naddressing. A subsequent speech which he made on the same subject was\r\nless successful. He bade defiance to aristocratical connections, with a\r\nsuperciliousness to which the Peers were not accustomed, and with tones\r\nand gestures better suited to a large and stormy assembly than to the\r\nbody of which he was now a member. A short altercation followed, and he\r\nwas told very plainly that he should not be suffered to browbeat the old\r\nnobility of England.\r\n\r\nIt gradually became clearer and clearer that he was in a distempered\r\nstate of mind. His attention had been drawn to the territorial\r\nacquisitions of the East India Company, and he determined to bring the\r\nwhole of that great subject before Parliament. He would not, however,\r\nconfer on the subject with any of his colleagues. It was in vain that\r\nConway, who was charged with the conduct of business in the House of\r\nCommons, and Charles Townshend, who was responsible for the direction\r\nof the finances, begged for some glimpse of light as to what was in\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\nChatham’s {96}answers were sullen and mysterious. He must decline any\r\ndiscussion with them; he did not want their assistance; he had fixed\r\non a person to take charge of his measure in the House of Commons. This\r\nperson was a member who was not connected with the government, and\r\nwho neither had, nor deserved to have, the ear of the House, a noisy,\r\npurse-proud, illiterate demagogue, whose Cockney English and scraps of\r\nmispronounced Latin were the jest of the newspapers, Alderman Beckford.\r\nIt may well be supposed that these strange proceedings produced a\r\nferment through the whole political world. The city was in commotion.\r\nThe East India Company invoked the faith of charters. Burke thundered\r\nagainst the minis-tors. The ministers looked at each other, and knew\r\nnot what to say. In the midst of the confusion, Lord Chatham proclaimed\r\nhimself gouty, and retired to Bath. It was announced, after some time,\r\nthat he was better, that he would shortly return, that he would soon\r\nput every thing in order. A day was fixed for his arrival in London. But\r\nwhen he reached the Castle inn at Marlborough, he stopped, shut himself\r\nup in his room, and remained there some weeks. Every body who travelled\r\nthat road was amazed by the number of his attendants. Footmen and\r\ngrooms, dressed in his family livery, filled the whole inn, though one\r\nof the largest in England, and Swarmed in the streets of the little\r\ntown. The truth was, that the invalid had insisted that, during his\r\nstay, all the waiters and stable-boys of the Castle should wear his\r\nlivery.\r\n\r\nHis colleagues were in despair. The Duke of Grafton proposed to go down\r\nto Marlborough in order to consult the oracle. But he was informed that\r\nLord Chatham must decline all conversation on business.\r\n\r\nIn {97}the mean time, all the parties which were out of office,\r\nBedfords, Grenvilles, and Rockinghams, joined to oppose the distracted\r\ngovernment on the vote for the land tax. They were reinforced by almost\r\nall the county members, and had a considerable majority. This was the\r\nfirst time that a ministry had been beaten on an important division\r\nin the House of Commons since the fall of Sir Robert Walpole. The\r\nadministration, thus furiously assailed from without, was torn by\r\ninternal dissensions. It had been formed on no principle whatever.\r\nFrom the very first, nothing but Chatham’s authority had prevented the\r\nhostile contingents which made up his ranks from going to blows with\r\neach other. That authority was now withdrawn, and every thing was in\r\ncommotion. Conway, a brave soldier, but in civil affairs the most timid\r\nand irresolute of men, afraid of disobliging the King, afraid of being\r\nabused in the newspapers, afraid of being thought factious if he went\r\nout, afraid of being thought interested if he stayed in, afraid of every\r\nthing, and afraid of being known to be afraid of any thing, was beaten\r\nbackwards and forwards like a shuttlecock between Horace Walpole who\r\nwished to make him prime minister, and Lord John Cavendish who wished\r\nto draw him into opposition. Charles Townshend, a man of splendid\r\neloquence, of lax principles, and of boundless vanity and presumption,\r\nwould submit to no control. The full extent of his parts, of his\r\nambition, and of his arrogance, had not yet been made manifest; for he\r\nhad always quailed before the genius and the lofty character of Pitt.\r\nBut now that Pitt had quitted the House of Commons, and seemed to have\r\nabdicated the part of chief minister, Townshend broke loose from all\r\nrestraint.\r\n\r\nWhile {98}things were in this state, Chatnam at length returned to\r\nLondon. He might as well have remained at Marlborough. He would see\r\nnobody. He would give no opinion on any public matter. The Duke of\r\nGrafton begged piteously for an interview, for an hour, for half an\r\nhour, for five minutes. The answer was, that it was impossible. The King\r\nhimself repeatedly condescended to expostulate and implore. “Your duty,”\r\n he wrote, “your own honour, require you to make an effort.” The answers\r\nto these appeals were commonly written in Lady Chatham’s hand, from her\r\nlord’s dictation; for he had not energy even to use a pen. He flings\r\nhimself at the King’s feet. He is penetrated by the royal goodness so\r\nsignally shown to the most unhappy of men. He implores a little more\r\nindulgence. He cannot as yet transact business. He cannot see his\r\ncolleagues. Least of all can he bear the excitement of an interview with\r\nmajesty.\r\n\r\nSome were half inclined to suspect that he was, to use a military\r\nphrase, malingering. He had made, they said, a great blunder, and\r\nhad found it out. His immense popularity, his high reputation for\r\nstatesmanship, were gone for ever. Intoxicated by pride, he had\r\nundertaken a task beyond his abilities. He now saw nothing before him\r\nbut distresses and humiliations; and he had therefore simulated illness,\r\nin order to escape from vexations which he had not fortitude to meet.\r\nThis suspicion, though it derived some colour from that weakness which\r\nwas the most striking blemish of his character, was certainly unfounded.\r\nHis mind, before he became first minister, had been, as we have said,\r\nin an unsound state; and physical and moral causes now concurred to make\r\nthe derangement of his faculties complete. The gout, which had been the\r\ntorment {99}of his whole life, had been suppressed by strong remedies.\r\nFor the first time since he was a boy at Oxford, he had passed several\r\nmonths without a twinge. But his hand and foot had been relieved at the\r\nexpense of his nerves. He became melancholy, fanciful, irritable. The\r\nembarrassing state of public affairs, the grave responsibility which lay\r\non him, the consciousness of his errors, the disputes of his colleagues,\r\nthe savage clamours raised by his detractors, bewildered his enfeebled\r\nmind. One thing alone, he said, could save him. He must repurchase\r\nHayes. The unwilling consent of the new occupant was extorted by Lady\r\nChatham’s entreaties and tears; and her lord was somewhat easier. But\r\nif business were mentioned to him, he, once the proudest and boldest of\r\nmankind, behaved like a hysterical girl, trembled from head to foot, and\r\nburst into a flood of tears.\r\n\r\nHis colleagues for a time continued to entertain the expectation that\r\nhis health would soon be restored, and that he would emerge from his\r\nretirement. But month followed month, and still he remained hidden\r\nin mysterious seclusion, and sunk, as far as they could learn, in the\r\ndeepest dejection of spirits. They at length ceased to hope or to fear\r\nany thing from him; and though he was still nominally Prime Minister,\r\ntook without scruple steps which they knew to be diametrically opposed\r\nto all his opinions and feelings, allied themselves with those whom he\r\nhad proscribed, disgraced those whom he most esteemed, and laid taxes\r\non the colonies, in the face of the strong declarations which he had\r\nrecently made.\r\n\r\nWhen he had passed about a year and three quarters in gloomy privacy,\r\nthe King received a few lines in Lady Chatham’s hand. They contained a\r\nrequest, dictated {100}by her lord, that he might be permitted to resign\r\nthe Privy Seal. After some civil show of reluctance, the resignation was\r\naccepted. Indeed Chatham was, by this time, almost as much forgotten as\r\nif he had already been lying in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nAt length the clouds which had gathered over his mind broke and passed\r\naway, his gout returned, and freed him from a more cruel malady. His\r\nnerves were newly braced. His spirits became buoyant. He woke as from\r\na sickly dream. It was a strange recovery. Men had been in the habit of\r\ntalking of him as of one dead, and, when he first showed himself at the\r\nKing’s levee, started as if they had seen a ghost. It was more than two\r\nyears and a half since he had appeared in public.\r\n\r\nHe, too, had cause for wonder. The world which he now entered was not\r\nthe world which he had quitted. The administration which he had formed\r\nhad never been, at any one moment, entirely changed. But there had been\r\nso many losses and so many accessions, that he could scarcely recognise\r\nhis own work. Charles Townshend was dead. Lord Shelburne had been\r\ndismissed. Conway had sunk into utter insignificance. The Duke of\r\nGrafton had fallen into the hands of the Bedfords. The Bedfords had\r\ndeserted Grenville, had made their peace with the King and the King’s\r\nfriends, and had been admitted to office. Lord North was Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer, and was rising fast in importance. Corsica had been given\r\nup to France without a struggle. The disputes with the American colonies\r\nhad been revived. A general election had taken place. Wilkes had\r\nreturned from exile, and, outlaw as he was, had been chosen knight of\r\nthe shire for Middlesex. The multitude was on his side. {101}The Court\r\nwas obstinately bent on ruining him, and was prepared to shake the very\r\nfoundations of the constitution for the sake of a paltry revenge. The\r\nHouse of Commons, assuming to itself an authority which of right belongs\r\nonly to the whole legislature, had declared Wilkes incapable of sitting\r\nin Parliament. Nor had it been thought sufficient to keep him out.\r\nAnother must be brought in. Since the freeholders of Middlesex had\r\nobstinately refused to choose a member acceptable to the Court, the\r\nHouse had chosen a member for them. This was not the only instance,\r\nperhaps not the most disgraceful instance, of the inveterate malignity\r\nof the Court. Exasperated by the steady opposition of the Rockingham\r\nparty, the King’s friends had tried to rob a distinguished Whig nobleman\r\nof his private estate, and had persisted in their mean wickedness till\r\ntheir own servile majority had revolted from mere disgust and shame.\r\nDiscontent had spread throughout the nation, and was kept up by\r\nstimulants such as had rarely been applied to the public mind. Junius\r\nhad taken the field, had trampled Sir William Draper in the dust,\r\nhad well nigh broken the heart of Blackstone, and had so mangled the\r\nreputation of the Duke of Grafton, that his grace had become sick\r\nof office, and was beginning to look wistfully towards the shades of\r\nEuston. Every principle of foreign, domestic, and colonial policy which\r\nwas dear to the heart of Chatham, had, during the eclipse of his genius,\r\nbeen violated by the government which he had formed.\r\n\r\nThe remaining years of his life were spent in vainly struggling against\r\nthat fatal policy which, at the moment when he might have given it\r\na death blow, he had been induced to take under his protection. His\r\nexertions {102}redeemed his own fame, but they effected little for his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nHe found two parties arrayed against the government, the party of his\r\nown brothers-in-law, the Grenvilles, and the party of Lord Rockingham.\r\nOn the question of the Middlesex election these parties were agreed. But\r\non many other important questions they differed widely; and they\r\nwere, in truth, not less hostile to each other than to the Court. The\r\nGrenvilles had, during several years, annoyed the Rockinghams with a\r\nsuccession of acrimonious pamphlets. It was long before the Rockinghams\r\ncould be induced to retaliate. But an ill natured tract, written under\r\nGrenville’s direction, and entitled a State of the Nation, was too much\r\nfor their patience. Burke undertook to defend and avenge his friends,\r\nand executed the task with admirable skill and vigour. On every point\r\nhe was victorious, and nowhere more completely victorious than when\r\nhe joined issue on those dry and minute questions of statistical and\r\nfinancial detail in which the main strength of Grenville lay. The\r\nofficial drudge, even on his own chosen ground, was utterly unable\r\nto maintain the fight against the great orator and philosopher. When\r\nChatham reappeared, Grenville was still writhing with the recent shame\r\nand smart of this well merited chastisement. Cordial cooperation between\r\nthe two sections of the Opposition was impossible. Nor could Chatham\r\neasily connect himself with either. His feelings, in spite of many\r\naffronts given and received, drew him towards the Grenvilles. For he had\r\nstrong domestic affections; and his nature, which, though haughty, was\r\nby no means obdurate, had been softened by affliction. But from his\r\nkinsmen he was separated by a wide difference {103}of opinion on the\r\nquestion of colonial taxation. A reconciliation, however, took place.\r\nHe visited Stowe: he shook hands with George Grenville; and the Whig\r\nfreeholders of Buckinghamshire, at their public dinners, drank many\r\nbumpers to the union of the three brothers.\r\n\r\nIn opinions, Chatham was much nearer to the Rockinghams than to his\r\nown relatives. But between him and the Rockinghams there was a gulf not\r\neasily to be passed. He had deeply injured them, and in injuring them,\r\nhad deeply injured his country. When the balance was trembling between\r\nthem and the Court, he had thrown the whole weight of his genius, of his\r\nrenown, of his popularity, into the scale of misgovernment.\r\n\r\nIt must be added, that many eminent members of the party still retained\r\na bitter recollection of the asperity and disdain with which they\r\nhad been treated by him at the time when he assumed the direction of\r\naffairs. It is clear from Burke’s pamphlets and speeches, and still more\r\nclear from his private letters, and from the language which he held in\r\nconversation, that he regarded Chatham with a feeling not far removed\r\nfrom dislike. Chatham was undoubtedly conscious of his error, and\r\ndesirous to atone for it. But his overtures of friendship, though\r\nmade with earnestness, and even with unwonted humility, were at first\r\nreceived by Lord Rockingham with cold and austere reserve. Gradually the\r\nintercourse of the two statesmen became courteous and even amicable. But\r\nthe past was never wholly forgotten.\r\n\r\nChatham did not, however, stand alone. Round him gathered a party, small\r\nin number, but strong in great and various talents. Lord Camden,\r\nLord Shelburne, Colonel Barré, and Dunning, afterwards Lord\r\nAshburton, {104}were the principal members of this connection. There\r\nis no reason to believe that, from this time till within a few weeks\r\nof Chatham’s death, his intellect suffered any decay. His eloquence\r\nwas almost to the last heard with delight. But it was not exactly the\r\neloquence of the House of Lords. That lofty and passionate, but somewhat\r\ndesultory declamation, in which he excelled all men, and which was set\r\noff by looks, tones, and gestures, worthy of Garrick or Talma, was out\r\nof place in a small apartment where the audience often consisted of\r\nthree or four drowsy prelates, three or four old judges, accustomed\r\nduring many years to disregard rhetorick, and to look only at facts and\r\narguments, and three or four listless and supercilious men of fashion,\r\nwhom any thing like enthusiasm moved to a sneer. In the House of\r\nCommons, a flash of his eye, a wave of his arm, had sometimes cowed\r\nMurray. But, in the House of Peers, his utmost vehemence and pathos\r\nproduced less effect than the moderation, the reasonableness, the\r\nluminous order and the serene dignity, which characterized the speeches\r\nof Lord Mansfield.\r\n\r\nOn the question of the Middlesex election, all the three divisions of\r\nthe Opposition acted in concert. No orator in either House defended what\r\nis now universally admitted to have been the constitutional cause with\r\nmore ardour or eloquence than Chatham. Before this subject had ceased to\r\noccupy the public mind, George Grenville died. His party rapidly\r\nmelted away; and in a short time most of his adherents appeared on the\r\nministerial benches.\r\n\r\nHad George Grenville lived many months longer, the friendly ties which,\r\nafter years of estrangement and {105}hostility, had been renewed between\r\nhim and his brother-in-law, would, in all probability, have been a\r\nsecond time violently dissolved. For now the quarrel between England\r\nand the North American colonies took a gloomy and terrible aspect.\r\nOppression provoked resistance; resistance was made the pretext for\r\nfresh oppression. The warnings of all the greatest statesmen of the age\r\nwere lost on an imperious court and a deluded nation. Soon a colonial\r\nsenate confronted the British Parliament. Then the colonial militia\r\ncrossed bayonets with the British regiments. At length the commonwealth\r\nwas torn asunder. Two millions of Englishmen, who, fifteen years before,\r\nhad been as loyal to their prince and as proud of their country as the\r\npeople of Kent or Yorkshire, separated themselves by a solemn act from\r\nthe Empire. For a time it seemed that the insurgents would struggle\r\nto small purpose against the vast financial and military means of\r\nthe mother country. But disasters, following one another in rapid\r\nsuccession, rapidly dispelled the illusions of national vanity. At\r\nlength a great British force, exhausted, famished, harassed on every\r\nside by a hostile peasantry, was compelled to deliver up its arms. Those\r\ngovernments which England had, in the late war, so signally humbled,\r\nand which had during many years been sullenly brooding over the\r\nrecollections of Quebec, of Minden, and of the Moro, now saw with\r\nexultation that the day of revenge was at hand. France recognised the\r\nindependence of the United States; and there could be little doubt that\r\nthe example would soon be followed by Spain.\r\n\r\nChatham and Rockingham had cordially concurred in opposing every part\r\nof the fatal policy which had brought the state into this dangerous\r\nsituation. But their {106}paths now diverged. Lord Rockingham thought,\r\nand, as the event proved, thought most justly, that the revolted\r\ncolonies were separated from the Empire for ever, and that the only\r\neffect of prolonging the war on the American continent would be to\r\ndivide resources which it was desirable to concentrate. If the hopeless\r\nattempt to subjugate Pennsylvania and Virginia were abandoned,\r\nwar against the House of Bourbon might possibly be avoided, or, if\r\ninevitable, might be carried on with success and glory. We might even\r\nindemnify ourselves for part of what we had lost, at the expense\r\nof those foreign enemies who had hoped to profit by our domestic\r\ndissensions. Lord Rockingham, therefore, and those who acted with him,\r\nconceived that the wisest course now open to England was to acknowledge\r\nthe independence of the United States, and to turn her whole force\r\nagainst her European enemies.\r\n\r\nChatham, it should seem, ought to have taken the same side. Before\r\nFrance had taken any part in our quarrel with the colonies, he had\r\nrepeatedly, and with great energy of language, declared that it was\r\nimpossible to conquer America, and he could not without absurdity\r\nmaintain that it was easier to conquer France and America together than\r\nAmerica alone. But his passions overpowered his judgment, and made him\r\nblind to his own inconsistency. The very circumstances which made\r\nthe separation of the colonies inevitable made it to him altogether\r\ninsupportable. The dismemberment of the Empire seemed to him less\r\nruinous and humiliating, when produced by domestic dissensions,\r\nthan when produced by foreign interference. His blood boiled at the\r\ndegradation of his country. Whatever lowered her among the nations\r\nof {107}the earth, he felt as a personal outrage to himself. And the\r\nfeeling was natural. He had made her so great. He had been so proud\r\nof her; and she had been so proud of him. He remembered how, more than\r\ntwenty years before, in a day of gloom and dismay, when her possessions\r\nwere torn from her, when her flag was dishonoured, she had called on\r\nhim to save her. He remembered the sudden and glorious change which\r\nhis energy had wrought, the long series of triumphs, the days of\r\nthanksgiving, the nights of illumination. Fired by such recollections,\r\nhe determined to separate himself from those who advised that the\r\nindependence of the colonies should be acknowledged. That he was in\r\nerror will scarcely, we think, be disputed by his warmest admirers.\r\nIndeed, the treaty, by which, a few years later, the republic of\r\nthe United States was recognised, was the work of his most attached\r\nadherents and of his favourite son.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Richmond had given notice of an address to the throne,\r\nagainst the further prosecution of hostilities with America. Chatham\r\nhad, during some time, absented himself from Parliament, in consequence\r\nof his growing infirmities. He determined to appear in his place on this\r\noccasion, and to declare that his opinions were decidedly at variance\r\nwith those of the Rockingham party. He was in a state of great\r\nexcitement. His medical attendants were uneasy, and strongly advised him\r\nto calm himself, and to remain at home. But he was not to be controlled.\r\nHis son William, and his son-in-law Lord Mahon, accompanied him to\r\nWestminster. He rested himself in the Chancellor’s room till the debate\r\ncommenced, and then, leaning on his two young relations, limped to his\r\nseat. The slightest particulars of that day {108}were remembered, and\r\nhave been carefully recorded. He bowed, it was remarked, with great\r\ncourtliness to those peers who rose to make way for him and his\r\nsupporters. His crutch was in his hand, he wore, as was his fashion,\r\na rich velvet coat. His legs were swathed in flannel. His wig was so\r\nlarge, and his face so emaciated, that none of his features could be\r\ndiscerned, except the high curve of his nose, and his eyes, which still\r\nretained a gleam of the old fire.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke of Richmond had spoken, Chatham rose. For some time his\r\nvoice was inaudible. At length his tones became distinct and his action\r\nanimated. Here and there his hearers caught a thought or an expression\r\nwhich reminded them of William Pitt. But it was clear that he was not\r\nhimself. He lost the thread of his discourse, hesitated, repeated the\r\nsame words several times, and was so confused that, in speaking of the\r\nAct of Settlement, he could not recall the name of the Electress Sophia.\r\nThe House listened in solemn silence, and with the aspect of profound\r\nrespect and compassion. The stillness was so deep that the dropping of\r\na handkerchief would have been heard. The Duke of Richmond replied\r\nwith great tenderness and courtesy; but while he spoke, the old man was\r\nobserved to be restless and irritable. The Duke sat down. Chatham stood\r\nup again, pressed his hand on his breast, and sank down in an apoplectic\r\nfit. Three or four lords who sat near him caught him in his fall. The\r\nHouse broke up in confusion. The dying man was carried to the residence\r\nof one of the officers of Parliament, and was so far restored as to be\r\nable to bear a journey to Hayes. At Hayes, after lingering a few weeks,\r\nhe expired in his {109}seventieth year. His bed was watched to the last,\r\nwith anxious tenderness, by his wife and children; and he well deserved\r\ntheir care. Too often haughty and wayward to others, to them he had\r\nbeen almost effeminately kind. He had through life been dreaded by his\r\npolitical opponents, and regarded with more awe than love even by\r\nhis political associates. But no fear seems to have mingled with the\r\naffection which his fondness, constantly overflowing in a thousand\r\nendearing forms, had inspired in the little circle at Hayes.\r\n\r\nChatham, at the time of his decease, had not, in both Houses of\r\nParliament, ten personal adherents. Half the public men of the age\r\nhad been estranged from him by his errors, and the other half by the\r\nexertions which he had made to repair his errors. His last speech had\r\nbeen an attack at once on the policy pursued by the government, and on\r\nthe policy recommended by the opposition. But death restored him to his\r\nold place in the affection of his country. Who could hear unmoved of the\r\nfall of that which had been so great, and which had stood so long? The\r\ncircumstances, too, seemed rather to belong to the tragic stage than to\r\nreal life. A great statesman, full of years and honours, led forth\r\nto the Senate House by a son of rare hopes, and stricken down in full\r\ncouncil while straining his feeble voice to rouse the drooping spirit\r\nof his country, could not but be remembered with peculiar veneration and\r\ntenderness. The few detractors who ventured to murmur were silenced\r\nby the indignant clamours of a nation which remembered only the lofty\r\ngenius, the unsullied probity, the undisputed services, of him who\r\nwas no more. For once, the chiefs of all parties were agreed. A public\r\nfuneral, a {110}public monument, were eagerly voted. The debts of the\r\ndeceased were paid. A provision was made for his family. The City of\r\nLondon requested that the remains of the great man whom she had so\r\nlong loved and honoured might rest under the dome of her magnificent\r\ncathedral. But the petition came too late. Every thing was already\r\nprepared for the interment in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nThough men of all parties had concurred in decreeing posthumous honours\r\nto Chatham, his corpse was attended to the grave almost exclusively by\r\nopponents of the government. The banner of the lordship of Chatham\r\nwas borne by Colonel Barré, attended by the Duke of Richmond and Lord\r\nRockingham. Burke, Savile, and Dunning upheld the pall. Lord Camden was\r\nconspicuous in the procession. The chief mourner was young William Pitt.\r\nAfter the lapse of more than twenty-seven years, in a season as dark and\r\nperilous, his own shattered frame and broken heart were laid, with the\r\nsame pomp, in the same consecrated mould.\r\n\r\nChatham sleeps near the northern door of the Church, in a spot which has\r\never since been appropriated to statesmen, as the other end of the same\r\ntransept has long been to poets. Mansfield rests there, and the second\r\nWilliam Pitt, and Fox, and Grattan, and Canning, and Wilberforce. In no\r\nother cemetery do so many great citizens he within so narrow a space.\r\nHigh over those venerable graves towers the stately monument of Chatham,\r\nand from above, his effigy, graven by a cunning hand, seems still, with\r\neagle face and outstretched arm, to bid England be of good cheer, and to\r\nhurl defiance at her foes. The generation which reared that memorial of\r\nhim has disappeared. The time has come when the rash and indiscriminate\r\njudgments {111}which his contemporaries passed on his character may\r\nbe calmly revised by history. And history, while, for the warning of\r\nvehement, high, and daring natures, she notes his many errors, will yet\r\ndeliberately pronounce, that, among the eminent men whose bones he near\r\nhis, scarcely one has left a more stainless, and none a more splendid\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS ATTERBURY.\r\n\r\n(_Encyclopodia Britannica_, December 1853.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancis Atterbury, {112}a man who holds a conspicuous place in the\r\npolitical, ecclesiastical, and literary history of England, was born in\r\nthe year 1662, at Middleton in Buckinghamshire, a parish of which his\r\nfather was rector. Francis was educated at Westminster School, and\r\ncarried thence to Christ Church a stock of learning which, though really\r\nscanty, he through life exhibited with such judicious ostentation that\r\nsuperficial observers believed his attainments to be immense. At Oxford,\r\nhis parts, his taste, and his bold, contemptuous, and imperious spirit,\r\nsoon made him conspicuous. Here he published, at twenty, his first work,\r\na translation of the noble poem of Absalom and Achitophel into Latin\r\nverse. Neither the style nor the versification of the young scholar\r\nwas that of the Augustan age. In English composition he succeeded much\r\nbetter. In 1687 he distinguished himself among many able men who wrote\r\nin defence of the Church of England, then persecuted by James II., and\r\ncalumniated by apostates who had for lucre quitted her communion. Among\r\nthese apostates none was more active or malignant than Obadiah Walker,\r\nwho was master of University College, and who had set up there, under\r\nthe royal patronage, a press for printing tracts {113}against the\r\nestablished religion. In one of these tracts, written apparently by\r\nWalker himself, many aspersions were thrown on Martin Luther. Atterbury\r\nundertook to defend the great Saxon Reformer, and performed that task\r\nin a manner singularly characteristic. Whoever examines his reply to\r\nWalker will be struck by the contrast between the feebleness of those\r\nparts which are argumentative and defensive, and the vigour of those\r\nparts which are rhetorical and aggressive. The Papists were so much\r\ngalled by the sarcasms and invectives of the young polemic that they\r\nraised a cry of treason, and accused him of having, by implication,\r\ncalled King James a Judas.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution, Atterbury, though bred in the doctrines of\r\nnon-resistance and passive obedience, readily swore fealty to the\r\nnew government. In no long time he took holy orders. He occasionally\r\npreached in London with an eloquence which raised his reputation, and\r\nsoon had the honour of being appointed one of the royal chaplains.\r\nBut he ordinarily resided at Oxford, where he took an active part\r\nin academical business, directed the classical studies of the\r\nundergraduates of his college, and was the chief adviser and assistant\r\nof Dean Aldrich, a divine now chiefly remembered by his catches,\r\nbut renowned among his contemporaries as a scholar, a Tory, and a\r\nhigh-churchman. It was the practice, not a very judicious practice, of\r\nAldrich to employ the most promising youths of his college in editing\r\nGreek and Latin books. Among the studious and well-disposed lads who\r\nwere, unfortunately for themselves, induced to become teachers of\r\nphilology when they should have been content to be learners, was Charles\r\nBoyle, son of the Earl of Orrery, and nephew of Robert Boyle, the great\r\nexperimental {114}philosopher. The task assigned to Charles Boyle was to\r\nprepare a new edition of one of the most worthless books in existence.\r\nIt was a fashion, amoung those Greeks and Romans who cultivated rhetoric\r\nas an art, to compose epistles and harangues in the names of eminent\r\nmen. Some of these counterfeits are fabricated with such exquisite taste\r\nand skill that it is the highest achievement of criticism to distinguish\r\nthem from originals.\r\n\r\nOthers are so feebly and rudely executed that they can hardly impose on\r\nan intelligent school-boy. The best specimen which has come down to\r\nus is perhaps the oration for Marcellus, such an imitation of Tully’s\r\neloquence as Tally would himself have read with wonder and delight. The\r\nworst specimen is perhaps a collection of letters purporting to have\r\nbeen written by that Phalaris who governed Agrigentum more than\r\n500 years before the Christian era. The evidence, both internal and\r\nexternal, against the genuineness of these letters is overwhelming.\r\nWhen, in the fifteenth century, they emerged, in company with much\r\nthat was far more valuable, from their obscurity, they were pronounced\r\nspurious by Politian, the greatest scholar of Italy, and by Erasmus, the\r\ngreatest scholar on our side of the Alps. In truth, it would be as easy\r\nto persuade an educated Englishman that one of Johnson’s Ramblers was\r\nthe work of William Wallace as to persuade a man like Erasmus that a\r\npedantic exercise, composed in the trim and artificial Attic of the time\r\nof Julian, was a despatch written by a crafty and ferocious Dorian, who\r\nroasted people alive many years before there existed a volume of prose\r\nin the Greek language. But, though Christ-Church could boast of many\r\ngood Latinists, of many good English writers, and of a greater number of\r\nclever and fashionable {115}men of the world than belonged to any other\r\nacademic body, there was not then in the college a single man capable of\r\ndistinguishing between the infancy and the dotage of Greek literature.\r\nSo superficial indeed was the learning; of the rulers of this celebrated\r\nsociety that they were charmed by an essay which Sir William Temple\r\npublished in praise of the ancient writers. It now seems strange that\r\neven the eminent public services, the deserved popularity, and the\r\ngraceful style of Temple should have saved so silly a performance from\r\nuniversal contempt. Of the books which he most vehemently eulogised his\r\neulogies proved that he knew nothing. In fact, he could not read a line\r\nof the language in which they were written. Among many other foolish\r\nthings, he said that the letters of Phalaris were the oldest letters\r\nand also the best in the world. Whatever Temple wrote attracted notice.\r\nPeople who had never heard of the Epistles of Phalaris began to inquire\r\nabout them. Aldrich, who knew very little Greek, took the word of Temple\r\nwho knew none, and desired Boyle to prepare a new edition of these\r\nadmirable compositions which, having long slept in obscurity, had become\r\non a sudden objects of general interest.\r\n\r\nThe edition was prepared with the help of Atterbury, who was Boyle’s\r\ntutor, and of some other members of the college. It was an edition such\r\nas might be expected from people who would stoop to édité such a book.\r\nThe notes were worthy of the text; the Latin version worthy of the Greek\r\noriginal. The volume would have been forgotten in a month, had not a\r\nmisunderstanding about a manuscript arisen between the young editor and\r\nthe greatest scholar that had appeared in Europe since the revival of\r\nletters, Richard Bentley. {116}The manuscript was in Bentley’s keeping.\r\nBoyle wished it to be collated. A mischief-making bookseller informed\r\nhim that Bentley had refused to lend it, which was false and also that\r\nBentley had spoken contemptuously of the letters attributed to Phalaris,\r\nand of the critics who were taken in by such counterfeits, which was\r\nperfectly true. Boyle, much provoked, paid, in his preface, a bitterly\r\nironical compliment to Bentley’s courtesy. Bentley revenged himself by a\r\nshort dissertation, in which he proved that the epistles were spurious,\r\nand the new edition of them worthless: but he treated Boyle personally\r\nwith civility as a young gentleman of great hopes, whose love of\r\nlearning was highly commendable, and who deserved to have had better\r\ninstructors.\r\n\r\nFew things in literary history are more extraordinary than the storm\r\nwhich this little dissertation raised. Bentley had treated Boyle with\r\nforbearance; but he had treated Christ-Church with contempt; and the\r\nChrist-Church-men, wherever dispersed, were as much attached to their\r\ncollege as a Scotchman to his country, or a Jesuit to his order. Their\r\ninfluence was great. They were dominant at Oxford, powerful in the Inns\r\nof Court and in the College of Physicians, conspicuous in Parliament and\r\nin the literary and fashionable circles of London. Their unanimous\r\ncry was, that the honour of the college must be vindicated, that the\r\ninsolent Cambridge pedant must be put down. Poor Boyle was unequal to\r\nthe task, and disinclined to it. It was, therefore, assigned to his\r\ntutor Atterbury.\r\n\r\nThe answer to Bentley, which bears the name of Boyle, but which was,\r\nin truth, no more the work of Boyle than the letters to which the\r\ncontroversy related were the work of Phalaris, is now read only by the\r\ncurious, {117}and will in all probability never be reprinted again. But\r\nit had its day of noisy popularity. It was to be found, not only in\r\nthe studies of men of letters, but on the tables of the most brilliant\r\ndrawing-rooms of Soho Square and Covent Garden. Even the beaus and\r\ncoquettes of that age, the Wildairs and the Lady Lurewells, the\r\nMirabells and the Millamants, congratulated each other on the way in\r\nwhich the gay young gentleman, whose erudition sate so easily upon him,\r\nand who wrote with so much pleasantry and good breeding about the Attic\r\ndialect and the anapæstic measure, Sicilian talents and Therielean cups,\r\nhad bantered the queer prig of a doctor. Nor was the applause of the\r\nmultitude undeserved. The book is, indeed, Atterbury’s masterpiece, and\r\ngives a higher notion of his powers than any of those works to which he\r\nput his name. That he was altogether in the wrong on the main question,\r\nand on all the collateral questions springing out of it, that his\r\nknowledge of the language, the literature, and the history of Greece was\r\nnot equal to what many freshmen now bring up every year to Cambridge and\r\nOxford, and that some of his blunders seem rather to deserve a flogging\r\nthan a refutation, is true; and therefore it is that his performance is,\r\nin the highest degree, interesting and valuable to a judicious\r\nreader. It is good by reason of its exceeding badness. It is the most\r\nextraordinary instance that exists of the art of making much show with\r\nlittle substance. There is no difficulty, says the steward of Molière’s\r\nmiser, in giving a fine dinner with plenty of money: the really great\r\ncook is he who can set out a banquet with no money at all. That Bentley\r\nshould have written excellently on ancient chronology and geography, on\r\nthe development of the Greek language, and the origin of the {118}Greek\r\ndrama, is not strange. But that Atterbury should, during some years,\r\nhave been thought to have treated these subjects much better than\r\nBentley is strange indeed. It is true that the champion of Christ-Church\r\nhad all the help which the most celebrated members of that society could\r\ngive him. Smalridge contributed some very good wit; Friend and others\r\nsome very bad archaeology and philology. But the greater part of the\r\nvolume was entirely Atterbury’s: what was not his own was revised and\r\nretouched by him; and the whole bears the mark of his mind, a mind\r\ninexhaustibly rich in all the resources of controversy, and familiar with\r\nall the artifices which make falsehood look like truth, and ignorance\r\nlike knowledge. He had little gold; but he beat that little out to the\r\nvery thinnest leaf, and spread it over so vast a surface that to those\r\nwho judged by a glance, and who did not resort to balances and tests,\r\nthe glittering heap of worthless matter which he produced seemed to be\r\nan inestimable treasure of massy bullion. Such arguments as he had he\r\nplaced in the clearest light. Where he had no arguments, he resorted to\r\npersonalities, sometimes serious, generally ludicrous, always clever\r\nand cutting. But, whether he was grave or merry, whether he reasoned or\r\nsneered, his style was always pure, polished, and easy.\r\n\r\nParty spirit then ran high; yet, though Bentley ranked among Whigs, and\r\nChrist-Church was a stronghold of Toryism, Whigs joined with Tories\r\nin applauding Atterbury’s volume. Garth insulted Bentley, and extolled\r\nBoyle in lines which are now never quoted except to be laughed at.\r\nSwift, in his “Battle of the Books,” introduced with much pleasantry\r\nBoyle, clad in armour, the gift of all the gods, and directed by Apollo\r\n{110}in the form of a human friend, for whose name a blank is left which\r\nmay easily be filled up. The youth, so accoutred, and so assisted, gains\r\nan easy victory over his uncourteous and boastful antagonist Bentley,\r\nmeanwhile, was supported by the consciousness of an immeasurable\r\nsuperiority, and encouraged by the voices of the few who were really\r\ncompetent to judge the combat. “No man,” he said, justly and nobly, “was\r\never written down but by himself.” He spent two years in preparing a\r\nreply, which will never cease to be read and prized while the literature\r\nof ancient Greece is studied in any part of the world. This reply\r\nproved, not only that the letters ascribed to Phalaris were spurious,\r\nbut that Atterbury, with all his wit, his eloquence, his skill in\r\ncontroversial fence, was the most audacious pretender that ever wrote\r\nabout what he did not understand. But to Atterbury this exposure was\r\nmatter of indifference. He was now engaged in a dispute about matters\r\nfar more important and exciting than the laws of Zaleucus and the law’s\r\nof Charondas. The rage of religions factions was extreme. High church\r\nand Low church divided the nation. The great majority of the clergy were\r\non the high-church side; the majority of King William’s bishops were\r\ninclined to latitudinarianism.\r\n\r\nA dispute arose between the two parties touching the extent of the\r\npowers of the Lower House of Convocation. Atterbury thrust himself\r\neagerly into the front rank of the high-churchmen. Those who take\r\na comprehensive and impartial view of his whole career will not be\r\ndisposed to give him credit for religious zeal. But it was his nature to\r\nbe vehement and pugnacious in the cause of every fraternity of which he\r\nwas a member. He had defended the genuineness of {120}a spurious book\r\nsimply because Christ-Church had put forth an edition of that book; he\r\nnow stood up for the clergy against the civil power, simply because he\r\nwas a clergyman, and for the priests against the episcopal order, simply\r\nbecause he was as yet only a priest, he asserted the pretensions of the\r\nclass to which he belonged in several treatises written with much wit,\r\ningenuity, audacity, and acrimony. In this, as in his first controversy,\r\nhe was opposed to antagonists whose knowledge of the subject in dispute\r\nwas far superior to his; but in this, as in his first controversy, he\r\nimposed on the multitude by bold assertion, by sarcasm, by declamation,\r\nand, above all, by his peculiar knack of exhibiting a little erudition\r\nin such a manner as to make it look like a great deal. Having passed\r\nhimself off on the world as a greater master of classical learning than\r\nBentley, he now passed himself off as a greater master of ecclesiastical\r\nlearning than Wake or Gibson. By the great body of the clergy he was\r\nregarded as the ablest and most intrepid tribune that had ever defended\r\ntheir rights against the oligarchy of prelates. The Lower House of\r\nConvocation voted him thanks for his services; the University of Oxford\r\ncreated him a doctor of divinity; and soon after the accession of Anne,\r\nwhile the Tories still had the chief weight in the government, he was\r\npromoted to the deanery of Carlisle.\r\n\r\nSoon after he had obtained this preferment, the Whig party rose to\r\nascendency in the state. From that party he could expect no favour. Six\r\nyears elapsed before a change of fortune took place. At length, in\r\nthe year 1710, the prosecution of Sacheverell produced a formidable\r\nexplosion of high-church fanaticism. At such a moment Atterbury could\r\nnot fail to {121}be conspicuous. His inordinate zeal for the body to\r\nwhich he belonged, his turbulent and aspiring temper, his rare talents\r\nfor agitation and for controversy, were again signally displayed. He\r\nbore a chief part in framing that artful and eloquent speech which the\r\naccused divine pronounced at the bar of the Lords, and which presents\r\na singular contrast to the absurd and scurrilous sermon which had very\r\nunwisely been honoured with impeachment. During the troubled and anxious\r\nmonths which followed the trial, Atterbury was among the most active of\r\nthose pamphleteers who inflamed the nation against the Whig ministry\r\nand the Whig parliament. When the ministry had been changed and the\r\nparliament dissolved, rewards were showered upon him. The Lower House\r\nof Convocation elected him prolocutor. The Queen appointed him Dean of\r\nChrist-Church on the death of his old friend and patron Aldrich. The\r\ncollege would have preferred a gentler ruler. Nevertheless, the new\r\nhead was received with every mark of honour. A congratulatory oration in\r\nLatin was addressed to him in the magnificent vestibule of the hall; and\r\nhe in reply professed the warmest attachment to the venerable house in\r\nwhich he had been educated, and paid many gracious compliments to those\r\nover whom he was to preside. But it was not in his nature to be a mild\r\nor an equitable governor. He had left the chapter of Carlisle distracted\r\nby quarrels. He found Christ-Church at peace; but in three months his\r\ndespotic and contentious temper did at Christ-Church what it had done\r\nat Carlisle. He was succeeded in both his deaneries by the humane and\r\naccomplished Smalridge, who gently complained of the state in which both\r\nhad been left. Atterbury goes before, and sets everything on fire.\r\n\r\n“I {122}come after him with a bucket of water.” It was said by\r\nAtterbury’s enemies that he was made a bishop because he was\r\nso bad a dean. Under his administration Christ-Church was in\r\nconfusion; scandalous altercations took place, opprobrious words were\r\nexchanged; and there was reason to fear that the great Tory college\r\nwould be ruined by the tyranny of the great Tory doctor. He was soon\r\nremoved to the bishopric of Rochester, which was then always united with\r\nthe deanery of Westminster. Still higher dignities seemed to be before\r\nhim. For, though there were many able men on the episcopal bench, there\r\nwas none who equalled or approached him in parliamentary talents. Had\r\nhis party continued in power, it is not improbable that he would have\r\nbeen raised to the archbishopric of Canterbury. The more splendid his\r\nprospects, the more reason he had to dread the accession of a family\r\nwhich was well known to be partial to the Whigs. There is every reason\r\nto believe that he was one of those politicians who hoped that they\r\nmight be able, during the life of Anne, to prepare matters in such a way\r\nthat at her decease there might be little difficulty in setting aside\r\nthe Act of Settlement and placing the Pretender on the throne. Her\r\nsudden death confounded the projects of these conspirators. Atterbury,\r\nwho wanted no kind of courage, implored his confederates to proclaim\r\nJames III., and offered to accompany the heralds in lawn sleeves. But he\r\nfound even the bravest soldiers of his party irresolute, and exclaimed,\r\nnot, it is said, without interjections which ill became the mouth of a\r\nfather of the church, that the best of all causes and the most precious\r\nof all moments had been pusillanimously thrown away. He acquiesced in\r\nwhat he could not prevent, took the oaths to the House of {123}Hanover,\r\nand at the coronation officiated with the outward show of zeal, and did\r\nhis best to ingratiate himself with the royal family. But his servility\r\nwas requited with cold contempt. No creature is so revengeful as a proud\r\nman who has humbled himself in vain. Atterbury became the most factious\r\nand pertinacious of all the opponents of the government. In the House of\r\nLords his oratory, lucid, pointed, lively, and set off with every grace\r\nof pronunciation and of gesture, extorted the attention and admiration\r\neven of a hostile majority. Some of the most remarkable protests which\r\nappear in the journals of the peers were drawn up by him; and, in some\r\nof the bitterest of those pamphlets which called on the English to\r\nstand up for their country against the aliens who had come from beyond\r\nthe seas to oppress and plunder her, critics easily detected his’ style.\r\nWhen the rebellion of 1715 broke out, he refused to sign the paper\r\nin which the bishops of the province of Canterbury declared their\r\nattachment to the Protestant succession. He busied himself in\r\nelectioneering, especially at Westminster, where, as dean, he possessed\r\ngreat influence; and was, indeed, strongly suspected of having once set\r\non a riotous mob to prevent his Whig fellow-citizens from polling.\r\n\r\nAfter having been long in indirect communication with the exiled family,\r\nhe, in 1717, began to correspond directly with the Pretender. The first\r\nletter of the correspondence is extant. In that letter Atterbury boasts\r\nof having, during many years past, neglected no opportunity of serving\r\nthe Jacobite cause. “My daily prayer,” he says, “is that you may have\r\nsuccess. May I live to see that day, and live no longer than I do what\r\nis in my power to forward it.” It is to be remembered that he who wrote\r\nthus was a man bound to set {124}to the church of which he was overseer\r\nan example of strict probity; that he had repeatedly sworn allegiance to\r\nthe House of Brunswick; that he had assisted in placing the crown on\r\nthe head of George I.; and that he had abjured James III., “without\r\nequivocation or mental reservation, on the true faith of a Christian.”\r\n\r\nIt is agreeable to turn from his public to his private life. His\r\nturbulent spirit, wearied with faction and treason, now and then\r\nrequired repose, and found it in domestic endearments, and in the\r\nsociety of the most illustrious of the living and of the dead. Of his\r\nwife little is known: but between him and his daughter there was an\r\naffection singularly close and tender. The gentleness of his manners\r\nwhen he was in the company of a few friends was such as seemed hardly\r\ncredible to those who knew him only by his writings and speeches. The\r\ncharm of his “softer hour” has been commemorated by one of those friends\r\nin imperishable verse. Though Atterbury’s classical attainments were not\r\ngreat, his taste in English literature was excellent; and his admiration\r\nof genius was so strong that it overpowered even his political and\r\nreligions antipathies. His fondness fur Milton, the mortal enemy of the\r\nStuarts and of the church, was such as to many Tories seemed a crime. On\r\nthe sad night on which Addison was laid in the chapel of Henry VII., the\r\nWestminster boys remarked that Atterbury read the funeral service with\r\na peculiar tenderness and solemnity. The favourite companions, however,\r\nof the great Tory prelate were, as might have been expected, men whose\r\npolitics had at least a tinge of Toryism. He lived on friendly terms\r\nwith Swift, Arbuthnot, and Gay. With Prior he had a close intimacy,\r\n{125}which some misunderstanding about public affairs at last dissolved.\r\nPope found in Atterbury, not only a warm admirer, but a most faithful,\r\nfearless, and judicious adviser. The poet was a frequent guest at the\r\nepiscopal palace among the elms of Bromley, and entertained not the\r\nslightest suspicion that his host, now declining in years, confined to\r\nan easy chair by front, and apparently devoted to literature, was deeply\r\nconcerned in criminal and perilous designs against the government.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the Jacobites had been cowed by the events of 1715. It\r\nrevived in 1721. The failure of the South Sea project, the panic in the\r\nmoney market, the downfall of great commercial houses, the distress\r\nfrom which no part of the kingdom was exempt, had produced general\r\ndiscontent. It seemed not improbable that at such a moment an\r\ninsurrection might be successful. An insurrection was planned. The\r\nstreets, of London were to be barricaded; the Tower and the Bank were\r\nto be surprised; King George, his family, and his chief captains and\r\ncouncillors, were to be arrested; and King James was to be proclaimed.\r\nThe design became known to the Duke of Orleans, regent of France, who\r\nwas on terms of friendship with the House of Hanover. He put the English\r\ngovernment on its guard. Some of the chief malcontents were committed to\r\nprison; and among them was Atterbury. No bishop of the Church of England\r\nhad been taken into custody since that memorable day when the applauses\r\nand prayers of all London had followed the seven bishops to the gate\r\nof the Tower. The Opposition entertained some hope that it might be\r\npossible to excite among the people an enthusiasm resembling that of\r\ntheir fathers, who rushed into the waters of the Thames {126}to implore\r\nthe blessing of Saneroft. Pictures of the heroic confessor in his cell\r\nwere exhibited at the shop windows. Verses in his praise were sung about\r\nthe streets. The restraints by which he was prevented from communicating\r\nwith his accomplices were represented as cruelties worthy of the\r\ndungeons of the Inquisition. Strong appeals were made to the priesthood.\r\nWould they tamely permit so gross an insult to be offered to their\r\ncloth? Would they suffer the ablest, the most eloquent member of their\r\nprofession, the man who had so often stood up for their rights against\r\nthe civil power, to be treated like the vilest of mankind? There was\r\nconsiderable excitement; but it was allayed by a temperate and artful\r\nletter to the clergy, the work, in all probability, of Bishop Gibson,\r\nwho stood high in the favour of Walpole, and shortly after became\r\nminister for ecclesiastical affairs.\r\n\r\nAtterbury remained in close confinement during some months. He had\r\ncarried on his correspondence with the exiled family so cautiously that\r\nthe circumstantial proofs of his guilt, though sufficient to produce\r\nentire moral conviction, were not sufficient to justify legal\r\nconviction. He could be reached only by a bill of pains and penalties.\r\nSuch a bill the Whig party, then decidedly predominant in both houses,\r\nwas quite prepared to support. Many hot-headed members of that party\r\nwere eager to follow the precedent which had been set in the case of\r\nSir John Fenwick, and to pass an act for cutting off the bishop’s head.\r\nCadogan, who commanded the army, a brave soldier, but a headstrong\r\npolitician, is said to have exclaimed with great vehemence: “Fling him\r\nto the lions in the Tower.” But the wiser and more humane Walpole was\r\nalways unwilling to shed blood; and his influence prevailed. {127}When\r\nparliament met, the evidence against the bishop was laid before\r\ncommittees of both houses. Those committees reported that his guilt\r\nwas proved. In the Commons a resolution, pronouncing him a traitor, was\r\ncarried by nearly two to one. A bill was then introduced which provided\r\nthat he should be deprived of his spiritual dignities, that he should\r\nbe banished for life, and that no British subject should hold any\r\nintercourse with him except by the royal permission.\r\n\r\nThis bill passed the Commons with little difficulty. For the bishop,\r\nthough invited to defend himself, chose to reserve his defence for the\r\nassembly of which he was a member. In the Lords the contest was\r\nsharp. The young Duke of Wharton, distinguished by his parts, his\r\ndissoluteness, and his versatility, spoke for Atterbury with great\r\neffect; and Atterbury’s own voice was heard for the last time by that\r\nunfriendly audience which had so often listened to him with mingled\r\naversion and delight. He produced few witnesses; nor did those witnesses\r\nsay much that could be of service to him. Among them was Pope. He was\r\ncalled to prove that, while he was an inmate of the palace at Bromley,\r\nthe bishop’s time was completely occupied by literary and domestic\r\nmatters, and that no leisure was left for plotting. But Pope, who\r\nwas quite unaccustomed to speak in public, lost his head, and, as he\r\nafterwards owned, though he had only ten words to say, made two or three\r\nblunders.\r\n\r\nThe bill finally passed the Lords by eighty-three votes to forty-three.\r\nThe bishops, with a single exception, were in the majority. Their\r\nconduct drew on them a sharp taunt from Lord Bathurst, a warm friend\r\nof Atterbury and a zealous Tory. “The wild Indians,” he said, “give no\r\nquarter, because they believe {128}that they shall inherit the skill and\r\nprowess of every adversary whom they destroy. Perhaps the animosity of\r\nthe right reverend prelates to their brother may be explained in the\r\nsame way.”\r\n\r\nAtterbury took leave of those whom he loved with a dignity and\r\ntenderness worthy of a better man. Three fine lines of his favourite\r\npoet were often in his mouth:\r\n\r\n               “Some natural tears he dropped, but wiped them soon:\r\n\r\n               The world was all before him, where to chuse\r\n\r\n               His place of rest, and Providence his guide.”\r\n\r\nAt parting he presented Pope with a Bible, and said, with a\r\ndisingenuousness of which no man who had studied the Bible to much\r\npurpose would have been guilty: “If ever you learn that I have any\r\ndealings with the Pretender, I give you leave to say that my punishment\r\nis just.” Pope at this time really believed the bishop to be an injured\r\nman. Arbuthnot seems to have been of the same opinion. Swift, a few\r\nmonths later, ridiculed with great bitterness, in the “Voyage to\r\nLaputa,” the evidence which had satisfied the two Houses of Parliament.\r\nSoon, however, the most partial friends of the banished prelate ceased\r\nto assert his innocence, and contented themselves with lamenting and\r\nexcusing what they could not defend. After a short stay at Brussels, he\r\nhad taken up his abode at Paris, and had become the leading man among\r\nthe Jacobite refugees who were assembled there. He was invited to Rome\r\nby the Pretender, who then held his mock court under the immediate\r\nprotection of the Pope. But Atterbury felt that a bishop of the Church\r\nof England would be strangely out of place at the Vatican, and declined\r\nthe invitation. During some months, however, he might flatter himself\r\nthat he stood high {129}in the good graces of James. The correspondence\r\nbetween the master and the servant was constant. Atterbury’s merits were\r\nwarmly acknowledged; his advice was respectfully received; and he\r\nwas, as Bolingbroke had found before him, the prime minister of a king\r\nwithout a kingdom. But the new favourite found, as Bolingbroke had found\r\nbefore him, that it was quite as hard to keep the shadow of power\r\nunder a vagrant and mendicant prince as to keep the reality of power at\r\nWestminster. Though James had neither territories nor revenues, neither\r\narmy nor navy, there was more faction and more intrigue among his\r\ncourtiers than among those of his successful rival. Atterbury soon\r\nperceived that his counsels were disregarded, if not distrusted. His\r\nproud spirit was deeply wounded. He quitted Paris, fixed his residence\r\nat Montpellier, gave up politics, and devoted himself entirely to\r\nletters. In the sixth year of his exile he had so severe an illness that\r\nhis daughter, herself in very delicate health, determined to run all\r\nrisks that she might see him once more. Having obtained a license from\r\nthe English Government, she went by sea to Bordeaux, but landed there\r\nin such a state that she could travel only by boat or in a litter. Her\r\nfather, in spite of his infirmities, set out from Montpellier to meet\r\nher; and she, with the impatience which is often the sign of approaching\r\ndeath, hastened towards him. Those who were about her in vain implored\r\nher to travel slowly. She said that every hour was precious, that\r\nshe only wished to see her papa and to die. She met him at Toulouse,\r\nembraced him, received from his hand the sacred bread and wine, and\r\nthanked God that they had passed one day in each other’s society before\r\nthey parted for ever. She died that night.\r\n\r\nIt {130}was some time before even the strong mind of Atterbury recovered\r\nfrom this cruel blow. As soon as he was himself again he became eager\r\nfor action and conflict; for grief, which disposes gentle natures to\r\nretirement, to inaction, and to meditation, only makes restless spirits\r\nmore restless. The Pretender, dull and bigoted as he was, had found out\r\nthat he had not acted wisely in parting with one who, though a heretic,\r\nwas, in abilities and accomplishments, the foremost man of the Jacobite\r\nparty. The bishop was courted back, and was without much difficulty\r\ninduced to return to Paris and to become once more the phantom minister\r\nof a phantom monarchy. But his long and troubled life was drawing to a\r\nclose. To the last, however, his intellect retained all its keenness\r\nand vigour. He learned, in the ninth year of his banishment, that he had\r\nbeen accused by Oldmixon, as dishonest and malignant a scribbler as any\r\nthat has been saved from oblivion by the Dunciad, of having, in concert\r\nwith other Christ-Church men, garbled Clarendon’s History of the\r\nRebellion. The charge, as respected Atterbury, had not the slightest\r\nfoundation: for he was not one of the editors of the History, and never\r\nsaw it till it was printed. He published a short vindication of himself,\r\nwhich is a model in its kind, luminous, temperate, and dignified. A copy\r\nof this little work he sent to the Pretender, with a letter singularly\r\neloquent and graceful. It was impossible, the old man said, that he\r\nshould write anything on such a subject without being reminded of the\r\nresemblance between his own fate and that of Clarendon. They were the\r\nonly two English subjects that had ever been banished from their\r\ncountry and debarred from all communication with their friends by act of\r\nparliament. But here the resemblance ended.\r\n\r\nOne {131}of the exiles had been so happy as to bear a chief part in the\r\nrestoration of the Royal house. All that the other could now do was to\r\ndie asserting the rights of that house to the last. A few weeks after\r\nthis letter was written Atterbury died. He had just completed his\r\nseventieth year.\r\n\r\nHis body was brought to England, and laid, with great privacy, under the\r\nnave of Westminster Abbey. Only three mourners followed the coffin. No\r\ninscription marks the grave. That the epitaph with which Pope honoured\r\nthe memory of his friend does not appear on the walls of the great\r\nnational cemetery is no subject of regret: for nothing worse was ever\r\nwritten by Colley Cibber.\r\n\r\nThose who wish for more complete information about Atterbury may easily\r\ncollect it from his sermons and his controversial writings, from the\r\nreport of the parliamentary proceedings against him, which will be found\r\nin the State Trials, from the five volumes of his correspondence, edited\r\nby Mr. Nichols, and from the first volume of the Stuart papers, edited\r\nby Mr. Glover. A very indulgent but a very interesting account of the\r\nbishop’s political career will be found in Lord Mahon’s valuable History\r\nof England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BUNYAN.\r\n\r\n(_Encyclopaedia Britannica_, May 1854.)\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Bunyan, {132}the most popular religious writer in the English\r\nlanguage, was born at Elstow, about a mile from Bedford, in the year\r\n1628. He may be said to have been born a tinker. The tinkers then formed\r\nan hereditary caste, which was held in no high estimation. They were\r\ngenerally vagrants and pilferers, and were often confounded with the\r\ngipsies, whom in truth they nearly resembled. Bunyan’s father was more\r\nrespectable than most of the tribe. He had a fixed residence, and was\r\nable to send his son to a village school where reading and writing were\r\ntaught.\r\n\r\nThe years of John’s boyhood were those during which the puritan spirit\r\nwas in the highest vigour all over England; and nowhere had that spirit\r\nmore influence than in Bedfordshire. It is not wonderful, therefore,\r\nthat a lad to whom nature had given a powerful imagination, and\r\nsensibility which amounted to a disease, should have been early haunted\r\nby religious terrors. Before he was ten, his sports were interrupted by\r\nfits of remorse and despair; and his sleep was disturbed by dreams\r\nof fiends trying to fly away with him. As he grew older, his mental\r\nconflicts became still more violent. The strong language in which he\r\ndescribed them has strangely misled all his biographers except {133}Mr.\r\nSouthey. It has long been an ordinary practice with pious writers to\r\ncite Bunyan as an instance of the supernatural power of divine grace to\r\nrescue the human soul from the lowest depths of wickedness. He is called\r\nin one book the most notorious of profligates; in another, the brand\r\nplucked from the burning. He is designated in Mr. Ivimey’s History of\r\nthe Baptists as the depraved Bunyan, the wicked tinker of Elstow. Mr.\r\nByland, a man once of great note among the Dissenters, breaks out into\r\nthe following rhapsody:--“No man of common sense and common integrity\r\ncan deny that Bunyan was a practical atheist, a worthless contemptible\r\ninfidel, a vile rebel to God and goodness, a common profligate, a\r\nsoul-despising, a soul-murdering, a soul-damning, thoughtless wretch as\r\ncould exist on the face of the earth. Now be astonished, O heavens, to\r\neternity! and wonder, O earth and hell! while time endures. Behold\r\nthis very man become a miracle of mercy, a mirror of wisdom, goodness,\r\nholiness, truth, and love.” But whoever takes the trouble to examine the\r\nevidence will find that the good men who wrote this had been deceived by\r\na phraseology which, as they had been hearing it and using it all their\r\nlives, they ought to have understood better. There cannot be a greater\r\nmistake than to infer, from the strong expressions in which a devout man\r\nbemoans his exceeding sinfulness, that he has led a worse life than his\r\nneighbours. Many excellent persons, whose moral character from boyhood\r\nto old age has been free from any stain discernible to their fellow\r\ncreatures, have, in their autobiographies and diaries, applied to\r\nthemselves, and doubtless with sincerity, epithets as severe as could\r\nbe applied to Titus Oates or Mrs. Brownrigg. It is quite certain that\r\nBunyan was, at {134}eighteen, what, in any but the most austerely\r\npuritanical circles, would have been considered as a young man of\r\nsingular gravity and innocence. Indeed, it may be remarked that he, like\r\nmany other penitents who, in general terms, acknowledge themselves to\r\nhave been the worst of mankind, fired up and stood vigorously on his\r\ndefence, whenever any particular charge was brought against him by\r\nothers. He declares, it is true, that he had let loose the reins on the\r\nneck of his lusts, that he had delighted in all transgressions against\r\nthe divine law, and that he had been the ringleader of the youth of\r\nElstow in all manner of vice. But, when those who wished him ill accused\r\nhim of licentious amours, he called on God and the angels to attest his\r\npurity. No woman, he said, in heaven, earth, or hell, could charge him\r\nwith having ever made any improper advances to her. Not only had he been\r\nstrictly faithful to his wife; but he had, even before his marriage,\r\nbeen perfectly spotless. It does not appear from his own confessions,\r\nor from the railings of his enemies, that he ever was drunk in his life.\r\nOne bad habit he contracted, that of using profane language; but he\r\ntells us that a single reproof cured him so effectually that he never\r\noffended again. The worst that can be laid to the charge of this poor\r\nyouth, whom it has been the fashion to represent as the most desperate\r\nof reprobates, as a village Rochester, is that he had a great liking\r\nfor some diversions, quite harmless in themselves, but condemned by the\r\nrigid precisians among whom he lived, and for whose opinion he had a\r\ngreat respect. The four chief sins of which he was guilty were dancing,\r\nringing the bells of the parish church, playing at tipcat, and reading\r\nthe History of Sir Bevis of Southampton. A rector of the school of Laud\r\nwould {135}have held such a young man up to the whole parish as a\r\nmodel. But Bunyan’s notions of good and evil had been learned in a very\r\ndifferent school; and he was made miserable by the conflict between his\r\ntastes and his scruples.\r\n\r\nWhen he was about seventeen, the ordinary course of his life was\r\ninterrupted by an event which gave a lasting colour to his thoughts.\r\nHe enlisted in the parliamentary army, and served during the decisive\r\ncampaign of 1645. All that we know of his military career is that, at\r\nthe siege of Leicester, one of his comrades, who had taken his post, was\r\nkilled by a shot from the town. Bnnyan ever after considered himself as\r\nhaving been saved from death by the special interference of Providence.\r\nIt may be observed that his imagination was strongly impressed by the\r\nglimpse which he had caught of the pomp of war. To the last he loved to\r\ndraw his illustrations of sacred things from camps and fortresses, from\r\nguns, drums, trumpets, flags of truce, and regiments arrayed, each under\r\nits own banner. His Greatheart, his Captain Boanerges, and his Captain\r\nCredence, are evidently portraits, of which the originals were among\r\nthose martial saints who fought and expounded in Fairfax’s army.\r\n\r\nIn a few months Bunyan returned home and married. His wife had some\r\npious relations, and brought him as her only portion some pious books.\r\nAnd now his mind, excitable by nature, very imperfectly disciplined\r\nby education, and exposed, without any protection, to the infections\r\nvirulence of the enthusiasm which was then epidemic in England, began\r\nto be fearfully disordered. In outward things he soon became a strict\r\nPharisee. He was constant in attendance at prayers and sermons. His\r\nfavourite amusements were {136}one after another relinquished, though\r\nnot without many painful smuggles. In the middle of a game at tipcat he\r\npaused, and stood staring wildly upwards with his stick in his hand. He\r\nhad heard a voice asking him whether he would leave his sins and go\r\nto heaven, or keep his sins and go to hell; and he had seen an\r\nawful countenance frowning on him from the sky. The odious vice of\r\nbell-ringing he renounced: but he still for a time ventured to so to\r\nthe church tower and look on while others pulled the ropes. But soon the\r\nthought struck him that, if he persisted in such wickedness, the steeple\r\nwould fall on his head; and he fled in terror from the accursed place.\r\nTo give up dancing on the village green was still harder; and some\r\nmonths elapsed before he had the fortitude to part with this darling\r\nsin. When this last sacrifice had been made, he was, even when tried by\r\nthe maxims of that austere time, faultless. All Elstow talked of him as\r\nan eminently pious youth. But his own mind was more unquiet than ever.\r\nHaving nothing more to do in the way of visible reformation, yet finding\r\nin religion no pleasures to supply the place of the juvenile amusements\r\nwhich he had relinquished, he began to apprehend that he lay under some\r\nspecial malediction; and he was tormented by a succession of fantasies\r\nwhich seemed likely to drive him to suicide or to Bedlam.\r\n\r\nAt one time he took it into his head that all persons of Israelite blood\r\nwould be saved, and tried to make out that he partook of that blood; but\r\nhis hopes were speedily destroyed by his father, who seems to have had\r\nno ambition to be regarded as a Jew.\r\n\r\nAt another time Bunyan was disturbed by a strange dilemma: “If I have\r\nnot faith, I am lost; if I have faith, {137}I can work miracles.” He was\r\ntempted to cry to the puddles between Elstow and Bedford, “Be ye dry,”\r\n and to stake his eternal hopes on the event.\r\n\r\nThen he took up a notion that the day of grace for Bedford and the\r\nneighbouring villages was past; that all who were to be saved in that\r\npart of England were already converted; and that he had begun to pray\r\nand strive some months too late.\r\n\r\nThen he was harassed by doubts whether the Turks were not in the right,\r\nand the Christians in the wrong. Then he was troubled by a maniacal\r\nimpulse which prompted him to pray to the trees, to a broomstick, to\r\nthe parish bull. As yet, however, he was only entering the Valley of the\r\nShadow of Death. Soon the darkness grew thicker. Hideous forms floated\r\nbefore him. Sounds of cursing and wailing were in his ears. His way ran\r\nthrough stench and fire, close to the mouth of the bottomless pit. He\r\nbegan to be haunted by a strange curiosity about the unpardonable sin,\r\nand by a morbid longing to commit it. But the most frightful of all the\r\nforms which his disease took was a propensity to utter blasphemy, and\r\nespecially to renounce his share in the benefits of the redemption.\r\nNight and day, in bed, at table, at work, evil spirits, as he imagined,\r\nwere repeating close to his ear the words, “Sell him, sell him.” He\r\nstruck at the hobgoblins; he pushed them from him; but still they were\r\never at his side. He cried out in answer to them, hour after hour:\r\n“Never, never; not for thousands of worlds; not for thousands.” At\r\nlength, worn out by this long agony, he suffered the fatal words to\r\nescape him, “Let him go, if he will.” Then his misery became more\r\nfearful than ever. He had done what could not be forgiven. He had\r\nforfeited his part of {138}the great sacrifice. Like Esau, he had\r\nsold his birthright; and there was no longer any place for repentance.\r\n“None,” he afterwards wrote, “knows the terrors of those days but\r\nmyself.” he has described his sufferings with singular energy,\r\nsimplicity, and pathos, he envied the brutes; he envied the very stones\r\nin the street, and the tiles on the houses. The sun seemed to withhold\r\nits light and warmth from him. His body, though cast in a sturdy mould,\r\nand though still in the highest vigour of youth, trembled whole days\r\ntogether with the fear of death and judgment. He fancied that this\r\ntrembling was the sign set on the worst reprobates, the sign which\r\nGod had put on Cain. The unhappy man’s emotion destroyed his power of\r\ndigestion. He had such pains that he expected to burst asunder like\r\nJudas, whom he regarded as his prototype.\r\n\r\nNeither the books which Bunyan read, nor the advisers whom he consulted,\r\nwere likely to do much good in a case like his. His small library had\r\nreceived a most unseasonable addition, the account of the lamentable\r\nend of Francis Spira. One ancient man of high repute for piety, whom the\r\nsufferer consulted, gave an opinion which might well have produced fatal\r\nconsequences. “I am afraid,” said Bunyan, “that I have committed the sin\r\nagainst the Holy Ghost.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said the old fanatic, “I am afraid that you have.”\r\n\r\nAt length the clouds broke; the light became clearer and clearer; and\r\nthe enthusiast, who had imagined that he was branded with the mark of\r\nthe first murderer, and destined to the end of the arch traitor, enjoyed\r\npeace and a cheerful confidence in the mercy of God. Years elapsed,\r\nhowever, before his nerves, which had been so perilously overstrained,\r\nrecovered their tone.\r\n\r\nWhen {139}he had joined a Baptist society at Bedford, and was for the\r\nfirst time admitted to partake of the Eucharist, it was with difficulty\r\nthat he could refrain from imprecating destruction on his brethren while\r\nthe cup was passing from hand to hand. After he had been some time a\r\nmember of the congregation, he began to preach; and his sermons produced\r\na powerful effect. He was indeed illiterate; but he spoke to illiterate\r\nmen. The severe training through which he had passed had given him such\r\nan experimental knowledge of all the modes of religious melancholy as he\r\ncould never have gathered from books; and his vigorous genius, animated\r\nby a fervent spirit of devotion, enabled him, not only to exercise\r\na great influence over the vulgar, but even to extort the half\r\ncontemptuous admiration of scholars. Yet it was long before he ceased\r\nto be tormented by an impulse which urged him to utter words of horrible\r\nimpiety in the pulpit.\r\n\r\nCounter-irritants are of as great use in moral as in physical diseases.\r\nIt should seem that Bunyan was finally relieved from the internal\r\nsufferings which had embittered his life by sharp persecution from\r\nwithout. He had been five years a preacher, when the Restoration put\r\nit in the power of the Cavalier gentlemen and clergymen all over the\r\ncountry to oppress the Dissenters; and, of all the Dissenters whose\r\nhistory is known to us, he was perhaps the most hardly treated. In\r\nNovember 1660, he was flung into Bedford gaol; and there he remained,\r\nwith some intervals of partial and precarious liberty, during twelve\r\nyears. His persecutors tried to extort from him a promise that he would\r\nabstain from preaching; but he was convinced that he was divinely set\r\napart and commissioned to be a teacher of righteousness: and he was\r\nfully {140}determined to obey God rather than man. He was brought before\r\nseveral tribunals, laughed at, caressed, reviled, menaced, but in vain.\r\nHe was facetiously told that he was quite right in thinking that\r\nhe ought not to hide his gift: but that his real gift was skill in\r\nrepairing old kettles. He was compared to Alexander the coppersmith.\r\nhe was told that, if he would give up preaching, he should be instantly\r\nliberated. He was warned that, if he persisted in disobeying the law,\r\nhe would be liable to banishment, and that, if he were found in England\r\nafter a certain time, his neck would be stretched. His answer was, “If\r\nyou let me out to-day, I will preach again tomorrow.” Year after year he\r\nlay patiently in a dungeon, compared with which the worst prison now\r\nto be found in the island is a palace. His fortitude is the more\r\nextraordinary, because his domestic feelings were unusually strong.\r\nIndeed, he was considered by his stern brethren as somewhat too fond\r\nand indulgent a parent. He had several small children, and among them a\r\ndaughter who was blind, and whom he loved with peculiar tenderness. He\r\ncould not, he said, bear even to let the wind blow on her; and now she\r\nmust suffer cold and hunger: she must beg; she must be beaten; “yet,”\r\n he added, “I must, I must do it.” While he lay in prison he could do\r\nnothing in the way of his old trade for the support of his family. He\r\ndetermined, therefore, to take up a new trade. He learned to make long\r\ntagged thread laces; and many thousands of these articles were furnished\r\nby him to the hawkers. While his hands were thus busied, he had other\r\nemployment for his mind and his lips. He gave religious instruction to\r\nhis fellow-captives, and formed from among them a little flock, of which\r\nhe {141}was himself the pastor. He studied indefatigably the few books\r\nwhich he possessed. His two chief companions were the Bible and Fox’s\r\nBook of Martyrs. His knowledge of the Bible was such that he might have\r\nbeen called a living concordance; and on the margin of his copy of the\r\nBook of Martyrs are still legible the ill spelt lines of doggrel in\r\nwhich he expressed his reverence for the brave sufferers, and his\r\nimplacable enmity to the mystical Babylon.\r\n\r\nAt length he began to write; and, though it was some time before he\r\ndiscovered where his strength lay, his writings were not unsuccessful.\r\nThey were coarse, indeed; but they showed a keen mother wit, a great\r\ncommand of the homely mother tongue, an intimate knowledge of the\r\nEnglish Bible, and a vast and dearly bought spiritual experience. They\r\ntherefore, when the corrector of the press had improved the syntax and\r\nthe spelling, were well received by the humbler class of Dissenters.\r\n\r\nMuch of Bunyan’s time was spent in controversy. He wrote sharply against\r\nthe Quakers, whom he seems always to have held in utter abhorrence. It\r\nis, however, a remarkable fact that he adopted one of their peculiar\r\nfashions: his practice was to write, not November or December, but\r\neleventh month and twelfth month.\r\n\r\nHe wrote against the liturgy of the Church of England. No two things,\r\naccording to him, had less affinity than the form of prayer and the\r\nspirit of prayer. Those, he said with much point, who have most of the\r\nspirit of prayer are all to be found in gaol; and those who have most\r\nzeal for the form of prayer are all to be found at the alehouse. The\r\ndoctrinal articles, on the other hand, he warmly praised, and defended\r\nagainst some {142}Arminian clergymen who had signed them. The most\r\nacrimonious of all his works is his answer to Edward Fowler, afterwards\r\nBishop of Gloucester, an excellent man, but not free from the taint of\r\nPelagianisin.\r\n\r\nBanyan had also a dispute with some of the chiefs of the sect to which\r\nhe belonged. He doubtless held with perfect sincerity the distinguishing\r\ntenet of that sect; but he did not consider that tenet as one of high\r\nimportance, and willingly joined in communion with quiet Presbyterians\r\nand Independents. The sterner Baptists, therefore, loudly pronounced him\r\na false brother. A controversy arose which long survived the original\r\ncombatants. In our own time the cause which Bunyan had defended with\r\nrude logic and rhetoric against Kiffin and Danvers was pleaded by Robert\r\nHall with an ingenuity and eloquence such as no polemical Writer has\r\never surpassed.\r\n\r\nDuring the years which immediately followed the\r\n\r\nRestoration, Bunyan’s confinement seems to have been strict. But, as the\r\npassions of 1660 cooled, as the hatred with which the Puritans had been\r\nregarded while their reign was recent gave place to pity, he was less\r\nand less harshly treated. The distress of his family, and his own\r\npatience, courage, and piety softened the hearts of his persecutors.\r\nLike his own Christian in the cage, he found protectors even among the\r\ncrowd of Vanity Fair. The bishop of the diocese, Dr. Barlow, is said\r\nto have interceded for him. At length the prisoner was suffered to\r\npass most of his time beyond the walls of the gaol, on condition, as it\r\nshould seem, that he remained within the town of Bedford.\r\n\r\nHe owed his complete liberation to one of the worst acts of one of the\r\nworst governments that England has ever {143}seen. In 1671 the Cabal was\r\nin power. Charles II. had concluded the treaty by which he bound himself\r\nto set up the Roman Catholic religion in England. The first step which\r\nhe took towards that end was to annul, by an unconstitutional exercise\r\nof his prerogative, all the penal statutes against the Roman Catholics;\r\nand, in order to disguise his real design, he annulled at the same\r\ntime the penal statutes against Protestant nonconformists. Bunyan was\r\nconsequently set at large. In the first warmth of his gratitude he\r\npublished a tract in which he compared Charles to that humane and\r\ngenerous Persian king who, though not himself blessed with the light of\r\nthe true religion, favoured the chosen people, and permitted them, after\r\nyears of captivity, to rebuild their beloved temple. To candid men, who\r\nconsider how much Bunyan had suffered, and how little he could guess the\r\nsecret designs of the court, the unsuspicious thankfulness with which\r\nhe accepted the precious boon of freedom will not appear to require any\r\napology.\r\n\r\nBefore he left his prison he had begun the book which has made his nane\r\nimmortal. The history of that book is remarkable. The author was, as he\r\ntells us, writing a treatise, in which he had occasion to speak of the\r\nstages of the Christian progress. He compared that progress, as many\r\nothers had compared it, to a pilgrimage. Soon his quick wit discovered\r\ninnumerable points of similarity which had escaped his predecessors.\r\nImams came crowding on his mind faster than he could put them into\r\nwords, quagmires and pits, steep hills, dark and horrible glens, soft\r\nvales, sunny pastures, a gloomy castle of which the courtyard was strewn\r\nwith the skulls and bones of murdered prisoners, a town all bustle and\r\nsplendour, like London on the Lord {144}Mayor’s Day, and the narrow\r\npath, straight as a rule could make it, running on up hill and down\r\nhill, through city and through wilderness, to the Black River and the\r\nShining Gate. He had found out, as most people would have said,\r\nby accident, as he would doubtless have said, by the guidance of\r\nProvidence, where his powers lay. He had no suspicion, indeed, that he\r\nwas producing a masterpiece. He could not guess what place his allegory\r\nwould occupy in English literature; for of English literature he knew\r\nnothing. Those who suppose him to have studied the Fairy Queen might\r\neasily be confuted, if this were the proper place for a detailed\r\nexamination of the passages in which the two allegories have been\r\nthought to resemble each other. The only work of fiction, in all\r\nprobability, with which he could compare his pilgrim, was his old\r\nfavourite, the legend of Sir Bevis of Southampton. He would have thought\r\nit a sin to borrow any time from the serious business of his life, from\r\nhis expositions, his controversies, and his lace tags, for the purpose\r\nof amusing himself with what he considered merely as a trifle. It was\r\nonly, he assures us, at spare moments that he returned to the House\r\nBeautiful, the Delectable Mountains, and the Enchanted Ground. He had no\r\nassistance. Nobody but himself saw a line till the whole was complete.\r\nHe then consulted his pious friends. Some were pleased. Others were\r\nmuch scandalised. It was a vain story, a mere romance, about giants, and\r\nlions, and goblins, and warriors, sometimes fighting with monsters\r\nand sometimes regaled by fair ladies in stately palaces. The loose\r\natheistical wits at Will’s might write such stuff to divert the painted\r\nJezebels of the court: but did it become a minister of the gospel to\r\ncopy the evil fashions of the world? There had {145}been a time when the\r\ncant of such fools would have made Bunyan miserable. But that time was\r\npassed; and his mind was now in a firm and healthy state. He saw that,\r\nin employing fiction to make truth clear and goodness attractive, he\r\nwas only following the example which every Christian ought to propose to\r\nhimself; and he determined to print.\r\n\r\nThe _Pilgrim’s Progress_ stole silently into the world. Not a single\r\ncopy of the first edition is known to be in existence. The year of\r\npublication has not been ascertained. It is probable that, during\r\nsome months, the little volume circulated only among poor and obscure\r\nsectaries. But soon the irresistible charm of a book which gratified\r\nthe imagination of the reader with all the action and scenery of a\r\nfairy tale, which exercised Ins ingenuity by setting him to discover a\r\nmultitude of curious analogies, which interested his feelings for human\r\nbeings, frail like himself, and struggling with temptations from within\r\nand from without, which every moment drew a smile from him by some\r\nstroke of quaint yet simple pleasantry, and nevertheless left on his\r\nmind a sentiment of reverence for God and of sympathy for man, began to\r\nproduce its effect. In puritanical circles, from which plays and novels\r\nwere strictly excluded, that effect was such as no work of genius,\r\nthough it were superior to the Iliad, to Don Quixote, or to Othello, can\r\never produce on a mind accustomed to indulge in literary luxury. In 1678\r\ncame forth a second edition with additions; and then the demand became\r\nimmense. In the four following years the book was reprinted six times.\r\nThe eighth edition, which contains the last improvements made by the\r\nauthor, was published in 1682, the ninth in 1684, the tenth in 1685.\r\nThe help of the engraver had early been {146}called in; and tens of\r\nthousands of children looked with terror and delight on execrable\r\ncopperplates, which represented Christian thrusting his sword into\r\nApollyon, or writhing in the grasp of Giant Despair. In Scotland, and\r\nin some of the colonies, the Pilgrim was even more popular than in his\r\nnative country. Bunyan has told us, with very pardonable vanity, that\r\nin New England his dream was the daily subject of the conversation of\r\nthousands, and was thought worthy to appear in the most superb binding.\r\nHe had numerous admirers in Holland, and amoung the Huegonots of France.\r\nWith the pleasures, however, he experienced some of the pains of\r\neminence. Knavish booksellers put forth volumes of trash under his name;\r\nand envious scribblers maintained it to be impossible that the poor\r\nignorant tinker should really be the author of the book which was called\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nHe took the best way to confound both those who counterfeited him and\r\nthose who slandered him. He continued to work the gold-field which he\r\nhad discovered, and to draw from it new treasures, not indeed with quite\r\nsuch ease and in quite such abundance as when the precious soil was\r\nstill virgin, but yet with success which left all competition far\r\nbehind. In 1684 appeared the second part of the “Pilgrim’s Progress.” It\r\nwas soon followed by the “Holy War,” which, if the “Pilgrim’s Progress”\r\n did not exist, would be the best allegory that ever was written.\r\n\r\nBunyan’s place in society was now very different from what it had been.\r\nThere had been a time when many Dissenting ministers, who could talk\r\nLatin and read Greek, had affected to treat him with scorn. But his\r\nfame and influence now far exceeded theirs. He had so great an authority\r\namong the Baptists that he was popularly {147}called Bishop Banyan. His\r\nepiscopal visitations were annual. From Bedford he rode every year to\r\nLondon, and preached there to large and attentive congregations. From\r\nLondon he went his circuit through the country, animating the zeal of\r\nhis brethren, collecting and distributing alms, and making up quarrels.\r\nThe magistrates seem in general to have given him little trouble. But\r\nthere is reason to believe that, in the year 1685, he was in some danger\r\nof again occupying his old quarters in Bedford gaol. In that year the\r\nrash and wicked enterprise of Monmouth gave the Government a pretext for\r\nprosecuting the Nonconformists; and scarcely one eminent divine of the\r\nPresbyterian, Independent, or Baptist persuasion remained unmolested.\r\nBaxter was in prison: Howe was driven into exile: Henry was arrested.\r\nTwo eminent Baptists, with whom Bunyan had been engaged in controversy,\r\nwere in great peril and distress. Danvers was in danger of being hanged:\r\nand Kiffin’s grandsons were actually hanged. The tradition is that,\r\nduring those evil days, Bunyan was forced to disguise himself as a\r\nwaggoner, and that he preached to his congregation at Bedford in a\r\nsmock-frock, with a cart-whip in his hand. But soon a great change took\r\nplace. James the Second was at open war with the church, and found\r\nit necessary to court the Dissenters. Some of the creatures of the\r\ngovernment tried to secure the aid of Bunyan. They probably knew that\r\nhe had written in praise of the indulgence of 1672, and therefore\r\nhoped that he might be equally pleased with the indulgence of 1687. But\r\nfifteen years of thought, observation, and commerce with the world\r\nhad made him wiser. Nor were the cases exactly parallel. Charles was a\r\nprofessed Protestant: James was a {148}professed Papist. The object of\r\nCharles’s indulgence was disguised: the object of James’s indulgence\r\nwas patent. Bunyan was not deceived, he exhorted his hearers to prepare\r\nthemselves by fasting and prayer for the danger which menaced their\r\ncivil and religious liberties, and refused even to speak to the courtier\r\nwho came down to remodel the corporation of Bedford, and who, as was\r\nsupposed, had it in charge to offer some municipal dignity to the Bishop\r\nof the Baptists.\r\n\r\nBunyan did not live to see the Revolution. In the summer of 1688 he\r\nundertook to plead the cause of a son with an angry father, and at\r\nlength prevailed on the old man not to disinherit the young one. This\r\ngood work cost the benevolent intercessor his life. He had to ride\r\nthrough heavy rain. He came drenched to his lodgings on Snow Hill, was\r\nseized with a violent fever, and died in a few days. He was buried in\r\nBunhill Fields; and the spot where he lies is still regarded by the\r\nNonconformists with a feeling which, seems scarcely in harmony with the\r\nstern spirit of their theology. Many puritans, to whom the respect paid\r\nby Roman Catholics to the reliques and tombs of saints seemed childish\r\nor sinful, are said to have begged with their dying breath that their\r\ncoffins might be placed as near as possible to the coffin of the author\r\nof the “Pilgrim’s Progress.”\r\n\r\nThe fame of Bunyan during his life, and during the century which\r\nfollowed his death, was indeed great, but was almost entirely confined\r\nto religious families of the middle and lower classes. Very seldom\r\nwas he during that time mentioned with respect by any writer of great\r\nliterary eminence. Young coupled his prose with the poetry of the\r\nwretched D’Urfey. In the Spiritual Quixote, the adventures of\r\nChristian are ranked {149}with those of Jack the Giant-Killer and John\r\nHickathrift. Cowper ventured to praise the great allegorist, but did\r\nnot venture to name him. It is a significant circumstance that, till\r\na recent period, all the numerous editions of the “Pilgrim’s Progress”\r\n were evidently meant for the cottage and the servants’ hall. The paper,\r\nthe printing, the plates, were all of the meanest description. In\r\ngeneral, when the educated minority and the common people differ about\r\nthe merit of a book, the opinion of the educated minority finally\r\nprevails. The “Pilgrim’s Progress” is perhaps the only book about which,\r\nafter the lapse of a hundred years, the educated minority has come over\r\nto the opinion of the common people.\r\n\r\nThe attempts which have been made to improve and to imitate this book\r\nare not to be numbered. It has been done into verse: it has been\r\ndone into modern English. “The Pilgrimage of Tender Conscience,” the\r\n“Pilgrimage of Good Intent,” “The Pilgrimage of Seek Truth,” “The\r\nPilgrimage of Theophilus,” “The Infant Pilgrim,” “The Hindoo Pilgrim,”\r\n are among the many feeble copies of the great original. But the peculiar\r\nglory of Bunyan is that those who most hated his doctrines have tried to\r\nborrow the help of his genius. A Catholic version of his parable may be\r\nseen with the head of the Virgin in the title page. On the other hand,\r\nthose Antinomians for whom his Calvinism is not strong enough may study\r\nthe pilgrimage of Hephzibah, in which nothing will be found which can be\r\nconstrued into an admission of free agency and universal redemption. But\r\nthe most extraordinary of all the acts of Vandalism by which a fine work\r\nof art was ever defaced was committed so late as the year 1853. It was\r\ndetermined to transform {150}the “Pilgrim’s Progress” into a Tractarian\r\nbook. The task was not easy: for it was necessary to make the two\r\nsacraments the most prominent objects in the allegory; and of all\r\nChristian theologians, avowed Quakers excepted, Bunyan was the one in\r\nwhose system the sacraments held the least prominent place. However,\r\nthe Wicket Gate became a type of Baptism, and the House Beautiful of the\r\nEucharist. The effect of this change is such as assuredly the ingenious\r\nperson who made it never contemplated. For, as not a single pilgrim\r\npasses through the Wicket Gate in infancy, and as Faithful hurries past\r\nthe House Beautiful without stopping, the lesson, which the fable in its\r\naltered shape teaches, is that none but adults ought to be baptized, and\r\nthat the Eucharist may safely be neglected. Nobody would have discovered\r\nfrom the original “Pilgrim’s Progress” that the author was not a\r\nPædobaptist. To turn his book into a book against Pædobaptism was an\r\nachievement reserved for an Anglo-Catholic divine. Such blunders must\r\nnecessarily be committed by every man who mutilates parts of a great\r\nwork, without taking a comprehensive view of the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLIVER GOLDSMITH.\r\n\r\n(_Encyclopaedia Britannica_, February 1856.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOliver Goldsmith, {151}one of the most pleasing English writers of the\r\neighteenth century. He was of a Protestant and Saxon family which had\r\nbeen long settled in Ireland, and which had, like most other Protestant\r\nand Saxon families, been, in troubled times, harassed and put in fear\r\nby the native population. His father, Charles Goldsmith, studied in the\r\nreign of Queen Anne at the diocesan school of Elphin, became attached to\r\nthe daughter of the schoolmaster, married her, took orders, and settled\r\nat a place called Pallas in the county of Longford. There he with\r\ndifficulty supported his wife and children on what he could earn, partly\r\nas a curate and partly as a farmer.\r\n\r\nAt Pallas Oliver Goldsmith was born in November 1728. The spot was then,\r\nfor all practical purposes, almost as remote from the busy and splendid\r\ncapital in which his later years were passed, as any clearing in Upper\r\nCanada or any sheep-walk in Australasia now is. Even at this day those\r\nenthusiasts who venture to make a pilgrimage to the birthplace of the\r\npoet are forced to perform the latter part of their journey on foot.\r\nThe hamlet lies far from any high road, on a dreary plain which, in wet\r\nweather, is often a lake. {152}The lanes would break any jaunting ear to\r\npieces; and there are ruts and sloughs through which the most strongly\r\nbuilt wheels cannot be dragged.\r\n\r\nWhile Oliver was still a child, his father was presented to a living\r\nworth about 200l. a year, in the county of Westmeath. The family\r\naccordingly quitted their cottage in the wilderness for a spacious\r\nhouse on a frequented road, near the village of Lissoy. Here the boy was\r\ntaught his letters by a maid-servant, and was sent in his seventh\r\nyear to a village school kept by an old quartermaster on half-pay, who\r\nprofessed to teach nothing but reading, writing and arithmetic, but who\r\nhad an inexhaustible fund of stories about ghosts, banshees and fairies,\r\nabout the great Rapparee chiefs, Baldearg O’Donnell and galloping Hogan,\r\nand about the exploits of Peterborough and Stanhope, the surprise of\r\nMonjuich, and the glorious disaster of Brihuega.\r\n\r\nThis man must have been of the Protestant religion; but he was of the\r\naboriginal race, and not only spoke the Irish language, but could pour\r\nforth unpremeditated Irish verses. Oliver early became, and through life\r\ncontinued to be, a passionate admirer of the Irish music, and especially\r\nof the compositions of Carolan, some of the last notes of whose harp\r\nhe heard. It ought to be added that Oliver, though by birth one of the\r\nEnglishry, and though connected by numerous ties with the Established\r\nChurch, never showed the least sign of that contemptuous antipathy\r\nwith which, in his days, the ruling minority in Ireland too generally\r\nregarded the subject majority. So far indeed was he from sharing in\r\nthe opinions and feelings of the caste to which he belonged, that he\r\nconceived an aversion to the Glorious and Immortal Memory, and, even\r\nwhen George the Third was on the throne, maintained {153}that nothing\r\nbut the restoration of the banished dynasty could save the country.\r\n\r\nFrom the humble academy kept by the old soldier Goldsmith was removed\r\nin his ninth year. He went to several grammar-schools, and acquired some\r\nknowledge of the ancient languages. His life at this time seems to have\r\nbeen far from happy. He had, as appears from the admirable portrait of\r\nhim at Knowle, features harsh even to ugliness. The small-pox had set\r\nits mark on him with more than usual severity. His stature was small,\r\nand his limbs ill put together. Among boys little tenderness is shown to\r\npersonal defects; and the ridicule excited by poor Oliver’s appearance\r\nwas heightened by a peculiar simplicity and a disposition to blunder\r\nwhich he retained to the last. He became the common butt of boys and\r\nmasters, was pointed at as a fright in the play-ground, and flogged as\r\na dunce in the school-room. When he had risen to eminence, those who\r\nhad once derided him ransacked their memory for the events of his early\r\nyears, and recited repartees and couplets which had dropped from him,\r\nand which, though little noticed at the time, were supposed, a quarter\r\nof a century later, to indicate the powers which produced the “Vicar of\r\nWakefield” and the “Deserted Village.”\r\n\r\nIn his seventeenth year Oliver went up to Trinity College, Dublin, as a\r\nsizar. The sizars paid nothing for food and tuition, and very little for\r\nlodging; but they had to perform some menial services from which they\r\nhave long been relieved. They swept the court: they carried up the\r\ndinner to the fellows’ table, and changed the plates and poured out the\r\nale of the rulers of the society. Goldsmith was quartered, not alone, in\r\na garret, on the window of which {154}his name, scrawled by himself, is\r\nstill read with interest. (1) From such garrots many men of less parts\r\nthan his have made their way to the wool-sack or to the episcopal bench.\r\nBut Goldsmith, while he suffered all the humiliations, threw away all\r\nthe advantages, of his situation. He neglected the studies of the place,\r\nstood low at the examinations, was turned down to the bottom of\r\nhis class for playing the buffoon in the lecture room, was severely\r\nreprimanded for pumping on a constable, and was caned by a brutal tutor\r\nfor giving a ball in the attic story of the college to some gay youths\r\nand damsels from the city.\r\n\r\nWhile Oliver was leading at Dublin a life divided between squalid\r\ndistress and squalid dissipation, his father died, leaving a mere\r\npittance. The youth obtained his bachelor’s degree, and left the\r\nuniversity. Durum some time the humble dwelling to which his widowed\r\nmother had retired was his home. He was now in his twenty-first year; it\r\nwas necessary that he should do something; and his education seemed to\r\nhave fitted him to do nothing but to dress himself in gaudy colours, of\r\nwhich he was as fond as a magpie, to take a hand at cards, to sing Irish\r\nairs, to play the flute, to angle in summer, and to tell ghost stories\r\nby the fire in winter. He tried five or six professions in turn without\r\nsuccess. He applied for ordination; but, as he applied in scarlet\r\nclothes, he was speedily turned out of the episcopal palace. He then\r\nbecame tutor in an opulent family, but soon quitted his situation in\r\nconsequence of a dispute about play. Then he determined\r\n\r\n     (1) The glass on which the name is written has, as we are\r\n     informed by a writer in _Notes and Queries_ (2nd S. ix. p.\r\n     91), been inclosed in a frame and deposited in the\r\n     Manuscript Room of the College Library, where it is still to\r\n     be seen.\r\n\r\nto {155}emigrate to America. His relations, with much satisfaction, saw\r\nhim set out for Cork on a good horse, with thirty pounds in his pocket.\r\nBut in six weeks he came back on a miserable hack, without a penny, and\r\ninformed his mother that the ship in which he had taken his passage,\r\nhaving got a fair wind while he was at a party of pleasure, had sailed\r\nwithout him. Then he resolved to study the law. A generous kinsman\r\nadvanced fifty pounds. With this sum Goldsmith went to Dublin, was\r\nenticed into a gaming house, and lost every shilling. He then thought\r\nof medicine. A small purse was made up; and in his twenty-fourth year he\r\nwas sent to Edinburgh. At Edinburgh he passed eighteen months in nominal\r\nattendance on lectures, and picked up some superficial information\r\nabout chemistry and natural history. Thence he went to Leyden, still\r\npretending to study physic. He left that celebrated university, the\r\nthird university at which he had resided, in his twenty-seventh year,\r\nwithout a degree, with the merest smattering of medical knowledge, and\r\nwith no property but his clothes and his flute. His flute, however,\r\nproved a useful friend. He rambled on foot through Flanders, France, and\r\nSwitzerland, playing tunes which everywhere set the peasantry dancing,\r\nand which often procured for him a supper and a bed. He wandered as far\r\nas Italy. His musical performances, indeed, were not to the taste of\r\nthe Italians; but he contrived to live on the alms whieh he obtained at\r\nthe gates of convents. It should, however, be observed that the stories\r\nwhich he told about this part of his life ought to be received with\r\ngreat caution; for strict veracity was never one of his virtues; and a\r\nman who is ordinarily inaccurate in narration is likely to be more\r\nthan ordinarily inaccurate when he talks about his {156}own travels.\r\nGoldsmith, indeed, was so regardless of truth as to assert in print that\r\nhe was present at a most interesting conversation between Voltaire and\r\nFoutenelle, and that this conversation took place at Paris. Now it is\r\ncertain that Voltaire never was within a hundred leagues of Paris during\r\nthe whole time which Goldsmith passed on the Continent.\r\n\r\nIn 1756 the wanderer landed at Dover, without a shilling, without a\r\nfriend, and without a calling. He had, indeed, if his own unsupported\r\nevidence may be trusted, obtained from the university of Padua a\r\ndoctor’s degree; but this dignity proved utterly useless to him. In\r\nEngland his flute was not in request: there were no convents; and he was\r\nforced to have recourse to a series of desperate expedients. He turned\r\nstrolling player; but his face and figure were ill suited to the boards\r\neven of the humblest theatre. He pounded drugs and ran about London with\r\nphials for charitable chemists. He joined a swarm of beggars, which made\r\nits nest in Axe Yard. He was for a time usher of a school, and felt the\r\nmiseries and humiliations of this situation so keenly that he thought\r\nit a promotion to be permitted to earn his bread as a bookseller’s hack;\r\nbut he soon found the new yoke more galling than the old one, and was\r\nglad to become an usher again. He obtained a medical appointment in\r\nthe service of the East India Company; but the appointment was speedily\r\nrevoked. Why it was revoked we are not told. The subject was one on\r\nwhich he never liked to talk. It is probable that he was incompetent to\r\nperform the duties of the place. Then he presented himself at Surgeons’\r\nHall for examination, as mate to a naval hospital. Even to so humble\r\na post he was found unequal. By this time the schoolmaster whom he had\r\nserved for a morsel {157}of food and the third part of a bed was\r\nno more. Nothing remained but to return to the lowest drudgery of\r\nliterature. Goldsmith took a garret in a miserable court, to which\r\nhe had to climb from the brink of Fleet Ditch by a dizzy ladder of\r\nflag-stones called Breakneck Steps. The court and the ascent have long\r\ndisappeared; but old Londoners will remember both. (1) Here, at thirty,\r\nthe unlucky adventurer sat down to toil like a galley slave.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding six years he sent to the press some things which have\r\nsurvived and many which have perished. He produced articles for reviews,\r\nmagazines, and newspapers: children’s books which, bound in gilt paper\r\nand adorned with hideous woodcuts, appeared in the window of the once\r\nfar-finned shop at the corner of St. Paul’s Churchyard; “An Inquiry into\r\nthe State of Polite Learning in Europe,” which, though of little or no\r\nvalue, is still reprinted among his works; a “Life of Beau Nash,” which\r\nis not reprinted, though it well deserves to be so; (2) a superficial\r\nand incorrect, but very readable, “History of England,” in a series of\r\nletters purporting to be addressed by a nobleman to his son; and some\r\nvery lively and amusing “Sketches of London Society,” in a series\r\nof letters purporting to be addressed by a Chinese traveller to his\r\nfriends. All these works were anonymous; but some of them were\r\n\r\n     (1) A gentleman, who states that he has known the\r\n     neighbourhood for thirty years, corrects this account, and\r\n     informs the present publisher that the Breakneck Steps,\r\n     thirty-two in number, divided into two flights, are still in\r\n     existence, and that, according to tradition, Goldsmith’s\r\n     house was not on the steps, but was the first house at the\r\n     head of the court, on the left hand, going from the Old\r\n     Bailey. See _Notes and Queries_ (2nd S. ix. 280).\r\n\r\n     (2) Mr. Black has pointed out that this is inaccurate: the\r\n     life of Nash has been twice reprinted; once in  Mr. Prior’s\r\n     edition (vol. iii. p. 249), and once in Mr. Cunningham’s\r\n     edition (vol. iv. p. 351.\r\n\r\nwell {158}known to be Goldsmith’s: and he gradually rose in the\r\nestimation of the booksellers for whom he drudged. He was, indeed,\r\nemphatically a popular writer. For accurate research or grave\r\ndisquisition he was not well qualified by nature or by education, he\r\nknew nothing accurately: his reading had been desultory; nor had he\r\nmeditated deeply on what he had read. He had seen much of the world; but\r\nhe had noticed and retained little more of what he had seen than some\r\ngrotesque incidents and characters which had happened to strike his\r\nfancy. But, though his mind was very scantily stored with materials,\r\nhe used what materials he had in such a way as to produce a wonderful\r\neffect. There have been many greater writers; but perhaps no writer was\r\never more uniformly agreeable. His style was always pure and easy, and,\r\non proper occasions, pointed and energetic. His narratives were always\r\namusing, his descriptions always picturesque, his humour rich and\r\njoyous, yet not without an occasional tinge of amiable sadness. About\r\neverything that he wrote, serious or sportive, there was a certain\r\nnatural grace and decorum, hardly to be expected from a man a great part\r\nof whose life had been passed among thieves and beggars, street-walkers\r\nand merry andrews, in those squalid dens which are the reproach of great\r\ncapitals.\r\n\r\nAs his name gradually became known, the circle of his acquaintance\r\nwidened. He was introduced to Johnson, who was then considered as the\r\nfirst of living English writers; to Reynolds, the first of English\r\npainters; and to Burke, who had not yet entered parliament, but had\r\ndistinguished himself greatly by his writings and by the eloquence of\r\nhis conversation. With these eminent men Goldsmith became intimate. In\r\n1763 he was {159}one of the nine original members of that celebrated\r\nfraternity which has sometimes been called the Literary Club, but which\r\nhas always disclaimed that epithet, and still glories in the simple name\r\nof The Club.\r\n\r\nBy this time Goldsmith had quitted his miserable dwelling at the top of\r\nBreakneck Steps, and had taken chambers in the more civilised region of\r\nthe Inns of Court. But he was still often reduced to pitiable shifts.\r\nTowards the close of 1764 his rent was so long in arrear that his\r\nlandlady one morning called in the help of a sheriff’s officer. The\r\ndebtor, in great perplexity, despatched a messenger to Johnson; and\r\nJohnson, always friendly, though often surly, sent back the messenger\r\nwith a guinea, and promised to follow speedily. He came, and found that\r\nGoldsmith had changed the guinea, and was railing at the landlady over\r\na bottle of Madeira. Johnson put the cork into the bottle, and entreated\r\nhis friend to consider calmly how money was to be procured. Goldsmith\r\nsaid that he had a novel ready for the press. Johnson glanced at\r\nthe manuscript, saw that there were good things in it, took it to a\r\nbookseller, sold it for 60l, and soon returned with the money. The rent\r\nwas paid; and the sheriff’s officer withdrew. According to one story,\r\nGoldsmith gave his landlady a sharp reprimand for her treatment of him;\r\naccording to another, he insisted on her joining him in a bowl of punch.\r\nBoth stories are probably true. The novel which was thus ushered into\r\nthe world was the “Vicar of Wakefield.”\r\n\r\nBut, before the “Vicar of Wakefield” appeared in print, came the\r\ngreat crisis of Goldsmith’s literary life. In Christmas week, 1764, he\r\npublished a poem, entitled the “Traveller.” It was the first work to\r\nwhich he had {160}put, his name; and it at once raised him to the rank\r\nof a legitimate English classic. The opinion of the most skilful critics\r\nwas, that nothing finer had appeared in verse since the fourth book of\r\nthe “Dunciad.”\r\n\r\nIn one respect the “Traveller” differs from all Goldsmith’s other\r\nwritings. In general his designs were bad, and his execution good. In\r\nthe “Traveller,” the execution, though deserving of much praise, is far\r\ninferior to the design. No philosophical poem, ancient or modern, lias\r\na plan so noble, and at the same time so simple. An English, wanderer,\r\nseated on a crag among the Alps, near the point where three great\r\ncountries meet, looks down on the boundless prospect, reviews his long\r\npilgrimage, recalls the varieties of scenery, of climate, of government,\r\nof religion, of national character, which he has observed, and comes\r\nto the conclusion, just or unjust, that our happiness depends little on\r\npolitical institutions, and much on the temper and regulation of our own\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nWhile the fourth edition of the “Traveller” was on the counters of the\r\nbooksellers, the “Vicar of Wakefield” appeared, and rapidly obtained a\r\npopularity which has lasted down to our own time, and which is likely to\r\nlast as long as our language. The fable is indeed one of the worst that\r\never was constructed. It wants, not merely that probability which ought\r\nto be found in a tale of common English life, but that consistency which\r\nought to be found even in the wildest fiction about witches, giants,\r\nand fairies. But the earlier chapters have all the Sweetness of\r\npastoral poetry, together with all the vivacity of comedy. Moses and his\r\nspectacles, the vicar and his monogamy, the sharper and his cosmogony,\r\nthe squire proving from Aristotle that relatives are related, Olivia\r\npreparing {161}herself for the arduous task of converting a rakish lover\r\nby studying the controversy between Robinson Crusoe and Friday, the\r\ngreat ladies with their scandal about Sir Tomkyn’s amours and Dr.\r\nBurdock’s verses, and Mr. Burchell with his “Fudge,” have caused as much\r\nharmless mirth as has ever been caused by matter packed into so small\r\na number of pages. The latter part of the tale is unworthy of the\r\nbeginning. As we approach the catastrophe, the absurdities lie thicker\r\nand thicker; and the gleams of pleasantry become rarer and rarer.\r\n\r\nThe success which had attended Goldsmith as a novelist emboldened him to\r\ntry his fortune as a dramatist. He wrote the “Goodnatured Man,” a piece\r\nwhich had a worse fate than it deserved. Garrick refused to produce it\r\nat Drury Lane. It was acted at Covent Garden in 1768, but was coldly\r\nreceived. The author, however, cleared by his benefit nights, and by the\r\nsale of the copyright, no less than 500l., five times as much as he had\r\nmade by the “Traveller” and the “Vicar of Wakefield” together. The plot\r\nof the “Good-natured Man” is, like almost all Goldsmith’s plots, very\r\nill constructed. But some passages are exquisitely ludicrous; much more\r\nludicrous, indeed, than suited the taste of the town at that time. A\r\ncanting, mawkish play, entitled “False Delicacy,” had just had an\r\nimmense run. Sentimentality was all the mode. During some years, more\r\ntears were shed at comedies than at tragedies; and a pleasantry which\r\nmoved the audience to anything more than a grave smile was reprobated\r\nas low. It is not strange, therefore, that the very best scene in the\r\n“Goodnatured Man,” that in which Miss Richland finds her lover attended\r\nby the bailiff and the bailiff’s follower in full court dresses, should\r\n{162}have been mercilessly hissed, and should have been omitted after\r\nthe first night.\r\n\r\nIn 1770 appeared the “Deserted Village.” In mere diction and\r\nversification this celebrated poem is fully equal, perhaps superior,\r\nto the “Traveller;” and it is generally preferred to the “Traveller” by\r\nthat large class of readers who think, with Bayes in the “Rehearsal,”\r\n that the only use of a plan is to bring in fine things. More discerning\r\njudges, however, while they admire the beauty of the details, are\r\nshocked by one unpardonable fault which pervades the whole. The fault we\r\nmean is not that theory about wealth and luxury which has so often been\r\ncensured by political economists. The theory is indeed false: but the\r\npoem, considered merely as a poem, is not necessarily the worse on\r\nthat account. The finest poem in the Latin language, indeed the finest\r\ndidactic poem in any language, was written in defence of the silliest\r\nand meanest of all systems of natural and moral philosophy. A poet may\r\neasily be pardoned for reasoning ill; but he cannot be pardoned for\r\ndescribing ill, for observing the world in which he lives so carelessly\r\nthat his portraits bear no resemblance to the originals, for exhibiting\r\nas copies from real life monstrous combinations of things which never\r\nwere and never could be found together. What would be thought of a\r\npainter who should mix August and January in one landscape, who should\r\nintroduce a frozen river into a harvest scene? Would it be a sufficient\r\ndefence of such a picture to say that every part was exquisitely\r\ncoloured, that the green hedges, the apple-trees loaded with fruit, the\r\nwaggons reeling under the yellow sheaves, and the sun-burned reapers\r\nwiping their foreheads, were very fine, and that the ice and the boys\r\nsliding were also very {163}fine? To such a picture the “Deserted\r\nVillage” bears a great resemblance. It is made up of incongruous parts.\r\nThe village in its happy days is a true English village. The village\r\nin its decay is an Irish village. The felicity and the misery which\r\nGoldsmith has brought close together belong to two different countries,\r\nand to two different stages in the progress of society. He had assuredly\r\nnever seen in his native island such a rural paradise, such a seat of\r\nplenty, content, and tranquillity, as his “Auburn.” He had assuredly\r\nnever seen in England all the inhabitants of such a paradise turned out\r\nof their homes in one day and forced to emigrate in a body to America.\r\nThe hamlet he had probably seen in Kent; the ejectment he had probably\r\nseen in Minister: but, by joining the two, he has produced something\r\nwhich never was and never will be seen in any part of the world.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 Goldsmith tried his chance at Covent Garden with a second play,\r\n“She Stoops to Conquer.” The manager was not without great difficulty\r\ninduced to bring this piece out. The sentimental comedy still reigned:\r\nand Goldsmith’s comedies were not sentimental. The “Goodnatured Man” had\r\nbeen too funny to succeed; yet the mirth of the “Goodnatured? Man” was\r\nsober when compared with the rich drollery# of “She Stoops to Conquer,”\r\n which is, in truth, an incomparable farce in five acts. On this\r\noccasion, however, genius triumphed. Pit, boxes, and galleries, were\r\nin a constant roar of laughter. If any bigoted admirer of Kelly and\r\nCumberland ventured to hiss or groan, he was speedily silenced by a\r\ngeneral cry of “turn him out,” or “throw him over.” Two generations have\r\nsince confirmed the verdict which was pronounced on that night.\r\n\r\nWhile {164}Goldsmith was writing the “Deserted Village” and “She Stoops\r\nto Conquer,” he was employed on works of a very different kind, works\r\nfrom which he derived little reputation but much profit, he compiled\r\nfor the use of schools a “History of Rome,” by which he made 300l., a\r\n“History of England,” by which he made 500l., a “History of Greece,”\r\n for which he received 250l., a “Natural History,” for which the\r\nbooksellers covenanted to pay him 800 guineas. These works he produced\r\nwithout any elaborate research, by merely selecting, abridging, and\r\ntranslating into his own clear, pure, and flowing language what he found\r\nin books well known to the world, but too bulky or too dry for boys\r\nand girls. He committed some strange blunders; for he knew nothing with\r\naccuracy. Thus in his “History of England” he tells us that Naseby is in\r\nYorkshire; nor did he correct this mistake when the book was reprinted.\r\nHe was very nearly hoaxed into putting into the “History of Greece” an\r\naccount of a battle between Alexander the Great and Montezuma. In his\r\n“Animated Nature” he relates, with faith and with perfect gravity,\r\nall the most absurd lies which he could find in books of travels about\r\ngigantic Patagonians, monkeys that preach sermons, nightingales that\r\nrepeat long conversations. “If he can tell a horse from a cow,” said\r\nJohnson, “that is the extent of his knowledge of zoology.” How little\r\nGoldsmith was qualified to write about the physical sciences is\r\nsufficiently proved by two anecdotes. He on one occasion denied that the\r\nsun is longer in the northern than in the southern skies. It was vain to\r\ncite the authority of Maupertuis. “Maupertuis!” he cried, “I understand\r\nthose matters better than Maupertuis.” On another occasion he, {165}in\r\ndefiance of the evidence of his own senses, maintained obstinately, and\r\neven angrily, that he chewed his dinner by moving his upper jaw.\r\n\r\nYet, ignorant as Goldsmith was, few writers have done more to make the\r\nfirst steps in the laborious road to knowledge easy and pleasant. His\r\ncompilations are widely distinguished from the compilations of ordinary\r\nbook-makers. He was a great, perhaps an unequalled, master of the arts\r\nof selection and condensation. In these respects his histories of Rome\r\nand of England, and still more his own abridgments of these histories,\r\nwell deserve to be studied. In general nothing is less attractive than\r\nan epitome: but the epitomes of Goldsmith, even when most concise, are\r\nalways amusing; and to read them is considered by intelligent children,\r\nnot as a task, but as a pleasure.\r\n\r\nGoldsmith might now be considered as a prosperous man. He had the means\r\nof living in comfort, and even in what to one who had so often slept\r\nin barns and on bulks must have been luxury. His fame was great and\r\nwas constantly rising. He lived in what was intellectually far the\r\nbest society of the kingdom, in a society in which no talent or\r\naccomplishment was wanting, and in which the art of conversation was\r\ncultivated with splendid success. There probably were never four talkers\r\nmore admirable in four different ways than Johnson, Burke, Beauclerk,\r\nand Garrick; and Goldsmith was on terms of intimacy with all the four.\r\nHe aspired to share in their colloquial renown; but never was ambition\r\nmore unfortunate. It may seem strange that a man who wrote with so much\r\nperspicuity, vivacity, and grace, should have been, whenever he took a\r\npart in conversation, an empty, noisy, blundering rattle. But on this\r\npoint the evidence is overwhelming. {166}So extraordinary was the\r\ncontrast between Goldsmith’s published works and the silly things\r\nwhich he said, that Horace Walpole described him as an inspired idiot.\r\n“Noll,” said Garrick, “wrote like an angel, and talked like poor Pol.”\r\n Charnier declared that it was a hard exercise of faith to believe that\r\nso foolish a chatterer could have really written the “Traveller.” Even\r\nBoswell could say, with contemptuous compassion, that he liked very\r\nwell to hear honest Goldsmith run on. “Yes, sir,” said Johnson; “but he\r\nshould not like to hear himself.” Minds differ as rivers differ. There\r\nare transparent and sparkling rivers from which it is delightful to\r\ndrink as they flow; to such rivers the minds of such men as Burke and\r\nJohnson may be compared. But there are rivers of which the water when\r\nfirst drawn is turbid and noisome, but becomes pellucid as crystal, and\r\ndelicious to the taste, if it be suffered to stand till it has deposited\r\na sediment; and such a river is a type of the mind of Goldsmith. His\r\nfirst thoughts on every subject were confused even to absurdity; but\r\nthey required only a little time to work themselves clear. When he wrote\r\nthey had that time; and therefore his readers pronounced him a man of\r\ngenius: but when he talked he talked nonsense, and made himself\r\nthe laughing-stock of his hearers. He was painfully sensible of his\r\ninferiority in conversation; he felt every failure keenly: yet he had\r\nnot sufficient judgment and self-command to hold his tongue. His animal\r\nspirits and vanity were always impelling him to try to do the one thing\r\nwhieh he could not do. After every attempt he felt that he had exposed\r\nhimself, and writhed with shame and vexation; yet the next moment he\r\nbegan again.\r\n\r\nHis {167}associates seem to have regarded him with kindness, which,\r\nin spite of their admiration of his writings, was not unmixed with\r\ncontempt. In truth, there was in Ins character much to love, but very\r\nlittle to respect. His heart was soft even to weakness: he was so\r\ngenerous that he quite forgot to be just; he forgave injuries so readily\r\nthat he might be said to invite them; and was so liberal to beggars\r\nthat he had nothing left for his tailor and his butcher. He was vain,\r\nsensual, frivolous, profuse, improvident. One vice of a darker shade was\r\nimputed to him, envy. But there is not the least reason to believe that\r\nthis bad passion, though it sometimes made him wince and utter fretful\r\nexclamations, ever impelled him to injure by wicked arts the reputation\r\nof any of his rivals. The truth probably is, that he was not more\r\nenvious, but merely less prudent, than his neighbours. His heart was on\r\nhis lips. All those small jealousies, which are but too common among men\r\nof letters, but which a man of letters who is also a man of the world\r\ndoes his best to conceal, Goldsmith avowed with the simplicity of a\r\nchild. When he was envious, instead of affecting indifference, instead\r\nof damning with faint praise, instead of doing-injuries slily and in the\r\ndark, he told every body that he was envious. “Do not, pray, do not talk\r\nof Johnson in such terms,” he said to Boswell; “you harrow up my very\r\nsoul.” George Steevens and Cumberland were men far too cunning to say\r\nsuch a thing. They would have echoed the praises of the man whom they\r\nenvied, and then have sent to the newspapers anonymous libels upon him.\r\nBoth what was good and what was bad in Goldsmith’s character was to his\r\nassociates a perfect security that he would never commit such villany.\r\nHe was neither ill-natured enough, nor longheaded {168}enough, to be\r\nguilty of any malicious act which required contrivance and disguise.\r\n\r\nGoldsmith has sometimes been represented as a man of genius, cruelly\r\ntreated by the world, and doomed to struggle with difficulties which at\r\nlast broke his heart. But no representation can be more remote from the\r\ntruth. He did, indeed, go through much sharp misery before he had done\r\nanything considerable in literature. But, after his name had appeared on\r\nthe title-page of the “Traveller,” he had none but himself to blame for\r\nhis distresses. His average income, during the last seven years of his\r\nlife, certainly exceeded 400l. a year; and 400l. a year ranked, among\r\nthe incomes of that day, at least as high as 800l. a year would rank at\r\npresent. A single man living in the Temple with 400l. a year might\r\nthen be called opulent. Not one in ten of the young gentlemen of good\r\nfamilies who were studying the law there had so much. But all the wealth\r\nwhich Lord Clive had brought from Bengal, and Sir Lawrence Dundas from\r\nGermany, joined together, would not have sufficed for Goldsmith. He\r\nspent twice as much as he had. He wore fine clothes, gave dinners of\r\nseveral courses, paid court to venal beauties. He had also, it should\r\nbe remembered, to the honour of his heart, though not of his head, a\r\nguinea, or five, or ten, according to the state of his purse, ready\r\nfor any tale of distress, true or false. But it was not in dress or\r\nfeasting, in promiscuous amours or promiscuous charities, that his chief\r\nexpense lay. He had been from boyhood a gambler, and at once the most\r\nsanguine and the most unskilful of gamblers. For a time he put off the\r\nday of inevitable ruin by temporary expedients. He obtained advances\r\nfrom booksellers, by promising to execute works {169}which he never\r\nbegan. But at length this source of supply failed. He owed more than\r\n2000l. and he saw no hope of extrication from his embarrassments. His\r\nspirits and health gave way. He was attacked by a nervous fever, which\r\nhe thought himself competent to treat, It would have been happy for him\r\nif his medical skill had been appreciated as justly by himself as by\r\nothers. Notwithstanding the degree which he pretended to have received\r\nat Padua, he could procure no patients. “I do not practise,” he once\r\nsaid; “I make it a rule to prescribe only for my friends.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, dear Doctor,” said Beauclerk, “alter your rule; and prescribe\r\nonly for your enemies.” Goldsmith now, in spite of this excellent\r\nadvice, prescribed for himself. The remedy aggravated the malady. The\r\nsick man was induced to call in real physicians; and they at one\r\ntime imagined that they had cured the disease. Still his weakness and\r\nrestlessness continued. He could get no sleep. He could take no food.\r\n“You are worse,” said one of his medical attendants, “than you should be\r\nfrom the degree of fever which you have. Is your mind at ease?” “No, it\r\nis not,” were the last recorded words of Oliver Goldsmith. He died on\r\nthe third of April 1774, in his forty-sixth year. He was laid in\r\nthe churchyard of the Temple; but the spot was not marked by any\r\ninscription, and is now forgotten. The coffin was followed by Burke and\r\nReynolds. Both these great men were sincere mourners. Burke, when he\r\nheard of Goldsmith’s death, had burst into a flood of tears. Reynolds\r\nhad been so much moved by the news that he had flung aside his brush and\r\npalette for the day.\r\n\r\nA short time after Goldsmith’s death, a little poem appeared, {170}which\r\nwill, as long as our language lasts, associate the names of his two\r\nillustrious friends with his own. It has already been mentioned that he\r\nsometimes felt keenly the sarcasm which his wild blundering talk brought\r\nupon him. He was, not long before his last illness, provoked into\r\nretaliating. He wisely betook himself to his pen; and at that weapon he\r\nproved himself a match for all his assailants together. Within a\r\nsmall compass he drew with a singularly easy and vigorous pencil the\r\ncharacters of nine or ten of his intimate associates. Though this little\r\nwork did not receive his last touches, it must always be regarded as a\r\nmasterpiece. It is impossible, however, not to wish that four or five\r\nlikenesses which have no interest for posterity were wanting to that\r\nnoble gallery, and that their places were supplied by sketches of\r\nJohnson and Gibbon, as happy and vivid as the sketches of Burke and\r\nGarrick.\r\n\r\nSome of Goldsmith’s friends and admirers honoured him with a cenotaph\r\nin Westminster Abbey. Nollekens was the sculptor; and Johnson wrote the\r\ninscription. It is much to be lamented that Johnson did not leave to\r\nposterity a more durable and a more valuable memorial of his friend. A\r\nlife of Goldsmith would have been an inestimable addition to the Lives\r\nof the Poets. No man appreciated Goldsmith’s writings more justly than\r\nJohnson: no man was better acquainted with Goldsmith’s character and\r\nhabits; and no man was more competent to delineate with truth and spirit\r\nthe peculiarities of a mind in which great powers were found in company\r\nwith great weaknesses. But the list of poets to whose works Johnson was\r\nrequested by the booksellers to furnish prefaces ended with Lyttleton,\r\nwho died in 1773. The line seems to have {171}been drawn expressly for\r\nthe purpose of excluding the person whose portrait would have most\r\nfitly closed the series. Goldsmith, however, has been fortunate in his\r\nbiographers. Within a few years his life has been written by Mr. Prior,\r\nby Mr. Washington Irving, and by Mr. Forster. The diligence of Mr. Prior\r\ndeserves great praise: the style of Mr. Washington Irving is always\r\npleasing; but the highest place must, in justice, be assigned to the\r\neminently interesting work of Mr. Forster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n(_Encyclopodia Britannica_, December 1856.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel Johnson, {172}one of the most eminent English writers of the\r\neighteenth century, was the son of Michael Johnson, who was, at the\r\nbeginning of that century, a magistrate of Lichfield, and a bookseller\r\nof great note in the midland counties. Michael’s abilities and\r\nattainments seem to have been considerable. He was so well acquainted\r\nwith the contents of the volumes which he exposed to sale, that the\r\ncountry rectors of Staffordshire and Worcestershire thought him an\r\noracle on points of learning. Between him and the clergy, indeed,\r\nthere was a strong religious and political sympathy. He was a zealous\r\nchurchman, and, though he had qualified himself for municipal office\r\nby taking the oaths to the sovereigns in possession, was to the last a\r\nJacobite in heart. At his house, a house which is still pointed out to\r\nevery traveller who visits Lichfield, Samuel was born on the 18th of\r\nSeptember 1709. In the child, the physical, intellectual, and moral\r\npeculiarities which afterwards distinguished the man were plainly\r\ndiscernible; great muscular strength accompanied by much awkwardness and\r\nmany infirmities; great quickness of parts, with a morbid propensity to\r\nsloth and procrastination; a kind and generous heart, {173}with a gloomy\r\nand irritable temper. He had inherited from his ancestors a scrofulous\r\ntaint, which it was beyond the power of medicine to remove. His parents\r\nwere weak enough to believe that the royal touch was a specific for this\r\nmalady. In his third year he was taken up to London, inspected by the\r\ncourt surgeon, prayed over by the court chaplains, and stroked and\r\npresented with a piece of gold by Queen Anne. One of his earliest\r\nrecollections was that of a stately lady in a diamond stomacher and a\r\nlong black hood. Her hand was applied in vain. The boy’s features, which\r\nwere originally noble and not irregular, were distorted by his malady.\r\nHis cheeks were deeply scarred. He lost for a time the sight of one eye;\r\nand he saw but very imperfectly with the other. But the force of\r\nhis mind overcame every impediment. Indolent as he was, he acquired\r\nknowledge with such ease and rapidity that at every school to which\r\nhe was sent he was soon the best scholar. From sixteen to eighteen he\r\nresided at home, and was left to his own devices. He learned much at\r\nthis time, though his studies were without guidance and without plan. He\r\nransacked his father’s shelves, dipped into a multitude of books, read\r\nwhat was interesting, and passed over what was dull. An ordinary lad\r\nwould have acquired little or no useful knowledge in such a way: but\r\nmuch that was dull to ordinary lads was interesting to Samuel. He read\r\nlittle Greek; for his proficiency in that language was not such that he\r\ncould take much pleasure in the masters of Attic poetry and eloquence.\r\nBut he had left school a good Latinist; and he soon acquired, in the\r\nlarge and miscellaneous library of which he now had the command, an\r\nextensive knowledge of Latin literature. {174}That Augustan delicacy of\r\ntaste which is the boast of the great public schools of England he never\r\npossessed. But he was early familiar with some classical writers who\r\nwere quite unknown to the best scholars in the sixth form at Eton.\r\nHe was peculiarly attracted by the works of the great restorers of\r\nlearning. Once, while searching for some apples, he found a large folio\r\nvolume of Petrarch’s works. The name excited his curiosity; and\r\nhe eagerly devoured hundreds of pages. Indeed, the diction and\r\nversification of his own Latin compositions show that he had paid at\r\nleast as much attention to modern copies from the antique as to the\r\noriginal models.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus irregularly educating himself, his family was sinking\r\ninto hopeless poverty. Old Michael Johnson was much better qualified\r\nto pore upon books, and to talk about them, than to trade in them. His\r\nbusiness declined; his debts increased; it was with difficulty that the\r\ndaily expenses of his household were defrayed. It was out of his power\r\nto support his son at either university: but a wealthy neighbour offered\r\nassistance; and, in reliance on promises which proved to be of very\r\nlittle value, Samuel was entered at Pembroke College, Oxford. When the\r\nyoung scholar presented himself to the rulers of that society, they were\r\namazed not more by his ungainly figure and eccentric manners than by\r\nthe quantity of extensive and curious information which he had picked up\r\nduring many months of desultory but not unprofitable study. On the first\r\nday of his residence he surprised his teachers by quoting Macrobius; and\r\none of the most learned among them declared that he had never known a\r\nfreshman of equal attainments.\r\n\r\nAt Oxford, Johnson resided during about three years. {175}He was poor,\r\neven to raggedness; and his appearance excited a mirth and a pity winch\r\nwere equally intolerable to his haughty spirit. He was driven from the\r\nquadrangle of Christ Church by the sneering looks which the members\r\nof that aristocratical society cast at the holes in his shoes. Some\r\ncharitable person placed a new pair at his door; but he spurned them\r\naway in a fury. Distress made him, not servile, but reckless and\r\nungovernable. No opulent gentleman commoner, panting for one-and-twenty,\r\ncould have treated the academical authorities with more gross\r\ndisrespect. The needy scholar was generally to be seen under the gate\r\nof Pembroke, a gate now adorned with his effigy, haranguing a circle of\r\nlads, over whom, in spite of his tattered gown and dirty linen, his wit\r\nand audacity gave him an undisputed ascendency. In every mutiny against\r\nthe discipline of the college he was the ringleader. Much was\r\npardoned, however, to a youth so highly distinguished by abilities and\r\nacquirements. He had early made himself known by turning Pope’s Messiah\r\ninto Latin verse. The style and rhythm, indeed, were not exactly\r\nVirgilian; but the translation found many admirers, and was read with\r\npleasure by Pope himself.\r\n\r\nThe time drew near at which Johnson would, in the ordinary course of\r\nthings, have become a Bachelor of Arts: but he was at the end of his\r\nresources. Those promises of support on which he had relied had not been\r\nkept. His family could do nothing for him. His debts to Oxford tradesmen\r\nwere small indeed, yet larger than he could pay. In the autumn of 1731,\r\nhe was under the necessity of quitting the university without a\r\ndegree. In the following winter his father died. The old man left but a\r\npittance; and of that thought grounds sufficient for absolving felons,\r\nand for setting aside wills. His grimaces, his gestures, his mutterings,\r\nsometimes diverted and sometimes terrified people who did not know him.\r\nAt a dinner table he would, in a fit of absence, stoop down and twitch\r\noff a lady’s shoe. He would amaze a drawing room by suddenly ejaculating\r\na clause of the Lord’s Prayer.\r\n\r\nHe would conceive an unintelligible aversion to a particular alley, and\r\nperform a great circuit rather than see the hateful place. He would set\r\nhis heart on touching every post in the streets through which he walked.\r\nIf by any chance he missed a post, he would go back a hundred yards\r\nand repair the omission. Under the influence of his disease, his senses\r\nbecame morbidly torpid, and his imagination morbidly active.\r\n\r\nAt one time he would stand poring on the town clock without being able\r\nto tell the hour. At another, he would distinctly hear his mother, who\r\nwas many miles off, calling him by his name. But this was not the worst.\r\nA deep melancholy took possession of him, and gave a dark tinge to all\r\nhis views of human napittance {176}almost the whole was appropriated\r\nto the support of his widow. The property to which Samuel succeeded\r\namounted to no more than twenty pounds.\r\n\r\nHis life, during the thirty years which followed, was one hard struggle\r\nwith poverty. The misery of that struggle needed no aggravation, but\r\nwas aggravated by the sufferings of an unsound body and an unsound mind.\r\nBefore the young man left the university, his hereditary malady had\r\nbroken forth in a singularly cruel form. He had become an incurable\r\nhypochondriac. He said long after that he had been mad all his life, or\r\nat least not perfectly sane; and, in truth, eccentricities less\r\nstrange than his have often been ture {177}and of human destiny. Such\r\nwretchedness as he endured has driven many men to shoot themselves or\r\ndrown themselves. But he was under no temptation to commit suicide. He\r\nwas sick of life; but he was afraid of death; and he shuddered at every\r\nsight or sound which reminded him of the inevitable hour. In religion he\r\nfound but little comfort during his long and frequent fits of dejection;\r\nfor his religion partook of his own character. The light from heaven\r\nshone on him indeed, but not in a direct line, or with its own pure\r\nsplendour. The rays had to struggle through a disturbing medium; they\r\nreached him refracted, dulled and discoloured by the thick gloom which\r\nhad settled on his soul; and, though they might be sufficiently clear to\r\nguide him, were too dim to cheer him.\r\n\r\nWith such infirmities of body and of mind, this celebrated man was\r\nleft, at two-and-twenty, to fight his way through the world. He remained\r\nduring about five years in the midland counties. At Lichfield, his\r\nbirth-place and his early home, he had inherited some friends and\r\nacquired others. He was kindly noticed by Henry Hervey, a gay officer\r\nof noble family, who happened to be quartered there. Gilbert Walmesley,\r\nregistrar of the ecclesiastical court of the diocese, a man of\r\ndistinguished parts, learning, and knowledge of the world, did himself\r\nhonour by patronising the young adventurer, whose repulsive person,\r\nunpolished manners and squalid garb moved many of the petty aristocracy\r\nof the neighbourhood to laughter or to disgust. At Lichfield, however,\r\nJohnson could find no way of earning a livelihood. He became usher of\r\na grammar school in Leicestershire; he resided as a humble companion\r\nin the house of a country gentleman; but a life of dependence was\r\ninsupportable to his haughty spirit. He repaired {178}to Birmingham, and\r\nthere earned a few guineas by literary drudgery. In that town he printed\r\na translation, little noticed at the time, and long forgotten, of a\r\nLatin book about Abyssinia. He then put forth proposals for publishing\r\nby subscription the poems of Politian, with notes containing a history\r\nof modern Latin verse: but subscriptions did not come in; and the volume\r\nnever appeared.\r\n\r\nWhile leading this vagrant and miserable life, Johnson fell in love.\r\nThe object of his passion was Mrs. Elizabeth Porter, a widow who had\r\nchildren as old as himself. To ordinary spectators, the lady appeared\r\nto be a short, fat, coarse woman, painted half an inch thick, dressed in\r\ngaudy colours, and fond of exhibiting provincial airs and graces which\r\nwere not exactly those of the Queensberrys and Lepels. To Johnson,\r\nhowever, whose passions were strong, whose eyesight was too weak to\r\ndistinguish ceruse from natural bloom, and who had seldom or never been\r\nin the same room with a woman of real fashion, his Titty, as he called\r\nher, was the most beautiful, graceful and accomplished of her sex. That\r\nhis admiration was unfeigned cannot be doubted; for she was as poor as\r\nhimself. She accepted, with a readiness which did her little honour,\r\nthe addresses of a suitor who might have been her son. The marriage,\r\nhowever, in spite of occasional wranglings, proved happier than might\r\nhave been expected. The lover continued to be under the illusions of the\r\nwedding-day till the lady died in her sixty-fourth year. On her monument\r\nhe placed an inscription extolling the charms of her person and of her\r\nmanners; and, when, long after her decease, he had occasion to mention\r\nher, he exclaimed, with a tenderness half ludicrous, half pathetic,\r\n“Pretty creature!”\r\n\r\nHis {179}marriage made it necessary for him to exert himself more\r\nstrenuously than he had hitherto done. He took a house in the\r\nneighbourhood of his native town, and advertised for pupils. But\r\neighteen months passed away; and only three pupils came to his academy.\r\nIndeed, his appearance was so strange, and his temper so violent, that\r\nhis schoolroom must have resembled an ogre’s den. Nor was the tawdry\r\npainted grandmother whom he called his Titty well qualified to make\r\nprovision for the comfort of young gentlemen. David Garrick, who was\r\none of the pupils, used, many years later, to throw the best company of\r\nLondon into convulsions of laughter by mimicking the endearments of this\r\nextraordinary pair.\r\n\r\nAt length Johnson, in the twenty-eighth year of his age, determined to\r\nseek his fortune in the capital as a literary adventurer. He set out\r\nwith a few guineas, three acts of the tragedy of Irene in manuscript,\r\nand two or three letters of introduction from his friend Walmesley.\r\n\r\nNever, since literature became a calling in England, had it been a less\r\ngainful calling than at the time when Johnson took up his residence in\r\nLondon. In the preceding generation a writer of eminent merit was sure\r\nto be munificently rewarded by the government. The least that he could\r\nexpect was a pension or a sinecure place; and, if he showed any aptitude\r\nfor politics, he might hope to be a member of parliament, a lord of the\r\ntreasury, an ambassador, a secretary of state. It would be easy, on the\r\nother hand, to name several writers of the nineteenth century of\r\nwhom the least successful has received forty thousand pounds from the\r\nbooksellers. But Johnson entered on his vocation in the most dreary\r\npart of the dreary interval which {180}separated two ages of prosperity.\r\nLiterature had ceased to flourish under the patronage of the great, and\r\nhad not begun to flourish under the patronage of the public. One man of\r\nletters, indeed. Pope, had acquired by his pen what was then considered\r\nas a handsome fortune, and lived on a footing of equality with nobles\r\nand ministers of state. But this was a solitary exception. Even an\r\nauthor whose reputation was established, and whose works were popular,\r\nsuch an author as Thomson, whose Seasons were in every library, such an\r\nauthor as Fielding, whose Pasquin had had a greater run than any drama\r\nsince The Begar’s Opera, was sometimes glad to obtain, by pawning his\r\nbest coat, the means of dining on tripe at a cook-shop underground,\r\nwhere he could wipe his hands, after his greasy meal, on the back of a\r\nNewfoundland dog. It is easy, therefore, to imagine what humiliations\r\nand privations must have awaited the novice who had still to earn a\r\nname. One of the publishers to whom Johnson applied for employment\r\nmeasured with a scornful eye that athletic though uncouth frame, and\r\nexclaimed, “You had better get a porter’s knot, and carry trunks.” Nor\r\nwas the advice bad; for a porter was likely to be as plentifully fed,\r\nand as comfortably lodged, as a poet.\r\n\r\nSome time appears to have elapsed before Johnson was able to form any\r\nliterary connection from which he could expect more than bread for the\r\nday which was passing g over him. He never forgot the generosity with\r\nwhich Hervey, who was now residing in London, relieved his wants during\r\nthis time of trial. “Harry Hervey,” said the old philosopher many years\r\nlater, “was a vicious man; but he was very kind to me. If you call a dog\r\nHervey I shall love him.”\r\n\r\nAt {181}Hervey’s table Johnson sometimes enjoyed feasts which were made\r\nmore agreeable by contrast. But in general be dined, and thought that he\r\ndined well, on sixpenny worth of meat, and a pennyworth of bread, at an\r\nalehouse near Drury Lane.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the privations and sufferings which he endured at this\r\ntime was discernible to the last in his temper and his deportment. His\r\nmanners had never been courtly. They now became almost savage. Being\r\nfrequently under the necessity of wearing shabby coats and dirty shirts,\r\nhe became a confirmed sloven. Being often very hungry when he sat down\r\nto his meals, he contracted a habit of eating with ravenous greediness.\r\nEven to the end of his life, and even at the tables of the great, the\r\nsight of food affected him as it affects wild beasts and birds of prey.\r\nHis taste in cookery, formed in subterranean ordinaries and ala mode\r\nbeefshops, was far from delicate. Whenever he was so fortunate as to\r\nhave near him a hare that had been kept too long, or a meat pie made\r\nwith rancid butter, he gorged himself with such violence that his veins\r\nswelled, and the moisture broke out on his forehead. The affronts which\r\nhis poverty emboldened stupid and low-minded men to offer to him would\r\nhave broken a mean spirit into sycophancy, but made him rude even to\r\nferocity. Unhappily the insolence which, while it was defensive,\r\nwas pardonable, and in some sense respectable, accompanied him into\r\nsocieties where he was treated with courtesy and kindness. He was\r\nrepeatedly provoked into striking those who had taken liberties with\r\nhim. All the sufferers, however, were wise enough to abstain from\r\ntalking about their beatings, except Osborne, the most rapacious and\r\nbrutal of booksellers, who proclaimed every where that he had been\r\n{182}knocked down by the huge fellow whom he had hired to puff the\r\nHarleian Library.\r\n\r\nAbout, a year after Johnson had begun to reside in London, he was\r\nfortunate enough to obtain regular employment from Cave, an enterprising\r\nand intelligent bookseller, who was proprietor and editor of the\r\n“Gentleman’s Magazine.” That journal, just entering on the ninth year\r\nof its long existence, was the only periodical work in the kingdom which\r\nthen had what would now be called a large circulation. It was, indeed,\r\nthe chief source of parliamentary intelligence. It was not then safe,\r\neven during a recess, to publish an account of the proceedings of either\r\nHouse without some disguise. Cave, however, ventured to entertain his\r\nreaders with what he called “Reports of the Debates of the Senate of\r\nLilliput.” France was Blefuseu; London was Mildendo: pounds were sprugs:\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle was the Nardac secretary of State: Lord Hardwicke\r\nwas the Hurgo Hickrad: and William Pulteney was Wingul Pulnub. To write\r\nthe speeches, was, during several years, the business of Johnson. He was\r\ngenerally furnished with notes, meagre indeed, and inaccurate, of what\r\nhad been said; but sometimes he had to find arguments and eloquence both\r\nfor the ministry and for the opposition. He was himself a Tory, not\r\nfrom rational conviction--for his serious opinion was that one form of\r\ngovernment was just as good or as bad as another--but from mere passion,\r\nsuch as inflamed the Capulets against the Montagues, or the Blues of\r\nthe Roman circus against the Greens. In his infancy he had heard so much\r\ntalk about the villanies of the Whigs, and the dangers of the Church,\r\nthat he had become a furious partisan when he could scarcely speak.\r\nBefore he was three he {183}had insisted on being taken to hear\r\nSaeheverell preach at Lichfield Cathedral, and had listened to the\r\nsermon with as much respect, and probably with as much intelligence, as\r\nany Staffordshire squire in the congregation. The work which had been\r\nbegun in the nursery had been completed by the university. Oxford, when\r\nJohnson resided there, was the most Jacobitical place in England;\r\nand Pembroke was one of the most Jacobitical colleges in Oxford. The\r\nprejudices which he brought up to London were scarcely less absurd than\r\nthose of his own Tom Tempest. Charles II. and James II. were two of the\r\nbest kings that ever reigned. Laud, a poor creature who never did, said,\r\nor wrote anything indicating more than the ordinary capacity of an\r\nold woman, was a prodigy of parts and learning over whose tomb Art and\r\nGenius still continued to weep. Hampden deserved no more honourable name\r\nthan that of “the zealot of rebellion.” Even the ship money, condemned\r\nnot less decidedly by Falkland and Clarendon than by the bitterest\r\nRoundheads, Johnson would not pronounce to have been an unconstitutional\r\nimpost. Under a government, the mildest that had ever been known in the\r\nworld--under a government which allowed to the people an unprecedented\r\nliberty of speech and action--he fancied that he was a slave; he\r\nassailed the ministry with obloquy which refuted itself, and regretted\r\nthe lost freedom and happiness of those golden days in which a writer\r\nwho had taken but one-tenth part of the license allowed to him would\r\nhave been pilloried, mangled with the shears, whipped at the cart’s\r\ntail, and flung into a noisome dungeon to die. He hated dissenters and\r\nstock-jobbers, the excise and the army, septennial parliaments, and\r\ncontinental connections.\r\n\r\nHe {184}long had an aversion to the Scotch, an aversion of which he\r\ncould not remember the commencement, but which, he owned, had probably\r\noriginated in his abhorrence of the conduct of the nation during the\r\nGreat Rebellion. It is easy to guess in what manner debates on great\r\nparty questions were likely to be reported by a man whose judgment\r\nwas so much disordered by party spirit, A show of fairness was indeed\r\nnecessary to the prosperity of the Magazine. But Johnson long afterwards\r\nowned that, though he had saved appearances, he had taken care that the\r\nWhig dogs should not have the best of it; and, in fact, every passage\r\nwhich has lived, every passage which bears the marks of his higher\r\nfaculties, is put into the mouth of some member of the opposition.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after Johnson had entered on these obscure labours, he\r\npublished a work which at once placed him high among the writers of his\r\nage. It is probable that what he had suffered during his first year in\r\nLondon had often reminded him of some parts of that noble poem in which\r\nJuvenal had described the misery and degradation of a needy man of\r\nletters, lodged among the pigeons’ nests in the tottering garrets which\r\noverhung the streets of Rome. Pope’s admirable imitations of Horace’s\r\nSatires and Epistles had recently appeared, were in every hand, and were\r\nby many readers thought superior to the originals. What Pope had done\r\nfor Horace, Johnson aspired to do for Juvenal. The enterprise was bold,\r\nand yet judicious. For between Johnson and Juvenal there was much in\r\ncommon, much more certainly than between Pope and Horace.\r\n\r\nJohnson’s London appeared without his name in May 1738. He received only\r\nten guineas for this stately {185}and vigorous poem: but the sale was\r\nrapid, and the success complete. A second edition was required within a\r\nweek. Those small critics who are always desirous to lower established\r\nreputations ran about proclaiming that the anonymous satirist was\r\nsuperior to Pope in Pope’s own peculiar department of literature. It\r\nought to be remembered, to the honour of Pope, that he joined heartily\r\nin the applause with which the appearance of a rival genius was\r\nwelcomed. He made inquiries about the author of London. Such a man, he\r\nsaid, could not long be concealed. The name was soon discovered; and\r\nPope, with great kindness, exerted himself to obtain an academical\r\ndegree and the mastership of a grammar school for the poor young poet.\r\nThe attempt failed; and Johnson remained a bookseller’s hack.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that these two men, the most eminent writer of the\r\ngeneration which was going out, and the most eminent writer of the\r\ngeneration which was coming in, ever saw each other. They lived in\r\nvery different circles, one surrounded by dukes and earls, the other by\r\nstarving pamphleteers and index-makers. Among Johnson’s associates at\r\nthis time may be mentioned Boyse, who, when his shirts were pledged,\r\nscrawled Latin verses sitting up in bed with his arms through two holes\r\nin his blanket; who composed very respectable sacred poetry when he\r\nwas sober; and who was at last run over by a hackney coach when he\r\nwas drunk: Hoole, surnamed the metaphysical tailor, who, instead of\r\nattending to his measures, used to trace geometrical diagrams on the\r\nboard where he sate cross-legged: and the penitent impostor, George\r\nPsalmanazar, who, after poring all day, in a humble lodging, on the\r\nfolios of Jewish rabbis {186}and Christian fathers, indulged himself at\r\nnight with literary and theological conversation at an alehouse in the\r\ncity. But the most remarkable of the persons with whom at this time\r\nJohnson consorted was Richard Savage, an earl’s son, a shoemaker’s\r\napprentice, who had seen life in all its forms, who had feasted among\r\nblue ribands in Saint James’s Square, and had lain with fifty pounds’\r\nweight of irons on his legs in the condemned ward of Newgate. This man\r\nhad, after many vicissitudes of fortune, sunk at last into abject and\r\nhopeless poverty. His pen had failed him. His patrons had been taken\r\naway by death, or estranged by the riotous profusion with which he\r\nsquandered their bounty, and the ungrateful insolence with which he\r\nrejected their advice. He now lived by begging. He dined on venison and\r\nchampagne whenever he had been so fortunate as to borrow a guinea. If\r\nhis questing had been unsuccessful, he appeased the rage of hunger with\r\nsome scraps of broken meat, and lay down to rest under the Piazza of\r\nCovent Garden in warm weather, and, in cold weather, as near as he could\r\nget to the furnace of a glass house. Yet, in his misery, he was still\r\nan agreeable companion. He had an inexhaustible store of anecdotes about\r\nthat gay and brilliant world from which he was now an outcast. He had\r\nobserved the great men of both parties in hours of careless relaxation,\r\nhad seen the leaders of opposition without the mask of patriotism, and\r\nhad heard the prime minister roar with laughter and tell stories not\r\nover decent. During some months Savage lived in the closest familiarity\r\nwith Johnson; and then the friends parted, not without tears. Johnson\r\nremained in London to drudge for Cave. Savage went to the West of\r\nEngland, {187}lived there as he had lived everywhere, and, in 1748,\r\ndied, penniless and heart-broken, in Bristol gaol.\r\n\r\nSoon after his death, while the public curiosity was strongly excited\r\nabout his extraordinary character, and his not less extraordinary\r\nadventures, a life of him appeared widely different from the catchpenny\r\nlives of eminent men which were then a staple article of manufacture in\r\nGrub Street. The style was indeed deficient in ease and variety; and the\r\nwriter was evidently too partial to the Latin element of our language.\r\nBut the little work, with all its faults, was a masterpiece. No finer\r\nspecimen of literary biography existed in any language, living or dead;\r\nand a discerning critic might have confidently predicted that the author\r\nwas destined to be the founder of a new school of English eloquence.\r\n\r\nThe Life of Savage was anonymous; but it was well known in literary\r\ncircles that Johnson was the writer. During the three years which\r\nfollowed, he produced no important work; but he was not, and indeed\r\ncould not be, idle. The fame of his abilities and learning continued to\r\ngrow. Warburton pronounced him a man of parts and genius; and the praise\r\nof Warburton was then no light thing. Such was Johnson’s reputation\r\nthat, in 1747, several eminent booksellers combined to employ him in the\r\narduous work of preparing a Dictionary of the English Language, in two\r\nfolio volumes. The sum which they agreed to pay him was only fifteen\r\nhundred guineas; and out of this sum he had to pay several poor men of\r\nletters who assisted him in the humbler parts of his task.\r\n\r\nThe prospectus of the Dictionary he addressed to the Earl of\r\nChesterfield. Chesterfield had long been celebrated {188}for the\r\npoliteness of his manners, the brilliancy of his wit, and the delicacy\r\nof his taste. He was acknowledged to be the finest speaker in the House\r\nof Lords. He had recently governed Ireland, at a momentous conjuncture,\r\nwith eminent firmness, wisdom, and humanity; and he had since became\r\nSecretary of State. He received Johnson’s homage with the most winning\r\naffability, and requited it with a few guineas, bestowed doubtless in\r\na very graceful manner, but was by no means desirous to see all his\r\ncarpets blackened with the London mud, and his soups and wines thrown to\r\nright and left over the gowns of fine ladies and the waistcoats of fine\r\ngentlemen, by an absent, awkward scholar, who gave strange starts and\r\nuttered strange growls, who dressed like a scarecrow, and ate like a\r\ncormorant. During some time Johnson continued to call on his patron,\r\nbut, after being repeatedly told by the porter that his lordship was\r\nnot at home, took the hint, and ceased to present himself at the\r\ninhospitable door.\r\n\r\nJohnson had flattered himself that he should have completed his\r\nDictionary by the end of 1750; but it was not till 1755 that he at\r\nlength gave his huge vol-nines to the world. During the seven years\r\nwhich he passed in the drudgery of penning definitions and marking\r\nquotations for transcription, he sought for relaxation in literary\r\nlabour of a more agreeable kind.\r\n\r\nIn 1749 he published the Vanity of Human Wishes, an excellent imitation\r\nof the Tenth Satire of Juvenal.\r\n\r\nIt is in truth not easy to say whether the palm belongs to the ancient\r\nor to the modern poet. The couplets in which the fall of Wolsey is\r\ndescribed, though lofty and sonorous, are feeble when compared with\r\nthe wonderful lines which bring before us all Rome in tumult on the day\r\n{189}of the fall of Sejanus, the laurels on the doorposts, the white\r\nbull stalking towards the Capitol, the statues rolling down from their\r\npedestals, the flatterers of the disgraced minister running to see\r\nhim dragged with a hook through the streets, and to have a kick at his\r\ncarcase before it is hurled into the Tiber. It must be owned too that in\r\nthe concluding passage the Christian moralist has not made the most of\r\nhis advantages, and has fallen decidedly short of the sublimity of\r\nhis Pagan model. On the other hand, Juvenal’s Hannibal must yield to\r\nJohnson’s Charles: and Johnson’s vigorous and pathetic enumeration\r\nof the miseries of a literary life must be allowed to be superior to\r\nJuvenal’s lamentation over the fate of Demosthenes and Cicero.\r\n\r\nFor the copyright of the Vanity of Human Wishes Johnson received only\r\nfifteen guineas.\r\n\r\nA few days after the publication of this poem, his tragedy, begun many\r\nyears before, was brought on the stage. His pupil, David Garrick, had,\r\nin 1741, made his appearance on a humble stage in Goodman’s Fields,\r\nhad at once risen to the first place among actors, and was now, after\r\nseveral years of almost uninterrupted success, manager of Drury Lane\r\nTheatre. The relation between him and his old preceptor was of a very\r\nsingular kind. They repelled each other strongly, and yet attracted\r\neach other strongly. Nature had made them of very different clay; and\r\ncircumstances had fully brought out the natural peculiarities of both.\r\nSudden prosperity had turned Garrick’s head. Continued adversity had\r\nsoured Johnson’s temper. Johnson saw with more envy than became so great\r\na man the villa, the plate, the china, the Brussels carpet, which the\r\nlittle mimic had got by repeating, with grimaces and gesticulations,\r\nwhat wiser men had written; and the {190}exquisitely sensitive vanity of\r\nGarrick was galled by the thought that, while all the rest of the world\r\nwas applauding him, he could obtain from one morose cynic, whose opinion\r\nit was impossible to despise, scarcely any compliment not acidulated\r\nwith scorn. Yet the two Lichfield men had so many early recollections in\r\ncommon, and sympathised with each other on so many points on which they\r\nsympathised with nobody else in the vast population of the capital,\r\nthat, though the master was often provoked by the monkey-like\r\nimpertinence of the pupil, and the pupil by the bearish rudeness of the\r\nmaster, they remained friends till they were parted by death. Garrick\r\nnow brought Irene out, with alterations sufficient to displease the\r\nauthor, yet not sufficient to make the piece pleasing to the audience.\r\nThe public, however, listened with little emotion, but with much\r\ncivility, to five acts of monotonous declamation.\r\n\r\nAfter nine representations the play was withdrawn. It is, indeed,\r\naltogether unsuited to the stage, and, even when perused in the closet,\r\nwill be found hardly worthy of the author. He had not the slightest\r\nnotion of what blank verse should be. A change in the last syllable of\r\nevery other line would make the versification of the Vanity of Human\r\nWishes closely resemble the versification of Irene. The poet, however,\r\ncleared, by his benefit nights, and by the sale of the copyright of his\r\ntragedy, about three hundred pounds, then a great sum in his estimation.\r\n\r\nAbout a year after the representation of Irene, he began to publish a\r\nseries of short essays on morals, manners, and literature. This species\r\nof composition had been brought into fashion by the success of the\r\nTatler, and by the still more brilliant success of the Spectator. A\r\ncrowd of small writers had vainly attempted {191}to rival Addison.\r\nThe Lay Monastery, the Censor, the Freethinker, the Plain Dealer, the\r\nChampion, and other works of the same kind, had had their short day.\r\nNone of them had obtained a permanent place in our literature; and they\r\nare now to be found only in the libraries of the curious. At length\r\nJohnson undertook the adventure in which so many aspirants had failed.\r\nIn the thirty-sixth year after the appearance of the last number of the\r\nSpectator appeared the first number of the Rambler. From March 1750 to\r\nMarch 1752, this paper continued to come out every Tuesday and Saturday.\r\n\r\nFrom the first the Rambler was enthusiastically admired by a few eminent\r\nmen. Richardson, when only five numbers had appeared, pronounced it\r\nequal, if not superior, to the Spectator. Young and Hartley expressed\r\ntheir approbation not less warmly. Bubb Dodington, among whose many\r\nfaults indifference to the claims of genius and learning cannot be\r\nreckoned, solicited the acquaintance of the writer. In consequence\r\nprobably of the good offices of Dodington, who was then the confidential\r\nadviser of Prince Frederic, two of his Royal Highness’s gentlemen\r\ncarried a gracious message to the printing office, and ordered seven\r\ncopies for Leicester House. But these overtures seem to have been very\r\ncoldly received. Johnson had had enough of the patronage of the great to\r\nlast him all his life, and was not disposed to haunt any other door as\r\nhe had haunted the door of Chesterfield.\r\n\r\nBy the public the Rambler was at first very coldly received. Though the\r\nprice of a number was only twopence, the sale did not amount to five\r\nhundred. The profits were therefore very small. But as soon as the\r\nflying leaves were collected and reprinted they became {192}popular. The\r\nauthor lived to see thirteen thousand copies spread over England alone.\r\nSeparate editions were published for the Scotch and Irish markets. A\r\nlarge party pronounced the style perfect, so absolutely perfect that in\r\nsome essays it would be impossible for the writer himself to alter a\r\nsingle word for the better. Another party, not less numerous, vehemently\r\naccused him of having corrupted the purity of the English tongue. The\r\nbest critics admitted that his diction was too monotonous, too obviously\r\nartificial, and now and then turgid even to absurdity. But they did\r\njustice to the acuteness of his observations on morals and manners, to\r\nthe constant precision and frequent brilliancy of his language, to the\r\nweighty and magnificent eloquence of many serious passages, and to\r\nthe solemn yet pleasing humour of some of the lighter papers. On the\r\nquestion of precedence between Addison and Johnson, a question which,\r\nseventy years ago, was much disputed, posterity has pronounced a\r\ndecision from which there is no appeal. Sir Roger, his chaplain and his\r\nbutler, Will Wimble and Will Honeycomb, the Vision of Mirza, the Journal\r\nof the Retired Citizen, the Everlasting Club, the Dunmow Flitch, the\r\nLoves of Hilpah and Slialum, the Visit to the Exchange, and the Visit\r\nto the Abbey, are known to everybody. But many men and women, even of\r\nhighly cultivated minds, are unacquainted with Squire Bluster and Mrs.\r\nBusy, Quisquilius and Venustulus, the Allegory of Wit and Learning, the\r\nChronicle of the Revolutions of a Garret, and the sad fate of Aningait\r\nand Ajut.\r\n\r\nThe last Rambler was written in a sad and gloomy hour. Mrs. Johnson had\r\nbeen given over by the physicians. Three days later she died. She left\r\nher husband {193}almost broken-hearted. Many people had been surprised\r\nto see a man of his genius and learning stooping to every drudgery, and\r\ndenying himself almost every comfort, for the purpose of supplying a\r\nsilly, affected old woman with superfluities, which she accepted with\r\nbut little gratitude. But all his affection had been concentrated on\r\nher. He had neither brother nor sister, neither son nor daughter. To him\r\nshe was beautiful as the Gunnings, and witty as Lady Mary. Her opinion\r\nof his writings was more important to him than the voice of the pit\r\nof Drury Lane Theatre or the judgment of the Monthly Review. The chief\r\nsupport which had sustained him through the most arduous labour of his\r\nlife was the hope that she would enjoy the fame and the profit which\r\nhe anticipated from his Dictionary. She was gone; and in that vast\r\nlabyrinth of streets, peopled by eight hundred thousand human beings, he\r\nwas alone. Yet it was necessary for him to set himself, as he expressed\r\nit, doggedly to work. After three more laborious years, the Dictionary\r\nwas at length complete.\r\n\r\nIt had been generally supposed that this great work would be dedicated\r\nto the eloquent and accomplished nobleman to whom the prospectus\r\nhad been addressed. He well knew the value of such a compliment; and\r\ntherefore, when the day of publication drew near, he exerted himself\r\nto soothe, by a show of zealous and at the same time of delicate and\r\njudicious kindness, the pride which he had so cruelly wounded. Since\r\nthe Ramblers had ceased to appear, the town had been entertained by a\r\njournal called The World, to which many men of high rank and fashion\r\ncontributed. In two successive numbers of The World the Dictionary was,\r\nto use the modern phrase, puffed with {194}wonderful skill. The writings\r\nof Johnson were warmly praised. It was proposed that he should be\r\ninvested with the authority of a Dictator, nay, of a Pope, over our\r\nlanguage, and that his decisions about the meaning and the spelling of\r\nwords should be received as final. His two folios, it was said, would of\r\ncourse be bought by everybody who could afford to buy them. It was\r\nsoon known that these papers were written by Chesterfield. But the just\r\nresentment of Johnson was not to be so appeased. In a letter written\r\nwith singular energy and dignity of thought and language, he repelled\r\nthe tardy advances of his patron. The Dictionary came forth without\r\na dedication. In the preface the author truly declared that he owed\r\nnothing to the great, and described the difficulties with which he had\r\nbeen left to struggle so forcibly and pathetically that the ablest and\r\nmost malevolent of all the enemies of his fame, Horne Tooke, never could\r\nread that passage without tears.\r\n\r\nThe public, on this occasion, did Johnson full justice, and something\r\nmore than justice. The best lexicographer may well be content if his\r\nproductions are received by the world with cold esteem. But Johnson’s\r\nDictionary was hailed with an enthusiasm such as no similar work has\r\never excited. It was indeed the first dictionary which could be read\r\nwith pleasure. The definitions show so much acuteness of thought and\r\ncommand of language, and the passages quoted from poets, divines and\r\nphilosophers are so skilfully selected, that a leisure hour may always\r\nbe very agreeably spent in turning over the pages. The faults of the\r\nbook resolve themselves, for the most part, into one great fault.\r\nJohnson was a wretched etymologist. He knew little or nothing of any\r\nTeutonic language {195}except English, which indeed, as he wrote it, was\r\nscarcely a Teutonic language; and thus he was absolutely at the mercy of\r\nJunius and Skinner.\r\n\r\nThe Dictionary, though it raised Johnson’s fame, added nothing to his\r\npecuniary means. The fifteen hundred guineas which the booksellers had\r\nagreed to pay him had been advanced and spent before the last sheets\r\nissued from the press. It is painful to relate that, twice in the course\r\nof the year which followed the publication of this great work, he was\r\narrested and carried to spunging-houses, and that he was twice indebted\r\nfor his liberty to his excellent friend Richardson. It was still\r\nnecessary for the man who had been formally saluted by the highest\r\nauthority as Dictator of the English language to supply his wants by\r\nconstant toil. He abridged his Dictionary. He proposed to bring out\r\nan edition of Shakspeare by subscription; and many subscribers sent in\r\ntheir names, and laid down their money; but he soon found the task so\r\nlittle to his taste that he turned to more attractive employments. He\r\ncontributed many papers to a new monthly journal, which was called the\r\nLiterary Magazine. Few of these papers have much interest; but among\r\nthem was the very best thing that he ever wrote, a masterpiece both of\r\nreasoning and of satirical pleasantry, the review of Jenyns’s Inquiry\r\ninto The Nature and Origin of Evil.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1758 Johnson put forth the first of a series of essays,\r\nentitled The Idler. During two years these essays continued to appear\r\nweekly. They were eagerly read, widely circulated, and, indeed,\r\nimpudently pirated, while they were still in the original form, and had\r\na large sale when collected into volumes. The Idler may be described as\r\na second part of The {196}Rambler, somewhat livelier and somewhat weaker\r\nthan the first part.\r\n\r\nWhile Johnson was busied with his Idlers, his mother, who had\r\naccomplished her ninetieth year, died at Lichfield. It was long since\r\nhe had seen her; but he had not failed to contribute largely, out of\r\nhis small means, to her comfort. In order to defray the charges of her\r\nfuneral, and to pay some debts which she had left, he wrote a little\r\nbook in a single week, and sent off the sheets to the press without\r\nreading them over. A hundred pounds were paid him for the copyright; and\r\nthe purchasers had great cause to be pleased with their bargain; for the\r\nbook was Rasselas.\r\n\r\nThe success of Rasselas was great, though such ladies as Miss Lydia\r\nLanguish must have been grievously disappointed when they found that\r\nthe new volume from the circulating library was little more than a\r\ndissertation on the author’s favourite theme, the Vanity of Human\r\nWishes; that the Prince of Abyssinia was without a mistress, and the\r\nPrincess without a lover; and that the story set the hero and the\r\nheroine down exactly where it had taken them up. The style was the\r\nsubject of much eager controversy. The Monthly Review and the Critical\r\nReview took different sides. Many readers pronounced tire writer a\r\npompous pedant, who would never use a word of two syllables where it was\r\npossible to use a word of six, and who could not make a waiting woman\r\nrelate her adventures without balancing every noun with another noun,\r\nand every epithet with another epithet. Another party, not less zealous,\r\ncited with delight numerous passages in which weighty meaning was\r\nexpressed with accuracy and illustrated with splendour. And both the\r\ncensure and the praise were merited.\r\n\r\nAbout {197}the plan of Rasselas little was said by the critics; and yet\r\nthe faults of the plan might seem to invite severe criticism. Johnson\r\nhas frequently blamed Shakspeare for neglecting the proprieties of\r\ntime and place, and for ascribing to one age or nation the manners and\r\nopinions of another. Yet Shakspeare has not sinned in this way more\r\ngrievously than Johnson. Rasselas and Imlac, Nekayah and Pekuah, are\r\nevidently meant to be Abyssinians of the eighteenth century: for the\r\nEurope which Imlac describes is the Europe of the eighteenth century;\r\nand the inmates of the Happy Valley talk familiarly of that law of\r\ngravitation which Newton discovered, and which was not fully received\r\neven at Cambridge till the eighteenth century. What a real company of\r\nAbyssinians would have been may be learned from Bruce’s Travels. But\r\nJohnson, not content with turning filthy savages, ignorant of their\r\nletters, and gorged with raw steaks cut from living cows, into\r\nphilosophers as eloquent and enlightened as himself or his friend Burke,\r\nand into ladies as highly accomplished as Mrs. Lennox or Mrs. Sheridan,\r\ntransferred the whole domestic system of England to Egypt. Into a land\r\nof harems, a land of polygamy, a land where women are married without\r\never being seen, he introduced the flirtations and jealousies of our\r\nball-rooms. In a land where there is boundless liberty of divorce,\r\nwedlock is described as the indissoluble compact. “A youth and maiden\r\nmeeting by chance, or brought together by artifice, exchange glances,\r\nreciprocate civilities, go home, and dream of each other. Such,” says\r\nRasselas, “is the common process of marriage.” Such it may have been,\r\nand may still be, in London, but assuredly not at Cairo. A writer who\r\nwas guilty of such improprieties had {198}little right to blame the\r\npoet who made Hector quote Aristotle, and represented Julio Romano as\r\nflourishing in the days of the oracle of Delphi.\r\n\r\nBy such exertions as have been described, Johnson supported himself till\r\nthe year 1702. In that year a great change in his circumstances took\r\nplace. He had from a child been an enemy of the reigning dynasty. His\r\nJacobite prejudices had been exhibited with little disguise both in\r\nhis works and in his conversation. Even in his massy and elaborate\r\nDictionary, he had, with a strange want of taste and judgment, inserted\r\nbitter and contumelious reflections on the Whig party. The excise, which\r\nwas a favourite resource of Whig financiers, he had designated as\r\na hateful tax. He had railed against the commissioners of excise in\r\nlanguage so coarse that they had seriously thought of prosecuting him.\r\nHe had with difficulty been prevented from holding up the Lord Privy\r\nSeal by name as an example of the meaning of the word “renegade.”’ A\r\npension he had defined as pay given to a state hireling to betray his\r\ncountry; a pensioner as a slave of state hired by a stipend to obey a\r\nmaster. It seemed un-likely that the author of these definitions would\r\nhimself be pensioned. But that was a time of wonders. George the\r\nThird had ascended the throne; and had, in the course of a few months,\r\ndisgusted many of the old friends and conciliated many of the old\r\nenemies of his house. The city was becoming mutinous. Oxford was\r\nbecoming loyal. Cavendishes and Bentincks were murmuring. Somersets and\r\nWyndhams were hastening to kiss hands. The head of the treasury was\r\nnow Lord Bute, who was a Tory, and could have no objection to Johnson’s\r\nToryism. Bute wished to be thought a patron of men of letters; and\r\nJohnson was one of the {199}most eminent and one of the most needy men\r\nof letters in Europe. A pension of three hundred a year was graciously\r\noffered, and with very little hesitation accepted.\r\n\r\nThis event produced a change in Johnson’s whole way of life. For the\r\nfirst time since his boyhood he no longer felt the daily goad urging him\r\nto the daily toil. He was at liberty, after thirty years of anxiety and\r\ndrudgery, to indulge his constitutional indolence, to be in bed till\r\ntwo in the afternoon, and to sit up talking till four in the morning,\r\nwithout fearing either the printer’s devil or the sheriff’s officer.\r\n\r\nOne laborious task indeed he had bound himself to perform. He had\r\nreceived large subscriptions for his promised edition of Shakspeare;\r\nhe had lived on those subscriptions during some years; and he could not\r\nwithout disgrace omit to perform his part of the contract. His friends\r\nrepeatedly exhorted him to make an effort; and he repeatedly resolved\r\nto do so. But, notwithstanding their exhortations and his resolutions,\r\nmonth followed month, year followed year, and nothing was done. He\r\nprayed fervently against his idleness; he determined, as often as he\r\nreceived the sacrament, that he would no longer doze away and trifle\r\naway his time; but the spell under which he lay resisted prayer\r\nand sacrament. His private notes at this time are made up of\r\nself-reproaches. “My indolence,” he wrote on Easter eve in 1764,\r\n“has sunk into grosser sluggishness. A kind of strange oblivion has\r\noverspread me, so that I know not what has become of the last year.”\r\n Easter 1765 came, and found him still in the same state, “My time,” he\r\nwrote, “has been unprofitably spent, and seems as a dream that has left\r\nnothing behind. My memory grows confused, {200}and I know not how the\r\ndays pass over me.” Happily for his honour, the charm which held him\r\ncaptive was at length broken by no gentle or friendly hand. He had been\r\nweak enough to pay serious attention to a story about a ghost which\r\nhaunted a house in Cock Lane, and had actually gone himself, with\r\nsome of his friends, at one in the morning, to St. John’s Church,\r\nClerkenwell, in the hope of receiving a communication from the perturbed\r\nspirit. But the spirit, though adjured with all solemnity, remained\r\nobstinately silent; and it soon appeared that a naughty girl of eleven\r\nhad been amusing herself by making fools of so many philosophers.\r\nChurchill, who, confident in his powers, drunk with popularity, and\r\nburning with party spirit, was looking for some man of established fame\r\nand Tory politics to insult, celebrated the Cock Lane Ghost in three\r\ncantos, nicknamed Johnson Pomposo, asked where the book was which had\r\nbeen so long promised and so liberally paid for, and directly accused\r\nthe great moralist of cheating. This terrible word proved effectual; and\r\nin October 1765 appeared, after a delay of nine years, the new edition\r\nof Shakspeare.\r\n\r\nThis publication saved Johnson’s character for honesty, but added\r\nnothing to the fame of his abilities and learning. The preface, though\r\nit contains some good passages, is not in his best manner. The most\r\nvaluable notes are those in which he had an opportunity of showing\r\nhow attentively he had during many years observed human life and human\r\nnature. The best specimen is the note on the character of Polonius.\r\nNothing so good is to be found even in Wilhelm Meister’s admirable\r\nexamination of Hamlet. But here praise must end. It would be difficult\r\nto name a more {201}slovenly, a more worthless, edition of any great\r\nclassic. The reader may turn over play after play without finding\r\none happy conjectural emendation, or one ingenious and satisfactory\r\nexplanation of a passage which had baffled preceding commentators.\r\nJohnson had, in his Prospectus, told the world that he was peculiarly\r\nfitted for the task which he had undertaken, because he had, as a\r\nlexicographer, been under the necessity of taking a wider view of the\r\nEnglish lan guage than any of his predecessors. That his knowledge of\r\nour literature was extensive is indisputable. But, unfortunately, he had\r\naltogether neglected that very part of our literature with which it is\r\nespecially desirable that an editor of Shakspeare should be conversant.\r\nIt is dangerous to assert a negative. Yet little will be risked by the\r\nassertion, that in the two folio volumes of the English Dictionary there\r\nis not a single passage quoted from any dramatist of the Elizabethan\r\nage, except Shakspeare and Ben. Even from Ben the quotations are few.\r\nJohnson might easily, in a few months, have made himself well acquainted\r\nwith every old play that was extant. But it never seems to have occurred\r\nto him that this was a necessary preparation for the work which he had\r\nundertaken. He would doubtless have admitted that it would be the height\r\nof absurdity in a man who was not familiar with the works of Æsehylus\r\nand Euripides to publish an edition of Sophocles. Yet he ventured to\r\npublish an edition of Shakspeare, without having ever in his life,\r\nas far as can be discovered, read a single scene of Massinger, Ford,\r\nDecker, Webster, Marlow, Beaumont, or Fletcher. His detractors were\r\nnoisy and scurrilous. Those who most loved and honoured him had little\r\nto say in praise of the manner in which he had {202}discharged the duty\r\nof a commentator. He had, however, acquitted himself of a debt which had\r\nlong lain heavy on his conscience; and he sank back into the repose from\r\nwhich the sting of satire had roused him. He long continued to\r\nlive upon the fame which he had already won. He was honoured by the\r\nUniversity of Oxford with a Doctor’s degree, by the Royal Academy with\r\na professorship, and by the King with an interview, in which his Majesty\r\nmost graciously expressed a hope that so excellent a writer would not\r\ncease to write. In the interval, however, between 1765 and 1775 Johnson\r\npublished only two or three political tracts, the longest of which he\r\ncould have produced in forty-eight hours, if he had worked as he worked\r\non the Life of Savage and on Rasselas.\r\n\r\nBut, though his pen was now idle, his tongue was active. The influence\r\nexercised by his conversation, directly upon those with whom he lived,\r\nand indirectly on the whole literary world, was altogether without a\r\nparallel. His colloquial talents were indeed of the highest order. He\r\nhad strong sense, quick discernment, wit, humour, immense knowledge of\r\nliterature and of life, and an infinite store of curious anecdotes.\r\n\r\nAs respected style, he spoke far better than he wrote Every sentence\r\nwhich dropped from his lips was as correct in structure as the most\r\nnicely balanced period of the Rambler. But in his talk there were no\r\npompous triads, and little more than a fair proportion of words in\r\n_osity_ and _ation_. All was simplicity, ease, and vigour. He uttered\r\nhis short, weighty, and pointed sentences with a power of voice, and\r\na justness and energy of emphasis, of which the effect was rather\r\nincreased than diminished by the rollings of his huge form, and by the\r\nasthmatic gaspings and puffings in which the peals {203}of his eloquence\r\ngenerally ended. Nor did the laziness which made him unwilling to sit\r\ndown to his desk prevent him from giving instruction or entertainment\r\norally. To discuss questions of taste, of learning, of casuistry,\r\nin language so exact and so forcible that it might have been printed\r\nwithout the alteration of a word, was to him no exertion, but a\r\npleasure. He loved, as he said, to fold his legs and have his talk out.\r\nHe was ready to bestow the overflowings of his full, mind on anybody who\r\nwould start a subject, on a fellow-passenger in a stage coach, or on the\r\nperson who sate at the same table with him in an eating house. But\r\nhis conversation was nowhere so brilliant and striking as when he was\r\nsurrounded by a few friends, whose abilities and knowledge enabled them,\r\nas he once expressed it, to send him back every ball that he threw. Some\r\nof these, in 1704, formed themselves into a club, which gradually\r\nbecame a formidable power in the commonwealth of letters. The verdicts\r\npronounced by this conclave on new books were speedily known over all\r\nLondon, and were sufficient to sell off a whole edition in a day, or\r\nto condemn the sheets to the service of the trunk-maker and the\r\npastry-cook. Nor shall we think this strange when we consider what\r\ngreat and various talents and acquirements met in the little fraternity.\r\nGoldsmith was the representative of poetry and light literature,\r\nReynolds of the arts, Burke of political eloquence and political\r\nphilosophy. There, too, were Gibbon, the greatest historian, and Jones,\r\nthe greatest linguist, of the age. Garrick brought to the meetings his\r\ninexhaustible pleasantry, his incomparable mimicry, and his consummate\r\nknowledge of stage effect. Among the most constant attendants were\r\ntwo high-born and high-bred gentlemen, closely bound together {204}by\r\nfriendship, but of widely different characters and habits; Bennet\r\nLangton, distinguished by his skill in Greek literature, by the\r\northodoxy of his opinions, and by the sanctity of his life; and Topham\r\nBeauclerk, renowned for his amours, his knowledge of the gay world,\r\nhis fastidious taste, and his sarcastic wit. To predominate over such a\r\nsociety was not easy. Yet even over such a society Johnson predominated.\r\nBurke might indeed have disputed the supremacy to which others were\r\nunder the necessity of submitting. But Burke, though not generally a\r\nvery patient listener, was content to take the second part when Johnson\r\nwas present; and the club itself, consisting of so many eminent men, is\r\nto this day popularly designated as Johnson’s Club.\r\n\r\nAmong the members of this celebrated body was one to whom it has owed\r\nthe greater part of its celebrity, yet who was regarded with little\r\nrespect by his brethren, and had not without difficulty obtained a seat\r\namong them. This was James Boswell, a young Scotch lawyer, heir to an\r\nhonourable name and a fair estate. That he was a coxcomb, and a bore,\r\nweak, vain, pushing, curious, garrulous, was obvious to all who were\r\nacquainted with him. That he could not reason, that he had no wit,\r\nno humour, no eloquence, is apparent from his writings. And yet his\r\nwritings are read beyond the Mississippi, and under the Southern Cross,\r\nand are likely to be read as long as the English exists, either as\r\na living or as a dead language. Nature had made him a slave and an\r\nidolater. His mind resembled those creepers which the botanists call\r\nparasites, and which can subsist only by clinging round the stems and\r\nimbibing the juices of stronger plants. He must have fastened himself on\r\nsomebody. He might {205}have fastened himself on Wilkes, and have\r\nbecome the fiercest patriot in the Bill of Rights Society. He might\r\nhave fastened himself on Whitfield, and have become the loudest field\r\npreacher among the Calvinistic Methodists. In a happy hour he fastened\r\nhimself on Johnson. The pair might seem ill matched. For Johnson had\r\nearly been prejudiced against Boswell’s country. To a man of Johnson’s\r\nstrong understanding and irritable temper, the silly egotism and\r\nadulation of Boswell must have been as teasing as the constant buzz of\r\na fly. Johnson hated to be questioned; and Boswell was eternally\r\ncatechising him on all kinds of subjects, and sometimes propounded such\r\nquestions as “What would you do, sir, if you were locked up in a\r\ntower with a baby?” Johnson was a water-drinker; and Boswell was a\r\nwine-bibber, and indeed little better than a habitual sot. It was\r\nimpossible that there should be perfect harmony between two such\r\ncompanions. Indeed, the great man was sometimes provoked into fits of\r\npassion in which he said things which the small man, during a few hours,\r\nseriously resented. Every quarrel, however, was soon made up. During\r\ntwenty years the disciple continued to worship the master: the master\r\ncontinued to scold the disciple, to sneer at him, and to love him. The\r\ntwo friends ordinarily resided at a great distance from each other.\r\nBoswell practised in the Parliament House of Edinburgh, and could pay\r\nonly occasional visits to London. During those visits his chief business\r\nwas to watch Johnson, to discover all Johnson’s habits, to turn the\r\nconversation to subjects about which Johnson was likely to say something\r\nremarkable, and to fill quarto note books with minutes of what Johnson\r\nhad said. In this way were gathered the materials {206}out of which was\r\nafterwards constructed the most interesting biographical work in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nSoon after the club began to exist, Johnson formed a connection less\r\nimportant indeed to his fame, but much more important to his happiness,\r\nthan his connection with Boswell. Henry Thrale, one of the most opulent\r\nbrewers in the kingdom, a man of sound and cultivated understanding,\r\nrigid principles, and liberal spirit, was married to one of those\r\nclever, kind-hearted, engaging, vain, pert young women, who are\r\nperpetually doing or saying what is not exactly right, but who do or\r\nsay what they may, are always agreeable. In 1765 the Thrales became\r\nacquainted with Johnson; and the acquaintance ripened last into\r\nfriendship. They were astonished and delighted by the brilliancy of\r\nhis conversation. They were flattered by finding that a man so widely\r\ncelebrated preferred their house to any other in London. Even the\r\npeculiarities which seemed to unfit him for civilised society, his\r\ngesticulations, his rollings, his puffings, his mutterings, the strange\r\nway in which he put on his clothes, the ravenous eagerness with which\r\nhe devoured his dinner, his fits of melancholy, his fits of anger, his\r\nfrequent rudeness, his occasional ferocity, increased the interest which\r\nhis new associates took in him. For these things were the cruel marks\r\nleft behind by a life which had been one long conflict with disease and\r\nwith adversity. In a vulgar hack writer such oddities would have excited\r\nonly disgust. But in a man of genius, learning, and virtue their effect\r\nwas to add pity to admiration and esteem. Johnson soon had an apartment\r\nat the brewery in Southwark, and a still more pleasant apartment at the\r\nvilla of his friends on Streatham Common. A large part of every year he\r\npassed in those abodes, abodes {207}which must have seemed magnificent\r\nand luxurious indeed, when compared with the dens in which he had\r\ngenerally been lodged. But his chief pleasures were derived from what\r\nthe astronomer of his Abyssinian tale called “the endearing elegance of\r\nfemale friendship.” Mrs. Thrale rallied him, soothed him, coaxed him,\r\nand, if she sometimes provoked him by her flippancy, made ample amends\r\nby listening to his reproofs with angelic sweetness of temper. When he\r\nwas diseased in body and in mind, she was the most tender of nurses.\r\nNo comfort that wealth could purchase, no contrivance that womanly\r\ningenuity, set to work by womanly compassion, could devise, was wanting\r\nto his sick room. He requited her kindness by an affection pure as the\r\naffection of a father, yet delicately tinged with a gallantry, which,\r\nthough awkward, must have been more flattering than the attentions of a\r\ncrowd of the fools who gloried in the names, now obsolete, of Buck and\r\nMaccaroni. It should seem that a full half of Johnson’s life, during\r\nabout sixteen years, was passed under the roof of the Thrales. He\r\naccompanied the family sometimes to Bath, and sometimes to Brighton,\r\nonce to Wales, and once to Paris. But he had at the same time a house in\r\none of the narrow and gloomy courts on the north of Fleet Street. In the\r\ngarrets was his library, a large and miscellaneous collection of books,\r\nfalling to pieces and begrimed with dust. On a lower floor he sometimes,\r\nbut very rarely, regaled a friend with a plain dinner, a veal pie, or\r\na leg of lamb and spinage, and a rice pudding. Nor was the dwelling\r\nuninhabited during his long absences. It was the home of the most\r\nextraordinary assemblage of inmates that ever was brought together. At\r\nthe head of the establishment Johnson {208}had placed an old lady\r\nnamed Williams, whose chief recommendations were her blindness and her\r\npoverty. But, in spite of her murmurs and reproaches, he gave an asylum\r\nto another lady who was as poor as herself, Mrs. Desmoulins, whose\r\nfamily he had known many years before in Staffordshire. Room was found\r\nfor the daughter of Mrs. Desmoulins, and for another destitute damsel,\r\nwho was generally addressed as Miss Carmichael, but whom her generous\r\nhost called Polly. An old quack doctor named Levett, who bled and dosed\r\ncoal-heavers and hackney coachmen, and received for fees crusts of\r\nbread, bits of bacon, glasses of gin, and sometimes a little copper,\r\ncompleted this strange menagerie. All these poor creatures were at\r\nconstant war with each other, and with Johnson’s negro servant Frank.\r\nSometimes, indeed, they transferred their hostilities from the servant\r\nto the master, complained that a better table was not kept for them, and\r\nrailed or maundered till their benefactor was glad to make his escape\r\nto Streatham, or to the Mitre Tavern. And yet he, who was generally\r\nthe haughtiest and most irritable of mankind, who was but too prompt to\r\nresent anything which looked like a slight on the part of a purse-proud\r\nbookseller, or of a noble and powerful patron, bore patiently from\r\nmendicants, who, but for his bounty, must have gone to the workhouse,\r\ninsults more provoking than those for which he had knocked down Osborne\r\nand bidden defiance to Chesterfield. Year after year Mrs. Williams and\r\nMrs. Desmoulins, Polly and Levett, continued to torment him and to live\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nThe course of life which has been described was interrupted in Johnson’s\r\nsixty-fourth year by an important event. He had early read an account of\r\nthe Hebrides, {209}and had been much interested by learning that there\r\nwas so near him a land peopled by a race which was still as rude and\r\nsimple as in the middle ages. A wish to become intimately acquainted\r\nwith a state of society so utterly unlike all that he had ever seen\r\nfrequently crossed his mind. But it is not probable that his curiosity\r\nwould have overcome his habitual sluggishness, and his love of the\r\nsmoke, the mud, and the cries of London, had not Boswell importuned him\r\nto attempt the adventure, and offered to be his squire. At length, in\r\nAugust 1773, Johnson crossed the Highland line, and plunged courageously\r\ninto what was then considered, by most Englishmen, as a dreary and\r\nperilous wilderness. After wandering about two months through the Celtic\r\nregion, sometimes in rude boats which did not protect him from the rain,\r\nand sometimes on small shaggy ponies which could hardly bear his weight,\r\nhe returned to his old haunts with a mind full of new images and new\r\ntheories. During the following year he employed himself in recording his\r\nadventures. About the beginning of 1775, his Journey to the Hebrides was\r\npublished, and was, during some weeks, the chief subject of conversation\r\nin all circles in which any attention was paid to literature. The\r\nbook is still read with pleasure. The narrative is entertaining; the\r\nspeculations, whether sound or unsound, are always ingenious; and\r\nthe style, though too stiff and pompous, is somewhat easier and more\r\ngraceful than that of his early writings. His prejudice against the\r\nScotch had at length become little more than matter of jest; and\r\nwhatever remained of the old feeling had been effectually removed by the\r\nkind and respectful hospitality with which he had been received in every\r\npart of Scotland. {210}It was, of course, not to be expected that an\r\nOxonian Tory should praise the Presbyterian polity and ritual, or that\r\nan eye accustomed to the hedgerows and parks of England should not be\r\nstruck by the bareness of Berwickshire and East Lothian. But even\r\nin censure Johnson’s tone is not unfriendly. The most enlightened\r\nScotchmen, with Lord Mansfield at their head, were well pleased. But\r\nsome foolish and ignorant Scotchmen were moved to anger by a little\r\nunpalatable truth which was mingled with much eulogy, and assailed him\r\nwhom they chose to consider as the enemy of their country with libels\r\nmuch more dishonourable to their country than anything that he had ever\r\nsaid or written. They published paragraphs in the newspapers, articles\r\nin the magazines, sixpenny pamphlets, five shilling books. One scribbler\r\nabused Johnson for being blear-eved: another for being a pensioner;\r\na third informed the world that one of the Doctor’s uncles had been\r\nconvicted of felony in Scotland, and had found that there was in that\r\ncountry one tree capable of supporting the weight of an Englishman.\r\nMacpherson, whose Fingal had been proved in the Journey to be an\r\nimpudent forgery, threatened to take vengeance with a cane. The only\r\neffect of this threat was that Johnson reiterated the charge of forgery\r\nin the most contemptuous terms, and walked about, during some time, with\r\na cudgel, which, if the impostor had not been too wise to encounter it,\r\nwould assuredly have descended upon him, to borrow the sublime language\r\nof his own epic poem, “like a hammer on the red son of the furnace.”\r\n\r\nOf other assailants Johnson took no notice whatever. He had early\r\nresolved never to be drawn into controversy; and he adhered to his\r\nresolution with a steadfastness {211}which is the more extraordinary,\r\nbecause he was, both intellectually and morally, of the stuff of which\r\ncontroversialists, are made. In conversation, he was a singularly eager,\r\nacute, and pertinacious disputant. When at a loss for good reasons,\r\nhe had recourse to sophistry; and, when heated by altercation, he made\r\nunsparing use of sarcasm and invective. But, when he took his pen in his\r\nhand, his whole character seemed to be changed. A hundred bad writers\r\nmisrepresented him and reviled him; but not one of the hundred could\r\nboast of having been thought by him worthy of a refutation, or even of\r\na retort. The Ken-ricks, Campbells, MacNicols, and Hendersons, did their\r\nbest to annoy him, in the hope that he would give them importance by\r\nanswering them. But the reader will in vain search his works for\r\nany allusion to Kenrick or Campbell, to MacNicol or Henderson. One\r\nScotchman, bent on vindicating the fame of Scotch learning, defied him\r\nto the combat in a detestable Latin hexameter.\r\n\r\n                   “Maxime, si tu vis, cupio contendere tecum.”\r\n\r\nBut Johnson took no notice of the challenge. He had learned, both from\r\nhis own observation and from literary history, in which he was deeply\r\nread, that the place of books in the public estimation is fixed, not by\r\nwhat is written about them, but by what is written in them; and that\r\nan author whose works are likely to live is very unwise if he stoops\r\nto wrangle with detractors whose works are certain to die. He always\r\nmaintained that fame was a shuttlecock which could be kept up only by\r\nbeing beaten back, as well as beaten forward, and which would soon fall\r\nif there were only one battledore. No saying was oftener in his mouth\r\nthan that, {212}fine apophthegm of Bentley, that no man was ever written\r\ndown but by himself.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, a few months after the appearance of the Journey to the\r\nHebrides, Johnson did what none of his envious assailants could have\r\ndone, and to a certain extent succeeded in writing himself down. The\r\ndisputes between England and her American colonies had reached a point\r\nat which no amicable adjustment was possible. Civil war was evidently\r\nimpending; and the ministers seem to have thought that the eloquence of\r\nJohnson might, with advantage be employed to inflame the nation against\r\nthe opposition here, and against the rebels beyond the Atlantic. He\r\nhad already written two or three tracts in defence of the foreign and\r\ndomestic policy of the government; and those tracts, though hardly\r\nworthy of him, were much superior to the crowd of pamphlets which lay on\r\nthe counters of Ahnon and Stockdale. But his Taxation No Tyranny was a\r\npitiable failure. The very title was a silly phrase, which can have been\r\nrecommended to his choice by nothing but a jingling alliteration which\r\nhe ought to have despised. The arguments were such as boys use in\r\ndebating societies. The pleasantry was as awkward as the gambols of a\r\nhippopotamus. Even Boswell was forced to own that, in this unfortunate\r\npiece, he could detect no trace of his master s powers. The general\r\nopinion was that the strong faculties which had produced the Dictionary\r\nand the Rambler were beginning to feel the effect of time and of\r\ndisease, and that the old man would best consult his credit by writing\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nBut this was a great mistake. Johnson had failed, not because his mind\r\nwas less vigorous than when he wrote Rasselas in the evenings of a week,\r\nbut because he {213}had foolishly chosen, or suffered others to choose\r\nfor him, a subject such as he would at no time have been competent\r\nto treat. He was in no sense a statesman. He never willingly read or\r\nthought or talked about affairs of state. He loved biography, literary\r\nhistory, the history of manners; but political history was positively\r\ndistasteful to him. The question at issue between the colonies and the\r\nmother country was a question about which he had really nothing to say.\r\nHe failed, therefore, as the greatest men must fail when they attempt\r\nto do that for which they are unfit; as Burke would have failed if Burke\r\nhad tried to write comedies like those of Sheridan; as Reynolds would\r\nhave failed if Reynolds had tried to paint landscapes like those\r\nof Wilson. Happily, Johnson soon had an opportunity of proving most\r\nsignally that his failure was not to be ascribed to intellectual decay.\r\n\r\nOn Easter Eve 1777, some persons, deputed by a meeting which consisted\r\nof forty of the first booksellers in London, called upon him. Though he\r\nhad some scruples about doing business at that season, he received his\r\nvisitors with much civility. They came to inform him that a new edition\r\nof the English poets, from Cowley downwards, was in contemplation, and\r\nto ask him to furnish short biographical prefaces. He readily undertook\r\nthe task, a task for which he was pre-eminently qualified. His knowledge\r\nof the literary history of England since the Restoration was unrivalled.\r\nThat knowledge he had derived partly from books, and partly from sources\r\nwhich had long been closed; from old Grub Street traditions; from the\r\ntalk of forgotten poetasters and pamphleteers who had long been lying in\r\nparish vaults; from the recollections of such men as Gilbert Walmesley,\r\nwho had conversed with {214}the wits of Button; Cibber, who had\r\nmutilated the plays of two generations of dramatists; Orrery, who had\r\nbeen admitted to the society of Swift; and Savage, who had rendered\r\nservices of no very honourable kind to Pope. The biographer therefore\r\nsate down to his task with a mind full of matter, he had at first\r\nintended to give only a paragraph to every minor poet, and only four or\r\nfive pages to the greatest name. But the flood of anecdote and criticism\r\noverflowed the narrow channel. The work, which was originally meant to\r\nconsist only of a few sheets, swelled into ten volumes, small volumes,\r\nit is true, and not closely printed. The first four appeared in 1779,\r\nthe remaining six in 1781.\r\n\r\nThe Lives of the Poets, are, on the whole, the best of Johnson’s works.\r\nThe narratives are as entertaining as any novel. The remarks on life and\r\non human nature are eminently shrewd and profound. The criticisms are\r\noften excellent, and, even when grossly and provokingly unjust, well\r\ndeserve to be studied. For, however erroneous they may be, they are\r\nnever silly. They are the judgments of a mind trammelled by prejudice\r\nand deficient in sensibility, but vigorous and acute. They therefore\r\ngenerally contain a portion of valuable truth which deserves to be\r\nseparated from the alloy; and, at the very worst, they mean something,\r\na praise to which much of what is called criticism in our time has no\r\npretensions.\r\n\r\nSavage’s Life Johnson reprinted nearly as it had appeared in 1744.\r\nWhoever, after reading that life, will turn to the other lives will be\r\nstruck by the difference of style. Since Johnson had been at ease in\r\nhis circumstances he had written little and had talked much. When,\r\ntherefore, he, after the lapse of years, resumed his {215}pen, the\r\nmannerism which he had contracted while he was in the constant habit\r\nof elaborate composition was less perceptible than formerly; and his\r\ndiction frequently had a colloquial ease which it had formerly wanted.\r\nThe improvement may be discerned by a skilful critic in the Journey to\r\nthe Hebrides, and in the Lives of the Poets is so obvious that it cannot\r\nescape the notice of the most careless reader.\r\n\r\nAmong the lives the best are perhaps those of Cowley, Dryden, and Pope.\r\nThe very worst is, beyond all doubt, that of Gray.\r\n\r\nThis great work at once became popular. There was, indeed, much just\r\nand much unjust censure: but even those who were loudest in blame were\r\nattracted by the book in spite of themselves. Malone computed the gains\r\nof the publishers at five or six thousand pounds. But the writer\r\nwas very poorly remunerated. Intending at first to write very\r\nshort prefaces, he had stipulated for only two hundred guineas. The\r\nbooksellers, when they saw how far his performance had surpassed his\r\npromise, added only another hundred. Indeed, Johnson, though he did not\r\ndespise, or affect to despise, money, and though his strong sense\r\nand long experience ought to have qualified him to protect his own\r\ninterests, seems to have been singularly unskilful and unlucky in his\r\nliterary bargains. He was generally reputed the first English writer of\r\nhis time. Yet several writers of his time sold their copyrights for sums\r\nsuch as he never ventured to ask. To give a single instance, Robertson\r\nreceived four thousand five hundred pounds for the History of Charles\r\nV.; and it is no disrespect to the memory of Robertson to say that the\r\nHistory of Charles V. is both a less valuable and a less amusing book\r\nthan the Lives of the Poets.\r\n\r\nJohnson {216}was now in his seventy-second year. The infirmities of\r\nage were coming last upon him. That inevitable event of which he never\r\nthought without horror was brought near to him; and his whole life was\r\ndarkened by the shadow of death. He had often to pay the cruel price of\r\nlongevity. Every year he lost what could never be replaced. The strange\r\ndependents to whom he had given shelter, and to whom, in spite of their\r\nfaults, he was strongly attached by habit, dropped off one by one;\r\nand, in the silence of his home, he regretted even the noise of their\r\nscolding matches. The kind and generous Thrale was no more; and it would\r\nhave been well if his wife had been laid beside him. But she survived to\r\nbe the laughing-stock of those who had envied her, and to draw from the\r\neyes of the old man who had loved her beyond anything in the world\r\ntears far more bitter than he would have shed over her grave. With\r\nsome estimable and many agreeable qualities, she was not made to be\r\nindependent. The control of a mind more steadfast than her own was\r\nnecessary to her respectability. While she was restrained by her\r\nhusband, a man of sense and firmness, indulgent to her taste in trifles,\r\nbut always the undisputed master of his house, her worst offences had\r\nbeen impertinent jokes, white lies, and short fits of pettishness ending\r\nin sunny good humour. But he was gone; and she was left an opulent widow\r\nof forty, with strong sensibility, volatile fancy, and slender judgment.\r\nShe soon fell in love with a music-master from Brescia, in whom nobody\r\nbut herself could discover anything to admire. Her pride, and perhaps\r\nsome better feelings, struggled hard against this degrading passion.\r\nBut the struggle irritated her nerves, soured her temper, and at length\r\nendangered her health. {217}Conscious that her choice was one which\r\nJohnson could not approve, she became desirous to escape from his\r\ninspection. Her manner towards him changed. She was sometimes cold and\r\nsometimes petulant. She did not conceal her joy when he left Streatham;\r\nshe never pressed him to return; and, if he came unbidden, she received\r\nhim in a manner which convinced him that he was no longer a welcome\r\nguest. He took the very intelligible hints which she gave. He read, for\r\nthe last time, a chapter of the Greek Testament in the library which had\r\nbeen formed by himself. In a solemn and tender prayer he commended the\r\nhouse and its inmates to the Divine protection, and, with emotions which\r\nchoked his voice and convulsed his powerful frame, left for ever that\r\nbeloved home for the gloomy and desolate house behind Fleet Street,\r\nwhere the few and evil days which still remained to him were to run out.\r\nHere, in June 1788, he had a paralytic stroke, from which, however,\r\nhe recovered, and which does not appear to have at all impaired his\r\nintellectual faculties. But other maladies came thick upon him. His\r\nasthma tormented him day and night. Dropsical symptoms made their\r\nappearance. While sinking under a Complication of diseases, he heard\r\nthat the woman whose friendship had been the chief happiness of sixteen\r\nyears of his life had married an Italian fiddler; that all London was\r\ncrying shame upon her; and that the newspapers and magazines were filled\r\nwith allusions to the Ephesian matron, and the two pictures in Hamlet.\r\nHe vehemently said that he would try to forget her existence. He never\r\nuttered her name. Every memorial of her which met his eye he flung\r\ninto the fire. She meanwhile fled from the laughter and hisses of\r\nher countrymen and countrywomen {218}to a land where she was unknown,\r\nhastened across Mount Cenis, and learned, while passing a merry\r\nChristmas of concerts and lemonade parties at Milan, that the great man\r\nwith whose name hers is inseparably associated had ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nHe had, in spite of much mental and bodily affliction, clung vehemently\r\nto life. The feeling described in that fine but gloomy paper which\r\ncloses the series of his Idlers seemed to grow stronger in him as his\r\nlast hour drew near. He fancied that he should be able to draw his\r\nbreath more easily in a southern climate, and would probably have set\r\nout for Rome and Naples, but for his fear of the expense of the journey.\r\nThat expense, indeed, he had the means of defraying; for he had laid\r\nup about two thousand pounds, the fruit of labours which had made the\r\nfortune of several publishers. But he was unwilling to break in upon\r\nthis hoard; and he seems to have wished even to keep its existence a\r\nsecret. Some of his friends hoped that the government might be induced\r\nto increase his pension to six hundred pounds a year: but this hope was\r\ndisappointed; and he resolved to stand one English winter more. That\r\nwinter was his last. His legs grew weaker; his breath grew shorter; the\r\nfatal water gathered fast, in spite of incisions which he, courageous\r\nagainst pain, but timid against death, urged his surgeons to make deeper\r\nand deeper. Though the tender care which had mitigated his sufferings\r\nduring months of sickness at Streatham was withdrawn, he was not left\r\ndesolate. The ablest physicians and surgeons attended him, and refused\r\nto accept fees from him. Burke parted from him with deep emotion.\r\nWindham sate much in the sick-room, arranged the pillows, and sent his\r\nown servant to watch a night by the bed.\r\n\r\nFrances {219}Burney, whom the old man had cherished with fatherly\r\nkindness, stood weeping at the door; while Langton, whose piety\r\neminently qualified him to be an adviser and comforter at such a time,\r\nreceived the last pressure of his friend’s hand within. When at length\r\nthe moment, dreaded through so many years, came close, the dark cloud\r\npassed away from Johnson’s mind. His temper became unusually patient and\r\ngentle; he ceased to think with terror of death, and of that which\r\nlies beyond death; and he spoke much of the mercy of God, and of the\r\npropitiation of Christ. In this serene frame of mind he died on the\r\n13th of December, 1781. He was laid, a week later, in Westminster Abbey,\r\namong the eminent men of whom he had been the historian,--Cowley and\r\nDenham, Dry-den and Congreve, Gay, Prior, and Addison.\r\n\r\nSince his death the popularity of his works--the Lives of the Poets,\r\nand, perhaps, the Vanity of Human Wishes, excepted--has greatly\r\ndiminished. His Dictionary has been altered by editors till it can\r\nscarcely be called his. An allusion to his Rambler or his Idler is not\r\nreadily apprehended in literary circles. The fame even of Rasselas has\r\ngrown somewhat dim. But, though the celebrity of the writings may have\r\ndeclined, the celebrity of the writer, strange to say, is as great as\r\never. Boswell’s book has done for him more than the best of his own\r\nbooks could do. The memory of other authors is kept alive by their\r\nworks. But the memory of Johnson keeps many of his works alive. The old\r\nphilosopher is still among us in the brown coat with the metal buttons\r\nand the shirt which ought to be at wash, blinking, puffing, rolling\r\nhis head, drumming with his fingers, tearing his meat like a tiger, and\r\nswallowing his tea in oceans. No human being who {220}has been more than\r\nseventy years in the grave is so well known to us. And it is but just\r\nto say that our intimate acquaintance with what he would himself have\r\ncalled the aufractuosities of his intellect and of his temper serves\r\nonly to strengthen our conviction that he was both a great and a good\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PITT\r\n\r\n(_Encyclopædia Britannica_, January 1859.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Pitt, {221}the second son of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, and\r\nof Lady Hester Grenville, daughter of Hester, Countess Temple, was born\r\non the 28th of May, 1759. The child inherited a name which, at the time\r\nof his birth, was the most illustrious in the civilised world, and was\r\npronounced by every Englishman with pride, and by every enemy of England\r\nwith mingled admiration and terror. During the first year of his life,\r\nevery month had its illuminations and bonfires, and every wind brought\r\nsome messenger charged with joyful tidings and hostile standards. In\r\nWestphalia the English infantry won a great battle which arrested the\r\narmies of Louis the Fifteenth in the midst of a career of conquest;\r\nBoscawen defeated one French fleet on the coast of Portugal; Hawke put\r\nto flight another in the Bay of Biscay; Johnson took Niagara; Amherst\r\ntook Ticonderoga; Wolfe died by the most enviable of deaths under the\r\nwalls of Quebec; Clive destroyed a Dutch armament in the Hooghly, and\r\nestablished the English supremacy in Bengal; Coote routed Lally at\r\nWandewash, and established the English supremacy in the Carnatic. The\r\nnation, while loudly applauding the successful warriors, considered them\r\nall, on sea and on land, in Europe, in America, {222}and in Asia, merely\r\nas instruments which received their direction from one superior mind.\r\nIt was the great William Pitt, the great commoner, who had vanquished\r\nFrench marshals in Germany, and French admirals on the Atlantic; who\r\nhad conquered for his country one great empire on the frozen shores\r\nof Ontario, and another under the tropical sun near the mouths of the\r\nGanges, it was not in the nature of things that popularity such as he\r\nat this time enjoyed should be permanent. That popularity had lost\r\nits gloss before his children were old enough to understand that their\r\nfather was a great man. He was at length placed in situations in which\r\nneither his talents for administration nor his talents for debate\r\nappeared to the best advantage. The energy and decision which Lad\r\neminently fitted him for the direction of war were not needed in time\r\nof peace. The lofty and spirit-stirring eloquence which had made him\r\nsupreme in the House of Commons often fell dead on the House of Lords. A\r\ncruel malady racked his joints, and left his joints only to fall on his\r\nnerves and on his brain. During the closing years of his life, he was\r\nodious to the court, and yet was not on cordial terms with the great\r\nbody of the opposition. Chatham was only the ruin of Pitt, but an\r\nawful and majestic ruin, not to be contemplated by any man of sense\r\nand feeling without emotions resembling those which are excited by the\r\nremains of the Parthenon and of the Coliseum. In one respect the old\r\nstatesman was eminently happy. Whatever might be the vicissitudes of his\r\npublic life, he never failed to find peace and love by his own hearth.\r\nFie loved all his children, and was loved by them; and, of all his\r\nchildren, the one of whom he was fondest and proudest was his second\r\nson.\r\n\r\nThe {223}child’s genius and ambition displayed themselves with a rare\r\nand almost unnatural precocity. At seven, the interest which he took in\r\ngrave subjects, the ardour with which he pursued his studies, and the\r\nsense and vivacity of his remarks on books and on events, amazed his\r\nparents and instructors. One of his sayings of this date was reported to\r\nhis mother by his tutor. In August, 1706, when the world was agitated\r\nby the news that Mr. Pitt had become Earl of Chatham, little William\r\nexclaimed: “I am glad that I am not the eldest son. I want to speak\r\nin the House of Commons like papa.” A letter is extant in which Lady\r\nChatham, a woman of considerable abilities, remarked to her lord, that\r\ntheir younger son at twelve had left far behind him his elder brother,\r\nwho was fifteen. “The fineness,” she wrote, “of William’s mind makes him\r\nenjoy with the greatest pleasure what would be above the reach of any\r\nother creature of his small age.” At fourteen the lad was in intellect a\r\nman. Hayley, who met him at Lyme in the summer of 1773, was astonished,\r\ndelighted, and somewhat overawed, by hearing wit and wisdom from so\r\nyoung a mouth. The poet, indeed, was afterwards sorry that his shyness\r\nhad prevented him from submitting the plan of an extensive literary\r\nwork, which he was then meditating, to the judgment of this\r\nextraordinary boy. The boy, indeed, had already written a tragedy, bad\r\nof course, but not worse than the tragedies of his friend. This piece\r\nis still preserved at Chevening, and is in some respects highly curious.\r\nThere is no love. The whole plot is political; and it is remarkable that\r\nthe interest, such as it is, turns on a contest about a regency. On one\r\nside is a faithful servant of the Crown, on the other an ambitious and\r\nunprincipled conspirator. At length the King, {224}who had been missing,\r\nreappears, resumes his power, and rewards the faithful defender of his\r\nrights. A reader who should judge only by internal evidence would have\r\nno hesitation in pronouncing that the play was written by some Pittite\r\npoetaster at the time of the rejoicings for the recovery of George the\r\nThird in 1780.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure with which William’s parents observed the rapid development\r\nof his intellectual powers was alloyed by apprehensions about his\r\nhealth. He shot up alarmingly fast; he was often ill, and always weak;\r\nand it was feared that it would be impossible to rear a stripling so\r\ntall, so slender, and so feeble. Port wine was prescribed by his medical\r\nadvisers: and it is said that he was, at fourteen, accustomed to take\r\nthis agreeable physic in quantities which would, in our abstemious\r\nage, be thought much more than sufficient for any full-grown man. This\r\nregimen, though it would probably have killed ninety-nine boys out of\r\na hundred, seems to have been well suited to the peculiarities of\r\nWilliam’s constitution; for at fifteen he ceased to be molested by\r\ndisease, and, though never a strong man, continued, during many years of\r\nlabour and anxiety, of nights passed in debate and of summers passed in\r\nLondon, to be a tolerably healthy one. It was probably on account of the\r\ndelicacy of his frame that he was not educated like other boys of the\r\nsame rank. Almost all the eminent English statesmen and orators to whom\r\nhe was afterwards opposed or allied, North, Fox, Shelburne, Windham,\r\nGrey, Wellesley, Grenville, Sheridan, Canning, went through the training\r\nof great public schools. Lord Chatham had himself been a distinguished\r\nEtonian: and it is seldom that a distinguished Etonian forgets his\r\nobligations to Eton. But William’s {225}infirmities required a vigilance\r\nand tenderness such as could be found only at home. He was therefore\r\nbred under the paternal roof. His studies were superintended by a\r\nclergyman named Wilson; and those studies, though often interrupted by\r\nillness, were prosecuted with extraordinary success. Before the lad\r\nhad completed his fifteenth year, his knowledge both of the ancient\r\nlanguages and of mathematics was such as very few men of eighteen then\r\ncarried up to college. He was therefore sent, towards the close of the\r\nyear 1773, to Pembroke Hall, in the university of Cambridge. So young a\r\nstudent required much more than the ordinary care which a college\r\ntutor bestows on undergraduates. The governor, to whom the direction\r\nof William’s academical life was confided, was a bachelor of arts named\r\nPretyman, who had been senior wrangler in the preceding year, and who,\r\nthough not a man of prepossessing appearance or brilliant parts,\r\nwas eminently acute and laborious, a sound scholar, and an excellent\r\ngeometrician. At Cambridge, Pretyman was, during more than two years,\r\nthe inseparable companion, and indeed almost the only companion, of his\r\npupil. A close and lasting friendship sprang up between the pair. The\r\ndisciple was able, before he completed his twenty-eighth year, to\r\nmake his preceptor Bishop of Lincoln and Dean of St. Paul’s; and the\r\npreceptor showed his gratitude by writing a life of the disciple, which\r\nenjoys the distinction of being the worst biographical work of its size\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nPitt, till he graduated, had scarcely one acquaintance, attended chapel\r\nregularly morning and evening, dined every day in hall, and never went\r\nto a single evening party. At seventeen, he was admitted, after the bad\r\nfashion of those times, by right of birth, without {226}any examination,\r\nto the degree of Master of Arts. But he continued during some years to\r\nreside at college, and to apply himself vigorously, under Prettyman’s\r\ndirection, to the studies of the place, while mixing freely in the best\r\nacademic society.\r\n\r\nThe stock of learning which Pitt laid in during this part of his life\r\nwas certainly very extraordinary. In fact, it was all that he ever\r\npossessed; for he very early became too busy to have any spare time\r\nfor books. The work in which he took the greatest delight was Newton’s\r\nPrincipia. His liking for mathematics, indeed, amounted to a passion,\r\nwhich, in the opinion of his instructors, themselves distinguished\r\nmathematicians, required to be cheeked rather than encouraged. The\r\nacuteness and readiness with which he solved problems was pronounced by\r\none of the ablest of the moderators, who in those days presided over\r\nthe disputations in the schools, and conducted the examinations of the\r\nSenate House, to be unrivalled in the university. Nor was the youth’s\r\nproficiency in classical learning less remarkable. In one respect,\r\nindeed, he appeared to disadvantage when compared with even second-rate\r\nand third-rate men from public schools. He had never, while under\r\nWilson’s care, been in the habit of composing in the ancient languages;\r\nand he therefore never acquired that knack of versification which is\r\nsometimes possessed by clever boys whose knowledge of the language and\r\nliterature of Greece and Rome is very superficial. It would have been\r\nutterly out of his power to produce such charming elegiac lines as those\r\nin which Wellesley bade farewell to Eton, or such Virgilian hexameters\r\nas those in which Canning described the pilgrimage to Mecca. But it\r\nmay be doubted whether any scholar has ever, at twenty, {227}had a\r\nmore solid and profound knowledge of the two great tongues of the old\r\ncivilised world. The facility with which he penetrated the meaning of\r\nthe most intricate sentences in the Attic writers astonished veteran\r\ncritics. He had set his heart on being intimately acquainted with all\r\nthe extant poetry of Greece, and was not satisfied till he had mastered\r\nLycophron’s Cassandra, the most obscure work in the whole range of\r\nancient literature. This strange rhapsody, the difficulties of which\r\nhave perplexed and repelled many excellent scholars, “he read,” says his\r\npreceptor, “with an ease at first sight, which, if I had not witnessed\r\nit, I should have thought beyond the compass of human intellect.”\r\n\r\nTo modern literature Pitt paid comparatively little attention. He knew\r\nno living language except French; and French he knew very imperfectly.\r\nWith a few of the best English writers he was intimate, particularly\r\nwith Shakspeare and Milton. The debate in Pandemonium, was, as it well\r\ndeserved to be, one of his favourite passages; and his early friends\r\nused to talk, long after his death, of the just emphasis and the\r\nmelodious cadence with which they had heard him recite the incomparable\r\nspeech of Belial. He had indeed been carefully trained from infancy in\r\nthe art of managing his voice, a voice naturally clear and deep-toned.\r\nHis father, whose oratory owed no small part of its effect to that art,\r\nhad been a most skilful and judicious instructor. At a later period,\r\nthe wits of Brookes’s, irritated by observing, night after night, how\r\npowerfully Pitt’s sonorous elocution fascinated the rows of country\r\ngentlemen, reproached him with having been “taught by his dad on a\r\nstool.”\r\n\r\nHis education, indeed, was well adapted to form a great\r\n{228}parliamentary speaker. One argument often urged against those\r\nclassical studies which occupy so large a part of the early life of\r\nevery gentleman bred in the south of our island is, that they prevent\r\nhim from acquiring a command of his mother tongue, and that it is not\r\nunusual to meet with a youth of excellent parts, who writes Ciceronian\r\nLatin prose and Horatian Latin Aleaics, but who would find it impossible\r\nto express his thoughts in pure, perspicuous, and forcible English.\r\nThere may perhaps be some truth in this observation. But the classical\r\nstudies of Pitt were carried on in a peculiar manner, and had the effect\r\nof enriching his English vocabulary, and of making him wonderfully\r\nexpert in the art of constructing correct English sentences. His\r\npractice was to look over a page or two of a Greek or Latin author,\r\nto make himself master of the meaning, and then to read the passage\r\nstraight-forward into his own language. This practice, begun under his\r\nfirst teacher Wilson, was continued under Pretyman. It is not strange\r\nthat a young man of great abilities, who had been exercised daily in\r\nthis way during ten years, should have acquired an almost unrivalled\r\npower of putting his thoughts, without premeditation, into words well\r\nselected and well arranged.\r\n\r\nOf all the remains of antiquity, the orations were those on which he\r\nbestowed the most minute examination. His favourite employment was to\r\ncompare harangues on opposite sides of the same question, to analyse\r\nthem, and to observe which of the arguments of the first speaker were\r\nrefuted by the second, which were evaded, and which were left untouched.\r\nNor was it only in books that he at this time studied the art\r\nof parliamentary fencing. When he was at home, he had frequent\r\nopportunities of hearing important debates {229}at Westminster; and\r\nhe heard them, not only with interest and enjoyment, but with a close\r\nscientific attention resembling that with which a diligent pupil at\r\nGuy’s Hospital watches every turn of the hand of a great surgeon through\r\na difficult operation. On one of these occasions, Pitt, a youth whose\r\nabilities were as yet known onlv to his own family and to a small knot\r\nof college friends, was introduced on the steps of the throne in the\r\nHouse of Lords to Fox, who was his senior by eleven years, and who was\r\nalready the greatest debater, and one of the greatest orators, that\r\nhad appeared in England. Fox used afterwards to relate that, as the\r\ndiscussion proceeded, Pitt repeatedly turned to him, and said, “But\r\nsurely, Mr. Fox, that might be met thus;” or, “Yes; but he lays himself\r\nopen to this retort.” What the particular criticisms were Fox had\r\nforgotten; but he said that he was much struck at the time by the\r\nprecocity of a lad who, through the whole sitting, seemed to be thinking\r\nonly how all the speeches on both sides could be answered.\r\n\r\nOne of the young man’s visits to the House of Lords was a sad and\r\nmemorable era in his life. He had not quite completed his nineteenth\r\nyear, when, on the 7th of April, 1778, he attended his father to\r\nWestminster. A great debate was expected. It was known that France had\r\nrecognised the independence of the United States. The Duke of Richmond\r\nwas about to declare his opinion that all thought of sublimating those\r\nstates ought to be relinquished. Chatham had always maintained that the\r\nresistance of the colonies to the mother country was justifiable. But he\r\nconceived, very erroneously, that on the day on which their independence\r\nshould be acknowledged the greatness of England would be at an end.\r\nThough sinking under the weight of years and infirmities, {230}he\r\ndetermined, in spite of the entreaties of his family, to be in his\r\nplace. His son supported him to a seat. The excitement and exertion were\r\ntoo much for the old man. In the very act of addressing the peers, he\r\nfell back in convulsions. A few weeks later his corpse was borne, with\r\ngloomy pomp, from the Painted Chamber to the Abbey. The favourite child\r\nand namesake of the deceased statesman followed the coffin as chief\r\nmourner, and saw it deposited in the transept where his own was destined\r\nto he.\r\n\r\nHis elder brother, now Earl of Chatham, had means sufficient, and barely\r\nsufficient, to support the dignity of the peerage. The other members of\r\nthe family were poorly provided for. William had little more than three\r\nhundred a year. It was necessary for him to follow a profession. He had\r\nalready begun to eat his terms. In the spring of 1780 he came of age.\r\nHe then quitted Cambridge, was called to the bar, took Chambers in\r\nLincoln’s Inn, and joined the western circuit. In the autumn of\r\nthat year a General election took place; and he offered himself as a\r\ncandidate for the university; but he was at the bottom of the poll. It\r\nis said that the grave doctors, who then sate, robed in scarlet, on the\r\nbenches of Golgotha, thought it great presumption in so young a man\r\nto solicit so high a distinction. He was, however, at the request of a\r\nhereditary friend, the Duke of Rutland, brought into Parliament by Sir\r\nJames Lowther for the borough of Appleby.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of the country were at that time such as might well have\r\ndisturbed even a constant mind. Army after army had been sent in vain\r\nagainst the rebellious colonists of North America. On pitched fields of\r\nbattle the advantage had been with the disciplined troops {231}of the\r\nmother country. But it was not on pitched fields of battle that the\r\nevent of such a contest could be decided. An armed nation, with hunger\r\nand the Atlantic for auxiliaries, was not to be subjugated. Meanwhile\r\nthe House of Bourbon, humbled to the dust a few years before by the\r\ngenius and vigour of Chatham, had seized the opportunity of revenge.\r\nFrance and Spain were united against us, and had recently been joined by\r\nHolland. The command of the Mediterranean had been for a time lost. The\r\nBritish flag had been scarcely able to maintain itself in the British\r\nChannel. The northern powers professed neutrality; but their neutrality\r\nhad a menacing aspect. In the East, Hyder had descended on the Carnatic,\r\nhad destroyed the little army of Baillie, and had spread terror even to\r\nthe ramparts of Fort St. George. The discontents of Ireland threatened\r\nnothing less than civil war. In England the authority of the government\r\nhad sunk to the lowest point. The King and the House of Commons were\r\nalike unpopular. The cry for parliamentary reform was scarcely less\r\nloud and vehement than in the autumn of 1830. Formidable associations,\r\nheaded, not by ordinary demagogues, but by men of high rank, stainless\r\ncharacter, and distinguished ability, demanded a revision of the\r\nrepresentative system. The populace, emboldened by the impotence and\r\nirresolution of the government, had recently broken loose from all\r\nrestraint, besieged the chambers of the legislature, hustled peers,\r\nhunted bishops, attacked the residences of ambassadors, opened prisons,\r\nburned and pulled down houses. London had presented during some days\r\nthe aspect of a city taken by storm; and it had been necessary to form a\r\ncamp among the trees of Saint James’s Park.\r\n\r\nIn {232}spite of dangers and difficulties abroad and at home, George\r\nthe Third, with a firmness which had little affinity with virtue or with\r\nwisdom, persisted in his determination to put down the American rebels\r\nby force of arms; and his ministers submitted their judgment to his.\r\nSome of them were probably actuated merely by selfish cupidity; but\r\ntheir chief, Lord North, a man of high honour, amiable temper, winning\r\nmanners, lively wit, and excellent talents both for business and for\r\ndebate, must be acquitted of all sordid motives. He remained at a post\r\nfrom which he had long wished and had repeatedly tried to escape, only\r\nbecause he had not sufficient fortitude to resist the entreaties and\r\nreproaches of the King, who silenced all arguments by passionately\r\nasking whether any gentleman, any man of spirit, could have the heart to\r\ndesert a kind master in the hour of extremity.\r\n\r\nThe opposition consisted of two parties which had once been hostile to\r\neach other, and which had been very slowly, and, as it soon appeared,\r\nvery imperfectly reconciled, but which at this conjuncture seemed to act\r\ntogether with cordiality. The larger of these parties consisted of the\r\ngreat body of the Whig aristocracy. Its head was Charles, Marquess of\r\nRockingham, a man of sense and virtue, and in wealth and parliamentary\r\ninterest equalled by very few of the English nobles, but afflicted with\r\na nervous timidity which prevented him from taking a prominent part in\r\ndebate, In the House of Commons, the adherents of Rockingham were led\r\nby Fox, whose dissipated habits and ruined fortunes were the talk of the\r\nwhole town, but whose commanding genius, and whose sweet, generous, and\r\naffectionate disposition, extorted the admiration and love of those who\r\nmost lamented the errors of his private {233}life. Burke, superior\r\nto Fox in largeness of comprehension, in extent of knowledge, and in\r\nsplendour of imagination, but less skilled in that kind of logic and in\r\nthat kind of rhetoric which convince and persuade great assemblies, was\r\nwilling to be the lieutenant of a young chief who might have been his\r\nson.\r\n\r\nA smaller section of the opposition was composed of the old followers\r\nof Chatham. At their head was William, Earl of Shelburne, distinguished\r\nboth as a statesman and as a lover of science and letters. With him were\r\nleagued Lord Camden, who had formerly held the Great Seal, and whose\r\nintegrity, ability, and constitutional knowledge commanded the public\r\nrespect; Barré, an eloquent and acrimonious declaimer; and Dunning, who\r\nhad long held the first place at the English bar. It was to this party\r\nthat Pitt was naturally attracted.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of February 1781 he made his first speech, in favour of\r\nBurke’s plan of economical reform. Fox stood up at the same moment,\r\nbut instantly gave way. The lofty yet animated deportment of the young\r\nmember, his perfect self-possession, the readiness with which he replied\r\nto the orators who had preceded him, the silver tones of his voice,\r\nthe perfect structure of his unpremeditated sentences, astonished and\r\ndelighted his hearers. Burke, moved even to tears, exclaimed, “It is not\r\na chip of the old block; it is the old block itself.” “Pitt will be one\r\nof the first men in Parliament,” said a member of the opposition to Fox.\r\n“He is so already,” answered Fox, in whose nature envy had no place.\r\nIt is a curious fact, well remembered by some who were very recently\r\nliving, that soon after this debate Pitt’s name was put up by Fox at\r\nBrookes’s.\r\n\r\nOn two subsequent occasions during that session Pitt {234}addressed the\r\nhouse, and on both fully sustained the reputation which he had acquired\r\non his first appearance. In the summer, after the prorogation, he again\r\nwent the western circuit, held several briefs, and acquitted himself in\r\nsuch a manner that he was highly complimented by Puller from the bench,\r\nand by Dunning at the bar.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of November the Parliament reassembled. Only forty-eight\r\nhours before had arrived tidings of the surrender of Cornwallis and\r\nhis army; and it had consequently been necessary to rewrite the royal\r\nspeech. Every man in the kingdom, except the King, was now convinced\r\nthat it was mere madness to think of conquering the United States.\r\nIn the debate on the report of the address, Pitt spoke with even\r\nmore energy and brilliancy than on any former occasion. He was warmly\r\napplauded by his allies; but it was remarked that no person on his\r\nown side of the house was so loud in eulogy as Henry Dundas, the Lord\r\nAdvocate of Scotland, who spoke from the ministerial ranks. That able\r\nand versatile politician distinctly foresaw the approaching downfall of\r\nthe government with which he was connected, and was preparing to make\r\nhis own escape from the ruin. From that night dates his connection with\r\nPitt, a connection which soon became a close intimacy, and which lasted\r\ntill it was dissolved by death.\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight later, Pitt spoke in the committee of supply on\r\nthe army estimates. Symptoms of dissension had begun to appear on the\r\nTreasury bench. Lord George Germaine, the Secretary of State who was\r\nespecially charged with the direction of the war in America, had held\r\nlanguage not easily to be reconciled with declarations made by the First\r\nLord of the Treasury. {235}Pitt noticed the discrepancy with much force\r\nand keenness. Lord George and Lord North began to whisper together; and\r\nWelbore Ellis, an ancient placeman who had been drawing salary almost\r\nevery quarter since the days of Henry Pelham, bent down between them to\r\nput in a word. Such interruptions sometimes discompose veteran speakers.\r\nPitt stopped, and, looking at the group, said, with admirable readiness,\r\n“I shall wait till Nestor has composed the dispute between Agamemnon and\r\nAchilles.”\r\n\r\nAfter several defeats, or victories hardly to be distinguished from\r\ndefeats, the ministry resigned. The King, reluctantly and ungraciously,\r\nconsented to accept Rockingham as first minister. Fox and Shelburne\r\nbecame Secretaries of State. Lord John Cavendish, one of the most\r\nupright and honourable of men, was made Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\nThurlow, whose abilities and force of character had made him the\r\ndictator of the House of Lords, continued to hold the great seal.\r\n\r\nTo Pitt was offered, through Shelburne, the Vice-Treasurership of\r\nIreland, one of the easiest and most highly paid places in the gift of\r\nthe Crown; but the offer was, without hesitation, declined. The young\r\nstatesman had resolved to accept no post which did not entitle him to a\r\nseat in the cabinet: and, a few days later, he announced that resolution\r\nin the House of Commons. It must be remembered that the cabinet was\r\nthen a much smaller and more select body than at present. We have seen\r\ncabinets of sixteen. In the time of our grandfathers a cabinet of ten or\r\neleven was thought inconveniently large. Seven was an usual number. Even\r\nBurke, who had taken the lucrative office of paymaster, was not in the\r\ncabinet. Many therefore {236}thought Pitt’s declaration indecent. He\r\nhimself was sorry that he had made it. The words, he said in private,\r\nhad escaped him in the heat of speaking; and he had no sooner uttered\r\nthem than he would have given the world to recall them. They, however,\r\ndid him no harm with the public. The second William Pitt, it was said,\r\nhad shown that he had inherited the spirit, as well as the genius, of\r\nthe first. In the son, as in the father, there might perhaps be too much\r\npride; but there was nothing low or sordid. It might be called arrogance\r\nin a young barrister, living in chambers on three hundred a year, to\r\nrefuse a salary of five thousand a year, merely because he did not\r\nchoose to bind himself to speak or vote for plans which he had no share\r\nin framing; but surely such arrogance was not very far removed from\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nPitt gave a general support to the administration of Rockingham, but\r\nomitted, in the meantime, no opportunity of courting that Ultra-Whig\r\nparty which the persecution of Wilkes and the Middlesex election had\r\ncalled into existence, and which the disastrous events of the war, and\r\nthe triumph of republican principles in America, had made formidable\r\nboth in numbers and in temper. He supported a motion for shortening the\r\nduration of Parliaments. He made a motion for a committee to examine\r\ninto the state of the representation, and, in the speech by which that\r\nmotion was introduced, avowed himself the enemy of the close boroughs,\r\nthe strongholds of that corruption to which he attributed all the\r\ncalamities of the nation, and which, as he phrased it in one of those\r\nexact and sonorous sentences of which he had a boundless command, had\r\ngrown with the growth of England and strengthened with her strength, but\r\nhad not diminished with her diminution {237}or decayed with her decay.\r\nOn this occasion he was supported by Fox. The motion was lost by\r\nonly twenty votes in a house of more than three hundred members. The\r\nreformers never again had so good a division till the year 1881.\r\n\r\nThe new administration was strong in abilities, and was more popular\r\nthan any administration which had held office since the first year of\r\nGeorge the Third, but was hated by the King, hesitatingly supported by\r\nthe Parliament, and torn by internal dissensions. The Chancellor\r\nwas disliked and distrusted by almost all his colleagues. The two\r\nSecretaries of State regarded each other with no friendly feeling. The\r\nline between their departments had not been traced with precision; and\r\nthere were consequently jealousies, encroachments, and complaints. It\r\nwas all that Rockingham could do to keep the peace in his cabinet; and,\r\nbefore the cabinet had existed three months, Rockingham died.\r\n\r\nIn an instant all was confusion. The adherents of the deceased statesman\r\nlooked on the Duke of Portland as their chief. The King placed Shelburne\r\nat the head of the Treasury. Fox, Lord John Cavendish, and Burke,\r\nimmediately resigned their offices; and the new prime minister was left\r\nto constitute a government out of very defective materials. His own\r\nparliamentary talents were great; but he could not be in the place where\r\nparliamentary talents were most needed. It was necessary to find some\r\nmember of the House of Commons who could confront the great orators of\r\nthe opposition; and Pitt alone had the eloquence and the courage which\r\nwere required. He was offered the great place of Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer; and he accepted it. He had scarcely completed his\r\ntwenty-third year.\r\n\r\nThe {238}Parliament was speedily prorogued. During the recess, a\r\nnegotiation for peace which had been commenced under Rockingham\r\nwas brought to a successful termination. England acknowledged the\r\nindependence of her revolted colonies; and she ceded to her European\r\nenemies some places in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico. But\r\nthe terms which she obtained were quite as advantageous and honourable\r\nas the events of the war entitled her to expect, or as she was likely to\r\nobtain by persevering in a contest against immense odds. All her vital\r\nparts, all the real sources of her power, remained uninjured. She\r\npreserved even her dignity; for she ceded to the House of Bourbon only\r\npart of what she had won from that House in previous wars. She retained\r\nher Indian empire undiminished; and, in spite of the mightiest efforts\r\nof two great monarchies, her flag still waved on the rock of Gibraltar.\r\nThere is not the slightest reason to believe that Fox, if he had\r\nremained in office, would have hesitated one moment about concluding\r\na treaty on such conditions. Unhappily that great and most amiable man\r\nwas, at this crisis, hurried by his passions into an error which made\r\nhis genius and his virtues, during a long course of years, almost\r\nuseless to his country.\r\n\r\nHe saw that the great body of the House of Commons was divided into\r\nthree parties, his own, that of North, and that of Shelburne; that none\r\nof those three parties was large enough to stand alone; that,\r\ntherefore, unless two of them united, there must be a miserably feeble\r\nadministration, or, more probably, a rapid succession of miserably\r\nfeeble administrations, and this at a time when a strong government was\r\nessential to the prosperity and respectability of the nation. It was\r\nthen necessary and right that there should be a coalition. {239}To\r\nevery possible coalition there were objections. But, of all possible\r\ncoalitions, that to which there were the fewest objections was\r\nundoubtedly a coalition between Shelburne and Fox. It would have been\r\ngenerally applauded by the followers of both. It might have been\r\nmade without any sacrifice of public principle on the part of either.\r\nUnhappily, recent bickerings had left in the mind of Fox a profound\r\ndislike and distrust of Shelburne. Pitt attempted to mediate, and was\r\nauthorised to invite Fox to return to the service of the Crown. “Is Lord\r\nShelburne,” said Fox, “to remain prime minister?” Pitt answered in the\r\naffirmative. “It is impossible that I can act under him,” said Fox.\r\n“Then negotiation is at an end,” said Pitt; “for I cannot betray him.”\r\n Thus the two statesmen parted. They were never again in a private room\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAs Fox and his friends would not treat with Shelburne, nothing\r\nremained to them but to treat with North. That fatal coalition which is\r\nemphatically called “The Coalition” was formed. Not three quarters of\r\na year had elapsed since Fox and Burke had threatened North with\r\nimpeachment, and had described him, night after night, as the most\r\narbitrary, the most corrupt, the most incapable of ministers. They now\r\nallied themselves with him for the purpose of driving from office a\r\nstatesman with whom they cannot be said to have differed as to any\r\nimportant question. Nor had they even the prudence and the patience to\r\nwait for some occasion on which they might, without inconsistency, have\r\ncombined with their old enemies in opposition to the government. That\r\nnothing might be wanting to the scandal, the great orators, who had,\r\nduring seven years, thundered against the war, determined {240}to join\r\nwith the authors of that war in passing a vote of censure on the peace.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament met before Christmas 1782. But it was not till January\r\n1783 that the preliminary treaties were signed. On the 17th of February\r\nthey were taken into consideration by the House of Commons. There\r\nhad been, during some days, floating rumours that Fox and North had\r\ncoalesced; and the debate indicated but too clearly that those rumours\r\nwere not unfounded. Pitt was suffering from indisposition: he did not\r\nrise till his own strength and that of his hearers were exhausted; and\r\nhe was consequently less successful than on any former occasion. His\r\nadmirers owned that his speech was feeble and petulant. He so far forgot\r\nhimself as to advise Sheridan to confine himself to amusing theatrical\r\naudiences. This ignoble sarcasm gave Sheridan an opportunity of\r\nretorting with great felicity. “After what I have seen and heard\r\ntonight,” he said, “I really feel strongly tempted to venture on a\r\ncompetition with so great an artist as Ben Jonson, and to bring on the\r\nstage a second Angry Boy.” On a division, the address proposed by the\r\nsupporters of the government was rejected by a majority of sixteen.\r\n\r\nBut Pitt was not a man to be disheartened by a single failure, or to\r\nbe put down by the most lively repartee. When, a few days later, the\r\nopposition proposed a resolution directly censuring the treaties, he\r\nspoke with an eloquence, energy, and dignity, which raised his fame\r\nand popularity higher than ever. To the coalition of Fox and North\r\nhe alluded in language which drew forth tumultuous applause from his\r\nfollowers. “If,” he said, “this ill-omened and unnatural marriage be not\r\nyet consummated, I know of a just and {241}lawful impediment; and, in\r\nthe name of the public weal, I forbid the banns.”\r\n\r\nThe ministers were again left in a minority; and Shelburne consequently\r\ntendered his resignation. It was accepted; but the King struggled long\r\nand hard before he submitted to the terms dictated by Fox, whose faults\r\nhe detested, and whose high spirit and powerful intellect he detested\r\nstill more. The first place at the board of Treasury was repeatedly\r\noffered to Pitt; but the offer, though tempting, was steadfastly\r\ndeclined. The young man, whose judgment was as precocious as his\r\neloquence, saw that his time was coming, but was not come, and was deaf\r\nto royal importunities and reproaches. His Majesty, bitterly complaining\r\nof Pitt’s faintheartedness, tried to break the coalition. Every art of\r\nseduction was practised on North, but in vain. During several weeks the\r\ncountry remained without a government. It was not till all devices had\r\nfailed, and till the aspect of the House of Commons became threatening,\r\nthat the King gave way. The Duke of Portland was declared First Lord of\r\nthe Treasury. Thurlow was dismissed. Fox and North became Secretaries of\r\nState, with power ostensibly equal. But Fox was the real prime minister.\r\n\r\nThe year was far advanced before the new arrangements were completed;\r\nand nothing very important was done during the remainder of the session.\r\nPitt, now seated on the opposition bench, brought the question of\r\nparliamentary reform a second time under the consideration of the\r\nCommons. He proposed to add to the House at once a hundred county\r\nmembers and several members for metropolitan districts, and to enact\r\nthat every borough of which an election committee {242}should report\r\nthat the majority of voters appeared to be corrupt should lose the\r\nfranchise. The motion was rejected by 203 votes to 140.\r\n\r\nAfter the prorogation, Pitt visited the Continent for the first and last\r\ntime. His travelling companion was one of his most intimate friends,\r\na young man of his own age, who had already distinguished himself in\r\nParliament by an engaging natural eloquence, set off by the sweetest\r\nand most exquisitely modulated of human voices, and whose affectionate\r\nheart, caressing manners, and brilliant wit, made him the most\r\ndelightful of companions, William Wilberforce. That was the time of\r\nAnglomania in France; and at Paris the son of the great Chatham was\r\nabsolutely hunted by men of letters and women of fashion, and forced,\r\nmuch against his will, into political disputation. One remarkable saying\r\nwhich dropped from him during this tour has been preserved. A French\r\ngentleman expressed some surprise at the immense influence which Fox, a\r\nman of pleasure, ruined by the dice-box and the turf, exercised over the\r\nEnglish nation. “You have not,” said Pitt, “been under the wand of the\r\nmagician.”\r\n\r\nIn November 1783 the Parliament met again. The government had\r\nirresistible strength in the House of Commons, and seemed to be scarcely\r\nless strong in the House of Lords, but was, in truth, surrounded on\r\nevery side by dangers. The King was impatiently waiting for the moment\r\nfit which he could emancipate himself from a yoke which galled him so\r\nseverely that he had more than once seriously thought of retiring to\r\nHanover; and the King was scarcely more eager for a change than the\r\nnation. Fox and North had committed a fatal error. They ought to have\r\nknown that coalitions {243}between parties which have long been hostile\r\ncan succeed only when the wish for coalition pervades the lower ranks\r\nof both. If the leaders unite before there is any disposition to union\r\namong the followers, the probability is that there will be a mutiny in\r\nboth camps, and that the two revolted armies will make a truce with each\r\nother, in order to be revenged on those by whom they think that they\r\nhave been betrayed. Thus it was in 1783. At the beginning of that\r\neventful year, North had been the recognised head of the old Tory party,\r\nwhich, though for a moment prostrated by the disastrous issue of the\r\nAmerican war, was still a great power in the state. To him the clergy,\r\nthe universities, and that large body of country gentlemen whose\r\nrallying cry was “Church and King,” had long looked up with respect and\r\nconfidence. Fox had, on the other hand, been the idol of the Whigs,\r\nand of the whole body of Protestant dissenters. The coalition at once\r\nalienated the most zealous Tories from North, and the most zealous Whigs\r\nfrom Fox. The University of Oxford, which had marked its approbation of\r\nNorth’s orthodoxy by electing him chancellor, the city of London, which\r\nhad been during two and twenty years at war with the Court, were equally\r\ndisgusted. Squires and rectors, who had inherited the principles of the\r\ncavaliers of the preceding century, could not forgive their old leader\r\nfor combining with disloyal subjects in order to put a force on the\r\nsovereign. The members of the Bill of Rights Society and of the Reform\r\nAssociations were enraged by learning that their favourite orator now\r\ncalled the great champion of tyranny and corruption his noble friend.\r\nTwo great multitudes were at once left without any head, and both at\r\nonce turned their eyes on Pitt. One party saw {244}in him the only man\r\nwho could rescue the King; the other saw in him the only man who could\r\npurify the Parliament. He was supported on one side by Archbishop\r\nMarkham, the preacher of divine right, and by Jenkinson, the captain of\r\nthe Praetorian band of the King’s friends; on the other side by Jebb and\r\nPriestley, Sawbridge and Cartwright, Jack Wilkes and Horne Tooke. On the\r\nbenches of the House of Commons, however, the ranks of the ministerial\r\nmajority were unbroken; and that any statesman would venture to brave\r\nsuch a majority was thought impossible. No prince of the Hanoverian\r\nline had ever, under any provocation, ventured to appeal from the\r\nrepresentative body to the constituent body. The ministers, therefore,\r\nnotwithstanding the sullen looks and muttered words of displeasure with\r\nwhich their suggestions were received in the closet, notwithstanding the\r\nroar of obloquy which was rising louder and louder every day from every\r\ncorner of the island, thought themselves secure.\r\n\r\nSuch was their confidence in their strength that, as soon as the\r\nParliament had met, they brought forward a singularly bold and original\r\nplan for the government of the British territories in India. What was\r\nproposed was that the whole authority, which till that time had been\r\nexercised over those territories by the East India Company, should be\r\ntransferred to seven Commissioners who were to be named by Parliament,\r\nand were not to be removable at the pleasure of the Crown. Earl\r\nFitzwilliam, the most intimate personal friend of Fox, was to be\r\nchairman of this board; and the eldest son of North was to be one of the\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the outlines of the scheme were known, all the hatred which\r\nthe coalition had excited burst forth {245}with an astounding explosion.\r\nThe question which ought undoubtedly to have been considered as\r\nparamount to every other was, whether the proposed change was likely to\r\nbe beneficial or injurious to the thirty millions of people who were\r\nsubject to the Company. But that question cannot be said to have been\r\neven seriously discussed. Burke, who, whether right or wrong in the\r\nconclusions to which he came, had at least the merit of looking at the\r\nsubject in the right point of view, vainly reminded his hearers of that\r\nmighty population whose daily rice might depend on a vote of the British\r\nParliament. He spoke, with even more than his wonted power of thought\r\nand language, about the desolation of Rohilcund, about the spoliation\r\nof Benares, about the evil policy which had suffered the tanks of the\r\nCarnatic to go to ruin; but he could scarcely obtain a hearing. The\r\ncontending parties, to their shame it must be said, would listen to none\r\nbut English topics. Out of doors the cry against the ministry was almost\r\nuniversal. Town and country were united. Corporations exclaimed against\r\nthe violation of the charter of the greatest corporation in the realm.\r\nTories and democrats joined in pronouncing the proposed board an\r\nunconstitutional body. It was to consist of Fox’s nominees. The effect\r\nof his bill was to give, not to the Crown, but to him personally,\r\nwhether in office or in opposition, an enormous power, a patronage\r\nsufficient to counterbalance the patronage of the Treasury and of the\r\nAdmiralty, and to decide the elections for fifty boroughs. He knew,\r\nit was said, that he was hateful alike to King and people; and he had\r\ndevised a plan which would make him independent of both. Some nicknamed\r\nhim Cromwell, and some Carlo Khan. Wilberforce, with his usual felicity\r\nof expression, {246}and with very unusual bitterness of feeling,\r\ndescribed the scheme as the genuine offspring of the coalition, as\r\nmarked with the features of both its parents, the corruption of one and\r\nthe violence of the other. In spite of all opposition, however, the bill\r\nwas supported in every stage by great majorities, was rapidly passed,\r\nand was sent up to the Lords. To the general astonishment, when the\r\nsecond readme was moved in the Upper House, the opposition proposed an\r\nadjournment, and carried it by eighty-seven votes to seventy-nine. The\r\ncause of this strange turn of fortune was soon known. Pitt’s cousin,\r\nEarl Temple, had been in the royal closet, and had there been authorised\r\nto let it be known that His Majesty would consider all who voted for\r\nthe bill as his enemies. The ignominious commission was performed; and\r\ninstantly a troop of Lords of the Bedchamber, of Bishops who wished to\r\nbe translated, and of Scotch peers who wished to be re-elected, made\r\nhaste to change sides. On a later day, the Lords rejected the bill. Fox\r\nand North were immediately directed to send their seals to the palace\r\nby their Under Secretaries; and Pitt was appointed First Lord of the\r\nTreasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion was, that there would be an immediate dissolution.\r\nBut Pitt wisely determined to give the public feeling time to gather\r\nstrength. On this point he differed from his kinsman Temple. The\r\nconsequence was, that Temple, who had been appointed one of the\r\nSecretaries of State, resigned his office forty-eight hours after he had\r\naccepted it, and thus relieved the new government from a great load of\r\nunpopularity; for all men of sense and honour, however strong might be\r\ntheir dislike of the India Bill, disapproved of the manner {247}in which\r\nthat bill had been thrown out. Temple carried away with him the scandal\r\nwhich the best friends of the new government could not but lament.\r\nThe fame of the young prime minister preserved its whiteness. He could\r\ndeclare with perfect truth that, if unconstitutional machinations had\r\nbeen employed, he had been no party to them.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, surrounded by difficulties and dangers. In the House of\r\nLords, indeed, he had a majority; nor could any orator of the opposition\r\nin that assembly be considered as a match for Thurlow, who was now again\r\nChancellor, or for Camden, who cordially supported the son of his old\r\nfriend Chatham. But in the other House there was not a single eminent\r\nspeaker among the official men who sate round Pitt. His most useful\r\nassistant was Dundas, who, though he had not eloquence, had sense,\r\nknowledge, readiness, and boldness. On the opposite benches was a\r\npowerful majority, led by Fox, who was supported by Burke, North, and\r\nSheridan. The heart of the young minister, stout as it was, almost died\r\nwithin him. He could not once close his eyes on the night which followed\r\nTemple’s resignation. But, whatever his internal emotions might be, his\r\nlanguage and deportment indicated nothing but unconquerable firmness and\r\nhaughty confidence in his own powers. His contest against the House of\r\nCommons lasted from the 17th of December, 1783, to the 8th of March,\r\n1781. In sixteen divisions the opposition triumphed. Again and again the\r\nKing was requested to dismiss his ministers. But he was determined to go\r\nto Germany rather than yield. Pitt’s resolution never wavered. The\r\ncry of the nation in his favour became vehement and almost furious.\r\nAddresses assuring him of public support came up daily from {248}every\r\npart of the kingdom. The freedom of the city of London was presented to\r\nhim in a gold box. He went in state to receive this mark of distinction.\r\nhe was sumptuously feasted in Grocers’ Hall; and the shopkeepers of the\r\nStrand and Fleet Street illuminated their houses in his honour. These\r\nthings could not but produce an effect within the walls of Parliament.\r\nThe ranks of the majority began to waver; a few passed over to the\r\nenemy; some skulked away; many were for capitulating while it was still\r\npossible to capitulate with the honours of war. Negotiations were opened\r\nwith the view of forming an administration on a wide basis; but they had\r\nscarcely been opened when they were closed. The opposition demanded,\r\nas a preliminary article of the treaty, that Pitt should resign the\r\nTreasury; and with this demand Pitt steadfastly refused to comply. While\r\nthe contest was raging, the Clerkship of the Pells, a sinecure place for\r\nlife, worth three thousand a year, and tenable with a seat in the House\r\nof Commons, became vacant. The appointment was with the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer: nobody doubted that he would appoint himself; and nobody\r\ncould have blamed him if he had done so: for such sinecure offices\r\nhad always been defended on the ground that they enabled a few men of\r\neminent abilities and small incomes to live without any profession, and\r\nto devote themselves to the service of the state. Pitt, in spite of\r\nthe remonstrances of his friends, gave the Pells to his father’s old\r\nadherent, Colonel Barré, a man distinguished by talent and eloquence,\r\nbut poor and afflicted with blindness. By this arrangement a pension\r\nwhich the Rockingham administration had granted to Barré was saved to\r\nthe public. Never was there a happier stroke of policy. About treaties,\r\n{249}wars, expeditions, tariffs, budgets, there will always be room\r\nfor dispute. The policy which is applauded by half the nation may be\r\ncondemned by the other half. But pecuniary disinterestedness everybody\r\ncomprehends. It is a great thing for a man who has only three hundred a\r\nyear to be able to show that he considers three thousand a year as mere\r\ndirt beneath his feet, when compared with the public interest and\r\nthe public esteem. Pitt had his reward. No minister was ever more\r\nrancorously libelled; but, even when he was known to be overwhelmed with\r\ndebt, when millions were passing through his hands, when the wealthiest\r\nmagnates of the realm were soliciting him for marquisates and garters,\r\nhis bitterest enemies did not dare to accuse him of touching unlawful\r\ngain.\r\n\r\nAt length the hard fought fight ended. A final remonstrance, drawn up by\r\nBurke with admirable skill, was carried on the 8th of March by a single\r\nvote in a full House. Had the experiment been repeated, the supporters\r\nof the coalition would probably have been in a minority. But the\r\nsupplies had been voted; the Mutiny Bill had been passed; and the\r\nParliament was dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe popular constituent bodies all over the country were in general\r\nenthusiastic on the side of the new government. A hundred and sixty of\r\nthe supporters of the coalition lost their seats. The First Lord of the\r\nTreasury himself came in at the head of the poll for the University\r\nof Cambridge. His young friend, Wilberforce, was elected knight of\r\nthe great shire of York, in opposition to the whole influence of the\r\nFitzwilliams, Cavendishes, Dundases, and Saviles. In the midst of such\r\ntriumphs Pitt completed his twenty-fifth year. He was now the greatest\r\nsubject that England had seen {250}during many generations. He\r\ndomineered absolutely over the cabinet, and was the favourite at once of\r\nthe Sovereign, of the Parliament, and of the nation. His father had never\r\nbeen so powerful, nor Walpole, nor Marlborough.\r\n\r\nThis narrative has now reached a point, beyond which a full history of\r\nthe life of Pitt would be a history of England, or rather of the whole\r\ncivilised world; and for such a history this is not the proper place.\r\nHere a very slight sketch must suffice; and in that sketch prominence\r\nwill be given to such points as may enable a reader who is already\r\nacquainted with the general course of events to form a just notion of\r\nthe character of the man on whom so much depended.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to arrive at a correct judgment of Pitt’s merits and defects,\r\nwe must never forget that he belonged to a peculiar class of statesmen,\r\nand that he must be tried by a peculiar standard. It is not easy to\r\ncompare him fairly with such men as Ximenes and Sully, Richelieu and\r\nOxenstiern, John de Witt and Warren Hastings. The means by which those\r\npoliticians governed great communities were of quite a different\r\nkind from those which Pitt was under the necessity of employing. Some\r\ntalents, which they never had any opportunity of showing that they\r\npossessed, were developed in him to an extraordinary degree. In some\r\nqualities, on the other hand, to which they owe a large part of their\r\nfame, he was decidedly their inferior. They transacted business in their\r\nclosets, or at boards where a few confidential councillors sate. It was\r\nhis lot to be born in an age and in a country in which parliamentary\r\ngovernment was completely established; his whole training from infancy\r\nwas such as fitted him to bear a part in parliamentary {251}government;\r\nand, from the prime of his manhood to his death, all the powers of\r\nhis vigorous mind were almost constantly exerted in the work of\r\nparliamentary government. He accordingly became the greatest master\r\nof the whole art of parliamentary government that has ever existed, a\r\ngreater than Montagne or Walpole, a greater than his father Chatham\r\nor his rival Fox, a greater than either of his illustrious successors\r\nCanning and Peel.\r\n\r\nParliamentary government, like every other contrivance of man, has its\r\nadvantages and its disadvantages. On the advantages there is no need\r\nto dilate. The history of England during the hundred and seventy years\r\nwhich have elapsed since the House of Commons became the most powerful\r\nbody in the state, her immense and still growing prosperity, her\r\nfreedom, her tranquillity, her greatness in arts, in sciences, and in\r\narms, her maritime ascendency, the marvels of her public credit, her\r\nAmerican, her African, her Australian, her Asiatic empires, sufficiently\r\nprove the excellence of her institutions. But those institutions,\r\nthough excellent, are assuredly not perfect. Parliamentary government is\r\ngovernment by speaking. In such a government, the power of speaking\r\nis the most highly prized of all the qualities which a politician\r\ncan possess; and that power may exist, in the highest degree, without\r\njudgment, without fortitude, without skill in reading the characters of\r\nmen or the signs of the times, without any knowledge of the principles\r\nof legislation or of political economy, and without any skill in\r\ndiplomacy or in the administration of war. Nay, it may well happen that\r\nthose very intellectual qualities which give a peculiar charm to the\r\nspeeches of a public man may be incompatible with the qualities which\r\nwould {252}fit him to meet a pressing emergency with promptitude and\r\nfirmness. It was thus with Charles Townshend. It was thus with Windham.\r\nIt was a privilege to listen to those accomplished and ingenious\r\norators. But in a perilous crisis they would have been found far\r\ninferior in all the qualities of rulers to such a man as Oliver\r\nCromwell, who talked nonsense, or as William the Silent, who did not\r\ntalk at all. When parliamentary government is established, a Charles\r\nTownshend or a Windham will almost always exercise much greater\r\ninfluence than such men as the great Protector of England, or as\r\nthe founder of the Batavian commonwealth. In such a government,\r\nparliamentary talent, though quite distinct from the talents of a\r\ngood executive or judicial official, will be a chief qualification for\r\nexecutive and judicial office. From the Book of Dignities a curious list\r\nmight be made out of Chancellors ignorant of the principles of\r\nequity, and First Lords of the Admiralty ignorant of the principles of\r\nnavigation, of Colonial ministers who could not repeat the names of\r\nthe Colonies, of Lords of the Treasury who did not know the difference\r\nbetween funded and unfunded debt, and of Secretaries of the India Board\r\nwho did not know whether the Mahrattas were Mahometans or Hindoos. On\r\nthese grounds, some persons, incapable of seeing more than one side of a\r\nquestion, have pronounced parliamentary government a positive evil, and\r\nhave maintained that the administration would be greatly improved if the\r\npower, now exercised by a large assembly, were transferred to a single\r\nperson. Men of sense will probably think the remedy very much worse than\r\nthe disease, and will be of opinion that there would be small gain in\r\nexchanging Charles Townshend {253}and Windham for the Prince of the\r\nPeace, or the poor slave and dog Steenie.\r\n\r\nPitt was emphatically the man of parliamentary government, the type of\r\nhis class, the minion, the child, the spoiled child, of the House of\r\nCommons. For the House of Commons he had a hereditary, an infantine\r\nlove. Through his whole boyhood, the House of Commons was never out of\r\nhis thoughts, or out of the thoughts of his instructors. Reciting at his\r\nfather’s knee, reading Thucydides and Cicero into English, analysing the\r\ngreat Attic speeches on the Embassy and on the Crown, he was constantly\r\nin training for the conflicts of the House of Commons. He was a\r\ndistinguished member of the House of Commons at twenty-one. The ability\r\nwhich he had displayed in the House of Commons made him the most\r\npowerful subject in Europe before he was twenty-five. It would have\r\nbeen happy for himself and for his country if his elevation had been\r\ndeferred. Eight or ten years, during which he would have had leisure and\r\nopportunity for reading and reflection, for foreign travel, for social\r\nintercourse and free exchange of thought on equal terms with a great\r\nvariety of companions, would have supplied what, without any fault\r\non his part, was wanting to his powerful intellect. He had all the\r\nknowledge that he could be expected to have; that is to say, all the\r\nknowledge that a man can acquire while he is a student at Cambridge, and\r\nall the knowledge that a man can acquire when he is First Lord of the\r\nTreasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer. But the stock of general\r\ninformation which he brought from college, extraordinary for a boy, was\r\nfar inferior to what Fox possessed, and beggarly when compared with\r\nthe massy, the splendid, the various treasures laid up in the large\r\n{254}mind of Burke. After Pitt became minister, he had no leisure to\r\nlearn more than was necessary for the purposes of the day which was\r\npassing over him. What was necessary for those purposes such a man could\r\nlearn with little difficulty, he was surrounded by experienced and able\r\npublic servants, he could at any moment command their best assistance.\r\nFrom the stores which they produced his vigorous mind rapidly collected\r\nthe materials for a good parliamentary case: and that was enough.\r\nLegislation and administration were with him secondary matters. To the\r\nwork of framing statutes, of negotiating treaties, of organising fleets\r\nand armies, of sending forth expeditions, he gave only the leavings of\r\nhis time and the dregs of his fine intellect. The strength and sap of\r\nhis mind were all drawn in a different direction. It was when the House\r\nof Commons was to be convinced and persuaded that he put forth all his\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nOf those powers we must form our estimate chiefly from tradition; for of\r\nall the eminent speakers of the last age Pitt has suffered most from\r\nthe reporters. Even while he was still living, critics remarked that\r\nhis eloquence could not be preserved, that he must be heard to be\r\nappreciated. They more than once applied to him the sentence in which\r\nTacitus describes the fate of a senator whose rhetoric was admired in\r\nthe Augustan age: “Haterii canorum illud et profluens cum ipso simul\r\nexstinctum est.” There is, however, abundant evidence that nature had\r\nbestowed on Pitt the talents of a great orator; and those talents had\r\nbeen developed in a very peculiar manner, first by his education, and\r\nsecondly by the high official position to which he rose early, and in\r\nwhich he passed the greater part of his public life.\r\n\r\nAt {255}his first appearance in Parliament he showed himself superior\r\nto all his contemporaries in command of language. He could pour forth\r\na long succession of round and stately periods, without premeditation,\r\nwithout ever pausing for a word, without ever repeating a word, in a\r\nvoice of silver clearness, and with a pronunciation so articulate that\r\nnot a letter was slurred over. He had less amplitude of mind and less\r\nrichness of imagination than Burke, less ingenuity than Windham, less\r\nwit than Sheridan, less perfect mastery of dialectical fence, and less\r\nof that highest sort of eloquence which consists of reason and passion\r\nfused together, than Fox. Yet the almost unanimous judgment of those\r\nwho were in the habit of listening to that remarkable race of men placed\r\nPitt, as a speaker, above Burke, above Windham, above Sheridan, and not\r\nbelow Fox. His declamation was copious, polished, and splendid. In power\r\nof sarcasm he was probably not surpassed by any speaker, ancient or\r\nmodern; and of this formidable weapon he made merciless use. In two\r\nparts of the oratorical art which are of the highest value to a minister\r\nof state he was singularly expert. No man knew better how to be luminous\r\nor how to be obscure. When he wished to be understood, he never failed\r\nto make himself understood. He could with ease present to his audience,\r\nnot perhaps an exact or profound, but a clear, popular, and plausible\r\nview of the most extensive and complicated subject. Nothing was out of\r\nplace; nothing was forgotten; minute details, dates, sums of money,\r\nwere all faithfully preserved in his memory. Even intricate questions of\r\nfinance, when explained by him, seemed clear to the plainest man\r\namong his hearers. On the other hand, when he did not wish to be\r\nexplicit,--and {256}no man who is at the head of affairs always wishes\r\nto be explicit,--he had a marvellous power of saying nothing in language\r\nwhich left on his audience the impression that he had said a great deal.\r\nHe was at once the only man who could open a budget without notes, and\r\nthe only man who, as Windham said, could speak that most elaborately\r\nevasive and unmeaning of human compositions, a King’s speech, without\r\npremeditation.\r\n\r\nThe effect of oratory will always to a great extent depend on the\r\ncharacter of the orator. There perhaps never were two speakers whose\r\neloquence had more of what may be called the race, more of the flavour\r\nimparted by moral qualities, than Fox and Pitt. The speeches of Fox owe\r\na great part of their charm to that warmth and softness of heart, that\r\nsympathy with human suffering, that admiration for everything great and\r\nbeautiful, and that hatred of cruelty and injustice, which interest and\r\ndelight us even in the most defective reports. No person, on the other\r\nhand, could hear Pitt without perceiving him to be a man of high,\r\nintrepid, and commanding spirit, proudly conscious of his own rectitude\r\nand of his own intellectual superiority, incapable of the low vices of\r\nfear and envy, but too prone to feel and to show disdain. Pride, indeed,\r\npervaded the whole man, was written in the harsh, rigid lines of his\r\nface, was marked by the way in which he walked, in which he sate,\r\nin which he stood, and, above all, in which he bowed. Such pride, of\r\ncourse, inflicted many wounds. It may confidently be affirmed that there\r\ncannot be found, in all the ten thousand invectives written against Fox,\r\na word indicating that his demeanour had ever made a single personal\r\nenemy. On the other hand, several men of note who had been partial\r\n{257}to Pitt, and who to the last continued to approve his public\r\nconduct and to support his administration, Cumberland, for example,\r\nBoswell, and Matthias, were so much irritated by the contempt with which\r\nhe treated them, that they complained in print of their wrongs. But his\r\npride, though it made him bitterly disliked by individuals, inspired\r\nthe great body of his followers in Parliament and throughout the country\r\nwith respect and confidence. They took him at his own valuation. They\r\nsaw that his self-esteem was not that of an upstart, who was drunk with\r\ngood luck and with applause, and who, if fortune turned, would sink from\r\narrogance into abject humility. It was that of the magnanimous man\r\nso finely described by Aristotle in the Ethics, of the man who thinks\r\nhimself worthy of great things, being in truth worthy. It sprang from\r\na consciousness of great powers and great virtues, and was never so\r\nconspicuously displayed as in the midst of difficulties and dangers\r\nwhich would have unnerved and bowed down any ordinary mind. It was\r\nclosely connected, too, with an ambition which had no mixture of low\r\ncupidity. There was something noble in the cynical disdain with which\r\nthe mighty minister scattered riches and titles to right and left among\r\nthose who valued them, while he spurned them out of his own way. Poor\r\nhimself, he was surrounded by friends on whom he had bestowed three\r\nthousand, six thousand, ten thousand a year. Plain Mister himself, he\r\nhad made more lords than any three ministers that had preceded him. The\r\ngarter, for which the first dukes in the kingdom were contending, was\r\nrepeatedly offered to him, and offered in vain.\r\n\r\nThe correctness of his private life added much to the dignity of his\r\npublic character. In the relations of son, brother, {258}uncle, master,\r\nfriend, his conduct was exemplary. In the small circle of his intimate\r\nassociates, he was amiable, affectionate, even playful. They loved him\r\nsincerely; they regretted him long; and they would hardly admit that\r\nhe who was so kind and gentle with them could be stern and haughty with\r\nothers. He indulged, indeed, somewhat too freely in wine, which he had\r\nearly been directed to take as a medicine, and which use had made a\r\nnecessary of life to him. But it was very seldom that any indication of\r\nundue excess could be detected in his tones or gestures; and, in truth,\r\ntwo bottles of port were little more to him than two dishes of tea.\r\nHe had, when he was first introduced into the clubs of Saint James’s\r\nStreet, shown a strong taste for play; but he had the prudence and the\r\nresolution to stop before this taste had acquired the strength of habit.\r\nFrom the passion which generally exercises the most tyrannical dominion\r\nOver the young he possessed an immunity, which is probably to be\r\nascribed partly to his temperament and partly to his situation. His\r\nconstitution was feeble; he was very shy; and he was very busy. The\r\nstrictness of his morals furnished such buffoons as Peter Pindar and\r\nCaptain Morris with an inexhaustible theme for merriment of no very\r\ndelicate kind. But the great body of the middle class of Englishmen\r\ncould not see the joke. They warmly praised the young statesman for\r\ncommanding his passions, and for covering his frailties, if he had\r\nfrailties, with decorous obscurity, and would have been very far indeed\r\nfrom thinking better of him if he had vindicated himself from the taunts\r\nof his enemies by taking under his protection a Nancy Parsons or a\r\nMarianne Clark.\r\n\r\nNo part of the immense popularity which Pitt long enjoyed {259}is to\r\nbe attributed to the eulogies of wits and poets. It might have been\r\nnaturally expected that a man of genius, of learning, of taste,\r\nan orator whose diction was often compared to that of Tully, the\r\nrepresentative, too, of a great university, would have taken a peculiar\r\npleasure in befriending eminent writers, to whatever political party\r\nthey might have belonged. The love of literature had induced Augustus\r\nto heap benefits on Pompeians, Somers to be the protector of nonjurors,\r\nHarley to make the fortunes of Whigs. But it could not move Pitt to show\r\nany favour even to Pittites. He was doubtless right in thinking that,\r\nin general, poetry, history and philosophy ought to be suffered, like\r\ncalico and cutlery, to find their proper price in the market, and\r\nthat to teach men of letters to look habitually to the state for their\r\nrecompense is bad for the state and bad for letters. Assuredly nothing\r\ncan be more absurd or mischievous than to waste the public money in\r\nbounties for the purpose of inducing people who ought to be weighing out\r\ngrocery or measuring out drapery to write bad or middling books. But,\r\nthough the sound rule is that authors should be left to be remunerated\r\nby their readers, there will, in every generation, be a few exceptions\r\nto this rule. To distinguish these special cases from the mass is an\r\nemployment well worthy of the faculties of a great and accomplished\r\nruler; and Pitt would assuredly have had little difficulty in finding\r\nsuch eases. While he was in power, the greatest philologist of the age,\r\nhis own contemporary at Cambridge, was reduced to earn a livelihood by\r\nthe lowest literary drudgery, and to spend in writing squibs for the\r\n_Morning Chronicle_. years to which we might have owed an all but\r\nperfect text of the whole tragic and comic drama of Athens. {260}The\r\ngreatest historian of the age, forced by poverty to leave his country,\r\ncompleted his immortal work on the shores of Lake Leman. The political\r\nheterodoxy of Person, and the religious heterodoxy of Gibbon, may\r\nperhaps be pleaded in defence of the minister by whom those eminent men\r\nwere neglected. But there were other cases in which no such excuse could\r\nbe set up. Scarcely had Pitt obtained possession of unbounded power when\r\nan aged writer of the highest eminence, who had made very little by his\r\nwritings, and who was sinking into the grave under a load of infirmities\r\nand sorrows, wanted five or six hundred pounds to enable him, during the\r\nwinter or two which might still remain to him, to draw his breath more\r\neasily in the soft climate of Italy. Not a farthing was to be obtained;\r\nand before Christmas the author of the English Dictionary and of the\r\nLives of the Poets had gasped his last in the river fog and coal smoke\r\nof Fleet Street. A few months after the death of Johnson appeared the\r\nTask, incomparably the best poem that any Englishman then living had\r\nproduced--a poem, too, which could hardly fail to excite in a well\r\nconstituted mind a feeling of esteem and compassion for the poet, a man\r\nof genius and virtue, whose means were scanty, and whom the most\r\ncruel of all the calamities incident to humanity had made incapable\r\nof supporting himself by vigorous and sustained exertion. Nowhere had\r\nChatham been praised with more enthusiasm, or in verse more worthy of\r\nthe subject, than in the Task. The son of Chatham, however, contented\r\nhimself with reading and admiring the book, and left the author to\r\nstarve. The pension which, long after, enabled poor Cowper to close his\r\nmelancholy life, unmolested by duns and bailiffs, was obtained for him\r\nby the {261}strenuous kindness of Lord Spencer. What a contrast between\r\nthe way in which Pitt acted towards Johnson and the way in which Lord\r\nGrey acted towards his political enemy Scott, when Scott, worn out by\r\nmisfortune and disease, was advised to try the effect of the Italian\r\nair! What a contrast between the way in which Pitt acted towards Cowper\r\nand the way in which Burke, a poor man and out of place, acted towards\r\nCrabbe! Even Dundas, who made no pretensions to literary taste, and was\r\ncontent to be considered as a hard-headed and somewhat coarse man of\r\nbusiness, was, when compared with his eloquent and classically educated\r\nfriend, a Maecenas or a Leo. Dundas made Burns an exciseman, with\r\nseventy pounds a year; and this was more than Pitt, during his long\r\ntenure of power, did for the encouragement of letters. Even those who\r\nmay think that it is, in general, no part of the duty of a government to\r\nreward literary merit will hardly deny that a government, which has much\r\nlucrative church preferment in its gift, is bound, in distributing that\r\npreferment, not to overlook divines whose writings have rendered great\r\nservice to the cause of religion. But it seems never to have occurred to\r\nPitt that he lay under any such obligation. All the theological works of\r\nall the numerous bishops whom he made and translated are not, when\r\nput together, worth fifty pages of the Horæ Paulinæ, of the Natural\r\nTheology, or of the View of the Evidences of Christianity. But on Paley\r\nthe all-powerful minister never bestowed the smallest benefice. Artists\r\nPitt treated as contemptuously as writers. For painting he did simply\r\nnothing. Sculptors, who had been selected to execute monuments voted by\r\nParliament, had to haunt the ante-chambers of the Treasury during many\r\nyears before {262}they could obtain a farthing from him. One of them,\r\nafter vainly soliciting the minister for payment during fourteen years,\r\nhad the courage to present a memorial to the King, and thus obtained\r\ntardy and ungracious justice. Architects it was absolutely necessary to\r\nemploy; and the worst that could be found seem to have been employed.\r\nNot a single fine public building of any kind or in any style was\r\nerected during his long administration. It may be confidently affirmed\r\nthat no ruler whose abilities and attainments would bear any comparison\r\nwith his has ever shown such cold disdain for what is excellent in arts\r\nand letters.\r\n\r\nHis first administration lasted seventeen years. That long period is\r\ndivided by a strongly marked line into two almost exactly equal parts.\r\nThe first part ended and the second began in the autumn of 1792.\r\nThroughout both parts Pitt displayed in the highest degree the talents\r\nof a parliamentary leader. During the first part he was a fortunate and,\r\nin many respects, a skilful administrator. With the difficulties which\r\nhe had to encounter during the second part he was altogether incapable\r\nof contending: but his eloquence and his perfect mastery of the tactics\r\nof the House of Commons concealed his incapacity from the multitude.\r\n\r\nThe eight years which followed the general election of 1784 were as\r\ntranquil and prosperous as any eight years in the whole history of\r\nEngland. Neighbouring nations which had lately been in arms against\r\nher, and which had flattered themselves that, in losing her American\r\ncolonies, she had lost a chief source of her wealth and of her power,\r\nsaw, with wonder and vexation, that she was more wealthy and more\r\npowerful than ever. Her trade increased. Her manufactures flourished.\r\nHer exchequer was full to overflowing.\r\n\r\nVery {263}idle apprehensions were generally entertained, that the public\r\ndebt, though much less than a third of the debt which we now bear with\r\nease, would be found too heavy for the strength of the nation. Those\r\napprehensions might not perhaps have been easily quieted by reason. But\r\nPitt quieted them by a juggle. He succeeded in persuading first himself,\r\nand then the whole nation, his opponents included, that a new sinking\r\nfund, which, so far as it differed from former sinking funds, differed\r\nfor the worse, would, by virtue of some mysterious power of propagation\r\nbelonging to money, put into the pocket of the public creditor great\r\nsums not taken out of the pocket of the tax-payer. The country,\r\nterrified by a danger which was no danger, hailed with delight and\r\nboundless confidence a remedy which was no remedy. The minister was\r\nalmost universally extolled as the greatest of financiers. Meanwhile\r\nboth the branches of the House of Bourbon found that England was as\r\nformidable an antagonist as she had ever been. France had formed a plan\r\nfor reducing Holland to vassalage. But England interposed; and France\r\nreceded. Spain interrupted by violence the trade of our merchants with\r\nthe regions near the Oregon. But England armed; and Spain receded.\r\nWithin the island there was profound tranquillity. The King was, for the\r\nfirst time, popular. During the twenty-three years which had followed\r\nhis accession he had not been loved by his subjects. His domestic\r\nvirtues were acknowledged. But it was generally thought that the good\r\nqualities by which he was distinguished in private life were wanting to\r\nhis political character. As a Sovereign, he was resentful, unforgiving,\r\nstubborn, cunning. Under his rule the country had sustained cruel\r\ndisgraces and disasters; and {264}every one of those disgraces and\r\ndisasters was imputed to his strong antipathies, and to his perverse\r\nobstinacy in the wrong. One statesman after another complained that\r\nhe had been induced by royal caresses, entreaties, and promises, to\r\nundertake the direction of affairs at a difficult conjuncture, and that,\r\nas soon as he had, not without sullying his fame and alienating his best\r\nfriends, served the turn for which he was wanted, his ungrateful master\r\nbegan to intrigue against him, and to canvass against him. Grenville,\r\nRockingham, Chatham, men of widely different characters, but all three\r\nupright and high-spirited, agreed in thinking that the Prince under whom\r\nthey had successively held the highest place in the government was one\r\nof the most insincere of mankind. His confidence was reposed, they said,\r\nnot in those known and responsible counsellors to whom he had delivered\r\nthe seals of office, but in secret advisers who stole up the back\r\nstairs into his closet. In Parliament, his ministers, while defending\r\nthemselves against the attacks of the opposition in front, were\r\nperpetually, at his instigation, assailed on the flank or in the rear by\r\na vile band of mercenaries who called themselves his friends. These\r\nmen constantly, while in possession of lucrative places in his service,\r\nspoke and voted against bills which he had authorised the First Lord of\r\nthe Treasury or the Secretary of State to bring in. But from the day on\r\nwhich Pitt was placed at the head of affairs there was an end of secret\r\ninfluence. His haughty and aspiring spirit was not to be satisfied\r\nwith the mere show of power. Any attempt to undermine him at Court,\r\nany mutinous movement among his followers in the House of Commons, was\r\ncertain to be at once put down. He had only to tender his resignation;\r\nand he could dictate {265}his own terms. For he, and he alone, stood\r\nbetween the Ivinp; and the Coalition. He was therefore little less than\r\nMayor of the Palace. The nation loudly applauded the King for having\r\nthe wisdom to repose entire confidence in so excellent a minister. His\r\nMajesty’s private virtues now began to produce their full effect. He\r\nwas generally regarded as the model of a respectable country gentleman,\r\nhonest, good-natured, sober, religious. He rose early: he dined\r\ntemperately: he was strictly faithful to his wife: he never missed\r\nchurch; and at church he never missed a response. His people heartily\r\nprayed that he might long reign over them; and they prayed the more\r\nheartily because his virtues were set off to the best advantage by the\r\nvices and follies of the Prince of Wales, who lived in close intimacy\r\nwith the chiefs of the opposition.\r\n\r\nHow strong this feeling was in the public mind appeared signally on\r\none great occasion. In the autumn of 1788 the King became insane.\r\nThe opposition, eager for office, committed the great indiscretion\r\nof asserting that the heir apparent had, by the fundamental laws of\r\nEngland, a right to be Regent with the full powers of royalty. Pitt, on\r\nthe other hand, maintained it to be the constitutional doctrine\r\nthat, when a Sovereign is, by reason of infancy, disease, or absence,\r\nincapable of exercising the regal functions, it belongs to the estates\r\nof the realm to determine who shall be the vicegerent, and with what\r\nportion of the executive authority such vicegerent shall be entrusted.\r\nA long and violent contest followed, in which Pitt was supported by the\r\ngreat body of the people with as much enthusiasm as during the first\r\nmonths of his administration. Tories with one voice applauded him for\r\n{266}defending the sick-bed of a virtuous and unhappy Sovereign against\r\na disloyal faction and an undutiful son. Not a few Whigs applauded him\r\nfor asserting the authority of Parliaments and the principles of the\r\nRevolution, in opposition to a doctrine which seemed to have too much\r\naffinity with the servile theory of indefeasible hereditary right. The\r\nmiddle class, always zealous on the side of decency and the domestic\r\nvirtues, looked forward with dismay to a reign resembling that of\r\nCharles II. The palace, which had now been, during thirty years, the\r\npattern of an English home, would be a public nuisance, a school of\r\nprofligacy. To the good King’s repast of mutton and lemonade, despatched\r\nat three o’clock, would succeed midnight banquets, from which the guests\r\nwould be carried home speechless. To the backgammon board at which the\r\ngood King played for a little silver with his equerries, would succeed\r\nfaro tables from which young patricians who had sate down rich would\r\nrise up beggars. The drawing-room, from which the frown of the Queen had\r\nrepelled a whole generation of frail beauties, would now be again what\r\nit had been in the days of Barbara Palmer and Louisa de Querouaille.\r\nNay, severely as the public reprobated the Prince’s many illicit\r\nattachments, his one virtuous attachment was reprobated more severely\r\nstill. Even in grave and pious circles his Protestant mistresses\r\ngave less scandal than his Popish wife. That he must be Regent nobody\r\nventured to deny. But he and his friends were so unpopular that Pitt\r\ncould, with general approbation, propose to limit the powers of the\r\nRegent by restrictions to which it would have been impossible to subject\r\na Prince beloved and trusted by the country. Some interested men, fully\r\nexpecting a change of administration, went over {267}to the opposition.\r\nBut the majority, purified by these desertions, closed its ranks, and\r\npresented a more firm array than ever to the enemy. In every division\r\nPitt was victorious. When at length, after a stormy interregnum of three\r\nmonths, it was announced, on the very eve of the inauguration of the\r\nRegent, that the King was himself again, the nation was wild with\r\ndelight. On the evening of the day on which His Majesty resumed his\r\nfunctions, a spontaneous illumination, the most general that had ever\r\nbeen seen in England, brightened the whole vast space from Highgate\r\nto Tooting, and from Hammersmith to Greenwich. On the day on which he\r\nreturned thanks in the cathedral of his capital, all the horses\r\nand carriages within a hundred miles of London were too few for the\r\nmultitudes which flocked to see him pass through the streets. A\r\nsecond illumination followed, which was even superior to the first in\r\nmagnificence. Pitt with difficulty escaped from the tumultuous kindness\r\nof an innumerable multitude which insisted on drawing his coach from\r\nSaint Paul’s Churchyard to Downing Street. This was the moment at\r\nwhich his fame and fortune may be said to have reached the zenith. His\r\ninfluence in the closet was as great as that of Carr or Milliers had\r\nbeen. His dominion over the Parliament was more absolute than that\r\nof Walpole or Pelham had been. He was at the same time as high in the\r\nfavour of the populace as ever Wilkes or Sacheverell had been. Nothing\r\ndid more to raise his character than his noble poverty. It was well\r\nknown that, if he had been dismissed from office after more than five\r\nyears of boundless power, he would hardly have carried out with him a\r\nsum sufficient to furnish the set of chambers in which, as he cheerfully\r\ndeclared, he meant to resume the {268}practice of the law. His admirers,\r\nhowever, were by no means disposed to suffer him to depend on daily toil\r\nfor his daily bread. The voluntary contributions which were awaiting his\r\nacceptance in the city of London alone would have sufficed to make him\r\na rich man. But it may be doubted whether his haughty spirit would have\r\nstooped to accept a provision so honourably earned and so honourably\r\nbestowed.\r\n\r\nTo such a height of power and glory had this extraordinary man risen\r\nat twenty-nine years of age. And now the tide was on the turn. Only ten\r\ndavs after the triumphant procession to Saint Paul’s, the States-General\r\nof France, after an interval of a hundred and seventy-four years, met at\r\nVersailles.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the great Revolution which followed was long very\r\nimperfectly understood in this country. Burke saw much further than any\r\nof his contemporaries: but whatever his sagacity descried was refracted\r\nand discoloured by his passions and his imagination. More than three\r\nyears elapsed before the principles of the English administration\r\nunderwent any material change. Nothing could as yet be milder or more\r\nstrictly constitutional than the minister’s domestic policy. Not a\r\nsingle act indicating an arbitrary temper or a jealousy of the people\r\ncould be imputed to him. He had never applied to Parliament for any\r\nextraordinary powers. He had never used with harshness the ordinary\r\npowers entrusted by the constitution to the executive government. Not a\r\nsingle state prosecution which would even now be called oppressive had\r\nbeen instituted by him. Indeed, the only oppressive state prosecution\r\ninstituted during the first eight years of his administration was that\r\nof Stockdale, which is to be attributed, not to the government, but\r\nto the chiefs of {269}the opposition. In office, Pitt had redeemed the\r\npledges which he had, at his entrance into public life, given to the\r\nsupporters of parliamentary reform. He had, in 1785, brought forward a\r\njudicious plan for the improvement of the representative system, and\r\nhad prevailed on the King, not only to refrain from talking against that\r\nplan, but to recommend it to the Houses in a speech from the throne. (1)\r\nThis attempt failed; but there can be little doubt that, if the French\r\nRevolution had not produced a violent reaction of public feeling, Pitt\r\nwould have performed, with little difficulty and no danger, that great\r\nwork which, at a later period, Lord Grey could accomplish only by means\r\nwhich for a time loosened the very foundations of the commonwealth.\r\nWhen the atrocities of the slave trade were first brought under the\r\nconsideration of Parliament, no abolitionist was more zealous than Pitt.\r\nWhen sickness prevented Wilberforce from appearing in public, his place\r\nwas most efficiently supplied by his friend the minister. A humane bill,\r\nwhich mitigated the horrors of the middle passage, was, in 1788,\r\ncarried by the eloquence and determined spirit of Pitt, in spite of\r\nthe opposition of some of his own colleagues; and it ought always to be\r\nremembered to his honour that, in order to carry that bill, he kept the\r\nHouses sitting, in spite of many murmurs, long after the business of the\r\ngovernment had been done, and the Appropriation Act passed. In 1791 he\r\ncordially concurred with Fox in maintaining the sound constitutional\r\ndoctrine, that an impeachment is not terminated by a\r\n\r\n     (1) The speech with which the King opened the session of\r\n     1785, concluded with an assurance that His Majesty would\r\n     heartily concur in every measure which could tend to secure\r\n     the true principles of the constitution. These words were at\r\n     the time understood to refer to Pitt’s Reform Bill.\r\n\r\ndissolution. {270}In the course of the some year the two great rivals\r\ncontended side by side in a far more important cause. They are fairly\r\nentitled to divide the high honour of having added to our statute-book\r\nthe inestimable law which places the liberty of the press under the\r\nprotection of juries. On one occasion, and one alone, Pitt, during the\r\nfirst half of his long administration, acted in a manner unworthy of an\r\nenlightened Whig. In the debate on the Test Act, he stooped to gratify\r\nthe master whom he served, the university which he represented, and\r\nthe great body of clergymen and country gentlemen on whose support\r\nhe rested, by talking, with little heartiness, indeed, and with no\r\nasperity, the language of a Tory. With this single exception, his\r\nconduct from the end of 1783 to the middle of 1792 was that of an honest\r\nfriend of civil and religious liberty.\r\n\r\nNor did anything, during that period, indicate that he loved war, or\r\nharboured any malevolent feeling against any neighbouring nation. Those\r\nFrench writers who have represented him as a Hannibal sworn in childhood\r\nby his father to bear eternal hatred to France, as having, by mysterious\r\nintrigues and lavish bribes, instigated the leading Jacobins to commit\r\nthose excesses which dishonoured the Revolution, as having been the real\r\nauthor of the first coalition, know nothing of his character or of his\r\nhistory. So far was he from being a deadly enemy to France, that his\r\nlaudable attempts to bring about a closer connection with that country\r\nby means of a wise and liberal treaty of commerce brought on him the\r\nsevere censure of the opposition. He was told in the House of Commons\r\nthat he was a degenerate son, and that his partiality, for the\r\nhereditary foes of our island was enough to make his {271}great father’s\r\nhones stir under the pavement of the Abbey.\r\n\r\nAnd this man, whose name, if he had been so fortunate as to die in\r\n1792, would now have been associated with peace, with freedom, with\r\nphilanthropy, with temperate reform, with mild and constitutional\r\nadministration, lived to associate his name with arbitrary government,\r\nwith harsh laws harshly executed, with alien bills, with gagging bills,\r\nwith suspensions of the Habeas Corpus Act, with cruel punishments\r\ninflicted on some political agitators, with unjustifiable prosecutions\r\ninstituted against others, and with the most costly and most sanguinary\r\nwars of modern times. He lived to be held up to obloquy as the stern\r\noppressor of England, and the indefatigable disturber of Europe. Poets,\r\ncontrasting his earlier with his later years, likened him sometimes to\r\nthe apostle who kissed in order to betray, and sometimes to the evil\r\nangels who kept not their first estate. A satirist of great genius\r\nintroduced the fiends of Famine, Slaughter, and Fire, proclaiming that\r\nthey had received their commission from One whose name was formed of\r\nfour letters, and promising to give their employer ample proofs of\r\ngratitude. Famine would gnaw the multitude till they should rise up\r\nagainst him in madness. The demon of Slaughter would impel them to tear\r\nhim from limb to limb. But Fire boasted that she alone could reward him\r\nas he deserved, and that she would cling round him to all eternity. By\r\nthe French press and the French tribune every crime that disgraced and\r\nevery calamity that afflicted France was ascribed to the monster Pitt\r\nand his guineas. While the Jacobins were dominant, it was he who had\r\ncorrupted the Gironde, who had raised Lyons and Bordeaux against the\r\nConvention, who {272}had suborned Paris to assassinate Lepelletier,\r\nand Cecilia Régnault to assassinate Robespierre. When the Thermidorian\r\nreaction came, all the atrocities of the Reign of Terror were imputed to\r\nhim. Cullot D’Herbois and Fouquier Tinville had been his pensioners. It\r\nwas he who had hired the murderers of September, who had dictated the\r\npamphlets of Marat and the Carmagnoles of Barrere, who had paid Lebon to\r\ndeluge Arras with blood, and Carrier to choice the Loire with corpses.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that he liked neither war nor arbitrary government. He was\r\na lover of peace and freedom, driven, by a stress against which it was\r\nhardly possible for any will or any intellect to struggle, out of the\r\ncourse to which his inclinations pointed, and for which his abilities\r\nand acquirements fitted him, and forced into a policy repugnant to his\r\nfeelings and unsuited to his talents.\r\n\r\nThe charge of apostasy is grossly unjust. A man ought no more to be\r\ncalled an apostate because his opinions alter with the opinions of the\r\ngreat body of his contemporaries than he ought to be called an oriental\r\ntraveller because he is always going round from west to east with the\r\nglobe and everything that is upon it. Between the spring of 1789 and the\r\nclose of 1792, the public mind of England underwent a great change. If\r\nthe change of Pitt’s sentiments attracted peculiar notice, it was not\r\nbecause he changed more than his neighbours; for in fact he changed less\r\nthan most of them; but because his position was far more conspicuous\r\nthan theirs; because he was, till Bonaparte appeared, the individual\r\nwho filled the greatest space in the eyes of the inhabitants of the\r\ncivilised world. During a short time the nation, and Pitt, as one of\r\nthe {273}nation, looked with interest and approbation on the French\r\nRevolution. But soon vast confiscations, the violent sweeping away of\r\nancient institutions, the domination of clubs, the barbarities of mobs\r\nmaddened by famine and hatred, produced a reaction here. The court, the\r\nnobility, the gentry, the clergy, the manufacturers, the merchants, in\r\nshort, nineteen twentieths of those who had good roofs over their heads\r\nand good coats on their backs, became eager and intolerant Antijacobins.\r\nThis feeling was at least as strong among the minister’s adversaries as\r\namong his supporters. Fox in vain attempted to restrain his followers.\r\nAll his genius, all his vast personal influence, could not prevent them\r\nfrom rising up against him in general mutiny. Burke set the example\r\nof revolt; and Burke was in no long time joined by Portland, Spencer,\r\nFitz-william, Loughborough, Carlisle, Malmesbury, Windham, Elliot. In\r\nthe House of Commons, the followers of the great Whig statesman and\r\norator diminished from about a hundred and sixty to fifty. In the House\r\nof Lords he had but ten or twelve adherents left. There can be no doubt\r\nthat there would have been a similar mutiny on the ministerial benches\r\nif Pitt had obstinately resisted the general wish. Pressed at once by\r\nhis master and by his colleagues, by old friends and by old opponents,\r\nhe abandoned, slowly and reluctantly, the policy which was dear to his\r\nheart. He laboured hard to avert the European war. When the European war\r\nbroke out, he still flattered himself that it would not be necessary for\r\nthis country to take either side. In the spring of 1792 he congratulated\r\nthe Parliament on the prospect of long and profound peace, and proved\r\nhis sincerity by proposing large remissions of taxation. Down to the end\r\nof that year he {274}continued to cherish the hope that England might be\r\nable to preserve neutrality. But the passions which raged on both sides\r\nof the Channel were not to be restrained. The republicans who ruled\r\nFrance were inflamed by a fanaticism resembling that of the Mussulmans,\r\nwho, with the Koran in one hand and the sword in the other, went forth,\r\nconquering and converting, eastward to the Bay of Bengal, and westward\r\nto the Pillars of Hercules. The higher and middle classes of England\r\nwere animated by zeal not less fiery than that of the Crusaders who\r\nraised the cry of _Deus vult_ at Clermont. The impulse which drove the\r\ntwo nations to a collision was not to be arrested by the abilities or\r\nby the authority of any single man. As Pitt was in front of his fellows,\r\nand towered high above them, he seemed to lead them. But in fact he was\r\nviolently pushed on by them, and, had he held back but a little more\r\nthan he did, would have been thrust out of their way or trampled under\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\nHe yielded to the current: and from that day his misfortunes began. The\r\ntruth is that there were only two consistent courses before him. Since\r\nhe did not choose to oppose himself, side by side with Fox, to the\r\npublic feeling, he should have taken the advice of Burke, and should\r\nhave availed himself of that feeling to the full extent. If it was\r\nimpossible to preserve peace, he should have adopted the only policy\r\nwhich could lead to victory. He should have proclaimed a Holy War for\r\nreligion, morality, property, order, public law, and should have thus\r\nopposed to the Jacobins an energy equal to their own. Unhappily he tried\r\nto find a middle path; and he found one which united all that was\r\nworst in both extremes. He went to war: but he would not understand the\r\npeculiar character of that {275}war. He was obstinately blind to the\r\nplain fact, that he was contending; against a state which was also a\r\nsect, and that the new quarrel between England and France was of quite\r\na different kind from the old quarrels about colonies in America and\r\nfortresses in the Netherlands. He had to combat frantic enthusiasm,\r\nboundless ambition, restless activity, the wildest and most audacious\r\nspirit of innovation; and he acted as if he had to deal with the harlots\r\nand fops of the old Court of Versailles, with Madame de Pompadour\r\nand the Abbé de Bernis. It was pitiable to hear him, year after year,\r\nproving to an admiring audience that the wicked Republic was exhausted,\r\nthat she could not hold out, that her credit was gone, and her assignats\r\nwere not worth more than the paper of which they were made; as if credit\r\nwas necessary to a government of which the principle was rapine, as if\r\nAlboin could not turn Italy into a desert till he had negotiated a loan\r\nat five per cent., as if the exchequer bills of Attila had been at par.\r\nIt was impossible that a man who so completely mistook the nature of\r\na contest could carry on that contest successfully. Great as Pitt’s\r\nabilities were, his military administration was that of a driveller. He\r\nwas at the head of a nation engaged in a struggle for life and death, of\r\na nation eminently distinguished by all the physical and all the moral\r\nqualities which make excellent soldiers. The resources at his command\r\nwere unlimited. The Parliament was even more ready to grant him men and\r\nmoney than he was to ask for them. In such an emergency, and with\r\nsuch means, such a statesman as Richelieu, as Louvois, as Chatham, as\r\nWellesley, would have created in a few months one of the finest armies\r\nin the world, and would soon have discovered and {276}brought forward\r\ngenerals worthy to command such an army. Germany might have been saved\r\nby another Blenheim; Flanders recovered by another Families; another\r\nPoitiers might have delivered the Royalist and Catholic provinces of\r\nFrance from a yoke which they abhorred, and might have spread terror\r\neven to the barriers of Paris. But the fact is, that, after eight years\r\nof war, after a vast destruction of life, after an expenditure of wealth\r\nfar exceeding the expenditure of the American war, of the Seven Years’\r\nWar, of the war of the Austrian Succession, and of the war of the\r\nSpanish Succession, united, the English army, under Pitt, was the\r\nlaughing-stock of all Europe. It could not boast of one single brilliant\r\nexploit. It had never shown itself on the Continent but to be beaten,\r\nchased, forced to reëmbark, or forced to capitulate. To take some sugar\r\nisland in the West Indies, to scatter some mob of half-naked Irish\r\npeasants, such were the most splendid victories won by the British\r\ntroops under Pitt’s auspices.\r\n\r\nThe English navy no mismanagement could ruin. But during a long period\r\nwhatever mismanagement could do was done. The Earl of Chatham, without\r\na single qualification for high public trust, was made, by fraternal\r\npartiality, First Lord of the Admiralty, and was kept in that great\r\npost during two years of a war in which the very existence of the state\r\ndepended on the efficiency of the fleet. He continued to doze away and\r\ntrifle away the time which ought to have been do-voted to the public\r\nservice, till the whole mercantile body, though generally disposed\r\nto support the government, complained bitterly that our flag gave no\r\nprotection to our trade. Fortunately he was succeeded by George Earl\r\nSpencer, one of those chiefs of the Whig party {277}who, in the great\r\nschism caused by the French Revolution, had followed Burke. Lord\r\nSpencer, though inferior to many of his colleagues as an orator, was\r\ndecidedly the best administrator among them. To him it was owing that a\r\nlong and gloomy succession of days of fasting, and, most emphatically,\r\nof humiliation, was interrupted, twice in the short space of eleven\r\nmonths, by days of thanksgiving for great victories.\r\n\r\nIt may seem paradoxical to say that the incapacity which Pitt showed in\r\nall that related to the conduct of the war is, in some sense, the most\r\ndecisive proof that he was a man of very extraordinary abilities. Yet\r\nthis is the simple truth. For assuredly one-tenth part of his errors\r\nand disasters would have been fatal to the power and influence of any\r\nminister who had not possessed, in the highest degree, the talents of\r\na parliamentary leader. While his schemes were confounded, while his\r\npredictions were falsified, while the coalitions which he had laboured\r\nto form were falling to pieces, while the expeditions which he had sent\r\nforth at enormous cost were ending in rout and disgrace, while the\r\nenemy against whom he was feebly contending was subjugating Flanders and\r\nBrabant, the Electorate of Mentz, and the Electorate of Treves, Holland,\r\nPiedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, his authority over the House of Commons was\r\nconstantly becoming more and more absolute. There was his empire. There\r\nwere his victories, his Lodi and his Areola, his Rivoli and his Marengo.\r\nIf some great misfortune, a pitched battle lost by the allies, the\r\nannexation of a new department to the French Republic, a sanguinary\r\ninsurrection in Ireland, a mutiny in the fleet, a panic in the city, a\r\nrun on the bank, had spread dismay through the ranks of his majority,\r\nthat dismay lasted only till he rose from the Treasury {278}bench, drew\r\nup his haughty head, stretched his arm with commanding gesture,\r\nand poured forth, in deep and sonorous tones, the lofty language of\r\ninextinguishable hope and inflexible resolution. Thus, through a long\r\nand calamitous period, every disaster that happened without the walls of\r\nParliament was regularly followed by a triumph within them. At length he\r\nhad no longer an opposition to encounter. Of the great party which had\r\ncontended against him during the first eight years of his administration\r\nmore than one half now marched under his standard, with his old\r\ncompetitor the Duke of Portland at their head; and the rest had, after\r\nmany vain struggles, quitted the field in despair. Fox had retired to\r\nthe shades of St. Anne’s Hill, and had there found, in the society of\r\nfriends whom no vicissitude could estrange from him, of a woman whom he\r\ntenderly loved, and of the illustrious dead of Athens, of Home, and of\r\nFlorence, ample compensation for all the misfortunes of his public\r\nlife. Session followed session with scarcely a single division. In the\r\neventful year 1799, the largest minority that could be mustered against\r\nthe government was twenty-five.\r\n\r\nIn Pitt’s domestic policy there was at this time assuredly no want of\r\nvigour. While he offered to French Jacobinism a resistance so feeble\r\nthat it only encouraged the evil which he wished to suppress, he put\r\ndown English Jacobinism with a strong hand. The Habeas Corpus Act\r\nwas repeatedly suspended. Public meetings were placed under severe\r\nrestraints. The government obtained from Parliament power to send out\r\nof the country aliens who were suspected of evil designs; and that power\r\nwas not suffered to be idle. Writers who propounded doctrines adverse\r\nto monarchy {279}and aristocracy were proscribed and punished without\r\nmercy. It was hardly safe for a republican to avow his political creed\r\nover his beefsteak and his bottle of port at a chop-house. The old laws\r\nof Scotland against sedition, laws which were considered by Englishmen\r\nas barbarous, and which a succession of governments had suffered to\r\nrust, were now furbished up and sharpened anew. Men of cultivated minds\r\nand polished manners were, for offences which at Westminster would have\r\nbeen treated as mere misdemeanours, sent to herd with felons at Botany\r\nBay. Some reformers, whose opinions were extravagant, and whose language\r\nwas intemperate, but who had never dreamed of subverting the government\r\nby physical force, were indicted for high treason, and were saved from\r\nthe gallows only by the righteous verdicts of juries. This severity was\r\nat the time loudly applauded by alarmists whom fear, had made cruel, but\r\nwill be seen in a very different light by posterity. The truth is, that\r\nthe Englishmen who wished for a revolution were, even in number,\r\nnot formidable, and, in every thing but number, a faction utterly\r\ncontemptible, without arms, or funds, or plans, or organisation, or\r\nleader. There can be no doubt that Pitt, strong as he was in the\r\nsupport of the great body of the nation, might easily have repressed\r\nthe turbulence of the discontented minority by firmly yet temperately\r\nenforcing the ordinary law. Whatever vigour he showed during this\r\nunfortunate part of his life was vigour out of place and season. He was\r\nall feebleness and languor in his conflict with the foreign enemy who\r\nwas really to be dreaded, and reserved all his energy and resolution\r\nfor the domestic enemy who might safely have been despised.\r\n\r\nOne part only of Pitt’s conduct during the last eight years {280}of\r\nthe eighteenth century deserves high praise, he was the first English\r\nminister who formed great designs for the benefit of Ireland. The manner\r\nin which the Roman Catholic population of that unfortunate country had\r\nbeen kept down during many generations seemed to him unjust and cruel;\r\nand it was scarcely possible for a man of his abilities not to perceive\r\nthat, in a contest against the Jacobins, the Roman Catholics were\r\nhis natural allies. Had he been able to do all that he wished, it is\r\nprobable that a wise and liberal policy would have averted the rebellion\r\nof 1708. But the difficulties which he encountered were great, perhaps\r\ninsurmountable; and the Roman Catholics were, rather by his misfortune\r\nthan by his fault, thrown into the hands of the Jacobins. There was a\r\nthird great rising of the Irishry against the Englishry, a rising\r\nnot less formidable than the risings of 1641 and 1689. The Englishry\r\nremained victorious; and it was necessary for Pitt, as it had been\r\nnecessary for Oliver Cromwell and William of Orange before him, to\r\nconsider how the victory should be used. It is only just to his memory\r\nto say that he formed a scheme of policy, so grand and so simple, so\r\nrighteous and so humane, that it would alone entitle him to a high place\r\namong statesmen. He determined to make Ireland one kingdom with England,\r\nand, at the same time, to relieve the Roman Catholic laity from civil\r\ndisabilities, and to grant a public maintenance to the Roman Catholic\r\nclergy. Had he been able to carry these noble designs into effect, the\r\nUnion would have been an Union indeed. It would have been inseparably\r\nassociated in the minds of the great majority of Irishmen with civil and\r\nreligious freedom; and the old Parliament in College Green would have\r\nbeen regretted only {281}by a small knot of discarded jobbers and\r\noppressors, and would have been remembered by the body of the nation\r\nwith the loathing and contempt due to the most tyrannical and the most\r\ncorrupt assembly that had ever sate in Europe. But Pitt could execute\r\nonly one half of what he had projected. He succeeded in obtaining the\r\nconsent of the Parliaments of both kingdoms to the Union; but that\r\nreconciliation of races and sects, without which the Union could exist\r\nonly in name, was not accomplished. He was well aware that he was likely\r\nto find difficulties in the closet. But he flattered himself that, by\r\ncautious and dexterous management, those difficulties might be overcome.\r\nUnhappily, there were traitors and sycophants in high place who did\r\nnot suffer him to take his own time and his own way, but prematurely\r\ndisclosed his scheme to the King, and disclosed it in the manner most\r\nlikely to irritate and alarm a weak and diseased mind. His Majesty\r\nabsurdly imagined that his Coronation oath bound him to refuse\r\nhis assent to any bill for relieving Roman Catholics from civil\r\ndisabilities. To argue with him was impossible. Dundas tried to explain\r\nthe matter, but was told to keep his Scotch metaphysics to himself.\r\nPitt, and Pitt’s ablest colleagues, resigned their offices. It was\r\nnecessary that the King should make a new arrangement. But by this time\r\nhis anger and distress had brought back the malady which had, many\r\nyears before, incapacitated him for the discharge of his functions. He\r\nactually assembled his family, read the Coronation oath to them, and\r\ntold them that, if he broke it, the Crown would immediately pass to the\r\nHouse of Savoy. It was not until after an interregnum of several weeks\r\nthat he regained the full use of his small faculties, and that {282}a\r\nministry after his own heart was at length formed.\r\n\r\nThe materials out of which he had to construct a government were neither\r\nsolid nor splendid. To that party, weak in numbers, but strong in every\r\nkind of talent, which was hostile to the domestic and foreign policy of\r\nhis late advisers, he could not have recourse. For that party, while it\r\ndiffered from his late advisers on every point on which they had been\r\nhonoured with his approbation, cordially agreed with them as to the\r\nsingle matter which had brought on them his displeasure. All that was\r\nleft to him was to call up the rear ranks of the old ministry to form\r\nthe front rank of a new ministry. In an age pre-eminently fruitful of\r\nparliamentary talents, a cabinet was formed containing hardly a single\r\nman who, in parliamentary talents, could be considered as even of the\r\nsecond rate. The most important offices in the state were bestowed on\r\ndecorous and laborious mediocrity. Henry Addington was at the head of\r\nthe Treasury. He had been an early, indeed a hereditary, friend of Pitt,\r\nand had by Pitt’s influence been placed, while still a young man, in the\r\nchair of the House of Commons. He was universally admitted to have been\r\nthe best speaker that had sate in that chair since the retirement of\r\nOnslow. But nature had not bestowed on him very vigorous faculties; and\r\nthe highly respectable situation which he had long occupied with honour\r\nhad rather unfitted than fitted him for the discharge of his new\r\nduties. His business had been to bear himself evenly between contending\r\nfactions. He had taken no part in the war of words; and he had always\r\nbeen addressed with marked deference by the great orators who thundered\r\nagainst each other from his right and from his left. It was {283}not\r\nstrange that, when, for the first time, he had to encounter keen\r\nand vigorous antagonists, who dealt hard blows without the smallest\r\nceremony, he should have been awkward and unready, or, that the air of\r\ndignity and authority which he had acquired in his former post, and of\r\nwhich he had not divested himself, should have made his helplessness\r\nlaughable and pitiable. Nevertheless, during many months, his power\r\nseemed to stand firm. He was a favourite with the King, whom he\r\nresembled in narrowness of mind, and to whom he was more obsequious than\r\nPitt had ever been. The nation was put into high good humour by a peace\r\nwith France. The enthusiasm with which the upper and middle, classes had\r\nrushed into the war spent itself. Jacobinism was no longer formidable.\r\nEverywhere there was a strong reaction against what was called the\r\natheistical and anarchical philosophy of the eighteenth century.\r\nBonaparte, now First Consul, was busied in constructing out of the ruins\r\nof old institutions a new ecclesiastical establishment and a new\r\norder of knighthood. That nothing less than the dominion of the\r\nwhole civilised world would satisfy his selfish ambition was not yet\r\nsuspected; nor did even wise men see any reason to doubt that he might\r\nbe as safe a neighbour as any prince of the House of Bourbon had been.\r\nThe treaty of Amiens was therefore hailed by the great body of the\r\nEnglish people with extravagant joy. The popularity of the minister was\r\nfor the moment immense. His want of parliamentary ability was, as yet,\r\nof little consequence; for he had scarcely any adversary to encounter.\r\nThe old opposition, delighted by the peace, regarded him with favour.\r\nA new opposition had indeed been formed by some of the late ministers,\r\n{284}and was led by Grenville in the House of Lords, and by Windham in\r\nthe House of Commons. But the new opposition could scarcely muster\r\nten votes, and was regarded with no favour by the country. On Pitt the\r\nministers relied as on their firmest support. He had not, like some of\r\nhis colleagues, retired in anger. He had expressed the greatest respect\r\nfor the conscientious scruple which had taken possession of the royal\r\nmind; and he had promised his successors all the help in his power. In\r\nprivate his advice was at their service. In Parliament he took his seat\r\non the bench behind them; and, in more than one debate, defended them\r\nwith powers far superior to their own. The King perfectly understood the\r\nvalue of such assistance. On one occasion, at the palace, he took the\r\nold minister and the new minister aside. “If we three,” he said, “keep\r\ntogether, all will go well.”\r\n\r\nBut it was hardly possible, human nature being what it is, and, more\r\nespecially, Pitt and Addington being what they were, that this union\r\nshould be durable. Pitt, conscious of superior powers, imagined that the\r\nplace which he had quitted was now occupied by a mere puppet which he\r\nhad set up, which he was to govern while he suffered it to remain,\r\nand which he was to fling aside as soon as he wished to resume his old\r\nposition. Nor was it long before he began to pine for the power which\r\nhe had relinquished. He had been so early raised to supreme authority\r\nin the state, and had enjoyed that authority so long, that it had become\r\nnecessary to him. In retirement his days passed heavily. He could not,\r\nlike Fox, forget the pleasures and cares of ambition in the company of\r\nEuripides or Herodotus. Pride restrained him from intimating, even to\r\nhis dearest friends, that he wished to be again minister. {285}But\r\nhe thought it strange, almost ungrateful, that his wish had not been\r\ndivined, that it had not been anticipated, by one whom he regarded as\r\nhis deputy.\r\n\r\nAddington, on the other hand, was by no means inclined to descend from\r\nhis high position. He was, indeed, under a delusion much resembling that\r\nof Abon Hassan in the Arabian tale. His brain was turned by his short\r\nand unreal Caliphate. He took his elevation quite seriously, attributed\r\nit to his own merit, and considered himself as one of the great\r\ntriumvirate of English statesmen, as worthy to make a third with Pitt\r\nand Fox.\r\n\r\nSuch being the feelings of the late minister and of the present\r\nminister, a rupture was inevitable; and there was no want of persons\r\nbent on making that rupture speedy and violent. Some of these persons\r\nwounded Addington’s pride by representing him as a lacquey, sent to keep\r\na place on the Treasury bench till his master should find it convenient\r\nto come. Others took every opportunity of praising him at Pitt’s\r\nexpense. Pitt had waged a long, a bloody, a costly, an unsuccessful\r\nwar. Addington had made peace. Pitt had suspended the constitutional\r\nliberties of Englishmen. Under Addington those liberties were again\r\nenjoyed. Pitt had wasted the public resources. Addington was carefully\r\nnursing them. It was sometimes but too evident that these compliments\r\nwere not unpleasing to Addington. Pitt became cold and reserved. During\r\nmany months he remained at a distance from London. Meanwhile his\r\nmost intimate friends, in spite of his declarations that he made no\r\ncomplaint, and that he had no wish for office, exerted themselves\r\nto effect a change of ministry. His favourite disciple, George\r\n{286}Canning, young, ardent, ambitious, with great powers and great\r\nvirtues, but with a temper too restless and a wit too satirical tor his\r\nown happiness, was indefatigable. He spoke; he wrote; he intrigued; he\r\ntried to induce a large number of the supporters of the government to\r\nsign a round robin desiring a change; he made game of Addington and\r\nof Addington’s relations in a succession of lively pasquinades. The\r\nminister’s partisans retorted with equal acrimony, if not with equal\r\nvivacity. Pitt could keep out of the affray only by keeping out of\r\npolitics altogether; and this it soon became impossible for him to do.\r\nHad Napoleon, content with the first place amoung the sovereigns of the\r\nContinent, and with a military reputation surpassing that of Marlborough\r\nor of Turenne, devoted himself to the noble task of making France happy\r\nby mild administration and wise legislation, our country might have\r\nlong continued to tolerate a government of fair intentions and feeble\r\nabilities. Unhappily, the treaty of Amiens had scarcely been signed,\r\nwhen the restless ambition and the insupportable insolence of the First\r\nConsul convinced the great body of the English people that the peace, so\r\neagerly welcomed, was only a precarious armistice. As it became clearer\r\nand clearer that a war for the dignity, the independence, the very\r\nexistence of the nation was at hand, men looked with increasing\r\nuneasiness on the weak and languid cabinet which would have to contend\r\nagainst an enemy who united more than the power of Lewis the Great to\r\nmore than the genius of Frederick the Great. It is true that Addington\r\nmight easily have been a better war minister than Pitt, and could not\r\npossibly have been a worse. But Pitt had cast a spell on the public\r\nmind. The eloquence, the judgment, {287}the calm and disdainful\r\nfirmness, which he had, during many years, displayed in Parliament,\r\ndeluded the world into the belief that he must be eminently qualified to\r\nsuperintend every department of politics; and they imagined, even after\r\nthe miserable failures of Dunkirk, of Quiberon, and of the Helder, that\r\nhe was the only statesman who could cope with Bonaparte. This feeling\r\nwas nowhere stronger than among Addington’s own colleagues. The pressure\r\nput on him was so strong that he could not help yielding to it; yet,\r\neven in yielding, he showed how far he was from knowing his own place.\r\nHis first proposition was, that some insignificant nobleman should be\r\nFirst Lord of the Treasury and nominal head of the administration, and\r\nthat the real power should be divided between Pitt and himself, who were\r\nto be secretaries of state. Pitt, as might have been expected, refused\r\neven to discuss such a scheme, and talked of it with bitter mirth.\r\n“Which secretaryship was offered to you?” his friend Wilberforce asked.\r\n“Really,” said Pitt, “I had not the curiosity to inquire.” Addington\r\nwas frightened into bidding higher. He offered to resign the Treasury\r\nto Pitt, on condition that there should be no extensive change in the\r\ngovernment. But Pitt would listen to no such terms. Then came a dispute\r\nsuch as often arises after negotiations orally conducted, even when the\r\nnegotiators are men of strict honour. Pitt gave one account of what had\r\npassed; Addington gave another: and, though the discrepancies were not\r\nsuch as necessarily implied any intentional violation of truth on either\r\nside, both were greatly exasperated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the quarrel with the First Consul had come to a crisis. On the\r\n16th of May, 1803, the King {288}sent a message calling on the House of\r\nCommons to support him in withstanding the ambitious and encroaching\r\npolicy of France; and, on the 22nd, the House took the message into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nPitt had now been living many months in retirement. There had been a\r\ngeneral election since he had spoken in Parliament; and there were\r\ntwo hundred members who had never heard him. It was known that on this\r\noccasion he would be in his place; and curiosity was wound up to\r\nthe highest point. Unfortunately, the short-hand writers were, in\r\nconsequence of some mistake, shut out on that day from the gallery,\r\nso that the newspapers contained only a very meagre report of the\r\nproceedings. But several accounts of what passed are extant; and of\r\nthose accounts the most interesting is contained in an unpublished\r\nletter, written by a very young member, John William Ward, afterwards\r\nEarl of Dudley. When Pitt rose, he was received with loud cheering. At\r\nevery pause in his speech there was a burst of applause. The peroration\r\nis said to have been one of the most animated and magnificent ever heard\r\nin Parliament. “Pitt’s speech,” Fox wrote a few days later, “was admired\r\nvery much, and very justly. I think it was the best he ever made in that\r\nstyle.” The debate was adjourned; and on the second night Fox replied\r\nin an oration which, as the most zealous Pittites were forced to\r\nacknowledge, left the palm of eloquence doubtful. Addington made a\r\npitiable appearance between the two great rivals; and it was observed\r\nthat Pitt, while exhorting the Commons to stand resolutely by the\r\nexecutive government against France, said not a word indicating esteem\r\nor friendship for the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nWar {289}was speedily declared. The First Consul threatened to invade\r\nEngland at the head of the conquerors of Belgium and Italy, and formed a\r\ngreat camp near the Straits of Dover. On the other side of those Straits\r\nthe whole population of our island was ready to rise up as one man\r\nin defence of the soil. At this conjuncture, as at some other great\r\nconjunctures in our history, the conjuncture of 1660, for example, and\r\nthe conjuncture of 1688, there was a general disposition among honest\r\nand patriotic men to forget old quarrels, and to regard as a friend\r\nevery person who was ready, in the existing emergency, to do his part\r\ntowards the saving of the state. A coalition of all the first, men in\r\nthe country would, at that moment, have been as popular as the coalition\r\nof 1783 had been unpopular. Alone in the kingdom the King looked with\r\nperfect complacency on a cabinet in which no man superior to himself in\r\ngenius was to be found, and was so far from being willing to admit all\r\nhis ablest subjects to office that he was bent on excluding them all.\r\n\r\nA few months passed before the different parties which agreed\r\nin regarding the government with dislike and contempt came to an\r\nunderstanding with each other. But in the spring of 1804 it became\r\nevident that the weakest of ministries would have to defend itself\r\nagainst the strongest of oppositions, an opposition made up of three\r\noppositions, each of which would, separately, have been formidable from\r\nability, and which, when united, were also formidable from number. The\r\nparty which had opposed the peace, headed by Grenville and Windham,\r\nand the party which had opposed the renewal of the war, headed by Fox,\r\nconcurred in thinking that the men now in power were {290}incapable of\r\neither making a good peace or waging a vigorous war. Pitt had, in 1802,\r\nspoken for peace against the party of Grenville, and had, in 1803,\r\nspoken for war against the party of Fox. But of the capacity of the\r\ncabinet, and especially of its chief, for the conduct of great affairs,\r\nhe thought as meanly as either Fox or Grenville. Questions were easily\r\nfound on which all the enemies of the government could act cordially\r\ntogether. The unfortunate First Lord of the Treasury, who had, during\r\nthe earlier months of his administration, been supported by Pitt on\r\none side, and by Fox on the other, now had to answer Pitt, and to be\r\nanswered by Fox. Two sharp debates, followed by close divisions, made\r\nhim weary of his post. It was known, too, that the Upper House was even\r\nmore hostile to him than the Lower, that the Scotch representative\r\npeers wavered, that there were signs of mutiny among the bishops. In the\r\ncabinet itself there was discord, and, worse than discord, treachery.\r\nIt was necessary to giveway: the ministry was dissolved: and the task of\r\nforming a government was entrusted to Pitt.\r\n\r\nPitt was of opinion that there was now an opportunity, such as had never\r\nbefore offered itself, and such as might never offer itself again, of\r\nuniting in the public service, on honourable terms, all the eminent\r\ntalents of the kingdom. The passions to which the French Revolution had\r\ngiven birth were extinct. The madness of the innovator and the madness\r\nof the alarmist had alike had their day. Jacobinism and Anti-Jacobinism\r\nhad gone out of fashion together. The most liberal statesman did not\r\nthink that season propitious for schemes of parliamentary reform;\r\nand the most conservative statesman could not pretend that there was\r\n{291}any occasion for gagging bills and suspensions of the Habeas Corpus\r\nAct. The great struggle for independence and national honour occupied\r\nall minds; and those who were agreed as to the duty of maintaining that\r\nstruggle with vigour might well postpone to a more convenient time all\r\ndisputes about matters comparatively unimportant. Strongly impressed by\r\nthese considerations, Pitt wished to form a ministry including all the\r\nfirst men in the country. The Treasury he reserved for himself; and to\r\nFox he proposed to assign a share of power little inferior to his own.\r\n\r\nThe plan was excellent; but the king would not hear of it. Dull,\r\nobstinate, unforgiving, and, at that time, half mad, he positively\r\nrefused to admit Fox into his service. Anybody else, even men who had\r\ngone as far as Fox, or further than Fox, in what his Majesty considered\r\nas Jacobinism, Sheridan, Grey, Erskine, should be graciously received;\r\nbut Fox never. During several hours Pitt laboured in vain to reason down\r\nthis senseless antipathy. That he was perfectly sincere there can be\r\nno doubt: but it was not enough to be sincere; he should have been\r\nresolute. Had he declared himself determined not to take office without\r\nFox, the royal obstinacy would have given way, as it gave way, a\r\nfew months later, when opposed to the immutable resolution of Lord\r\nGrenville. In an evil hour Pitt yielded. He flattered himself with the\r\nhope that, though he consented to forego the aid of his illustrious\r\nrival, there would still remain ample materials for the formation of an\r\nefficient ministry. That hope was cruelly disappointed. Fox entreated\r\nhis friends to leave personal considerations out of the question, and\r\ndeclared that he would support, with the utmost cordiality, an efficient\r\nand patriotic ministry from which he {292}should be himself excluded.\r\nNot only his friends, however, but Grenville, and Grenville’s adherents,\r\nanswered, with one voice, that the question was not personal, that a\r\ngreat constitutional principle was at stake, and that they would not\r\ntake office while a man eminently qualified to render service to the\r\ncommonwealth was placed under a ban merely because he was disliked at\r\nCourt. All that was left to Pitt was to construct a government out of\r\nthe wreck of Addington’s feeble administration. The small circle of\r\nhis personal retainers furnished him with a very few useful assistants,\r\nparticularly Dundas, who had been created Viscount Melville, Lord\r\nHarrowby, and Canning.\r\n\r\nSuch was the inauspicious manner in which Pitt entered on his second\r\nadministration. The whole history of that administration was of a piece\r\nwith the commencement. Almost every month brought some new disaster or\r\ndisgrace. To the war with France was soon added a war with Spain. The\r\nopponents of the minister were numerous, able, and active. His most\r\nuseful coadjutors he soon lost. Sickness deprived him of the help of\r\nLord Harrowby. It was discovered that Lord Melville had been guilty of\r\nhighly culpable laxity in transactions relating to public money. He was\r\ncensured by the House of Commons, driven from office, ejected from the\r\nPrivy Council, and impeached of high crimes and misdemeanours. The blow\r\nfell heavy on Pitt. It gave him, he said in Parliament, a deep pang;\r\nand, as he uttered the word pang, his lip quivered, his voice shook, he\r\npaused, and his hearers thought that he was about to burst into tears.\r\nSuch tears shed by Eldon would have moved nothing but laughter. Shed\r\nby the warm-hearted and open-hearted Fox, {293}they would have moved\r\nsympathy, but would have caused no surprise. But a tear from Pitt would\r\nhave been something portentous. He suppressed his emotion, however, and\r\nproceeded with his usual majestic self-possession.\r\n\r\nHis difficulties compelled him to resort to various expedients. At one\r\ntime Addington was persuaded to accept office with a peerage; but he\r\nbrought no additional strength to the government. Though he went through\r\nthe form of reconciliation, it was impossible for him to forget the\r\npast. While he remained in place he was jealous and punctilious; and he\r\nsoon retired again. At another time Pitt renewed his efforts to overcome\r\nhis master’s aversion to Fox; and it was rumoured that the King’s\r\nobstinacy was gradually giving away. But, meanwhile, it was impossible\r\nfor the minister to conceal from the public eye the decay of his health,\r\nand the constant anxiety which gnawed at his heart. His sleep was\r\nbroken. His food ceased to nourish him. All who passed him in the Park,\r\nall who had interviews with him in Downing Street, saw misery written in\r\nhis face. The peculiar look which he wore during the last months of his\r\nlife was often pathetically described by Wilberforce, who used to call\r\nit the Austerlitz look.\r\n\r\nStill the vigour of Pitt’s intellectual faculties, and the intrepid\r\nhaughtiness of his spirit, remained unaltered. He had staked everything\r\non a great venture. He had succeeded in forming another mighty coalition\r\nagainst the French ascendency. The united forces of Austria, Russia\r\nand England might, he hoped, oppose an insurmountable barrier to the\r\nambition of the common enemy. But the genius and energy of Napoleon\r\nprevailed. While the English troops were preparing to {294}embark for\r\nGermany, while the Russian troops were slowly coming up from Poland, he,\r\nwith rapidity unprecedented in modern war, moved a hundred thousand men\r\nfrom the shores of the Ocean to the Black Forest, and compelled a great\r\nAustrian army to surrender at Ulm. To the first faint rumours of this\r\ncalamity Pitt would give no credit. He was irritated by the alarms of\r\nthose around him. “Do not believe a word of it,” he said: “it is all\r\na fiction.” The next day he received a Dutch newspaper containing the\r\ncapitulation. He knew no Dutch. It was Sunday; and the public offices\r\nwere shut. He carried the paper to Lord Malmesbury, who had been\r\nminister in Holland; and Lord Malmesbury translated it. Pitt tried to\r\nbear up; but the shock was too great; and he went away with death in his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe news of the battle of Trafalgar arrived four days later, and seemed\r\nfor a moment to revive him. Forty-eight hours after that most glorious\r\nand most mournful of victories had been announced to the country came\r\nthe Lord Mayor’s day; and Pitt dined at Guildhall. His popularity had\r\ndeclined. But on this occasion the multitude, greatly excited by the\r\nrecent tidings, welcomed him enthusiastically, took off his horses in\r\nCheapside, and drew his carriage up King Street. When his health was\r\ndrunk, he returned thanks in two or three of those stately sentences of\r\nwhich he had a boundless command. Several of those who heard him laid\r\nup his words in their hearts; for they were the last words that he ever\r\nuttered in public: “Let us hope that England, having saved herself by\r\nher energy, may save Europe by her example.”\r\n\r\nThis was but a momentary rally. Austerlitz soon completed what Ulm had\r\nbegun. Early in December Pitt {295}had retired to Bath, in the hope that\r\nhe might there gather strength for the approaching session. While he was\r\nlanguishing there on his sofa arrived the news that a decisive battle\r\nhad been fought and lost in Moravia, that the coalition was dissolved,\r\nthat the Continent was at the feet of France. He sank down under the\r\nblow. Ten days later, he was, so emaciated that his most intimate\r\nfriends hardly knew him. He came up from Bath by slow journeys, and, on\r\nthe 11th of January, 1806, reached his villa at Putney. Parliament was\r\nto meet on the 21st. On the 20th was to be the parliamentary dinner at\r\nthe house of the First Lord of the Treasury in Downing Street; and the\r\ncards were already issued. But the days of the great minister were\r\nnumbered. The only chance for his life, and that a very slight chance,\r\nwas, that he should resign his office, and pass some months in profound\r\nrepose. His colleagues paid him very short visits, and carefully avoided\r\npolitical conversation. But his spirit, long accustomed to dominion,\r\ncould not, even in that extremity, relinquish hopes which everybody but\r\nhimself perceived to be vain. On the day on which he was carried into\r\nhis bedroom at Putney, the Marquess Wellesley, whom he had long loved,\r\nwhom he had sent to govern India, and whose administration had been\r\neminently able, energetic, and successful, arrived in London after an\r\nabsence of eight years. The friends saw each other once more. There was\r\nan affectionate meeting, and a last parting. That it was a last parting\r\nPitt did not seem to be aware. He fancied himself to be recovering,\r\ntalked on various subjects cheerfully, and with an unclouded mind, and\r\npronounced a warm and discerning eulogium on the Marquess’s brother\r\nArthur.\r\n\r\n“I {296}never,” he said, “met with any military man with whom it was so\r\nsatisfactory to converse.” The excitement and exertion of this interview\r\nwere too much for the sick man. He fainted away; and Lord Wellesley left\r\nthe house, convinced that the close was fast approaching.\r\n\r\nAnd now members of Parliament were fast coming up to London. The chiefs\r\nof the opposition met for the purpose of considering the course to be\r\ntaken on the first day of the session. It was easy to guess what would\r\nbe the language of the King’s speech, and of the address which would be\r\nmoved in answer to that speech. An amendment condemning the policy of\r\nthe government had been prepared, and was to have been proposed in the\r\nHouse of Commons by Lord Henry Petty, a young nobleman who had already\r\nwon for himself that place in the esteem of his country which, after the\r\nlapse of more than half a century, he still retains. He was unwilling,\r\nhowever, to come forward as the accuser of one who was incapable of\r\ndefending himself. Lord Grenville, who had been informed of Pitt’s\r\nstate by Lord Wellesley, and had been deeply affected by it, earnestly\r\nrecommended forbearance; and Fox, with characteristic generosity and\r\ngood nature, gave his voice against attacking his now helpless rival.\r\n“Sunt lacryrmæ rerum,” he said, “et men-tem mortalia tangunt.” On the\r\nfirst day, therefore, there was no debate. It was rumoured that evening\r\nthat Pitt was better. But on the following morning his physicians\r\npronounced that there were no hopes. The commanding faculties of which\r\nhe had been too proud were beginning to fail. His old tutor and friend,\r\nthe Bishop of Lincoln, informed him of his danger, and gave such\r\nreligious advice and consolation as a confused {297}and obscured mind\r\ncould receive. Stories were told of devout sentiments fervently uttered\r\nby the dying man. But these stories found no credit with anybody who\r\nknew him. Wilberforce pronounced it impossible that they could be true.\r\n“Pitt,” he added, “was a man who always said less than he thought on\r\nsuch topics.” It was asserted in many after-dinner speeches, Grub Street\r\nelegies, and academic prize poems and prize declamations, that the great\r\nminister died exclaiming, “Oh my country!” This is a fable: but it is\r\ntrue that the last words which he uttered, while he knew what he said,\r\nwere broken exclamations about the alarming state of public affairs.\r\nHe ceased to breathe on the morning of the 23rd of January, 1806, the\r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the day on which he first took his seat in\r\nParliament. He was in his forty-seventh year, and had been, during near\r\nnineteen years, First Lord of the Treasury, and undisputed chief of\r\nthe administration. Since parliamentary government was established in\r\nEngland, no English statesman has held supreme power so long. Walpole,\r\nit is true, was first Lord of the Treasury during more than twenty\r\nyears: but it was not till Walpole had been some time First Lord of the\r\nTreasury that he could be properly called Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nIt was moved in the House of Commons that Pitt should be honoured with a\r\npublic funeral and a monument. The motion was opposed by Fox in a speech\r\nwhich deserves to be studied as a model of good taste and good feeling.\r\nThe task was the most invidious that ever an orator undertook: but\r\nit was performed with a humanity and delicacy which were warmly\r\nacknowledged by the mourning friends of him who was gone. The motion was\r\ncarried by 288 votes to 89.\r\n\r\nThe {298}22nd of February was fixed for the funeral. The corpse, having\r\nlain in state during two days in the Painted Chamber, was borne with\r\ngreat pomp to the northern transept of the Abbey. A splendid train of\r\nprinces, nobles, bishops, and privy councillors followed. The grave of\r\nPitt had been made near to the spot where his great father lay, near\r\nalso to the spot where his great rival was soon to be. The sadness of\r\nthe assistants was beyond that of ordinary mourners. For he whom they\r\nwere committing to the dust had died of sorrows and anxieties of which\r\nnone of the survivors could be altogether without a share. Wilberforce,\r\nwho carried the banner before the hearse, described the awful ceremony\r\nwith deep feeling. As the coffin descended into the earth, he said, the\r\neagle face of Chatham from above seemed to look down with consternation\r\ninto the dark house which was receiving: all that remained of so much\r\npower and glory.\r\n\r\nAll parties in the House of Commons readily concurred in voting forty\r\nthousand pounds to satisfy the demands of Pitt’s creditors. Some of his\r\nadmirers seemed to consider the magnitude of his embarrassments as a\r\ncircumstance highly honourable to him; but men of sense will probably\r\nbe of a different opinion. It is far better, no doubt, that a great\r\nminister should carry his contempt of money to excess than that he\r\nshould contaminate his hands with unlawful gain. But it is neither right\r\nnor becoming in a man to whom the public has given an income more than\r\nsufficient for his comfort and dignity to bequeath to that public a\r\ngreat debt, the effect of mere negligence and profusion. As First Lord\r\nof the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Pitt never had less\r\nthan six thousand a year, besides an excellent house. In 1792 {299}he\r\nwas forced by his royal master’s friendly importunity to accept for life\r\nthe office of Warden of the Cinque Ports, with near four thousand a year\r\nmore. He had neither wife nor child: he had no needy relations: he had\r\nno expensive tastes: he had no long election bills. Had he given but a\r\nquarter of an hour a week to the regulation of his household, he would\r\nhave kept his expenditure within bounds. Or, if he could not spare even\r\na quarter of an hour a week for that purpose, he had numerous friends,\r\nexcellent men of business, who would have been proud to act as his\r\nstewards. One of those friends, the chief of a great commercial house in\r\nthe city, made an attempt to put the establishment in Downing Street to\r\nrights; but in vain. He found that the waste of the servants’ hall was\r\nalmost fabulous. The quantity of butcher’s meat charged in the bills was\r\nnine hundred-weight a week. The consumption of poultry, of fish, and of\r\ntea was in proportion. The character of Pitt would have stood higher\r\nif, with the disinterestedness of Pericles and of De Witt, he had united\r\ntheir dignified frugality.\r\n\r\nThe memory of Pitt has been assailed, times innumerable, often justly,\r\noften unjustly; but it has suffered much less from his assailants than\r\nfrom his eulogists.\r\n\r\nFor, during many years, his name was the rallying cry of a class of\r\nmen with whom, at one of those terrible conjunctures which confound all\r\nordinary distinctions, he was accidentally and temporarily connected,\r\nbut to whom, on almost all great questions of principle, he was\r\ndiametrically opposed. The haters of parliamentary reform called\r\nthemselves Pittites, not choosing to remember that Pitt made three\r\nmotions for parliamentary reform, and, that, though he thought that such\r\na reform {300}could not safely be made while the passions excited by the\r\nFrench revolution were raging, he never uttered a word indicating that\r\nhe should not be prepared at a more convenient season to bring the\r\nquestion forward a fourth time. The toast of protestant ascendency was\r\ndrunk on Pitt’s birthday by a set of Pittites who could not but be aware\r\nthat Pitt had resigned his office because he could not carry Catholic\r\nemancipation. The defenders of the Test Act called themselves Pittites,\r\nthough they could not be ignorant that Pitt had laid before George the\r\nThird unanswerable reasons for abolishing the Test Act. The enemies of\r\nfree trade called themselves Pittites, though Pitt was far more deeply\r\nimbued with the doctrines of Adam Smith than either Fox or Grey. The\r\nvery negro-drivers invoked the name of Pitt, whose eloquence was never\r\nmore conspicuously displayed than when he spoke of the wrongs of the\r\nnegro. This mythical Pitt, who resembles the genuine Pitt as little as\r\nthe Charlemagne of Ariosto resembles the Charlemagne of Effinhard, has\r\nhad his day. History will vindicate the real man from calumny disguised\r\nunder the semblance of adulation, and will exhibit him as what he was,\r\na minister of great talents, honest intentions, and liberal opinions,\r\npre-eminently qualified, intellectually and morally, for the part of a\r\nparliamentary leader, and capable of administering, with prudence and\r\nmoderation, the government of a prosperous and tranquil country, but\r\nunequal to surprising and terrible emergencies, and liable, in such\r\nemergencies, to err grievously, both on the side of weakness and on the\r\nside of violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA P P E N D I X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEST INDIES. (1)\r\n\r\n(_Edinburgh Review_, January 1825.)\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nOf {303}the numerous excellent works in which this important\r\nsubject has lately been discussed, that of Mr. Stephen is the most\r\ncomprehensive, and, in many respects, the most valuable. We are not\r\naware that any opponent has appeared, sufficiently intrepid to deny\r\nhis statements, or to dispute their results. The decent and cautious\r\nadvocates of slavery carefully avoid all allusion to a publication which\r\nthey feel to be unanswerable; and the boldest content themselves with\r\nmisrepresenting and reviling what they cannot even pretend to confute.\r\nIn truth, it is not too much to assert that, on the part of the\r\nslave-drivers and their supporters, this controversy has, for the most\r\npart, been conducted with a disingenuousness and a bitterness to which\r\nliterary history furnishes no parallel. Most of the honourable and\r\nintelligent men whose names give respectability to the Colonial party,\r\nhave, in prudence or in disgust, stood aloof from the contest. In their\r\nabsence, the warfare has been carried on by a race of scribblers, who,\r\nlike the mercenary Mohawks, so often our auxiliaries in Transatlantic\r\ncampaigns, unite the indifference of the hireling to the ferocity of the\r\ncannibal; who take aim from an ambush, and who desire victory only that\r\nthey may have the pleasure of scalping and torturing the vanquished.\r\n\r\n     (1) _The Slavery of the British West India Colonies\r\n     delineated, as it exists both in Law and Practice, and\r\n     compared with the Slavery of other Counties, Ancient and\r\n     Modern_. By James Stephen, Esq. Vol. I, being a Delineation\r\n     of the State in point of Law. London, Butterworth, 1824.\r\n\r\nThe friends of humanity and freedom have often boasted, with {304}honest\r\npride, that the wise and good of hostile sects and factions seemed, when\r\nslavery or the slave-trade were in question, to forget their mutual\r\nantipathies:--that the introduction of this subject was to such men what\r\nthe proclamation of a Crusade was to the warriors of the dark ages--a\r\nsignal to suspend all their petty disputes, and to array themselves\r\nunder the same holy banner, against the same accursed enemy. In this\r\nrespect the slave-drivers are now even with us. They, too, may boast\r\nthat, if our cause has received support from honest men of all religious\r\nand political parties, theirs has tended, in as great a degree, to\r\ncombine and conciliate every form of violence and illiberally. Tories\r\nand Radicals, prebendaries and field-preachers, are to be found in their\r\nranks. The only requisites for one who aspires to enlist, are a front of\r\nbrass and a tongue of venom.\r\n\r\n               “Omnigenumque Defim monstra, et latrator Anubis,\r\n\r\n               Contra Neptunum et Venerem, contraque Minervam\r\n\r\n               Tela tenent.”\r\n\r\nBut it is neither on facts nor on arguments that slavery seems now to\r\ndepend for protection. It neither doubles, nor stands at bay. It has\r\nneither the ingenuity of the hare, nor the intrepidity of the lion. It\r\ndefends itself, like the hunted polecat, by the loathsomeness with which\r\nit taints the atmosphere around it; and hopes to escape, by disgusting\r\nthose whom it can neither weary nor subdue. We could say much on this\r\nsubject. But the sum is, that “the worm will do his kind”--and we have\r\na more important task to perform. It is our intention to analyse, very\r\nconcisely, the valuable work of Mr. Stephen, (1) and afterwards to offer\r\nto our readers some remarks which the perusal of it has suggested.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephen begins, by inquiring into the origin and authority of the\r\nColonial Slave-laws. It has been commonly supposed in England, that\r\nthere exists some known local law in the Colonies, distinct from the law\r\nof England, by which the bondage of the Negro has been introduced and\r\ndefined. There is, however, no such law. The Colonists could, at no\r\ntime, venture to present an act for such a purpose to an\r\n\r\n     (1) Mr. Stephen’s work cannot, of course, embrace any\r\n     changes which may have taken place in West Indian\r\n     Legislation during the last eighteen months or two years.\r\n     Some partial modifications of the former code may have taken\r\n     place during that time in three or four of the colonies, but\r\n     these do not affect the general results.\r\n\r\nEnglish {305}sovereign. The Spanish conquerors and the roving pirates\r\nof the Antilles had established that state: and the English settlers\r\nconsidered themselves as succeeding to the rights of the original\r\ndespoilers of America. Those rights, as they at that time existed, may\r\nbe summed up in one short and terrible maxim,--that the slave is _the\r\nabsolute property_ of the master. It is desirable that this should be\r\nknown; because, although a few restraining statutes have of late years\r\nbeen passed, this odious principle is still the basis of all West Indian\r\nlegislation. It is pre-supposed in all meliorating acts. It is the rule,\r\nand the restraints are exceptions. In the benefits which every other\r\nEnglish subject derives from the common law, the Negro has no share. His\r\nmaster may lawfully treat him as he pleases, except in points regulated\r\nby express enactment.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephen proceeds to analyze the legal nature of the relation between\r\nthe master and the slave. Throughout the West Indies, slavery is a\r\nconstrained service,--a service without wages. In some of the colonies,\r\nindeed, there are acts which regulate the time of labour, and the amount\r\nof the subsistence which shall be given in return. But, from causes\r\nto which we shall hereafter advert, these acts are nugatory. In other\r\nislands, even these ostensible reforms have not taken place: and the\r\nowner may legally give his slaves as much to do, and as little to eat,\r\nas he thinks fit.\r\n\r\nIn all the islands, the master may legally imprison his slave. In all\r\nthe islands he may legally flog him; and in some of the islands he may\r\nlegally flog him at his discretion. The best of the meliorating acts\r\npromise little, and perform less. By some of them it is enacted, that\r\nthe slave shall not be flogged, till recovered from the effects of his\r\nlast flogging--by others, that he shall not receive more than a certain\r\nnumber of lashes in one day. These laws, useless as they are, have a\r\nmeaning. But there are others which add insult to cruelty. In some of\r\nthe Colonial Codes, there are facetious provisions that the slave shall\r\nnot receive more than a certain number of lashes at one time, or for\r\none fault. What is the legal definition of a time? Or who are the legal\r\njudges of a fault? If the master should chuse to say that it is a\r\nfault in his slave to have woolly hair, whom does the law authorize to\r\ncontradict him?\r\n\r\nIt is just to say, that the murder of a slave is now a capital\r\n{306}crime. But the West Indian rules of evidence, to which we shall\r\nhereafter call the attention of onr readers, render the execution of\r\nthe laws on this subject almost impossible. The most atrocious kinds of\r\nmutilation,--even those which in England are punished with death,--when\r\ncommitted upon the person of a slave, subject the offender only to a\r\nfine, or to a short imprisonment. In Dominica, for instance, “to maim,\r\ndeface, mutilate, or cruelly torture” a slave, is a crime which is to\r\nbe expiated by a line not exceeding one hundred pounds currency, or\r\nby imprisonment not exceeding the term of three months, By the law of\r\nJamaica, a master who perpetrates any outrage short of murder on the\r\nperson of a slave, is subject to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds\r\ncurrency, or to imprisonment not exceeding the term of 12 months. In\r\nvery atrocious cases, the court may direct the enfranchisement of the\r\nslave. But this, though a benefit, as far as it goes, to the Negro, is a\r\nvery slight aggravation of the punishment of the master. At most, it is\r\nonly an addition of a few pounds to the fine. And as the possession of a\r\nslave who has been maimed in such a maimer as to render him helpless, is\r\nrather burdensome than profitable, it would, in many eases, be really an\r\nadvantage to the criminal.\r\n\r\nIf these terrible prerogatives were confined to the master alone, the\r\ncondition of the slave would be suficiently wretched. Yet it would not\r\nbe without alleviations. The proprietor might sometimes be restrained by\r\na sense of his pecuniary interest, if not by higher considerations,\r\nfrom those extreme outrages, against which the law affords so scanty a\r\nprotection. At all events, during his absence, his Negroes would enjoy\r\nan interval of security. Unhappily, the Colonial Codes permit all the\r\nrepresentatives and agents of the master, black and white, bond and\r\nfree, to exercise most of his despotic powers.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the slave has no legal property in his own body. It\r\nis almost unnecessary to say, that he has no property in any thing\r\nelse,--that all his acquisitions belong, like himself, to his master. He\r\nis, in fact, a chattel. We should rather say, that to serve the purpose\r\nof rapacity and tyranny, he is alternately considered as real and as\r\npersonal property. He may be sold or bequeathed at the pleasure of his\r\nmaster, he may be put up to auction by process of law, for {307}the\r\nbenefit of the creditors or legatees of his master. In either of\r\nthese ways he may be, in a moment, torn for ever from his home, his\r\nassociates, his own children. He is, in addition to this, legally\r\na subject of mortgages, demises, leases, settlements in tail, in\r\nremainder, and in reversion. The practice of raising money on this\r\nspecies of property, is favoured by the laws of all the Colonies, and\r\nhas been equally fatal to the owner and to the slave. It is fatal to\r\nthe owner, because it enables him to risk capital not his own, in the\r\nprecarious lottery of the West Indian sugar trade. It is fatal to the\r\nslave, because, in the first place, while it leaves to the master all\r\nhis power to oppress, it deprives hi in of his power to manumit; and\r\nsecondly, because it leads the master to keep possession of his Negroes,\r\nand to compel them to labour, when he has no prospect of holding them\r\nlong, and is therefore naturally inclined to make as much by them, and\r\nto spend as little upon them as possible,--a fact amply proved by the\r\nmiserable state in which the gang is generally found, when transferred\r\nfrom the ruined planter to the half ruined mortgagee.\r\n\r\nSuch is the legal condition of the Negro, considered with reference to\r\nhis master. We shall proceed to examine into the nature of the relation\r\nin which he stands towards free persons in general.\r\n\r\nHe is not competent to be a party to any civil action, either as\r\nplaintiff or defendant; nor can he be received as informant or\r\nprosecutor against any person of free condition. He is protected only\r\nas a horse is protected in this country. His owner may bring an action\r\nagainst any person who may have occasioned the loss of his services.\r\nBut it is plain that the slave may sustain many civil injuries, to which\r\nthis circuitous mode of obtaining redress is not applicable; and even\r\nwhen it is applicable, the damages are awarded, not to the injured\r\nparty, but to his master. The protection which indictments and criminal\r\ninformations afford, is also of very narrow extent. Many crimes which,\r\nwhen committed against a white man, are considered as most atrocious,\r\nmay be committed by any white man against a slave with perfect impunity.\r\nTo rob a slave, for instance, is, in most of the islands, not even\r\na misdemeanour. In this case, the grand principle of Colonial law is\r\nsuspended. The property of a slave, it seems, is considered as belonging\r\nto his owner for the purpose {308}of oppression, but not for the purpose\r\nof protection. By the meliorating laws of some of the Colonies, the\r\ncrime of highway robbery upon a Negro, is punished by fines, which, as\r\nfar as we are informed, in no case exceed thirty pounds currency.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. The natural right of self-defence is denied to the\r\nslave. By the laws of almost all the islands, a slave who should defend\r\nhimself from murder or torture, to the injury of a White person, though\r\nsuch White person should posess no authority whatever over him might be\r\npunished with death.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the laws respecting the evidence of slaves,--laws which\r\nthe Colonists stoutly defend,--and with reason; for, while these remain\r\nunaltered, the meliorating acts, feeble at best, must always be utterly\r\ninefficient. The testimony of these unfortunate beings is not admissible\r\nin any cause, civil or criminal, against a White person. To this general\r\nrule there are, in a very few of the smaller Colonies, some partial\r\nexceptions. It is needless to say, that every crime may be easily\r\nperpetrated in a community of which only one member in ten is a\r\ncompetent witness. The Government have pressed this point on the\r\nconsideration of the Colonial Assemblies. In Jamaica, the proposed\r\namendments were recently negatived by a majority of 34 to 1. In\r\nBarbadoes they have met with a similar reception. The only excuse we\r\never heard made for so disgraceful a law, is this, that the Negroes are\r\nignorant of the nature and obligations of an oath, and, in fact, are\r\nscarcely responsible beings. But from this excuse the legislators of\r\nJamaica have excluded themselves, by enacting, that a slave who commits\r\nperjury, in a criminal cause, against another slave, shall suffer the\r\nsame punishment as the prisoner, if convicted, would have suffered. If\r\na slave be ignorant of the nature of an oath, why is he admitted as a\r\nwitness against any human being? Why is he punished, in some cases,\r\nwith death, for an offence which subjects his more enlightened, and\r\ntherefore, more guilty master, only to transportation? If, on the other\r\nhand, he possesses the moral and intellectual qualifications which\r\nare required in a witness, why is he not suffered to appear against an\r\nEuropean?\r\n\r\nBut we must proceed. The slave, thus excluded from the protection of the\r\nlaw, is subject to all its restraints. He undergoes {309}the miseries\r\nof a beast of burden, without enjoying its immunities. He is bound,\r\nnotwithstanding that alleged inferiority of his understanding, which is\r\nadmitted as a reason for curtailing his rights, but not for lightening\r\nhis responsibility, by the whole of the criminal code which is in force\r\nagainst free persons. And, in addition to this, he is subjected to\r\nanother most unjust and cruel code, made for his class alone. If he\r\nflies from the colony, he is put to death. If he goes beyond the limits\r\nof the plantation to which he is attached, without a written permission,\r\nhe is liable to be severely punished. Actions in themselves perfectly\r\ninnocent,--buying or selling certain goods in a market,--raising certain\r\ndescriptions of produce,--possessing certain species of live stock,--are\r\ncrimes for which the Negro is punished, unless he can produce a written\r\nauthority from his owner. In some of the Glands, not even the command of\r\nhis owner is admitted as an excuse. To beat a drum, to blow a horn, to\r\ndance, to play at quoits, to throw squibs, to make fireworks, are\r\nall offences when committed by a slave, and subject him to the cruel\r\nchastisement of the whip. When things merely indifferent are visited\r\nwith such severe penalties, it may easily be imagined that real\r\ndelinquencies are not very mercifully dealt with. In fact, many\r\nactions for which a White man is only imprisoned, or otherwise slightly\r\npunished, if punished at all, are capital crimes when committed by a\r\nslave. Such are stealing, or attempting to steal, to the value of 12d.\r\ncurrency, killing any animal of the value of 6s., uttering mutinous\r\nwords, and a long list of equally heinous crimes. We have already\r\nmentioned the infamous law which exists in Jamaica on the subject of\r\nperjury. Another of a most kingly character is in force in the same\r\nIsand. To compass or imagine the death of any of the White inhabitants,\r\n(God bless their Majesties!) is an enormity for which a slave is\r\npunished with death. It is contrary to the duty of their allegiance!\r\n\r\nSuch is the penal code to which the slaves are subject. The manner in\r\nwhich they are tried is, if possible, still more disgraceful. On charges\r\nwhich do not affect their lives, a single justice is, for the most part,\r\ncompetent to decide. In capital cases, several justices must attend,\r\nand, in most of the Colonies, a Jury is summoned, if that name can\r\nbe applied where there is neither parity of condition nor right of\r\nchallenge. {310}No indictment is preferred No previous investigation\r\ntakes place before a Grand Jury. In most of the Islands no record is\r\ndrawn up. In some, it is enacted, that the execution shall immediately\r\nfollow the sentence. The prisoner is now sufficiently lucky to be\r\nhanged. But formerly it was not unusual to inflict what the Colonial\r\ncodes style “exemplary punishment.”\r\n\r\nWhen it was thought expedient to exercise this right, the offender was\r\nroasted alive, hung up in irons to perish by thirst, or shut up in a\r\ncage and starved to death! These punishments were commonly reserved for\r\nwretches who had committed the diabolical crime of insurrection against\r\nthe just and paternal government, of which we have feebly attempted to\r\ndelineate the excellence.\r\n\r\nThe bondage, of which we have given this description, is hereditary. It\r\nis entailed on the posterity of the slave to the remotest generations.\r\nThe law does not compel his master to enfranchise him, on receiving a\r\nfair price. On the contrary, it interferes to prevent the master, even\r\nwhen so inclined, from giving him his liberty. In some of the islands\r\na direct tax is imposed on manumission; and in all, the encouragement\r\nwhich is given to the practice of raising money on Negroes by mortgage,\r\ntends to obstruct their liberation.\r\n\r\nSlavery in the West Indies is confined to Negroes and people of colour.\r\nThis circumstance is peculiar to the slavery of the New World; and its\r\neffects are most calamitous. The external peculiarities of the African\r\nrace are thus associated in the minds of the Colonists with every thing\r\ndegrading, and are considered as the disgusting livery of the most\r\nabject servitude. Hence it is, that the free Negroes and Mulattoes\r\nhe under so many legal disabilities, and experience such contemptuous\r\ntreatment, that their condition can be esteemed desirable only when\r\ncompared with the bondage to which it lias succeeded. Of the rules to\r\nwhich this class is subjected, we shall notice only one of the most\r\nodious. We speak of the presumption against liberty, which is a\r\nrecognised principle of colonial law. The West Indian maxim is, that\r\nevery Negro and Mulatto is to be considered as a slave, till, by\r\ndocumentary evidence, he can be proved to be otherwise. It may\r\nbe notorious, that he has been free since he first resided in the\r\ncolony,--that he has lived twenty years in England,--that he is a\r\ncitizen of Hayti or Columbia. {311}All this is immaterial. If he cannot\r\nproduce a deed of manumission, he is liable to be put up to sale by\r\npublic auction! On this subject remarks would be superfluous. Thank God,\r\nwe are writing; for a free people.\r\n\r\nWe have now accompanied Mr. Stephen through most of the leading topics\r\nof his work. We have occasionally departed from his arrangement, which\r\nindeed is not always the most convenient. This, however, is to be\r\nattributed, not to the author, but to the circumstances under which\r\nthe work was composed. If there be any thing else to which we should be\r\ninclined to object, it is to the lengthened parallels which Mr. Stephen\r\ndraws between the Slave laws of the West Indies and those which have\r\nexisted in other countries. He is not, we think, too severe upon our\r\nColonists. But we suspect that he is a little too indulgent to the\r\nGreeks and Romans. These passages are, at the same time, in a high\r\ndegree curious and ingenious, though perhaps too long and too frequent.\r\nSuch blemishes, however, if they can be called such, detract but in a\r\nvery slight degree from the value of a book eminently distinguished by\r\nthe copiousness and novelty of the information which it affords, by the\r\nforce of its reasoning, and by the energy and animation of its style.\r\n\r\nWe have not alluded to that part of the work, in which the lamentable\r\nstate of the law, on the subject of religious instruction, is described;\r\nbecause the evil has been universally acknowledged, and something\r\nintended for a remedy has at last been provided. The imagined specific,\r\nas our readers are aware, is an Ecclesiastical Establishment. This\r\nmeasure, we doubt not, is well intended. But we feel convinced that,\r\nunless combined with other reforms, it will prove almost wholly\r\nuseless. The immorality and irreligion of the slaves are the necessary\r\nconsequences of their political and personal degradation. They are not\r\nconsidered by the law as human beings. And they have therefore, in some\r\nmeasure, ceased to be human beings. They must become men before they can\r\nbecome Christians. A great effect may, under fortunate circumstances,\r\nhave been wrought on particular individuals: But those who believe that\r\nany extensive effect can be produced by religious instruction on this\r\nmiserable race, may believe in the famous conversion wrought by St.\r\nAnthony on the fish. Can a preacher prevail on his bearers strictly to\r\nfulfil their conjugal duties in a country where {312}no protection is\r\ngiven to their conjugal rights.--in a country where the husband and\r\nwife may, at the pleasure of the master, or by process of law, be in an\r\ninstant, separated for ever? Can he persuade them to rest on the Sunday,\r\nin Colonies where the law appoints that time for the markets? Is\r\nthere any lesson which a Christian minister is more solemnly bound\r\nto teach,--is there any lesson which it is, in a religious point of\r\nview,--more important for a convert to learn, than that it is a duty\r\nto refuse obedience to the unlawful commands of superiors? Are the\r\nnew pastors of the slaves to inculcate this principle or not? In other\r\nwords, are the slaves to remain uninstruted in the fundamental laws\r\nof Christian morality, or are their teachers to be hanged? This is\r\nthe alternative. We all remember that it was made a charge against Mr.\r\nSmith, that he had read an inflammatory chapter of the Bible to his\r\ncongregation,--excellent encouragement for their future teachers to\r\n“declare unto them,” according to the expression of an old divine, far\r\ntoo methodistical to be considered as an authority in the West Indies,\r\n“the whole counsel of God.”\r\n\r\nThe great body of the Colonists have resolutely opposed religious\r\ninstruction; and they are in the right. They know, though their\r\nmisinformed friends in England do not know, that Christianity and\r\nslavery cannot long exist together. We have already given it us our\r\nopinion, that the great body of the Negroes can never, while their\r\npolitical state remains the same, be expected to become Christians. But,\r\nif that were possible, we are sure that their political state would\r\nvery speedily be changed. At every step which the Negro makes in the\r\nknowledge and discrimination of right and wrong, he will learn to\r\nreprobate more and more the system under which he lives. He will not\r\nindeed be so prone to engage in rash and foolish tumults; but he will be\r\nas willing as he now is to struggle for liberty, and far more capable\r\nof struggling with effect. The forms in which Christianity has been\r\nat different times disguised, have been often hostile to liberty. But\r\nwherever the spirit has surmounted the forms,--in France, during the\r\nwars of the Huguenots,--in Holland, during the reign of Philip II.,--in\r\nScotland, at the time of the Reformation,--in England, through the\r\nwhole contest against the Stuarts, from their accession to their\r\nexpulsion.--in New-England, through its whole history,--in every\r\nplace,--{313}in every age,--it lias inspired a hatred of oppression,\r\nand a love of freedom! It would be thus in the West-Indies. The attempts\r\nwhich have been made to press a few detached texts into the cause of\r\ntyranny, have never produced any extensive effect. Those who cannot\r\nrefute them by reasoning and comparison, will be hurried forward by the\r\nsense of intolerable wrongs, and the madness of wounded affection. All\r\nthis the Colonists have discovered; and we feel assured that they will\r\nnever suffer religious instruction to be unreservedly given to the\r\nslaves. In that case, the Establishment will degenerate into a job.\r\nThis is no chimerical apprehension. There have been clergymen in\r\nthe West-Indies for many years past; and what have they done for the\r\nNegroes? In what have they conduced, either to their temporal or to\r\ntheir spiritual welfare? Doubtless there have been respectable men among\r\nthem. But is it not notorious, that the benefices of the colonies have\r\nbeen repeatedly given to the outcasts of English society,--men whom the\r\ninhabitants would not venture to employ as book-keepers, yet whom they\r\ndesired to retain as boon companions? Any person who will look over the\r\nParliamentary papers which contain the answers returned by the colonial\r\nclergy to certain queries sent out a few years ago by Lord Bathurst,\r\nwill see some curious instances of the ignorance, the idleness, and the\r\nlevity of that body. Why should the new Establishment be less corrupt\r\nthan the old? The dangers to which it is exposed are the same; we do not\r\nsee that its securities are much greater. It has Bishops, no doubt; and\r\nwhen we observe that Bishops are more active than their inferiors on\r\nthis side of the Atlantic, we shall begin to hope that they may be\r\nuseful on the other.\r\n\r\nThese reforms have begun at the wrong end. “God,” says old Hooker, no\r\nenemy to Episcopal Establishments, “first assigned Adam maintenance for\r\nlife, and then appointed him a law to observe.” Our rulers would have\r\ndone well to imitate the example,--to give some security to the hearth\r\nand to the back of the slave, before they sent him Bishops, Archdeacons,\r\nand Chancellors and Chapters.\r\n\r\nThe work of Mr. Stephen has, we think, disposed forever of some of\r\nthe principal arguments which are urged by the Colonists. If those who\r\nconscientiously support slavery be open to conviction, if its dishonest\r\nadvocates be susceptible of {314}shame, they can surely never again\r\nresort to that mode of defence, which they have so often employed when\r\nhard pressed by some particular case of oppression. On such occasions\r\ntheir cry has been, “There are individual instances. You must not\r\ndeduce general conclusions from them. What would you say, if we were\r\nto form our estimate of English society from the Police Reports, or the\r\nNewgate Calendar? Look at the rules, and not at the exceptions.” Here,\r\nthen, we have those boasted rides. And what are they? We find that the\r\nactions which other societies punish as crimes, are in the West Indies\r\nsanctioned by law;--that practices, of which England affords no example\r\nbut in the records of the jail and the gibbet, are there suffered to\r\nexist unpunished;--that atrocities may there be perpetrated in the\r\ndrawing-room or in the market-place, on the persons of untried and\r\nunconvicted individuals, which here would scarcely find an asylum in the\r\nvaults of the Blood-Bowl House.\r\n\r\nIs it any answer to this charge, now most fully established, to say that\r\nwe too have our crimes? Unquestionably, under all systems, however wise,\r\nunder all circumstances, however fortunate, the passions of men will\r\nincite them to evil. The most vigilant police, the most rigid tribunals,\r\nthe severest penalties, are but imperfect restraints upon avarice and\r\nrevenge. What then must be the ease when these restraints are withdrawn?\r\nIn England there is a legal remedy for every injury. If the first prince\r\nof the blood, were to treat the poorest pauper in St. Giles’s as the\r\nbest code in the West Indies authorizes a master to treat his slave, it\r\nwould be better for him that he had never been born. Yet even here we\r\nfind, that wherever power is given, it is occasionally abused; that\r\nmagistrates, not having the fear of the Court of King’s Bench before\r\ntheir eyes, will sometimes be guilty of injustice and tyranny, that even\r\nparents will sometimes starve, torture, murder the helpless beings to\r\nwhom they have given life. And is it not evident, that where there are\r\nfewer checks, there will be more cruelty?\r\n\r\nBut we are told, the manners of a people, the state of public opinion,\r\nare of more real consequence than any written code. Many things, it is\r\nconfessed, in the Colonial laws, are cruel and unjust in theory: but\r\nwe are assured that the feeling of the Colonists renders the practical\r\noperation of the system lenient and liberal. We answer, that publie\r\nfeeling, though {315}an excellent auxiliary to laws, always has been,\r\nand always must be, a miserable and inefficient substitute for them. The\r\nrules of evidence on which public opinion proceeds are defective, and\r\nits decisions are capricious. Its condemnation frequently spares the\r\nguilty, and falls on the innocent. It is terrible to sensitive and\r\ngenerous minds; but it is disregarded by those whose hardened depravity\r\nmost requires restraint. Hence its decrees, however salutary, unless\r\nsupported by the clearer definitions and stronger sanctions of\r\nlegislation, will be daily and hourly infringed; and with principles\r\nwhich rest only on public opinion, frequent infraction amounts to a\r\nrepeal. Nothing that is very common can be very disgraceful. Thus public\r\nopinion, when not strengthened by positive enactment, is first defied,\r\nand then vitiated. At best it is a feeble check to wickedness, and at\r\nlast it becomes its most powerful auxiliary.\r\n\r\nAs a remedy for the evils of a system of slavery, public opinion must be\r\nutterly inefficacious; and that for this simple reason, that the opinion\r\nof the slaves themselves goes for nothing. The desire which we feel to\r\nobtain the approbation, and to avoid the censure of our neighbours,\r\nis no innate or universal sentiment. It always springs, directly or\r\nindirectly, from consideration of the power which others possess to\r\nserve or to injure us. The good will of the lower orders, is courted\r\nonly in countries where they possess political privileges, and where\r\nthere is much they can give, and much that they can take away. Their\r\nopinion is important or unimportant, in proportion as their legal rights\r\nare great or small. It can, therefore, never be a substitute for legal\r\nrights. Does a Smithfield drover care for the love or hatred of his\r\noxen? and yet his oxen, since the passing of Mr. Martin’s meliorating\r\nact, are scarcely in a more unprotected condition than the slaves in our\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nThe opinion then, which is to guard the slaves from the oppressions of\r\nthe privileged order, is the opinion of the privileged order itself. A\r\nvast authority is intrusted to the master--the law imposes scarcely tiny\r\nrestraints upon him--and we are required to believe, that the place of\r\nall other checks will be fully supplied by the general sense of those\r\nwho participate in his power and his temptations. This may be reason at\r\nKingston; but will it pass at Westminster? We are not inveighing against\r\nthe white inhabitants of the West {316}Indies. We do not say that they\r\nare naturally more cruel or more sensual than ourselves. But we say that\r\nthey are men; and they desire to be considered as angels!--we say as\r\nangels, for to no human being, however generous and beneficent, to no\r\nphilanthropist, to no fathers of the church, could powers like theirs be\r\nsafely intrusted. Such authority a parent ought not to have over his\r\nchildren. They ask very complacently, “Are we men of a different species\r\nfrom yourselves? We come among you;--we mingle with you in all your\r\nkinds of business and pleasure;--we buy and sell with you on Change in\r\nthe morning;--we dance with your daughters in the evening. Are not our\r\nmanners civil? Are not our dinners good? Are we not kind friends, fair\r\ndealers, generous benefactors? Are not our names in the subscription\r\nlists of all your charities? And can you believe that we are such\r\nmonsters as the saints represent us to be? Can you imagine that, by\r\nmerely crossing the Atlantic, we acquire a new nature?” We reply, You\r\nare not men of a different species from ourselves; and, therefore, we\r\nwill not give you powers with which we would not dare to trust\r\nourselves. We know that your passions are like ours. We know that your\r\nrestraints are fewer; and, therefore, we know that your crimes must be\r\ngreater. Are despotic sovereigns men of harder hearts by nature than\r\ntheir subjects? Are they born with a hereditary thirst for blood--with a\r\nnatural incapacity for friendship? Surely not. Yet what is their general\r\ncharacter? False--cruel--licentious---ungrateful. Many of them have\r\nperformed single acts of splendid generosity and heroism; a few may be\r\nnamed whose general administration has been salutary; but scarcely one\r\nhas passed through life without committing at least some one atrocious\r\nact, from the guilt and infamy of which restricting laws would have\r\nsaved him and his victims. If Henry VIII. had been a private man, he\r\nmight have torn his wife’s ruff, and kicked her lap-dog. He was a King,\r\nand he cutoff her head--not that his passions were more brutal than\r\nthose of many other men, but that they were less restrained. How many of\r\nthe West Indian overseers can boast of the piety and magnanimity of\r\nTheodosius? Yet, in a single moment of anger, that amiable prince\r\ndestroyed more innocent people than all the ruffians in Europe stab in\r\nfifty years. Thus it is with a master in the Colonies. We will suppose\r\nhim to be {317}a good natured man, but subject, like other men, to\r\noccasional fits of passion. He gives an order. It is slowly or\r\nnegligently executed. In England he would grumble, perhaps swear a\r\nlittle. In the West Indies, the law empowers him to indict a severe\r\nflogging on the loiterer. Are we very uncharitable in supposing that he\r\nwill sometimes exercise his privilege?\r\n\r\nIt by no means follows that a person who is humane in England will be\r\nhumane to his Negroes in the West Indies. Nothing is so capricious and\r\ninconsistent as the compassion of men. The Romans were people of the\r\nsame flesh and blood with ourselves--they loved their friends--they\r\ncried at tragedies--they gave money to beggars;--yet we know their\r\nfondness for gladiatorial shows. When, by order of Pompey, some\r\nelephants were tortured in the amphitheatre, the audience was so shocked\r\nat the yells and contortions by which the poor creatures expressed their\r\nagony, that they burst forth into execrations against their favourite\r\ngeneral. The same people, in the same place, had probably often given\r\nthe fatal twirl of the thumb which condemned some gallant barbarian to\r\nreceive the sword. In our own time, many a man shoots partridges in such\r\nnumbers that he is compelled to bury them, who would chastise his son\r\nfor amusing himself with the equally interesting, and not more cruel\r\ndiversion, of catching flies and tearing them to pieces. The\r\ndrover goads oxen--the fishmonger crimps cod--the dragoon sabres a\r\nFrenchman--the Spanish Inquisition burns a Jew--the Irish gentleman\r\ntorments a Catholic. These persons are not necessarily destitute of\r\nfeeling. Each of them would shrink from any cruel employment, except\r\nthat to which his situation has familiarized him.\r\n\r\nThere is only one way in which the West Indians will ever convince\r\nthe people of England that their practice is merciful, and that is,\r\nby making their laws merciful. We cannot understand why men should so\r\ntenaciously fight for powers which they do not mean to exercise. If the\r\noppressive privileges of the master be nominal and not real, let him\r\ncede them, and silence calumny at once and for ever. Let him cede them\r\nfor his own honour. Let him cede them in compliance with the desire, the\r\nvain and superfluous desire, we will suppose, of the people of England.\r\nIs the repeal of laws which have become obsolete,--is the prohibition\r\n{318}of crimes which are never committed, too great a return for a\r\nbounty of twelve hundred thousand pounds, for a protecting duty most\r\ninjurious to the manufacturers of England and the cultivators of\r\nHindustan, for an army which alone protects from inevitable ruin the\r\nlives and possessions of the Colonists?\r\n\r\nThe fact notoriously is, that West Indian manners give protection even\r\nto those extreme enormities against which the West Indian laws provide.\r\nWe have already adverted to one of the most ordinary sophisms of our\r\nopponents. “Why,” they exclaim, “is our whole body to be censured for\r\nthe depravity of a few? Every society has its miscreants. If we had our\r\nHodge, you had your Thurtell. If we had our Huggins, you had your Wall.\r\nNo candid reasoner will ground general charges on individual eases.” The\r\nrefutation is simple. When a community does nothing to prevent guilt, it\r\nought to bear the blame of it. Wickedness, when punished, is disgraceful\r\nonly to the offender. Unpunished, it is disgraceful to the whole\r\nsociety. Our charge against the Colonists is not that crimes are\r\nperpetrated among them, but that they are tolerated. We will give a\r\nsingle instance. Since the West Indians are fond of referring to\r\nour Newgate Calendar, we will place, side by side, a leaf from that\r\nmelancholy Register, and another from the West Indian Annals.\r\n\r\nMr. Wall was Governor at Goree. In that situation he flogged a man to\r\ndeath, on pretence of mutiny. On his return to England, he was indicted\r\nfor murder. He escaped to the Continent. For twenty years he remained\r\nin exile. For twenty years the English people retained the impression\r\nof his crime uneffaced within their hearts. He shifted his residence--he\r\ndisguised his person--he changed his name,--still their eyes were upon\r\nhim, for evil, and not for good. At length, conceiving that all danger\r\nwas at an end, he returned. He was tried, convicted, and hanged, amidst\r\nthe huzzas of an innumerable multitude. (1)\r\n\r\nEdward Huggins of Nevis, about fifteen years ago, flogged upwards of\r\ntwenty slaves in the public market-place, with such severity as to\r\nproduce the death of one, and to ruin the\r\n\r\n     (1) We should be far, indeed, from applauding those shouts,\r\n     if they were the exultation of cruelty; but they arose from\r\n     the apprehension that Court favour was about to save the\r\n     criminal; and the feeling expressed was for the triumph of\r\n     justice.\r\n\r\nconstitutions {319}of many. He had grossly violated the law of the\r\nColony, which prescribes a limit to such inflictions. He had violated it\r\nin open day, and in the presence of a magistrate. He was indicted by\r\nthe law officer of the crown. His advocate acknowledged the facts, but\r\nargued that the act on which he was tried, was passed only to silence\r\nthe zealots in England, and was never intended to be enforced. Huggins\r\nwas acquitted! But that was a trifle. Some members of the House of\r\nAssembly lost their seats at the next election, for taking part against\r\nhim. A printer of a neighbouring island was convicted of a libel, merely\r\nfor publishing an official report of the evidence, transmitted to him by\r\nauthority. In a word, he was considered as a martyr to the common cause,\r\nand grew in influence and popularity; while a most respectable planter,\r\nan enlightened and accomplished gentleman, Mr. Tobin, who, nobly\r\ndespising the prejudices of his class, had called the attention of the\r\ngovernment to these diabolical outrages, was menaced with prosecutions,\r\nassailed with slanders, and preserved only by blindness from challenges.\r\n\r\nLet these cases be compared. We do not say that Wall was not as bad a\r\nman as Huggins; but we do say that the English people have nothing to do\r\nwith the crime of Wall, and that the public character of the people of\r\nNevis suffers seriously by the crime of Huggins. They have adopted the\r\nguilt, and they must share in the infamy. We know that the advocates\r\nof slavery affect to deride this and similar narratives as old and\r\nthreadbare. They sneer at them in conversation, and cough them down in\r\nthe House of Commons. But it is in vain. They are written on the hearts\r\nof the people; and they will be remembered when all the smooth nothings\r\nof all the official defenders of such transactions are forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe truth is simply this. Bad laws and bad customs, reciprocally\r\nproducing and produced by each other, have given to the Whites in\r\nall the slave islands--Dutch, Spanish, French and English--a peculiar\r\ncharacter, in which almost all the traits, which, in this quarter of the\r\nworld, distinguish the different nations, are lost. We think we describe\r\nthat character sufficiently when we call it the despotic character.\r\nIn nothing does this temper more strongly appear than in the rage and\r\ncontempt with which the Colonists receive{320} every command, and indeed\r\nevery admonition, from the authorities of the mother country. When the\r\nterritorial power and the commercial monopoly of the East India Company\r\nhaws been at stake, has that great body conducted itself thus? Do even\r\nforeign powers treat us in this manner? We have often remonstrated with\r\nthe greatest sovereigns of the Continent on the subject of the slave\r\ntrade. We have been repulsed--we have been deluded. But by whom have\r\nwe been insulted? The representations of the King and people of England\r\nhave never been met with outrageous scorn and anger,--except by the men\r\nwho owe their food to our bounties, and their lives to our troops.\r\nTo the most gentle and moderate advice, to the suggestions of the most\r\nrespectable of the West Indian proprietors resident in England, they\r\nreply only in ravings of absurd slander, or impotent defiance. The\r\nessays in their newspapers, the speeches of their legislators, the\r\nresolutions of their vestries, are, almost without exception,\r\nmere collections of rancorous abuse, unmixed with argument. If the\r\nAntislavery Society would publish a small tract, containing simply the\r\nleading articles of five or six numbers of the Jamaica Gazette, without\r\nnote or comment, they would, we believe, do more to illustrate the\r\ncharacter of their adversaries than by any other means which can be\r\ndevised. Such a collection would exhibit to the country the real nature\r\nof that malignant spirit which banished Salisbury, which destroyed\r\nSmith, and which broke the honest heart of Ramsay.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that most of these zealots of slavery have little or\r\nno pecuniary interest in the question. If the colonies should be ruined,\r\nthe loss will fall, not upon the book-keepers, the overseers, the herd\r\nof needy emigrants who make up the noisy circles of Jamaica; but upon\r\nthe Ellises, the Hibberts, the Mannings, men of the most respectable\r\ncharacters and enlightened minds in the country. _They_ might have\r\nbeen excused, if any person could be excused, for employing violent\r\nand abusive language. Yet they have conducted themselves, not perhaps\r\nexactly as we might wish them, but still like gentlemen, like men of\r\nsense, like men of feeling. Why is this? Simply because they live in\r\nEngland, and participate in English feelings. The Colonists, on the\r\nother hand, are degraded by familiarity with oppression. Let us not be\r\ndeceived. The cry which resounds from the West {321}Indies is raised by\r\nmen, who are trembling less for their property than for the privileges\r\nof their caste. These are the persons who love slavery for its own sake.\r\nThe declarations so often made by the Parliament, by the Ministers, by\r\nthe deadliest enemies of slavery, that the interests of all parties will\r\nbe fairly considered, and that wherever a just claim to compensation can\r\nbe established, compensation will be given, bring no comfort to\r\nthem. They may have no possessions, but they have white faces. Should\r\ncompensation be given, few of them will receive a sixpence; but they\r\nwill lose the power of oppressing with impunity every man who has a\r\nblack skin. And it is to these men, who have scarcely any interest\r\nin the value of colonial property, but who have a deep interest,--the\r\ninterest of a petty tyranny, and a despicable pride in the maintenance\r\nof colonial injustice, that the British Parliament is required to give\r\nup its unquestionable right of superintendence over every part of our\r\nempire. If this were requested as a matter of indulgence, or recommended\r\nas a matter of expediency, we might well be surprised. But it is\r\ndemanded as a constitutional right. On what does this right rest? On\r\nwhat statute? On what charter? On what precedent? On what analogy? That\r\nthe uniform practice of past ages has been against their claim, they\r\nthemselves do not venture to deny. Do they mean to assert, that a\r\nparliament in which they are not represented ought not to legislate for\r\nthem? That question we leave them to settle with their friends of\r\nthe Quarterly Review and the John Bull newspaper, who, we hope, will\r\nenlighten them on the subject of virtual representation. If ever that\r\nexpression could be justly used, it would be in the present case; for\r\nprobably there is no interest more fully represented in both Houses of\r\nParliament, than that of the colonial proprietors. But for ourselves we\r\nanswer, What have you to do with such doctrines? If you will adopt the\r\nprinciples of liberty, adopt them altogether. Every argument which you\r\ncan urge in support of your own claims, might be employed, with far\r\ngreater justice, in favour of the emancipation of your bondsmen.\r\nWhen that event shall have taken place, your demand will deserve\r\nconsideration. At present, what you require under the name of freedom is\r\nnothing but unlimited power to oppress. It is the freedom of Nero.\r\n\r\n“But {322}we will rebel!” Who can refrain from thinking of Captain\r\nLemuel Gulliver, who, while raised sixty feet from the ground on the\r\nhand of the King of Brohdignag, claps his hand on his sword and tells\r\nhis Majesty that he knows how to defend himself? You will rebel! Bravely\r\nresolved, most magnanimous Grildrig! But remember the wise remark of\r\nLord Beelington--“courage without power,” said that illustrious\r\nexile, “is like a consumptive running footman.” What are your means of\r\nresistance? Are there, in all the islands put together, ten thousand\r\nwhite men capable of hearing arms? Are not your forces, such as they\r\nare, divided into small portions which can never act in concert? But\r\nthis is mere trifling. Are you, in point of fact, at this moment able\r\nto protect yourselves against your slaves without our assistance? If\r\nyou can still rise up and be down in security--if you can still eat the\r\nbread of the fatherless, and grind the faces of the poor--if you can\r\nstill hold your petty parliaments, and say your little speeches, and\r\nmove, your little motions--if you can still outrage and insult the\r\nParliament and people of England, to what do you owe it? To nothing but\r\nto our contemptuous mercy. If we suspend our protection--if we recall\r\nour troops--in a week the knife is at your throats!\r\n\r\nLook to it, that we do not take you at your word. What are you to us\r\nthat we should pamper and defend you? If the Atlantic Ocean should pass\r\nover you, and your place know you no more, what should we lose? Could\r\nwe find no other cultivators to accept of our enormous bounties on\r\nsugar?--no other pestilential region to which we might send our soldiers\r\nto catch the yellow fever?--no other community for which we might pour\r\nforth our blood and lavish our money, to purchase nothing but injuries\r\nand insults? What do we make by you? If England is no longer to be the\r\n_mistress_ of her colonies,--if she is to be only the handmaid of their\r\npleasures, or the accomplice of their crimes, she may at least venture\r\nto ask, as a handmaid, what are to be the wages of her service,--as\r\nan accomplice, what is to be her portion of the spoil? If justice, and\r\nmercy, and liberty, and the law of God, and the happiness of man, be\r\nwords without a meaning, we at least talk to the purpose when we talk of\r\npounds, shillings, and pence.\r\n\r\nLet us count our gains. Let us bring to the test the lofty phrases\r\n{323}of Colonial declamation. The West Indies, we are told, are a source\r\nof vast wealth and revenue to the country. They are a nursery of\r\nseamen. They take great quantities of our manufactures. They add to\r\nour political importance. They are useful posts in time of war. These\r\nabsurdities have been repeated, till they have begun to impose upon the\r\nimpostors who invented them. Let us examine them briefly.\r\n\r\nOur commercial connexion with the West Indies is simply this. We buy our\r\nsugar from them at a higher price than is given for it in any other part\r\nof the world. The surplus they export to the Continent, where the price\r\nis lower; and we pay them the difference out of our own pockets. Our\r\ntrade with the West Indies is saddled with almost all the expense\r\nof their civil and military establishments, and with a bounty of\r\n1,200,000l. Let these be deducted from the profits of which we hear so\r\nmuch, and their amount will shrink indeed. Let us then deduct from the\r\nresidue the advantages which we relinquish in order to obtain it,--that\r\nis to say, the profits of a free sugar trade all over the world; and\r\nthen we shall be able to estimate the boasted gains of a connexion to\r\nwhich we have sacrificed the Negroes in one hemisphere, and the Hindoos\r\nin the other.\r\n\r\nBut the West Indians take great quantities of our manufactures! They\r\ncan take only a return for the commodities which they send us. And from\r\nwhatever country we may import the same commodities, to that country\r\nmust we send out the same returns. What is it that now limits the\r\ndemands of our Eastern empire? Absolutely nothing but the want of\r\nan adequate return. From that immense market--from the custom of one\r\nhundred millions of consumers, our manufacturers are in a great measure\r\nexcluded, by the protecting duties on East Indian sugar.\r\n\r\nBut a great revenue is derived from the West Indian trade! Here, again,\r\nwe have the same fallacy. As long as the present quantity of sugar is\r\nimported into England, no matter from what country, the revenue will\r\nnot suffer; and, in proportion as the price of sugar is diminished, the\r\nconsumption, and, consequently, the revenue, must increase. But the\r\nWest Indian trade affords extensive employment to British shipping and\r\nseamen! Why more than any equally extensive trade with any other part of\r\nthe world? The more {324}active our trade, the more demand there will\r\nbe for shipping and seamen; and every one who has learnt the alphabet of\r\nPolitical Economy, knows that trade is active, in proportion only as it\r\nis free.\r\n\r\nThere are some who assert that, in a military and political point of\r\nview, the West Indies are of great importance to this country. This is\r\na common, but a monstrous misrepresentation. We venture to say, that\r\nColonial empire has been one of the greatest curses of modern Europe.\r\nWhat nation has it ever strengthened? What nation has it ever enriched?\r\nWhat have been its fruits? Wars of frequent occurrence and immense cost,\r\nfettered trade, lavish expenditure, clashing jurisdiction, corruption in\r\ngovernments, and indigence among the people. What have Mexico and Peru\r\ndone for Spain, the Brazils for Portugal, Batavia for Holland? Or, if the\r\nexperience of others is lost upon us, shall we not profit by our own?\r\nWhat have we not sacrificed to our infatuated passion for transatlantic\r\ndominion? This it is that has so often led us to ri.-k our own smiling\r\ngardens and dear firesides for some snowy desert or infections morass\r\non the other side of the globe: This inspired us with the project\r\nof conquering America in Germany: This induced us to resign all the\r\nadvantages of our insular situation--to embroil ourselves in the\r\nintrigues, and fight the battles of half the Continent--to form\r\ncoalitions which were instantly broken---and to give subsidies which\r\nwere never earned: This gave birth to the fratricidal war against\r\nAmerican liberty, with all its disgraceful defeats, and all its barren\r\nvictories, and all the massacres of the Indian hatchet, and all the\r\nbloody contracts of the Hessian slaughterhouse: This it was which, in\r\nthe war against the French republic, induced us to send thousands and\r\ntens of thousands of our bravest troops to die in West Indian hospitals,\r\nwhile the armies of our enemies were pouring over the Rhine and the\r\nAlps. When a colonial acquisition has been in prospect, we have thought\r\nno expenditure extravagant, no interference perilous. Gold has been to\r\nus as dust, and blood as water. Shall we never learn wisdom? Shall we\r\nnever cease to prosecute a pursuit wilder than the wildest dream of\r\nalchemy, with all the credulity and all the profusion of Sir Epicure\r\nMammon?\r\n\r\nThose who maintain that settlements so remote conduce to the military or\r\nmaritime power of nations, fly in the face of history. {325}The colonies\r\nof Spain were far more extensive and populous than ours. Has Spain, at\r\nany time within the last two centuries, been a match for England either\r\nby land or by sea? Fifty years ago, our colonial dominions in America\r\nwere far larger and more prosperous than those which we at present\r\npossess. Have we since that time experienced any decay in our political\r\ninfluence, in our opulence, or in our security? Or shall we say that\r\nVirginia was a less valuable possession than Jamaica, or Massachusetts\r\nthan Barbadoes?\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that all the evils of our Colonial system are immensely\r\naggravated in the West Indies by the peculiar character of the state of\r\nslavery which exists there. Our other settlements we have to defend only\r\nagainst foreign invasion. These we must protect against the constant\r\nenmity of the miserable bondsmen, who are always waiting for the moment\r\nof deliverance, if not of revenge. With our other establishments we may\r\nestablish commercial relations advantageous to both parties. But these\r\nare in a state of absolute pauperism; for what are bounties and forced\r\nprices but an enormous poor-rate in disguise?\r\n\r\nThese are the benefits for which we are to be thankful. These are the\r\nbenefits, in return for which we are to suffer a handful of managers\r\nand attorneys to insult the King, Lords, and Commons of England, in the\r\nexercise of rights as old and sacred as any part of our Constitution. It\r\nthe proudest potentate in Europe, if the King of France, or the Emperor\r\nof all the Russias, had treated our Government as these creatures of\r\nour own have dared to do, should we not have taken such satisfaction as\r\nwould have made the ears of all that heard of it to tingle? Would there\r\nnot have been a stately manifesto, and a warlike message to both\r\nHouses, and vehement speeches from all parties, and unanimous addresses\r\nabounding in offers of lives and fortunes? If any _English mob_,\r\ncomposed of the disciples of Paine and Carlile, should dare to pull down\r\na place of religious worship, to drive the minister from his residence,\r\nto threaten with destruction any other who should dare to take his\r\nplace, would not the yeomanry be called out? Would not Parliament be\r\nsummoned before the appointed time? Would there not be sealed bags\r\nand secret committees, and suspensions of the Habeas Corpus act? In\r\nBarbadoes all this has been done.\r\n\r\nIt {326}has been done openly. It has _not_ been punished. It is at this\r\nhour a theme of boasting and merriment. And what is the language of our\r\nrulers? “We must not irritate them. We must try lenient measures. It is\r\nbetter that such unfortunate occurrences should not be brought before\r\nthe Parliament.” Surely the mantle, or rather the cassock, of Sir Hugh\r\nEvans, has descended on these gentlemen. “It is not meet the council\r\nhear a riot. There is no fear of Got in a riot. The council, look you,\r\nshall desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a riot.” We have\r\noutdone all the most memorable examples of patience. The Job of Holy\r\nWrit, the Griselda of profane romance, were but types of our philosophy.\r\nSurely our endurance must be drawing to a close.\r\n\r\nWe do not wish that England should drive forth her prodigal offspring\r\nto wear the rags and feed on the husks which they have desired. The\r\nColonists have deserved such a punishment. But, for the sake of the\r\nslaves, for the sake of those persons, residing in this country, who are\r\ninterested in West Indian property, we should grieve to see it indicted.\r\nThat the slaves, when no longer restrained by our troops, would, in\r\nno very long time, achieve their own liberation, cannot be doubted. As\r\nlittle do we doubt that such a revolution, violent as it would doubtless\r\nbe, would be desirable, if it were the only possible means of subverting\r\nthe present system. The horrors of a battle or a massacre force\r\nthemselves upon our senses. The effects of protracted tyranny,\r\nthe terror, the degradation, the blighted affections, the stunted\r\nintellects, the pining of the heart, the premature decay of the frame,\r\nare evils less obvious, but equally certain; and, when continued through\r\nsuccessive generations, make up a greater sum of human misery than was\r\never indicted in the paroxysm of any revolution. Still we cannot\r\ndoubt that savages, rude in understanding, exasperated by injuries,\r\nintoxicated by recent freedom, would be much benefited by the wise and\r\nmerciful control of an enlightened people.\r\n\r\nWe feel also for the West Indian proprietors who reside in England.\r\nBetween them and the inhabitants of the Colonies we see a great\r\ndistinction. There may be in this body individuals infected with the\r\nworst vices of the colonial character. But there are also among them\r\nmany gentlemen of benevolent feelings and enlarged minds, who have done\r\nmuch to {327}alleviate the condition of their slaves, and who would\r\nwillingly see the meliorating measures which his Majesty’s ministers\r\nhave suggested, adopted by the West Indian legislators. They have\r\nscarcely any thing in common with the Colonists, or with the scribblers\r\nwhom the Colonists feed and clothe. They have taken little part in the\r\ncontroversy, ashamed probably of the infamous allies with whom they\r\nwould have to cooperate. But what they have said has, upon the whole,\r\nbeen said manfully and courteously. Their influence, however, is at\r\npresent exerted decidedly in favour of slavery, not, we verily believe,\r\nfrom any love of slavery in the abstract, but partly because they think\r\nthat their own characters are in some degree affected by the attacks\r\nwhich are made on the Colonial system, and partly because they apprehend\r\nthat their property is likely to suffer in consequence of the feeling\r\nwhich at present prevails throughout the country.\r\n\r\nOn both points they are mistaken. We are convinced that there is not, in\r\nany quarter, a feeling unfriendly to them, or an indisposition to give a\r\nfair consideration to their interests. The honest, but uninformed zeal,\r\nof individuals, may sometimes break forth into intemperate expressions:\r\nBut the great body of the people make a wide distinction between the\r\nclass of which we speak and the Colonial mob. Let it be their care to\r\npreserve that distinction indelible.\r\n\r\nWe call for their support. They are our natural allies. Scarcely have\r\nthe Ministers of the Crown, scarcely have the Abolitionists themselves,\r\nbeen more rancorously abused by the orators of Jamaica, than those\r\npersons. The objects of the two classes are wholly different. The one\r\nconsists of English gentlemen, naturally solicitous to preserve the\r\nsource from which they derive a part of their revenue. The other is\r\ncomposed, in a great measure, of hungry adventurers, who are too poor\r\nto buy the pleasure of tyranny, and are therefore attached to the only\r\nsystem under which they can enjoy it gratis. The former wish only to\r\nsecure their possessions; the latter are desirous to perpetuate the\r\noppressive privileges of the white skin. Against those privileges let us\r\ndeclare interminable war, war for ourselves, and for our children,\r\nand for our grand-children,--war without peace--war without truce--war\r\nwithout quarter! But we respect the rights of property as much as we\r\ndetest the prerogatives of colour.\r\n\r\nWe {328}entreat these respectable persons to reflect on the precarious\r\nnature of the tenure by which they hold their property. Even if it were\r\nin their power to put a stop to this controversy,--if the subject of\r\nslavery were no longer to occupy the attention of the British public,\r\ncould they think themselves secure from ruin? Are no ominous signs\r\nvisible in the political horizon? How is it that they do not discern\r\nthis time? All the ancient fabrics of colonial empire are falling\r\nto pieces. The old equilibrium of power has been disturbed by the\r\nintroduction of a crowd of new States into the system. Our West-India\r\npo-sessions are not now surrounded, as they formerly were, by the\r\noppressed and impoverished colonies of a superannuated monarchy, in\r\nthe last stage of dotage and debility, but by young, and vigorous, and\r\nwarlike republics. We have defended our colonies against Spain. Does it\r\ntherefore follow that we shall be able to defend them against Mexico or\r\nHayti? We are told, that a pamphlet of Mr. Stephen, or a speech of Mr.\r\nBrougham, is sufficient to excite all the slaves in our colonies to\r\nrebel. What, then, would be the effect produced in Jamaica by the\r\nappearance of three or four Black regiments, with thirty or forty\r\nthousand stand of arms? The colony would be lost. Would it ever be\r\nrecovered? Would England engage in a contest for that object, at so vast\r\na distance, and in so deadly a climate? Would she not take warning by\r\nthe fate of that mighty expedition which perished in St. Domingo? Let\r\nus suppose, however, that a force were sent, and that, in the field, it\r\nwere successful. Have we forgotten how long a few Maroons defended the\r\ncentral mountains of the island against all the efforts of disciplined\r\nvalour? A similar contest on a larger scale might be protracted for half\r\na century, keeping our forces in continual employment, and depriving\r\nproperty of all its security. The country might spend fifty millions\r\nof pounds, and bury fifty thousand men, before the contest could be\r\nterminated. Nor is this all. In a servile war, the master _must_ be the\r\nloser--for his enemies are his chattels. Whether the slave conquer or\r\nfall, he is alike lost to the owner. In the mean time, the soil lies\r\nuncultivated; the machinery is destroyed. And when the possessions of\r\nthe planter are restored to him, they have been changed into a desert.\r\n\r\nOur policy is clear. If we wish to keep the Colonies, we must take\r\nprompt and effectual measures for raising the condition {329}of the\r\nslaves. We must give them institutions which they may have no temptation\r\nto change. We have governed the Canadians liberally and leniently;\r\nand the consequence is, that we can trust to them to defend themselves\r\nagainst the most formidable power that anywhere threatens our Colonial\r\ndominions. This is the only safeguard. You may renew all the atrocities\r\nof Barbadoes and Demerara. You may inflict all the most hateful\r\npunishments authorised by the insular codes. You may massacre by the\r\nthousand, and hang by the score. You may even once more roast your\r\ncaptives in slow fires, and starve them in iron cages, or flay them\r\nalive with the cart-whip. You will only hasten the day of retribution.\r\nTherefore, we say, “Let them go forth from the house of bondage. For woe\r\nunto you, if you wait for the plagues and the signs, the wonders and the\r\nwar, the mighty hand and the outstretched arm!”\r\n\r\nIf the great West Indian proprietors shall persist in a different line\r\nof conduct, and ally themselves with the petty tyrants of the Antilles,\r\nit matters little. We should gladly accept of their assistance: But we\r\nfeel assured that their opposition cannot affect the ultimate result of\r\nthe controversy. It is not to any particular party in the church or in\r\nthe state; it is not to the right or to the left hand of the speaker; it\r\nis not to the cathedral or to the Meeting, that we look exclusively for\r\nsupport. We believe that, on this subject, the hearts of the English\r\nPeople burn within them. They hate slavery. They have hated it for\r\nages. If has, indeed, hidden itself for a time in a remote nook of\r\ntheir dominions: but it is now discovered and dragged to light. That is\r\nsufficient. Its sentence is pronounced; and it never can escape! never,\r\nthough all the efforts of its supporters should be redoubled,--never,\r\nthough sophistry, and falsehood, and slander, and the jests of the\r\npothouse, the ribaldry of the brothel, and the slang of the ring or\r\nlives’ court, should do their utmost in its defence,--never, though\r\nfresh insurrections should be got up to frighten the people out of their\r\njudgment, and fresh companies to bubble them out of their money,--never,\r\nthough it should find in the highest ranks of the peerage, or on the\r\nsteps of the throne itself, the purveyors of its slander, and the\r\nmercenaries of its defence! (1)\r\n\r\n     (1) Since the above article was prepared for the press, we\r\n     have met with a new and very important work on the subject\r\n     of West-India Slavery. It is entitled, “The {330}West Indies\r\n     as they are, or a real Picture of Slavery, particularly in\r\n     Jamaica,” by the Rev. H. Bickell, a clergyman of the Church\r\n     of England, who resided a considerable time in that island.\r\n     The work is ill written; and it might have been reduced with\r\n     advantage to half its present size. It produces, however, an\r\n     irresistible impression of the honesty and right intentions\r\n     of the author, who was an eyewitness of the scenes he\r\n     describes: and it continues, in a remarkable manner, all the\r\n     leading statements which, on the authority of Mr. Cooper,\r\n     Dr. Williamson, and Mr. Meabing, were laid before the public\r\n     two years ago, in the pamphlet called “Negro Slavery.” Mr.\r\n     Bickell has also brought forward various new facts of the\r\n     most damning description, in illustration both of the\r\n     rigours of Negro bondage, and of the extraordinary\r\n     dissoluteness of manners prevailing in Jamaica. We strongly\r\n     recommend the work to general perusal, as a most seasonable\r\n     antidote to those delusive tales of colonial amelioration,\r\n     by which it has been attempted to abate the horror so\r\n     universally felt in contemplating the cruel and debasing\r\n     effects of the slave system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONDON UNIVERSITY. (1)\r\n\r\n(Edinburgh, Review, February 1826.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFew {331}things have ever appeared to us more inexplicable than the\r\ncry which it has pleased those who arrogate to themselves the exclusive\r\npraise of loyalty and orthodoxy, to raise against the projected\r\nUniversity of London. In most of those publications which are\r\ndistinguished by zeal for the Church and the Government, the scheme\r\nis never mentioned but with affected contempt, or unaffected fury. The\r\nAcademic pulpits have resounded with invectives against it; and many\r\neven of the most liberal and enlightened members of the old foundations\r\nseem to contemplate it with very uncomfortable feelings.\r\n\r\nWe were startled at this. For surely no undertaking of equal importance\r\nwas ever commenced in a manner more pacific and conciliatory. If the\r\nmanagement has fallen, in a great measure, into the hands of persons\r\nwhose political opinions are at variance with those of the dominant\r\nparty, this was not the cause, but the effect of the jealousy which that\r\nparty thought fit to entertain. Oxford and Cambridge, to all appearance,\r\nhad nothing to dread. Hostilities were not declared. Even rivalry was\r\ndisclaimed. The new Institution did not aspire to participate in\r\nthe privileges which had been so long monopolised by those ancient\r\ncorporations. It asked for no franchises, no lands, no advowsons. It\r\ndid not interfere with that mysterious scale of degrees on which good\r\nchurchmen look with as much veneration as the Patriarch on the ladder\r\nup which he saw angels ascending. It did not ask permission to search\r\nhouses without warrants, or to take books from publishers without paying\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n     (1)_Thoughts on the Advancement of Academical Education in\r\n     England._ 1826.\r\n\r\nThere {332}was to be no melo-dramatic pageantry, no ancient ceremonial,\r\nno silver mace, no gowns either black or red, no hoods either of fur or\r\nof satin, no public orator to make speeches which nobody hears, no oaths\r\nsworn only to be broken. Nobody thought of emulating the cloisters, the\r\norgans, the painted glass, the withered mummies, the busts of great men,\r\nand the pictures of naked women, which attract visitors from every part\r\nof the isand to the banks of Isis and Cam. The persons whose advantage\r\nwas quietly in view belonged to a class of which very few ever find\r\ntheir way to the old colleges. The name of University was indeed\r\nassumed; and it has been said that this gave offence. But we are\r\nconfident that so ridiculous an objection can have been entertained by\r\nvery few. It reminds us of the whimsical cruelty with which Mercury, in\r\nPlautus, knocks down poor Soda for being so impudent as to have the same\r\nname with himself!\r\n\r\nWe know indeed that there are many to whom knowledge is hateful for its\r\nown sake,--owl-like beings, creatures of darkness, and rapine, and\r\nevil omen, who are sensible that their organs fit them only for the\r\nnight,--and that, as soon as the day arises, they shall be pecked back\r\nto their nooks by those on whom they now prey with impunity. By the arts\r\nof those, enemies of mankind, a large and influential party has been led\r\nto look with suspicion, if not with horror, on all schemes of education,\r\nand to doubt whether the ignorance of the people be not the best\r\nsecurity for its virtue and repose.\r\n\r\nWe will not at present attack the principles of these persons, because\r\nwe think that, even on those principles, they are bound to support the\r\nLondon University. If indeed it were possible to bring back, in all\r\ntheir ancient loveliness, the times of venerable absurdities and good\r\nold nuisances--if we could hope that gentlemen might again put their\r\nmarks to deeds without blushing--that it might again be thought a\r\nmiracle if any body in a parish could read, except the Vicar, or if the\r\nVicar were to read any thing but the Service,--that all the literature\r\nof the multitude might again be comprised in a ballad or a prayer,--that\r\nthe Bishop of Norwich might be burned for a heretic, and Sir Humphry\r\nDavy hanged for a conjurer,--that the Chancellor of the Exchequer might\r\nnegotiate loans with Mr. Rothschild, by extracting {333}one of his\r\nteeth daily till he brought him to term--then indeed the case would be\r\ndifferent. But, ala! who can venture to anticipate such a millennium of\r\nstupidity? The zealots of ignorance will therefore do well to consider,\r\nwhether, since the evils of knowledge cannot be altogether excluded, it\r\nmay not be desirable to set them in array against each other. The best\r\nstate of things, we will concede to them, would be that in which all\r\nmen should be dunces together. That might be called the age of gold.\r\nThe silver age would be that in which no man should be taught to spell,\r\nunless he could produce letters of ordination, or, like a candidate for\r\na German order of knighthood, prove his sixty-four quarters. Next in the\r\nscale would stand a community in which the higher and middling orders\r\nshould be well educated, and the labouring people utterly uninformed.\r\nBut the iron age would be that in which the lower classes should be\r\nrising in intelligence, while no corresponding improvement was taking,\r\nplace in the rank immediately above them.\r\n\r\nEngland is in the last of these states. From one end of the country to\r\nthe other the artisans, the draymen, the very ploughboys, are learning\r\nto read and write. Thousands of them attend lectures. Hundreds of\r\nthousands read newspapers. Whether this be a blessing or a curse, we are\r\nnot now inquiring. But such is the fact. Education is spreading amongst\r\nthe working people, and cannot be prevented from spreading amongst them.\r\nThe change which has taken place in this respect within twenty years is\r\nprodigious. No person surely, will venture to say that information has\r\nincreased in the same degree amongst those who constitute what may be\r\ncalled the lower part of the middling class,--farmers for instance,\r\nshopkeepers, or clerks in commercial houses.\r\n\r\nIf there be any truth in the principles held by the enemies of\r\neducation, this is the most dangerous state in which a country can\r\nbe placed. They maintain that knowledge renders the poor arrogant and\r\ndiscontented. It will hardly be disputed, we presume, that arrogance is\r\nthe result, not of the absolute situation in which a man may be placed,\r\nbut of the relation in which he stands to others. Where a whole society\r\nis equably rising in intelligence; where the distance between its\r\ndifferent orders remains the same, though every order advances, that\r\nfeeling is not likely to be excited. An individual {334}is not more vain\r\nof his knowledge, because he participates in the universal improvement,\r\nthan he is vain of his speed, because he is dying along with the earth\r\nand every thing upon it, at the rate of seventy thousand miles an hour.\r\nBut if he feels that _he_ is going forward, while those before him are\r\nstanding still, the case is altered. If ever the diffusion of knowledge\r\ncan be attended with the danger of which we hear so much, it is in\r\nEngland at the present moment. And this danger can be obviated in two\r\nways only. Unteach the pool-,--or teach those who may, by comparison,\r\nbe called the rich. The former it is plainly impossible to do: And\r\ntherefore, if those whom we are addressing be consistent, they will\r\nexert themselves to do the latter; and, by increasing the knowledge,\r\nincrease also the power of an extensive and important class,--a class\r\nwhich is as deeply interested as the peerage or the hierarchy in the\r\nprosperity and tranquillity of the country; a class which, while it is\r\ntoo numerous to be corrupted by government, is too intelligent to be\r\nduped by demagogues, and which, though naturally hostile to oppression\r\nand profusion, is not likely to carry its zeal for reform to lengths\r\ninconsistent with the security of property and the maintenance of social\r\norder.\r\n\r\n“But an University without religion!” softly expostulates the Quarterly\r\nReview.--“An University without religion!” roars John Bull, wedging\r\nin his pious horror between a slander and a double-entendre. And from\r\npulpits and visitation-dinners and combination-rooms innumerable, the\r\ncry is echoed and re-echoed, “An University without religion!”\r\n\r\nThis objection has really imposed on many excellent people, who have\r\nnot adverted to the immense difference which exists between the new\r\nInstitution and those foundations of which the members form a sort of\r\nfamily, living under the same roof, governed by the same regulations,\r\ncompelled to eat at the same table, and to return to their apartments at\r\nthe same hours. Have none of those who censure the London University on\r\nthis account, daughters who are educated at home, and who are attended\r\nby different teachers? The music-master, a good Protestant, comes at\r\ntwelve; the dancing-master, a French philosopher, at two; the Italian\r\nmaster, a believer in the blood of Saint Januarius, at three. The\r\nparents take upon themselves the office of instructing their child in\r\nreligion. She hears the preachers whom they prefer, {335}and reads the\r\ntheological works which they put into her hands. Who can deny that this\r\nis the case in innumerable families? Who can point ont any material\r\ndifference between the situation in which this girl is placed, and\r\nthat of a pupil at the new University? Why then is so crying an abuse\r\nsuffered to exist without reprehension? Is there no Sacheverell to raise\r\nthe old cry,--the Church is in danger,--that cry which was never uttered\r\nby any voice however feeble., or for any end however base, without being\r\ninstantly caught up and repeated through all the dark and loathsome\r\nnooks where bigotry nestles with corruption? Where is the charge of the\r\nBishop and the sermon of the Chaplain, the tear of the Chancellor and\r\nthe oath of the Heir-apparent, the speech of Mr. William Bankes and the\r\npamphlet of Sir Harcourt Lees? What means the silence of those filthy\r\nand malignant baboons, whose favourite diversion is to grin and sputter\r\nat innocence and beauty through the grates of their spunging-houses?\r\nWhy not attempt to blast the reputation of the poor ladies who are so\r\nirreligiously brought up? Why not search into all the secrets of their\r\nfamilies? Why not enliven the Sunday breakfast-tables of priests and\r\nplacemen with elopements of their great-aunts and the bankruptcies of\r\ntheir second cousins?\r\n\r\nOr, to make the parallel still clearer, take the case of a young man, a\r\nstudent, we will suppose, of surgery, resident in London. He wishes\r\nto become master of his profession, without neglecting other useful\r\nbranches of knowledge. In the morning he attends Mr. M’Culloch’s lecture\r\non Political Economy. He then repairs to the Hospital, and hears Sir\r\nAstley Cooper explain the mode of reducing fractures. In the afternoon\r\nhe joins one of the classes which Mr. Hamilton instructs in French or\r\nGerman. With regard to religions observances, he acts as he himself,\r\nor those under whose care he is, may think most advisable. Is there\r\nany thing objectionable in this? Is it not the most common case in the\r\nworld? And in what does it differ from that of a young man at the London\r\nUniversity? Our surgeon, it is true, will have to run over half\r\nLondon in search of his instructors; and the other will find all the\r\nlecture-rooms which he attends standing conveniently together, at the\r\nend of Gower Street. Is it in the local situation that the mischief\r\nlies? We have observed that, since Mr. Croker, in the last session\r\nof {336}Parliament, declared himself ignorant of the site of\r\nRussell Square, the plan of forming an University in so inelegant a\r\nneighbourhood has excited much contempt amongst those estimable persons\r\nwho think that the whole dignity of man consists in living within\r\ncertain districts, wearing coats made by certain tailors, and eschewing\r\ncertain meats and drinks. We should be sorry to think that the reports\r\nwhich any lying Mandeville from Bond Street may have circulated\r\nrespecting that Terra Incognita, could seriously prejudice the new\r\nCollege. The Secretary of the Admiralty, however, has the remedy in his\r\nown hands. When Captain Franklin returns, as we trust he soon will, from\r\nhis American expedition, he will, we hope, he sent to explore that other\r\nNorth-West passage which connects the city with the Regent’s Park. It\r\nwould then be found, that, though the natives generally belong to the\r\nsame race with those Oriental barbarians whose irruptions have long been\r\nthe terror of Hamilton Place and Grosvenor Square, they are, upon the\r\nwhole, quiet and inoffensive; that, though they possess no architectural\r\nmonument which can be compared to the Pavilion at Brighton, their\r\nhabitations are neat and commodious; and that their language has many\r\nroots in common with that which is spoken in St. James’s Street. One\r\nthing more we must mention, which will astonish some of our readers,\r\nas much as the discovery of the Syrian Christians of St. Thomas on the\r\ncoast of Malabar. Our religion has been introduced by some Xavier or\r\nAugustin of former times into these tracts. Churches, with all their\r\nappurtenances of hassocks and organs, are to be found there; and even\r\nthe tithe, that great _articulum stantis aut lahantis ecclesiae_, is by\r\nno means unknown.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the article on this subject in the last Number of\r\nthe Quarterly Review, severely censures the omission of religious\r\ninstruction, in a place styling itself an University,--never perceiving\r\nthat, with the inconsistency which belongs to error, he has already\r\nanswered the objection. “A place of education,” says he, “is the least\r\nof all proper to be made the arena of disputable and untried doctrine.”\r\n He severely censures those academies in which “a perpetual vacillation\r\nof doctrine is observable, whether in morals, metaphysics, or religion,\r\naccording to the frequency of change in the professional chair.” Now,\r\nwe venture to say, that these {337}considerations, if they are worth any\r\nthing at all, are decisive against any scheme of religions instruction\r\nin the London University. That University was intended to admit not only\r\nChristians of all persuasions, but even Jews. But suppose that it were\r\nto narrow its limits, to adopt the formularies of the Church of England,\r\nto require subscription, or the sacramental test, from every professor\r\nand from every pupil; still, we say, there would be more field for\r\ncontroversy, more danger of that vacillation of doctrine which seems to\r\nthe Reviewer to be so great an evil, on subjects of theology, than on\r\nall other subjects together. Take a science which is still young, a\r\nscience of considerable intricacy, a science, we may add, which the\r\npassions and interests of men have rendered more intricate than it is in\r\nits own nature, the science of Political Economy. Who will deny, that,\r\nfor one schism which is to be found among those who are engaged in that\r\nstudy, there are twenty on points of divinity, _within the Church of\r\nEngland?_\r\n\r\nIs it not notorious that Arminiens, who stand on the very frontier of\r\nPelagianism, and Calvinists, whom a line scarcely discernible separates\r\nfrom Antinomianism, are to be found among those who eat the bread of\r\nthe Establishment? Is it not notorious that predestination, final\r\nperseverance, the operation of grace, the efficacy of the sacraments,\r\nand a hundred other subjects which we could name, have been themes of\r\nviolent disputes between eminent churchmen? The ethics of Christianity,\r\nas well as its theory, have been the theme of dispute. One party calls\r\nthe other latitudinarian and worldly. The other retorts accusations of\r\nfanaticism and asceticism. The curate has been set against the rector,\r\nthe dean against the bishop. There is scarcely a parish in England into\r\nwhich the controversy has not found its way. There is scarcely an action\r\nof human life so trivial and familiar as not to be in some way or other\r\naffected by it. Whether it is proper to take in a Sunday newspaper, to\r\nshoot a partridge, to course a hare, to subscribe to a Bible Society, to\r\ndance, to play at whist, to read Tom Jones, to see Othello,--all these\r\nare questions on which the strongest difference of opinion exists\r\nbetween persons of high eminence in the hierarchy. The Quarterly\r\nReviewer thinks it a very bad thing, that “the first object of a\r\nnew professor should be to refute the fundamental positions of his\r\npredecessors.” What would be {338}the case if a High Churchman should\r\nsucceed a Low Churchman, or a Low Churchman a High Churchman, in\r\nthe chair of religion? And what possible security could the London\r\nUniversity have against such an event? What security have Oxford or\r\nCambridge now? In fact, all that we know of the state of religious\r\nparties at those place, fully bears out our statement. One of the most\r\nfamous divines of our time. Dr. Marsh, Bishop of Peterborough, Margaret\r\nProfessor of Theology at Cambridge, and author of eighty-seven of the\r\nmost unanswerable questions that ever man propounded to his fellow-men,\r\npublished a very singular hypothesis respecting the origin of the\r\nGospels. With the truth or falsehood of the hypothesis we have nothing\r\nto do. We have, however, heard another eminent Professor of the same\r\nUniversity, high in the Church, condemn the theory as utterly unfounded,\r\nand of most dangerous consequence to the orthodox faith. Nay, the very\r\npulpit of Saint Mary’s has been “the arena of disputable and untried\r\ndoctrine,” as much as ever was the chair of any Scotch or German\r\nprofessor,--a fact, of which any person may easily satisfy himself,\r\nwho will take the trouble to rescue from the hands of trunk-makers and\r\npastry-cooks, a few of the sermons which have been preached there, and\r\nsubsequently published. And if, in the course of his researches, he\r\nshould happen to light on that which was preached by a very eminent\r\nscholar on a very remarkable occasion, the installation of the Duke\r\nGloucester, he will see, that not only dispute, but something very like\r\nabuse, may take place between those whose office it is to instruct our\r\nyoung collegians in the doctrines and duties of Christianity.\r\n\r\n“But,” it is said, “would it not be shocking to expose the morals of\r\nyoung men to the contaminating influence of a great city, to all the\r\nfascinations of the Fives’ Court and the gaming table, the tavern and\r\nthe saloon?” Shocking, indeed, we grant, if it were possible to send\r\nthem all to Oxford and Cambridge, those blessed spots where, to use the\r\nimagery of their own prize-poems, the Saturnian age still lingers,\r\nand where white-robed Innocence has left the print of her departing\r\nfootsteps. There, we know, all the men are philosophers, and all the\r\nwomen vestals. There, simple and bloodless repasts support the body\r\nwithout distressing the mind. There, while the sluggish world is still\r\nsleeping, the ingenious {339}youth hasten to pour forth their fervent\r\norisons in the chapel; and in the evening, elsewhere the season of\r\nriot and license, indulge themselves with a solitary walk beneath the\r\nvenerable avenues, musing on the vanity of sensual pursuits, and the\r\neternity and sublimity of virtue. But, alas! these blissful abodes of\r\nthe Seven Cardinal Virtues are neither large enough nor cheap enough for\r\nthose who stand in need of instruction. Many thousands of young men will\r\nlive in London, whether an University be established there or not,--and\r\nthat for this simple reason, that they cannot afford to live elsewhere.\r\nThat they should be condemned to one misfortune because they labour\r\nunder another, and debarred from knowledge because they are surrounded\r\nwith temptations to vice, seems to be not a very rational or humane mode\r\nof proceeding.\r\n\r\nTo speak seriously, in comparing the dangers to which the morals\r\nof young men are exposed in London, with those which exist at the\r\nUniversities, there is something to be said on both sides. The\r\ntemptations of London may be greater. But with the temptation there is a\r\nway to escape. If the student live with his family, he will be under the\r\ninfluence of restraints more powerful, and, we will add, infinitely more\r\nsalutary and respectable, than those which the best disciplined colleges\r\ncan impose. Even if he be left completely to his own devices, he will\r\nstill have within his reach two inestimable advantages, from which the\r\nstudents of Oxford and Cambridge are almost wholly excluded, the society\r\nof men older than himself, and of modest women.\r\n\r\nThere are no intimacies more valuable than those which a young man forms\r\nwith one who is his senior by ten or twelve years. Those years do\r\nnot destroy the sympathy and the sense of equality without which no\r\ncordiality can exist. Yet they strengthen the principles, and form the\r\njudgment. They make one of the parties a sensible adviser, and the other\r\na docile listener. Such friendships it is almost impossible to form\r\nat College. Between the man of twenty and the man of thirty there is a\r\ngreat gulf, a distinction which cannot be mistaken, which is marked by\r\nthe dress and by the seat, at prayers and at table. We do not believe\r\nthat, of the young students at our ancient seats of learning, one in ten\r\nlives in confidence and familiarity with any member of the University\r\nwho is a Master of Arts. When the members of {340}the University are\r\ndeducted, the society of Oxford and Cambridge is no more than that of\r\nan ordinary county town.\r\n\r\nThis state of things, it is clear, does more harm than all the exertions\r\nof Proctors and Proproctors can do good. The errors of young men are of\r\na nature with which it is very difficult to deal. Slight punishments are\r\ninefficient; severe punishments generally and justly odious. The best\r\ncourse is to give them over to the arm of public opinion. To restrain\r\nthem, it is necessary to make them discreditable. But how can they be\r\nmade discreditable while the offenders associate only with those who are\r\nof the same age, who are exposed to the same temptations, and who are\r\nwilling to grant the indulgence which they themselves may need? It is\r\nutterly impossible that a code of morality and honour, enacted by the\r\nyoung only, can be so severe against juvenile irregularities as that\r\nwhich is in force in general society, where manhood and ape have the\r\ndeciding voice, and where the partial inclinations of those whose\r\npassions are strong, and whose reason is weak, are withstood by those\r\nwhom time and domestic life have sobered. The difference resembles\r\nthat which would be found between laws passed by an assembly consisting\r\nsolely of farmers, or solely of weavers, and those of a senate fairly\r\nrepresenting every interest of the community.\r\n\r\nA student in London, even though he may not live with his own relatives,\r\nwill generally have it in his power to mix with respectable female\r\nsociety. This is not only a very pleasant thing, but it is one which,\r\nthough it may not make him moral, is likely to make him decorous, and to\r\npreserve him from that brainless and heartless Yahooism, that disdain\r\nof the character of women, and that brutal indifference to their misery,\r\nwhich is the worst offence, and the severest punishment of the finished\r\nlibertine. Many of the pupils will, in all probability, continue to\r\nreside with their parents or friends. We own that we can conceive no\r\nsituation more agreeable or more salutary. One of the worst effects\r\nof College habits is that distaste for domestic life which they almost\r\ninevitably generate. The system is monastic; and it tends to produce\r\nthe monastic selfishness, inattention to the convenience of others,\r\nand impatience of petty privations. We mean no reproach. It is utterly\r\nimpossible that the most amiable man in the world can be accustomed to\r\nlive for {341}years independent of his neighbours, and to lay all his\r\nplans with a view only to himself, without becoming, in some degree,\r\nunfitted for a family. A course of education which should combine the\r\nenjoyments of a home with the excitements of a University, would be more\r\nlikely than any other to form characters at once affectionate and manly.\r\nHomebred boys, it is often said, are idle. The cause, we suspect, is the\r\nwant of competitors. We no more believe that a young man at the London\r\nUniversity would be made idle by the society of his mothers and sisters,\r\nthan that the old German warriors, or the combatants in the tournaments\r\nof the middle ages, were made cowards by the presence of female\r\nspectators. On the contrary, we are convinced that his ambition would\r\nbe at once animated and consecrated by daily intercourse with those who\r\nwould be dearest to him, and most inclined to rejoice in his success.\r\n\r\nThe eulogists of the old Universities are fond of dwelling on the\r\nglorious associations connected with them. It has often been said that\r\nthe young scholar is likely to catch a generous enthusiasm from looking\r\nupon spots ennobled by so many great names--that he can scarcely see the\r\nchair in which Bentley sat, the tree which Alilton planted, the wadis\r\nwithin which Wickliffe presided, the books illustrated by the autographs\r\nof famous men, the halls hung with their pictures, the chapels hallowed\r\nby their tombs, without aspiring to imitate those whom he admires. Far\r\nbe it from us to speak with disrespect of such feelings. It is possible\r\nthat the memorials of those who have asserted the freedom, and extended\r\nthe empire of the mind, may produce a strong impression on a sensitive\r\nand ardent disposition. But these instances are rare. “Coram Lepidis\r\nmale vivitur.” Young academicians venture to get drunk within a few\r\nyards of the grave of Newton, and to commit solecisms, though the\r\nawful eye of Erasmus frowns upon them from the canvas. Some more homely\r\nsentiment, some more obvious association is necessary. For our part,\r\nwhen a young man is to be urged to persevering industry, and fortified\r\nagainst the seductions of pleasure, we would rather send him to the\r\nfireside of his own family, than to the abodes of philosophers who\r\ndied centuries ago,--and to those kind familiar faces which are always\r\nanxious in his anxiety, and joyful in his success, than to the portrait\r\nof any waiter that ever wore cap and gown.\r\n\r\nThe {342}cry against the London University lias been swelled by the\r\nvoices of many really conscientious persons. Many have joined in it from\r\nthe mere wanton love of mischief. But we believe that it has principally\r\noriginated in the jealousy of those who are attached to Cambridge\r\nand Oxford, either by their interests, or by those feelings which men\r\nnaturally entertain towards the place of their education, and which,\r\nwhen they do not interfere with schemes of public advantage, are\r\nentitled to respect. Many of these persons, we suspect, entertain\r\na vague apprehension, scarcely avowed even to themselves, that some\r\ndefects in the constitution of their favourite Academies will be\r\nrendered more glaring by the contrast which the system of this new\r\nCollege will exhibit.\r\n\r\nThat there are such defects, great and radical defects in the structure\r\nof the two Universities, we are strongly inclined to believe: and\r\nthe jealousy which many of their members have expressed of the new\r\nInstitution greatly strengthens our opinion. What those defects appear\r\nto us to be, we shall attempt to state with frankness, but, at the same\r\ntime, we trust, with candour.\r\n\r\nWe are sensible that we have undertaken a dangerous task. There is\r\nperhaps no subject on which more people have made up their minds without\r\nknowing why. Whenever this is the case, discussion ends in scurrility,\r\nthe last resource of the disputant who cannot answer, and who will not\r\nsubmit. The scurrility of those who are scurrilous on all occasions, and\r\nagainst all opponents, by nature and by habit, by taste and by trade,\r\ncan excite only the mirth or the pity of a well regulated mind. But we\r\nneither posess, nor affect to possess, that degree of philosophy, which\r\nwould render us indifferent to the pain and resentment of sincere and\r\nrespectable persons, whose prejudices we are compelled to assail. It is\r\nnot in the bitterness of party spirit, it is not in the wantonness of\r\nparadox and declamation, that we would put to hazard the good will\r\nof learned and estimable men. Such a sacrifice must be powerful, and\r\nnothing but a sense of public duty would lead us to make it. We would\r\nearnestly entreat the admirers of the two Universities to reflect on the\r\nimportance of this subject, the advantages of calm investigation, and\r\nthe folly of trusting, in an age like the present, to mere dogmatism\r\nand invective. If the system which {343}they love and venerate rest upon\r\njust principles, the examination which we propose to institute, into\r\nthe state of its foundations, can only serve to prove their solidity. If\r\nthey be unsound, we will not permit ourselves to think, that intelligent\r\nand honourable men can wish to disguise a fact which, for the sake of\r\nthis country, and of the whole human race, ought to be widely known. Let\r\nthem, instead of reiterating assertions which leave the question exactly\r\nwhere they found it; instead of turning away from all argument, as\r\nif the subject were one on which doubt partook of the nature of sin;\r\ninstead of attributing to selfishness or malevolence, that which may at\r\nworst be harmless error, join us in coolly studying so interesting and\r\nmomentous a point.--As to this, however, they will please themselves. We\r\nspeak to the English people. The public mind, if we are not deceived, is\r\napproaching to manhood. It has outgrown its swaddling-bands, and thrown\r\naway its play-things. It can no longer be amused by a rattle, or laid\r\nasleep by a song, or awed by a fairy tale. At such a time, we cannot\r\ndoubt that we shall obtain an impartial hearing.\r\n\r\nOur objections to Oxford and Cambridge may be summed up in two words,\r\ntheir Wealth and their Privileges. Their prosperity does not depend on\r\nthe public approbation. It would therefore be strange if they deserved\r\nthe public approbation. Their revenues are immense. Their degrees are,\r\nin some professions, indispensable. Like manufacturers who enjoy a\r\nmonopoly, they work at such an advantage, that they can venture to work\r\nill.\r\n\r\nEvery person, we presume, will acknowledge that, to establish an\r\nacademic system on immutable principles, would be the height of\r\nabsurdity. Every year sees the empire of science enlarged by the\r\nacquisition of some new province, or improved by the construction of\r\nsome easier road. Surely the change which daily takes place in the state\r\nof knowledge, ought to be accompanied by a corresponding change in the\r\nmethod of instruction. In many cases the rude and imperfect works of\r\nearly speculators ought to give place to the more complete and luminous\r\nperformances of those who succeed them. Even the comparative value of\r\nlanguages is subject to great fluctuations. The same tongue which at\r\none period may be richer than any other in valuable works, may, some\r\ncenturies after, be poorer than any. That, while such revolutions\r\n{344}take place, education ought to remain unchanged, is a proposition\r\ntoo absurd to be maintained for a moment.\r\n\r\nIf it be desirable that education should, by a gradual and constant\r\nchange, adapt itself to the circumstances of every generation, how\r\nis this object to be secured? We answer--only by perfect freedom of\r\ncompetition. Under such a system, every possible exigence would be met.\r\nWhatever language, whatever art, whatever science, it might at any time\r\nbe useful to know, _that_, men would surely learn, and woidd as surely\r\nfind instructors to teach. The professor who should persist in devoting\r\nhis attention to branches of knowledge which had become useless, would\r\nsoon be deserted by his pupils. There would be as much of every sort of\r\ninformation as would afford profit and pleasure to the possessor--and no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nBut the riches and the franchises of our Universities prevent this\r\nsalutary rivalry from taking place. In its stead is introduced an\r\nunnatural system of premiums, prohibitions, and apprenticeships.\r\nEnormous bounties are lavished on particular acquirements; and, in\r\nconsequence, there is among our youth a glut of Greek, Latin, and\r\nMathematics, and a lamentable scarcity of every thing else.\r\n\r\nWe are by no means inclined to depreciate the studies which are\r\nencouraged at Oxford and Cambridge. We should reprobate with the same\r\nseverity a system tinder which a like exclusive protection should be\r\nextended to French or Spanish, Chemistry or Mineralogy, Metaphysics\r\nor Political Economy. Some of these branches of knowledge are very\r\nimportant. But they may not always be equally important. Five hundred\r\nyears hence, the Burmese language may contain the most valuable books\r\nin the world. Sciences, for which there is now no name, and of which\r\nthe first rudiments are still undiscovered, may then be in the greatest\r\ndemand. Our objection is to the principle. We abhor intellectual\r\nperpetuities. A chartered and endowed College, strong in its wealth\r\nand in its degrees, does not find it necessary to teach what is useful,\r\nbecause it can pay men to learn what is useless. Every fashion which was\r\nin vogue at the time of its foundation, enters into its constitution and\r\npartakes of its immortality. Its abuses savour of the reality, and its\r\nprejudices vest in mortmain, with its lands. In the present instance,\r\nthe consequences are notorious. We every day see clever {345}men of\r\nfour and five-and-twenty, loaded with academical honours and\r\nrewards,---scholarships, fellowships, whole cabinets of medals, whole\r\nshelves of prize books,--enter into life with their education still to\r\nbegin, unacquainted with the history, the literature, we might almost\r\nsay, the language of their country, unacquainted with the first\r\nprinciples of the laws under which they live, unacquainted with the very\r\nrudiments of moral and political science! Who will deny that this is the\r\nstate of things? Or who will venture to defend it?\r\n\r\nThis is no new complaint. Long before society had so far outstripped the\r\nColleges in the career of improvement as it has since done, the evil was\r\nnoticed and traced to its true cause, by that great philosopher who most\r\naccurately mapped all the regions of science, and furnished the human\r\nintellect with its most complete Itinerary. “It is not to be forgotten,”\r\n says Lord Bacon, “that the dedicating of foundations and donations\r\nto professory learning, hath not only had a malign influence upon\r\nthe growth of sciences, but hath also been prejudicial to states and\r\ngovernments: For hence it proceed-eth, that princes find a solitude in\r\nrespect of able men to serve them in causes of state, _because there is\r\nno education collegiate which is free_, where such as were so disposed\r\nmight give themselves to histories, modern languages, books of policy\r\nand civil discourse, and other like enablements unto causes of state.”\r\n The warmest admirers of the present system will hardly deny, that, if\r\nthis was an evil in the sixteenth century, it must be a much greater\r\nevil in the nineteenth. The literature of Greece and Rome is now what\r\nit was then. That of every modern language has received considerable\r\naccessions. And surely, “books of policy and civil discourse” are as\r\nimportant to an English gentleman of the present day, as they could be\r\nto a subject of James the First.\r\n\r\nWe repeat, that we are not disparaging either the dead languages or the\r\nexact sciences. We only say, that if they are useful they will not need\r\npeculiar encouragement, and that, if they are useless, they ought not to\r\nreceive it. Those who maintain that the present system is necessary\r\nto promote the study of classical and mathematical knowledge, are the\r\npersons who really depreciate those pursuits. They do in (1) Advancement\r\nof Learning, Book II.\r\n\r\nIn fact {346}declare, by implication, that neither amusement nor profit\r\nis to be derived from them, and that no man has any motive to employ\r\nhis time upon them, unless he expects that they may help him to a\r\nfellowship.\r\n\r\nThe utility of mathematical knowledge is felt in every part of the\r\nsystem of life, and acknowledged by every rational man. But does it\r\ntherefore follow, that people ought to be paid to acquire it. A scarcity\r\nof persons capable of making almanacks and measuring land, is as little\r\nto be apprehended as a scarcity of blacksmiths. In fact, very few of\r\nour academical mathematicians turn their knowledge to such practical\r\npurposes. There are many wranglers who have never touched a quadrant.\r\nWhat peculiar title then has the mere speculative knowledge of\r\nmathematical truth to such costly remuneration? The answer is well\r\nknown. It makes men good reasoners: it habituates them to strict\r\naccuracy in drawing inferences. In this statement there is\r\nunquestionably some truth. A man who understands the nature of\r\nmathematical reasoning, the closest of all kinds of reasoning, is likely\r\nto reason better than another on points not mathematical, as a man who\r\ncan dance generally walks better than a man who cannot.. But no people\r\nwalk so ill as dancing-masters, and no people reason so ill as mere\r\nmathematicians. They are accustomed to look only for one species of\r\nevidence; a species of evidence of which the transactions of life do\r\nnot admit. When they come from certainties to probabilities, from a\r\nsyllogism to a witness, their superiority is at an end. They resemble\r\na man who, never having seen any object which was not either black or\r\nwhite, should be required to discriminate between two near shades\r\nof grey. Hence, on questions of religion, policy, or common life,\r\nwe perpetually see these boasted demonstrators either extravagantly\r\ncredulous, or extravagantly sceptical. That the science is a necessary\r\ningredient in a liberal education, we admit. But it is only an\r\ningredient, and an ingredient which is peculiarly dangerous, unless\r\ndiluted by a large admixture of others. To encourage it by such rewards\r\nas are bestowed at Cambridge, is to make the occasional tonic of the\r\nmind its morning and evening nutriment.\r\n\r\nThe partisans of classical literature are both more numerous and more\r\nenthusiastic than the mathematicians; and the ignorant violence with\r\nwhich their cause has sometimes been assailed, {347}has added to its\r\npopularity. On this subject we are sure that we are at least impartial\r\njudges. We feel the warmest admiration for the great remains of\r\nantiquity. We gratefully acknowledge the benefits which mankind has owed\r\nto them. But we would no more sutler a pernicious system to be protected\r\nby the reverence which is due to them, than we would show our reverence\r\nfor a saint by erecting his shrine into a sanctuary for criminals.\r\n\r\nAn eloquent scholar has said, that ancient literature was the ark in\r\nwhich all the civilization of the world was preserved during the deluge\r\nof barbarism. We confess it. But we do not read that Noah thought\r\nhimself bound to live in the ark after the deluge had subsided. When\r\nour ancestors first began to consider the study of the classics as the\r\nprincipal part of education, little or nothing worth reading was to be\r\nfound in any modern language. Circumstances have confessedly changed. Is\r\nit not possible that a change of system may be desirable?\r\n\r\nOur opinion of the Latin tongue will, we fear, be considered heretical.\r\nWe cannot but think that its vocabulary is miserably poor, and its\r\nmechanism deficient both in power and precision. The want of a definite\r\narticle, and of a distinction between the preterite and the aorist\r\ntenses, are two defects which are alone sufficient to place it below any\r\nother language with which we are acquainted. In its most flourishing\r\nera it was reproached with poverty of expression. Cicero, indeed, was\r\ninduced, by his patriotic feelings to deny the charge. But the perpetual\r\nrecurrence of Greek words in his most hurried and familiar letters, and\r\nthe frequent use which he is compelled to make of them, in spite of all\r\nhis exertions to avoid them, in his philosophical works, fully prove\r\nthat even this great master of the Latin tongue felt the evil which he\r\nlaboured to conceal from others.\r\n\r\nWe do not think much better of the writers, as a body, than of the\r\nlanguage. The literature of Rome was born old. All the signs of\r\ndecrepitude were on it in the cradle. We look in vain for the sweet lisp\r\nand the graceful wildness of an infant dialect. We look in vain for a\r\nsingle great creative mind,--for a Homer or a Dante, a Shakspeare or a\r\nCervantes. In their place we have a crowd of fourth-rate and fifth-rate\r\nauthors, translators, and imitators without end. The rich heritage of\r\nGrecian philosophy and poetry was fatal {348}to the Romans. They would\r\nhave acquired more wealth, if they had succeeded to less. Instead of\r\naccumulating fresh intellectual treasures, they contented themselves\r\nwith enjoying, disposing in new forms, or impairing by an injudicious\r\nmanagement, those which they took by descent. Hence, in most of their\r\nworks, there is scarcely any thing spontaneous and racy, scarcely any\r\noriginality in the thoughts, scarcely any idiom in the style. Their\r\npoetry tastes of the hot-house. It is trail-planted from Greece, with\r\nthe earth of Pindus clinging round its roots. It is nursed in careful\r\nseclusion from the Italian air. The gardeners are often skilful; but the\r\nfruit is almost always sickly. One hardy and prickly shrub, of genuine\r\nLatin growth, must indeed be excepted. Satire was the only indigenous\r\nproduce of Roman talent; and, in our judgment, by far the best.\r\n\r\nWe are often told the Latin language is more strictly grammatical than\r\nthe English; and that it is, therefore, necessary to study it, in\r\norder to speak English with elegance and accuracy. This is one of those\r\nremarks which are repeated till they pass into axioms, only because they\r\nhave so little meaning, that nobody thinks it worth while to refute them\r\nat their first appearance. If those who say that the Latin language is\r\nmore strictly grammatical than the English, mean only that it is\r\nmore regular, that there are fewer exceptions to its general laws of\r\nderivation, inflection, and construction, we grant it. This is, at least\r\nfor the purposes of the orator and the poet, rather a defect than a\r\nmerit; but be it merit or defect, it can in no possible way facilitate\r\nthe acquisition of any other language. It would be about as reasonable\r\nto say, that the simplicity of the Code Napoleon renders the study of\r\nthe laws of England easier than formerly. If it be meant, that the Latin\r\nlanguage is formed in more strict accordance with the general principles\r\nof grammar than the English, that is to say, that the relations which\r\nwords bear to each other are more strictly analogous to the relations\r\nbetween the ideas which they represent in Latin than in English, we\r\nventure to doubt the fact. We are quite sure, that not one in ten\r\nthousand of those who repeat the hackneyed remark on which we are\r\ncommenting, have ever considered whether there be any principles of\r\ngrammar whatever, anterior to positive enactment,--any solecism which is\r\na _malum in se_, as distinct from a _malum prohibitum_.\r\n\r\nOr, if {349}we suppose that there exist such principles, is not the\r\ncircumstance, that a particular rule is found in one language and not in\r\nanother, a sufficient proof that it is not one of those principles? That\r\na man who knows Latin is likely to know English better than one who does\r\nnot, we do not dispute. But this advantage is not peculiar to the study\r\nof Latin. Every language throws light on every other. There is not a\r\nsingle foreign tongue which will not suggest to a man of sense some new\r\nconsiderations respecting his own. We acknowledge, too, that the great\r\nbody of our educated countrymen learn to grammatieise their English by\r\nmeans of their Latin. This, however, proves, not the usefulness of their\r\nLatin, but the folly of their other instructors. Instead of being a\r\nvindication of the present system of education, it is a high charge\r\nagainst it. A man who thinks the knowledge of Latin essential to\r\nthe purity of English diction, either has never conversed with an\r\naccomplished woman, or does not deserve to have conversed with her.\r\nWe are sure, that all persons who are in the habit of hearing public\r\nspeaking must have observed, that the orators who are fondest of quoting\r\nLatin, are by no means the most scrupulous about marring their native\r\ntongue. We could mention several Members of Parliament, who never fail\r\nto usher in their scraps of Horace and Juvenal with half a dozen false\r\ncon cords.\r\n\r\nThe Latin language is principally valuable as an introduction to the\r\nGreek, the insignificant portico of a most chaste and majestic fabric.\r\nOn this subject, our Confession of Faith will, we trust, be approved by\r\nthe most orthodox scholar. We cannot refuse our admiration to that most\r\nwonderful and perfect machine of human thought, to the flexibility, the\r\nharmony, the gigantic power, the exquisite delicacy, the infinite wealth\r\nof words, the incomparable felicity of expression, in which are united\r\nthe energy of the English, the neatness of the French, the sweet and\r\ninfantine simplicity of the Tuscan. Of all dialects, it is the best\r\nfitted for the purposes both of science and of elegant literature. The\r\nphilosophical vocabularies of ancient Rome, and of modern Europe, have\r\nbeen derived from that of Athens. Yet none of the imitations has ever\r\napproached the richness and precision of the original. It traces with\r\nease distinctions so subtle, as to be lost in every other language. It\r\ndraws lines where all the other instruments {350}of the reason only make\r\nblots. Nor is it less distinguished by the facilities which it affords\r\nto the poet. There are pages even in the Greek Dictionaries over which\r\nit is impossible to glance without delight. Every word suggests some\r\npleasant or striking image, which, wholly unconnected as it is with that\r\nwhich precedes or that which follows, gives the same, sort of pleasure\r\nwith that which we derive from reading the Adonais of poor Shelley, or\r\nfrom looking at those elegant, though unmeaning friezes, in which the\r\neye wanders along a line of beautiful faces, graceful draperies, stags,\r\nchariots, altars, and garlands. The literature is not unworthy of the\r\nlanguage. It may boast of four poets of the very first order, Homer,\r\nÆschylus. Sophocles, and Aristophanes,--of Demosthenes, the greatest of\r\norators--of Aristotle, who is perhaps entitled to the same rank among\r\nphilosophers, and of Plato, who, if not the most satisfactory of\r\nphilosophers, is at least the most fascinating. These are the great\r\nnames of Greece; and to these is to be added a long list of ingenious\r\nmoralists, wits, and rhetoricians, of poets who, in the lower\r\ndepartments of their art, deserve the greatest praise, and of historians\r\nwho, at least in the talent of narration, have never been equalled.\r\n\r\nIt was justly said by the Emperor Charles the Fifth, that to learn a new\r\nlanguage was to acquire a new soul. He who is acquainted only with the\r\nwriters of his native tongue, is in perpetual danger of confounding what\r\nis accidental with what is essential, and of supposing that tastes and\r\nhabits of thought, which belong only to his own age and country, are\r\ninseparable from the nature of man. Initiated into foreign literature,\r\nhe finds that principles of politics and morals, directly contrary to\r\nthose which he has hitherto supposed to be unquestionable, because he\r\nnever heard them questioned, have been held by large and enlightened\r\ncommunities; that feelings, which are so universal among his\r\ncontemporaries, that he had supposed them instinctive, have been unknown\r\nto whole generations; that images, which have never failed to excite the\r\nridicule of those among whom he has lived, have been thought sublime by\r\nmillions. He thus loses that Chinese cast of mind, that stupid contempt\r\nfor every thing beyond the wall of his celestial empire, which was the\r\neffect of his former ignorance. New associations take place among his\r\nideas. He doubts where he formerly dogmatised. He tolerates {351}where\r\nhe formerly execrated. He ceases to confound that which is universal\r\nand eternal in human passions and opinions with that which is local and\r\ntemporary. This is one of the most useful effects which results from\r\nstudying the literature of other countries; and it is one which the\r\nremains of Greece, composed at a remote period, and in a state of\r\nsociety widely different from our own, are peculiarly calculated to\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nBut, though we are sensible that great advantages may be derived from\r\nthe study of the Greek language, we think that they may be purchased at\r\ntoo high a price: And we think that seven or eight years of the life of\r\na man who is to enter into active life at two or three-and-twenty,\r\nis too high a price. Those are bad economists who look only to the\r\nexcellence of the article for which they are bargaining, and never ask\r\nabout the cost. The cost, in the present instance, is too often\r\nthe whole of that invaluable portion of time during which a fund of\r\nintellectual pleasure is to be stored up and the foundations of\r\nwisdom and usefulness laid. No person doubts that much knowledge may be\r\nobtained from the Classics. It is equally certain that much gold may be\r\nfound in Spain. But it by no moans necessarily follows, that it is wise\r\nto work the Spanish mines, or to learn the ancient languages. Before the\r\nvoyage of Columbus, Spain supplied all Europe with the precious metals.\r\nThe discovery of America changed the state of things. New mines were\r\nfound, from which gold could be procured in greater plenty, and with\r\nless labour. The old works were therefore abandoned--it being manifest\r\nthose who persisted in laying out capital on them would be undersold and\r\nruined. A new world of literature and science has also been discovered.\r\nNew veins of intellectual wealth have been laid open. But a monstrous\r\nsystem of bounties and prohibitions compels us still to go on delving\r\nfor a few glittering grains in the dark and laborious shaft of\r\nantiquity, instead of penetrating a district which would reward a less\r\npainful search with a more lucrative return. If, after the conquest\r\nof Pern, Spain had enacted that, in order to enable the old mines to\r\nmaintain a competition against the new, a hundred pistoles should be\r\ngiven to every person who should extract an ounce of gold from them, the\r\nparallel would be complete.\r\n\r\nWe will admit that the Greek language is a more valuable language\r\n{352}than the French, the Italian, or the Spanish. But whether it be\r\nmore valuable than all the three together, may be doubted; and that\r\nall the three may be acquired in less than half the time in which it is\r\npossible to become thoroughly acquainted with the Greek, admits of\r\nno doubt at all. Nor does the evil end here. Not only do the modern\r\ndialects of the Continent receive less attention than they deserve, but\r\nour own tongue, second to that of Greece alone in force and copiousness,\r\nour own literature, second to none that ever existed, so rich in poetry,\r\nin eloquence, in philosophy, is unpardonably neglected. All the nineteen\r\nplays of Euripides are digested, from the first bubbling froth of the\r\nHecuba to the last vapid dregs of the Electra; while our own sweet\r\nFletcher, the second name of the modern drama, in spite of all the\r\nbrilliancy of his wit, and all the luxury of his tenderness, is suffered\r\nto be neglected. The Essay on the Human Understanding is abandoned for\r\nthe Theotetus and the Phoedon. We have known the dates of all the petty\r\nskirmisher, of the Peloponnesian war carefully transcribed and committed\r\nto memory, by a man who thought that Hyde and Clarendon were two\r\ndifferent persons! That such a man has paid a dear price for his\r\nlearning, will be admitted. But, it may be said, he has at least\r\nsomething to show for it. Unhappily he has sacrificed, in order to\r\nacquire it, the very things without which it was impossible for him to\r\nuse it. He has acted like a man living in a small lodging, who, instead\r\nof spending his money in enlarging his apartments and fitting them up\r\ncommodiously, should lay it all out on furniture fit only for Chatsworth\r\nor Belvoir. His little rooms are blocked up with bales of rich stuffs\r\nand heaps of gilded ornaments, which have cost more than he ean afford,\r\nyet which he has no opportunity and no room to display. Elegant and\r\nprecious in themselves, they are here utterly out of place; and their\r\npossessor finds that, at a ruinous expense, he has bought nothing\r\nbut inconvenience and ridicule. Who has not seen men to whom ancient\r\nlearning is an absolute curse, who have laboured only to accumulate what\r\nthey cannot enjoy? They come forth into the world, expecting to find\r\nonly a larger university. They find that they are surrounded by people\r\nwho have not the least respect for the skill with which they detect\r\netymologies, and twist corrupt Epodes into something like meaning.\r\nClassical knowledge is indeed valued by all intelligent {353}men; but\r\nnot such classical knowledge as theirs. To be prized by the public, it\r\nmust be refined from its grosser particles, burnished into splendour,\r\nformed into graceful ornaments, or into current coin. Learning in the\r\nore, learning with all the dross around it, is nothing to the common\r\nspectator. He prefers the cheapest tinsel; and leaves the rare and\r\nvaluable clod, to the few who have the skill to detect its qualities,\r\nand the curiosity to prize them.\r\n\r\nNo man, we allow, can be said to have received a complete and liberal\r\neducation, unless he have acquired a knowledge of the ancient languages.\r\nBut not one gentleman in fifty can possibly receive what we should\r\ncall a complete and liberal education. That term includes not only the\r\nancient languages, but those of France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. It\r\nincludes mathematics, the experimental sciences, and moral philosophy.\r\nAn intimate acquaintance both with the profound and polite parts of\r\nEnglish literature is indispensable. Few of those who are intended for\r\nprofessional or commercial life can find time for all these studies. It\r\nnecessarily follows, that some portion of them must be given up: And the\r\nquestion is, what portion? We say, provide for the mind as you provide\r\nfor the body,--first necessaries,--then conveniences,--lastly luxuries.\r\nUnder which of those heads do the Greek and Latin languages come?\r\nSurely under the last. Of all the pursuits which we have mentioned, they\r\nrequire the greatest sacrifice of time. He who can afford time for them,\r\nand for the others also, is perfectly right in acquiring them. He who\r\ncannot, will, if he is wise, be content to go without them. If a man is\r\nable to continue his studies till his twenty-eighth or thirtieth year,\r\nby all means let him learn Latin and Greek. If he must terminate them at\r\none-and-twenty, we should in general advise him to be satisfied with the\r\nmodern languages. If he is forced to enter into active life at fifteen\r\nor sixteen, we should think it best that he should confine himself\r\nalmost entirely to his native tongue, and thoroughly imbue his mind with\r\nthe spirit of its best writers. But no! The artificial restraints and\r\nencouragements which our academic system has introduced have altogether\r\n_reversed_ this natural and salutary order of things. We deny ourselves\r\nwhat is indispensable, that we may procure what is superfluous. We act\r\nlike a day-labourer who should stint himself in bread, that he might\r\nnow and then treat {354}himself with a pottle of January strawberries.\r\nCicero tells us, in the Offices, a whimsical anecdote of Cato the\r\nCensor. Somebody asked him what was the best mode of employing capital,\r\nhe said, To farm pood pasture land. What the next? To farm middling\r\npasture land. What next? To farm bad pasture land. Now the notions which\r\nprevail in England respecting classical learning seem to us very much\r\nto resemble those which the old Roman entertained with regard to his\r\nfavourite method of cultivation. Is a young man able to spare the time\r\nnecessary for passing through the University? Make him a good classical\r\nscholar! But a second, instead of residing at the University, must go\r\ninto business when he leaves school. Make him then a tolerable classical\r\nscholar! A third has still less time for snatching up knowledge, and\r\nis destined for active employment while still a boy. Make him a bad\r\nclassical scholar! If he does not become a Flaminius, or a Buchanan, he\r\nmay learn to write nonsense verses. If he does not get on to Horace, he\r\nmay read the first book of Cæsar. If there is not time even for such\r\na degree of improvement, he may at least be flogged through that\r\nimmemorial vestibule of learning. “Quis doeet? Who teacheth? Magister\r\ndoeet. The master teacheth.” Would to heaven that he taught something\r\nbetter worth knowing!\r\n\r\nAll these evils are produced by the state of our Universities. Where\r\nthey lead, those who prepare pupils for them, are forced to follow.\r\nUnder a free system, the ancient languages would be less read, but quite\r\nas much enjoyed. We should not see so many lads who have a smattering of\r\nLatin and Greek, from which they derive no pleasure, and which, as soon\r\nas they are at liberty, they make all possible haste to forget. It\r\nmust be owned, also, that there would be fewer young men really well\r\nacquainted with the ancient tongues. But there would be many more\r\nwho had treasured up useful and agreeable information. Those who were\r\ncompelled to bring their studies to an early close, would turn their\r\nattention to objects easily attainable. Those who enjoyed a longer\r\nspace of literary leisure, would still exert themselves to acquire the\r\nclassical languages. They would study them, not for any direct emolument\r\nwhich they would expect from the acquisition, but for their own\r\nintrinsic value. Their number would be smaller, no doubt, than that of\r\npresent aspirants after {355}classical honours. But they would not, like\r\nmost of those aspirants, leave Homer and Demosthenes to gather dust on\r\nthe shelves, as soon as the temporary purpose had been served. There\r\nwould be fewer good scholars of twenty-five; but we believe that there\r\nwould be quite as many of fifty.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have argued on the hypothesis most favourable to the\r\nUniversities. We have supposed that the bounties which they offer to\r\ncertain studies are fairly bestowed on those who excel. The fact however\r\nis, that they are in many cases appropriated to particular counties,\r\nparishes, or names. The effect of the former system is to encourage\r\nstudies of secondary importance, at the expense of those which are\r\nentitled to preference. The effect of the latter is to encourage\r\ntotal idleness. It has been also asserted, that at some Colleges the\r\ndistributors of fellowships and scholarships have allowed themselves\r\nto be influenced by party spirit, or personal animosity. On this\r\npoint, however, we will not insist. We wish to expose the vices, not\r\nof individuals, but of the system. Indeed, in what we have hitherto\r\nwritten, we have generally had in our eye a College which exhibits that\r\nsystem in the most favourable light,--a College in which the evils which\r\nwe have noticed are as much as possible alleviated by an enlightened\r\nand liberal administration,--a College not less distinguished by its\r\nopulence and splendour, than by the eminent talents of many of its\r\nmembers, by the freedom and impartiality of its elections, by the\r\ndisposition which it has always shown to adopt improvements not\r\ninconsistent with its original constitution, and by the noble spirit\r\nwith which it has supported the cause of civil and religious liberty.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto reasoned as if all the students at our Universities\r\nlearnt those things which the Universities profess to teach. But this\r\nis, notoriously, not the fact--and the cause is evident. All who wish\r\nfor degrees must reside at College; but only those who expect to obtain\r\nprizes and fellowships apply themselves with vigour to classical and\r\nmathematical pursuits. The great majority have no inducement whatever\r\nto exert themselves. They have no hope of obtaining the premium; and\r\nno value for the knowledge without the premium. For the acquisition of\r\nother kinds of knowledge the Universities afford no peculiar facilities.\r\n\r\nHence {356}proceeds the general idleness of collegians. Not one in ten\r\nwe venture to say, ever makes any considerable proficiency in those\r\npursuits to which every thing else is sacrificed. A very large\r\nproportion carry away from the University less of ancient literature\r\nthan they brought thither. It is quite absurd to attribute such a state\r\nof tilings to the indolence and levity of youth. Nothing like it is\r\nseen elsewhere. There are idle lads, no doubt, among those who walk the\r\nhospitals, who sit at the desks of bankers, and serve at the counters of\r\ntradesmen. But what, after all, is the degree of _their_ idleness, and\r\nwhat proportion do they bear to those who are active? Is it not the most\r\ncommon thing in the world, to see men who have passed their time at\r\nCollege in mere trifling, display the greatest energy as soon as they\r\nenter on the business of life, and become profound lawyers, skilful\r\nphysicians, eminent writers? How can those things be explained, but\r\nby supposing that most of those who are compelled to reside at the\r\nUniversities have no motive to learn what is taught there? Who ever\r\nemployed a French master for four years without improving himself in\r\nFrench? The reason is plain. No man employs such a master, but from a\r\nwish to become acquainted with the language; and the same wish leads him\r\nto apply vigorously to it. Of those who go to our Universities, on the\r\nother hand, a large proportion are attracted, not by their desire to\r\nlearn the things studied there, but by their wish to acquire certain\r\nprivileges, which residence confers alike on the idle and on the\r\ndiligent. Try the same experiment with the French language. Erect the\r\nteachers of it into a corporation. Give them the power of conferring\r\ndegrees. Enact that no person who cannot produce a certificate,\r\nattesting that he has been for a certain number of years a student at\r\nthis academy, shall be suffered to keep a shop; and we will venture to\r\npredict, that there will soon be thousands, who, after having wasted\r\ntheir money and their time in a formal attendance on lectures and\r\nexaminations, will not understand the meaning of _Parlez-vous Français?_\r\n\r\nIt is the general course of those who patronise an abuse to attribute to\r\nit every thing good which exists in spite of it. Thus, the defenders of\r\nour Universities commonly take it for granted, that we are indebted to\r\nthem for all the talent which they have not been able to destroy. It is\r\nusual, when their merits {357}come under discussion, to enumerate very\r\npompously all the great men whom they have produced; as if great men had\r\nnot appeared under every system of education. Great men were trained\r\nin the schools of the Greek sophists and Arabian astrologers, of the\r\nJesuits and the Jansenists. There were great men when nothing was taught\r\nbut School Divinity and Canon Law; and there would still be great men\r\nif nothing were taught but the fooleries of Spurzheim and Swedenberg. A\r\nlong list of eminent names is no more a proof of the excellence of onr\r\nAcademic institutions, than the commercial prosperity of the country\r\nis a proof of the utility of restrictions in trade. No financial\r\nregulations, however absurd and pernicious, can prevent a people amongst\r\nwhom property is secure, and the motive to accumulate consequently\r\nstrong, from becoming rich. The energy with which every individual\r\nstruggles to advance, more than counteracts the retarding force, and\r\ncarries him forward, though at a slower rate, than if he were left at\r\nliberty. It is the same with restrictions which prevent the intellect\r\nfrom taking the direction which existing circumstances point out. They\r\ndo harm. But they cannot wholly prevent other causes from producing\r\ngood. In a country in which public opinion is powerful, in which talents\r\nproperly directed are sure to raise their professor to distinction,\r\nardent and aspiring minds will surmount all the obstacles which may\r\noppose their career. It is amongst persons who are engaged in public and\r\nprofessional life that genius is most likely to be developed. Of these a\r\nlarge portion is necessarily sent to our English Universities. It would,\r\ntherefore, be wonderful if the Universities could not boast of many\r\nconsiderable men. Yet, after all, we are not sure whether, if we were\r\nto pass in review the Houses of Parliament and the English and Scottish\r\nBar, the result of the investigation would be so favourable as is\r\ncommonly supposed to Oxford and Cambridge. And of this we are sure, that\r\nmany persons who, since they have risen to eminence, are perpetually\r\ncited as proofs of the beneficial tendency of English education, were\r\nat College never mentioned but as idle, frivolous men, fond of desultory\r\nreading, and negligent of the studies of the place. It would be.\r\nindelicate to name the living; but we may venture to speak more\r\nparticularly of the dead. It is truly curious to observe the use which\r\nis made in such discussions {358}as those, of names which we acknowledge\r\nto be glorious, but in which the Colleges have no reason to glory,--that\r\nof Bacon, who reprobated their fundamental constitution; of Dryden, who\r\nabjured his _Alma Muter_, and regretted that he had passed his youth\r\nunder her cure; of Locke, who was censured and expelled; of Milton,\r\nwhose person was outraged at one University, and whose works were\r\ncommitted to the flames at the other!\r\n\r\nThat in particular cases an University education may have produced\r\ngood effects, we do not dispute. But as to the great body of those\r\nwho receive it, we have no hesitation in saying, that their minds\r\npermanently suffer from it. All the time which they can devote to the\r\nacquisition of speculative knowledge is wasted, and they have to enter\r\ninto active life without it. They are compelled to plunge into the\r\ndetails of business, and are left to pick up general principles as they\r\nmay. From all that we have seen and heard, we are inclined to suspect,\r\nin spite of all our patriotic prejudices, that the young men, we mean\r\nthe very young men, of England, are not equal as a body to those of\r\nFrance, Germany, or Russia. They reason less justly, and the subjects\r\nwith which they are chiefly conversant are less manly. As they grow\r\nolder, they doubtless improve. Surrounded by a free people, enlightened\r\nby a free press, with the means of knowledge placed within their reach,\r\nand the rewards of exertion sparkling in their sight, it would indeed be\r\nstrange if they did not in a great measure recover the superiority which\r\nthey had lost. The finished men of England may, we allow, challenge a\r\ncomparison with those of any nation. Yet our advantages are not so\r\ngreat that we can afford to sacrifice any of them. We do not proceed so\r\nrapidly, that we can prudently imitate the example of Lightfoot in\r\nthe Nursery Tale, who never ran a race without tying his legs. The bad\r\neffects of our University system may be traced to the very last, in many\r\neminent and respectable men. They have acquired great skill in business,\r\nthey have laid up great stores of information. But something is still\r\nwanting. The superstructure is vast and splendid; but the foundations\r\nare unsound. It is evident that their knowledge is not systematised;\r\nthat, however well they may argue on particular points, they have not\r\nthat amplitude and intrepidity of intellect which it is the first object\r\nof education to produce. They hate abstract reasoning. {359}The very\r\nname of theory is terrible to them. They seem to think that the use of\r\nexperience is not to lead men to the knowledge of general principles,\r\nbut to prevent them from ever thinking about general principles at all.\r\nThey may play at bo-peep with truth; but they never get a full view\r\nof it in all its proportions. The cause we believe is, that they\r\nhave passed those years during which the mind frequently acquires\r\nthe character which it ever after retains, in studies, which, when\r\nexclusively pursued, have no tendency to strengthen or expand it.\r\n\r\nFrom these radical defects of the old foundations the London University\r\nis free. It cannot cry up one study or cry down another. It has no means\r\nof bribing one man to learn what it is of no use to him to know, or of\r\nexacting a mock attendance from another who learns nothing at all. To be\r\nprosperous, it must be useful.\r\n\r\nWe would not be too sanguine. But there are signs of these times, and\r\nprinciples of human nature, to which we trust as firmly as ever any\r\nancient astrologer trusted to the rules of his science. Judging from\r\nthese, we will venture to cast the horoscope of the infant Institution.\r\nWe predict, that the clamour by which it has been assailed will die\r\naway,--that it is destined to a long, a glorious, and a beneficent\r\nexistence,--that, while the spirit of its system remains unchanged, the\r\ndetails will vary with the varying necessities and facilities of every\r\nage,--that it will be the model of many future establishments--that even\r\nthose haughty foundations which now treat it with contempt, will in some\r\ndegree feel its salutary influence,--and that the approbation of a great\r\npeople, to whose wisdom, energy and virtue, its exertions will have\r\nlargely contributed, will confer on it a dignity more imposing than any\r\nwhich it could derive from the most lucrative patronage, or the most\r\nsplendid ceremonial.\r\n\r\nEven those who think our hopes extravagant, must own that no positive\r\nharm has been even suggested as likely to result from this Institution.\r\nAll the imputed sins of its founders are sins of omission. Whatever\r\nmay be thought of them, it is surely better that something should be\r\nomitted, than that nothing should be done. The Universities it can\r\ninjure in one way only--by surpassing them. This danger no sincere\r\nadmirer of these bodies can apprehend. As for those who, believing that\r\nthe project really tends to the good of {360}the country, continue to\r\nthrow obloquy upon it--and that there are such men we believe--to them\r\nwe have nothing to say. We have no hope of converting them; no wish\r\nto revile them. Let them quibble, declaim, sneer, calumniate. Their\r\npunishment is to be what they are.\r\n\r\nFor us, our part has been deliberately chosen--and shall be manfully\r\nsustained. We entertain a firm conviction that the principles of\r\nliberty, as in government and trade, so also in education, are\r\nall-important to the happiness of mankind. To the triumph of those\r\nprinciples we look forward, not, we trust, with a fanatical confidence,\r\nbut assuredly with a cheerful and steadfast hope. Their nature may be\r\nmisunderstood. Their progress may be retarded. They may be maligned,\r\nderided, nay at times exploded, and apparently forgotten. But we do,\r\nin our souls, believe that they are strong with the strength, and quick\r\nwith the vitality of truth; that when they fall, it is to rebound; that\r\nwhen they recede, it is to spring forward with greater elasticity; that\r\nwhen they seem to perish, there are the seeds of renovation in their\r\nvery decay--and that their influence will continue to bless distant\r\ngenerations, when infamy itself shall have ceased to rescue from\r\noblivion the arts and the names of those who have opposed them, the\r\ndupe, the dissembler, the bigot, the hireling--the buffoon and the\r\nsarcasm, the liar and the he!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CAPACITIES OP NEGROES. (1)\r\n\r\n(_Edinburgh Review_, March, 1827.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt {361}was not till a short time back that we entertained the\r\nslightest intention of criticising the speculations of Major Moody. We\r\nhad supposed that they would of course pass in their infancy to that\r\nLimbo which is ordained for Laureate Odes, old Court Kalendars, and\r\nSermons printed at the request of Congregations. That a Commissioner\r\nshould write a dull Report, and that the Government should give him a\r\nplace for it, are events by no means so rare as to call for notice. Of\r\nlate, however, we have with great surprise discovered, that the books of\r\nthe Major have been added to the political canon of Downing-Street,\r\nand that it has become quite a fashion among statesmen who are still\r\nin their novitiate, to talk about physical causes and the philosophy\r\nof labour. As the doctrines which, from some inexplicable cause, have\r\nacquired so much popularity, appear to us both false and pernicious,\r\nwe shall attempt, with as much brevity as possible, to expose their\r\nabsurdity.\r\n\r\nThere are stars, it is said, of which the light has not yet travelled\r\nthrough the space that separates them from the eye of man; and it is\r\npossible that the blaze of glory which dazzles all the young politicians\r\nbetween Charing-Cross and Westminster Hall may not yet have reached our\r\nmore\r\n\r\n     (1) Art.

Ordered by the\r\n     House of Commons to be printed, 24th February 1820.\r\n\r\nremote {362}readers. In order, therefore, that our remarks on the Report\r\nof Major Moody may he clearly understood, we shall give a short account\r\nof the circumstances under which it appeared.\r\n\r\nBy the Act which abolished the trade in slaves, the King was empowered\r\nto make regulations for the employment and support of Negroes, who,\r\nunder the provisions of that Act, or in the course of hostilities with\r\nforeign States, might be rescued from their kidnappers. Some of these\r\nliberated Africans were, in consequence, admitted into the army and the\r\nnavy. Others were bound apprentices in the colonies: and of these last\r\nmany were settled at Tortola.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1821, the House of Commons presented an address to the King,\r\nrequesting that commissioners might be sent to ascertain the condition\r\nof these people, and to report it to the Government. Major Moody\r\nwas selected for this purpose by the Colonial Office. Mr. Dougan, a\r\ngentleman to whose talents and integrity the Major bears the highest\r\ntestimony, was joined with him in the commission. But Mr. Dougan,\r\nwhatever his good qualities may have been, was under the influence of\r\nsome unhappy prejudices, from which his colleague appears to have been\r\nwholly free, he had been led to adopt the extravagant notion that the\r\nAfricans were his fellow-creatures; and this delusion betrayed him into\r\nerrors which Major Moody, to his eternal honour, endeavours to palliate,\r\nbut which a less candid and amiable censor would have stigmatized with\r\nthe severest reprehension. Our readers will be shocked to hear that an\r\nEnglish gentleman actually desired a black apprentice, during a long\r\nexamination, to take a seat! and they will be touched by the delicacy\r\nand generosity of the Major, who mentions this disgrace! ill occurrence\r\n“only,” as he says, “to show the bias on the mind of his colleague when\r\none of the African race was concerned with a white person.” (1)\r\n\r\nAt length some female Africans in the service of a person named Maclean,\r\nwere brought before the Commissioners. By their statement, and by the\r\nconfession of the master himself, it appeared that they had been cruelly\r\ntreated. Maclean, too, it appeared, had no legal right to them: for they\r\nhad been originally apprenticed to another person, and the\r\n\r\n     (1) First Part of Major Moody’s Report, page 103.\r\n\r\nindentures {363}had never been transferred. Mr. Dougan thought it\r\ndesirable to take advantage of this circumstance, and at once to place\r\nthem in a more comfortable situation; and he prevailed on his\r\ncolleague to concur with him in recommending the case to the particular\r\nconsideration of the collector. In the mean time, however, Maclean wrote\r\nto the Commissioners, requesting them to revise their proceedings, and\r\nmost impudently telling them, at the same time, _that he had whipped the\r\napprentices with tamarind switches for daring to bear evidence against\r\nhim!_ Mr. Dougan seems to have imagined that such conduct was grossly\r\ninsulting to the Commissioners, and to the government which employed\r\nthem. He probably thought, too, that to re-examine persons who had been\r\nflogged for what they had stated on a former examination, would be to\r\nviolate every principle of equity and reason. On this point, it Appears\r\nthat Major Moody was of a different opinion; and conceived that truth\r\nwas likely enough to be obtained from a witness who had just learned\r\nthat if his evidence be disagreeable to the accused party, he will\r\nundergo severe chastisement. A rupture took place. The apprentices, we\r\nshould perhaps say the slaves, remained with Maclean; and Mr. Dougan\r\nreturned to England.\r\n\r\nBut we really cannot continue to speak ironically on a subject so\r\nserious. We do earnestly and gravely assure Major Moody, that we think\r\nhis conduct, on this occasion, most unjust and unreasonable. Lord\r\nBathurst seems to have entertained the same opinion: For in consequence\r\nof orders sent out from England, the wretched women were taken from\r\nMaclean and apprenticed to another master.\r\n\r\nMr. Dougan now returned to the West Indies; and the disputes between him\r\nand his colleague recommenced. At length both were recalled. Mr. Dougan\r\ndrew up a report of the proceedings under the commission. The Major\r\nrefused to concur in it, and presented a separate statement in answer to\r\nit. Mr. Dougan, while labouring under a fatal malady, prepared a reply.\r\nThis document has, since his death, been transmitted to the Colonial\r\nOffice, and will, of course, be published with all expedition.\r\n\r\nMr. Dougan thought it sufficient to perform the duty with which he was\r\ncharged. His report is therefore, what it professes to be, an account\r\nof the condition of the liberated Africans. {364}But the genius of the\r\nMajor was not to be confined within limits so narrow. He had command,\r\nwithout stint, of the public paper and the publie type. He conceived\r\nthat the opportunity was not to be lost--that now or never was the time\r\nto be a philosopher like his neighbours, and to have a system of his\r\nown, which might be called after his name. The history of the liberated\r\nAfricans forms, therefore, a mere episode in his plan. His report is, in\r\nsubstance, a defence of West Indian slavery, on certain new principles,\r\nwhich constitute what he is pleased to call the Philosophy of Labour.\r\n\r\nHis theory has met with a very flattering reception from those who\r\nare favourably inclined to the Colonial system, because they dread\r\ninnovation, because they hate the saints, or because they have mortgages\r\non West Indian plantations. Unable themselves to defend their opinion,\r\nbut obstinately determined not to renounce it, they are pleased with a\r\nwriter who abounds in phrases which sound as if they meant something,\r\nand which, in the chat of a drawing-room, or in the leading article of a\r\nnewspaper, supply the place of a reason very creditably.\r\n\r\nWe come to the consideration of the Report with no such bias upon our\r\nminds, and we have, therefore, formed a very different estimate of it.\r\nWe think that it is, in matter and manner, the worst state-paper that we\r\never saw. The style is the jargon of a tenth-rate novelist, engrafted\r\non that of a tenth-rate pamphleteer. It abounds with that vague diction\r\nwhich the political winters of France have invented, and by which they\r\noften contrive to keep up appearances in spite of the most abject mental\r\npoverty. At certain distances, and in certain lights, this paltry\r\nand pinchbeck logic serves its purpose respectably; and to this,\r\nunquestionably, the Major owes the greater part of his reputation. The\r\nhighest compliment which we can, with any sincerity, pay to him, is to\r\nsay, that he has some faults in common with Montesquieu--a writer whom\r\nhe evidently regards with great admiration. He calls one of the silliest\r\nremarks of the lively president profound--an epithet which would have\r\namazed us if we had not recollected that the terms in which we describe\r\nmagnitudes, whether material or intellectual, are only relative,--that\r\nthe Grildrig of Brobdignag may be the Quinbus Flestrin of Lilliput. The\r\ntheories of Montesquieu are gone where the {365}theories of the Major\r\nwill soon go. But though Montesquieu could not keep his doctrines alive,\r\nhe understood how to embalm them. Their mummies are beyond all price.\r\nThe mouldering remains are valued, for the sake of the intricate folds\r\nin which they are swathed up, the sweet and pungent spices with which\r\nthey are seasoned, and the gilded hieroglyphics with which they are\r\nemblazoned. The Major has no such skill. Abundance of italics, and\r\noccasional flowers of speech from the Emmelines and Adelines of the\r\nMinerva Press, are the only ornaments which set off his speculations. If\r\nour object were to render him ridiculous, we could easily fill our\r\npages with solecisms, with affected phrases, with sentences of which\r\nthe obscurity would leave the most sagacious interpreter at a fault. But\r\nthis is not our intention. We shall direct our attacks against the great\r\nprinciples of his theory. To find these out, indeed, is no easy task.\r\nFor the work has neither beginning nor end. The author, instead of\r\ntaking the trouble to state his propositions, and class his arguments\r\nfor himself, has left the whole of that task to his opponents, and\r\nhas made it as difficult as possible by the most elaborate artifice of\r\ndisorder. We shall do our best, however, to perform it faithfully,\r\nand to separate the most important passages from much curious matter\r\nconcerning the feudal system--the chisel of Phidias--the marriage in\r\nCana of Galilee--the difference between Theory and Practice--the choice\r\nof Hercules--the peace and happiness of rural life--the rape of the\r\nSabines--the Supreme Being--and Major Moody himself.\r\n\r\nThe first great principle, then, which the Major professes to have\r\ndiscovered is this, that there exists between the White and Black races\r\nan instinctive and unconquerable aversion, which must forever frustrate\r\nall hopes of seeing them unite in one society on equal terms. We\r\nshall consider in succession the facts from which he draws this bold\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nBy the constitution of Hayti, it seems, no white man of any nation can\r\nbe a master or proprietor in that island. From this circumstance the\r\nMajor deduces the following inferences.\r\n\r\n“_It seems as if each party, when in power, acts as if it was mutually\r\nthought the two races could not exist together, in the same community,\r\nwith equal political powers, from the operation of some powerful causes,\r\n{366}which do not appear to have been felt in England in former ages,\r\nwhen lier inhabitants were composed of freemen and slaves, or when\r\nnational distinctions among people living in the same country formed a\r\npolitical barrier between Britons and Romans, or Saxons and Normans.”_(1)\r\n\r\nMoreover a young Haytian, named Moyse, about thirty years ago,\r\ncomplained of the attention which Toussaint Louvertu re paid to the\r\ninterests of the Europeans, and declared that he should never like the\r\nwhites till they should restore to him the eye which he had lost in\r\nbattle, with them! This last important anecdote, the Major prints in\r\nitalics, as quite decisive. (2) The poor Haytian must have been best\r\nacquainted with the origin of his own feelings; and, as he ascribed them\r\nto a cause which might well account for them, it is difficult to divine\r\nwhy any other should be assigned. The liberality of Toussaint, also, is\r\nat least as strong an argument against the hypothesis of Major Moody, as\r\nthe animosity of Moyse can be in its favour.\r\n\r\nFrom the law which declares white men incapable of becoming proprietors\r\nin Hayti, nothing can be inferred. Such prohibitions are exceedingly\r\nfoolish; but they have existed, as every person knows who knows any\r\nthing of history, in cases where no natural antipathy can be supposed to\r\nhave produced them. We need not refer to the measures which the Kings of\r\nSpain adopted against their Moorish subjects--to that tyranny of nation\r\nover nation which has, in every age, been the curse of Asia--or to the\r\njealous policy which excludes strangers, of all races, from the interior\r\nof China and Japan. Our own country will furnish an example strictly in\r\npoint. By the common law of England, no alien whatever can hold\r\nland, even as a tenant. The natives of Scotland remained under this\r\nincapacity, till the two divisions of the island were united under James\r\nthe First: and even then, the national prejudice was strong against the\r\nremoval of the disability. The House of Commons was decidedly averse\r\nto it. The Court, in consequence, had recourse to a measure grossly\r\nunconstitutional. The Judges were persuaded to _declare_ that to be law\r\nwhich the Parliament could not be persuaded to _make_ law; and even thus\r\nit was found impossible to remove the restriction from Scotchmen born\r\nbefore the Union of the Crowns.\r\n\r\n     (1) Major Moody’s Second Report, p. 29.\r\n\r\n     (2) Ibid. p. 45.\r\n\r\nThe {367}Major ought to be well acquainted with these proceedings. For\r\nLord Bacon, of whom he professes himself a disciple, appeared as counsel\r\nfor the post-nati. It is amusing to consider what the feelings of that\r\nillustrious man would have been, if some half-taught smatterer of his\r\nphilosophy had risen to oppose him with such arguments as these. “The\r\nEnglish can never amalgamate with any foreign nation. The existence\r\nand the popularity of such a law as this sufficiently prove that\r\nsome powerful cause operates upon our countrymen, which does not act\r\nelsewhere. Our ancestors always felt that, although in other countries\r\nforeigners may be permitted and even encouraged by the natives to settle\r\namong them, no such mixture could take place here. I have been credibly\r\ninformed also, that a Scotchman whose eye was struck out in a fray\r\nforty years back, swore that he never could bear the sight of a Southern\r\nafter.” With what a look would Sir Francis have risen to annihilate such\r\nan argument! What mirth would have shone in his eyes! What unsavoury\r\nsimilitudes would have risen to his lips! With what confusion would the\r\ndabbler in experimental science have shrunk from a conflict with that\r\nall-embracing and all-penetrating mind, which fancy had elevated but\r\nnot inebriated, which professional study had rendered subtle, but could\r\nnot render narrow. As the Major seems very willing to be an experimental\r\nphilosopher, if he knew how to set about it, we will give him one\r\ngeneral rule, of which he seems never to have heard. It is this. When\r\nthe phenomena can be explained by circumstances which, on grounds\r\ndistinct from those phenomena, we know to exist, we must not resort\r\nto hypothetical solutions. We are not entitled to attribute the hatred\r\nwhich the Haytian Blacks may have felt towards the Whites to any latent\r\nphysical cause, till we have shown that the ordinary principles of human\r\nnature will not explain it. Is it not natural, then, that men should\r\nhate those by whom they have been held in slavery, and to whom they have\r\nsubsequently been opposed in a war of peculiar ferocity? Is it not also\r\nperfectly agreeable to that law of association, from which so large a\r\nportion of our pains and pleasures is derived, that what we have long\r\nregarded as a distinguishing badge of those whom we hate should itself\r\nbecome hateful to us? If these questions be answered in the affirmative,\r\nthe aversion {368}which the Haytian Negroes are said to entertain\r\ntowards the Whites is at once explained.\r\n\r\nThe same remark applies to all that the Major has said respecting the\r\nstate of public feeling in North America. The facts of the case he has\r\nstated quite correctly. It is true that, even in those States of the\r\nUnion which have abolished slavery, the free Blacks are still regarded\r\nwith disgust and contempt. The most benevolent inhabitants of New\r\nEngland and New York, conceive that liberty itself will scarcely be a\r\nblessing to the African, unless measures be taken for removing him to\r\nsome country where he may not be reminded of his inferiority by daily\r\ninsults and privations. Hence Major Moody thought himself, as he tells\r\nus,--“_justified in the inference, that some powerful causes must be\r\nin action, and that those of a physical nature had not been overcome by\r\nmere legal exactments_.” (1)\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that some powerful cause has been in action. But\r\nthat it is a physical cause, is not quite so clear. The old laws have no\r\ndoubt produced a state of public feeling, which their repeal cannot at\r\nonce correct. In all the States the Negro colour _has been_ the livery\r\nof servitude. In some it still _is_ so. The connexion between the\r\ndifferent commonwealths of the confederation is so close, that the state\r\nof feeling in one place must be influenced by the state of the laws\r\nin another. This consideration is surely sufficient to explain all the\r\ncircumstances to which the Major refers. It is for him to show, that an\r\naversion for which _slavery_ alone will sufficiently account is really\r\nthe effect of _blackness_. He would, we believe, find it as easy to\r\nprove that there is something _naturally_ and universally loathsome in\r\nthe cut and colour of a prison uniform.\r\n\r\nThat the complexion of the free African renders his condition more\r\nunfortunate, we acknowledge. But why does it produce this effect? Not,\r\nsurely, because _it is_ the degrading circumstance, but because it\r\nis clear, instantaneous, and irrefragable _evidence_ of the degrading\r\ncircumstance. It is the only brand which cannot be counterfeited, and\r\nwhich cannot be effaced. It is borne by slaves and their descendants;\r\nand it is borne by no others. Let the Major prove, that, in any society\r\nwhere personal bondage has never existed, the\r\n\r\n     (1) Second Part of Major Moody’s Report, p. 27.\r\n\r\nwhites {369}and blacks have felt this mutual dislike. Till he can show\r\nthis, he does nothing.\r\n\r\nBut, it seems, an anonymous writer in South America, some years ago,\r\ndeclared, that the blacks never could amalgamate with the whites. (1)\r\nThat a man who had passed his life among negro _slaves_ should transfer\r\nto their colour the feelings of contempt with which he regarded their\r\ncondition, and the mean vices to which that condition necessarily gave\r\nbirth, was perfectly natural. That he should suppose a feeling, of which\r\nhe could not remember the origin, to be instinctive, was also natural.\r\nThe most profound thinkers have fallen into similar errors. But that\r\na man in England should believe all this, only because a man at Bogota\r\nchose to write it, argues a strange degree of credulity. Such vague\r\nauthority is not sufficient to establish a fact. To quote it in support\r\nof a general proposition, is an insult to common sense. The expressions\r\nof this Columbian prove only, what the refusal of the Major to let a\r\nnegro sit in his presence proves as satisfactorily, that there are very\r\nweak and very prejudiced people in the world.\r\n\r\nFeelings exactly similar to those which are unhappily so common among\r\nthe whites of the United States, have often existed in cases where it is\r\nimpossible to attribute them to physical causes. From a time beyond the\r\nresearches of historians, an impassable gulf has separated the Brahmin\r\nfrom the Paria. The Jews were long regarded by the Spaniards and\r\nPortuguese with as much contempt and hatred as the white North American\r\nfeels for the man of colour. The cases, indeed, are strikingly similar.\r\nThe national features and rites of the Hebrews, like the black skin and\r\nwoolly hair of the Africans, visibly distinguished them from the rest of\r\nthe community. Every individual of the race bore about him the badges\r\nof the synagogue. Baptism itself could not wash away the distinction.\r\nConversion might save him from the flames; but the stigma was\r\nindelible--he bore it to the grave--he bequeathed it to his\r\nchildren--his descendants, as long as their genealogy could be traced,\r\nwere objects of scorn to the poorest Castilian peasant, who gloried in\r\nthe name of an old Christian.\r\n\r\nBut we will not multiply examples in a case so plain. We hasten to\r\nanother argument, on which Major Moody\r\n\r\n     (1) Second Part of Major Moody’s Report, p. 23. 24\r\n\r\ndwells {370}with peculiar complacency. At this, indeed, we do not much\r\nwonder. It is entirely his own. He is the first writer who ever used\r\nit, and we venture to prophesy that he will be the last. We speak of\r\nhis remarks on the influence of the sexual passion. We will give his own\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n“_In such committees as I have referred to, an observer will not fail to\r\ndiscover the want of a certain class of sympathies, which are daily seen\r\nin action when men of the same race live together, even in republics,\r\nlike the United States of America, although a portion of the community\r\nconsisted of men of different nations and habits, but yet resembling\r\neach other in external form, colour, features, &c.\r\n\r\n“I allude to the extraordinary rarity of virtuous unions having taken\r\nplace between the males and females of the pure Negroes and the pure\r\nWhites in America. I certainly have heard of such unions as in certain\r\nclasses of society are seen in London; but in America, they were\r\nconsidered rather as very extraordinary occurrences, particularly if the\r\nmale should be a pure negro, and the female a pure white. On the other\r\nhand, when the female is an African, lust, aided by fear or avarice, has\r\noften led to an illicit union between the sexes....\r\n\r\n“In the New World of America, virtuous unions between the extreme\r\ncolours of black and white are always considered something in violation\r\nof the ordinary sympathies which spring from a pure affection, and\r\ntherefore derogatory to the feelings of caste; for even the free\r\ncoloured females, I understand, would have a reluctance, if advanced in\r\ncivilization, to form a virtuous union with a pure negro....\r\n\r\n“Some of the intelligent free negroes of the United States, with whom I\r\noften conversed, for the express purpose of personal observation, felt\r\nthe ban under which they were put, by the influence of prejudice, as\r\nthey considered it, after the laws of the country had declared\r\nthem free, and equal to any other citizen of the State; and, in the\r\nconfidence inspired by my inquiries about their situation, I was often\r\nasked if, in England, white women did not marry black men? And, with\r\napparent simplicity, it was inquired why the American white women were\r\nso prejudiced against black men?...\r\n\r\n“Those who merely refer the degraded state of the free Africans or\r\nblacks to their having been formerly slaves, and leave out of their\r\nconsideration the consequences arising from physical differences in\r\nform, colour, feature, and smell, influencing those general ideas of\r\nbeauty, creating that passion of love that most commonly leads to a\r\nvirtuous union of the sexes of different nations, must be considered\r\nas having taken a very narrow view of the question, from the prevalent\r\ncustom of merely referring to moral causes alone, and omitting all\r\nreferences to those of a physical nature, though still more powerful in\r\ntheir effect._” (1)\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary argument is concluded by a touching representation of\r\nthe refinement which modesty gives to pleasure, and of the happiness\r\nof being cherished and beloved, which, we hope, will edify the young\r\ngentlemen of the\r\n\r\n     (1) Second Part of Major Moody’s Report, pages 19 and 20.\r\n\r\nColonial {371}Office, but which has, we think, little to do with the\r\nquestion. This, therefore, we omit, as well as the pious appeal to the\r\nGod of Truth, which follows it.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that the Major does not perceive how directly all his\r\nstatement leads towards a conclusion, diametrically opposite to that at\r\nwhich, by some inconceivable process, he has managed to arrive? We will\r\ngive him an answer. But we really hope that he is the only one of our\r\nreaders who will need it.\r\n\r\nThe passion of the sexes is a natural appetite. Marriage is a civil and\r\nreligious institution. Where, therefore, between two classes of people,\r\nthe passion exists, but marriage is not practised, it is evident that\r\nnature impels them to unite, and that acquired feelings only keep them\r\nasunder.\r\n\r\nNow, Major Moody just reverses this mode of reasoning. Because the\r\nWhites form with the Blacks those illicit unions, to which the motive is\r\nphysical, but do not form those legitimate unions to which the motive\r\nis moral, he actually infers that the cause which separates the races\r\nis not moral, but physical! In the same manner, we presume, he would\r\nmaintain, that a man who dines heartily without saying grace, is\r\ndeficient, not in devotion, but in appetite.\r\n\r\nThe story which he tells respecting the free blacks, with whom he\r\nconversed in the United States, is alone sufficient to show the\r\nabsurdity of his hypothesis. From his own account, it is plain that\r\nthese blacks had no antipathy to white women. The repugnance was all on\r\none side. And on which side? On that of the privileged class, of those\r\nwhose superiority was till lately recognised by law, and is still\r\nestablished by custom. Is this a phenomenon so extraordinary that we\r\nmust have recourse to a new instinct to account for it? Or may it not\r\nbe explained into the same causes which in England prevent a lady from\r\nmarrying a tinker, though the tinker would gladly marry the lady?\r\n\r\nIn the last century, the dissipated nobles of France lavished their\r\nwealth with the wildest profusion on actresses and opera girls. The\r\nfavour of a distinguished heroine of this class, was thought to be\r\ncheaply purchased at the price of jewels, gilded coaches, palaces\r\nblazing with mirrors, or even of some drops of aristocratic blood. Yet\r\nthe poorest gentleman in the kingdom would not have married Clairon.\r\nThis, Major Moody would say, proves that men who wear swords, feather,\r\n{372}and red-heeled shoes, entertain a natural aversion to women who\r\nrecite verses out of Andromaque and Tartuffe. _We_ think that we could\r\nhit on a different explanation.\r\n\r\nIt happed, indeed, rather unluckily, that, of the phenomena which the\r\nMajor recounts, there is none which cannot be satisfactorily explained\r\ninto moral cause, and none which can possibly be explained into\r\nphysical causes. White women, says he, much more rarely form licentious\r\nconnections with black men, than white men with black women. And this is\r\na proof that the aversion of the two races is natural. Why, if it were\r\nnatural, does it not influence both sexes alike? The principles to\r\nwhich these facts must be referred, are principles which we see in daily\r\noperation among ourselves. Men of the highest rank in our country, are\r\nfrequently engaged in low amours. The wife or daughter of an English\r\ngentleman very seldom forgets herself so far. But who ever thought of\r\nattributing this to physical causes?\r\n\r\nThe Major, however, is resolved not to leave himself unrefuted in\r\nany point. “Even the free coloured females,” says he, “would have a\r\nreluctance, if advanced in civilization, to form a virtuous union with\r\na pure negro.” He cannot pretend to believe that any physical cause\r\noperates here: and, indeed, distinctly attributes the reluctance of the\r\ncoloured female to her advancement in civilization. That is to say,\r\nhe distinctly acknowledges that certain acquired habits, and certain\r\nadvantages of rank and education, are alone sufficient to produce those\r\neffects which, according to his own theory laid down in the same page,\r\ncan only result from natural organization.\r\n\r\nThe Major tells us, the colour, the features, and the other\r\npeculiarities of the black race, excite the disgust of Europeans. Here\r\nhis testimony is at variance with that of almost all the writers on\r\nthe subject with whom we are acquainted. Travellers and historians\r\ninnumerable, have asserted, that white men in the torrid zone,\r\ngenerally prefer black females to those of their own country, Raynal,\r\nif we remember rightly, gives a very rational explanation of the\r\ncircumstance. It is needless, however, to attack the Major with\r\nauthorities from other writers. He may easily be refuted out of his own\r\nmouth. How can the physical peculiarities of {373}the African race be\r\nmore offensive in the wife than in the concubine? It is quite needless\r\nto inquire into the origin of the different opinions which people, in\r\ndifferent situations, form on the subject of beauty. It is quite enough\r\nfor us at present to discover, that if a man does not think a woman too\r\nugly to make her his mistress, it cannot surely be on account of her\r\nugliness that he does not make her his wife.\r\n\r\nIn England white women not unfrequently marry black men. We have\r\nourselves known several such instances. Yet if the external appearance\r\nof the negro were such as naturally to inspire aversion, that feeling\r\nwould be more strongly excited in a country of which the inhabitants are\r\nnot familiarized by use to the revolting spectacle. This consideration\r\nalone would satisfy us that the real cause of the horror with which the\r\nWhites in some other countries shrink from the thought of marriage with\r\nan African is to be found, not in physical, but in political and moral\r\ncircumstances. We entertain little doubt, that when the laws which\r\ncreate a distinction between the races shall be completely abolished, a\r\nvery few generations will mitigate the prejudices which those laws have\r\ncreated, and which they still maintain. At that time, the black girl,\r\nwho, as a slave, would have attracted a white lover, will, when her\r\nfather has given her a good education, and can leave her a hundred\r\nthousand dollars, find no difficulty in procuring a white husband.\r\n\r\nWe have perhaps dwelt too long on the feeble and inconsistent arguments\r\nwhich the Major has urged in support of his hypothesis. But we were\r\ndesirous, before we entered on that part of his work which relates to\r\nquestions of more difficulty, to furnish our readers with a specimen of\r\nhis logical powers. They will perhaps be inclined to suspect, that a man\r\nwho reasons thus on one subject, is not very likely to reason justly on\r\nany.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the second great principle which Major Moody conceives\r\nhimself to have established. It may be stated thus. The inhabitants\r\nof countries lying within the torrid zone ean be induced to engage in\r\nsteady agricultural labour only by necessity. The barrenness of the\r\nsoil, or the density of the population, may create that necessity. In\r\nHindostan, for example, the peasant must work or starve. But where a few\r\ninhabitants are thinly scattered over the {374}country, they will\r\nbe able to procure a subsistence with very little exertion. With a\r\nsubsistence they will be content. The heat renders agricultural\r\nlabour so painful that those who are their own masters will prefer the\r\nenjoyment of repose to any of the comforts which they might be able to\r\nprocure by regular industry. For this evil the only remedy is coercion,\r\nor, in other words, slavery. Such are the elements of the new philosophy\r\nof labour.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether these doctrines, if admitted, would amount to\r\na vindication of slavery. It does not appear to us quite certain that\r\nwe are justified in compelling our fellow-creatures to engage in\r\na particular employment, merely because that employment gives them\r\nexquisite pain. If a large portion of the human race be really placed in\r\nregions where rest and shade are the most delightful luxuries which they\r\ncan enjoy, a benevolent man may perhaps be of opinion that they ought to\r\nbe suffered to doze in their huts, except when necessity may drive\r\nthem to employ an occasional hour in angling, gathering berries, or\r\nscattering a little rice in the marshes. We are entitled to demand that\r\nthis point shall be saved to us; but we do not foresee that we shall\r\nneed it. We assert, and will prove, that Major Moody has not established\r\nhis theory; that he has not even raised a presumption in its favour; and\r\nthat the tacts on which he relies are either such as have no relation to\r\nthe question, or such as occur daily in every climate of the globe.\r\n\r\nWe will begin with the case with which Major Moody would have done\r\nwell both to begin and end--the case of the liberated Africans who were\r\nplaced in Tortola. We must premise, that no experiment was ever made\r\nunder circumstances less favourable. The Negroes, when received from\r\nthe holds of the slave ships, were in a state of extreme weakness and\r\ndisease. Of six hundred and seventeen Blacks who were taken from the\r\nVenus and the Manuella, two hundred and twenty-two died before they\r\ncould be settled as apprentices. (1) The constitutions of many who\r\nsurvived were completely broken. By the masters to whom they were\r\napprenticed, they were frequently treated with inhumanity. The laws and\r\ninstitutions of Tortola, framed for\r\n\r\n     (1) Mr. Dougan’s Report, p. 7.\r\n\r\na {375}society made up of masters and slaves, were, as the Major himself\r\nstates, by no means fitted for the regulation of such a class of persons\r\nas the apprenticed Africans. The poorer freemen of every colour felt an\r\nenmity towards people who were about to intrude themselves into those\r\ntrades of which they possessed a monopoly. The planters were not\r\ninclined to look with favour on the first fruits of the abolition.\r\nApprentices are, in every part of the world, noted for idleness. The\r\ndegree of that idleness is in general proportioned to the length of\r\nthe term for which they are bound to an unrequited service. The man who\r\nexpects soon to be his own master, may exert himself to acquire skill\r\nin the business by which he is to subsist. He, on the other hand, who\r\nexpects to waste half of his life in labour without remuneration, will\r\ngenerally do as little as he possibly can. The liberated Africans were\r\nmost injudiciously apprenticed for fourteen years, and some even for a\r\nlonger time. They had neither the motive of the freeman, nor that of the\r\nslave. They could not legally demand wages. They could not legally be\r\nsubjected to the driver. Under these disadvantages was the trial made.\r\nAnd what was the result?\r\n\r\nMajor Moody examined into the conduct of sixty-one apprenticed negroes\r\nwho had been rescued from the Manuella. The masters and mistresses were\r\ncarefully interrogated. It appears from the schedules signed by the\r\nMajor himself, that good characters were given to forty, and only\r\nappeared to be idle and disorderly. With respect to twelve, no decisive\r\ninformation was obtained. A similar inquiry took place respecting\r\nfifty-five apprentices who had formed a part of the cargo of the Venus.\r\nGood accounts were received of forty. Only six were described as idle\r\nand disorderly.\r\n\r\nAmong sixty-five negroes who had been taken from the Candelario, there\r\nwas not a single instance of grossly bad conduct. Fifty-seven received\r\nfair characters for honesty and industry.\r\n\r\nLastly, of one hundred and ten negroes who had been on board of the\r\nAtrevido, only four are characterized as decidedly worthless. Nine may\r\nbe considered as doubtful. A favourable report is given of the remaining\r\nninety-seven.\r\n\r\nThese facts, as we have said, we find in the papers signed by the Major\r\nhimself. He has not, it is true, thought it necessary {376}to give us\r\nthe result of his inquiries in the Report so compendiously as we now\r\nexhibit it. He dwells at great length on particular cases which prove\r\nnothing. He fills page after page with the nonsense of planters who had\r\nno apprentices, who evidently knew nothing about the apprentices,\r\nand who, in general terms, proving nothing but their own\r\nmalevolence, characterized the whole race as idle, disorderly,\r\nquarrelsome, drunken, greedy. But, from the beginning to the end of the\r\nReport, he has not been able to spare three lines for the simple fact,\r\nthat four fifths of these vilified people receive excellent characters\r\nfrom their actual employers, from those who must have been best\r\nacquainted with their disposition, and who would have lost most by their\r\nidleness. Whoever wishes to know how Daniel Quabott broke his wife’s\r\nnose--how Penelope glum whipped a slave who had the yaws, how the Major,\r\nseventeen years ago, went without his supper in Guiana--how the arts and\r\nsciences proceeded northward from Carthage till they were stopped by the\r\nfrozen zone, may find in the Report all this interesting information,\r\nand much more of the same kind. But those who wish to know that which\r\nMajor Moody was commissioned to ascertain, and which it was his peculiar\r\nduty to state, must turn over three hundred folio pages of schedules.\r\nThe Report does not, as far as we have been able to discover, give the\r\nmost distant hint of the discoveries which they will make there.\r\n\r\nWe have no idea of charging the Major with intentional unfairness. But\r\nhis prejudices really seem to have blinded him as to the effect of the\r\nevidence which he had himself collected. He hints that his colleague had\r\nprivately prepared the apprentices for the examination. Of the justice\r\nof this charge we shall be better able to judge when the answer of Mr.\r\nDougan shall make its appearance. But be it well founded or not, it\r\ncannot affect _our_ argument. The Major does not pretend to insinuate,\r\nthat any arts were practised with _the masters_, and it is on the\r\ntestimony of the masters alone that we are willing to rest onr case.\r\nIndeed, the evidence which was collected by the Major in the absence of\r\nhis colleague, and which we must therefore suppose to be perfectly pure,\r\ntends to the same effect, and would alone be sufficient to show, that\r\nthe apprentices have, as a body, conducted themselves in a manner which,\r\nunder any circumstances, would have been most satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIt {377}is perfectly true, that a knot of slave-owners, forming the\r\nlegislature of Tortola, petitioned the Government to remove these\r\napprentices from the island. From internal evidence, from the peculiar\r\ncant in which the petition abounds, and from the sprinkling of bad\r\ngrammar which adorns it, we are half inclined to suspect that it is\r\nthe Major’s own handywork. At all events, it is curious to see how\r\nhe reasons on it. It is curious to see how the Major reasons on this\r\nfact:--\r\n\r\n“_Doubtless, the legislature of Tortola may be mistaken in their\r\nopinions; but the mere fact of their agreeing to sign such a petition,\r\nshows they really did think, that the labour of the African apprentices,\r\nwhen free, would not be useful to them or the colonists generally.\r\n\r\n“And this fact alone, my Lord, is calculated to excite important\r\nreflections, as to the character of the free Africans, for industry in\r\nWest Indian agriculture.\r\n\r\n“Is it probable, that mere prejudice against the colour of a man’s skin\r\ncould ever induce anybody of people, like the Tortola petitioners, to\r\nmake a request so apparently absurd, as that of removing from their\r\ncolony a numerous body of Africans, consisting of able bodied men and\r\nwomen, If they were as willing as they were capable of working, and\r\nincreasing the value of the land now given to pasturage, for want of\r\ncultivators to be employed therein._” (1)\r\n\r\nWe earnestly request our readers to observe the consistency of Major\r\nMoody. When his object is to prove, that whites and blacks cannot\r\namalgamate on equal terms, in one political society, he exaggerates\r\nevery circumstance which tends to keep them asunder. The physical\r\ndifferences between the races, he tells us, practically defeat\r\nbenevolent laws. No Act of Parliament, no order in Council, can surmount\r\nthe difficulty. (2) Where these differences exist, the principles of\r\nrepublican equality are forgotten by the strongest republican. Marriage\r\nbecomes an unnatural prostitution. The Haytian refuses to admit the\r\nwhite to possess property within the sphere of negro domination. The\r\nmost humane and enlightened citizen of the United States, can discover\r\nno means of benefiting the free African, but by sending him to a\r\ndistance from men of European blood. “I should ill-perform my duty,”\r\n says the Major, “if I suppressed all mention of a physical cause like\r\nthis, which in practice is found to have an effect so powerful, however\r\nthe philanthropist\r\n\r\n     (1) First Part of Major Moody’s Report, p. 125.\r\n\r\n     (2) Second Part of Major Moody’s Report, p. 20 and 21\r\n\r\n{378}or the philosopher may regret it, and however it may be beyond\r\ntheir power to remove it by legislative means.” (1) But, when it is\r\ndesirable to prove the idleness of the free African, this omnipotent\r\nphysical cause, this instinct against which the best and wisest men\r\nstruggle in vain, which counteracts the attraction of sex, and defies\r\nthe authority of law, sinks into a “mere prejudice against the colour\r\nof a man’s skin,” an idle fancy, which never could induce any body of\r\npeople to remove able bodied men and women from their country, if those\r\nmen and women were willing to work. Are all the free negroes of North\r\nAmerica infirm, or are they all unwilling to work? They live in a\r\ntemperate climate, and to them the Major’s theory does not apply. Yet\r\nthe whites are subscribing to transport them to another country. Why\r\nshould we suppose the planters of Tortola to be superior to feelings\r\nwhich some of the most respectable men in the world are disposed to\r\ngratify, by sending thousands of people, at a great expense, from a\r\ncountry greatly understocked with hands?\r\n\r\nIt is true that the apprenticed Africans were not employed in the\r\ncultivation of the soil. The cause is evident. They could not legally be\r\nso employed. The Older in Council under the authority of which they\r\nwere put out to service, provided that no woman should be employed\r\nin tillage. The blank form of indenture sent out by the government\r\ncontained a similar restriction with regard to the males.\r\n\r\nWe are, however, inclined to believe with the Major, that these people,\r\nif they had been left to take their own course, would not have employed\r\nthemselves in agriculture. Those who have become masters of their time,\r\nrarely do so employ themselves. We will go further. We allow that very\r\nfew of the free blacks in our West Indian Islands, will undergo the\r\ndrudgery of cultivating the ground. Major Moody seems to think that,\r\nwhen this is grunted, all his principles follow of course. But we can by\r\nno means agree with him. In order to prove that the natives of tropical\r\ncountries entertain a peculiar aversion to agricultural labour, it is by\r\nno means sufficient to show that certain freemen, living in the torrid\r\nzone, do not choose to engage in agricultural labour. It is, we humbly\r\nconceive, necessary also to show, that the wages of agricultural labour\r\nare, at the place and time in\r\n\r\n     (1) Second Part of Major Moody’s Report, p. 21.\r\n\r\nquestion, {379}at least as high as those which can be obtained by\r\nindustry of another description. It by no means follows, that a man\r\nfeels an insurmountable dislike to the business of setting canes,\r\nbecause he will not set eanes for sixpence a day, when he can earn\r\na shilling by making baskets. We might as well say, that the English\r\npeople dislike agricultural labour, because Major Moody prefers making\r\nsystems to making ditches.\r\n\r\nObvious as these considerations are, it is perfectly clear that Major\r\nMoody has overlooked them. From the Appendix to his own Report it\r\nappears, that in every West Indian island the wages of the artisan are\r\nmuch greater than those of the cultivator. In Tortola, for example, a\r\ncarpenter earns three shillings sterling a day, a cartwright or a cooper\r\nfour shillings and sixpence, a sawyer six shillings; an ablebodied field\r\nnegro, under the most advantageous circumstances, nine pounds a year,\r\nabout seven pence a day, allowing for holidays. And because a free\r\nAfrican prefers six shillings to seven pence, we are told that he has\r\na natural and invincible aversion to agriculture!--because he prefers\r\nwealth to poverty, we are to conclude that he prefers repose to\r\nwealth. Such is the mode of reasoning which the Major designates as the\r\nphilosophy of labour.\r\n\r\nBut, says the Major, all employments, excepting those of the cultivator\r\nand the domestic servant, are only occasional. There is little demand\r\nfor the labour of the carpenter, the cooper, and the sawyer. Let us\r\nsuppose the demand to be so incredibly small, that the carpenter can\r\nobtain work only one day in six, the cooper one day in nine, and the\r\nsawyer one day in twelve; still the amount of their earnings will be\r\ngreater than if they broke clods almost daily through the whole year.\r\nOf two employments which yield equal wages, the inhabitants of all\r\ncountries, both within and without the tropics, will choose that whieh\r\nrequires the least labour Major Moody seems throughout his Report\r\nto imagine, that people in the temperate zone work for the sake of\r\nworking; that they consider labour, not as an evil to be endured for the\r\nsake of a good produced by it, but as a blessing, from which the wages\r\nare a sort of drawback; that they would rather work three days for a\r\nshilling, than one day for half a crown. The case, he may be assured,\r\nis by no means such as he supposes. If he will make proper inquiries he\r\nwill {380}learn, that, even where the thermometer stands at the lowest,\r\nno man will choose a laborious employment, when he can obtain equal\r\nremuneration with less trouble in another line. But it, is unnecessary\r\nto resort to this argument; for it is perfectly clear, on Major Moody’s\r\nown showing, that the demand for mechanical industry, though occasional\r\nand small, is still sufficient to render the business of an artisan much\r\nmore lucrative than that of a field labourer.\r\n\r\n“I have shown,” says he, “that the sugar-planter himself, obtaining 287\r\ndays labour on the very cheapest terms, could not have afforded to give\r\nmore than about 9l. per annum for labourers, and therefore, that he\r\nnever could hope to induce any liberated African to work steadily for\r\nsuch wages, when the liberated African could obtain from 15l. to 21l.\r\nper annum by the irregular labour of occasionally cutting firewood,\r\ngrass, or catching fish, &c....\r\n\r\n“This is the most favourable view of the case; for the fact is, the\r\nsugar-planter, on the very best soils in Tortola, could only a fiord\r\nto give 91. per annum; but in soils of average fertility, he could only\r\nafford 6l. 15s. per annum to the labourer, even if the planter gave up\r\nall profits on his stock, consisting of lands, buildings, and machinery.\r\nIf the liberated Negro would not labour steadily for 9l. per annum, it\r\nis clear he would be less likely to work for 6l. 15s. per annum; but\r\nif he did not work for less than that sum, the planter in Tortola could\r\nobtain no profit on stock, and consequently could have no motive for\r\nemploying any person to work for such wages. The white race, being\r\nunable to work, must in this, as in all similar cases, perish, or\r\nabandon their country and property to the blacks, who can work, but\r\nwho, as I have shown, are not likely to make use of more voluntary\r\nsteady exertion than will afford the means of subsistence in the\r\nlowlands of the torrid zone, where the pleasure of repose forms so great\r\nan ingredient in the happiness of mankind, whether whites, blacks, or\r\nIndians.”\r\n\r\nWe really stand aghast at the extravagance of a writer who supposes that\r\nthe principle which leads a man to prefer light labour and twenty-one\r\npounds, to hard labour and six Bounds fifteen shillings, is a principle\r\nof which the operation is confined to the torrid zone! But the matter\r\nmay be put on a very short issue. Let Major Moody find any tropical\r\ncountry in which the inhabitants prefer mechanical trades to field\r\nlabour when higher advantages are offered to the field labourer than to\r\nthe mechanic. He will then have done what he has not done hitherto. He\r\nwill have adduced one fact bearing on the question.\r\n\r\nIf the circumstances which we have been considering prove any thing,\r\nthey appear to prove the inexpediency of the {381}coercive system. The\r\neffect of that system in the West Indies has been to produce a glut\r\nof agricultural labour, and a scarcity of mechanical dexterity. The\r\ndiscipline of a plantation may stimulate a sluggish body; but it has no\r\ntendency to stimulate a sluggish mind. It calls forth a certain quantity\r\nof muscular exertion; but it does not encourage that ingenuity which is\r\nnecessary to the artisan. This is the only explanation which at present\r\noccurs to us of the enormous price which skilled labour fetches in a\r\ncountry in which the cultivator can barely obtain a subsistence. We\r\noffer it, however, with diffidence, as the result of a very hasty\r\nconsideration of the subject. But it is with no feeling of diffidence\r\nthat we pronounce the whole argument of the Major absurd. That he has\r\nconvinced himself we do not doubt. Indeed he has given the best proof\r\nof sincerity: For he has acted up to his theory; and left us, we must\r\nconfess, in some doubt whether to admire him more as an active or as a\r\nspeculative politician.\r\n\r\nMany of the African apprentices emigrated from Tortola to the Danish\r\nisland of St. Thomas, some with the consent of their masters, and others\r\nwithout it. Why they did so, is evident from the account which the Major\r\nhimself gives. The wages were higher in St. Thomas than in Tortola. But\r\nsuch theorists as the Major are subject to illusions as strange as\r\nthose which haunted Don Quixote. To the visionary Knight every inn was\r\na castle, every ass a charger, and every basin a helmet. To the Major\r\nevery fact, though explicable on ten thousand obvious suppositions, is\r\na confirmation of his darling hypothesis. He gives the following account\r\nof his opinions and of his consequent measures.\r\n\r\n“The occupations followed by the apprentices in the Danish island of St.\r\nThomas, on these occasions were generally the irregular and occasional\r\nindustry of porters, servants on hoard vessels, &e., in which they often\r\ngot comparatively high wages, which enabled them to work for money\r\nat one time in order to live, without working for a longer or shorter\r\nperiod; such a mode of existence being more agreeable to them than\r\nsteady and regular industry affording employment during the whole year.\r\n\r\n“From this irregular application to certain kinds of labour and dislike\r\nto that of agriculture, it was my wish to turn the attention of the\r\nAfrican apprentices, and therefore I was anxious to prevent their\r\nrunning away to the Danish island of St. Thomas, or being sent there.\r\nHis Excellency Governor Van Seholton afforded me every facility in\r\nremoving them; but they soon returned again. It will also be seen that\r\nin St. Thomas they were liable to be taken up and sold as slaves, it was\r\nactually the case with one apprentice. It is not undeserving of remark,\r\nthat not one of the apprentices who thus withdrew themselves from\r\nTortola, ever {382}hired themselves to agricultural labor for any fixed\r\nperiod.”\r\n\r\n“The occasional high wages in irregular kinds of industry, however\r\nuncertain, appear to have pleased them belter than the permanent\r\nrewards procured by an employment less exposed to uncertainty, but which\r\nrequired a steady exertion.”\r\n\r\nWhat the permanent rewards of agricultural labour were in Tortola, we\r\nhave seen. The planter would have found it ruinous on most estates to\r\ngive more than six pounds fifteen shillings a year, or about fourpence\r\na day. Unless, therefore, they were much higher in St. Thomas, it is\r\nsurely not extraordinary that they did not induce these apprentices\r\nto quit the employments to which, not by their own choice, but by\r\nthe orders of the Government, they had been trained, for a pursuit\r\nuncongenial to all their habits. How often is it that an Englishman,\r\nwho has served his apprenticeship to an artisan, hires himself to\r\nagricultural labour when he can find work in his own line?\r\n\r\nBut we will pass by the absurdity of condemning people for preferring\r\nhigh wages with little labour, to low wages with severe labour. We\r\nhave other objections to make. The Major has told us that the African\r\napprentices could not legally be employed in agriculture on the island\r\nof Tortola. If so, we wish to know how their dislike of agricultural\r\nlabour could be their motive for quitting Tortola, or how, by bringing\r\nthem back to Tortola, he could improve their habits in that respect? To\r\nbring a man by main force from a residence which he likes, and to place\r\nhim in the hands of an employer acknowledged to be cruel, for fear that\r\nhe may possibly be made a slave, seems to us also a somewhat curious\r\nproceeding, and deserves notice, as being the only indication of zeal\r\nfor liberty which the Major appears to have betrayed during the whole\r\ncourse of his mission.\r\n\r\nThe Major might perhaps be justified in exerting himself to recover\r\nthose apprentices who had emigrated without the consent of their\r\nmasters. But with regard to the rest, his conduct {383}appears to have\r\nbeen equally absurd and mischievous. He repeatedly tells us that Tortola\r\nis a poor island. It appears from the schedules, that he was in the\r\nhabit of asking the masters and mistresses, whether their apprentices,\r\nafter the term of service should have expired, would be able to support\r\nthemselves. In the ease of some most respectable and industrious\r\nworkmen, the answer was, that they possessed all the qualifications\r\nwhich would enable them to earn a livelihood; but that Tortola was too\r\npoor to afford them an adequate field: And this was evidently the cause\r\nwhich induced so many to transport themselves to St. Thomas. Of all the\r\ninnumerable instances in which public, functionaries have exposed their\r\nignorance by officiously meddling with matters of which individuals\r\nought to be left to judge for themselves, we remember none more\r\nconspicuous than that which Major Moody has thus recorded against\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut it seems the industry of these emigrants, and indeed of the free\r\nBlacks generally, is not regular or steady. These are words of which\r\nMajor Moody is particularly fond, and which he generally honours with\r\nItalics. We have, throughout this article, taken the facts as he states\r\nthem, and contented ourselves with exposing the absurdity of his\r\ninferences. We shall do so now. We will grant that the free blacks do\r\nnot work so steadily as the slaves, or as the labourers in many other\r\ncountries. But how does Major Moody connect this unsteadiness with the\r\nclimate? To us it appears to be the universal effect of an advance\r\nin wages, an effeet not confined to tropical countries, but daily and\r\nhourly witnessed in England by every man who attends to the habits\r\nof the lower orders. Let us suppose, that an English manufacturer can\r\nprovide himself with those indulgences which use has rendered necessary\r\nto his comfort for ten shillings a week, and that he ean earn ten\r\nshillings a week by working steadily twelve hours a day. In that case,\r\nhe will probably work twelve hours a day. But let us suppose that the\r\nwages of his labour rise to thirty shillings. Will he still continue\r\nto work twelve hours a day, for the purpose of trebling his present\r\nenjoyments, or of laying up a hoard against bad tunes? Notoriously\r\nnot. He will perhaps work four days in the week, and thus earn twenty\r\nshillings, a sum larger than that whieh he formerly obtained, but less\r\nthan that which he might obtain if he chose to labour as he formerly\r\nlaboured.\r\n\r\nWhen {384}the wages of the workman rise, he Everywhere takes out, if\r\nwe may so express ourselves, some portion of the rise in the form of\r\nrepose. This is the real explanation of that unsteadiness on which Major\r\nMoody dwells so much--an unsteadiness which cannot surprise any person\r\nwho has ever talked with an English manufacturer, or ever heard the name\r\nof Saint Monday. It appears by his own report, that a negro slave works\r\nfrom Monday morning to Saturday night on the sugar grounds of Tortola,\r\nand receives what is equivalent to something less than half-a-crown in\r\nreturn, then he ceases to be a slave, and becomes his own master; and\r\nthen he finds that by cutting firewood, an employment which requires\r\nno great skill, he can earn eight shillings and fourpence a week. By\r\nworking every other day he can procure better food and better clothes\r\nthan ever he had before. In no country from the Pole to the Equator,\r\nwould a labourer under such circumstances work steadily. The Major\r\nconsiders it as a strange phenomenon, peculiar to the torrid zone, that\r\nthese people lay up little against seasons of sickness and distress--as\r\nif this were not almost universally the case among the far more\r\nintelligent population of England--as if we did not regularly see our\r\nartisans thronging to the alehouse when wages are high, and to the\r\npawnbroker’s shop when they are low--as if we were not annually raising\r\nmillions, in order to save the working classes from the misery which\r\notherwise would be the consequence of their own improvidence.\r\n\r\nWe are not the advocates of idleness and imprudence. The question before\r\nus is, not whether it be desirable that men all over the world should\r\nlabour more steadily than they now do; but whether the laws which\r\nregulate labour within the tropics differ from those which are in\r\noperation elsewhere. This is a question which never can be settled,\r\nmerely by comparing the quantity of work done in different places. By\r\npursuing such a course, we should establish a separate law of labour for\r\nevery country, and for every trade in every country. The free African\r\ndoes not work so steadily as the Englishman. But the wild Indian, by\r\nthe Major’s own account, works still less steadily than the African.\r\nThe Chinese labourer, on the other hand, works more steadily than the\r\nEnglishman. In this island, the industry of the porter or the waterman,\r\nis less steady than the industry {385}of the ploughman. But the great\r\ngeneral principle is the same in all. All will work extremely hard\r\nrather than miss the comforts to which they have been habituated; and\r\nall, when they find it possible to obtain their accustomed comforts\r\nwith less than their accustomed labour, will not work so hard as\r\nthey formerly worked, merely to increase them. The real point to be\r\nascertained, therefore, is, whether the free African is content to miss\r\nhis usual enjoyments, not whether he works steadily or not; for the\r\nChinese peasant would work as irregularly as the Englishman, and the\r\nEnglishman as irregularly as the negro, if this could be done without\r\nany diminution of comforts. Now, it does not appear from any passage in\r\nthe v hole Report, that the free blacks are retrograding in their\r\nmode of living. It appears on the contrary, that their work, however\r\nirregular, does in fact enable them to live more comfortably than they\r\never did as slaves. The unsteadiness, therefore, of which they are\r\naccused, if it be an argument for coercing them, is equally an argument\r\nfor coercing the spinners of Manchester and the grinders of Sheffield.\r\n\r\nThe next ease which we shall notice is, that of the native Indians\r\nwithin the tropics. That these savages have a great aversion to\r\nsteady labour, and that they have made scarcely any advances toward\r\ncivilization we readily admit. Major Moody speaks on this subject with\r\nauthority; for it seems that, when he visited one of their tribes, they\r\nforgot to boil the pot for him, and put him off with a speech, which\r\nhe has reported at length, instead of a meal.1 He, as usual, attributes\r\ntheir habits to the heat of the climate. But let us consider that the\r\nIndians of North America, with much greater advantages, live in the same\r\nmanner. A most enlightened and prosperous community has arisen in their\r\nvicinity. Many benevolent men have attempted to correct their roving\r\npropensities, and to inspire them with a taste for those comforts which\r\nindustry alone can procure. They still obstinately adhere to their old\r\nmode of life. The independence, the strong excitement, the occasional\r\nperiods of intense exertion, the long intervals of repose, have\r\nbecome delightful and almost necessary to them. It is well known\r\nthat Europeans, who have lived among them for any length of time, are\r\nstrangely fascinated by the pleasures of that state {386}of society, and\r\neven by its sufferings and hazards. Among ourselves, the Gypsey race,\r\none of the most beautiful and intelligent on the face of the earth, has\r\nlived for centuries in a similar manner. Those singular outcasts have\r\nbeen surrounded on every side by the great works of human labour. The\r\nadvantage’s of industry were forced upon their notice. The roads on\r\nwhich they travelled, the hedges under which they rested, the hen-roosts\r\nwhich furnished their repast, the silver which crossed their palms--all\r\nmust have constantly reminded them of the conveniences and luxuries\r\nwhich are to be obtained by steady exertion. They were persecuted under\r\na thousand pretexts, whipped for vagrants, imprisoned for poachers,\r\nducked for witches. The severest laws were enacted against them. To\r\nconsort with them was long a capital offence. Yet a remnant of the\r\nrace still preserves its peculiar language and manners--still prefers\r\na tattered tent and a chance-meal of carrion to a warm house and a\r\ncomfortable dinner. If the habits of the Indians of Guiana prove that\r\nslavery is necessary within the tropics, the habits of the Mohawks and\r\nGypsies will equally prove, that it is necessary in the temperate zone.\r\nThe heat cannot be the cause of that which is found alike in the coldest\r\nand in the hottest countries.\r\n\r\nMajor Moody gives a long account of the Maroon settlements near Surinam.\r\nThese settlements were first formed by slaves, who fled from the\r\nplantations on the coast, about the year 1667. The society was,\r\nduring the following century, augmented from time to time by fresh\r\nreinforcements of fugitive negroes. This supply, however, has now been\r\nfor many years stopped. It is perfectly true, that these people were\r\nlong contented with a bare subsistence, and that little of steady\r\nagricultural industry has ever existed amongst them. The Major again\r\nrecurs to physical causes, and the heat of the sun. A better explanation\r\nmay be given in one word, insecurity. During about one hundred years,\r\nthe Maroons were absolutely run down like mad dogs. It appears from the\r\nwork of Captain Stedman, to which the Major himself alludes, that those\r\nwho fell into the hands of the whites were hung up by hooks thrust into\r\ntheir ribs, torn to pieces on the rack, or roasted on slow fires. They\r\nattempted to avoid the danger, by frequently changing, and carefully\r\nconcealing their residence. The accidental crowing of a cock, {387}had\r\nbrought destruction on a whole tribe. That a people thus situated should\r\nlabour to acquire property which they could not enjoy--that they\r\nshould engage in employments which would necessarily attach them to a\r\nparticular spot, was not to be expected. Their habits necessarily became\r\nirregular and ferocious. They plundered the colony--they plundered each\r\nother--they lived by hunting and fishing. The only productions of the\r\nearth which they cultivated, were such as could be speedily reared, and\r\neasily concealed. But during the last fifty years, these tribes have\r\nenjoyed a greater degree of security; and from the statement of Major\r\nMoody, who has himself visited that country, and who, though a wretched\r\nlogician, is an unexceptionable witness, it appears, that they are\r\nrapidly advancing in civilization; that they have acquired a sense of\r\nnew wants, and a relish for new pleasures; that agriculture has taken\r\na more regular form; and that the vices and miseries of savage life are\r\ndisappearing together.\r\n\r\n“The young men among the Maroons acknowledged, that the conduct of the\r\nchiefs had become much better, in respect of not interfering with the\r\nwives of others, and that everybody now could have his own wife.”.......\r\n\r\n“I observed, that they had adopted the system of sometimes domesticating\r\nwild animals, and rearing those already domesticated for food; that\r\ninstead of always boucaning their meats, like the Indians, they now\r\noften used salt when they could get it; and, finally, that instead of\r\ndepending on the forests for fruits, or cultivating roots which were\r\nsoon reaped, and conld easily be concealed, they had generally adopted\r\nthe banana and plantain as a food, which requires about twelve months to\r\nproduce its fruits, and the tree obtains a considerable height.”....\r\n\r\n“I also found, that a certain degree of occasional industry had taken\r\nplace among the Maroons. Some of these young men had devoted a few days\r\nin the year to cutting down trees which nature had planted. From such\r\noccasional labour they were enabled to procure finery for a favourite\r\nfemale, a better, gun, or a new axe.”\r\n\r\nSurely this statement is most encouraging. No sooner was security given\r\nto these Maroons, than improvement commenced. A single generation has\r\nsufficed to change these hunters into cultivators of the earth, to teach\r\nthem the use of domestic animals, to awaken among them a taste for the\r\nluxuries and distinctions of polished societies. That their labour is\r\nstill only occasional, we grant. But this, we cannot too often\r\nrepeat, is not the question. If occasional labour {388}will supply the\r\ninhabitant of the temperate zone with comforts greater than those to\r\nwhich he is accustomed, he will labour only occasionally. These negroes\r\nare not only willing to work rather than forego their usual comforts,\r\nbut are also willing to make some addition to their labour, for the sake\r\nof some addition to their comforts. Nothing more can be said for the\r\nlabourers of any country. The principle which has made England and\r\nHolland what they are, is evidently at work in the thickets of Surinam.\r\n\r\nThat the habits of the fugitives were altogether idle and irregular\r\ntill within the last fifty years, is nothing to the purpose. How much\r\nof regular industry was formerly to be found among the outlawed\r\nmoss-troopers of our Border, or in the proscribed elan of the\r\nMacgregors? Down to a very late period, a large part of the Scotch\r\npeople were as averse to steady industry as any tribe of Maroons. In\r\nthe year 1698, Fletcher of Saltonn called the attention of the Scottish\r\nParliament to this horrible evil. “This country,” says he, “has always\r\nswarmed with such numbers of idle vagabonds as no laws could ever\r\nrestrain. There are at this day in Scotland two hundred thousand people\r\nbegging from door to door, living without any regard or subjection to\r\nthe laws of the land, or to even those of God and nature. No magistrate\r\ncould ever discover or be informed which way one in a hundred of\r\nthese wretches died, or that ever they were baptised.” He advises\r\nthe Government to set them to work; but he strongly represents\r\nthe difficulty of such an undertaking. That sort of people is so\r\ndesperately wicked, such enemies of all work and labour, and, which is\r\nyet more amazing, so proud in esteeming their own condition above that\r\nwhich they will be sure to call slavery, that, unless prevented by the\r\nutmost industry and diligence, upon the first publication of any orders\r\nfor putting in execution such a design, they will rather die with hunger\r\nin caves and dens, and murder their young children. Fletcher was a\r\nbrave, honest, and sensible man. He had fought and suffered for liberty.\r\nYet the circumstances of his country shook his faith in the true\r\nprinciples of government. He looked with dismay on the mountains\r\noccupied by lawless chiefs and their gangs, and the lowlands cursed\r\nby the depredations of some plunderers and the protection of others.\r\nEverywhere he saw swarms of robbers and beggars. He contrasted this\r\ndesolate prospect {389}with the spectacle which Holland presented, the\r\nmiracles which human industry had there achieved, a country rescued from\r\nthe ocean, vast and splendid cities, ports crowded with ships, meadows\r\ncultivated to the highest point, canals along which hundreds of boats\r\nwere constantly passing, mercantile houses of which the daily payments\r\nexceeded the whole rental of the Highlands, an immense population whose\r\nhabits were sober and laborious, and who acquired their comforts, not\r\nby injuring, but by benefiting their neighbours. He did not sufficiently\r\nconsider that this state of things sprung from the wisdom and vigour of\r\na government, which insured to every man the fruits of his exertions,\r\nand protected equally the pleasures of every class, from the pipe of\r\nthe mechanic to the picture-gallery and the tulip-garden of the\r\nBurgomaster;--that in Scotland, on the contrary, the police was feeble,\r\nand the gentry rich in men and destitute of money; that robbery was in\r\nconsequence common; that people will not build barns to be burned,\r\nor rear cattle to be lifted; that insecurity produced idleness, and\r\nidleness crimes, that these crimes again augmented the insecurity from\r\nwhich they had sprung. He overlooked these circumstances, and attributed\r\nthe evil to the want of coercion. He censured the wreak humanity of\r\nthose fathers of the church who had represented slavery as inconsistent\r\nwith Christianity. He cited those texts with which the controversies\r\nof our own times have rendered us so familiar. Finally, he proposed to\r\nconvert the lower classes into domestic bondsmen. His arguments were\r\nat least as plausible as those of Major Moody. But how signally has\r\nthe event refuted them! Slavery was not established in Scotland. On the\r\ncontrary, the changes which have taken place there have been favourable\r\nto personal liberty. The power of the chiefs has been destroyed.\r\nSecurity has been given to the capitalist and to the labourer. Could\r\nFletcher now revisit Scotland, he would find a country which might well\r\nbear a comparison with his favourite Holland.\r\n\r\nThe History of the Maroons of Surinam appears to us strictly analogous\r\nto that of the Scottish peasantry. In both cases insecurity produced\r\nidleness. In both security produces industry. The African community\r\nindeed, in the middle of the last century was far more barbarous than\r\nany part of the Scotch nation has ever been since the dawn of authentic\r\n{390}history. Not one of the fugitives had ever been taught to read and\r\nwrite. The traces of civilization which they brought from the colony\r\nwere very slight, and were soon effaced by the habits of a lawless and\r\nperilous life. Of late, however, their progress has been rapid. Judging\r\nof the future by the past, we entertain a strong hope that they will\r\nsoon form a flourishing and respectable society. At all events, we\r\nare sure that their condition affords no ground for believing that the\r\nlabourer, within the tropics, acts on principles different from those\r\nwhich regulate his conduct elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the case of Hayti, a ease on which Major Moody and his\r\ndisciples place the strongest reliance. The report tells us, that\r\nToussaint, Christophe and Boyer, have all found it necessary to\r\ncompel the free negroes of that island to employ themselves in\r\nagriculture--that exportation has diminished--that the quantity of\r\ncoffee now produced is much smaller than that which was grown under the\r\nFrench government--that the cultivation of sugar is abandoned--that the\r\nHaytians have not only ceased to export that article, but have begun\r\nto import it--that the men indulge themselves in repose, and force the\r\nwomen to work for them; and, finally, that this dislike of labour can\r\nbe explained only by the heat of the climate, and can be subdued only by\r\ncoercion.\r\n\r\nNow we have to say, in the first place, that the proofs which the Major\r\nbrings refute each other. If, as he states, the Haytians are coerced,\r\nand have been coerced during the la>t thirty years, their idleness maybe\r\nan excellent argument against slavery, but can be no argument against\r\nliberty. If it be said that the coercion employed in Hayti is not\r\nsufficiently severe, we answer thus:--We never denied, that of two kinds\r\nof coercion, the more severe is likely to be the more efficient. Men can\r\nbe induced to work only by two motives, hope and fear; the former is the\r\nmotive of the free labourer, the latter of the slave. We hold that,\r\nin the long run, hope will answer best. But we are perfectly ready to\r\nadmit, that a strong fear will stimulate industry more powerfully than\r\na weak fear. The case of llayti, therefore, can at most only prove that\r\nsevere slavery answers its purpose better than lenient slavery. It can\r\nprove nothing for slavery against freedom. But the Major is not entitled\r\nto use two contradictory {391}arguments. One or the other he must\r\nabandon. It’ he chooses to reason on the decrees of Toussaint and\r\nChristophe, he has no right to talk of the decrease of production. If,\r\non the other hand, he insists on the idleness of the Haytians, he must\r\nadmit their liberty. If they are not free, their idleness can be no\r\nargument against freedom.\r\n\r\nBut we will do more than expose the inconsistency of the Major. We will\r\ntake both suppositions successively, and show that neither of them can\r\naffect the present question.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, let it be supposed that a coercive system is established\r\nin Hayti. Major Moody seems to think that this fact, if admitted, is\r\nsufficient to decide the controversy.\r\n\r\n“The annexed regulations,” says he, “of Toussaint, Desformomi, and\r\nChristophe, as well as those of President Boyer, intended for people\r\nin circumstances similar to those of the liberated Africans, appear to\r\nprove practically that some such measures are necessary as those which\r\nI have submitted as the result of my own personal observation ami\r\nexperience, in the control of human labour in different climes, and\r\nunder various circumstances.”\r\n\r\nWe must altogether dissent from this doctrine. It does not appear to us\r\nquite self-evident, that every law which every government may choose\r\nto make is necessarily a wise law. We have sometimes been inclined\r\nto suspect that, even in this enlightened country, legislators have\r\ninterfered in matters which should have been left to take their own\r\ncourse. An English Parliament formerly thought fit to limit the wages\r\nof labour. This proceeding does not perfectly satisfy us, that wages\r\nhad previously been higher than they should have been. Elizabeth,\r\nunquestionably the greatest sovereign that ever governed England, passed\r\nthose laws for the support of the poor, which, though in seeming and\r\nintention most humane, have produced more evil than all the cruelties\r\nof Aero and Maximin. We have just seen that, at the close of the\r\nseventeenth century, a most respectable and enlightened Scotch\r\ngentleman thought slavery the only cure for the maladies of his country.\r\nChristophe was not destitute of talent:-. Toussaint was a man of great\r\ngenius and unblemished integrity, a brave soldier, and in many respects\r\na wise statesman. But both these men had been slaves. Both were ignorant\r\nof history and political economy. That idleness {392}and disorders\r\nshould follow a general civil war, was perfectly natural. That rulers,\r\naccustomed to a system of compulsory labour, should think such a system\r\nthe only cure for those evils, is equally natural. But what inference\r\ncan be drawn from such circumstances?\r\n\r\nThe negligence with which Major Moody has arranged his Appendix, is most\r\nextraordinary. He has, with strange inconsistency, given us no copy\r\nof the decree of Toussaint in the original, and no translation of the\r\ndecree of Christophe. The decree of Boyer, the most important of the\r\nthree, he has not thought fit to publish at all; though he repeatedly\r\nmentions it in terms which seem to imply that he has seen it. Our\r\nreaders are probably aware, that the decree of Toussaint, or rather the\r\nMajor’s translation of it, was retouched by some of the statesmen of\r\nJamaica, docked of the first and last paragraphs, which would at once\r\nhave betrayed its date, and sent over by the Assembly to England, as a\r\nnew law of President Boyer. This forgery, the silliest and most impudent\r\nthat has been attempted within our remembrance, was at once exposed. The\r\nreal decree, if there be such a decree, is not yet before the public.\r\n\r\nThe decree of Toussaint was issued in a time of such extreme confusion,\r\nthat even if we were to admit its expediency, which we are very far from\r\ndoing, we should not be bound to draw any general conclusion from it.\r\nAll the reasonings which Major Moody founds on the decree of Christophe,\r\nmaybe refuted by this simple answer--that decree lays at least as many\r\nrestraints on the capitalist as on the labourer. It directs him to\r\nprovide machinery and mills. It limits the amount of Ins live-stock. It\r\nprescribes the circumstances under which he may form new plantations of\r\ncoffee. It enjoins the manner in which he is to press his canes and\r\nto clean his cotton. The Major reasons: Christophe compelled the\r\nfield-negroes to work. Hence it follows, that men who live in hot\r\nclimates will not cultivate the soil steadily without compulsion. We\r\nmay surely say, with equal justice, Christophe prescribed the manner in\r\nwhich the proprietor was to employ his capital, it is, therefore, to\r\nbe inferred, that a capitalist in a hot climate cannot judge of his own\r\ninterests, and that the government ought to take the management of his\r\nconcerns out of his hands. If the Major will not adopt this conclusion,\r\nhe must abandon {393}his own. All our readers will admit, that a Prince\r\nwho could lay the capitalists under such restrictions as those which we\r\nhave mentioned, must have been ignorant of political science, and prone\r\nto interfere in cases where legislative interference is foolish\r\nand pernicious. What conclusion, then, can be justly drawn from the\r\nrestraints imposed by such a ruler on the freedom of the peasant?\r\n\r\nWe have thus disposed of the first hypothesis, namely, that the\r\nHaytians are coerced. We will proceed to the second. Let it be supposed,\r\nthat the Haytians are not coerced. In that case we say, that if they do\r\nnot export as much as formerly, it will not necessarily follow that they\r\ndo not work as much as formerly; and that, if they do not work as much\r\nas formerly, it still will not follow that their idleness proceeds from\r\nphysical causes, or forms any exception to the general principles which\r\nregulate labour.\r\n\r\nThe first great cause which depresses the industry of the Haytians, is\r\nthe necessity of keeping up large and costly establishments. All who,\r\nsince the expulsion of the French, have governed that country, have\r\nwisely and honourably sacrificed every other consideration to the\r\npreservation of independence. Large armies have been kept up. A\r\nconsiderable part of the population has consequently been supported\r\nin an unproductive employment; and a heavy burden has been laid on the\r\nindustry of the rest. Major Moody quotes the following passage from the\r\nnarrative of a most respectable and benevolent American, Mr. Dewey:--\r\n\r\n“Throughout the island the women perform the principal part of the\r\nlabour in the field and in the house.... I was often moved with\r\npity for their lot, though I rejoiced that the burden was now voluntary,\r\nand admired the spirit of women who could so readily perform the work of\r\nthe men, that the men may be employed in the defence and preservation of\r\ntheir liberties.”\r\n\r\nThe Major pounces on the fact stated by Mr. Dewey; but, with the amiable\r\ncondescension of a superior nature, gently corrects his inferences.\r\n\r\n“That Mr. Dewey, and pious persons like him, do state the facts which\r\nhe observed correctly, I am quite convinced: but when he, and those who\r\nreason in his manner, assign causes as solely producing the effect, it\r\nis then that error glides into their statements.”\r\n\r\nWe are not so completely convinced as the Major seems to {394}be, that\r\nall pious persons state correctly such facts as Mr. Dewey has observed:\r\nbut we are sure, that Mr. Dewey must be the most ungrateful of men,\r\nif he is not grateful for such compliments. Indeed, the style which\r\nthe Major always adopts towards philanthropists reminds us of Dogberry\r\npatting Verges on the back:--“A good old man. Sir! he will be talking.\r\nWell said, i’faith, neighbour. An two men ride of a horse, one must ride\r\nbehind. An honest soid, i’faith, as ever broke bread. But God is to be\r\nworshipped. All men are not alike.” But we must go on with the argument\r\nof our philosophical commissioner.\r\n\r\n“Any person who has travelled among people in a backward state of\r\nknowledge and social civilization, people who never experienced what\r\nslavery was, must have observed, as I have done, that the burden\r\nof agricultural labour is generally imposed on the females, by the\r\narbitrary power exercised over them by the males....”\r\n\r\n“Whilst an examination into the actual population of Hayti, and the real\r\nnumber of the males actually withdrawn from agricultural pursuits for\r\nthose of military service, at the time Mr. Dewey made his observations,\r\nwould show, that, though the cause assigned by him might have some\r\neffect, that, in point of fact, a more powerful influence would probably\r\nbe found in the action of causes springing from a different source than\r\nthat assigned by him as the true cause; and whilst these other powerful\r\ncauses are left in action, little practical good is effected by the\r\nremoval of a minor influence.” (1)\r\n\r\nWe have not time to notice the innumerable beauties of this headless and\r\nendless sentence, in which a double allowance of thats compensates for\r\nthe absence of a nominative case and a verb:--those who study the works\r\nof the Major must take such grammar as they can get, and be thankful.\r\nBut, does be advance any reason, or the shadow of tiny reason,\r\nfor dissenting from the opinion formed by a man whose honesty he\r\nacknowledges, on a point on which it is scarcely possible to be\r\nmistaken? No man of common sense can live three days in a country\r\nwithout finding out, whether it is by idleness, or by military duties,\r\nthat the males are prevented from working. But Major Moody reasons\r\nthus--Savages, from their propensity to indolence, make their women work\r\nfor them. The Haytians make their women work for them; therefore the\r\nHaytians are indolent savages;--an exquisite specimen of syllogistic\r\nreasoning! Horses are quadrupeds: but a pig is a quadruped; therefore a\r\npig is a horse. The\r\n\r\n     (1) Ibid. p. 39.\r\n\r\ndullest {395}of the gravediggers in Hamlet would have been ashamed of\r\nsuch an argal.\r\n\r\nThe Major surely does not mean to deny, that, in civilized and\r\nindustrious nations, circumstances similar to those which exist in\r\nHayti, have compelled the women to engage in agricultural labour.\r\nHistory abounds with such instances. When, fourteen years ago, the\r\nPrussians rose against the French, almost the whole harvest of Silesia\r\nand Upper Saxony was gathered in by females. The conscriptions of\r\nBuonaparte frequently produced the same effect. The Major says, indeed,\r\nor rather we, endowing his purposes with Syntax, say for him, that\r\nif the numbers of the Haytian people and of the Haytian army were\r\nascertained, the causes assigned by Mr. Dewey would be found to have\r\nproduced only part of the effect. But what evidence does he offer? Where\r\nare his facts, and his reasonings on these facts? Does he know what the\r\npopulation of Hayti may be? Does he know how large its army may be? If\r\nhe knows, why does he not tell us? If he does not know, how can he tell\r\nwhat might be the result of an examination into those particulars? It\r\nis something too much that a writer, who, when he tries to demonstrate,\r\nnever demonstrates any thing but his own ignorance of the art of\r\nreasoning, should expect to be implicitly believed, when he merely\r\ndogmatizes.\r\n\r\nWe grant, that the Haytians do not rear any great quantity of sugar.\r\nBut can this circumstance be explained only by supposing that they\r\nare averse to the labour necessary for that purpose? When capital is\r\nwithdrawn from a particular trade, a political economist is commonly\r\ninclined to suspect that the profits are smaller than those which may be\r\nobtained in other lines of business. Now, it is a notorious fact, that\r\nthe profits which the cultivation of sugar yields are, in all our West\r\nIndian islands, extremely low; that the business is carried on only\r\nbecause a large quantity of capital has already been fixed in forms\r\nuseless for every other purpose; and that, if this fixed capital were to\r\nbe suddenly destroyed, no fresh investment would take place. A man\r\nwho has purchased a costly apparatus for the purpose of carrying on a\r\nparticular manufacture, will not necessarily change his business because\r\nhe finds that his gains are smaller than those which he might obtain\r\nelsewhere, he will generally prefer a small profit to a dead loss, and\r\nrather take two per cent upon {396}his first investment than let that\r\ninvestment perish altogether, suffer his machinery to be idle, and turn\r\nthe remains of his fortune to a pursuit in which he might make five per\r\ncent. This, we believe, is the only cause which keeps up the cultivation\r\nof sugar in Jamaica and Antigua.\r\n\r\nIn Hayti this cause has ceased to operate. Most of the fixed capital\r\nnecessary for the sugar-trade was destroyed by the war which followed\r\nthe liberation of the negroes. The machinery which remained was employed\r\nas formerly. But it was not replaced as it fell to decay. This at once\r\nexplains the gradual decrease of production. A similar decrease, from\r\nsimilar causes, is taking place in our oldest colonies. But let us\r\neven suppose that the cultivation of sugar was likely, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, to flourish in Hayti, it still remains to be considered\r\nwhat security capital invested in that business would have enjoyed.\r\nA short time back it seemed by no means improbable that France would\r\nassert her rights to the sovereignty of the island by arms. In the\r\nyear 1814, the strongest apprehensions were entertained. A murderous and\r\ndevastating war, a war in which quarter would neither have been given\r\nor taken, was to be expected. The plan of defence which the rulers of\r\nti contemplated was suited to so terrible a crisis. It was intended\r\nto turn the coast into a desert, to set fire to the buildings, to\r\ntall back on the interior fastnesses of the country, and by constant\r\nskirmishes, by hunger, and by the effects of a climate so fatal to\r\nEuropeans, to wear out the invading army. This design was avowed by the\r\nGovernment in publications which have found their way to England. It\r\nwas justified by circumstances, and it could scarcely have failed\r\nof success. But it is evident that the remotest prospect of such an\r\nemergency would alone have deterred any capitalist from sinking\r\nhis property in the extensive and valuable machinery necessary to a\r\nsugar-planter.\r\n\r\nIt is true that there is a diminution in the quantity of coffee exported\r\nfrom Hayti. But the cause of the diminution is obvious. The taxes on\r\nthat article are exorbitantly high. The territorial impost raised on the\r\nplantation, and the customs which must be paid previous to exportation,\r\nmake up a duty of sixty per cent, on the prime cost. If the Haytians\r\nare to be free, they must have an army. If they are to have an army,\r\nthey must raise money; and this may possibly {397}be the best way\r\nof raising it. But it is evidently impossible that a commodity thus\r\nburdened can maintain a competition with the produce of countries where\r\nno taxes exist.\r\n\r\nWe therefore think it by no means improbable that the Haytians may have\r\nabandoned the cultivation of sugar and coffee, not from idleness, but\r\nfrom prudence; that they may have been as industriously employed\r\nas their enslaved ancestors, though in a different manner. All the\r\ntestimony which we have ever been able to procure tends to prove that\r\nthey are at least industrious enough to live comfortably, and multiply\r\nrapidly under the weight of a very heavy taxation.\r\n\r\nWe have shown that the decrease in the exports of Hayti does not\r\nnecessarily prove a decrease in the industry of the people. But we also\r\nmaintain, that, even if we were to admit that the Haytians work less\r\nsteadily than formerly, Major Moody has no right to attribute that\r\ncircumstance to the influence of climate. His error in this and in many\r\nother parts of his work proceeds from an utter ignorance of the habits\r\nof labourers in the temperate zone. What those habits are, we have\r\nalready stated. If an English labourer, who lias hitherto been unable\r\nto obtain the enjoyments to which he is accustomed without working three\r\nhundred days a year, should find himself able to obtain those enjoyments\r\nby working a hundred days a year, he will not continue to work three\r\nhundred days a year. He will make some addition to his pleasures, but he\r\nwill abate largely of his exertions. He will probably work only on\r\nthe alternate days. The ease of the Haytian is the same. As a slave he\r\nworked twelve months in the year, and received perhaps as much as he\r\nwould have been able to raise in one month, if he had worked on his own\r\naccount. He was liberated--he found that, by working for two months,\r\nhe could procure luxuries of which he had never dreamed. If he worked\r\nunsteadily, he did only what an Englishman, in the same circumstances,\r\nwould have done. In order to prove that labour in Hayti follows a\r\nlaw different from that which is in operation among ourselves, it is\r\nnecessary to prove, not merely that the Haytian works unsteadily, but\r\nthat he will forego comforts to which he is accustomed, rather than work\r\nsteadily.\r\n\r\nThis Major Moody has not even asserted of the Haytians, or {398}of any\r\nother class of tropical labourers. He has, therefore, altogether failed\r\nto show, that the natives of the torrid zone cannot be safely left to\r\nthe influence of those principles which have most effectually promoted\r\ncivilization in Europe. If the law of labour be everywhere the same,\r\nand he has said nothing which induces us to doubt that it is so, that\r\nunsteadiness of which he speaks will, at least in its extreme degree,\r\nlast only for a time, which, compared with the life of a nation, is but\r\nas a day in the life of man. The luxuries of one generation will become\r\nthe necessaries of the next. As new desires are awakened, greater\r\nexertions will be necessary. This cause, cooperating with that increase\r\nof population of which the Major himself admits the effect, will,\r\nin less than a century, make the llayti an labourer what the English\r\nlabourer now is.\r\n\r\nThe last case which we shall consider is, that of the free negroes who\r\nemigrated from North America to llayti. They were in number about six\r\nthousand. President Boyer undertook to defray the whole expense of their\r\npassage, and to support them for four months after their arrival--a\r\nclear proof that the people of Hayti are industrious enough to place at\r\nthe disposal of the Government funds more than sufficient to defray\r\nits ordinary charges. We give the sixth and seventh articles of Boyer’s\r\ninstruction to the agent employed by him on this occasion, as Major\r\nMoody states them. It is on these that his whole argument turns.\r\n\r\n“Article VI.--To regulate better the interests of the emigrants, it\r\nwill be proper to let them know in detail, what the government of the\r\nrepublic is disposed to do, to assure their future well-being and\r\nthat of their children, on the sole condition of their being good and\r\nindustrious citizens. You are authorized, in concert with the agents\r\nof the different societies, and before civil authority, to make\r\narrangements with heads of families, or other emigrants who can unite\r\ntwelve people able to work, and also to stipulate that the government\r\nwill give them a portion of land sufficient to employ twelve persons,\r\nand on which may be raised coffee, cotton, maize, peas and other\r\nvegetables and provisions; and after they have well improved the said\r\nquantity of land which will not be less than thirty-six acres in extent,\r\ngovernment will give a perpetual title to the said land to these twelve\r\npeople, their heirs, and assigns.\r\n\r\n“Article VII.--Those of the emigrants who prefer applying themselves\r\nindividually to the culture of the earth, either by renting lands\r\nalready improved, which they will till, or by working in the field to\r\nshare the produce with the proprietor, must also engage themselves by\r\na legal act that, on arriving in llayti, they will make the above\r\nmentioned {399}arrangements; and this they must do before judges of the\r\npeace; so that, on their arrival here, they will be obliged to apply\r\nthemselves to agriculture, and not be liable to become vagrants.” (1)\r\n\r\nOn these passages the Major reasons thus--\r\n\r\n“In Hayti, even at present, tinder the judicious government of President\r\nBoyer, we find the free and intelligent American Blacks receiving land\r\nfor nothing, having their expenses paid, and the produce of the land to\r\nbe for their own advantage, obliged, by a legal act, to apply themselves\r\nto a kind of labour which is manifestly and clearly intended to better\r\ntheir condition.\r\n\r\n“Why should a free man be thus obliged to act in a manner which the most\r\nignorant person might discover was a duty incumbent on him, and that\r\nthe result would be for his advantage? The legal act and its penalties,\r\nafter such a grant of land, would appear pre-eminently absurd in\r\nEngland.” (2)\r\n\r\nWe, for our own parts, can conceive nothing more preeminently absurd,\r\nthan for a man to quote and comment on what he has never read. This is\r\nclearly the case with the Major. The emigrants who were to be obliged\r\nby a legal act to apply themselves to labour, were not those who were\r\nto receive land for nothing, but those who were to rent it, or to hire\r\nthemselves out as labourers under others.. The Major has applied the\r\nprovisions of the Seventh Article to the class mentioned in the Sixth.\r\nSo disgraceful an instance of carelessness we never saw in any official\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nWhether the President acted well or ill, is not the question. The\r\nprinciple on which he proceeded cannot be mistaken. He was about to\r\nadvance a considerable sum for the purpose of transporting these people\r\nto Hayti. He appears, as far as we can judge from these instructions, to\r\nhave exacted no security from the higher and most respectable class.\r\nBut he thought it probable, we suppose, that many of those idle\r\nand profligate persons who abound in all great cities, and who are\r\npeculiarly likely to abound in a degraded caste, beggars and thieves,\r\nthe refuse of the North American bridewells, might accept his proposals,\r\nmerely that they might live for some months at free costs, and\r\nthen return to their old habits. He therefore naturally required some\r\nassurance that the poorer emigrants intended to support themselves by\r\ntheir industry before he would agree to advance their subsistence.\r\n\r\n     1 Second Tart of Major Moody’s Report, p. 30.\r\n\r\n     2 Ibid, p 32.\r\n\r\nThe {400}Major proceeds thus:--\r\n\r\n“Your Lordship may observe, in the instructions of the President, that\r\nonlv certain modes of rewarding the labour of the free American Black\r\nare mentioned, viz. rentin’; land already improved, working in the field\r\nto share the produce with the labourer, or, by being proprietors of\r\nland, to cultivate on their own account without either rent or purchase,\r\nhaving land from the free gift of the Government.\r\n\r\n“The ordinary mode of rewarding the labourer by the payment of wages.\r\nas in England or the Last Indies, where the country is fully peopled,\r\nis never once mentioned or alluded to by President Boyer, who may\r\nbe fairly supposed to understand the situation of the country which he\r\ngoverns.” (1)\r\n\r\nFor the sake of the Tytians, we hope that Boyer understands the\r\ncountry which he governs better than the Major understands the subject\r\non which he writes. Who before, ever thought of mentioning the renting\r\nof land as a mode of rewarding the labourer? The renting of land is a\r\ntransaction between the proprietor of the soil and the capitalist.\r\nCan Major Moody possibly imagine, that, in any part of the world, the\r\nlabourer, as a labourer, pays rent, or receives it? He surely must\r\nknow, that those emigrants who rented land, must have rented it in the\r\ncapacity, not of labourers, but of capitalists; that they must have\r\npaid the rent out of the profits of their stock, not out of the gains of\r\ntheir labour; that even when a man works on his own account, the gains\r\nof his labour, though not generally called wages, are wages to all\r\nintents and purposes, and though popularly confounded with his profits,\r\nfollow a law altogether different. But Boyer, says Major Moody, never\r\nmentions wages. How can wages be better defined, than as the share of\r\nthe produce allowed to the labourer? Does Major Moody conceive that\r\nwages can be paid only in money, or that money wages represent any thing\r\nbut that share of the produce of which the President speaks? he goes on,\r\nhowever, floundering deeper and deeper in absurdity at every step.\r\n\r\n“In the present constitution of Hayti, as administered by President\r\nBoyer, in “Titre sur l’Lrat Politique des Citoyens,” I find, under the\r\nact, that the rights of citizenship are suspended, as regards domestics\r\nworking for wages (par l’etât de domestique à gages), in that very\r\nrepublican country, where a person, ignorant of the effect of physical\r\ncauses, would naturally conclude that it would be most unjust to deprive\r\na man of his right of citizenship, because he preferred one mode of\r\nsubsisting himself to another, which the Government wished to encourage.”\r\n\r\n     (1) Second Part of Major Moody’s Report, p. 32.\r\n\r\nPhysical {401}causes again! We should like to know whether these\r\nphysical causes operate in France. In the French Constitution of the\r\nyear 1791, we find the following Article.\r\n\r\n“To be an active citizen, it is necessary not to be in a menial\r\nsituation, namely, that of a servant receiving wages.”\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, that this law which, in the opinion of Major Moody,\r\nnothing but the heat of the torrid zone will explain--this law, which\r\nany person, ignorant of physical causes, would consider as grossly\r\nunjust, is copied from the Institutions of a great and enlightened\r\nEuropean nation. AYe can assure him, that a little knowledge of history\r\nis now and then very useful to a person who undertakes to speculate on\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nWe must return for a moment to the North American emigrants. Much\r\nmismanagement seems to have taken place with respect to them. They were\r\nreceived with cordiality, and pampered with the utmost profusion, by\r\nthe liberal inhabitants of Port-au-Prince. They had left a country where\r\nthey had always been treated as the lowest of mankind; they had landed\r\nin a country where they were overwhelmed with caresses and presents.\r\nThe heads of many were turned by the change. Many came from cities,\r\nand, totally unaccustomed to agricultural labour, found themselves\r\ntransported into the midst of an agricultural community. The Government,\r\nwith more generosity than wisdom, suffered them to eat their rations in\r\nidleness. This is a short summary of the narrative of Dr. Dewey, who was\r\nhimself on the spot. He continues thus.\r\n\r\n“Although these and other circumstances damped the ardour of some of the\r\nemigrants, and rendered the in dissatisfied with their situation, yet I\r\nhave uniformly found the industrious and the most respectable, and\r\nsuch as were fitted to be cultivators of the soil, contented with their\r\ncondition and prospects, and convinced that great advantages were put\r\nwithin their reach. By far the greater part of the emigrants I saw were\r\nsatisfied with their change of country, and many were so much pleased\r\nthat they would not return on any consideration, and said, that they\r\nnever felt at home before, that they have never felt what it was to be\r\nin a country where their colour was not despised. But these were such\r\nas went out expecting to meet difficulties and not to live in the\r\ncity; and they are so numerous, and pursuing their course with so much\r\nenterprise, that I feel there is no more reason for surprise at the\r\nindustry and contentment which they exhibit, than at the dissatisfaction\r\nwhich has brought back 200, and will perhaps bring back a few more.” (1)\r\n\r\n     (1) Second Part of Major Moody’s Report, p. 35. 26\r\n\r\nAll {402}this statement the Major quotes as triumphantly as if it were\r\nfavourable to his hypothesis, or as if it were not of itself sufficient\r\nto refute every syllable that he has written. Those who came from towns\r\nshrunk from agricultural labour. Is this a circumstance peculiar to any\r\nclimate? Lei Major Moody try the same experiment in this country with\r\nthe footmen and shopmen of London, and see what success he will have.\r\nBut those who were accustomed to tillage, applied themselves to it\r\nwith vigour; and this though they came from a cold country, and must\r\ntherefore be supposed to have been peculiarly sensible of the influence\r\nof tropical heat. It is clear, therefore, that their desire to better\r\ntheir Condition surmounted that love of repose which, according to the\r\nnew philosophy of labour, can, in warm, fertile, and thinly peopled\r\ncountries, be surmounted only by the fear of punishment.\r\n\r\nWe have now gone through the principal topics of which the Major has\r\ntreated. We have done him more than justice. We have arranged his\r\nchaotic mass of facts and theories; we have frequently translated his\r\nlanguage into English; we have refrained from quoting the exquisitely\r\nridiculous similitudes and allusions with which he has set off his\r\nreasonings; we have repeatedly taken on ourselves the burden of the\r\nproof in cases where, by all the rules of logic, we might have imposed\r\nit on him. Against us, he cannot resort to his ordinary modes of\r\ndefence. He cannot charge us with ignorance of local circumstances,\r\nfor almost all the facts on which we have argued are taken from his own\r\nreport. He cannot sneer at us as pious, benevolent people, misled by a\r\nblind hatred of slavery, eager in the pursuit of a laudable, end, but\r\nignorant of the means by which alone it can be obtained. We have treated\r\nthe question as a question purely scientific. We have reasoned as if we\r\nhad been reasoning, not about men and women, but about spinning-jeanies\r\nand power-looms.\r\n\r\nPoint by point we have refuted his whole theory. We have shown that the\r\nphenomena which he attributes to the atmosphere of the torrid zone, are\r\nfound in the most temperate climates; and that, if coercion be desirable\r\nin the case of the West Indian labourer, the stocks, the branding iron,\r\nand the forty stripes save one, ought to be, without delay introduced\r\ninto England.\r\n\r\nThere {403}are still some parts of the subject on which, if the article\r\nwere not already too long, we should wish to dwell. Coercion, according\r\nto Major Moody, is necessary only in those tropical countries in which\r\nthe population does not press on the means of subsistence. He holds,\r\nthat the multiplication of the species will at length render it\r\nsuperfluous. It would be easy to show that this remedy is incompatible\r\nwith the evil; that the deadly labour, or, as he would call it, the\r\nsteady labour, which the West Indian sugar-planter exacts, destroys life\r\nwith frightful rapidity; that the only colonics in which the slaves\r\nkeep up their numbers are those in which the cultivation of sugar\r\nhas altogether ceased, or has greatly diminished; and that, in those\r\nsettlements in which it is extensively and profitably carried on, the\r\npopulation _decreases_ at a rate which portends its speedy extinction.\r\nTo say, therefore, that the negroes of the sugar colonies must continue\r\nslaves till their numbers shall have greatly increased, is to say, in\r\ndecent and humane phraseology, that they must continue slaves till the\r\nwhole race is exterminated.\r\n\r\nAt some future time we may resume this subject. We may then attempt to\r\nexplain a principle, which, though established by long experience, still\r\nappears to many people paradoxical, namely, that a rise in the price of\r\nsugar, while it renders the slave more valuable, tends at the same time\r\nto abridge his life. We may then also endeavour to show how completely\r\nsuch a system is at variance with the principles on which alone\r\ncolonization can be defended. When a great country scatters, in some\r\nvast and fertile wilderness, the seeds of a civilized population,\r\nfosters and protects the infant community through the period of\r\nhelplessness, and rears it into a mighty nation, the measure, is not\r\nonly beneficial to mankind, but may answer as a mercantile speculation.\r\nThe sums which were advanced for the support and defence of a few\r\nemigrants, struggling with difficulties and surrounded by dangers,\r\nare repaid by an extensive and lucrative commerce with flourishing and\r\npopulous regions, which, but for those emigrants, would still have been\r\ninhabited only by savages and beasts of prey. Thus, in spite of all the\r\nerrors which our ancestors committed, both during their connexion with\r\nthe North American provinces, and at the time of separation, we are\r\ninclined to think that England has, on the whole, obtained great\r\nbenefits from them. From our dominions in New South Wales, if\r\njudiciously governed, great advantages may {404}also be derived. But\r\nwhat advantage can we derive from colonies in which the population,\r\nunder a cruel and grinding system of oppression, is rapidly wasting\r\naway? The planter, we must suppose, knows his own interest. If he\r\nchooses to wear his slave to death by exacting from him an exorbitant\r\nquantity of work, we must suppose that he gains more by the work than he\r\nloses by the death.\r\n\r\nBut his capital is not the only capital which has been sunk in those\r\ncountries. Who is to repay the English nation for the treasure which has\r\nbeen expended in governing and defending them? If we had made Jamaica\r\nwhat we have made Massachusetts, if we had raised up in Guiana a\r\npopulation like that of New York, we should indeed have been repaid. But\r\nof such a result under the present system there is no hope. It is not\r\nimprobable that some who are now alive may see the last negro disappear\r\nfrom our Transatlantic possessions. After having squandered a sum,\r\nwhich, if judiciously employed, might have called into existence a\r\ngreat, rich, and enlightened people, which might have spread our arts,\r\nour laws, and our language from the banks of the Maragnon to the Mexican\r\nsea, we shall again leave our territories deserts as we found them,\r\nwithout one memorial to prove that a civilized man ever set foot on\r\ntheir shores.\r\n\r\nBut we must absolutely conclude. This subject is far too extensive to\r\nbe fully discussed at present; and we have another duty to perform. With\r\nthe Major we began, and with the Major we mean to end. That he is a very\r\nrespectable officer, and a very respectable man, we have no reason to\r\ndoubt. But we do, with all seriousness and good-will assure him, that\r\nhe has no vocation to be a philosopher. If he has set his heart on\r\nconstructing theories, we are sorry for him; for we cannot flatter him\r\nwith the faintest hope of success. A few undigested facts, and a few\r\nlong words that mean nothing, are but a slender stock for so extensive a\r\nbusiness. For a time he may play the politician among philosophers, and\r\nthe philosopher among politicians. He may bewilder speculative men with\r\nthe cant of office, and practical men with the cant of metaphysics.\r\nBut at last he must find his level. He is very fit to be a collector of\r\nfacts, a purveyor of details to those who know how to reason on them;\r\nbut he is no more qualified to speculate on political science, than a\r\nbricklayer is to rival Palladio, or a nurseryman to confute Linuæus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION. (1)\r\n\r\n(_Edinburgh Review_,) June, 1827.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe {405}ought to apologize to our readers for prefixing to this article\r\nthe name of such a publication. The two numbers which lie on our table\r\ncontain nothing which could be endured, even at a dinner of the Pitt\r\nClub, unless, as the newspapers express it, the hilarity had been\r\ncontinued to a very late hour. We have met, we confess, with nobody\r\nwho has ever seen them; and, should our account excite any curiosity\r\nrespecting them, we fear that an application to the booksellers will\r\nalready be too late. Some tidings of them may perhaps be obtained from\r\nthe trunk-makers. In order to console our readers, however, under this\r\ndisappointment, we will venture to assure them, that the only subject on\r\nwhich the reasonings of these Antijacobin Reviewers throw any light,\r\nis one in which we take very little interest--the state of their own\r\nunderstandings; and that the only feeling which their pathetic appeals\r\nhave excited in us, is that of deep regret for our four shillings, which\r\nare gone and will return no more.\r\n\r\nIt is not a very cleanly, or a very agreeable task, to rake up from the\r\nkennels of oblivion the remains of drowned abortions, which have never\r\nopened their eyes on the day, or even been heard to whimper, but have\r\nbeen at once transferred from the filth in which they were littered, to\r\nthe filth with which they are to rot. But unhappily we have no choice.\r\nBad as this work is, it is quite as good as any which has appeared\r\nagainst the present administration. We have looked everywhere, without\r\nbeing able to find any antagonist who can possibly be as much ashamed of\r\ndefeat as we shall be of victory.\r\n\r\n     (1) _The New Antijacobin Review_.--Nos. I. and II. 8vo.\r\n     London, 1827.\r\n\r\nThe {406}manner in which the influence of the press has, at this crisis,\r\nbeen exercised, is indeed, very remarkable. All the talent has been on\r\none side. With an unanimity which, as Lord Londonderry wisely supposes,\r\ncan be ascribed only to a dexterous use of the secret-service money, the\r\nable and respectable journals of the metropolis have all supported the\r\nnew government. It has been attacked, on the other hand, by writers who\r\nmake every cause which they espouse despicable or odious,--by one paper\r\nwhich owes all its notoriety to its reports of the slang uttered by\r\ndrunken lads who are brought to Bow Street for breaking windows--by\r\nanother, which barely contrives to subsist on intelligence from butlers,\r\nand advertisements from perfumers. With these are joined all the\r\nscribblers who rest their claim to orthodoxy and loyalty on the\r\nperfection to which they have carried the arts of ribaldry and slander.\r\nWhat part these gentlemen would take in the present contest, seemed\r\nat first doubtful. We feared, for a moment, that their servility might\r\noverpower their malignity, and that they would be even more inclined to\r\nflatter the powerful than to calumniate the innocent. It turn-out that\r\nwe were mistaken; and we are most thankful for it. They have been kind\r\nenough to spare us the discredit of their alliance. We know not how we\r\nshould have borne to be of the same party with them. It is bad enough,\r\nGod knows, to be of the same species.\r\n\r\nThe writers of the book before us, who are also, we believe, the great\r\nmajority of its readers, can scarcely be said to belong to this class.\r\nThey rather resemble those snakes with which Indian jugglers perform\r\nso many curious tricks: The bags of venom are left, but the teeth are\r\nextracted. That they might omit nothing tending to make them ridiculous.\r\nthey have adopted a title on which no judicious writer would have\r\nventured; and challenged comparison with one of the most ingenious and\r\namusing volumes in our language. Whether they have assumed this name on\r\nthe principle which influenced Mr. Shandy in christening his children,\r\nor from a whim similar to that which induced the proprietors of the most\r\nfrightful Hottentot that ever lived, to give her the name of Venus,\r\nwe shall not pretend to decide; but we would seriously advise them\r\nto consider, whether it is for their interest, that people should be\r\nreminded of the celebrated imitations of Darwin and Kotzebue, while they\r\nare reading {407}such parodies on the Bible as the following:--“In those\r\ndays, a strange person shall appear in the land, and he shall cry to the\r\npeople. Behold, I am possessed by the Demon of Ultra-Liberalism; I have\r\nreceived the gift of incoherence; I am a political philosopher, and a\r\nprofessor of paradoxes.”\r\n\r\nWe would also, with great respect, ask the gentleman who has lampooned\r\nMr. Canning in such Drydenian couplets as this:\r\n\r\n                   “When he said if they would but let him in,\r\n\r\n                   He would never try to turn them out again,”\r\n\r\nwhether his performance gains much by being compared with New Morality?\r\nand, indeed, whether such satire as this is likely to make anybody laugh\r\nbut himself, or to make anybody wince but his publisher?\r\n\r\nBut we must take leave of the _New Antijacobin Review_; and we do so,\r\nhoping that we have secured the gratitude of its conductors. We once\r\nheard a schoolboy relate, with evident satisfaction and pride, that he\r\nhad been horsewhipped by a Duke: we trust that our present condescension\r\nwill be as highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nBut it is not for the purpose of making a scarecrow of a ridiculous\r\npublication, that we address our readers at the present important\r\ncrisis. We are convinced, that the cause of the present Ministers is\r\nthe cause of liberty, the cause of toleration, the cause of political\r\nscience,--the cause of the people, who are entitled to expect from\r\ntheir wisdom and liberality many judicious reforms,--the cause of the\r\naristocracy, who, unless those reforms be adopted, must inevitably be\r\nthe victims of a violent and desolating revolution. We are convinced,\r\nthat the government of the country was never intrusted to men who more\r\nthoroughly understood its interest, or were more sincerely disposed to\r\npromote it--to men who, in forming their arrangements, thought so much\r\nof what they could _do_, and so little of what they could _get_. On\r\nthe other side, we see a party which, for ignorance, intemperance, and\r\ninconsistency, has no parallel in our annals,--which, as an Opposition,\r\nwe really think, is a scandal to the nation, and, as a Ministry, would\r\nspeedily be its ruin. Under these circumstances, we think it our duty to\r\ngive our best support to those with whose power are inseparably bound\r\nup all the dearest interests of the community,--the freedom {408}of\r\nworship, of discussion, and of trade,--our honour abroad, and our\r\ntranquillity at home.\r\n\r\nIn undertaking the defence of the Ministers, we feel ourselves\r\nenbarrassed by one difficulty: we are unable to comprehend distinctly of\r\nwhat they are accused. A statement of facts may be contradicted; but the\r\ngentlemen of the Opposition do not deal in statements. Reasonings may\r\nbe refuted; but the gentlemen of the Opposition do not reason. There is\r\nsomething impassive and elastic about their dulness, on which all the\r\nweapons of controversy are thrown away. It makes no resistance, and\r\nreceives no impression. To argue with it, is like stabbing the water,\r\nor cudgelling a woolpack. Buonaparte is said to have remarked, that the\r\nEnglish soldiers at Waterloo did not know when they were beaten. The\r\nDuke of Wellington, equally fortunate in polities and in war, has\r\nthe rare felicity of being supported a second time by a force of\r\nthis description,--men whose desperate hardihood in argument sets all\r\nassailants at defiance,--who fight on, though borne down on every side\r\nby overwhelming proofs, rush enthusiastically into the mouth of an\r\nabsurdity, or stake themselves with cool intrepidity on the horn of a\r\ndilemma. We doubt whether this unconquerable pertinacity be quite as\r\nhonourable in debate as in battle; but we are sure, that it is a very\r\ndifficult task for persons trained in the old school of logical tactics\r\nto contend with antagonists who possess such a quality.\r\n\r\nThe species of argument in which the members of the Opposition appear\r\nchiefly to excel, is that of which the Marquis, in the _Critique de\r\nl’Ecole des Femmes_, showed himself so great a master:--\r\n\r\n“Tarte, à la creme--morbleu, tarte à la creme!”\r\n\r\n“Hé bien, que veux tu dire, tarte à la erême?”\r\n\r\n“Parbleu, tarte à la crème, chevalier!”\r\n\r\n“Mais encore?”\r\n\r\n“Tarte à la crème!”\r\n\r\n“Dî-nous un peu tes raisons.”\r\n\r\n“Tarte à la crème!”\r\n\r\n“Mais il faut expliquer ta pensée, ce me semble.”\r\n\r\n“Tarte à la crème, Madame.”\r\n\r\n“Que trouvez-vouz là à redire?”\r\n\r\n“Moi, rien;--tarte à la crème!” With equal taste and judgment,\r\nthe writers and speakers of the Opposition repeat their favourite\r\nphrases,--“deserted principles,” “unnatural coalition,” “base love of\r\noffice.” They have not, we must allow, been unfortunate in their choice\r\nof a topic. The English are but too much accustomed to consider\r\nevery public virtue as comprised in consistency; and {409}the name of\r\ncoalition has to many ears a startling and ominous sound. Of all the\r\ncharges brought, against the Ministry, this alone, as far as we can\r\ndiscover, has any meaning; and even to this we can allow no force.\r\n\r\nTo condemn coalitions in the abstract, is manifestly absurd: Since in a\r\npopular government, no good can be done without concert, and no\r\nconcert can be obtained without compromise. Those who will not stoop to\r\ncompliances which the condition of human nature renders necessary, are\r\nfitter to be hermits than to be statesmen. Their virtue, like gold which\r\nis too refined to be coined, must be alloyed before it can be of any\r\nuse in the commerce of society. But most peculiarly inconsistent and\r\nunreasonable is the conduct of those who, while they profess strong\r\nParty-feelings, yet entertain a superstitious aversion to Coalitions.\r\nEvery argument which can be urged against coalitions, as such, is also\r\nan argument against party connexions. Every argument by which party\r\nconnexions can be defended, is a defence of coalitions. What coalitions\r\nare to parties, parties are to individuals. The members of a party,\r\nin order to promote some great common object, consent to wave all\r\nsubordinate considerations:--That they may co-operate with more effect\r\nwhere they agree, they contrive, by reciprocal concessions, to preserve\r\nthe semblance of unanimity, even where they differ. Men are not thought\r\nunprincipled for acting thus; because it is evident that without such\r\nmutual sacrifices of individual opinions, no government can be formed,\r\nnor any important measures carried, in a world of which the inhabitants\r\nresemble each other so little, and depend on each other so much,--in\r\nwhich there are as many varieties of mind as of countenance, yet in\r\nwhich great effects can be produced only by combined exertions. We must\r\nextend the same indulgence to a coalition between parties. If they agree\r\non every important practical question, if they differ only about objects\r\nwhich are either insignificant or unattainable, no party man can, on his\r\nown principles, blame them for uniting. These doctrines, like all other\r\ndoctrines, may be pushed to extremes by the injudicious, or employed\r\nby the designing as a pretext for profligacy. But that they are not in\r\nthemselves unreasonable or pernicious, the whole history of our country\r\nproves.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution itself was the fruit of a coalition between parties,\r\n{410}which had attacked each other with a fury unknown in later times.\r\nIn the preceding generation their hostility had covered England with\r\nblood and mourning. They had subsequently exchanged the sword for the\r\naxe: But their enmity was not the less deadly because it was disguised\r\nby the forms of justice. By popular clamour, by infamous testimony, by\r\nperverted law, they had shed innocent and noble blood like water.\r\nYet all their animosities were forgotten in the sense of their common\r\ndanger. Whigs and Tories signed the same associations. Bishops and\r\nfield-preachers thundered out the same exhortations. The doctors of\r\nOxford and the goldsmiths of London sent in their plate with equal zeal.\r\nThe administration which, in the reign of Queen Anne, defended Holland,\r\nrescued Germany, conquered Flanders, dismembered the monarchy of Spain,\r\nshook the throne of France, vindicated the independence of Europe, and\r\nestablished the empire of the sea, was formed by a junction between men\r\nwho had many political contests and many personal injuries to forget.\r\nSomers had been a member of the ministry which had sent Marlborough to\r\nthe Tower. Marlborough had assisted in harassing Somers by a vexatious\r\nimpeachment. But would these great men have acted wisely or honourably\r\nif, on such grounds, they had refused to serve their country in concert?\r\nThe Cabinet which conducted the seven years’ war with such distinguished\r\nability and success, was composed of members who had a short time before\r\nbeen leaders of opposite parties. The Union between Fox and North is,\r\nwe own, condemned by that argument which it will never be possible\r\nto answer in a manner satisfactory to the great body of mankind,--the\r\nargument from the event. But we should feel some surprise at the dislike\r\nwhich some zealous Pittites affect to entertain for coalitions, did we\r\nnot know that a Pittite means, in the phraseology of the present day, a\r\nperson who differs from Mr. Pitt on every subject of importance. There\r\nare, indeed, two Pitts,--the real and the imaginary,--the Pitt of\r\nhistory, a Parliamentary reformer, an enemy of the Test and Corporation\r\nActs, an advocate of Catholic Emancipation and of free trade,--and the\r\ncanonized Pitt of the legend,--as unlike to his namesake as Virgil the\r\nmagician to Virgil the poet, or St. James the slayer of Moors to St.\r\nJames the fisherman. What may have been the opinions of that unreal\r\nbeing whose birthday {411}is celebrated by libations to Protestant\r\nAscendency, on the subject, of coalitions, we leave it to his veracious\r\nhagiographers, Lord Eldon and Lord Westmoreland, to determine. The\r\nsentiments of the real Mr. Pitt may be easily ascertained from\r\nhis conduct. At the time of the revolutionary war he admitted to\r\nparticipation in his power those who had formerly been his most\r\ndetermined enemies. In 1804 he connected himself with Mr. Fox, and,\r\non his return to office, attempted to procure a high situation in the\r\ngovernment for his new ally. One more instance we will mention, which\r\nhas little weight with us, but which ought to have much weight with\r\nour opponents. They talk of Mr. Pitt;--but the real object of their\r\nadoration is unquestionably the late Mr. Percival, a gentleman whose\r\nacknowledged private virtues were but a poor compensation to his country\r\nfor the narrowness and feebleness of his policy. In 1809 that minister\r\noffered to serve, not only _with_ Lord Grenville and Earl Grey, but even\r\n_under_ them. No approximation of feeling between the members of the\r\ngovernment and their opponents had then taken place: there had not even\r\nbeen the slightest remission of hostilities. On no question of\r\nforeign or domestic policy were the two parties agreed. Yet under such\r\ncircumstances was this proposition made. It was, as might have been\r\nanticipated, rejected by the Whigs and derided by the country. But the\r\nrecollection of it ought certainly to prevent those who concurred in\r\nit, and their devoted followers, from talking of the baseness and\r\nselfishness of coalitions.\r\n\r\nThese general reasonings, it may be said, are superfluous. It is not to\r\ncoalitions in the abstract, but to the present coalition in particular,\r\nthat objection is made. We answer, that an attack on the present\r\ncoalition can only be maintained by succeeding in the most signal way in\r\nan attack on coalitions in the abstract. For never has the world seen,\r\nand never is it likely to see, a junction between parties agreeing on\r\nso many points, and differing on so few. The Whigs and the supporters of\r\nMr. Canning were united in principle. They were separated only by names,\r\nby badges, and by recollections. Opposition, on such grounds as these,\r\nwould have been disgraceful to English statesmen. It would have been\r\nas unreasonable and as profligate as the disputes of the blue and green\r\nfactions in the Hippodrome of Constantinople. {412}One man admires Mr.\r\nPitt, and another Mr. Fox. Are they therefore never to act together?\r\nMr. Pitt and Mr. Fox were themselves willing to coalesce while they were\r\nalive; and it would therefore be strange, if, after they have been lying\r\nfor twenty years in Westminster Abbey, their names should keep parties\r\nasunder. One man approves of the revolutionary war. Another thinks it\r\nunjust and impolitic. But the war is over. It is now merely a matter\r\nof historical controversy. And the statesman who should require his\r\ncolleagues to adopt his confession of faith respecting it, would act\r\nas madly as Don Quixote when he went to blows with Cardenio about the\r\nchastity of Queen Madasima. On these points, and on many such points as\r\nthese, our new Ministers, no doubt, hold different opinions. They may\r\nalso, for aught we know, hold different opinions about the title of\r\nPerkin Warbeck, and the genuineness of the [Greek] But we shall hardly,\r\non such grounds as these, pronounce their union a sacrifice of principle\r\nto place.\r\n\r\nIt is, in short, of very little importance whether the parties which\r\nhave lately united entertain the same sentiments respecting things\r\nwhich have been done and cannot be undone. It is of as little importance\r\nwhether they have adopted the same speculative notions on questions\r\nwhich could not at present be brought forward with the slightest chance\r\nof success, and which, in all probability, they will never be required\r\nto discuss. The real questions are these: Do they differ as to the\r\npolicy which present circumstances require? Or is any great cause,\r\nwhich they may have heretofore espoused, placed in a more unfavourable\r\nsituation by their junction?\r\n\r\nThat this is the ease, no person has even attempted to prove. Bold\r\nassertions have indeed been made by a class of writers, who seem to\r\nthink that their readers are as completely destitute of memory as they\r\nthemselves are of shame. For the last two years they have been abusing\r\nMr. Canning for adopting the principles of the Whigs; and they now\r\nclaim that, in joining Mr. Canning, the Whigs have abandoned all their\r\nprinciples! “The Whigs,” said one of their writers, but a few months\r\nago, “are exercising more real power by means of the present Ministers\r\nthan if they were themselves in office.”\r\n\r\n“The Ministers,” said another, “are no longer Tories. What they call\r\nconciliation is mere Whiggism.” {413}A third observed that the jest of\r\nMr. Canning about Dennis and his thunder had lost all its point, and\r\nthat it was a lamentable truth, that all the late measures of the\r\ngovernment seemed to have been dictated by the Whigs. Yet these very\r\nauthors have now the effrontery to assert that the Whigs could not\r\npossibly support Mr. Canning without renouncing every opinion which they\r\nhad formerly professed.\r\n\r\nWe confidently affirm, on the other hand, that no principle whatever\r\nhas been sacrificed. With respect to our foreign relations and our\r\ncommercial policy, the two parties have for years been perfectly agreed.\r\nOn the Catholic question the views of the Whigs are the same with those\r\nof a great majority of their new colleagues. It is true that, in an\r\nillustrious assembly, which was formerly suspected of great dulness and\r\ngreat decorum, and which has of late effectually redeemed itself from\r\none half of the reproach, the conduct of the Whigs towards the Catholics\r\nhas been represented in a very unfavourable light. The arguments\r\nemployed against them belong, we suppose, to a kind of logic which the\r\nprivileged orders alone are qualified to use, and which, with their\r\nother constitutional distinctions, we earnestly pray that they may long\r\nkeep to themselves. An ingenious member of this assembly is said to have\r\nobserved, that the Protestant alarmists were bound to oppose the new\r\nMinisters as friends to the Catholic cause, and that the Catholics ought\r\nto oppose them as traitors to the same cause. He reminded the former of\r\nthe infinite danger of trusting power to a Cabinet composed principally\r\nof persons favourable to emancipation: and, at the same time, pointed\r\nthe indignation of the latter against the perfidy of the pretended\r\nfriends who had not stipulated that emancipation should be made a\r\nministerial measure! We cannot sufficiently admire the exquisite\r\ndexterity of an assailant who, in the same breath, blames the same\r\npeople for doing, and for _not_ doing the same thing. To ordinary\r\nplebeian understandings we should think it undeniable that the Catholic\r\nquestion must be now--either in the same situation in which it was\r\nbefore the late change; or it must have lost; or it must have gained. If\r\nit have gained, the Whigs are justified; if it have lost, the enemies\r\nof the claims ought zealously to support the new government; if it be\r\nexactly where it was before, no person who acted with Lord Liverpool\r\ncan, on this ground, consistently oppose Mr. Canning.\r\n\r\nIn {414}this view, indeed, the cause of the Whigs is the cause of the\r\nministers who have seceded from the Cabinet. Both parties have put in\r\nthe same plea; and both must be acquitted or condemned together. If it\r\nbe allowed that the elevation of Mr. Canning was not an event favourable\r\nto the Catholic cause, the Whigs will certainly stand convicted of\r\ninconsistency. But at the same time, the only argument by which the\r\nex-Ministers have attempted to vindicate their secession, must fall to\r\nthe ground; and it will be difficult to consider that proceeding in any\r\nother light than as a factious expedient to which they have resorted, in\r\norder to embarrass a colleague whom they envied. If, on the other hand,\r\nthe effect of the late change were such, that it became the duty of\r\nthose who objected to Catholic Emancipation, to decline all connexion\r\nwith the Ministry, it must surely have become, at the same time, the\r\nduty of the friends of Emancipation to support the Ministry. Those who\r\ntake the one ground, when their object is to vindicate the seceders, and\r\nthe other, when their object is to blacken the Whigs, who, in the same\r\nspeech, do not scruple to represent the Catholic cause as triumphant and\r\nas hopeless, may, we fear, draw down some ridicule on themselves, but\r\nwill hardly convince the country. But why did not the Whigs stipulate\r\nthat some proposition for the relief of the Catholics should be\r\nimmediately brought forward, and supported by the whole influence of\r\nthe Administration? We answer, simply because they could not obtain\r\nsuch conditions, and because, by insisting upon them, they would have\r\nirreparably injured those whom they meant to serve, and have thrown the\r\ngovernment into the hands of men who would have employed all its power\r\nand patronage to support a system which, we do not scruple to say, is\r\nthe shame of England, and the curse of Ireland. By the course which they\r\nhave taken, they have insured to the sister kingdom every alleviation\r\nwhich its calamities can receive from the lenient administration of an\r\noppressive system. Under their government, it will at least be no man’s\r\ninterest to espouse the side of bigotry. Truth will have a fair chance\r\nagainst prejudice. And whenever the dislike with which the majority of\r\nthe English people regard the Catholic claims shall have been overcome\r\nby discussion, no other obstacle will remain to be surmounted.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the Catholics have, indeed, too long kept out {415}of\r\nsight the real difficulty which impedes the progress of all measures\r\nfor their relief. There has been a nervous reluctance--perhaps a\r\nnatural unwillingness, to approach this subject. Yet it is of the utmost\r\nimportance that it should at last be fully understood. The difficulty,\r\nwe believe, is neither with the King nor with the Cabinet,--neither with\r\nthe Commons nor with the Lords. It is with the People of England;\r\nand not with the corrupt, not with the servile, not with the rude and\r\nuneducated, not with the dissolute and turbulent, but with the great\r\nbody of the middling orders;--of those who live in comfort, and have\r\nreceived some instruction. Of the higher classes, the decided majority\r\nis, beyond all dispute, with the Catholics. The lower classes care\r\nnothing at all about the question. It is among those whose influence is\r\ngenerally exerted for the most salutary purposes,--among those from\r\nwhom liberal statesmen have, in general, received the strongest\r\nsupport,--among those who feel the deepest detestation of oppression and\r\ncorruption, that erroneous opinions on this subject are most frequent.\r\nA faction with which they have no other feeling in common, has, on\r\nthis question, repeatedly made them its tools, and has diverted their\r\nattention more than once from its own folly and profligacy, by raising\r\nthe cry of No Popery. They have espoused their opinions, not from want\r\nof honesty, not from want of sense, but simply from want of information\r\nand reflection. They think as the most enlightened men in England\r\nthought seventy or eighty years ago. Pulteney and Pelham would no\r\nmore have given political power to Papists than to ourang-outangs. A\r\nproposition for mitigating the severity of the penal laws would, in\r\ntheir time, have been received with suspicion. The full discussion which\r\nthe subject has since undergone, has produced a great change. Among\r\nintelligent men in that rank of life from which our ministers and\r\nthe members of our legislature are selected, the feeling in favour\r\nof concession is strong and general. But, unfortunately, sufficient\r\nattention has not been paid to a lower, but most influential and\r\nrespectable class. The friends of the Catholic claims, content with\r\nnumbering in their ranks all the most distinguished statesmen of two\r\ngenerations, proud of lists of minorities and majorities adorned\r\nby every name which commands the respect of the country, have not\r\nsufficiently excited themselves to {416}combat popular prejudices.\r\nPamphlets against Emancipation are circulated, and no answers appear.\r\nSermons are preached against it, and no pains are taken to obliterate\r\nthe impression. The rector carries a petition round to every\r\nshop-keeper and every farmer in his parish, talks of Smith-field and\r\nthe inquisition, Bishop Bonner and Judge Jeffries. No person takes the\r\ntrouble to canvass on the other side. At an election, the candidate who\r\nis favourable to the Catholic claims, is almost always content to stand\r\non the defensive, he shrinks from the odium of a bold avowal. While his\r\nantagonist asserts and reviles, he palliates, evades, and distinguishes.\r\nhe is unwilling to give a pledge: he has not made up his mind: he hopes\r\nthat adequate securities for the Church may be obtained: he will wait\r\nto see how the Catholic States of South America behave themselves! And\r\nthus, as fast as he can, he gets away from the obnoxious subject, to\r\nretrenchment, reform, or negro slavery. If such a man succeeds, his vote\r\ndoes not benefit the Catholics half so much as his shuffling injures\r\nthem. How can the people understand the question, when those whose\r\nbusiness it is to enlighten them, will not state it to them plainly?\r\nIs it strange that they should dislike a cause of which almost all its\r\nadvocates seem to be ashamed? If, at the late election, all our publie\r\nmen who are favourable to Emancipation had dared to speak out, had\r\nintroduced the subject of their own accord, and discussed it day after\r\nday, they might have lost a few votes; they might have been compelled\r\nto face a few dead cats; but they would have put down the prejudice\r\neffectually. Five or six friends of the claims might have been unseated,\r\nbut the claims would have been carried.\r\n\r\nThe popular aversion to them is an honest aversion; according to the\r\nmeasure of knowledge which the people possess, it is a just aversion.\r\nIt has been reasoned down wherever the experiment has been fearlessly\r\ntried. It may be reasoned down everywhere. The war should be carried\r\non in every quarter. No misrepresentation should be suffered to pass\r\nunrefuted. When a silly letter from Philo-Melancthon, or Anti-Doyle,\r\nabout the Coronation Oath, or divided allegiance, makes its appearance\r\nin the corner of a provincial newspaper, it will not do merely to\r\nsay, “What stuff!” We must remember that such statements constantly\r\nreiterated, and seldom answered, will assuredly be believed.\r\n\r\nPlain, {417}spirited, moderate treatises on the subject, should find\r\ntheir way into every cottage;--not such rancorous nonsense as that for\r\nwhich the Catholics formerly contracted with the fiercest and basest\r\nlibeller of the age, the apostate politician, the fraudulent debtor, the\r\nungrateful friend, whom England has twice spewed out to America; whom\r\nAmerica, though far from squeamish, has twice vomited back to England.\r\nThey will not, they may be assured, serve their cause by pouring forth\r\nunmeasured abuse on men whose memory is justly dear to the hearts of\r\na great people;--men mighty even in their weaknesses, and wise even in\r\ntheir fanaticism;--the goodly fellowship of our reformers,--the noble\r\narmy of our martyrs. Their scandal about Queen Elizabeth, and their\r\nwood-cuts of the devil whispering in the ear of John Fox, will produce\r\nnothing but disgust. They must conduct the controversy with good sense\r\nand good temper, and there cannot be the slightest doubt of the issue.\r\nBut of this they may be fully assured, that, while the general feeling\r\nof the Nation remains unchanged, a Ministry which should stake its\r\nexistence on the success of their claims, would ruin itself, without\r\nbenefiting them.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Catholics, on the present occasion, deserves the\r\nhighest praise. They have shown that experience has at last taught them\r\nto know their enemies from their friends. Indeed there are few scenes in\r\nthis tragicomic world of ours more amusing than that which the leaders\r\nof the Opposition are now performing. The very men who have so long\r\nobstructed Emancipation,---who have stirred up the public feeling in\r\nEngland against Emancipation,--who, in fine, have just resigned their\r\noffices, because a supporter of Emancipation was placed at the head of\r\nthe government,--are now weeping over the disappointed hopes of the\r\npoor Papists, and execrating the perfidious Whigs who have taken office\r\nwithout stipulating for their relief! The Catholics are, in the mean\r\ntime, in the highest spirits, congratulating themselves on the success\r\nof their old friends, and laughing at the condoling visages of their new\r\nchampions.\r\n\r\nSomething not very dissimilar is taking place with respect to\r\nParliamentary Reform. The reformers are delighted with the new Ministry.\r\nTheir opponents are trying to convince them that they ought to be\r\ndissatisfied with it. The Whigs, we suppose, ought to have insisted that\r\nReform should {418}be made a Ministerial measure. We will not at present\r\ninquire whether they have, as a body, ever declared any decided opinion\r\non the subject. A much shorter answer will suffice, he Reform good or\r\nbad, it is at present evidently unattainable. No man can, by coming into\r\noffice, or by going out of office, either effect it or prevent it. As we\r\nare arguing with people who are more influenced by one name than by ten\r\nreasons, we will remind them of the conduct pursued by Mr. Pitt with\r\nregard to this question. At the very time when he publicly pledged\r\nhimself to use his whole power “_as a man and as a minister, honestly\r\nand boldly_” to carry a proposition of Parliamentary Reform, he was\r\nsitting in the same Cabinet with persons decidedly hostile to every\r\nmeasure of the kind. At the present juncture, we own that we should\r\nthink it as absurd in any man to decline office for the sake of this\r\nobject, as it would have been in Sir Thomas More to refuse the Great\r\nSeal, because he could not introduce all the institutions of Utopia into\r\nEngland. The world would be in a wretched state indeed, if no person\r\nwere to accept of power, under a form of government which he thinks\r\nsusceptible of improvement. The effect of such scrupulosity would be,\r\nthat the best and wisest men would always be out of place; that all\r\nauthority would be committed to those who might be too stupid or too\r\nselfish to see abuses in any system by which they could profit, and who,\r\nby their follies and vices, would aggravate all the evils springing from\r\ndefective institutions.\r\n\r\nBut were we to admit the truth of every charge which personal enemies\r\nor professional slanderers have brought against the present ministers\r\nof the Crown, were we to admit that they had abandoned their principles,\r\nthat they had betrayed the Catholics and the Reformers, it would still\r\nremain to be considered, whether we might not change for the worse. We\r\ntrust in God that there is no danger. We think that this country\r\nnever will, never can, be subjected to the rule of a party so weak, so\r\nviolent, so ostentatiously selfish, as that which is now in Opposition.\r\nHas the Cabinet been formed by a coalition? How, let us ask, has the\r\nOpposition been formed? Is it not composed of men who have, all their\r\nlives, been thwarting and abusing each other, Jacobins, Whigs, Tories,\r\nfriends of Catholic Emancipation, enemies of Catholic Emancipation,--men\r\nunited only by their common {419}love of high rents, by their common\r\nenvy of superior abilities, by their common wish to depress the people\r\nand to dictate to the throne? Did Lord Lansdowne at any time differ so\r\nwidely from Mr. Canning as Lord Redesdale from Lord Lauderdale--sometime\r\nneedle-maker, and candidate for the shrievalty of London? Are the\r\nMinisters charged with deserting their opinions? and can we find no\r\ninstances of miraculous conversion on the left of the woolsack? What\r\nwas the influence which transformed the _Friend of the People_ into an\r\naristocrat, “resolved to stand or fall with his order?” Whence was\r\nthe sudden illumination, which at once disclosed to all the discarded\r\nMinisters the imperfections of the Corn Bill? Let us suppose that the\r\nWhigs had, as a party, brought forward some great measure before the\r\nlate changes, that they had carried it through the Commons, that they\r\nhad sent it up, with the fairest prospect of success, to the Lords, and\r\nthat they had then, in order to gratify Mr. Canning, consented, in the\r\nface of all their previous declarations, to defeat it, what a tempest of\r\nexecration and derision would have burst upon them! Yet the conduct of\r\nthe ex-Ministers, according to the best lights we can obtain upon it,\r\nwas even more culpable than this. Not content with doing a bad thing,\r\nthey did it in the worst way. The bill which had been prepared by the\r\nleader for whom they professed boundless veneration, which had been\r\nbrought in under their own sanction, which, as they positively declared,\r\nhad received their fullest consideration, which one of themselves had\r\nundertaken to conduct through the House of Lords, that very bill they\r\ncontrived to defeat:--and, in the act of defeating it, they attempted\r\nto lay upon the colleagues whom they had deserted, the burden of public\r\nresentment which they alone had incurred. We would speak with indulgence\r\nof men who had done their country noble service before--and of many of\r\nwhom, individually, it must be impossible to think otherwise than\r\nwith respect. But the scene lately passed in that great assembly has\r\nafflicted and disgusted the country at large; and it is not the least\r\nof its evil consequences, that it has lessened in the public estimation,\r\nnot only a body which ought always to be looked up to with respect, but\r\nmany individuals of whose motives we cannot bring ourselves to judge\r\nunfavourably, and from whose high qualities we trust the country may\r\nyet receive {420}both benefit and honour. Mr. Peel fortunately did not\r\nexpose himself quite as effectually as his associates; though we regret\r\nthat the tone he adopted was so undecided and equivocal. It was not for\r\nhim to pronounce any judgment on the wisdom of their conduct. He was\r\nfully convinced of the purity of their motives. And finally it was the\r\neighteenth of June!--a day on which, it seems, the Duke of Wellington is\r\nprivileged to commit all sorts of mischief with impunity to the end of\r\nhis life. The Duke of Wellington, however, though the part which he took\r\nwas unfortunately prominent, seems to have been comparatively innocent.\r\nHe might not, while in office, have paid much attention to the measure\r\nin its original form. He might not have understood the real nature of\r\nhis own unlucky amendment. But what were the motives of Earl Bathurst?\r\nOr where were they when he undertook the care of the bill in its former\r\nshape? Nothing had been changed since, excepting his own situation.\r\nAnd it would be the very madness of charity to believe, that, if he had\r\nstill been a colleague of Lord Liverpool, or had been able to come to\r\nterms with Mr. Canning, he would have pursued such a line of conduct.\r\nCulpably as all his coadjutors have acted in this transaction, his share\r\nof it is the most indefensible.\r\n\r\nAnd it is for these men,--for men who, before they have been two months\r\nout of office, have retracted the declarations which they made on a\r\nmost important subject just before they quitted office,--that we are\r\nto discard the present ministers as inconsistent and unprincipled! And\r\nthese men are the idols of those who entertain so virtuous a loathing\r\nfor unnatural coalitions, and base compromises. These men think\r\nthemselves entitled to boast of the purity of their public virtues,\r\nand to repel, with indignant amazement, any imputation of interested or\r\nfactious motives.\r\n\r\nWe dwell long on this event; because it is one which enables the country\r\nto estimate correctly the practical principles of those who, if the\r\npresent ministers should fall, will assuredly take their places. To call\r\ntheir conduct merely factious, is to deal with it far too mildly. It has\r\nbeen factious at the expense of consistency, and of all concern for\r\nthe wishes and interests of the people. Was there no other mode of\r\nembarrassing the government? Could no other opportunity be found or made\r\nfor a division? Was there no other {421}pledge which could be violated,\r\nif not with less awkwardness to themselves, at least with less injury to\r\nthe state? Was it necessary that they should make a handle of a question\r\non which the passions of the people were roused to the highest point,\r\nand on which its daily bread might depend, that they should condemn the\r\ncountry to another year of agitation, and expose it to dangers, which,\r\nonly a few months before, they had themselves thought it necessary to\r\navert, by advising an extraordinary exercise of the prerogative? There\r\nis one explanation, and only one. They were out, and they longed to be\r\nin. Decency, consistency, the prosperity and peace of the country, were\r\nas dust in the balance. They knew this question had divided men who were\r\ngenerally united, and united others who were usually opposed; and though\r\nthey themselves had already taken their part with their colleagues in\r\noffice and the more intelligent part of their habitual opponents, they\r\ndid not scruple, for the sake of embarrassing those they had deserted,\r\nto purchase the appearance of a numerous following, by opposing a\r\nmeasure which they had themselves concocted, and pledged themselves to\r\nsupport. From the expedients to which they have resorted in Opposition,\r\nwe may judge of what we have to expect if they should ever return to\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThey will return too, it must be remembered, not, as before, the\r\ncolleagues of men by whose superior talents they were overawed, and to\r\nwhose beneficial measures they were often compelled to yield a reluctant\r\nconsent. The late change has separated the greater part of them from all\r\nsuch associates forever: it has divided the light from the darkness: it\r\nhas set all the wisdom, all the liberality, all the public spirit on\r\none side; the imbecility, the bigotry, and the rashness on the other. If\r\nthey rule again, they will rule alone.\r\n\r\nThey will return to situations which they will owe neither to their\r\ntalents nor to their virtues, neither to the choice of their King nor to\r\nthe love of their country; but solely to the support of an Oligarchical\r\nFaction, richly endowed with every quality which ensures to its\r\npossessors the hatred of a nation,--a faction arbitrary, bigoted, and\r\ninsolent,--a faction which makes parade of its contempt for the dearest\r\ninterests of mankind, which loves to make the people feel of how little\r\nweight, in its deliberations, is the consideration of their happiness.\r\n\r\nOn {422}this party, and on this alone, must such ministers, returning\r\nfrom such a secession, rely to uphold them against the public opinion,\r\nagainst the wishes of a King who has wisely and nobly performed his\r\nduty to the state, against the most beloved and respected portion of the\r\naristocracy, against a formidable union of all the great statesmen and\r\norators of the age. It was believed by those of whose wisdom Lord\r\nEldon and the Duke of Newcastle think with reverence, that, in the bond\r\nbetween a sorcerer and his familiar demon, there was a stipulation that\r\nthe gifts bestowed by the Powers of Evil should never be employed but\r\nfor purposes of evil. Omnipotent for mischief, these obligors of the\r\nfiend were powerless for good. Such will be the compact between the\r\nEx-Ministers, if ever they should return to power, and the only party\r\nwhich can then support them. That they may be masters, they must be\r\nslaves. They will be able to stand only by abject submission and by\r\nboundless profusion--by giving up the People to be oppressed, first for\r\nthe profit of the Great, and then for their amusement,--by corn-laws,\r\nand game-laws, and pensions for Lord Robert, and places for Lord John.\r\n\r\nThey will return pledged to oppose every reform, to maintain a constant\r\nstruggle against the spirit of the age, to defend abuses to which the\r\nnation is every day becoming more quick-sighted. Even Mr. Peel, if,\r\nunluckily, he should at last identity himself with their faction, must\r\nrestrain his propensity to innovation. Mutterings have already been\r\nheard in high places against his tendencies to liberality; and all his\r\nschemes for the reformation of our code or our courts must be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThen will come all those desperate and cruel expedients of which none\r\nbut bad governments stand in need. The press is troublesome. There must\r\nbe fresh laws against the press. Secret societies are formed. The Habeas\r\nCorpus act must be suspended. The people are distressed and tumultuous.\r\nThey must be kept down by force. The army must be increased; and the\r\ntaxes must be increased. Then the distress and tumult are increased: and\r\nthen the army must be increased again! The country will be governed as a\r\nchild is governed by an ill-tempered nurse,--first beaten till it cries,\r\nand then beaten because it cries!\r\n\r\nOur firm conviction is, that if the seceders return to office, they\r\nwill act thus; and that they will not have the power, even {423}if they\r\nshould have the inclination, to act otherwise. And what must the end of\r\nthese things be? We answer, without hesitation, that, if this course be\r\npersisted in, if these counsels and these counsellors are maintained,\r\nthe end must be, a revolution, a bloody and unsparing revolution--a\r\nrevolution which will make the ears of those who hear of it tingle in\r\nthe remotest countries, and in the remotest times. The middling orders\r\nin England are, we well know, attached to the institutions of their\r\ncountry, but not with a blindly partial attachment. They see the merits\r\nof the system; but they also see its faults; and they have a strong and\r\ngrowing desire that these faults should be removed. If, while their wish\r\nfor improvement is becoming stronger and stronger, the government is to\r\nbecome worse and worse, the consequences are obvious. Even now, it is\r\nimpossible to disguise, that there is arising in the bosom of that class\r\na Republican sect, as audacious, as paradoxical, as little inclined\r\nto respect antiquity, as enthusiastically attached to its ends,\r\nas unscrupulous in the choice of its means, as the French Jacobins\r\nthemselves,--but far superior to the French Jacobins in acuteness and\r\ninformation--in caution, in patience, and in resolution. They are men\r\nwhose minds have been put into training for violent exertion. All that\r\nis merely ornamental--? all that gives the roundness, the smoothness,\r\nand the bloom, has been exuded. Nothing is left but nerve, and muscle,\r\nand bone. Their love of liberty is no boyish fancy. It is not nourished\r\nby rhetoric, and it does not evaporate in rhetoric. They care nothing\r\nfor Leonidas, and Epaminondas, and Brutus, and Codes. They profess to\r\nderive their opinions from demonstration alone; and are never so little\r\nsatisfied with them as when they see them exhibited in a romantic\r\nform. Metaphysical and political science engage their whole attention.\r\nPhilosophical pride has done for them what spiritual pride did for the\r\nPuritans in a former age; it has generated in them an aversion for the\r\nfine arts, for elegant literature, and for the sentiments of chivalry.\r\nIt has made them arrogant, intolerant, and impatient of all superiority.\r\nThese qualities will, in spite of their real claims to respect, render\r\nthem unpopular, as long as the people are satisfied with their rulers.\r\nBut under an ignorant and tyrannical ministry, obstinately opposed to\r\nthe most moderate and judicious innovations, their principles would\r\nspread as rapidly {424}as those of the Puritans formerly spread, in\r\nspite of their offensive peculiarities. The public, disgusted with the\r\nblind adherence of its rulers to ancient abuses, would be reconciled to\r\nthe most startling novelties. A strong democratic party would be formed\r\nin the educated class. In the lowest, and the most numerous order of the\r\npopulation, those who have any opinions at all are democrats already. In\r\nour manufacturing towns, the feeling is even now formidably strong; and\r\nit is not strange that it should be so: For it is on persons in this\r\nstation that the abuses of our system press most heavily; while its\r\nadvantages, on the other hand, are comparatively little felt by them.\r\nAn abundant supply of the necessaries of life is, with them, almost the\r\nonly consideration. The difference between an arbitrary and a limited\r\nmonarchy vanishes, when compared with the difference between one meal\r\na-day and three meals a-day. It is poor consolation to a man who has had\r\nno breakfast, and expects no supper, that the King does not possess a\r\ndispensing power, and that troops cannot be raised in time of peace,\r\nwithout the consent of Parliament. With this class, our government, free\r\nas it is, is even now as unpopular as if it were despotic,--nay, much\r\nmore so. In despotic states, the multitude is unaccustomed to general\r\nspeculations on politics. Even when men suffer most severely, they look\r\nno further than the proximate cause. They demand the abolition of a\r\nparticular duty, or tear an obnoxious individual to pieces. But they\r\nnever think of attacking the whole system. If Constantinople were in the\r\nstate in which Manchester and Leeds have lately been, there would be a\r\ncry against the Grand Vizier or the bakers. The head of the Vizier would\r\nbe thrown to the mob, over the wall of the Seraglio--a score of bakers\r\nwould be smothered in their own ovens; and every thing would go on as\r\nbefore. Not a single rioter would think of curtailing the prerogatives\r\nof the Sultan, or of demanding a representative divan. But people\r\nfamiliar with political inquiries carry their scrutiny further; and,\r\njustly or unjustly, attribute the grievances under which they labour, to\r\ndefects in the original constitution of the government. Thus it is with\r\na large portion of our spinners, our grinders, and our weavers. It is\r\nnot too much to say, that in a season of distress, they are ripe for any\r\nrevolution. This, indeed, is acknowledged by all the Tory writers of our\r\ntime. But all {425}this, they tell us, comes of education--it is all the\r\nfault of the Liberals. We will not take up the time of our readers with\r\nanswering such observations. We will only remind our gentry and clergy,\r\nthat the question at present is not about the _cause_ of the evil, but\r\nabout its _cure_; and that, unless due precaution be used, let the fault\r\nbe whose it may, the punishment will inevitably be their own.\r\n\r\nThe history of our country, since the peace of 1815, is almost entirely\r\nmade up of the struggles of the lower orders against the government,\r\nand of the efforts of the government to keep them down. In 1816, immense\r\nassemblies were convened, secret societies were formed, and gross\r\noutrages were committed. In 1817, the Habeas Corpus Act was twice\r\nsuspended. In 1819, the disturbances broke out afresh. Meetings were\r\nheld, so formidable, from their numbers and their spirit, that the\r\nMinistry, and the Parliament, approved of the conduct of magistrates who\r\nhad dispersed one of them by the sword. Fresh laws were passed against\r\nseditious writings and practices. Yet the following year commenced\r\nwith a desperate and extended conspiracy for the assassination of the\r\ncabinet, and the subversion of the government. A few months after this\r\nevent, the Queen landed. On that occasion, the majority of the middling\r\norders joined with the mob. The effect of the union was irresistible.\r\nThe Ministers and the Parliament stood aghast; the bill of pains and\r\npenalties was dropped; and a convulsion, which seemed inevitable, was\r\naverted. But the events of that year ought to impress one lesson on\r\nthe mind of every public man,--that an alliance between the disaffected\r\nmultitude and a large portion of the middling orders, is one with\r\nwhich no government can venture to cope, without imminent danger to the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nA government like that with which England would be cursed, if the\r\npresent Ministry should fall before the present Opposition, would render\r\nsuch an alliance not only inevitable, but permanent. In less than ten\r\nyears, it would goad every Reformer in the country into a Revolutionist.\r\nIt would place at the head of the multitude, persons possessing all the\r\neducation, all the judgment, and all the habits of cooperation in which\r\nthe multitude itself is deficient. That great body is physically the\r\nmost powerful in the state. Like the Hebrew champion, it is yet held\r\nin captivity by its blindness. {426}But if once the eyeless Giant shall\r\nfind a guide to put his hand on the props of the State--if once he shall\r\nbow himself upon the pillars, woe to all those who have made him their\r\nlaughing-stock, or chained him to grind at their mill!\r\n\r\nWe do, therefore, firmly believe, that, even if no external cause were\r\nto precipitate a fatal crisis, this country could not be governed for\r\na single generation by such men as Lord Westmoreland and Lord Eldon,\r\nwithout extreme risk of revolution. But there are other symptoms in the\r\nbody politic, not less alarming than those which we have described. In\r\nIreland, there are several millions of Catholics, who do not love our\r\ngovernment; and who detest, with all their heart, with all their soul,\r\nwith all their mind, and with all their strength, the party now in\r\nOpposition. The accession of that party to power, would be a death-blow\r\nto their hopes of obtaining their demands by constitutional means: and\r\nwe may fairly expect, that all the events which followed the recall\r\nof Lord Fitzwilliam, will take place again, on a greater and more\r\nformidable scale. One thing, indeed, we have no right to expect, that\r\na second Hoche will be as unfortunate as the former. A civil war in\r\nIreland will lead almost necessarily to a war with France. Maritime\r\nhostilities with France, and the clash of neutral and belligerent\r\npretensions, will then produce war with America. Then come expeditions\r\nto Canada and expeditions to Java. The Cape of Good Hope must be\r\ngarrisoned. Lisbon must be defended. Let us suppose the best. That best\r\nmust be, a long conflict, a dear-bought victory, a great addition to a\r\ndebt already most burdensome, fresh taxes, and fresh discontents.\r\nAll these are events which may not improbably happen under any\r\ngovernment--events which the next month may bring forth--events, against\r\nwhich no minister, however able and honest, can with perfect certainty\r\nprovide,--but which Ministers, whose policy should exasperate the people\r\nof Ireland, would almost unavoidably bring upon us. A Cabinet formed by\r\nthe Ex-Ministers could scarcely exist for a year, without incensing the\r\nlower classes of the English to frenzy, by giving them up to the selfish\r\ntyranny of its aristocratical supporters, without driving Ireland into\r\nrebellion, and without tempting France to war.\r\n\r\nThere is one hope, and one hope only for our country; and {427}that hope\r\nis in a liberal Administration,--in Administration which will follow\r\nwith cautions, but with constantly advancing steps, the progress of the\r\npublic mind; which, by promptitude to redress practical grievances, will\r\nenable itself to oppose with authority and effect, the propositions of\r\nturbulent theorists; which by kindness and fairness in all its dealings\r\nwith the People, will entitle itself to their confidence and esteem.\r\n\r\nThe state of England at the present moment, bears a close resemblance\r\nto that of France at the time when Turgot was called to the head\r\nof affairs. Abuses were numerous; public burdens heavy; a spirit of\r\ninnovation was abroad among the people. The philosophical Minister\r\nattempted to secure the ancient institutions, by amending them. The mild\r\nreforms which he projected, had they been carried into execution, would\r\nhave conciliated the people, and saved from the most tremendous of all\r\ncommotions the Church, the Aristocracy, and the Throne. But a crowd of\r\nnarrow-minded nobles, ignorant of their own interest, though solicitous\r\nfor nothing else, the Newcastles and the Salisburys of France, began to\r\ntremble for their oppressive franchises. Their clamours overpowered the\r\nmild good sense of a King who wanted only firmness to be the best of\r\nSovereigns. The Minister was discarded for councillors more obsequious\r\nto the privileged orders; and the aristocracy and clergy exulted in\r\ntheir success.\r\n\r\nThen came a new period of profusion and misrule. And then, swiftly, like\r\nan armed man, came poverty and dismay. The acclamation of the nobles,\r\nand the _Te Deums_ of the church, grew fainter and fainter. The very\r\ncourtiers muttered disapprobation. The Ministers stammered out feeble\r\nand inconsistent counsels. But all other voices were soon drowned in\r\none, which every moment waxed louder and more terrible,--in the fierce\r\nand tumultuous roar of a great people, conscious of irresistible\r\nstrength, maddened by intolerable wrongs, and sick of deferred hopes!\r\nThat cry, so long stifled, now rose from every corner of France, made\r\nitself heard in the presence-chamber of her King, in the salons of her\r\nnobles, and in the refectories of her luxurious priesthood. Then, at\r\nlength, concessions were made which the subjects of Louis the Fourteenth\r\nwould have thought it impious even to desire,--which the most factious\r\nopponent of {428}Louis the Fifteenth had never ventured to ask,--which,\r\nbut a few years before, would have been received with ecstasies of\r\ngratitude. But it was too late!\r\n\r\nThe imprisoned Genie of the Arabian Tales, during the early period of\r\nhis confinement, promised wealth, empire, and supernatural powers to the\r\nman who should extricate him. But when he had waited long in vain, mad\r\nwith rage at the continuance of his captivity, he vowed to destroy his\r\ndeliverer without mercy! Such is the gratitude of nations exasperated\r\nby misgovernment to rulers who are slow to concede. The first use which\r\nthey make of freedom is to avenge themselves on those who have been so\r\nslow to grant it.\r\n\r\nNever was this disposition more remarkably displayed than at the period\r\nof which we speak. Abuses were swept away with unsparing severity. The\r\nroyal prerogatives, the feudal privileges, the provincial distinctions,\r\nwere sacrificed to the passions of the people. Every thing was given;\r\nand every thing was given in vain. Distrust and hatred were not to be\r\nthus eradicated from the minds of men who thought that they were not\r\nreceiving favours but extorting rights; and that, if they deserved\r\nblame, it was not for their insensibility to tardy benefits, but for\r\ntheir forgetfulness of past oppression.\r\n\r\nWhat followed was the necessary consequence of such a state of feeling.\r\nThe recollection of old grievances made the people suspicious and\r\ncruel. The fear of popular outrages produced emigrations, intrigues with\r\nforeign courts; and, finally, a. general war. Then came the barbarity\r\nof fear; the triple despotism of the clubs, the committees, and the\r\ncommune; the organized anarchy, the fanatical atheism, the scheming and\r\nfar-sighted madness, the butcheries of the Châtelet, and the accursed\r\nmarriages of the Loire. The whole property of the nation changed hands.\r\nIts best and wisest citizens were banished or murdered. Dungeons were\r\nemptied by assassins as fast as they were filled by spies. Provinces\r\nwere made desolate. Towns were unpeopled. Old things passed away. All\r\nthings became new.\r\n\r\nThe paroxysm terminated. A singular train of events restored the house\r\nof Bourbon to the French throne. The exiles have returned. But they have\r\nreturned as the few survivors of the deluge returned to a world in which\r\nthey could {429}recognise nothing; in which the valleys had been raised,\r\nand the mountains depressed, and the courses of the rivers changed,--in\r\nwhich sand and sea-weed had covered the cultivated fields and the walls\r\nof imperial cities. They have returned to seek in vain, amidst the\r\nmouldering relics of a former system, and the fermenting elements of a\r\nnew creation, the traces of any remembered object. The old boundaries\r\nare obliterated. The old laws are forgotten. The old titles have become\r\nlaughing-stocks. The gravity of the parliaments, and the pomp of the\r\nhierarchy; the Doctors whose disputes agitated the Sorbonne, and the\r\nembroidered multitude whose footsteps wore out the marble pavements of\r\nVersailles,--all have disappeared. The proud and voluptuous prelates who\r\nfeasted on silver, and dozed amidst curtains of massy velvet, have been\r\nreplaced by curates who undergo every drudgery and every humiliation\r\nfor the wages of lackeys. To those gay and elegant nobles who studied\r\nmilitary science as a fashionable accomplishment, and expected military\r\nrank as a part of their birthright, have succeeded men born in lofts and\r\ncellars; educated in the halfnaked ranks of the revolutionary armies,\r\nand raised by ferocious valour and self-taught skill, to dignities with\r\nwhich the coarseness of their manners and language forms a grotesque\r\ncontrast. The government may amuse itself by playing at despotism, by\r\nreviving the names and aping the style of the old court--as Helenus in\r\nEpirus consoled himself for the lost magnificence of Troy, by calling\r\nhis book Xanthus, and the entrance of his little capital the Seæan gate.\r\nBut the law of entail is gone, and cannot be restored. The liberty\r\nof the press is established, and the feeble struggles of the Minister\r\ncannot permanently put it down. The Bastille is fallen, and can\r\nnever more rise from its ruins. A few words, a few ceremonies, a few\r\nrhetorical topics, make up all that remains of that system which was\r\nfounded so deeply by the policy of the house of Valois, and adorned so\r\nsplendidly by the pride of Louis the Great.\r\n\r\nIs this a romance? Or is it a faithful picture of what has lately been\r\nin a neighbouring land--of what may shortly be, within the borders of\r\nour own? Has the warning been given in vain? Have our Mannerses and\r\nClintons so soon forgotten the fate of houses as wealthy and as noble as\r\ntheir own: Have they forgotten how the tender and delicate woman,--the\r\n{430}woman who would not set her foot on the earth for tenderness and\r\ndelicateness, the idol of gilded drawing-rooms, the pole-star of\r\ncrowded theatres, the standard of beauty, the arbitress of fashion,\r\nthe patroness of genius,--was compelled to exchange her luxurious and\r\ndignified ease for labour and dependence, the sighs of Dukes and the\r\nflattery of bowing Abbés for the insults of rude pupils and exacting\r\nmothers;--perhaps, even to draw an infamous and miserable subsistence\r\nfrom those charms which had been the glory of royal circles--to sell for\r\na morsel of bread her’ reluctant caresses and her haggard smiles--to be\r\nturned over from a garret to a hospital, and from a hospital to a parish\r\nvault? Have they forgotten how the gallant and luxurious nobleman,\r\nsprung from illustrious ancestors, marked out from his cradle for the\r\nhighest honours of the State and of the army, impatient of all control,\r\nexquisitely sensible of the slightest affront, with all his high spirit,\r\nhis polished manners, his voluptuous habits, was reduced to request,\r\nwith tears in his eyes, credit for half-a-crown,--to pass day after\r\nday in hearing the auxiliary verbs mis-recited, or the first page\r\nof Télémaque misconstrued, by petulant boys, who infested him with\r\nnicknames and caricatures, who mimicked his foreign accent, and laughed\r\nat his thread-bare coat? Have they forgotten all this? God grant\r\nthat they may never remember it with unavailing self-accusation, when\r\ndesolation shall have visited wealthier cities and fairer gardens;--when\r\nManchester shall be as Lyons, and Stowe as Chantilly;--when he who now,\r\nin the pride of rank and opulence, sneers at what we have written in\r\nthe bitter sincerity of our hearts, shall be thankful for a porringer of\r\nbroth at the door of some Spanish convent, or shall implore some Italian\r\nmoney-lender to advance another pistole on his George!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END",
