As an aid to the\r\nother and equally important duty--that of carrying out, in their\r\nintegrity, the obligations of these treaties, and devising means\r\nwhereby the Indian population of the Fertile Belt can be rescued\r\nfrom the hard fate which otherwise awaits them, owing to the speedy\r\ndestruction of the buffalo, hitherto the principal food supply of\r\nthe Plain Indians, and that they may be induced to become, by the\r\nadoption of agricultural and pastoral pursuits, a self supporting\r\ncommunity--I have prepared this collection of the treaties made\r\nwith them, and of information, relating to the negotiations, on\r\nwhich these treaties were based, in the hope that I may thereby\r\ncontribute to the completion of a work, in which I had considerable\r\npart, that, of, by treaties, securing the good will of the Indian\r\ntribes, and by the helpful hand of the Dominion, opening up\r\nto them, a future of promise, based upon the foundations of\r\ninstruction and the many other advantages of civilized life.\r\n\r\nM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n       Introduction\r\n    I.

The predecessors of Canada--the\r\nCompany of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay,\r\npopularly known as the Hudson's Bay Company--had, for long years,\r\nbeen eminently successful in securing the good-will of the\r\nIndians--but on their sway, coming to an end, the Indian mind was\r\ndisturbed. The events, that transpired in the Red River region, in\r\nthe years 1869-1870, during the period when a provisional\r\ngovernment was attempted to be established, had perplexed the\r\nIndians. They, moreover, had witnessed a sudden irruption into the\r\ncountry of whites from without. In the West, American traders\r\npoured into the land, and, freighted with fire-water, purchased\r\ntheir peltries and their horses, and impoverished the tribes. In\r\nthe East, white men took possession of the soil and made for\r\nthemselves homes, and as time went on steamboats were placed on the\r\ninland waters--surveyors passed through the territories--and the\r\n\"speaking wires,\" as the Indian calls the telegraph, were erected.\r\nWhat wonder that the Indian mind was disturbed, and what wonder was\r\nit that a Plain chief, as he looked upon the strange wires\r\nstretching through his land, exclaimed to his people, \"We have done\r\nwrong to allow that wire to be placed there, before the Government\r\nobtained our leave to do so. There is a white chief at Red River,\r\nand that wire speaks to him, and if we do anything wrong he will\r\nstretch out a long arm and take hold of us before we can get away.\"\r\nThe government of Canada had, anticipating the probabilities of\r\nsuch a state of affairs, wisely resolved, that contemporaneously\r\nwith the formal establishment of their rule, there should be formed\r\nalliances with the Indians. In 1870 the Parliament of Canada\r\ncreated the requisite machinery for the Government of the Province\r\nof Manitoba and of the North-West Territories respectively, giving\r\nto the former a Lieutenant-Governor and Legislature, and to\r\nthe latter, a Lieutenant-Governor and Council, Executive and\r\nLegislative--the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba being ex officio\r\nLieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories. Subsequently the\r\nNorth-West Territories were erected into a distinct government,\r\nwith a Lieutenant-Governor and Executive, and Legislative Council.\r\nThe District of Kee-wa-tin, \"the land of the north wind,\" was also\r\nestablished, comprising the eastern and northern portions of the\r\nTerritories, and placed under the control of the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nof Manitoba, and an Executive and Legislative Council. Since 1870,\r\nno less than seven treaties have been concluded, with the Indian\r\ntribes, so that there now remain no Indian nations in the North-West,\r\ninside of the fertile belt, who have not been dealt with.\r\n\r\nIt is the design of the present work to tell the story of these\r\ntreaties, to preserve as far as practicable, a record of the\r\nnegotiations on which they were based, and to present to the many\r\nin the Dominion and elsewhere, who take a deep interest in these\r\nsons of the forest and the plain, a view of their habits of thought\r\nand speech, as thereby presented, and to suggest the possibility,\r\nnay, the certainty, of a hopeful future for them.\r\n\r\nPrior to proceeding to deal, with the treaties of the Dominion of\r\nCanada, it will render this book more complete to present the\r\nreader, with information as to three treaties which preceded those\r\nof the Dominion, viz., the treaty made by the Earl of Selkirk in\r\nthe year 1817, those popularly known as the Robinson Treaties, made\r\nby the late Hon. William B. Robinson, of the City of Toronto, with\r\nthe Indians of the shores and islands of Lakes Superior and Huron\r\nin the year 1850, and that made by the Hon. William Macdougall, for\r\nthe surrender of the Indian title, to the great Manitoulin Island,\r\nboth acting for and on behalf of the Government of the late\r\nProvince of Canada.\r\n\r\nEre however entering upon an explanation of these two first-mentioned\r\ntreaties, I submit a few brief observations.\r\n\r\nThe Indians inhabiting the region covered by the treaties in\r\nquestion, extending in Canadian territory from Lake Superior to the\r\nfoot of the Rocky Mountains, are composed of distinct tribes having\r\ndifferent languages.\r\n\r\nThe Ojibbewas, Chippawas, or Saulteaux as they now call themselves,\r\nare found in numbers in the District of Kee-wa-tin and the Province\r\nof Manitoba. In the North-West Territories they are not numerous\r\nexcept within the limits of Treaty number Four. These Indians\r\nmigrated from the older Provinces of Quebec and Ontario many years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThe Crees, inhabit the North-West Territories and are divided into\r\nPlain, Wood and Swampy Crees, according to the region of the\r\ncountry they dwell in. The Swampy Crees reside in Manitoba and\r\nKee-wa-tin.\r\n\r\nThe Black Feet nation are to be found towards the slope of the\r\nRocky Mountains, in the region comprised within the limits of the\r\nTreaty number Seven.\r\n\r\nA few Chippawayans, or Northerners, dwell within the North-West\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nThe once powerful nation of the Assiniboines, or Stonies--a kindred\r\ntribe to the Sioux--are greatly reduced in numbers, and are now\r\nonly to be met with in the North-West Territories.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux in the Dominion are refugees from the United States, the\r\nfirst body having come over some fourteen years ago. A large influx\r\nof similar refugees, have recently fled to the Dominion from, the\r\nsame country, as the issue of the recent war between the United\r\nStates and the Sioux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE SELKIRK TREATY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1811, the Earl of Selkirk purchased [Footnote:\r\nVide Appendix for copy of the agreement in question.] from the\r\nGovernor and Company of Adventurers trading into Hudson's Bay,\r\nin consideration of ten shillings and certain agreements and\r\nunderstandings contained in the Indenture, a large tract of\r\nterritory within Rupert's Land described in the Indenture as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"All that tract of land or territory being within and forming part\r\nof the aforesaid lands and territories of the said Governor and\r\nCompany, bounded by an imaginary line running as follows, that\r\nis to say, beginning on the western shore of the Lake Winnipic,\r\notherwise Winnipeg, at a point in fifty-two degrees and thirty\r\nnorth latitude and thence running due west to the Lake Winnipegoos,\r\notherwise called Little Winnipeg, then in a southerly direction\r\nthrough the said Lake so as to strike its western shore in latitude\r\nfifty-two degrees, then due west to the place where the parallel of\r\nfifty-two degrees north latitude intersects the western branch of\r\nRed River, otherwise called Assiniboine River, then due south from\r\nthat point of intersection to the height of land which separates\r\nthe waters running into Hudson's Bay from those of the Missouri and\r\nMississippi, then in an easterly direction along the said height\r\nof land to the source of the River Winnipic, or Winnipeg (meaning\r\nby such last named river the principal branch of the waters which\r\nunite in Lake Sagenagos), thence along the main stream of these\r\nwaters and the middle of the several lakes through which they\r\nflow to the mouth of the Winnipic River and thence in a northerly\r\ndirection through the middle of Lake Winnipic to the place of\r\nbeginning.\" The deed is accompanied by a map intended to show the\r\ntract of country, and there is an endorsement on the map that\r\nas the surveys were not sufficient to ascertain with precision\r\nwhether, latitude 52 degrees does intersect the river called Red or\r\nAssiniboine River, it was agreed, that in case the waters of of Red\r\nRiver, shall on more accurate survey be found, not to extend so far\r\nnorth as latitude 52 degrees, then the west boundary of the tract\r\nof land intended to be within the grant, should be a line drawn due\r\nnorth and south, through the post upon the Red River, marked on the\r\nplan is \"Carlton House.\"\r\n\r\nThe Company reserved the right to call upon the Earl to set off\r\none-tenth, however, of the tract for the use of the servants of\r\nthe Company--and the Earl covenanted, within ten years, to settle\r\nwithin the tract one thousand families, each of them consisting of\r\none married couple at the least, on pain of revocation of the\r\ngrant, if on receipt of notice to that effect from the Company he\r\ndid not, within three years after the receipt of the notice,\r\ncomplete the settlement of the one thousand families.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of his obligations, Lord Selkirk, in the autumn of the\r\nyear 1811, sent out a number of families from the County of\r\nSutherland, in Scotland, who spent the winter at Fort Churchill on\r\nthe western shore of Hudson's Bay. On the arrival of spring, they\r\ntravelled thence to the confluence of the Assiniboine and Red\r\nRivers, and thus was commenced the interesting settlement of the\r\nRed River, which is now included in the Province of Manitoba. It is\r\nnot my purpose to notice here the eventful history of the Selkirk\r\ncolonists, and I will only note the fact that in 1836, the Company\r\nbought back the whole tract, from the heirs of Lord Selkirk, for\r\nthe sum of L84,000, the rights of colonists who had purchased land\r\nbetween 1811 and 1836, being respected.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1817 the Earl of Selkirk, visited his wide domain,\r\nand entered into negotiations with the Indian tribes, for the\r\nextinction of their title, to a tract of land described as follows:\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A large portion of the ceded territory is now\r\ncomprehended in the Territory of Dakota, United States.] \"All\r\nthat tract of land adjacent to Red River and Assiniboine River,\r\nbeginning at the mouth of Red River and extending along the same\r\nas far as Great Forks at the mouth of Red Lake River and along\r\nAssiniboine River as far as the Musk Rat River, otherwise called\r\nRiviere des Champignons, and extending to the distance of six miles\r\nfrom Fort Douglas on every side, and likewise from Fort Doer, and\r\nalso from the Great Forks and in other posts extending in breadth\r\nto the distance of two English statute miles back from the banks of\r\nthe river.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians then inhabiting the region were described as being of\r\nthe Chippawa or Saulteaux and Killistine or Cree nations. They were\r\nmade to comprehend, the depth of the land they were surrendering,\r\nby being told, that it was the greatest distance, at which a horse\r\non the level prairie could be seen, or daylight seen under his\r\nbelly between his legs. The consideration for the surrender, was,\r\nthe payment of one hundred pounds of good merchantable tobacco, to\r\neach nation annually.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was signed by Lord Selkirk and by five Indian chiefs,\r\nwho affixed thereto drawings of the animals after which they were\r\nnamed, by way of signature, a fac simile of which will be found\r\nelsewhere. The surrender was to the Sovereign Lord, King George the\r\nThird. The treaty was accompanied by a map which shows that the\r\ntract surrendered extended to Grand Forks in what is now United\r\nStates territory. A copy of the treaty will be found in the\r\nAppendix and will prove of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ROBINSON TREATIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the discovery of minerals, on the shores of Lakes\r\nHuron and Superior, the Government of the late Province of Canada,\r\ndeemed it desirable, to extinguish the Indian title, and in order\r\nto that end, in the year 1850, entrusted the duty to the late\r\nHonorable William B. Robinson, who discharged his duties with great\r\ntact and judgment, succeeding in making two treaties, which were\r\nthe forerunners of the future treaties, and shaped their course.\r\nThe main features of the Robinson Treaties--viz., annuities,\r\nreserves for the Indians, and liberty to fish and hunt on the\r\nunconceded domain of the Crown--having been followed in these\r\ntreaties. A special feature of the Robinson Treaties, was the\r\nadjustment of a claim made by the Indians to be paid, the amount\r\nreceived, by the Government, for the sale of mining locations. This\r\nwas arranged, by Mr. Robinson, agreeing to pay them, the sum of\r\nL4,000 and an annuity of about L1,000, thus avoiding any dispute\r\nthat might arise as to the amounts actually received by the\r\nGovernment. The number of Indians included in the treaties were\r\nstated by Mr. Robinson to be: on Lake Superior, 1240, including 84\r\nhalf-breeds; and on Lake Huron 1422, including 200 half-breeds.\r\n[Footnote: The census return of the Department of the Interior\r\nfor the year 1878 gives the numbers of these Indians as follows:\r\nChippawas of Lake Superior ... 1,947. Chippawas of Lake Huron ...\r\n1,458.] The relations of the Indians and half-breeds, have long\r\nbeen cordial; and in the negotiations as to these initial treaties,\r\nas in the subsequent ones, the claims of the half-breeds, to\r\nrecognition, was urged by the Indians.\r\n\r\nI cannot do better, in giving information with regard to these\r\ntreaties, than simply to reproduce the Report of Mr. Robinson to\r\nthe Honorable Colonel Bruce, Superintendent-General of Indian\r\nAffairs, in which he describes the course of his negotiations and\r\ncommunicates their results. A copy of the treaties will be found in\r\nthe Appendix. The Report is as follows:\r\n\r\nTORONTO, 24th September, 1850.\r\n\r\nSir:--I have the honor herewith to transmit the Treaty which on\r\nthe part of the Government I was commissioned to negotiate with\r\nthe tribes of Indians inhabiting the northern shore of Lakes Huron\r\nand Superior; and I trust that the terms on which I succeeded in\r\nobtaining the surrender of all the lands in question, with the\r\nexception of some small reservations made by the Indians, may be\r\nconsidered satisfactory. They were such as I thought it advisable\r\nto offer, in order that the matter might be finally settled,\r\nwithout having any just grounds of complaint on the part of the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThe Indians had been advised by certain interested parties to\r\ninsist on such extravagant terms as I felt it quite impossible to\r\ngrant; and from the fact that the American Government had paid\r\nvery liberally for the land surrendered by their Indians on the\r\nsouth side of Lake Superior, and that our own in other parts of the\r\ncountry were in receipt of annuities much larger than I offered, I\r\nhad some difficulty in obtaining the assent of a few of the chiefs\r\nto my proposition.\r\n\r\nI explained to the chiefs in council the difference between the\r\nlands ceded heretofore in this Province and those then under\r\nconsideration, they were of good quality and sold readily at\r\nprices which enabled the Government to be more liberal, they were\r\nalso occupied by the whites in such a manner as to preclude the\r\npossibility of the Indian hunting over or having access to them\r\nwhereas the lands now ceded are notoriously barren and sterile, and\r\nwill in all probability never be settled except in a few localities\r\nby mining companies, whose establishments among the Indians,\r\ninstead of being prejudicial, would prove of great benefit as they\r\nwould afford a market for any things they may have to sell, and\r\nbring provisions and stores of all kinds among them at reasonable\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nNeither did the British Government contemplate the removal of the\r\nIndians from their present haunts to some (to them) unknown region\r\nin the far West, as had been the case with their brethren on the\r\nAmerican side.\r\n\r\nI told them that the two chiefs who were in Toronto last winter\r\n(Shinguacouse and Nebennigoebing) only asked the amount which the\r\nGovernment had received for mining locations, after deducting the\r\nexpenses attending their sale. That amount was about eight thousand\r\npounds which the Government would pay them without any annuity\r\nor certainty of further benefit; or one-half of it down, and an\r\nannuity of about one thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nThere were twenty-one chiefs present, about the same number of\r\nprincipal men, and a large number of other Indians belonging to\r\nthe different bands, and they all preferred the latter proposition,\r\nthough two of them (Shinguacouse and Nebennigoebing) insisted on\r\nreceiving an annuity equal to ten dollars per head.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs from Lake Superior desired to treat separately for their\r\nterritory and said at once in council that they accepted my offer.\r\nI told them that I would have the treaty ready on the following\r\nmorning, and I immediately proceeded to prepare it, and as agreed\r\nupon they signed it cheerfully at the time appointed.\r\n\r\nI then told the chiefs from Lake Huron (who were all present when\r\nthe others signed) that I should have a similar treaty ready for\r\ntheir signature, the next morning when those who signed it would\r\nreceive their money; and that as a large majority of them had\r\nagreed to my terms I should abide by them.\r\n\r\nI accordingly prepared the treaty and proceeded on the morning of\r\nthe ninth instant to the council-room to have it formally executed\r\nin the presence of proper witnesses--all the chiefs and others were\r\npresent. I told them I was then ready to receive their signatures;\r\nthe two chiefs, Shinguacouse and Nebennigoebing, repeated their\r\ndemand of ten dollars a head by way of annuity, and also insisted\r\nthat I should insert in the treaty a condition securing to some\r\nsixty half-breeds a free grant of one hundred acres of land each.\r\nI told them they already had my answer as to a larger annuity, and\r\nthat I had no power to give them free grants of land. The other\r\nchiefs came forward to sign the treaty and seeing this the two who\r\nhad resisted up to this time also came to the table and signed\r\nfirst, the rest immediately following.\r\n\r\nI trust his Excellency will approve of my having concluded the\r\ntreaty on the basis of a small annuity and the immediate and final\r\nsettlement of the matter, rather than paying the Indians the full\r\namount of all moneys on hand, and a promise of accounting to them\r\nfor future sales. The latter course would have entailed much\r\ntrouble on the Government, besides giving an opportunity to evil\r\ndisposed persons to make the Indians suspicious of any accounts\r\nthat might be furnished.\r\n\r\nBelieving that His Excellency and the Government were desirous\r\nof leaving the Indians no just cause of complaint on their\r\nsurrendering the extensive territory embraced in the treaty, and\r\nknowing there were individuals who most assiduously endeavored to\r\ncreate dissatisfaction among them, I inserted a clause securing to\r\nthem certain prospective advantages should the lands in question\r\nprove sufficiently productive at any future period to enable the\r\nGovernment without loss to increase the annuity. [Footnote: The\r\nannuities under these treaties have recently been increased, the\r\nfollowing item having been inserted in the Supplies Act of Canada,\r\nviz., \"Annual grant to bring up annuities payable under the\r\nRobinson Treaty to the Chippawas of Lakes Huron and Superior, from\r\n96 cents to $4 per head, $14,000.\"] This was so reasonable and just\r\nthat I had no difficulty in making them comprehend it, and it in a\r\ngreat measure silenced the clamor raised by their evil advisers.\r\n\r\nIn allowing the Indians to retain reservations of land for their\r\nown use I was governed by the fact that they in most cases asked\r\nfor such tracts as they had heretofore been in the habit of using\r\nfor purposes of residence and cultivation, and by securing these to\r\nthem and the right of hunting and fishing over the ceded territory,\r\nthey cannot say that the Government takes from their usual means of\r\nsubsistence and therefore have no claims for support, which they no\r\ndoubt would have preferred, had this not been done. The reservation\r\nat Garden River is the largest and perhaps of most value, but as\r\nit is occupied by the most numerous band of Indians, and from its\r\nlocality (nine miles from the Sault) is likely to attract others\r\nto it, I think it was right to grant what they expressed a desire\r\nto retain. There are two mining locations at this place, which\r\nshould not be finally disposed of unless by the full consent of\r\nShinguacouse and his band; they are in the heart of the village and\r\nshew no indications of mineral wealth, they are numbered 14 and 15\r\non the small map appended to Messrs. Anderson and Vidal's report.\r\nI pledged my word on the part of the Government that the sale of\r\nthese locations should not be completed, and as the locatees have\r\nnot, I believe, complied with the conditions of the Crown Lands\r\nDepartment there can be no difficulty in cancelling the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs are desirous that their several reservations should\r\nbe marked by proper posts or monuments, and I have told them the\r\nGovernment would probably send some one next spring for that\r\npurpose. As I know many of the localities I shall be able to give\r\nthe necessary information when required.\r\n\r\nWhen at Sault Ste. Marie last May, I took measures for ascertaining\r\nas nearly as possible the number of Indians inhabiting the\r\nnorth shore of the two lakes; and was fortunate enough to get\r\na very correct census, particularly of Lake Superior. I found\r\nthis information very useful at the council, as it enabled me\r\nsuccessfully to contradict the assertion (made by those who were\r\ninciting the chiefs to resist my offers) that there were on Lake\r\nSuperior alone, eight thousand Indians. The number on that lake,\r\nincluding eighty-four half-breeds, is only twelve hundred and\r\nforty--and on Lake Huron, about fourteen hundred and twenty-two,\r\nincluding probably two hundred half-breeds, and when I paid the\r\nIndians they acknowledged they knew of no other families than\r\nthose on my list.\r\n\r\nThe number paid, as appears on the pay list, does not show the\r\nwhole strength of the different bands, as I was obliged at their\r\nown request to omit some members of the very large families.\r\nI have annexed to this Report the names of the chiefs, their\r\nlocalities, and number of souls in each band as recognized by me\r\nin apportioning the money, thinking it will be useful when paying\r\nthe annuity hereafter.\r\n\r\nThis information may I believe be fully relied on for Lake\r\nSuperior, but the census for Lake Huron is not so perfect; and I\r\nwould suggest that Captain Ironside should be furnished with copies\r\nof that document and also of the pay-lists in order that he may\r\ncorrect in time any errors that are found to exist.\r\n\r\nAs the half-breeds at Sault Ste. Marie and other places may seek to\r\nbe recognized by the Government in future payments, it may be well\r\nthat I should state here the answer that I gave to their demands on\r\nthe present occasion. I told them I came to treat with the chiefs\r\nwho were present, that the money would be paid to them--and their\r\nreceipt was sufficient for me--that when in their possession they\r\nmight give as much or as little to that class of claimants as they\r\npleased. To this no one, not even their advisers, could object,\r\nand I heard no more on the subject. At the earnest request of the\r\nchiefs themselves I undertook the distribution of the money among\r\ntheir respective bands and all parties expressed themselves\r\nperfectly satisfied with my division of their funds.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Penetanguishene I found the chiefs Yellowhead and\r\nSnake, from Lake Simcoe, and Aissance, from Beausoleil's Island,\r\nwaiting to see me, to prefer their claim to a small tract of land\r\nbetween Penetanguishene and the vicinity of the River Severn. I\r\nwas aware of their intending to make such a claim and took the\r\nprecaution of asking the chiefs assembled in council at the Sault\r\nwhether it was well founded, they emphatically declared that those\r\nchiefs had no claim on Lake Huron, that they had long since ceded\r\ntheir lands and were in the receipt of a large annuity, this I\r\nbelieve to be the case and Captain Anderson, whom I met there,\r\nis of the same opinion; but I promised to inquire into it and\r\ngive them an answer, and I will therefore thank you to cause the\r\nnecessary information from your office to be furnished to me on the\r\nsubject. Should it appear that these chiefs have any claim I think\r\nI could get their surrender of it for a small amount, and there\r\nremain sufficient funds at my disposal for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Canadians resident on the lands just surrendered at Sault Ste.\r\nMarie are very anxious to obtain titles to the land on which they\r\nhave long resided and made improvements; they applied to me after\r\nthe treaty and I advised them to memorialize the Government the\r\nusual way setting forth the manner in which they were put in\r\npossession by the military authorities of the time, and that I had\r\nlittle doubt that the Government would do them justice. I think the\r\nsurvey of the tract should be made so as to interfere as little as\r\npossible with their respective clearings and that those who can\r\nshow a fair claim to the favorable consideration of the Government\r\nshould be liberally dealt with.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen on referring to the treaty that I have kept within\r\nthe amount at my disposal. Of the L4,160 agreed by me to be paid\r\nto the Indians of both lakes, there remains L75 unexpended. I could\r\nnot from the information I possessed tell exactly the number of\r\nfamilies I should have to pay, and thought it prudent to reserve a\r\nsmall sum to make good any omissions, there may still be a few who\r\nwill prefer claims, though I know of none at present. If not, the\r\namount can be paid next year with the annuity to such families as\r\nare most deserving; or it may be properly applied in extinguishing\r\nthe claim made by the Lake Simcoe Indians, should it appear on\r\ninquiry to be just.\r\n\r\nThe whole amount given to me in August was L5,033 6s. 8d., of this\r\nsum their remains L800, which I have placed in the Bank of Upper\r\nCanada to the credit of the Receiver-General, and I have prepared\r\na detailed account of the whole, which with the proper vouchers, I\r\nshall deliver to the Accountant of the Crown Lands Department.\r\n\r\nI have much pleasure in acknowledging the valuable assistance\r\nafforded me by all the officers of the Honorable the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany resident on the lakes; and the prompt manner in which their\r\nGovernor, Sir George Simpson, kindly placed their services at my\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nThe report made last year by Messrs. Anderson and Vidal I found of\r\nmuch use to me, and the long services and experience of the former\r\ngentleman in Indian affairs enabled him to give me many valuable\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cooper and his officers by attending at the council, and\r\notherwise, gave me most cheerfully all the aid in their power;\r\nand Captain Ironside, of your Department, with his assistant,\r\nAssickinach, were of essential service to me.\r\n\r\nI found it absolutely necessary to have the aid of some one in\r\ntaking the census of the Lake Huron Indians at the time they were\r\nreceiving their presents at Manitoulin; and as Captain Ironside\r\nwas fully occupied in attending to his own duty, I requested Mr.\r\nKeating, who had long known the Indians on that lake, to give me\r\nhis assistance. This he cheerfully and very efficiently did, and\r\nafterwards was with me in distributing and paying out the money.\r\n\r\nI have, in course of my negotiations with the Indians on the\r\npresent occasion, collected some information which may be useful\r\nto your Department and will at an early day send it to you.\r\n\r\nI will thank you to lay the two treaties accompanying this Report\r\nbefore His Excellency, and trust they may meet with his approval.\r\n\r\n                                    I have, &c.,\r\n                                (Signed)       W. B. ROBINSON.\r\n  THE HON. COL. BRUCE,\r\n       Superintendent-General, Indian Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE MANITOULIN ISLAND TREATY\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years after the completion of the Robinson Treaties, the then\r\nGovernment of the old Province of Canada deemed it desirable to\r\neffect a treaty with the Indians dwelling upon the Great Manitoulin\r\nIsland in Lake Huron, as a complement to the former treaties, and\r\nwith the object of rendering available for settlement the large\r\ntract of good land upon the Island. The duty was entrusted to the\r\nHonorable William McDougall, then Superintendent-General of Indian\r\nAffairs, who, in the month of October, 1862, proceeded to the\r\nIsland, accompanied by the late William Spragge, Esq., Deputy\r\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs, and Mr. F. Assicknack, of the\r\nIndian Office, Toronto, as interpreter. Mr. McDougall encountered\r\nconsiderable difficulties, but by firmness and decision eventually\r\nsucceeded in obtaining a surrender from the Indians of the Island,\r\nexcluding however from the surrender that portion of it easterly of\r\nHeywood Island and the Manitoulin Gulf.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the treaty, which will be found in the Appendix, were\r\nadapted to the peculiar circumstances of the Indians and were well\r\nand wisely framed. The result has been to render available for\r\nsettlement a large tract of land on the Island, much of which is\r\nnow occupied by a prosperous and thriving population. I conclude\r\nthis brief notice of an important treaty by submitting, to the\r\nattention of the reader, the report of the Hon. W. McDougall, to\r\nHis Excellency the Governor-General in Council, of the results of\r\nhis mission.\r\n\r\nMANITOULIN ISLAND, November 3rd, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has the honor to state for the information of\r\nHis Excellency the Governor-General in Council, that, under the\r\nauthority of the Order in Council of the twelfth day of September,\r\n1862, he proceeded early in the month of October last to visit the\r\nGreat Manitoulin Island, accompanied by William Spragge, Esq.,\r\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and Mr. F. Assicknack of\r\nthe Indian Office, Toronto, as interpreter.\r\n\r\nThe resident agent, Captain Ironside, under instructions from the\r\nDepartment, had caused the Indians residing on the Island to be\r\nnotified of the intended visit of the undersigned, and of its\r\nobject and had summoned them to attend at Manitowaning on the\r\nfourth ultimo.\r\n\r\nThe Chiefs and principal men, with the exception of one or two\r\ndetained by illness and nearly all the males above the age of\r\neighteen years, were present at the council.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned stated the object of his visit, explained the\r\nwishes of the Government in regard to the settlement of the Island,\r\nand proposed the terms in respect to the Indians specified in the\r\nOrder in Council authorizing the negotiation. The Indians had\r\nselected one of their Chiefs to reply to the overtures of the\r\nGovernment, and without taking time to consider these overtures he\r\nproceeded to announce the determination of the Indians to reject\r\nthem unconditionally.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned made some further explanations and directed an\r\najournment of the council for an hour, during which time the\r\nIndians were requested to consider the propositions he had made\r\nwith care and deliberation.\r\n\r\nOn re-assembling there was an evident disposition among the bands\r\nliving westwardly of the place of meeting to listen favorably to\r\nthe propositions of the Government, but the majority were still\r\nunwilling to treat, and by intimidation and threats of violence\r\nprevented any open expression of opinion except by the old war\r\nChief, Assicknack, who declared his full assent to the wishes of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nAscertaining that the Chief's opposition came from Indians living\r\neastwardly of Heywood Sound, the undersigned determined to modify\r\nthe propositions of the Government, so as to meet in some degree\r\nthe objections from that quarter.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly adjourned the council until the following Monday,\r\nthe first day of meeting being Saturday, informing the Indians that\r\nthose who were disposed to continue the negotiations would remain\r\nwhile those who had resolved to reject every proposition of the\r\nGovernment might go home. He also informed them that no threats or\r\nintimidation would be allowed, and that any one who should attempt\r\nviolence would be surely punished. Nearly all the Indians remained\r\nor returned on Monday, and being apprised of the nature of the\r\nproposition the undersigned intended to submit, namely, to exclude\r\nthat part of the island eastwardly of the Manitoulin Gulf and\r\nHeywood Sound from the proposed agreement, they came to the\r\nadjourned meeting in a more friendly mood and expressed their\r\nwillingness to surrender for sale and settlement all that part of\r\nthe island westwardly of the Gulf and Sound.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned submits herewith the deed or instrument which embodies\r\nthe agreement made and concluded between the respective parties. It\r\nwas executed by the undersigned and the Deputy-Superintendent of\r\nIndian Affairs on behalf of the Government, and by nineteen of the\r\nChiefs and principal men on behalf of the Indians.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the modification of the terms of agreement\r\nauthorized by the Order in Council as above-mentioned and the\r\naddition of other terms deemed necessary to prevent future\r\ndifficulty, and which will be found in the instrument, the\r\nundersigned caused a provision to be inserted that it was not to\r\ntake effect until approved by the Governor-General in Council.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned therefore now begs to submit the same for such\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n                      (Signed)      WM. McDOUGALL,\r\n                        Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE STONE FORT AND MANITOBA POST TREATIES NUMBERS ONE AND TWO\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1871, the late Honorable Joseph Howe, then Secretary of\r\nState of Canada, recommended the appointment by the Privy Council\r\nof Canada, of Mr. Wemyss McKenzie Simpson, as Indian Commissioner,\r\nin consequence of \"the necessity of arranging with the bands of\r\nIndians inhabiting the tract of country between Thunder Bay and the\r\nStone Fort, for the cession, subject to certain reserves such as\r\nthey should select, of the lands occupied by them.\" Mr. Simpson\r\naccepted the appointment, and in company with Messrs. S. J. Dawson\r\nand Robert Pether visited the Ojjibewas or Chippawa Indians,\r\nbetween Thunder Bay and the north-west angle of the Lake of the\r\nWoods, and took the initiatory steps for securing a treaty with\r\nthem thereafter. On his arrival at Fort Garry, he put himself, as\r\ndirected by his instructions, in communication with his Honor, the\r\nHon. A. G. Archibald, then Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba and the\r\nNorth-West Territories. A conference took place between His Honor,\r\nMessrs. Simpson, Dawson and Pether, and the Hon. James McKay, a\r\nmember, at that time, of the Executive Council of Manitoba, and\r\nhimself a half-breed intimately acquainted with the Indian tribes,\r\nand possessed of much influence over them. The Indians in Manitoba,\r\nin the fall of 1870, had applied to the Lieutenant-Governor to\r\nenter into a treaty with them, and had been informed that in the\r\nensuing year negotiations would be opened with them. They were\r\nfull of uneasiness, owing to the influx of population, denied\r\nthe validity of the Selkirk Treaty, and had in some instances\r\nobstructed settlers and surveyors. In view of the anxiety and\r\nuneasiness prevailing, those gentlemen were of opinion \"that it was\r\ndesirable to secure the extinction of the Indian title not only\r\nto the lands within Manitoba, but also to so much of the timber\r\ngrounds east and north of the Province as were required for\r\nimmediate entry and use, and also of a large tract of cultivable\r\nground west of the Portage, where there were very few Indian\r\ninhabitants.\" It was therefore resolved to open negotiations at the\r\nLower Fort Garry, or Stone Fort, with the Indians of the Province,\r\nand certain adjacent timber districts, and with the Indians of the\r\nother districts at Manitoba Post, a Hudson's Bay fort, at the north\r\nend of Lake Manitoba, the territory being occupied principally by\r\none nation, the Chippawas, of whom the Saulteaux of the lakes are a\r\nbranch, although there are also a number of Swampy Crees resident\r\nwithin it.\r\n\r\nMr. Simpson accordingly issued proclamations, inviting the Indians\r\nto meet him on the 25th of July and 17th of August, 1871, at\r\nthese points respectively, to negotiate an Indian treaty. The\r\nLieutenant-Governor also issued a proclamation forbidding the sale\r\nor gift of intoxicating liquors during the negotiation of the\r\ntreaty, and applied to Major Irvine to detail a few of the troops\r\nunder his command to preserve order, which request was acceded to.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor and Mr. Simpson arrived at the Stone Fort\r\non the 24th of July, 1871, but as the Indians had not all arrived\r\nthe meeting was postponed till the 27th, when a thousand Indians\r\nwere found to have assembled, and a considerable number of\r\nhalf-breeds and other inhabitants of the country were present,\r\nawaiting with anxiety to learn the policy of the Government.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Governor Archibald, after the Indians were assembled\r\nopened the proceedings by delivering the following address:\r\n\r\n\"On the 13th September last, on my first arrival in the country,\r\nI met a number of you at the mission, I told you I could not then\r\nnegotiate a Treaty with the Indians, but that I was charged by your\r\nGreat Mother, the Queen, to tell you that she had been very glad\r\nto see that you had acted during the troubles like good and true\r\nchildren of your Great Mother. I told you also that as soon as\r\npossible you would all be called together to consider the terms of\r\na treaty to be entered into between you and your Great Mother.\r\n\r\n\"I advised you to disperse to your homes, and gave you some\r\nammunition to enable you to gain a livelihood during the winter\r\nby hunting.\r\n\r\n\"I promised that in the spring you would be sent for, and that\r\neither I, or some person directly appointed to represent your Great\r\nMother, should be here to meet you, and notice would be given you\r\nwhen to convene at this place to talk over what was right to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\"Early in the spring, Mr. Simpson, who sits beside me, was made\r\nCommissioner. He left his home at once for this Province, by Rainy\r\nLake and the Lake of the Woods.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians of the lake districts meet, as you know, on Rainy\r\nRiver yearly, about the 20th June, to fish for sturgeon, I and they\r\ncould not be called together sooner.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Simpson met them there at that time, and talked over their\r\naffairs with them, and made certain arrangements with them. He then\r\nhurried on to see you, and reached this Province a week ago last\r\nSunday. He then sent messengers at once to all the Indians within\r\ncertain bounds, asking them to meet him here on the 25th day of\r\nJuly. Some of you were unable to come so soon, and he has\r\ntherefore, at the instance of those who were here, waited till\r\nto-day to open the talk. I believe that now you are all arrived,\r\nand ready to proceed to business.\r\n\r\n\"It will be the duty of the Commissioner to talk to you on the\r\nparticular details of the treaty, and I will give place to him\r\npresently, but there are one or two things of a general kind which\r\nI would like, before I close, to bring to your notice, for you to\r\nthink about among yourselves.\r\n\r\n\"First. Your Great Mother, the Queen, wishes to do justice to all\r\nher children alike. She will deal fairly with those of the setting\r\nsun, just as she would with those of the rising sun. She wishes\r\norder and peace to reign through all her country, and while her arm\r\nis strong to punish the wicked man, her hand is also open to reward\r\nthe good man everywhere in her Dominions.\r\n\r\n\"Your Great Mother wishes the good of all races under her sway. She\r\nwishes her red children to be happy and contented. She wishes them\r\nto live in comfort. She would like them to adopt the habits of the\r\nwhites, to till land and raise food, and store it up against a\r\ntime of want. She thinks this would be the best thing for her red\r\nchildren to do, that it would make them safer from famine and\r\ndistress, and make their homes more comfortable.\r\n\r\n\"But the Queen, though she may think it good for you to adopt\r\ncivilized habits, has no idea of compelling you to do so. This she\r\nleaves to your choice, and you need not live like the white man\r\nunless you can be persuaded to do so of your own free will. Many\r\nof you, however, are already doing this.\r\n\r\n\"I drove yesterday through the village below this Fort. There I saw\r\nmany well-built houses, and many well-tilled fields with wheat and\r\nbarley and potatoes growing, and giving promise of plenty for the\r\nwinter to come. The people who till these fields and live in these\r\nhouses are men of your own race, and they shew that you can live\r\nand prosper and provide like the white man.\r\n\r\n\"What I say in my drive is enough to prove that even if there was\r\nnot a buffalo or a fur bearing animal in the country, you could\r\nlive and be surrounded with comfort by what you can raise from\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\n\"Your Great Mother, therefore, will lay aside for you 'lots' of\r\nland to be used by you and your children forever. She will not\r\nallow the white man to intrude upon these lots. She will make rules\r\nto keep them for you, so that as long as the sun shall shine, there\r\nshall be no Indian who has not a place that he can call his home,\r\nwhere he can go and pitch his camp or if he chooses build his house\r\nand till his land.\r\n\r\n\"These reserves will be large enough, but you must not expect them\r\nto be larger than will be enough to give a farm to each family,\r\nwhere farms shall be required. They will enable you to earn a\r\nliving should the chase fail, and should you choose to get your\r\nliving by tilling, you must not expect to have included in your\r\nreserve more of hay grounds than will be reasonably sufficient for\r\nyour purposes in case you adopt the habits of farmers. The old\r\nsettlers and the settlers that are coming in, must be dealt with on\r\nthe principles of fairness and justice as well as yourselves. Your\r\nGreat Mother knows no difference between any of her people. Another\r\nthing I want you to think over is this: in laying aside these\r\nreserves, and in everything else that the Queen shall do for you,\r\nyou must understand that she can do for you no more than she has\r\ndone for her red children in the East. If she were to do more for\r\nyou that would be unjust for them. She will not do less for you\r\nbecause you are all her children alike, and she must treat you all\r\nalike.\r\n\r\n\"When you have made your treaty you will still be free to hunt over\r\nmuch of the land included in the treaty. Much of it is rocky and\r\nunfit for cultivation, much of it that is wooded is beyond the\r\nplaces where the white man will require to go, at all events for\r\nsome time to come. Till these lands are needed for use you will\r\nbe free to hunt over them, and make all the use of them which you\r\nhave made in the past. But when lands are needed to be tilled or\r\noccupied, you must not go on them any more. There will still be\r\nplenty of land that is neither tilled nor occupied where you can\r\ngo and roam and hunt as you have always done, and, if you wish to\r\nfarm, you will go to your own reserve where you will find a place\r\nready for you to live on and cultivate.\r\n\r\n\"There is another thing I have to say to you. Your Great Mother\r\ncannot come here herself to talk with you, but she has sent a\r\nmessenger who has her confidence.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Simpson will tell you truly all her wishes. As the Queen has\r\nmade her choice of a chief to represent her, you must, on your\r\npart, point out to us the chiefs you wish to represent you, as the\r\npersons you have faith in.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Simpson cannot talk to all your braves and people, but when he\r\ntalks to chiefs who have your confidence he is talking to you all,\r\nand when he hears the voice of one of your chiefs whom you name he\r\nwill hear the voice of you all. It is for you to say who shall talk\r\nfor you, and also who shall be your chief men. Let them be good\r\nIndians, who know your wishes and whom you have faith in.\r\n\r\n\"You will look to the Commissioner to fulfil everything he agrees\r\nto do, and the Queen will look to the chiefs you name to us, to see\r\nthat you keep your parts of the agreement.\r\n\r\n\"It is our wish to deal with you fairly and frankly.\r\n\r\n\"If you have any questions to ask, ask them, if you have anything\r\nyou wish the Queen to know, speak out plainly.\r\n\r\n\"Now chiefs and braves and people, I introduce to you Mr. Simpson,\r\nwho will say anything he thinks fit in addition to what I have\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"When you hear his voice you are listening to your Great Mother the\r\nQueen, whom God bless and preserve long to reign over us.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Simpson also addressed them, and thereafter, in compliance with\r\na request of the Lieutenant-Governor, the Indians retired to select\r\ntheir chiefs and principal spokesmen.\r\n\r\nOn the next day the conference was resumed, the chiefs and\r\nspokesmen being presented. The Indians, on being asked to express\r\ntheir views, \"stated that there was a cloud before them which made\r\nthings dark, and they did not wish to commence the proceedings till\r\nthe cloud was dispersed.\" On inquiry it was ascertained that they\r\nreferred to the imprisonment of four Swampy Cree Indians, who\r\nhad been convicted under a local law, of breach of contract, as\r\nboatmen, with the Hudson's Bay Company, and on default of payment\r\nof a fine, had been sent to prison. The Lieutenant-Governor, as a\r\nmatter of favor, ordered the release of these prisoners, and the\r\nsky became clear. Next day the Indians met again and declared that\r\nthey would never again raise their voice against the enforcement\r\nof the law, but much difficulty was experienced in getting them\r\nto understand the views of the Government--they wishing to have\r\ntwo-thirds of the Province as a reserve. Eventually on the 3rd\r\nof August, 1871, a treaty was concluded, its principal features\r\nbeing the relinquishment to Her Majesty of the Indian title; the\r\nreserving of tracts of land for the Indians, sufficient to furnish\r\n160 acres of land to each family of five; providing for the\r\nmaintenance of schools, and prohibition of the sale of intoxicating\r\nliquors on the reserves; a present of three dollars per head to the\r\nIndians and the payment to them of an annuity of three dollars per\r\nhead. [Footnote: In consequence of misunderstandings having arisen,\r\nowing to the Indians alleging that certain promises had been made\r\nto them which were not specified in these treaties, a revision of\r\nthem became necessary, and was effected in 1875, as will be seen\r\nreported hereafter.] (See copy of treaty which will be found in\r\nthe Appendix.) On the 21st of August Mr. Commissioner Simpson,\r\naccompanied by the Lieutenant-Governor, the Hon. James McKay,\r\nand Mr. Molyneux St. John (lately Sheriff of the North-West\r\nTerritories), met the Indians at Manitoba Post, and found them\r\ndisposed to accept the terms of the treaty made at the Stone Fort,\r\nwith which they had already become familiar, so that little time\r\nwas lost in effecting a treaty with them as they had no special\r\nterms to prefer. By these two treaties, there was acquired by the\r\nCrown, the extinguishment of the Indian title in Manitoba, and in\r\na tract of country fully equal in resources beyond it.\r\n\r\nHaving submitted these preliminary remarks, I conclude my notice\r\nof these treaties by quoting, as matter alike of historical record\r\nand practical interest, the despatches of Lieutenant-Governor\r\nArchibald and the excellent and instructive report, addressed to\r\nthe Secretary of State by Mr. Simpson, embracing as it does a full\r\nand graphic narrative of the proceedings which took place at the\r\nnegotiation of these treaties, and of the difficulties which were\r\nencountered by the Commissioner, and the mode in which they were\r\novercome.\r\n\r\n                     GOVERNMENT HOUSE,\r\n                            SILVER HEIGHTS July 32nd, 1871.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to enclose you copy of a proclamation I have\r\ncaused to be issued with a view to prevent the danger arising from\r\nintoxicating drinks being given to the Indians, on the occasion of\r\nthe meeting to negotiate a treaty.\r\n\r\nI look upon the proceedings, we are now initiating as important\r\nin their bearing upon our relations to the Indians of the whole\r\ncontinent. In fact the terms we now agree upon will probably shape\r\nthe arrangements we shall have to make with all the Indians between\r\nthe Red River and the Rocky Mountains. It will therefore be well to\r\nneglect nothing that is within our power to enable us to start\r\nfairly with the negotiations.\r\n\r\nWith that view, I have, amongst other things, asked Major Irvine\r\nto detail a few of his troops to be present at the opening of the\r\ntreaty. Military display has always a great effect on savages, and\r\nthe presence even of a few troops will have a good tendency.\r\n\r\nI fear we shall have to incur a considerable expenditure for\r\npresents of food, etc. during the negotiations; but any cost for\r\nthat purpose I shall deem a matter of minor consequence. The real\r\nburden to be considered is that which has to be borne in each\r\nrecurring year.\r\n\r\nI doubt if it will be found practicable to make arrangements upon\r\nso favorable a basis as that prescribed by His Excellency the\r\nGovernor-General as the maximum to be allowed, in case of a treaty\r\nwith the Lake Indians.\r\n\r\nNor indeed would it be right, if we look to what we receive, to\r\nmeasure the benefits we derive from coming into possession of the\r\nmagnificent territory we are appropriating here by what would be\r\nfair to allow for the rocks and swamps and muskegs of the lake\r\ncountry east of this Province.\r\n\r\nBut to this subject I shall probably take occasion to call your\r\nattention at an early day.\r\n\r\n                      I have etc.,\r\n                                    ADAMS G. ARCHIBALD.\r\nTHE HONORABLE\r\n    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE PROVINCES,\r\n                                        Ottawa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWER FORT GARRY, July 20th, 1871.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to inform you that on Monday last I came to\r\nthis Fort with the Commissioner to meet the Indians called here,\r\nwith a view to negotiate a treaty, intending to open the business\r\non Tuesday morning.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, however, on inquiry, that some bands of Indians had\r\nnot arrived on Tuesday morning, and we were therefore obliged to\r\npostpone the opening of the meeting till Thursday. On that day the\r\nIndians from all the sections of the country to which the\r\ninvitation extended were found present to the number of about one\r\nthousand. A considerable body of half-breeds and other inhabitants\r\nof the country were also present, awaiting with some anxiety to\r\nlearn what should be announced as the policy of the Government.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a memorandum of the observations with which I opened\r\nthe meeting. On reading them you will observe one or two points\r\nwhich may require some explanation.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the treaty with the Earl of Selkirk, certain Indians\r\nsigned as Chiefs and representatives of their people. Some of the\r\nIndians now deny that these men ever were Chiefs or had authority\r\nto sign the treaty.\r\n\r\nWith a view therefore to avoid a recurrence of any such question we\r\nasked the Indians, as a first step, to agree among themselves in\r\nselecting their Chiefs and then to present them to us and have\r\ntheir names and authority recorded.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Indians seem to have false ideas of the meaning\r\nof a reserve. They have been led to suppose that large tracts of\r\nground were to be set aside for them as hunting grounds, including\r\ntimber lands, of which they might sell the wood as if they were\r\nproprietors of the soil.\r\n\r\nI wished to correct this idea at the outset.\r\n\r\nMr. Simpson followed me with some observations in the same strain,\r\nafter which the Indians retired to select their Chiefs and\r\nspokesmen.\r\n\r\nOn Friday morning the Chiefs and spokesmen were duly presented,\r\nand after their names were recorded, the Indians were invited to\r\nexpress their views.\r\n\r\nAfter some delay they stated that there was a cloud before them\r\nwhich made things dark, and they did not wish to commence the\r\nproceedings till the cloud was dispersed.\r\n\r\nOn inquiring into their meaning, I found that they were referring\r\nto some four of their number who were prisoners in gaol. It seems\r\nthat some Swampy Indians had entered into a contract with the\r\nHudson's Bay Company as boatmen, and had deserted, and had been\r\nbrought up before magistrates under a local law of last session,\r\nand fined, and in default of payment sent to prison for forty days.\r\n\r\nOf this term some considerable part had expired. A few of the\r\noffenders had paid their fines, but there were still four Indians\r\nremaining in prison.\r\n\r\nOn learning the facts I told the Indians that I could not listen\r\nto them if they made a demand for the release of the Indians as a\r\nmatter of right; that every subject of the Queen, whether Indian,\r\nhalf-breed or white, was equal in the eye of the law; that every\r\noffender against the law must be punished, whatever race he\r\nbelonged to; but I said that on the opening of negotiations with\r\nthem the Queen would like to see all her Indians taking part in\r\nthem, and if the whole body present were to ask as a matter of\r\ngrace and favor, under the circumstances, that their brethren\r\nshould be released, Her Majesty would be willing to consent to\r\ntheir discharge; she would grant as a favor what she must refuse if\r\nasked for on any other ground. They replied by saying that they\r\nbegged it as a matter of favor only. Thereupon I acceded to their\r\nrequest, and directed the discharge of the four Indians. This was\r\nreceived with great satisfaction. I explained again, that there\r\nmight be no misunderstanding about it, that henceforth every\r\noffender against the law must be punished. They all expressed their\r\nacquiescence in what I said. The discharge of the prisoners had an\r\nexcellent effect.\r\n\r\nNext morning the Indians, through one of their spokesmen, declared\r\nin presence of the whole body assembled that from this time they\r\nwould never raise their voice against the law being enforced. After\r\nthe order of the release, the Chiefs and spokesmen addressed us\r\nquestions were asked and answered, and some progress made in the\r\nnegotiations. Eventually the meeting adjourned till this morning\r\nat ten o'clock.\r\n\r\nA general acquiescence in the views laid down by Mr. Simpson and\r\nmyself was expressed, but it was quite clear by the proceedings of\r\nto-day, that our views were imperfectly apprehended. When we met\r\nthis morning, the Indians were invited to state their wishes as\r\nto the reserves, they were to say how much they thought would be\r\nsufficient, and whether they wished them all in one or in several\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nIn defining the limits of their reserves, so far as we could see,\r\nthey wished to have about two-thirds of the Province. We heard them\r\nout, and then told them it was quite clear that they had entirely\r\nmisunderstood the meaning and intention of reserves. We explained\r\nthe object of these in something like the language of the\r\nmemorandum enclosed, and then told them it was of no use for\r\nthem to entertain any such ideas, which were entirely out of\r\nthe question. We told them that whether they wished it or not,\r\nimmigrants would come in and fill up the country; that every year\r\nfrom this one twice as many in number as their whole people there\r\nassembled would pour into the Province, and in a little while would\r\nspread all over it, and that now was the time for them to come to\r\nan arrangement that would secure homes and annuities for themselves\r\nand their children.\r\n\r\nWe told them that what we proposed to allow them was an extent of\r\none hundred and sixty acres for each family of five, or in that\r\nproportion; that they might have their land where they chose,\r\nnot interfering with existing occupants, that we should allow an\r\nannuity of twelve dollars for every family of five, or in that\r\nproportion per head. We requested them to think over these\r\npropositions till Monday morning.\r\n\r\nIf they thought it better to have no treaty at all, they might do\r\nwithout one, but they must make up their minds; if there was to be\r\na treaty, it must be on a basis like that offered.\r\n\r\nThat under some such arrangements, the Indians in the east were\r\nliving happy and contented enjoying themselves, drawing their\r\nannuities, and satisfied with their position.\r\n\r\nThe observations seemed to command the acquiescence of the\r\nmajority, and on Monday morning we hope to meet them in a better\r\nframe for the discussion and settlement of the treaty.\r\n\r\n                 I have, etc.,\r\n                                ADAMS G. ARCHIBALD.\r\nThe Honorable\r\n    The Secretary of State for the Provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWER FORT GARRY, MANITOBA, July 30th, 1871.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to inform you, for the information of His\r\nExcellency the Governor-General, that I arrived in this Province on\r\nthe 16th instant, and, after consultation with the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nof Manitoba, determined upon summoning the Indians of this part of the\r\ncountry to a conference for the purpose of negotiating a treaty at\r\nLower Fort Garry, on Tuesday, the 25th instant, leaving for a future\r\ndate the negotiation with the Indians westward of and outside of the\r\nProvince of Manitoba.\r\n\r\nProclamations were issued, and every means taken to insure the\r\nattendance of the Indians, and on Monday, the 24th instant, I\r\nproceeded to Lower Fort Garry, where I met His Excellency the\r\nLieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, finding that only a small portion of the Indians had\r\narrived, we held a preliminary conference with Henry Prince--the\r\nChief of the Swampies and Chippewas residing on what is known as\r\nthe Indian Reserve, between Lower Fort Garry and Lake Winnipeg--at\r\nwhich we arranged a meeting for the next day at twelve o'clock, for\r\nthe purpose of ascertaining the names of the Chiefs and head men of\r\nthe several tribes. At this preliminary conference, Henry Prince\r\nsaid that he could not then enter upon any negotiations, as he was\r\nnot empowered to speak or act for those bands of Indians not then\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it was found necessary to feed the Indians\r\nassembled here, and accordingly provisions were purchased and\r\nrations served out.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 26th, His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor and\r\nmyself met those Indians who had arrived, in council, and addressed\r\nthem with the view of explaining the purport of my commission, and\r\nthe matters which were to form the subject of a treaty.\r\n\r\nIt having been reported that the Indians who had not then arrived\r\nwere on their road here, we agreed that another meeting should take\r\nplace on the following day, at which the Chiefs and head men were\r\nto be presented to us.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, pursuant to appointment, we again met the Indians,\r\nwhen the Chiefs and head men of the several bands present were\r\nnamed and presented. I then explained to them the nature of\r\nIndian reserves, and desired them to determine, in council among\r\nthemselves, the locality in which they desired their reserves to\r\nbe laid out.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 28th, we again met the Indians, but they were not\r\nthen prepared to state their demands, and another meeting was\r\nappointed for Saturday.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 29th, we again met them, all having by this time\r\narrived. When the subject of reserves came up, it was found that\r\nthe Indians had misunderstood the object of these reservations, for\r\ntheir demands in this respect were utterly out of the question.\r\nAfter a prolonged discussion with them, I consulted with the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, and determined to let them at once understand\r\nthe terms that I was prepared to offer and I pointed out that the\r\nterms offered were those which would receive Her Majesty's consent.\r\nOn further explanation of the subject, the Indians appeared to be\r\nsatisfied, and willing to acquiesce in our arrangements as\r\nhereinafter mentioned, and having given them diagrams showing the\r\nsize of the lots they would individually become possessed of, and\r\nhaving informed them of the amount of their annuity, it was finally\r\nsettled that they should meet on Monday, the 31st and acquaint me\r\nwith their decision.\r\n\r\nThe reserves will comprise sufficient land to give each family of\r\nfive persons one hundred and sixty acres, or in like proportion\r\ntogether with an annual payment in perpetuity of twelve dollars\r\nfor each family of five persons, or in like proportion.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can judge, I am inclined to think that the Indians will\r\naccept these terms.\r\n\r\nI am happy to be able to say that the precautions taken to prevent\r\nthe introduction of liquor amongst the Indians have been wholly\r\nsuccessful, and that perfect order and contentment have prevailed\r\nup to the present time.\r\n\r\n                        I have etc.\r\n                                 WEMYSS M. SIMPSON,\r\n                                      Indian Commissioner.\r\nThe Honorable\r\n    The Secretary of State for the Provinces,\r\n                                       Ottawa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOTTAWA, November 3rd, 1871.\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE\r\n     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE PROVINCES,\r\n                                   Ottawa\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to submit to you, for the information of\r\nHis Excellency the Governor-General, a report of my negotiations\r\nwith the Indians of the Province of Manitoba, and with certain of\r\nthe Indians of the North-West Territory, entered upon by me, in\r\naccordance with your instructions, dated 3rd May, 1871.\r\n\r\nHaving, in association with S. J. Dawson, Esq., and Robert Pether,\r\nEsq., effected a preliminary arrangement with the Indians of Rainy\r\nLake, the particulars of which I have already had the honor of\r\nreporting to you in my Report, dated July 11th, 1871, I proceeded\r\nby the Lake of the Woods and Dawson Road to Fort Garry, at which\r\nplace I arrived on the 16th July.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind your desire that I should confer with the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Manitoba, I called upon Mr. Archibald, and\r\nlearned from him that the Indians were anxiously awaiting my\r\narrival, and were much excited on the subject of their lands being\r\noccupied without attention being first given to their claims for\r\ncompensation. Amongst the settlers, also, an uneasy feeling\r\nexisted, arising partly from the often-repeated demands of the\r\nIndians for a treaty with themselves, and partly from the fact that\r\ncertain settlers in the neighborhood of Portage la Prairie and\r\nother parts of the Province, had been warned by the Indians not to\r\ncut wood or otherwise take possession of the lands upon which they\r\nwere squatting. The Indians, it appeared, consented to their\r\nremaining on their holdings until sufficient time had been allowed\r\nfor my arrival, and the conclusion of a treaty; but they were\r\nunwilling to allow the settlers the free use of the country for\r\nthemselves or their cattle. Mr. Archibald and those residents in\r\nthe Province of Manitoba with whom I conversed on the subject,\r\nappeared to think that no time should be lost in meeting the\r\nIndians, as some assurances had already been given them that a\r\ntreaty would be made with them during the summer of 1871; and I\r\ntherefore, at once, issued notices calling certain of the Indians\r\ntogether, naming two places at which I would meet them. The first\r\nmeeting, to which were asked the Indians of the Province and\r\ncertain others on the eastern side, was to be held on the 25th of\r\nJuly, at the Stone Fort, a Hudson's Bay Company's Post, situated\r\non the Red River, about twenty miles northward of Fort Garry--a\r\nlocality chosen as being the most central for those invited. The\r\nsecond meeting was appointed to be held on August 17th, at Manitoba\r\nPost, a Hudson's Bay Company's Post, at the north-west extremity of\r\nLake Manitoba, as it was deemed that such of the bands of Indians\r\nresiding without the limits of the Province of Manitoba, as I\r\npurposed to deal with at present, would meet there more readily\r\nthan elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 24th of July, I met the Lieutenant-Governor of\r\nManitoba at the Stone Fort; but negotiations were unavoidably\r\ndelayed, owing to the fact that only one band of Indians had\r\narrived, and that until all were on the spot those present declined\r\nto discuss the subject of a treaty, except in an informal manner.\r\nAmongst these, as amongst other Indians with whom I have come in\r\ncontact, there exists great jealousy of one another, in all matters\r\nrelating to their communications with the officials of Her Majesty;\r\nand in order to facilitate the object in view, it was most\r\ndesirable that suspicion and jealousy of all kinds should be\r\nallayed. The fact of the Commissioner having arrived was sufficient\r\nevidence of the good intentions of Her Majesty's Government, and it\r\nseemed better to await the arrival of all whom I had summoned, than\r\nto press matters to an issue while any were absent. This, however,\r\nentailed the necessity of feeding those who were already there, and\r\nothers as they arrived.\r\n\r\nIt is customary in dealing with Indians to do so, and in this case\r\nit was absolutely necessary, for, obviously, it would have been\r\nimpossible to invite those people from a distance, and then leave\r\nthem to starve at our doors, or, in search of food, to plunder the\r\nneighborhood into which they had been introduced. At that season of\r\nthe year the Indians were not engaged in fishing or hunting, and\r\nconsequently large numbers of men, women and children attended at\r\nthe place of meeting, for all of whom food was provided. The price\r\nof provisions, even at the lowest price for which they could be\r\nobtained, was high, pork being fifty dollars a barrel, and flour\r\ntwenty shillings sterling per hundred, and such cattle as I was\r\nable to purchase L16 per head, so that the expense of keeping\r\nthe Indians during the negotiation of treaty and payment of the\r\ngratuity, which lasted eleven days, forms no small share of the\r\ntotal expenditure. In addition to this expense, it was thought\r\nnecessary by the Lieutenant-Governor that Major Irvine commanding\r\nthe troops at Fort Garry should be requested to furnish a guard at\r\nthe Stone Fort during the negotiations, and that there should be at\r\nhand, also, a force of constabulary, for the purpose of preventing\r\nthe introduction of liquor amongst the Indian encampments. Other\r\nexpenses of a somewhat similar nature were incurred, which would be\r\ntotally unnecessary upon any future occasion of payment being made\r\nto the Indians of Manitoba. I may here refer to the apparently\r\nprolonged duration of the first negotiation, and explain, in\r\nreference thereto, the causes, or some of them, that entailed the\r\nloss of time and attendant expense. For some time a doubt has\r\nexisted whether the Chief, nominally at the head of the Indians of\r\nthe Indian settlement, possessed the good will and confidence of\r\nthat band; and I thought it advisable to require that the several\r\nbands of Indians should select such Chiefs as they thought proper,\r\nand present these men as their authorized Chiefs, before anything\r\nwas said as to the terms of a treaty. The Indians having acquiesced\r\nin this proposal, forthwith proceeded to such election; but the\r\nproceeding apparently involved discussion and consideration amongst\r\nthemselves, and two days elapsed before the men chosen were\r\npresented for recognition, and the business of the meeting\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nWhen the peculiar circumstances surrounding the position of the\r\nIndians of the Province were pointed out, the future of the country\r\npredicted, and the views and intentions of the Government explained\r\nby the Lieutenant-Governor and myself, the Indians professed a\r\ndesire for time to think over what had been said before making any\r\nreply; and when their answer came it proved to contain demands of\r\nsuch an exorbitant nature, that much time was spent in reducing\r\ntheir terms to a basis upon which an arrangement could be made.\r\n\r\nEvery band had its spokesman in addition to its Chief, and each\r\nseemed to vie with another in the dimensions of their requirements.\r\nI may mention, as an illustration, that in the matter of reserves,\r\nthe quantity of land demanded for each band amounted to about three\r\ntownships per Indian, and included the greater part of the settled\r\nportions of the Province. It was not until the 3rd of August, or\r\nnine days after the first meeting, that the basis of arrangement\r\nwas arrived at, upon which is founded the treaty of that date.\r\nThen, and by means of mutual concessions, the following terms were\r\nagreed upon. For the cession of the country described in the treaty\r\nreferred to, and comprising the Province of Manitoba, and certain\r\ncountry in the north-east thereof, every Indian was to receive a\r\nsum of three dollars a year in perpetuity, and a reserve was to he\r\nset apart for each band, of sufficient size to allow one hundred\r\nand sixty acres to each family of five persons, or in like\r\nproportion as the family might be greater or less than five. As\r\neach Indian settled down upon his share of the reserve, and\r\ncommenced the cultivation of his land, he was to receive a plough\r\nand harrow. Each Chief was to receive a cow and a male and female\r\nof the smaller kinds of animals bred upon a farm. There was to be\r\na bull for the general use of each reserve. In addition to this,\r\neach Chief was to receive a dress, a flag and a medal, as marks of\r\ndistinction; and each Chief, with the exception of Bozawequare, the\r\nChief of the Portage band, was to receive a buggy, or light spring\r\nwaggon. Two councillors and two braves of each band were to receive\r\na dress, somewhat inferior to that provided for the Chiefs, and\r\nthe braves and councillors of the Portage band excepted, were to\r\nreceive a buggy. Every Indian was to receive a gratuity of three\r\ndollars, which, though given as a payment for good behaviour, was\r\nto be understood to cover all dimensions for the past.\r\n\r\nOn this basis the treaty was signed by myself and the several Chiefs,\r\non behalf of themselves and their respective bands, on the 3rd of\r\nAugust, 1871, and on the following day the payment commenced.\r\n\r\nThe three dollars gratuity, above referred to, will not occur in\r\nthe ordinary annual payments to the Indians of Manitoba, and,\r\nthough doubling the amount paid this year, may now properly be\r\nregarded as belonging to a previous year, but only now liquidated.\r\n\r\nA large number of Indians, entitled to share in the treaty, were\r\nabsent on the 3rd August, and in the belief that I should, almost\r\nimmediately, be able to obtain a more accurate knowledge than I\r\npossessed of the numbers of the several bands, I paid to each\r\nperson present only three dollars--the gratuity--postponing for\r\na short time the first annual payment. Having completed this\r\ndisbursement, I prepared to start for Manitoba Post, to open\r\nnegotiations with the Indians on the immediate north and north-west\r\nborders of the Province of Manitoba, promising however to visit the\r\nseveral bands of the first treaty, in their own districts, and to\r\nthere pay them. By this means the necessity for their leaving their\r\nown homes, and for the Government's feeding them while they were\r\nbeing paid, and during their journey home, was avoided.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the treaty at Manitoba Post, of which mention\r\nis herein after made, I visited Portage la Prairie, the Indian\r\nsettlement at St. Peter's, Riviere Marais, and the Town of\r\nWinnipeg, according to my promise, and at each place, with the\r\nexception of Riviere Marais, found the Indians satisfied with the\r\ntreaty and awaiting their payment. At Riviere Marais, which was\r\nthe rendezvous appointed by the bands living in the neighborhood\r\nof Pembina, I found that the Indians had either misunderstood the\r\nadvice given them by parties in the settlement, well disposed\r\ntowards the treaty, or, as I have some reason to believe had become\r\nunsettled by the representations made by persons in the vicinity\r\nof Pembina, whose interests lay elsewhere than in the Province of\r\nManitoba; for, on my announcing my readiness to pay them, they\r\ndemurred at receiving their money until some further concessions\r\nhad been made by me.\r\n\r\nWith a view to inducing the Indians to adopt the habits and labors\r\nof civilization, it had been agreed, at the signing of the treaty\r\nas before mentioned, to give certain animals as a nucleus for\r\nstocking the several reserves, together with certain farming\r\nimplements; and it was now represented to me by the spokesman of\r\nthe bands, that as the Queen had, with that kindness of heart which\r\ndistinguished her dealings with her red children, expressed a\r\ndesire to see the Indians discard their former precarious mode of\r\nliving and adopt the agricultural pursuits of the white man, they\r\nwere desirous of acceding to the wish of their great Mother, and\r\nwere now prepared to receive the gifts she had been good enough to\r\nspeak of, through her Commissioner, in full. But, as it could make\r\nno difference whatever to their great Mother whether these things\r\nwere given in kind or in money value, her red children of the\r\nPembina bands were resolved to receive them in the latter form.\r\nI had put a valuation upon all the articles mentioned in the\r\nsupplement to the treaty, and could go no further in the matter\r\nunless I was prepared to pay them for all these articles at the\r\nrates they would now proceed to mention. I declined to comply\r\nwith the request, and they declined to receive their first annual\r\npayment, whereupon I broke up my camp and returned to Winnipeg. As\r\nI foresaw at the time this determination on their part was shortly\r\nrepented, and a number of their leading men were subsequently paid\r\nat Winnipeg, while at the request of the Indians, the money for the\r\nremainder, together with a pay sheet, was forwarded to the officer\r\nin charge of the Hudson's Bay Company's Post at Pembina, with\r\ninstructions to pay the Indians as per list as each might present\r\nhimself. At Portage la Prairie, although the number paid at the\r\nStone Fort was largely increased, there still remained many who,\r\nfrom absence or other causes, were not paid, and by the request of\r\nthe Chief the money was left for these with the officers in charge\r\nof the Hudson's Bay Company's Post, in the same manner as was done\r\nfor the Pembina bands.\r\n\r\nAs I was unable to proceed to Fort Alexander, the payments for the\r\nIndians or for such of them as were present at the signing of the\r\ntreaty, were sent in like manner to the officer in charge of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company's Post at Fort Alexander; but it may be as\r\nwell to mention that the number so paid will fall far short of the\r\ntotal number belonging to that place. The latter remark will apply\r\nto the Pembina band, for their payment was sent as per gratuity\r\nlist, and there must necessarily have been others who did not\r\nreceive payment. All these must receive their back payments during\r\nthe course of next year.\r\n\r\nDuring the payment of the several bands, it was found that in some,\r\nand most notably in the Indian settlement and Broken Head River\r\nBand, a number of those residing among the Indians, and calling\r\nthemselves Indians, are in reality half-breeds, and entitled to\r\nshare in the land grant under the provisions of the Manitoba Act.\r\nI was most particular, therefore, in causing it to be explained,\r\ngenerally and to individuals, that any person now electing to be\r\nclassed with Indians, and receiving the Indian pay and gratuity,\r\nwould, I believed, thereby forfeit his or her right to another\r\ngrant as a half-breed; and in all cases where it was known that\r\na man was a half-breed, the matter, as it affected himself and\r\nhis children, was explained to him, and the choice given him to\r\ncharacterize himself. A very few only decided upon taking their\r\ngrants as half-breeds. The explanation of this apparent sacrifice\r\nis found in the fact that the mass of these persons have lived all\r\ntheir lives on the Indian reserves (so called), and would rather\r\nreceive such benefits as may accrue to them under the Indian\r\ntreaty, than wait the realization of any value in their half-breed\r\ngrant.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba having expressed a desire to\r\nbe present at the negotiation of the treaty at Manitoba Post. His\r\nHonor, accompanied by the Hon. James McKay, proceeded thither\r\nwith me, in company with Mr. Molyneux St. John, the Clerk of the\r\nLegislative Assembly of Manitoba, who had assisted me in the duties\r\nconnected with the former treaty and payments. I left Winnipeg on\r\nthe 13th August, but owing to adverse winds on Lake Manitoba did\r\nnot arrive until two days after the time appointed. I found that,\r\nin the meanwhile, the officer in charge of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany's Post had been obliged to give some provisions to the\r\nIndians pending my arrival, but on my speaking to the leading men\r\nof the bands assembled, it was evident that the Indians of this\r\npart had no special demands to make, but having a knowledge of the\r\nformer treaty, desired to be dealt with in the same manner and on\r\nthe same terms as those adopted by the Indians of the Province of\r\nManitoba.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation with these bands therefore occupied little time and\r\non the 21st August, 1871, a treaty was concluded by which a tract\r\nof country three times as large as the Province of Manitoba was\r\nsurrendered by the Indians to the Crown. Payment in full, that is\r\nto say, the gratuity and the first payment, was at once made; and\r\nI have since written to the officers in charge of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany's Posts within the tract above referred to, requesting them\r\nto procure for me a reliable census of the Indians, parties to this\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nI have referred to the cost of effecting these treaties, and\r\nremarked that it will prove to be exceptional. It may be regarded\r\nas entirely so, as far as the Indians with whom the dealings were\r\nheld are concerned. In the future the annual payment will be only\r\none-half to each Indian of the amount paid this year, for the\r\ngratuity was the same as the payment, and the heavy expense of\r\nfeeding the Indians while at the place of meeting and on their\r\njourney home, will be avoided by the payment being made at or near\r\ntheir own reserves.\r\n\r\nAll the collateral expenses, therefore, of this year, including\r\ndresses, medals, presents to the Indians, etc., etc., will not\r\nappear in the expenses attending during future payments.\r\n\r\nBut it is to be remembered that a large number of Indians, whose\r\nlands were ceded by the second treaty, were not present. The\r\ndistance from the hunting grounds of some to Manitoba Post is\r\nvery great; but while their absence was to be regretted for some\r\nreasons, it effected a very considerable saving in the item of\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nDuring the ensuing season, these persons will probably be found at\r\nthe place where the payments will be made, and will then require\r\ntheir payments as if they had been present at the signing of the\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nOf the land ceded in the Province of Manitoba, it will be hardly\r\nnecessary for me to speak, as His Excellency the Governor-General\r\nis already in possession of accurate information touching its\r\nfertility and resources; but I may observe that, valuable as are\r\nthese lands, they are fully equalled if not exceeded by the country\r\nof which the Government now comes into possession by virtue of\r\nthe treaty concluded at Manitoba Post. Already settlers from the\r\nProvinces in Canada and elsewhere are pushing their way beyond the\r\nlimits of the Province of Manitoba; and there is nothing but the\r\narbitrary limits of that Province, and certain wood and water\r\nadvantages found in the territory beyond it, to distinguish one\r\npart of the country from the other. The fertility that is possessed\r\nby Manitoba is shared by the country and its confines. The water\r\ncourses of the Province are excelled by those of the territory; and\r\nthe want of wood which threatens serious difficulty in the one is\r\nby no means so apparent in the other.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of both parts have a firm belief in the honor and\r\nintegrity of Her Majesty's representatives, and are fully impressed\r\nwith the idea that the amelioration of their present condition\r\nis one of the objects of Her Majesty in making these treaties.\r\nAlthough many years will elapse before they can be regarded as a\r\nsettled population--settled in the sense of following agricultural\r\npursuits--the Indians have already shown a disposition to provide\r\nagainst the vicissitudes of the chase by cultivating small patches\r\nof corn and potatoes. Moreover, in the Province of Manitoba, where\r\nlabor is scarce, Indians give great assistance in gathering in the\r\ncrops. At Portage la Prairie, both Chippawas and Sioux were largely\r\nemployed in the grain field; and in other parishes I found many\r\nfarmers whose employes were nearly all Indians.\r\n\r\nAlthough serious trouble has from time to time occurred across the\r\nboundary line, with Indians of the same tribes, and indeed of the\r\nsame bands as those in Manitoba, there is no reason to fear any\r\ntrouble with those who regard themselves as subjects of Her\r\nMajesty. Their desire is to live at peace with the white man, to\r\ntrade with him, and, when they are disposed, to work for him; and I\r\nbelieve that nothing but gross injustice or oppression will induce\r\nthem either to forget the allegiance which they now claim with\r\npride, or molest the white subjects of the sovereign whom they\r\nregard as their Supreme Chief.\r\n\r\nThe system of an annual payment in money I regard as a good one,\r\nbecause the recipient is enabled to purchase just what he requires\r\nwhen he can get it most cheaply, and it also enables him to buy\r\narticles at second hand, from settlers and others, that are quite\r\nas useful to him as are the same things when new. The sum of three\r\ndollars does not appear to be large enough to enable an Indian to\r\nprovide himself with many of his winter necessaries; but as he\r\nreceives the same amount for his wife or wives, and for each of his\r\nchildren, the aggregate sum is usually sufficient to procure many\r\ncomforts for his family which he would otherwise be compelled to\r\ndeny himself.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nI take this opportunity of acknowledging the assistance afforded\r\nme in successfully completing the two treaties, to which I have\r\nreferred, by His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba, the\r\nHon. James McKay, and the officers of the Hudson's Bay Company. In\r\na country where transport and all other business facilities are\r\nnecessarily so scarce, the services rendered to the Government by\r\nthe officers in charge of the several Hudson's Bay Posts has been\r\nmost opportune and valuable.\r\n\r\n                         I have, etc.,\r\n                                   WEMYSS M. SIMPSON,\r\n                                         Indian Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTREATY NUMBER THREE, OR THE NORTH-WEST ANGLE TREATY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1871 the Privy Council of Canada issued a joint\r\ncommission to Messrs. W. M. Simpson, S. J. Dawson and W. J. Pether,\r\nauthorizing them to treat with the Ojibbeway Indians for the\r\nsurrender to the Crown of the lands they inhabited--covering the\r\narea from the watershed of Lake Superior to the north-west angle of\r\nthe Lake of the Woods, and from the American border to the height\r\nof land from which the streams flow towards the Hudson's Bay. This\r\nstep had become necessary in order to make the route known as \"the\r\nDawson route,\" extending from Prince Arthur's Landing on Lake\r\nSuperior to the north-west angle of the Lake of the Woods, which\r\nwas then being opened up, \"secure for the passage of emigrants\r\nand of the people of the Dominion generally,\" and also to enable\r\nthe Government to throw open for settlement any portion of the\r\nland which might be susceptible of improvement and profitable\r\noccupation. The Commissioners accepted the appointment, and in\r\nJuly, 1871, met the Indians at Fort Francis.\r\n\r\nThe tribes preferred claims for right of way through their country.\r\nThe Commissioners reported \"that they had admitted these to a\r\nlimited extent and had made them presents in provisions and\r\nclothing and were also to pay them a small amount in money, it\r\nbeing fully and distinctly understood by the Indians that these\r\npresents and clothing were accepted by them as an equivalent for\r\nall past claims whatever.\" The Commissioners having explained to\r\nthem fully the intentions of the Government as to obtaining a\r\nsurrender of their territorial rights, and giving in return\r\ntherefor reserves of land and annual payments, asked them to\r\nconsider the proposals calmly* and meet the Commissioners the\r\nsucceeding summer to come to an arrangement. In 1872, the Indians\r\nwere found not to be ready for the making of a treaty and the\r\nsubject was postponed. In the year 1873 a commission was issued to\r\nthe Hon. Alexander Morris, then Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba and\r\nthe North-West Territories, Lieut.-Col. Provencher, who had in the\r\ninterval been appointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs in the place\r\nof Mr. Simpson, who had resigned, and Lindsay Russell Esq., but\r\nthe latter being unable to act, Mr. Dawson, now M.P. for Algoma,\r\nwas appointed Commissioner in his stead. These Commissioners\r\nhaving accepted the duty confided to them, met the Indians at the\r\nnorth-west angle of the Lake of the Woods in the end of September,\r\n1873, and, after protracted and difficult negotiations, succeeded\r\nin effecting a treaty with them. A copy of the treaty will be\r\nfound in the Appendix, and a brief record of the utterances of\r\nthe Indians and of the Commissioners, which was taken down in\r\nshort hand by one of the soldiers of the militia force, is hereto\r\nsubjoined. This treaty was one of great importance, as it not\r\nonly tranquilized the large Indian population affected by it, but\r\neventually shaped the terms of all the treaties, four, five, six\r\nand seven, which have since been made with the Indians of the\r\nNorth-West Territories--who speedily became apprised of the\r\nconcessions which had been granted to the Ojibbeway nation. The\r\nclosing scenes were striking and impressive. The chief speaker,\r\nMawe-do-pe-nais, thus winding up the conference on the part of\r\nthe Indians, in his final address to the Lieutenant-Governor and\r\nhis fellow Commissioners:\r\n\r\n\"Now you see me stand before you all: what has been done here to\r\nday has been done openly before the Great Spirit and before the\r\nnation, and I hope I may never hear any one say that this treaty\r\nhas been done secretly: and now in closing this council, I take off\r\nmy glove, and in giving you my hand I deliver over my birthright\r\nand lands: and in taking your hand I hold fast all the promises you\r\nhave made, and I hope they will last as long as the sun rises and\r\nthe water flows, as you have said.\"\r\n\r\nThe conference then adjourned, and on re-assembling, after the\r\ntreaty had been read and explained, the Commissioners signed it\r\nand the Lieutenant-Governor called on an aged hereditary Chief,\r\nKee-ta-kay-pi-nais, to sign next. The Chief came forward, but declined\r\nto touch the pen, saying, \"I must first have the money in my hand.\"\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor immediately held out his hand and directed the\r\ninterpreter to say to the chief, \"Take my hand and feel the money in\r\nit. If you cannot trust me for half an hour do not trust me forever.\"\r\nWhen this was repeated by the interpreter, the Chief smiled, took\r\nthe out-stretched hand, and at once touched the pen, while his mark\r\nwas being made, his last lingering distrust having been effectively\r\ndispelled by this prompt action and reply. The other Chiefs followed,\r\nand then the interpreter was directed to tell Kee-ta-kay-pi-nais,\r\nthe Chief, that he would be paid forthwith, but the Chief at once\r\nreplied, \"Oh no, it is evening now, and I will wait till to-morrow.\"\r\nThe payments were duly made next day, and so was closed, a treaty,\r\nwhereby a territory was enabled to be opened up, of great importance\r\nto Canada, embracing as it does the Pacific Railway route to the\r\nNorth-West Territories--a wide extent of fertile lands, and, as is\r\nbelieved, great mineral resources. I now quote the official despatch\r\nof the Lieutenant-Governor, dated the 14th October, 1873, in which\r\nwill be found, a full narrative of the proceedings, connected with the\r\ntreaty, and a statement of the results thereby effected. I also submit\r\na short-hand report of the negotiations connected with the treaty.\r\n\r\n                  GOVERNMENT HOUSE,\r\n                        FORT GARRY, October 14th, 1873.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to enclose copy of a treaty made by myself,\r\nLieut.-Col. Provencher, Indian agent and S. J. Dawson, Esq.,\r\nCommissioner, acting on behalf of Her Majesty, of the one part,\r\nand the Saulteaux tribe of Ojibbeway Indians on the other, at the\r\nNorth-West Angle of the Lake of the Woods, on the 3rd of October,\r\nfor the relinquishment of the Indian title to the tract of land\r\ntherein described and embracing 55,000 square miles. In the first\r\nplace, the holding of the negotiation of the treaty had been\r\nappointed by you to take place at the North-West Angle before you\r\nrequested me to take part therein, and Mr. Dawson had obtained the\r\nconsent of the Indians to meet there on the 10th of September, but\r\nthey afterwards changed their minds, and refused to meet me unless\r\nI came to Fort Francis. I refused to do this, as I felt that the\r\nyielding to the demand of the Indians in this respect, would\r\noperate injuriously to the success of the treaty, and the results\r\nproved the correctness of the opinion I had formed. I therefore\r\nsent a special agent (Mr. Pierre Levaillier) to warn them that I\r\nwould meet them as arranged at the North-West Angle on the 25th,\r\nor not at all this year, to which they eventually agreed.\r\n\r\nI left here for the Angle on the 23rd September and arrived there\r\non the 25th, when I was joined by Messrs. Provencher and Dawson the\r\nlast named of whom I was glad to find had been associated with the\r\nCommissioners in consequence of the resignation of Mr. Lindsey\r\nRussell, thereby giving us the benefit as well of his knowledge of\r\nthe country to be dealt with, as of the several bands of Indians\r\ntherein. Mr. Pether, of Fort Francis, was also in attendance, and\r\nMr. Provencher was accompanied by Mr. St. John, of his department.\r\n\r\nOn arriving, the Indians, who were already there, came up to the\r\nhouse I occupied, in procession, headed by braves bearing a banner\r\nand a Union Jack, and accompanied by others beating drums. They\r\nasked leave to perform a dance in my honor, after which they\r\npresented to me the pipe of peace. They were then supplied with\r\nprovisions and returned to their camp. As the Indians had not all\r\narrived, and for other reasons, the 26th, 27th and 28th were passed\r\nwithout any progress but on the 29th I sent them word that they\r\nmust meet the Commissioners next morning. Accordingly, on the 30th,\r\nthey met us in a tent, the use of which I had obtained from the\r\nmilitary authorities. I explained to them the object of the\r\nmeeting, but as they informed me that they were not ready to confer\r\nwith us, I adjourned the meeting until next day. On the 1st October\r\nthey again assembled. The principal cause of the delay was\r\ndivisions and jealousies among themselves. The nation had not met\r\nfor many years, and some of them had never before been assembled\r\ntogether. They were very jealous of each other, and dreaded any of\r\nthe Chiefs having individual communications with me, to prevent\r\nwhich they had guards on the approaches to my house and Mr.\r\nDawson's tent. On the 2nd October they again assembled, when I\r\nagain explained the object of the meeting, through Mr. McPherson,\r\nan intelligent half-breed trader, whose services I secured. M.\r\nChatelan, the Government interpreter, was also present. They had\r\nselected three spokesmen, and had also an Indian reporter, whose\r\nduty was to commit to memory all that was said. They had also\r\nsecured the services of M. Joseph Nolin, of Point du Chene, to\r\ntake notes in French of the negotiations, a copy of which notes I\r\nobtained from him and herewith enclose. The spokesmen informed me\r\nthey would not treat as to the land until we settled with them as\r\nto the Dawson route, with regard to which they alleged Mr. Dawson\r\nhad made promises which had not been kept, and that they had not\r\nbeen paid for the wood used in building the steamers, nor for the\r\nuse of the route itself. Mr. Dawson explained that he had paid them\r\nfor cutting wood, but had always asserted a common right to the use\r\nof wood and the water way. He asked them what promise had not been\r\nkept, and pointed out that the Government had twice before\r\nendeavored to treat with them for a settlement of all matters. He\r\nreferred them to me as to the general question of the use of the\r\nroute. They were unable to name any promises which had not been\r\nkept. Thereupon I told them I came on behalf of the Queen and the\r\nGovernment of the Dominion of Canada to treat with them with regard\r\nto the lands and all other matters, but that they refused to hear\r\nwhat I had to say; they had closed my mouth; and as we would not\r\ntreat except for the settlement of all matters past and future I\r\ncould not speak unless they asked me to do so. They conferred among\r\nthemselves, and seeing that we were quite firm, the spokesman came\r\nforward and said that they would not close my mouth, after which\r\nthey would make their demands. The Commissioners had had a\r\nconference and agreed, as they found there was no hope of a treaty\r\nfor a less sum, to offer five dollars per head, a present of ten\r\ndollars, and reserves of farming and other lands not exceeding one\r\nsquare mile per family of five, or in that proportion, sums within\r\nthe limits of our instructions, though I had private advices if\r\npossible not to give the maximum sum named, as the Government had\r\nbeen under a misapprehension as to amounts given to the bands in\r\nthe United States. The Chiefs heard my proposal, and the meeting\r\nadjourned until next day. On the 3rd October the Chiefs again\r\nassembled and made a counter proposition, of which I enclose a\r\ncopy, being the demand they have urged since 1869. I also enclose\r\nan estimate I had made of the money value of the demand, amounting\r\nto $125,000 per annum. On behalf of the Commissioners I at once\r\nperemptorily refused the demand. The spokesmen returned to the\r\nChiefs, who were arranged on benches, the people sitting on the\r\nground behind them, and on their return they informed me that the\r\nChiefs, warriors and braves were of one mind, that they would make\r\na treaty only if we acceded to their demand. I told them if so the\r\nconference was over, that I would return and report that they had\r\nrefused to make a reasonable treaty, that hereafter I would treat\r\nwith those bands who were willing to treat, but that I would advise\r\nthem to return to the council and reconsider their determination\r\nbefore next morning, when, if not, I should certainly leave. This\r\nbrought matters to a crisis. The Chief of the Lac Seul band came\r\nforward to speak. The others tried to prevent him, but he was\r\nsecured a hearing. He stated that he represented four hundred\r\npeople in the north, that they wished a treaty, that they wished a\r\nschool-master to be sent them to teach their children the knowledge\r\nof the white man; that they had begun to cultivate the soil and\r\nwere growing potatoes and Indian corn, but wished other grain for\r\nseed and some agricultural implements and cattle. This Chief spoke\r\nunder evident apprehension as to the course he was taking in\r\nresisting the other Indians, and displayed much good sense and\r\nmoral courage. He was followed by the Chief \"Blackstone,\" who\r\nurged the other Chiefs to return to the council and consider my\r\nproposals, stating that he was ready to treat, though he did not\r\nagree to my proposals nor to those made to me. I then told them\r\nthat I had known all along they were not united as they had said;\r\nthat they ought not to allow a few Chiefs to prevent a treaty, and\r\nthat I wished to treat with them as a nation and not with separate\r\nbands, as they would otherwise compel me to do, and therefore urged\r\nthem to return to their council, promising to remain another day to\r\ngive them time for consideration. They spent the night in council,\r\nand next morning having received a message from M. Charles Nolin, a\r\nFrench half-breed, that they were becoming more amenable to reason,\r\nI requested the Hon. James McKay (who went to the Angle three times\r\nto promote this treaty), Charles Nolin and Pierre Levaillier to go\r\ndown to the Indian Council, and as men of their own blood, give\r\nthem friendly advice. They accordingly did so, and were received\r\nby the Indians, and in about half an hour afterwards were followed\r\nby Messrs. Provencher and St. John, who also took part in the\r\ninterview with the Council of Chiefs. The Chiefs were summoned to\r\nthe conference by the sound of a bugle and again met us, when they\r\ntold me that the determination to adhere to their demands had been\r\nso strong a bond that they did not think it could be broken, but\r\nthey had now determined to see if I would give them anything more.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners had had a conference, and agreed previously to\r\noffer a small sum for ammunition and twine for nets, yearly--a few\r\nagricultural implements and seeds, for any band actually farming\r\nor commencing to farm, and to increase the money payment by two\r\ndollars per head if it should be found necessary in order to secure\r\na treaty, maintaining a permanent annuities at the sum fixed. The\r\nIndians on the other hand had determined on asking fifteen dollars,\r\nwith some other demands. In fixing the ten dollars the Commissioners\r\nhad done so as a sum likely to be accepted in view of three dollars\r\nper head having been paid the Indians the first year the Dawson route\r\nwas used, and that they had received nothing since. In reply to the\r\nIndians, I told them I was glad that they had reconsidered their\r\ndecision, and that as they had done so, being desirous of inducing\r\nthem to practice agriculture and to have the means of getting food\r\nif their fishing and hunting failed, we would give them certain\r\nimplements, cattle and grain, once for all, and the extra two dollars\r\nper head of a money payment. This proposal was received favorably, but\r\nthe spokesmen again came forward and said they had some questions to\r\nask before accepting my proposal. They wanted suits of clothing every\r\nyear for all the bands, and fifty dollars for every Chief annually.\r\nThis I declined, but told them that there were some presents of\r\nclothing and food which would be given them this year at the close of\r\ntreaty. They then asked free passes forever over the Canada Pacific\r\nRailway, which I refused. They then asked that no \"fire-water\" should\r\nbe sold on their reserves, and I promised that a regulation to this\r\neffect should be introduced into the treaty. They then asked that they\r\nshould not be sent to war, and I told them the Queen was not in the\r\nhabit of employing the Indians in warfare. They asked that they should\r\nhave power to put turbulent men off their reserves, and I told them\r\nthe law would be enforced against such men. They asked what reserves\r\nwould be given them, and were informed by Mr. Provencher that reserves\r\nof farming and other lands would be given them as previously stated,\r\nand that any land actually in cultivation by them would be respected.\r\nThey asked if the mines would be theirs; I said if they were found on\r\ntheir reserves it would be to their benefit, but not otherwise. They\r\nasked if an Indian found a mine would he be paid for it, I told them\r\nhe could sell his information if he could find a purchaser like any\r\nother person. They explained that some of their children had married\r\nin the States, and they wished them to return and live among them, and\r\nwanted them included in the treaty. I told them the treaty was not for\r\nAmerican Indians, but any bona fide British Indians of the class they\r\nmentioned who should within two years be found resident on British\r\nsoil would be recognized.\r\n\r\nThey said there were some ten to twenty families of half-breeds who\r\nwere recognized as Indians and lived with them, and they wished\r\nthem included. I said the treaty was not for whites, but I would\r\nrecommend that those families should be permitted the option of\r\ntaking either status as Indians or whites, but that they could not\r\ntake both. They asked that Mr. Charles Nolin should be employed as\r\nan Indian Agent, and I stated that I would submit his name to the\r\nGovernment with favorable mention of his services on that occasion.\r\nThey asked that the Chiefs and head men, as in other treaties,\r\nshould get an official suit of clothing, a nag, and a medal, which\r\nI promised. Mawedopenais produced one of the medals given to the\r\nRed River Chiefs, said it was not silver, and they were ashamed\r\nto wear it, as it turned black, and then, with an air of great\r\ncontempt, struck it with his knife. I stated that I would mention\r\nwhat he had said, and the manner in which he had spoken. They\r\nalso stated the Hudson Bay Company had staked out ground at Fort\r\nFrancis, on part of the land they claimed to have used, and to be\r\nentitled to, and I promised that enquiry would be made into the\r\nmatter. They apologized for the number of questions put me, which\r\noccupied a space of some hours, and then the principal spokesman,\r\nMawedopenais, came forward and drew off his gloves, and spoke as\r\nfollows: \"Now you see me stand before you all. What has been done\r\nhere to-day, has been done openly before the Great Spirit, and\r\nbefore the nation, and I hope that I may never hear any one say\r\nthat this treaty has been done secretly. And now in closing this\r\ncouncil, I take off my glove, and in taking your hand, I deliver\r\nover my birthright, and lands, and in taking your hand I hold fast\r\nall the promises you have made, and I hope they will last as long\r\nas the sun goes round, and the water flows, as you have said.\" To\r\nwhich I replied as follows: \"I accept your hand, and with it the\r\nlands and will keep all my promises, in the firm belief that the\r\ntreaty now to be signed will bind the red man and the white man\r\ntogether as friends forever.\" The conference then adjourned for an\r\nhour to enable the text of the treaty to be completed in accordance\r\nwith the understanding arrived at. At the expiration of that period\r\nthe conference was resumed, and after the reading of the treaty,\r\nand an explanation of it in Indian by the Hon. James McKay it was\r\nsigned by the Commissioners and by the several Chiefs, the first\r\nsignature being that of a very aged hereditary Chief. The next\r\nday the Indians were paid by Messrs. Pether and Graham, of the\r\nDepartment of Public Works; the latter of whom kindly offered\r\nhis services as Mr. Provencher had to leave to keep another\r\nappointment. The negotiation was a very difficult and trying one,\r\nand required on the part of the Commissioners great patience and\r\nfirmness. On the whole I am of opinion that the issue is a happy\r\none. With the exception of two bands in the Shebandowan District,\r\nwhose adhesion was secured in advance and the signatures of whose\r\nChiefs Mr. Dawson left to secure, the Indian title has been\r\nextinguished over the vast tract of country comprising 55,000\r\nsquare miles lying between the upper boundary of the Lake Superior\r\ntreaty, and that of the treaty made by Mr. Commissioner Simpson at\r\nManitoba Post, and embracing within its bounds the Dawson route,\r\nthe route of the Canada Pacific Railway and an extensive lumber and\r\nmineral region. [Footnote: Mr. Dawson succeeded in obtaining the\r\nadhesion to the treaty of the Chiefs in question.] It is fortunate,\r\ntoo that the arrangement has been effected, as the Indians\r\nalong the lakes and rivers were dissatisfied at the use of the\r\nwaters, which they considered theirs, having been taken without\r\ncompensation, so much so indeed that I believe if the treaty had\r\nnot been made, the Government would have been compelled to place a\r\nforce on the line next year.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this despatch, I have much pleasure in bearing\r\ntestimony to the hearty co-operation and efficient aid the\r\nCommissioners received from the Metis who were present at the\r\nAngle, and who, with one accord, whether of French or English\r\norigin, used the influence which their relationships to the Indians\r\ngave them to impress them with the necessity of their entering into\r\nthe treaty. I must also express my obligations to the detachment of\r\ntroops under the command of Captain Macdonald, assigned me as an\r\nescort, for their soldierly bearing and excellent conduct while at\r\nthe Angle. Their presence was of great value, and had the effect of\r\ndeterring traders from bringing articles of illicit trade for sale\r\nto the Indians; and moreover exercised a moral influence which\r\ncontributed most materially to the success of the negotiations. I\r\nhave further to add, that it was found impossible, owing to the\r\nextent of the country treated for, and the want of knowledge of the\r\ncircumstances of each band, to define the reserves to be granted to\r\nthe Indians. It was therefore agreed that the reserves should be\r\nhereafter selected by officers of the Government, who should confer\r\nwith the several bands, and pay due respect to lands actually\r\ncultivated by them. A provision was also introduced to the effect\r\nthat any of the reserves, or any interest in them, might hereafter\r\nbe sold for the benefit of the Indians by the Government with their\r\nconsent. I would suggest that instructions should be given to Mr.\r\nDawson to select the reserves with all convenient speed; and, to\r\nprevent complication I would further suggest that no patents should\r\nbe issued, or licenses granted, for mineral or timber lands, or\r\nother lands, until the question of the reserves has been first\r\nadjusted.\r\n\r\n                 I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                            Your obedient servant,\r\n                                      ALEXANDER MORRIS.\r\n                                               Lieut.-Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttention is called to the ensuing report of the proceedings\r\nconnected with the treaty, extracted from the Manitoban newspaper\r\nof the 18th October, 1873, published at Winnipeg. The reports of\r\nthe speeches therein contained were prepared by a short-hand\r\nreporter and present an accurate view of the course of the\r\ndiscussions, and a vivid representation of the habits of Indian\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n                                     NORTH-WEST ANGLE,\r\n                                             September 30, 1873.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor and party, and the other Commissioners\r\nappointed to negotiate a treaty with the Indians, arrived here on\r\nThursday, 24th inst., having enjoyed delightful weather during the\r\nentire trip from Fort Garry. The Governor occupies the house of the\r\nofficer in charge of the H. B. Post. The grounds around it have\r\nbeen nicely graded and cleared of brush, and surrounded by rows of\r\nevergreens planted closely, so as to completely screen the house\r\nfrom wind, and at the same time contribute much to relieve the\r\nmonotony of the scenery. Immediately west of this, and likewise\r\nenclosed by walls of evergreens, is the large marquee used as\r\na Council House, by the contracting parties; and immediately\r\nsurrounding it to the north and west are the tents of the other\r\nofficers of the Commission and the officers and men of the\r\nVolunteers on detachment duty.\r\n\r\nSituated to the eastward, and extending all along the river bank,\r\nare the tents of the Indians to the number of a hundred, with here\r\nand there the tent of the trader, attracted thither by the prospect\r\nof turning an honest penny by exchanging the necessaries of Indian\r\nlife for such amounts of the price of their heritage as they can be\r\ninduced to spend.\r\n\r\nThe natives now assembled here number about 800 all told, and hail\r\nfrom the places given below. Among them are many fine physically\r\ndeveloped men, who would be considered good looking were it not for\r\nthe extravagance with which they be-smear their faces with pigments\r\nof all colors.\r\n\r\nIt was at first thought probable that the serious business of the\r\nmeeting would be begun on Friday, but owing to the non-arrival of\r\na large body of Rainy River and Lac Seul representatives, it was\r\ndecided to defer it until next day. Saturday came, and owing to the\r\narrival of a messenger from the Lac Seul band asking the Governor\r\nto wait for their arrival, proceedings have further stayed until\r\nMonday. But \"hope deferred maketh the heart sick;\" so the advent of\r\nMonday brought nothing but disappointment, and this, coupled with\r\nthe disagreeable wet and cold weather that prevailed, made every\r\none ill at ease if not miserable. The Chiefs were not ready to\r\ntreat--they had business of their own to transact, which must be\r\ndisposed of before they could see the Governor; and so another\r\ndelay was granted. But Monday did not find them ready, and they\r\nrefused to begin negotiations. An intimation from the Governor that\r\nunless they were ready on the following day he would leave for\r\nhome on Wednesday, hurried them up a little--they did wait on him\r\nto-day, Tuesday, but only to say they had not yet finished their\r\nown business, but that they would try and be ready to treat on\r\nWednesday. And so the matter stands at present--if the Indians\r\nagree amongst themselves, the treaty will be opened to-morrow,\r\notherwise the Governor will strike camp and return to Fort Garry.\r\n\r\nDivisions and local jealousies have taken possession of the Indian\r\nmind. The difficulties are the inability of the Indians to select\r\na high or principal chief from amongst themselves, and as to the\r\nmatter and extent of the demands to be made.\r\n\r\nIt is many years since these people had a general council, and in\r\nthe interval many head men have died, while others have grown to\r\nman's estate, and feel ambitious to take part in the proceedings.\r\nBut the fiat has gone forth, that unless a conclusion is arrived at\r\nto-morrow negotiations will be broken off for this year.\r\n\r\nBOUNDARIES OF THE LANDS TO BE CEDED\r\n\r\nBeginning at the North-West Angle eastward, taking in all the Lake\r\nof the Woods, including White Fish Bay, Rat Portage and north to\r\nWhite Dog in English River; up English River to Lake Seul, and then\r\nsouth east to Lake Nepigon; westward to Rainy River and down it\r\nto Lake of the Woods, and up nearly to Lac des Mille Lacs; then\r\nbeginning at the 49th parallel to White Mouth River, thence down it\r\nto the north, along the eastern boundary of the land ceded in 1871,\r\nembracing 55,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of Lac des mille Lacs and Shebandowan are\r\nseveral bands, who have sent word that they cannot come as far as\r\nthis point, but will accept the terms made at this treaty and\r\nratify it with any one commissioner who will go there to meet them.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of Indians in the territory is estimated at\r\n14,000, and are represented here by Chiefs of the following bands:\r\n\r\n   1. North-West Angle.\r\n   2. Rat Portage.\r\n   3. Lake Seul.\r\n   4. White Fish Bay on Lake of the Woods.\r\n   5. Sha-bas-kang, or Grassy Narrows.\r\n   6. Rainy River.\r\n   7. Rainy Lake.\r\n   8. Beyond Kettle Falls, southward.\r\n   9. Eagle Lake.\r\n  10. Nepigon.\r\n  11. Shoal Lake (three miles to the north of this point).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NORTH-WEST ANGLE,\r\n                                   October 1, 1873.\r\n\r\nThe assembled Chiefs met the Governor this morning, as per\r\nagreement, and opened the proceedings of the day by expressing the\r\npleasure they experienced at meeting the Commissioners on the\r\npresent occasion. Promises had many times been made to them, and,\r\nsaid the speaker, unless they were now fulfilled they would not\r\nconsider the broader question of the treaty.\r\n\r\nMr. S. J. Dawson, one of the Commissioners, reciprocated the\r\nexpression of pleasure used by the Chiefs through their spokesman.\r\nHe had long looked forward to this meeting, when all matters\r\nrelating to the past, the present, and the future, could be\r\ndisposed of so as to fix permanently the friendly relations between\r\nthe Indians and the white men. It was now, he continued, some years\r\nsince the white men first came to this country--they came in the\r\nfirst place at the head of a great military expedition; and when\r\nthat expedition was passing through the country all the chiefs\r\nshowed themselves to be true and loyal subjects--they showed\r\nthemselves able and willing to support their Great Mother the\r\nQueen. Subsequently, when we began to open up the road, we had to\r\ncall upon the Indians to assist us in doing so, and they always\r\nproved themselves very happy to help in carrying out our great\r\nschemes. He was, he continued, one of the Commission employed by\r\nthe Government to treat with them and devise a scheme whereby both\r\nwhite men and Indians would be benefitted. We made to the Indians\r\nthe proposals we were authorized to make, and we have carried out\r\nthese proposals in good faith. This was three years ago. What we\r\nwere directed to offer we did offer, but the Indians thought it\r\nwas too little, and negotiations were broken off. Since this I\r\nhave done what was in my power to bring about this meeting with\r\nnew terms, and consider it a very happy day that you should be\r\nassembled to meet the Governor of the Territory as representative\r\nof Her Majesty. He would explain to them the proposals he had to\r\nmake. He had lived long amongst them and would advise them as a\r\nfriend to take the opportunity of making arrangements with the\r\nGovernor. When we arrange the general matters in question, should\r\nyou choose to ask anything, I shall be most happy to explain it,\r\nas I am here all the time.\r\n\r\nThe Chief in reply said his head men and young men were of one\r\nmind, and determined not to enter upon the treaty until the\r\npromises made in the past were fulfilled, they were tired of\r\nwaiting. What the Commissioners called \"small matters\" were great\r\nto them, and were what they wished to have settled.\r\n\r\nThe route that had been built through the country proved this,\r\nand the Commissioners promised something which they now wanted.\r\n\r\nThis was taking the Commissioners on a new tack, but Mr. Dawson\r\npromptly undertook to answer the objections. He said all these\r\nquestions had been discussed before; but if he had made any\r\npromises that remained unfulfilled, he would be happy to learn\r\ntheir nature. The Chief replied that all the houses on the line,\r\nand all the big boats on the waters, were theirs, and they wanted\r\nto be recompensed for them.\r\n\r\nMr. Dawson continued, saying he was glad they had now come to a\r\npoint on which they could deal. The Indians questioned the right\r\nof the Government to take wood for the steamers. This was a right\r\nwhich the speaker had all along told them was common to all Her\r\nMajesty's subjects. He then referred them to the Governor if they\r\nhad anything more to say on that subject. Wood on which Indians had\r\nbestowed labor was always paid for; but wood on which we had spent\r\nour own labor was ours.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency then addressed them at some length. He understood\r\nthat they wanted to have the questions in which they were\r\ninterested treated separately. This was not what he came there for.\r\nWood and water were the gift of the Great Spirit, and were made\r\nalike for the good of both the white man and red man. Many of his\r\nlisteners had come a long way, and he, too, had come a long way,\r\nand he wanted all the questions settled at once, by one treaty. He\r\nhad a message from the Queen, but if his mouth was kept shut, the\r\nresponsibility would rest on the Indians, and not with him if he\r\nwere prevented from delivering it. He had authority to tell them\r\nwhat sum of money he could give them in hand now, and what he could\r\ngive them every year; but it was for them to open his mouth. He\r\nconcluded his remarks, which were forcibly delivered, with an\r\nemphatic \"I have said.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief reiterated that he and his young men were determined not\r\nto go on with the treaty until the first question was disposed of.\r\nWhat was said about the trees and rivers was quite true, but it\r\nwas the Indian's country, not the white man's. Following this the\r\nGovernor told the Council that unless they would settle all the\r\nmatters, the big and little, at once, he would not talk. He was\r\nbound by his Government, and was of the same mind to treat with\r\nthem on all questions, and not on any one separately.\r\n\r\nOn seeing His Excellency so firm, and feeling that it would not do\r\nto allow any more time to pass without coming to business the Chief\r\nasked the Governor to open his mouth and tell what propositions he\r\nwas prepared to make.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency then said--\"I told you I was to make the treaty on\r\nthe part of our Great Mother the Queen, and I feel it will be for\r\nyour good and your children's. I should have been very sorry if\r\nyou had shut my mouth, if I had had to go home without opening my\r\nmouth. I should not have been a true friend of yours if I had not\r\nasked you to open my mouth. We are all children of the same Great\r\nSpirit, and are subject to the same Queen. I want to settle all\r\nmatters both of the past and the present, so that the white and red\r\nman will always be friends. I will give you lands for farms, and\r\nalso reserves for your own use. I have authority to make reserves\r\nsuch as I have described, not exceeding in all a square mile for\r\nevery family of five or thereabouts. It may be a long time before\r\nthe other lands are wanted, and in the meantime you will be\r\npermitted to fish and hunt over them. I will also establish schools\r\nwhenever any band asks for them, so that your children may have the\r\nlearning of the white man. I will also give you a sum of money for\r\nyourselves and every one of your wives and children for this year.\r\nI will give you ten dollars per head of the population and for\r\nevery other year five dollars a head. But to the chief men, not\r\nexceeding two to each band, we will give twenty dollars a-year for\r\never. I will give to each of you this year a present of goods and\r\nprovisions to take you home, and I am sure you will be satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nAfter consultation amongst themselves, the Councillors went to\r\nhave a talk about the matter and will meet the Governor to-morrow\r\nmorning, when it is expected the bargain will be concluded. Of\r\ncourse the Indians will make some other demands.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the adjournment as above, the Governor presented\r\nan ox to the people in camp; and the way it disappeared would have\r\nastonished the natives of any other land. Half-an-hour after it was\r\nled into encampment, it was cut up and boiling in fifty pots.\r\n\r\nTHIRD DAY\r\n\r\nProceedings were opened at eleven o'clock by the Governor\r\nannouncing that he was ready to hear what the Chiefs had to say.\r\nThe Fort Francis Chief acted as spokesman, assisted by another\r\nChief, Powhassan.\r\n\r\nMA-WE-DO-PE-NAIS--\"I now lay down before you the opinions of those\r\nyou have seen before. We think it a great thing to meet you here.\r\nWhat we have heard yesterday, and as you represented yourself,\r\nyou said the Queen sent you here, the way we understood you as a\r\nrepresentative of the Queen. All this is our property where you\r\nhave come. We have understood you yesterday that Her Majesty has\r\ngiven you the same power and authority as she has, to act in\r\nthis business; you said the Queen gave you her goodness, her\r\ncharitableness in your hands. This is what we think, that the Great\r\nSpirit has planted us on this ground where we are, as you were\r\nwhere you came from. We think where we are is our property. I will\r\ntell you what he said to us when he planted us here; the rules that\r\nwe should follow--us Indians--He has given us rules that we should\r\nfollow to govern us rightly. We have understood you that you have\r\nopened your charitable heart to us like a person taking off his\r\ngarments and throwing them to all of us here. Now, first of all, I\r\nhave a few words to address to this gentleman (Mr. Dawson). When he\r\nunderstood rightly what was my meaning yesterday, he threw himself\r\non your help. I think I have a right to follow him to where he flew\r\nwhen I spoke to him on the subject yesterday. We will follow up\r\nthe subject from the point we took it up. I want to answer what\r\nwe heard from you yesterday, in regard to the money that you have\r\npromised us yesterday to each individual. I want to talk about the\r\nrules that we had laid down before. It is four years back since we\r\nhave made these rules. The rules laid down are the rules that they\r\nwish to follow--a council that has been agreed upon by all the\r\nIndians. I do not wish that I should be required to say twice what\r\nI am now going to lay down. We ask fifteen dollars for all that you\r\nsee, and for the children that are to be born in future. This year\r\nonly we ask for fifteen dollars; years after ten dollars; our\r\nChiefs fifty dollars per year for every year, and other demands of\r\nlarge amounts in writing, say $125,000 yearly.\"\r\n\r\nANOTHER CHIEF--\"I take my standing point from here. Our councillors\r\nhave in council come to this conclusion, that they should have\r\ntwenty dollars each; our warriors, fifteen dollars; our population,\r\nfifteen dollars. We have now laid down the conclusion of our\r\ncouncils by our decisions. We tell you our wishes are not divided.\r\nWe are all of one mind.\" (Paper put in before the Governor for\r\nthese demands.)\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"I now let you know the opinions of us here. We would not\r\nwish that anyone should smile at our affairs, as we think our\r\ncountry is a large matter to us. If you grant us what is written on\r\nthat paper, then we will talk about the reserves; we have decided\r\nin council for the benefit of those that will be born hereafter.\r\nIf you do so the treaty will be finished, I believe.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I quite agree that this is no matter to smile at. I\r\nthink that the decision of to-day is one that affects yourselves\r\nand your children after, but you must recollect that this is the\r\nthird time of negotiating. If we do not shake hands and make our\r\nTreaty to-day, I do not know when it will be done, as the Queen's\r\nGovernment will think you do not wish to treat with her. You told\r\nme that you understood that I represented the Queen's Government to\r\nyou and that I opened my heart to you, but you must recollect that\r\nif you are a council there is another great council that governs a\r\ngreat Dominion, and they hold their councils the same as you hold\r\nyours. I wish to tell you that I am a servant of the Queen. I\r\ncannot do my own will; I must do hers. I can only give you what she\r\ntells me to give you. I am sorry to see that your hands were very\r\nwide open when you gave me this paper. I thought what I promised\r\nyou was just, kind and fair between the Queen and you. It is now\r\nthree years we have been trying to settle this matter. If we do not\r\nsucceed to-day I shall go away feeling sorry for you and for your\r\nchildren that you could not see what was good for you and for them.\r\nI am ready to do what I promised you yesterday. My hand is open and\r\nyou ought to take me by the hand and say, \"yes, we accept of your\r\noffer.\" I have not the power to do what you ask of me. I ask you\r\nonce more to think what you are doing, and of those you have left\r\nat home, and also of those that may be born yet, and I ask you not\r\nto turn your backs on what is offered to you, and you ought to see\r\nby what the Queen is offering you that she loves her red subjects\r\nas much as her white. I think you are forgetting one thing, that\r\nwhat I offer you is to be while the water flows and the sun rises.\r\nYou know that in the United States they only pay the Indian for\r\ntwenty years, and you come here to-day and ask for ever more than\r\nthey get for twenty years. Is that just? I think you ought to\r\naccept my offer, and make a treaty with me as I ask you to do. I\r\nonly ask you to think for yourselves, and for your families, and\r\nfor your children and children's children, and I know that if you\r\ndo that you will shake hands with me to-day.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"I lay before you our opinions. Our hands are poor but our\r\nheads are rich, and it is riches that we ask so that we may be able\r\nto support our families as long as the sun rises and the water\r\nruns.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I am very sorry; you know it takes two to make a\r\nbargain; you are agreed on the one side, and I for the Queen's\r\nGovernment on the other. I have to go away and report that I have\r\nto go without making terms with you. I doubt if the Commissioners\r\nwill be sent again to assemble this nation. I have only one word\r\nmore to say; I speak to the Chief and to the head men to recollect\r\nthose behind them, and those they have left at home, and not to go\r\naway without accepting such liberal terms and without some clothing.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"My terms I am going to lay down before you; the decision of\r\nour Chiefs; ever since we came to a decision you push it back. The\r\nsound of the rustling of the gold is under my feet where I stand;\r\nwe have a rich country; it is the Great Spirit who gave us this;\r\nwhere we stand upon is the Indians' property, and belongs to them.\r\nIf you grant us our requests you will not go back without making\r\nthe treaty.\"\r\n\r\nANOTHER CHIEF--\"We understood yesterday that the Queen had given\r\nyou the power to act upon, that you could do what you pleased, and\r\nthat the riches of the Queen she had filled your head and body\r\nwith, and you had only to throw them round about; but it seems it\r\nis not so, but that you have only half the power that she has, and\r\nthat she has only half filled your head.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I do not like to be misunderstood. I did not say\r\nyesterday that the Queen had given me all the power; what I told\r\nyou was that I was sent here to represent the Queen's Government,\r\nand to tell you what the Queen was willing to do for you. You can\r\nunderstand very well; for instance, one of your great chiefs asks\r\na brave to deliver a message, he represents you, and that is how I\r\nstand with the Queen's Government.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"It is your charitableness that you spoke of yesterday--Her\r\nMajesty's charitableness that was given you. It is our chiefs, our\r\nyoung men, our children and great grand-children, and those that\r\nare to be born, that I represent here, and it is for them I ask for\r\nterms. The white man has robbed us of our riches, and we don't wish\r\nto give them up again without getting something in their place.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"For your children, grand-children, and children unborn,\r\nI am sorry that you will not accept of my terms. I shall go home\r\nsorry, but it is your own doing; I must simply go back and report\r\nthe fact that you refuse to make a treaty with me.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"You see all our chiefs before you here as one mind; we have\r\none mind and one mouth. It is the decision of all of us; if you\r\ngrant us our demands you will not go back sorrowful; we would not\r\nrefuse to make a treaty if you would grant us our demands.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I have told you already that I cannot grant your\r\ndemands, I have not the power to do so. I have made you a liberal\r\noffer, and it is for you to accept or refuse it as you please.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"Our chiefs have the same opinion; they will not change\r\ntheir decision.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"Then the Council is at an end.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF (of Lac Seule)--\"I understand the matter that he asks; if he\r\nputs a question to me as well as to others, I say so as well as the\r\nrest. We are the first that were planted here; we would ask you to\r\nassist us with every kind of implement to use for our benefit, to\r\nenable us to perform our work; a little of everything and money. We\r\nwould borrow your cattle; we ask you this for our support; I will\r\nfind whereon to feed them. The waters out of which you sometimes\r\ntake food for yourselves, we will lend you in return. If I should\r\ntry to stop you--it is not in my power to do so; even the Hudson's\r\nBay Company--that is a small power--I cannot gain my point with it.\r\nIf you give what I ask, the time may come when I will ask you to\r\nlend me one of your daughters and one of your sons to live with us;\r\nand in return I will lend you one of my daughters and one of my\r\nsons for you to teach what is good, and after they have learned, to\r\nteach us. If you grant us what I ask, although I do not know you, I\r\nwill shake hands with you. This is all I have to say.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I have heard and I have learned something. I have\r\nlearned that you are not all of one mind. I know that your\r\ninterests are not the same--that some of you live in the north far\r\naway from the river, and some live on the river, and that you have\r\ngot large sums of money for wood that you have cut and sold to the\r\nsteamboats; but the men in the north have not this advantage. What\r\nthe Chief has said is reasonable; and should you want goods I mean\r\nto ask you what amount you would have in goods, so that you would\r\nnot have to pay the traders' prices for them. I wish you were all\r\nof the same mind as the Chief who has just spoken. He wants his\r\nchildren to be taught. He is right. He wants to get cattle to help\r\nhim to raise grain for his children. It would be a good thing for\r\nyou all to be of his mind, and then you would not go away without\r\nmaking this treaty with me.\"\r\n\r\nBLACKSTONE (Shebandowan)--\"I am going to lay down before you the\r\nminds of those who are here. I do not wish to interfere with the\r\ndecisions of those who are before you, or yet with your decisions.\r\nThe people at the height of land where the waters came down from\r\nShebandowan to Fort Frances, are those who have appointed me to lay\r\nbefore you our decision. We are going back to hold a Council.\"\r\n\r\nMR. DAWSON--\"I would ask the Chief who has just spoken, did the\r\nband at Shebandowan--did Rat McKay, authorize him to speak for\r\nthem? Ke-ha-ke-ge-nen is Blackstone's own Chief; and I am perfectly\r\nwilling to think that he authorized him. What I have to say is that\r\nthe Indians may not be deceived by representations made to them,\r\nand that the two bands met me at Shebandowan and said they were\r\nperfectly willing to enter into a treaty.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I think the nation will do well to do what the Chief has\r\nsaid. I think he has spoken sincerely, and it is right for them to\r\nwithdraw and hold a Council among themselves.\"\r\n\r\nBlackstone here handed in a paper which he alleged gave him authority\r\nas Chief, but which proved to be an official acknowledgement of the\r\nreceipt of a letter by the Indian Department at Ottawa.\r\n\r\nThe Governor here agreed with the Council that it would be well for\r\nthe Chiefs to have another meeting amongst themselves. It was a\r\nmost important day for them and for their children, and His\r\nExcellency would be glad to meet them again.\r\n\r\nThe Council broke up at this point, and it was extremely doubtful\r\nwhether an agreement could be come to or not. The Rainy River\r\nIndians were careless about the treaty, because they could get\r\nplenty of money for cutting wood for the boats, but the northern\r\nand eastern bands were anxious for one. The Governor decided that\r\nhe would make a treaty with those bands that were willing to accept\r\nhis terms, leaving out the few disaffected ones. A Council was held\r\nby the Indians in the evening, at which Hon. James McKay, Pierre\r\nLeveillee, Charles Nolin, and Mr. Genton were present by invitation\r\nof the Chiefs. After a very lengthy and exhaustive discussion, it\r\nwas decided to accept the Governor's terms, and the final meeting\r\nwas announced for Friday morning. Punctually at the appointed time\r\nproceedings were opened by the Fort Francis Chiefs announcing to\r\nHis Excellency that they were all of one mind, and would accept his\r\nterms, with a few modifications. The discussion of these terms\r\noccupied five hours, and met every possible contingency so fully\r\nthat it would be impossible to do justice to the negotiators\r\notherwise than by giving a full report of the speeches on both\r\nsides; but want of space compels us to lay it over until next week.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was finally closed on Friday afternoon, and signed on\r\nSaturday, after which a large quantity of provisions, ammunition\r\nand other goods were distributed.\r\n\r\nWhen the council broke up last (Thursday) night, 3rd October, it\r\nlooked very improbable that an understanding could be arrived at,\r\nbut the firmness of the Governor, and the prospect that he would\r\nmake a treaty with such of the bands as were willing to accept\r\nhis terms, to the exclusion of the others, led them to reconsider\r\ntheir demands. The Hon. James McKay, and Messrs. Nolin, Genton,\r\nand Leveillee were invited in to their council, and after a most\r\nexhaustive discussion of the circumstance in which they were\r\nplaced, it was resolved to accept the Governor's terms, with some\r\nmodifications. Word was sent to this effect, and at eleven o'clock\r\non Friday, conference was again held with His Excellency.\r\n\r\nThe Fort Francis Chief opened negotiations by saying:--\"We present\r\nour compliments to you, and now we would tell you something. You\r\nhave mentioned our councillors, warriors and messengers--every\r\nChief you see has his councillors, warriors and messengers.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I was not aware what names they gave me--they gave\r\ntheir chief men. I spoke of the subordinates of the head Chiefs;\r\nI believe the head Chiefs have three subordinates--I mean the\r\nhead Chief and three of his head men.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"I am going to tell you the decision of all before you. I\r\nwant to see your power and learn the most liberal terms that you\r\ncan give us.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I am glad to meet the Chiefs, and I hope it will be the\r\nlast time of our meeting. I hope we are going to understand one\r\nanother to-day. And that I can go back and report that I left my\r\nIndian friends contented, and that I have put into their hands the\r\nmeans of providing for themselves and their families at home; and\r\nnow I will give you my last words. When I held out my hands to you\r\nat first, I intended to do what was just and right, and what I had\r\nthe power to do at once,--not to go backwards and forwards, but at\r\nonce to do what I believe is just and right to you. I was very much\r\npleased yesterday with the words of the Chief of Lac Seul. I was\r\nglad to hear that he had commenced to farm and to raise things for\r\nhimself and family, and I was glad to hear him ask me to hold out\r\nmy hand. I think we should do everything to help you by giving\r\nyou the means to grow some food, so that if it is a bad year for\r\nfishing and hunting you may have something for your children at\r\nhome. If you had not asked it the Government would have done it all\r\nthe same, although I had not said so before. I can say this, that\r\nwhen a band settles down and actually commences to farm on their\r\nlands, the Government will agree to give two hoes, one spade, one\r\nscythe, and one axe for every family actually settled; one plough\r\nfor every ten families, five harrows for every twenty families, and\r\na yoke of oxen, a bull and four cows for every band; and enough\r\nbarley, wheat and oats to plant the land they have actually broken\r\nup. This is to enable them to cultivate their land, and it is to be\r\ngiven them on their commencing to do so, once for all. There is one\r\nthing that I have thought over, and I think it is a wise thing to\r\ndo. That is to give you ammunition, and twine for making nets, to\r\nthe extent of $1,500 per year, for the whole nation, so that you\r\ncan have the means of procuring food.--Now, I will mention the last\r\nthing that I can do. I think that the sum I have offered you to be\r\npaid after this year for every man, woman and child now, and for\r\nyears to come, is right and is the proper sum I will not make an\r\nchange in that, but we are anxious to show you that we have a great\r\ndesire to understand you--that we wish to do the utmost in our\r\npower to make you contented, so that the white and the red man will\r\nalways be friends. This year, instead of ten dollars we will give\r\nyou twelve dollars, to be paid you at once as soon as we sign the\r\ntreaty. This is the best I can do for you I wish you to understand\r\nwe do not come here as traders but as representing the Crown, and\r\nto do what we believe is just and right. We have asked in that\r\nspirit, and I hope you will meet me in that spirit and shake hands\r\nwith me day and make a treaty for ever. I have no more to say.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"I wish to ask some points that I have not properly\r\nunderstood. We understand that our children are to have two dollars\r\nextra. Will the two dollars be paid to our principal men as well?\r\nAnd these things that are promised will they commence at once and\r\nwill we see it year after year?\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I thought I had spoken fully as to everything, but I\r\nwill speak again. The ammunition and twine will be got at once for\r\nyou, this year, and that will be for every year. The Commissioner\r\nwill see that you get this at once; with regard to the things to\r\nhelp you to farm, you must recollect, in a very few days the river\r\nwill be frozen up here and we have not got these things here now.\r\nBut arrangements will be made next year to get these things for those\r\nwho are farming, it cannot be done before as you can see yourselves\r\nvery well. Some are farming, and I hope you will all do so.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"One thing I did not say that is most necessary--we want a\r\ncross-cut saw, a whip saw, grindstone and files.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"We will do that, and I think we ought to give a box of\r\ncommon tools to each Chief of a Band.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"Depending upon the words you have told us, and stretched\r\nout your hands in a friendly way, I depend upon that. One thing\r\nmore we demand--a suit of clothes to all of us.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"With regard to clothing, suits will be given to the\r\nChiefs and head men, and as to the other Indians there is a\r\nquantity of goods and provisions here that will be given them at\r\nthe close of the treaty. The coats of the Chiefs will be given\r\nevery three years.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"Once more; powder and shot will not go off without guns. We\r\nask for guns.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I have shewn every disposition to meet your view, but\r\nwhat I have promised is as far as I can go.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"My friends, listen to what I am going to say, and you,\r\nmy brothers. We present you now with our best and our strongest\r\ncompliments. We ask you not to reject some of our children who have\r\ngone out of our place; they are scattered all over, a good tasted\r\nmeat hath drawn them away, and we wish to draw them all here and be\r\ncontented with us.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"If your children come and live here, of course they will\r\nbecome part of the population, and be as yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"I hope you will grant the request that I am going to lay\r\nbefore you. I do not mean those that get paid on the other side of\r\nthe line, but some poor Indians who may happen to fall in our road.\r\nIf you will accept of these little matters, the treaty will be at\r\nan end. I would not like that one of my children should not eat\r\nwith me, and receive the food that you are going to give me.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I am dealing with British Indians and not American\r\nIndians, after the treaty is closed we will have a list of the\r\nnames of any children of British Indians that may come in during\r\ntwo years and be ranked with them; but we must have a limit\r\nsomewhere.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"I should not feel happy if I was not to mess with some of\r\nmy children that are around me--those children that we call the\r\nHalf-breed--those that have been born of our women of Indian blood.\r\nWe wish that they should be counted with us, and have their share\r\nof what you have promised. We wish you to accept our demands. It is\r\nthe Half-breeds that are actually living amongst us--those that are\r\nmarried to our women.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I am sent here to treat with the Indians. In Red River,\r\nwhere I came from, and where there is a great body of Half-breeds,\r\nthey must be either white or Indian. If Indians, they get treaty\r\nmoney; if the Half-breeds call themselves white, they get land. All\r\nI can do is to refer the matter to the Government at Ottawa, and to\r\nrecommend what you wish to be granted.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"I hope you will not drop the question; we have understood\r\nyou to say that you came here as a friend, and represented your\r\ncharitableness, and we depend upon your kindness. You must remember\r\nthat our hearts and our brains are like paper; we never forget.\r\nThere is one thing that we want to know. If you should get into\r\ntrouble with the nations, I do not wish to walk out and expose my\r\nyoung men to aid you in any of your wars.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"The English never call the Indians out of their country\r\nto fight their battles. You are living here and the Queen expects\r\nyou to live at peace with the white men and your red brothers, and\r\nwith other nations.\"\r\n\r\nANOTHER CHIEF--\"I ask you a question--I see your roads here passing\r\nthrough the country, and some of your boats--useful articles that\r\nyou use for yourself. Bye and bye we shall see things that run\r\nswiftly, that go by fare--carriages--and we ask you that us Indians\r\nmay not have to pay their passage on these things, but can go\r\nfree.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I think the best thing I can do is to become an Indian.\r\nI cannot promise you to pass on the railroad free, for it may be a\r\nlong time before we get one; and I cannot promise you any more than\r\nother people.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"I must address myself to my friend here, as he is the one\r\nthat has the Public Works.\"\r\n\r\nMR. DAWSON--\"I am always happy to do anything I can for you. I have\r\nalways given you a passage on the boats when I could. I will act as\r\nI have done though I can give no positive promise for the future.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"We must have the privilege of travelling about the country\r\nwhere it is vacant.\"\r\n\r\nMR. McKAY--\"Of course, I told them so.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"Should we discover any metal that was of use, could we have\r\nthe privilege of putting our own price on it?\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"If any important minerals are discovered on any of their\r\nreserves the minerals will be sold for their benefit with their\r\nconsent, but not on any other land that discoveries may take place\r\nupon; as regards other discoveries, of course, the Indian is like\r\nany other man. He can sell his information if he can find a\r\npurchaser.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"It will be as well while we are here that everything should\r\nbe understood properly between us. All of us--those behind us--wish\r\nto have their reserves marked out, which they will point out, when\r\nthe time comes. There is not one tribe here who has not laid it\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONER PROVENCHER (the Governor being temporarily absent)--\"As\r\nsoon as it is convenient to the Government to send surveyors to lay\r\nout the reserves they will do so, and they will try to suit every\r\nparticular band in this respect.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"We do not want anybody to mark out our reserves, we have\r\nalready marked them out.\"\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONER--\"There will be another undertaking between the\r\nofficers of the Government and the Indians among themselves for the\r\nselection of the land; they will have enough of good farming land,\r\nthey may be sure of that.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"Of course, if there is any particular part wanted by the\r\npublic works they can shift us. I understand that; but if we have\r\nany gardens through the country, do you wish that the poor man\r\nshould throw it right away?\"\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONER--\"Of course not.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"These are matters that are the wind-up. I begin now to see\r\nhow I value the proceedings. I have come to this point, and all\r\nthat are taking part in this treaty and yourself I would wish to\r\nhave all your names in writing handed over to us. I would not find\r\nit to my convenience to have a stranger here to transact our\r\nbusiness between me and you. It is a white man who does not\r\nunderstand our language that is taking it down. I would like a man\r\nthat understands our language and our ways. We would ask your\r\nExcellency as a favor to appoint him for us.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I have a very good feeling to Mr. C. Nolin, he has been\r\na good man here; but the appointment of an Agent rests with the\r\nauthorities at Ottawa and I will bring your representation to them,\r\nand I am quite sure it will meet with the respect due to it.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"As regards the fire water, I do not like it and I do not\r\nwish any house to be built to have it sold. Perhaps at times if I\r\nshould be unwell I might take drop just for medicine; and shall any\r\none insist on bringing it where we are, I should break the treaty.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I meant to have spoken of that myself, I meant to put it\r\nin the treaty. He speaks good about it. The Queen and her\r\nParliament in Ottawa have passed a law prohibiting the use of it in\r\nthis territory, and if any shall be brought in for the use of you\r\nas medicine it can only come in by my permission.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"Why we keep you so long is that it is our wish that\r\neverything should be properly understood between us,\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"That is why I am here. It is my pleasure, and I want\r\nwhen we once shake hands that it should be forever.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"That is the principal article. If it was in my midst the\r\nfire water would have spoiled my happiness, and I wish it to be\r\nleft far away from where I am. All the promises that you have made\r\nme, the little promises and the money you have promised, when it\r\ncomes to me year after year--should I see that there is anything\r\nwanting, through the negligence of the people that have to see\r\nafter these things, I trust it will be in my power to put them in\r\nprison.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"The ear of the Queen's Government will always be open to\r\nhear the complaints of her Indian people, and she will deal with\r\nher servants that do not do their duty in a proper manner.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"Now you have promised to give us all your names. I want a\r\ncopy of the treaty that will not be rubbed off, on parchment.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"In the mean time I will give you a copy on paper, and as\r\nsoon as I get back I will get you a copy on parchment.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"I do not wish to be treated as they were at Red River--that\r\nprovisions should be stopped as it is there. Whenever we meet and\r\nhave a council I wish that provisions should be given to us. We\r\ncannot speak without eating.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"You are mistaken. When they are brought together at Red\r\nRiver for their payments they get provisions.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"We wish the provisions to come from Red River.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"If the Great Spirit sends the grasshopper and there is\r\nno wheat grown in Red River, we cannot give it to you.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"You have come before us with a smiling face, you have shown\r\nus great charity--you have promised the good things; you have given\r\nus your best compliments and wishes, not only for once but for\r\never; let there now for ever be peace and friendship between us. It\r\nis the wish of all that where our reserves are peace should reign,\r\nthat nothing shall be there that will disturb peace. Now, I will\r\nwant nothing to be there that will disturb peace, and will put\r\nevery one that carries arms,--such as murderers and thieves--outside,\r\nso that nothing will be there to disturb our peace.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"The Queen will have policemen to preserve order, and\r\nmurderers and men guilty of crime will be punished in this country\r\njust the same as she punishes them herself.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"To speak about the Hudson's Bay Company. If it happens that\r\nthey have surveyed where I have taken my reserve, if I see any of\r\ntheir signs I will put them on one side.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"When the reserves are given you, you will have your\r\nrights. The Hudson's Bay Company have their rights, and the Queen\r\nwill do justice between you.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF OF FORT FRANCIS--\"Why I say this is, where I have chosen for\r\nmy reserve I see signs that the H. B. Co. has surveyed. I do not\r\nhate them. I only wish they should take their reserves on one side.\r\nWhere their shop stands now is my property; I think it is three\r\nyears now since they have had it on it.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I do not know about that matter; it will be enquired\r\ninto. I am taking notes of all these things and am putting them on\r\npaper.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"I will tell you one thing. You understand me now, that I\r\nhave taken your hand firmly and in friendship. I repeat twice that\r\nyou have done so, that these promises that you have made, and the\r\ntreaty to be concluded, let it be as you promise, as long as the\r\nsun rises over our head and as long as the water runs. One thing I\r\nfind, that deranges a little my kettle. In this river, where food\r\nused to be plentiful for our subsistence, I perceive it is getting\r\nscarce. We wish that the river should be left as it was formed from\r\nthe beginning--that nothing be broken.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"This is a subject that I cannot promise.\"\r\n\r\nMR. DAWSON--\"Anything that we are likely to do at present will not\r\ninterfere with the fishing, but no one can tell what the future may\r\nrequire, and we cannot enter into any engagement.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"We wish the Government would assist us in getting a few\r\nboards for some of us who are intending to put up houses this fall,\r\nfrom the mill at Fort Francis.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"The mill is a private enterprise, and we have no power\r\nto give you boards from that.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"I will now show you a medal that was given to those who\r\nmade a treaty at Red River by the Commissioner. He said it was\r\nsilver, but I do not think it is. I should be ashamed to carry it\r\non my breast over my heart. I think it would disgrace the Queen, my\r\nmother, to wear her image on so base a metal as this. [Here the\r\nChief held up the medal and struck it with the back of his knife.\r\nThe result was anything but the 'true ring,' and made every man\r\nashamed of the petty meanness that had been practised.] Let the\r\nmedals you give us be of silver--medals that shall be worthy of\r\nthe high position our Mother the Queen occupies.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I will tell them at Ottawa what you have said, and how\r\nyou have said it.\"\r\n\r\nCHIEF--\"I wish you to understand you owe the treaty much to the\r\nHalf-breeds.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I know it. I sent some of them to talk with you, and I\r\nam proud that all the Half-breeds from Manitoba, who are here, gave\r\ntheir Governor their cordial support.\"\r\n\r\nThe business of the treaty having now been completed, the Chief,\r\nMawedopenais, who, with Powhassan, had with such wonderful tact\r\ncarried on the negotiations, stepped up to the Governor and said:--\r\n\r\n\"Now you see me stand before you all; what has been done here\r\nto-day has been done openly before the Great Spirit, and before\r\nthe nation, and I hope that I may never hear any one say that this\r\ntreaty has been done secretly; and now, in closing this Council, I\r\ntake off my glove, and in giving you my hand, I deliver over my\r\nbirth-right and lands; and in taking your hand, I hold fast all the\r\npromises you have made, and I hope they will last as long as the\r\nsun goes round and the water flows, as you have said.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor then took his hand and said:\r\n\r\n\"I accept your hand and with it the lands, and will keep all my\r\npromises, in the firm belief that the treaty now to be signed will\r\nbind the red man and the white together as friends for ever.\"\r\n\r\nA copy of the treaty was then prepared and duly signed, after which\r\na large amount of presents consisting of pork, flour, clothing,\r\nblankets, twine, powder and shot, etc., were distributed to the\r\nseveral bands represented on the ground.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, Mr. Pether, Local Superintendent of Indian Affairs at\r\nFort Francis, and Mr. Graham of the Government Works, began to pay\r\nthe treaty money--an employment that kept them busy far into the\r\nnight. Some of the Chiefs received as much as one hundred and\r\nseventy dollars for themselves and families.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the money was distributed the shops of the H. B. Co.,\r\nand other resident traders were visited, as well as the tents of\r\nnumerous private traders, who had been attracted thither by the\r\nprospect of doing a good business. And while these shops all did a\r\ngreat trade--the H. B. Co. alone taking in $4,000 in thirty\r\nhours--it was a noticeable fact that many took home with them\r\nnearly all their money. When urged to buy goods there, a frequent\r\nreply was: \"If we spend all our money here and go home and want\r\ndebt, we will be told to get our debt where we spent our money.\"\r\n\"Debt\" is used by them instead of the word \"credit.\" Many others\r\ndeposited money with white men and Half-breeds on whose honor they\r\ncould depend, to be called for and spent at Fort Garry when \"the\r\nground froze.\"\r\n\r\nOne very wonderful thing that forced itself on the attention of\r\nevery one was the perfect order that prevailed throughout the camp,\r\nand which more particularly marked proceedings in the council.\r\nWhether the demands put forward were granted by the Governor\r\nor not, there was no petulance, no ill-feeling, evinced; but\r\neverything was done with a calm dignity that was pleasing\r\nto behold, and which might be copied with advantage by more\r\npretentious deliberative assemblies.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoon, the Governor presented an ox to the nation,\r\nand after it had been eaten a grand dance was indulged in. Monday\r\nmorning the river Indians took passage on the steamer for Fort\r\nFrancis, and others left in their canoes for their winter quarters.\r\n\r\nThe Governor and party left on Monday morning, the troops, under\r\ncommand of Captain McDonald, who had conducted themselves with the\r\ngreatest propriety, and had contributed, by the moral effect of\r\ntheir presence, much to the success of the negotiation, having\r\nmarched to Fort Garry on Saturday morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE QU'APPELLE TREATY, OR NUMBER FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nThis treaty, is, so generally called, from having been made at\r\nthe Qu'Appelle Lakes, in the North-West Territories. The Indians\r\ntreated with, were a portion of the Cree and Saulteaux Tribes, and\r\nunder its operations, about 75,000 square miles of territory were\r\nsurrendered. This treaty, was the first step towards bringing\r\nthe Indians of the Fertile Belt into closer relations with the\r\nGovernment of Canada, and was a much needed one. In the year 1871,\r\nMajor Butler was sent into the North-West Territories by the\r\nGovernment of Canada, to examine into and report, with regard to\r\nthe state of affairs there. He reported, to Lieutenant-Governor\r\nArchibald, that \"law and order are wholly unknown in the region\r\nof the Saskatchewan, in so much, as the country is without any\r\nexecutive organization, and destitute of any means of enforcing\r\nthe law.\" Towards remedying this serious state of affairs, the\r\nDominion placed the North-West Territories under the rule of\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor and Council of the Territories, the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Manitoba, being, ex officio, Governor of the\r\nTerritories. This body, composed of representative men, possessed\r\nexecutive functions, and legislative powers. They entered upon\r\ntheir duties with zeal, and discharged them with efficiency.\r\nAmongst other measures, they passed a prohibitory liquor law, which\r\nsubsequently was practically adopted by a Statute of the Dominion.\r\nThey proposed the establishment of a Mounted Police Force, a\r\nsuggestion which was given force to by the Dominion Cabinet, and\r\nthey recommended, that, treaties should be made, with the Indians\r\nat Forts Qu'Appelle, Carlton and Pitt, recommendations, which, were\r\nall, eventually, carried out. In the report of the Minister of\r\nthe Interior, for the year 1875, he states \"that it is due to the\r\nCouncil to record the fact, that the legislation and valuable\r\nsuggestions, submitted to your Excellency, from time to time,\r\nthrough their official head, Governor Morris, aided the Government\r\nnot a little in the good work of laying the foundations of law\r\nand order, in the North-West, in securing the good will of the\r\nIndian tribes, and in establishing the prestige of the Dominion\r\nGovernment, throughout that vast country.\" In accordance with these\r\nsuggestions, the Government of the Dominion, decided, on effecting\r\na treaty, with the plain Indians, Crees and Chippawas, who inhabit\r\nthe country, of which, Fort Qu'Appelle, was a convenient centre,\r\nand entrusted the duty, to the Hon. Alexander Morris then\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Manitoba and the North-West Territories,\r\nthe Hon. David Laird, then Minister of the Interior, and now\r\nLieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, and the Hon. W.\r\nJ. Christie, a retired factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, and a\r\ngentleman of large experience, among the Indian tribes.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this mission, these gentlemen left Fort Garry in\r\nAugust, 1874, and journeyed to Lake Qu'Appelle (the calling or\r\nechoing lake), where they met the assembled Indians, in September.\r\nThe Commissioners, had an escort of militia, under the command of\r\nLieut.-Col. Osborne Smith, C.M.G. This force marched to and from\r\nQu'Appelle, acquitted themselves with signal propriety, and proved\r\nof essential service. Their return march was made in excellent\r\ntime. The distance, three hundred and fifty miles having been\r\naccomplished in sixteen and a half days.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners encountered great difficulties, arising, from the\r\nexcessive demands of the Indians, and from the jealousies, existing\r\nbetween the two Nations, Crees and Chippawas, but by perseverance,\r\nfirmness and tact, they succeeded in overcoming the obstacles, they\r\nhad to encounter, and eventually effected a treaty, whereby the\r\nIndian title was extinguished in a tract of country, embracing\r\n75,000 square miles of territory. After long and animated\r\ndiscussions the Indians, asked to be granted the same terms as were\r\naccorded to the Indians of Treaty Number Three, at the North-West\r\nAngle, hereinbefore mentioned. The Commissioners assented to their\r\nrequest and the treaty was signed accordingly.\r\n\r\nOn the return, of the Commissioners to Fort Ellice, they met there,\r\nthe Chippawas of that vicinage, and made a supplementary treaty\r\nwith them. These Indians were included in the boundaries of Treaty\r\nNumber Two, but had not been treated with, owing to their distance\r\nfrom Manitoba House, where that treaty was made. In 1875, the Hon.\r\nW. J. Christie, and Mr. M. G. Dickieson, then of the Department of\r\nthe Interior, and subsequently, Assistant Superintendent of Indian\r\naffairs, in the North-West Territories, were appointed to make the\r\npayments of annuities, to the Indians, embraced in the Treaty\r\nNumber Four, and obtain the adhesion of other bands, which had\r\nnot been present at Qu'Appelle, the previous year. They met, the\r\nIndians, at Qu'Appelle (where six Chiefs who had been absent,\r\naccepted the terms of the treaty) and at Fort Pelly and at Shoal\r\nRiver, where two other Chiefs, with their bands, came into the\r\ntreaty stipulations. A gratifying feature connected with the making\r\nof this, and the other, North-Western Treaties, has been the\r\nreadiness, with which the Indians, who were absent, afterwards\r\naccepted the terms which had been settled for them, by those, who\r\nwere able to attend. I close these observations, by annexing,\r\nthe reports of Lieutenant-Governor Morris, to the Honorable the\r\nSecretary of State of Canada, of date 17th October, 1874, giving,\r\nan account, of the making of the treaties at Qu'Appelle and\r\nFort Ellice, and an extract, from that of Messrs. Christie and\r\nDickieson, dated 7th October, 1875, describing its further\r\ncompletion, and I also insert, accurate short-hand reports of the\r\nproceedings at Qu'Appelle and Fort Ellice, which, were made, at\r\nthe time, by Mr. Dickieson, who, was present, at the treaty, as\r\nsecretary to the Commissioners. These will be found to be both\r\ninteresting and instructive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE,\r\nFORT GARRY, MANITOBA, October 17, 1874.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to inform you that in compliance with the\r\nrequest of the Government, I proceeded to Lake Qu'Appelle in\r\ncompany with the Hon. David Laird, in order to act with him and W.\r\nJ. Christie, Esq., as Commissioners to negotiate a treaty with the\r\ntribes of Indians in that region.\r\n\r\nMr. Laird and I left Fort Garry on the 26th of August, and arrived\r\nat Lake Qu'Appelle on the 8th of September, Mr. Christie having\r\ngone in advance of us to Fort Pelly.\r\n\r\nWe were accompanied on arriving by the escort of militia under the\r\ncommand of Lieut.-Col. W. Osborne Smith, who had preceded us, but\r\nwhom we had overtaken.\r\n\r\nThe escort took up their encampment at a very desirable situation\r\non the edge of the lake, the Indians being encamped at some\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners were kindly provided with apartments by W. J.\r\nMcLean, Esq., the officer in charge of the Hudson Bay Company's\r\nPost.\r\n\r\nAfter our arrival, the Commissioners caused the Indians to be\r\nsummoned, to meet them, in a marquee tent adjoining the encampment\r\nof the militia.\r\n\r\nThe Crees came headed by their principal Chief \"Loud Voice,\" and\r\na number of Saulteaux followed, without their Chief, Cote. The\r\nCommissioners, having decided that it was desirable that there\r\nshould be only one speaker on behalf of the Commissioners,\r\nrequested me owing to my previous experience with the Indian tribes\r\nand my official position as Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West\r\nTerritories, to undertake the duty, which I agreed to do.\r\nAccordingly, I told the Indians the object of our coming and\r\ninvited them to present to us their Chiefs and headmen. \"Loud\r\nVoice\" stated that they were not yet ready and asked for a delay\r\ntill next day, to which we assented.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th, four Indian soldiers were sent to the Commissioners to\r\nask for two days delay, but we replied that when they met us in\r\nconference they could prefer any reasonable request, but that we\r\nexpected them to meet us as agreed on the previous day, and further\r\nthat the Saulteaux had not conducted themselves with proper respect\r\nto the Commissioners, as representatives of the Crown, as their\r\nprincipal Chief Cote had not met us. Eventually, both the Crees and\r\nthe Saulteaux met us, with their Chiefs, when I addressed them.\r\nThey asked time to deliberate and we appointed the 11th at ten\r\no'clock for the next conference.\r\n\r\nThe Crees then left the tent suddenly, under constraint of the\r\nIndian soldiers, who compelled the Chiefs to go.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th we sent a bugler round to summon the Indians to the\r\nappointed conference, but they did not come.\r\n\r\nInstead the Saulteaux sent word that they could not meet us except\r\nin their own soldiers tent, distant about a mile from the militia\r\nencampment, but we refused to do so.\r\n\r\nThe Crees were ready to proceed to the marquee, but were prevented\r\nby the Saulteaux, a section of whom displayed a turbulent\r\ndisposition and were numerically the strongest party. We sent our\r\ninterpreter Charles Pratt, a Cree Indian, who was educated at\r\nSt. John's College here, and who is a catechist of the Church of\r\nEngland, to tell the Indians that they must meet us as agreed upon.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, about four o'clock in the afternoon the Crees led\r\nby \"Loud Voice,\" came to the conference but the Saulteaux kept\r\naway, though a number were sent to hear and report. On behalf of\r\nthe Commissioners, I then explained to the Crees the object of our\r\nmission and made our proposals for a treaty, but as they were not\r\nready to reply, we asked them to return to their tents and meet us\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th the Crees and Saulteaux sent four men from the soldiers\r\ntent or council, which they had organized, to ask that the\r\nencampment of the militia and the conference tents should be\r\nremoved half way, towards their encampment.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, we requested Lieut.-Col. Smith to proceed to the\r\nIndian encampment and ascertain the meaning of this demand\r\nauthorizing him, if necessary, to arrange for the pitching of the\r\nconference tent nearer the Indians, if that would give them any\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nHe reported, on his return, that the Indians wished the militia to\r\nencamp with them, and that they objected to meet us anywhere on\r\nthe reserve of the Hudson Bay Company, as they said they could not\r\nspeak freely there.\r\n\r\nHe refused to remove the militia camp, as it was a very desirable\r\nplace where it had been placed, but with the assent of the Indians\r\nselected a spot adjoining the reserve and at a suitable distance\r\nfrom the Indian tents, on which the conference tent was to be daily\r\nerected, but to be removed after the conferences closed.\r\n\r\nWe then summoned the Indians to meet us at one o'clock which they\r\ndid at the appointed place.\r\n\r\nAfter the formal hand shaking, which ceremony they repeat at the\r\nbeginning and close of every interview the Commissioners submitted\r\ntheir terms for a treaty, which were in effect similar to those\r\ngranted at the North-West Angle, except that the money present\r\noffered was eight dollars per head, instead of twelve dollars as\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe Indians declined, however, to talk about these proposals, as\r\nthey said there was something in the way. They objected to the\r\nreserve having been surveyed for the Hudson Bay Company, without\r\ntheir first having been consulted, and claimed that the L300,000\r\npaid to the Company should be paid to them. They also objected to\r\nthe Company's trading in the Territory, except only at their posts.\r\nThe Commissioners refused to comply with their demands, and\r\nexplained to them how the Company had become entitled to the\r\nreserve in question, and the nature of the arrangement, that had\r\nresulted in the payment by the Government of Canada of the\r\nL300,000.\r\n\r\nThe conference adjourned to Monday the 14th, on which day the\r\nCommissioners again met them, but the Cree Chief \"Loud Voice\" asked\r\nfor another day to consider the matter, and \"Cote\" or \"Meemay\" the\r\nSaulteaux Chief, from Fort Pelly, asked to be treated with, at his\r\nown place. They demanded, that the Company should only be allowed\r\nto trade at their own posts, and not to send out traders into the\r\nTerritory--which was of course refused, it being explained to them\r\nthat all Her Majesty's subjects had equal right of trading. The\r\nCommissioners then agreed to grant a final delay of another day,\r\nfor further consideration. Up to this period the position was very\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe Crees were from the first ready to treat, as were the Saulteaux\r\nfrom Fort Pelly, but the Saulteaux of the Qu'Appelle District were\r\nnot disposed to do so and attempted to coerce the other Indians.\r\n\r\nThey kept the Chiefs \"Loud Voice\" and \"Cote\" under close\r\nsurveillance, they being either confined to their tents or else\r\nwatched by \"soldiers,\" and threatened if they should make any\r\novertures to us.\r\n\r\nThe Saulteaux cut down the tent over the head of one of the Cree\r\nChiefs and conducted themselves in such a manner, that \"Loud Voice\"\r\napplied to the Commissioners for protection, and the Crees\r\npurchased knives and armed themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Saulteaux, one day went the length of placing six \"soldiers,\"\r\narmed with rifles and revolvers, in the conference tent to\r\nintimidate the other Indians, a step which was promptly counteracted\r\nby Lieut.-Col. Smith, calling in six of the militiamen who were\r\nstationed in the tent. In this connection, I must take the\r\nopportunity of stating that the results proved the wisdom of the\r\ncourse taken by the Commissioners in obtaining the escort of the\r\nmilitia, as their presence exerted great moral influence, and I am\r\npersuaded, prevented the jealousies and ancient feud between the\r\nCrees and Saulteaux culminating in acts of violence.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the whole force was excellent and, whether on the\r\nmarch or in the encampment ground, they conducted themselves in a\r\nmost creditable manner.\r\n\r\nResuming, however, my narrative, on the 15th of September, the\r\nCommissioners again met the Indians at eleven o'clock in the\r\nforenoon.\r\n\r\nThe Crees had, in the interval, decided to treat with us\r\nindependently, and the Saulteaux, finding this, came to a similar\r\nconclusion. After a protracted interview, the Indians asked to be\r\ngranted the same terms as were given at the North-West Angle. The\r\nCommissioners took time to consider and adjourned the conference\r\nuntil three o'clock.\r\n\r\nIn the interval, the Commissioners, being persuaded that a treaty\r\ncould not otherwise be made, determined on acceding to the request\r\nof the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, having again met the Commissioners in the afternoon,\r\npresented their Chiefs to them, when they asked to be informed what\r\nthe terms granted at the North-West Angle were. These were fully\r\nand carefully explained to them, but after a request that all the\r\nIndians owed to the Hudson Bay Company should be wiped out and a\r\nrefusal of the Commissioners to entertain their demands, they then\r\nasked that they should be paid fifteen dollars per annum per head,\r\nwhich was refused, and they were informed that the proposals of the\r\nCommissioners were final, and could not be changed.\r\n\r\nThe Chiefs then agreed to accept the terms offered and to sign\r\nthe treaty, having first asked that the Half-breeds should be\r\nallowed to hunt, and having been assured that the population in\r\nthe North-West would be treated fairly and justly, the treaty was\r\nsigned by the Commissioners and the Chiefs, having been first fully\r\nexplained to them by the interpreter.\r\n\r\nArrangements were then made to commence the payment and distribution\r\nof the presents the next day, a duty which was discharged by Mr.\r\nChristie and Mr. Dickieson, Private Secretary of the Hon. Mr. Laird.\r\n\r\nI forward you to form an appendix to this despatch, a report\r\nmarked \"A\" and \"B\" extended from notes taken in short hand, by Mr.\r\nDickieson, of the various conferences and of the utterances of the\r\nCommissioners and the Indians.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that such a record will prove valuable, as it enables\r\nany misunderstanding on the part of the Indians, as to what was\r\nsaid at the conference, to be corrected, and it, moreover, will\r\nenable the council better to appreciate the character of the\r\ndifficulties that have to be encountered in negotiating with the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th I left for Fort Ellice, in company with Mr. Laird, Mr.\r\nChristie and Mr. Dickieson remaining to complete the payments,\r\nwhich were satisfactorily disposed of.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving, the Chiefs \"Loud Voice\" and Cote called on us to\r\ntender their good wishes, and to assure us that they would teach\r\ntheir people to respect the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners received every assistance in their power from\r\nMr. McDonald of Fort Ellice, in charge of the Hudson Bay Company\r\nDistrict of Swan River, and from Mr. McLean, in charge of the\r\nQu'Appelle Post,--I also add, that the Half-breed population were I\r\nbelieve generally desirous of seeing the treaty concluded and used\r\nthe influence of their connection with the Indians in its favor.\r\n\r\nI forward in another despatch a copy of an address I received from\r\nthe Metis, or Half-breeds, together with my reply thereto.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was taken charge of by the Hon. Mr. Laird, and will be\r\nby him placed on record in his Department and submitted to council\r\nfor approval.\r\n\r\nI enclose herewith, however, a printed copy of it, marked \"C,\" to\r\naccompany this despatch.\r\n\r\nThe supplementary treaty made at Fort Ellice will form the subject\r\nof another despatch.\r\n\r\nTrusting that the efforts of the Commissioners to secure a\r\nsatisfactory understanding with the Western Indians will result in\r\nbenefit to the race, advantage to the Dominion, and meet the\r\napproval of the Privy Council,\r\n\r\n                 I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                           Your obedient servant,\r\n                                    ALEXANDER MORRIS,\r\n                                         Lieut.-Gov. N. W. T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GOVERNMENT HOUSE,\r\n                  FORT GARRY, MANITOBA, October 17th, 1874.\r\n\r\nSir,--Referring to my despatch of the 17th inst., (No. 211) I have\r\nthe honor to report that Mr. Laird and I arrived at Fort Ellice\r\nfrom Qu'Appelle Lakes, on Saturday the 19th of September.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, we met the band of Saulteaux Indians, who make their\r\nheadquarters at Fort Ellice, and who had remained there, instead of\r\ngoing to Qu'Appelle at our request.\r\n\r\nThis band have been in the habit of migrating between the region\r\ncovered by the Second Treaty and that comprehended in the Fourth,\r\nbut had not been treated with.\r\n\r\nWe proposed to them to give their adhesion to the Qu'Appelle Treaty\r\nand surrender their claim to lands, wherever situated, in the\r\nNorth-West Territories, on being given a reserve and being granted\r\nthe terms on which the treaty in question was made. We explained\r\nfully these terms and asked the Indians to present to us their\r\nChief and headmen. As some of the band were absent, whom the\r\nIndians desired to be recognized as headmen, only the Chief and one\r\nheadman were presented. These, on behalf of the Indians accepted\r\nthe terms and thanked the Queen and the Commissioners for their\r\ncare of the Indian people. A supplement to the treaty was then\r\nsubmitted and fully explained to them, by our acting interpreter,\r\nJoseph Robillard, after which it was signed by Mr. Laird and\r\nmyself, and by the Chief and head man.\r\n\r\nThe original of the supplementary treaty will be submitted for\r\napproval by Mr. Laird, but I annex a printed copy of it, as an\r\nappendix to this despatch.\r\n\r\nI also annex, notes of the conference with these Indians, extended\r\nfrom the short hand report taken of the proceedings by Mr.\r\nDickieson, Private Secretary to the Hon. Mr. Laird.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, Mr. Christie and Mr. Dickieson arrived from Lake\r\nQu'Appelle, and shortly afterwards proceeded to make the payments\r\nto the Indians, under the treaty.\r\n\r\nIt was satisfactory to have this band dealt with, as they asserted\r\nclaims in the region covered by the Manitoba Post Treaty, but had\r\nnot been represented at the time it was made.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of September the Commissioners left Fort Ellice and\r\narrived at Fort Garry on the afternoon of the 26th of that month,\r\nhaving been absent a little over a month.\r\n\r\n            I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                      Your obedient Servant,\r\n                             ALEXANDER MORRIS,\r\n                                 Lieut.-Gov. N. W. T.\r\nTHE HONORABLE\r\n   THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE PROVINCES,\r\n                                      Ottawa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINNIPEG, MANITOBA, 7th October, 1875.\r\n\r\nSir,--We have now the honor to submit, for your information, our\r\nfinal report in connection with our missions to the Indians\r\nincluded in Treaty No 4.\r\n\r\nAs former reports have made you fully acquainted with the\r\narrangements that had been entered into previous to our departure\r\nfrom this place, any further reference to them is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nHaving left Winnipeg on the 19th August, we arrived at Fort Ellice\r\non the 24th, the day appointed for the meeting the Indians of\r\nthat place. The same evening we had an interview with, and fully\r\nexplained the terms and conditions of the treaty to some of the\r\nIndians who were not present when the treaty was concluded last\r\nyear. Next morning, by appointment, we met all the Indians\r\nand explained to them the object of our mission, and, after\r\nconsiderable discussion, made arrangements to commence paying the\r\nannuities next day. This, however, was prevented by heavy rains,\r\nwhich continued more or less to retard our operations on the\r\ntwo following days, the 27th and 28th, but everything was\r\nsatisfactorily concluded with this band on the evening of the\r\nlatter day, and on the following morning we started for the\r\nQu'Appelle Lakes, accompanied by an escort of fifteen men of the\r\nMounted Police Force, under the command of Sub-Inspector McIllree,\r\nwhich had arrived at Fort Ellice on the evening of the 26th, and\r\nreached our destination on the forenoon of the 2nd September.\r\n\r\nAs you are aware, we had heard before leaving Winnipeg, that the\r\nnumber of Indians assembled at the Qu'Appelle Lakes would be very\r\nlarge, but we did not anticipate that so many as we found (nearly\r\nfive hundred lodges) would be congregated.\r\n\r\nWe at once saw that the funds at our disposal to pay the annuities\r\nand gratuities would be inadequate, and availed ourselves of the\r\nopportunity presented by the return of Major Irvine to Winnipeg,\r\nto forward a telegram on the 5th September, requesting a further\r\namount of six thousand dollars to be placed to our credit; and we\r\nmay state here, though out of the order of time, as we found after\r\nthe first two days payments that we had still underestimated the\r\nnumber of Indians present, we transmitted a telegram to Winnipeg by\r\nspecial messenger, on the 9th September, for a further credit of\r\nfifteen thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd September we met the Indians and explained the object\r\nof our mission, and, for the benefit of those who were absent last\r\nyear, the terms and conditions of the treaty, and stated that\r\nwe were now ready to fulfil so many of the obligations therein\r\ncontained as the Government were bound to execute this year. The\r\nIndians declined saying anything on this occasion, but wished to\r\nmeet and confer with in the following day, as they had something\r\nthey wished to speak about. They accordingly met us on the 4th,\r\nand made several demands, one of which was that the annuities be\r\nincreased to twelve dollars per head. We replied that the treaty\r\nconcluded last year was a covenant between them and the Government,\r\nand it was impossible to comply with their demands; that all we had\r\nto do was to carry out the terms of the treaty in so far as the\r\nobligations of the same required. An idea seemed prevalent among\r\nthe Indians who were absent last year that no treaty had been\r\nconcluded then; that all which had been done at that time was\r\nmerely preliminary to the making of the treaty in reality, which\r\nthey thought was to be performed this year. The prevalence of this\r\nopinion amongst them operated very prejudicially to the furthering\r\nof our business, and we saw that until this was done away with it\r\nwould be impossible to do anything towards accomplishing the real\r\nobject of our mission. After a great deal of talking on their\r\npart, and explanation on ours, the meeting adjourned until Monday\r\nmorning, as it was necessary that provisions should be issued to\r\nthe different bands that evening for the following day.\r\n\r\nOn Monday (the 6th) we again met the Indians, and as they evidently\r\nwished to have another day's talking to urge the same demands they\r\nhad made on Saturday, we assured them all further discussion on the\r\nsubject was useless; that if they declined to accept the terms of\r\nthe treaty we must return and report to the Government that they\r\nhad broken the promise made last year. They then asked that we\r\nshould report to the Government what they had demanded. This we\r\nagreed to do. After some further explanation to those Chiefs who\r\nhad not signed the treaty, the payment of the annuities and\r\ngratuities was commenced and continued by Messrs. Dickieson and\r\nForsyth on this and the three following days until completed,\r\nduring which time Mr. Christie conferred with the Chiefs as to\r\nthe locality of their reserves.\r\n\r\nSix Chiefs who had not been present last year when the treaty was\r\nconcluded, agreed to accept the terms of the same, and signed their\r\nadhesion previous to being paid. The instruments thus signed by\r\nthem are transmitted herewith.\r\n\r\nThe suits of clothes, flags, medals and copies of the treaty were\r\ngiven to the Chiefs and headmen as they were paid, and on the 10th\r\nthe ammunition and twine were distributed, also provisions to each\r\nband for the return journey to their hunting grounds. * * * * * *\r\n\r\n       We have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                  Your obedient servants,\r\n                             W. J. CHRISTIE,\r\n                                Indian Commissioner.\r\n                             M. G. DICKIESON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReport of the proceedings at the Conference between the Hon.\r\nAlexander Morris, Lieut.-Governor of the North-West Territories,\r\nthe Hon. David Laird, Minister of the Interior, and W. J. Christie,\r\nEsq., the Commissioners appointed by Order in Council to treat with\r\nthe Indians inhabiting the country described in the said Order in\r\nCouncil, the first conference having been held at Qu'Appelle,\r\nSeptember 8th, 1874:\r\n\r\nFIRST DAY'S CONFERENCE\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock the Commissioners entered the marquee erected for\r\nthe accommodation of themselves, and the Indians, who in in a short\r\ntime arrived, shook hands with the Commissioners, the officers of\r\nthe guard, and other gentlemen who were in the tent, and took their\r\nseats.\r\n\r\nIt having been noticed that Cote, \"the Pigeon,\" a leading Chief of\r\nthe Saulteaux tribe, had not arrived but that several of his band\r\nwere present and claimed that they had been sent to represent him,\r\nHis Honor the Lieut.-Governor instructed the (acting) interpreter,\r\nWilliam Daniel, to enquire why their Chief had not come to meet the\r\nCommissioners, the white chiefs?\r\n\r\nTo this question they answered, that he had given no reason.\r\n\r\nHis Honor, through the interpreter, told them that the Queen had\r\nsent him and the other Commissioners to see their Chief and their\r\nnation, and that the least a loyal subject could do would be to\r\nmeet the messengers of the Queen.\r\n\r\nHis Honor then addressed the Crees as follows: \"The Commissioners\r\nhaving agreed that as Lieut.-Governor he should speak to them, as\r\nwe are sent here by the Queen, by the Great Mother--the Queen has\r\nchosen me to be one of her Councillors, and has sent me here to\r\nrepresent her and has made me Governor of all her Territories\r\nin the North-West. She has sent another of her Councillors who\r\nhas come all the way from Ottawa. She has also sent with us Mr.\r\nChristie, whom you all know, who has lived for a long time in this\r\ncountry, but who had gone away from it to live in another part of\r\nthe Dominion of Canada. The Queen loves her Red children; she has\r\nalways been friends with them; she knows that it is hard for them\r\nto live, and she has always tried to help them in the other parts\r\nof the Dominion. Last year she sent me to see her children at the\r\nLake of the Woods. I took her children there by the hand, and the\r\nwhite man and the red man made friends for ever. We have come here\r\nwith a message from the Queen and want to tell you all her mind. We\r\nwant to speak to you about the land and what the Queen is willing\r\nto do for you, but before we tell you, we want you to tell us, who\r\nyour Chiefs and headmen are who will speak for you, while we speak\r\nfor the Queen, and we want to know what bands of Crees are here and\r\nwho will speak for them. We wish to know if the Crees are ready to\r\nspeak with us now?\"\r\n\r\nRA-KU-SHI-WAY, THE LOUD VOICE,--Said in reply: \"I do not wish to\r\ntell a lie. I cannot say who will speak for us; it will only be\r\nknown after consultation.\"\r\n\r\nHIS HONOR THE LIEUT.-GOV.--\"By to-morrow you will probably have\r\nchosen whom you will have to speak for you and the Commissioners\r\nwill be glad to meet you after you have chosen your spokesmen, and\r\nwill meet you at ten o'clock. We want you to tell us openly what\r\nyou want and we will speak to you for the Queen in the same way.\r\nThe Colonel will send a man round to sound a bugle at ten o'clock\r\nto let you know.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Saulteaux His Honor said: \"We are here with a message from\r\nthe Great Mother and want you to open my mouth so that I can tell\r\nyou what I have to say. If you and your Chiefs will meet together\r\nin council and talk it over we will be glad to meet you, if you\r\nbring your Chief to-morrow. You must also choose your speakers who\r\nwill come with your Chief and speak for you.\"\r\n\r\nLOUD VOICE--\"I will tell the message that is given me to tell. I\r\nhave one thing to say, the first word that came to them was for the\r\nSaulteaux tribe to choose a place to pitch their tents.\"\r\n\r\nHIS HONOR--\"This place was chosen because it is a good place for\r\nmy men--for the soldiers--there is plenty of water and grass, and\r\nI will meet you here to-morrow. That is all at present.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the main body of Cree Indians, Saulteaux,\r\nfrom the Cypress Hills, entered the tent saying that they had no\r\nChief, and did not want to go with the main body of the nation,\r\nthat they had plenty of friends on the plains.\r\n\r\nHis Honor said they would hear the Queen's message with the rest of\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND DAY'S CONFERENCE\r\n\r\nSeptember 9, 1874.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, both Crees, Saulteaux and their Chiefs having arrived,\r\nHis Honor Lieut.-Governor Morris said: \"I am glad to see so many\r\nof the Queen's red children here this morning. I told those I\r\nsaw yesterday that I was one of the Queen's councillors, and had\r\nanother councillor with me from Ottawa and that the Queen had sent\r\nMr. Christie who used to live amongst you to help us. Yesterday the\r\nCree nation with their Chief were here, the Saulteaux did not come\r\nto meet the Queen's servants, their Chief was not here. I thought\r\nthat the Saulteaux could not have understood that the Queen had\r\nsent her servants to see them, or they would have come to meet\r\nthem. If Loud Voice or any other Chief came down to Fort Garry to\r\nsee me, and I sent one of my servants to meet them instead of\r\nshaking hands with them, would they be pleased? I wanted you to\r\nmeet me here to-day because I wanted to speak to you before the\r\nGreat Spirit and before the world. I want both Crees and Saulteaux\r\nto know what I say. I told those who were here yesterday that we\r\nhad a message from the Queen to them. Last year I made a treaty\r\nwith the Indians, 4,000 in number, at the Lake of the Woods. To-day\r\nthe Queen sends us here. I told you yesterday that she loves her\r\nred children, and they have always respected her and obeyed her\r\nlaws. I asked you yesterday, and ask you now, to tell me who would\r\nspeak for you, and how many bands of each nation are represented\r\nhere. I have heard that you are not ready to speak to me yet but do\r\nnot know it, and I want you to say anything you have to say before\r\nall, and I will speak in the same way. What I have to talk about\r\nconcerns you, your children and their children, who are yet unborn,\r\nand you must think well over it, as the Queen has thought well over\r\nit. What I want, is for you to take the Queen's hand, through mine,\r\nand shake hands with her for ever, and now I want, before I say any\r\nmore, to hear from the Chiefs if they are ready with their men to\r\nspeak for them, and if they are not ready if they will be ready\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nCAN-A-HAH-CHA-PEW, THE MAN OF THE BOW,--\"We are not ready yet, we\r\nhave not gathered together yet. That is all I have to say.\"\r\n\r\nPEI-CHE-TO'S SON--O-TA-HA-O-MAN, THE GAMBLER--\"My dear friends,\r\ndo you want me to speak for you to these great men?\" (the Indians\r\nsignified their consent). \"I heard you were to come here, that was\r\nthe reason that all the camps were collected together, I heard\r\nbefore-hand too where the camp was to be placed, but I tell you\r\nthat I am not ready yet. Every day there are other Indians coming\r\nand we are not all together. Where I was told to pitch my tent that\r\nis where I expected to see the great men in the camp. That is all.\"\r\n\r\nHIS HONOR--\"With regard to the camp, the Queen sent one of her\r\nchief men of our soldiers with us, and he selected the best place\r\nfor the men, the place where we are now, and I think it is a good\r\nplace. At first he thought to have encamped across the river, but\r\nhe thought this was better ground and chose it. I think it just as\r\nwell that our tents should be at a little distance from your braves\r\nand your camp. I want to say to the Indian children of the Queen\r\nthat if their people are coming in, that our men have walked a long\r\nway here, and must go back again to Fort Garry, and I have other\r\nthings to do. Mr. Laird has to go back again to look after other\r\nthings for the Queen at Ottawa. I want to ask the Chiefs when they\r\nwill be ready to meet us to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nPEI-CHE-TO'S SON--\"I have said before, we are not ready.\"\r\n\r\nHIS HONOR--\"Let them send me word through their Chiefs when they\r\nare ready.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD DAY'S CONFERENCE\r\n\r\nSeptember 11, 1874.\r\n\r\nThe Crees and their Chiefs met the Commissioners. The Saulteaux\r\nChief was not present, though most of the tribe were present.\r\n\r\nAn Indian, \"the Crow,\" advised the assembled Crees, the Saulteaux\r\nnot having arrived, to listen attentively to what words he said.\r\n\r\nHis Honor the Lieut.-Governor then arose and said: \"I am glad to\r\nmeet you here to-day. We have waited long and began to wonder\r\nwhether the Queen's red children were not coming to meet her\r\nmessengers. All the ground here is the Queen's and you are free to\r\nspeak your mind fully. We want you to speak to me face to face. I\r\nam ready now with my friends here to give you the Queen's message.\r\nAre your ears open to hear? Have you chosen your speakers?\"\r\n\r\nTHE LOUD VOICE--\"There is no one to answer.\"\r\n\r\nHIS HONOR--\"You have had time enough to select your men to answer\r\nand I will give you the Queen's message. The Queen knows that you\r\nare poor; the Queen knows that it is hard to find food for\r\nyourselves and children; she knows that the winters are cold, and\r\nyour children are often hungry; she has always cared for her red\r\nchildren as much as for her white. Out of her generous heart and\r\nliberal hand she wants to do something for you, so that when the\r\nbuffalo get scarcer, and they are scarce enough now, you may be\r\nable to do something for yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nTHE LOUD VOICE (to the Indians)--\"I wonder very much at your\r\nconduct. You understand what is said and you understand what is\r\nright and good. You ought to listen to that and answer it, every\r\none of you. What is bad you cannot answer.\"\r\n\r\nHIS HONOR--\"What the Queen and her Councillors would like is this,\r\nshe would like you to learn something of the cunning of the white\r\nman. When fish are scarce and the buffalo are not plentiful she\r\nwould like to help you to put something in the land, she would like\r\nthat you should have some money every year to buy things that you\r\nneed. If any of you would settle down on the land, she would give\r\nyou cattle to help you; she would like you to have some seed to\r\nplant. She would like to give you every year, for twenty years,\r\nsome powder, shot, and twine to make nets of. I see you here before\r\nme to-day. I will pass away and you will pass away. I will go where\r\nmy fathers have gone and you also, but after me and after you will\r\ncome our children. The Queen cares for you and for your children,\r\nand she cares for the children that are yet to be born. She would\r\nlike to take you by the hand and do as I did for her at the Lake of\r\nthe Woods last year. We promised them and we are ready to promise\r\nnow to give five dollars to every man, woman and child, as long as\r\nthe sun shines and water flows. We are ready to promise to give\r\n$1,000 every year, for twenty years, to buy powder and shot and\r\ntwine, by the end of which time I hope you will have your little\r\nfarms. If you will settle down we would lay off land for you, a\r\nsquare mile for every family of five. Whenever you go to a Reserve,\r\nthe Queen will be ready to give you a school and schoolmaster, and\r\nthe Government will try to prevent fire-water from being sent among\r\nyou. If you shake hands with us and make a treaty, we are ready to\r\nmake a present at the end of the treaty, of eight dollars for every\r\nman, woman and child in your nations. We are ready also to give\r\ncalico, clothing and other presents. We are ready to give every\r\nrecognized Chief, a present of twenty-five dollars, a medal, and a\r\nsuit of clothing. We are also ready to give the Chief's soldiers,\r\nnot exceeding four in each band, a present of ten dollars, and next\r\nyear and every year after, each chief will be paid twenty-five\r\ndollars, and his chief soldiers not exceeding four in each band,\r\nwill receive ten dollars. Now I think that you see that that the\r\nQueen loves her red children, that she wants to do you good, and\r\nyou ought to show that you think so. I cannot believe that you will\r\nbe the first Indians, the Queen's subjects, who will not take her\r\nby the hand. The Queen sent one of her councillors from Ottawa, and\r\nme, her Governor, to tell you her mind. I have opened my hands and\r\nheart to you. It is for you to think of the future of those who are\r\nwith you now, of those who are coming after you, and may the Great\r\nSpirit guide you to do what is right. I have only one word more to\r\nsay. The last time I saw you I was not allowed to say all I wanted\r\nto say until you went away. What I wanted to say is this, I have\r\nput before you our message, I want you to go back to your tents and\r\nthink over what I have said and come and meet me to-morrow.\r\nRecollect that we cannot stay very long here. I have said all.\"\r\n\r\nFOURTH DAY'S CONFERENCE\r\n\r\nSeptember 12, 1874.\r\n\r\nIn the morning four Indians, two Crees and two Saulteaux, waited on\r\nthe Commissioners and asked that they should meet the Indians half\r\nway, and off the Company's reserve, and that the soldiers should\r\nremove their camps beside the Indian encampment, that they would\r\nmeet the Commissioners then and confer with them; that there was\r\nsomething in the way of their speaking openly where the marquee had\r\nbeen pitched. Their request was complied with as regarded the place\r\nof meeting only, and the spot for the conference selected by Col.\r\nSmith and the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was opened by the Lieut.-Governor, who said, \"Crees and\r\nSaulteaux,--I have asked you to meet us here to-day. We have been\r\nasking you for many days to meet us and this is the first time you\r\nhave all met us. If it was not my duty and if the Queen did not\r\nwish it, I would not have taken so much trouble to speak to you. We\r\nare sent a long way to give you her message. Yesterday I told the\r\nCrees her message, and I know that the Saulteaux know what it was,\r\nbut that there may be no mistake, I will tell it to you again and I\r\nwill tell you more. When I have given my message understand that\r\nyou will have to answer it, as I and my friends will have to leave\r\nyou. You are the subjects of the Queen, you are her children, and\r\nyou are only a little band to all her other children. She has\r\nchildren all over the world, and she does right with them all. She\r\ncares as much for you as she cares for her white children, and the\r\nproof of it is that wherever her name is spoken her people whether\r\nthey be red or white, love her name and are ready to die for it,\r\nbecause she is always just and true. What she promises never\r\nchanges. She knows the condition of her people here; you are not\r\nher only red children; where I come from, in Ontario and in Quebec,\r\nshe has many red children, and away beyond the mountains she has\r\nother red children, and she wants to care for them all. Last year I\r\nwas among the Saulteaux; we have the Saulteaux where I came from.\r\nThey were my friends. I was the son of a white Chief who had a high\r\nplace among them, they told him they would do his work, they called\r\nhim Shekeisheik. I learned from him to love the red man, and it was\r\na pleasant duty and good to my heart when the Queen told me to come\r\namong her Saulteaux children and I expect the Crees and the\r\nSaulteaux to take my hand as they did last year. In our hands they\r\nfeel the Queen's, and if they take them the hands of the white and\r\nred man will never unclasp. In other lands the white and red man\r\nare not such friends as we have always been, and why? Because the\r\nQueen always keeps her word, always protects her red men. She\r\nlearned last winter that bad men from the United States had come\r\ninto her country and had killed some of her red children, What did\r\nshe say? This must not be, I will send my men and will not suffer\r\nthese bad men to hurt my red children, their lives are very dear to\r\nme. And now I will tell you our message. The Queen knows that her\r\nred children often find it hard to live. She knows that her red\r\nchildren, their wives and children, are often hungry, and that the\r\nbuffalo will not last for ever and she desires to do something for\r\nthem. More than a hundred years ago, the Queen's father said to the\r\nred men living in Quebec and Ontario, I will give you land and\r\ncattle and set apart Reserves for you, and will teach you. What has\r\nbeen the result? There the red men are happy; instead of getting\r\nfewer in number by sickness they are growing in number; their\r\nchildren have plenty. The Queen wishes you to enjoy the same\r\nblessings, and so I am here to tell you all the Queen's mind, but\r\nrecollect this, the Queen's High Councillor here from Ottawa, and\r\nI, her Governor, are not traders; we do not come here in the spirit\r\nof traders; we come here to tell you openly, without hiding\r\nanything, just what the Queen will do for you, just what she thinks\r\nis good for you, and I want you to look me in the face, eye to eye,\r\nand open your hearts to me as children would to a father, as\r\nchildren ought to do to a father, and as you ought to the servants\r\nof the great mother of us all. I told my friends yesterday that\r\nthings changed here, that we are here to-day and that in a few\r\nyears it may be we will not be here, but after us will come our\r\nchildren. The Queen thinks of the children yet unborn. I know that\r\nthere are some red men as well as white men who think only of\r\nto-day and never think of to-morrow. The Queen has to think of what\r\nwill come long after to-day. Therefore, the promises we have to\r\nmake to you are not for to-day only but for to-morrow, not only for\r\nyou but for your children born and unborn, and the promises we make\r\nwill be carried out as long as the sun shines above and the water\r\nflows in the ocean. When you are ready to plant seed the Queen's\r\nmen will lay off Reserves so as to give a square mile to every\r\nfamily of five persons, and on commencing to farm the Queen will\r\ngive to every family cultivating the soil two hoes, one spade, one\r\nscythe for cutting the grain, one axe and plough, enough of seed\r\nwheat, barley, oats and potatoes to plant the land they get ready.\r\nThe Queen wishes her red children to learn the cunning of the white\r\nman and when they are ready for it she will send schoolmasters on\r\nevery Reserve and pay them. We have come through the country for\r\nmany days and we have seen hills and but little wood and in many\r\nplaces little water, and it may be a long time before there are\r\nmany white men settled upon this land, and you will have the right\r\nof hunting and fishing just as you have now until the land is\r\nactually taken up. (His Honor repeated the offers which had been\r\ngiven to the Saulteaux on the previous day.) I think I have told\r\nyou all that the Queen is willing to do for you. It ought to show\r\nyou that she has thought more about you than you have about her. I\r\nwill be glad now to have those whom you have selected speak for you\r\nand I again ask you to keep nothing back. This is the first time\r\nyou have had white chiefs, officers of the Queen, so high in her\r\nCouncils, so trusted by her among you. We have no object but your\r\ngood at heart, and therefore we ask you to speak out to us, to open\r\nyour minds to us, and believe that we are your true and best\r\nfriends, who will never advise you badly, who will never whisper\r\nbad words in your ears, who only care for your good and that of\r\nyour children. I have told you the truth, the whole truth, and now\r\nwe expect to hear from the two nations and any other tribe who may\r\nbe represented here. My friend Mr. Laird reminds me that he has\r\ncome from an Island in the far off sea, that he has go back to\r\nOttawa and then go to his own home, that he was asked specially to\r\nhelp me in speaking to you and advising me. He is obliged to go\r\naway as I am, and therefore we want you to answer us.\"\r\n\r\nCOTE, or MEE-MAY (Saulteaux Chief)--\"I cannot say anything to you.\r\nIt is that man (pointing to Loud Voice) will speak.\"\r\n\r\nLOUD VOICE (Cree Chief)--\"If I could speak, if I could manage to\r\nutter my feelings there is reason why I should answer you back; but\r\nthere is something in my way, and that is all I can tell you. This\r\nman (the Gambler) will tell you.\"\r\n\r\nO-TA-KA-O-NAN, OR THE GAMBLER.--\"This morning I saw the chief of\r\nthe soldiers, who asked me what is in your way that you cannot come\r\nand meet the Queen's messengers; then I told him what was in the\r\nway. And now that I am come in, what do I see? You were rather slow\r\nin giving your hand. You said that the Queen spoke through you and\r\nspoke very plainly, but I cannot speak about what you said at\r\npresent; the thing that is in the way that is what I am working\r\nat.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"We have come here for the purpose of knowing\r\nwhat is in your mind. I held out my hand but you did not do as your\r\nnation did at the Angle. When I arrived there the Chief and his men\r\ncame and gave me the pipe of peace and paid me every honor. Why?\r\nBecause I was the servant of the queen. I was not slow in offering\r\nmy hand, I gave it freely and from my heart, and whenever we found\r\nI could please you by coming here, we sent the chief of the\r\nsoldiers to select a suitable place to meet you. You tell me there\r\nis something in your mind. If there is anything standing between\r\nus, how can we take it away or answer you unless we know what it\r\nis?\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"I told the soldier master you did not set your camp\r\nin order, you came and staid beyond over there, that is the reason\r\nI did not run in over there. Now when you have come here, you see\r\nsitting out there a mixture of Half-breeds, Crees, Saulteaux and\r\nStonies, all are one, and you were slow in taking the hand of a\r\nHalf-breed. All these things are many things that are in my way. I\r\ncannot speak about them.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"Why are you here to-day? because we asked you\r\nto come, because it was a good place to speak with them the reason\r\nwe wished to see them. I am now quite willing to tell you all about\r\nFort Pelly. The Queen heard that Americans had come into the\r\ncountry and were treating her Indian children badly. I myself sent\r\nher word that twenty-five of her Indian children, men, women and\r\nchildren, had been shot down by the American traders, then she\r\nresolved to protect her red children, for that reason she has\r\ndetermined to have a body of men on horses as policemen to keep all\r\nbad people, white or red, in order. She will not allow her red\r\nchildren to be made drunk and shot down again as some of them were\r\na few months ago. Now you ought to be glad that you have a Queen\r\nwho takes such an interest in you. What are they doing now up at\r\nFort Pelly? The men must have some place to live in this winter,\r\nthey cannot live out of doors, and some men have gone to Fort Pelly\r\nto build houses for them, and the Queen expects that you will do\r\nall you can to help them because they are your friends. There was a\r\ntreaty before and Indians are paid under it, but we were told as we\r\npassed Fort Ellice that there were a few Indians there who were not\r\nincluded in that treaty, and had never been paid, and they agreed\r\nto meet us when we go back, I do not quite understand another\r\npoint. We have here Crees, Saulteaux, Assiniboines and other\r\nIndians, they are all one, and we have another people, the\r\nHalf-breeds, they are of your blood and my blood. The Queen cares\r\nfor them, one of them is here an officer with a Queen's coat on his\r\nback. At the Lake of the Woods last winter every Half-Breed who was\r\nthere with me was helping me, and I was proud of it, and glad to\r\ntake the word back to the Queen, and her servants, and you may rest\r\neasy, you may leave the Half-breeds in the hands of the Queen who\r\nwill deal generously and justly with them. There was a Half-breed\r\ncame forward to the table. He was only one of many here. I simply\r\nwanted to know whether he was authorized by you to take any part in\r\nthe Council, as it is the Indians alone we are here to meet. He\r\ntold me you wanted him here as a witness. We have plenty of\r\nwitnesses here, but when I heard that, I welcomed him as I had done\r\nyou, and shook hands with him, and he ought to have told you that.\r\nI have given our answer and I have always found this that it is\r\ngood for men to try to understand each other, and to speak openly,\r\nif they do that and both are earnest, if their hearts are pure,\r\nthey will and can understand each other.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"I have understood plainly before what he (the Hudson\r\nBay Company) told me about the Queen. This country that he (H. B.\r\nCo.) bought from the Indians let him complete that. It is that\r\nwhich is in the way. I cannot manage to speak upon anything else,\r\nwhen the land was staked off it was all the Company's work. That is\r\nthe reason I cannot speak of other things.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"We don't understand what you mean. Will you\r\nexplain?\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"I know what I have to tell you. Who surveyed this\r\nland? Was it done by the Company? This is the reason I speak of the\r\nCompany, why are you staying in the Company's house?\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOVERNOR MORRIS--\"The Company have a right to have certain\r\nlands granted them by the Queen, who will do what is fair and just\r\nfor the Company, for the Indians, for the Half-breeds, and for the\r\nwhites. She will make no distinction. Whatever she promises she\r\nwill carry out. The Company are are nothing to her except that they\r\nare carrying on trade in this country, and that they are subjects\r\nto her just as you are. You ask then why I went to the Company's\r\nhouse? I came here not at my own pleasure. I am not so strong as\r\nyou are. I never slept in a tent in my life before and was only too\r\nglad to find a home to go to.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gambler--\"I understand now. And now this Company man. This is\r\nthe Company man (pointing to Mr. McDonald). This is the thing I\r\ncannot speak of. The Cree does not know, the Saulteaux does not\r\nknow. It was never known when this was surveyed, neither by the\r\nCree nor the Saulteaux.\"\r\n\r\nLieut.-Gov. Morris--\"The Company are trading in this country and\r\nthey require to have places to carry out their trade. If the Queen\r\ngives them land to hold under her she has a perfect right to do it,\r\njust as she will have a perfect right to lay off lands for you if\r\nyou agree to settle on them. I am sorry for you; I am afraid you\r\nhave been listening to bad voices who have not the interests of the\r\nIndians at heart. If because of these things you will not speak to\r\nus we will go away with hearts sorry for you and for your children,\r\nwho thus throw back in our faces the hand of the Queen that she has\r\nheld out to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gambler--\"It is very plain who speaks; the Crees are not\r\nspeaking, and the Saulteaux is speaking, if the Queen's men came\r\nhere to survey the land. I am telling you plainly. I cannot speak\r\nany other thing till this is cleared up. Look at these children\r\nthat are sitting around here and also at the tents, who are just\r\nthe image of my kindness. There are different kinds of grass\r\ngrowing here that is just like those sitting around here. There is\r\nno difference. Even from the American land they are here, but we\r\nlove them all the same, and when the white skin comes here from far\r\naway I love him all the same. I am telling you what our love and\r\nkindness is. This is what I did when the white man came, but when\r\nhe came back he paid no regard to me how he carried on.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I did not know till I came here that any\r\nsurvey had been made because I had nothing to do with it; but my\r\nfriend, one of the Queen's Councillors, tells me it was done by the\r\nauthority of the Queen.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"I want to tell you the right story. I waited very\r\nmuch for the Queen's messenger when I saw what the Company did.\r\nPerhaps he may know why he did so. Perhaps if I were to ask him now\r\nhe would say. That is what I would think. This is the reason. I am\r\nso pleased at what I see here I cannot manage to speak because of\r\nthe Company.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"We cannot see why you cannot speak to the\r\nQueen's messengers because of the Company. The Company is no\r\ngreater in her sight than one of those little children is in yours,\r\nand whatever she promises, either to the Company or the little\r\nchild, she will do. The Company ought not to be a wall between you\r\nand us; you will make a mistake if you send us away with a wall\r\nbetween us, when there should be none.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"I do not send you away; for all this I am glad. I\r\nknow this is not the Queen's work. He (H. B. Co.) is the head; he\r\ndoes whatever he thinks all around here, that is the reason I\r\ncannot say anything.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I am very sorry that you cannot answer.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"The Company have stolen our land. I heard that at\r\nfirst. I hear it is true. The Queen's messengers never came here,\r\nand now I see the soldiers and the settlers and the policemen. I\r\nknow it is not the Queen's work, only the Company has come and they\r\nare the head, they are foremost; I do not hold it back. Let this be\r\nput to rights; when this is righted I will answer the other.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"The Company have not brought their soldiers\r\nhere. This man is not an officer of the Company. I am not an\r\nofficer of the Company. We did not come at the request of the\r\nCompany, but at that of the Queen. I told you that the Queen had\r\nsent her policemen here. You see the flag there, then know that we\r\nare the Queen's servants, and not the Company's, and it is for you\r\nto decide on the message I have delivered to you.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"When one Indian takes anything from another we call\r\nit stealing, and when we see the present we say pay us. It is the\r\nCompany I mean.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"What did the Company steal from you?\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"The earth, trees, grass, stones, all that which I see\r\nwith my eyes.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"Who made the earth, the grass, the stone, and\r\nthe wood? The Great Spirit. He made them for all his children to\r\nuse, and it is not stealing to use the gift of the Great Spirit.\r\nThe lands are the Queen's under the Great Spirit. The Chippewas\r\nwere not always here. They come from the East. There were other\r\nIndians here and the Chippewas came here, and they used the wood\r\nand the land, the gifts of the Great Spirit to all, and we want to\r\ntry and induce you to believe that we are asking for the good of\r\nall. We do not know how the division between us is to be taken\r\naway. We do not know of any lands that were stolen from you, and if\r\nyou do not open your mouths we cannot get the wall taken away. You\r\ncan open your mouths if you will; we are patient but we cannot\r\nremain here always.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"I cannot manage to speak of anything else. It is this\r\nI am speaking. All the Indians know how the Company set their land\r\nin order long ago. The Company is making it more and that is the\r\nreason I am speaking.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOVERNOR MORRIS--\"Many, many years ago, before we were born,\r\none of the Kings gave the Company certain rights to trade in this\r\ncountry. The Queen thought that this was not just neither to the\r\nwhite nor the red man. She considered that all should be equal; but\r\nwhen the Queen's father's father's hand had been given she could\r\nnot take it back without the Company's consent; therefore she told\r\nthe Company that the time had come when they should no longer be\r\nthe great power in this country, that she would plant her own flag,\r\nthat she would send her own Governor and soldiers, and that they\r\nmust cease to have the only right to trade here (and I am glad to\r\nknow that some of you are good traders), the Queen then told the\r\nCompany that she would govern the country herself, and she told\r\nthem she would give them some land. They had their forts, their\r\nplaces of trade where they raised cattle and grain, and she told\r\nthem they could keep them, and she will no more break with them\r\nthan she will with you. There is no reason why you should not talk\r\nto us. The Company have no more power, no more authority to govern\r\nthis country than you have, it rests with the Queen.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"This is the reason I waited for the Queen's\r\nmessengers to come here because I knew the Company was strong and\r\npowerful, and I knew they would set every thing in order. Truly\r\nsince the Company came here they have brought me many things which\r\nare good, but the Company's work is in my way and I cannot utter my\r\nwords.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"What do you complain of? I can not tell.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"The survey. This one (pointing to an Indian) did not\r\nsay so, and this Saulteaux and he was never told about it. He\r\nshould have been told beforehand that this was to have been done\r\nand it would not have been so, and I want to know why the Company\r\nhave done so. This is the reason I am talking so much about it.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I have told you before that the Queen had\r\npromised to give the Company certain lands around the forts and\r\nshe gave them land around this fort. I have told you that what she\r\npromised she will do. She has taken all the lands in this country\r\nto manage; they were hers; they were her fathers; if she gives you\r\nreserves they will be yours and she will let no one take them from\r\nyou unless you want to sell them yourselves. It will be a sorry\r\nthing if this nation and that nation scattered all over the country\r\nare to suffer because of this little piece of land I see around me.\r\nWhat good is it going to do to raise up a question of this kind\r\nand block the way to our understanding each other when the Queen's\r\nhand, full of love and generosity is held out to you? The blame\r\nrests with you; it is time for you to talk, to open your mouth,\r\nbecause I cannot take away what shuts it, you must do it yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"This is my chief, the Queen never told this man. If\r\nthis had been told him, I would not have said what I said just now.\r\nThe Company's store was only there at first. I do not push back the\r\nQueen's hand. Let this be cleared up.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"Once for all we tell you, whatever number of\r\nacres the Queen has promised to the Company at this post, they will\r\nreceive no more and no less. We will ascertain what was promised,\r\nand will take care to see that what was promised and that only will\r\nbe performed with regard to the land around this Fort. We can give\r\nyou no other answer.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"I am telling you and reporting what I had to tell.\r\nThe Company have no right to this earth, but when they are spoken\r\nto they do not desist, but do it in spite of you. He is the head\r\nand foremost. These Indians you see sitting around report that they\r\nonly allowed the store to be put up. That is the reason I was very\r\nglad when I heard you were coming. The Indians were not told of the\r\nreserves at all. I hear now, it was the Queen gave the land. The\r\nIndians thought it was they who gave it to the Company, who are now\r\nall over the country. The Indians did not know when the land was\r\ngiven.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I am weary hearing about the country. You\r\nmight understand me now. You are stronger than that little boy over\r\nthere, and the Company is stronger than a single trader, but the\r\nCompany has its master, the Queen, and will have to obey the laws\r\nas well as all others. We have nothing to do with the Company. We\r\nare here to talk with you about the land, I tell you what we wish\r\nto do for your good, but if you will talk about the Company I\r\ncannot hinder you, I think it is time now you should talk about\r\nwhat concerns you all.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"That is the reason I waited so long. I cannot speak\r\nof anything else, my mind is resting on nothing else I know that\r\nyou will have power and good rules and this is why I am glad to\r\ntell you what is troubling me.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I have told you before and tell you again that\r\nthe Queen cannot and will not undo what she has done. I have told\r\nyou that we will see that the Company shall obey what she has\r\nordered, and get no more and no less than she has promised. We\r\nmight talk here all the year and I could not give you any other\r\nanswer, and I put it to you now face to face--speak to me about\r\nyour message, don't put it aside, if you do the responsibility will\r\nrest upon your nation, and during the winter that is coming, many\r\na poor woman and child will be saying, how was it that our\r\ncouncillors and our braves shut their ears to the mouth of the\r\nQueen's messengers and refused to tell them their words. This\r\nCompany, I have told you is nothing to us, it is nothing to the\r\nQueen, but their rights have to be respected just as much as those\r\nof the meanest child in the country. The Queen will do right\r\nbetween you and them I can say no more than what I have said and\r\nif the Indians will not speak to us we cannot help it, and if the\r\nIndians won't answer our message, we must go back and tell the\r\nQueen that we came here and did everything we could to show the\r\nIndians we were in earnest in proving her love for them and that\r\nwhen there was a little difficulty, I came at once to meet them\r\nhalf way. What prevents you from coming out and speaking openly. I\r\ncannot take away the difficulty you speak of, and if you will not\r\nanswer us, there is no use in talking.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"I told the chief of the soldiers what was in our way,\r\nwhat was troubling us and now we are telling you. It is that I am\r\nworking at.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"What is troubling you?\"\r\n\r\nPIS-QUA (the plain) pointing to Mr. McDonald, of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany--\"You told me you had sold your land for so much money,\r\nL300,000. We want that money.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I wish our Indian brother had spoken before\r\nwhat was in his mind. He has been going here and there, and we\r\nnever knew what he meant. I told you that many years ago the\r\nQueen's father's father gave the Company the right to trade in the\r\ncountry from the frozen ocean to the United States boundary line,\r\nand from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. The Company grew strong\r\nand wanted no one to trade in the country but themselves. The\r\nQueen's people said, \"no, the land is not yours, the Queen's\r\nfather's father gave you rights to trade, it is time those rights\r\nshould stop.\" You may go on and trade like any other merchant, but\r\nas it was worth money to you to say to this trader you shall not\r\nbuy furs at any post, the Queen would not act unjustly to the\r\nCompany. She would not take rights away from them any more than\r\nfrom you; and to settle the question, she took all the lands into\r\nher own hands and gave the Company a sum of money in place of the\r\nrights which she had taken from them. She is ready to deal with you\r\njustly. We are here to-day to make to you her good offers. We have\r\nnothing to hide, nothing to conceal. The Queen acts in daylight. I\r\nthink it is time you are going to talk with us about the offers we\r\nhave made.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"I have made up about no other article. I suppose,\r\nindeed, I would make the thing very little and very small. When I\r\nget back I will think over it.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I have a word to say to you. In our land we\r\nworship the Great Spirit, and do not work on Sunday. I am glad to\r\nsee that you are going back into council, and I will only ask you\r\nto think of these things with single hearts desiring only to do\r\nwhat is right and trusting my words. On Monday morning we will be\r\nglad to meet you here and hope we will find then that your heart\r\nhas come to ours, that you will see that it is for your children's\r\ngood, to take our hands and the promises we have given. As I told\r\nyou before we would be glad to stay longer with you, but we are\r\nobliged to go away. We ask you then to meet us on Monday morning\r\nand Mr. Pratt will tell you so that there may be no mistake as to\r\nwhat we have promised. He has it written down so that it may not be\r\nrubbed out.\"\r\n\r\nThe conference then ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH DAY'S CONFERENCE\r\n\r\nSeptember 14.\r\n\r\nBoth nations, Crees and Saulteaux, having assembled, His Honor\r\nLieut.-Governor Morris again addressed them:--\r\n\r\n\"Children of our Great Mother, I am glad to see you again after\r\nanother day. How have you come to meet us? I hope you have come to\r\nus with good thoughts, and hearts ready to meet ours. I have one or\r\ntwo words to say to you. It is twenty days to-day since we left the\r\nRed River. We want to turn our faces homewards. You told me on\r\nSaturday that some of you could eat a great deal. I have something\r\nto say to you about that. There are Indians who live here, they\r\nhave their wives and children around them. It is good for them to\r\nbe here, and have plenty to eat, but they ought to think of their\r\nbrothers; they ought to think that there are men here who have come\r\nfrom a distance, from Fort Pelly and beyond, whose wives and\r\nchildren are not here to eat, and they want to be at home with\r\nthem. It is time now that we began to understand each other, and\r\nwhen there is something troubles us, I believe in telling it. When\r\nyou told us you were troubled about the situation of this tent, we\r\nhad it moved. Now we want you to take away our trouble, or tell us\r\nwhat you mean. We are troubled about this. We are servants of the\r\nQueen; we have been here many days giving you our message, and we\r\nhave not yet heard the voice of the nations. We have two nations\r\nhere. We have the Crees, who were here first, and we have the\r\nOjibbeways, who came from our country not many suns ago. We find\r\nthem here; we won't say they stole the land and the stones and the\r\ntrees; no, but we will say this, that we believe their brothers,\r\nthe Crees, said to them when they came in here: \"The land is wide,\r\nit is wide, it is big enough for us both; let us live here like\r\nbrothers;\" and that is what you say, as you told us on Saturday, as\r\nto the Half-breeds that I see around. You say that you are one with\r\nthem; now we want all to be one. We know no difference between\r\nCrees and Ojibbeways. Now we want to ask you are you wiser, do you\r\nknow more, than the Ojibbeway people that I met last year? You are\r\na handful compared with them; they came to me from the Lake of the\r\nWoods, from Rainy Lake, from the Kaministiquia, and from the Great\r\nLake. I told them my message, as I have told you; they heard my\r\nwords and they said they were good, and they took my hand and I\r\ngave them mine and the presents; but that is not all. There was a\r\nband of Ojibbeways who lived at Lake Seul, to the north of the Lake\r\nof the Woods, 400 in number, and just before we came away we sent\r\nour messenger to them. He told them I had shaken hands for the\r\nQueen with all the Ojibbeways down to the Great Lake. He told them\r\nwhat we had done for these, and asked them if they found it good to\r\ntake the Queen's hand through our messenger; they were pleased;\r\nthey signed the treaty; they put their names to it, saying, We take\r\nwhat you promised to the other Saulteaux; and our messenger gave\r\nthem the money, just as our messengers will give your brothers who\r\nare not here the money if we understand each other. Now, we ask you\r\nagain, are you wiser than your brothers that I have seen before? I\r\ndo not think that you will say you are, but we want you to take\r\naway our last trouble. What I find strange is this: we are Chiefs;\r\nwe have delivered the message of our great Queen, whose words never\r\nchange, whose tongue and the tongues of whose messengers are never\r\nforked; and how is it that we have not heard any voice back from\r\nthe Crees or Saulteaux, or from their Chiefs? I see before me two\r\nChiefs; we know them to be Chiefs, because we see you put them\r\nbefore you to shake hands with us. They must have been made Chiefs,\r\nnot for anything we are talking about to-day, not for any presents\r\nwe are offering to you, not because of the land; then why are they\r\nchiefs? Because I see they are old men; the winds of many winters\r\nhave whistled through their branches. I think they must have\r\nlearned wisdom; the words of the old are wise; why then, we ask\r\nourselves--and this is our trouble--Why are your Chiefs dumb? They\r\ncan speak. One of them is called \"Loud Voice.\" He must have been\r\nheard in the councils of the nation. Then I ask myself, why do they\r\nnot answer? It cannot be that you are afraid; you are not women. In\r\nthis country, now, no man need be afraid. If a white man does wrong\r\nto an Indian, the Queen will punish them. The other day at Fort\r\nEllice, a white man, it is said, stole some furs from an Indian.\r\nThe Queen's policemen took him at once; sent him down to Red River,\r\nand he is lying in jail now; and if the Indians prove that he did\r\nwrong, he will be punished. You see then that if the white man does\r\nwrong to the Indian he will punished; and it will be the same if\r\nthe Indian does wrong to the white man. The red and white man must\r\nlive together, and be good friends, and the Indians must live\r\ntogether like brothers with each other and the white man. I am\r\nafraid you are weary of my talking. Why do I talk so much? Because\r\nI have only your good at heart. I do not want to go away with my\r\nhead down, to send word to the Queen, \"Your red children could not\r\nsee that your heart was good towards them; could not see as you see\r\nthat it was for the good of themselves and their children's\r\nchildren to accept the good things you mean for them.\" I have done.\r\nLet us hear the voice of the people. Let us hear the voice of your\r\nold wise men.\"\r\n\r\nCOTE--\"The same man that has spoken will speak yet.\"\r\n\r\nKA-KIE-SHE-WAY (Loud Voice)--\"This is the one who will speak; after\r\nhe speaks I will show what I have to say.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"Understand me, what I want to know is, does he\r\nspeak for the nations. If you prefer to speak by the voice of an\r\norator I am glad. All we want is to hear the voice of the people,\r\nand I asked you at first to choose among yourselves those who would\r\nspeak for you; therefore I am glad to hear the man you have chosen,\r\nand I am glad to hear that after he has done the Chief will speak\r\nto us.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"Saturday we met, we spoke to each other, we met at\r\nsuch a time as this time, and again we said we would tell each\r\nother something; now, then, we will report to each other a little\r\nagain. This Company man that we were speaking about, I do not hate\r\nhim; as I loved him before I love him still, and I also want that\r\nthe way he loved me at first he should love me the same; still, I\r\nwish that the Company would keep at his work the same as he did;\r\nthat I want to be signed on the paper. I want you to put it with\r\nyour own hands. After he puts that there it is given to the\r\nIndians, then there will be another article to speak about. The\r\nIndians want the Company to keep at their post and nothing beyond.\r\nAfter that is signed they will talk about something else.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I told you on Saturday that I had nothing to\r\ndo with the Company. The Company have a right to trade. I cannot\r\nmake them buy goods and bring them here, or stop them from bringing\r\nthem. I dare say some of you are traders; you do not ask me whether\r\nyou shall buy goods and sell them again, and I do not stop you. It\r\nis the same way with the Company. If they make money in bringing\r\ngoods here they will bring them just as they used to do; and I want\r\nyou to understand it fully, the Company may have a little more\r\nmoney than the white traders, or the Half-breeds, or the Indians,\r\nbut they have no more right, they have no more privileges, to trade\r\nthan the Indians, or the Half-breeds, or the whites; and that is\r\nwritten with a higher hand than ours, and we have no power to write\r\nanything, or to add anything, to what is written and remains in the\r\nQueen's house beyond the sea.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"I do not want to drive the Company anywhere. What I\r\nsaid is, that they are to remain here at their house. Supposing you\r\nwanted to take them away, I would not let them go. I want them to\r\nremain here to have nothing but the trade. I do not hate them; we\r\nalways exchange with them, and would die if they went away.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I do not know whether we rightly understand or\r\nnot. I think you have spoken wise words; the Company helps you to\r\nlive, and they have a right to sell goods as other traders. I do\r\nnot know that I understand you rightly, that you do not want them\r\nto sell goods anywhere except at the posts; to keep at their posts\r\nthere. If that is what you mean, I cannot say yes to that; they\r\nhave the same right to sell goods anywhere that you have. They are\r\nno longer as they were once. The Government of the country, I think\r\nI told you that before--understand me distinctly--the Government\r\nhave nothing to do with the Company, but the Company and all their\r\nservants are subjects of the Queen and love and obey her laws. The\r\nday has gone past when they made the laws. They have to hear the\r\nlaws the Queen makes, and like good subjects submit to them.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"The Company is not to carry anything out into the\r\ncountry, but are to trade in the Fort. That is what we want signed\r\non the paper; then we will talk on other subjects.\" LIEUT.-GOV.\r\nMORRIS--\"I have told you before, and I tell you again, that the\r\nCompany as traders have the right to sell goods anywhere they\r\nplease, just as you have, just as the whites have, just as the\r\nHalf-breeds have, and we have no power to take it away from them.\r\nIf the Company were to ask me to say to you that you were not to\r\ntrade anywhere except in their Fort by the lake, you would think it\r\nvery hard, and I would say to the Company, No, you shall not\r\ninterfere with the Indians throughout our land. I would like to\r\ngive you pleasure but I cannot do wrong; we won't deceive you with\r\nsmooth words. We will tell you the simple truth what we can do and\r\nwhat we cannot do, but we cannot interfere as you ask us.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"Cannot you sign such a paper?\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"No; the Queen has signed the great paper, and\r\nthe Company have no more rights than any one else, but they have\r\nthe same.\"\r\n\r\nKA-KIE-SHE-WAY (Loud Voice)--\"I would not be at a loss, but I am,\r\nbecause we are not united--the Crees and the Saulteaux--this is\r\ntroubling me. I am trying to bring all together in one mind, and\r\nthis is delaying us. If we could put that in order, if we were all\r\njoined together and everything was right I would like it, I would\r\nlike to part well satisfied and pleased. I hear that His Excellency\r\nis unwell, and I wish that everything would be easy in his mind. It\r\nis this that annoys me, that things do not come together. I wish\r\nfor one day more, and after that there would not be much in my\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nCOTE--\"You wanted me to come here and I came here. I find nothing,\r\nand I do not think anything will go right. I know what you want; I\r\ncannot speak of anything here concerning my own land until I go to\r\nmy own land. Whenever you desire to see me I will tell you what you\r\nare asking me here. Now I want to return.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"We asked the Chief to come here. He has as much\r\nright to be here as another Indian. We cannot go there and ask the\r\npeople of the two great tribes to meet in one place as they have\r\ndone when they were asked to meet us. You have had many days to talk\r\ntogether. If the Saulteaux are determined that they want an agreement\r\nto prevent the Company from trading, it cannot be given. I think the\r\nChief here spoke wisely. He says he is in trouble because you do not\r\nunderstand each other. Why are you not of one mind? Have you tried to\r\nbe of one mind? Must we go back and say we have had you here so many\r\ndays, and that you had not the minds of men--that you were not able\r\nto understand each other? Must we go back and tell the Queen that we\r\nheld out our hands for her, and her red children put them back again?\r\nIf that be the message that your conduct to-day is going to make us\r\ncarry back, I am sorry for you, and fear it will be a long day before\r\nyou again see the Queen's Councillors here to try to do you good.\r\nThe Queen and her Councillors may think that you do not want to be\r\nfriends, that you do not want your little ones to be taught, that you\r\ndo not want when the food is getting scarce to have a hand in yours\r\nstronger than yours to help you. Surely you will think again before\r\nyou turn your backs on the offers; you will not let so little a\r\nquestion as this about the Company, without whom you tell me you\r\ncould not live, stop the good we mean to do. I hope that I am\r\nperfectly understood; when we asked the chief here we wanted to speak\r\nwith him about his lands at his place; when we asked \"Loud Voice\"\r\nhere we wanted to speak with him about the land at his place; so when\r\nwe asked the other chiefs here we wanted to speak with them about the\r\nlands at their places. Why? because we did not want to do anything\r\nthat you would not all know about, that there might be no bad\r\nfeelings amongst you. We wanted you to be of one mind and heart in\r\nthis matter, and that is the reason you are here to-day. Now it rests\r\nwith you; we have done all we could. Have you anything more to say to\r\nus, or are we to turn our backs upon you, and go away with sorry\r\nhearts for you and your children? It remains for you to say.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBLER--\"We do not understand you and what you are talking\r\nabout. I do not keep it from you; we have not chosen our Chiefs; we\r\nhave not appointed our soldiers and councillors; we have not looked\r\naround us yet, and chosen our land, which I understand you to\r\ntell us to choose. We do not want to play with you, but we cannot\r\nappoint our Chiefs and head men quickly; that is in the way. Now it\r\nis near mid-day, and we cannot appoint our Chiefs. This Chief who\r\ngot up last--the Queen's name was used when he was appointed to be\r\nChief--he wants to know where his land is to be and see it, what\r\nlike it is to be, and to find the number of his children; that is\r\nwhat is in his mind. He says he came from afar, he had a good mind\r\nfor coming, and he takes the same good mind away with him. I have\r\nnot heard him say to the Saulteaux to keep back their land.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I think I understand you. We do not want to\r\nseparate in bad feeling, or to avoid any trouble in coming to an\r\nunderstanding with you; because I do not believe that if we do not\r\nagree it will ever be my good fortune to endeavor to do so again.\r\n\"Loud Voice,\" the Chief, has told us he wants a day to think it\r\nover. The Chief \"Cote,\" from the north, would like to go home, but\r\nI am sure he will stop a day and try to understand his brothers,\r\nand agree as the others did at the Lake of the Woods. I put my\r\nname, and the Chiefs and the head men put theirs, and I gave the\r\nChief a copy, and I told him when I went home to Red River I would\r\nhave it all written out, a true copy made on skin, that could not\r\nbe rubbed out, that I would send a copy to his people so that\r\nwhen we were dead and gone the letter would be there to speak for\r\nitself, to show everything that was promised; and that was the\r\nright way to do. I did so, and sent a copy of the treaty written\r\nin letters of blue, gold, and black to the Chief \"Maw-do-pe-nais,\"\r\nwhom the people had told to keep it for them. He who speaks for the\r\nSaulteaux tells us they have not made up their minds yet about the\r\nland--he tells us they have not decided to refuse our hands. I am\r\nglad to hear him say that, and if it will please my Indian brethren\r\nhere we will be glad to wait another day and meet them here\r\nto-morrow morning, if they will promise me with the words of men\r\nthat they will look this matter straight in the face; that they\r\nwill lay aside every feeling except the good of their people, and\r\ntry to see what is right, and that they will come back and say, 'We\r\nhave done our best, we have tried to be of one mind, and considered\r\nwhat was best for now, and to-morrow, and the years that are to\r\ncome when we have all passed away. This is our answer. We are very\r\nmuch in earnest about this matter.' The Chief said I was not very\r\nwell, yet I am here. Why? Because the duty was laid upon me I was\r\nafraid of the journey, but when a Chief has a duty to do he tries\r\nto do it, and I felt that if I could do you any good, as I believed\r\nI could, I ought to be here. I tell you this, trust my words, they\r\ncome from the heart of one who loves the Indian people, and who is\r\ncharged by his Queen to tell them the words of truth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH DAY'S CONFERENCE\r\n\r\nThe Crees having come and shaken hands, His Honor Lieut.-Gov.\r\nMorris rose and said:\r\n\r\n\"My friends, I have talked much; I would like to hear your voices,\r\nI would like to hear what you say.\"\r\n\r\nKA-KU-ISH-MAY, (Loud Voice--a principal chief of the Crees)--\"I am\r\nvery much pleased with that, to listen to my friends, for certainly\r\nit is good to report to each other what is for the benefit of each\r\nother. We see the good you wish to show us. If you like what we lay\r\nbefore you we will like it too. Let us join together and make the\r\nTreaty; when both join together it is very good.\"\r\n\r\nThe Saulteaux arrived at this juncture, when the Lieut.-Governor\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"I will say to the two tribes what I said to the Crees before the\r\nSaulteaux came. You have heard my voice for many days, you know its\r\nsound. You have looked in my face, you have seen my mind through my\r\nface, and you know my words are true and that they do not change.\r\nBut I am not here to talk to-day, I am here to listen. You have had\r\nour message, you have had the Queen's words. It is time now that\r\nyou spoke. I am here to listen, my ears are open. It is for you to\r\nspeak.\"\r\n\r\nKAMOOSES--\"Brothers, I have one word and a small one, that is the\r\nreason I cannot finish anything that is large. You do not see the\r\nwhole number of my tribe which is away at my back, that is the\r\nreason I am so slow in making ready.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I want to hear the voice of those who are\r\nhere, they can speak for themselves and for those who are away.\"\r\n\r\nCHE-E-KUK (the Worthy One)--\"My ears are open to what you say. Just\r\nnow the Great Spirit is watching over us; it is good. He who has\r\nstrength and power is overlooking our doings. I want very much to\r\nbe good in what we are going to talk about, and our Chiefs will\r\ntake you by the hand just now.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chiefs now rose and shook hands with the Commissioners.\r\n\r\nKA-HA-OO-KUS-KA-TOO (he who walks on four claws)--\"It is very good\r\nto meet together on a fine day, father. When my father used to\r\nbring me anything I used to go and meet him, and when my father had\r\ngiven it to me I gave it to my mother to cook it. When we come to\r\njoin together one half at least will come.\"\r\n\r\nCHE-E-KUK (the Worthy)--\"Now I am going to tell you, and you say\r\nyour ears are open. You see the Qu'Appelle Lake Indians that you\r\nwished to see, you hear me speak but there are many far away, and\r\nthat is the reason I cannot speak for these my children who are\r\naway trying to get something to eat; the Crees my child is not\r\nhere, the Saulteaux my child is not here, the Young Dogs are not\r\nhere, the Stonies my children are not here, this is not the number\r\nthat you see; I am only telling you this, I think I have opened my\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I know you are not all here. We never could\r\nget you all together, but you know what is good for you and for\r\nyour children. When I met the Saulteaux last year we had not 4,000\r\nthere, but there were men like you who knew what was good for\r\nthemselves, for their wives, for their children, and those not\r\nborn. I give to those who were there, and they took my hand and\r\ntook what was in it, and I sent to those who were away, and I did\r\nfor them just as I did for those who were present. It is the same\r\nto-day. What we are ready to give you will be given to those who\r\nare not here. What is good for you, what you think will be good for\r\nyou will be good for them. It is for you to say, not for us; we\r\nhave done all that men who love their red brothers can do, it is\r\nfor you now to act, on you rests the duty of saying whether you\r\nbelieve our message or not, whether you want the Queen to help you\r\nor not, whether or not you will go away and let the days and the\r\nyears go on, and let the food grow scarcer, and let your children\r\ngrow up and do nothing to keep off the hunger and the cold that is\r\nbefore them. It is for you to say that, not for us; if we had not\r\nyour good at heart we would not have been here, and we would not\r\nhave labored these many days, if our hearts were not warm towards\r\nyou, and if we did not believe what we are doing, would be for your\r\ngood as children of our Queen. I have said all.\"\r\n\r\nKAN-OO-SES--\"Is it true you are bringing the Queen's kindness? Is\r\nit true you are bringing the Queen's messenger's kindness? Is it\r\ntrue you are going to give my child what he may use? Is it true you\r\nare going to give the different bands the Queen's kindness? Is it\r\ntrue that you bring the Queen's hand? Is it true you are bringing\r\nthe Queen's power?\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"Yes, to those who are here and those who are\r\nabsent, such as she has given us.\"\r\n\r\nKAMOOSES--\"Is it true that my child will not be troubled for what\r\nyou are bringing him?\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"The Queen's power will be around him.\"\r\n\r\nKAMOOSES--\"Now, I am going to ask you that the debt that has been\r\nlying in the Company's store, I want that to be wiped out. I ask it\r\nfrom the great men of the Queen.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I told you before we have nothing to do with\r\nthe Company, we have nothing to do with its debts. I have told you\r\nwhat we will do for you, what the Queen will do for you forever.\r\nBut the money that the Indian owes the Company is just like the\r\nmoney that the Indians owe to each other or to any trader and is\r\nnot due to the Queen. We have no power to put money in your hands\r\nand your children's to pay your debts, and it would not be right\r\nfor the Queen to come in and take away either what is between you\r\nand the Company, or what is between you and the traders, or what\r\nis between you and each other. If one of you owes the Chief is it\r\nright that the Queen should wipe it out? I would be very glad if we\r\nhad it in our power to wipe out your debts, but it is not in our\r\npower. All we can do is to put money in your hands and promise to\r\nput money in the hands of those who are away, and give you money\r\nevery year afterwards, and help you to make a living when the food\r\nis scarce. I have told you from the first that whether my words\r\nplease you or not I will tell you only the truth, and I will only\r\nspeak as far as the Queen has given us power.\"\r\n\r\n(He who walks on four claws)--\"Whenever you give to these my\r\nchildren what they desire, then you will get what you want.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"We will give them what we have power to give.\r\nWe are ready to hear.\"\r\n\r\nKAMOOSES--\"Yes, I understand and my heart also, but it is not\r\nlarge, it is small, and my understanding is small; that is the word\r\nI tell you.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I have told you what we are ready to do for\r\nyou. Your understanding is large enough to know what is good for\r\nyou. We have talked these many days, and I ask you now to talk\r\nstraight, to tell me your mind, to tell me whether you wish to take\r\nour offers or not, it is for you to say.\"\r\n\r\nKEE-E-KUK--\"Twenty dollars we want to be put in our hand every\r\nyear, this we have heard from the others. Twenty-five dollars to\r\neach chief.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"If I understand you aright you are mistaken.\r\nThe Saulteaux did not get twenty-five dollars per head. They get\r\nfive dollars every year. We promised them five dollars every year,\r\nand a messenger was sent this year to pay them that sum. I may tell\r\nyou that my children at the Lake of the Woods had big hearts to\r\nask. You say you have small. I told them that if the Queen gave\r\nthem all they asked I would have to ask her to allow me to become\r\nan Indian, but I told them I could not give them what they asked,\r\nand when they understood that, and understood the full breadth and\r\nwidth of the Queen's goodness, they took what I offered, and I\r\nthink if you are wise you will do the same.\"\r\n\r\n(A proposition was made here by an Indian that they should receive\r\nfive dollars per head every second year for fifty years, but he\r\nmust have done so without authority as it was not acceded to by the\r\nother Indians who expressed their dissent strongly as soon as the\r\noffer was made.)\r\n\r\nKAMOOSES--\"I am going to speak for Loud Voice and for the other\r\nchiefs. Some chiefs are not here, they are absent, hereafter you\r\nwill see them. I myself will tell them, and my child that is at my\r\nback will tell them also. Will you receive that which I am asking?\r\nI want to clear up what the Indians and I want to try and put it\r\nright, what my child will say. Well, can you give me that. We want\r\nthe same Treaty you have given to the North-West Angle. This I am\r\nasking for.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"Who are you speaking for? Is it for the whole\r\nof the Indians? (They expressed their assent.) Are you ready to\r\ncarry it out? (They again assented.) Are your chiefs ready to sign\r\nthis afternoon if we grant you these terms? (The Indians assented\r\nunanimously.) It is now after twelve, we will speak to you this\r\nafternoon.\"\r\n\r\nThe Conference here ended to allow the Commissioners time to\r\nconsult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTERNOON CONFERENCE\r\n\r\nThe Indians having assembled, presented the Chiefs, whose names\r\nappear on the Treaty to the Commissioners as their Chiefs.\r\n\r\nKAMOOSES--\"To-day we are met together here and our minds are open.\r\nWe want to know the terms of the North-West Angle Treaty.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"Do we understand that you want the same terms\r\nwhich were given at the Lake of the Woods (The Indians assented.) I\r\nhave the Treaty here in a book. You must know that the steamboats\r\nhad been running through their waters, and our soldiers had been\r\nmarching through their country, and for that reason we offered the\r\nOjibbeways a larger sum than we offered you. Last year it was a\r\npresent, covering five years; with you it was a present for this\r\nyear only. I paid the Indians there a present in money down of\r\ntwelve dollars per head. I have told you why we offered you less,\r\nand you will see there were reasons for it. That is the greatest\r\ndifference between what we offered you and what was paid them, but\r\non the other hand there were some things promised you that were not\r\ngiven at the Lake of the Woods. (His Honor then explained the terms\r\ngranted in that Treaty.) We promised there that the Queen would\r\nspend $1,500 per year to buy shot and powder, ball and twine. There\r\nwere 4,000 of them. I offered you $1,000 although you are only\r\none-half the number, as I do not think you number more than 2,000.\r\nYour proportionate share would be $750 which you shall receive.\r\nThen at the Lake of the Woods each Chief had their head men; we\r\nhave said you would have four who shall have fifteen dollars each\r\nper year, and as at the Lake of the Woods each Chief and head man\r\nwill receive a suit of clothing once in three years, and each Chief\r\non signing the treaty will receive a medal and the promise of a\r\nflag. We cannot give you the flag now, as there were none to be\r\nbought at Red River, but we have the medals here. Now I have told\r\nyou the terms we gave at the North-West Angle of the Lake of the\r\nWoods, and you will see that the only difference of any consequence\r\nbetween there and what we offered you is in the money payment that\r\nwe give as a present, and I have told you why we made the\r\ndifference, and you will see that it was just. We had to speak with\r\nthem for four years that had gone away. We speak to you only for\r\nfour days. It was not that we came in the spirit of traders, but\r\nbecause we were trying to do what was just between you and the\r\nQueen, and the other Indians who would say that we had treated you\r\nbetter than we had treated them because we put the children of this\r\nyear on the same footing as these children through whose land we\r\nhad been passing and running our steamboats for four years. You see\r\nwhen you ask us to tell you everything, we show you all that has\r\nbeen done, and I have to tell you again that the Ojibbeways at Lake\r\nSeul who number 400, when I sent a messenger this spring with a\r\ncopy of those terms made at the North-West Angle with their nation,\r\ntook the Queen's hand by my messenger and made the same treaty. I\r\nthink I have told you all you want to know, and our ears are open\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nKAMOOSES--\"I want to put it a little light for all my children\r\naround me, something more on the top. For my chief thirty dollars,\r\nfor my four chief head men twenty dollars, and each of my young\r\nchildren fifteen dollars a year.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I am afraid you are not talking to us\r\nstraight; when we went away you asked us to give you the terms\r\ngiven at the Lake of the Woods; you asked to know what they were,\r\nand the moment I told you, you ask three times as much for your\r\nchildren as I gave them. That would not be right; and it is well\r\nthat you should know that we have not power to do so; we can give\r\nyou no more than we gave them. We hope you are satisfied. I have\r\none word more to say, we are in the last hours of the day you asked\r\nus for and we must leave you. The utmost we can do, the furthest we\r\ncan go or that we ought to go is, to do what you asked, to give you\r\nthe terms granted last year at the Lake of the Woods. We can do no\r\nmore, and you have our last words. It is for you to say whether you\r\nare satisfied or not.\"\r\n\r\nKAMOOSES--\"We ask that we may have cattle.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"We offered you cattle on the first day, we\r\noffered your Chief cattle for the use of his band--not for himself,\r\nbut for the use of his band; we gave the same at the Lake of the\r\nWoods. We can give no more here.\"\r\n\r\nKAMOOSES--\"We want some food to take us home.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"When you sign the treaty, provisions will be\r\ngiven to take you home. Now I ask you, are you ready to accept the\r\noffer, the last offer we can make, you will see we have put you on\r\nthe same footing as the Indians at the Lake of the Woods, and we\r\nthink it is more than we ought to give, but rather than not close\r\nthe matter we have given it, we have talked long enough about this.\r\nIt is time we did something. Now I would ask, are the Crees and the\r\nSaulteaux and the other Indians ready to make the treaty with us.\r\nSince we went away we have had the treaty written out, and we are\r\nready to have it signed, and we will leave a copy with any Chief\r\nyou may select and after we leave we will have a copy written out\r\non skin that cannot be rubbed out and put up in a tin box, so that\r\nit cannot be wet, so that you can keep it among yourselves so that\r\nwhen we are dead our children will know what was written.\"\r\n\r\nKAMOOSES--\"Yes, we want each Chief to have a copy of the treaty, we\r\nask that the Half-breeds may have the right of hunting.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"We will send a copy to each Chief. As to the\r\nHalf-breeds, you need not be afraid; the Queen will deal justly,\r\nfairly and generously with all her children.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chiefs then signed the treaty, after having been assured that\r\nthey would never be made ashamed of what they then did.\r\n\r\nOne of the Chiefs on being asked to do so signed; the second called\r\non said he was promised the money when he signed, and returned to\r\nhis seat without doing so. The Lieutenant-Governor called him\r\nforward--held out his hand to him and said, take my hand; it holds\r\nthe money. If you can trust us forever you can do so for half an\r\nhour; sign the treaty. The Chief took the Governor's hands and\r\ntouched the pen, and the others followed. As soon as the treaty was\r\nsigned the Governor expressed the satisfaction of the Commissioners\r\nwith the Indians, and said that Mr. Christie and Mr. Dickieson, the\r\nPrivate Secretary of the Minister of the Interior, were ready to\r\nadvance the money presents, but the Indians requested that the\r\npayment should be postponed till next morning, which was acceded\r\nto. The Chiefs then formally approached the Commissioners and shook\r\nhands with them, after which the conference adjourned, the\r\nCommissioners leaving the place of meeting under escort of the\r\ncommand of Lieut.-Col. Smith, who had been in daily attendance.\r\n\r\nReport of the interview at Fort Ellice between the Indian\r\nCommissioners and certain Saulteaux Indians not present at\r\nQu'Appelle, and not included in Treaty Number Two, the Chief being\r\nWay-wa-se-ca-pow, or \"the Man proud of standing upright:\"\r\n\r\nLieut.-Governor Morris said he had been here before, and since that\r\ntime he had met the Crees and Saulteaux nations, and had made a\r\ntreaty with them. The Indians there were from Fort Pelly and as far\r\ndistant as the Cypress Hills. He wished to know the number of the\r\nSaulteaux to be found in this locality.\r\n\r\nThe Chief said there were about thirty tents who were not at\r\nQu'Appelle, and ten who were there.\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"The Commissioners here are representing the\r\nQueen. I made a treaty with the Saulteaux last year at the Lake of\r\nthe Woods. They were not a little handful; but there were 4,000 of\r\nthem--and now we have made a treaty with the Crees and Saulteaux at\r\nQu'Appelle. There is not much need to say much--it is good for the\r\nIndians to make treaties with the Queen--good for them and their\r\nwives and children. Game is getting scarce and the Queen is willing\r\nto help her children. Now we are ready to give you what we gave the\r\nSaulteaux at the Lake of the Woods and the Saulteaux and Crees at\r\nQu'Appelle. It will be for you to say whether you will accept it or\r\nnot.\" His Honor then explained the treaty to them.\r\n\r\n\"What we offer will be for your good, as it will help you, and not\r\nprevent you from hunting.\r\n\r\n\"We are not traders. I have told you all we can do and all we will\r\ndo. It is for you to say whether you will accept my hand or not. I\r\ncannot wait long. I think you are not wiser than your brothers. Our\r\nears are open, you can speak to us.\"\r\n\r\nLONG CLAWS--\"My father--I shake hands with you, I shake hands with\r\nthe Queen.\"\r\n\r\nSHAPONETUNG'S FIRST SON--\"I find what was done at Qu'Appelle was\r\ngood, does it take in all my children?\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nSHAPONETUNG'S FIRST SON--\"I thank you for coming and bringing what\r\nis good for our children.\"\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I forgot to say that we will be able to give\r\nyou a small present, some powder and shot, blankets and calicoes.\r\nEach band must have a Chief and four headmen, but you are not all\r\nhere to-day. I want to-day to know the Chief and two headmen.\r\n\r\n\"Now I want to know will you take my hand and what is in it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians came up and shook hands in token of acceptance.\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS--\"I am glad to shake hands with you; the white\r\nman and the red man have shaken hands and are friends. You must be\r\ngood subjects to the Queen and obey her laws.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians introduced as their Chief, Way-wa-se-ca-pow; and as\r\ntheir headmen, Ota-ma-koo-euin and Shaponetung's first son.\r\n\r\nHis Honor then explained the memorandum to them, when it was\r\nsigned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE REVISION OF TREATIES NUMBERS ONE AND TWO\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Treaties, Numbers One and Two, were made, certain verbal\r\npromises were unfortunately made to the Indians, which were not\r\nincluded in the written text of the treaties, nor recognized\r\nor referred to, when these Treaties were ratified by the Privy\r\nCouncil. This, naturally, led to misunderstanding with the Indians,\r\nand to widespread dissatisfaction among them. This state of matters\r\nwas reported to the Council by the successive Lieut.-Governors\r\nof Manitoba, and by the Superintendent of Indian Affairs. On\r\nexamination of the original Treaty Number One, the Minister of the\r\nInterior reported that a memorandum was found attached to it signed\r\nby Mr. Commissioner Simpson, His Hon. Governor Archibald, Mr.\r\nSt. John and the Hon. Mr. McKay, purporting to contain their\r\nunderstanding of the terms upon which the Indians concluded the\r\ntreaty. This memorandum was as follows:\r\n\r\nMemorandum of things outside of the Treaty which were promised at\r\nthe Treaty at the Lower Fort, signed the 3rd day of August, A.D.\r\n1871.\r\n\r\nFor each Chief that signed the treaty, a dress distinguishing him\r\nas Chief.\r\n\r\nFor braves and for councillors of each Chief, a dress: it being\r\nsupposed that the braves and councillors will be two for each\r\nChief.\r\n\r\nFor each Chief, except Yellow Quill, a buggy.\r\n\r\nFor the braves and councillors of each Chief, except Yellow Quill,\r\na buggy.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of a yoke of oxen for each reserve, a bull for each, and a\r\ncow for each Chief; a boar for each reserve, and a sow for each\r\nChief, and a male and female of each kind of animal raised by\r\nfarmers; these when the Indians are prepared to receive them.\r\n\r\nA plow and a harrow for each settler cultivating the ground.\r\n\r\nThese animals and their issue to be Government property, but to be\r\nallowed for the use of the Indians, under the superintendence and\r\ncontrol of the Indian Commissioner.\r\n\r\nThe buggies to be the property of the Indians to whom they are\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe above contains an inventory of the terms concluded with the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n               WEMYSS M. SIMPSON,\r\n               MOLYNEUX ST. JOHN,\r\n               A. G. ARCHIBALD,\r\n               JAS. McKAY.\r\n\r\nThe Privy Council, by Order in Council, agreed to consider this\r\nmemorandum as part of the original treaties, and instructed the\r\nIndian Commissioner to carry out the promises therein contained,\r\nwhich had not been implemented. They also agreed to offer to raise\r\nthe annuities from three to five dollars per head, to pay a further\r\nannual sum of twenty dollars to each chief, and to give a suit of\r\nclothing every three years to each chief and head man, allowing\r\nfour head men to each band, upon the distinct understanding\r\nhowever, that any Indian accepting the increased payment, thereby\r\nformally abandoned all claims against the Government, in connection\r\nwith the verbal promises of the Commissioners, other than those\r\nrecognized by the treaty and the memorandum above referred to.\r\n\r\nThe Government then invited Lieut.-Gov. Morris, in conjunction with\r\nthe Indian Commissioner, Lieut.-Col. Provencher, to visit the\r\nseveral bands interested in the treaties, with a view to submit to\r\nthem the new terms, and obtain their acceptance of the proposed\r\nrevision of the treaties. His Honor accordingly placed his\r\nservices at the disposal of the Government, and was at his request\r\naccompanied by the Hon. Mr. McKay, who had been present at the\r\nmaking of the original treaties, and was well versed in the Indian\r\ntongues. In October 1875, these gentlemen entered upon the task\r\nconfided to them, and first proceeded to meet the large and\r\nimportant band of St. Peters, in the Province of Manitoba. The\r\nmatter was fully discussed with the Indians, the Order in Council,\r\nand memorandum read and explained to them, and their written assent\r\nto the new terms obtained. After their return from St. Peters,\r\nowing to the advanced season of the year, it was decided to\r\ndivide the work, the Lieutenant-Governor requesting the Indian\r\nCommissioner to proceed to Fort Alexander on Lake Winnipeg, and to\r\nthe Broken Head and Roseau Rivers, while Messrs. Morris and McKay,\r\nwould undertake to meet the Indians included in Treaty Number Two\r\nat Manitoba House on Lake Manitoba. Colonel Provencher met the\r\nIndians at the places above mentioned, and obtained the assent of\r\nthe Indians of the three bands to the revised treaty. Messrs.\r\nMorris and McKay proceeded by carriage to Lake Manitoba, and thence\r\nin a sail boat, where they met the Indians of the six bands of\r\nTreaty Number Two, and after full discussion, the Indians cordially\r\naccepted the new terms, and thus was pleasantly and agreeably\r\nclosed, with all the bands of Treaties One and Two, except that of\r\nthe Portage band, who were not summoned to any of the conferences,\r\na fruitful source of dissension and difficulty. The experience\r\nderived from this misunderstanding, proved however, of benefit with\r\nregard to all the treaties, subsequent to Treaties One and Two, as\r\nthe greatest care was thereafter taken to have all promises fully\r\nset out in the treaties, and to have the treaties thoroughly and\r\nfully explained to the Indians, and understood by them to contain\r\nthe whole agreement between them and the Crown. The arrangement,\r\nhowever, of the matter with the Portage band was one of more\r\ndifficulty. This band had always been troublesome. In 1870, they\r\nhad warned off settlers and Governor MacTavish of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany had been obliged to send the Hon. James McKay to make\r\nterms for three years with them for the admission of settlers. In\r\n1874, they twice sent messengers with tobacco (the usual Indian\r\ncredentials for such messengers) to Qu'Appelle to prevent the\r\nmaking of the treaty there. Besides the claims to the outside\r\npromises, preferred by the other Indians, they had an additional\r\ngrievance, which they pressed with much pertinacity. To obtain\r\ntheir adhesion to Treaty Number One, the Commissioners had given\r\nthem preferential terms in respect to their reserve, and the\r\nwording in the treaty of these terms enhanced the difficulty. The\r\nlanguage used was as follows: \"And for the use of the Indians of\r\nwhom Oo-za-we-kwun is Chief, so much land on the south and east\r\nside of the Assiniboine, as will furnish one hundred and sixty\r\nacres for each family of five, or in that proportion for larger or\r\nsmaller families, reserving also a further tract enclosing said\r\nreserve, to contain an equivalent to twenty-five square miles of\r\nequal breadth, to be laid out around the reserve.\" The enclosure\r\naround the homestead reserve led to extravagant demands by them.\r\nThey did not understand its extent, and claimed nearly half of the\r\nProvince of Manitoba under it.\r\n\r\nThe Indians constantly interviewed the Lieutenant-Governor on\r\nthe subject, and when the Hon. Mr. Laird, then Minister of the\r\nInterior, visited Manitoba, they twice pressed their demands upon\r\nhim. The Government requested the Hon. Messrs. Morris and McKay to\r\nendeavor to settle the long pending dispute, and they proceeded to\r\nthe Round Plain on the river Assiniboine with that view. They met\r\nthe Indians, some five hundred in number, but without result. The\r\nIndians were divided among themselves. A portion of the band had\r\nforsaken Chief Yellow Quill and wished the recognition of the Great\r\nBear, grandson of Pee-qual-kee-quash, a former chief of the band.\r\nThe Yellow Quill band wanted the reserve assigned in one locality;\r\nthe adherents of the Bear said that place was unsuited for farming,\r\nand they wished it to be placed at the Round Plain, where they had\r\nalready commenced a settlement. The land to which they were\r\nentitled under the treaty was 34,000 acres, but their demands were\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Yellow Quill was apprehensive of his own followers,\r\nand besides the danger of collision between the two sections was\r\nimminent. The Commissioners finally intimated to the band that they\r\nwould do nothing with them that year, but would make the customary\r\npayment of the annuities under the original treaty and leave them\r\ntill next year to make up their minds as to accepting the new\r\nterms, to which the Indians agreed.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, the Government again requested Mr. Morris to meet these\r\nIndians and endeavor to arrange the long pending dispute with them,\r\nand in July he travelled to the Long Plain on the Assiniboine with\r\nthat object in view. He had previously summoned the band to meet\r\nthere, and had also summoned a portion of the band known as the\r\nWhite Mud River Indians, dwelling on the shores of Lake Manitoba,\r\nwho were nominally under the chieftainship of Yellow Quill, and\r\nwere, as such, entitled to a portion of the original reserve, but\r\ndid not recognize the Chief. Mr. Morris was accompanied by Mr.\r\nGraham, of the Indian Department, Secretary and Paymaster. On\r\narrival at his destination, the Lieutenant-Governor found the\r\nIndians assembled, but in three camps. Those adhering to Yellow\r\nQuill, the Bear, and the White Mud River Indians, being located\r\non different parts of the plains, Mr. Reid, Surveyor, was also\r\npresent, to explain the extent and exact dimensions of the proposed\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Indians were assembled, and the conference lasted\r\nfor two days. The Yellow Quill band were still obstructive, but the\r\nother two sections were disposed to accept the terms. The question\r\nof the reserve was the main difficulty. The Yellow Quill band still\r\ndesired a reserve for the whole. The others wished to remain, the\r\nBear's party at the Round Plain, and the White Mud River Indians at\r\nLake Manitoba, where they resided and had houses and farms. In the\r\ninterval from the previous year, the Bear's band had built several\r\nhouses, and made enclosures for farming. Eventually, the Indians\r\nwere made to comprehend the extent of land they were really\r\nentitled to, but the Governor intimated that the land was for all,\r\nand that he would divide the band into three, each with a Chief\r\nand councillors, and that he would give each band a portion of the\r\nwhole number of acres, proportionate to their numbers--the Bear at\r\nthe Round Plain, the White Mud Indians at their place of residence,\r\nand the Yellow Quill band wherever they might select, in unoccupied\r\nterritory. After long consultations among themselves the Indians\r\naccepted the proposal. The Bear was recognized as a Chief, and a\r\nChief selected by the White Mud River band was accepted as such.\r\n\r\nThe Indians also agreed to accept the revised terms of Treaty\r\nNumber One, and an agreement in accordance with the understanding\r\nwas prepared and signed by the Lieutenant-Governor, and the Chief\r\nand head men. The Indians preferred a request to receive the two\r\ndollars, increased amount, which, as they said, \"had slipped\r\nthrough their fingers last year,\" which was granted, and also that\r\nthe councillors should be paid yearly, as in the other treaties,\r\nsubsequently made. This the Governor promised to recommend, and it\r\nwas eventually granted, being made applicable to all the bands in\r\nTreaties Numbers One and Two.\r\n\r\nThus was so far closed, a controversy which had lasted for\r\nsome years, and had been fruitful of unpleasant feelings, the\r\nnegotiations terminating in that result having been from a variety\r\nof causes more difficult to bring to a satisfactory solution than\r\nthe actual making of treaties, for the acquisition of large extents\r\nof territory. On the leaving of the Lieutenant-Governor, the\r\nmorning after the conclusion of the arrangement, the Indians\r\nassembled and gave three cheers for the Queen and Governor, and\r\nfired a feu de joie. Mr. Reid at once proceeded to set aside the\r\nreserves for the Bear and White Mud bands, but the selection of a\r\nreserve by the Yellow Quill band was attended with still further\r\nfurther difficulty, although it was eventually pointed out by them,\r\nand surveyed by Mr. Reid, it being in a very desirable locality.\r\nThe despatches of the Lieutenant-Governor to the Minister of the\r\nInterior, giving an account in full of the negotiations for the\r\nrevision of the Treaties Numbers One and Two, will complete this\r\nrecord, and will be found to give a clear narrative of them. These\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n                   GOVERNMENT HOUSE,\r\n             FORT GARRY, MANITOBA, 5th October, 1875.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to inform you that in pursuance of your\r\nrequest that I should meet the Indians of Treaties Numbers One\r\nand Two, with a view to a revision of the terms thereof, and\r\nan adjustment of the disputed questions connected therewith,\r\nI proceeded to the St. Peter Reserve on the 5th of August and\r\nencamped near the Indian tents.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th I met Chief Prince and his band, being accompanied by\r\nthe Hon. James McKay, who at my request gave me the benefit of\r\nhis valuable services, and by Mr. Provencher. I explained to the\r\nIndians the terms offered to them by the Government, and obtained\r\ntheir written assent thereto, endorsed on a parchment copy of the\r\nOrder in Council of date the 30th April, 1875. As however there\r\nare in the bands of Treaties Numbers One and Two, four councillors,\r\ni.e., head men, and two braves, we were under the necessity of\r\nagreeing that they should continue at that number, instead of two,\r\nas specified in the report of the Privy Council. We then brought\r\nbefore them your request that the portion of the reserve embraced\r\nin the proposed new town near the Pacific Railway crossing should\r\nbe sold for their benefit, to which they agreed, and the formal\r\ninstrument of surrender will be enclosed to you by the Indian\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\nThe Indians living at Nettley Creek asked to have a reserve\r\nassigned them there, and I promised to bring their request under\r\nyour notice.\r\n\r\nI did not bring up the question of the division of the band into\r\ntwo, as my experience with the Portage band, arising from a similar\r\ndifficulty, led me to fear that complications might arise from the\r\nproposal which might prevent the settlement of the more important\r\nmatter of the disposal of the open questions relating to the\r\ntreaty. I was therefore of opinion that the division of the band\r\nshould be postponed to next year, and acted upon that opinion. A\r\nparty of Norway House Indians were present and asked for a reserve\r\nat the Grassy Narrows. I informed them that one could not be\r\ngranted at that place, and learning from them that the Chief at\r\nNorway House was about leaving there with a party of Indians to\r\nconfer with me, I engaged three of the Indians present to proceed\r\nat once to Norway House and inform the Indians that I would meet\r\nthem there about the middle of September.\r\n\r\nI have since learned that they met the Chief after he had left\r\nNorway House or Fort Garry, and caused him to return.\r\n\r\n                 I have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n                                 ALEXANDER MORRIS,\r\n                                         Lieut.-Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  GOVERNMENT HOUSE,\r\n             FORT GARRY, MANITOBA, 4th October, 1875.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to inform you that after my return from St.\r\nPeters, finding that in view of my contemplated mission to Lake\r\nWinnipeg it would be impossible for me to visit all the bands of\r\nIndians included in Treaties Numbers One and Two, I requested\r\nthe Indian Commissioner, Mr. Provencher, to proceed to meet them\r\nat Fort Alexander and the Broken Head and Roseau rivers, while\r\nI should proceed to Lake Manitoba and meet at Manitoba House\r\nthe various bands of Indians included in Treaty Number Two. In\r\npursuance of this arrangement, I left here on the 17th of August\r\nfor Oak Point, on Lake Manitoba, where I was to take a boat for\r\nManitoba Post.\r\n\r\nI was accompanied by the Hon. James McKay, whose presence enabled\r\nme to dispense with an interpreter, and was of importance\r\notherwise, as he had assisted my predecessor in the making of the\r\ntreaty originally at Manitoba Post. Mr. Graham, of the Indian\r\nDepartment, also accompanied me to make the payments and distribute\r\nthe pensions. I reached Oak Point on the afternoon of the 18th, and\r\nleft there on the afternoon of the 20th, arriving at Manitoba House\r\non the evening of the 21st. The next day being Sunday, nothing of\r\ncourse was done relating to my mission, but on Monday morning I\r\nmet the Indians at ten o'clock on the lake shore. The six bands\r\nincluded in the treaty were all represented by their Chiefs and\r\nhead men and a large number of their people.\r\n\r\nI explained to them the object of our mission, my remarks being\r\nfully interpreted by Mr. McKay, and obtained their assent in\r\nwriting to the Order in Council of the 30th April last, the terms\r\nof which were accepted with cordiality and good feeling by the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThe new medals and uniforms were distributed to the Chiefs and head\r\nmen, and the payments under the revised treaty were then commenced\r\nby Mr. McKay and Mr. Graham, and continued until 12.30 p.m.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th, the payments were resumed and concluded, but owing to\r\nheavy rain and high winds, we were unable to leave Manitoba Post\r\nuntil the 25th. The Indians on our departure again firing their\r\nguns in token of their respect and good will. Owing to stormy\r\nweather, which obliged us to encamp on Bird Island, we did not\r\nreturn to Oak Point until the afternoon of the 27th.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, the Indians residing in that vicinity, and belonging\r\nto Sousanye's band, were paid by Messrs. McKay and Graham. I\r\nreturned to Fort Garry on the 1st September, in the afternoon, my\r\njourney having been protracted by unfavorable weather, and by the\r\nfact that owing to the prevalence of shoals, the navigation of Lake\r\nManitoba is difficult in stormy weather.\r\n\r\nAs only a small portion of the Riding House Indians were present, I\r\ninformed them that Mr. Graham would proceed to the mountains after\r\nour return, to make the payments, and that I would send by him a\r\nreply to their requests, as to the retention by them of the reserve\r\noriginally designated in the treaty, and this I have since done\r\naffirmatively with your sanction. Mr. Provencher succeeded in\r\nobtaining the adhesion of the bands at Fort Alexander, Broken Head\r\nand Roseau rivers to the new terms, and has handed me the copies of\r\nthe Order in Council with their assents endorsed thereon.\r\n\r\nYou will therefore perceive that with the exception of the Portage\r\nband with regard to whom I wrote you fully on the 2nd of August\r\nlast, the assent of all the Indians interested therein to the\r\nproposed mode of settlement of the unrecorded promises made at the\r\nconclusion of Treaties Numbers One and Two, has been obtained, and\r\nI feel that I have reason to congratulate the Privy Council on the\r\nremoval of a fruitful source of difficulty and discontent. But I\r\nwould add, that it becomes all the more important that a better\r\nsystem of Indian administration should be devised so as to secure\r\nthe prompt and rigid carrying out of the new terms in their\r\nentirety.\r\n\r\nYou are already in possession of my views on this subject, and\r\nI trust that local agents will be appointed to be supervised by\r\nthe Indian Commissioner and that an Indian Council of advice\r\nand control, sitting at Fort Garry, will be entrusted with the\r\ndirection of the Treaties One, Two, and the upper portion of Three,\r\nand the new Treaty Number Five, so as to secure prompt and\r\neffective administration of Indian Affairs.\r\n\r\nUnder the system of local agents, the necessity of large gatherings\r\nof the Indians will be avoided, and much expense to the Government,\r\nand inconvenience to the Indians, avoided. I have further to record\r\nmy sense of the services rendered to me by Messrs. McKay and\r\nGraham. The latter discharged his duties with promptitude and\r\nefficiency, and Mr. McKay and he introduced a mode of distribution\r\nof the provisions to which I would call your attention.\r\n\r\n                I have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n                             ALEXANDER MORRIS,\r\n                                     Lieut.-Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GOVERNMENT HOUSE,\r\n              FORT GARRY, MANITOBA, 2nd August, 1875.\r\n\r\nSir,--In accordance with your request I have commenced my visits to\r\nthe Indian bands included in Treaties Numbers One and Two, with a\r\nview to settling the matters in dispute. I left here on the 22nd\r\ninst., and was accompanied by the Hon. James McKay, whom I had\r\ninvited to accompany me in consequence of his having been present\r\nat the making of the treaties, and by the Indian Commissioner.\r\n\r\nI reached the Round Plain on the Assiniboine river, where Yellow\r\nQuill's band of Saulteaux had assembled on the 26th, and met the\r\nIndians next day, explaining to them our mission, and telling them\r\nwhat I was empowered to promise them. This band, as you are aware,\r\nhas always been dissatisfied, and have been difficult to deal with\r\nI found them in an intractable frame of mind, and the difficulty of\r\nthe position was enhanced by a division amongst themselves.\r\n\r\nThe original Chief of the Portage band was Pee-quah-kee-quah, who\r\nwas a party to the treaty with Lord Selkirk. On his death he was\r\nsucceeded by his son, who died some years ago leaving a boy, who\r\nhas now grown up. Yellow Quill was appointed chief by the Hudson's\r\nBay Company when Pee-quah-kee-quah's son died. The grandson is now\r\ngrown up and has returned from the plains, where he has been, and\r\nclaims to be recognized as an hereditary chief, and about half\r\nthe band have followed his lead. After we had been in conference\r\nsome time, an Indian rose and told me that when the chief of the\r\nPortage died, he charged him to keep the land for his son, and that\r\nthey wished a reserve at the Portage. Another rose and produced\r\nPee-quah-kee-quah's King George medal, and said the chief had\r\nplaced it in his keeping and charged him to deliver it to his son,\r\nwhen he was old enough to be a chief, and then placed it round the\r\nneck of Kes-kee-maquah, or the Short Bear. They then asked that I\r\nshould receive him as a chief, in place of Yellow Quill. I told\r\nthem that could not be done. That Yellow Quill must remain a chief,\r\nbut that I would report their request on behalf of the young chief\r\nto the Government at Ottawa and let them know their decision,\r\nbut that they could get no reserve at the Portage as only that\r\nmentioned in the treaty would be given, and with this they were\r\nsatisfied. The conference then went on, the two parties sitting\r\napart and holding no intercourse with each other. I spent two days\r\nwith them making no progress, as they claimed that a reserve thirty\r\nmiles by twenty was promised them as shewn in the rough sketch\r\nenclosed, made at their dictation and marked \"A.\" I produced the\r\nplan of the reserve, as proposed to be allotted to them, containing\r\n34,000 acres, but Yellow Quill said it was not in the right place,\r\nand was not what was promised, and morever it was not surrounded\r\nby the belt of five miles, mentioned in the treaty, but was only\r\npartially so and did not cross the river. I told them they could\r\nget no more land than was promised in the treaty. They appealed to\r\nMr. McKay whether the Reserve was not promised to be on both sides\r\nof the river, and he admitted that it was. I told them it was not\r\nso written in the treaty, and that if the Government should allow\r\nit to cross the river, the rights of navigation must be conserved,\r\nbut I would consult the Queen's Councillors. They replied that they\r\nwould go to the \"Grand Father\" and get him to intercede for them,\r\nmeaning the \"President of the United States,\" as I afterwards\r\ndiscovered, an American Indian having persuaded them to take this\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThey refused to discuss or accept anything until the Reserve\r\nQuestion was settled, and while I was speaking on the afternoon of\r\nthe second day, Yellow Quill's Councillors went away, and left him\r\nalone, when he followed. I then left the Council tent, leaving word\r\nthat I would depart in the morning. Yellow Quill came back and said\r\nthat he would accept the five dollars, but Mr. McKay told him he\r\nhad not taken my hand, and that it would not be paid, as my offer\r\nwas conditioned on a settlement of all questions between them and\r\nthe Government. About six o'clock, Yellow Quill and his Councillors\r\nsent me the following message which had been written for them by\r\nMr. Deputy Sheriff Setter from their dictation.\r\n\r\n\"They didn't come to see you. You came to see them, and if you\r\nchoose to come and speak to them again, you can come if you like.\"\r\n\r\nI felt that I must now deal firmly with them, and therefore\r\nprepared the following reply:\r\n\r\n\"It is not right, for they came to see me at my request, as their\r\nGovernor, and I came to meet them. After spending two days with\r\nthem, their Chief insulted me by rising and going out while I was\r\nspeaking, and breaking up the Conference. I represent the Queen,\r\nand his action was disrespectful to her. I will not go to meet you\r\nagain. If you are sorry for the way I have been treated you can\r\ncome and see me.\"\r\n\r\nI charged Mr. McKay to deliver it to them in their Council, which\r\nhe did, when they denied having meant to send the message in the\r\nterms in which it was, and disclaimed all intended offence. The\r\nmessage had its desired effect, but their disclaimer was not\r\ncorrect, as Mr. Setter informs me that he had originally written\r\na welcome to me, which they caused him to strike out, and to say\r\nthat \"I could come if I chose.\" Next morning I struck my tents and\r\nloaded my waggons and prepared to leave. Seeing this, Yellow Quill\r\nand his Councillors came to Mr. McKay, and asked if I would not see\r\nthem again, to which I consented. On proceeding to Mr. Provencher's\r\npay tent, I met the Chief, Yellow Quill. His spokesman rose, saying\r\n\"that they were glad to have met me, that they had found my words\r\ngood; that they had not desired to offend the Queen or me, and\r\nwere sorry; that God had watched us during two days, and He was\r\nagain looking on.\" I accepted their apology, and then proceeded\r\nto practical business, the whole tone and demeanor of the Indians\r\nbeing changed, having become cordial and friendly. I may mention\r\nhere, that Yellow Quill reproached his Councillors for their\r\nconduct. He also informed Mr. McKay privately, that he could not\r\nact otherwise as he was in danger of his life from some of his own\r\n\"braves.\" He was guarded all the time by a man armed with a bow and\r\nsteel-pointed arrows. I promised to state their claims as to the\r\nreserve, but told them it would not be granted, but that I would\r\nchange the location of the reserve, as it had been selected without\r\ntheir approval, and would represent their view as to its locality,\r\nand as to crossing the river, the navigation of which, however,\r\ncould not be interfered with. They asked to be paid three dollars\r\nper head or one dollar per year for the following transaction:\r\nIn 1868 a number of Ontario farmers had settled on Rat Creek.\r\nYellow Quill's band drove them off and trouble was impending.\r\nGovernor McTavish sent Mr. McKay up to arrange the difficulty, in\r\nanticipation of the advent of Canadian power. He made a lease for\r\nthree years of their rights, assuring them that before that time\r\nthe Canadian Government would make a treaty with them and recognize\r\nthe temporary arrangement, and in consequence the settlers were\r\nunmolested. The question was not raised at the \"Stone Fort\" Treaty,\r\nand I told them I had not known of it before, but supposed the\r\nGovernment would hold that the treaty had covered it, and that\r\nthe extra two dollars would compensate for it, but that I would\r\nrepresent their news and give them an answer. They complained\r\nof the mode of payment, as my predecessor assured them that their\r\nchildren who were absent should be paid when they presented\r\nthemselves, and that they only got two years payment instead of the\r\nfull amount. As these were Mr. Provencher's instructions I promised\r\nto report it. They expressed themselves quite satisfied with the\r\narrangements as to the outside promises, and would gladly accept of\r\nit, if the reserve question was settled, but that they could not\r\nreceive that as surveyed. I took the opportunity of explaining to\r\nthem that the \"President of the United States\" had no power here,\r\nand that the Queen and Her Councillors were the only authorities\r\nthey had to deal with, and that I would state their wishes as fully\r\nas they could do themselves. They asked if I would come back,\r\nbut I said not this year, but next year either I or some other\r\nCommissioner would meet them. Eventually they cheerfully agreed to\r\naccept the three dollars annuity as usual, and to defer a final\r\nadjustment of the question between us until next year, and promised\r\nto accompany any one I sent to select the reserve and agree on\r\nits locality. They again thanked me for my kindness and patience\r\nwith them, and I took leave of them. I regard the result as very\r\nsatisfactory, as I left the band contented, and you are aware\r\nof their intimate relation with the \"Plain Indians,\" and the\r\ndifficulty their message to Qu'Appelle, \"that the white man had\r\nnot kept his promises,\" caused us then, and it is very important\r\nthat they should be satisfied. I returned to the Portage, and Mr.\r\nProvencher proceeded to Totogan, and paid the White Mud section\r\nof the band, numbering one hundred and thirty, who are nominally\r\nincluded in it, but do not recognize Yellow Quill's authority, the\r\nusual annuities, which they accepted without demur.\r\n\r\nI would now make the following recommendations:\r\n\r\n1st. That you should write to Yellow Quill declining to entertain\r\nhis demands for the large reserve but offering to them a reserve\r\nincluding the \"Eagle's Nest\" on the north side of the river, and\r\nlaid off in the terms of the treaty, with the land comprised in the\r\none hundred and sixty acres for each family, surrounded by the belt\r\nmentioned in the treaty, in the manner suggested in the enclosed\r\nrough sketch \"B,\" reserving the rights of navigation and access to\r\nthe river. The land is of inferior quality to that already offered\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n2nd. I would propose that the young chief should be recognized as\r\nhead of the section of the band adhering to him. He and his section\r\nare ready to accept the terms and the reserve as described in\r\nthe treaty. They behaved very well and told Mr. McKay that they\r\nwere glad I had not recognized him then, as it would have led to\r\nbloodshed, and they would be content if the recognition came when\r\nthe reserve was settled. The young chief is an intelligent, well\r\ndisposed man, aged about twenty-six.\r\n\r\n3rd. I would propose that the White Mud Indians, who live there\r\nconstantly, should be recognized as a distinct band and should\r\nelect a Chief.\r\n\r\n4th. I would recommend that the arrears due to Indians who have not\r\nyet received their annuities, should be paid in full at once, but\r\nthat a period of two years should be fixed for those bona fide\r\nmembers of the band to come in and be paid, and that after that\r\nthey should only receive one year's payment. If these steps are\r\ntaken, I think we shall have no more trouble with these Indians.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I have to express my obligations to the Hon. Mr.\r\nMcKay for the valuable services he rendered me. The Indians told me\r\nthey would not have come into the Stone Fort Treaty but for him,\r\nand I know it was the case.\r\n\r\n                        I have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n                                        ALEXANDER MORRIS,\r\n                                                 Lieut.-Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               GOVERNMENT HOUSE,\r\n                        FORT GARRY, MANITOBA, 8th July 1876.\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to inform you that, in compliance with your\r\nrequest, I left this on the 14th ult. with the view of proceeding\r\nto the Long Plain on the Assiniboine, in order to meet the Indians\r\nof the Portage Band, to arrange the dispute with regard to the\r\nreserve, and to settle the outside promises. Mr. Graham, of the\r\nIndian Department, and Mr. Reid, P.L.S., also went there at my\r\nrequest, the one to act as paymaster, and the other, as you wished,\r\nto survey the reserve. Owing to the prevalence of heavy rain the\r\nroads were in so bad a condition that I was four days in reaching\r\nthe Long Plain, while we were also subjected to inconvenience and\r\nexpense by the detention of the provisions, owing to the same\r\ncause. Added to my other discomforts was the presence of mosquitoes\r\nin incredible numbers, so that the journey and the sojourn at the\r\nPlain were anything but pleasurable. I had taken the precaution\r\nto request Mr. Cummings, the interpreter, to summon the White Mud\r\nIndians as well as Yellow Quill's band, and those who adhered to\r\nthe Short Bear.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at the Long Plains, which I accomplished on the 17th,\r\nI found about five hundred Indians assembled, but camped in three\r\nseparate encampments. On arriving, I was saluted by a feu de joie.\r\nAt the Portage, Mr. Graham had obtained some provisions, which he\r\nhad sent forward in carts.\r\n\r\nOn our way we met some carts sent by the Indians to relieve my\r\nwaggons of the tents and baggage, the Indian trail being almost\r\nimpracticable; but instead of so using them I sent them on toward\r\nthe Portage to meet the loaded carts, and was thus enabled to\r\nget the temporary supply of provisions to the Plain, which was\r\nfortunate, as the Indians were without food. The evening of my\r\narrival the Councillors of Yellow Quill came to talk with me, but\r\nI declined to do so, telling them that the Chief had not come, and\r\nI would only speak with him. I acted thus, in consequence of the\r\nconduct of their head men, last year, when they controlled the\r\nChief and coerced the whole band. In a short time Yellow Quill\r\ncame with them to see me, and finding that they had come about\r\nprovisions, I referred them to Mr. Graham, who, I informed them,\r\nhad charge of the provisions and payments. The incident had a\r\nmarked effect in giving tone to the following negotiations.\r\n\r\nOn Monday I met the Indians, who ranged themselves in three\r\nparties. I explained to them the proposed arrangement of the\r\noutside promises very fully, and told them that as they were\r\nwilling to accept of the settlement last year, I did so for their\r\ninformation only. I then took up the question of the reserve, read\r\nthe terms in which it was referred to in the Stone Fort Treaty,\r\nexplained to them that they were getting double the land any other\r\nIndians in Treaties Numbers One and Two were doing, but told them\r\nthe reserve belonged to all of them, and not to Yellow Quill's band\r\nalone. I then called on them to speak to me, asking Yellow Quill\r\nfirst. He said he did not understand the extent of the reserve. I\r\nthen asked Mr. Reid to shew them a diagram of it, and to explain to\r\nthem its length in ordinary miles, and otherwise, which he did very\r\nsatisfactorily, and at length they comprehended it. I then called\r\non Short Bear's band to express their views. They said they wanted\r\na reserve at the Long Plain, if it was only a little piece of land;\r\nthat they liked the place, that they had built houses and planted\r\ngardens, had cut oak to build more houses, and wished to farm\r\nthere. I then called on the White Mud Indians. They said that they\r\nwere Christians and had always lived at the White Mud River; that\r\nthey did not wish to join either Yellow Quill's or Short Bear's\r\nreserve, but desired a reserve at the Big Point. I told them they\r\ncould not have it there, as there were settlers, and the Government\r\nwished them to join one of the other bands, and explained to them\r\nthat their holdings would be respected, except where inadvertently\r\nsold. I took this course, as I had ascertained that the plan of\r\nYellow Quill's head men was to make no settlement this year, and\r\nthat they had induced the other Indians to agree to act in that\r\nway. I accordingly so shaped my opening speech and my dealings with\r\nthe Indians as to defeat this project, by securing the support of\r\nShort Bear's and the White Mud Indians, which I succeeded in doing,\r\nthough Yellow Quill's spokesman taunted the others with having\r\nbroken their agreement. As the conference proceeded, Yellow Quill's\r\ncouncillors said they did not want the band broken up, as they\r\nwished all to live together. I told Yellow Quill he would have his\r\nreserve on both sides of the river, reserving the navigation, and\r\nthat if they could agree to go to one reserve, I would be pleased;\r\nbut if not, that I would settle the matter. Yellow Quill said his\r\ncouncillors were willing that the other Indians should have a\r\nseparate reserve provided they retained the belt of twenty-five\r\nmiles, in addition to their proportion of the reserve. I informed\r\nthem this could not be done; the reserve belonged to all. They then\r\nasked for an adjournment, in order that they might meet together\r\nand have a smoke over it, to assemble again when I hoisted my flag.\r\nAfter a couple of hours interval I again convened them. The Short\r\nBears and White Mud Indians adhered to what they stated to me, but\r\nYellow Quill's band insisted on one reserve for all, but admitted\r\nthat the objections of Short Bear's band to the place asked by them\r\nwere well founded, and that it was sandy and unfit for farming,\r\nand that they would like to select a reserve higher up the River\r\nAssiniboine. I then adjourned the conference until morning, and\r\nasked them to meet together and be prepared for settlement.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 20th June, the Indians again responded to the\r\nhoisting of my flag, and met at 9 o'clock. Yellow Quill told me\r\nthat his band were now willing to separate from the others, and\r\nwished to select a reserve higher up the river. I informed them\r\nthat I would accede to their request, but that they must do it at\r\nonce, and on the approval thereof by the Privy Council it would be\r\nlaid off. Short Bear's band still desired a reserve at the Long\r\nPlain, to which I assented. The White Mud River Indians asked for\r\na separate reserve where they could farm, and I informed them that\r\nunder the discretionary powers I possessed I would have a reserve\r\nselected for them, giving them their proportion of the original\r\nreserve. The Indians then asked that the two dollars per head,\r\nwhich had, as they said, slipped through their fingers last year,\r\nshould be paid to them, and I told them that I had been authorized\r\nto do so, which gave them much satisfaction. In anticipation of a\r\nsettlement I had prepared a draft agreement, which was being copied\r\nfor me by Mr. Graham. I informed them of this, and stated that\r\nI would sign it, and that the Chiefs and Councillors must do so\r\nlikewise, so that there could be no misunderstanding. When the\r\nagreement was completed, I asked Mr. Cummings, the Interpreter,\r\nto read it to them, which he did. Three Indians, who understood\r\nEnglish, and who had at an early period been selected by the\r\nIndians to check the interpretation of what was said, standing by,\r\nand Mr. Cummings being assisted by Mr. Cook, of St. James, who, at\r\nMr. Cummings' request, I had associated with him, on the Indians\r\nchoosing their interpreters. I then signed the agreement, and\r\ncalled upon Yellow Quill to do so. He came forward cheerfully and\r\nsaid he would sign it, because he now understood what he never\r\ndid before, viz., what was agreed to at the Stone Fort. I then\r\ncalled on his Councillors to sign, but they refused, saying\r\nthey had agreed by the mouth. I then told the Indians that\r\nunless the Councillors signed nothing could be done, and that the\r\nCouncillors who refused would be responsible for the failure of the\r\nnegotiations. One of them then signed, but the other persistently\r\nrefused. I repeated my warning, and at length he reluctantly came\r\nforward and said he wished to ask me a question, \"Would the head\r\nmen be paid?\" I told him I had no authority to do so, but would\r\nreport his request. He said he did not expect it this year, but\r\nhoped for it next. Eventually he signed the agreement. I then said\r\nI would recognize Short Bear as a Chief, and asked him to select\r\nhis Councillors and braves. He did so at once, making a judicious\r\nchoice, and came forward to touch the pen, saying \"I thank you for\r\nmy people.\" His Councillors promptly followed, one of them asking\r\nfor a part of the reserve on the other side of the river, which I\r\nrefused. I then called on the White Mud River Indians to select a\r\nChief and one Councillor, being under the impression at the time\r\nthat they were the least numerous band, which, however, has turned\r\nout not to be the case, which they did at once, and on their being\r\npresented to me they signed the agreement. I then gave a medal to\r\nYellow Quill, and promised to send the other two Chiefs medals\r\nwhen procured from Ottawa, the supply here being exhausted. To the\r\nChiefs and Councillors suits of clothing were then distributed,\r\nYellow Quill and his head men having hitherto refused to accept\r\neither medals or coats, but now taking them. Yellow Quill then\r\npresented me with a skin coat, and said that he parted with the\r\nother Indians as friends, and that there would be no hard feelings.\r\nThe conference then broke up, and thus terminated a difficulty\r\nwhich has existed for several years, and the influence of which\r\nwas felt as an obstacle, as you are aware, at Qu'Appelle when the\r\ntreaty was made there. Mr. Graham at once commenced the payments,\r\nand during the evening the three Chiefs and their Councillors\r\ncalled on me, evidently being on the most friendly terms with each\r\nother, a state of things which had not existed for a considerable\r\nperiod. In the morning, as I was leaving for the Portage, the\r\nIndians assembled near my waggon and gave three cheers for the\r\nQueen and three for the Governor, and I then drove off amid a\r\nsalute of firearms from all sections of the encampment. I left\r\nMr. Graham to complete the payments, and here record my sense of\r\nthe efficient services he rendered me. He understands the Indian\r\ncharacter, and gets on well with them. I requested Mr. Reid to\r\nvisit the White Mud region and ascertain what persons are entitled\r\nto holdings under the terms of your instructions, and also to\r\nsurvey Short Bear's reserve.\r\n\r\nYellow Quill is to go without delay to look up a reserve, and as\r\nthere are no settlers in the region in question, I propose that if\r\nMr. Reid sees no objection to the locality he should at once lay\r\nit off, so as to effectually terminate the chronic difficulty with\r\nthis band. I shall be glad to receive by telegram your approval\r\nof his doing so. The interpreters, Mr. Cummings, Mr. Cook, of St.\r\nJames, a trader, and Kissoway, an Indian trader belonging to the\r\nband, rendered me much service; the latter trades in the west,\r\nand was passing the Portage on his way to Fort Garry, and as he\r\nbelonged to Yellow Quill's band, and is a relative of his, being\r\na son of the deceased Pecheto, (another of whose sons was the\r\nspokesman at Qu'Appelle, as you will recollect) he came to the\r\nLong Plains to advise the band to come to terms. He remained at\r\nmy request until the negotiations were concluded, and exerted a\r\nmost beneficial influence over Yellow Quill's band. I call your\r\nattention to the request of Yellow Quill's Councillors, that they\r\nshould be paid. As in Treaties Three, Four and Five, they are paid,\r\nand as the expense would not be large, I am of opinion that before\r\nthe Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Superintendency of\r\nManitoba proceeds to make the payments in Treaties One and Two, he\r\nshould be authorized to pay the head men. It will be difficult to\r\nexplain why the difference is made, and it will secure in every\r\nband, men who will feel that they are officers of the Crown and\r\nremunerated as such. I returned to Fort Garry on the 23rd inst.,\r\nencountering on the way a very severe thunder storm, which\r\ncompelled me to take advantage of the very acceptable shelter of\r\nthe kindly proffered residence of the Hon. Mr. Breland, at White\r\nHorse Plains, instead of a tent on the thoroughly-drenched\r\nprairie. I congratulate you that with the successful issue of\r\nthis negotiation is closed, in Treaties One and Two, the vexed\r\nquestion of the open promises. I forward by this mail a copy of\r\nthe agreement I have above alluded to, retaining the original for\r\nthe present, and will be pleased to hear of its speedy approval\r\nby the Privy Council.\r\n\r\n                        I have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n                                      ALEXANDER MORRIS,\r\n                                              Lieut.-Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE WINNIPEG TREATY, NUMBER FIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis treaty, covers an area of approximately about 100,000 square\r\nmiles. The region is inhabited by Chippewas and Swampy Crees.\r\nThe necessity for it had become urgent. The lake is a large and\r\nvaluable sheet of water, being some three hundred miles long. The\r\nRed River flows into it and the Nelson River flows from it into\r\nHudson's Bay. Steam navigation had been successfully established by\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company on Lake Winnipeg. A tramway of five miles\r\nin length was being built by them to avoid the Grand Rapids and\r\nconnect that navigation with steamers on the River Saskatchewan. On\r\nthe west side of the lake, a settlement of Icelandic immigrants had\r\nbeen founded, and some other localities were admirably adapted for\r\nsettlement. Moreover, until the construction of the Pacific Railway\r\nwest of the city of Winnipeg, the lake and Saskatchewan River are\r\ndestined to become the principal thoroughfare of communication\r\nbetween Manitoba and the fertile prairies in the west. A band of\r\nIndians residing at Norway House, who had supported themselves by\r\nserving the Hudson's Bay Company as boatmen on the route from Lake\r\nWinnipeg to the Hudson Bay, by way of the Nelson River, but whose\r\noccupation was gone, owing to supplies being brought in by way of\r\nthe Red River, desired to migrate to the western shore of Lake\r\nWinnipeg, and support themselves there by farming.\r\n\r\nFor these and other reasons, the Minister of the Interior reported\r\n\"that it was essential that the Indian title to all the territory\r\nin the vicinity of the lake should be extinguished so that\r\nsettlers and traders might have undisturbed access to its waters,\r\nshores, islands, inlets and tributary streams.\" The mouth of\r\nthe Saskatchewan River especially seemed to be of importance,\r\nas presenting an eligible site for a future town. For these\r\nreasons the Privy Council of Canada, in the year 1875, appointed\r\nLieut.-Gov. Morris, and the Hon. James McKay, to treat with these\r\nIndians. It may be here stated that this remarkable man, the\r\nson of an Orkneyman by an Indian mother, has recently died at a\r\ncomparatively early age. Originally in the service of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company, he became a trader on his own account. Thoroughly\r\nunderstanding the Indian character, he possessed large influence\r\nover the Indian tribes, which he always used for the benefit and\r\nthe advantage of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company, to resume this narrative, kindly placed\r\ntheir propeller steamer, the Colville, at the service of the\r\nCommissioners, and the Board in London, in view of the public\r\nservice rendered by its use by the Commissioners, eventually\r\ndeclined to make any charge for its employment. A full report\r\nof the voyage of the Commissioners, and of the results of their\r\nmission, will be found in the despatch of the Lieutenant-Governor,\r\nwhich will be found at the end of this chapter. Suffice it to say,\r\nthat the Commissioners proceeded first to Berens River, on the east\r\nside of the lake, and made a treaty with the Indians of that side\r\nof the lake, thence they sailed to the head of Lake Winnipeg,\r\ndescended the Nelson River to Norway House, where no steamer had\r\never before been, and concluded a treaty with the Indians there.\r\n\r\nThey also promised the Indians to give those of them who chose to\r\nremove, a reserve on the west side of Lake Winnipeg, at Fisher's\r\nRiver, about forty miles from the Icelandic settlement.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of families have since removed there, and\r\nhave formed a very promising settlement.\r\n\r\nFrom Nelson River the Commissioners proceeded to the mouth of the\r\nGreat Saskatchewan River, and met the Indians who live there. Their\r\nhouses were built at the foot of the Grand Rapids, and in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the Hudson's Bay, Tramway, some seven miles\r\nfrom the mouth of the river. The river is here deep to the very\r\nshore, so that the steamer ran long aside the bank, and was moored\r\nby ropes attached to the Chief's house. The Commissioners met\r\nthe Indians and informed them of the desire of the Government\r\nto control the land where they had settled, and to give them a\r\nreserve, instead, on the opposite side of the river. They said,\r\nthey would surrender the locality in question, and go to the south\r\nside of the river, if a small sum was given them, to aid them in\r\nremoving their houses or building others. To this the Commissioners\r\nwillingly acceded, and promised that the next year a sum of five\r\nhundred dollars would be paid them for that purpose. The treaty was\r\nthen signed, the Commissioners having extended the boundaries of\r\nthe treaty limits, so as to include the Swampy Cree Indians at the\r\nPas or Wahpahpuha, a settlement on the Saskatchewan River, and\r\nrecommended that Commissioners should be sent in the ensuing summer\r\nto complete the work. The Commissioners then returned to Winnipeg,\r\nafter a voyage, on and around the lake, of about one thousand\r\nmiles. The terms of the treaty were identical with those of\r\nTreaties Numbers Three and Four, except that a smaller quantity of\r\nland was granted to each family, being one hundred and sixty, or in\r\nsome cases one hundred acres to each family of five, while under\r\nTreaties Numbers Three and Four the quantity of land allowed was\r\nsix hundred and forty acres to each such family. The gratuity paid\r\neach Indian in recognition of the treaty was also five dollars per\r\nhead, instead of twelve dollars the circumstances under which the\r\ntreaty was made being different. The area covered by these treaties\r\nwas approximately about 100,000 square miles and has been described\r\nas lying north of the territory covered by Treaties Numbers Two and\r\nThree, extending west to Cumberland House (on the Saskatchewan\r\nRiver) and including the country east and west of Lake Winnipeg,\r\nand of Nelson River as far north as Split Lake.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, Lieut.-Gov. Morris, in accordance with his suggestions to\r\nthat effect, was requested by the Minister of the Interior, to take\r\nsteps for completing the treaty, and entrusted the duty to the Hon.\r\nThomas Howard, and J. Lestock Reid, Esq., Dominion Land Surveyor.\r\nHe gave them formal instructions, and directed them to meet the\r\nIndians together at Dog Head Point, on the lake, to treat with the\r\nIsland Indians there and thence to proceed to Berens River to meet\r\nthe Indians of the rapids of that river who had not been able to be\r\npresent the previous year, and thereafter directed Mr. Howard to\r\nproceed to the mouth of the Saskatchewan and pay the Indians the\r\nfive hundred dollars for removal of the houses, and thence to go up\r\nthe Saskatchewan to the Pas and deal with the Indians there, while\r\nMr. Reid was to proceed from Berens River to Norway House, and\r\narrange with the Indians for the removal of such of them as desired\r\nit, to Fisher's River, on Lake Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen accordingly in July, 1876, proceeded in York boats\r\n(large sail boats) to their respective destinations, and were very\r\nsuccessful in accomplishing the work confided to them.\r\n\r\nI now append the official despatch of Lieut.-Gov. Morris, dated\r\n11th October, 1875, giving an account of the making of the treaty\r\nand of the journey, and his despatch of the 17th November, 1876,\r\nrelating to the completion of the treaty, together with extracts\r\nfrom the reports of Messrs. Howard and Reid.\r\n\r\nFORT GARRY, October 11th, 1875.\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to inform you, that under authority of the\r\nCommission of the Privy Council to that effect, I proceeded to\r\nLake Winnipeg for the purpose of making a treaty with the Saulteaux\r\nand Swampy Cree Indians, in company with my associate, the Hon.\r\nJames McKay, leaving Fort Garry for Chief Prince's Landing on\r\nthe Red River, on the 17th September last, in order to embark on\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company's new propeller, the Colville, which\r\nChief Commissioner Graham had kindly placed at our disposal on\r\nadvantageous terms. We selected this mode of conveyance, as\r\ntravelling and conveyance of provisions in York boats would, at the\r\nadvanced period of the season, have occupied at least eight weeks,\r\nif at all practicable.\r\n\r\nThe steamer left the landing at five o'clock on the 18th September,\r\nbut owing to the prevalence of a gale of northerly wind was\r\ncompelled to be anchored at the three channels of the Red River,\r\ninside of the bar which obstructs the entrance of the lake. The\r\nwind continued during the 18th and 19th, but on the afternoon of\r\nthe latter day, Captain Hackland, a sailor of much practical\r\nexperience on the Northern Seas decided to risk going out, as the\r\nwater on the bar was running down so fast that he feared that the\r\nsteamer would be unable to cross over the bar. I may remark that\r\nthe wind causes the waters of the lake to ebb and flow into the\r\nriver with great rapidity, and that the bar is so serious an\r\nobstruction to an important navigation, that it ought to be\r\nexamined with a view to ascertain the cost and practicability of\r\nits removal. Leaving our anchorage, we crossed the bar at three in\r\nthe afternoon with difficulty, and proceeded on our voyage;\r\nanchored opposite the mouth of the Berens River on Monday, the\r\n20th, at nine a.m., to await the arrival of a pilot, as no steamer\r\nhad ever before entered the river. Under the pilotage of a Chief\r\nand a Councillor, we reached Berens River Post, the Indians\r\ngreeting us with volleys of firearms, and at once summoned the\r\nIndians to meet us in the Wesleyan Mission School House, which the\r\nRev. Mr. Young kindly placed at our disposal. We met the Indians at\r\nfour o'clock, and explained the object of our visit. The question\r\nof reserves was one of some difficulty, but eventually this was\r\narranged, and the Indians agreed to accept our offer, and the\r\nindenture of treaty was signed by the Chiefs and head men about\r\neleven p.m. The payment of the present of five dollars per head,\r\nprovided by the treaty, was immediately commenced by Mr. McKay and\r\nthe Hon. Thomas Howard, who accompanied me as Secretary and Pay\r\nMaster, and was continued until one a.m., when the payment was\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\nThe steamer left next day, the 21st, for Norway House, but the\r\ncaptain was obliged to anchor at George's Island in the evening,\r\nowing to the stormy weather. The Colville remained at anchor all\r\nthe next day, the 22nd, but left at midnight for Nelson River. We\r\nsighted the Mossy and Montreal points, at the mouth of that river,\r\nabout nine a.m. on the 23rd, and arrived at the old or abandoned\r\nNorway House at eleven o'clock, under the guidance of Roderick\r\nRose, Esquire, of the Hudson's Bay Company's Service, at Norway\r\nHouse, who had been engaged for some days in examining the channel,\r\nin anticipation of our visit.\r\n\r\nThe Nelson River expands into Play Green Lake, a large stream of\r\nwater studded with islands, presenting a remarkable resemblance to\r\nthe Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence River. The distance from\r\nthe mouth of the river to Norway House is twenty miles. We arrived\r\nat Norway House at three o'clock and were welcomed there by the\r\nIndians, who fired a salute.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th we met the Indians in a large store-house of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company, and asked them to present their Chiefs and\r\nhead men. We found that there were two distinct bands of Indians,\r\nthe Christian Indians of Norway House, and the Wood or Pagan\r\nIndians of Cross Lake. Each elected their Chiefs by popular vote in\r\na most business-like manner, and the Chiefs, after consulting the\r\nbands, selected the head men. We then accepted the Chiefs, and I\r\nmade an explanation of the object of our visit in English, and the\r\nHon. James McKay in the Indian dialect. We severed the questions of\r\nterms and reserves, postponing the latter till we had disposed of\r\nthe former. The Indians gratefully accepted of the offered terms,\r\nand we adjourned the conference to enable them to consult as to\r\nreserves. On re-assembling, the Christian Chief stated that as they\r\ncould no longer count on employment in boating for the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany, owing to the introduction of steam navigation, he and a\r\nportion of his band wished to migrate to Lake Winnipeg, where they\r\ncould obtain a livelihood by farming and fishing. We explained why\r\nwe could not grant them a reserve for that purpose at the Grassy\r\nNarrows as they wished, owing to the proposed Icelandic settlement\r\nthere, but offered to allot them a reserve at Fisher River, about\r\nforty miles north of the Narrows, and this they accepted. It is\r\nsupposed that some eighty or ninety families will remove there\r\nin spring, and it was arranged that those who remain, instead\r\nof receiving a reserve, should retain their present houses and\r\ngardens. The Chief of the Pagan band, who has, however, recently\r\nbeen baptized, stated that the Wood Indians wished to remain at\r\nCross Lake, and we agreed that a reserve should be allotted them\r\nthere. The treaty was then signed and the medals and uniforms\r\npresented. The Chiefs, on behalf of their people, thanked Her\r\nMajesty and her officers for their kindness to the Indian people,\r\nwhich I suitably acknowledged, and the payment of the presents was\r\ncommenced by Messrs. McKay and Howard, and completed on the 15th.\r\n\r\nWe left that day at half-past three amidst cheering by the Indians\r\nand a salute of fire-arms, and came to anchor in Play Green Lake,\r\nat Kettle Island, at half-past five.\r\n\r\nThe steamer left Kettle Island next morning at six o'clock for the\r\nGrand Rapids of the Saskatchewan, which we reached at four o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe original post of the Hudson's Bay Company, at the mouth of\r\nthe river, has been abandoned, and a new one established on their\r\nreserve, some six miles higher up the river, at the head of the\r\nportage, which the river steamer descends to. The Colville, at our\r\nrequest ran up to the Chiefs house, situated on the shore of a deep\r\nbay, and was moored and gangways laid out to the shore. We found an\r\nIndian village on the north side, and also the Chief's house, which\r\nwas built on the only spot where good and inexpensive wharfage can\r\nbe had, and ascertained afterwards that the Indians claimed the\r\nwhole north shore for a reserve.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th we met the Indians near the Chief's house in the open\r\nair, at a spot where a large fire had been lighted by them, as the\r\nweather was cold. We took a similar course as at Norway House in\r\nsevering the question of terms of the treaty and reserves, and with\r\nlike satisfactory results. After a lengthy discussion the Indians\r\nagreed to accept the terms, and we then entered upon the difficult\r\nquestion of the reserves. They complained of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany's reserve, and wished to have the land covered by it,\r\nbut we explained whatever had been promised the Company would be\r\ngiven just as promises made to them would be kept. They said the\r\nCompany's reserve should be at the abandoned post at the mouth of\r\nthe river, and not at the end of the portage. We informed them that\r\nwe would inquire as to this. They then claimed a reserve on both\r\nsides of the river of large extent, and extending up to the head of\r\nthe Grand Rapids, but this we declined to accede to. Eventually, as\r\nthe locality they had hitherto occupied is so important a point,\r\ncontrolling as it does the means of communication between the mouth\r\nof the river, and the head of the rapids, and where a \"tram-way\"\r\nwill no doubt ere long require to be constructed, presenting also\r\ndeep-water navigation and excellent wharfage, and evidently being\r\nmoreover the site where a town will spring up, we offered them\r\nreserve on the south side of the river. They objected, that they\r\nhad their houses and gardens on the north side of the river, but\r\nsaid that as the Queen's Government were treating them so kindly,\r\nthat they would go to south side of the river, if a small sum was\r\ngiven them to assist in removing their houses, or building others,\r\nand this as will be seen by the terms of the treaty, we agreed to\r\ndo, believing it to be alike in the interests of the Government\r\nto have the control of so important a point as the mouth of the\r\ngreat internal river of the Saskatchewan, and yet only just to the\r\nIndians, who were making what was to them so large a concession to\r\nthe wishes of the Commissioners. On our agreeing to the proposal,\r\nthe treaty was cheerfully signed by the Chief and head men, and\r\nthe payment of the present was made to them, together with a\r\ndistribution of some provisions. I enclose a tracing of the mouth\r\nof the river, copied from a sketch thereof kindly made for me by\r\nMr. Ross, which will enable you to understand the actual position\r\nof the locality in question, and the better appreciate our reasons\r\nfor our action in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe steamer left the Grand Rapids in the afternoon of the 27th, and\r\nthe captain took his course for the mouth of the Red River, but\r\nanchored, as the night became very dark, between George's Island\r\nand Swampy Island.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, resuming our course at half past five a.m., we sighted\r\nBerens River Mission House at eight o'clock, and passed into the\r\nchannel between Black Bear Island and Dog Head or Wapang Point,\r\nat 12.30; then observing a number of Indians on the shore making\r\nsignals to us by firing guns, we requested the captain to approach\r\nthe shore. The water being very deep the steamer went close inshore\r\nand anchored--the Indians coming off to us in their canoes. We\r\nfound them to be headed by Thickfoot, a principal Indian of the\r\nband inhabiting the islands, and some of those and the Jack Head\r\nband of the West Shore, and explained to them the object of our\r\nvisit. They told us they had heard of it, and had been waiting to\r\nsee us. Thickfoot said the Island Indians at Big Island, Black\r\nIsland, Wapang and the other islands in the vicinity had no chief;\r\nthat they numbered one hundred and twenty-eight, and those at\r\nJack-Fish Head sixty. Thickfoot said he had cattle and would like\r\nto have a place assigned to his people on the main shore, where\r\nthey could live by farming and fishing. We suggested Fisher River\r\nto them, which they approved of. Eventually we decided on paying\r\nthese Indians--took Thickfoot's adhesion to the treaty, of which I\r\nenclose a copy, and authorized him to notify the Indians to meet at\r\nthe Dog Head Point next summer, at a time to be intimated to them,\r\nand to request them in the mean time to select a Chief and\r\nCouncillors. Thickfoot expressed gratitude for the kindness of the\r\nGovernment, and his belief that Indians of the various Islands and\r\nof Jack Head Point would cheerfully accept the Queen's benevolence\r\nand settle on a reserve. After paying this party, and distributing\r\na small quantity of provisions among them, we resumed our voyage,\r\nand, owing to the character of the navigation, again came to anchor\r\nin George's Channel at seven o'clock, p.m. On the 29th, we left our\r\nanchorage at five o'clock a.m., and entered the mouth of the Red\r\nRiver at twelve o'clock, crossing the bar without difficulty, as\r\nthe weather was calm. We arrived at the Stone Fort at three o'clock\r\nin the afternoon, but had to remain there till next day, awaiting\r\nthe arrival of conveyances from Winnipeg. Mr. McKay and I left the\r\nStone Fort on the 30th at seven a.m. leaving our baggage and a\r\nportion of the provisions which had not been used to be forwarded\r\nby the steamer Swallow, and reached Fort Garry at ten o'clock,\r\nthus terminating a journey of over one thousand miles, and having\r\nsatisfactorily closed a treaty with the Saulteaux and Swampy Crees,\r\nwhich will prove of much importance in view of the probable rapid\r\nsettlement of the west coast of Lake Winnipeg. The journey,\r\nmoreover, is of interest, as having been the first occasion on\r\nwhich a steam vessel entered the waters of Berens River and of the\r\nNelson River, the waters of which river fall into the Hudson's Bay,\r\nand as having demonstrated the practicability of direct steam\r\nnavigation through a distance of three hundred and sixty miles from\r\nthe city of Winnipeg to Norway House. I may mention here that the\r\nprevalence of timber suitable for fuel and building purposes, of\r\nlime and sandstone, of much good soil, and natural hay lands on the\r\nwest shore of the lake, together with the great abundance of white\r\nfish, sturgeon and other fish in the lake, will ensure, ere long,\r\na large settlement.\r\n\r\nThe east coast is much inferior to the west coast, as far as\r\nI could learn, but appeared to be thickly wooded, and it is\r\nunderstood that indications of minerals have been found in several\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nI now beg to call your attention to the boundaries of the treaty,\r\nwhich, you will observe, vary somewhat from those suggested in your\r\nmemorandum to the Privy Council. The Commissioners adopted as the\r\nsouthern boundary of the treaty limits, the northern boundary of\r\nTreaties Numbers Two and Three. They included in the limits all the\r\nterritory to which the Indians ceding, claimed hunting and other\r\nrights, but they fixed the western boundary as defined in the\r\ntreaty, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1st. The extension of the boundary carries the treaty to the\r\nwestern limit of the lands claimed by the Saulteaux and Swampy Cree\r\nTribes of Indians, and creates an eastern base for the treaties to\r\nbe made with the Plain Crees next year.\r\n\r\n2nd. The Swampy Crees at the Pas, on the Saskatchewan, would\r\notherwise have had to be included in the western treaties.\r\n\r\n3rd. That the extension of the boundaries will add some six hundred\r\nto the number of Indians in the suggested limits, of whom three\r\nhundred at Wahpahhuha or the Pas on the Saskatchewan would have had\r\nto be treated with owing to the navigation of the Saskatchewan, in\r\nany event.\r\n\r\n4th. The inclusion of the Norway House Indians in the treaty, and\r\nthe surrender of their rights, involved a larger area of territory.\r\n\r\n5th. That a number of the Norway House Indians came from Moose Lake\r\nand the Cumberland region, and possessed rights there which have\r\nbeen included in the boundaries.\r\n\r\n6th. Unless the boundaries had been properly defined, in conformity\r\nwith known geographical points, a portion of the country lying\r\nbetween the territories formerly ceded and those comprised in\r\nTreaty Number Five, would have been left with the Indian title\r\nunextinguished.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the Commissioners defined the boundaries as they\r\nare laid down in the treaty, and it will remain with the Government\r\nto send a Commissioner to the Pas to obtain the adhesion of the\r\nIndians there to the treaty next summer, or not as they shall\r\ndecide, though the Commissioners strongly urge that step to be\r\ntaken as a necessity.\r\n\r\nI forward the original of the treaty to you by the Hon. Mr.\r\nChristie, and in order to the better understanding of the treaty\r\narea, I enclose a very valuable map copied from one made for me at\r\nmy request on board of the Colville, by Roderick Ross, Esq., who\r\naccompanied me from Norway House to the Stone Fort, and to whom\r\nI was indebted for much valuable assistance and co-operation, as\r\nwe were in fact to the Company's officers generally. This map is\r\nprepared from actual observation, and locates many places not\r\nindicated on any existing map, and covering as it does an area of\r\nover 100,000 square miles, which, exclusive of the great waters,\r\nhas been included in the treaty, possesses much value.\r\n\r\nI enclose herewith duplicates of the pay sheets, a statement of the\r\ncash expenditure, shewing the balance on hand of the credit which\r\nwas given me for the purposes of the treaty, and statements of the\r\ndistribution of the provisions and of the clothing, and medals,\r\nas given to the chiefs and head men. These statements will shew\r\nthat every arrangement was made to secure the utmost economy in\r\neffecting the treaty, and yet to give satisfaction to the Indians\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nI mention here that the Indians were uniformly informed that no\r\nback payments of the present would be made to those who did not\r\nattend the meetings with the Commissioners, but that next year\r\nthose not present would receive payment with the others, if they\r\npresented themselves.\r\n\r\nI have to express my sense of the services rendered to the\r\nGovernment by my associate the Hon. James McKay, and the Hon.\r\nThomas Howard, who acted as Secretary and Pay Master to the\r\nCommissioners as well as of the many kind services we received from\r\nCaptain Hackland, and the other officers of the Colville, from the\r\nWesleyan Missionaries, and from the officers of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nI take this opportunity of suggesting that the supervision of\r\nTreaty Number Five, and the carrying out of the treaty obligations\r\nwith the Indians of the St. Peter's Band, and of those of Fort\r\nAlexander and the River Roseau and Broken Head, which fall into\r\nLake Winnipeg, should be entrusted to a local agent, stationed at\r\nthe Stone Fort or in the vicinity of St. Peter's, and who would\r\nthence supervise the whole District.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have only to express the hope that the action of\r\nthe Commissioners, which in every respect was governed by a desire\r\nto promote the public interest, will receive the approval of the\r\nPrivy Council, and be regarded by them as the satisfactory\r\ndischarge of an onerous and responsible duty.\r\n\r\n                  I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                          Your obedient servant,\r\n                                 ALEXANDER MORRIS,\r\n                                     Lieut.-Gov. N. W. T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GOVERNMENT HOUSE,\r\n                          FORT GARRY 17th November, 1876.\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nSir,--I recommended in my despatch of the 7th June, that measures\r\nshould be adopted to secure the adhesion of the Indians, who had\r\nnot been met with when Treaty Number Five was concluded, and was\r\nrequested by you to entrust the duty to Mr. Graham, of the Indian\r\nDepartment here, or to the Hon. Thomas Howard, Mr. Graham was\r\nunable to leave the office. I therefore entrusted the matter to Mr.\r\nHoward and J. Lestock Reid, D.L.S. I gave these gentleman written\r\ninstructions, a copy of which will be found appended to the report\r\nof Mr. Howard, in which I directed them to meet the Island Indians\r\nand those of Berens River together, and then to separate, Mr. Reid\r\nproceeding to Norway House and Mr. Howard to the Grand Rapids of\r\nthe Saskatchewan and the Pas, this course being necessary to enable\r\nthe work to be accomplished during the season. I have pleasure in\r\ninforming you that these gentlemen discharged their mission most\r\nsuccessfully and satisfactorily, as will be seen from the following\r\nreports, which I enclose, viz:--\r\n\r\nA. Joint report of Messrs. Howard and Reid as to the Island Indians\r\nof Lake Winnipeg and those of Berens River.\r\n\r\nB. Report of Mr. Howard as to the band at the Grand Rapids, and as\r\nto his negotiations with the Indians at the Pas.\r\n\r\nC. Report of Mr. Reid with regard to the Norway House Indians.\r\n\r\nD. Report of Mr. Howard, submitting the accounts of the expenditure\r\nincurred in carrying out my instructions.\r\n\r\n1. It will appear from these reports that the Commissioners\r\nobtained the assent of the scattered bands among the islands and\r\nshores of Lake Winnipeg, and had them united in a band with one\r\nChief and his Councillors.\r\n\r\n2. That the Indians of the Grand Rapids of the Berens River\r\naccepted the treaty, being received as part of the band of Jacob\r\nBerens, and that the latter band wish their reserves to be allotted\r\nthem and some hay lands assigned.\r\n\r\n3. That the Norway House Indians contemplate removal to Fisher's\r\nRiver, on Lake Winnipeg.\r\n\r\n4. That the Indians of Grand Rapids have removed, as they agreed\r\nto do last year from the point where they had settled on the\r\nSaskatchewan, and which had been set apart as the site of a town.\r\n\r\n5. That the Indians of the Pas, Cumberland, and Moose Lake gave\r\ntheir adhesion to the treaty and, subject to the approval of the\r\nPrivy Council, have agreed upon the localities for their reserves.\r\n\r\n6. That the bands at the Grand Rapids, the Pas, and Cumberland are\r\nin a sufficiently advanced position to be allowed the grant for\r\ntheir schools.\r\n\r\nI forward herewith the balance sheet of Mr. Howard for the receipts\r\nand disbursements connected with the completion of the treaty and\r\nthe payments, as also the various vouchers in support thereof. I\r\nplaced the charge of the financial arrangements in the hands of Mr.\r\nHoward, on whom also fell the longest period of service in the work\r\nentrusted to the Commissioners.\r\n\r\nI also forward by parcel post, registered, the original of the\r\nassents to the treaty of the various bands.\r\n\r\nTo prevent complications and misunderstandings, it would be\r\ndesirable that many of the reserves should be surveyed without\r\ndelay, and, from Mr. Reid's connection with the treaty, and his\r\nfitness for the work, I think that he would be a suitable person\r\nto be employed in the duty.\r\n\r\nI would remark in conclusion, that I requested Mr. Provencher to\r\nobtain the assent to the treaty of the band at the mouth of the\r\nBlack River, and that be informs me that he obtained their adhesion\r\nand has so reported to you. The having obtained the assent of the\r\nwhole of the Indians within the region treated for so far, is a\r\nmost satisfactory feature of the year's operations.\r\n\r\n                                  I have, &c.,\r\n                                              ALEXANDER MORRIS,\r\n                                                      Lieut.-Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nWINNIPEG, October 10th, 1876.\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. ALEXANDER MORRIS,\r\n                 Lieutenant-Governor, Fort Garry.\r\n\r\nSir,--Under instructions received from you, dated 14th July last,\r\nwe were directed to proceed to the Dog Head Point and Berens River,\r\non Lake Winnipeg, and there obtain the adhesion of certain Indians\r\nto the treaty that was made and concluded at Norway House last\r\nyear, and we have now the honor to report....\r\n\r\nWith a fair wind and fine weather we reached the Narrows on Monday\r\nafternoon, the 24th, at half-past four. Mr. Howard called at the\r\nHudson's Bay Company's post to see about the provisions stored\r\nthere, where he found Thickfoot and the Jack-Fish Head Indians\r\nencamped, about twenty-five families in all, and learned from them\r\nthat they were desirous to meet and speak to us where they were,\r\nand not across the Narrows at the Dog Head; but as the place of\r\nmeeting was distinctly fixed, Mr. Howard informed them that they\r\nwould have to move their camps.\r\n\r\nMr. Reid having, in the meantime, gone to the Dog Head Point, was\r\nreceived with a salute from the Indians there encamped, viz.: the\r\nBlood Vein River, Big Island and Sandy Bar bands, and, almost\r\nsimultaneously with Mr. Howard's arrival there, the Indians\r\nbelonging to Thickfoot and the Jack-Fish Head arrived also.\r\n\r\nWe hardly had time to make our camp before being waited upon by\r\na representative from all the bands except Thickfoot's, and they\r\ndesired to know when we would be prepared to have a conference;\r\nand, having told them that the following day, the 25th, was the day\r\nappointed, and that we would meet them at eleven o'clock in the\r\nmorning, we gave them some provisions and they withdrew. Thickfoot\r\nsubsequently called upon us and stated that he was prepared at\r\nany time to meet us and sign the treaty, that he had learned that\r\nit was our intention to make only one Chief for all the Indians\r\ngathered there; that he had felt when the paper was placed in his\r\nhands last year by the Governor, that he was making him the Chief;\r\nthat he had notified all the Indians that were there as he had\r\nagreed, and that they had threatened him with violence for saying\r\nhe was to be Chief, and that he was afraid now to join them in any\r\nway, and that he and his band wished to be spoken to by themselves.\r\nUpon hearing this, we informed him that he need not be afraid of\r\nviolence, that the paper the Governor gave him merely stated that\r\nhe was a principal Indian, and we would certainly recognize him as\r\nsuch, and if the Indians desired him to be their Chief it would be\r\na great pleasure to us.\r\n\r\nThe following morning the Indians sent word by a representative\r\nfrom each band, except Thickfoot's, that they desired another day\r\nto meet in council before having a conference; but, feeling they\r\nhad sufficient time already, yet not wishing to hurry them too\r\nmuch, we extended the hour of meeting to four o'clock on the same\r\nday, which satisfied them, and when they promised to be ready.\r\n\r\nAbout three o'clock, we were informed that the Indians had\r\ngathered, so we at once proceeded to meet them. The place we had\r\nchosen for the conference was on a granite plateau, and at one end\r\nour crews had erected a covering with boughs; a more suitable spot\r\nfor the meeting could not be found.\r\n\r\nAfter inquiring if they had all gathered, and, being assured that\r\nthey had, we began to explain the object of our mission, but\r\nimmediately saw that the bands were determined to be considered\r\ndistinct and wished to be treated with separately, when we informed\r\nthem that only one Chief would be allowed, and that before we could\r\nproceed any further we would require them all to meet together\r\nin council and there select one Chief and three Councillors, and\r\nbe prepared to present them to us on the following day. This\r\nevidently gave great satisfaction to the Island Band, of which\r\nKa-tuk-e-pin-ais was head man, but they all withdrew; before doing\r\nso, agreeing to be ready the next day at noon to meet us.\r\n\r\nBefore the hour appointed for the meeting the next day, another\r\ndelegation came over and informed us that the Indians were not yet\r\nprepared, that they could not come to any decision as to who should\r\nbe Chief, and again asked to have the hour of meeting extended to\r\nthree o'clock, which we did upon the understanding that if they\r\nwere not then prepared we would return and report the facts to you.\r\n\r\nShortly after, we noticed Thickfoot and his Indians sitting near\r\nour tents, and evidently taking no part in the selection of a\r\nChief, so we called him over and found him still disinclined to\r\njoin the other Indians. He stated that they would not have him as\r\nChief, and that he would therefore remain away. We then explained\r\nthat he could be head man of his band by being elected a Councillor\r\nto whoever would be appointed Chief, and at last prevailing upon\r\nhim to go with his Indians to the Council tent, we requested the\r\nRev. Mr. Cochrane to proceed to the Indian encampment and state to\r\nthem that from each band other than the one from which the chief\r\nwas chosen, a Councillor would have to be taken. By this means\r\nwe saw our way to satisfy all the bands, and Mr. Cochrane having\r\nnotified the Indians accordingly, we felt confident the choice of\r\na chief would soon be made; but in this we were disappointed, as a\r\nmessenger shortly after arrived and said no choice could be made,\r\nas Ka-tuk-e-pin-ais would do nothing unless he was chosen Chief. On\r\nhearing this Mr. Cochrane decided to visit the Indians in Council,\r\nand, having done so, proposed to them that they should elect\r\na Chief by ballot, and having got them all to agree to this\r\nproposition, they proceeded to the election. Several ballots had\r\nto be taken, and at last resulted in favor of the chief Indian of\r\nthe Blood Vein River band, Sa-ha-cha-way-ass, and the Councillors\r\nelected were the head men from the Big Island, Doghead and\r\nJack-Fish Head bands.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock p.m., we were notified that the Indians had again\r\ngathered, when we proceeded to the place of meeting, and were\r\npresented to the Chief and two of his Councillors. Ka-tuk-e-pin-ais,\r\nthe third Councillor, coming forward, said his band did not want him\r\nto act as Councillor; that he had seen the Governor the other day, and\r\nhad been told by him that he would be the Chief of the Island Indians.\r\nWhereupon we informed him that no such promise had been made by you,\r\nand that we could only recognize the choice of the majority. He then\r\ndesired to withdraw from the negotiations, and wait until he saw you,\r\nbefore signing the treaty; but as we had learned that out of the\r\ntwenty-two families that were in his band, all, with one or two\r\nexceptions, had received the annuity since 1870, with the St. Peter's\r\nBand, we made them sit by themselves, and then explained that by\r\nreceiving the annuity as a large number of them had done, they had\r\nreally agreed to the treaty and that we were there only to deal with\r\nthose of the band that had at no time received money from the Queen.\r\nKa-tuk-e-pin-ais then said that there were very few of his Indians\r\nthat had not received money from the Queen, but that he never had;\r\nthat he was quite prepared to sign the treaty now, only some of his\r\npeople did not want him to do so, unless we agreed to give them the\r\nBig Island for a reserve. This we at once refused, and at the same\r\ntime told them that unless he and all his band agreed to the terms\r\nwe offered them without further delay, they might return to their\r\nhomes. Hearing this, they all withdrew, but soon returned, when\r\nKa-tuk-e-pin-ais said one or two of his people did not want him to\r\nsign any treaty, but most of them did, and that he was going to do so.\r\nHe then took his seat along with the Chiefs and other Councillors,\r\nand we proceeded to explain the terms of the treaty. When we came to\r\nthe clause referring to the reserves, each band was anxious that the\r\nplaces where they are in the habit of living should be granted them\r\nas reserves, and the locations of the same mentioned in the treaty;\r\nbut as our instructions were positive on this point, we refused but\r\nassured them that the names of the places they asked for, we would\r\ncertainly forward with our report to you, and we stated that with the\r\nexception of the location asked for by the Sandy Bar Indians, we felt\r\nsure the Government would grant their request, and give them their\r\nreserves where they desired. The following were the localities\r\nmentioned:--\r\n\r\n    DOG HEAD BAND.--The point opposite the Dog Head.\r\n    BLOOD VEIN RIVER BAND.--At mouth of Blood Vein River.\r\n    BIG ISLAND BAND.--At mouth of Badthroat River.\r\n    JACK-FISH HEAD BAND.--The north side of Jack Head Point, at the\r\n  Lobstick, and the\r\n    SANDY BAR BAND.--White Mud River, west side of Lake Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that four bands out of the above named,\r\nviz.:--Big Island, Jack-Fish Head, Dog Head and Blood Vein River,\r\nare distinct bands, those at Sandy Bar really belonging to the St.\r\nPeter's Band of Indians and that they have always lived at the\r\ndifferent points upon the lake from which they take their names,\r\nand they therefore look upon these points as their homes. We would,\r\ntherefore, beg to recommend that the request of of all, with the\r\nexception of the Sandy Bar Indians, be granted, although in doing\r\nso we are aware of the desire of the Government that Indians should\r\nnot be encouraged to break up into small bands, yet we feel sure in\r\nthis instance it would be impossible to get them all upon any one\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\nThe adhesion we had signed on Wednesday evening, July 26th, and\r\nwe then arranged to begin the payments of annuities the following\r\nmorning at nine o'clock, which was done, and the payments\r\ncompleted by four o'clock on the same day. We then distributed\r\nthe implements, ammunition, twine, and balance of provisions.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the Indians at Sandy Bar, were formerly paid\r\nwith the St. Peter's band. They are now included in the limits of\r\nTreaty Five, and desire to receive their annuity with the Island\r\nband.\r\n\r\nHaving distributed the presents, we immediately moved our camp\r\nto an island about a quarter of a mile from the Point, and\r\nthere remained until Saturday morning, the 29th, when, having a\r\nfavourable wind, we set sail and arrived off the mouth of Berens\r\nRiver, and camped on Lobstick Island the following morning, Sunday,\r\nat half-past nine o'clock.\r\n\r\nWe remained there until Tuesday, and then moved our camp to the\r\nMethodist Mission. The next day we went over in one of our boats\r\nto the Hudson's Bay Company's post, where we met Mr. Flett, the\r\nofficer in charge and received from him the provisions that had\r\nbeen previously forwarded and which he had in store, and then\r\nreturned to our camp.\r\n\r\nMr. Flett informed us that the Indians from the Narrows of Berens\r\nRiver, he expected would arrive that evening, and on Thursday,\r\nvisited us to say that they had arrived and were then holding a\r\ncouncil. The same afternoon the Chief and Councillors called upon\r\nus and desired to know when we would be prepared to meet them, and\r\nthough the 5th was the day appointed, we thought it advisable, as\r\nall the Indians were then gathered there, and were anxious to\r\nreturn to their homes, to appoint the following day, the 4th\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Indians came over from where they were\r\nencamped near the Hudson's Bay post, in York boats; and when we\r\nlearned that they were all in the school-house we proceeded there,\r\nand met, in addition to the Berens River band, about thirty Indians\r\nfrom the Grand Rapids of Berens River. We explained the object of\r\nour mission, and found the Indians from the Rapids most anxious to\r\naccept the Queen's bounty and benevolence, some of them had already\r\naccepted the annuity with the Lac Seule Indians we found, so we\r\nimmediately told them that it was only to those that had not\r\npreviously received money or presents from the Queen, that the\r\nfirst part of our mission extended, and with whom it was necessary\r\nwe should first speak. The head man, Num-ak-ow-ah-nuk-wape, then\r\nsaid that he was fully prepared, on behalf of all his Indians, to\r\naccept the same terms as given to the Berens River band, only be\r\nwanted his reserve where he then lived, at the Grand Rapids; upon\r\nwhich we told him that before we could speak further, we must be\r\nassured by the band that he was their head man, and this the band\r\nat once did. We then thought it advisable to recommend that they\r\nshould make the Chief of the Berens River band their Chief,\r\nand make their head man a Councillor to him, and although our\r\nproposition was not at once received satisfactorily, we ultimately\r\nprevailed upon them to accept it, and the Chief was at once\r\nelected. By this means we saved the expenses necessarily incurred\r\nin maintaining one Chief and two Councillors. We then stated that\r\nwe were prepared to grant them their reserve where they asked for\r\nit; and having explained the treaty to them, clause by clause, and\r\nmentioned in the adhesion where the reserve should be, the adhesion\r\nwas duly signed by the Chief and Councillors. The payment of the\r\nannuity was then gone on with and finished that afternoon at four\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nWe then distributed the implements, ammunition, twine and\r\nprovisions. When we had finished, the Chief and Councillors came\r\nforward, and thanked us for all that had been done for them; they\r\nsaid they were well pleased with what they had received and desired\r\nus to inform you of the fact, which we accordingly promised. They\r\nthen returned in the same boats they had come over in: before\r\nleaving the bank, giving three cheers for the Queen and three for\r\nthe Governor.\r\n\r\nWe are very much pleased to inform you that the best possible\r\nfeeling appears to exist between the Indians in this region. They\r\nall appeared anxious to farm and settle down, and we heard that a\r\nnumber of houses had been built at Poplar River, and considerable\r\nclearing done there since the treaty was made with them last year;\r\nthe implements and tools we brought them were therefore most\r\nacceptable. As these bands live at a considerable distance from\r\neach other, we would recommend that an extra supply of tools be\r\nallowed them. We also feel satisfied that the animals promised by\r\nthe treaty might be furnished, as we certainly consider them in a\r\nposition to take care of the same.\r\n\r\nAs you directed, we informed them that their application for hay\r\nlands had been forwarded to the Government, and this gave them\r\ngreat satisfaction. The following morning, Saturday, August 5th,\r\nMr. Reid left for Norway House, and during the afternoon of the\r\nsame day, Mr. Howard sailed for the Stone Fort on the Red River.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained the adhesion of the Indians at the Dog Head, and at\r\nBerens River, our duties as Joint Commissioners under your\r\ninstructions ceased....\r\n\r\nWe were fortunate enough to secure the services of the Rev. Henry\r\nCochrane, who kindly acted as interpreter. Being in the Province on\r\na visit from his mission at the Pas, and desirous of returning, Mr.\r\nHoward gave him a passage in his boat, and he rendered us the most\r\nvaluable assistance throughout.\r\n\r\nHaving thus referred to the different matters connected with our\r\nmission while acting together, and assuring you that our aim and\r\ndesire was to fulfill it to your entire satisfaction, which we\r\ntrust we have done,\r\n\r\n                We have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                       Your obedient servants,\r\n                                    THOS. HOWARD,\r\n                                    J. LESTOCK REID,\r\n                                             Commissioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\nWINNIPEG, October 10th, 1876.\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE ALEXANDER MORRIS,\r\n                 Lieutenant-Governor, Fort Garry.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to inform you that in compliance with your\r\ninstructions, a copy of which I hereunto annex, I proceeded,\r\naccompanied by Mr. Reid, to the Dog Head and Berens River on Lake\r\nWinnipeg, and there successfully secured the adhesion of the Island\r\nand Grand Rapids of Berens River Bands of Indians to Treaty Number\r\nFive, and, having paid the annuities to the Berens River Indians,\r\nreturned to the Stone Fort. As mentioned in the joint report\r\nsubmitted to you by Mr. Reid and myself, I had the greatest\r\ndifficulty in procuring a boat to take me on my mission, and only\r\nthrough the kindness of Mr. Flett, of the Hudson's Bay Company, at\r\nthe Stone Fort, was I able to obtain even the loan of one as far as\r\nBerens River, from where I had to return it....\r\n\r\nI left the Stone Fort for the Grand Rapids, on the morning of the\r\n17th of August, and after a very fast, though rough and dangerous\r\npassage, reached the mouth of the Saskatchewan river, early on the\r\nmorning of the 26th. I found, on entering the river, that the\r\nIndians were encamped near its mouth, on the south bank, where\r\nI landed, and arranged to meet them at noon that day. As the\r\nprovisions were stored at the Hudson's Bay Company's post, about a\r\nmile and a half up the river, I decided to camp at the foot of the\r\nroad leading across the four-mile Portage, and having done so, and\r\nin the meantime sent the provisions to the Indian camp, I returned\r\nthere at the time agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThe band having assembled, I stated to them the object of my\r\nmission--that I had been directed to pay them the annuity and\r\ndeliver some of the tools and implements granted them by the\r\ntreaty, and also to distribute amongst those that formerly had\r\nhouses and gardens on the north bank of the river, and had moved to\r\nwhere they were then living, as stipulated in the treaty, the sum\r\nof five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, the Chief at once expressed his astonishment at my\r\nsaying that the treaty had been made last year, and said he had\r\nonly a talk then with the Governor preliminary to making the treaty\r\nthis year, and that they were only then prepared to be treated\r\nwith. I explained to the band how I had been present myself when\r\nit was made, and that I would have it read to them. I accordingly\r\nrequested Mr. Cochrane to do so, explaining it thoroughly; yet, it\r\nwas only after a great deal of talking on their part, during which\r\nthey made most unreasonable demands, and many explanations on my\r\npart, that the Indians were satisfied that a treaty had been made,\r\nwhen they requested me to go on with the payments; at the same time\r\na number of them stated that they had been misled by one of the\r\ncounsellors, Joseph Atkinson by name. I then paid the annuity,\r\ndistributed the provisions, tools, implements, etc., and gave the\r\nChief a copy of the treaty, and, arranging to meet them again on\r\nMonday the 28th, I returned to my camp at midnight.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, I met them as agreed, and at once began and made\r\ninquiries as to who had houses and gardens on the north bank and\r\nhad moved their houses to the south bank, and I found that all\r\nthose that had formerly lived on the north bank had removed from\r\nthere. I noticed that great feeling existed amongst them all as to\r\nthe division of the five hundred dollars granted. All the band\r\ncongregated round me and the large majority desired that the amount\r\nshould be divided equally between them all, and claimed that every\r\none belonging to the band was entitled to participate in the\r\ndivision; so I thought it best to leave it to themselves to decide\r\nhow the amount should be distributed, and they only succeeded in\r\ndoing so after a great deal of talking, and, I regret to say,\r\nquarrelling; but they at last arranged it, and I was requested by\r\nthe Chief and Councillors to divide it amongst the whole band in\r\nsuch proportions as I thought right, so I proceeded at once to what\r\nturned out to be a long and troublesome undertaking; but having as\r\nI considered made a fair and equitable distribution of the amount,\r\nI paid the same, had the document witnessed by the Chief and\r\nCouncillors, and only got back to my camp again at midnight. As I\r\nbefore said, all the Indians had removed to the south bank of the\r\nriver, but had made no preparations to build, and were merely\r\nliving in tents. Close to the encampment, at the mouth of the\r\nriver, the Church Missionary Society have put up a large building\r\nto answer the purposes of a church and school-house. Care must be\r\ntaken and strict watch kept over this band. Living as they do on\r\nthe bank of a navigable river, where people are constantly passing,\r\nthey can give great trouble and annoyance, and, I am sorry to say,\r\nare inclined to do so. Several complaints were made to me while\r\nthere, and I spoke to the Indians regarding them. They promised me\r\nto abide faithfully by the terms of the treaty henceforth and not\r\ngive any further annoyance.\r\n\r\nWhile occupied paying the Indians there, my crew were engaged in\r\ntaking my boat and supplies across the Portage. They left the camp\r\nearly on Monday morning, and with the assistance kindly rendered\r\nthem by Mr. Matheson, of the Hudson's Bay Company, succeeded in\r\nreaching the north end of the Portage on Tuesday evening. That same\r\nafternoon I walked over the four-mile Portage and found there a\r\nnumber of buildings belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company. To this\r\npoint the Saskatchewan River steamer Northcote descends and\r\nreceives the supplies for the different posts belonging to the\r\nCompany to the West and North-West.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, the 30th, I left for the Pas. From the Grand\r\nRapids to the Narrows, before entering Cedar Lake, a distance of\r\neighteen or twenty miles, a continuous rapid extends, and it is\r\nonly by tracking and poling simultaneously that you are at all able\r\nto ascend the river. The first day I made only nine miles on my way\r\nand camped at the Demi Charge, and it was late in the evening on\r\nthe second day when I reached Cedar Lake. This lake is about\r\nthirty-five miles in length and is very shallow and dangerous in\r\nstormy weather. I was fortunate enough to have very calm weather,\r\nand, therefore, crossed it without any delay and entered the\r\nSaskatchewan again at the Che-ma-wa-win or \"Seining place,\" early\r\non Saturday morning, September 2nd. Noticing a large encampment of\r\nIndians there, I landed and found they were part of the Moose Lake\r\nband. They desired that I should treat with them where they were,\r\nand not bring them to the Pas, but upon my telling them that I\r\ncould only treat with them at the appointed place of meeting, they\r\nreadily assented to follow me up, and having given them some\r\nprovisions to take them there, and secured the services of one of\r\nthem to act as guide, I again started on my journey.\r\n\r\nI was then three days and two nights ascending the river, and on\r\nTuesday morning, the 5th September, the day appointed for me to\r\nmeet the Indians, I arrived at the Pas or Devon Mission, on my way\r\nup having been passed by the Indians from the Che-ma-wa-win.\r\n\r\nOn entering the river after leaving Cedar Lake the whole aspect of\r\nthe country changes, and from there to the Pas, and, I understand,\r\nfor fully one hundred miles above it, nothing but marsh can be\r\nseen; so much so that it was difficult along the bank of the river\r\nto find a spot dry enough to camp upon, and I was, consequently,\r\nobliged to eat and sleep in my boat. The dreariness of this voyage\r\ncan hardly be realized, and it was with feelings of delight that I\r\nlanded at the Mission at the Pas where the Rev. Mr. Cochrane\r\nreceived me.\r\n\r\nMr. Cochrane had accompanied me from the Stone Fort and had been in\r\nmy boat up to the night before I arrived, when, meeting some\r\nIndians that were on the look-out for us, he returned with them in\r\ntheir canoe and reached his home shortly before I arrived.\r\n\r\nThe Pas or Devon Mission is situated on the south bank of the\r\nSaskatchewan, distant, I should say, one hundred and forty miles\r\nfrom Grand Rapids. The Church Missionary Society have a very nice\r\nchurch, school-house and parsonage there; and the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany one of their posts. There are also a large number of houses\r\nbelonging to the Indians of the place; and on the other bank the\r\nfirm of Kew, Stobart & Co., have erected a store for trading\r\npurposes. There are also several dwelling-houses on the north bank.\r\nAltogether, the appearance of the place, on my arrival, was most\r\nprepossessing. The banks were covered with Indians with their\r\ncanoes, and immediately the boat rounded the point below the\r\nMission and came in view a salute was fired, the like of which, I\r\nwas subsequently told, had never been heard in the \"Ratty Country\".\r\n\r\nHaving landed at the Mission, Mr. Cochrane informed me that he had,\r\nas I requested, summoned the Indians to meet in the school-house at\r\nthree o'clock that afternoon, and when the hour arrived I proceeded\r\nthere and found upwards of five hundred Indians gathered. I stated\r\nthe object of my mission to them, and was at once assured of their\r\ndesire to accept of, and their gratitude for, the Queen's bounty\r\nand benevolence.\r\n\r\nI found that the Pas and Cumberland bands of Indians had acknowledged\r\nChiefs, but that the Moose Lake band had none, owing to a division\r\namongst them. It appeared that the Indians from the Che-ma-wa-win\r\ndesired to be a distinct band and have their reserves where I had\r\nseen them at the entrance of the river from Cedar Lake; but noticing,\r\non my way up, the unfitness of the locality for a reserve, and having\r\nlearned that at Moose Lake, where part of the band desired to live,\r\na most suitable locality could be had, I had decided before meeting\r\nthem upon the course I should take, which was, not to encourage the\r\ndivision in the band, and allow only one Chief; and this I did, and\r\nsucceeded, without much trouble, in getting the band to unite. I then\r\nrequested all the Indians to meet in council and select their Chief\r\nand head men, and be prepared the following morning to present them\r\nto me, when I would be ready to speak to them.\r\n\r\nThe next morning at eleven o'clock I met them and found they had\r\ndone as I requested, and having been presented to the Chiefs and\r\nCouncillors I proceeded to explain the terms of the treaty that I\r\ndesired to receive their adhesion to. The Chiefs immediately stated\r\nthat they wanted to make a treaty of their own, and it was only\r\nafter great difficulty that I could make them understand that in\r\nreality it was not a new treaty they were about to make.\r\n\r\nThey had heard of the terms granted the Indians at Carlton, and\r\nthis acted most prejudicially at one time against the successful\r\ncarrying out of my mission; but I at last made them understand the\r\ndifference between their position and the Plain Indians, by\r\npointing out that the land they would surrender would be useless to\r\nthe Queen, while what the Plain Indians gave up would be of value\r\nto her for homes for her white children. They then agreed to accept\r\nthe terms offered if I would agree to give them reserves where they\r\ndesired; and to their demands I patiently listened, and having at\r\nlast come to a satisfactory understanding I adjourned the meeting\r\nto the following day.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further, I would draw your attention to the\r\nlocalities I granted for reserves, subject to the approval of the\r\nGovernment, and beg to inform you that I made every inquiry as to\r\nthe extent of farming land in each locality mentioned.\r\n\r\nAt the Narrows, at Moose Lake, there is considerable good land, and\r\na suitable place for a reserve can be had for the Moose Lake band.\r\n\r\nFor the Pas and Cumberland Indians I had to mention several\r\nlocalities. At the Pas all the land obtainable is now cultivated,\r\nand consists of a vegetable garden and one field attached to the\r\nMission, and a few patches of potatoes here and there. A short\r\ndistance from the river the marsh begins, and extends to the south\r\nfor miles; and the same thing occurs to the north. In fact, on both\r\nbanks of the river at this point, and from the Che-ma-wa-win up to\r\nit, one hundred and fifty acres of land fit for cultivation cannot\r\nbe found; and about Cumberland the country in every respect is\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\nThe following day, Thursday the 7th, I met the Indians at three\r\np.m., and had the adhesion read to them and signed. I then\r\npresented the medals and clothing to the Chiefs and Councillors,\r\nwith which they were greatly pleased, and having congratulated them\r\nupon wearing the Queen's uniform, and having in return been\r\nheartily thanked by them for what had been done, I proceeded to pay\r\nthem, and continued to do so up to seven o'clock, when the funds at\r\nmy disposal being exhausted, I directed them to meet me again the\r\nfollowing morning at nine o'clock, which they did, and I completed\r\nthe payments the same evening at five o'clock. I then distributed\r\nthe balance of provisions and the ammunition and twine. The\r\nimplements and tools I had been unable to bring from Grand Rapids,\r\nmy boat being very heavily laden; but Mr. Belanger, of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company, kindly promised to have them brought up free of charge\r\nin a boat that was going to the Grand Rapids in a few days; I\r\ntherefore gave the Chief of the Pas band an order for the chest of\r\ntools and the implements.\r\n\r\nThe following day, Saturday, having again seen all the Chiefs and\r\nCouncillors and received their thanks, and after many expressions\r\nof gratitude from the Indians gathered, I left the Pas at half-past\r\ntwo o'clock p.m., and with rowing and floating alternately during\r\nthe afternoon and night, reached the Che-ma-wa-win on Sunday\r\nevening; crossed Cedar Lake on Monday, and landed at the head of\r\nGrand Rapids on Tuesday morning. I then ran the rapids and hoisted\r\nthe sail at the mouth of the river at two p.m., having called upon\r\nMr. Matheson and seen the Chief of the Indians there on my way\r\ndown. I then made all haste to return here, but, owing to contrary\r\nwinds, only succeeded in reaching the Stone Fort on the 20th\r\nSeptember, yet, having made a very quick trip, unprecedented in\r\nfact, and in carrying out the mission entrusted to me, travelled in\r\nan open boat, thirteen hundred miles.\r\n\r\nI would now inform you that three out of the four bands of Indians\r\nI met on the Saskatchewan, viz., the Grand Rapids, Pas and\r\nCumberland, are in a position to receive at once from the\r\nGovernment the grant allowed for the maintenance of schools of\r\ninstruction; at the Grand Rapids a huge school-house is by this\r\ntime entirely completed; and at the Pas and Cumberland, schools,\r\nunder the charge of the Church Missionary Society, have been in\r\nexistence some years. The Indians belonging to the bands I have\r\nnamed desired that the assistance promised should be given as soon\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nI would now mention the very valuable services rendered the\r\nGovernment by the Rev. Mr. Cochrane, who acted as interpreter at\r\nthe Dog Head, Berens River, Grand Rapids and the Pas, and who was\r\nat all times ready to give his advice and assistance; as well as by\r\nMr. A. M. Muckle, who accompanied me and assisted in making the\r\npayments; and by Mr. Nursey, who took charge of the boat with\r\nsupplies for the Pas. To Mr. Matheson, of the Hudson's Bay Company,\r\nGrand Rapids, and Mr. Belanger, of Cumberland House, I am deeply\r\nindebted, and take this opportunity of tendering these gentlemen my\r\nsincere thanks for the assistance rendered me and the many\r\nkindnesses I received from them. I enclose herewith the pay-sheet\r\nof the different bands I paid, a statement of the cash expenditure,\r\nand statements shewing quantities of provisions, implements, etc.,\r\nreceived and how distributed, with a statement of clothing, medals,\r\netc., given to the Chiefs and Councillors, and a report I received\r\nfrom Mr. Bedson.\r\n\r\nAnd, trusting that the manner in which I have carried out the\r\nmission entrusted to my care, may meet with your approval,\r\n\r\n                  I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                            Your obedient servant,\r\n                                   THOMAS HOWARD,\r\n                                         Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT GARRY, July 14th, 1876.\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. THOS. HOWARD AND J. LESTOCK REID, ESQ.\r\n\r\nDear sirs,--Under authority from the Minister of the Interior, I\r\nhave to request you to proceed to Lake Winnipeg for the purpose\r\nof--on behalf of the Privy Council of Canada--securing the adhesion\r\nto Treaty Number Five of the Indians who have not yet been dealt\r\nwith, and to make the necessary payments to the others.\r\n\r\n1st. You will, if possible, together proceed to or meet at the\r\nfollowing places, being there on the days named, viz.: Dog Head\r\nPoint, 25th July, and Berens River on the 5th August.\r\n\r\n2nd. Mr. Howard will then proceed to the mouth of the Saskatchewan,\r\nso as to reach there on the 25th of August, and then arrive at the\r\nPas on the 5th of September.\r\n\r\n3rd. Mr. Reid will proceed from Berens River to Norway House, to\r\narrive there on or before the 25th of August.\r\n\r\n4th. You or either of you will secure the adhesion of the Island\r\nIndians to the treaty after the form annexed, and will request them\r\nto select a Chief and three Councillors, and will be authorized to\r\npromise them a reserve of one hundred and sixty acres to each\r\nfamily of five, or that proportion for larger or smaller families,\r\nto be selected for them by the person chosen for that end by the\r\nPrivy Council with their approval.\r\n\r\n5th. You or either of you will obtain the adhesion of the Indians\r\nof the Grand Rapids of Berens River to the treaty according to the\r\nform annexed. You will ask them to select a Chief and three\r\nCouncillors. A similar provision will be made as to a reserve, but\r\nif necessary you can fix the locality at the Sandy Narrows above\r\nthe rapids on the Berens River, reserving free navigation and\r\naccess to the shores to all Her Majesty's subjects.\r\n\r\n6th. Mr. Reid will pay the Norway House and Cross Lake Indians, and\r\nwill ascertain the intentions of the Norway House Indians as to the\r\ntime of their removal to Fisher River, of which I am unadvised.\r\n\r\n7th. Mr. Howard will pay the Indians at the mouth of the\r\nSaskatchewan, and if the Indians have removed their houses, as\r\nagreed by the treaty, will pay them five hundred dollars, but if\r\nnot and some have removed, will pay such their proportionate share\r\nof the five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n8th. You will distribute the implements, tools, etc. sent among the\r\nIndians, as also the ammunition and twine. Cattle cannot be given\r\ntill the Indians are sufficiently settled on the reserves to make\r\nit seem that they will be cared for. You will report any cases\r\nwhere you find this to be the case, for future action.\r\n\r\n9th. You will inform the Berens River Indians that their application\r\nfor a hay reserve has been forwarded to the Privy Council by me, and\r\nthat they will receive a reply hereafter.\r\n\r\n10th. Mr. Howard will secure the adhesion of the Indians at the\r\nPas to the treaty providing that reserves of one hundred and sixty\r\nacres to each family of five will be granted at places selected for\r\nthem by an officer of the Privy Council, with their approval; but\r\nit will probably be necessary to give them a reserve at the Pas\r\nwhere they reside, reserving carefully free navigation and access\r\nto the shores. As the extent of land there is very narrow, it may\r\nbe desirable to indicate localities where farming reserves will be\r\ngranted subject to the approval of the Privy Council.\r\n\r\n11th. The Moose Lake Indians are a distinct band, and will probably\r\ndesire the recognition of two separate Chiefs and the allotment of\r\nseparate reserves to them.\r\n\r\n12th. The Cumberland House Indians are another band, but very much\r\nscattered; the question of a reserve will have to be considered,\r\nand, in connection with it, as in other cases, respect for actual,\r\nbona fide, substantial improvements, and for the rights of\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\n13th. In all cases the places indicated for reserves to be subject\r\nto Her Majesty's approval in Council, and free navigation and\r\naccess to the shores to be reserved.\r\n\r\n14th. In the case of new adhesions to the treaty, which are in fact\r\nnew treaties, only five dollars is to be paid, but persons\r\nbelonging to bands treated with last year are to receive last\r\nyear's payment, if then absent, if necessary.\r\n\r\n15th. You will each take with you a suitable person, to be approved\r\nof by me, to assist you in the payment.\r\n\r\n             I have the honor to be,\r\n                      Your obedient servant,\r\n                             ALEXANDER MORRIS,\r\n                                  Lieut.-Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\nWINNIPEG, October 14th 1876.\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. ALEXANDER MORRIS,\r\n                      Lieut.-Governor.\r\n\r\nSir,--Referring to your letter of instructions under date of the\r\n14th of July, relative to the payment of the Norway House and Cross\r\nLake bands of Indians, I have the honor to submit the following\r\nreport:--\r\n\r\nHaving, in co-operation with the Hon. Thomas Howard, paid the\r\nIndians of Berens River and successfully secured the adhesion of\r\nthe Island and Upper Berens River bands of Indians to Treaty Number\r\nFive, on the morning of Saturday, the 5th of August, I left for\r\nNorway House, which place, owing to stormy weather and strong head\r\nwinds, I did not succeed in reaching until the morning of the 12th.\r\nOn the way I was met by Indians proceeding to inspect their reserve\r\nat Fisher's River, who brought a letter from the Chiefs of Norway\r\nHouse and Cross Lake, stating that the Indians were all assembled,\r\nand requesting to be paid at the earliest possible date.\r\n\r\nOn reaching this place, Norway House, after having camp pitched at\r\na short distance from the fort, I dispatched messengers to the\r\nseveral camps and villages, notifying the Indians of my arrival and\r\ndesiring the Chiefs to meet me on the Monday morning following. On\r\nSunday evening divine service was held within the fort by the Rev.\r\nMr. Ruttan, Wesleyan missionary, at which a large number of Indians\r\nwere present.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, the Chiefs and most of the Indians of both bands\r\nhaving assembled at my camp, the Cross Lake band requested to be\r\npaid there, and the Norway House Chief asked that his people might\r\nhe paid in the school-house in their village about two miles from\r\nthe fort. On hearing that all the Indians that could come were\r\nassembled, I consented to pay them where they desired, and told the\r\nCross Lake Chief to bring his people at noon to receive their\r\ngratuities, the payment which was satisfactorily completed the same\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe next day I crossed over to the Indian village and paid the\r\nNorway House bands their annuities....\r\n\r\nThe following morning, Wednesday, August 16th, the Chiefs and\r\nIndians of the two bands having assembled at my camp, I distributed\r\nthe provisions implements, &c., which were received with the\r\ngreatest degree of gratification and satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOn my inquiring of the Chief of Norway House when his band would be\r\nprepared to remove to their reserve at the Fisher River, he\r\ninformed me that he had sent two of his people to that locality to\r\nreport on the same, and that he could not say anything definite on\r\nthe matter until their return. I might here state that, on my way\r\nback to Winnipeg I met these men returning from Fisher's River, who\r\nexpressed themselves as highly pleased with the proposed location,\r\nand that the band in all probability would remove there in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nWhilst at Norway House I was waited upon by a Chief and four\r\nCouncillors from the vicinity of Oxford House, who were anxious to\r\nknow if the same bounties would be extended to them as were being\r\nextended to their brethren of Norway House and Cross Lake, and\r\nalso whether they could obtain a reserve on Lake Winnipeg, as\r\nthe country in which they were living was totally unfit for\r\ncultivation, and that they had the greatest difficulty in procuring\r\na livelihood. I told them that I had no idea what were the\r\nintentions of the Government with regard to those Indians living\r\nnorth of the present Treaty, but that I would make known their\r\nrequests to Your Excellency, and that they would be duly notified\r\nof any action the Government might take in the matter.\r\n\r\nI left Norway House on my return trip, on the morning of the 18th,\r\narriving at Winnipeg on the afternoon of Saturday the 26th, having\r\nthat morning paid my boat's crew off at Selkirk.\r\n\r\nI would here mention that previous to my departure from Norway\r\nHouse there was a very hearty and apparently sincere expression of\r\ngratitude, on the part of all the Indians present, for the\r\nliberality extended to them, and a general and spoken wish that\r\ntheir thanks be conveyed to the Queen's Representative in this\r\nProvince for his kind interest in their welfare.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude without bearing testimony to the kindness of Mr.\r\nRoss, Hudson's Bay Company's Factor, and the Rev. Mr. Ruttan,\r\nWesleyan missionary, for services rendered during the few days\r\noccupied in my making the payments at Norway House.\r\n\r\nI enclose herewith statement of expenditure, &c., &c., with\r\nvouchers attached.\r\n\r\n           I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                       Your obedient servant,\r\n                                  J. LESTOCK REID,\r\n                                         Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE TREATIES AT FORTS CARLTON AND PITT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe treaties made at Forts Carlton and Pitt in the year 1876, were\r\nof a very important character.\r\n\r\nThe great region covered by them, abutting on the areas included in\r\nTreaties Numbers Three and Four, embracing an area of approximately\r\n120,000 square miles, contains a vast extent of fertile territory\r\nand is the home of the Cree nation. The Crees had, very early after\r\nthe annexation of the North-West Territories to Canada, desired a\r\ntreaty of alliance with the Government. So far back as the year\r\n1871, Mr. Simpson, the Indian Commissioner, addressing the\r\nSecretary of State in a despatch of date, the 3rd November, 1871,\r\nused the following language:\r\n\r\n\"I desire also to call the attention of His Excellency to the state\r\nof affairs in the Indian country on the Saskatchewan. The\r\nintelligence that Her Majesty is treating with the Chippewa Indians\r\nhas already reached the ears of the Cree and Blackfeet tribes. In\r\nthe neighborhood of Fort Edmonton, on the Saskatchewan, there is a\r\nrapidly increasing population of miners and other white people, and\r\nit is the opinion of Mr. W. J. Christie, the officer in charge of\r\nthe Saskatchewan District, that a treaty with the Indians of that\r\ncountry, or at least an assurance during the coming year that a\r\ntreaty will shortly be made, is essential to the peace, if not the\r\nactual retention, of the country. I would refer His Excellency, on\r\nthis subject, to the report of Lieut. Butler, and to the enclosed\r\nmemoranda of Mr. W. J. Christie, the officer above alluded to.\"\r\n\r\nHe also enclosed an extract of a letter from Mr. Christie, then\r\nChief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, and subsequently one of\r\nthe Treaty Commissioners, in which, he forwarded the messages of\r\nthe Cree Chiefs to Lieut.-Gov. Archibald, \"our Great Mother's\r\nrepresentative at Fort Garry, Red River Settlement.\" This extract\r\nand messages are as follows.\r\n\r\nEDMONTON HOUSE, 13th April, 1871.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th instant (April) I had a visit from the Cree Chiefs,\r\nrepresenting the Plain Crees from this to Carlton, accompanied by\r\na few followers.\r\n\r\nThe object of their visit was to ascertain whether their lands\r\nhad been sold or not, and what was the intention of the Canadian\r\nGovernment in relation to them. They referred to the epidemic\r\nthat had raged throughout the past summer, and the subsequent\r\nstarvation, the poverty of their country, the visible diminution\r\nof the buffalo, their sole support, ending by requesting certain\r\npresents at once, and that I should lay their case before Her\r\nMajesty's representative at Fort Garry. Many stories have reached\r\nthese Indians through various channels, ever since the transfer of\r\nthe North-West Territories to the Dominion of Canada, and they were\r\nmost anxious to hear from myself what had taken place.\r\n\r\nI told them that the Canadian Government had as yet made no\r\napplication for their lands or hunting grounds, and when anything\r\nwas required of them, most likely Commissioners would be sent\r\nbeforehand to treat with them, and that until then they should\r\nremain quiet and live at peace with all men. I further stated that\r\nCanada, in her treaties with Indians, heretofore, had dealt most\r\nliberally with them, and that they were now in settled houses and\r\nwell off, and that I had no doubt in settling with them the same\r\nliberal policy would be followed.\r\n\r\nAs I was aware that they had heard many exaggerated stories about\r\nthe troops in Red River, I took the opportunity of telling them why\r\ntroops had been sent, and if Her Majesty sent troops to the\r\nSaskatchewan, it was as much for the protection of the red as the\r\nwhite man, and that they would be for the maintenance of law and\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThey were highly satisfied with the explanations offered, and said\r\nthey would welcome civilization. As their demands were complied\r\nwith, and presents given to them, their immediate followers, and\r\nfor the young men left in camp, they departed well pleased for the\r\npresent tune, with fair promises for the future. At a subsequent\r\ninterview with the Chiefs alone, they requested that I should write\r\ndown their words, or messages to their Great Master in Red River. I\r\naccordingly did so, and have transmitted the messages as delivered.\r\nCopies of the proclamation issued, prohibiting the traffic in\r\nspirituous liquors to Indians or others, and the use of strychnine\r\nin the destruction of animal life, have been received, and due\r\npublicity given to them. But without any power to enforce these\r\nlaws, it is almost useless to publish them here; and I take this\r\nopportunity of most earnestly soliciting, on behalf of the\r\nCompany's servants, and settlers in this district, that protection\r\nbe afforded to life and property here as soon as possible, and that\r\nCommissioners be sent to speak with the Indians on behalf of the\r\nCanadian Government.\r\n\r\nMEMORANDA:\r\n\r\nHad I not complied with the demands of the Indians--giving them\r\nsome little presents--and otherwise satisfied them, I have no doubt\r\nthat they would have proceeded to acts of violence, and once that\r\nhad commenced, there would have been the beginning of an Indian\r\nwar, which it is difficult to say when it would have ended.\r\n\r\nThe buffalo will soon be exterminated, and when starvation comes,\r\nthese Plain Indian tribes will fall back on the Hudson's Bay Forts\r\nand settlements for relief and assistance. If not complied with, or\r\nno steps taken to make some provision for them, they will most\r\nassuredly help themselves; and there being no force or any law up\r\nthere to protect the settlers, they must either quietly submit to\r\nbe pillaged, or lose their lives in the defence of their families\r\nand property, against such fearful odds that will leave no hope for\r\ntheir side.\r\n\r\nGold may be discovered in paying quantities, any day, on the\r\neastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. We have, in Montana, and in\r\nthe mining settlements close to our boundary line, a large mixed\r\nfrontier population, who are now only waiting and watching to hear\r\nof gold discoveries to rush into the Saskatchewan, and, without any\r\nform of Government or established laws up there, or force to\r\nprotect whites or Indians, it is very plain what will be the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nI think that the establishment of law and order in the Saskatchewan\r\nDistrict, as early as possible, is of most vital importance to the\r\nfuture of the country and the interest of Canada, and also the\r\nmaking of some treaty or settlement with the Indians who inhabit\r\nthe Saskatchewan District.\r\n\r\n                W. J. CHRISTIE, Chief Factor,\r\n                        In charge of Saskatchewan District,\r\n                                        Hudson's Bay Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMessages from the Cree Chiefs of the Plains, Saskatchewan, to His\r\nExcellency Governor Archibald, our Great Mother's representative at\r\nFort Garry, Red River Settlement.\r\n\r\n1. The Chief Sweet Grass, The Chief of the country.\r\n\r\nGREAT FATHER,--I shake hands with you, and bid you welcome. We\r\nheard our lands were sold and we did not like it; we don't want to\r\nsell our lands; it is our property, and no one has a right to sell\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOur country is getting ruined of fur-bearing animals, hitherto our\r\nsole support, and now we are poor and want help--we want you to\r\npity us. We want cattle, tools, agricultural implements, and\r\nassistance in everything when we come to settle--our country is no\r\nlonger able to support us.\r\n\r\nMake provision for us against years of starvation. We have had\r\ngreat starvation the past winter, and the small-pox took away many\r\nof our people, the old, young, and children.\r\n\r\nWe want you to stop the Americans from coming to trade on our\r\nlands, and giving firewater, ammunition and arms to our enemies the\r\nBlackfeet.\r\n\r\nWe made a peace this winter with the Blackfeet. Our young men are\r\nfoolish, it may not last long.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to come and see us and to speak with us. If you can't\r\ncome yourself, send some one in your place.\r\n\r\nWe send these words by our Master, Mr. Christie, in whom we have\r\nevery confidence.--That is all.\r\n\r\n2. Ki-he-win, The Eagle.\r\n\r\nGREAT FATHER,--Let us be friendly. We never shed any white man's\r\nblood, and have always been friendly with the whites, and want\r\nworkmen, carpenters and farmers to assist us when we settle. I want\r\nall my brother, Sweet Grass, asks. That is all.\r\n\r\n3. The Little Hunter.\r\n\r\nYou, my brother, the Great Chief in Red River, treat me as a\r\nbrother, that is, as a Great Chief.\r\n\r\n4. Kis-ki-on, or Short Tail.\r\n\r\nMy brother, that is coming close, I look upon you, as if I saw you;\r\nI want you to pity me, and I want help to cultivate the ground for\r\nmyself and descendants. Come and see us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe North-West Council, as already elsewhere stated, had urged\r\nthe making of treaties with these Indians, and the necessity\r\nof doing so, was also impressed upon the Privy Council, by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, and Col. French,\r\nthen in command of the Mounted Police therein. The Minister of the\r\nInterior, the Hon. David Mills, in his Report for the year 1876,\r\nthus alluded to this subject:\r\n\r\n\"Official reports received last year from His Honor Governor Morris\r\nand Colonel French, the officer then in command of the Mounted\r\nPolice Force, and from other parties, showed that a feeling of\r\ndiscontent and uneasiness prevailed very generally amongst the\r\nAssiniboines and Crees lying in the unceded territory between the\r\nSaskatchewan and the Rocky Mountains. This state of feeling, which\r\nhad prevailed amongst these Indians for some years past, had been\r\nincreased by the presence, last summer, in their territory of the\r\nparties engaged in the construction of the telegraph line, and\r\nin the survey of the Pacific Railway line, and also of a party\r\nbelonging to the Geological Survey. To allay this state of feeling,\r\nand to prevent the threatened hostility of the Indian tribes to the\r\nparties then employed by the Government, His Honor Governor Morris\r\nrequested and obtained authority to despatch a messenger to convey\r\nto these Indians the assurance that Commissioners would be sent\r\nthis summer, to negotiate a treaty with them, as had already been\r\ndone with their brethren further east.\r\n\r\n\"The Rev. George McDougall, who had been resident as a missionary\r\namongst these Indians for upwards of fourteen years, and who\r\npossessed great influence over them, was selected by His Honor to\r\nconvey this intelligence to the Indians, a task which he performed\r\nwith great fidelity and success: being able to report on his return\r\nthat although he found the feeling of discontent had been very\r\ngeneral among the Indian tribes, he had been enabled entirely to\r\nremove it by his assurance of the proposed negotiations during the\r\ncoming year.\r\n\r\n\"For the purpose of negotiating this treaty with the Indians, Your\r\nExcellency availed yourself of the services of His Honor Governor\r\nMorris, who had been formerly employed in negotiating Treaties\r\nNumbers Three, Four and Five. With him were associated the Hon.\r\nJames McKay and W. J. Christie, Esq., both of whom had had\r\nconsiderable experience in such work, and possessed moreover an\r\nintimate acquaintance with the Indians of the Saskatchewan, their\r\nwants, habits and dialects.\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to the Rev. George McDougall, [Footnote: This\r\nfaithful missionary came to an untimely death on the plains during\r\nthe succeeding winter. Having missed his way to his camp, he was\r\nfound lying dead on the snow, and there in the lonely wilds was\r\nclosed a most useful career.] I may here state, that when the\r\napplication was made to him, to visit the Indians of the Plains, in\r\nthe Sask atchewan Valley, he was on his way, with his family, to his\r\ndistant mission, among the Assiniboines, near the Rocky Mountains,\r\nafter a brief sojourn in the Province of Ontario, but on the\r\nrequest being made to him, to explain to the Indians the intentions\r\nof the Government, he at once undertook the duty, and leaving\r\nhis family to follow him, went upon the long journey, which his\r\nmission involved, carrying with him a letter missive from the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, promising the\r\nIndians, that Commissioners would visit them during the ensuing\r\nsummer, to confer with them as to a treaty. The result of his\r\ntour, and of the tidings which he bore was very gratifying, as the\r\nIndians were at once tranquilized, and awaited in full confidence,\r\nthe coming of the Commissioners. The way in which he discharged his\r\nimportant duties and the success which followed his exertions, will\r\nbe best set forth by giving place to his Report, addressed to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, of the results of his arduous mission:\r\n\r\n                 MORLEYVILLE, BOW RIVER, ROCKY MOUNTAINS,\r\n                                     October 23rd, 1875.\r\n\r\nTO HIS HONOR LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR MORRIS.\r\n\r\nSir,--In accordance with my instructions, I proceeded with as\r\nlittle delay as possible to Carlton, in the neighborhood of which\r\nplace I met with forty tents of Crees. From these I ascertained\r\nthat the work I had undertaken would be much more arduous than I\r\nhad expected, and that the principal camps would be found on the\r\nsouth branch of the Saskatchewan and Red Deer Rivers. I was also\r\ninformed by these Indians that the Crees and Plain Assiniboines\r\nwere united on two points: 1st. That they would not receive any\r\npresents from Government until a definite time for treaty was\r\nstated. 2nd. Though they deplored the necessity of resorting to\r\nextreme measures, yet they were unanimous in their determination\r\nto oppose the running of lines, or the making of roads through\r\ntheir country, until a settlement between the Government and them\r\nhad been effected. I was further informed that the danger of a\r\ncollision with the whites was likely to arise from the officious\r\nconduct of minor Chiefs who were anxious to make themselves\r\nconspicuous, the principal men of the large camps being much more\r\nmoderate in their demands. Believing this to be the fact, I\r\nrevolved to visit every camp and read them your message, and in\r\norder that your Honor may form a correct judgment of their\r\ndisposition towards the Government, I will give you a synopsis of\r\ntheir speeches after the message was read. Mistahwahsis, head Chief\r\nof the Carlton Indians, addressing the principal Chief of the\r\nAssiniboines and addressing me, said: \"That is just it, that is all\r\nwe wanted.\" The Assiniboines addressing me, said: \"My heart is full\r\nof gratitude, foolish men have told us that the Great Chief would\r\nsend his young men to our country until they outnumbered us, and\r\nthat then he would laugh at us, but this letter assures us that the\r\nGreat Chief will act justly toward us.\"\r\n\r\nBeardy, or the Hairy Man, Chief of the Willow Indians, said: \"If I\r\nhad heard these words spoken by the Great Queen I could not have\r\nbelieved them with more implicit faith than I do now.\" The Sweet\r\nGrass was absent from camp when I reached the Plain Crees, but\r\nhis son and the principal men of the tribe requested me to convey\r\nto the Great Chief, at Red River, their thanks for the presents\r\nreceived, and they expressed the greatest loyalty to the government.\r\nIn a word, I found the Crees reasonable in their demands, and\r\nanxious to live in peace with the white men. I found the Big Bear,\r\na Saulteaux, trying to take the lead in their council. He formerly\r\nlived at Jack Fish Lake, and for years has been regarded as a\r\ntroublesome fellow. In his speech he said: \"We want none of the\r\nQueen's presents; when we set a fox-trap we scatter pieces of meat\r\nall round, but when the fox gets into the trap we knock him on the\r\nhead; we want no bait, let your Chiefs come like men and talk to\r\nus.\" These Saulteaux are the mischief-makers through all this\r\nwestern country, and some of them are shrewd men.\r\n\r\nA few weeks since, a land speculator wished to take a claim at the\r\ncrossing on Battle River and asked the consent of the Indians, one\r\nof my Saulteaux friends sprang to his feet, and pointing to the\r\neast, said: \"Do you see that great white man (the Government)\r\ncoming?\" \"No,\" said the speculator. \"I do,\" said the Indian, \"and I\r\nhear the tramp of the multitude behind him, and when he comes you\r\ncan drop in behind him and take up all the land claims you want;\r\nbut until then I caution you to put up no stakes in our country.\"\r\nIt was very fortunate for me that Big Bear and his party were a\r\nvery small minority in camp. The Crees said they would have driven\r\nthem out of camp long ago, but were afraid of their medicines, as\r\nthey are noted conjurers.\r\n\r\nThe topics generally discussed at their council and which will be\r\nbrought before the Commissioner are as follows in their own\r\nlanguage. \"Tell the Great Chief that we are glad the traders are\r\nprohibited bringing spirits into our country; when we see it we\r\nwant to drink it, and it destroys us; when we do not see it we do\r\nnot think about it. Ask for us a strong law, prohibiting the free\r\nuse of poison (strychnine). It has almost exterminated the animals\r\nof our country, and often makes us bad friends with our white\r\nneighbors. We further request, that a law be made, equally\r\napplicable to the Half-breed and Indian, punishing all parties who\r\nset fire to our forest or plain. Not many years ago we attributed a\r\nprairie fire to the malevolence of an enemy, now every one is\r\nreckless in the use of fire, and every year large numbers of\r\nvaluable animals and birds perish in consequence. We would farther\r\nask that our chiefships be established by the Government. Of late\r\nyears almost every trader sets up his own Chief and the result is\r\nwe are broken up into little parties, and our best men are no\r\nlonger respected.\" I will state in connection with this, some of\r\nthe false reports I had to combat in passing through this country,\r\nall calculated to agitate the native mind. In the neighborhood of\r\nCarlton an interested party went to considerable trouble to inform\r\nthe Willow Indians that I had $3,000 for each band, as a present\r\nfrom the Government, and nothing in my long journey gave me greater\r\nsatisfaction than the manner in which these Indians received my\r\nexplanation of the contents of my letter of instructions. At the\r\nBuffalo Lake I found both Indians and Half-breeds greatly agitated.\r\nA gentlemen passing through their country had told them that the\r\nMounted Police had received orders to prevent all parties killing\r\nbuffalo or other animals, except during three months in the year,\r\nand these are only samples of the false statements made by parties\r\nwho would rejoice to witness a conflict of races.\r\n\r\nThat your Honor's message was most timely, these are ample proofs.\r\n\r\nA report will have reached you before this time that parties have\r\nbeen turned back by the Indians, and that a train containing\r\nsupplies for the telegraph contractors, when west of Fort Pitt,\r\nwere met by three Indians and ordered to return. Now after\r\ncarefully investigating the matter and listening to the statements\r\nof all parties concerned, my opinion is, that an old traveller\r\namongst Indians would have regarded the whole affair as too trivial\r\nto be noticed. I have not met with a Chief who would bear with the\r\nresponsibility of the act....\r\n\r\nPersonally I am indebted both to the missionaries, and the Hudson's\r\nBay Company's officials for their assistance at the Indian\r\ncouncils.\r\n\r\nBelieving it would be satisfactory to your Honor and of service to\r\nthe Commissioners, I have kept the number of all the tents visited\r\nand the names of the places where I met the Indians. [Footnote: The\r\nnumber of Indians, as estimated by Mr. McDougall, as being visited\r\nby him, was 3,976.]\r\n\r\nBy reckoning eight persons to each tent, we will have a very close\r\napproximate to the number of Indians to be treated with at Carlton,\r\nand Fort Pitt. There may have been a few tents in the forest, and I\r\nhave heard there are a few Crees at Lesser Slave Lake and Lac la\r\nBiche, but the number cannot exceed twenty tents.\r\n\r\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\nG. McDOUGALL.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners, in the discharge of their task, had to travel\r\nthrough the prairie district in going to their destination and\r\nreturning to Winnipeg, a distance of over 1,800 miles. They\r\nfirst met the Indians in the vicinity of Fort Carlton, on the\r\nSaskatchewan, in the month of August, 1876, and eventually\r\nsucceeded on the 23rd day of that month, in effecting a treaty with\r\nthe Plain and Wood Crees, and on the 28th of the same month with\r\nthe tribe of Willow Crees. The negotiations were difficult and\r\nprotracted. The Hon. David Mills, then Minister of the Interior,\r\nin his Annual Report thus characterizes them:--\"In view of the\r\ntemper of the Indians of the Saskatchewan, during the past year,\r\nand of the extravagant demands which they were induced to prefer\r\non certain points, it needed all the temper, tact, judgment and\r\ndiscretion, of which the Commissioners were possessed, to bring\r\nthe negotiations to a satisfactory issue.\" The difficulties were\r\nencountered chiefly at Carlton: The main body of the Crees were\r\nhonestly disposed to treat, and their head Chiefs, Mistowasis and\r\nAh-tuk-uh-koop, shewed sound judgment, and an earnest desire to\r\ncome to an understanding.\r\n\r\nThey were embarrassed, however, by the action of the Willow Crees,\r\nwho, under the guidance of one of their Chiefs, Beardy, interposed\r\nevery obstacle to the progress of the treaty, and refused to attend\r\nthe Council, unless it was held at the top of a hill some miles\r\noff, where the Chief pretended it had been revealed to him in a\r\nvision that the treaty was to be made. The Willow Crees were,\r\nmoreover, under the influence of a wandering band of Saulteaux,\r\nthe chief portion of whom resided within the limits of the other\r\ntreaties, and who were disposed to be troublesome. Before the\r\narrival of the Commissioners, the Saulteaux conceived the idea of\r\nforming a combination of the French Half-breeds, the Crees, and\r\nthemselves, to prevent the crossing of the Saskatchewan by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, and his entrance into the Indian territories.\r\nThey made the proposal first to the French Half-breeds, who\r\ndeclined to undertake it, and then to the Crees, who listened to it\r\nin silence. One of them at length arose, and pointing to the River\r\nSaskatchewan, said, \"Can you stop the flow of that river?\" The\r\nanswer was, \"No,\" and the rejoinder was \"No more can you stop the\r\nprogress of the Queen's Chief.\" When the Commissioners arrived at\r\nthe Saskatchewan, a messenger from the Crees met them, proffering a\r\nsafe convoy, but it was not needed. About a hundred traders' carts\r\nwere assembled at the crossing, and Kissowayis, a native Indian\r\ntrader, had the right of passage, which he at once waived, in\r\nfavor of Messrs. Christie and Morris, the Commissioners. The other\r\nCommissioner, Mr. McKay, met them at Duck Lake next day, having\r\nproceeded by another route, and there they encountered Chief\r\nBeardy, who at once asked the Lieutenant-Governor to make the\r\ntreaty at the hill, near the lake. On his guard, however, he\r\nreplied, that he would meet the Cree nation wherever they desired,\r\nbut must first go on and see them at Carlton, as he had appointed.\r\nAn escort of Mounted Police also met the Commissioners at Duck\r\nLake, having been sent from Carlton, in consequence of the\r\ninformation given by the Crees of the threatened interference\r\nwith their progress. After several days' delay the Commissioners\r\nwere obliged to meet the Crees without the Willow Crees. But after\r\nthe conference had opened, the Beardy sent a message asking to\r\nbe informed of the terms the Commissioners intended to offer in\r\nadvance. The reply was that the messenger could sit with the other\r\nIndians, and report to his Chief what he heard, as it was his own\r\nfault that the Chief was not there to take part in the proceedings.\r\nThe negotiations then went on quietly and deliberately, the\r\nCommissioners giving the Indians all the time they desired. The\r\nIndians were apprehensive of their future. They saw the food\r\nsupply, the buffalo, passing away, and they were anxious and\r\ndistressed. They knew the large terms granted to their Indians by\r\nthe United States, but they had confidence in their Great Mother,\r\nthe Queen, and her benevolence.\r\n\r\nThey desired to be fed. Small-pox had destroyed them by hundreds\r\na few years before, and they dreaded pestilence and famine.\r\n\r\nEventually the Commissioners made them an offer. They asked this\r\nto be reduced to writing, which was done, and they asked time to\r\nconsider it, which was of course granted. When the conference\r\nresumed, they presented a written counter-proposal. This the\r\nCommissioners considered, and gave full and definite answers of\r\nacceptance or refusal to each demand, which replies were carefully\r\ninterpreted, two of the Commissioners, Messrs. Christie and McKay,\r\nbeing familiar with the Cree tongue, watching how the answers were\r\nrendered, and correcting when necessary. The food question, was\r\ndisposed of by a promise, that in the event of a National famine or\r\npestilence such aid as the Crown saw fit would be extended to them,\r\nand that for three years after they settled on their reserves,\r\nprovisions to the extent of $1,000 per annum would be granted them\r\nduring seed-time.\r\n\r\nThe other terms were analogous to those of the previous treaties.\r\nThe Crees accepted the revised proposals. The treaty was\r\ninterpreted to them carefully, and was then signed, and the payment\r\nmade in accordance therewith. After the conclusion of the treaty,\r\nthe Commissioners were unwilling that the Willow Crees should\r\nremain out of the treaty, and sent a letter to them by a messenger,\r\nPierre Levailler, that they would meet them half way, at the\r\ncamp of the Hon. James McKay, and give them the opportunity of\r\naccepting the terms of the treaty already concluded. The letter\r\nwas translated to the Indians by the Rev. Pere Andre, a Catholic\r\nmissionary, who, as well as M. Levailler, urged the Indians to\r\naccede to the proposal made to them, which they agreed to do. The\r\nCommissioners met the Indians accordingly, at the place proposed,\r\nand received, after a full discussion, the adhesion of the three\r\nChiefs and head men of the Willow Crees to the treaty, and the\r\npayments were then made to them.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners then prepared to leave for Fort Pitt, but having\r\nbeen apprised by the Rev. Mr. Scollan, a Catholic missionary, who\r\nhad been sent by Bishop Grandin, to be present at the making of the\r\ntreaty, that Sweet Grass, the principal Chief of the Plain Crees,\r\nat Fort Pitt, was unaware of the place and time of meeting, they\r\ndespatched a messenger to apprise him of them, and request him to\r\nbe present.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners crossed the Saskatchewan and journeyed to Fort\r\nPitt. Near it they were met by an escort of Mounted Police, who\r\nconvoyed them to the fort.\r\n\r\nThere they found a number of Indians assembled, and, during the\r\nday, Sweet Grass arrived. In the evening the Chief and head men\r\nwaited upon the Commissioners. Delay was asked and granted before\r\nmeeting. Eventually the conference was opened. The ceremonies which\r\nattended it were imposing. The national stem or pipe dance was\r\nperformed, of which a full narrative will be found hereafter. The\r\nconference proceeded, and the Indians accepted the terms made at\r\nCarlton with the utmost good feeling, and thus the Indian title\r\nwas extinguished in the whole of the Plain country, except a\r\ncomparatively small area, inhabited by the Black Feet, comprising\r\nabout 35,000 square miles, I regret to record, that the Chief Sweet\r\nGrass, who took the lead in the proceedings, met with an accidental\r\ndeath a few months afterwards, by the discharge of a pistol. The\r\nIndians, in these two treaties, displayed a strong desire for\r\ninstruction in farming, and appealed for the aid of missionaries\r\nand teachers.\r\n\r\nThe latter the Commissioners promised, and for the former they were\r\ntold they must rely on the churches, representatives of whom were\r\npresent from the Church of England, the Methodist, the Presbyterian\r\nand the Roman Catholic Church. The Bishop (Grandin) of the latter\r\nChurch travelled from Edmonton to Fort Pitt and Battleford to see\r\nthe Commissioners and assure them of his good will. After the\r\nconclusion of the treaty, the Commissioners commenced their long\r\nreturn journey by way of Battleford, and arrived at Winnipeg on the\r\n6th day of October, with the satisfaction of knowing that they had\r\naccomplished a work which, with the efficient carrying out of the\r\ntreaties, had secured the good will of the Cree Nation, and laid\r\nthe foundations of law and order in the Saskatchewan Valley.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Hudson's Bay Company, the missionaries of the\r\nvarious churches, Colonel McLeod of the Mounted Police Force, his\r\nofficers and men, and the Half-breed population, all lent willing\r\nassistance to the commissioners, and were of substantial service.\r\n\r\nI now submit the despatch of the Lieutenant-Governor, giving an\r\naccount of the journey and of the negotiations attending the\r\ntreaty, and I include a narrative of the proceedings taken down,\r\nday by day, by A. G. Jackes, Esq., M.D., Secretary to the\r\nCommission, which has never before been published, and embraces an\r\naccurate account of the speeches of the Commissioners and Indians.\r\nIt is satisfactory to be able to state, that Lieut.-Gov. Laird,\r\nofficers of the police force and Mr. Dickieson have since obtained\r\nthe adhesion to the treaty, of, I believe, all but one of the\r\nChiefs included in the treaty area, viz.: The Big Bear, while the\r\nhead men even of his band have ranged themselves under the\r\nprovisions of the treaty.\r\n\r\n                        GOVERNMENT HOUSE,\r\n                FORT GARRY, MANITOBA, 4th. December, 1876.\r\n\r\nSir,--I beg to inform you that in compliance with the request of\r\nthe Privy Council that I should proceed to the west to negotiate\r\nthe treaties which I had last year, through the agency of the late\r\nRev. George McDougall, promised the Plain Crees, would be\r\nundertaken, I left Fort Garry on the afternoon of the 27th of July\r\nlast, with the view of prosecuting my mission. I was accompanied by\r\none of my associates, the Hon. J. W. Christie, and by A. G. Jackes,\r\nEsq., M.D., who was to act as secretary. I selected as my guide Mr.\r\nPierre Levailler. The Hon. James McKay, who had also been\r\nassociated in the commission, it was arranged, would follow me and\r\nmeet me at Fort Carlton.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 4th of August, I forded the Assiniboine about\r\nfive miles from Fort Ellice, having accomplished what is usually\r\nregarded as the first stage of the journey to Fort Carlton, about\r\ntwo hundred and twenty miles. After crossing the river, I was\r\novertaken by a party of the Sioux who have settled on the reserve\r\nassigned to them at Bird Tail Creek, and was detained the greater\r\npart of the day.\r\n\r\nI am sanguine that this settlement will prove a success, as these\r\nSioux are displaying a laudable industry in cutting hay for their\r\nown use and for sale, and in breaking up ground for cultivation. I\r\nresumed my journey in the afternoon, but a storm coming on, I was\r\nobliged to encamp at the Springs, having only travelled eight miles\r\nin all during the day.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th I left the Springs, and after traversing much fine\r\ncountry, with excellent prairie, good soil, clumps of wood,\r\nlakelets, and hay swamps, in the Little and Great Touchwood Hills\r\nand File Mountain region, I arrived at the South Saskatchewan, at\r\nDumont's crossing, twenty miles from Fort Carlton, on the afternoon\r\nof the 14th of August.\r\n\r\nHere I found over one hundred carts of traders and freighters,\r\nwaiting to be ferried across the river. The scow was occupied in\r\ncrossing the carts and effects of Kis-so-wais, an enterprising\r\nChippewa trader, belonging to the Portage la Prairie band, who at\r\nonce came forward and gave up to me his right of crossing.\r\n\r\nI met, also, a young Cree who had been sent by the Crees to hand me\r\na letter of welcome in the name of their nation.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this step being taken was, that a few wandering\r\nSaulteaux or Chippewa, from Quill Lake, in Treaty Number Four, had\r\ncome to the Crees and proposed to them to unite with them and\r\nprevent me from crossing the river and entering the Indian country.\r\nThe Crees promptly refused to entertain the proposal, and sent a\r\nmessenger, as above stated, to welcome me.\r\n\r\nI also received from their messenger a letter from Lawrence Clarke,\r\nEsq., Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company at Carlton, offering\r\nthe Commissioners the hospitalities of the fort.\r\n\r\nI sent replies in advance, thanking the Crees for their action, and\r\naccepting the kind offer of Mr. Clarke, to the extent of the use of\r\nrooms in the fort.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the evening before our party crossed the river, so\r\nthat we encamped on the heights near it.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 15th we left for Fort Carlton, Mr. Christie\r\npreceding me to announce my approaching arrival at Duck Lake. About\r\ntwelve miles from Carlton I found the Hon. James McKay awaiting me,\r\nhaving travelled by way of Fort Pelly.\r\n\r\nHere also a Chief, Beardy of the Willow Crees, came to see me.\r\n\r\nHe said that his people were encamped near the lake, and that as\r\nthere were fine meadows for their horses they wished the treaty to\r\nbe made there.\r\n\r\nI was at once on my guard, and replied to him, that after I reached\r\nCarlton, which was the place appointed, I would meet the Indians\r\nwherever the great body of them desired it.\r\n\r\nHe then asked me to stop as I passed his encampment, and see his\r\npeople. This I agreed to do, as I was leaving Duck Lake I met\r\nCaptain Walker with his troop of mounted police, coming to escort\r\nme to Carlton which they did.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at Beardy's encampment, the men came to my carriage\r\nand holding up their right hands to the skies, all joined in an\r\ninvocation to the deity for a blessing on the bright day which had\r\nbrought the Queen's messenger to see them, and on the messenger and\r\nthemselves; one of them shook hands with me for the others.\r\n\r\nThe scene was a very impressive and striking one, but as will be\r\nseen hereafter, this band gave me great trouble and were very\r\ndifficult to deal with.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Indian encampment I arrived at Fort Carlton, where Mr.\r\nChristie, Dr. Jackes and myself were assigned most comfortable\r\nrooms, Mr. McKay preferring to encamp about four miles from the\r\nfort.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, Mist-ow-as-is and Ah-tuk-uk-koop, the two head\r\nChiefs of the Carlton Crees, called to pay their respects to me,\r\nand welcomed me most cordially.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th the Crees sent me word that they wished the day to\r\nconfer amongst themselves.\r\n\r\nI acceded to their request, learning that they desired to bring the\r\nDuck Lake Indians into the negotiations.\r\n\r\nI sent a messenger, Mr. Peter Ballenden, to Duck Lake to inform the\r\nIndians that I would meet them at the encampment of the Carlton\r\nCrees, about two miles from the fort.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th, on his return, he informed me that the Chief said \"He\r\nhad not given me leave to meet the Indians anywhere except at Duck\r\nLake, and that they would only meet me there.\" The Carlton Indians,\r\nhowever, sent me word, that they would be ready next morning at ten\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, as I was leaving for the Indian encampment, a\r\nmessenger came to me from the Duck Lake Indians, asking for\r\nprovisions. I replied, that Mr. Christie was in charge of the\r\ndistribution of provisions, but that I would not give any to the\r\nDuck Lake Indians, in consequence of the unreasonableness of their\r\nconduct, and that provisions would only be given to the large\r\nencampment.\r\n\r\nI then proceeded to the Indian camp, together with my fellow\r\nCommissioners, and was escorted by Captain Walker and his troop.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival I found that the ground had been most judiciously\r\nchosen, being elevated, with abundance of trees, hay marshes and\r\nsmall lakes. The spot which the Indians had left for my council\r\ntent overlooked the whole.\r\n\r\nThe view was very beautiful: the hills and the trees in the\r\ndistance, and in the foreground, the meadow land being dotted with\r\nclumps of wood, with the Indian tents clustered here and there to\r\nthe number of two hundred.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival, the Union Jack was hoisted, and the Indians at once\r\nbegan to assemble, beating drums, discharging fire-arms, singing\r\nand dancing. In about half an hour they were ready to advance and\r\nmeet me. This they did in a semicircle, having men on horseback\r\ngalloping in circles, shouting, singing and discharging fire-arms.\r\n\r\nThey then performed the dance of the \"pipe stem,\" the stem was\r\nelevated to the north, south, west and east, a ceremonial dance was\r\nthen performed by the Chiefs and head men, the Indian men and women\r\nshouting the while.\r\n\r\nThey then slowly advanced, the horsemen again preceding them on\r\ntheir approach to my tent. I advanced to meet them, accompanied by\r\nMessrs. Christie and McKay, when the pipe was presented to us and\r\nstroked by our hands.\r\n\r\nAfter the stroking had been completed, the Indians sat down in\r\nfront of the council tent, satisfied that in accordance with their\r\ncustom we had accepted the friendship of the Cree nation.\r\n\r\nI then addressed the Indians in suitable terms, explaining that I\r\nhad been sent by the Queen, in compliance with their own wishes and\r\nthe written promise I had given them last year, that a messenger\r\nwould be sent to them.\r\n\r\nI had ascertained that the Indian mind was oppressed with vague\r\nfears; they dreaded the treaty; they had been made to believe that\r\nthey would be compelled to live on the reserves wholly, and abandon\r\ntheir hunting and that in time of war, they would be placed in the\r\nfront and made to fight.\r\n\r\nI accordingly shaped my address, so as to give them confidence in\r\nthe intentions of the Government, and to quiet their apprehensions.\r\nI impressed strongly on them the necessity of changing their\r\npresent mode of life, and commencing to make homes and gardens for\r\nthemselves, so as to be prepared for the diminution of the buffalo\r\nand other large animals, which is going on so rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe Indians listened with great attention to my address, and at\r\nits close asked an adjournment that they might meet in council to\r\nconsider my words, which was of course granted.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. C. Scollen, a Roman Catholic Missionary amongst the\r\nBlackfeet, arrived soon after from Bow River, and informed me that\r\non the way he had learned that Sweet Grass, the principal Chief of\r\nthe Plain Crees, was out hunting and would not be at Fort Pitt,\r\nand that he was of opinion that his absence would be a great\r\nobstruction to a treaty.\r\n\r\nAfter consulting with my colleagues, I decided on sending a\r\nmessenger to him, requesting his presence, and succeeded in\r\nobtaining, for the occasion, the services of Mr. John McKay, of\r\nPrince Albert, who had accompanied the Rev. George McDougall on his\r\nmission last year.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, Lieut.-Col. Jarvis arrived with a reinforcement of\r\nthe Mounted Police, and an excellent band, which has been\r\nestablished at the private cost of one of the troops.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th, the Commissioners, escorted by the Mounted Police,\r\nheaded by the band, proceeded to the Indian encampment.\r\n\r\nThe Indians again assembled, following Mist-ow-as-is and\r\nAh-tuk-uk-koop, the recognised leading Chiefs.\r\n\r\nI asked them to present their Chiefs; they then presented the two\r\nhead Chiefs, and the minor ones.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, a messenger arrived from the Duck Lake Indians,\r\nasking that I should tell them the terms of the Treaty. I replied\r\nthat if the Chiefs and people had joined the others they would have\r\nheard what I had to say, and that I would not tell the terms in\r\nadvance, but that the messenger could remain and hear what I had to\r\nsay. He expressed himself satisfied and took his seat with the\r\nothers. I then fully explained to them the proposals I had to make,\r\nthat we did not wish to interfere with their present mode of\r\nliving, but would assign them reserves and assist them as was being\r\ndone elsewhere, in commencing to farm, and that what was done would\r\nhold good for those that were away.\r\n\r\nThe Indians listened most attentively, and on the close of my\r\nremarks Mist-ow-as-is arose, took me by the hand, and said that\r\n\"when a thing was thought of quietly, it was the best way,\" and\r\nasked \"this much, that we go and think of his words.\"\r\n\r\nI acquiesced at once, and expressed my hope that the Chiefs would\r\nact wisely, and thus closed the second day.\r\n\r\nThe 20th being Sunday, the Rev. Mr. John McKay, of the Church of\r\nEngland, conducted divine service at the fort, which was largely\r\nattended; the Rev. Mr. Scollen also conducted service.\r\n\r\nAt noon a messenger came from the Indian camp, asking that there\r\nshould be a service held at their camp, which Mr. McKay agreed to\r\ndo; this service was attended by about two hundred adult Crees.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, 21st, the head Chiefs sent word that, as the previous\r\nday was Sunday, they had not met in council, and wished to have the\r\nday for consultation, and if ready would meet me on Tuesday\r\nmorning. I cheerfully granted the delay from the reasonableness of\r\nthe request; but I was also aware that the head Chiefs were in a\r\nposition of great difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Duck Lake Indians and of the few discontented\r\nSaulteaux embarrassed them, while a section of their own people\r\nwere either averse to make a treaty or desirous of making\r\nextravagant demands. The head Chiefs were men of intelligence, and\r\nanxious that the people should act unitedly and reasonably.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, decided to give them all the time they might ask, a\r\npolicy which they fully appreciated.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd the Commissioners met the Indians, when I told them\r\nthat we had not hurried them, but wished now to hear their Chiefs.\r\n\r\nA spokesman, The Pond Maker, then addressed me, and asked\r\nassistance when they settled on the land, and further help as they\r\nadvanced in civilization.\r\n\r\nI replied that they had their own means of living, and that we\r\ncould not feed the Indians, but only assist them to settle down.\r\nThe Badger, Soh-ah-moos, and several other Indians all asked help\r\nwhen they settled, and also in case of troubles unforeseen in the\r\nfuture. I explained that we could not assume the charge of their\r\nevery-day life, but in a time of a great national calamity they\r\ncould trust to the generosity of the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe Honourable James McKay also addressed them, saying that their\r\ndemands would be understood by a white man as asking for daily\r\nfood, and could not be granted, and explained our objects, speaking\r\nwith effect in the Cree tongue.\r\n\r\nAt length the Indians informed me that they did not wish to be fed\r\nevery day, but to be helped when they commenced to settle, because\r\nof their ignorance how to commence, and also in case of general\r\nfamine; Ah-tuk-uk-koop winding up the debate by stating that\r\nthey wanted food in the spring when they commenced to farm, and\r\nproportionate help as they advanced in civilization, and then\r\nasking for a further adjournment to consider our offers.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners granted this, but I warned them not to be\r\nunreasonable, and to be ready next day with their decision, while\r\nwe on our part would consider what they had said.\r\n\r\nThe whole day was occupied with this discussion on the food\r\nquestion, and it was the turning point with regard to the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were, as they had been for some time past, full of\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\nThey saw the buffalo, the only means of their support, passing\r\naway. They were anxious to learn to support themselves by\r\nagriculture, but felt too ignorant to do so, and they dreaded that\r\nduring the transition period they would be swept off by disease or\r\nfamine--already they have suffered terribly from the ravages of\r\nmeasles, scarlet fever and small-pox.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to listen to them without interest, they were not\r\nexacting, but they were very apprehensive of their future, and\r\nthankful, as one of them put it, \"a new life was dawning upon\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd the conference was resumed, an Indian addressed the\r\npeople, telling them to listen and the interpreter, Peter Erasmus,\r\nwould read what changes they desired in the terms of our offer.\r\nThey asked for an ox and a cow each family; an increase in the\r\nagricultural implements; provisions for the poor, unfortunate,\r\nblind and lame; to be provided with missionaries and school\r\nteachers; the exclusion of fire water in the whole Saskatchewan; a\r\nfurther increase in agricultural implements as the band advanced in\r\ncivilization; freedom to cut timber on Crown lands; liberty to\r\nchange the site of the reserves before the survey; free passages\r\nover Government bridges or scows; other animals, a horse, harness\r\nand waggon, and cooking stove for each chief; a free supply of\r\nmedicines; a hand mill to each band; and lastly, that in case of\r\nwar they should not be liable to serve.\r\n\r\nTwo spokesmen then addressed us in support of these modifications\r\nof the terms of the Treaty.\r\n\r\nI replied to them that they had asked many things some of which had\r\nbeen promised, and that the Commissioners would consult together\r\nabout what they had asked that day and the day before, and would\r\nreply, but before doing so wished to know if that was the voice of\r\nthe whole people, to which the Indians all assented.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval we again met them, and I replied, going over\r\ntheir demands and reiterating my statements as to our inability to\r\ngrant food, and again explaining that only in a national famine did\r\nthe Crown ever intervene, and agreeing to make some additions to\r\nthe number of cattle and implements, as we felt it would be\r\ndesirable to encourage their desire to settle.\r\n\r\nI closed by stating that, after they settled on the reserves, we\r\nwould give them provisions to aid them while cultivating, to the\r\nextent of one thousand dollars per annum, but for three years only,\r\nas after that time they should be able to support themselves.\r\n\r\nI told them that we could not give them missionaries, though I was\r\npleased with their request, but that they must look to the\r\nchurches, and that they saw Catholic and Protestant missionaries\r\npresent at the conference. We told them that they must help their\r\nown poor, and that if they prospered they could do so. With regard\r\nto war, they would not be asked to fight unless they desired to do\r\nso, but if the Queen did call on them to protect their wives and\r\nchildren I believed they would not be backward.\r\n\r\nI then asked if they were willing to accept our modified proposals.\r\n\r\nAh-tuk-uk-koop then addressed me, and concluded by calling on the\r\npeople, if they were in favour of our offers, to say so. This they\r\nall did by shouting assent and holding up their hands.\r\n\r\nThe Pond Maker then rose and said he did not differ from his\r\npeople, but he did not see how they could feed and clothe their\r\nchildren with what was promised. He expected to have received that;\r\nhe did not know how to build a house nor to cultivate the ground.\r\n\r\nJoseph Toma, a Saulteaux, said he spoke for the Red Pheasant, Chief\r\nof the Battle River Crees, and made demands as follows: Men to\r\nbuild houses for them, increased salaries to the Chiefs and head\r\nmen, etc. He said what was offered was too little; he wanted enough\r\nto cover the skin of the people, guns, and also ten miles of land\r\nround the reserves in a belt.\r\n\r\nI asked the Red Pheasant how it was that he was party to the\r\nrequests of his people and how, when I asked if that was their\r\nunanimous voice he had assented, and yet had now put forward new\r\nand large demands.\r\n\r\nI said it was not good faith, and that I would not accede to the\r\nrequests now made; that what was offered was a gift as they had\r\nstill their old mode of living.\r\n\r\nThe principal Chiefs then rose and said that they accepted our\r\noffers, and the Red Pheasant repudiated the demands and remarks of\r\nToma, and stated that he had not authorized him to speak for him.\r\n\r\nMist-ow-as-is then asked to speak for the Half-breeds, who wish to\r\nlive on the reserves.\r\n\r\nI explained the distinction between the Half-breed people and the\r\nIndian Half-breeds who lived amongst the Indians as Indians, and\r\nsaid the Commissioners would consider the case of each of these\r\nlast on its merits.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was then signed by myself, Messrs. Christie and McKay,\r\nMist-ow-as-is and Ah-tuk-uk-koop, the head Chiefs, and by the other\r\nChiefs and Councillors, those signing, though many Indians were\r\nabsent, yet representing all the bands of any importance in the\r\nCarlton regions, except the Willow Indians.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th the Commissioners again met the Indians, when I\r\npresented the Head Chiefs with their medals, uniforms and flags,\r\nand informed them that Mr. Christie would give the other Chiefs and\r\nCouncillors the same in the evening.\r\n\r\nSome half a dozen of Saulteaux then came forward, of whom I found\r\none was from Qu'Appelle, and had been paid there, and the others\r\ndid not belong to the Carlton region. I told them that I had heard\r\nthat they had endeavoured to prevent me crossing the river and to\r\nprevent a treaty being made, but that they were not wiser than the\r\nwhole of their nation, who had already been treated with.\r\n\r\nThey did not deny the charge, and their spokesman becoming\r\ninsolent, I declined to hear them further, and they retired, some\r\nstating that they would go to Fort Pitt, which I warned them not to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nBesides these Saulteaux, there were others present who disapproved\r\nof their proceedings, amongst them being Kis-so-way-is, already\r\nmentioned, and Pecheeto, who was the chief spokesman at Qu'Appelle,\r\nbut is now a Councillor of the Fort Ellice Band.\r\n\r\nI may mention here that the larger part of the Band to whom these\r\nother Saulteaux belonged, with the Chief Yellow Quill, gave in\r\ntheir adhesion to Treaty Number Four, at Fort Pelly about the time\r\nthat their comrades were troubling me at Fort Carlton.\r\n\r\nMr. Christie then commenced the payments, assisted by Mr. McKay, of\r\nPrince Albert, and was engaged in so doing during the 24th and\r\n25th. Amongst those paid were the few resident Saulteaux, who were\r\naccepted by the Cree Chiefs as part of their bands.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the 26th, the whole band, headed by their Chiefs\r\nand Councillors, dressed in their uniforms, came to Carlton House\r\nto pay their farewell visit to me.\r\n\r\nThe Chiefs came forward in order, each addressing me a few remarks,\r\nand I replied briefly.\r\n\r\nThey then gave three cheers for the Queen, the Governor, one for\r\nthe Mounted Police, and for Mr. Lawrence Clarke, of Carlton House,\r\nand then departed, firing guns as they went.\r\n\r\nConsidering it undesirable that so many Indians should be excluded\r\nfrom the treaty, as would be the case if I left the Duck Lake\r\nIndians to their own devices, I determined on sending a letter to\r\nthem. I, therefore, prepared a message, inviting them to meet me at\r\nthe Hon. Mr. McKay's encampment about three miles from the large\r\nIndian encampment about half way to Duck Lake, on Monday, the 28th,\r\nif they were prepared then to accept the terms of the treaty I had\r\nmade with the Carlton Indians. My letter was entrusted to Mr.\r\nLevailler, who proceeded to Duck Lake.\r\n\r\nOn entering the Indian Council room, he found they had a letter\r\nwritten to me by the Rev. Mr. Andre, offering to accept the terms\r\nof the treaty, if I came to Duck Lake.\r\n\r\nThe Indians sent for Mr. Andre to read my letter to them, which was\r\nreceived with satisfaction; both he and Mr. Levailler urged them to\r\naccept my proposal, which they agreed to do, and requested Mr.\r\nLevailler to inform me that they would go to the appointed place.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 28th, the Commissioners met the Willow Indians.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual handshaking, and short speeches from two of the\r\nChiefs, I addressed them, telling them I was sorry for the course\r\nthey had pursued, and that I did not go away without giving them\r\nthis opportunity to be included in the treaty.\r\n\r\nKah-mee-yes-too-waegs, the Beardy, spoke for the people. He said\r\nsome things were too little. He was anxious about the buffalo.\r\n\r\nSay-sway-kees wished to tell our mother, the Queen, that they were\r\nalarmed about the buffalo. It appeared as if there was only one\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nThe Beardy again addressed me and said,--\"You have told me what you\r\nhave done with the others you will do with us. I accept the terms;\r\nno doubt it will run further, according to our numbers; when I am\r\nutterly unable to help myself I want to receive assistance.\"\r\n\r\nI replied to them, explaining, with regard to assistance that we\r\ncould not support or feed the Indians, and all that we would do\r\nwould be to help them to cultivate the soil.\r\n\r\nIf a general famine came upon the Indians the charity of the\r\nGovernment would come into exercise. I admitted the importance of\r\nsteps being taken to preserve the buffalo, and assured them that it\r\nwould be considered by the Governor-General and Council of the\r\nNorth-West Territories, to see if a wise law could be framed such\r\nas could be carried out and obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe three Chiefs and their head men then signed the treaty, and the\r\nmedals and flags were distributed, when Mr. Christie intimated that\r\nhe was ready to make the payments.\r\n\r\nThey then asked that this should be done at Duck Lake, but Mr.\r\nChristie informed them that, as we had to leave for Fort Pitt, this\r\nwas impossible; and that, moreover their share of the unexpended\r\nprovisions and the clothing and presents were at the fort, where\r\nthey would require to go for them.\r\n\r\nThey then agreed to accept the payment, which was at once proceeded\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThe persistency with which these Indians clung to their endeavor to\r\ncompel the Commissioners to proceed to Duck Lake was in part owing\r\nto superstition, the Chief Beardy having announced that he had a\r\nvision, in which it was made known to him that the treaty would be\r\nmade there.\r\n\r\nIt was partly, also, owing to hostility to the treaty, as they\r\nendeavored to induce the Carlton Indians to make no treaty, and\r\nurge them not to sell the land, but to lend it for four years.\r\n\r\nThe good sense and intelligence of the head Chiefs led them to\r\nreject their proposals, and the Willow Indians eventually, as I\r\nhave reported, accepted the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe 29th was occupied by Mr. Christie in settling accounts, taking\r\nstock of the clothing, and preparing for our departure.\r\n\r\nAn application was made to me by Toma, the Saulteaux, who took part\r\nin the proceedings on the 23rd, to sign the treaty as Chief of the\r\nSaulteaux band.\r\n\r\nAs I could not ascertain that there were sufficient families of\r\nthese Indians resident in the region to be recognized as a distinct\r\nband, and as I had no evidence that they desired him to be their\r\nChief, I declined to allow him to sign the treaty, but informed him\r\nthat next year, if the Saulteaux were numerous enough, and\r\nexpressed the wish that he should be Chief, he would be recognized.\r\n\r\nHe was satisfied with this, and said that next year they would come\r\nto the payments.\r\n\r\nHis daughter, a widow, with her family, was paid, but he preferred\r\nto remain until next year, as he did not wish to be paid except as\r\na Chief.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 31st, the previous day having been wet, Mr.\r\nChristie and I left for Fort Pitt, Mr. McKay having preceded us by\r\nthe other road--that by way of Battle River.\r\n\r\nWe arrived on the 5th September, the day appointed, having rested,\r\nas was our custom throughout the whole journey, on Sunday, the 3rd.\r\n\r\nAbout six miles from the fort we were met by Col. Jarvis and the\r\npolice, with their band, as an escort, and also by Mr. McKay, the\r\nFactor of the Hudson's Bay Company, who informed us that he had\r\nrooms ready for our occupation.\r\n\r\nWe found over one hundred lodges of Indians already there, and\r\nreceived a message from them, that as their friends were constantly\r\narriving, they wished delay until the 7th.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 6th, Sweet Grass, who had come in, in\r\nconsequence of my message, accompanied by about thirty of the\r\nprincipal men, called to see me and express their gratification at\r\nmy arrival.\r\n\r\nTheir greeting was cordial, but novel in my experience, as they\r\nembraced me in their arms, and kissed me on both cheeks, a\r\nreception which they extended also to Mr. Christie and Dr. Jackes.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. James McKay arrived from Battle River in the evening, and\r\nreported that he had met there a number of Indians, principally\r\nSaulteaux, who had been camped there for some time. There had been\r\nabout seventy lodges in all, but as the buffalo had come near, the\r\npoorer Indians had gone after them.\r\n\r\nThey expressed good feeling, and said they would like to have\r\nwaited until the 15th, the day named for my arrival there, to see\r\nme and accept the treaty, but that the buffalo hunt was of so much\r\nconsequence to them that they could not wait so long.\r\n\r\nThis band is a mixed one, composed of Crees and Saulteaux from Jack\r\nFish Lake, their Chief being the Yellow Sky.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th the Commissioners proceeded to the council tent, which\r\nwas pitched on the high plateau above the fort, commanding a very\r\nfine view, and facing the Indian encampment.\r\n\r\nThey were accompanied by the escort of the police, with their band.\r\n\r\nThe Indians approached with much pomp and ceremony, following the\r\nlead of Sweet Grass.\r\n\r\nThe stem dance was performed as at Fort Carlton, but with much more\r\nceremony, there being four pipes instead of one, and the number of\r\nriders, singers and dancers being more numerous. After the pipes\r\nwere stroked by the Commissioners, they were presented to each of\r\nthem to be smoked, and then laid upon the table to be covered with\r\ncalico and cloth, and returned to their bearers.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of these proceedings I addressed them, telling\r\nthem we had come at their own request, and that there was now a\r\ntrail leading from Lake Superior to Red River, that I saw it\r\nstretching on thence to Fort Ellice, and there branching off, the\r\none track going to Qu'Appelle and Cypress Hills, and the other by\r\nFort Pelly to Carlton, and thence I expected to see it extended, by\r\nway of Fort Pitt to the Rocky Mountains; on that road I saw all the\r\nChippewas and Crees walking, and I saw along it gardens being\r\nplanted and houses built.\r\n\r\nI invited them to join their brother Indians and walk with the\r\nwhite men on this road. I told them what we had done at Carlton,\r\nand offered them the same terms, which I would explain fully if\r\nthey wished it.\r\n\r\nOn closing Sweet Grass rose, and taking me by the hand, asked me to\r\nexplain the terms of the treaty, after which they would all shake\r\nhands with me and then go to meet in council.\r\n\r\nI complied with this request, and stated the terms fully to them,\r\nboth addresses having occupied me for three hours. On concluding\r\nthey expressed satisfaction, and retired to their council.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th the Indians asked for more time to deliberate, which was\r\ngranted, as we learned that some of them desired to make exorbitant\r\ndemands, and we wished to let them understand through the avenues\r\nby which we had access to them that these would be fruitless.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th, the Commissioners proceeded to the council tent, but\r\nthe Indians were slow of gathering, being still in council,\r\nendeavoring to agree amongst themselves.\r\n\r\nAt length they approached and seated themselves in front of the\r\ntent, I then asked them to speak to me. The Eagle addressed the\r\nIndians, telling them not to be afraid, and that I was to them as a\r\nbrother, and what the Queen wished to establish was for their good.\r\n\r\nAfter some time had passed, I again called on them to tell me their\r\nminds and not to be afraid. Sweet Grass then rose and addressed me\r\nin a very sensible manner. He thanked the Queen for sending me; he\r\nwas glad to have a brother and a friend who would help to lift them\r\nup above their present condition. He thanked me for the offer and\r\nsaw nothing to be afraid of. He therefore accepted gladly, and took\r\nmy hand to his heart. He said God was looking down on us that day,\r\nand had opened a new world to them. Sweet Grass further said, he\r\npitied those who had to live by the buffalo, but that if spared\r\nuntil this time next year, he wanted, this my brother (i.e. the\r\nGovernor), to commence to act for him in protecting the buffalo;\r\nfor himself he would commence at once to prepare a small piece of\r\nland, and his kinsmen would do the same.\r\n\r\nPlacing one hand over my heart, and the other over his own, he\r\nsaid: \"May the white man's blood never be spilt on this earth. I am\r\nthankful that the white man and red man can stand together. When I\r\nhold your hand and touch your heart, let us be as one; use your\r\nutmost to help me and help my children so that they may prosper.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief's speech, of which the foregoing gives a brief outline in\r\nhis own words, was assented to by the people with a peculiar\r\nguttural sound which takes with them the place of the British\r\ncheer.\r\n\r\nI replied, expressing my satisfaction that they had so unanimously\r\napproved of the arrangement I had made with the nation at Carlton,\r\nand promised that I would send them next year, as I had said to the\r\nCrees of Carlton, copies of the treaty printed on parchment.\r\n\r\nI said that I knew that some of the Chiefs were absent, but next\r\nyear they would receive the present of money as they had done.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners then signed the treaty, as did Sweet Grass, eight\r\nother Chiefs and those of their Councillors who were present, the\r\nChiefs addressing me before signing. James Senum, Chief of the\r\nCrees at White Fish Lake, said that he commenced to cultivate the\r\nsoil some years ago.\r\n\r\nMr. Christie, then chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, gave\r\nhim a plough, but it was now broken. He had no cattle when he\r\ncommenced, but he and his people drew the plough themselves, and\r\nmade hoes of roots of trees. Mr. Christie also gave him a pit-saw\r\nand a grind-stone, and he was still using them. His heart was sore\r\nin spring when his children wanted to plough and had no implements.\r\nHe asked for these as soon as possible, and referring to the\r\nWesleyan mission at that place, he said by following what I have\r\nbeen taught it helps me a great deal.\r\n\r\nThe Little Hunter, a leading Chief of the Plain Crees, said he was\r\nglad from his very heart; he felt in taking the Governor's hand as\r\nif it was the Queen's. When I hear her words that she is going to\r\nput this country to rights, it is the help of God that put it into\r\nher heart. He wished an everlasting grasp of her hand; he was\r\nthankful for the children who would prosper. All the children who\r\nwere settling there, hoped that the Great Spirit would look down\r\nupon us as one. Other Chiefs expressed themselves similarly.\r\n\r\nKen-oo-say-oo, or The Fish, was a Chippewayan or mountaineer, a\r\nsmall band of whom are in this region.\r\n\r\nThey had no Chief, but at my request they had selected a Chief and\r\npresented the Fish to me. He said, speaking in Cree, that he\r\nthanked the Queen, and shook hands with me, he was glad for what\r\nhad been done, and if he could have used his own tongue he would\r\nhave said more.\r\n\r\nI then presented Sweet Grass his medal, uniform, and flag, the band\r\nplaying \"God Save the Queen\" and all the Indians rising to their\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the medals, flags, and uniforms, were distributed, as\r\nsoon as possible, and Mr. Christie commenced to make the payments.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 10th, the Rev. Mr. McKay conducted the service for\r\nthe police and others, who might attend, and in the afternoon the\r\nRev. Mr. McDougall had a service in Cree; Bishop Grandin and the\r\nRev. Mr. Scollen also had services for the Crees and Chippewayans.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 11th, Mr. Christie completed the payments and\r\ndistribution of provisions. The police commenced crossing the\r\nSaskatchewan, with a view to leaving on Tuesday, the 12th, for\r\nBattle River. We therefore sent our horses and carts across the\r\nriver, and had our tents pitched with the view of commencing our\r\nreturn journey, early in the morning. Just as we were about to\r\nleave Port Pitt, however, the Great Bear, one of the three Cree\r\nChiefs who were absent, arrived at the fort and asked to see me.\r\nThe Commissioners met him, when he told me that he had been out on\r\nthe plains hunting the buffalo, and had not heard the time of the\r\nmeeting; that on hearing of it he had been sent in by the Crees and\r\nby the Stonies or Assiniboines to speak for them. I explained to\r\nhim what had been done at Carlton and Pitt, he expressed regret\r\nthat I was going away as he wished to talk to me. I then said we\r\nwould not remove until the next day, which gratified him much.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th, Sweet Grass and all the other Chiefs and Councillors\r\ncame down to the fort with the Great Bear to bid me farewell.\r\n\r\nSweet Grass told me the object of their visit. The Bear said the\r\nIndians on the plains had sent him to speak for them, and those who\r\nwere away were as a barrier before what he would have to say.\r\n\r\nSweet Grass said, addressing him, \"You see the representative of\r\nthe Queen here. I think the Great Spirit put it into their hearts\r\nto come to our help. Let there be no barrier, as it is with great\r\ndifficulty that this was brought about. Say yes and take his hand.\"\r\nThe White Fish spoke similarly.\r\n\r\nThe Bear said, \"Stop, my friends. I never saw the Governor before;\r\nwhen I heard he was to come, I said I will request him to save me\r\nfrom what I most dread--hanging; it was not given to us to have the\r\nrope about our necks.\" I replied, that God had given it to us to\r\npunish murder by death, and explained the protection the police\r\nforce afforded the Indians.\r\n\r\nBig Bear still demanded that there should be no hanging, and I\r\ninformed him that his request would not be granted. He then wished\r\nthat the buffalo might be protected, and asked why the other Chiefs\r\ndid not speak.\r\n\r\nThe Fish, the Chippewayan replied, \"We do not because Sweet Grass\r\nhas spoken, and what he says we all say.\"\r\n\r\nI then asked the Bear to tell the other two absent Chiefs Short\r\nTail and Sagamat, what had been done; that I had written him and\r\nthem a letter, and sent it by Sweet Grass, and that next year they\r\ncould join the treaty; with regard to the buffalo, the North-West\r\nCouncil were considering the question, and I again explained that\r\nwe would not interfere with the Indian's daily life except to\r\nassist them in farming.\r\n\r\nI then said I never expected to see them again. The land was so\r\nlarge that another Governor was to be sent, whom I hoped they would\r\nreceive as they had done me, and give him the same confidence they\r\nhad extended to me. The Chiefs and Councillors, commencing with\r\nSweet Grass, then shook hands with Mr. Christie and myself, each\r\naddressing me words of parting.\r\n\r\nThe Bear remained sitting until all had shaken hands, he then took\r\nmine and holding it, said, \"If he had known he would have met me\r\nwith all his people. I am not an undutiful child, I do not throw\r\nback your hand, but as my people are not here I do not sign. I will\r\ntell them what I have heard, and next year I will come.\" The\r\nIndians then left, but shortly afterwards the Bear came to see me\r\nagain, fearing I had not fully understood him, and assured me that\r\nhe accepted the treaty as if he had signed it, and would come next\r\nyear with all his people and accept it.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the river, and left for Battle River in the afternoon,\r\nwhere we arrived on the afternoon of the 15th. We found no Indians\r\nthere except Red Pheasant and his band, whom we had already met at\r\nCarlton.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th, the Red Pheasant saw the Commissioners. He said he was\r\na Battle River Indian; his fathers had lived there before him, but\r\nhe was glad to see the Government coming there, as it would improve\r\nhis means of living. He wished the claims of the Half-breeds who\r\nhad settled there before the Government came to be respected, as\r\nfor himself he would go away and seek another home, and though it\r\nwas hard to leave the home of his people, yet he would make way for\r\nthe white man, and surely, he said, \"if the poor Indian acts thus,\r\nthe Queen, when she hears of this, will help him.\" He asked, that a\r\nlittle land should be given him to plant potatoes in next spring,\r\nand they would remove after digging them, to their reserve, which\r\nhe thought he would wish to have at the Eagle Hills.\r\n\r\nI expressed my satisfaction with their conduct and excellent\r\nspirit, and obtained the cheerful consent of Mr. Fuller, of the\r\nPacific telegraph line, who is in occupation of a large cultivated\r\nfield, that the band should use three acres within the fenced\r\nenclosure, and which, moreover, Mr. Fuller kindly promised to\r\nplough for them gratuitously.\r\n\r\nThe 17th being Sunday we remained at our camp, and on Monday\r\nmorning, the 18th, we commenced our long return journey, with the\r\nincidents of which I will not trouble you further than to state\r\nthat, on arriving on the 4th of October at an encampment about\r\nthirty miles from Portage la Prairie, we found it necessary to\r\nleave our tents and carts to follow us leisurely (many of the\r\nhorses having become completely exhausted with the long journey of\r\nsixteen hundred miles) and push on to the Portage; on the 5th we\r\nreached the Portage, where Mr. Christie and Dr. Jackes remained,\r\ntheir horses being unable to go farther, and I went on to Poplar\r\nPoint, forty-five miles from Fort Garry, where I found accommodation\r\nfor the night from Mr. Chisholm, of the Hudson's Bay Company's Post\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nI arrived at Fort Garry on the afternoon of the 6th of October\r\nhaving been absent for over two months and a half. Mr. McKay,\r\nhaving taken another road, had arrived before me; Mr. Christie\r\nand Dr. Jackes reached here subsequently. Having thus closed the\r\nnarrative of our proceedings, I proceed to deal with the results of\r\nour mission, and to submit for your consideration some reflections\r\nand to make some practical suggestions.\r\n\r\n1st. The Indians inhabiting the ceded territory are chiefly Crees,\r\nbut there are a few Assiniboines on the plains and also at the\r\nslope of the mountains. There are also a small number of Saulteaux\r\nand one band of Chippewayans.\r\n\r\n2nd. I was agreeably surprised to find so great a willingness on\r\nthe part of the Crees to commence to cultivate the soil, and so\r\ngreat a desire to have their children instructed. I requested Mr.\r\nChristie to confer with the Chief while the payments were going on,\r\nas to the localities where they would desire to have reserves\r\nassigned to them, and with few exceptions they indicated the\r\nplaces, in fact most of them have already commenced to settle.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore important that the cattle and agricultural\r\nimplements should be given them without delay.\r\n\r\nI would, therefore, recommend that provision should be made for\r\nforwarding these as soon as the spring opens. I think it probable\r\nthat cattle and some implements could be purchased at Prince Albert\r\nand thus avoid transportation.\r\n\r\n3rd. I would further represent that, though I did not grant the\r\nrequest, I thought the desire of the Indians, to be instructed in\r\nfarming and building, most reasonable, and I would therefore\r\nrecommend that measures be adopted to provide such instruction for\r\nthem. Their present mode of living is passing away; the Indians are\r\ntractable, docile and willing to learn. I think that advantage\r\nshould be taken of this disposition to teach them to become\r\nself-supporting, which can best be accomplished with the aid of a\r\nfew practical farmers and carpenters to instruct them in farming\r\nand house building.\r\n\r\nThe universal demand for teachers, and by some of the Indians for\r\nmissionaries, is also encouraging. The former, the Government can\r\nsupply; for the latter they must rely on the churches, and I trust\r\nthat these will continue and extend their operations amongst them.\r\nThe field is wide enough for all, and the cry of the Indian for\r\nhelp is a clamant one.\r\n\r\n4th. In connection with the aiding of the Indians to settle, I have\r\nto call attention to the necessity of regulations being made for\r\nthe preservation of the buffalo. These animals are fast decreasing\r\nin numbers, but I am satisfied that a few simple regulations would\r\npreserve the herds for many years. The subject was constantly\r\npressed on my attention by the Indians, and I promised that the\r\nmatter would be considered by the North-West Council. The council\r\nthat has governed the territories for the last four years was\r\nengaged in maturing a law for this purpose, and had our regime\r\ncontinued we would have passed a statute for their preservation. I\r\ncommend the matter to the attention of our successors as one of\r\nurgent importance.\r\n\r\n5th. There is another class of the population in the North-West\r\nwhose position I desire to bring under the notice of the Privy\r\nCouncil. I refer to the wandering Half-breeds of the plains, who\r\nare chiefly of French descent and live the life of the Indians.\r\nThere are a few who are identified with the Indians, but there is a\r\nlarge class of Metis who live by the hunt of the buffalo, and have\r\nno settled homes. I think that a census of the numbers of these\r\nshould be procured, and while I would not be disposed to recommend\r\ntheir being brought under the treaties, I would suggest that land\r\nshould be assigned to them, and that on their settling down, if\r\nafter an examination into their circumstances, it should be found\r\nnecessary and expedient, some assistance should be given them to\r\nenable them to enter upon agricultural operations.\r\n\r\nIf the measures suggested by me are adopted, viz., effective\r\nregulations with regard to the buffalo, the Indians taught to\r\ncultivate the soil, and the erratic Half-breeds encouraged to\r\nsettle down, I believe that the solution of all social questions of\r\nany present importance in the North-West Territories will have been\r\narrived at.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have to call your attention to the report made to\r\nme by the Hon. Mr. Christie, which I forward herewith; that\r\ngentleman took the entire charge of the payments and administration\r\nof matters connected with the treaty, and I have to speak in the\r\nhighest terms of the value of his services.\r\n\r\nAccompanying his report will be found the pay sheets, statements of\r\ndistribution of provisions and clothing, memoranda as to the\r\nlocalities of the reserves, suggestions as to the times and places\r\nof payment next year, and a general balance sheet.\r\n\r\nA credit of $60,000 was given to me, and I have placed as a refund\r\nto the credit of the Receiver-General, $12,730.55. This arises from\r\nthe fact that owing to the proximity of the buffalo, many of the\r\nIndians did not come into the treaty.\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge the benefit I derived from the services of\r\nthe Hon. James McKay, camping as he did near the Indian encampment.\r\nHe had the opportunity of meeting them constantly, and learning\r\ntheir views which his familarity with the Indian dialects enabled\r\nhim to do. Dr. Jackes took a warm interest in the progress of our\r\nwork, and kept a record of the negotiations, a copy of which I\r\nenclose and which I think ought to be published, as it will be of\r\ngreat value to those who will be called on to administer the\r\ntreaty, showing as it does what was said by the negotiators and by\r\nthe Indians, and preventing misrepresentations in the future. The\r\nCommissioners are under obligations to Lieut.-Colonel McLeod, and\r\nthe other officers and men of the police force for their escort.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the men was excellent, and the presence of the force\r\nas an emblem and evidence of the establishment of authority in the\r\nNorth-West was of great value.\r\n\r\nI have to record my appreciation of the kindness of Messrs. Clarke,\r\nof Fort Carlton, and McKay of Fort Pitt, and of the other officials\r\nof the Hudson's Bay Company, and of the hearty assistance they\r\nextended towards the accomplishment of our mission. I have also to\r\nmention the interest taken in the negotiations by His Lordship\r\nBishop Grandin, and by the various missionaries, Protestant and\r\nCatholic.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, as on others, I found the Half-breed population\r\nwhether French or English generally using the influence of their\r\nrelationship to the Indians in support of our efforts to come to a\r\nsatisfactory arrangement with them.\r\n\r\nWe also had the advantage of good interpreters, having secured the\r\nservices of Messrs. Peter Ballendine and John McKay, while the\r\nIndians had engaged Mr. Peter Erasmus to discharge the same duty.\r\nThe latter acted as chief interpreter, being assisted by the\r\nothers, and is a most efficient interpreter.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a copy of the treaty, and have only in\r\nconclusion to express my hope that this further step in the\r\nprogress of the work of the Dominion amongst the Indian tribes will\r\nprove beneficial to them, and of advantage to the realm.\r\n\r\n                   I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                             Your obedient servant,\r\n                                     ALEXANDER MORRIS,\r\n                                              Lieut.-Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrative of the proceedings connected with the effecting of the\r\ntreaties at Forts Carlton and Pitt, in the year 1876, together with\r\na report of the speeches of the Indians and Commissioners, by A. G.\r\nJackes, Esq., M.D., Secretary to the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe expedition for the proposed Treaty Number Six, reached the\r\nSouth Saskatchewan on the afternoon of August 14th, where they were\r\nmet by a messenger from the Cree Indians expressing welcome, also a\r\nmessenger from Mr. L. Clarke, of Carlton House, offering to the\r\nGovernor and party the hospitality of the Fort.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when about ten miles from Carlton, the\r\nCommissioners were met by a detachment of Mounted Police under\r\nMajor Walker, who escorted them to the Fort; on the way the\r\nCommissioners passed an encampment of Crees whose Chief had\r\npreviously seen the Governor at Duck Lake and asked him to make the\r\ntreaty there; he replied that he could not promise, that he would\r\nmeet the Indians where the greater number wished. These Crees\r\njoined in an invocation to the deity for a blessing on the\r\nGovernor, and deputed one of their number to welcome him by shaking\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nNear the Fort were encamped about two hundred and fifty lodges of\r\nCrees, to whom the Commissioners at once served out two days'\r\nallowance of provisions.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th the Crees reported that they wanted another day to\r\nconfer amongst themselves, this was granted and the Governor\r\nrequested them to meet him and the Commissioners on the 18th at 10\r\na.m., to commence the business of the treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST DAY\r\n\r\nAugust 18th.\r\n\r\nAt half-past ten His Honor Lieut.-Gov. Morris, the Hon. W. J.\r\nChristie and Hon. Jas. McKay, accompanied by an escort of\r\nNorth-West Mounted Police, left the Fort for the camp of the Cree\r\nIndians, who had selected a site about a mile and a half from the\r\nHudson's Bay Fort. There were about two hundred and fifty lodges,\r\ncontaining over two thousand souls. The Governor's tent was pitched\r\non a piece of rising ground about four hundred yards from the\r\nIndian camp, and immediately facing it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Governor and party arrived, the Indians who were to\r\ntake part in the treaty, commenced to assemble near the Chief's\r\ntents, to the sound of beating drums and the discharge of small\r\narms, singing, dancing and loud speaking, going on at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn about half an hour they were ready to advance and meet the\r\nGovernor; this they did in a large semi-circle; in their front\r\nwere about twenty braves on horseback, galloping about in\r\ncircles, shouting, singing and going through various picturesque\r\nperformances. The semi-circle steadily advanced until within fifty\r\nyards of the Governor's tent, when a halt was made and further\r\npeculiar ceremonies commenced, the most remarkable of which was the\r\n\"dance of the stem.\" This was commenced by the Chiefs, medicine\r\nmen, councillors, singers and drum-beaters, coming a little to the\r\nfront and seating themselves on blankets and robes spread for them.\r\nThe bearer of the stem, Wah-wee-kah-nich-kah-oh-tah-mah-hote (the\r\nman you strike on the back), carrying in his hand a large and\r\ngorgeously adorned pipe stem, walked slowly along the semi-circle,\r\nand advancing to the front, raised the stem to the heavens, then\r\nslowly turned to the north, south, east and west, presenting the\r\nstem at each point; returning to the seated group he handed the\r\nstem to one of the young men, who commenced a low chant, at the\r\nsame time performing a ceremonial dance accompanied by the drums\r\nand singing of the men and women in the background.\r\n\r\nThis was all repeated by another of the young men, after which the\r\nhorsemen again commenced galloping in circles, the whole body\r\nslowly advancing. As they approached his tent, the Governor,\r\naccompanied by the Hon. W. J. Christie and Hon. Jas. McKay,\r\nCommissioners, went forward to meet them and to receive the stem\r\ncarried by its bearer. It was presented first to the Governor, who\r\nin accordance with their customs, stroked it several times, then\r\npassed it to the Commissioners who repeated the ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this ceremony is that the Governor and\r\nCommissioners accepted the friendship of the tribe.\r\n\r\nThe interpreter then introduced the Chiefs and principal men; the\r\nIndians slowly seating themselves in regular order in front of the\r\ntent. In a few minutes there was perfect quiet and order, when His\r\nHonor the Lieutenant-Governor addressed them as follows:\r\n\r\n\"My Indian brothers, Indians of the plains, I have shaken hands\r\nwith a few of you, I shake hands with all of you in my heart. God\r\nhas given us a good day, I trust his eye is upon us, and that what\r\nwe do will be for the benefit of his children.\r\n\r\n\"What I say and what you say, and what we do, is done openly before\r\nthe whole people. You are, like me and my friends who are with me,\r\nchildren of the Queen. We are of the same blood, the same God made\r\nus and the same Queen rules over us.\r\n\r\n\"I am a Queen's Councillor, I am her Governor of all these\r\nterritories, and I am here to speak from her to you. I am here now\r\nbecause for many days the Cree nation have been sending word that\r\nthey wished to see a Queen's messenger face to face. I told the\r\nQueen's Councillors your wishes. I sent you word last year by a\r\nman who has gone where we will all go by and by, that a Queen's\r\nmessenger would meet you this year. I named Forts Carlton and Pitt\r\nas the places of meeting, I sent a letter to you saying so, and my\r\nheart grew warm when I heard how well you received it.\r\n\r\n\"As the Queen's chief servant here, I always keep my promises; the\r\nwinter came and went but I did not forget my word, and I sent a\r\nmessenger to tell you that I would meet you at Carlton on the 15th\r\nof August, and at Fort Pitt on the 5th of September.\r\n\r\n\"During the winter I went to Ottawa to consult with the other\r\nQueen's Councillors about you amongst other matters, and they said\r\nto me, 'you promised a Queen's messenger to the Crees, you have\r\nbeen so much with the Indians, that we wish you to go yourself;'\r\nI said 'the journey is long and I am not a strong man, but when a\r\nduty is laid upon me I will do it, but,' I said, 'you must give\r\nwith me two friends and councillors whom I can trust, to help me in\r\nthe duty;' and now I have with me two friends whom you and I have\r\nknown long; one of them is of your own blood, the other has been\r\nmany years amongst you.\r\n\r\n\"I will, in a short time, give you a message from the Queen, and my\r\nCouncillors will tell you that the words are true. Before I do so,\r\nthere are so many things I want to say to you that I scarcely know\r\nwhere to begin. I have been nearly four years Governor of Manitoba\r\nand these territories, and from the day I was sworn, I took the\r\nIndian by the hand, and those who took it have never let it go.\r\n\r\n\"Three years ago I went to the north-west angle of Lake of the\r\nWoods, and there I met the Chippewa nation, I gave them a message\r\nand they talked with me and when they understood they took my hand.\r\nSome were away, next year I sent messengers to them and I made a\r\ntreaty between the Queen and them; there are numbered of those\r\naltogether four thousand. I then went to Lake Qu'Appelle the year\r\nafter, and met the Crees and Chippewas there, gave them my message,\r\nand they took my hand. Last summer I went to Lake Winnipeg and gave\r\nthe Queen's message to the Swampy Crees and they and I, acting for\r\nthe Queen, came together heart to heart; and now that the Indians\r\nof the east understand the Queen and her Councillors, I come to\r\nyou. And why is all this done? I will tell you; it is because you\r\nare the subjects of the Queen as I am. She cares as much for one of\r\nyou as she does for one of her white subjects. The other day a\r\nparty of Iroquois Indians were taken to England across the ocean;\r\nthe Queen heard of it and sent to them, saying, 'I want to see my\r\nred children,' took their hands and gave each of them her picture,\r\nand sent them away happy with her goodness.\r\n\r\n\"Before I came here I was one of the Queen's Councillors at Ottawa.\r\nWe have many Indians there as here, but for many years there has\r\nbeen friendship between the British, and the Indians. We respect\r\nthe Indians as brothers and as men. Let me give you a proof it.\r\nYears ago there was war between the British and the Americans;\r\nthere was a great battle; there were two brave Chief warriors on\r\nthe British side, one wore the red coat, the other dressed as you\r\ndo, but they fought side by side as brothers; the one was Brock and\r\nthe other was Tecumseth whose memory will never die; the blood of\r\nboth watered the ground; the bones of Tecumseth were hid by his\r\nfriends; the remains of Brock by his, and now a great pile of stone\r\nstands up toward heaven in his memory. And now the white man is\r\nsearching for the remains of Tecumseth, and when found they will\r\nbuild another monument in honour of the Indian.\r\n\r\n\"I hope the days of fighting are over, but notwithstanding the\r\nwhites are as much your friends in these days of peace, as in war.\r\n\r\n\"The many Indians in the place that I have left are happy,\r\nprosperous, contented and growing in numbers. A meeting of the\r\nGrand Council of the Six Nation Indians was held a month ago; they\r\nnow number six thousand souls. They met to thank the Queen and to\r\nsay that they were content, and why are they content? Because many\r\nyears ago the Queen's Councillors saw that the Indians that would\r\ncome after, must be cared for, they saw that the means of living\r\nwere passing away from the Indians, they knew that women and\r\nchildren were sometimes without food; they sent men to speak to the\r\nIndians, they said your children must be educated, they must be\r\ntaught to raise food for themselves. The Indians heard them, the\r\nCouncillors gave them seed, land, food, taught their children and\r\nlet them feel that they were of one blood with the whites. Now,\r\nwhat we have found to work so well where I came from we want to\r\nhave here in our territories, and I am happy to say that my heart\r\nis gladdened by the way the Indians have met me.\r\n\r\n\"We are not here as traders, I do not come as to buy or sell horses\r\nor goods, I come to you, children of the Queen, to try to help you;\r\nwhen I say yes, I mean it, and when I say no, I mean it too.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to think of my words, I want to tell you that what we\r\ntalk about is very important. What I trust and hope we will do is\r\nnot for to-day or to-morrow only; what I will promise, and what I\r\nbelieve and hope you will take, is to last as long as that sun\r\nshines and yonder river flows.\r\n\r\n\"You have to think of those who will come after you, and it will be\r\na remembrance for me as long as I live, if I can go away feeling\r\nthat I have done well for you. I believe we can understand each\r\nother, if not it will be the first occasion on which the Indians\r\nhave not done so. If you are as anxious for your own welfare as I\r\nam, I am certain of what will happen.\r\n\r\n\"The day is passing. I thank you for the respectful reception you\r\nhave given me. I will do here as I have done on former occasions. I\r\nhope you will speak your minds as fully and as plainly as if I was\r\none of yourselves.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you to think of what I have said. I wish you to present\r\nyour Chiefs to me to-day if you are ready, if not then we will wait\r\nuntil to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nHere the Indians requested an adjournment until next day in order\r\nthat they might meet in council; this was granted, and the first\r\nday's proceedings terminated.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening the escort of Mounted Police was reinforced by\r\na detachment, accompanied by their band, under command of Col.\r\nJarvis, making a force of nearly one hundred men and officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND DAY\r\n\r\nAugust 19th.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor and Commissioners, with the Mounted Police\r\nescort, headed by their band, proceeded to the camp to meet the\r\nIndians at 10:30 a.m. The Indians having assembled in regular order\r\nwith their two leading Chiefs, Mis-tah-wah-sis and Ah-tuck-ah-coop\r\nseated in front, the Governor said:\r\n\r\n\"My friends, we have another bright day before us, and I trust that\r\nwhen it closes our faces will continue as bright as the day before\r\nus. I spoke yesterday as a friend to friends, as a brother to\r\nbrothers, as a father to his children. I did not want to hurry you,\r\nI wanted you to think of my words, and now I will be glad if you\r\nwill do as I asked you then, present your Chiefs to me, and I shall\r\nbe glad to hear the words of the Indians through the voice of their\r\nChiefs, or whoever they may appoint.\"\r\n\r\nThe head men then brought forward Mis-tah-wah-sis, of the Carlton\r\nIndians, representing seventy-six lodges. Ah-tuck-ah-coop, of the Wood\r\nIndians, representing about seventy lodges. These were acknowledged as\r\nthe leading Chiefs, after them came James Smith, of the Fort-a-la-Corne\r\nIndians, fifty lodges. John Smith, of the Prince Albert and South\r\nBranch Indians, fifty lodges. The Chip-ee-wayan, of the Plain Indians,\r\nsixty lodges. Yah-yah-tah-kus-kin-un, of the Fishing or Sturgeon lake\r\nIndians, twenty lodges. Pee-yahan-kah-mihk-oo-sit, thirty lodges.\r\nWah-wee-kah-nich-kah-oh-tah-mah-hote, of the River Indians, fifty\r\nlodges.\r\n\r\nHere a messenger came from the Indians under Chief Beardy, camped\r\nat Duck Lake, eight miles from the main camp. He shook hands with\r\nthe Governor and said, \"I am at a loss at this time what to say,\r\nfor the Indians' mind cannot be all the same, that is why I came\r\nto tell the Governor the right of it; with a good heart I plead at\r\nthis time, it is not my own work, I would like to know his mind\r\njust now and hear the terms of the treaty.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor said in reply: \"If your Chief and his people had been\r\nin their places here, they would have heard with the rest what I\r\nhad to say. You refused to meet me here, yet you sent and asked me\r\nto give you provisions, but I refused to do so unless you joined\r\nthe others; and now I will not tell my message to this messenger\r\nuntil I tell all the rest; he can hear with the rest and take back\r\nmy words to his chief.\" The messenger expressed himself satisfied,\r\nand took his seat with the others.\r\n\r\nOn the Indians expressing themselves ready to hear the message, the\r\nGovernor said:\r\n\r\n\"First I wish to talk to you about what I regard as something\r\naffecting the lives of yourselves and the lives of your children.\r\nOften when I thought of the future of the Indian my heart was sad\r\nwithin me. I saw that the large game was getting scarcer and\r\nscarcer, and I feared that the Indians would melt away like snow in\r\nspring before the sun. It was my duty as Governor to think of them,\r\nand I wondered if the Indians of the plains and lakes could not do\r\nas their brothers where I came from did. And now, when I think of\r\nit, I see a bright sky before me. I have been nearly four years\r\nworking among my Indian brothers, and I am glad indeed to find that\r\nmany of them are seeking to have homes of their own, having gardens\r\nand sending their children to school.\r\n\r\n\"Last spring I went to see some of the Chippewas, this year I went\r\nagain and I was glad to see houses built, gardens planted and wood\r\ncut for more houses. Understand me, I do not want to interfere with\r\nyour hunting and fishing. I want you to pursue it through the\r\ncountry, as you have heretofore done; but I would like your\r\nchildren to be able to find food for themselves and their children\r\nthat come after them. Sometimes when you go to hunt you can leave\r\nyour wives and children at home to take care of your gardens.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to know that some of you have already begun to build and\r\nto plant; and I would like on behalf of the Queen to give each band\r\nthat desires it a home of their own; I want to act in this matter\r\nwhile it is time. The country is wide and you are scattered, other\r\npeople will come in. Now unless the places where you would like to\r\nlive are secured soon there might be difficulty. The white man\r\nmight come and settle on the very place where you would like to be.\r\nNow what I and my brother Commissioners would like to do is this:\r\nwe wish to give each band who will accept of it a place where they\r\nmay live; we wish to give you as much or more land than you need;\r\nwe wish to send a man that surveys the land to mark it off, so you\r\nwill know it is your own, and no one will interfere with you. What\r\nI would propose to do is what we have done in other places. For\r\nevery family of five a reserve to themselves of one square mile.\r\nThen, as you may not all have made up your minds where you would\r\nlike to live, I will tell you how that will be arranged: we would\r\ndo as has been done with happiest results at the North-West Angle.\r\nWe would send next year a surveyor to agree with you as to the\r\nplace you would like.\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing I would say about the reserves. The land I name\r\nis much more than you will ever be able to farm, and it may be that\r\nyou would like to do as your brothers where I came from did.\r\n\r\n\"They, when they found they had too much land, asked the Queen to\r\nit sell for them; they kept as much as they could want, and the\r\nprice for which the remainder was sold was put away to increase for\r\nthem, and many bands now have a yearly income from the land.\r\n\r\n\"But understand me, once the reserve is set aside, it could not be\r\nsold unless with the consent of the Queen and the Indians; as long\r\nas the Indians wish, it will stand there for their good; no one can\r\ntake their homes.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, if when a reserve is chosen, a white man had already\r\nsettled there, his rights must be respected. The rights and\r\ninterests of the whites and half-breeds are as dear to the Queen as\r\nthose of the Indians. She deals justly by all, and I am sure my\r\nIndian brothers would like to deal with others as they would have\r\nothers to deal with them. I think you can now understand the\r\nquestion of homes.\r\n\r\n\"When the Indians settle on a reserve and have a sufficient number\r\nof children to be taught, the Queen would maintain a school.\r\nAnother thing, that affects you all, some of you have temptations\r\nas the white men have, and therefore the fire-water which does so\r\nmuch harm will not be allowed to be sold or used in the reserve.\r\nThen before I leave the question of reserves I will tell you how we\r\nwill help you to make your homes there. We would give to every\r\nfamily actually cultivating the soil the following articles, viz.,\r\ntwo hoes, one spade, one scythe, one axe, and then to help in\r\nbreaking the land, one plough and two harrows for every ten\r\nfamilies; and to help you to put up houses we give to each Chief\r\nfor his band, one chest of carpenter's tools, one cross-cut saw,\r\nfive hand saws, one pit saw and files, five augers and one\r\ngrindstone. Then if a band settles on its reserves the people will\r\nrequire something to aid them in breaking the soil. They could not\r\ndraw the ploughs themselves, therefore we will give to each Chief\r\nfor the use of his band one or two yokes of oxen according to the\r\nnumber in the band. In order to encourage the keeping of cattle we\r\nwould give each band a bull and four cows; having all these things\r\nwe would give each band enough potatoes, oats, barley and wheat for\r\nseed to plant the land actually broken. This would be done once for\r\nall to encourage them to grow for themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Chiefs ought to be respected, they ought to be looked up to by\r\ntheir people; they ought to have good Councillors; the Chiefs and\r\nCouncillors should consult for the good of the people; the Queen\r\nexpects Indians and whites to obey her laws; she expects them to\r\nlive at peace with other Indians and with the white men; the Chiefs\r\nand Councillors should teach their people so, and once the Queen\r\napproves a Chief or Councillor he cannot be removed unless he\r\nbehaves badly.\r\n\r\n\"The Chiefs and head men are not to be lightly put aside. When a\r\ntreaty is made they become servants of the Queen; they are to try\r\nand keep order amongst their people. We will try to keep order in\r\nthe whole country.\r\n\r\n\"A Chief has his braves; you see here the braves of our Queen, and\r\nwhy are they here? To see that no white man does wrong to the\r\nIndian. To see that none give liquor to the Indian. To see that the\r\nIndians do no harm to each other. Three years ago some Americans\r\nkilled some Indians; when the Queen's Councillors heard of it they\r\nsaid, we will send men there to protect the Indians, the Queen's\r\nsubjects shall not be shot down by the Americans; now you\r\nunderstand why the police force is in this country, and you should\r\nrejoice.\r\n\r\n\"I have said a Chief was to be respected; I wear a uniform because\r\nI am an officer of the Queen, the officers of the police wear\r\nuniforms as servants of the Queen. So we give to Chiefs and\r\nCouncillors good and suitable uniform indicating their office, to\r\nwear on these and other great days.\r\n\r\n\"We recognize four head men to each large band and two to each\r\nsmall one.\r\n\r\n\"I have always been much pleased when Indians came to me and showed\r\nme medals given to their grandfathers and transmitted to them; now\r\nwe have with us silver medals that no Chief need be ashamed to\r\nwear, and I have no doubt that when the Chiefs are gone, they will\r\nbe passed on to their children. In addition each Chief will be\r\ngiven a flag to put over his lodge to show that he is a Chief.\r\n\r\n\"I told you yesterday that I and my brother Commissioners were not\r\nhere as traders.\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing I ought to have mentioned in addition to what I\r\nhave already named, that is, if a treaty is made here and at Fort\r\nPitt, we will give every year to the Indians included in it, one\r\nthousand five hundred dollars' worth of ammunition and twine.\r\n\r\n\"You think only for yourselves, we have to think of the Indians all\r\nover the country, we cannot treat one better than another, it would\r\nnot be just, we will therefore do this, and what I tell you now is\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\n\"When the treaty is closed, if it be closed, we will make a present\r\nto every man, woman and child, of twelve dollars, the money being\r\npaid to the head of a family for his wife, and children not\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\n\"To each Chief, instead of twelve, we give twenty-five dollars, and\r\nto each head man fifteen dollars, their wives and children getting\r\nthe same as the others. I told you also that what I was promising\r\nwas not for to-day or to-morrow only, but should continue as long\r\nas the sun shone and the river flowed. My words will pass away and\r\nso will yours, so I always write down what I promise, that our\r\nchildren may know what we said and did. Next year I shall send\r\ncopies of what is written in the treaty, printed on skin, so that\r\nit cannot rub out nor be destroyed, and one shall be given to each\r\nChief so that there may be no mistakes.\r\n\r\n\"Then I promise to do as we have done with all before from Cypress\r\nHills to Lake Superior, the Queen will agree to pay yearly five\r\ndollars per head for every man, woman and child. I cannot treat you\r\nbetter than the others, but I am ready to treat you as well.\r\n\r\n\"A little thing I had forgotten, and I have done. The Chiefs' and\r\nhead men's coats will wear out, they are meant to be worn when it\r\nis necessary to show that they are officers of the Queen, and every\r\nthird year they will be replaced by new ones.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Indians of the plains, I thank you for the open ear you\r\nhave given me; I hold out my hand to you full of the Queen's bounty\r\nand I hope you will not put it back. We hate no object but to\r\ndischarge our duty to the Queen and towards you. Now that my hand\r\nis stretched out to you, it is for you to say whether you will take\r\nit and do as I think you ought--act for the good of your people.\r\n\r\n\"What I have said has been in the face of the people. These things\r\nwill hold good next year for those that are now away. I have done.\r\nWhat do you say?\"\r\n\r\nMIS-TAH-WAH-SIS here came forward, shook hands with the Governor,\r\nand said:--\"We have heard all he has told us, but I want to tell\r\nhim how it is with us as well; when a thing is thought of quietly,\r\nprobably that is the best way. I ask this much from him this day\r\nthat we go and think of his words.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor and Commissioners agreed to the request and asked the\r\nIndians to meet them Monday morning at ten o'clock with as little\r\ndelay as possible.\r\n\r\nBefore parting, the Governor said to the Indians, \"This is a great\r\nday for us all. I have proposed on behalf of the Queen what I\r\nbelieve to be for your good, and not for yours only, but for that\r\nof your children's children, and when you go away think of my\r\nwords. Try to understand what my heart is towards you. I will trust\r\nthat we may come together hand to hand and heart to heart again. I\r\ntrust that God will bless this bright day for our good, and give\r\nyour Chiefs and Councillors wisdom so that you will accept the\r\nwords of your Governor. I have said.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday, August 20th.\r\n\r\nDivine service, which was largely attended, was held in the square\r\nof Fort Carlton, by the Rev. John McKay, at half-past ten a.m.\r\n\r\nAt noon a message came from the encampment of Indians requesting\r\nthe Rev. Mr. McKay to hold service with them, which he did in the\r\nafternoon, preaching in their own tongue to a congregation of over\r\ntwo hundred adult Crees.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday, August 21st.\r\n\r\nThe principal Chief sent a message that as the Indians had held no\r\nCouncil on Sunday, they wished to have Monday to themselves and\r\nwould if ready meet the Commissioners on Tuesday morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD DAY\r\n\r\nAugust 22nd.\r\n\r\nThe Governor and Commissioners having proceeded as usual to the camp,\r\nthe Indians soon assembled in order, when the Lieutenant-Governor said:\r\n\r\n\"Indian children of the Queen, it is now a week to-day since I came\r\nhere on the day I said I would; I have to go still further after I\r\nleave here, and then a long journey home to Red River.\r\n\r\n\"I have not hurried you, you have had two days to think; I have\r\nspoken much to you and now I wish to hear you, my ears are open and\r\nI wish to hear the voices of your principal Chiefs or of those\r\nchosen to speak for them. Now I am waiting.\"\r\n\r\nOO-PEE-TOO-KERAH-HAN-AP-EE-WEE-YIN (the Pond-maker) came forward\r\nand said:--\"We have heard your words that you had to say to us as\r\nthe representative of the Queen. We were glad to hear what you had\r\nto say and have gathered together in council and thought the words\r\nover amongst us, we were glad to hear you tell us how we might live\r\nby our own work. When I commence to settle on the lands to make a\r\nliving for myself and my children, I beg of you to assist me in\r\nevery way possible--when I am at a loss how to proceed I want the\r\nadvice and assistance of the Government; the children yet unborn,\r\nI wish you to treat them in like manner as they advance in\r\ncivilization like the white man. This is all I have been told to\r\nsay now, if I have not said anything in a right manner I wish to be\r\nexcused; this is the voice of the people.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR:--\"I have heard the voice of the people; I am glad to\r\nlearn that they are looking forward to having their children\r\ncivilized, that is the great object of the Government, as is proved\r\nby what I have offered. Those that come after us in the Government\r\nwill think of your children as we think of you. The Queen's\r\nCouncillors intend to send a man to look after the Indians, to be\r\nchief superintendent of Indian affairs, and under him there will be\r\ntwo or three others to live in the country, that the Queen's\r\nCouncillors may know how the Indians are prospering.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot promise however, that the Government will feed and support\r\nall the Indians; you are many, and if we were to try to do it, it\r\nwould take a great deal of money, and some of you would never do\r\nanything for yourselves. What I have offered does not take away\r\nyour living, you will have it then as you have now, and what I\r\noffer now is put on top of it. This I can tell you, the Queen's\r\nGovernment will always take a deep interest in your living.\"\r\n\r\nTHE BADGER--\"We want to think of our children; we do not want to be\r\ntoo greedy; when we commence to settle down on the reserves that we\r\nselect, it is there we want your aid, when we cannot help ourselves\r\nand in case of troubles seen and unforeseen in the future.\"\r\n\r\nSak-ah-moos and several other Indians in order repeated what The\r\nBadger had said.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I have told you that the money I have offered you would\r\nbe paid to you and to your children's children. I know that the\r\nsympathy of the Queen, and her assistance, would be given you in\r\nany unforeseen circumstances. You must trust to her generosity.\r\nLast winter when some of the Indians wanted food because the crops\r\nhad been destroyed by grasshoppers, although it was not promised\r\nin the treaty, nevertheless the Government sent money to buy them\r\nfood, and in the spring when many of them were sick a man was sent\r\nto try and help them. We cannot foresee these things, and all I\r\ncan promise is that you will be treated kindly, and in that\r\nextraordinary circumstances you must trust to the generosity of the\r\nQueen. My brother Commissioner, Mr. McKay, will speak to you in\r\nyour own language.\"\r\n\r\nMR. McKAY--\"My friends, I wish to make you a clear explanation of\r\nsome things that it appears you do not understand. It has been said\r\nto you by your Governor that we did not come here to barter or\r\ntrade with you for the land. You have made demands on the Governor,\r\nand from the way you have put them a white man would understand\r\nthat you asked for daily provisions, also supplies for your hunt\r\nand for your pleasure excursions. Now my reasons for explaining to\r\nyou are based on my past experience of treaties, for no sooner will\r\nthe Governor and Commissioners turn their backs on you than some of\r\nyou will say this thing and that thing was promised and the promise\r\nnot fulfilled; that you cannot rely on the Queen's representative,\r\nthat even he will not tell the truth, whilst among yourselves are\r\nthe falsifiers. Now before we rise from here it must be understood,\r\nand it must be in writing, all that you are promised by the\r\nGovernor and Commissioners, and I hope you will not leave until you\r\nhave thoroughly understood the meaning of every word that comes\r\nfrom us. We have not come here to deceive you, we have not come\r\nhere to rob you, we have not come here to take away anything that\r\nbelongs to you, and we are not here to make peace as we would to\r\nhostile Indians, because you are the children of the Great Queen as\r\nwe are, and there has never been anything but peace between us.\r\nWhat you have not understood clearly we will do our utmost to make\r\nperfectly plain to you.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I have another word to say to the Indians on this\r\nmatter: last year an unforeseen calamity came upon the people of\r\nRed River, the grasshoppers came and ate all their crops. There is\r\nno treaty between the people of Red River and the Queen except that\r\nthey are her subjects. There was no promise to help them, but I\r\nsent down and said that unless help came some of the people would\r\ndie from want of food, and that they had nothing wherewith to\r\nplant. The Queen's Councillors at once gave money to feed the\r\npeople, and seed that they might plant the ground; but that was\r\nsomething out of and beyond every-day life, and therefore I say\r\nthat some great sickness or famine stands as a special case. You\r\nmay rest assured that when you go to your reserves you will be\r\nfollowed by the watchful eye and sympathetic hand of the Queen's\r\nCouncillors.\"\r\n\r\nTHE BADGER--\"I do not want you to feed me every day; you must not\r\nunderstand that from what I have said. When we commence to settle\r\ndown on the ground to make there our own living, it is then we want\r\nyour help, and that is the only way that I can see how the poor can\r\nget along.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"You will remember the promises which I have already\r\nmade; I said you would get seed; you need not concern yourselves so\r\nmuch about what your grand-children are going to eat; your children\r\nwill be taught, and then they will be as well able to take care of\r\nthemselves as the whites around them.\"\r\n\r\nMIS-TAH-WAH-SIS (one of the leading Chiefs)--\"It is well known that\r\nif we had plenty to live on from our gardens we would not still\r\ninsist on getting more provision, but it is in case of any\r\nextremity, and from the ignorance of the Indian in commencing to\r\nsettle that we thus speak; we are as yet in the dark; this is not a\r\ntrivial matter for us.\r\n\r\n\"We were glad to hear what the Governor was saying to us and we\r\nunderstood it, but we are not understood, we do not mean to ask for\r\nfood for every day but only when we commence and in case of famine\r\nor calamity. What we speak of and do now will last as long as the\r\nsun shines and the river runs, we are looking forward to our\r\nchildren's children, for we are old and have but few days to live.\"\r\n\r\nAH-TAHK-AH-COOP (the other leading Chief)--\"The things we have been\r\ntalking about in our councils I believe are for our good. I think\r\nof the good Councillors of the Queen and of her Commissioners; I\r\nwas told the Governor was a good man, and now that I see him I\r\nbelieve he is; in coming to see us, and what he has spoken, he has\r\nremoved almost all obstacles and misunderstandings, and I hope he\r\nmay remove them all. I have heard the good things you promise us,\r\nyou have told us of the white man's way of living and mentioned\r\nsome of the animals by which he gets his living, others you did\r\nnot. We want food in the spring when we commence to farm; according\r\nas the Indian settles down on his reserves, and in proportion as he\r\nadvances, his wants will increase.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians here asked for the afternoon to hold further council.\r\nTo this the Governor said, \"I grant the request of the Indians but\r\nI give them a word of warning, do not listen to every voice in your\r\ncamp, listen to your wise men who know something of life, and do\r\nnot come asking what is unreasonable, it pains me to have to say\r\nno, and I tell you again I cannot treat you with more favor than\r\nthe other Indians. To-morrow, when we meet, speak out your minds\r\nopenly, and I will answer, holding nothing back. Be ready to meet\r\nme to-morrow, as soon as my flag is raised, for remember I have\r\na long journey before me and we ought to come to a speedy\r\nunderstanding. I trust the God who made you will give you wisdom\r\nin considering what you have to deal with.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH DAY\r\n\r\nAugust 23rd.\r\n\r\nShortly after the business had commenced, proceedings were\r\ninterrupted by the loud talking of a Chippewa, who was addressing\r\nthe Indians gathered in front of the tent. The Governor said,\r\n\"There was an Indian, a Chippewa, stood and spoke to you, he did\r\nnot speak to his Governor as he should have done: I am willing to\r\nhear what any band has to say, but they must speak to me. I have\r\nbeen talking to the Crees for several days. I wish to go on with\r\nthe work; if the Chippewas want to talk with me I will hear them\r\nafterwards. They are a little handful of strangers from the east, I\r\nhave treated with their whole nation, they are not wiser than their\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\"There are many reasons why business should go on; I hear that the\r\nbuffalo are near you and you want to be off to your hunt; there are\r\nmany mouths here to feed and provisions are getting low; now my\r\nfriends I am ready to hear you.\"\r\n\r\nTEE-TEE-QUAY-SAY--\"Listen to me, my friends, all you who are\r\nsitting around here, and you will soon hear what the interpreter\r\nhas to say for us.\"\r\n\r\nThe interpreter then read a list of the things the Indians had\r\nagreed in council to ask, viz.:--One ox and cow for each family.\r\nFour hoes, two spades, two scythes and a whetstone for each family.\r\nTwo axes, two hay forks, two reaping hooks, one plough and one\r\nharrow for every three families. To each Chief one chest of tools\r\nas proposed. Seed of every kind in full to every one actually\r\ncultivating the soil. To make some provision for the poor,\r\nunfortunate, blind and lame. To supply us with a minister and\r\nschool teacher of whatever denomination we belong to. To prevent\r\nfire-water being sold in the whole Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\nAs the tribe advances in civilization, all agricultural implements\r\nto be supplied in proportion.\r\n\r\nWhen timber becomes scarcer on the reserves we select for\r\nourselves, we want to be free lo take it anywhere on the common. If\r\nour choice of a reserve does not please us before it is surveyed we\r\nwant to be allowed to select another. We want to be at liberty to\r\nhunt on any place as usual. If it should happen that a Government\r\nbridge or scow is built on the Saskatchewan at any place, we want\r\npassage free. One boar, two sows, one horse, harness and waggon for\r\neach Chief. One cooking stove for each Chief. That we be supplied\r\nwith medicines free of cost. That a hand-mill be given to each\r\nband. Lastly in case of war occurring in the country, we do not\r\nwant to be liable to serve in it.\r\n\r\nTEE-TEE-QUAY-SAY then continued--\"When we look back to the past we\r\ndo not see where the Cree nation has ever watered the ground with\r\nthe white man's blood, he has always been our friend and we his;\r\ntrusting to the Giver of all good, to the generosity of the Queen,\r\nand to the Governor and his councillors, we hope you will grant us\r\nthis request.\"\r\n\r\nWAH-WEE-KAH-NIHK-KAH-OO-TAH-MAH-HOTE (the man you strike in the\r\nback)--\"Pity the voice of the Indian, if you grant what we request\r\nthe sound will echo through the land; open the way; I speak for the\r\nchildren that they may be glad; the land is wide, there is plenty\r\nof room. My mouth is full of milk, I am only as a sucking child; I\r\nam glad; have compassion on the manner in which I was brought up;\r\nlet our children be clothed; let us now stand in the light of day\r\nto see our way on this earth; long ago it was good when we first\r\nwere made, I wish the same were back again. But now the law has\r\ncome, and in that I wish to walk. What God has said, and our mother\r\nhere (the earth), and these our brethren, let it be so.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the Governor replied--\"Indians, I made you my offer. You\r\nhave asked me now for many things, some of which were already\r\npromised. You are like other Indians I have met, you can ask very\r\nwell. You are right in asking, because you are saying what is in\r\nyour minds. I have had taken down a list of what you have asked,\r\nand I will now consult with my brother Commissioners and give you\r\nmy answer in a little while.\"\r\n\r\nAfter consultation, the Governor again had the Indians assembled,\r\nand said--\"I am ready now to answer you, but understand well, it is\r\nnot to be talked backwards and forwards. I am not going to act like\r\na man bargaining for a horse for you. I have considered well what\r\nyou have asked for, and my answer will be a final one. I cannot\r\ngrant everything you ask, but as far as I can go I will, and when\r\ndone I can only say you will be acting to your own interests if you\r\ntake my hand.\r\n\r\n\"I will speak of what you asked yesterday and to-day. I told you\r\nyesterday that if any great sickness or general famine overtook\r\nyou, that on the Queen being informed of it by her Indian agent,\r\nshe in her goodness would give such help as she thought the Indians\r\nneeded. You asked for help when you settled on your reserves during\r\nthe time you were planting. You asked very broadly at first. I\r\nthink the request you make now is reasonable to a certain extent;\r\nbut help should be given after you settle on the reserve for three\r\nyears only, for after that time you should have food of your own\r\nraising, besides all the things that are given to you; this\r\nassistance would only be given to those actually cultivating the\r\nsoil. Therefore, I would agree to give every spring, for three\r\nyears, the sum of one thousand dollars to assist you in buying\r\nprovisions while planting the ground. I do this because you seem\r\nanxious to make a living for yourselves, it is more than has been\r\ndone anywhere else; I must do it on my own responsibility, and\r\ntrust to the other Queen's councillors to ratify it.\r\n\r\n\"I will now answer what you had written down and asked to-day. I\r\nexpect you to be reasonable, none of us get all our own way. You\r\nasked first for four hoes, two spades, two scythes and whetstone,\r\ntwo axes, two hay forks and two reaping hooks for every family. I\r\nam willing to give them to every family actually cultivating the\r\nsoil, for if given to all it would only encourage idleness. You ask\r\na plough and harrow for every three families; I am willing to give\r\nthem on the same conditions. The carpenters' tools, as well as the\r\nseed grain, were already promised. I cannot undertake the\r\nresponsibility of promising provision for the poor, blind and lame.\r\nIn all parts of the Queen's dominions we have them; the poor whites\r\nhave as much reason to be helped as the poor Indian; they must be\r\nleft to the charity and kind hearts of the people. If you are\r\nprosperous yourselves you can help your unfortunate brothers.\r\n\r\n\"You ask for school teachers and ministers. With regard to\r\nministers I cannot interfere. There are large societies formed for\r\nthe purpose of sending the gospel to the Indians. The Government\r\ndoes not provide ministers anywhere in Canada. I had already\r\npromised you that when you settled down, and there were enough\r\nchildren, schools would be maintained. You see missionaries here on\r\nthe ground, both Roman Catholic and Protestant; they have been in\r\nthe country for many years. As it has been in the past, so it will\r\nbe again, you will not be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"The police force is here to prevent the selling or giving of\r\nliquor to the Indians. The Queen has made a strong law against the\r\nfire-water; and the councillors of the country have made a law\r\nagainst the use of poison for animals.\r\n\r\n\"You can have no difficulty in choosing your reserves; be sure to\r\ntake a good place so that there will be no need to change; you\r\nwould not be held to your choice until it was surveyed.\r\n\r\n\"You want to be at liberty to hunt as before. I told you we did not\r\nwant to take that means of living from you, you have it the same as\r\nbefore, only this, if a man, whether Indian or Half-breed, had a\r\ngood field of grain, you would not destroy it with your hunt. In\r\nregard to bridges and scows on which you want passage free, I do\r\nnot think it likely that the Government will build any, they prefer\r\nto leave it to private enterprise to provide these things.\r\n\r\n\"In case of war you ask not to be compelled to fight. I trust there\r\nwill be no war, but if it should occur I think the Queen would\r\nleave you to yourselves. I am sure she would not ask her Indian\r\nchildren to fight for her unless they wished, but if she did call\r\nfor them and their wives and children were in danger they are not\r\nthe men I think them to be, if they did not come forward to their\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\"A medicine chest will be kept at the house of each Indian agent,\r\nin case of sickness amongst you. I now come to two requests\r\nwhich I shall have to change a little, you have to think only of\r\nyourselves, we have to think of all the Indians and of the way in\r\nwhich we can procure the money to purchase all these things the\r\nIndians require. The Queen's Councillors will have to pay every\r\nyear to help the Indians a very large sum of money.\r\n\r\n\"I offered you to each band, according to size, two or four oxen,\r\nalso one bull and four cows, and now you ask for an ox and a cow\r\nfor each family. I suppose in this treaty there will be six hundred\r\nfamilies, so it would take very much money to grant these things,\r\nand then all the other Indians would want them, so we cannot do\r\nit: but that you may see it that we are anxious to have you raise\r\nanimals of your own we will give you for each band four oxen, one\r\nbull, six cows, one boar and two pigs. After a band has settled on\r\na reserve and commenced to raise grain, we will give them a\r\nhand-mill.\r\n\r\n\"At first we heard of only two Chiefs, now they are becoming many.\r\nYou ask a cooking-stove for each, this we cannot give; he must find\r\na way of cooking for himself. And now, although I fear I am going\r\ntoo far, I will grant the request that each Chief be furnished with\r\na horse, harness, and waggon.\r\n\r\n\"I have answered your requests very fully, and that there may be no\r\nmistake as to what we agree upon, it will be written down, and I\r\nwill leave a copy with the two principal Chiefs, and as soon as it\r\ncan be properly printed I will send copies to the Chiefs so that\r\nthey may know what is written, and there can be no mistake.\r\n\r\n\"It now rests with you, my friends, and I ask you without any\r\nhesitation to take what I have offered you.\"\r\n\r\nAH-TUCK-AH-COOP--\"I never sent a letter to the Governor; I was\r\nwaiting to meet him, and what we have asked we considered would be\r\nfor the benefit of our children. I am not like some of my friends\r\nwho have sent their messages down, even stretched out their hands\r\nto the Queen asking her to come; I have always said to my people\r\nthat I would wait to see the Governor arrive, then he would ask\r\nwhat would benefit his children; now I ask my people, those that\r\nare in favour of the offer, to say so.\"\r\n\r\nThey all assented by holding up their hands and shouting.\r\n\r\nOO-PEE-TOO-KORAH-HAIR-AP-EE-WEE-YIN (The Pond-maker)--\"I do not\r\ndiffer from my people, but I want more explanation. I heard what\r\nyou said yesterday, and I thought that when the law was established\r\nin this country it would be for our good. From what I can hear and\r\nsee now, I cannot understand that I shall be able to clothe my\r\nchildren and feed them as long as sun shines and water runs. With\r\nregard to the different Chiefs who are to occupy the reserves, I\r\nexpected they would receive sufficient for their support, this is\r\nwhy I speak. In the presence of God and the Queen's representative\r\nI say this, because I do not know how to build a house for myself,\r\nyou see how naked I am, and if I tried to do it my naked body would\r\nsuffer; again, I do not know how to cultivate the ground for\r\nmyself, at the same time I quite understand what you have offered\r\nto assist us in this.\"\r\n\r\nJOSEPH THOMA proposed to speak for The Red Pheasant, Chief of\r\nBattle River Indians--\"This is not my own desire that I speak now,\r\nit is very hard we cannot all be of one mind. You know some were\r\nnot present when the list of articles mentioned was made, there are\r\nmany things overlooked in it; it is true that what has been done\r\nthis morning is good. What has been overlooked I will speak about.\r\nThe one that is next to the Chief (first head man) should have had\r\na horse as well. I want the Governor to give us somebody to build\r\nour houses, we cannot manage it ourselves, for my own part you see\r\nmy crippled hand. It is true the Governor says he takes the\r\nresponsibility on himself in granting the extra requests of the\r\nIndians, but let him consider on the quality of the land he has\r\nalready treated for. There is no farming land whatever at the\r\nnorth-west angle, and he goes by what he has down there. What I\r\nwant, as he has said, is twenty-five dollars to each Chief and to\r\nhis head men twenty dollars. I do not want to keep the lands nor do\r\nI give away, but I have set the value. I want to ask as much as\r\nwill cover the skin of the people, no more nor less. I think what\r\nhe has offered is too little. When you spoke you mentioned\r\nammunition, I did not hear mention of a gun; we will not be able to\r\nkill anything simply by setting fire to powder. I want a gun for\r\neach Chief and head man, and I want ten miles around the reserve\r\nwhere I may be settled. I have told the value I have put on my\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I have heard what has been said on behalf of the Red\r\nPheasant. I find fault that when there was handed me a list from\r\nthe Indians, the Red Pheasant sat still and led me to believe he\r\nwas a party to it. What I have offered was thought of long before I\r\nsaw you; it has been accepted by others more in number than you\r\nare. I am glad that so many are of our mind. I am surprised you are\r\nnot all. I hold out a full hand to you, and it will be a bad day\r\nfor you and your children if I have to return and say that the\r\nIndians threw away my hand. I cannot accede to the requests of the\r\nRed Pheasant. I have heard and considered the wants of Mist-ow-asis\r\nand Ah-tuck-ah-coop, and when the people were spoken to I\r\nunderstood they were pleased. As for the little band who are not of\r\none mind with the great body, I am quite sure that a week will not\r\npass on leaving this before they will regret it. I want the Indians\r\nto understand that all that has been offered is a gift, and they\r\nstill have the same mode of living as before.\"\r\n\r\nHere the principal Chiefs intimated the acceptance of the proposal\r\nof the Commissioners, the Red Pheasant repudiating the demands and\r\nremarks of Joseph Thoma.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I am happy at what we have done; I know it has been a\r\ngood work; I know your hearts will be glad as the days pass. This\r\nwill be the fourth time that I have done what we are going to do\r\nto-day. I thank you for your trust in me. I have had written down\r\nwhat I promised. For the Queen and in her name I will sign it,\r\nlikewise Mr. McKay and Mr. Christie. Then I will ask the Chiefs and\r\ntheir head men to sign it in the presence of the witnesses, whites\r\nand Metis, around us, some of whom I will also ask to sign. What we\r\nhave done has been done before the Great Spirit and in the face of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\"I will ask the interpreter to read to you what has been written,\r\nand before I go away I will have a copy made to leave with the\r\nprincipal Chiefs. The payments will be made to-morrow, the suits of\r\nclothes, medals and flags given also, besides which a present of\r\ncalicoes, shirts, tobacco, pipes and other articles will be given\r\nto the Indians.\"\r\n\r\nMIS-TOW-ASIS--\"I wish to speak a word for some Half-breeds who wish\r\nto live on the reserves with us, they are as poor as we are and\r\nneed help.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"How many are there?\"\r\n\r\nMIS-TOW-ASIS--\"About twenty.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"The Queen has been kind to the Half-breeds of Red River\r\nand has given them much land; we did not come as messengers to the\r\nHalf-breeds, but to the Indians. I have heard some Half-breeds want\r\nto take lands at Red River and join the Indians here, but they\r\ncannot take with both hands. The Half-breeds of the North-West\r\ncannot come into the Treaty. The small class of Half-breeds who\r\nlive as Indians and with the Indians, can be regarded as Indians by\r\nthe Commissioners, who will judge of each case on its own merits as\r\nit comes up, and will report their action to the Queen's\r\nCouncillors for their approval.\"\r\n\r\nThe treaty was then signed by the Lieutenant-Governor, Hon. James\r\nMcKay, Hon. W. J. Christie, Mist-ow-asis, Ah-tuck-ah-coop, and the\r\nremainder of the Chiefs and the Councillors.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 24th.\r\n\r\nImmediately on meeting at ten a.m., the Governor called up\r\nMis-tow-asis and Ah-tuck-ah-coop, the two principal Chiefs, and\r\npresented their uniforms, medals and flags; after them the lesser\r\nChiefs, their medals and flags, and told them they and their\r\nCouncillors would get their uniforms in the evening from the\r\nstores. The Governor then told them that Mr. Christie would\r\ncommence payments as soon as he had finished talking with the few\r\nSaulteaux; he expected the Chiefs and Councillors to assist in\r\nevery way possible; if any of the Chiefs had decided where they\r\nwould like to have their reserves, they could tell Mr. Christie\r\nwhen they went to be paid. \"Now, I have only to say farewell; we\r\nhave done a good work; we will never all of us meet again face to\r\nface, but I go on to my other work, feeling that I have, in the\r\nQueen's hands, been instrumental to your good. I pray God's\r\nblessing upon you to make you happy and prosperous, and I bid you\r\nfarewell.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians intimated their pleasure by a general shout of\r\napproval, and thus broke up the conference which resulted in the\r\nTreaty with the Carlton Crees.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor then met the few Chippewas who came\r\nforward, and told them that they must be paid at the place where\r\nthey belonged, that they could not be paid at Fort Pitt, and said,\r\n\"If what I have heard is true I shall not be well pleased. I am\r\ntold you are of a bad mind; you proposed to prevent me from\r\ncrossing the river; [Footnote: South Saskatchewan.] if you did it\r\nwas very foolish; you could no more stop me than you could the\r\nriver itself. Then I am told you tried to prevent the other Indians\r\nfrom making the treaty. I tell you this to your faces so if it is\r\nnot true you can say so; but whether it is or not it makes no\r\ndifference in my duty. The Queen has made treaties with the whole\r\nChippewa nation except two or three little wandering bands such as\r\nyou; you have heard all that has been said and done these many\r\ndays; I would like to see you helped as well as the other Indians;\r\nI do not think you are wiser than the Chippewas from Lake Superior\r\nto the North-West Angle; I went there with Mr. McKay, and we made a\r\ntreaty with twenty Chiefs and four thousand Chippewas.\"\r\n\r\nNUS-WAS-OO-WAH-TUM--\"When we asked the Cree bands what they\r\nintended to do with regard to the treaty they would not come to us;\r\nit is true we told them 'do not be in a hurry in giving your\r\nassent;' you ought to be detained a little while; all along the\r\nprices have been to one side, and we have had no say. He that made\r\nus provided everything for our mode of living; I have seen this all\r\nalong, it has brought me up and I am not tired of it, and for you,\r\nthe white man, everything has been made for your maintenance, and\r\nnow that you come and stand on this our earth (ground) I do not\r\nunderstand; I see dimly to-day what you are doing, and I find fault\r\nwith a portion of it; that is why I stand back; I would have been\r\nglad if every white man of every denomination were now present to\r\nhear what I say; through what you have done you have cheated my\r\nkinsmen.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I will not sit here and hear such words from the\r\nChippewas. Who are you? You come from my country and you tell me\r\nthe Queen has cheated you; it is not so. You say we have the best\r\nof the bargains; you know it is not so. If you have any requests to\r\nmake in a respectful manner I am ready to hear.\"\r\n\r\nCHIPPEWA--\"The God that made us and who alone is our master, I am\r\nafraid of Him to deviate from his commandment.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chippewas, about half a dozen in all, being from Quill Lake\r\nchiefly, left, and Mr. Christie proceeded with the payments, which\r\noccupied the remainder of the 24th and all the 25th. He paid in\r\nall, Chiefs, 13; head men, 44; men, 262; women, 473; boys, 473;\r\ngirls, 481; from Treaty Number Four, 41; total, 1,787. A large\r\nnumber of the tribe absent at the hunt will be paid next year.\r\n\r\nNext morning, the 26th, the whole Cree camp, headed by their Chiefs\r\nand head men, wearing their uniforms and medals, came to Carlton\r\nHouse and assembled in the square to pay their farewell visit to\r\nthe Governor; the Chiefs came forward in order and shook hands,\r\neach one making a few remarks expressive of their gratitude for the\r\nbenefits received and promised, and of their good will to the white\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe Governor briefly replied, telling them that he was much\r\ngratified with the manner in which they had behaved throughout the\r\ntreaty; he had never dealt with a quieter, more orderly and\r\nrespectful body of Indians; he was pleased with the manner in which\r\nthey had met him and taken his advice; he was glad to hear that\r\nthey were determined to go to work and help themselves: he hoped\r\ntheir Councils would always be wisely conducted, and that they\r\nwould do everything in their power to maintain peace amongst\r\nthemselves and with their neighbors; he hoped the Almighty would\r\ngive them wisdom and prosper them. They then gave three cheers for\r\nthe Queen, the Governor, the mounted police and Mr. Lawrence\r\nClarke, of Carlton House.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th a message was received from Duck Lake from the Willow\r\nIndians, the band which had hitherto held aloof, in reply to a\r\nmessage sent to them by the Governor, that they would meet the\r\nGovernor and Commissioners at the place designated by the Governor,\r\nthe camp of the Hon. James McKay, about five miles from Carlton\r\nHouse. Accordingly, the next morning the Commissioners met them,\r\nand after the usual ceremonial hand-shaking,\r\n\r\nSAY-SWAY-PUS--\"God has given us a beautiful day for which I feel\r\nvery grateful. In grasping your hand I am grasping that of our\r\nMother, the Queen. If it is your intention to honor me with a\r\nChief's clothing, I wish you would give me one that would\r\ncorrespond with the sky above. I hope we will be able to understand\r\neach other.\"\r\n\r\nCHIN-UN-US-KUT (The Stump)--\"I feel very grateful that I am spared\r\nby the Great Spirit to see this day of his, may we be blessed in\r\nwhatever we do this day.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"Crees, my brother children of the Great Queen, I am glad\r\nto meet you here to-day. I say as you said the first day I saw you,\r\n'it is a bright day and I hope God will bless us.' I have been\r\nsorry for you for many days. I took you by the hand on the first\r\nday, but a wall rose up between us, it seemed as if you were trying\r\nto draw away but I would not let your hand go. I talked for many\r\ndays with the great body of the Indians here but you refused to\r\nmeet me; the others and I understood each other. I was going away\r\nto-day, but I thought pity of you who had not talked with me. I was\r\nsent here to make you understand the Queen's will. I received your\r\nletter last night and was glad to learn that you wanted to accept\r\nthe terms I had offered, and which had been accepted by the other\r\nIndians. Before I received your letter I had sent you one asking\r\nyou to meet me here where we are now, and I am glad you have come,\r\nas I could not otherwise have met you.\r\n\r\n\"One of you made a request that if he were accepted as a Chief, he\r\nshould have a blue coat. I do not yet know who the Chiefs are. To\r\nbe a Chief he must have followers. One man came forward as a Chief\r\nand I had to tell him unless you have twenty tents you cannot\r\ncontinue as a Chief.\r\n\r\n\"The color of your Chief's coat is perhaps a little thing; red is\r\nthe color all the Queen's Chiefs wear. I wear this coat, but it is\r\nonly worn by those who stand as the Queen's Councillors; her\r\nsoldiers and her officers wear red, and all the other Chiefs of the\r\nQueen wear the coats we have brought, and the good of this is that\r\nwhen the Chief is seen with his uniform and medal every one knows\r\nhe is an officer of hers. I should be sorry to see you different\r\nfrom the others, and now that you understand you would not wish\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nKAH-MEE-YIS-TOO-WAYS (The Beardy)--\"I feel grateful for this day,\r\nand I hope we will be blessed. I am glad that I see something that\r\nwill be of use; I wish that we all as a people may be benefitted by\r\nthis. I want that all these things should be preserved in a manner\r\nthat they might be useful to us all; it is in the power of man to\r\nhelp each other. We should not act foolishly with the things that\r\nare given us to live by. I think some things are too little, they\r\nwill not be sufficient for our wants. I do not want very much more\r\nthan what has been promised, only a little thing. I will be glad\r\nif you will help me by writing my request down; on account of the\r\nbuffalo I am getting anxious. I wish that each one should have an\r\nequal share, if that could be managed; in this I think we would be\r\ndoing good. Perhaps this is not the only time that we shall see\r\neach other. Now I suppose another can say what he wishes.\"\r\n\r\nSAY-SWAY-KUS--\"What my brother has said, I say the same, but I want\r\nto tell him and our mother the Queen, that although we understand\r\nthe help they offer us, I am getting alarmed when I look at the\r\nbuffalo, it appears to me as if there was only one. I trust to the\r\nQueen and to the Governor, it is only through their aid we can\r\nmanage to preserve them. I want to hear from the Governor himself\r\nan answer to what I have said, so I may thoroughly understand.\"\r\n\r\nTHE BEARDY--\"Those things which the Almighty has provided for the\r\nsustenance of his children may be given us as well; where our\r\nFather has placed the truth we wish the same to be carried out\r\nhere, I do not set up a barrier to any road that my children may\r\nlive by: I want the payment to exist as long as the sun shines and\r\nthe river runs: if we exercise all our good, this surely will\r\nhappen: all of our words upon which we agree, I wish to have a copy\r\nwritten on skin as promised; I want my brother to tell me where I\r\ncan get this. He has said, 'what I have done with the others I will\r\ndo with you:' I accept the terms, no doubt it will run further\r\naccording to our number. When I am utterly unable to help myself I\r\nwant to receive assistance. I will render all the assistance I can\r\nto my brother in taking care of the country. I want from my brother\r\na suit of clothing in color resembling the sky so that he may be\r\nable when he sees me to know me; I want these two (sitting by him)\r\nto be Chiefs in our place with me and to have six Councillors (two\r\neach) in all.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I will speak to you in regard to food as I have spoken\r\nto the other Indians; we cannot support or feed the Indians every\r\nday, further than to help them to find the means of doing it for\r\nthemselves by cultivating the soil. If you were to be regularly fed\r\nsome of you would do nothing at all for your own support; in this\r\nmatter we will do as we have agreed with the other Indians, and no\r\nmore. You will get your share of the one thousand dollars' worth of\r\nprovisions when you commence to work on your reserves.\r\n\r\n\"In a national famine or general sickness, not what happens in\r\nevery day life, but if a great blow comes on the Indians, they\r\nwould not be allowed to die like dogs.\r\n\r\n\"What occurred in Red River last year from the destruction of crops\r\nby the grasshoppers, affected our whole people, and without being\r\nbound to do anything, the charity and humanity of the Government\r\nsent means to help them.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot give the Chief a blue coat: he must accept the red one\r\nand he must not suffer so small a matter as the color of a coat to\r\nstand between us. I accept the three Chiefs with two Councillors\r\nfor each. With regard to the preservation of the buffalo, it is a\r\nsubject of great importance, it will be considered by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor and Council of the North-West Territories to\r\nsee if a wise law can be passed, one that will be a living law that\r\ncan be carried out and obeyed. If such a law be passed it will be\r\nprinted in Cree as well as in English and French; but what the law\r\nwill be I cannot tell--you held councils over the treaty, you did\r\nnot know before the councils closed what you would decide as to the\r\ntreat--no more can I tell what the North-West Council will decide.\"\r\n\r\nA request was then made that the treaty should include the\r\nHalf-breeds, to which the Governor replied: \"I have explained to\r\nthe other Indians that the Commissioners did not come to the\r\nHalf-breeds: there were however a certain class of Indian\r\nHalf-breeds who had always lived in the camp with the Indians and\r\nwere in fact Indians, would be recognized, but no others.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chiefs and head men then signed the treaty in the presence of\r\nwitnesses, the medals and flags were distributed, payments and\r\ndistribution of clothing proceeded with and finished, and the\r\nconference came to an end.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor and party started from Carlton House on the\r\n31st of August at noon, for Fort Pitt, and when within about six\r\nmiles of that post came up with a detachment of Mounted Police\r\nunder Inspectors Jarvis and Walker, who escorted them to the fort,\r\narriving on the day appointed (5th September) at an early hour.\r\n\r\nThere were already assembled near the fort and on the banks of the\r\nSaskatchewan over one hundred lodges, and as more were immediately\r\nexpected they requested postponement of negotiations until the 7th\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 6th, Sweet Grass, one of the oldest and most\r\nrespected of the Cree Chiefs, with about thirty of his chief men,\r\nwho had left their hunt and come in to Fort Pitt purposely to\r\nattend the treaty negotiations, called on the Governor to express\r\ntheir satisfaction at his coming and their pleasure in seeing him;\r\nthe greeting which was certainly affectionate, consisted in the\r\nembrace of both arms about the neck and a fraternal kiss on either\r\ncheek; after a short conversation the Governor told them he\r\nexpected them to be ready to meet him at his tent in the morning;\r\ntime was rapidly passing and he had a long journey yet before him;\r\nhe trusted their Councils would be wise and the results would be\r\nbeneficial to them.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Jas. McKay arrived from Battle River in the evening, and\r\nreported that he had met there a number of Indians, principally\r\nSaulteaux, who had been in camp at that place for some time. They\r\nsaid there had been about seventy lodges altogether, but as the\r\nbuffalo were coming near, the poorer ones had started out to hunt,\r\nleaving only about ten lodges there. The remaining ones expressed\r\ngood feeling and said they would like to have waited until the time\r\nappointed (September 15th) to meet the Governor and take the\r\ntreaty, yet as the buffalo hunt was of so much importance to them\r\nthey could not afford to lose the time, knowing that the Governor\r\nhad to go to Fort Pitt and return before they could see him,\r\nconsequently the whole band went out to the plains. This band was\r\ncomposed, it was afterwards ascertained, of the Saulteaux of Jack\r\nFish Lake and of some Crees under the Yellow Sky Chief, and were\r\nfavorably disposed though unable to remain. They numbered in all\r\nsixty-seven tents.\r\n\r\nSeptember 7th.\r\n\r\nAt ten in the morning the Governor and Commissioners, escorted by\r\nthe Mounted Police, proceeded to the treaty tent a short distance\r\nfrom the fort. About eleven o'clock the Indians commenced to\r\ngather, as at Carlton, in a large semi-circle. In front were the\r\nyoung men, galloping about on their horses, then the Chiefs and\r\nhead men, followed by the main body of the band to the number of\r\ntwo or three hundred. As they approached the manoeuvres of the\r\nhorsemen became more and more excited and daring, racing wildly\r\nabout so rapidly as to be barely distinguishable; unfortunately,\r\nfrom some mischance, two horses and their riders came into\r\ncollision with such tremendous force as to throw both horses and\r\nmen violently to the ground; both horses were severely injured and\r\none of the Indians had his hip put out of joint; fortunately, Dr.\r\nKittson of the police, was near by and speedily gave relief to the\r\npoor sufferer. The ceremonies, however, still went on; four\r\npipe-stems were carried about and presented to be stroked in token\r\nof good feeling and amity (during this performance the band of the\r\nMounted Police played \"God save the Queen\"), blessings invoked on\r\nthe whole gathering, the dances performed by the various bands, and\r\nfinally the pipes of peace smoked by the Governor and Commissioners\r\nin turn. The stems, which were finely decorated, were placed with\r\ngreat solemnity on the table in front of the Governor, to be\r\ncovered for the bearers with blue cloth.\r\n\r\nThe Chiefs and head men now seated themselves in front of the tent,\r\nwhen the Governor addressed them:\r\n\r\n\"Indians of the plains, Crees, Chippewayans, Assiniboines and\r\nChippewas, my message is to all. I am here to-day as your Governor\r\nunder the Queen. The Crees for many days have sent word that they\r\nwanted to see some one face to face. The Crees are the principal\r\ntribe of the plain Indians, and it is for me a pleasant duty to be\r\nhere to-day and receive the welcome I have from them. I am here\r\nbecause the Queen and her Councillors have the good of the Indian\r\nat heart, because you are the Queen's children and we must think of\r\nyou for to-day and to-morrow; the condition of the Indians and\r\ntheir future has given the Queen's Councillors much anxiety. In the\r\nold provinces of Canada from which I came we have many Indians,\r\nthey are growing in numbers and are as a rule happy and prosperous;\r\nfor a hundred years red and white hands have been clasped together\r\nin peace. The instructions of the Queen are to treat the Indians as\r\nbrothers, and so we ought to be. The Great Spirit made this earth\r\nwe are on. He planted the trees and made the rivers flow for the\r\ngood of all his people, white and red; the country is very wide and\r\nthere is room for all. It is six years since the Queen took back\r\ninto her own hands the government of her subjects, red and white,\r\nin this country; it was thought her Indian children would be better\r\ncared for in her own hand. This is the seventh time in the last\r\nfive years that her Indian children have been called together for\r\nthis purpose; this is the fourth time that I have met my Indian\r\nbrothers, and standing here on this bright day with the sun above\r\nus, I cast my eyes to the East down to the great lakes and I see a\r\nbroad road leading from there to the Red River, I see it stretching\r\non to Ellice, I see it branching there, the one to Qu'Appelle and\r\nCypress Hills, the other by Pelly to Carlton; it is a wide and\r\nplain trail. Anyone can see it, and on that road, taking for the\r\nQueen, the hand of the Governor and Commissioners I see all the\r\nIndians. I see the Queen's Councillors taking the Indian by the\r\nhand saying we are brothers, we will lift you up, we will teach\r\nyou, if you will learn, the cunning of the white man. All along\r\nthat road I see Indians gathering, I see gardens growing and houses\r\nbuilding; I see them receiving money from the Queen's Commissioners\r\nto purchase clothing for their children; at the same time I see\r\nthem enjoying their hunting and fishing as before, I see them\r\nretaining their old mode of living with the Queen's gift in\r\naddition.\r\n\r\n\"I met the Crees at Carlton, they heard my words there, they read\r\nmy face, and through that my heart, and said my words were true,\r\nand they took my hand on behalf of the Queen. What they did I wish\r\nyou to do; I wish you to travel on the road I have spoken of, a\r\nroad I see stretching out broad and plain to the Rocky Mountains. I\r\nknow you have been told many stories, some of them not true; do not\r\nlisten to the bad voices of men who have their own ends to serve,\r\nlisten rather to those who have only your good at heart. I have\r\ncome a long way to meet you; last year I sent you a message that\r\nyou would be met this year, and I do not forget my promises.\r\n\r\n\"I went to Ottawa, where the Queen's Councillors have their council\r\nchamber, to talk, amongst other things, about you.\r\n\r\n\"I have come seven hundred miles to see you. Why should I take all\r\nthis trouble? For two reasons, first, the duty was put upon me as\r\none of the Queen's Councillors, to see you with my brother\r\nCommissioners, Hon. W. J. Christie and Hon. Jas. McKay. The other\r\nreason is a personal one, because since I was a young man my heart\r\nwas warm to the Indians, and I have taken a great interest in them;\r\nfor more than twenty-five years I have studied their condition in\r\nthe present and in the future. I have been many years in public\r\nlife, but the first words I spoke in public were for the Indians,\r\nand in that vision of the day I saw the Queen's white men\r\nunderstanding their duty; I saw them understanding that they had no\r\nright to wrap themselves up in a cold mantle of selfishness, that\r\nthey had no right to turn away and say, 'Am I my brother's keeper?'\r\nOn the contrary, I saw them saying, the Indians are our brothers,\r\nwe must try to help them to make a living for themselves and their\r\nchildren. I tell you, you must think of those who will come after\r\nyou. As I came here I saw tracks leading to the lakes and\r\nwater-courses, once well beaten, now grown over with grass; I saw\r\nbones bleaching by the wayside; I saw the places where the buffalo\r\nhad been, and I thought what will become of the Indian. I said to\r\nmyself, we must teach the children to prepare for the future; if we\r\ndo not, but a few suns will pass and they will melt away like snow\r\nbefore the sun in spring-time. You know my words are true; you see\r\nfor yourselves and know that your numbers are lessening every year.\r\nNow the whole burden of my message from the Queen is that we wish\r\nto help you in the days that are to come, we do not want to take\r\naway the means of living that you have now, we do not want to tie\r\nyou down; we want you to have homes of your own where your children\r\ncan be taught to raise for themselves food from the mother earth.\r\nYou may not all be ready for that, but some, I have no doubt, are,\r\nand in a short time others will follow. I am here to talk plainly,\r\nI have nothing to hide; I am here to tell you what we are ready to\r\ndo. Your tribe is not all here at the present time, some of the\r\nprincipal Chiefs are absent, this cannot be avoided, the country is\r\nwide and when the buffalo come near you must follow them; this does\r\nnot matter, for what I have to give is for the absent as well as\r\nfor the present. Next year if the treaty is made, a Commissioner\r\nwill be sent to you, and you will be notified of the times and\r\nplaces of meeting, so that you will not have long journeys; after\r\nthat, two or three servants of the Queen will be appointed to live\r\nin the country to look after the Indians, and see that the terms of\r\nthe treaty are carried out.\r\n\r\n\"I have not yet given you my message. I know you have heard what\r\nyour brothers did at Carlton, and I expect you to do the same here,\r\nfor if you do not you will be the first Indians who refused to take\r\nmy hand. At Carlton I had a slight difficulty; one of the Chiefs\r\ndreamt that instead of making the treaty at the camp of the great\r\nbody of the Indians, I made it at his, and so his people stood\r\naside. I was sorry for him and his people. I did not wish to go and\r\nleave them out. I sent him word after I had made the treaty, and\r\nbrought him in with the others. When I went to North-West Angle I\r\nmet the Chippewa nation; they were not all present, but the absent\r\nones were seen the next year. I told them the message from the\r\nQueen, and what she wished to do for them; in all four thousand\r\nIndians accepted the Treaty, and now, I am glad to say, many of\r\nthem have homes and gardens of their own. The next year I went to\r\nQu'Appelle and saw the Crees and Chippewas, and there five thousand\r\nunderstood us and took our hands. Last summer I went with Mr. McKay\r\nto Lake Winnipeg, and there all the Swampy Crees accepted the\r\nQueen's terms. Now I have stroked the pipe with your brothers at\r\nCarlton as with you.\r\n\r\n\"Three years ago a party of Assiniboines were shot by American\r\ntraders; men, women and children were killed; we reported the\r\naffair to Ottawa; we said the time has come when you must send the\r\nred-coated servants of the Queen to the North-West to protect the\r\nIndian from fire-water, from being shot down by men who know no\r\nlaw, to preserve peace between the Indians, to punish all who break\r\nthe law, to prevent whites from doing wrong to Indians, and they\r\nare here to-day to do honor to the office which I hold. Our Indian\r\nChiefs wear red coats, and wherever they meet the police they will\r\nknow they meet friends. I know that you have been told that if war\r\ncame you would be put in the front, this is not so. Your brothers\r\nat Carlton asked me that they might not be forced to fight, and I\r\ntell you, as I assured them, you will never be asked to fight\r\nagainst your will; and I trust the time will never come of war\r\nbetween the Queen and the great country near us.\r\n\r\n\"Again, I say, all we seek is your good; I speak openly, as brother\r\nto brother, as a father to his children, and I would give you a\r\nlast advice, hear my words, come and join the great band of Indians\r\nwho are walking hand-in-hand with us on the road I spoke of when I\r\nbegan--a road, I believe in my heart, will lead the Indian on to a\r\nmuch more comfortable state than he is in now. My words, when they\r\nare accepted, are written down, and they last, as I have said to\r\nthe others, as long as the sun shines and the river runs. I expect\r\nyou are prepared for the message I have to deliver, and I will wait\r\nto see if any of the Chiefs wish to speak before I go further.\"\r\n\r\nSweet Grass, the principal Cree Chief, rose, and taking the\r\nGovernor by the hand, said, \"We have heard what the Governor has\r\nsaid, and now the Indians want to hear the terms of the treaty,\r\nafter which they will all shake hands with the Governor and\r\nCommissioners, we then want to go to our camp to meet in council.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor then very carefully and distinctly explained the terms\r\nand promises of the treaty as made at Carlton; this was received by\r\nthe Indians with loud assenting exclamations.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th the Indians sent a message that they required further\r\ntime for deliberation, and the meeting was put off until the 9th.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 9th the Indians were slow in gathering, as\r\nthey wished to settle all difficulties and misunderstandings\r\namongst themselves before coming to the treaty tent, this was\r\napparently accomplished about eleven a.m., when the whole body\r\napproached and seated themselves in good order, when the Governor\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Indian children of the Great Queen, we meet again on a bright day;\r\nyou heard many words from me the other day; I delivered you my\r\nmessage from the Queen; I held out my hand in the Queen's name,\r\nfull of her bounty. You asked time to consult together; I gave it\r\nto you very gladly, because I did not come here to surprise you. I\r\ntrust the Great Spirit has put good thoughts into your hearts, and\r\nyour wise men have found my words good. I am now ready to hear\r\nwhether you are prepared to do as the great body of the Indian\r\npeople have done; it is now for the Indians to speak through those\r\nwhom they may choose; my heart is warm to you, and my ears are\r\nopen.\"\r\n\r\nKu-ye-win (The Eagle) addressed the Indians, telling them not to be\r\nafraid, that the Governor was to them as a brother; that what the\r\nQueen wished to establish through him was for their good, and if\r\nany of them wished to speak to do so.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting some time the Governor said, \"I had hoped the Indians\r\nwould have taken me at my word, and taken me as a brother and a\r\nfriend. True, I am the Queen's Governor; that I am here to-day\r\nshows me to be your friend. Why can you not open your hearts to me?\r\nI have met many Indians before, but this is the first time I have\r\nhad all the talking to do myself. Now, cast everything behind your\r\nbacks, and speak to me face to face. I have offered as we have done\r\nto the other Indians. Tell me now whether you will take my hand and\r\naccept it; there is nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to be afraid\r\nof; think of the good of your children and your children's\r\nchildren. Stand up now like wise men and tell me if you will take\r\nwhat I offered. I cannot believe it to be possible that you would\r\nthrow my hand back. Speak and do not be afraid or ashamed.\"\r\n\r\nWEE-KAS-KOO-KEE-SAY-YIN (Sweet Grass)--\"I thank you for this day,\r\nand also I thank you for what I have seen and heard, I also thank\r\nthe Queen for sending you to act for our good. I am glad to have a\r\nbrother and friend in you, which undoubtedly will raise us above\r\nour present condition. I am glad for your offers, and thank you\r\nfrom my heart. I speak this in the presence of the Divine Being. It\r\nis all for our good, I see nothing to be afraid of, I therefore\r\naccept of it gladly and take your hand to my heart, may this\r\ncontinue as long as this earth stands and the river flows. The\r\nGreat King, our Father, is now looking upon us this day, He regards\r\nall the people equal with one another; He has mercy on the whole\r\nearth; He has opened a new world to us. I have pity on all those\r\nwho have to live by the buffalo. If I am spared until this time\r\nnext year I want this my brother to commence to act for me,\r\nthinking thereby that the buffalo may be protected. It is for that\r\nreason I give you my hand. If spared, I shall commence at once to\r\nclear a small piece of land for myself, and others of my kinsmen\r\nwill do the same. We will commence hand in hand to protect the\r\nbuffalo. When I hold your hand I feel as if the Great Father were\r\nlooking on us both as brothers. I am thankful. May this earth here\r\nnever see the white man's blood spilt on it. I thank God that we\r\nstand together, that you all see us; I am thankful that I can raise\r\nup my head, and the white man and red man can stand together as\r\nlong as the sun shines. When I hold your hands and touch your\r\nheart, as I do now (suiting his action to the words), let us be as\r\none. Use your utmost to help me and help my children, so that they\r\nmay prosper.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief's remarks were assented to by the Indians by loud\r\nejaculations.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I rise with a glad heart; we have come together and\r\nunderstood each other. I am glad that you have seen the right way.\r\nI am glad you have accepted so unanimously the offer made. I will\r\ntell the Queen's Councillors what good hearts their Indian children\r\nhave; I will tell them that they think of the good of their\r\nchildren's children.\r\n\r\n\"I feel that we have done to-day a good work; the years will pass\r\naway and we with them, but the work we have done to-day will stand\r\nas the hills. What we have said and done has been written down; my\r\npromises at Carlton have been written down and cannot be rubbed\r\nout, so there can be no mistake about what is agreed upon. I will\r\nnow have the terms of the treaty fully read and explained to you,\r\nand before I go away I will leave a copy with your principal Chief.\r\n\r\n\"After I and the Commissioners, for the Queen, have signed the\r\ntreaty, I will call upon your Chief and Councillors to do the same;\r\nand before the payments are made by Mr. Christie, I will give the\r\nChiefs the medals of the Queen and their flags.\r\n\r\n\"Some of your Chiefs and people are away; next year we will send\r\nmen near to where their bands live, notice will be given, and those\r\nwho are away now will receive the present of money we are going to\r\ngive you, the same as if they had been here, and when you go back\r\nto the plains I ask you to tell your brothers what we have done.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor and Commissioners then signed the treaty on the part\r\nof the Queen, and nine Chiefs and as many of their Councillors as\r\nwere with them signed on behalf of the Indians.\r\n\r\nJames Seenum, Chief of White Fish Lake Crees, said that when he\r\ncommenced to cultivate the soil some years ago, Mr. Christie, then\r\nchief factor of the Hudson Bay Company, gave him a plough that he\r\nhad used but it was now broken. When he commenced he and his\r\nbrothers drew the plough themselves, and they pulled up roots and\r\nused them for hoes. Mr. Christie also gave me a pit-saw and a\r\ngrindstone, and I am using them yet. I feel my heart sore in the\r\nspring when my children want to plough--when they have no\r\nimplements to use, that is why I am asking them now to have them\r\nsent as soon as possible. By following what I have been taught I\r\nfind it helps me a great deal.\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE HUNTER--\"I am here alone just now; if I am spared to see\r\nnext spring, then I will select my Councillors, those that I think\r\nworthy I will choose. I am glad from my very heart. I feel in\r\ntaking the Governor's hand as if I was taking the Queen's. When I\r\nhear her words that she is going to put to rights this country, it\r\nis the help of God that has put it in her heart to come to our\r\nassistance. In sending her bounty to us I wish an everlasting grasp\r\nof her hand, as long as the sun moves and the river flows. I am\r\nglad that the truth and all good things have been opened to us. I\r\nam thankful for the children for they will prosper. All the\r\nchildren who are sitting here hope that the Great Spirit will look\r\ndown upon us as one.\"\r\n\r\nSEE-KAHS-KOOTCH (The Cut Arm)--\"I am glad of the goodness of the\r\ngreat Queen. I recognize now that this that I once dreaded most is\r\ncoming to my aid and doing for me what I could not do for myself.\"\r\n\r\nTUS-TUK-EE-SKUAIS--\"I am truly glad that the Queen has made a new\r\ncountry for me. I am glad that all my friends and children will not\r\nbe in want of food hereafter. I am glad that we have everything\r\nwhich we had before still extended to us.\"\r\n\r\nPEE-QUAY-SIS--\"I need not say anything; I have been well pleased\r\nwith all that I have heard, and I need not speak as we are all\r\nagreed.\"\r\n\r\nKIN-OO-SAY-OO (The Fish), Chief of the Chippewayans--\"I shake hands\r\nwith the Queen, and I am glad for what she is doing and what she is\r\nto do for us. If I could have used my own language I would then be\r\nable to say more.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor then called on Sweet Grass and placed the Queen's\r\nmedal around his neck, the band of the Police playing \"God save the\r\nQueen.\" The rest of the Chiefs' medals, flags and uniforms were\r\ngiven as soon as possible, and Mr. Christie proceeded to make the\r\npayments and distribute the presents.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 13th.\r\n\r\nThe Chiefs and head men came to pay their respects to the\r\nCommissioners in the morning, at Fort Pitt.\r\n\r\nSWEET GRASS--\"We are all glad to see you here, and we have come to\r\nsay good-bye before you leave.\"\r\n\r\nTHE BIG BEAR--\"I find it difficult to express myself, because some\r\nof the bands are not represented. I have come off to speak for the\r\ndifferent bands that are out on the plains. It is no small matter\r\nwe were to consult about. I expected the Chiefs here would have\r\nwaited until I arrived. The different bands that are out on the\r\nplains told me that I should speak in their stead; the Stony\r\nIndians as well. The people who have not come, stand as a barrier\r\nbefore what I would have had to say; my mode of living is hard.\"\r\n\r\nSWEET GRASS, to Big Bear--\"My friend, you see the representative of\r\nthe Queen here, who do you suppose is the maker of it. I think the\r\nGreat Spirit put it into their hearts to come to our help; I feel\r\nas if I saw life when I see the representative of the Queen; let\r\nnothing be a barrier between you and him; it is through great\r\ndifficulty this has been brought to us. Think of our children and\r\nthose to come after, there is life and succor for them, say yes and\r\ntake his hand.\"\r\n\r\nThe White Fish Lake Chief said, \"We have all taken it, and we think\r\nit is for our good.\"\r\n\r\nBIG BEAR--\"Stop, stop, my friends, I have never seen the Governor\r\nbefore; I have seen Mr. Christie many times. I heard the Governor\r\nwas to come and I said I shall see him; when I see him I will make\r\na request that he will save me from what I most dread, that is: the\r\nrope to be about my neck (hanging), it was not given to us by the\r\nGreat Spirit that the red man or white man should shed each other's\r\nblood.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"It was given us by the Great Spirit, man should not shed\r\nhis brother's blood, and it was spoken to us that he who shed his\r\nbrother's blood, should have his own spilt.\r\n\r\n\"No good Indian has the rope about his neck. If a white man killed\r\nan Indian, not in self defence, the rope would be put around his\r\nneck. He saw red-coats, they were here to protect Indians and\r\nwhites.\r\n\r\n\"If a man tried to kill you, you have a right to defend; but no man\r\nhas a right to kill another in cold blood, and we will do all we\r\ncan to punish such. The good Indian need never be afraid; their\r\nlives will be safer than ever before. Look at the condition of the\r\nBlackfeet. Before the red-coats went, the Americans were taking\r\ntheir furs and robes and giving them whiskey--we stopped it, they\r\nhave been able to buy back two thousand horses--before that, robes\r\nwould have gone to Americans for whiskey.\"\r\n\r\nBIG BEAR--\"What we want is that we should hear what will make our\r\nhearts glad, and all good peoples' hearts glad. There were plenty\r\nthings left undone, and it does not look well to leave them so.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I do not know what has been left undone!\"\r\n\r\nBIG BEAR said he would like to see his people before he acted. \"I\r\nhave told you what I wish, that there be no hanging.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"What you ask will not be granted, why are you so anxious\r\nabout bad men?\r\n\r\n\"The Queen's law punishes murder with death, and your request\r\ncannot be granted.\"\r\n\r\nBIG BEAR--\"Then these Chiefs will help us to protect the buffalo,\r\nthat there may be enough for all. I have heard what has been said,\r\nand I am glad we are to be helped; but why do these men not speak?\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the Chippewayans said, \"We do not speak, because Sweet\r\nGrass has spoken for us all. What he says, we all say.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I wish the Bear to tell Short Tail and See-yah-kee-maht,\r\nthe other Chiefs, what has been done, and that it is for them, as\r\nif they had been here. Next year they and their people can join the\r\ntreaty and they will lose nothing. I wish you to understand fully\r\nabout two questions, and tell the others. The North-West Council is\r\nconsidering the framing of a law to protect the buffaloes, and when\r\nthey make it, they will expect the Indians to obey it. The\r\nGovernment will not interfere with the Indian's daily life, they\r\nwill not bind him. They will only help him to make a living on the\r\nreserves, by giving him the means of growing from the soil, his\r\nfood. The only occasion when help would be given, would be if\r\nProvidence should send a great famine or pestilence upon the whole\r\nIndian people included in the treaty. We only looked at something\r\nunforseen and not at hard winters or the hardships of single bands,\r\nand this, both you and I, fully understood.\r\n\r\n\"And now I have done, I am going away. The country is large,\r\nanother Governor will be sent in my place; I trust you will receive\r\nhim as you have done me, and give him your confidence. He will live\r\namongst you. Indians of the plains, I bid you farewell. I never\r\nexpect to see you again, face to face. I rejoice that you listened\r\nto me, and when I go back to my home beyond the great lakes, I will\r\noften think of you and will rejoice to hear of your prosperity. I\r\nask God to bless you and your children. Farewell.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians responded by loud ejaculations of satisfaction, and the\r\nChiefs and Councillors, commencing with Sweet Grass, each shook\r\nhands with the Governor, and addressed him in words of parting,\r\nelevating his hand, as they grasped it, to heaven, and invoking the\r\nblessings of the Great Spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Bear remained sitting until all had said good-bye to the\r\nGovernor, and then he rose and taking his hand, said, \"I am glad to\r\nmeet you, I am alone; but if I had known the time, I would have\r\nbeen here with all my people. I am not an undutiful child, I do not\r\nthrow back your hand; but as my people are not here, I do not sign.\r\nI will tell them what I have heard, and next year I will come.\"\r\nAbout an hour afterwards the Big Bear came to the Fort Pitt House\r\nto see the Governor, and again repeated that he accepted the treaty\r\nas if he had signed it, and would come next year, with all his\r\npeople, to meet the Commissioners and accept it.\r\n\r\nThe Governor and party left Fort Pitt for Battle River, on the 13th\r\nat one o'clock, and arrived there on the 15th. There were no\r\nIndians there, except the Red Pheasant's band, who had been treated\r\nwith at Battle River.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th the Red Pheasant and his Councillors came to see the\r\nGovernor and the Commissioners, with the following result:\r\n\r\nTHE RED PHEASANT--\"I am a Battle River Indian, and I have chosen\r\nthis place before, and I am glad to see the Government here too, as\r\nI know there is a chance of living. I want the Half-breed claims at\r\nBattle River to be respected, and I do not wish to turn out any\r\nwhite man; but I wish to return to my former mode of life.\r\n\r\n\"Ever since my grandfather lived at Battle River, it has been my\r\nhome. Our houses were swept off by a flood two years ago, and after\r\nthat we repaired some old houses that were built by outsiders\r\n(other Indians), and we had fenced in the buildings; but a short\r\ntime ago some Canadians arrived, knocked down the fences, and built\r\ninside the enclosure.\"\r\n\r\nWAH-TAH-NEE--\"We had chosen a point about a mile from the spot\r\nwhere we are now speaking, and got out logs for fences and houses,\r\nand when we returned from the plains we found they had all been\r\ntaken away. There are now twenty families, and ten more to come in\r\nfrom the plains.\r\n\r\n\"We wish to be remembered to the Queen, and we are thankful to see\r\nthe Queen's soldiers coming to make their homes on the land that we\r\nhave been brought up on. I hope that the Queen will look upon our\r\npoverty when she hears that we are poor Indians and have welcomed\r\nher people to live amongst us. This is my country where I have\r\nlived. I want to make way for the Queen's men, and I ask her in\r\nreturn to keep me from want. Next spring I want to plant here,\r\nwherever I can get a piece of ground. By that time I may have\r\nselected a spot for my reserve. The reason I want to select my\r\nreserve is, that I do not want to be cramped up by settlers. In the\r\nmeantime I do not want any white men to settle on the Eagle Hills.\r\n\r\n\"When I see that we are numerous, it will be the Eagle Hills I will\r\nselect as our reserve, although I am very reluctant to leave the\r\nplace I have been brought up on. If I see that we are not likely to\r\nbe numerous, I may select some other place across the Saskatchewan\r\nRiver. This man, Peter Ballendine, knows that it is not because\r\nsettlers are coming here that we speak of this place, Battle River,\r\nbut because we were here from of old. I wish that the Governor\r\nshould give us some advice to think over during the winter.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I am glad to give you a word of advice. Next summer,\r\nCommissioners will come to make payments here, so that you may not\r\nhave so far to go, and also that other Indians we have not seen,\r\nshould come here also, to whom it may be convenient, and I hope\r\nthat then you will be able to talk with them where you want your\r\nreserve. I will speak to you frankly, as if I was talking to my own\r\nchildren; the sooner you select a place for your reserve the\r\nbetter, so that you can have the animals and agricultural\r\nimplements promised to you, and so that you may have the increase\r\nfrom the animals, and the tools to help you build houses, &c. When\r\nyou are away hunting and fishing, the heat of the sun and the rain\r\nis making your crops to grow. I think you are showing wisdom in\r\ntaking a place away from here, although it has been your home. It\r\nis better for the Indian to be away a little piece from the white\r\nman. You will be near enough to bring your furs to a good market,\r\nand by and by I hope you will have more potatoes than you require,\r\nand have some to dispose of. I am very anxious that you should\r\nthink over this, and be able to tell the Commissioner next year\r\nwhere you want your reserve.\r\n\r\n\"I have asked Mr. Fuller to let you have three acres of land to\r\nplant your potatoes next spring, and he has replied that he will be\r\nvery happy to let you do so, and to plough it for you as well, in\r\nthe field he has enclosed.\r\n\r\n\"I am much pleased with the conduct of the Battle River Crees, and\r\nwill report it to the Queen's Councillors. I hope you will be\r\nprosperous and happy.\"\r\n\r\nThis closed the interview.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners left Battle River on the 19th of September. The\r\nLieutenant-Governor arrived at Fort Garry on the 6th of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTREATY NUMBER SEVEN; OR THE BLACKFEET TREATY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe making of this treaty, which completed the series of treaties,\r\nextending from Lake Superior to the slopes of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nwas entrusted, by the Privy Council, to the Hon. David Laird (who,\r\nafter the effecting of the Carlton and Fort Pitt Treaties, had, in\r\n1876, been appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West\r\nTerritories, subsequently to the erection of these territories into\r\na distinct Government) and Lieut.-Col. McLeod, of the Mounted\r\nPolice Force. The necessity which had arisen for making the treaty\r\nis thus stated by the Hon. the Minister of the Interior, the Hon.\r\nDavid Mills, in his Annual Report for 1877:\r\n\r\n\"The conclusion, in 1876, of the treaty with the Crees, Assiniboine\r\nand Saulteaux Indians (being the sixth of the series of treaties up\r\nto that time negotiated with the Indians of the North-West) left\r\nbut a small portion of the territory lying between the boundary\r\nline and the 54th parallel of latitude unsurrendered.\r\n\r\n\"The unsurrendered portion of the territory, including about fifty\r\nthousand square miles, lies at the south-west angle of the\r\nterritories, north of the boundary line, east of the Rocky\r\nMountains, south of Red River (Treaty Number Six) and west of the\r\nCypress Hills, or Treaty Number Four. This portion of the\r\nNorth-West is occupied by the Blackfeet, Blood, and Sarcees or\r\nPiegan Indians, some of the most warlike and intelligent but\r\nintractable bands of the North-West. These bands have for years\r\npast been anxiously expecting to be treated with, and have been\r\nmuch disappointed at the delay of negotiations.\r\n\r\n\"In last year's report I stated that His Honor Lieut.-Gov. Morris,\r\nvery strongly recommended that no further delay should take place\r\nin entering into negotiations with these Indians. His Honor\r\nreported, in effect, \"that there was a general consent of opinion\r\namongst the missionaries settled in that territory, and others who\r\nare acquainted with these Indians, as to the desirableness of\r\nhaving such a treaty made at the earliest possible date, with a\r\nview to preserving the present friendly disposition of these\r\ntribes, which might easily give place to feelings of an unfriendly\r\nor hostile nature, should the treaty negotiations be much longer\r\ndelayed.\"\r\n\r\n\"In view of these facts, and in order to satisfy these important\r\ntribes, and to prevent the difficulties which might hereafter arise\r\nthrough the settlement of whites, who are already flocking into\r\nFort McLeod and other portions of this territory, Your Excellency\r\ndecided that these Indians should be treated with this year, and\r\nthe Indians were notified accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"His Honor Mr. Laird, the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West\r\nTerritories, and Lieut.-Col. James F. McLeod, C.M.G., were selected\r\nby Your Excellency to negotiate the treaty. The former of these\r\ngentlemen, had assisted in 1874 in negotiating Treaty Number Four,\r\nwith the Cree and Saulteaux Indians, and the latter, during his\r\nresidence for some years past at Fort McLeod, as Commandant of the\r\nMounted Police Force, had acquired the entire confidence and good\r\nwill of the Indian tribes proposed to be dealt with.\"\r\n\r\nBesides all this, the Chiefs of the Blackfeet, in 1876, sent to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, a letter, with\r\nregard to a treaty, and also by a messenger, in whom they had\r\nconfidence, a message, to a similar effect. The Blackfeet Indians\r\nare a bold and warlike race. When the Sioux war with the United\r\nStates was about being initiated, the Sioux invited them to join in\r\nthe war, but they promptly refused. They are unlikely to become\r\nfarmers, but as the country they inhabit presents unusual\r\nfacilities for that industry, they may be induced to adopt a\r\npastoral life. They already possess large herds of horses, and may\r\nbe taught to raise cattle also.\r\n\r\nI requested the Rev. C. Scollen, who had for many years been a\r\nmissionary among the Plain Crees, and latterly, for several years,\r\namong the Blackfeet, to make a report to me of the character,\r\nhabits and condition of this nation, with which request he\r\nwillingly complied. I now give place to this report, which gives a\r\nvivid view of the character of this bold and warlike race, and\r\nshews the benefits they had, so far back as 1876, derived from the\r\npresence of the Mounted Police, the prohibition of liquor, and the\r\nestablishment of law and order in the North-West Territories, under\r\nCanadian rule. I may here remark, that another great benefit has\r\nresulted from the judicious steps taken by the Canadian Government,\r\nand that is the cessation of warfare between the various tribes,\r\nwhich was before of constant occurrence. An intelligent Ojibbeway\r\nIndian trader told me, that the change was wonderful. \"Before,\" he\r\nsaid, \"the Queen's Government came, we were never safe, and now,\"\r\nhe said, \"I can sleep in my tent anywhere, and have no fear. I can\r\ngo to the Blackfeet, and Cree camps, and they treat me as a\r\nfriend.\" The report of Mr. Scollen is as follows:\r\n\r\nFORT PITT, September 8th, 1876.\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR OF MANITOBA.\r\n\r\nEXCELLENT GOVERNOR,--Having had some years of experience as a\r\nmissionary amongst the Cree and Blackfeet Indians of the North-West\r\nTerritory, I humbly undertake to submit to your consideration a few\r\ndetails regarding the latter tribe of Her Majesty's Indian\r\nsubjects. I do this with all the more confidence as the successful\r\nway in which you conducted the treaty with the Carlton Indians (a\r\ntreaty including no small difficulties), has convinced me of your\r\nthorough knowledge of the character of this people. But, although\r\nthe general character of all the tribes may be nearly the same, yet\r\nin their social dispositions they sometimes materially differ, and\r\nthis, I think, will be found to be the case with the Crees and\r\nBlackfeet when compared on that point. The Crees have always looked\r\nupon the white man as a friend, or, to use their own language, as a\r\nbrother. They have never been afraid of him, nor have they given\r\nhim any cause to be afraid of them. The Blackfeet have acted\r\nsomewhat differently; they have regarded the white man as a\r\ndemi-god, far superior to themselves in intelligence, capable of\r\ndoing them good or evil, according as he might be well or ill\r\ndisposed towards them, unscrupulous in his dealings with others,\r\nand consequently a person to be flattered, feared and shunned, and\r\neven injured, whenever this could be done with impunity. I am not\r\nnow describing the Blackfeet of the present day, but those of\r\nfifteen years ago, when I first saw them. They were then a proud,\r\nhaughty, numerous people (perhaps ten thousand on the British side\r\nof the line), having a regular politico-religious organization by\r\nwhich their thirst for blood and their other barbarous passions\r\nwere constantly fired to the highest pitch of frenzy. Since that\r\ntime their number has decreased to less than one half, and their\r\nsystematic organizations have fallen into decay; in fact they have\r\nbeen utterly demoralized as a people. This sudden decadence was\r\nbrought on by two causes: 1. About ten years ago the Americans\r\ncrossed the line and established themselves on Pelly River, where\r\nthey carried on to an extraordinary extent the illicit traffic in\r\nintoxicating liquor to the Blackfeet. The fiery water flowed as\r\nfreely, if I may use the metaphor, as the streams running from the\r\nRocky Mountains, and hundreds of the poor Indians fell victims to\r\nthe white man's craving for money, some poisoned, some frozen to\r\ndeath whilst in a state of intoxication, and many shot down by\r\nAmerican bullets. 2. Then in 1870 came that disease so fatal to\r\nIndians, the small-pox which told upon the Blackfeet with terrible\r\neffect, destroying between six hundred and eight hundred of them.\r\nSurviving relatives went more and more for the use of alcohol; they\r\nendeavoured to drown their grief in the poisonous beverage. They\r\nsold their robes and their horses by the hundred for it, and now\r\nthey began killing one another, so that in a short time they were\r\ndivided into several small parties, afraid to meet. Fortunately for\r\nthem the Government were aware of the state of affairs in the\r\ncountry and did not remain indifferent to it; and, as I have heard\r\nyourself explain to the Indians, Her Gracious Majesty has at heart\r\nthe welfare of even the most obscure of her subjects. In the summer\r\nof 1874, I was travelling amongst the Blackfeet. It was painful to\r\nme to see the state of poverty to which they had been reduced.\r\nFormerly they had been the most opulent Indians in the country, and\r\nnow they were clothed in rags, without horses and without guns. But\r\nthis was the year of their salvation; that very summer the Mounted\r\nPolice were struggling against the difficulties of a long journey\r\nacross the barren plains in order to bring them help. This noble\r\ncorps reached their destination that same fall, and with magic\r\neffect put an entire stop to the abominable traffic of whiskey with\r\nthe Indians. Since that time the Blackfeet Indians are becoming\r\nmore and more prosperous. They are now well clothed and well\r\nfurnished with horses and guns. During the last two years I have\r\ncalculated that they have bought two thousand horses to replace\r\nthose they had given for whiskey. They are forced to acknowledge\r\nthat the arrival of the Red Coats has been to them the greatest\r\nboon. But, although they are externally so friendly to the Police\r\nand other strangers who now inhabit their country, yet underneath\r\nthis friendship remains hidden some of that dread which they have\r\nalways had of the white man's intention to cheat them; and here,\r\nexcellent Governor, I will state my reasons for believing that a\r\ntreaty should be concluded with them also at the earliest possible\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n1st. The Blackfeet are extremely jealous of what they consider\r\ntheir country, and never allowed any white men, Half-breeds, or\r\nCrees to remain in it for any length of time; the only reason that\r\nthey never drove the Americans off, apart from their love for\r\nwhiskey, was their dread of the Henri rifle.\r\n\r\n2nd. They have an awful dread of the future. They think that the\r\nPolice are in the country not only to keep out whiskey traders, but\r\nalso to protect white people against them, and that this country\r\nwill be gradually taken from them without any ceremony. This I can\r\ncertify, for although they may not say so to others yet they do not\r\nhide it from me.\r\n\r\n3rd. Numbers of people are settling around Fort McLeod and Fort\r\nCalgary in order to farm, raise stock, etc. This will probably\r\ndrive the buffalo away through time from the ordinary hunting\r\ngrounds, and if so, the Blackfeet, being the most helpless Indians\r\nin the country, and unaccustomed to anything else but hunting\r\nbuffalo, would suffer extremely.\r\n\r\n4th. The settlers also are anxious that a treaty be made as soon as\r\npossible, so that they may know what portions of land they can hold\r\nwithout fear of being molested.\r\n\r\n5th. The Blackfeet themselves are expecting to have a mutual\r\nunderstanding with the Government, because they have been told of\r\nit by several persons, and namely by Gen. Smythe last year.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal reasons which occur to my mind for making a\r\ntreaty with the Blackfeet. It remains for you, excellent Governor,\r\nto weigh their value. Of course you would find the same prejudices\r\namongst the Blackfeet that you have found amongst the Crees, but\r\nyou would have no greater difficulty in dispelling them. You would\r\nhave four clans to treat with, viz.: the Blackfeet, Bloods, and\r\nPiegans, all of the same tribe, and the Sarcees, a branch of the\r\nPeace River Indians called Beavers. As to the place of rendezvous\r\nthere would be no difficulty whatever; the Blackfeet live in large\r\ncamps under their respective Chiefs, and could go to any point\r\nafter due notice.\r\n\r\nIt remains for me now, excellent Governor, to beg you to excuse the\r\nmany defects of this communication, and to accept the assurance of\r\nsincere esteem and profound respect of\r\n\r\n                Your most humble servant,\r\n                        CONSTANTINE SCOLLEN,\r\n                                Priest, O.U.I.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I am also aware that the Sioux Indians, now at war with the\r\nAmericans, have sent a message to the Blackfeet tribe, asking them\r\nto make an alliance offensive and defensive against all white\r\npeople in the country.\r\n\r\nC. SCOLLEN.\r\n\r\nIn order to effect a treaty, Lieut.-Gov. Laird, and Lieut.-Col.\r\nJames F. McLeod, met the Blackfeet, at the Blackfoot crossing, on\r\nthe Bow River on the 17th day of September, 1877, which day had\r\nbeen selected for the time of meeting. Gov. Laird proceeded from\r\nthe temporary seat of the Government of the North-West Territories\r\nat Swan River, and Col. McLeod from Fort McLeod, the head quarters\r\nof the Mounted Police, to the appointed rendezvous.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners met the Indians on that day, and after five days\r\nof tedious negotiations, the treaty was satisfactorily concluded,\r\nand signed by the Chiefs and head men present.\r\n\r\nThe total number of the Indians, represented at the making of the\r\ntreaty, and who were paid the gratuity under it, was four thousand\r\nthree hundred and ninety-two. The terms of the treaty, were\r\nsubstantially the same as those contained in the North-West Angle\r\nand Qu'Appelle treaties, except that as some of the bands were\r\ndisposed to engage in pastoral pursuits, it was arranged to give\r\nthem cattle instead of agricultural implements. The Minister of the\r\nInterior well observes in his report \"that the conclusion of this\r\ntreaty with these warlike and intractable tribes, at a time when\r\nthe Indian tribes, immediately across the border, were engaged in\r\nopen hostilities with the United States troops, is certainly a\r\nconclusive proof of the just policy of the Government of Canada\r\ntoward the aboriginal population,\" and, I add, of the confidence of\r\nthe Indians in the promises and just dealing of the servants of the\r\nBritish Crown, in Canada, a confidence that can only be kept up by\r\nthe strictest observance of the stipulations of the treaties.\r\n\r\nI now append the interesting despatch of Lieut.-Gov. Laird, giving\r\na detailed account of the negotiation of the treaty, and a report\r\nof the speeches of the Commissioners and Indians, extracted from a\r\nreport in the Globe newspaper, dated October 4th, 1877, which,\r\nthough not authentic, I believe, gives a general view of what\r\npassed during the negotiations.\r\n\r\n                GOVERNMENT HOUSE,\r\n           BATTLEFORD, NORTH-WEST TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to inform you that on the 4th August I\r\nreceived at Swan River your telegram dated on the first of that\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nIt notified me that a Commission appointing Lieut.-Col. James F.\r\nMcLeod, C.M.G., and myself, Commissioners to negotiate a treaty\r\nwith the Blackfeet and other Indians of the unsurrendered parts of\r\nthe North-West Territories adjoining the United States boundary,\r\nhad been forwarded to Fort McLeod.\r\n\r\nI immediately made preparations for the journey. These occupied me\r\na week, as arrangements had to be made for the removal of furniture\r\nand other property to Battle River, where the Government House for\r\nthe territories, in course of construction, would probably be ready\r\nfor occupation on my return from the treaty negotiations. On the\r\n11th August I left Swan River for Fort McLeod, via Battleford,\r\nproposing to go from the latter place by Cypress Hills to my\r\ndestination. I took the Quill Lake trail and came to the telegraph\r\nline, about four miles from Big Stone Lake. Thence I followed\r\nthat line until I came to the trail at the elbow of the North\r\nSaskatchewan leading to Battle River. Where the telegraph crosses\r\nthe South Saskatchewan I found an excellent ferry scow, and a\r\nferryman placed there by the Public Works Department. I arrived at\r\nthe ferry about noon on the 20th, and though a high wind rendered\r\nit difficult to manage the scow, the horses, with the vehicles and\r\ntheir contents, were safely ferried before sunset. On the following\r\nevening I reached the Elbow, and the morning thereafter before\r\nleaving camp, Inspector Walker, of Battleford, drove up, on his\r\nway to Carlton, to arrange for the distribution of certain of the\r\narticles intended for the Indians of Treaty Number Six, which had\r\nnot arrived when he paid the annuities at that post in the early\r\npart of the month. Some of the Indians had not dispersed since\r\nthey received their payments, and interested parties were causing\r\ndissatisfaction among them by reporting that the provisions\r\nintended for them, while assembled to receive their annuities,\r\nhaving now arrived, should be distributed to them, as well as the\r\nagricultural implements and other articles promised.\r\n\r\nI advised Inspector Walker to distribute to those Indians still\r\naround Carlton their share of the presents, and to give them a\r\nsmall quantity of provisions from the Government supplies, to\r\nenable them to proceed without delay to their hunting grounds. I\r\nthen continued my journey to Battleford, which I reached on Monday,\r\nthe 24th, at noon. Here I was happy to meet Major Irvine, who\r\nhad come straight from Fort McLeod, across the Great Plains, to\r\nconduct me on my journey, and to inform me that for satisfactory\r\nreasons adduced by Crowfoot, the leading chief of the Blackfeet,\r\nLieut.-Col. McLeod, my associate Commissioner, had consented that\r\nthe meeting of the treaty should be held at the Blackfoot crossing\r\nof the Bow River, instead of at Fort McLeod. Major Irvine had\r\nreached Battleford only a few hours before me, and having a\r\nBlackfoot Indian as guide, I abandoned my intention of going to\r\nFort McLeod by Cypress Hills, and resolved to take the more direct\r\nand much shorter course by which that officer came.\r\n\r\nOn Friday I had interviews with several parties on business, among\r\nwhom were Red Pheasant, the Chief of the Battle River Crees, and\r\na portion of his band. He desired explanations about the articles\r\npromised in the treaty of last year, and the reason they were so\r\nlate in being forwarded. I explained that the unusually heavy rains\r\nin Manitoba and the eastern portion of the territories had made the\r\ntravelling so bad that the freighters had not been able to overtake\r\nthe journey in the time which they expected; that the Government\r\nwere very sorry at the disappointment, as it was their desire to\r\nfaithfully carry out all their promises. The officers here had done\r\ntheir best to meet the difficulty and satisfy the Indians, though\r\nat no little expense to the country.\r\n\r\nThe Chief appeared to be quite satisfied with the explanation, and\r\nafter some further conversation about the reserve, which he desires\r\nto be located at Eagle Hills, he and his companions retired to\r\ntheir lodges, situated for the present close to the south side of\r\nBattle River, under the bank in front of Government House.\r\n\r\nInspector Walker having kindly given instructions to the\r\nnon-commissioned officer in charge of the Mounted Police in his\r\nabsence, that every assistance in his power was to be afforded to\r\nme for continuing my journey, I was enabled to leave Battleford for\r\nFort McLeod with Major Irvine, on the 25th August. Besides us two,\r\nthe party consisted of four police constables, my personal servant\r\nand the guide.\r\n\r\nFor the first day we followed a trail leading southward, but\r\nafterwards our course was across the trackless plains until we\r\napproached near our destination. On the third day out we first\r\nsighted buffalo, and every day subsequently that we travelled,\r\nexcept the last, we saw herds of the animals. Most of the herds,\r\nhowever, were small, and we remarked with regret that very few\r\ncalves of this season were to be seen. We observed portions of many\r\nbuffalo carcasses on our route, from not a few of which the\r\npeltries had not been removed. From this circumstance, as well as\r\nfrom the fact that many of the skins are made into parchments and\r\ncoverings for lodges, and are used for other purposes, I concluded\r\nthat the export of buffalo robes from the territories does not\r\nindicate even one-half the number of those valuable animals\r\nslaughtered annually in our country.\r\n\r\nAntelope, though not very abundant, are widely scattered over the\r\nplains. The numerous lakelets abound with water fowl. Some of the\r\npools contain alkali, but we experienced no inconvenience on the\r\njourney from scarcity of fresh water. The grass in many places is\r\nshort and thin, but in the hollows feed for horses is easily\r\nobtained. Altogether, though the plains are perfectly treeless, not\r\neven a shrub being visible, a journey across them in fine weather,\r\nsuch as we experienced, when the \"buffalo chips\" are sufficiently\r\ndry to make a good camp fire, is not disagreeable.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 29th we reached the lowest ford of the Red\r\nDeer River, one hundred and sixty-eight miles, by our course, from\r\nBattleford. On the north side of the river at this ford there is\r\nquicksand. The water too, in mid-stream, was deep enough to flow\r\nover the side-boards of our waggons, and at one place the current\r\nwas dangerously rapid. After repeated trials by some of the men on\r\nhorseback to find the best footing, we made the attempt, and the\r\nwhole party got safely across by night-fall. On Saturday evening,\r\nthe 1st of September, we arrived at the Blackfoot crossing of the\r\nBow River, one hundred and eighteen miles from where we forded the\r\nRed Deer River. The Bow River is a noble stream. The current is\r\npretty rapid, but at this \"ridge under the water\" (which is the\r\nliteral translation of the Blackfoot name for the ford) the bed of\r\nthe river is pebbly and the footing consequently good. Though we\r\nfound the water almost as deep as at the Red Deer River, yet under\r\nthe guidance of Mr. French, a small trader who lives near the ford,\r\nwe, without almost any delay, crossed bravely over and camped until\r\nMonday morning on the south bank of the river.\r\n\r\nAt this crossing, where the Indians had latterly been notified to\r\nassemble for the treaty, there is a beautiful river bottom on the\r\nsouth side of the river. It extended about one mile back from the\r\nriver, and is some three miles in length. The river, as far as the\r\neye can reach, is skirted close to the water by a narrow belt of\r\ncotton-wood and other trees.\r\n\r\nWhen I surveyed the clear waters of the stream, the fuel and\r\nshelter which the wood afforded, the excellent herbage on hill and\r\ndale, and the Indians camped in the vicinity crossing and\r\nre-crossing the river on the \"ridge\" with ease and safety, I was\r\nnot surprised that the Blackfeet were attached to the locality, and\r\ndesired that such an important event in their history as concluding\r\na treaty with Her Majesty's Commissioners should take place at this\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday evening and Sunday several of the Indians called to\r\nshake hands with me, among whom was the Rainy Chief of the North\r\nBloods. Here also I met Monsieur Jean L. Heureux, a French\r\nCanadian, who had spent nearly twenty years of his life among the\r\nBlackfeet. From him I obtained much valuable information respecting\r\nthe numbers and wishes of the Indians, together with an elaborate\r\nlist of the different Chiefs and minor Chiefs of the Blackfeet,\r\nBloods, Piegans, and Sarcees, with the principal families of\r\ntheir respective tribes and clans of divisions. This list the\r\nCommissioners found very useful in enabling them to understand the\r\nrelative influence of the several Chiefs and the strength of their\r\nbands.\r\n\r\nOn our journey, while within the limits of Treaty Number Six, we\r\nmet scarcely any Indians, but after we crossed Red Deer River we\r\nmet a few Crees and Half-breeds, and several hunting parties of\r\nBlackfeet. The former generally use carts in travelling, but the\r\nBlackfeet and their associates are always on horseback.\r\n\r\nThe Crees appeared friendly, but were not so demonstrative as the\r\nBlackfeet, who always rode up at once with a smile on their\r\ncountenances and shook hands with us. They knew the uniform of the\r\nMounted Police at a distance, and at once recognized and approached\r\nthem as their friends.\r\n\r\nWe resumed our journey on Monday and arrived at Fort McLeod on the\r\nOld Man's River, on Tuesday the 4th September. The distance between\r\nthe Blackfoot crossing of the Bow River and the Fort is about\r\nseventy-nine miles, thus making the length of our journey from\r\nBattleford three hundred and sixty-five miles as measured by Major\r\nIrvine's odometer.\r\n\r\nA few miles from Fort McLeod I was met by the Commissioners of the\r\nMounted Police and a large party of the Force, who escorted me into\r\nthe Fort, while a salute was fired by the artillery company from\r\none of the hills overlooking the line of march. The men, whose\r\nhorses were in excellent condition, looked exceedingly well, and\r\nthe officers performed their duties in a most efficient manner. The\r\nvillagers presented me with an address of welcome, and altogether\r\nmy reception at Fort McLeod was such as to satisfy the most\r\nfastidious lover of display, and more than enough to satisfy the\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\nAt Fort McLeod, on my arrival, I received your despatch of first\r\nAugust, covering the Commission relating to the Treaty and a copy\r\nof the Order in Council of 12th July, in terms of which the\r\ncommission was issued. Also your letter of 27th July informing me\r\nthat it had been thought desirable to place the services of the\r\nRev. Father Lacombe at the disposal of the Commissioners while\r\nnegotiating the treaty. A few days afterwards I was sorry to learn\r\nby telegraph that the reverend gentleman had been taken by illness\r\non the journey and would be unable to be present at the meeting\r\nwith the Indians. Here, however I was happy to meet Rev. Father\r\nScollen, a Roman Catholic missionary, who has labored for some\r\nyears among the Crees and Blackfeet in the western portion of the\r\nterritories. He kindly furnished me such information as he\r\npossessed, and afterwards went to the treaty, where his assistance\r\nwas of some value, particularly in dealing with the Crees present.\r\n\r\nWhile at the fort I had interviews with several of the Blood\r\nChiefs, who called upon me to inquire if they could not be treated\r\nwith there instead of at Bow River. I explained that hereafter the\r\nGovernment would endeavor to pay them their annuities at places\r\nmost convenient for them, but that on the occasion of making a\r\ntreaty it was desirable that the several Chiefs and their principal\r\nhead men should meet together to talk over the matter, so that all\r\nmight feel that they had been consulted as to the terms of the\r\nagreement. They went away satisfied, said they would do as the\r\nGreat Father advised, and go to Bow River.\r\n\r\nI cannot speak too highly of the kind manner in which the officers\r\nand men of the Mounted Police at Fort McLeod treat their Indian\r\nvisitors. Though the red man is somewhat intrusive, I never heard a\r\nharsh word employed in asking him to retire. The beneficial effects\r\nof this treatment, of the exclusion of intoxicants from the\r\ncountry, and of impartially administering justice to whites and\r\nIndians alike, were apparent in all my interviews with the Indians.\r\nThey always spoke of the officers of the Police in the highest\r\nterms, and of the Commander of the Force, Lieut.-Col. McLeod,\r\nespecially as their great benefactor. The leading Chiefs of the\r\nBlackfeet and kindred tribes, declared publicly at the treaty that\r\nhad it not been for the Mounted Police they would have all been\r\ndead ere this time.\r\n\r\nHaving rested a week after my tedious journey of over seven hundred\r\nmiles, I then occupied myself for a few days in viewing the\r\nsurrounding country. In the village I found some excellent stores,\r\nsupplied with almost every article of dry goods, hardware and\r\ngroceries, that any inland community requires. Notably among these\r\nwere the stores of J. G. Baker & Co. and Messrs. T. C. Power & Bro.\r\nThere is also a good blacksmith's shop in the village in which coal\r\nis used from the Pelly River, at a place some twenty miles distant\r\nfrom Fort McLeod. I was told by the proprietor of the shop that the\r\ncoal answers tolerably well for blacksmithing purposes, and in the\r\nfort it is extensively used for fuel. It burns nearly as well in a\r\nstove as some varieties of Pictou coal.\r\n\r\nThe land around the fort, and indeed for almost the whole distance\r\nbetween the Bow and Old Man's Rivers, is well adapted for grazing;\r\nand where cultivation has been fairly attempted this season, grain\r\nand vegetables have been a success. In short, I have very little\r\ndoubt that this portion of the territories, before many years, will\r\nabound in herds of cattle, and be dotted with not a few comfortable\r\nhomesteads.\r\n\r\nLieut.-Col. McLeod having attended to forwarding the supplies to\r\nBow River, which had been previously delivered at the fort, left\r\nfor the Blackfoot crossing with some eighty officers and men of\r\nthe Police Force, on Wednesday, the 12th September. I followed on\r\nFriday, and reached Bow River on Sunday morning. The Police having\r\narrived on Saturday, the Commissioners were fully prepared for\r\nbusiness on Monday, the 17th, the day which I had from the first\r\nappointed for the opening of the treaty negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners were visited by Crowfoot, the principal Chief of\r\nthe Blackfeet, shortly after their arrival. He desired to know when\r\nhe and his people might meet us. We ascertained that most of the\r\nIndians on the ground were Blackfeet and Assiniboines or Stonies,\r\nfrom the upper part of Bow River. But as the 17th was the day\r\nnamed, the Commissioners determined to adhere to the appointment,\r\nand sent a messenger early in the morning to invite the Indians\r\ncamped around to meet them at the council tent at two o'clock, p.m.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour before the time appointed a gun was fired as a signal\r\nfor the Indians to assemble. The meeting was well attended. The\r\nChiefs came forward first and were introduced to the Commissioners,\r\nand their followers, on being invited, sat up close to the tent.\r\n\r\nI addressed them, stating that the Queen's Government had last year\r\npromised that they would this year be visited by Commissioners to\r\ninvite them to make a treaty. That months ago I had named this very\r\nday to meet them, and that in accordance with the promises made,\r\nthe Commissioners were now here to discuss the terms of a treaty.\r\nYet as we had learned that very few of the Bloods, Sarcees or\r\nPiegans had arrived, we would not unduly press forward the\r\nnegotiations, but wait until Wednesday to give the others time to\r\narrive.\r\n\r\nThe Indians listened attentively to what was said, and several of\r\nthe Chiefs expressed their satisfaction at not being asked to meet\r\nus on the morrow. The Commissioners then told them there were\r\nrations provided for them by the Government, and that those who\r\nwere in need of provisions might apply to certain of the Police\r\nofficers detailed to see to their proper distribution.\r\n\r\nThe Stonies and one Blood Chief applied for flour, tea, sugar and\r\ntobacco, but said they were not then in need of beef. Crowfoot and\r\nsome other Chiefs under his influence would not accept any rations\r\nuntil they would hear what terms the Commissioners were prepared to\r\noffer them. He appeared to be under the impression that if the\r\nIndians were fed by the bounty of the Government they would be\r\ncommitted to the proposals of the Commissioners, whatever might be\r\ntheir nature. Though I feared this refusal did not augur well for\r\nthe final success of the negotiations, yet I could not help wishing\r\nthat other Indians whom I have seen, had a little of the spirit in\r\nregard to dependence upon the Government exhibited on this occasion\r\nby the great Chief of the Blackfeet.\r\n\r\nAmong the visitors at the treaty I was pleased to meet the Rev.\r\nJohn McDougall, Wesleyan missionary at Morley Ville, and son of the\r\nlate lamented Rev. George McDougall, so well and favourably known\r\nin connection with Indian affairs in the North-West. Mr. McDougall\r\nwas present at the first interview the Commissioners held with\r\nthe Indians, and acted as interpreter for the Stonies, who do not\r\nunderstand the Blackfoot language. He, as well as the Rev. C.\r\nScollen, rendered the Commissioners all the assistance in their\r\npower. Traders, with large supplies of goods, were arriving on the\r\nground. They desired to erect buildings of logs to protect their\r\nproperty, but as some of the Indian Chiefs objected to the trees\r\nalong the river being cut down for such a purpose until after\r\nthe treaty, the Commissioners deemed it prudent, to prevent\r\ncomplications, to ask the traders to erect only temporary\r\nstanchions sufficient to support canvas coverings. They complied\r\nwith our wishes, and the Indians gave us no further trouble on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Monday I also received a message from Bobtail, a\r\nCree Chief, who, with the larger portion of the band, had come to\r\nthe treaty grounds. He represented that he had not been received\r\ninto any treaty. He, however, had not attended the meeting that\r\nday, because he was uncertain whether the Commissioners would be\r\nwilling to receive him along with the Blackfeet. I asked him and\r\nhis band to meet the Commissioners separate from the other Indians\r\non the following day.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, at two o'clock, the Cree Chief and his band assembled\r\naccording to appointment. The Commissioners ascertained from him\r\nthat he had frequented for some time the Upper Bow River country,\r\nand might fairly be taken into the present treaty, but he expressed\r\na wish to have his reserve near Pigeon Lake, within the limits of\r\nTreaty Number Six, and from what we could learn of the feelings of\r\nthe Blackfeet toward the Crees, we considered it advisable to keep\r\nthem separate as much as possible. We therefore informed the Chief\r\nthat it would be most expedient for him to give in his adhesion to\r\nthe treaty of last year, and be paid annually, on the north of Red\r\nDeer River, with the other Cree Chiefs. He consented. We then told\r\nhim that we could not pay him until after the Blackfeet had been\r\ndealt with, as it might create jealousy among them, but that in the\r\nmeantime his band could receive rations. He said it was right that\r\nhe should wait until we had settled with the Blackfeet, and agreed\r\nto come and sign his adhesion to Treaty Number Six at any time I\r\nwas prepared to receive him.\r\n\r\nDuring Tuesday, several parties of Indians came in, but the\r\nprincipal Blood Chiefs had not yet arrived. According to\r\nappointment, however, the Commissioners met the Indians at two\r\no'clock on Wednesday. An outline was given of the terms proposed\r\nfor their acceptance. We also informed them we did not expect an\r\nanswer that day, but we hoped to hear from them to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThat day we again intimated to the Indians that rations would be\r\ndelivered to such as applied for them. We told them the provisions\r\nwere a present, and their acceptance would not be regarded as\r\ncommitting the Chiefs to the terms proposed by the Commissioners.\r\nMost of the Chiefs at once applied for flour, tea, sugar and\r\ntobacco, and in a day or two they also asked for meat. Even\r\nCrowfoot, at last thankfully accepted his share of the rations, and\r\nthe beef cattle began to decrease rapidly.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday we met the Indians at the usual hour. We further\r\nexplained the terms outlined to them yesterday, dwelling especially\r\nupon the fact that by the Canadian Law their reserves could not be\r\ntaken from them, occupied or sold, without their consent. They were\r\nalso assured that their liberty of hunting over the open prairie\r\nwould not be interfered with, so long as they did not molest\r\nsettlers and others in the country.\r\n\r\nWe then invited the Chiefs to express their opinions. One of the\r\nminor Blood Chiefs made a long speech. He told us the Mounted\r\nPolice had been in the country for four years, and had been\r\ndestroying a quantity of wood. For this wood he asked the\r\nCommissioners should make the Indians a present payment of fifty\r\ndollars a head to each Chief, and thirty dollars a head to all\r\nothers. He said the Blackfeet, Bloods, Sarcees and Piegans were all\r\none; but he asked that the Crees and Half-breeds should be sent\r\nback to their own country. The Queen, he remarked, had sent the\r\npolice to protect them; they had made it safe for Indians to sleep\r\nat night, and he hoped she would not soon take these men away.\r\n\r\nCrowfoot said he would not speak until to-morrow. Old Sun, another\r\ninfluential Blackfoot Chief, said the same. Eagle Tail, the head\r\nChief of the Piegans, remarked that he had always followed the\r\nadvice the officers of the Mounted Police gave him. He hoped the\r\npromise which the Commissioners made would be secured to them as\r\nlong as the sun shone and water ran. The Stony Chiefs unreservedly\r\nexpressed their willingness to accept the terms offered.\r\n\r\nFearing that some of the Indians might regard the demands of the\r\nBlood Chief who had spoken, if not promptly refused, as agreed to,\r\nI told them he had asked too much. He had admitted the great\r\nbenefit the Police had been to the Indians, and yet he was so\r\nunreasonable as to ask that the Government should pay a large\r\ngratuity to each Indian for the little wood their benefactors had\r\nused. On the contrary, I said, if there should be any pay in the\r\nmatter it ought to come from the Indians to the Queen for sending\r\nthem the Police. Hereupon, Crowfoot and the other Chiefs laughed\r\nheartily at the Blood orator of the day.\r\n\r\nI also said the Commissioners could not agree to exclude the Crees\r\nand Half-breeds from the Blackfoot country; that they were the\r\nGreat Mother's children as much as the Blackfeet and Bloods, and\r\nshe did not wish to see any of them starve. Of course the Crees and\r\nHalf-breeds could be prosecuted for trespassing on their reserves.\r\nIn this the Indian Act secured them. The Local Government had\r\npassed a law to protect the buffalo. It would have a tendency to\r\nprevent numbers from visiting their country in the close season.\r\nBut to altogether exclude any class of the Queen's subjects, as\r\nlong as they obeyed the laws, from coming into any part of the\r\ncountry, was contrary to the freedom which she allowed her people,\r\nand the Commissioners would make no promise of the kind.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning there was a rumor that the Indians in\r\ntheir own Councils could not agree, that a small party was opposed\r\nto making a treaty. The opposition, however, could not have been\r\nvery formidable. The principal Chiefs seemed fully to understand\r\nthe importance of accepting some terms. About noon, Crowfoot, with\r\nMr. L'Heureux, as interpreter, came to my tent and asked for\r\nexplanations on some points, which I cheerfully gave him. During\r\nthe forenoon a large party of Bloods came in, among whom was Bad\r\nHead, an aged minor Blood Chief, of considerable influence, who\r\nattended the meeting in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nWhen the Commissioners intimated that they were ready to hear what\r\nthe Chiefs had to say, Crowfoot was the first to speak. His remarks\r\nwere few, but he expressed his gratitude for the Mounted Police\r\nbeing sent to them, and signified his intention to accept the\r\ntreaty. The Blood Chief who made the large demands on the previous\r\nday said he would agree with the other Chiefs. Old Sun, head Chief\r\nof the North Blackfeet, said Crowfoot spoke well. We are not going\r\nto disappoint the Commissioners. He was glad they were all agreed\r\nto the same terms. They wanted cattle, guns, ammunition, tobacco,\r\naxes and money. Bull's Head, the principal Chief of the Sarcees,\r\nsaid, we are all going to take your advice. Eagle Head, the Piegan\r\nhead Chief remarked, \"I give you my hand. We all agree to what\r\nCrowfoot says.\" Rainy Chief, head of the North Bloods, said he\r\nnever went against the white man's advice. Some of the minor Chiefs\r\nspoke to the same effect.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners expressed their satisfaction at the unanimity\r\namong the Indians, and said they would prepare the treaty and bring\r\nit to-morrow for signature. The only difficult matter then to be\r\narranged was the reserves. The Commissioners thought it would take\r\nunnecessary time to discuss this question in open meeting, and\r\nresolved that one of them should visit the head Chiefs at their\r\ncamps, and consult them separately as to the localities they might\r\ndesire to select. Lieut.-Col. McLeod undertook this duty, while I\r\nattended to the preparation of the draft treaty. He succeeded so\r\nwell in his mission that we were able to name the places chosen in\r\nthe treaty.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, 22nd September, we met the Indians to conclude the\r\ntreaty. Mekasto, or Red Crow the great Chief of the South Bloods,\r\nhad arrived the previous evening, or morning, on the ground, and\r\nbeing present, came forward to be introduced to the Commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe assemblage of Indians was large. All the head Chiefs of the\r\nseveral tribes were now present; only two Blackfeet and two Blood\r\nminor Chiefs were absent. The representation was all that could be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners had previously informed the Indians that they\r\nwould accept the Chiefs whom they acknowledged, and now close in\r\nfront of the tent sat those who had been presented to the\r\nCommissioners as the recognized Chiefs of the respective bands.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of the treaty having been interpreted to the\r\nIndians, some of the Blood Chiefs, who bad said very little on the\r\nprevious day, owing to Red Crow's absence, now spoke, he himself in\r\na few kind words agreeing to accept the treaty. Crowfoot then came\r\nforward and requested his name to be written to the treaty. The\r\nCommissioners having first signed it, Mr. L'Heureux, being familiar\r\nwith the Blackfoot language, attached the Chiefs' names to the\r\ndocument at their request and witnessed to their marks.\r\n\r\nWhile the signing was being proceeded with, a salute was fired from\r\nthe field guns in honor of the successful conclusion of the\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\nI may mention, in this connection, that on Saturday also I was\r\nwaited upon by a deputation of Half-breeds, who presented me with a\r\npetition, expressing the hope that the buffalo law might not be\r\nstringently enforced during the approaching winter, and praying\r\nthat they might receive some assistance to commence farming. With\r\nrespect to the buffalo ordinance, I told them that the notice\r\nhaving been short, the law would not be very strictly enforced for\r\nthe first winter, and in regard to their prayer for assistance to\r\nfarm, I said I would make it known at Ottawa.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 24th, the Commissioners met the Indians at ten a.m.\r\nSome minor Chiefs who had not remained until the close of the\r\nproceedings on Saturday signed the treaty this morning. The Chiefs\r\nwere then asked to stand up in a body, their names were read over\r\nand the Indians once more asked to say whether they were their\r\nrecognized Chiefs. Heavy Shield, a brother of Old Sun, at the request\r\nof the latter, took the place of head Chief of his band. It was,\r\nhowever, ascertained that this arrangement caused dissatisfaction,\r\nand Old Sun was restored to his position, and the band adhering to\r\nhis brother, was called the \"Middle Blackfoot Band.\"\r\n\r\nAfter their names were called over, I gave the head Chiefs of the\r\nBlackfeet, Blood, Piegans, and Sarcees their flags and uniforms,\r\nand invested them with their medals.\r\n\r\nWhile I was shaking hands with them, acknowledging their Chiefs in\r\nthe name of the Great Mother, the band played \"God Save the Queen.\"\r\nThe payments were then immediately begun by the officers of the\r\nMounted Police, one party taking the Blackfeet, and another the\r\nBloods, while a third was detailed to pay the Assiniboines, or\r\nStonies, near their encampment some two miles up the river.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners went in the afternoon with the latter party, and\r\nbefore the payments were commenced, presented the Chiefs with their\r\nmedals, flags and uniforms. The Stonies received us with quite\r\na demonstration. They are a well-behaved body of Indians. The\r\ninfluence of the Christian missionary in their midst is apparent,\r\npolygamy being now almost wholly a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday I took the adhesion of Bobtail, the Cree Chief, and his\r\nband, to Treaty Number Six, and they were paid out of the funds\r\nwhich I had brought with me from Swan River.\r\n\r\nOn the invitation of the Blackfeet, Blood, and kindred Chiefs, the\r\nCommissioners went on Wednesday to the Council tent to receive an\r\naddress of thanks. A large number of Indians were present. Mr.\r\nL'Heureux spoke on their behalf, and expressed their gratitude\r\nto the Commissioners generally for the kind manner in which they\r\nconducted the negotiations, to me personally for having come so far\r\nto meet them, and to Lieut.-Col. McLeod for all that he and the\r\nMounted Police had done for them since their arrival in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nTo this address the Commissioners feelingly replied, and expressed\r\ntheir confidence that the Indians before them would not regret\r\nhaving agreed to the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe Cree Chief and his band also waited upon us in the evening at\r\nmy tent, and through Father Scollen, as interpreter, thanked us for\r\nthe manner in which we had treated them. The presents sent for the\r\nIndians were distributed to each band, after payment. On Wednesday\r\nalso the Commissioners drove to see the coal seam about five miles\r\neast of the Blackfoot crossing. Under the guidance of Mr. French,\r\nthey found an outcrop of the seam at a coulee some three miles\r\nsouth of the river. The seam there is from three to ten feet in\r\nthickness, and the coal, some of which was burned every day in the\r\nofficers' mess tent at the treaty, is of a very fair quality.\r\n\r\nAbout noon on Friday the payments were completed, and the\r\nCommissioners proceeded to close the accounts. They found that the\r\nnumber of Indians paid, who had accepted the terms of the new\r\ntreaty was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Head Chiefs                         10 at $25    $250\r\n  Minor Chiefs and Councillors        40 at  15     600\r\n  Men, women and children          4,342 at  12  52,104\r\n                                   -----         ------\r\n               Total               4,392        $52,954\r\n\r\nThe Crees who gave in their adhesion to Treaty Number Six were only\r\npaid the gratuity, this year's annuity being still due them. These\r\nwere paid from the funds of Treaty Number Six as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Chief                             1 at $25     $25\r\n  Councillors                       2 at  15      30\r\n  Men, women and children         429 at  12   5,148\r\n                                  ---          -----\r\n               Total              432         $5,203\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Police Force who conducted the payments,\r\ndischarged this duty in a most efficient manner. Not in regard to\r\nthe payments alone were the services of the officers most valuable.\r\nWith respect to the whole arrangements, Lieut.-Col. McLeod, my\r\nassociate Commissioner, both in that capacity and as Commander of\r\nthe Police, was indefatigable in his exertions to bring the\r\nnegotiations to a successful termination. The same laudable efforts\r\nwere put forth by Major Irvine and the other officers of the Force,\r\nand their kindness to me, personally I shall never fail to\r\nremember. The volunteer band of the Police at Fort McLeod deserve\r\nmore than a passing notice, as they did much to enliven the whole\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners at first had not a good interpreter of the\r\nBlackfoot language, but on Wednesday they secured the services\r\nof Mr. Bird, a brother of the late Dr. Bird, of Winnipeg. He has\r\nbeen many years among the Piegans and Blackfeet and is a very\r\nintelligent interpreter. Mr. L'Heureux also rendered good service\r\nin this respect.\r\n\r\nThe accounts being closed and certified to by the Commissioners, I\r\ncommenced my return journey on the evening of the 28th September. I\r\ncame by a crossing of the Red Deer River some fifteen miles east of\r\nthe Hand Hills, travelled across the prairies further west than my\r\nformer route, and arrived at Battleford on the evening of Saturday\r\nthe 6th of October.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the treaty as signed by the Commissioners and\r\nChiefs, and also the adhesion of the Cree Chief to Treaty Number\r\nSix.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I beg to offer a few observations on the treaty, and\r\nsubjects connected therewith.\r\n\r\n1. With respect to the reserves, the Commissioners thought it\r\nexpedient to settle at once their location subject to the approval\r\nof the Privy Council. By this course it is hoped that a great deal\r\nof subsequent trouble in selecting reserves will be avoided. The\r\nobject of the ten years' reserve on the south side of Bow River is\r\nto keep hunters from building winter shanties on the river bottom.\r\nThis practice has a tendency to alarm the buffalo, and keep them\r\nfrom their feeding grounds on the lower part of the river. After\r\nten years it is feared the buffalo will have become nearly extinct,\r\nand that further protection will be needless. At any rate by that\r\ntime the Indians hope to have herds of domestic cattle. The country\r\non the upper part of the Bow River is better adapted for settlement\r\nthan most of that included in the Blackfeet reserve, consequently\r\nthe Commissioners deemed it advisable to agree that a belt on the\r\nsouth side of the river should be exempt from general occupation\r\nfor ten years, particularly as the Indians set great value on the\r\nconcession.\r\n\r\n2. The articles promised in addition to the money payments may to\r\nsome appear excessive. The Stonies are the only Indians adhering to\r\nthis treaty who desired agricultural implements and seed. The\r\npromises, therefore, respecting these things may be understood as\r\nmerely applicable to that tribe. The Blackfeet and Bloods asked for\r\nnothing of this kind; they preferred cattle, and the Commissioners\r\nbeing fully of opinion that such were likely to be much more\r\nserviceable to them than seed and implements, encouraged them in\r\ntheir request. The number of cattle promised may appear large; but\r\nwhen it is considered that cows can be readily purchased at Fort\r\nMcLeod for twenty or twenty-five dollars per head, and their\r\ndelivery to the Indians will cost an inconsiderable sum, the total\r\nexpense of supplying the articles promised by this treaty will, I\r\nam convinced, cost less than those under either Treaty number Four\r\nor Number Six.\r\n\r\n3. I would urge that the officers of the Mounted Police be\r\nentrusted to make the annual payments to the Indians under this\r\ntreaty. The Chiefs themselves requested this, and I said I believed\r\nthe Government would gladly consent to the arrangement. The Indians\r\nhave confidence in the Police, and it might be some time before\r\nthey would acquire the same respect for strangers.\r\n\r\n4. The organization of the Blackfeet bands is somewhat different\r\nfrom that of the Saulteaux and Crees. They have large bands with\r\nhead and minor Chiefs, and as they preferred that this arrangement\r\nshould remain unchanged, the Commissioners gladly acceded to their\r\ndesire, as expense would be saved to the Government in clothing,\r\nwere councillors and head men not named. The Stonies, however asked\r\nto be allowed councillors, and their request was granted to the\r\nextent of two to each Chief.\r\n\r\n5. Copies of the treaty printed on parchment should be forwarded to\r\nFort McLeod in good time to be delivered to each head and minor\r\nChief at next year's payment of annuities.\r\n\r\n                I have the honour to be, Sir,\r\n                             Your obedient servant,\r\n                                        DAVID LAIRD,\r\n                    Lieut.-Gov., and Special Indian Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReport from correspondence in The Globe newspaper, Toronto.\r\n\r\nFORT McLEOD, October 4, 1877.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with the Blackfeet nation has been concluded\r\nsatisfactorily, and was signed by the Chiefs of the Blackfeet,\r\nBlood, Piegan and Sarcee tribes, in the presence of the\r\nCommissioners--Governor Laird and Col. McLeod, C.M.G., and of Major\r\nIrvine, Assistant Commissioner, North-West Mounted Police, and\r\nofficers of the Police Force, at the Council House, near \"Ridge\r\nunder the Water,\" or \"The Blackfoot Crossing\" the Great Bow River,\r\non the 22nd September last.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 4th of September, Col. McLeod received\r\ninformation from the ubiquitous Indian that the Queen's father\r\n(Lieut.-Gov. Laird) was at Little Bow River, thirty miles north\r\nfrom McLeod, and was accompanied by the \"Buffalo Bull\" (Major\r\nIrvine), and that they would arrive before the sun sank below the\r\nwestern horizon. At three p.m. the Commissioner left Fort McLeod,\r\naccompanied by a guard of honor of one hundred mounted men, to meet\r\nand escort the representative of Vice-Royalty to the first white\r\nsettlement in the Blackfeet country. The Governor was met three\r\nmiles north of Willow Creek, and expressed his surprise and\r\npleasure at the splendid appearance of the well-mounted,\r\nwell-equipped, well-drilled body of men who formed the guard of\r\nhonour. When the head of the column forming the escort wound\r\nround the bend of Willow Creek, and the extensive wooded valley on\r\nwhich McLeod is built appeared in view, the guns, which had been\r\nunlimbered and placed in position on the highest of the bluffs\r\nwhich girdle the north side of Old Man's River, fired a salute of\r\nthirteen guns. On the arrival of the cortege at the upper or south\r\nend of the village, the police band took the lead and welcomed\r\nthe Governor with its lively music. The whole white, Half-breed\r\nand Indian population of McLeod turned out to obtain a view of\r\nthe great man who had arrived. At the request of the leading\r\ninhabitants of McLeod the carriage of the Governor was halted in\r\nthe centre of the village, and the following neatly worded address\r\nwas read and presented to His Honor by Mr. John C. Bell:\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE DAVID LAIRD,\r\n                Lieutenant-Governor, N.-W. T.\r\n\r\nWe, the citizens of Fort McLeod, beg to welcome you to this little\r\nvillage, one of the pioneer settlements of this great North-West.\r\n\r\nTo have so distinguished a visitor in our midst is an honor we all\r\nappreciate, as in that visit we feel an assurance of your interest\r\nin our welfare and prosperity, which had its dawn with the advent\r\nof the Mounted Police in the North-West, and which, through their\r\nvigilance and care, has continued to this time.\r\n\r\nWe trust that your visit here will be as pleasant to you as it will\r\nbe long remembered by us.\r\n\r\n    CHAS. E. CONRAD,\r\n    THOMAS J. BOGY,\r\n    DANIEL SAMPLE,\r\n    LIONEL E. MANNING,\r\n    JOHN C. BELL.\r\n\r\nTo which the Governor replied--\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I thank you for your kind address, and for the hearty\r\nwelcome you have extended to me on my first visit to this pioneer\r\nsettlement of the Canadian North-West. After roughing it for the\r\nlast twenty-four days on the broad unsettled prairies, you have\r\nsurprised me by a reception which betokens all the elements of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nIt affords me unfeigned pleasure to learn that the advent of the\r\nMounted Police in this country has been fraught with such\r\nadvantages to you as a community.\r\n\r\nPermit me to express the conviction that in return for that\r\ndiligence and care on the part of the Police Force which you so\r\nhighly and justly value, you will always be found conducting\r\nyourselves as becomes worthy subjects of that illustrious Sovereign\r\nwhom I have the distinguished honour to represent in these\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would remark that you have taken me so\r\nunexpectedly by your address that I feel unequal to making an\r\nappropriate reply; but the agreeableness of the surprise will tend\r\nto heighten the pleasure of my visit, as well as to render abiding\r\nthe interest which I undoubtedly feel in your welfare and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay at Fort McLeod, which extended to the 14th of\r\nthe month, the Lieutenant-Governor reviewed the garrison, which\r\nconsisted of troops C and D, and two divisions of artillery. They\r\ndeployed past at a walk, trot and gallop, and His Honor expressed\r\nhis unqualified admiration of the splendid form of the men. He was\r\nespecially pleased with the artillery, whose horses and equipments\r\nwere in beautiful condition, and requested Col. McLeod to convey to\r\nthe officers and men his surprise and pleasure at finding the force\r\nat this post so perfectly drilled and acquainted with their duties.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th the two troops and the artillery, accompanied by a\r\nbaggage train of six light waggons, left Fort McLeod en route for\r\nthe scene of the treaty. The Commissioner took command of the\r\ndetachment, and the Assistant Commissioner remained behind to\r\naccompany the Governor on the 14th.\r\n\r\nThe force accomplished the march in three days, and pitched the\r\ntents on ground previously laid out for the encampment by Inspector\r\nCrozier, at the head of a magnificently wooded valley, of about a\r\nmile in width and extending for several miles along the Big Bow. It\r\nis a lovely spot, this \"Ridge under the Water,\" and has always been\r\na favorite camping ground of the Blackfeet nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday, 17th October.\r\n\r\nThis was the day appointed for the opening of the Treaty, but as a\r\nnumber of the Indian Chiefs, who had a long distance to come, were\r\nabsent, it was deferred until the following Wednesday. The\r\nGovernor, however, addressed a number of the Chiefs who were\r\nassembled at the Council House. He said, \"Last year a message was\r\nsent to you by the Councillors of the Great Mother that they would\r\nmeet you at an early date, and as her Councillors always keep their\r\npromises, they have appointed Col. McLeod and myself to meet you\r\nhere now. We appointed this day, and I have come a very long\r\ndistance to keep my promise, and have called you together to\r\ndiscover if you all have responded to my summons, and if any Chiefs\r\nare now absent, to learn when they shall arrive. You say that some\r\nof the Blood Chiefs are absent, and as it is our wish to speak to\r\nthem as well as to you, and as they have a very long way to come to\r\nreach this place, we shall give them until next Wednesday to come\r\nin. On that day, I will deliver to you the Queen's message, but if\r\nany of the Chiefs would desire to speak now, we will be glad to\r\nlisten to them. I would tell you now, that while you remain,\r\nprovisions will be issued for the use of those who wish to accept\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nCROWFOOT--\"I am glad to see the Queen's Chief and Stamixotokon (Col\r\nMcLeod), who is a great Chief and our friend. I will wait and hold\r\na council with my own children (the Blackfeet), and be ready on\r\nWednesday to hear the Great Mother's message.\"\r\n\r\nPIEGAN CHIEF--\"My children (the North Piegans) have looked long for\r\nthe arrival of the Great Mother's Chief; one day, we did not look\r\nfor him, and he passed us; we have travelled after him for fourteen\r\nnights, and now are glad to see and shake hands with the Great\r\nChief.\"\r\n\r\nBEAR'S PAW (Stony Chief)--\"We have been watching for you for many\r\nmoons now, and a long time has gone by since I and my children\r\nfirst heard of your coming. Our hearts are now glad to see the\r\nChief of the Great Mother, and to receive flour and meat and\r\nanything you may give us. We are all of one mind, and will say what\r\nwe think on Wednesday.\"\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the Commissioners met the Chiefs at the great Council\r\nHouse. A guard of honor of fifty mounted men accompanied them,\r\ncommanded by Major Irvine. The Police band received them, and at\r\none o'clock the guns fired a salute as the Governor and Col. McLeod\r\ntook their seats. There were present at the opening of the treaty,\r\na number of ladies and gentlemen who had come long distances to\r\nwitness this novel spectacle. Mrs. McLeod, Mrs. Winder, Mrs.\r\nShurtleff, and a number of other ladies from Morleyville and\r\nEdmonton, also the Rev. Messrs. Scollen and McDougall, Mr. De\r\nL'Hereux, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Bogy, and the whole white population of\r\nFort McLeod. Nearly all of the Chiefs and minor Chiefs of the\r\nBlackfeet, Blood, Piegan, Stony, and Sarcee tribes were seated\r\ndirectly in front of the Council House; and forming a semicircle of\r\nabout one-third of a mile beyond the Chiefs, about four thousand\r\nmen, women, and children were squatted on the grass, watching with\r\nkeen interest the commencement of the proceedings. Lieut.-Gov.\r\nLaird delivered the following speech:\r\n\r\n\"The Great Spirit has made all things--the sun, the moon, and the\r\nstars, the earth, the forests, and the swift running rivers. It is\r\nby the Great Spirit that the Queen rules over this great country\r\nand other great countries. The Great Spirit has made the white man\r\nand the red man brothers, and we should take each other by the\r\nhand. The Great Mother loves all her children, white man and red\r\nman alike; she wishes to do them all good. The bad white man and\r\nthe bad Indian she alone does not love, and them she punishes for\r\ntheir wickedness. The good Indian has nothing to fear from the\r\nQueen or her officers. You Indians know this to be true. When bad\r\nwhite men brought you whiskey, robbed you, and made you poor, and,\r\nthrough whiskey, quarrel amongst yourselves, she sent the Police to\r\nput an end to it. You know how they stopped this and punished the\r\noffenders, and how much good this has done. I have to tell you how\r\nmuch pleased the Queen is that you have taken the Police by the\r\nhands and helped them, and obeyed her laws since the arrival of the\r\nPolice. She hopes that you will continue to do so, and you will\r\nalways find the Police on your side if you keep the Queen's laws.\r\nThe Great Mother heard that the buffalo were being killed very\r\nfast, and to prevent them from being destroyed her Councillors have\r\nmade a law to protect them. This law is for your good. It says that\r\nthe calves are not to be killed, so that they may grow up and\r\nincrease; that the cows are not to be killed in winter or spring,\r\nexcepting by the Indians when they are in need of them as food.\r\nThis will save the buffalo, and provide you with food for many\r\nyears yet, and it shews you that the Queen and her Councillors wish\r\nyou well.\r\n\r\n\"Many years ago our Great Mother made a treaty with the Indians far\r\naway by the great waters in the east. A few years ago she made a\r\ntreaty with those beyond the Touchwood Hills and the Woody\r\nMountains. Last year a treaty was made with the Crees along the\r\nSaskatchewan, and now the Queen has sent Col. McLeod and myself to\r\nask you to make a treaty. But in a very few years the buffalo will\r\nprobably be all destroyed, and for this reason the Queen wishes to\r\nhelp you to live in the future in some other way. She wishes you to\r\nallow her white children to come and live on your land and raise\r\ncattle, and should you agree to this she will assist you to raise\r\ncattle and grain, and thus give you the means of living when the\r\nbuffalo are no more. She will also pay you and your children money\r\nevery year, which you can spend as you please. By being paid in\r\nmoney you cannot be cheated, as with it you can buy what you may\r\nthink proper.\r\n\r\n\"The Queen wishes us to offer you the same as was accepted by the\r\nCrees. I do not mean exactly the same terms, but equivalent terms,\r\nthat will cost the Queen the same amount of money. Some of the\r\nother Indians wanted farming implements, but these you do not\r\nrequire, as your lands are more adapted to raising cattle, and\r\ncattle, perhaps, would be better for you. The Commissioners will\r\ngive you your choice, whether cattle or farming implements. I have\r\nalready said we will give you money, I will now tell you how much.\r\nIf you sign the treaty every man, woman and child will get twelve\r\ndollars each; the money will be paid to the head of each family for\r\nhimself, women and children; every year, for ever, you, your women\r\nand your children will get five dollars each. This year Chiefs and\r\nCouncillors will be paid a larger sum than this; Chiefs will get a\r\nsuit of clothes, a silver medal, and flag, and every third year\r\nwill get another suit. A reserve of land will be set apart for\r\nyourselves and your cattle, upon which none others will be\r\npermitted to encroach; for every five persons one square mile will\r\nbe allotted on this reserve, on which they can cut the trees and\r\nbrush for firewood and other purposes. The Queen's officers will\r\npermit no white man or Half-breed to build or cut the timber on\r\nyour reserves. If required roads will be cut through them. Cattle\r\nwill be given to you, and potatoes, the same as are grown at Fort\r\nMcLeod. The Commissioners would strongly advise the Indians to take\r\ncattle, as you understand cattle better than you will farming for\r\nsome time, at least as long as you continue to move about in\r\nlodges.\r\n\r\n\"Ammunition will be issued to you each year, and as soon as you\r\nsign the treaty one thousand five hundred dollars' worth will be\r\ndistributed amongst the tribes, and as soon as you settle, teachers\r\nwill be sent to you to instruct your children to read books like\r\nthis one (the Governor referred to a Bible), which is impossible so\r\nlong as you continue to move from place to place. I have now\r\nspoken. I have made you acquainted with the principal terms\r\ncontained in the treaty which you are asked to sign.\r\n\r\n\"You may wish time to talk it over in your council lodges; you may\r\nnot know what to do before you speak your thoughts in council. Go,\r\ntherefore, to your councils, and I hope that you may be able to\r\ngive me an answer to-morrow. Before you leave I will hear your\r\nquestions and explain any matter that may not appear clear to you.\"\r\n\r\nA few questions by the Chiefs were answered, and the council was\r\nclosed for the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThursday, October 19th.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, on arriving at the Council House, where all the\r\nChiefs were awaiting him, said that he was glad to see them all\r\nthere, and that he had only a few words to say to them. He said, \"I\r\nexpect to listen to what you have to say to-day, but, first, I\r\nwould explain that it is your privilege to hunt all over the\r\nprairies, and that should you desire to sell any portion of your\r\nland, or any coal or timber from off your reserves, the Government\r\nwill see that you receive just and fair prices, and that you can\r\nrely on all the Queen's promises being fulfilled. Your payments\r\nwill be punctually made. You all know the Police; you know that no\r\npromise of theirs to you has ever been broken; they speak and act\r\nstraight. You have perfect confidence in them, and by the past\r\nconduct of the Police towards you, you can judge of the future. I\r\nthink I have now said all, and will listen to you and explain\r\nanything you wish to know; we wish to keep nothing back.\"\r\n\r\nBUTTON CHIEF--\"The Great Spirit sent the white man across the great\r\nwaters to carry out His (the Great Spirit's) ends. The Great\r\nSpirit, and not the Great Mother, gave us this land, The Great\r\nMother sent Stamixotokon (Col. McLeod) and the Police to put an end\r\nto the traffic in fire-water. I can sleep now safely. Before the\r\narrival of the Police, when I laid my head down at night, every\r\nsound frightened me; my sleep was broken; now I can sleep sound and\r\nam not afraid. The Great Mother sent you to this country, and we\r\nhope she will be good to us for many years. I hope and expect to\r\nget plenty; we think we will not get so much as the Indians receive\r\nfrom the Americans on the other side; they get large presents of\r\nflour, sugar, tea, and blankets. The Americans gave at first large\r\nbags of flour, sugar, and many blankets; the next year it was only\r\nhalf the quantity, and the following years it grew less and less,\r\nand now they give only a handful of flour. We want to get fifty\r\ndollars for the Chiefs and thirty dollars each for all the others,\r\nmen, women, and children, and we want the same every year for the\r\nfuture. We want to be paid for all the timber that the Police and\r\nwhites have used since they first came to our country. If it\r\ncontinues to be used as it is, there will soon be no firewood left\r\nfor the Indians. I hope, Great Father, that you will give us all\r\nthis that we ask.\"\r\n\r\nCROWFOOT--\"Great Father, what do you think now, what do you say to\r\nthat? What I have to say will be spoken to-morrow. My brother\r\nChiefs will speak now.\"\r\n\r\nEAGLE TAIL--\"Great Father, from our Great Mother, Stamixotokon and\r\nofficers of the Police, the advice and help I received from the\r\nPolice I shall never forget as long as the moon brightens the\r\nnight, as long as water runs and the grass grows in spring, and I\r\nexpect to get the same from our Great Mother. I hope she will\r\nsupply us with flour, tea, tobacco and cattle, seed and farming\r\nimplements. I have done at present.\"\r\n\r\nOLD SUN--\"Father and sons, I shall speak to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR--\"I fear Button Chief is asking too much. He has told us\r\nof the great good the Police have done for him and his tribe and\r\nthroughout the country by driving away the whiskey traders, and now\r\nhe wants us to pay the Chiefs fifty dollars and others thirty\r\ndollars per head, and to pay him for the timber that has been used.\r\nWhy, you Indians ought to pay us rather, for sending these traders\r\nin fire-water away and giving you security and peace, rather than\r\nwe pay you for the timber used. (Here the Indians indulged in a\r\ngeneral hearty laugh at this proposition.) We cannot do you good\r\nand pay you too for our protection. Button Chief wants us to\r\nprevent the Crees and Half-breeds from coming in and killing the\r\nbuffalo. They too are the Queen's children, as well as the\r\nBlackfeet and Crees. We have done all we can do in preventing the\r\nslaying of the young buffalo, and this law will preserve the\r\nbuffalo for many years. Button Chief wishes to get the same every\r\nyear as this year; this we cannot promise. We cannot make a treaty\r\nwith you every year. We will give you something to eat each year,\r\nbut not so much as you will receive now. He says the Americans at\r\nfirst gave the Indians many large sacks of flour, and now they only\r\nreceive a handful. From us you receive money to purchase what you\r\nmay see fit; and as your children increase yearly, you will get the\r\nmore money in the future, as you are paid so much per head.\r\n\r\n\"(To the Stony Chiefs)--When your reserves will be allotted to you\r\nno wood can be cut or be permitted to be taken away from them\r\nwithout your own consent. The reserve will be given to you without\r\ndepriving you of the privilege to hunt over the plains until the\r\nland be taken up.\"\r\n\r\nBear's Paw said that he was pleased with the treaty, the Police,\r\nand the prospect of getting provisions and money, and hoped that\r\nthe Commissioners would give his tribe (the Stonies) as much as\r\npossible, and that as speedily as possible. This Chief appeared by\r\nhis speech to be of a mercenary bent of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nFriday, October 20th.\r\n\r\nOn this day the Indians accepted the terms of the treaty, and\r\nseveral of the Chiefs made speeches. The first speaker was\r\nCrowfoot.\r\n\r\nCROWFOOT--\"While I speak, be kind and patient. I have to speak for\r\nmy people, who are numerous, and who rely upon me to follow that\r\ncourse which in the future will tend to their good. The plains are\r\nlarge and wide. We are the children of the plains, it is our home,\r\nand the buffalo has been our food always. I hope you look upon the\r\nBlackfeet, Blood, and Sarcees as your children now, and that you\r\nwill be indulgent and charitable to them. They all expect me to\r\nspeak now for them, and I trust the Great Spirit will put into\r\ntheir breasts to be a good people--into the minds of the men, women\r\nand children, and their future generations. The advice given me and\r\nmy people has proved to be very good. If the Police had not come to\r\nthe, country, where would we be all now? Bad men and whiskey were\r\nkilling us so fast that very few, indeed, of us would have been\r\nleft to-day. The Police have protected us as the feathers of the\r\nbird protect it from the frosts of winter. I wish them all good,\r\nand trust that all our hearts will increase in goodness from this\r\ntime forward. I am satisfied. I will sign the treaty.\"\r\n\r\nBUTTON CHIEF--\"I must say what all the people say, and I agree with\r\nwhat they say. I cannot make new laws. I will sign.\"\r\n\r\nRED CROW--\"Three years ago, when the Police first came to the\r\ncountry, I met and shook hands with Stamixotokon (Col. McLeod) at\r\nPelly River. Since that time he made me many promises. He kept them\r\nall--not one of them was ever broken. Everything that the police\r\nhave done has been good. I entirely trust Stamixotokon, and will\r\nleave everything to him. I will sign with Crowfoot.\"\r\n\r\nFATHER OF MANY CHILDREN--\"I have come a long way, and far behind\r\nthe rest of the bands. I have travelled with these traveaux that\r\nyou now see outside there with my women and children. I cannot\r\nspeak much now, but I agree with Crowfoot, and will sign.\"\r\n\r\nOLD SUN--\"Crowfoot speaks well. We were summoned to meet the Great\r\nMother's Chiefs here, and we would not disappoint them; we have\r\ncome, and will sign the treaty. During the past Crowfoot has been\r\ncalled by us our Great Father. The Great Mother's Chief (Governor\r\nLaird) will now be our Great Father. Everything you say appears to\r\nme to be very good, and I hope that you will give us all we\r\nask--cattle, money, tobacco, guns, and axes, and that you will not\r\nlet the white man use poison on the prairies. It kills horses and\r\nbuffalo as well as wolves, and it may kill men. We can ourselves\r\nkill the wolves, and set traps for them. We all agree with\r\nCrowfoot.\"\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the day was consumed by about a dozen other chiefs\r\nspeaking in favour of the treaty. On the following day all the\r\nchiefs and counsellors signed their names under the signatures of\r\nthe Commissioners, and a salute of thirteen guns announced the\r\nfinal conclusion of the last treaty with the Indians of the\r\nNorth-West.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoon the Indians fought a sham battle on horseback.\r\nThey only wore the breech-cloths. They fired off their rifles in\r\nall directions, and sent the bullets whistling past the spectators\r\nin such close proximity as to create most unpleasant feelings. I\r\nwas heartily glad when they defiled past singly on the way back to\r\ntheir lodges, and the last of their unearthly yells had died away\r\nin the distance.\r\n\r\nMonday, Tuesday and Wednesday were occupied in paying off the\r\ndifferent tribes. They were paid by Inspector Winder, Sub-Inspector\r\nDenny, and Sub-Inspector Antrobus, each assisted by a constable of\r\nthe Force. It was hard work to find out the correct number of each\r\nfamily. Many after receiving their money would return to say that\r\nthey had made a wrong count; one would discover that he had another\r\nwife, another two more children, and others that they had blind\r\nmothers and lame sisters. In some cases they wanted to be paid for\r\nthe babies that were expected to come soon.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the Chiefs presented an address to the Commissioners,\r\nexpressing the entire satisfaction of the whole nation with the\r\ntreaty, and to the way in which the terms had been carried out.\r\nThey tendered their well wishes to the Queen, the Governor, Col.\r\nMcLeod, and the Police Force. They spoke in the most flattering and\r\nenthusiastic manner of the Commissioner, Assistant-Commissioner,\r\nofficers, and the Force in general, and said that it was their firm\r\ndetermination to adhere to the terms of the treaty, and abide by\r\nthe laws of the Great Mother. Potts, the interpreter at Fort\r\nMcLeod, said he never heard Indians speak out their minds so freely\r\nin his life before.\r\n\r\nIn reply, the Lieutenant-Governor said he was much pleased to\r\nreceive this address from the Chiefs of the great Blackfeet nation,\r\nwhich in fact was to the Great Mother, as the Commissioners were\r\nmerely acting for her, and carrying out her wishes. He was certain\r\nshe would be gratified to learn of the approval of the Chiefs and\r\ntheir acceptance of her offers. In return the Great Mother only\r\nrequired of them to abide by her laws.\r\n\r\nLieut.-Col. McLeod said in reply:--\"The Chiefs all here know what I\r\nsaid to them three years ago, when the Police first came to the\r\ncountry--that nothing would be taken away from them without their\r\nown consent. You all see to-day that what I told you then was true.\r\nI also told you that the Mounted Police were your friends, and\r\nwould not wrong you or see you wronged in any way. This also you\r\nsee is true. The Police will continue to be your friends, and be\r\nalways glad to see you. On your part you must keep the Queen's\r\nlaws, and give every information to them in order that they may see\r\nthe laws obeyed and offenders punished. You may still look to me as\r\nyour friend, and at any time when I can do anything for your\r\nwelfare, I shall only be too happy to do so. You say that I have\r\nalways kept my promises. As surely as my past promises have been\r\nkept, so surely shall those made by the Commissioners be carried\r\nout in the future. If they were broken I would be ashamed to meet\r\nyou or look you in the face; but every promise will be solemnly\r\nfulfilled as certainly as the sun now shines down upon us from the\r\nheavens. I shall always remember the kind manner in which you have\r\nto-day spoken of me.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this there was a great shaking of hands, and the Great\r\nCouncil ended.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday afternoon the Lieutenant-Governor departed for\r\nBattleford. On leaving the grounds the usual honors were paid to\r\nhim. The Commissioner left the following day for Fort Walsh to\r\nattend the Commission that was to meet the Sitting Bull.\r\n\r\nThe traders were notified that they were to cease trading and move\r\noff the reservation not later than the following Tuesday, at ten\r\np.m. By this hour they had all departed, and at noon on the same\r\nday the Force commenced its return journey to McLeod, which was\r\naccomplished in two days and a half. All were glad to get back to\r\nheadquarters, as the weather had been for some days intensely cold\r\nand the prairies covered with snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE SIOUX IN THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch interest has been awakened with regard to this warlike race,\r\nowing to recent events; namely, the war between them and the United\r\nStates, the destruction by them of Captain Custer's command, and\r\ntheir subsequent flight into British territory, and now prolonged\r\nsojourn therein.\r\n\r\nPrior, however, to this irruption, a portion of the Sioux tribe of\r\nAmerican Indians, took refuge in the Red River settlement, after\r\nthe massacre of the whites by the Indians in Minnesota, in the year\r\n1862. Their arrival caused great consternation in the settlement.\r\nThe main body took up a position at Sturgeon Creek, about six miles\r\nfrom Fort Garry, now the City of Winnipeg, and others, at Poplar\r\nPoint, and the Turtle Mountain. The Governor and Council of\r\nAssiniboia then governed the Province of Assiniboia, under the\r\nHudson's Bay Company, and was composed of representative men.\r\nTheir deliberations were grave and anxious. In December, 1863,\r\nthe Governor-in-Chief, Mr. Dallas, reported to the Council, that\r\nhe had visited the principal camp of the Sioux at Sturgeon Creek,\r\nand found there about five hundred men, women and children,\r\nand more had since arrived; that he had found them in great\r\ndestitution and suffering, from want of food and clothing, and\r\nthat after consultation with Governor Mactavish, of the Province\r\nof Assiniboia, he had offered sufficient provisions to enable them\r\nto remove to such a distance from the settlement as would place\r\nit beyond all danger and apprehension, and also offered to have\r\nthe provisions conveyed for them, and ammunition supplied them to\r\nprocure game, but they had positively refused to go away--giving\r\nas a reason the inability of the old men, women and children, to\r\ntravel in the winter. The Governor was in consequence authorized\r\nby the Council, to offer them the means of transport, for those\r\nwho were unable to walk. The Indians then removed to White Horse\r\nPlains, a distance of twenty miles only from Fort Garry, and camped\r\nthere. A supply of food was given them, but no ammunition. The\r\nUnited States military authorities in December, 1863, sent an envoy\r\nto see the Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, and the North-West\r\nTerritories, with a view to ordering the Sioux to return to United\r\nStates territory. The Governor was assured, that, though the\r\nAmerican authorities would punish such of the Sioux as had actually\r\nbeen engaged in the massacre, they would furnish the innocent with\r\nall needful supplies of food and clothing for the winter, in the\r\nevent of giving themselves up peaceably. The Council, on hearing\r\nthis statement, authorized the granting permission to the American\r\nauthorities to enter into negotiations with the Sioux in the\r\nterritories, on condition that they adopted no aggressive measures\r\nagainst them, and that in the event of the Americans accepting the\r\nproposed permission, they should protect themselves by a sufficient\r\nguard to preclude the danger of attack from the Indians, and to\r\nensure the preservation of peace.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1864, the Council considered a despatch from Major\r\nHatch, in command of the American forces, representing that on the\r\napproach of spring, he apprehended a renewal of the barbarous\r\nscenes of 1862 and 1863, and asked authority to cross the national\r\nboundaries and pursue and capture the murderers, wherever they\r\nmight be found. The Council accorded the permission asked, but it\r\nwas never acted on. It is not likely that a permission to cross our\r\nborders in pursuit of a flying enemy would ever again be granted.\r\nIt was conceded in exceptional circumstances by an irresponsible\r\nGovernment, but the growth of the Dominion of Canada has been such,\r\nand its relations to the empire have become so intimate, that it\r\nwould not in my judgment be granted, if at all, except in concert\r\nwith the Imperal Government. The Governor also reported to the\r\nCouncil, that the main body of the Sioux on the Missouri in the\r\nUnited States had sent him a message asking his advice as to making\r\npeace with the Americans, and expressing a desire to visit Red\r\nRiver in spring, and that he had advised the Sioux to make peace\r\nwith the Americans, as otherwise, the war would be renewed with\r\nincreased vigor next summer. He had also counselled them not to\r\nvisit the Red River country. The Council warned the Sioux not to\r\nvisit the settlement, but in the summer of 1866, the advice was\r\ndisregarded. A band of Sioux came to Fort Garry and were leaving\r\nquietly, with a number of Saulteaux, but when about a mile from the\r\nFort they were attacked by a band of Red Lake Saulteaux Indians,\r\nwho had just come into the settlement from the United States and\r\nfive of them were shot. The remainder fled for their lives.\r\n\r\nThe Council apprehended that the Sioux might congregate in force,\r\nand a collision take place between the Sioux and the Saulteaux, and\r\ntherefore authorized the formation of a body of from fifty to one\r\nhundred mounted armed men from among the settlers, to prevent the\r\nSioux from coming into the settlement. Fortunately they did not\r\nreturn and a collision was avoided.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, the American authorities again opened up communications\r\nwith the Governor and Council of Assiniboia, through Colonel Adams,\r\nwho intimated that he had been authorized by Brevet Major-General\r\nCorse, commanding the District of Minnesota, \"to use every possible\r\nmeans to induce the hostile Sioux to surrender themselves at Fort\r\nAbercrombie, and to grant them protection and entire absolution for\r\nall past offences in the event of giving themselves up,\" and asking\r\nthe aid of the Council, to endeavor to influence the Sioux to\r\naccede to the proposals he made. The Council accordingly authorized\r\nJudge Black and Mr. McClure to communicate to the Chiefs of the\r\nSioux, the letter of Colonel Adams, and endeavor to induce them to\r\naccept of it, and to supply them with what provisions might be\r\nnecessary to carry the Sioux to Fort Abercrombie.\r\n\r\nAll efforts having that end in view failed, and the Sioux remained,\r\nsome in the Province of Assiniboia, and others in the territories\r\nbeyond. As time went on, in 1870, the country passed under the rule\r\nof Canada, and when the Government of Canada was established in the\r\nProvince of Manitoba, which included the district of Assiniboia,\r\nthe Sioux were found living quietly in tents, in the parishes of\r\nPoplar Point, High Bluff, and Portage la Prairie, in what became\r\nthe new Province of Manitoba. Immigrants from Ontario, had begun to\r\nsettle in that section of the Province, and the settlement rapidly\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux were found very useful, and were employed as labourers,\r\ncutting grain, making fence-rails, and ploughing for the settlers.\r\nThey also endeavored to gain a subsistence, by killing game and\r\nfur-bearing animals, and by fishing. They frequently applied to\r\nLieut.-Gov. Archibald, to be allowed to settle on a reserve, where\r\nthey might support themselves by farming, a step which that officer\r\nfavored. In 1873, they renewed the application to his successor,\r\nLieut.-Gov. Morris, who having obtained authority to do so,\r\npromised to give them a reserve; upwards of one hundred of these\r\nSioux, resident within Manitoba, having waited upon him, and\r\nrepresented \"that they had no homes or means of living,\" and asked\r\nfor land and agricultural implements.\r\n\r\nThey were informed, that the case was exceptional, and that what\r\nwould be done, would be as a matter of grace and not of right,\r\nwhich they admitted. They were also told that the reserve would be\r\nfor themselves alone, and that the Sioux now in the States must\r\nremain there. A reserve was proposed to them on Lake Manitoba, but\r\nthey were unwilling to go there, being afraid of the Saulteaux, and\r\nespecially the Red Lake Saulteaux.\r\n\r\nIt is satisfactory to state, that after the treaty at the\r\nNorth-West Angle, the Saulteaux having become bound to live at\r\npeace with all people under Canadian authority, sent the aged Chief\r\nKou-croche to see the Lieutenant-Governor at Fort Garry, to\r\nacquaint him of their desire to make peace with the Sioux. The\r\nChief said the words he had heard at the Angle were good, he had\r\npromised to live at peace with all men, and he now wished to make\r\nfriends with the Sioux. The distrust between the two tribes had\r\nbeen great, owing to past events. At the Angle, but for the\r\npresence of the troops, the Chippewas would have fled, it having\r\nbeen circulated among them, that the Sioux were coming to attack\r\nthem. Permission was given to the Chief to pay his visit to the\r\nSioux, and messengers were sent to them, in advance, to explain the\r\nobject of his visit.\r\n\r\nThe result of the interview was satisfactory, and the ancient feud\r\nwas buried. In 1874, two reserves were allotted the Sioux, one on\r\nthe Assiniboine River, at Oak River, and another still further\r\nwest, at Bird Tail Creek. These reserves were surveyed, the former\r\ncontaining eight thousand and the latter seven thousand acres.\r\n\r\nSettlements, were commenced, on both reserves, and cattle, seed and\r\nagricultural implements were supplied to them. In 1875, the\r\nLieutenant-Governor finding that a large number still continued\r\ntheir nomadic life, in the vicinity of Poplar Point and Portage la\r\nPrairie, visited them, and obtained their promise to remove to the\r\nreserves--which the majority eventually did. Kenneth Mackenzie,\r\nEsq., M.P.P., a very successful farmer from Ontario, who had\r\nlargely employed Sioux laborers, kindly agreed to visit the\r\nAssiniboine reserve and direct them from time to time as to the\r\nagricultural operations. The Church of England undertook the\r\nestablishment of a mission and erected buildings there, while the\r\nPresbyterians opened a mission at Bird Tail Creek, and obtained the\r\nservices of a native ordained Sioux minister, from the Presbytery\r\nof Dakotah. The number of these Sioux is estimated at about fifteen\r\nhundred. Both settlements give promise of becoming self-sustaining,\r\nand in view of the rapid settlement of the country, some disposition\r\nof them had become necessary.\r\n\r\nDuring their sojourn of thirteen years on British territory, these\r\nIndians have on the whole, been orderly, and there was only one\r\ngrave crime committed among them, under peculiar circumstances--the\r\nputting to death of one of their number, which was done under their\r\ntribal laws. An indictment was laid before the Grand Jury of\r\nManitoba, and a true bill found against those concerned in this\r\naffair, but the chief actors in the tragedy fled. Had they been\r\ntried, their defence would probably have been that the act was\r\ncommitted in self-defence. The slain man having, as the Chief\r\nrepresented, killed one of the tribe, cruelly assaulted another,\r\nand threatened the lives of others. When the war broke out between\r\nthe Sioux and the American Government, the American Sioux,\r\nendeavored to induce those in Canadian territory to join them,\r\nbut they refused. Precautionary measures were however taken, and\r\nmessengers sent to them, by the Lieutenant-Governor, to warn\r\nthem against taking any part. They disclaimed all intention to\r\ndo so, and said they meant to live peacefully, being grateful\r\nfor the kindness with which they had been treated. Besides these\r\nManitoban Sioux, there were two other bands in the North-West\r\nTerritories--one at Turtle Mountains, and another large party\r\nin the bounds of the Qu'Appelle Treaty. In 1876 the latter sent\r\ntheir Chiefs to see Lieut.-Gov. Morris and the Hon. Mr. Laird, at\r\nQu'Appelle, and asked to be assigned a home. They were told that\r\ntheir case would be represented to the Canadian authorities. In\r\n1877, the Sioux at the Turtle Mountains, sent two deputations to\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor, to ask for a reserve in that region. They\r\nsaid they had lived for fifteen years in British territory, they\r\nwanted land to be given them and implements to cultivate the soil,\r\nand seed to sow, and scythes and sickles to reap their grain, and\r\nsome cattle.\r\n\r\nThey were told that they had no claim on the Queen, as they were\r\nnot British Indians, unless she chose to help them out of her\r\nbenevolence. This they cheerfully admitted, but hoped that they\r\nwould be helped. They were further informed, that if a reserve was\r\ngranted them, it could not be near the boundary line as they\r\nwished, and that they must avoid all interference with the American\r\ntrouble with their nation. This they willingly promised and said\r\n\"they had already taken care to have nothing to do with the\r\nmatter.\" These Sioux were very intelligent and superior Indians,\r\nand were well dressed. A reserve was subsequently allotted to them\r\nin the year 1876, in the vicinity of Oak Lake, about fifty miles\r\ndue north of Turtle Mountains, allowing them the same quantity of\r\nland, which had been given the Manitoba Sioux, viz., 80 acres to\r\neach band of five persons, and they will doubtless follow the\r\nexample of their brethren on the other two reserves. With regard to\r\nthe Sioux to whom reserves have been assigned, the then Minister of\r\nthe Interior, the Hon. David Mills, thus reported in 1877: \"The\r\nreport of the Deputy Superintendent-General in 1877 gives some\r\ndetails respecting the operations of the Manitoba Sioux on their\r\nreserves, during the past year. He says: 'Upon the whole, they\r\nappear to have made fair progress in cultivating the land, and\r\ntheir prospects for the future, had they the advice and assistance\r\nof some good farmers, for a few years, would be encouraging.\r\nIndeed, the Sioux generally, who are resident in Canada, appear to\r\nbe more intelligent, industrious, and self-reliant, than the other\r\nIndian bands in the North West.'\"\r\n\r\nWhile the authorities were thus successfully dealing with the\r\nproblem of how to provide a future for these wandering Sioux, a\r\ngrave difficulty presented itself by the incursion into the\r\nNorth-West Territories of a large body of American Sioux (supposed\r\nto be under the lead of what is now an historic name, the Sitting\r\nBull), who had fled from the American troops. The Minister of the\r\nInterior, the Hon. David Mills, in 1877, thus alluded to this\r\ndifficult subject:\r\n\r\n\"The presence of Sitting Bull and his warriors in Canada is a\r\nsource of anxiety both to the Government of Canada and the United\r\nStates. These Indians harbor feelings of fierce hostility towards,\r\nand thorough distrust of, the United States people and Government.\r\nThese feelings may be traced to two principal causes, the\r\ndishonesty of Indian agents and the failure of the Federal\r\nauthorities to protect the Indian reservations from being taken\r\npossession of by an adventurous and somewhat lawless white\r\npopulation. The officers of the North-West Mounted Police have been\r\ninstructed to impress upon Sitting Bull and his warriors the\r\nnecessity of keeping the peace towards the people of the United\r\nStates, and there is no reason for supposing they will not heed the\r\nwarnings which have been given them. It is not, however, desirable\r\nto encourage them to remain on Canadian territory, and Col. McLeod\r\nhas been accordingly instructed to impress them with their probable\r\nfuture hardships after the failure of the buffalo, should they\r\nelect to remain in Canada; that the President of the United States\r\nand his Cabinet are upright men, willing and anxious to do justice\r\nto the Indians; and should they return peacefully they will be\r\nproperly cared for, and any treaty made with them will be honestly\r\nfulfilled. It is desirable that as wards of the United States they\r\nshould return to that country, upon the Government of which morally\r\ndevolves the burden and the responsibility of their civilization.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sioux have since continued within the borders of Canada, and\r\nthe Minister of the Interior, Sir John Macdonald, reported in 1878,\r\n\"That it is only just to them to say, that they have behaved\r\nremarkably well ever since they crossed into Canada.\" Their\r\npresence in the North-West Territories has, however, been attended\r\nand will be followed, in any event, by serious consequences. The\r\nnatural food supply of our Canadian Indians, the Crees, Chippewas,\r\nAssiniboines and Blackfeet, of the Plain Country, viz., the\r\nbuffalo, was rapidly diminishing, and the advent of so large a body\r\nof foreign Indians has precipitated its diminution, so that the\r\nfinal extinction of the buffalo is fast drawing near. Already the\r\nGovernment of Canada, in the discharge of a national obligation,\r\nwhich has ever been recognized by all civilized authorities, has\r\nbeen obliged to come to the aid of the Blackfeet and other Indians\r\nto avert the danger and suffering from famine. The Sioux are\r\nalready feeling the hardships of their position, and it will tax\r\nthe skill and energies of the Government of Canada to provide a\r\nremedy. Already, at the instance of the Hon. David Mills, then\r\nMinister of the Interior (who visited Washington for the purpose),\r\nan effort was made by the American Government to induce the Sioux\r\nto return to their homes. Envoys were sent to them from the United\r\nStates, but they declined to accept the overtures made to them. On\r\nthe previous occasion of the flight into our territories of the\r\nSioux, the American Government, as has been before recited, after\r\nan interval of nearly four years, offered them protection on their\r\nreturn journey from British territory to their homes in the United\r\nStates and \"entire absolution for all past offences\". This forms a\r\nprecedent which should be invoked and would doubtless be accepted\r\nby the Sioux if they can be induced to believe in the good faith of\r\nthe American Government towards them. Every effort should be made\r\nto bring about so desirable a result, and the subject will\r\ndoubtless engage in the future, as it has done in the past, the\r\nanxious consideration and wise action of the Canadian Government,\r\nwho have a right to appeal to the President of the United States\r\nand his advisers, to relieve them from the incubus of the presence\r\nin our territories of so many of the wards of that Government, and\r\nwho are without the means or opportunities of obtaining a\r\nlivelihood for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE ADMINISTRATION OF THE TREATIES--THE HALF-BREEDS--THE FUTURE\r\nOF THE INDIAN TRIBES\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving placed before my readers, a history of the treaties of\r\nCanada with the Indian tribes, of Manitoba, the North-West\r\nTerritories and Kee-wa-tin, I now proceed, in conclusion, to deal\r\nwith the administration of these treaties and to consider the\r\nfuture of these interesting aboriginal races. I remark in the first\r\nplace that the provisions of these treaties must be carried out\r\nwith the utmost good faith and the nicest exactness. The Indians of\r\nCanada have, owing to the manner in which they were dealt with for\r\ngenerations by the Hudson's Bay Company, the former rulers of these\r\nvast territories, an abiding confidence in the Government of the\r\nQueen, or the Great Mother, as they style her. This must not, at\r\nall hazards, be shaken. It can be easily and fully maintained. The\r\ntreaties are all based upon the models of that made at the Stone\r\nFort in 1871 and the one made in 1873 at the north-west angle of\r\nthe Lake of the Woods with the Chippewa tribes, and these again are\r\nbased, in many material features, on those made by the Hon. W. B.\r\nRobinson with the Chippewas dwelling on the shores of Lakes Huron\r\nand Superior in 1860.\r\n\r\nThese may be summarized thus:\r\n\r\n1. A relinquishment, in all the great region from Lake Superior to\r\nthe foot of the Rocky Mountains, of all their right and title to\r\nthe lands covered by the treaties, saving certain reservations for\r\ntheir own use, and\r\n\r\n2. In return for such relinquishment, permission to the Indians to\r\nhunt over the ceded territory and to fish in the waters thereof,\r\nexcepting such portions of the territory as pass from the Crown\r\ninto the occupation of individuals or otherwise.\r\n\r\n3. The perpetual payment of annuities of five dollars per head to\r\neach Indian--man, woman and child. The payment of an annual salary\r\nof twenty-five dollars to each Chief, and of fifteen dollars to\r\neach Councillor, or head man, of a Chief (thus making them in a\r\nsense officers of the Crown), and in addition, suits of official\r\nclothing for the Chiefs and head men, British flags for the Chiefs,\r\nand silver medals. These last are given both in the United States\r\nand in Canada, in conformity with an ancient custom, and are much\r\nprized and cherished by the Chiefs and their families. Frequently\r\nthe Indians have exhibited to me with pride, old medals issued,\r\nwith the likeness of the King before the American war of\r\nIndependence, and which have passed down as heirlooms of their\r\nfamilies. On one occasion a young Chief, who had come of age and\r\naspired to be recognized as a Chief, was decorated in my presence\r\nwith the old King George silver medal, by one of the band, to whom\r\nit had been entrusted for safe keeping by the young man's father,\r\nwho was a Chief, with the charge that on the boy's coming of age,\r\nit would be delivered over to him. The Chieftainships were at first\r\npartly hereditary, partly won by deeds of daring and of leadership\r\nagainst the foe. They are now generally elected, though the\r\ntendency to hereditary succession still largely exists. The power\r\nof the Chiefs has been much broken of late, and I am of opinion\r\nthat it is of importance to strengthen the hands of the Chiefs\r\nand Councillors by a due recognition of their offices and respect\r\nbeing shewn them. They should be strongly impressed with the belief\r\nthat they are officers of the Crown, and that it is their duty\r\nto see that the Indians of their tribes obey the provisions of\r\nthe treaties. The importance of upholding the Chiefs, may be\r\nillustrated by an incident which occurred near Fort Ellice, after\r\nthe making of the treaty. A party composed of three men and the\r\nwife of one of them, were travelling as freighters; two of the\r\nmen were Half-breeds, the other a Canadian. One night, one of the\r\nHalf-breeds shot the Canadian, and attempted to kill the other\r\nHalf-breed, who fled to an Indian camp in the vicinity. The Chief\r\nof the band was there, and he at once took his young men with him,\r\nproceeded to the scene of the murder, and after making the offender\r\na prisoner, took him to the nearest police station and delivered\r\nhim to the authorities. The culprit was subsequently tried in\r\nManitoba, convicted of murder and hanged. For this action the Chief\r\nreceived the thanks of His Excellency the Earl of Dufferin, then\r\nGovernor-General of Canada. This case affords an illustration of\r\nthe value of the recognition of the Chiefs of the various bands,\r\nand shews of how much advantage, it is to the Crown to possess so\r\nlarge a number of Indian officials, duly recognized as such, and\r\nwho can be inspired with a proper sense of their responsibility to\r\nthe Government and to their bands, as well as to others. In all the\r\nnegotiations for treaties, the Chiefs took a controlling part, and\r\ngenerally exhibited great common sense and excellent judgment. It\r\nis therefore of the utmost importance to retain their confidence\r\nand cause their office to be recognized and respected by both\r\nwhites and Indians.\r\n\r\n4. The allotment of lands to the Indians, to be set aside as\r\nreserves for them for homes and agricultural purposes, and which\r\ncannot be sold or alienated without their consent, and then only\r\nfor their benefit; the extent of lands thus set apart being\r\ngenerally one section for each family of five. I regard this\r\nsystem as of great value. It at once secures to the Indian tribes\r\ntracts of land, which cannot be interfered with, by the rush of\r\nimmigration, and affords the means of inducing them to establish\r\nhomes and learn the arts of agriculture. I regard the Canadian\r\nsystem of allotting reserves to one or more bands together, in the\r\nlocalities in which they have had the habit of living, as far\r\npreferable to the American system of placing whole tribes, in large\r\nreserves, which eventually become the object of cupidity to the\r\nwhites, and the breaking up of which, has so often led to Indian\r\nwars and great discontent even if warfare did not result. The\r\nIndians, have a strong attachment to the localities, in which they\r\nand their fathers have been accustomed to dwell, and it is\r\ndesirable to cultivate this home feeling of attachment to the soil.\r\nMoreover, the Canadian system of band reserves has a tendency to\r\ndiminish the offensive strength of the Indian tribes, should they\r\never become restless, a remote contingency, if the treaties are\r\ncarefully observed. Besides, the fact of the reserves being\r\nscattered throughout the territories, will enable the Indians to\r\nobtain markets among the white settlers, for any surplus produce\r\nthey may eventually have to dispose of. It will be found desirable,\r\nto assign to each family parts of the reserve for their own use, so\r\nas to give them a sense of property in it, but all power of sale or\r\nalienation of such lands should be rigidly prohibited. Any\r\npremature enfranchisement of the Indians, or power given them to\r\npart with their lands, would inevitably lead to the speedy breaking\r\nup of the reserves, and the return of the Indians to their\r\nwandering mode of life, and thereby to the re-creation of a\r\ndifficulty which the assignment of reserves was calculated to\r\nobviate. There is no parallel between the condition of the\r\nNorth-Western Indians, and that of the Indians who have so long\r\nbeen under the fostering care of the Government in the older\r\nProvinces of Ontario and Quebec.\r\n\r\n5. A very important feature of all the treaties, is the giving to\r\nthe Indian bands, agricultural implements, oxen, cattle (to form\r\nthe nuclei of herds), and seed grain.\r\n\r\nThe Indians are fully aware that their old mode of life is passing\r\naway. They are not \"unconscious of their destiny;\" on the contrary,\r\nthey are harassed with fears as to the future of their children and\r\nthe hard present of their own lives. They are tractable, docile,\r\nand willing to learn. They recognize the fact that they must seek\r\npart of their living from \"the mother earth,\" to use their own\r\nphraseology. A Chief at Fort Pitt said to me,--\"I got a plough from\r\nMr. Christie of the Company twelve years ago. I have no cattle; I\r\nput myself and my young men in front of it in the spring, and drag\r\nit through the ground. I have no hoes; I make them out of the roots\r\nof trees. Surely, when the Great Mother hears of our needs, she\r\nwill come to our help.\" [Footnote: This band a year ago raised\r\nsufficient farm produce to support themselves without hunting.]\r\nSuch a disposition as this should be encouraged. Induce the Indians\r\nto erect houses on their farms, and plant their \"gardens\" as they\r\ncall them, and then while away on their hunts, their wives and\r\nchildren will have houses to dwell in, and will care for their\r\npatches of corn and grain and potatoes. Then, too, the cattle given\r\nthem will expand into herds. It is true that the number assigned\r\nto each band is comparatively limited, and the Government are\r\nnot bound to extend the number. This was done advisedly, by the\r\nsuccessive Governments of Canada, and the Commissioners, acting\r\nunder their instructions; for it was felt, that it was an\r\nexperiment to entrust them with cattle, owing to their inexperience\r\nwith regard to housing them and providing fodder for them in\r\nwinter, and owing, moreover, to the danger of their using them for\r\nfood, if short of buffalo meat or game. Besides, it was felt, that\r\nas the Indian is, and naturally so, always asking, it was better,\r\nthat if the Government saw their way safely to increase the number\r\nof cattle given to any band, it should be, not as a matter of\r\nright, but of grace and favor, and as a reward for exertion in\r\nthe care of them, and as an incentive to industry. Already, the\r\nprospect of many of the bands turning their attention to raising\r\nfood from the soil is very hopeful. In the reserve of St. Peter's,\r\nin Manitoba, the Church of England has for many years had a church\r\nand mission, and long before the advent of Canada as ruler of the\r\nlands, the Indians of the Indian settlement had their houses and\r\ngardens, the produce of which, went to supplement the results of\r\nfishing and hunting. And so on the shores and islands of the Lake\r\nof the Woods and on Rainy Lake, the Indians had their gardens.\r\nSince the treaties, the Indians are turning their attention\r\nmuch more to cultivating the soil. The Indian district agent in\r\nthe Qu'Appelle region, reported in November, 1878, that of the\r\ntwenty-four bands in this treaty, eleven are gradually turning\r\ntheir attention to farming, and of these Chief Cote, of Swan River,\r\nis the most advanced, having harvested that year two hundred and\r\neighty bushels of barley, over three thousand bushels of potatoes,\r\nand a large quantity of other vegetables. The increase from the\r\nfour cows he received two years since is eleven head. This may\r\nappear large, but such is the fact.\r\n\r\nLieut.-Gov. Laird reported in 1877, \"That some of the bands within\r\nthe limits of Treaties Numbers Four and Six sowed grain and\r\npotatoes with good results that year, one band having about one\r\nhundred acres under cultivation.\" He also states that the Indians\r\nare very desirous of farming, and that he has hopes that a much\r\nlarger quantity of seed will be sown next year (1879). He also\r\nstates that the band at White Fish Lake, raised enough that year to\r\nmaintain themselves without going to hunt. The Superintendent also\r\nreported that in the Manitoba superintendency \"a general desire to\r\nbe taught farming, building and other civilized arts exists, and\r\nsome of the Indians in Treaty Number Three, living in the vicinity\r\nof Fort Francis, are said to evince enterprise and progress in\r\ntheir farming operations.\" At Lac Seule, also in this treaty, the\r\nprogress of the Indians is quite marked. They have established two\r\nvillages in order to have the benefit of schools.\r\n\r\nThe Indian agent in the Lake Manitoba district makes a similar\r\nstatement. One band has eighteen small farms of one hundred acres\r\nin all, on which they raise potatoes, Indian corn and garden\r\nvegetables. They have twenty-nine houses, twenty-four horses, and\r\nthirty-six head of cattle, of their own. Another built during the\r\nyear a good school-house, nineteen new houses, and had one hundred\r\nand twenty-five acres under cultivation. Another had just begun\r\nfarming, built six houses, two stables and a barn, and possess\r\nseven head of cattle. Still another had twenty-three houses and one\r\nhundred and fifty acres under tillage, raising barley, wheat,\r\npotatoes and vegetables, and having thirty-six head of cattle. It\r\nis unnecessary to multiply instances, of the aptitude, the Indians\r\nare exhibiting, within so recent a period after the completion of\r\nthe treaties, to avail themselves of obtaining their subsistence\r\nfrom the soil. Their desire to do so, should be cultivated to the\r\nfullest extent. They are, of course, generally ignorant of the\r\nproper mode of farming. In the year 1876, I reported to the\r\nMinister of the Interior, the Hon. David Mills, after my return\r\nfrom the negotiation of the treaties at Forts Carlton and Pitt,\r\n\"that measures ought to be taken to instruct the Indians in farming\r\nand building.\"\r\n\r\nI said \"that their present mode of living is passing away; the\r\nIndians are tractable, docile and willing to learn. I think that\r\nadvantage should be taken of this disposition to teach them to\r\nbecome self-supporting, which can best be accomplished by the aid\r\nof a few practical farmers and carpenters to instruct them in\r\nfarming and house-building.\"\r\n\r\nThis view was corroborated by my successor, Lieutenant-Governor\r\nLaird, who in 1878 reported from Battleford \"that if it were\r\npossible to employ a few good, practical men to aid and instruct\r\nthe Indians at seed time, I am of opinion that most of the bands on\r\nthe Saskatchewan would soon be able to raise sufficient crops to\r\nmeet their most pressing wants.\"\r\n\r\nIt is satisfactory to know, that the Government of Canada, decided\r\nto act on these suggestions, at least in part, and have during the\r\npast summer sent farm instructors into the Plain country. It is to\r\nbe hoped, that this step may prove as fruitful of good results, as\r\nthe earnest desire of the Indians to farm would lead us to believe\r\nit may be.\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS\r\n\r\n6. The treaties provide for the establishment of schools, on the\r\nreserves, for the instruction of the Indian children. This is a\r\nvery important feature, and is deserving of being pressed with the\r\nutmost energy. The new generation can be trained in the habits and\r\nways of civilized life--prepared to encounter the difficulties with\r\nwhich they will be surrounded, by the influx of settlers, and\r\nfitted for maintaining themselves as tillers of the soil. The\r\nerection of a school-house on a reserve will be attended with\r\nslight expense, and the Indians would often give their labour\r\ntowards its construction.\r\n\r\n7. The treaties all provide for the exclusion of the sale of\r\nspirits, or \"fire-water,\" on the reserves. The Indians themselves\r\nknow their weakness. Their wise men say, \"If it is there we will\r\nuse it, give us a strong law against it.\" A general prohibitory\r\nliquor law, originally enacted by the North-West Council and\r\nre-enacted by the Parliament of Canada, is in force in the\r\nNorth-West Territories and has been productive of much benefit, but\r\nwill, in the near future, be difficult of enforcement owing to the\r\nvast extent of the territory.\r\n\r\nSuch are the main features of the treaties between Canada and the\r\nIndians, and, few as they are, they comprehend the whole future of\r\nthe Indians and of their relations to the Dominion.\r\n\r\nMACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nTo carry them out, the treaty area has been divided into two\r\nSuperintendencies, that of Manitoba, including Treaties Numbers\r\nOne, Two, Three and Four, and that of the North-West Territories,\r\nincluding Treaties Numbers Five, Six and Seven. Mr. Dewdney, late\r\na Member of the House of Commons from British Columbia, has\r\nrecently been appointed to the latter Superintendency as Chief\r\nSuperintendent, and has spent the summer among the Indian tribes.\r\nHe has had large experience among Indians, and will prove, I have\r\nno doubt, an efficient and able officer. His residence will be\r\nin his Superintendency, and he will be able to meet the Indians\r\nand supervise his deputies. Under the Superintendents are agents\r\nhaving charge of particular districts and the bands within them,\r\nwho reside among them. The Chief Superintendents and agents are\r\nofficers of the Department of the Interior, and are directed by and\r\nreport to the Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs at Ottawa,\r\nLawrence Vankoughnet, Esq., who has had long experience of Indian\r\nmanagement in the older Provinces, and his superior, Col. Dennis,\r\nDeputy Minister of the Interior, who had a large practical\r\nacquaintance with the North-West, and the head of the Department,\r\nnow the Premier of the Dominion, the Right Hon. Sir John Macdonald.\r\nThe system of management is thus a complete one, and doubtless, day\r\nby day, its mode of management, will be perfected and adapted to\r\nthe growing exigencies and wants of the native population.\r\n\r\nTHE HALF-BREEDS\r\n\r\nEre passing from the subject, I cannot refrain from alluding to the\r\nHalf-breed population of the North-West Territories. Those people\r\nare mainly of French Canadian descent, though there are a few of\r\nScotch blood in the territories. Their influence with the Indian\r\npopulation is extensive. In Manitoba there is a large population of\r\nFrench Metis and Scotch Half-breeds, and they are proud of their\r\nmixed blood. This race is an important factor with regard to all\r\nNorth-West questions. His Excellency the Earl of Dufferin, with his\r\nkeen appreciation of men and facts, astutely seized the position\r\nand thus referred to them in his speech at a banquet in his honor,\r\ngiven by the citizens of the whilome hamlet, and now city of\r\nWinnipeg, on the occasion of his visit to the Province of Manitoba\r\nin the year 1877.\r\n\r\n\"There is no doubt that a great deal of the good feeling thus\r\nsubsisting between the red men and ourselves is due to the\r\ninfluence and interposition of that invaluable class of men the\r\nHalf-breed settlers and pioneers of Manitoba, who, combining as\r\nthey do the hardihood, the endurance and love of enterprise\r\ngenerated by the strain of Indian blood within their veins, with\r\nthe civilization, the instruction, and the intellectual power\r\nderived from their fathers, have preached the Gospel of peace and\r\ngood will, and mutual respect, with equally beneficent results to\r\nthe Indian chieftain in his lodge and to the British settler in the\r\nshanty. They have been the ambassadors between the east and the\r\nwest; the interpreters of civilization and its exigencies to the\r\ndwellers on the prairie as well as the exponents to the white men\r\nof the consideration justly due to the susceptibilities, the\r\nsensitive self-respect, the prejudices, the innate craving for\r\njustice, of the Indian race. In fact they have done for the colony\r\nwhat otherwise would have been left unaccomplished and have\r\nintroduced between the white population and the red man a\r\ntraditional feeling of amity and friendship which but for them it\r\nmight have been impossible to establish.\"\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I can frankly say, that I always had the\r\nconfidence, support and active co-operation of the Half-breeds of\r\nall origins, in my negotiations with the Indian tribes, and I owe\r\nthem this full acknowledgment thereof. The Half-breeds in the\r\nterritories are of three classes--1st, those who as at St. Laurent,\r\nnear Prince Albert, the Qu'Appelle Lakes and Edmonton, have their\r\nfarms and homes; 2nd, those who are entirely identified with the\r\nIndians, living with them, and speaking their language; 3rd, those\r\nwho do not farm, but live after the habits of the Indians, by the\r\npursuit of the buffalo and the chase.\r\n\r\nAs to the first class, the question is an easy one. They will, of\r\ncourse, be recognized as possessors of the soil, and confirmed by\r\nthe Government in their holdings, and will continue to make their\r\nliving by farming and trading.\r\n\r\nThe second class have been recognized as Indians, and have passed\r\ninto the bands among whom they reside.\r\n\r\nThe position of the third class is more difficult. The loss of the\r\nmeans of livelihood by the destruction of the buffalo, presses upon\r\nthem, as upon our Indian tribes; and with regard to them I reported\r\nin 1876, and I have seen no reason to change my views, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"There is another class of the population in the North-West whose\r\nposition I desire to bring under the notice of the Privy Council. I\r\nrefer to the wandering Half-breeds of the plains, who are chiefly\r\nof French descent and live the life of the Indians. There are a few\r\nwho are identified with the Indians, but there is a large class of\r\nMetis who live by the hunt of the buffalo, and have no settled\r\nhomes. I think that a census of the numbers of these should be\r\nprocured, and while I would not be disposed to recommend their\r\nbeing brought under the treaties, I would suggest that land should\r\nbe assigned to them, and that on their settling down, if after an\r\nexamination into their circumstances, it should be found necessary\r\nand expedient, some assistance should be given them to enable them\r\nto enter upon agricultural operations.\"\r\n\r\nFUTURE OF THE INDIANS\r\n\r\nAnd now I come, to a very important question, What is to be the\r\nfuture of the Indian population of the North-West? I believe it to\r\nbe a hopeful one. I have every confidence in the desire and ability\r\nof the present administration, as of any succeeding one, to carry\r\nout the provisions of the treaties, and to extend a helping hand to\r\nthis helpless population. That, conceded, with the machinery at\r\ntheir disposal, with a judicious selection of agents and farm\r\ninstructors, and the additional aid of well-selected carpenters,\r\nand efficient school teachers, I look forward to seeing the\r\nIndians, faithful allies of the Crown, while they can gradually be\r\nmade an increasing and self-supporting population.\r\n\r\nThey are wards of Canada, let us do our duty by them, and repeat in\r\nthe North-west, the success which has attended our dealings with\r\nthem in old Canada, for the last hundred years.\r\n\r\nBut the Churches too have their duties to fulfil. There is a common\r\nground between the Christian Churches and the Indians, as they all\r\nbelieve as we do, in a Great Spirit. The transition thence to the\r\nChristian's God is an easy one.\r\n\r\nMany of them appeal for missionaries, and utter the Macedonian cry,\r\n\"come over and help us.\" The Churches have already done and are\r\ndoing much. The Church of Rome has its bishops and clergy, who have\r\nlong been laboring assiduously and actively. The Church of England\r\nhas its bishops and clergy on the shores of the Hudson's Bay, in\r\nthe cold region of the Mackenzie and the dioceses of Rupert's Land\r\nand Saskatchewan. The Methodist Church has its missions on Lake\r\nWinnipeg, in the Saskatchewan Valley, and on the slopes of the\r\nRocky Mountains. The Presbyterians have lately commenced a work\r\namong the Chippewas and Sioux. There is room enough and to spare,\r\nfor all, and the Churches should expand and maintain their work.\r\nAlready many of the missionaries have made records which will live\r\nin history: among those of recent times, Archbishop Tache, Bishop\r\nGrandin, Pere Lacombe, and many others of the Catholic Church;\r\nBishops Machray, Bompas, Archdeacons Cochran and Cowley of the\r\nChurch of England; Revs. Messrs. Macdougall of the Wesleyan and\r\nNisbet of the Presbyterian Churches, have lived and labored, and\r\nthough some of them have gone to their rest, they have left and\r\nwill leave behind them a record of self-denial, untiring zeal, and\r\nmany good results. Let the Churches persevere and prosper.\r\n\r\nAnd now I close. Let us have Christianity and civilization to\r\nleaven the mass of heathenism and paganism among the Indian tribes;\r\nlet us have a wise and paternal Government faithfully carrying out\r\nthe provisions of our treaties, and doing its utmost to help and\r\nelevate the Indian population, who have been cast upon our care,\r\nand we will have peace, progress, and concord among them in the\r\nNorth-West; and instead of the Indian melting away, as one of them\r\nin older Canada, tersely put it, \"as snow before the sun,\" we will\r\nsee our Indian population, loyal subjects of the Crown, happy,\r\nprosperous and self-sustaining, and Canada will be enabled to feel,\r\nthat in a truly patriotic spirit, our country has done its duty by\r\nthe red men of the North-West, and thereby to herself. So may it\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTE.--The foregoing represents a copy of the\r\nsignatures of the contracting parties to the Selkirk Treaty, the\r\nIndians signing by their own distinctive marks, and also affixing\r\ntheir signs opposite the tracts of country claimed by them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nTEXTS OF TREATIES AND SUPPLEMENTARY ADHESIONS THERETO\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SELKIRK TREATY\r\n\r\nThis indenture, made on the eighteenth day of July, in the\r\nfifty-seventh year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord King George\r\nthe Third, and in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and\r\nseventeen, between the undersigned Chiefs and warriors of the\r\nChippeway or Saulteaux Nation and of the Killistine or Cree Nation,\r\non the one part, and the Right Honorable Thomas Earl of Selkirk, on\r\nthe other part:\r\n\r\nWitnesseth, that for and in consideration of the annual present or\r\nquit rent hereinafter mentioned, the said Chiefs have given,\r\ngranted and confirmed, and do, by these presents, give, grant and\r\nconfirm unto our Sovereign Lord the King all that tract of land\r\nadjacent to Red River and Ossiniboyne River, beginning at the mouth\r\nof Red River and extending along same as far as Great Forks at the\r\nmouth of Red Lake River, and along Ossiniboyne River, otherwise\r\ncalled Riviere des Champignons, and extending to the distance of\r\nsix miles from Fort Douglas on every side, and likewise from Fort\r\nDoer, and also from the Great Forks and in other parts extending in\r\nbreadth to the distance of two English statute miles back from the\r\nbanks of the said rivers, on each side, together with all the\r\nappurtenances whatsoever of the said tract of land, to have and to\r\nhold forever the said tract of land and appurtenances to the use of\r\nthe said Earl of Selkirk, and of the settlers being established\r\nthereon, with the consent and permission of our Sovereign Lord the\r\nKing, or of the said Earl of Selkirk.

This is a very\r\nextensive district, and in it are many valuable groves of pine.\r\n\r\nKe-ba-quin, Chief of the region intervening between the present\r\nline of the Red River route and the United States boundary line,\r\neast of Rainy Lake and west of the height of land. The gold bearing\r\ncountry is in this Chief's district.\r\n\r\nMetas-so-que-nes-hauk, Chief of Lac des Mille Lacs and the district\r\nto the north, lying along the height of land between that lake and\r\nthe waters of the Nipegon and Lac Seul. This Chief is a very\r\nintelligent man, and has already begun, to make his people clear\r\nland and grow crops.\r\n\r\nEach of these three principal Chiefs will have a staff of\r\nLieutenants or subordinate Chiefs, not exceeding three to their\r\nrespective bands, as provided for in the treaty but they preferred\r\nnot to name them at once, saying that the selection was a matter of\r\nsome delicacy to them, and requiring a little time.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the reserves provided for in the treaty, I shall\r\nas soon as possible submit a scheme which I think will meet\r\nthe circumstances, and at the same time draw attention to some\r\nexperience gained in negotiating with these Indians, which may\r\nbe of use in similar negotiations in the future.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: In 1874 Mr. Dawson and Mr. Pither were appointed to meet\r\nthe Indians and arrange the position of the reserves, which they\r\ndid; but subsequently, the Indians claiming that they had not fully\r\nunderstood the exact location or extent of some of the reserves,\r\nColonel Dennis, then Surveyor-General, now Deputy Minister of the\r\nInterior, was instructed to visit the Indians comprised in Treaty\r\nNumber Three, and finally adjust the question of reserves. Colonel\r\nDennis undertook this duty in 1875 and satisfactorily arranged a\r\nscheme of reserves for the different bands of the Lake of the Woods.\r\nColonel Dennis submitted a comprehensive report of the results of\r\nhis mission, and suggested the appointment of sub-agents, the fixing\r\nof a specific day for payment to the Indians of their annuities in\r\neach agency district, that the necessary funds and the articles for\r\ndistribution should be provided and in the agents' hands in good time.\r\nHe advised that the local agents should have some practical knowledge\r\nof agriculture, as he believed that the Indians would succeed in\r\nraising quantities of stock, though the character of the country\r\nprevented their general success as farmers. He suggested further the\r\nerection of halls at each agency and the employment of young Indians\r\nby the builders entrusted with their construction, \"as they are so\r\nquick in perception and handy in the use of tools that they would\r\nspeedily become very expert.\" The author regrets that he did not\r\nobtain communication of this valuable report until this work had\r\nadvanced too far to admit of its being incorporated with it.]\r\n\r\nThe copy of the treaty signed by these Chiefs is enclosed herewith\r\nand to it is attached a document signed by the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nof Manitoba and the North-West Territories, and Mr. Provencher,\r\nempowering me to act for them in their absence, in their capacity\r\nof Indian Commissioners.\r\n\r\n           I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                         Your obedient servant,\r\n                           (Signed) S. J.

That the written memorandum attached to Treaty Number One be\r\nconsidered as part of that treaty and of Treaty Number Two, and\r\nthat the Indian Commissioner be instructed to carry out the\r\npromises therein contained in so far as they have not yet been\r\ncarried out, and that the Commissioner be advised to inform the\r\nIndians that he has been authorized so to do.\r\n\r\n2nd. That the Indian Commissioner be instructed to inform the\r\nIndians, parties to Treaties Numbers One and Two, that, while the\r\nGovernment cannot admit their claim to anything which is not set\r\nforth in the treaty and in the memorandum attached thereto, which\r\ntreaty is binding alike upon the Government and upon the Indians,\r\nyet, as there seems to have been some misunderstanding between the\r\nIndian Commissioner and the Indians in the matter of Treaties\r\nNumbers One and Two, the Government out of good feeling to the\r\nIndians and as a matter of benevolence, is willing to raise the\r\nannual payment to each Indian under Treaties Numbers One and Two\r\nfrom three dollars to five dollars per annum, and make payment over\r\nand above such sum of five dollars, of twenty dollars each and\r\nevery year to each Chief, and a suit of clothing every three years\r\nto each Chief and each head man, allowing two head men to each\r\nband; on the express understanding, however, that each Chief or\r\nother Indian who shall receive such increased annuity or annual\r\npayment shall be held to abandon all claim whatever against the\r\nGovernment in connection with the so called \"outside promises\"\r\nother than those contained in the memorandum attached to the\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nThe committee submit the foregoing recommendation for Your\r\nExcellency's approval.\r\n\r\n          (Signed) W.

Little Pine\r\nis a Cree Chief who has for some time expressed his willingness to\r\ntake the treaty. Lucky Man is a head man lately made by the Indians\r\nwho have been followers of Big Bear but who have now left him.\r\n\r\nBig Bear himself was present when both Little Pine and Lucky Man\r\nsigned, and, I think would have taken the treaty himself, had he\r\nnot felt ashamed at so many of his lodges leaving him. He is now\r\nalmost alone, only three or four followers having remained with\r\nhim. He states that he will take the treaty at Sounding Lake at the\r\ntime of the payments.\r\n\r\nBoth Little Pine and Lucky Man have requested that they may be paid\r\nat Fort Walsh, as it is impossible for them to reach the more\r\nnorthern agencies, and I have agreed to it. It will therefore be\r\nnecessary that enough money be forwarded to pay these Indians here.\r\nLittle Pine states he will have thirty-four lodges, and Lucky Man\r\ntwenty-five. Taking the average of a lodge at eight, which I\r\nunderstand is a fair estimate, it will make four hundred and\r\nseventy-two extra Indians to be paid.\r\n\r\n                  I have, &c.,\r\n           (Signed)    EDGAR DEWDNEY,\r\n                          Indian Commissioner.\r\nL.

And whereas, the said Commissioner has recognized the said\r\nLittle Pine as the head man of his band, and the said band of\r\ntwenty lodges have selected and appointed Pap-a-way the Lucky Man,\r\none of their number, as the head man of their band, and have\r\npresented him as such to the said Commissioner, who has recognized\r\nand accepted him as such head man.\r\n\r\nNow this instrument witnesseth that the said Little Pine and\r\nPap-a-way, or the Lucky Man, for themselves and on behalf of the\r\nbands which they represent, do transfer, surrender and relinquish\r\nto her Majesty the Queen, her heirs and successors to and for the\r\nuse of her Government of the Dominion of Canada, all their right,\r\ntitle and interest whatsoever, which they have held or enjoyed, of,\r\nin and to the territory described and fully set out in the said\r\ntreaty; also all their right, title and interest whatsoever to all\r\nother lands wherever situated, whether within their limits of any\r\nother treaty heretofore made or hereafter to be made with Indians\r\nor elsewhere in Her Majesty's territories, to have and to hold the\r\nsame unto and for the use of Her Majesty the Queen, her heirs and\r\nsuccessors forever.
