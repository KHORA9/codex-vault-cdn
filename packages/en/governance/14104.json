In reality, it is undergoing a profound\r\nchange. The idea which constituted its most distinctive feature, and in\r\nthe belief of many represents America's most valuable contribution to\r\nthe science of government, is being forgotten. Formed to be \"an\r\nindestructible Union composed of indestructible states,\" our dual system\r\nis losing its duality. The states are fading out of the picture.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this volume is to point out the change and discuss some of\r\nits aspects. A few chapters have already appeared in print. \"Our\r\nChanging Constitution\" and \"Is the Federal Corporation Tax\r\nConstitutional?\" were published in the _Outlook_. \"The Corporation Tax\r\nDecision\" appeared in the _Yale Law Journal_. \"Can Congress Tax the\r\nIncome from State and Municipal Bonds?\" was printed in the New York\r\n_Evening Post_. All of these have been more or less revised and some new\r\nmatter has been added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE SALIENT FEATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION 1\r\n\r\nThe American Constitution, its origin and contents. Wherein its novelty\r\nand greatness lay. Importance of maintaining the equilibrium established\r\nbetween national and state power. View of John Fiske.\r\n\r\nII. THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 3\r\n\r\nPlace of the Court in the constitutional scheme. Its most important\r\nfunction. Personnel of the Court. Its power moral rather than physical.\r\nIts chief weapon the power to declare legislative acts unconstitutional.\r\nLimitations on this power--political questions; necessity of an actual\r\ncontroversy; abuses of legislative power. Erroneous popular impressions.\r\nImpairment of the constitutional conscience.\r\n\r\nIII. OUR CHANGING CONSTITUTION 18\r\n\r\nChange in popular attitude toward the Constitution. Causes of the change\r\n(growth of national consciousness, wars, foreign relations, influence of\r\nlater immigrants and their descendants, desire to obtain federal\r\nappropriations, economic development, railroads, free trade among the\r\nstates). Methods by which change has been put into effect\r\n(constitutional amendment, treaties, federal legislation under cover of\r\npower to regulate commerce and lay taxes). Attitude of the Supreme\r\nCourt. Differences of opinion in the Court.\r\n\r\nIV. THE EIGHTEENTH OR PROHIBITION AMENDMENT 35\r\n\r\nHistory and radical character of amendment. Efforts to defeat it in the\r\ncourts. Unusual course taken by Supreme Court. Discussion of its true\r\nplace in the development of American constitutional law. Less a point of\r\ndeparture than a spectacular manifestation of a change already under\r\nway. Effect of the change on the principle of local self-government.\r\n\r\nV. THE NINETEENTH OR WOMAN SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT 49\r\n\r\nAttitude of the Constitution toward question of suffrage qualifications.\r\nEffect of Civil War amendments. Growth of woman suffrage movement and\r\nadoption of Suffrage Amendment. How far the amendment constitutes a\r\nfederal encroachment on state power.

The decision explained.\r\nReënactment of law by Congress under cover of power to lay taxes.\r\nArguments for and against constitutionality of new enactment.\r\n\r\nVII. STATE RIGHTS AND THE SUPREME COURT 69\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court at first a bulwark of national power; to-day the\r\ndefender of the states. Explanation of this apparent change. Attitude of\r\nthe Court in the first period. The period of Chief Justice Marshall. The\r\nperiod of Chief Justice Taney. The Reconstruction Period. Attitude of\r\nthe Court to-day. Reasons why the Court is unable to prevent federal\r\nencroachment. Attitude of Hamilton and Marshall toward state rights\r\nmisunderstood.\r\n\r\nVIII. THE FEDERAL TAXING POWER AND THE INCOME TAX AMENDMENT 85\r\n\r\nAmerica's embarrassing position if the late war had come before adoption\r\nof Income Tax Amendment. Limitations of federal taxing power under the\r\nConstitution. Meaning of \"uniformity.\" Apportionment of \"direct taxes.\"\r\nThe Supreme Court decision in the Income Tax cases in 1894 a reversal of\r\nlong settled ideas. The Income Tax Amendment an example of recall of\r\njudicial decisions. Implied limitations on federal taxing power\r\n(compensation of federal judges, due process clause of the Constitution,\r\nno power to tax property or governmental activities of the states).\r\n\r\nIX. CAN CONGRESS TAX THE INCOME FROM STATE AND MUNICIPAL BONDS? 97\r\n\r\nNo express prohibition of such taxation; it lies in an implied\r\nlimitation inherent in our dual system of government. Discussion of\r\ndoctrine and its development by the Supreme Court. Effect of the Income\r\nTax Amendment. Present dissatisfaction with doctrine and efforts to\r\nabolish it.\r\n\r\nX.

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE TRUSTS 129\r\n\r\nOrigin and history of Sherman Act. Its meaning now clear. Earlier\r\nuncertainties owing chiefly to two questions--What is interstate trade\r\nand Does the act enlarge the common-law rule as to what restraints were\r\nunlawful? How these questions have been settled. Statement of the\r\ncommon-law rule. Incompatibility between the law and present economic\r\nconditions. Suggestions for legal reform.

WHAT OF THE FUTURE? 143\r\n\r\nRapid progress and present extent of federal encroachment on state\r\npower. Growth of federal bureaucracy. A reaction against centralization\r\ninevitable sooner or later. Adequacy of Constitution to deal with\r\nchanging conditions. The railroads and the trusts. Dangerous assaults\r\nupon Constitution in field of social welfare legislation. Exercise of\r\npolice power a matter for local authority. Elihu Root's view. Outlook\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX 153\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR CHANGING CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE SALIENT FEATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nFew documents known to history have received as much praise as the\r\nUnited States Constitution. Gladstone called it \"the most wonderful work\r\never struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man.\" The\r\ncasual reader of the Constitution will be at a loss to account for such\r\nadulation. It will seem to him a businesslike document, outlining a\r\nscheme of government in terse and well-chosen phrases, but he is apt to\r\nlook in vain for any earmarks of special inspiration. To understand the\r\ntrue greatness of the instrument something more is required than a mere\r\nreading of its provisions.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution was the work of a convention of delegates from the\r\nstates, who met in Philadelphia in May, 1787, and labored together for\r\nnearly four months. They included a large part of the best character\r\nand intellect of the country. George Washington presided over their\r\ndeliberations. The delegates had not been called together for the\r\npurpose of organizing a new government. Their instructions were limited\r\nto revising and proposing improvements in the Articles of the existing\r\nConfederation, whose inefficiency and weakness, now that the cohesive\r\npower of common danger in the war of the Revolution was gone, had become\r\na byword. This task, however, was decided to be hopeless, and with great\r\nboldness the convention proceeded to disregard instructions and prepare\r\na wholly new Constitution constructed on a plan radically different from\r\nthat of the Articles of Confederation. The contents of the Constitution,\r\nas finally drafted and submitted for ratification, may be described in\r\nfew words. It created a legislative department consisting of a Senate\r\nand a House of Representatives, an executive department headed by a\r\nPresident, and a judicial department headed by a Supreme Court, and\r\nprescribed in general terms the qualifications, powers, and functions of\r\neach. It provided for the admission of new states into the Union and\r\nthat the United States should guarantee to every state a republican form\r\nof government. It declared that the Constitution and the laws of the\r\nUnited States made in pursuance thereof, and treaties, should be the\r\nsupreme law of the land. It provided a method for its own amendment.\r\nSave for a few other brief clauses, that was all. There was no\r\nproclamation of Democracy; no trumpet blast about the rights of man such\r\nas had sounded in the Declaration of Independence. On the contrary, the\r\ninstrument expressly recognized human slavery, though in discreet and\r\neuphemistic phrases.\r\n\r\nWherein, then, did the novelty and greatness of the Constitution lie?\r\nIts novelty lay in the duality of the form of government which it\r\ncreated--a nation dealing directly with its citizens and yet composed of\r\nsovereign states--and in its system of checks and balances. The world\r\nhad seen confederations of states. It was familiar with nations\r\nsubdivided into provinces or other administrative units. It had known\r\nexperiments in pure democracy. The constitutional scheme was none of\r\nthese. It was something new, and its novel features were relied upon as\r\na protection from the evils which had developed under the other plans.\r\nThe greatness of the Constitution lay in its nice adjustment of the\r\npowers of government, notably the division of powers which it effected\r\nbetween the National Government and the states. The powers conferred on\r\nthe National Government were clearly set forth. All were of a strictly\r\nnational character. They covered the field of foreign relations,\r\ninterstate and foreign commerce, fiscal and monetary system, post office\r\nand post roads, patents and copyrights, and jurisdiction over certain\r\nspecified crimes. All other powers were reserved to the states or the\r\npeople. In other words, the theory was (to quote Bryce's \"The American\r\nCommonwealth\") \"local government for local affairs; general government\r\nfor general affairs only.\"\r\n\r\nThe Constitution as it left the hands of its framers was not entirely\r\nsatisfactory to anybody. Owing to the discordant interests and mutual\r\njealousies of the states, it was of necessity an instrument of many\r\ncompromises. One of the great compromises was that by which the small\r\nstates were given as many senators as the large. Another is embalmed in\r\nthe provisions recognizing slavery and permitting slaves to count in the\r\napportionment of representatives. (The number of a state's\r\nrepresentatives was to be determined \"by adding to the whole number of\r\nfree persons ... three-fifths of all other persons.\") Another was the\r\nprovision that direct taxes should be apportioned among the states\r\naccording to population. With all its compromises, however, the\r\nConstitution embodied a great governmental principle, full of hope for\r\nthe future of the country, and the state conventions to which it was\r\nsubmitted for ratification were wise enough to accept what was offered.\r\nRatification by certain of the states was facilitated by the publication\r\nof that remarkable series of papers afterward known as the \"Federalist.\"\r\nThese were the work of Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay,\r\nand first appeared in New York newspapers.\r\n\r\nOne of the objections to the new Constitution in the minds of many\r\npeople was the absence of a \"bill of rights\" containing those provisions\r\nfor the protection of individual liberty and property (e.g., trial by\r\njury, freedom of speech, protection from unreasonable searches and\r\nseizures) which had come down from the early charters of English\r\nliberties. In deference to this sentiment a series of ten brief\r\namendments were proposed and speedily ratified. Another amendment (No.\r\nXI) was soon afterward adopted for the purpose of doing away with the\r\neffect of a Supreme Court decision. Thereafter, save for a change in\r\nthe manner of electing the President and Vice-president, the\r\nConstitution was not again amended until after the close of the Civil\r\nWar, when Amendments XIII, XIV, and XV, having for their primary object\r\nthe protection of the newly enfranchised Negroes, were adopted. The\r\nConstitution was not again amended until the last decade, when the\r\nIncome Tax Amendment, the amendment providing for the election of\r\nSenators by popular vote, the Prohibition Amendment, and the Woman\r\nSuffrage Amendment were adopted in rapid succession. Some of these will\r\nbe discussed in later chapters.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that two of the amendments (No. XI, designed\r\nto prevent suits against a state without its permission by citizens of\r\nanother state, and No. XVI, paving the way for the Income Tax) were\r\ncalled forth by unpopular decisions of the Supreme Court, and virtually\r\namounted to a recall of those decisions by the people. These instances\r\ndemonstrate the possibility of a recall of judicial decisions by\r\nconstitutional methods, and tend to refute impatient reformers who\r\npreach the necessity of a more summary procedure. Such questions,\r\nhowever, lie outside the scope of this book. We emphasize here the fact\r\nthat the great achievement of the Constitution was the creation of a\r\ndual system of government and the apportionment of its powers. That was\r\nwhat made it \"one of the longest reaches of constructive statesmanship\r\never known in the world.\"[1] It offered the most promising solution yet\r\ndevised for the problem of building a nation without tearing down local\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Fiske: \"The Critical Period of American History,\" p. 301.]\r\n\r\nJohn Fiske, the historian, writing of the importance of preserving the\r\nconstitutional equilibrium between nation and states, said:[1]\r\n\r\n     If the day should ever arrive (which God forbid!) when the\r\n     people of the different parts of our country shall allow their\r\n     local affairs to be administered by prefects sent from\r\n     Washington, and when the self-government of the states shall\r\n     have been so far lost as that of the departments of France, or\r\n     even so far as that of the counties of England--on that day\r\n     the progressive political career of the American people will\r\n     have come to an end, and the hopes that have been built upon\r\n     it for the future happiness and prosperity of mankind will be\r\n     wrecked forever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Id., p. 238.]\r\n\r\nIf allowance be made for certain extravagances of statement, these words\r\nwill serve as a fitting introduction to the discussions which follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution effected an apportionment of the powers of government\r\nbetween nation and states. The maintenance of the equilibrium thus\r\nestablished was especially committed to the Supreme Court. This novel\r\noffice, the most important of all its great functions, makes the Court\r\none of the most vital factors of the entire governmental scheme and\r\ngives it a unique preëminence among the judicial tribunals of the world.\r\n\r\nHow the office has been performed, and whether the constitutional\r\nequilibrium is actually being maintained, are the questions to be\r\nconsidered in this book. Before taking them up, however, it will be\r\nuseful to glance briefly at the Court itself and inquire how it is\r\nequipped for its difficult task.\r\n\r\nThe United States Supreme Court at present is composed of nine judges.\r\nThe number originally was six. It now holds its sessions at the Capitol\r\nin Washington, in the old Senate Chamber which once echoed with the\r\neloquence of the Webster-Hayne debate. The judges are nominated by the\r\nPresident, and their appointment, like that of ambassadors, must be\r\nconfirmed by the Senate. The makers of the Constitution took the utmost\r\ncare to insure the independence of the Court. Its members hold office\r\nduring good behavior, that is to say for life. They cannot be removed\r\nexcept by impeachment for misconduct. Only one attempt has ever been\r\nmade to impeach a judge of the Supreme Court[1] and that attempt failed.\r\nStill further to insure their freedom from legislative control, the\r\nConstitution provides that the compensation of the judges shall not be\r\ndiminished during their continuance in office.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Justice Samuel Chase of Maryland in 1804-5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It is interesting to observe that this Court, safeguarded\r\nagainst popular clamor and composed of judges appointed for life, has\r\nconsistently shown itself more progressive and more responsive to modern\r\nideas than have most of the state Supreme Courts whose members are\r\nelected directly by the people and for limited terms only.]\r\n\r\nFrom the time of John Jay, the first Chief Justice, down to the present\r\nday the men appointed to membership in the Court have, for the most\r\npart, been lawyers of the highest character and standing, many of whom\r\nhad already won distinction in other branches of the public service.\r\nThe present Chief Justice (Taft) is an ex-President of the United\r\nStates. Among the other members of the Court are a former Secretary of\r\nState of the United States (Justice Day); two former Attorneys General\r\nof the United States (Justices McKenna and McReynolds); a former Chief\r\nJustice of Massachusetts (Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, the\r\ndistinguished son and namesake of an illustrious father); a former Chief\r\nJustice of Wyoming (Justice Van Devanter); and a former Chancellor of\r\nNew Jersey (Justice Pitney).\r\n\r\nIt is well that the personnel of the Court has been such as to command\r\nrespect and deference, for in actual power the judiciary is by far the\r\nweakest of the three coördinate departments (legislative, executive,\r\njudicial) among which the functions of government were distributed by\r\nthe Constitution. The power of the purse is vested in Congress: it alone\r\ncan levy taxes and make appropriations. The Executive is\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy and wields the appointing power.\r\nThe Supreme Court controls neither purse nor sword nor appointments to\r\noffice. Its power is moral rather than physical. It has no adequate\r\nmeans of enforcing its decrees without the coöperation of other\r\nbranches of the Government.\r\n\r\nThat coöperation has not always been forthcoming. In the year 1802,\r\nCongress, at the instigation of President Jefferson, the inveterate\r\nenemy of Chief Justice Marshall, suspended the sessions of the Court for\r\nmore than a year by abolishing the August term. In 1832, when the State\r\nof Georgia defied the decree of the Court in a case involving the status\r\nof the Cherokee Indians, the other departments of the Federal Government\r\ngave no aid and President Andrew Jackson is reported to have remarked:\r\n\"John Marshall has made the decision, now let him execute it.\" In 1868,\r\nCongress, in order to forestall decision in a case pending before the\r\nCourt, hastily repealed the statute on which the jurisdiction of the\r\nCourt depended.[1] Such instances, however, have been rare. The\r\nlaw-abiding instinct is strong in the American people, and for the most\r\npart the decisions of the Supreme Court have been received with respect\r\nand unquestioning obedience.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _ex parte McCardle_, 6 Wall. (Supreme Court Reports),\r\n318; 7 _id._, 506.]\r\n\r\nThe chief weapon in the arsenal of the Court is the power to declare\r\nlegislative acts void on the ground that they overstep limits\r\nestablished by the people in the Constitution. This power has been\r\nfrequently exercised. It is stated that the congressional statutes thus\r\nnullified have not numbered more than thirty, while at least a thousand\r\nstate laws have been nullified.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Brief of Solicitor General James M. Beck in the Child Labor\r\nTax cases. It is to be borne in mind that there are forty-eight state\r\nlegislatures and only one Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe assumption of this power in the Court to declare statutes\r\nunconstitutional has been bitterly assailed, and is still denounced in\r\nsome quarters, as judicial usurpation originated by John Marshall.\r\n\r\nOn the historical side this objection is not well founded. Various state\r\ncourts had exercised the power to declare statutes unconstitutional\r\nbefore the Supreme Court came into existence.[1] The framers of the\r\nConstitution clearly intended that such a power should be exercised by\r\nthe Supreme Court.[2] Moreover, a somewhat similar power appears to have\r\nbeen exercised long before in England,[3] though it gave place later to\r\nthe present doctrine of the legal omnipotence of Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Bryce: \"The American Commonwealth,\" Vol. I, p. 250.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See e.g., \"Federalist,\" No. LXXVIII.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See opinion of Lord Coke in Bonham's Case, 8 Coke's\r\nReports, 118, decided in 1610.]\r\n\r\nOn the side of reason and logic, the argument in favor of the power\r\nformulated more than a century ago by Chief Justice Marshall has never\r\nbeen adequately answered and is generally accepted as final. He said:[1]\r\n\r\n     The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and\r\n     that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the\r\n     Constitution is written. To what purpose are powers limited,\r\n     and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing,\r\n     if these limits may, at any time, be passed by those intended\r\n     to be restrained?... The Constitution is either a superior\r\n     paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means, or it is on a\r\n     level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other acts, is\r\n     alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it. If\r\n     the former part of the alternative be true, then a legislative\r\n     act, contrary to the Constitution, is not law: if the latter\r\n     part be true, then written constitutions are absurd attempts,\r\n     on the part of the people, to limit a power in its own nature\r\n     illimitable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Marbury v. Madison_, 1 Cranch, 176.]\r\n\r\nIt would seem at first blush that the power in the Court to declare\r\nlegislative acts unconstitutional affords a complete safeguard against\r\ncongressional encroachment on the prerogatives of the states. Such is\r\nnot the fact, however. The veto power of the Court by no means covers\r\nthe entire field of legislative activity. In the Convention which\r\nframed the Constitution, attempts were made to give to the judiciary, in\r\nconjunction with the executive, complete power of revision over\r\nlegislative acts, but all such propositions were voted down.[1] As\r\nmatters stand, there may be violations of the Constitution by Congress\r\n(or for that matter by the executive) of which the Court can take no\r\ncognizance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See e.g., Farrand: \"Records of the Federal Convention,\"\r\nVol. I, pp. 138 et seq.; Vol. II, p. 298.]\r\n\r\nFor one thing, the Court cannot deal with questions of a political\r\ncharacter. The function of the Court is judicial only. Upon this ground\r\nit was decided that the question which of two rival governments in the\r\nState of Rhode Island was the legitimate one was for the determination\r\nof the political department of government rather than the courts;[1]\r\nthat the question, whether the adoption by a state of the initiative and\r\nreferendum violated the provision of the Federal Constitution\r\nguaranteeing to every state a republican form of government, was\r\npolitical and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the Court.[2] In 1867\r\na sovereign state sought to enjoin the President of the United States\r\nfrom enforcing an act of Congress alleged to be unconstitutional. The\r\nSupreme Court, without determining the constitutionality of the act,\r\ndeclined to interfere with the exercise of the President's political\r\ndiscretion.[3] In the famous Dred Scott case[4] the effort of the\r\nSupreme Court to settle a political question accomplished nothing save\r\nto impair the influence and prestige of the Court.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Luther v. Borden_, 7 Howard, 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Pacific Telephone Co. v. Oregon_, 223 U.S., 118.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _State of Mississippi v. Andrew Johnson_, 4 Wall., 475.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Dred Scott v. Sandford_, 19 Howard, 393.]\r\n\r\nThe power of the Court to declare legislative acts unconstitutional is\r\nsubject to another important limitation. The judicial power is limited\r\nby the Constitution to actual cases and controversies between opposing\r\nparties. The Court cannot decide moot questions or act as an adviser for\r\nother departments of the government. A striking illustration is found in\r\nthe so-called Muskrat case.[1] Congress having legislated concerning the\r\ndistribution of property of the Cherokee Indians, and doubts having\r\narisen as to the constitutional validity of the legislation, Congress\r\npassed another act empowering one David Muskrat and other Cherokee\r\ncitizens to file suit, naming the United States as defendant, to settle\r\nthe question. The Supreme Court declined to take jurisdiction and\r\ndismissed the suit, holding that it was not a case or controversy\r\nbetween opposing parties within the meaning of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Muskrat v. United States_, 219 U.S., 346.]\r\n\r\nStill another limitation is encountered in cases involving abuse of\r\nlegislative power rather than lack of power. If Congress passes an act\r\nwithin one of the powers expressly conferred upon it by the\r\nConstitution, for example the power to lay taxes or the power to\r\nregulate interstate commerce, the Supreme Court cannot interfere though\r\nthe incidental effect and ulterior purpose of the legislation may be to\r\nintrude upon the field of state power. We shall have occasion to refer\r\nto this limitation more than once in later chapters.\r\n\r\nAn impression is abroad that the Supreme Court has plenary power to\r\npreserve the Constitution. Hence the tendency of groups to demand, and\r\nof legislators to enact, any kind of a law without regard to its\r\nconstitutional aspect, leaving that to be taken care of by the Court.\r\n\r\nAny such impression is erroneous and unfortunate. It puts upon the Court\r\na burden beyond its real powers. It undermines the sense of\r\nresponsibility which should exist among the elected representatives of\r\nthe people. It impairs what someone has called the constitutional\r\nconscience, and weakens the vigilance of the people in preserving their\r\nliberties. Men and women need to be reminded that the duty of upholding\r\nthe Constitution does not devolve upon the Supreme Court alone. It rests\r\nupon all departments of government and, in the last analysis, upon the\r\npeople themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nOUR CHANGING CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a celebrated case[1] decided a few years ago the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States said:\r\n\r\n     The Constitution is a written instrument. As such its meaning\r\n     does not alter. That which it meant when adopted it means now.\r\n     Being a grant of powers to a government its language is\r\n     general, and as changes come in social and political life it\r\n     embraces in its grasp all new conditions which are within the\r\n     scope of the powers in terms conferred. In other words, while\r\n     the powers granted do not change, they apply from generation\r\n     to generation to all things to which they are in their nature\r\n     applicable. This in no manner abridges the fact of its\r\n     changeless nature and meaning. Those things which are within\r\n     its grants of power, as those grants were understood when\r\n     made, are still within them, and those things not within them\r\n     remain still excluded....\r\n\r\n     To determine the extent of the grants of power we must,\r\n     therefore, place ourselves in the position of the men who\r\n     framed and adopted the Constitution, and inquire what they\r\n     must have understood to be the meaning and scope of those\r\n     grants.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _South Carolina v. United States_, 199 U.S., 437.]\r\n\r\nThus speaks the voice whose word is law.\r\n\r\nViewed in the sense intended--as the formulation of a legal rule for the\r\ninterpretation and construction of a written instrument--the statement\r\ncompels assent. As a statement of historical and political fact,\r\nhowever, it would not be accepted so readily. An acute critic of our\r\ninstitutions has said that the Constitution \"has changed in the spirit\r\nwith which men regard it, and therefore in its own spirit.\"[1] Men\r\nrealize that the words of the Constitution, like the words of Holy Writ,\r\nhave not always meant the same thing to those who regulate their conduct\r\nby its precepts; that the system of government which those words embody\r\nhas in reality changed, is changing to-day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Bryce: \"The American Commonwealth,\" Vol. I, p. 400.]\r\n\r\nThe makers of the Constitution represented the people of distinct and\r\nindependent states, jealous of their rights and of each other but\r\nnevertheless impelled by experience of danger lately past and sense of\r\nother perils impending to substitute for their loose and ill-working\r\nconfederation a more effective union. The most formidable obstacle,\r\napart from mutual jealousies, was a fear of loss of liberties, state and\r\nindividual, through encroachment of the central power. The instrument,\r\ndrawn with this fear uppermost, was designed to limit the National\r\nGovernment to \"the irreducible minimum of functions absolutely needed\r\nfor the national welfare.\"[1] To this end the powers granted were\r\nspecifically enumerated. All other powers were by express enactment[2]\r\n\"reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Bryce, \"The American Commonwealth,\" Vol. I, p. 324.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Tenth Amendment.]\r\n\r\nThe strength of the popular sentiment against any encroachment of\r\nfederal power was speedily demonstrated in a striking and dramatic way.\r\nUnder the grant of power to determine controversies \"between a state and\r\ncitizens of another state\"[1] the Supreme Court in 1793 proceeded to\r\nentertain a suit by one Chisholm, a citizen of South Carolina, against\r\nthe State of Georgia.[2] It had not been supposed that the grant of\r\npower contemplated such a suit against a state without its consent. The\r\ndecision aroused an indescribable state of popular fury, not only in\r\nGeorgia but throughout the Union, and led to the adoption of a\r\nconstitutional amendment[3] prohibiting such suits in future.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Art. III, Sec. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See 2 Dallas, 419.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Eleventh Amendment.]\r\n\r\nThere is a long step between such an attitude toward the Constitution\r\nand the viewpoint which finds in it authority for the enactment by\r\nCongress of White Slave and Child Labor laws. Obviously there has been a\r\nprofound change in what the Constitution means to its adherents. It will\r\nbe interesting to consider briefly what has caused the change of view,\r\nand how it has been put into effect.\r\n\r\nTo one searching for causes the most striking phenomenon is the growth\r\nof a national consciousness. At the outset it was practically\r\nnon-existent. To-day its power has astonished enemy and friend alike.\r\nIts growth has been due to both pressure from without and developments\r\nwithin. Our foreign wars, especially the war with Germany, have drawn\r\nthe people together and enhanced the importance of interests purely\r\nnational. Some of our other foreign relations have brought into relief\r\nthe advantages of a strong central government as well as certain\r\ninconveniences of our system as it left the hands of the framers.\r\nWitness the embarrassment toward Italy growing out of lack of federal\r\njurisdiction in respect of the New Orleans riots, and the ever-present\r\ndanger to our relations with Japan from acts of the sovereign State of\r\nCalifornia which the Federal Government is powerless to control. Among\r\ndevelopments from within was the Civil War, with its triumph for the\r\nidea of national supremacy and an indissoluble union. Another, which has\r\nhardly received the attention it deserves, has been the influence of the\r\nlarge element of our population composed of immigrants since the\r\nRevolution and their descendants. The state sovereignty doctrine was not\r\na mere political dogma but had its roots in history. It was an\r\nexpression of the pride of the inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies in\r\ntheir respective commonwealths. To them it stood for patriotism and\r\ntraditions. These feelings the later immigrant neither shared nor\r\nunderstood. When he gave up his Old World allegiance and emigrated he\r\ncame to America, not to New York or Massachusetts. To him the nation was\r\neverything, the state merely an administrative subdivision of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nAnother cause has been the desire to obtain aid in local matters from\r\nthe national treasury. This has proved an exceedingly potent and\r\ninsidious influence, leading state officials to surrender voluntarily\r\nstate prerogatives in exchange for appropriations of federal money.\r\nNotable examples of this influence may be found in the field of river\r\nand harbor improvements, the creation of various new bureaus in the\r\nDepartment of Commerce, the enormous extension of the activities of the\r\nAgricultural Department and the Bureau of Education. The temptation in\r\nthis direction is particularly strong among the less prosperous states,\r\nfor it means the expenditure in those states of federal moneys raised\r\nchiefly from the taxpayers in wealthier states.\r\n\r\nThe most potent influence of all, however, has been the matter of\r\ninternal economic development, stimulated by free trade among the\r\nstates. This development has gone on apace with little regard for state\r\nlines. The invention of railways drew the different sections of the\r\ncountry together in a common growth, and tended to make the barriers\r\ninterposed by state lines and state laws seem artificial and cumbersome.\r\nIn fact, they sometimes came to be regarded as intolerable and\r\ndestructive of progress. The spectacle of men clamoring for federal\r\ncontrol of their industries to escape the burdens of a diversified state\r\ninterference has been a frequent phenomenon of recent years.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See e.g. the efforts of the life insurance interests: _N.Y.\r\nLife Ins. Co. v. Deer Lodge County_, 231 U.S., 495.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing enumeration by no means covers all the forces which have\r\nbeen at work. In recent years a strong tendency toward centralization\r\nand combination has developed, a tendency pervading all the interests\r\nand activities of men. Moreover, new views have arisen concerning the\r\nfunctions and scope of government, views challenging the _laissez faire_\r\ndoctrines of earlier days and demanding a greater measure of\r\ngovernmental interference with the affairs of the individual. These\r\ntendencies, however, are not peculiar to America and lie outside the\r\nscope of the present discussion.\r\n\r\nIn considering the methods by which the change of spirit toward the\r\nConstitution has been put into effect, one is struck by the\r\ncomparatively small part played by the only method contemplated by the\r\nframers, viz., constitutional amendment. This method is entirely\r\npracticable and fairly expeditious provided a sufficient number favor\r\nthe change proposed. In the one hundred years prior to the recent Income\r\nTax Amendment, however, only three amendments were enacted (Numbers\r\nXIII, XIV, and XV), all of them dealing primarily with the abolition of\r\nslavery and the civil rights of the Negro. The only one which need be\r\nnoticed here is Number XIV, which substituted a federal test of\r\ncitizenship for state tests and provided that no state should \"deprive\r\nany person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;\r\nnor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of\r\nthe laws.\" There was nothing new in these prohibitions. In substance\r\nthey are as old as Magna Charta and were already embodied in most if not\r\nall of the state constitutions. The novelty lay in bringing the\r\nquestion, whether a state had in fact denied due process of law to an\r\nindividual or corporation, within the jurisdiction of the federal\r\ncourts. From a legal viewpoint this was a change of great importance. To\r\nthe general student of constitutional government, however, it is less\r\nsignificant than others presently to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nRight here it may be proper to notice a new theory of construction of\r\nthe Constitution, not yet accepted but strenuously urged and containing\r\nenormous potentialities. This is the \"doctrine of sovereign and inherent\r\npower,\" i.e., the doctrine that powers of national scope for whose\r\nexercise no express warrant is found in the Constitution are\r\nnevertheless to be implied as inherent in the very fact of sovereignty.\r\nThis is a very different thing from the famous doctrine of implied\r\npowers developed by Chief Justice Marshall--that all powers will be\r\nimplied which are suitable for carrying into effect any power expressly\r\ngranted. It is a favorite theory of what may be termed the Roosevelt\r\nschool. They consider that it is rendered necessary by the discovery of\r\nfields suitable for legislative cultivation, lying outside the domain of\r\nstate power but not within the scope of any express grant of power to\r\nthe nation. As practical men they abhor the existence of such a\r\nconstitutional no man's land as nature abhors a vacuum.\r\n\r\nDuring the presidency of Mr. Roosevelt a determined effort was made by\r\nthe representatives of the Administration[1] to secure the recognition\r\nby the Supreme Court of the doctrine of sovereign and inherent power. It\r\nwas claimed in the brief filed by the Attorney General and Solicitor\r\nGeneral that the doctrine had already been applied by the Court in the\r\nLegal Tender cases.[2] The effort failed, however, the Court declaring\r\nthat any such power, if necessary to the nation, must be conferred\r\nthrough constitutional amendment by the people, to whom all powers not\r\ngranted had been expressly reserved by the Tenth Amendment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In _Kansas v. Colorado_, 206 U.S., 46.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Bryce makes a statement to the same effect. \"The American\r\nCommonwealth,\" Vol. I, p. 383.]\r\n\r\nA method by which the federal power and jurisdiction have been much\r\nextended has been the occupation by Congress, through legislation of an\r\nexclusive character, of fields where the states had exercised a\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction. A familiar example is found in federal\r\nbankruptcy laws. Another and striking example is the so-called \"Carmack\r\nAmendment\" of the federal Interstate Commerce law. The question of\r\nliability for loss or damage to goods in the hands of railways and other\r\ncarriers had been a fruitful field for state legislatures and state\r\ncourts. The Carmack Amendment brushed away at a single stroke whole\r\nsystems of state statutes and judicial decisions (in so far as they\r\naffected traffic across state lines) and substituted a uniform system\r\nunder the control of the federal courts.\r\n\r\nThe federal power has also been extended at the expense of the states\r\nthrough the use of the treaty-making prerogative. The subjects upon\r\nwhich Congress may legislate are limited by specific enumeration. The\r\ntreaty-making power, however, is not thus limited. Treaties may cover\r\nany subject. It follows that while the Federal Government has no power\r\n(for example) to regulate the descent of real property in the various\r\nstates the treaty-making power permits it, by treaties with foreign\r\nnations, to destroy the alienage laws of the states.[1] Another very\r\nrecent example is afforded by the Migratory Bird Treaty with Great\r\nBritain.[2] One will search the Constitution in vain for any grant of\r\npower to the Federal Government to enact game laws. Nevertheless, under\r\nthis treaty, many state game laws have been practically annulled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Hauenstein v. Lynham_, 100 U.S., 483.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Sustained by the Supreme Court in _Missouri v. Holland_,\r\n252 U.S., 416.]\r\n\r\nBut the most far-reaching method by which federal power under the\r\nConstitution has been extended has been the adaptation--some will say\r\nthe perversion--by Congress of old grants of power to new ends. Under\r\nthe spur of public sentiment Congress has discovered new legislative\r\npossibilities in familiar clauses of the Constitution as one discovers\r\nnew beauties in a familiar landscape. The clause offering the greatest\r\npossibilities has been the so-called Commerce Clause, which grants to\r\nCongress power \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the\r\nseveral states.\"[1] Under this grant of power Congress has enacted, and\r\nthe courts have upheld, a great mass of social and economic legislation\r\nhaving to do only remotely with commerce. For example, the Sherman Act\r\nand other anti-trust legislation, ostensibly mere regulations of\r\ncommerce, but actually designed for the control and suppression of\r\ntrusts and monopolies; the federal Pure Food and Drugs Act, designed to\r\nprevent the adulteration or mis-branding of foods and drugs and check\r\nthe abuses of the patent-medicine industry;[2] the act for the\r\nsuppression of lotteries, making it a crime against the United States to\r\ncarry or send lottery tickets or advertisements across state lines;[3]\r\nan act to prevent the importation of prize-fight films.[4] These are\r\nonly a few among many similar statutes which might be mentioned. In all\r\nof them the motive is clear. There is no concealment about it. Their\r\nprimary object is to suppress or regulate the trusts, lotteries,\r\npatent-medicine frauds. The regulation of commerce is merely a matter of\r\nwords and legal form.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Art. I, Sec. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Hipolite Egg Company v. United States_, 220 U.S., 45.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Champion v. Ames_, 188 U.S., 321.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Weber v. Freed_, 239 U.S., 325.]\r\n\r\nEspecially noteworthy is the rapidly expanding body of social\r\nlegislation--federal Employers' Liability Act, Hours of Service acts,\r\nChild Labor Law, White Slave Act and the like, all drawn with an eye to\r\nthe commerce clause but designed to accomplish objects quite distinct\r\nfrom the regulation of commerce.\r\n\r\nAs already said, the Commerce Clause has been found most available for\r\npurposes of such legislation. Other clauses have, however, served their\r\nturn. For example, the grant of power to lay taxes was utilized to\r\ndestroy an extensive industry obnoxious to the dairy interests--the\r\nmanufacture of oleomargarine artificially colored to look like\r\nbutter.[1] Also to invade the police power of the States in respect of\r\nthe regulation of the sale and use of narcotic drugs.[2] Also to check\r\nspeculation and extortion in the sale of theatre tickets![3] The power\r\nto borrow money and create fiscal agencies was utilized to facilitate\r\nthe making of loans upon farm security at low rates of interest through\r\nthe incorporation of Federal land banks or Joint Stock land banks.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _McCray v. United States_, 195 U.S., 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Narcotic Drug Act. Held constitutional in _United States v.\r\nDoremus_, 249 U.S., 86; _Webb v. United States_, 249 U.S., 96.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Revenue Act of 1921, Title VIII, subdivisions 2 and 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Smith v. Kansas City Title Co._, 255 U.S., 180.]\r\n\r\nIt would be an insult to intelligence to claim that legislation such as\r\nthis, wearing the form of revenue measure or regulation of commerce but\r\nin reality enacted with a different motive, does not involve an enormous\r\nextension of the national power beyond what the makers of the\r\nConstitution supposed they were conferring or intended to confer. What,\r\nthen, of the declaration by the Supreme Court with which we began, that\r\n\"to determine the extent of the grants of power we must place ourselves\r\nin the position of the men who framed and adopted the Constitution, and\r\ninquire what they must have understood to be the meaning and scope of\r\nthese grants.\" The answer must be that the Court itself has not always\r\nadhered strictly to this test. The Court has taken the position that\r\nwhen power exists under the Constitution to legislate upon a given\r\nsubject--say interstate commerce or taxation--it is not for the\r\njudiciary to seek to correct abuses by Congress of that power, or to\r\nquestion Congressional motives. As said in the decision sustaining the\r\nconstitutionality of the oleomargarine law:[1]\r\n\r\n     The judiciary is without authority to avoid an act of Congress\r\n     lawfully exerting the taxing power, even in a case where to\r\n     the judicial mind it seems that Congress had, in putting such\r\n     power in motion, abused its lawful authority by levying a tax\r\n     which was unwise or oppressive, or the result of the\r\n     enforcement of which might be to indirectly affect subjects\r\n     not within the powers delegated to Congress, nor can the\r\n     judiciary inquire into the motive or purpose of Congress in\r\n     adopting a statute levying an excise tax within its\r\n     constitutional power.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _McCray v. United States_, 195 U.S., 27.]\r\n\r\nThe Court, however, has had great difficulty with these cases and\r\ndeveloped sharp differences of opinion. For example, the case upholding\r\nthe anti-lottery statute as a valid exercise of the power to regulate\r\ncommerce[1] was twice ordered for reargument and finally decided by a\r\nbare majority of 5 to 4. The Child Labor Law of 1916 was declared\r\nunconstitutional[2] and the Narcotic Drug Act was sustained[3] by a\r\nsimilar vote, 5 to 4. In the Narcotic Drug case the four dissenting\r\njustices, speaking through Chief Justice White, characterized portions\r\nof the statute as \"beyond the constitutional power of Congress to enact\r\n... a mere attempt by Congress to exert a power not delegated, that is,\r\nthe reserved police power of the states.\" In the Lottery case the\r\ndissenting opinion of the four, written by Chief Justice Fuller,\r\nconcludes:\r\n\r\n     I regard this decision as inconsistent with the views of the\r\n     framers of the Constitution, and of Marshall, its great\r\n     expounder. Our form of government may remain notwithstanding\r\n     legislation or decision, but, as long ago observed, it is with\r\n     governments, as with religions, the form may survive the\r\n     substance of the faith.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Champion v. Ames_, 188 U.S., 321.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Hammer v. Dagenhart_, 247 U.S., 251.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _United States v. Doremus_, 249 U.S., 86.]\r\n\r\nWhatever view one may hold to-day as to the question of expediency, no\r\nthoughtful mind can escape the conclusion that, in a very real and\r\npractical sense, the Constitution has changed. In a way change is\r\ninevitable to adapt it to the conditions of the new age. There is\r\ndanger, however, that in the process of change something may be lost;\r\nthat present-day impatience to obtain desired results by the shortest\r\nand most effective method may lead to the sacrifice of a principle of\r\nvital importance.\r\n\r\nThe men who framed the Constitution were well advised when they sought\r\nto preserve the integrity of the states as a barrier against the\r\naggressions and tyranny of the majority acting through a centralized\r\npower. The words \"state sovereignty\" acquired an odious significance in\r\nthe days of our civil struggle, but the idea for which they stand is\r\nnevertheless a precious one and represents what is probably America's\r\nmost valuable contribution to the science of government.\r\n\r\nWe shall do well not to forget the words of that staunch upholder of\r\nnational power and authority, Salmon P. Chase, speaking as Chief Justice\r\nof the Supreme Court in a famous case growing out of the Civil War:[1]\r\n\r\n     The preservation of the states, and the maintenance of their\r\n     governments, are as much within the design and care of the\r\n     Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the\r\n     maintenance of the National Government. The Constitution, in\r\n     all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union composed\r\n     of indestructible states.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Texas v. White_, 7 Wall., 700.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nCould Washington, Madison, and the other framers of the Federal\r\nConstitution revisit the earth in this year of grace 1922, it is likely\r\nthat nothing would bewilder them more than the recent Prohibition\r\nAmendment. Railways, steamships, the telegraph, the telephone,\r\nautomobiles, flying machines, submarines--all these developments of\r\nscience, unknown in their day, would fill them with amazement and\r\nadmiration. They would marvel at the story of the rise and downfall of\r\nthe German Empire; at the growth and present greatness of the Republic\r\nthey themselves had founded. None of these things, however, would seem\r\nto them to involve any essential change in the beliefs and purposes of\r\nmen as they had known them. The Prohibition Amendment, on the contrary,\r\nwould evidence to their minds the breaking down of a principle of\r\ngovernment which they had deemed axiomatic, the abandonment of a purpose\r\nwhich they had supposed immutable. As students of the science of\r\ngovernment they would realize that the most fundamental change which can\r\novertake a free people is a change in their frame of mind, for to that\r\neverything else must sooner or later conform.\r\n\r\nThe amendment was proposed by Congress in 1917 and proclaimed as having\r\nbeen ratified in 1919.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 40 Stat. 1050, 1941.]\r\n\r\nThe comparative ease and dispatch with which it was put through argue\r\nalike the skill and vigor of its sponsors and the strength of the\r\nsentiment behind them. Legal warfare over the amendment did not end,\r\nhowever, with its ratification by the legislatures of the requisite\r\nnumber of states. Passions had been aroused. Vast property interests\r\nwere menaced. Moreover, in the minds of students of government the\r\namendment stirred misgivings which were quite independent of the\r\nsentimental and material considerations involved. Eminent counsel were\r\nretained and a determined effort was made to defeat or nullify the\r\namendment in the courts. To this end suits were begun in various\r\njurisdictions to test its validity and enjoin the enforcement of the\r\nVolstead Act, which sought to carry it into effect. Two sovereign\r\nstates (Rhode Island and New Jersey) joined in the attack and through\r\ntheir respective Attorneys General brought original suits in the United\r\nStates Supreme Court to have the amendment declared invalid. Seven test\r\ncases were argued together in the Supreme Court, five days in all being\r\ndevoted to the argument. It will be of interest to note some of the\r\nreasons advanced against the validity of the amendment, as they are\r\nsummarized in the official report.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: National Prohibition cases, 253 U.S., 350.]\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island argued[1] that:\r\n\r\n     The amendment is an invasion of the sovereignty of the\r\n     complaining state and her people, not contemplated by the\r\n     amending clause of the Constitution. The amending power ... is\r\n     not a substantive power but a precautionary safeguard inserted\r\n     incidentally to insure the ends set forth in that instrument\r\n     against errors and oversights committed in its formation.\r\n     Amendments, as the term indeed implies, are to be limited to\r\n     the correction of such errors....\r\n\r\n     It is \"This Constitution\" that may be amended. \"This\r\n     Constitution\" is not a code of transient laws but a framework\r\n     of government and an embodiment of fundamental principles. By\r\n     an amendment, the identity or purpose of the instrument is\r\n     not to be changed; its defects may be cured, but \"This\r\n     Constitution\" must remain. It would be the greatest absurdity\r\n     to contend that there was a purpose to create a limited\r\n     government and at the same time to confer upon that government\r\n     a power to do away with its own limitations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Id., pp. 354-356.]\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General of the State of New Jersey:[1]\r\n\r\n     attacked the amendment as an invasion of state sovereignty not\r\n     authorized by the amending clause and as not, properly\r\n     speaking, an amendment, but legislation, revolutionary in\r\n     character.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 253 U.S., pp. 356-357.]\r\n\r\nThe eminent Chicago lawyer, Levy Mayer, and ex-Solicitor General William\r\nMarshall Bullitt, contended,[1] among other things, that\r\n\r\n     the power of \"amendment\" contained in Art. V does not\r\n     authorize the invasion of the sovereign powers expressly\r\n     reserved to the states and the people by the Ninth and Tenth\r\n     Amendments, except with the consent of _all_ the states....\r\n\r\n     If amendment under Art. V were unlimited, three-fourths of the\r\n     legislatures would have it in their power to establish a state\r\n     religion and prohibit free exercise of other religious\r\n     beliefs; to quarter a standing army in the houses of citizens;\r\n     to do away with trial by jury and republican form of\r\n     government; to repeal the provision for a president; and to\r\n     abolish this court and with it the whole judicial power\r\n     vested by the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Id., pp. 357-361.]\r\n\r\nElihu Root, preëminent as a constitutional lawyer, appeared as counsel\r\nin one of the test cases. His main contention was summarized in his\r\nbrief as follows:[1]\r\n\r\n     (a) That the authority to amend the Constitution is a\r\n     continuance of the constitution-making power and as such is a\r\n     power quite different and altogether distinct from the\r\n     law-making power under the Constitution.\r\n\r\n     (b) That a grant of the one power does not include or imply a\r\n     grant of the other.\r\n\r\n     (c) That the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used in\r\n     Article V of the Constitution [the article providing for\r\n     amendment] limits the power granted to the function of\r\n     constitution-making as distinguished from ordinary law-making.\r\n\r\n     (d) That the purposes of the grant imply the same limitation.\r\n\r\n     (e) That other parts of the Constitution--notably Article\r\n     I--express the same limitation.\r\n\r\n     (f) That the existence of authority under Article V to enact\r\n     ordinary laws regulating the conduct of private citizens under\r\n     color of amendment, would be so in conflict with the\r\n     fundamental principles and spirit of the Constitution that\r\n     such a construction is not permissible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For the Reporter's Summary see 253 U.S., pp. 361-367.]\r\n\r\nThere were other arguments of a more technical character. Article V of\r\nthe Constitution provides that the Congress shall propose amendments\r\n\"whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary.\" It was\r\nurged that this required the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the\r\nentire membership of both Houses, and that two-thirds of a quorum was\r\nnot sufficient. It was also urged that the proposal was fatally\r\ndefective because it did not on its face declare that both Houses deemed\r\nthe amendment necessary. It was also argued that the amendment had not\r\nbeen effectively ratified in certain of the states where it had been\r\napproved by the state legislature (notably Ohio) because under the\r\nconstitutions of those states it was subject to a referendum to the\r\npeople before becoming effective. The Supreme Court of Ohio had so\r\ndecided[1] and a referendum had actually been held in that state,\r\nresulting in a rejection of the amendment by popular vote. Various\r\narguments were also advanced based on the puzzling phraseology of\r\nSection 2 of the amendment that \"the Congress and the several States\r\nshall have _concurrent power_ to enforce this article by appropriate\r\nlegislation.\" The eminent constitutional lawyer, W.D. Guthrie, addressed\r\nhimself particularly to this phase of the controversy.[2] It was urged\r\nwith much force that the effect of these words was to save the rights of\r\nthe states, in respect of intrastate matters, by requiring their\r\nconcurrence in any legislation of Congress regulating such matters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _Hawke v. Smith_, 253 U.S., 221.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 253 U.S., pp. 368-380.]\r\n\r\nAll the arguments advanced were alike unavailing. The nine members of\r\nthe Supreme Court were unanimous in sustaining the validity of the\r\namendment, holding that it \"by lawful proposal and ratification, has\r\nbecome a part of the Constitution, and must be respected and given\r\neffect the same as other provisions of that instrument.\"[1] The Court,\r\nhowever, adopted the very unusual course of deciding the various cases\r\nbefore it (affirming four, reversing one, and dismissing the original\r\nbills filed by the states of Rhode Island and New Jersey) without any\r\nwritten opinion. Speaking through Mr. Justice Van Devanter, the Court\r\nmerely announced its conclusions. This was an unprecedented procedure in\r\na case involving constitutional questions of such importance. It drew\r\ncriticism from some of the members of the Court itself. Chief Justice\r\nWhite said:[2]\r\n\r\n     I profoundly regret that in a case of this magnitude,\r\n     affecting as it does an amendment to the Constitution dealing\r\n     with the powers and duties of the national and state\r\n     governments, and intimately concerning the welfare of the\r\n     whole people, the court has deemed it proper to state only\r\n     ultimate conclusions without an exposition of the reasoning by\r\n     which they have been reached.\r\n\r\nand proceeded to announce the reasons which had actuated him personally.\r\nJustice McKenna said:[3]\r\n\r\n     The court declares conclusions only, without giving any\r\n     reasons for them. The instance may be wise--establishing a\r\n     precedent now, hereafter wisely to be imitated. It will\r\n     undoubtedly decrease the literature of the court if it does\r\n     not increase lucidity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Id., p. 386.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Id., p. 388.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: 253 U.S., p. 393.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps a hint as to the reasons actuating the majority of the Court may\r\nbe found in the brief concurring memorandum of Mr. Justice McReynolds.\r\nHe said:[1]\r\n\r\n     I do not dissent from the disposition of these causes as\r\n     ordered by the Court, but confine my concurrence to that. It\r\n     is impossible now to say with fair certainty what construction\r\n     should be given to the Eighteenth Amendment. Because of the\r\n     bewilderment which it creates, a multitude of questions will\r\n     inevitably arise and demand solution here. In the\r\n     circumstances, I prefer to remain free to consider these\r\n     questions when they arrive.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Id., p. 392.]\r\n\r\nJustices McKenna and Clarke dissented from portions of the decision\r\ndealing with the question of the proper construction of the grant of\r\n\"concurrent power\" to Congress and the States, and wrote opinions\r\nsetting forth the grounds of their dissent. Both Justices, however,\r\nconcurred in affirming the validity of the amendment.\r\n\r\nThus the legal battle was fought and lost. The amendment had withstood\r\nattack and men's minds settled back to the practical question of its\r\nenforcement.\r\n\r\nUpon that question, however difficult and interesting, we do not here\r\nenter. Our present concern is to ascertain as nearly as may be the true\r\nplace of the amendment in the development of American constitutional\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThat it affords startling evidence of a radical departure from the views\r\nof the founders of the Republic is beyond question. Such a blow at the\r\nprerogatives of the states, such a step toward centralization, would\r\nhave been thought impossible by the men of 1787. It would be a mistake,\r\nhowever, to view the departure as having originated with this amendment.\r\nRather is the amendment to be regarded as merely a spectacular\r\nmanifestation of a change which was already well under way.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Republic the dominating purpose was the\r\nprotection of state prerogatives, so far as that was compatible with the\r\ncommon safety. The first eleven amendments of the Federal Constitution\r\nwere all limitations upon federal power. Not until the people of the\r\nvarious states had been drawn together and taught to think in terms of\r\nthe nation by a great Civil War was there any amendment which enlarged\r\nthe powers of the National Government. The three post-war amendments\r\n(Nos. XIII, XIV, and XV) marked a distinct expansion of federal power\r\nbut one that seemed to find its justification, as it found its origin,\r\nin the necessity for effectuating the purposes of the war and protecting\r\nthe newly enfranchised Negroes.\r\n\r\nA long period of seeming inactivity, more than forty years, elapsed\r\nbefore another constitutional amendment was adopted.[1] The inaction,\r\nhowever, was apparent rather than real. As matter of fact, a change was\r\nall the time going on. In a very real sense the Constitution was being\r\naltered almost from year to year. That the alterations did not take the\r\nshape of formal written amendments was largely due to the tradition of\r\nconstitutional immobility. The idea had grown up that the machinery of\r\namendment provided by the Fathers was so slow and cumbersome that it was\r\nimpossible as a practical matter to secure a change by that method\r\nexcept under stress of war or great popular excitement. That idea is now\r\nexploded. We of to-day know better, having seen the Income Tax Amendment\r\n(No. XVI), the Election of Senators by Popular Vote Amendment (No.\r\nXVII), the Prohibition Amendment (No. XVIII), and the Woman Suffrage\r\nAmendment (No. XIX) go through within a period of seven years. For\r\ngenerations, however, the tradition of constitutional immobility held\r\nsway and the forces of change worked through channels that seemed easier\r\nand less obstructed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: No. XVI, the Income Tax Amendment, ratified in 1913.]\r\n\r\nThe principal channel has been congressional legislation. Congress has\r\nfound ways of reaching by indirection objects which could not be\r\napproached directly. Under the express grants of power contained in the\r\nConstitution statutes have been enacted which were really designed to\r\naccomplish some ulterior object. A striking example is found in the\r\nchild labor laws, discussed more at length in a subsequent chapter.\r\nCongress at first sought to regulate child labor by a statute enacted\r\nostensibly as a regulation of commerce under the Commerce Clause of the\r\nConstitution. The Supreme Court held the Act unconstitutional as\r\nexceeding the commerce power of Congress and invading the powers\r\nreserved to the states.[1] Thereupon Congress practically reënacted it,\r\ncoupled with a provision for a prohibitive tax on the profits of\r\nconcerns employing child labor, as part of a revenue act enacted under\r\nthe constitutional grant of power to lay taxes.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Hammer v. Dagenhart_, 247 U.S., 251.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Revenue Act of 1918, Title XII.]\r\n\r\nThe assumption by the National Government of jurisdiction over the\r\nmanufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors is no more of an\r\nencroachment on the prerogatives of the states than is its assumption of\r\njurisdiction over child labor and the use of narcotic drugs. We come\r\nback, therefore, to the proposition that the Prohibition Amendment is to\r\nbe regarded less as a departure in American fundamental law than as a\r\nspectacular manifestation of a change already well under way.\r\n\r\nThe change, however much students of our institutions may deplore it, is\r\nnot difficult to explain. The earlier solicitude for state rights was in\r\na sense accidental. It was based on sentiment and mutual jealousies\r\namong the colonies rather than on any fundamental differences in race,\r\nbeliefs, or material interests. The traditions behind it, while strong,\r\nwere of comparatively recent growth. When they entered the Union the\r\ncolonies were still new and undeveloped. As men died and their sons\r\nsucceeded them prejudices gradually yielded and sentiment changed.\r\nMoreover, various other forces--immigration, free trade among the\r\nstates, the growth of railways and other nationwide industries, foreign\r\nwars--have been at work to obliterate state lines.\r\n\r\nAdvocates of the old order see in the change a breaking down of the\r\nprinciple of local self-government. To their minds the danger of\r\nmajority tyranny, made possible by a centralization of power in a\r\nrepublic of such vast extent and varied interests, outweighs all the\r\nadvantages of national uniformity and efficiency. Advocates of the new\r\norder think otherwise. They argue, moreover, that the states have become\r\ntoo great and populous to serve as units for purposes of home rule;\r\nthat their boundaries are for the most part artificial and correspond to\r\nno real distinctions in the ordinary life of men. They assert that the\r\ninstinct for local self-government remains as strong as it ever was, and\r\ninstance the resentment of New York City over interference from Albany.\r\n\r\nThe average man gives little thought to the constitutional aspect of the\r\ncontroversy. His interest in the prohibition movement is focused on\r\nother features which seem to him of more immediate concern. And yet, did\r\nhe but realize it, the constitutional aspect transcends all the others\r\nin its importance for the future welfare and happiness of himself, his\r\nchildren, and his country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nA prudent man touches the question of woman suffrage gingerly. Many\r\nfingers have been burnt in that fire and its embers are not yet dead.\r\nSome mention of the Nineteenth Amendment seems necessary, however, in\r\nany discussion of federal encroachment on state power, and it may be\r\npossible to approach the suffrage movement from the standpoint of\r\nconstitutional law without getting upon controversial ground.\r\n\r\nThe United States Constitution as originally adopted did not prescribe\r\nwho should be entitled to vote. That matter was left entirely in the\r\nhands of the states. The Constitution provided[1] that, for the election\r\nof members of the House of Representatives, \"the electors in each state\r\nshall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most\r\nnumerous branch of the state legislature.\" It was further provided that\r\nSenators should be chosen by the legislatures of the states[2] and that\r\nthe President and Vice-president should be chosen by presidential\r\nelectors appointed in such manner as the state legislatures might\r\ndirect.[3] These were the only elective federal officials.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Article I, Section 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Article I, Section 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Article II, Section 1.]\r\n\r\nWhile the states were thus left in full control, it does not follow that\r\nthe matter was deemed wholly outside the proper scope of national\r\nauthority. No argument is necessary to demonstrate that the regulation\r\nof the suffrage in national elections is or may be a matter of national\r\nconcern. The question of prescribing the qualifications of voters in\r\nsuch elections was much debated in the Convention which framed the\r\nConstitution.[1] Some members were in favor of prescribing a property\r\nqualification and limiting the suffrage to freeholders. It was finally\r\ndecided, however, to accept the qualifications prescribed by state law.\r\nIn adopting this plan the Convention followed the line of least\r\nresistance. The qualifications of voters in the various states\r\ndiffered.[2] Most states required a property qualification, but some\r\ndid not. It was felt that to attempt to impose a uniform rule on all the\r\nstates would arouse opposition and create one more obstacle to be\r\novercome in the formidable task of getting the Constitution ratified.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See e.g., Farrand, \"Records of the Federal Convention,\"\r\nVol. II, p. 201 et seq.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For a statement of the qualifications in the various states\r\nsee _Minor v. Happersett_, 21 Wall., 162.]\r\n\r\nThere the matter rested, with suffrage qualifications regulated entirely\r\nby state law, until after the Civil War. Meanwhile, the states had been\r\nabolishing property tests, and universal male suffrage had been written\r\ninto state constitutions. The cry for woman suffrage had begun, but as\r\nyet it was only a still small voice, inaudible to legislators.\r\n\r\nAfter the Civil War the problem of protecting the emancipated slaves had\r\nto be dealt with, and three constitutional amendments (Nos. XIII, XIV,\r\nand XV) were adopted with that end primarily in view. Number XIII,\r\nratified in 1865, formally abolished slavery. Number XIV, ratified in\r\n1868, extended citizenship to all persons born in the United States and\r\nprovided (among other things) that no state should abridge the\r\nprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States. Number XV,\r\nratified in 1870, provided that \"the right of citizens of the United\r\nStates to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or\r\nby any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of\r\nservitude.\" Here was the entering wedge of federal interference. The\r\namendments did not purport to deal with woman suffrage, but the pioneers\r\nof the suffrage movement thought they discovered in them a means of\r\nadvancing their cause and lost no time in putting the matter to the\r\ntest. Susan B. Anthony voted at Rochester, N.Y., in an election for a\r\nrepresentative in Congress, claiming that the restriction of voting to\r\nmales by the constitution and laws of New York was void as a violation\r\nof the Fourteenth Amendment providing that \"no state shall make or\r\nenforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of\r\ncitizens of the United States.\" She was indicted for voting unlawfully,\r\nand on her trial before Justice Hunt of the United States Supreme Court,\r\nsitting at Circuit, the Court directed the jury to find a verdict of\r\nguilty and imposed a fine of $100 and costs.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _United States v. Anthony_, 11 Blatchford, 200.]\r\n\r\nMrs. Virginia Minor raised a similar question in the courts of Missouri.\r\nThe Missouri constitution limited the right to vote to male citizens.\r\nMrs. Minor applied for registration as a voter, and on being refused\r\nbrought suit against the Registrar of Voters on the ground that this\r\nclause of the Missouri constitution was in violation of the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment. The Missouri state courts decided against her, and the case\r\nwas taken to the Supreme Court of the United States where the decision\r\nof the state courts was affirmed.[1] The Supreme Court held in effect\r\nthat while Mrs. Minor was a citizen that fact alone did not make her a\r\nvoter; that suffrage was not coextensive with citizenship, either when\r\nthe Constitution was adopted or at the date of the Fourteenth Amendment,\r\nand was not one of the \"privileges and immunities\" guaranteed by that\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Minor v. Happersett_, 21 Wall., 162.]\r\n\r\nA similar decision was rendered in the matter of Mrs. Myra Bradwell's\r\napplication for a license to practise law in Illinois.[1] The Supreme\r\nCourt held that the right to practise law in the state courts was not a\r\nprivilege or immunity of a citizen of the United States within the\r\nmeaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, and affirmed the decision of the\r\nIllinois Court denying Mrs. Bradwell's application.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Bradwell v. Illinois_, 16 Wall., 130.]\r\n\r\nThe failure of these attempts to turn the Fourteenth Amendment to the\r\nadvantage of the woman suffrage movement in no wise checked the\r\nmovement or discouraged its leaders. They redoubled their efforts among\r\nthe separate states, and worked to such good purpose that the opposition\r\npresently began to take on the aspect of a forlorn hope. \"Votes for\r\nWomen\" became an accomplished fact in many states, and appeared on the\r\nverge of accomplishment in most of the others. Some states, however,\r\nwere still holding out when the leaders of the movement, impatient of\r\nfurther delay and determined to coerce the recalcitrants, took the\r\nmatter into the national arena and procured the proposal and\r\nratification of an amendment to the Federal Constitution. The amendment\r\nprovides:\r\n\r\n     The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not\r\n     be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on\r\n     account of sex.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it adopts verbatim the phraseology of the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment, merely substituting the word \"sex\" for the words \"race,\r\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the historical background of the so-called Susan B. Anthony\r\nAmendment. It remains to consider just how far the amendment\r\nconstitutes an encroachment by the Federal Government on the powers of\r\nthe states.\r\n\r\nIn so far as it affects the qualifications of voters at national\r\nelections (i.e., for president, senators, representatives) the\r\nencroachment is more apparent than real. As has already been pointed\r\nout, this is essentially a national question, and the Constitution\r\nadopted the suffrage qualifications prescribed by state law, not as a\r\nmatter of principle, but for reasons of expediency and convenience.\r\n\r\nIn so far, however, as the amendment imposes woman suffrage on the\r\nstates in elections of state and local officials the situation is\r\nentirely different. That staunch advocate of national power, Alexander\r\nHamilton, said in the _Federalist_:[1]\r\n\r\n     Suppose an article had been introduced into the Constitution,\r\n     empowering the United States to regulate the elections for the\r\n     particular states, would any man have hesitated to condemn it,\r\n     both as an unwarrantable transposition of power, and as a\r\n     premeditated engine for the destruction of the state\r\n     governments?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Federalist_ LIX.]\r\n\r\nWhat Hamilton scouted as impossible has been accomplished in the\r\nNineteenth Amendment. It in effect strikes out the word \"male\" from the\r\nsuffrage provisions of state constitutions. It overrides state policy\r\nand interferes with the right of states to manage their own affairs.\r\nFrom the theoretical standpoint a more serious inroad on state\r\nprerogatives would be hard to find. Control of the suffrage is one of\r\nthe fundamental rights of a free state. It belonged to the North\r\nAmerican states before their union, and was not surrendered to the\r\nNational Government when the union was effected. Moreover, the\r\nencroachment has a very practical side. To confer the suffrage on the\r\neducated women of Connecticut was one thing; to confer it on the Negro\r\nwomen of Alabama was quite a different matter, involving different\r\nconsiderations. The amendment took no heed of such differences but\r\nimposed a uniform rule on all the states, regardless of local prejudices\r\nor conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is true that a somewhat similar encroachment on state power had been\r\nmade by the Fifteenth Amendment, designed to enfranchise the Negroes.\r\nThat amendment, however, had its origin in conditions growing out of the\r\nCivil War, and claimed its justification in the necessity for protecting\r\nthe freed slaves against hostile state action. It was avowedly an\r\nemergency measure, and the success with which it has been nullified in\r\nsome quarters testifies to the unwisdom of forcing such measures upon\r\nreluctant states.\r\n\r\nThe conditions surrounding the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment were\r\naltogether different. Few people take seriously the alleged analogy\r\nbetween the women and the slaves. The constitutional method--action\r\nthrough the separate states--was being pursued with signal success. The\r\nstates were rapidly falling in line. Most of them had already granted\r\nwoman suffrage or were ready to grant it. There was no overmastering\r\nneed for coercing the states that were not yet ready. An impartial\r\nstudent of the period will be apt to conclude that the Nineteenth\r\nAmendment was the product of impatience rather than necessity.\r\n\r\nSomeone may ask, \"What effect will the granting of votes to women have\r\non the problem of preserving the constitutional equilibrium?\" The\r\nultimate power lies with the voters, and the women with votes now equal\r\nor outnumber the men. What is the reaction of women voters likely to be\r\ntoward questions of political theory?\r\n\r\nOurs is a governmental scheme of extreme complexity. As with animal\r\norganisms so with political systems, the higher they rise in the scale\r\nof development the more complicated they tend to become. An absolute\r\nmonarchy is simplicity itself compared with our dual system. To maintain\r\nthe proper adjustment of such a machine requires intelligence of a high\r\norder. The machine will not run itself and male tinkers have abundantly\r\ndemonstrated that it is not fool-proof. But something more is required\r\nthan mere intelligence. There must be, at least among the leaders, an\r\ninstinct for governmental problems as distinguished from those of a\r\nmerely social or personal character; an ability to recognize and a\r\nwillingness to conform to underlying principles.\r\n\r\nHow will the women voters meet this test? Granting (what few will\r\ndispute) that their intelligence at least equals that of the men, will\r\nthey be as likely as men to look beyond the immediate social welfare\r\nproblem to the governmental principle at stake? Will an abstract\r\nproposition hold its own in their minds against a concrete appeal?\r\n\r\nWe do not attempt to answer these questions, but they contain food for\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nCONGRESS _versus_ THE SUPREME COURT--THE CHILD LABOR LAWS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present Federal Revenue Act is noteworthy in more aspects than its\r\ncomplexity and the disproportionate burden cast on possessors of great\r\nwealth. To students of our form of government it is particularly\r\ninteresting because of provisions[1] purporting to impose a tax on\r\nemployers of child labor, for these represent an attempt by Congress to\r\nnullify a decision of the Supreme Court and grasp a power belonging to\r\nthe states. The story of these provisions throws a flood of light on a\r\nmethod by which our Constitution is being changed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Revenue Act of 1921, Title XII.]\r\n\r\nThe evils of child labor have long engaged the attention of\r\nphilanthropists and lawmakers. In comparatively recent years child labor\r\nlaws are said to have been enacted in every state of the Union. These\r\nstatutes, however, lacked uniformity. Some of them were not stringent\r\nenough to satisfy modern sentiment. Moreover, commercial considerations\r\nentered into the reckoning. Industries in states where the laws were\r\nstringent were found to be at a disadvantage in comparison with like\r\nindustries in states where the laws were lax, and this came to be\r\nregarded as a species of unfair competition. The advantages of\r\nuniformity and standardization seemed obvious from both the\r\nphilanthropic and the commercial viewpoints, and Congress determined to\r\ntake a hand in the matter.\r\n\r\nNo well-informed person supposed for a moment that the regulation of\r\nchild labor was one of the functions of the General Government as those\r\nfunctions were planned by the makers of the Constitution. The United\r\nStates Supreme Court had declared over and over again that such matters\r\nwere the province of the states; that \"speaking generally, the police\r\npower is reserved to the states and there is no grant thereof to\r\nCongress in the Constitution.\"[1] For some years, however, Congress had\r\nbeen finding ways to legislate indirectly upon matters which it had no\r\npower to approach directly. Under the grant of power in the Constitution\r\n\"to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several\r\nStates,\"[2] Congress had enacted laws purporting to regulate commerce\r\nbut in reality designed for the suppression or regulation of some other\r\nform of activity. These enactments had for the most part been sustained\r\nas constitutional by the Supreme Court (though with misgivings and sharp\r\ndifferences of opinion), the Court holding that it could not pass on the\r\nmotives for congressional action. The enactment of a law regulating\r\nchild labor seemed therefore but another step along a trail already\r\nblazed, and Congress determined to take that step.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Keller v. United States_, 213 U.S., 138.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Art. I, Sec. 8.]\r\n\r\nThe statute enacted by Congress[1] prohibited transportation in\r\ninterstate commerce of goods made at a factory in which, within thirty\r\ndays prior to their removal therefrom, children under the age of\r\nfourteen years had been employed or permitted to work, or children\r\nbetween the ages of fourteen and sixteen had been employed or permitted\r\nto work more than eight hours in any day, or more than six days in any\r\nweek, or after the hour of 7 P.M. or before the hour of 6 A.M. The\r\nconstitutionality of the act was at once challenged and suit brought to\r\ntest the question. The Supreme Court held, by a vote of five to\r\nfour,[2] that Congress had overstepped its power. The previous decisions\r\nwhich had upheld somewhat similar inroads on the police power of the\r\nstates were distinguished and the act was declared unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Act of September 1, 1916, 39 Stat., 675.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Hammer v. Dagenhart_, 247 U.S., 251.]\r\n\r\nThe distinction drawn by the majority of the Court between this and\r\nprevious decisions was a narrow one and its validity has been questioned\r\nby some writers. It has nowhere been more clearly explained than in an\r\naddress delivered before a body of lawyers by a former member of the\r\nCourt.[1] Mr. Hughes said:\r\n\r\n     There has been in late years a series of cases sustaining the\r\n     regulation of interstate commerce, although the rules\r\n     established by Congress had the quality of police regulation.\r\n     This has been decided with respect to the interstate\r\n     transportation of lottery tickets, of impure food and drugs,\r\n     of misbranded articles, of intoxicating liquors, and of women\r\n     for the purpose of debauchery. It was held to be within the\r\n     power of Congress to keep \"the channels of interstate commerce\r\n     free from immoral and injurious uses.\" But the Court in this\r\n     most recent decision has pointed out that in each of these\r\n     cases \"the use of interstate commerce was necessary to the\r\n     accomplishment of harmful results.\" The Court, finding this\r\n     element to be wanting in the Child Labor Case, denied the\r\n     validity of the act of Congress. The Court found that the\r\n     goods shipped were of themselves harmless. They were permitted\r\n     to be freely shipped after thirty days from the time of\r\n     removal from the factory. The labor of production, it was\r\n     said, had been performed before transportation began and thus\r\n     before the goods became the subject of interstate commerce.\r\n\r\n     The fundamental proposition thus established is that the power\r\n     over interstate commerce is not an absolute power of\r\n     prohibition, but only one of regulation, and that the prior\r\n     decisions in which prohibitory rules had been sustained rested\r\n     upon the character of the particular subjects there involved.\r\n     It was held that the authority over interstate commerce was to\r\n     regulate such commerce and not to give Congress the power to\r\n     control the states in the exercise of their police power over\r\n     local trade and manufacture.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Charles E. Hughes, President's Address, Printed in Year\r\nBook of New York State Bar Association, Vol. XLII, p. 227 et seq.]\r\n\r\nCongress did not receive this decision of the Supreme Court\r\nsubmissively. On the contrary, plans were laid to nullify it. The effort\r\nto legislate on child labor under cover of the power to regulate\r\ncommerce having failed, recourse was had to the constitutional grant of\r\npower to lay taxes. Within six months after the decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt declaring the act unconstitutional was announced, another statute\r\nsimilar in purpose and effect was enacted as part of a Federal Revenue\r\nAct.[1] This act provided for an additional tax of ten per cent. of the\r\nnet profits received from the sale or distribution of the product of any\r\nestablishment in which children under the age of fourteen years had been\r\nemployed or permitted to work or children between the ages of fourteen\r\nand sixteen had been employed or permitted to work more than eight hours\r\nin any day or more than six days in any week or after the hour of 7 P.M.\r\nor before the hour of 6 A.M. during any portion of the taxable year. In\r\nother words, the law which had been declared void was substantially\r\nreënacted, with the substitution of a prohibitive tax for the clause\r\nprohibiting transportation in interstate commerce.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Revenue Act of 1918, Title XII.]\r\n\r\nThere was no pretense that this act was enacted for the purpose of\r\nraising revenue. The revenue feature was merely legislative camouflage.\r\nTo quote the words of Justice Holmes in a recent case,[1] \"Congress gave\r\nit the appearance of a taxing measure in order to give it a coating of\r\nconstitutionality.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _United States v. Jin Fuey Moy_, 241 U.S., 394.]\r\n\r\nThe debate in the Senate was highly illuminating.[1] Its sponsors\r\nadmitted that the measure was not expected or intended to produce\r\nrevenue but was designed to regulate child labor and nullify the\r\ndecision of the Supreme Court. Senators learned in the law conceded that\r\nif this purpose and effect were declared on the face of the act, or were\r\nnecessarily inferable from its provisions, it must inevitably be\r\ndeclared unconstitutional. Reliance was placed, however, on the facts\r\nthat the act was entitled \"A bill to raise revenue,\" and that its\r\nprovisions did not necessarily, on their face, belie this label. It was\r\nargued that the Supreme Court would be bound, under its own previous\r\nrulings, to treat the act as if it were what it purported on its face to\r\nbe--a revenue measure--and to ignore common knowledge and senatorial\r\nadmissions to the contrary. The measure passed the Senate by a\r\nsubstantial majority and was enacted as part of the revenue bill then\r\nunder consideration, from which it has been carried forward into the\r\npresent revenue law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See \"Congressional Record\" of December 18, 1918.]\r\n\r\nThere the matter stands at this writing. A District Court judge has\r\ndeclared the new act unconstitutional but the question has not yet been\r\npassed upon by the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nIt would be venturesome to attempt to predict what the Supreme Court\r\nwill do about it. Many constitutional lawyers seem to think that\r\nCongress has succeeded in its attempt and that the act will be\r\nsustained. Certainly there are strong precedents pointing that way.\r\nThree in particular will be relied upon--the Veazie Bank case, the\r\nOleomargarine case and the Narcotic Drug Act case.\r\n\r\nIn the Veazie Bank case[1] the Supreme Court upheld the validity of a\r\nso-called tax law whose purpose and effect were to suppress the\r\ncirculation of notes of the state banks. In the Oleomargarine case[2]\r\nthe Court upheld a tax whose purpose and effect were to suppress the\r\nmanufacture and sale of oleomargarine artificially colored to look like\r\nbutter. In the Narcotic Drug case[3] the Court upheld a tax imposed by\r\nthe so-called Harrison Act[4] whose purpose was to regulate the sale and\r\nuse of narcotic drugs. In each of these cases there could be no doubt in\r\nthe mind of any intelligent man as to the motive for the enactment. The\r\nCourt has uniformly maintained, however, that\r\n\r\n     when Congress acts within the limits of its constitutional\r\n     authority, it is not the province of the judicial branch of\r\n     the Government to question its motives.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Veazie Bank v. Fenno_, 8 Wall., 533, decided in 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _McCray v. United States_, 195 U.S., 27, decided in 1904.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _United States v. Doremus_, 249 U.S., 86, decided in 1919.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: 38 Stat., 785.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Smith v. Kansas City Title Company_, 255 U.S., 180, 210.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Narcotic Drug Act case[1] the Court held\r\n\r\n     While Congress may not exert authority which is wholly\r\n     reserved to the states, the power conferred by the\r\n     Constitution to levy excise taxes, uniform throughout the\r\n     United States, is to be exercised at the discretion of\r\n     Congress; and, where the provisions of the law enacted have\r\n     some reasonable relation to this power, the fact that they may\r\n     have been impelled by a motive, or may accomplish a purpose,\r\n     other than the raising of revenue, cannot invalidate them; nor\r\n     can the fact that they affect the conduct of a business which\r\n     is subject to regulation by the state police power.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _United States v. Doremus_, 249 U.S., 86.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that, while the Supreme Court may not question congressional\r\nmotives, it cannot escape the obligation to construe a statute in the\r\nlight of its true nature and effect. The Court has said:[1]\r\n\r\n     The direct and necessary result of a statute must be taken\r\n     into consideration when deciding as to its validity, even if\r\n     that result is not in so many words either enacted or\r\n     distinctly provided for. In whatever language a statute may be\r\n     framed, its purpose must be determined by its natural and\r\n     reasonable effect.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Collins v. New Hampshire_, 171 U.S., 30.]\r\n\r\nAs already indicated, however, the nature and effect of a statute must\r\nordinarily be determined from the form and contents of the act itself,\r\nrather than from outside sources, and the measure under consideration\r\npurports to be a revenue act.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the decisions and principles of interpretation to which\r\nreference has been made, the case against the constitutionality of the\r\nact may seem well-nigh hopeless. The fact remains, however, that\r\nCongress has not met the fundamental objection raised by the Supreme\r\nCourt. The Court declared the former act unconstitutional, not only\r\nbecause it transcended the power of Congress under the particular\r\nprovision of the Constitution then invoked, viz., the Commerce Clause,\r\nbut also on the broad ground of state rights, because it \"exerts a power\r\nas to a purely local matter to which the federal authority does not\r\nextend.\" It is difficult to see how this objection is obviated by\r\nreënacting the act as a revenue measure. Under the circumstances perhaps\r\nthe apprehensive foes of federal encroachment should withhold their\r\nlamentations until the Supreme Court has spoken again.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Since this chapter was put into print the Court has spoken.\r\nIn _Bailey v. The Drexel Furniture Co._ (decided May 15, 1922) the Child\r\nLabor Tax Law was pronounced unconstitutional. The Court, while\r\nconceding that it must interpret the intent and meaning of Congress from\r\nthe language of the act, held that the act on its face is an attempt to\r\nregulate matters of state concern by the use of a so-called tax as a\r\npenalty. The opinion of the Court, written by Chief Justice Taft, is an\r\nemphatic assertion of the duty and function of the Court to preserve the\r\nconstitutional equilibrium between nation and states.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nSTATE RIGHTS AND THE SUPREME COURT\r\n\r\n\r\nA century ago the United States Supreme Court was the bulwark of\r\nnational power against the assaults and pretensions of the states.\r\nTo-day it is the defender of the states against the encroachments of\r\nnational power. Let no one suppose, however, that this is because the\r\nCourt itself has faced about. On our revolving planet a ship may be\r\nsailing toward the sun at sunrise and away from the sun in the afternoon\r\nwithout having changed its course. The Supreme Court has been the most\r\nconsistent factor in our governmental scheme. While there have been\r\ndifferences of viewpoint between liberal constructionists and strict\r\nconstructionists among its members, the Court on the whole has steered a\r\nfairly straight course. What has really altered is the environment in\r\nwhich the Court moves. The earth has been turning on its axis. The frame\r\nof mind of the people who compose states and nation has changed.\r\n\r\nAt the outset (to cling for a moment to our nautical metaphor) the Court\r\nwas obliged to put forth on an unknown sea. Its sailing orders under the\r\nnew Constitution were unique. Precedents, those charts and lighthouses\r\nof the judicial mariner, were lacking. Progress was tentative and\r\ngroping. Little wonder therefore that at first the business of the Court\r\nwas meager and membership in its body seemed less attractive than\r\nmembership in the judiciary of a state. Robert Hanson Harrison, one of\r\nPresident Washington's original appointees to the Supreme bench,\r\ndeclined to serve, preferring to accept a state judicial office. John\r\nRutledge, another of the original appointees, resigned after a few\r\nmonths, preferring the position of Chancellor of his native state to\r\nwhich he had been chosen. John Jay, the first Chief Justice, resigned to\r\nbecome Governor of New York, and later declined a reappointment as Chief\r\nJustice in words indicating entire lack of faith in the powers and\r\nfuture of the Court.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the first period of the Court was by no means barren of\r\nachievement. A beginning was made. The supremacy of the national\r\nauthority under the new Constitution was asserted. So stoutly indeed was\r\nit maintained in the memorable case of _Chisholm v. Georgia_,[1] that\r\nthe country was thrown into a ferment. The Court had entertained a suit\r\nagainst a sovereign state by a private citizen of another state and\r\nrendered a decision in favor of the private citizen. The legislature of\r\nthe sovereign state concerned (Georgia) responded by a statute\r\ndenouncing the penalty of death against anyone who should presume to\r\nenforce any process upon the judgment within its jurisdiction. The\r\nmatter was taken up in Congress and resulted in the proposal, and\r\nsubsequent ratification by the states, of a constitutional amendment\r\ndesigned to prevent such actions in future.[2] It has been the fashion\r\nto speak of this incident as a striking example of the recall of\r\njudicial decisions. Such indeed it was. The decision did not suit the\r\npopular frame of mind and was promptly overruled in the method\r\nprescribed by the Constitution. It went a long way, however, toward\r\nestablishing the Supreme Court as a power to be reckoned with on the\r\nside of national supremacy and authority.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 2 Dallas, 419, decided in 1793.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Amendment XI.]\r\n\r\nThree years later the Court again took occasion to assert the national\r\nsupremacy in no uncertain fashion. The case was _Ware v. Hylton_[1] and\r\nthe Court laid down the proposition that a treaty of the Federal\r\nGovernment (in this case the treaty of peace with Great Britain)\r\nnullified previous state laws dealing with the subject matter. It is an\r\ninteresting circumstance that one of the counsel on the losing side in\r\nthis case was John Marshall of Virginia, and that this was the only case\r\nhe ever argued before the tribunal through which he was destined to play\r\nso momentous a part in history.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 3 Dallas, 199, decided in 1796.]\r\n\r\nIn the annals of the Supreme Court and the development of American\r\nconstitutional law the name of John Marshall stands preëminent. He was\r\nappointed Chief Justice by President John Adams, and took his seat on\r\nthe Bench at the beginning of the new century (February 4, 1801). He was\r\nwithout judicial experience, but his record in other fields of activity\r\nand his well-known Federalist principles pointed him out as a man to be\r\nreckoned with and explain the aversion with which he was viewed by\r\nThomas Jefferson, the incoming President. The breach between the\r\nPresident and the Chief Justice was widened by some of the early\r\ndecisions of the latter upholding the supremacy of the National\r\nGovernment and the powers of the Supreme Court, notably the famous case\r\nof _Marbury v. Madison_,[1] in which was asserted the power of the Court\r\nto declare an act of Congress void as in conflict with the Constitution.\r\nSome years elapsed, however, before a case was decided which squarely\r\ninvolved a conflict between the powers of the Federal Government and the\r\npowers of a state. The issue came up in the case of _United States v.\r\nJudge Peters_.[2] This case involved a conflict of jurisdiction between\r\nthe federal courts and the authorities of the State of Pennsylvania over\r\nthe distribution of some prize money. Marshall's decision was a strong\r\nassertion of the federal jurisdiction and power. The Governor of\r\nPennsylvania, under sanction of the state legislature, called out the\r\nstate militia to resist enforcement of the judgment of the Court.\r\nMatters were tense for a time and bloodshed seemed imminent but the\r\nstate finally backed down.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 1 Cranch, 137.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 5 Cranch, 115, decided in 1809.]\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1810) came the case of _Fletcher v. Peck_,[1] in\r\nwhich for the first time a statute of a state was held by the Supreme\r\nCourt to be void as repugnant to the Federal Constitution. The State of\r\nGeorgia had sought by statute to destroy rights in lands acquired under\r\na previous act. It was held that the statute was unconstitutional as\r\nimpairing the obligation of contracts within the meaning of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 6 Cranch, 87.]\r\n\r\nIn _Martin v. Hunter's Lessee_[1] was asserted the right of the Federal\r\nSupreme Court to overrule the judgment of a state court on questions\r\narising under the Federal Constitution. The State of Virginia had denied\r\nthat right and the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Virginia\r\nCourt of Appeals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 1 Wheat., 304 (1816.)]\r\n\r\nIn _McCulloch v. State of Maryland_,[1] a case involving an attempt by\r\nthe State of Maryland to tax the Bank of the United States, Marshall's\r\ndoctrine of implied powers was elaborated, and the judgment of the state\r\ncourt upholding the tax was reversed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 4 Wheat., 316 (1819).]\r\n\r\nIn the _Dartmouth College case_[1] the doctrine of the inviolability of\r\ncontracts against attack by state legislation was further developed. An\r\nact of the state legislature of New Hampshire had sought to alter the\r\ncharter of Dartmouth College, and the New Hampshire courts had upheld\r\nthe legislature. The Supreme Court reversed the state court and declared\r\nthe statute unconstitutional under the clause of the Constitution which\r\ndeclares that no state shall make any law impairing the obligation of\r\ncontracts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Dartmouth College v. Woodward_, 4 Wheat., 518 (1819).]\r\n\r\nIn the great case of _Gibbons v. Ogden_[1] the Court asserted the\r\nparamount jurisdiction of the National Government over interstate\r\ncommerce. This was one of the most important and far-reaching of all\r\nMarshall's decisions. An injunction had been granted by Chancellor Kent\r\nand unanimously sustained by the Court of Errors of New York,\r\nrestraining Gibbons from navigating the Hudson River by steamboats\r\nlicensed by Congress for the coasting trade on the ground that he was\r\nthereby infringing the exclusive right, granted by the legislature of\r\nNew York, to Robert R. Livingston and Robert Fulton to navigate the\r\nwaters of the state with vessels moved by steam. The Supreme Court\r\nreversed the state courts and held the New York legislation void as an\r\ninterference with the right of Congress, under the Constitution, to\r\nregulate interstate commerce.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 9 Wheat., 1 (1824).]\r\n\r\nThese were only a few of that series of great decisions which stand out\r\nlike mountain peaks on the horizon of our national life. Marshall's\r\njudgments transformed a governmental experiment into something assured\r\nand permanent. They confirmed the national supremacy and made the\r\nConstitution workable.\r\n\r\nMarshall is known to history for his work in vindicating the national\r\npower under the Constitution. That was the need in his day and he met it\r\nwith superlative wisdom and skill. It would be a mistake, however, to\r\nsuppose that he favored federal encroachment upon the powers reserved to\r\nthe states. On the contrary, he rendered decisions in favor of state\r\nrights which would be notable were they not overshadowed by the greater\r\nfame of the decisions which went to the building of the nation.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of Marshall and the accession of Taney as Chief Justice\r\na new chapter opened in the history of the Court. The Federalists had\r\nbecome extinct. Andrew Jackson had come into power and it had fallen to\r\nhis lot to fill a majority of the seats upon the bench by appointments\r\nto vacancies. The result was at once apparent. Two cases[1] involving\r\nimportant constitutional questions, which had been argued during\r\nMarshall's lifetime but assigned for reargument on account of a division\r\nin the Court, were now decided contrary to Marshall's known views and in\r\nfavor of a strict construction of national powers. Justice Story,\r\nMarshall's longtime associate on the bench, dissented strongly in both\r\ncases, lamenting the loss of Marshall's leadership and the change in the\r\nviewpoint of the Court.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mayor of New York v. Miln_, 11 Peters, 102; _Briscoe v.\r\nBank of Kentucky_, 11 Peters, 257, decided in 1837.]\r\n\r\nIt would serve no useful purpose to enter upon a detailed consideration\r\nof the various decisions upon constitutional questions made during the\r\ntwenty-eight years of Taney's Chief Justiceship. They were marked by\r\ngreat diversity of views among the members of the Court. In some of\r\nthem, notably the famous Passenger cases,[1] the Court fell into a state\r\nreminiscent of the confusion of tongues that arose at the building of\r\nthe Tower of Babel. The scope of certain of Marshall's decisions was\r\nlimited.[2] Upon the whole, however, the structure of constitutional law\r\nwhich Marshall had reared was not torn down or greatly impaired. The\r\nnational supremacy was upheld. Taney and his associates were for the\r\nmost part patriotic men and eminent lawyers, proud of the Court and its\r\nhistory and anxious to add to its prestige. It is regrettable that the\r\nmerits of some of them have been so obscured and their memory so clouded\r\nby a well-meaning but unfortunate excursion into the field of political\r\npassions. In the Dred Scott case[3] they thought to quiet agitation and\r\ncontribute to the peace of their country by passing judgment upon\r\ncertain angrily mooted questions of a political character. The effort\r\nwas a failure and brought upon their heads, and upon Chief Justice Taney\r\nin particular, an avalanche of misrepresentation and obloquy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 7 Howard, 283 (1849).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Not always for the worse: vide the Charles River Bridge\r\ncase, 11 Peters, 420, imposing salutary restrictions on the doctrine of\r\nthe Dartmouth College case.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Dred Scott v. Sandford_, 19 Howard, 393 (1857).]\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the Great Rebellion brought an enormous increase in\r\nthe national power and in the popular will to national power. State\r\nrights did not loom large in the popular or the legislative mind in\r\nreconstruction days. Taney was dead. The Supreme Court had been\r\npractically reconstituted by appointments made by President Lincoln and\r\nhis immediate successors and it seems to have been anticipated that the\r\nnew Court would take the view of national powers prevailing in Congress\r\nand the country at large. In this the popular expectation was doomed to\r\ndisappointment. The Court displayed an unexpected solicitude for the\r\nrights of the states and firmness against federal encroachment. Chief\r\nJustice Salmon P. Chase, who had been President Lincoln's war Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, went so far as to pronounce unconstitutional some of\r\nhis own official acts performed under the stress of war.\r\n\r\nIn the great case of _State of Texas v. White_[1] the rights of Texas as\r\na sovereign state were asserted, though Texas had joined in the\r\nRebellion and was not represented in the national legislature.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 7 Wall., 700 (1869).]\r\n\r\nIn _The Collector v. Day_[1] it was held that Congress had no power to\r\ntax the salary of a state official.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 11 Wall., 113 (1871).]\r\n\r\nIn the Slaughter House cases[1] an act of the Legislature of Louisiana,\r\ngranting to a corporation created by it exclusive rights to maintain\r\nslaughter houses for the City of New Orleans and other territory, was\r\nupheld, as a valid exercise of state police power, against claims that\r\nthe legislation violated rights secured under the newly adopted\r\namendments to the Federal Constitution (Amendments XIII, XIV, XV). The\r\nopinion of the Court delivered by a Northern judge (Miller of Iowa)\r\nstands as one of the bulwarks of state authority.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 16 Wall., 36 (1873).]\r\n\r\nIn a series of later cases various reconstruction acts of Congress\r\ninvolving encroachments upon state rights were either held\r\nunconstitutional or radically limited in their effect. For example, the\r\ndecision in _United States v. Cruikshank_[1] greatly limited the effect\r\nof the so-called Federal Enforcement Act. The decision in _United States\r\nv. Harris_[2] declared unconstitutional portions of an act of Congress\r\ndesigned for the suppression of activities of the Ku-Klux variety. In\r\nthe so-called Civil Rights cases[3] certain provisions of the federal\r\nCivil Rights Act, passed in furtherance of the purposes of the new\r\nconstitutional amendments and designed to secure to persons of color\r\nequal enjoyment of the privileges of inns, public conveyances, theatres,\r\netc., were held unconstitutional as an encroachment on the rights of the\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 92 U.S., 542 (1875).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 106 U.S., 629.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: 109 U.S., 3.]\r\n\r\nThese are but a few of the many decisions of the Supreme Court in the\r\nreconstruction period upholding the rights of the states against\r\nattempted federal encroachment arising from the conditions of the Civil\r\nWar. The nation owes a debt of gratitude to the men who composed the\r\nCourt at this time for their courage and firmness in the face of popular\r\nclamor and passion.\r\n\r\nThe solicitude of the Court for the rights of the states did not end\r\nwith the reconstruction period. It has continued down to the present\r\nday. In the Income Tax cases[1] the Court held that a tax upon income\r\nfrom bonds of a state municipal corporation was repugnant to the\r\nConstitution as a tax upon the borrowing power of the state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Pollock v. Farmers Loan & Trust Co._, 157 U.S., 429\r\n(1895).]\r\n\r\nIn _Keller v. United States_[1] the Court declared unconstitutional, as\r\nan encroachment on the police power of the states, an act of Congress\r\nmaking it a felony to harbor alien prostitutes, the Court declaring that\r\n\"speaking generally, the police power is reserved to the states and\r\nthere is no grant thereof to Congress in the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 213 U.S., 138 (1909).]\r\n\r\nIn the Child Labor case[1] the Court held the federal Child Labor Law\r\nof 1916 unconstitutional as invading the police power reserved to the\r\nstates. The Court said:\r\n\r\n     This Court has no more important function than that which\r\n     devolves upon it the obligation to preserve inviolate the\r\n     constitutional limitations upon the exercise of authority,\r\n     federal and state, to the end that each may continue to\r\n     discharge, harmoniously with the other, the duties entrusted\r\n     to it by the Constitution.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Hammer v. Dagenhart_, 247 U.S., 251 (1918).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: An even stronger assertion of state rights is found in the\r\nChild Labor Tax Case (_Bailey v. The Drexel Furniture Co._) decided May\r\n15, 1922, after this chapter had been put into print.]\r\n\r\nHow is it then, someone may ask, if the Supreme Court is so zealous in\r\ndefense of the rights of the states, that those rights are being\r\nencroached upon more and more by the National Government? The answer\r\nmust be that there has been a change in the popular frame of mind. The\r\ndesire for uniformity, standardization, efficiency, has outgrown the\r\nearlier fears of a centralization of power. Congress has found ways,\r\nunder the constitutional grants of power to lay taxes and regulate\r\ninterstate commerce, to legislate in furtherance of the popular demands.\r\nThe Court is not strong enough (no governmental agency which could be\r\ndevised would be strong enough) to hold back the flood or permanently\r\nthwart the popular will. In a government of the people everything has to\r\nyield sooner or later to the deliberate wish of the majority.\r\n\r\nSome profess to view the recent encroachments of federal power as a\r\ntriumph of the principles advocated by Alexander Hamilton and John\r\nMarshall over the principles of Thomas Jefferson. Such a claim does\r\nHamilton and Marshall an injustice. While they both stood for a strong\r\nNational Government, neither of them contemplated any encroachment by\r\nthat government on the principle of local self-government in local\r\nmatters or the police power of the states.\r\n\r\nMarshall in one of his most powerful and far-reaching pronouncements in\r\nsupport of the national supremacy[1] speaks of\r\n\r\n     that immense mass of legislation, which embraces everything\r\n     within the territory of a state not surrendered to the General\r\n     Government;... inspection laws, quarantine laws, health laws\r\n     of every description ... are component parts of this mass.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Gibbons v. Ogden_, 9 Wheat., 1, 203, 208.]\r\n\r\nLater in the same opinion he refers to\r\n\r\n     the acknowledged power of a state to regulate its police, its\r\n     domestic trade, and to govern its own citizens.\r\n\r\n     ... The power of regulating their own purely internal affairs\r\n     whether of trading or police.\r\n\r\nHamilton devotes an entire number of the _Federalist_[1] to combatting\r\nthe idea that the rights of the states are in danger of being invaded by\r\nthe General Government. In another place[2] he returns to the idea\r\n\r\n     that there is greater probability of encroachments by the\r\n     members upon the federal head, than by the federal head upon\r\n     the members\r\n\r\nand concludes that it is to be hoped that the people\r\n\r\n     will always take care to preserve the constitutional\r\n     equilibrium between the general and the state governments.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Federalist_, Number XVII.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Id., Number XXXI.]\r\n\r\nThat hope has failed of realization. The \"constitutional equilibrium\" of\r\nwhich Hamilton wrote is not being preserved. Some will say that this is\r\nan age of progress and we are improving upon Hamilton. Others, however,\r\nthink we are forgetting the wisdom of the Fathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERAL TAXING POWER AND THE INCOME TAX AMENDMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nHad the World War come five years earlier the United States would have\r\nbeen much handicapped and embarrassed in financing its share of the\r\nstruggle. One of the chief sources of national revenue during and since\r\nthe war, the income tax, would not have been available. The federal\r\nincome tax had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in\r\n1895, and it was not until eighteen years later that the obstacle\r\npointed out by that decision was removed through the adoption of an\r\namendment to the Constitution. The Sixteenth or Income Tax Amendment was\r\nproposed by Congress to the legislatures of the several states in 1909\r\nand took effect, having been ratified by three-fourths of the states, in\r\n1913. Declared by its sponsors at the outset to be intended merely as a\r\nrecourse in case of emergency, the tax authorized by the amendment was\r\nat once put into operation and there seems to be little likelihood that\r\nit will ever be abandoned.\r\n\r\nWithout the constitutional amendment no general income tax would be\r\npracticable. And yet the amendment conferred no new power of taxation on\r\nthe National Government. To explain this seeming paradox it will be\r\nnecessary to consider briefly the scope and limitations of the federal\r\ntaxing power.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief defects, perhaps the most vital defect of all, in the\r\nConfederation which carried through the Revolutionary War and preceded\r\nthe Union, was its inability to raise revenue directly by taxation. The\r\nConfederation was obliged to call upon the several states to furnish\r\ntheir respective contributions or quotas, and requisitions upon the\r\nstates encountered delays and sometimes were ignored altogether. There\r\nwere no effective means of compulsion.\r\n\r\nWith these facts before them the founders of the Union determined that\r\nthe new government should not be wrecked upon this rock at any rate, and\r\ntherefore insisted, against great opposition, in conferring upon it\r\npowers of taxation which were practically unlimited in their reach. The\r\nConstitution was made to provide that[1]\r\n\r\n     the Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes,\r\n     duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for\r\n     the common defense and general welfare of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Const., Art. I, Sec. 8, Clause 1.]\r\n\r\nThe only tax which Congress was expressly forbidden to lay was a tax on\r\nexports.[1] It was, however, provided that indirect taxes (duties,\r\nimposts, and excises) should be uniform throughout the United States,[2]\r\nand that direct taxes should be apportioned among the states according\r\nto population.[3] The last mentioned provision was a concession to the\r\nfears of the wealthier states lest their citizens be taxed unduly for\r\nthe benefit of the poorer states, and represented one of the great\r\ncompromises by which the ratification of the Constitution as a whole was\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Const., Art. I, Sec. 9, Clause 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Id., Art. I, Sec. 8, Clause 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Id., Art. I, Sec. 2, Clause 3. Sec. 9, Clause 4.]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution nowhere specified just what taxes were to be deemed\r\n\"direct\" (Madison in his notes of the Constitutional Convention records:\r\n\"Mr. King asked what was the precise meaning of direct taxation? No one\r\nanswd.\")[1] or what kind of uniformity was intended by the provision\r\nthat indirect taxes should be uniform, and more than a century was to\r\nelapse before either of these fundamental questions was finally\r\nsettled. The answer to the latter question (that the term \"uniform\"\r\nrefers purely to a geographical uniformity and is synonymous with the\r\nexpression \"to operate generally throughout the United States\") was\r\ngiven by the Supreme Court in the year 1900 in the celebrated case of\r\n_Knowlton v. Moore_,[2] and met with general approval. The answer to the\r\nquestion of what constitutes a direct tax within the meaning of the\r\nConstitution, given by the Supreme Court in 1895 in the Income Tax\r\ncases,[3] met with a different reception. The decision upset\r\nlong-settled ideas, disarranged the federal taxing system, aroused\r\npopular resentment, and ultimately led to the enactment of the Sixteenth\r\nAmendment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Farrand, \"Records of the Federal Convention,\" Vol. II, p.\r\n350.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 178 U.S., 41.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Pollock v. Farmers Loan & Trust Co._, 157 U.S., 429.]\r\n\r\nThe question had arisen early in the life of the Republic in the case of\r\n_Hylton v. United States_, decided in 1796.[1] This litigation involved\r\nthe validity of a tax on carriages which had been imposed by Congress\r\nwithout apportionment among the states. Alexander Hamilton argued the\r\ncase before the Supreme Court in support of the tax. The Court adopted\r\nhis view and sustained the tax, holding that it was a tax on consumption\r\nand therefore a species of excise or duty. The Justices who wrote\r\nopinions expressed doubt whether anything but poll taxes and taxes on\r\nland were \"direct\" within the meaning of the Constitution. That point,\r\nhowever, was not necessarily involved and was not decided, though later\r\ngenerations came to assume that it had been decided.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 3 Dallas, 171.]\r\n\r\nThe tax on carriages was soon repealed and many years elapsed before the\r\nquestion came up again. After the Civil War broke out, however, the need\r\nof revenue became acute and various statutes taxing income without\r\napportionment among the states were enacted by Congress. These met with\r\ngeneral acquiescence. It was felt that they were emergency measures\r\nnecessitated by the war, and they were in fact abandoned as soon as\r\npracticable after the war. A well-known lawyer, however (William M.\r\nSpringer of Illinois), did not acquiesce and refused to pay his income\r\ntax, on the ground that it was a direct tax not levied in accordance\r\nwith the Constitution. In the action brought to test the question[1] it\r\nappeared that the income on which Mr. Springer had been taxed was\r\nderived in part from the practice of his profession as an attorney. To\r\nthis extent it was clearly an excise or duty, i.e., an indirect tax. As\r\nit was incumbent upon Mr. Springer, by reason of the form of the action,\r\nto demonstrate that the tax was void _in toto_ the Court could not do\r\notherwise than decide against him. In rendering its decision, however,\r\nthe Court took occasion to discuss the question as to what were direct\r\ntaxes within the meaning of the Constitution, and expressed the view\r\nthat the term included only capitation or poll taxes, and taxes on real\r\nestate. There the matter rested until the year 1894 when Congress\r\nenacted another income tax law. This time the argument from necessity\r\nwas lacking. The country was in a state of profound peace. Opposition to\r\nthe tax among the moneyed interests was widespread. Test suits were\r\nbrought and after most elaborate and exhaustive argument and reargument\r\nthe Hylton and Springer cases were distinguished and the act was held\r\nunconstitutional.[2] The decision was by a closely divided Court (five\r\nto four), the majority finally holding that \"direct taxes\" within the\r\nmeaning of the Constitution included taxes on personal property and the\r\nincome of personal property, as well as taxes on real estate and the\r\nrents or income of real estate. This conclusion was fatal to the act. It\r\nwas conceded that the tax, in so far as it affected income derived from\r\na business or profession, was an indirect tax and therefore valid\r\nwithout apportionment among the states, but the provisions for taxing\r\nthe income of real and personal property were held to be an essential\r\npart of the taxing scheme invalidating the whole statute.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Springer v. United States_, 102 U.S., 586.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Pollock v. Farmers Loan & Trust Co._, 157 U.S., 429; same\r\ncase on rehearing, 158 U.S., 601.]\r\n\r\nThis momentous decision was almost as unpopular with Congress and the\r\ngeneral public as the decision in _Chisholm v. Georgia_ had been a\r\nhundred years earlier. Many legislators were in favor of enacting\r\nanother income tax law forthwith and endeavoring to coerce the Court,\r\nthrough the force of legislative and popular opinion, to overrule its\r\ndecision. Calmer counsels prevailed, however, and plans were initiated\r\nto get over the difficulty by a constitutional amendment. Meanwhile,\r\nsteps were taken to eke out the national revenue by various excise\r\ntaxes, notably the so-called Federal Corporation Tax. This novel tax,\r\nwhich was thought by many to involve a very serious encroachment by the\r\nFederal Government on the powers of the states, will be discussed more\r\nat length in later chapters.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Chapters X and XI, infra.]\r\n\r\nThe constitutional amendment as proposed by Congress and ratified by the\r\nstates provided:\r\n\r\n\"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from\r\nwhatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states,\r\nand without regard to any census or enumeration.\"\r\n\r\nThus far we have dealt only with such limitations upon the federal\r\ntaxing power as are expressly imposed by the Constitution. As has been\r\nseen, the only express limitations are that direct taxes shall be\r\napportioned among the states, that indirect taxes shall be uniform, and\r\nthat exports shall not be taxed at all. There are, however, certain\r\nother limitations which we proceed to notice briefly.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides[1] that the compensation of federal judges\r\n\"shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\" There is a\r\nsimilar provision as to the compensation of the President.[2] No attempt\r\nseems to have been made to tax the compensation of federal judges prior\r\nto 1862. A statute of that year subjected the salaries of all civil\r\nofficers of the United States to an income tax and was construed by the\r\nrevenue officers as including the compensation of the President and the\r\njudges. Chief Justice Taney, the head of the judiciary, wrote the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury a letter[3] protesting against the tax as a\r\nvirtual diminution of judicial compensation in violation of the\r\nconstitutional provision. No heed was paid to the protest at the time\r\nbut some years later, upon the strength of an opinion by Attorney\r\nGeneral Hoar, the tax on the compensation of the President and the\r\njudges was discontinued and the amounts theretofore collected were\r\nrefunded. There the matter rested until after the Income Tax Amendment,\r\nwhen Congress again sought to impose a tax upon the income of the\r\nPresident and the judges. A federal judge of a Kentucky district\r\ncontested the tax and the question came up before the Supreme Court for\r\nfinal decision. On behalf of the revenue department it was urged that a\r\ngeneral income tax, operating alike on all classes, did not involve any\r\nviolation of the constitutional provision. It was also contended that\r\nsuch a tax was expressly authorized by the Sixteenth Amendment giving\r\nCongress power to tax incomes \"from whatever source derived.\" The Court\r\nin an exhaustive opinion[4] overruled both these contentions and held\r\nthe tax to be a violation of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Art. 3, Sec. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Art. 2, Sec. 1, Clause 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See 157 U.S., 701.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Evans v. Gore_, 253 U.S., 245.]\r\n\r\nIt has often been asserted that a limitation of the federal taxing power\r\nis found in the \"due process\" clause of the Fifth Amendment of the\r\nConstitution, providing that no person shall \"be deprived of life,\r\nliberty, or property without due process of law.\" This amendment relates\r\nto the powers of the General Government. A similar limitation on the\r\npowers of the states is found in the Fourteenth Amendment. Taxing laws\r\nhave frequently been attacked in the courts on the ground that, by\r\nreason of some inequality or injustice in their provisions, the taxpayer\r\nwas deprived of his property without due process of law. In cases\r\ninvolving state laws such objections have sometimes been sustained.[1]\r\nThere seems, however, to have been no case in which a federal taxing law\r\nwas declared invalid on this ground, and the Supreme Court has recently\r\nremarked that it is \"well settled that such clause (viz., the due\r\nprocess clause of the Fifth Amendment) is not a limitation upon the\r\ntaxing power conferred upon Congress by the Constitution.\"[2]\r\nNevertheless, it is believed that if a federal tax were clearly imposed\r\nfor other than a public use, or were imposed on tangible property lying\r\noutside the national jurisdiction, or were so arbitrary and without\r\nbasis for classification as to amount to confiscation, relief might be\r\nobtained under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See, e.g., _Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright_, 249 U.S., 275.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Brushaber v. Union Pacific R.R._, 240 U.S., 24.]\r\n\r\nBy far the most important and interesting of the implied limitations of\r\nthe federal taxing power remains to be noticed. That is the limitation\r\nwhich prohibits the National Government from burdening by taxation the\r\nproperty or revenues or obligations of a state, or the emoluments of a\r\nstate official, or anything connected with the exercise by a state of\r\none of its governmental functions. In other words, while the National\r\nGovernment may tax income from bonds issued by England or France or\r\ntheir cities, it is powerless to tax the income from bonds of Rhode\r\nIsland or the smallest of its towns.\r\n\r\nThis implied limitation, nowhere categorically expressed but enunciated\r\nin a series of decisions of the Supreme Court, has not always met with\r\nacquiescence from the executive and legislative branches of the\r\nGovernment. In fact, Congress is now engaged in an effort to do away\r\nwith it, at least in so far as concerns the right to tax the income from\r\nstate and municipal bonds. To-day, however, it still stands as one of\r\nthe most striking and unique characteristics of our governmental system.\r\nIt will be discussed more at length in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nCAN CONGRESS TAX THE INCOME FROM STATE AND MUNICIPAL BONDS?\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is a question which is agitating a good many people just now.\r\nCongress from time to time has seemed disposed to try it, in spite of\r\nmisgivings as to the constitutionality of such legislation.[1] A recent\r\nRevenue Bill contained provisions taxing the income of future issues of\r\nsuch obligations, and a motion for the elimination of those provisions\r\nwas defeated in the House 132 to 61. Meanwhile, protests were pouring in\r\nfrom state and municipal officers assailing the justice and expediency\r\nof such a tax.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See, e.g., H. Report No. 767, 65th Cong., 2d Sess.,\r\naccompanying House Revenue Bill of 1918 as reported by Mr. Kitchin from\r\nthe Committee on Ways and Means, page 89.]\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this chapter to discuss the questions of\r\njustice and expediency (as to which there is much to be said on both\r\nsides) but rather to deal with the strictly legal aspects of the matter\r\nand indicate briefly why such a tax cannot be laid without a change in\r\nour fundamental law.\r\n\r\nLet it be said at the outset that no express provision of the United\r\nStates Constitution forbids. On the contrary, that instrument confers on\r\nCongress the power to lay taxes without any restriction or limitation\r\nsave that exports shall not be taxed, that duties, imposts, and excises\r\nshall be uniform throughout the United States, and that direct taxes\r\nmust be apportioned among the states in proportion to population. The\r\nobstacle lies rather in an implied limitation inherent in our dual\r\nsystem of government and formulated in decisions of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThe founders of this republic established a form of government wherein\r\nthe states, though subordinate to the Federal Government in all matters\r\nwithin its jurisdiction, nevertheless remained distinct bodies politic,\r\neach one supreme in its own sphere. In the famous phrase of Salmon P.\r\nChase, pronouncing judgment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court[1]:\r\n\r\n     The Constitution in all its provisions looks to an\r\n     indestructible Union, composed of indestructible states.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Texas v. White_, 7 Wall., 700, 725.]\r\n\r\nIn a later case[1] another eminent justice (Samuel Nelson of New York)\r\nput the matter thus:\r\n\r\n     The General Government, and the states, although both exist\r\n     within the same territorial limits, are separate and distinct\r\n     sovereignties, acting separately and independently of each\r\n     other, within their respective spheres. The former, in its\r\n     appropriate sphere, is supreme; but the states within the\r\n     limits of their powers not granted, or, in the language of the\r\n     10th Amendment, \"reserved\", are as independent of the General\r\n     Government as that government within its sphere is independent\r\n     of the states.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _The Collector v. Day_, 11 Wall., 113, 124.]\r\n\r\nIt follows that the two governments, national and state, must each\r\nexercise its powers so as not to interfere with the free and full\r\nexercise by the other of its powers. To do otherwise would be contrary\r\nto the fundamental compact embodied in the Constitution--in other words,\r\nit would be _unconstitutional_.\r\n\r\nThis proposition was affirmed at an early day by Chief Justice John\r\nMarshall in the great case of _McCulloch vs. The State of Maryland_,[1]\r\nwhich involved the attempt of a state to tax the operations of a\r\nnational bank. That case is one of the landmarks of American\r\nconstitutional law. While it did not expressly decide that the Federal\r\nGovernment could not tax a state instrumentality but only the converse,\r\ni.e., that a state could not tax an instrumentality of the nation, the\r\nCourt has held in many subsequent decisions that the proposition\r\nenunciated by the great Chief Justice works both ways. For example, it\r\nhas declared that a state cannot tax the obligations of the United\r\nStates because such a tax operates upon the power of the Federal\r\nGovernment to borrow money[2] and conversely, that Congress cannot tax\r\nthe obligations of a state for the same reason;[3] that a state cannot\r\ntax the emoluments of an official of the United States[4] and\r\nconversely, that the United States cannot tax the salary of a state\r\nofficial;[5] that a state cannot impose a tax on the property or\r\nrevenues of the United States[6] and conversely, that Congress cannot\r\ntax the property or revenues of a state or a municipality thereof.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 4 Wheaton, 316.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Weston v. City of Charleston_, 2 Pet., 449.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mercantile Bank v. New York_, 121 U.S., 138, 162.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Dobbins v. Commissioner of Erie County_, 16 Pet., 435.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Collector v. Day_, 11 Wall., 113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Van Brocklin v. Tennessee_, 117 U.S., 151.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _United States v. Railroad Co._, 17 Wall., 322.]\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has said (and many times reiterated in substance) that\r\nthe National Government \"cannot exercise its power of taxation so as to\r\ndestroy the state governments, or embarrass their lawful action.\"[1] One\r\nof the most distinguished writers on American Constitutional law\r\n(Thomas M. Cooley, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Michigan and\r\nafterward Chairman of the federal Interstate Commerce Commission) has\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     There is nothing in the Constitution which can be made to\r\n     admit of any interference by Congress with the secure\r\n     existence of any state authority within its lawful bounds. And\r\n     any such interference by the indirect means of taxation is\r\n     quite as much beyond the power of the national legislature as\r\n     if the interference were direct and extreme.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Railroad Co. v. Peniston_, 18 Wall., 5, 30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Cooley's Constitutional Limitations_, 7th Ed., 684.]\r\n\r\nThe question as to the right of Congress to levy an income tax on\r\nmunicipal securities came up squarely in the famous Income Tax Cases[1]\r\ninvolving the constitutionality of the Income Tax Law of 1804. While the\r\nSupreme Court was sharply divided as to the constitutionality of other\r\nfeatures of the law, it was unanimous as to the lack of authority in the\r\nUnited States to tax the interest on municipal bonds.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Pollock v. Farmers Loan & Trust Co._, 157 U.S., 429; same\r\ncase on rehearing, 158 U.S., 601.]\r\n\r\nThe decision in those cases is the law to-day (except in so far as it\r\nhas been changed by the recent Sixteenth Amendment) with one possible\r\nlimitation. It has been held that state agencies and instrumentalities,\r\nin order to be exempt from national taxation, must be of a strictly\r\ngovernmental character; the exemption does not extend to agencies and\r\ninstrumentalities used by the state in carrying on an ordinary private\r\nbusiness. This was decided in the South Carolina Dispensary case.[1] The\r\nState of South Carolina had taken over the business of selling liquor\r\nand the case involved a federal tax upon such business. The Court, while\r\nreaffirming the general doctrine, nevertheless upheld the tax on the\r\nground that the business was not of a strictly governmental character.\r\nThis decision suggests the possibility that if an attempt were made to\r\ntax state and municipal bonds the Court might draw a distinction based\r\non the purpose for which the bonds were issued, and hold that only such\r\nas were issued for strictly governmental purposes were exempt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _South Carolina v. United States_, 199 U.S., 437, decided\r\nin 1905.]\r\n\r\nIt remains to consider the effect of the Sixteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nAfter the Supreme Court had held the Income Tax Law of 1894\r\nunconstitutional on the ground that it was a direct tax and had not been\r\napportioned among the states in proportion to population the Sixteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution was proposed and ratified. This amendment\r\nprovides that\r\n\r\n     the Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on\r\n     incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment\r\n     among the several states, and without regard to any census or\r\n     enumeration.\r\n\r\nWhen the amendment was submitted to the states for approval some lawyers\r\napprehended that the words \"incomes from whatever source derived\" might\r\nopen the door to the taxation by the Government of income from state and\r\nmunicipal bonds. Charles E. Hughes, then Governor of New York, sent a\r\nspecial message to the Legislature opposing ratification of the\r\namendment on this ground.\r\n\r\nOther lawyers, notably Senator Elihu Root, took a different view of the\r\nscope of the amendment, holding that it would not enlarge the taxing\r\npower but merely remove the obstacle found by the Supreme Court to the\r\nIncome Tax Law of 1894, i.e., the necessity of apportionment among the\r\nstates in proportion to population. This latter view has now been\r\nconfirmed by the Supreme Court. In a case involving a tax on income from\r\nexports the Court said:[1]\r\n\r\n     The Sixteenth Amendment ... does not extend the taxing power\r\n     to new or excepted subjects, but merely removes all occasion,\r\n     which otherwise might exist, for an apportionment among the\r\n     states of taxes laid on income, whether it be derived from one\r\n     source or another....\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Peck v. Lowe_, 247 U.S., 165.]\r\n\r\nIn a case decided a little earlier[1] the Court, speaking through Chief\r\nJustice White, had said:\r\n\r\n     By the previous ruling (i.e., in _Brushaber v. Union Pacific\r\n     Railway Co._, 240 U.S., 1) it was settled that the provisions\r\n     of the Sixteenth Amendment conferred no new power of\r\n     taxation....\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co._, 240 U.S., 103, 112.]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it will be evident that the doctrine of\r\nexemption of state and municipal bonds from federal taxation is firmly\r\nembedded in our law and has not been affected by the Sixteenth\r\nAmendment.\r\n\r\nWhether it is a doctrine suited to present-day conditions is a question\r\noutside the scope of this paper.\r\n\r\nThe fear of federal encroachment, so strong in the minds of the makers\r\nof our Constitution, has become little more than a tradition. To many it\r\ndoubtless will seem that any rule of law which operates to prevent the\r\nnation, in the great exigency of war, from taxing a portion of the\r\nproperty of its citizens is pernicious and should be changed.\r\n\r\nIf this be the view of a sufficient number the change can and will be\r\nmade. Lawyers think, however, that it will have to be done by the\r\norderly method of constitutional amendment, not by passing taxing\r\nstatutes which a reluctant Court will be obliged to declare\r\nunconstitutional.\r\n\r\nJust now the tide of popular sentiment is setting strongly toward such a\r\nchange. It was advocated in a recent Presidential message.[1] The\r\nimmunity enjoyed by state bond issues is coming to be regarded less as a\r\nsafeguard of state rights than as a means whereby the rich escape\r\nfederal income surtaxes. One is tempted to predict that the next formal\r\namendment of the Constitution will deal with this subject. If so,\r\nanother inroad will have been made by the General Government on the\r\nfailing powers of the states.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Message of President Harding to Congress, December 6,\r\n1921.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nIS THE FEDERAL CORPORATION TAX CONSTITUTIONAL?[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Since this chapter was first published in 1909 as an\r\narticle in the _Outlook_ magazine the specific question propounded in\r\nits title has been settled by the Supreme Court (_Flint v. Stone Tracy\r\nCo._, 220 U.S., 107). The paper is here reproduced, however, in the\r\nbelief that its discussion of the principles of our dual system of\r\nGovernment is as pertinent now as it was before.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy enactment of the sixty-first Congress from a legal\r\npoint of view, to say nothing of its economic and political\r\nsignificance, was the Corporation Tax Act. That Act, forming §38 of the\r\nTariff Law, provides--\r\n\r\n     That every corporation ... organized for profit and having a\r\n     capital stock represented by shares ... shall be subject to\r\n     pay annually a special excise tax with respect to the carrying\r\n     on or doing business by such corporation ... equivalent to one\r\n     per centum upon the entire net income over and above five\r\n     thousand dollars received by it from all sources, etc.\r\n\r\nThe act goes on to require the corporations to make periodical reports\r\nconcerning their business and affairs, and confers on the Commissioner\r\nof Internal Revenue a visitorial power to examine and compel further\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\nThe genesis of the act is interesting. The growing demand for more\r\nefficient regulation of the corporations, so pronounced during President\r\nRoosevelt's Administration, had foreshadowed such legislation. It\r\nremained, however, for President Taft to take the initiative and mould\r\nthe shape which the legislation was to take.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the Senate debate on the new Tariff Act it had become\r\napparent that an influential party in Congress, backed by strong\r\nsympathy outside, was bent upon passing a general income tax act. The\r\nprevious Income Tax Law had been pronounced unconstitutional by the\r\nSupreme Court as violating the provision of the Constitution that all\r\ndirect taxes must be apportioned among the states in proportion to\r\npopulation.[1] That decision, however, had been reached by a bare\r\nmajority of five to four. It had overruled previous decisions and\r\noverturned doctrines that had been acquiesced in almost from the\r\nfoundation of the Government. A strong party was in favor of enacting\r\nanother income tax law and bringing the question again before the Court\r\nin the hope that the Court as then constituted might be induced to\r\noverrule or materially modify the doctrine of the Pollock case. The\r\nPresident and his advisers viewed such a proposal with disfavor. To\r\ntheir minds the proper way to establish the right of Congress to levy an\r\nincome tax was by an amendment to the Constitution, not by an assault\r\nupon the Supreme Court. Accordingly on June 16, 1909, the President\r\ntransmitted a message to Congress[2] recommending a constitutional\r\namendment, and proposing, in order to meet the present need for more\r\nrevenue, an excise tax on corporations. The proposal, coupled as it was\r\nwith a suggestion that such an act might be made to serve for purposes\r\nof federal supervision and control as well as revenue, met with favor\r\nand was enacted into law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Pollock vs. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co._, 157 U.S., 429.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Congressional Record_, June 16, 1909, p. 3450.]\r\n\r\nPresident Taft, himself an eminent constitutional lawyer, in his message\r\nrecommending the law expressed full confidence in its constitutionality.\r\nThe same view was taken by able lawyers who surrounded him in the\r\ncapacity of advisers. The act is understood to have been drafted by Mr.\r\nWickersham, the Attorney General, and vouched for by Senator Elihu Root\r\nand others of scarcely less authority in the domain of constitutional\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nAgainst opinions from such sources one takes the field with diffidence.\r\nI venture, however, to outline briefly some reasons for doubting the\r\nconstitutionality of the act.\r\n\r\nAt the outset it is essential to determine the exact nature of the tax.\r\nObviously it is not a tax upon income _as income_. If it were, it would\r\nbe obnoxious to the decision in the Pollock case as imposing a direct\r\ntax without apportionment among the states. The language of the act, as\r\nwell as the declarations of its sponsors, clearly indicate that it is\r\nintended, not as a direct tax on property, but as an excise tax on\r\nprivilege. The phraseology of the act itself is--\"A special excise tax\r\nwith respect to the carrying on or doing business by such corporation,\"\r\netc. Undoubtedly Congress has power to impose an excise tax upon\r\noccupation or business. This was expressly decided, in the case of the\r\nbusinesses of refining petroleum and refining sugar, by the Spreckels\r\ncase,[1] referred to in President Taft's message. The message says:\r\n\r\n     The decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Spreckels\r\n     Sugar Refining Company against McClain (192 U.S., 397) seems\r\n     clearly to establish the principle that such a tax as this is\r\n     an excise tax upon privilege and not a direct tax on property,\r\n     and is within the federal power without apportionment\r\n     according to population.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Spreckels Sugar Refining Co. vs. McClain_, 192 U.S., 397.]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the privilege with respect to which the tax is imposed?\r\nIs it, like the tax involved in the Spreckels case, the privilege of\r\ndoing the various kinds of business (manufacturing, mercantile, and the\r\nrest) in which the corporations subject to the operation of the law are\r\nengaged? Obviously not. No kind or kinds of business are specified in\r\nthe act. The tax falls not only on corporations doing every conceivable\r\nkind of business, but also on the corporation that does no specific\r\nbusiness whatever--the corporation which, in the language of an eminent\r\njudge, is merely \"an incorporated gentleman of leisure.\"[1] Moreover, if\r\nthe tax were merely upon the privilege of doing business, it would seem\r\nto be obnoxious to the cardinal principle of just taxation that taxes\r\nshould be uniform. In other words, if the privilege of doing a\r\nbusiness--say conducting a department store--were the thing taxed and\r\nthe only thing taxed, the rule of uniformity would seem to require that\r\na corporation and a copartnership conducting similar stores on opposite\r\ncorners of the street should both be taxed. Nothing inconsistent with\r\nthis view will be found in the Spreckels case. The party to that suit\r\nwas, to be sure, a corporation, but the act under which the tax was\r\nimposed applied to individuals, firms, and corporations alike.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Vann, J., in _People ex rel. vs. Roberts_, 154 N.Y., 1.]\r\n\r\nIt must be concluded, therefore, that the tax is not upon the privilege\r\nof doing the businesses in which the various corporations in the land\r\nare engaged, but is rather a _tax upon the privilege of doing business\r\nin a corporate capacity_, or, in other words, upon the exercise of the\r\ncorporate franchise. That this is so appears very clearly from the\r\nmessage of President Taft. He says:\r\n\r\n     This is an excise tax upon the privilege of doing business as\r\n     an artificial entity and of freedom from a general partnership\r\n     liability enjoyed by those who own the stock.\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, that this is the real nature of the tax, is it\r\nconstitutional?\r\n\r\nUnquestionably Congress may tax corporations organized under federal\r\nlaws upon their franchises; any sovereignty may tax the creatures of its\r\ncreation for the privilege of exercising their franchises; but how about\r\ncorporations chartered by the states and doing purely an intrastate\r\nbusiness? A state confers on John Doe and his associates the privilege\r\nor franchise of doing business in a corporate capacity. Can Congress\r\nimpose a tax on the exercise of that privilege or franchise? The power\r\nto tax involves the power to destroy.[1] If Congress can impose a tax of\r\none per cent., it can impose a tax of ten per cent. or fifty per cent.,\r\nand thus impair or destroy altogether the value of corporate charters\r\nfor business purposes. Does Congress possess such a power? The\r\nConstitution puts no express limitation on the right of Congress to levy\r\nexcises except that they shall be \"uniform throughout the United\r\nStates.\" But there are certain implied limitations inherent in our dual\r\nsystem of government. The sovereignty and independence of the separate\r\nstates within their spheres are as complete as are the sovereignty and\r\nindependence of the General Government within its sphere.[2] Neither may\r\ninterfere with or encroach upon the other.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _McCulloch vs. Maryland_, 4 Wheat., 316.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _The Collector vs. Day_, 11 Wall., 113, 124.]\r\n\r\nThe right to grant corporate charters for ordinary business purposes is\r\nan attribute of sovereignty belonging to the states, not to the General\r\nGovernment. The United States is a government of enumerated powers. The\r\nConstitution nowhere expressly confers upon Congress the right to grant\r\ncorporate charters, and it is well settled that this right exists only\r\nin the limited class of cases where the granting of charters becomes\r\nincidental to some power expressly conferred on Congress, e.g., the\r\npower to establish a uniform currency, or the power to regulate\r\ninterstate commerce. On the other hand, the right of the separate states\r\nto grant charters of incorporation is unquestionable. By the Tenth\r\nAmendment of the Constitution it is expressly provided: \"The powers not\r\ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it\r\nto the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people.\"\r\nThe Supreme Court long ago said: \"A state may grant acts of\r\nincorporation for the attainment of those objects which are essential to\r\nthe interests of society. _This power is incident to sovereignty._\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Briscoe v. Bank of Kentucky_, 11 Peters, 257, 317.]\r\n\r\nThe power to grant the franchise of corporate capacity being therefore\r\ninherent in the sovereignty of the states, will not a tax imposed by\r\nCongress upon the exercise of the franchise constitute an interference\r\nwith the power? If so the tax is unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held, that the National Government\r\n\"cannot exercise its power of taxation so as to destroy the state\r\ngovernments or embarrass their lawful action.\"[1] In the case of\r\n_California vs. Central Pacific R.R. Co._[2] the question was whether\r\nfranchises granted to the Central Pacific Railroad Company by the United\r\nStates were legitimate subjects of taxation by the State of California.\r\nThe Supreme Court, in language frequently quoted in subsequent cases,\r\ndiscusses the nature and origin of franchises, concluding that a\r\nfranchise is \"a right, privilege, or power of public concern\" existing\r\nand exercised by legislative authority. After enumerating various kinds\r\nof franchises, the Court remarks: \"No persons can make themselves a body\r\ncorporate and politic without legislative authority. Corporate capacity\r\nis a franchise.\" The Court continues:\r\n\r\n     In view of this description of the nature of a franchise, how\r\n     can it be possible that a franchise granted by Congress can be\r\n     subject to taxation by a state without the consent of\r\n     Congress? Taxation is a burden and may be laid so heavily as\r\n     to destroy the thing taxed or render it valueless. As Chief\r\n     Justice Marshall said in _McCulloch v. Maryland_, \"The power\r\n     to tax involves the power to destroy.\"... It seems to us\r\n     almost absurd to contend that a power given to a person or\r\n     corporation by the United States may be subjected to taxation\r\n     by a state. The power conferred emanates from and is a portion\r\n     of the power of the government that confers it. To tax it is\r\n     not only derogatory to the dignity but subversive of the\r\n     powers of the government, and repugnant to its paramount\r\n     sovereignty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Railroad Company v. Peniston_, 18 Wall., 5, 30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 127 U.S., 1.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Court was here discussing the right of a state to\r\ntax franchises granted by the United States, and not the converse of\r\nthat question. The reasoning of the Court would seem, however, to apply\r\nwith equal force to the right of the United States to tax a franchise\r\ngranted by a state acting within the scope of its sovereign authority.\r\n\r\nPatent rights and copyrights are special privileges or franchises\r\ngranted by the sovereign or government, and under the United States\r\nConstitution the right to grant patents and copyrights is expressly\r\nconferred on Congress. It has been held repeatedly that patent rights\r\nand copyrights are not taxable by the states[1]. As said by the New York\r\nCourt of Appeals in a case involving the power of the state to tax\r\ncopyrights:[2]\r\n\r\n     To concede a right to tax them would be to concede a power to\r\n     impede or burden the operation of the laws enacted by Congress\r\n     to carry into execution a power vested in the National\r\n     Government by the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _People ex rel. Edison, &c., Co., v. Assessors_, 156 N.Y.,\r\n417; _People ex rel. v. Roberts_, 159 N.Y., 70; _In Re Sheffield_, 64\r\nFed. Rep., 833; _Commonwealth v. Westinghouse, &c., Co._, 151 Pa., 265.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 159 N.Y., p. 75.]\r\n\r\nApparently the same rule would be applicable were the granting of patent\r\nrights, like the granting of ordinary corporate franchises, a\r\nprerogative reserved under our system of government to the states\r\ninstead of being expressly conferred on the United States. By parity of\r\nreasoning, the Federal Government in that case would have no power to\r\ntax them.\r\n\r\nIt is familiar law, reiterated over and over again by the Supreme Court,\r\nthat Congress cannot tax the means or instrumentalities employed by the\r\nstates in exercising their powers and functions, any more than a state\r\ncan tax the instrumentalities similarly employed by the General\r\nGovernment. Thus, it has been held that Congress cannot tax a municipal\r\ncorporation (being a portion of the sovereign power of the state) upon\r\nits municipal revenues[1]; that Congress cannot impose a tax upon the\r\nsalary of a judicial officer of a state[2]; that Congress cannot tax a\r\nbond given in pursuance of a state law to secure a liquor license.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _United States vs. Railroad Co._, 17 Wall., 322.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Collector v. Day_, 11 Wall., 113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ambrosini v. United States_, 185 U.S., 1.]\r\n\r\nIn the light of these decisions it is not apparent how Congress can tax\r\nthe franchises of those state corporations (and they are many and\r\nimportant) which perform some public or quasi-public function. A state,\r\nto carry out its purposes of internal improvement, charters an\r\nintrastate railway or ferry company with power to charge tolls and\r\nexercise the right of eminent domain. Is not the grant of corporate\r\nexistence and privileges to such a corporation one of the means or\r\ninstrumentalities employed by the state for carrying out its legitimate\r\nfunctions, and is not a tax by the Federal Government upon the exercise\r\nby such a corporation of its corporate powers an interference with such\r\nmeans or instrumentalities?\r\n\r\nIn any discussion of the right of Congress to tax the agencies of or\r\nfranchises granted by a state, the distinction must be borne in mind\r\nbetween a tax upon _property_ acquired by means of the franchise from\r\nthe state and a tax upon the exercise of the franchise itself. The\r\nformer tax may be perfectly valid where the latter would be\r\nunconstitutional. Thus, the Supreme Court has upheld a tax by a state\r\nupon the real and personal property (as distinct from the franchises) of\r\na railway company chartered by Congress for private gain, while\r\nconceding that the state could not tax the franchises, because to do so\r\nwould be a direct obstruction to federal powers.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Union Pacific Railroad Company vs. Peniston_, 18 Wall.,\r\n5.]\r\n\r\nIt remains to notice briefly one or two Supreme Court decisions which\r\nare relied upon by the sponsors of the new tax law. Reference has\r\nalready been made to the decision in the Spreckels case[1] which upheld\r\nthe validity of the tax imposed by the War Revenue Act of 1898 upon the\r\ngross receipts of corporations engaged in the businesses of refining\r\npetroleum and refining sugar. The Court held the tax to be an excise tax\r\n\"in respect of the carrying on or doing the business of refining sugar,\"\r\nand such it obviously was. It was not a tax upon the privilege or\r\nfranchise of doing business in a corporate capacity, like the tax now\r\nunder debate. On the contrary, the act expressly applied to \"every\r\nperson, firm, corporation, or company carrying on or doing the business\r\nof refining sugar....\" The case, therefore, has no bearing on the point\r\nwe are discussing. Had the act applied only to corporations, a different\r\nquestion would have been involved.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Spreckels Sugar Refining Co. vs. McClain_. 192 U.S., 397.]\r\n\r\nThe case of _Veazie Bank vs. Fenno_,[1] upholding the statute which\r\ntaxed out of existence the circulation of the state banks, has\r\nfrequently been cited as an authority sustaining the right of Congress\r\nto levy a tax upon a franchise or privilege granted by a state. It is\r\ntrue that in that case the eminent counsel for the bank (Messrs. Reverdy\r\nJohnson and Caleb Cushing) argued unsuccessfully \"that the act imposing\r\nthe tax impaired a franchise granted by the state, and that Congress had\r\nno power to pass any law which could do that;\"[2] and that two justices\r\ndissented on that ground. The conclusive answer to this argument, was,\r\nhowever, that the power of the states to grant the particular right or\r\nprivilege in question was subordinate to powers expressly conferred on\r\nCongress by the Constitution; that Congress was given power under the\r\nConstitution to provide a currency for the whole country, and the act in\r\nquestion was legislation appropriate to that end. The case does not\r\nhold that Congress has any general power to tax franchises or privileges\r\ngranted by a state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 8 Wall., 533.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See 8 Wall., p. 535.]\r\n\r\nThe scope of this chapter does not admit of further reference to the\r\ndecisions. It is strongly urged, however, that none of them, rightly\r\nconstrued, will be found to sustain the right of the General Government\r\nto impose a tax upon the exercise of franchises granted by a state in\r\nthe exercise of its independent sovereignty, and that such a decision\r\nwould mark a new departure in our jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nIn the debates in Congress over the bill many good lawyers appear to\r\nhave assumed, somewhat too hastily, that the tax in question was an\r\nexcise tax on business or occupation like that involved in the Spreckels\r\ncase, and that the only constitutional question, therefore, was one of\r\nclassification under the provision of the Constitution that excises\r\nshall be uniform throughout the United States. No less eminent a\r\nconstitutional lawyer than Senator Bailey of Texas, in a colloquy with\r\nthe junior Senator from New York, put the matter thus:[1]\r\n\r\n     Mr. Root: May I ask the Senator from Texas if I am right in\r\n     inferring from the statement which he has just made that he\r\n     does not seriously question the constitutional power of the\r\n     Congress to impose this tax on corporations?\r\n\r\n     Mr. Bailey: Mr. President, I answer the Senator frankly that I\r\n     do not.... I think the rule was and is that Congress can levy\r\n     any tax it pleases except an export tax. Of course a direct\r\n     tax must be apportioned and an indirect tax must be uniform.\r\n     But the uniformity rule simply requires that wherever the\r\n     subject of taxation is found, the tax shall operate equally\r\n     upon it.\r\n\r\n     I believe that Congress can tax all red-headed men engaged in\r\n     a given line of business if it pleases.... I have no doubt if\r\n     the tax fell upon every red-headed man in Massachusetts the\r\n     same as in Mississippi or Texas and all other states, the law\r\n     imposing such a tax would be perfectly valid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Congressional Record_ for July 6, 1909, pp. 4251 to 4252.]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with this reasoning is that it overlooks the fact that\r\nthe privilege of being red-headed is not a franchise granted by a\r\nsovereign state. From the viewpoint of constitutional law it may well be\r\nthat Congress can tax a privilege conferred by the gods where it would\r\nbe powerless to tax a franchise granted by the Legislature of New\r\nJersey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE CORPORATION TAX DECISION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe immediate consequences of the decision of the United States Supreme\r\nCourt[1] affirming the constitutionality of the federal corporation tax\r\nare so slight that its profound significance is likely to be overlooked.\r\nUntil it was merged with the general income tax the exaction was not\r\nburdensome and proved easy of collection. The thing upon which it\r\nfell--the privilege of doing business in a corporate capacity--is an\r\nabstraction which makes little appeal to the sympathies or the moral\r\nsense. The public, more concerned with present conditions than with the\r\npassing of a theory, is indifferent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Flint v. Stone Tracy Co._, 220 U.S., 107]\r\n\r\nThus it has sometimes been with the turning points in the affairs of\r\nnations. They came quietly and without observation, and it remained for\r\nthe historians to mark the actual parting of the ways.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court holds, and in its opinion reiterates many times, that\r\nthe tax is upon the _privilege of doing business in a corporate\r\ncapacity_.\r\n\r\nRight here is the crux of the matter. Corporate capacity is not a right\r\ngranted by the National Government. It is something which Congress can\r\nneither give nor take away. In the division of powers which marked the\r\ncreation of our dual government the power to confer corporate capacity\r\nwas reserved to the states. The decision, therefore, comes to this:\r\nCongress can by taxation burden the exercise of a privilege which only a\r\nstate can grant. And the power to tax, it must be remembered, involves\r\nthe power to destroy. This seems a long step from the theory of the men\r\nwho founded the Republic.\r\n\r\nNearly fifty years ago the Supreme Court stated the theory as follows:\r\n\r\n     The states are, and they must ever be, co-existent with the\r\n     National Government. Neither may destroy the other. Hence the\r\n     Federal Constitution must receive a practical construction.\r\n     Its limitations and its implied prohibitions must not be\r\n     extended so far as to destroy the necessary powers of the\r\n     States, or prevent their efficient exercise.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Railroad Co. v. Peniston_, 18 Wall., 5.]\r\n\r\nThe court buttresses its decision by the argument _ex necessitate_--that\r\nto hold otherwise would open the way for men to withdraw their business\r\nactivities from the reach of federal taxation and thus cripple the\r\nNational Government. The Court says:\r\n\r\n     The inquiry in this connection is: How far do the implied\r\n     limitations upon the taxing power of the United States over\r\n     objects which would otherwise be legitimate subjects of\r\n     federal taxation, withdraw them from the reach of the Federal\r\n     Government in raising revenue, because they are pursued under\r\n     franchises which are the creation of the states?... Let it be\r\n     supposed that a group of individuals, as partners, were\r\n     carrying on a business upon which Congress concluded to lay an\r\n     excise tax. If it be true that the forming of a state\r\n     corporation would defeat this purpose, by taking the necessary\r\n     steps required by the state law to create a corporation and\r\n     carrying on the business under rights granted by a state\r\n     statute, the federal tax would become invalid and that source\r\n     of national revenue be destroyed, except as to the business in\r\n     the hands of individuals or partnerships. It cannot be\r\n     supposed that it was intended that it should be within the\r\n     power of individuals acting under state authority thus to\r\n     impair and limit the exertion of authority which may be\r\n     essential to national existence.\r\n\r\nThis argument will not bear scrutiny. It apparently loses sight of the\r\nvital distinction between a tax on the mere doing of business and a tax\r\non the privilege of doing that business in a corporate capacity. These\r\nare two very different things. The right of Congress to tax the doing of\r\nbusiness was not disputed. It had been expressly upheld in the\r\nwell-known case of _Spreckels Sugar Refining Co. v. McClain_,[1] which\r\ninvolved a tax on the business of refining sugar, whether done by a\r\ncorporation or by individuals. The tax under consideration, however,\r\ngoes further and fastens upon something new--something which in the case\r\nof individuals or partnerships has no existence at all--which comes into\r\nbeing only by the exercise of the sovereign power of a state. The\r\nopponents of the tax, far from attempting to narrow the existing field\r\nof federal taxation, were in fact resisting an encroachment by Congress\r\non an entirely new field, created by, and theretofore reserved\r\nexclusively to, the separate states. It was conceded that Congress could\r\ntax a business when done by individuals and could tax the same business\r\nwhen done by a corporation. The inquiry was: Does the act of a state in\r\nclothing the individuals with corporate capacity create a new subject\r\nmatter for taxation by the General Government? That was the real\r\nquestion before the Court, and the decision answers it in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 192 U.S., 397.]\r\n\r\nOther illustrations of the same apparent confusion of thought are to be\r\nfound in the opinion. For example, it is said (citing various cases\r\ninvolving a tax on business where the party taxed was a corporation):\r\n\r\n     We think it is the result of the cases heretofore decided in\r\n     this Court, that such _business activities_, though exercised\r\n     because of state-created franchises, are not beyond the taxing\r\n     power of the United States.\r\n\r\nHere again the Court seems to lose sight of the distinction between a\r\ntax on \"business activities\" and a tax on the privilege of conducting\r\nsuch activities in a corporate capacity.\r\n\r\nIt is futile, however, to quarrel with the logic of the opinion. The\r\nquestion is closed and the Court, by affirming the judgments appealed\r\nfrom, has committed itself to the theory that the Federal Government\r\nmay, by taxation, burden the exercise of a privilege which only a state\r\ncan confer. With the expediency of that theory as applied to present-day\r\npolitical conditions we are not now concerned. The object of this\r\nchapter is to point out that the decision marks a distinct departure\r\nfrom the earlier doctrine that the two sovereignties, federal and state,\r\nare upon an equality within their respective spheres.\r\n\r\nIn view of the centralizing forces which are tending to transform these\r\nsovereign states into mere political subdivisions of a nation, the\r\ndecision is of great significance. Moreover, in a very practical way it\r\ntouches the right of each state under the compact evidenced by the\r\nFederal Constitution to manage its internal affairs free from compulsion\r\nor interference by the other states. To illustrate: In some parts of the\r\ncountry the anti-corporation feeling runs high. Many men if given their\r\nway would tax the larger corporations out of existence. Under this\r\ndecision the way is open whenever a majority can be secured in Congress.\r\nAn increase in the tax rate is all that would be necessary. Make the\r\nrate ten per cent. or twenty per cent. instead of one per cent. and the\r\nthing is accomplished.\r\n\r\nNew York may deem it good policy to encourage the carrying on of\r\nindustry in a corporate form. Texas may take a different view and\r\nconclude that the solution of the trust problem lies in suppressing\r\ncertain classes of corporations altogether. Under this decision it lies\r\nwithin the power of Texas and her associates if sufficiently numerous to\r\nimpose their view on New York and make it impossible for her domestic\r\nindustries to be carried on profitably in a corporate form. And yet the\r\npossibility of impressing the will of one state or group of states upon\r\nanother state with respect to her internal affairs is the very thing\r\nwhich the founders of the republic sought most carefully to avoid. Had\r\nit been understood in 1787 that the grant of taxing powers to the\r\nGeneral Government involved such a curtailment of state independence,\r\nfew states, in all probability, would have been ready to ratify the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE TRUSTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curbing of monopolies and combinations in restraint of trade was no\r\npart of the functions of the Federal Government as planned by the\r\nframers of the Constitution. To their minds such matters, under the dual\r\nsystem of government which they were establishing, belonged to the\r\nstates. The Constitution was designed to limit the National Government\r\nto functions absolutely needed for the national welfare. All other\r\npowers were \"reserved to the states respectively or to the people.\"\r\n\r\nAs time went on, however, and industries expanded it was seen that the\r\npower of no single state was adequate to control concerns operating in\r\nmany states at the same time. The need of action by the General\r\nGovernment became manifest. Power in Congress to legislate on the\r\nsubject, albeit somewhat indirectly, was found in the Commerce Clause of\r\nthe Constitution, and in the year 1890 the Sherman Anti-Trust Act was\r\nenacted.\r\n\r\nFew statutes have aroused more discussion or been the subject of more\r\nperplexity and misunderstanding. President Taft's remark, made after the\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court in the Standard Oil and Tobacco Trust\r\ncases,[1] that \"the business community now knows or ought to know where\r\nit stands,\" was received with incredulity approaching derision. Yet from\r\na lawyer's point of view (and it must be borne in mind that the\r\nPresident was a lawyer and is now Chief Justice of the Court) the\r\nstatement cannot be controverted. The decisions in the Standard Oil and\r\nTobacco cases did in fact dispel whatever uncertainty remained as to\r\nwhat the Sherman Act means.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Standard Oil Co. v. United States_, 221 U.S., 1.\r\n\r\n_United States v. American Tobacco Co._, id., 106.]\r\n\r\nThe Sherman Act[1] declares unlawful every contract, combination, or\r\nconspiracy in restraint of interstate trade, and every attempt to\r\nmonopolize interstate trade. The legal uncertainties that have arisen in\r\nits enforcement have not been with respect to the meaning of the terms\r\n\"restraint of trade\" and \"monopoly,\" although the popular impression is\r\nto the contrary. In 1890, when the statute was passed, contracts in\r\nrestraint of trade and monopolies were already unlawful at common law,\r\nand these terms, by a long series of decisions both here and in England,\r\nhad been defined as definitely as the nature of the subject matter\r\npermitted. While incapable (like the term \"fraud\") of precise definition\r\ncovering all forms which the ingenuity of man might devise, nevertheless\r\ntheir meaning and scope were well within the understanding of any man of\r\nreasonable intelligence. Whatever legal uncertainties have arisen have\r\nbeen chiefly owing to two questions: first, What is _interstate_ trade\r\nwithin the meaning of the act? and second, Did the act enlarge the\r\ncommon-law rule as to what restraints were unlawful?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"An Act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful\r\nrestraints and monopolies,\" approved July 2, 1890.]\r\n\r\nThe act was nearly shipwrecked at the outset on the first of these\r\nquestions. In the famous Knight case,[1] the first case under the\r\nSherman Act to reach the Supreme Court, it was held that the\r\ntransactions by which the American Sugar Refining Company obtained\r\ncontrol of the Philadelphia refineries and secured a virtual monopoly\r\ncould not be reached under the act because they bore no direct relation\r\nto interstate commerce. The effect of this decision naturally was to\r\ncast doubt upon the efficacy of the statute and encourage the trust\r\nbuilders. Perhaps the case was rightly decided in view of the peculiar\r\nform in which the issues were presented by the pleadings. In the light\r\nof later decisions, however, it is safe to assert that the Court would\r\nnow find little difficulty in applying the remedies provided by the\r\nSherman Act to a similar state of facts, properly presented. While no\r\nprudent lawyer would care to attempt a comprehensive definition of what\r\nconstitutes interstate commerce, it may at least be said that the\r\ntendency of the courts has been and is toward a constant broadening of\r\nthe term to meet the facts of present-day business.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _United States v. E.C. Knight Company_, 156 U.S., 1.]\r\n\r\nThe other question--Did the Sherman Act change the common-law rule as to\r\nwhat restraints and monopolies are forbidden?--has been even more\r\ntroublesome. The lawyers in Congress who framed the law believed that it\r\ndid not. This is the testimony of Senator Hoar in his Autobiography, and\r\nas he was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee which reported the\r\nact in its present form, and claims to have drawn it himself, his\r\ntestimony is entitled to belief. The Supreme Court, however, in this\r\nparticular went further than was expected. In the Trans-Missouri\r\nFreight Association case,[1] which reached the Supreme Court two years\r\nafter the Knight case, that tribunal decided by a five-to-four majority\r\nthat the words \"_every_ contract ... in restraint of trade\" extended the\r\noperation of the law beyond the technical common-law meaning of the\r\nterms employed so as in fact to include all contracts in restraint of\r\ninterstate trade without exception or limitation. This theory was\r\nstrongly combated by the minority of the court, speaking through Justice\r\n(afterwards Chief Justice) White, and was denounced by many eminent\r\nlawyers, notably the late James C. Carter, then leader of the New York\r\nBar, who predicted that sooner or later it must be abandoned as\r\nuntenable. Their protests were well founded. The theory, carried to its\r\nlogical conclusion, would have prohibited a great variety of\r\ntransactions theretofore deemed reasonable and proper, and would have\r\nbrought large business to a standstill. As a matter of fact, it was\r\nnever carried to its logical conclusion, and six years later it was\r\nexpressly repudiated by Justice Brewer; one of the five, in the course\r\nof his concurring opinion in the Northern Securities case.[2] Justice\r\nBrewer said that while he believed the Trans-Missouri case had been\r\nrightly decided he also believed that in some respects the reasons given\r\nfor the judgment could not be sustained.\r\n\r\n     Instead of holding that the Anti-Trust Act included all\r\n     contracts, reasonable or unreasonable, in restraint of\r\n     interstate trade, the ruling should have been that the\r\n     contracts there presented were unreasonable restraints of\r\n     interstate trade, and as such within the scope of the Act....\r\n     Whenever a departure from common-law rules and definitions is\r\n     claimed, the purpose to make the departure should be clearly\r\n     shown. Such a purpose does not appear and such a departure was\r\n     not intended.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _United States v. Trans-Missouri Association_, 166 U.S.,\r\n290.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Northern Securities Company v. United States_, 193 U.S.,\r\n197.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the troublesome question remained, to plague lawyers and\r\nthe community generally, until it was finally put at rest and the\r\nstatute once more planted on the firm ground of common-law rule and\r\ndefinition by the decisions in the Standard Oil and Tobacco cases.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is this common-law rule which President Taft found so clear?\r\nNo one has discussed it more lucidly than did the youthful Circuit Judge\r\nTaft himself in delivering the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals\r\nin the Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. case,[1] an opinion in which his two\r\nassociates on the bench, the late Justices Harlan and Lurton, concurred.\r\nThe rule may be briefly stated as follows:\r\n\r\nEvery contract or combination whose primary purpose and effect is to fix\r\nprices, limit production, or otherwise restrain trade is unlawful,\r\nprovided the restraint be direct, material, and substantial.\r\n\r\nWhere, however, the restraint of trade is not direct, but merely\r\nancillary or collateral to some lawful contract or transaction, it is\r\nnot unlawful, provided it is _reasonable_, that is to say, not broader\r\nthan is required for the protection of the party in whose favor the\r\nrestraint is imposed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co._, 85 Fed. Rep.,\r\n271.]\r\n\r\nA familiar illustration is the sale of a business and its goodwill,\r\naccompanied by a covenant on the part of the vendor not to compete. Such\r\na covenant is collateral to the sale, and if not broader than is\r\nreasonably required for the protection of the vendee it will be upheld,\r\nalthough a similar agreement, standing alone and not collateral to a\r\nsale or other lawful transaction, would be in direct restraint of trade\r\nand unlawful.\r\n\r\nSo much for the alleged uncertainty of the law. Candid men must agree\r\nwith President Taft that in the light of the Supreme Court decisions it\r\nis reasonably clear what the Sherman Law means. But the fact that \"the\r\nbusiness community now knows or ought to know where it stands\" with\r\nrespect to the law does not greatly help the business situation. The\r\nreal difficulty lies, not in the uncertainty of the law, but in the fact\r\nthat the law does not fit actual present-day conditions. This is partly\r\nbecause many of the trusts were organized with full knowledge that they\r\ninvolved a violation of law but in the belief that the law could not or\r\nwould not be effectively enforced. The realization that this belief was\r\nmistaken has thrown a good many people into a state of very genuine\r\nbewilderment, but it is an uncertainty, not as to what is firm ground,\r\nbut as to how to get out of a bog, once having gotten in. For the most\r\npart, however, the general feeling of insecurity is due not so much to\r\nhaving knowingly overstepped the law, as to a change in economic\r\nconditions. The spirit of the time is one of coöperation and\r\ncombination. It is manifested in the churches and colleges as well as in\r\nthe marketplace. In the industrial arena, the tendency has been\r\nintensified by the invention of new machines and the resulting\r\naggregations of fixed capital in forms designed for particular uses and\r\nincapable of diversion into other channels. Such rules of the common or\r\ncustomary law as were the outgrowth of an era of mobile capital and free\r\ncompetition no longer fit the conditions under which we are living.\r\n\r\nIn a conflict between economic forces and legal enactment there can\r\nfinally be but one outcome. The law must sooner or later adapt itself to\r\nlife conditions. The real problem to-day is--how shall this adaptation\r\nbe accomplished; how can statutes be framed which shall check abuses\r\nwithout falling under the wheels of social progress? Right here a swarm\r\nof half-informed theorizers are rushing in where trained economists fear\r\nto tread. It is difficult and dangerous ground, but there is at least\r\none measure of legal reform--take away the right of one corporation to\r\nhold stock in another--which might be urged with confidence were it not\r\nfor the existence of sundry oppressive and conflicting state laws.\r\n\r\nThe abolition by law of the holding-company device is no new suggestion.\r\nIt was strongly urged years ago by the late Edward B. Whitney. It was\r\nthe keystone of the famous \"Seven Sisters\" statutes,[1] enacted with\r\nloud acclaim in New Jersey at the behest of Governor Woodrow Wilson (but\r\nsubsequently repealed and thrown into the discard). Such a measure would\r\nbe more effective and far-reaching than the public supposes. Nearly all\r\nthe so-called trusts have been organized and are being held together in\r\nwhole or in part, by the holding-company device. In many cases this has\r\nbeen done merely as an innocent measure of convenience. The device,\r\nhowever, is a perversion of the corporate machine to uses not\r\ncontemplated by its inventors and fraught with danger. It is too\r\npowerful a weapon in the hands of those alive to its possibilities,\r\nenabling a small group of men with a relatively insignificant investment\r\nof capital to control a country-wide industry. Take the simplest\r\npossible illustration: The industry of manufacturing a particular\r\ncommodity is carried on by a number of corporations scattered throughout\r\nthe country with an aggregate capitalization of, say, $10,000,000. A, B,\r\nand C form a holding company to acquire a bare majority of the stock of\r\neach corporation, say $5,100,000 in the aggregate. They dispose of 49\r\nper cent. of the holding company's stock to the public, retaining a\r\nworking majority. At one step they have secured absolute control of a\r\n$10,000,000 industry with an investment of little more than one-quarter\r\nof that amount, and by pursuing the same process further they can reduce\r\nthe investment necessary for controlling the industry almost to the\r\nvanishing point.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Laws of New Jersey of 1913, chaps. 13-19.]\r\n\r\nIt is needless to enlarge on the possible abuses of the holding-company\r\ndevice. They are coming to light more and more. The remedy, however, is\r\nnot so simple as it seems at first blush. A summary abolition of the\r\nholding-company device would result in great injury and hardship to\r\nindustry. In the present condition of the corporation laws of certain of\r\nthe states, the right of large corporations to operate through local\r\nsubsidiary corporations is a practical necessity. Otherwise they would\r\nbe subjected to well-nigh intolerable exactions and interference. It has\r\nbeen the policy in some states in dealing with foreign corporations to\r\nattempt to impose, under the guise of fees for the privilege of doing\r\nbusiness in the state, a tax on all their property and business wherever\r\nsituated. Some of the attempts have been nullified by the Supreme Court\r\nas violative of the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment against\r\ntaking property without due process of law, but these decisions have\r\nnot wholly remedied the evil or checked the ingenuity of state\r\nlegislators. In some jurisdictions great corporations seem to be\r\nregarded as fair game for which there is no closed season.\r\n\r\nRight here the scheme of federal incorporation brought forward during\r\nPresident Taft's administration has many attractions to offer. It would\r\ndo away with the principal excuse for the holding-company device, and\r\npave the way for its abolition. It should satisfy the general public\r\nbecause it would clothe the Government with enormously increased powers\r\nof regulation and control; it should be attractive to the corporations\r\nbecause it would afford relief from many of the intolerable\r\nrestrictions, not always fair or intelligent, imposed by state\r\nlegislatures. Under present conditions the right of a corporation of one\r\nstate to do business in another (other than business of an interstate\r\ncharacter) rests merely upon comity and may be granted or refused upon\r\nsuch terms as interest or prejudice may dictate. The right of a federal\r\ncorporation to do business in the several states, on the other hand,\r\nrests upon the powers conferred on Congress by the Constitution and is\r\nnot subject to the whims of state lawmakers. Such a corporation is not\r\n\"foreign\" in the states into which its activity extends and state laws\r\naimed at foreign corporations will not hit it. Moreover a corporation\r\nwith a federal charter can always take its controversies into the\r\nfederal courts (except when Congress expressly forbids)[1]--a right of\r\nextreme practical value where anti-corporation feeling or local\r\nprejudice is strong.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Act of Jan. 28, 1915, took away this right in the case\r\nof railroad companies incorporated under federal charter (38 Stat.\r\n804).]\r\n\r\nThe scheme of federal incorporation presents some constitutional\r\nquestions. As pointed out in a previous chapter, the Constitution\r\nnowhere expressly confers on Congress the right to grant corporate\r\ncharters. Under Chief Justice Marshall's doctrine of \"Implied Powers,\"\r\nhowever, it has become well settled that Congress has implied power to\r\ncharter a corporation whenever that is an appropriate means of\r\nexercising one of the powers expressly conferred, for example, the power\r\nto regulate interstate commerce. The most serious constitutional\r\nquestion appears to be whether Congress can authorize such a corporation\r\nto manufacture, the process of manufacturing not being an activity of an\r\ninterstate character. In any event, the difficulty could be surmounted\r\nby a constitutional amendment. In these days of facile amendment such a\r\nthing seems quite within the range of possibility.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of federal incorporation is by no means new. In the\r\nConvention of 1787 which framed the Constitution, Mr. Madison advocated\r\ngiving Congress the power to grant charters of incorporation. The\r\nproposition, however, did not find favor, Mr. King suggesting that it\r\nmight foster the creation of mercantile monopolies.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Farrand, \"Records of the Federal Convention,\" Vol. II,\r\npp. 615-616, 620.]\r\n\r\nThis objection would scarcely be urged to-day, when the country-wide\r\noperations of the so-called \"trusts\" have given them a national\r\ncharacter and made their control by federal power a practical necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nWHAT OF THE FUTURE?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages we have observed from various viewpoints the\r\nimpressive phenomenon of federal encroachment upon state power. It must\r\nhave become obvious to the most casual reader that the tide is running\r\nswiftly and has already carried far. Hamilton was mistaken when he\r\npredicted in the _Federalist_[1] that the National Government would\r\nnever encroach upon the state authorities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Federalist_, Numbers XVII, XXXI.]\r\n\r\nWhat then of the future? Is the Constitution hopelessly out of date? Are\r\nthe states to be submerged and virtually obliterated in the drift toward\r\ncentralization? No thoughtful patriot can view such a possibility\r\nwithout the gravest misgivings. The integrity of the states was a\r\ncardinal principle of our governmental scheme. Abandon that and we are\r\nadrift from the moorings which to the minds of statesmen of past\r\ngenerations constituted the safety of the republic.\r\n\r\nNo mere appeal to precedents and governmental theory will check the\r\ncurrent. The Americans are a practical people, moving forward with\r\nconscious power toward the attainment of their aims, along the lines\r\nwhich seem to them most direct. They are more interested in results than\r\nin methods or theories. Experience has demonstrated that federal control\r\noften spells uniformity and efficiency where state control had meant\r\ndivisions and weakness. They favor federal control because it gets\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThere is another aspect of the matter, however. The burden of federal\r\nbureaucracy is beginning to be felt by the average man. He is being\r\nregulated more and more, in his meats and drinks, his morals and the\r\nactivities of his daily life, from Washington. If he will only stop and\r\nthink he must realize that no one central authority can supervise the\r\ndaily lives of a hundred million people, scattered over half a\r\ncontinent, without becoming top-heavy. He must realize, too, that, even\r\nif such a centralization of power and responsibility were humanly\r\npossible, our National Government is unsuited for the task. The\r\nelectorate is too numerous and heterogeneous; its interests and needs\r\nare too diverse. Shall the conduct of citizens of Mississippi be\r\nprescribed by vote of congressmen from New York, or supervised at the\r\nexpense of New York taxpayers? Will an educational system suitable for\r\nMassachusetts necessarily fit the young of Georgia? Such suggestions\r\ncarry their own answer. In the very nature of things there is bound to\r\nbe a reaction against centralization sooner or later. The real question\r\nis whether it will come in time to save the present constitutional\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nThe makers of the Constitution never intended that the people of one\r\nstate should regulate, or pay for supervising, the conduct of citizens\r\nof another state. They made a division of governmental powers between\r\nnation and states along broad and obvious lines. To the Federal\r\nGovernment were entrusted matters of a strictly national\r\ncharacter--foreign relations, interstate commerce, fiscal and monetary\r\nsystem, post office, patents and copyrights. Everything else was\r\nreserved, to the states or the people. Here was a scheme at once\r\nexplicit and elastic. Explicit as to the nature of the functions to be\r\nperformed by the National Government; elastic enough to permit the\r\nexercise of all other powers reasonably incidental to the powers\r\nexpressly granted. The Constitution is not, and never was intended to\r\nbe, a strait-jacket.\r\n\r\nProofs abound of the adequacy of the constitutional scheme to deal with\r\nchanging conditions. For example, when the Constitution was adopted,\r\nrailroads, the most powerful economic force in our present civilization,\r\nwere unknown. Nevertheless, the Constitution contains adequate provision\r\nfor dealing with the railroads. They are instruments of interstate\r\ncommerce and may be controlled by the Federal Government under the\r\nexpress grant of power to regulate such commerce. Similar considerations\r\napply in the case of those nationwide industrial combinations popularly\r\nknown as \"trusts.\" Their activities are largely in the field of\r\ninterstate commerce and are subject to control as such by the Federal\r\nGovernment. Theoretically, only such activities of the railroads and\r\ntrusts as are of an interstate character fall within the federal\r\njurisdiction. Everything else lies within the jurisdiction of the\r\nstates. However, a practical people will not long permit matters which\r\nare essentially single and entire in their nature (for example, railroad\r\nclassifications and rates) to be split up merely for purposes of legal\r\njurisdiction and control. In such matters, therefore, some measure of\r\nfederal encroachment is inevitable in order that industry and progress\r\nshall not be hampered. The encroachment, however, is more apparent than\r\nreal. The industries are national in scope, and all the activities of\r\neach are more or less interwoven and interdependent. Hence state\r\nregulation of the intrastate activities may sometimes be overruled as an\r\ninterference with federal regulation of the interstate commerce. There\r\nis nothing in this which involves any real violation of the\r\nConstitution. It is merely an application of Marshall's doctrine of\r\nimplied powers.\r\n\r\nSocial welfare legislation presents a very different problem. Some of\r\nthe most dangerous assaults upon the Constitution to-day are being made\r\nin that field. The leaven of socialistic ideas is working.\r\nRepresentative government is becoming more paternalistic. Legislation\r\ndealing with conduct and social and economic conditions is being\r\ndemanded by public sentiment in constantly increasing measure. Such\r\nlegislation for the most part affects state police power and lies\r\nclearly outside the scope of the powers conferred by the Constitution on\r\nthe National Government. Moreover, \"the insulated chambers afforded by\r\nthe several states\" (to borrow a phrase of Justice Oliver Wendell\r\nHolmes) are ideal fields for social experiment. If an experiment\r\nsucceed, other states will follow suit. If it prove disastrous, the\r\ndamage is localized. The nation as a whole remains unharmed. The\r\nsponsors for such legislation, however, are seldom content to deal with\r\nthe states. Reform was ever impatient. The state method seems too slow,\r\nand the difficulty of securing uniformity too formidable. Moreover, it\r\noften happens that some states are indifferent to the reform proposed or\r\neven actively hostile. Accordingly, recourse is had to Congress, and\r\nCongress looks for a way to meet the popular demand. There being no\r\ndirect way, and public sentiment being insistent, Congressmen find\r\nthemselves under the painful necessity of circumventing the Constitution\r\nthey have sworn to uphold. The desired legislation is enacted under the\r\nguise of an act to regulate commerce or raise revenue, and the task of\r\nupholding the Constitution is passed to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nSuch subterfuges, far from arousing public condemnation, are praised by\r\nthe unthinking as far-sighted statesmanship. It is popular nowadays to\r\napply the term \"forward-looking\" to people who would make the National\r\nGovernment an agency for social-welfare work, and to characterize as\r\n\"lacking in vision\" anyone who interposes a constitutional principle in\r\nthe path of a social reform. Friends of progress sometimes forget that\r\nthe real forward-looking man is he who can see the pitfall ahead as well\r\nas the rainbow; the man of true vision is one whose view of the stars is\r\nsteadied by keeping his feet firmly on the ground.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be reiterated too often that, under our political system,\r\nlegislation in the nature of police regulation (except in so far as it\r\naffects commerce or foreign relations) is the province of the states,\r\nnot of the National Government. This is not merely sound constitutional\r\nlaw; it is good sense as well. Regulations salutary for Scandinavian\r\nimmigrants of the northwest may not fit the Creoles of Louisiana. In the\r\nlong run the police power will be exercised most advantageously for all\r\nconcerned by local authority.\r\n\r\nThe present tendency toward centralization cannot go on indefinitely. A\r\npoint must be reached sooner or later when an over-centralized\r\ngovernment becomes intolerable and breaks down of its own weight. As an\r\neminent authority has put it: \"If we did not have states we should\r\nspeedily have to create them.\"[1] The states thus created, however,\r\nwould not be the same. They would be mere governmental subdivisions,\r\nwithout the independence, the historic background, the traditions, or\r\nthe sentiment of the present states. These influences, hitherto so\r\npotent in our national life, would have been lost.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Address of Supreme Court Justice Charles E. Hughes before\r\nNew York State Bar Association, January 14, 1916.]\r\n\r\nIn a memorable address delivered in the year 1906 before the\r\nPennsylvania Society in New York, Elihu Root, then Secretary of State in\r\nPresident Roosevelt's Cabinet, discussed the encroachments of federal\r\npower and expressed the view that the only way in which the states could\r\nmaintain their power and authority was by awakening to a realization of\r\ntheir own duties to the country at large. He said:\r\n\r\n     The Governmental control which they (the people) deem just and\r\n     necessary they will have. It may be that such control would\r\n     better be exercised in particular instances by the governments\r\n     of the states, but the people will have the control they need\r\n     either from the states or from the National Government; and if\r\n     the states fail to furnish it in due measure, sooner or later\r\n     constructions of the Constitution will be found to vest the\r\n     power where it will be exercised--in the National Government.\r\n     The true and only way to preserve state authority is to be\r\n     found in the awakened conscience of the states, their\r\n     broadened views and higher standard of responsibility to the\r\n     general public; in effective legislation by the states, in\r\n     conformity to the general moral sense of the country; and in\r\n     the vigorous exercise for the general public good of that\r\n     state authority which is to be preserved.\r\n\r\nThose words, spoken fifteen years ago, were prophetic. Moreover, they\r\nare as true to-day as when they were uttered.\r\n\r\nWill the people see these things in time? Americans with pride in their\r\ncountry's past and confidence in her future dare not say No. The\r\nawakening may be slow. Currents of popular will are not readily turned.\r\nIt is hard to make the people think. But if leaders and teachers do\r\ntheir part American intelligence and prudence will assert themselves,\r\nand the slogan of an awakened public sentiment may yet be: \"Back to the\r\nConstitution!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nWE THE PEOPLE of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect\r\nUnion, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the\r\ncommon defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of\r\nLiberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this\r\nCONSTITUTION for the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE I.\r\n\r\nSECTION 1.
