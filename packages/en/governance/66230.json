FRANKLIN, and D. HALL. 1757.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ADDRESS, _&c._\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Design in this Address is to represent, to the People in this\r\nCountry, the very great Importance of treating the _Indians_, who live\r\namong us, and upon our Borders, in a just, kind and charitable Manner;\r\nand that we do, by all proper Means and Methods, endeavour to attach\r\nthem to us, and to the _British_ Interest. This, I apprehend, is a\r\nSubject that has been too much neglected, and that greatly wants to be\r\nset in a clear and just Light. And I sincerely wish that some Gentleman\r\nof greater Abilities and Address than I can pretend to, would take it\r\nin Hand: Tho’ if my weak Endeavours may be a Means of moving others to\r\ndo Justice to a Subject of such Weight, I shall heartily rejoice in it.\r\n\r\nThat I may offer what I have to say in the clearest and most concise\r\nManner I can, I shall go into the following Method.\r\n\r\n_First_, I shall endeavour to shew, that it is of vast Importance to\r\nthe _British Provinces_ and _Colonies_ in _America_, especially to the\r\nProvinces of the _Massachusetts_, _New-York_, and _New-Hampshire_, that\r\nthey be in good Terms with the _Indians_, and attach them to their\r\nInterest. And,\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, I shall endeavour to shew, by what _Means_ this may be\r\neffected: Or what are the most likely Methods to bring it to pass.\r\n\r\n1. I am to shew, that it is of vast Importance, that we be in good\r\nTerms with the _Natives_; and that we engage them in our Interest. I\r\nfreely grant, that the _Indians_, simply considered, are not of such\r\ngreat Consequence to us. We can subsist without them. But yet, their\r\nTrade is a considerable Article, worthy the Care of any politick\r\nPeople, and managed as it might, and ought to be, would yield us\r\ngreat Profit. But if we consider them with Relation to _Peace_ and\r\n_War_, as attached to us, or to our _Enemies_, they are of the last\r\nImportance to us; for they certainly have the Ballance of Power in\r\ntheir Hands, and are able to turn it for or against us, according as\r\nthey stand affected to us. _Canada_, inconsiderable as it is, and from\r\nwhich, separate from the _Indians_, we have little or nothing to fear\r\nin Time of War; _Canada_, I say, would be more than a Match for us,\r\nin case they join with them against us. He must be a great Stranger\r\nto, and very ignorant of, the Circumstances both of the _English_ and\r\n_Indians_, who is not sensible of this. Our Circumstances are such,\r\nthat we cannot guard ourselves against the Incursions of such Enemies\r\nin Time of War; for our _Frontiers_ are of vast Extent, and border upon\r\nthe adjacent Wilderness; which, tho’ almost inaccessible to us, yet is\r\nthe very Element in which they delight to live. They are at Home in\r\nit. The People therefore who inhabit our Frontiers, while they follow\r\ntheir necessary Business, are exposed to be an easy Prey to them; and\r\nmany of them have been surpriz’d in their Fields and Houses, and in\r\na most barbarous Manner put to Death. A small Number of _Indians_,\r\nencouraged and supported by the _French_ (which they are ready enough\r\nto do) can easily keep us in a constant Alarm, put us to an immense\r\nCharge, destroy many, and impoverish more, in our exposed Places, and\r\nnot put themselves at all out of their Way; yea, find their Account\r\nin it; for as they live by Hunting, so where Game is most plenty they\r\nare best off: And where can they find a better Supply, than among our\r\nCattle, Sheep, and Corn-Fields? There they live at Ease, distress and\r\nimpoverish us, and the adjacent Wilderness is their Refuge. By retiring\r\ninto it, they are soon out of our Reach; and long Experience has taught\r\nus how ineffectual the Measures we have taken for our Safety and\r\nDefence have proved.\r\n\r\nSome, I am sensible, will say, let us not be at any Cost and Pains to\r\ngain the Friendship of such a perfidious Crew, but let us destroy them\r\nall. Quickly said indeed, but not so soon nor so easily effected. Those\r\nPersons who are for destroying them would doubtless soon do it, were\r\nthey first bound and delivered up to them. But one Question here is,\r\nhow we shall get them into our Power? And another is, Whether it would\r\nbe so humane, generous and Christian-like, to take away their Lives,\r\nwere that in our Power, as it would be to cultivate Friendship with\r\nthem, and to seek their best Good? If we should be so sanguine as to\r\nendeavour to destroy them, it would doubtless prove a vain Attempt;\r\nand serve only to drive them to the _French_, who would be very ready\r\nto receive and protect them. If we neglect them, and take no Measures\r\nto engage them in our Interest, or to cultivate Friendship with them,\r\nthis will probably render them indifferent to us, and dispose them\r\nto hearken to the enticing Insinuations of _Romish_ Emissaries; and\r\nour Situation must be very unhappy, when they become engaged in the\r\n_French_ Interest.\r\n\r\nIf it be objected, that the _French_ have already gained a large Number\r\nof _Indians_ to their Interest, and therefore if we use our best\r\nEndeavours to gain others, it will avail nothing; for those who are\r\ndevoted to the _French_, will nevertheless distress us in Time of War.\r\nI reply,\r\n\r\nIt is very true, that the _French_ of _Canada_, thro’ their Policy and\r\nVigilance, have taken the Advantage of our Neglect, and gained a large\r\nNumber of the _Natives_ to their Interest, and are gaining more and\r\nmore every Year; and some even from among our own _Indians_. They spare\r\nneither Cost nor Pains to accomplish their Designs of this Nature,\r\nbeing sensible enough how advantageous it is to them, and how injurious\r\nto us; and if they continue to be active, and we negligent, as in\r\nTimes past, is it not too probable that they will, in a little Time,\r\nattach to themselves all the _Indians_ in _North-America_? Does it not\r\nthen concern us to use proper and vigorous Endeavours to prevent this\r\napparent Mischief, by counter-working the _French_? who are, I suppose,\r\ntampering with all the Tribes of _North-America_, to engage them in\r\ntheir Interest. And should we succeed in our Endeavours (as it is\r\nhighly probable we might, if proper Steps were taken) so as to engage\r\nthe _Five Nations_, and some other Tribes, in hearty Friendship with\r\nus; and especially if we should bestow such Favours upon them, as would\r\ninduce them to settle upon our Frontiers; it would in all Probability\r\nprevent the Evil spoken of in the Objection; for the _Indians_ from\r\n_Canada_ would not molest us, if a Number of the Natives, in hearty\r\nFriendship with us, were placed in our Borders. Of this we have had a\r\nvery plain Proof the last War, in the Safety of _Stockbridge_, and the\r\nadjacent Places, from any Attempts of the Enemy from _Canada_.\r\n\r\n_Stockbridge_ is in the very Road of, and more exposed to, the\r\n_Indians_ from _Canada_, than any other Place whatever; and yet we\r\nsee that the Enemy turned off East to _Connecticut-River_, and West\r\nto the _Dutch_ Settlements, where they did much Mischief; while\r\n_Stockbridge_, _Sheffield_, _New-Marlborough_, and _Number One_, tho’\r\nmore exposed, were not molested. This, so far as we can discern, was\r\nowing to a small Number of _Indians_ dwelling at _Stockbridge_, who\r\nare our hearty and fast Friends; which the Enemy being sensible of,\r\ncared not to come within their Reach, lest they should be taken in\r\ntheir own Snare. And if we should encourage the Settlement of other\r\n_Indian_ Towns upon our Frontiers, where Hunting is most handy to them,\r\nas _Stockbridge_ has been encouraged; should we give them Townships\r\nof Land suitable for their Improvement, build a Meeting-House and\r\nSchool-House in each Town, and support Ministers and School-Masters in\r\nthem; would not this convince them that we are their true Friends, and\r\nseek their Good? Would it not induce them to settle in our Borders?\r\nespecially those of them who are desirous that they themselves and\r\ntheir Children should be instructed? Would they not be a Guard to us\r\nin Time of War? And if, after all, we should meet with some Trouble\r\nfrom the _Indians_ of _Canada_, might it not be effectually prevented,\r\nby playing our _Indians_ upon them, as they do theirs upon us? And\r\nwould not the Charge of all this be a Trifle, compared with that of\r\ndefending ourselves in Time of War? But if we neglect them, and take\r\nno Measures to cultivate Friendship with them, and especially if we\r\ndeal injuriously by them, shall we not put an Advantage into the Hands\r\nof the _French_ (which they will not fail of improving) to engage them\r\nin their Interest, and to employ them against us in Time of War? which\r\nwould prove a very great Calamity to us, if not our utter Ruin. These\r\nThings considered, is it not of very great Importance, that we be at\r\ngood Terms with the neighbouring _Natives_?\r\n\r\n2. I will, in the next Place, endeavour to shew what are the likely\r\n_Methods_ to bring this to pass: Or what Measures we must take with the\r\n_Indians_, if we would engage them in hearty Friendship with us.\r\n\r\nAnd here, in general, our Conduct towards them must be such as shall\r\nmake them sensible that we are indeed their hearty Friends; and such\r\nalso as shall convince them that it is their Interest and Advantage\r\nto be in Friendship with us. Nothing short of this, I apprehend, will\r\nattach them to us, so as to answer the Ends proposed. If we often treat\r\nwith them, renew the Friendship, and bestow upon them large Presents:\r\nOr, as they phrase it, Smoke together, brighten the Chain, or put the\r\nBrands together, to kindle up the former Fire; and yet leave Room\r\nfor them to suppose that this proceeds not from true Friendship, but\r\nrather from Fear of them, or from Suspicion that they will join with\r\nour Enemies, &c. this will never be sufficient to engage them; the\r\nutmost we can rationally expect from it is, that they will not openly\r\nbreak with us, but keep up a Shew of Friendship, that they may have the\r\nBenefit of future Presents at our Hands.\r\n\r\nAgain, if we should by any Means convince them that we are their\r\ntrue Friends, and yet not go into such Measures with them as should\r\nturn to their _Advantage_, they would hardly be engaged for us. As\r\nall other People are governed by _Interest_, so are they. And the\r\nprincipal Handle we can take hold of, to attach them to us by, is\r\ntheir _Interest_, and that would not fail of doing it. If a Tribe of\r\n_Indians_ can sell their Skins to us for _Twenty Shillings_, and buy\r\ntheir Blankets for _Ten Shillings_; they will never go to _Canada_\r\nwhere they must sell their Skins for _Ten Shillings_, and give _Twenty\r\nShillings_ for a Blanket. Convince them that it is much for their\r\nInterest and Advantage to be our Friends and Allies, and we need not\r\nfear but that they will be so. Now, in order to convince them that we\r\nare truly their Friends, and that it is their Interest to be ours, we\r\nmust,\r\n\r\nIn the first Place, treat them according to the Rules of Equity and\r\nJustice. We must not defraud and oppress them, but be honest and just\r\nin our Dealings with them.\r\n\r\nThe Natives, with whom we have to do, are Persons of so much Sagacity,\r\nthat they can distinguish between just and injurious Treatment, as\r\nwell as other Men. They are also as ready to resent, and perhaps more\r\nforward to revenge Injuries, than any other People under Heaven. If\r\ntherefore we treat them in an unjust Manner, we may rationally expect\r\nthat they will be so far from being our Friends, that they will join\r\nwith our Enemies, and seek Opportunities of Revenge.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, that the _Indians_ are generally addicted to\r\nDrunkenness, and that when they have tasted a little Liquor, they have\r\na strong Thirst for more, and will part with any Thing they have, for a\r\nsufficient Quantity to make them drunk.----And is it not as well known,\r\nthat we have taken the Advantage of this their vicious Appetite, and\r\nfor a few Quarts of Rum have purchased valuable Effects of them? Have\r\nnot private Persons thus made their Gains of them, notwithstanding the\r\ngood Laws that have been in Force to prevent it? And is not this the\r\nManner of all private Traders, who go among their several Tribes for\r\nGain?\r\n\r\nIn our publick Dealings with them at our Truck-Houses, where Rum has\r\nbeen freely sold them, Care has been taken that they should not be\r\ncheated, but that they should have the full Value of what they had\r\nto sell: An Indian therefore, who was Owner of a Pack of Beaver,\r\nDeerskins, or any other valuable Goods, could buy a large Quantity\r\nof Rum, and might get drunk perhaps ten times, or more; whereas, if\r\nhe had fallen into private Hands, he must have contented himself with\r\nbeing drunk but once or twice. Which of these proves most injurious to\r\n_Indians_ in the End, I shall not pretend to determine.\r\n\r\nWhen they are thus intoxicated, they fall out among themselves, fight,\r\nand sometimes kill, one another, and some have drunk themselves dead\r\non the Spot. An Instance of each of these there has been, if I am\r\nrightly informed, at _Fort Dummer_, since that has been improved as a\r\nTruck-House. And whether the Guilt of that Blood does not lie upon us,\r\nI leave others to judge.\r\n\r\nNow, if we treat the _Natives_ in this Form, will they, can they, live\r\nwith us? Will not the Law of Self-Preservation oblige them to leave us,\r\nand to go where they may be better used? Some of the _Five Nations_\r\nplainly speak it out, and say, “We cannot live with the _English_ and\r\n_Dutch_; they bring us so much Rum, that it destroys us; we must go to\r\nthe _French_, who will let us have but little strong Drink.” Thus we\r\nalienate the _Indians_ from us, and as it were oblige them to go over\r\nto the _French_, who are often our Enemies, and fail not to employ them\r\nagainst us in Time of War. And if we proceed to deal thus injuriously\r\nwith them, what can we expect but that they will leave us, and be a\r\nsevere Scourge to us?\r\n\r\nTho’ the _Indians_ are sunk below the Dignity of human Nature, and\r\ntheir Lust after Drink exposes them to be cheated out of what little\r\nthey have; yet this gives us no Right to deal unjustly by them. They\r\nhave a natural Right to Justice, and may, with great Propriety,\r\nchallenge it at our Hands, seeing we profess to be subject to the Laws\r\nof _Christ_, which teach us to do _that which is altogether just_.\r\nAnd we should be so far from taking the Advantage of their Ignorance,\r\nVice and Poverty, to defraud them of what is their just Right, that\r\nwe should rather be moved to Pity, and compassionate their deplorable\r\nState, and be _Eyes to the Blind_, &c.\r\n\r\nI am fully persuaded, that if we were upright and just in all our\r\nTransactions with them; if our Trade with them was put into the Hands\r\nof faithful Men, who would deal justly by them; and if they were\r\nsupplied with all Necessaries for themselves and Families at a moderate\r\nPrice, it would not be in the Power of all the _French_ at _Canada_\r\n(subtle as they are) to alienate them from us. The _French_ are not\r\nupon equal Ground with us in this Affair. For their Northern Climate is\r\nmuch more inhospitable and severe than ours is: Their Country is not so\r\nproductive of those Fruits, which the _Indians_ very much live upon, as\r\nours: Nor can they afford Goods which are proper and necessary for the\r\n_Indians_ at so cheap a Lay as we can: Therefore we can give them those\r\nAdvantages which _Canada_ cannot. We can, without Damage to ourselves,\r\nmake it their Interest to adhere to us: And when Experience has once\r\ntaught them, that their Interest lies with us, they will want no other\r\nInducement to engage them to us: Yea, it will not only attach those of\r\nthem to us, who are not yet gone to _Canada_, but it will induce those\r\nwho are, to return to their Brethren, for the Sake of the Profit they\r\nmight reap by it; especially if we give them all the Advantage we can,\r\nconsistent with our own.\r\n\r\nAs unjust and abusive Treatment of the _Indians_ tends naturally\r\nto alienate them from us, and to turn them off to the _French_; so\r\na Series of just and faithful Dealing with them would be likely to\r\nattach them to us, and to make them our fast Friends. This again\r\nappears from the Temper and Conduct of that Part of the _Tribe_ of the\r\n_River Indians_ who live at _Stockbridge_. For tho’ they were, for\r\na considerable Time, extremely jealous, that we had some ill Design\r\nupon them, even in the Favours they received at our Hands (a Jealousy\r\nfounded, I suppose, upon the ill Usage the _Natives_ have too often\r\nbeen the Subjects of) yet by the just Treatment they, for a Course of\r\nYears, have met with from the _Government_, from Mr. _Sergeant_, Mr.\r\n_Woodbridge_, and others, they are become our hearty Friends; willing\r\nto live or die with us, whether in Peace or War.\r\n\r\nIt is very true, that in order to obtain the End proposed, our Trade\r\nwith the _Indians_ must not be in private Hands. It must not be in the\r\nPower of every private Person to treat them as he pleases. We may upon\r\ngood Grounds despair of their being treated with Equity and Justice,\r\nif every one may gratify his avaricious Temper in dealing with them.\r\nOur Trade therefore must be of a publick Nature, and must be committed\r\nto the Care and Management of faithful Men: Not to such as will seek\r\nthe Service, and make Friends to procure the Post for them; (certain\r\nIndications of a Self-seeker) but Men of Uprightness and Integrity must\r\nbe sought out; such, and such only, must be trusted with Business of\r\nsuch Importance: Good Instructions must be given them, which must be\r\ncarefully adhered to.\r\n\r\nIf the _Indian_ Trade at _Canada_ was in private Hands; if every\r\nprivate Person there might deal with the _Indians_ at Pleasure, we\r\nmight then hope that those who are gone from us would soon return;\r\nfor, in that Case, it is supposable enough that they would not meet\r\nwith much better Usage there than they do here; tho’ it is scarcely\r\nsupposable that they would meet with much worse. The _French_ Trade\r\nwith the _Indians_ is wholly in the Hands of publick Officers, (it I\r\nam rightly informed) and a private Man, if he wants a Dear-skin, a\r\nBeaver-skin, &c. is not allowed to purchase of an _Indian_, but must\r\ngo to the publick Stores. Upon the Supposition that those Officers are\r\nfaithful, and deal justly by the _Indians_, it is surely a wise and\r\npolitick Method to engage them in their Favour. And so long as every\r\nprivate Person in the English Government is at Liberty to trade with\r\nthem, when, and where, he pleases, and to cheat them out of what they\r\nhave, what can we expect but that they will repair to _Canada_, where\r\nthey may be better used? Is it not owing to the ill Treatment they\r\nhave met with from the _English_ and _Dutch_, that so many of them are\r\ngone already? And if no proper Measures are taken to prevent their\r\nbeing ill used, will not those who are yet behind soon follow their\r\nBrethren? Yea, if we furnish them with large Quantities of Rum, make\r\nthem drunk, and then defraud them of what they have, do we not reduce\r\nthem to a Necessity, either of living low and miserable with us, or\r\nof going from us, that they may fare better? How low, how dispirited,\r\nhow miserable and brutish these few are, who live within our Borders,\r\nis too manifest. And whether we, by our ill treating of them, have not\r\ncontributed to their Misery, is worthy of our serious Enquiry. Yea,\r\nwould it not be proper for us to enquire, Whether we have not, by our\r\nNeglect and Abuse of them, provoked Heaven to let loose the Natives\r\nupon us, who have been one of the sorest Scourges that we were ever\r\nchastised with? What Multitudes have they, in a most cruel Manner,\r\nmurdered in our Borders? How many of our Neighbours have they led into\r\nCaptivity? Some of whom have been redeemed at a very great Expence,\r\nand others are become either Pagans or Papists, and continue still in\r\na foreign Land. And who can count the Cost we have been at, to defend\r\nourselves against their Incursions?\r\n\r\nIf the British Government should be disposed, in Time to come, to\r\nset up and maintain a publick, honest and just Trade with the _Five\r\nNations_, or any other Tribes, thereby to attach them to us, to promote\r\ntheir true Interest, with other valuable Ends, that might thereby\r\nbe answered; this Objection perhaps would arise, _viz._ That such a\r\nProceeding will be a very great Expence to the Publick, for our Trade\r\ncannot be safe, unless it be protected by a considerable Force. A Fort\r\nmust be built, and a Garrison of 50, 60, or perhaps 100 Men, with their\r\nproper Officers, must be maintained at each Place where the Trade is\r\nset up; therefore the Advantage would not countervail the Cost. To this\r\nI reply,\r\n\r\nIf such Garrisons should be thought necessary in the Places where a\r\nTrade is set up, to be a Guard to it, the Charge would nothing like\r\nequal that of an Indian War, which perhaps it might prevent.\r\n\r\nBut further, I apprehend that the Charge of such Garrisons might be\r\nspared; and that, instead of being necessary, they would prove very\r\ninjurious to the Design; and that it would be a very wrong Step to be\r\ntaken in that Affair.\r\n\r\nAll who are in any good Measure acquainted with the _Indians_ know,\r\nthat they are extreamly jealous, lest any Incroachments should be made\r\nupon them; and it is not strange it should be so, considering what has\r\npast over them. And if a Number of armed Men were placed among them,\r\nand Forts built for the Defence of our Trade, they would be suspicious\r\nthat something hostile was intended, and we should not be able to\r\nremove the Suspicion. They would behold us with a jealous Eye, and\r\nperhaps take Measures to frustrate the whole Design.\r\n\r\nThe most effectual Way to induce them to trust us, is to trust them;\r\nand they will be ready enough to protect our Trade if we desire it, and\r\nshew that we confide in them to do it. And when a little Experience\r\nhas taught them how advantageous such a Trade would be to them, they\r\nwould be ready enough to do it for their own Advantage. If therefore we\r\nshould desire them to admit a Trader into one of their own Forts, or to\r\nbuild a Fort at our Charge in some convenient Place for such a Design,\r\nand to take Care that our Trade be safe; this would tend to convince\r\nthem, both of our Friendship to, and of our Confidence in, them; and\r\nthey would not only be pleased with it, but also ambitious to shew\r\nus that we may safely trust them: And were I to be the Truck-Master,\r\nI should esteem myself much safer in their Protection, than in a\r\nGarrison of 100 _English_ Men: For if such a Garrison should be placed\r\namong them, they themselves would suspect some ill Design carrying on\r\nagainst them; and the _French_ would infallibly tell them, that tho’\r\nwe pretended Peace and Friendship, yet our Design in the End is to\r\ndispossess them of their _Country_.\r\n\r\nIf indeed a Truck-Master should prove an unfaithful Servant, and enrich\r\nhimself by defrauding them, he might have Occasion for _English_\r\nSoldiers to protect him and his Stores; but if they found him faithful,\r\nfriendly and just in his Dealings with them, they would be as careful\r\nof him as of their own Eyes, and venture their own Lives for him. What\r\nwould not the _Indians_ of _Stockbridge_ have done for Mr. _Sergeant_\r\nin his Day, whom they had found to be their true and hearty Friend? And\r\nwhat would they not now do for Mr. _Woodbridge_, of whom the have had\r\nthe like Experience? _Indians_ will be as ready as the _English_, and\r\nperhaps much more so, to serve and protect, if there be Occasion, those\r\nwhom they have found to be their faithful and real Friends.\r\n\r\nIn a Word, I apprehend, that if we had in Times past treated the\r\nNatives according to the Rules of Equity and Justice, it would have\r\nbeen quite sufficient to have engaged them in our Interest, and to\r\nhave kept them in Amity and Friendship with us; and that, even now,\r\nthey might in a little Time be attached to us, by such Treatment: But\r\nthis, I confess, I despair of, if every private Person must be left at\r\nhis Liberty to treat them as he pleases, and to defraud them of all\r\nthey have; which I take to be the Case in _New-York_ Government, who\r\nlie next to the _Five Nations_, and have their Trade; tho’ in this\r\n_Province_ we have good Laws in Force to restrain private Persons from\r\nselling them strong Drink.\r\n\r\n2. We should also exercise that Kindness and Generosity towards\r\nthem, that shall convince them that it is for their Interest to be\r\nin Friendship with us. We should not, in a Case of such Importance,\r\ncontent ourselves with being barely just in our Treatment of them, but\r\nwe should also be kind and generous, as a proper Expedient to obtain\r\nthe End proposed. I am aware, I shall here be quickly interrupted with\r\nthis Exclamation;\r\n\r\nWhat! _kind_ and _generous_ to such an ungrateful evil Crew! To which\r\nI shall only answer, We have good Authority for being _kind to the\r\nUnthankful, and to the Evil_. And if that good Being who recommends\r\nit to us, had not given an Example of it, in his Dealings with us,\r\nhow deplorable had our State been? This kind Temper and Behaviour is\r\nrecommended to us in the Gospel, not only because it is the Will of our\r\nheavenly Father that we should be kind, but also because the Exercise\r\nof it answers excellent Ends; produces very good and desirable Effects;\r\nsuch as Love, Friendship, Peace, &c. And while we make a Profession of\r\nChristianity, it is Pity the Practice of it, in so material an Article,\r\nshould be objected against. And is it not very proper that we should\r\nexercise Kindness and Generosity to the poor Natives, when there is a\r\nstrong Probability of its being of very happy Consequence both to them\r\nand us?\r\n\r\nA great deal of Kindness and Generosity has been exercised towards\r\nthe River _Indians_ at _Housatunnuk_, by this _Government_, by the\r\nhonourable _Corporation_ at Home, by their honourable and reverend\r\n_Commissioners_ at _Boston_, by the Rev. Mr. _Hollis_, by the Rev. Mr.\r\n_Sergeant_, Mr. _Woodbridge_, and others; and the Consequence has been\r\nvery happy as to them; they are brought to the Knowledge of the Gospel,\r\nand to a Christian Profession; and many of them, we hope, to the saving\r\nKnowledge of God. We also have found the Benefit of this kind Usage of\r\nthem; for thereby they are become our hearty Friends, are united to us\r\nin their Affections, and were a Means, in the Hand of Providence, of\r\ncovering our most Western Frontiers the last War. And were the like\r\nKindness shewn by us to other Tribes, is there not Room to hope that\r\nthe Effects might be alike happy? If Townships, suitable for _Indians_\r\nto settle in, were provided in our Frontiers, and it were proposed\r\nto them, that if they would come and settle in them, they should not\r\nonly enjoy the Land as their own, but also have a Minister supported\r\namong them to instruct them in the Christian Religion; and also a\r\nSchool-Master to teach their Children to read and write; would not this\r\ninduce many of them, especially of the better Sort, to come and settle\r\nin our Borders? And would they not cover our Frontiers in case of a\r\nWar with _France_?\r\n\r\nWhat has been done for the _Indians_ at _Stockbridge_, has doubtless\r\nbeen much observed and approved of by the _Natives_ far and near. That\r\nthere is a School set up at _Canada_, in Imitation of Mr. _Sergeant_’s\r\nSchool at _Stockbridge_, and a large Number of Scholars in it, we have\r\nheard and receive for Truth. That the _French_, who esteem Ignorance to\r\nbe the Mother of Devotion, and do not desire to teach the _Indians_ any\r\nThing more than to say their Beads, and to cross themselves, have done\r\nthis out of Choice, is not at all likely. They do not desire that their\r\n_Indians_ should become a knowing People. But yet, being sensible that\r\nthe Report of Mr. _Sergeant_’s School had spread itself far and wide,\r\nand that their _Indians_ were pleased with the Method the _English_ had\r\ntaken to furnish the _Natives_ with Knowledge, they apprehended, that\r\nunless something like it were done among them, there would be Danger\r\nof the _Indians_ repairing to us for Instruction, and to prevent this,\r\nand to engage them to themselves, they set up their School. This, I\r\nconjecture, is the Truth of the Case. And if so, it is manifest that\r\nthe _Indians_ are inclined to seek after Knowledge; and therefore would\r\nbe disposed to hearken to such kind and generous Proposals, if they\r\nwere made to them. And who can tell but that this, that, or the other\r\nTribe, would gladly settle such Towns, if they were invited to it in a\r\nproper Manner?\r\n\r\n3. Another Step, and perhaps the most promising one we can take, to\r\nengage the _Indians_ in Friendship with us is, to send Missionaries\r\namong their respective Tribes, Ministers and Schoolmasters, to instruct\r\nthem in the Principles, and to persuade them to the Practice of\r\nChristianity. Tho’ they have so long lived near us, and been conversant\r\nwith us, yet they remain ignorant of the Way of Salvation, Strangers\r\nto the Gospel, and are perishing for lack of Knowledge: A Case that\r\nmight well move our Pity and Compassion towards them, and put us upon\r\ndoing what we can for their Relief. And whether our former Neglect of\r\nThings of this Nature has not been provoking to Heaven, may be worthy\r\nof our serious Enquiry.\r\n\r\nThe Interest the Rev. Mr. _Barclay_ had in the _Mohawks_, while he was\r\nwith them, the Reformation of Manners he wrought among them, their\r\nWillingness to receive Instruction, and their Engagedness to prosecute\r\nLearning, are a plain Indication that faithful Missionaries would be\r\nwelcome to them. And the _Five Nations_ being nearest us, and their\r\nFriendship of very great Consequence, it might be proper to begin with\r\nthem: And what has been done among them by Mr. _Barclay_ and others,\r\nmight be no small Help in the Case. If we should send Persons well\r\nqualified for the Business to reside among them, and support them well,\r\nthere would be no Foundation for any Jealousy that we have an ill\r\nDesign upon them, and if at any time such Jealousies should arise, they\r\nwould soon subside, upon the _Indians_ having a little Experience of\r\nour Kindness and Friendship to them. The prudent Conduct and faithful\r\nLabours of such Missionaries might, by the Blessing of God, serve to\r\nremove their Barbarity, correct their Manners, reform their Lives,\r\npromote in them virtuous Sentiments, and by Degrees form them to true\r\nReligion. This we may hope would be the happy Event, with Respect to\r\nmany of them, tho’ not to all; and if, by much Labour and Expence, it\r\nmight be brought to pass, should we not find our Account in it; for\r\nwhat would be the Charge of supporting a few Missionaries, compared\r\nwith that of an _Indian_ War? And is there not great Probability that\r\nsuch Measures would in a few Years Time attach them to us in a hearty\r\nFriendship? And if the _Five Nations_, who are a Terror to, and have in\r\ngreat Measure the Command of, other Tribes, were indeed our Friends,\r\nand made so by such Obligations laid upon them, would it not be an\r\neffectual Means of restraining other _Indians_ from giving us Trouble\r\nin case of a War?\r\n\r\nThe general Objection here, I am sensible, will be;--There is no\r\nLikelihood of succeeding, and therefore it is not worth While to make\r\nany Trial; it would only be to spend Labour and Money to no good\r\nPurpose. To which I reply,\r\n\r\nHow can we draw the Conclusion before we have made the Experiment? Have\r\nwe ever made any proper Trial, and found ourselves disappointed? And\r\ncan it be looked upon just to draw such a Conclusion, in a Case of such\r\nImportance, unless we had better Grounds for it?\r\n\r\nIt is true, Mr. _Sergeant_ made a Visit to the _Susquehanna Indians_,\r\nMr. _Brainard_ also, in his Day, did the same, without Success; but we\r\nknow that the Excuse those _Indians_ made was, that they held their\r\nLands of the _Five Nations_, and therefore could not comply with such\r\na Motion, till their Consent was first obtained. And besides, shall\r\nwe esteem two or three Visits made by private Persons a sufficient\r\nTrial in this Case? Sufficient indeed it was to shew that those good\r\nGentlemen were possest of an excellent Spirit, and of a laudable Zeal\r\nfor the Good of the poor Natives; but yet I apprehend not sufficient to\r\ndiscourage further Attempts. If those Gentlemen, who went in a private\r\nCapacity, had sustained a publick Character, perhaps they had been more\r\nregarded. But however, when we have used our best Endeavours, and they\r\nindeed prove unsuccessful, we may be excusable; but can we look upon\r\nourselves so, if we sit still, and use no Endeavours for the Help of\r\nthose poor benighted People?\r\n\r\nIf proper Attempts should be made for Christianizing the _Five\r\nNations_, there would, I am sensible, some notable Difficulties lie in\r\nthe Way, but yet perhaps none but what might be surmounted.\r\n\r\nOne Difficulty that would doubtless attend such a laudable Undertaking,\r\nwould arise from those who maintain a private Trade among them, from\r\nwhich they reap great Gain; especially by the Article of Rum, too\r\nmuch of which they convey to them, and by the Influence of which the\r\n_Indians_ are easily defrauded.\r\n\r\nThese Traders would be very sensible, that if Christianity should\r\nprevail among those _Nations_, the _Hope of their Gain_ would be\r\n_gone_, and _seeing by this Craft they have their Wealth_, they would\r\nuse their utmost Endeavours to dissuade the _Indians_ from embracing\r\nthe Ways of Religion. They in Fact did so at _Housatunnuk_, where the\r\nNumber of _Indians_ was small, and their Trade not so considerable.\r\nHow much more then will they do it, if Endeavours should be used to\r\nconvert the _Mohawks_, whose Trade is vastly more advantageous? But as\r\nthe _Indians_ at _Housatunnuk_, by Mr. _Sergeant_’s Help, saw thro’ the\r\nArtifice they used, and were made sensible of the selfish Views of the\r\nTraders, so doubtless the _Five Nations_ may easily be informed, and\r\nthe Obstruction soon removed.\r\n\r\nAnother Difficulty will arise from the false Insinuations of _Romish_\r\nEmissaries, who will not fail to tell them, that we are about to\r\nteach them a false Religion, and if they hearken to us, they will all\r\ncertainly be damned. But when those _Indians_ are properly informed of\r\nthe Conduct of the _French_, and other Roman Catholicks, how they deny\r\nthe Use of the Bible to the common People among themselves, and that\r\nthey have no Design to acquaint the _Indians_ with the Word of God:\r\nAnd on the other Hand, that our Design is not to impose upon them, but\r\nto open the Bible to them, to enable them to read it, and to judge for\r\nthemselves; will not this satisfy them of our honest Intentions towards\r\nthem, and of the Safety and Propriety of their examining Things, that\r\nthey may form a Judgment for themselves?\r\n\r\nA third, and perhaps much the greatest Difficulty that would attend\r\nthis good Design is, that those _Indians_ esteem themselves Christians\r\nalready, and value themselves upon their being as good Christians as\r\ntheir Neighbours. Mr. _Sergeant_, in his Journal of _November_ 25,\r\n1734, says,--‘The _Mohawks_ are generally Professors of Christianity,\r\nbut for want of Instruction have but little of it in Reality.--’\r\nThey are so ignorant of the Principles of Religion, that they know\r\nnot the Difference between one who is baptized, and calls himself a\r\nChristian, and one who lives agreeably to the Rules Christ has given us\r\nto walk by. They are not sensible of the Necessity of being conformed\r\nto those Rules of Virtue and Holiness which Christ has prescribed.\r\n_Romish_ Emissaries have baptized some of them, others (as I have been\r\ninformed) have been baptized by _Dutch_ Ministers; and they esteem\r\nit a Privilege belonging to them to have their Children baptized,\r\nwhenever they present them, without any Regard being had, either to\r\nthe Qualifications of the Parent, or the religious Education of the\r\nChild. When the Rev. Mr. _Spencer_ was among them a few Years ago, they\r\nwere much displeased that he declined baptizing some Children, whose\r\nParents were notoriously ignorant, vicious and wicked. Some _Indians_\r\nfrom _Canada_, who had an _English_ Woman to their Mother, came a few\r\nYears past to _Westfield_ to visit their _English_ Relations there,\r\nand while they staid at that Place, they had a Child born, and were\r\nmuch offended with the Rev. Mr. _Balantine_, who declined baptizing\r\nof it, as they desired. Since the Rev. Mr. _Edwards_ has been at\r\n_Stockbridge_, one of the _Mohawks_ residing there had a Child born,\r\nand was highly affronted because Mr. _Edwards_ did not baptize it upon\r\nhis Desire. From these Instances it is evident, that they account their\r\nChildren have Right to Baptism, whenever they desire it. And being\r\nbaptized, they esteem them good Christians, whatever their Conversation\r\nmay be; for they derive their Notions of Christianity, not from the\r\nBible (to which they are Strangers) but from the Example of the _Dutch_\r\nand _French_, with whom they are conversant, and who profess themselves\r\nto be Christians.\r\n\r\nAnd so far forth as being baptized, in the forementioned Manner, and\r\ncalling themselves Christians will make them so, they are so to be\r\nesteemed. Now these Things being so, it may prove a difficult Thing\r\nto make them sensible, that Drunkenness, and other vicious Practices,\r\nare inconsistent with Christianity; because those Christians, who fall\r\nunder their Observation, give them an Example of Vice, and go such\r\nLengths therein.\r\n\r\nBut yet I apprehend this Difficulty might also be removed, by giving\r\nthem a just and true Account of the Nature and Extent of the Christian\r\nReligion, by informing them what the Will of _Christ_ is; how he\r\nexpects that we should be conformed to his Likeness, and to his Laws.\r\nThe _Indians_ are as capable of hearing Reasons, and giving them\r\ntheir Weight, as other Men; and it is because they know not what\r\nChristianity is, that they esteem themselves Christians, in their\r\npresent Circumstances. When they are made acquainted with the Terms of\r\nSalvation, proposed in the Gospel, and what they must do that they may\r\ninherit eternal Life; when they are well instructed in the Doctrines of\r\n_Christ_, they will be sensible that the Religion which they now have,\r\nis little or nothing like that which is taught by the Gospel. When Mr.\r\n_Edwards_ refused to baptize a _Mohawk_ Child born at _Stockbridge_\r\n(which I have before mentioned) and they were very much displeased with\r\nhim on that Account, he went to them, gave them the Reasons of his\r\nConduct, and informed them as clearly as he was able, of the Nature\r\nand End of Baptism: Those _Indians_ received the Force of his Reasons,\r\nand appeared to be satisfied and contented, when he had taken Pains to\r\ninform them. And I doubt not but proper Instruction and Information\r\nwould remove the Difficulty I have been speaking of.\r\n\r\nTho’ Christianizing those _Indians_ may prove a difficult Work, yet if\r\nour Endeavours might, by the divine Blessing, be succeeded, would not\r\nthe Advantage thence arising to them, and us, more than compensate the\r\nPains and Expence we should be at? And is there not so much Ground to\r\nhope for Success, as should induce us to make the Experiment?\r\n\r\nI shall now conclude, by briefly suggesting a few Things, not yet\r\nmentioned, the serious Consideration of which may excite us to use our\r\nbest Endeavours for the Conversion of the neighbouring _Indians_ to the\r\nChristian Faith.\r\n\r\n1. And in the first Place, should not the Consideration of the divine\r\nBounty and Goodness, bestowed upon us, excite us to employ Part of that\r\nundeserved Goodness to promote the Knowledge of God, our bountiful\r\nBenefactor, among those who are destitute of it? Thro’ the undeserved\r\nFavour and Blessing of God, we have been prosperous in our secular\r\nAffairs, succeeded in our Husbandry, Trade, &c. and are become a\r\nwealthy People: And, were we as willing as we are able, might we not\r\nspare large Sums for the Propagation of the Gospel among the Heathen?\r\nOught we not then to shew our Gratitude to the glorious Author of\r\nall our Comforts, by employing a Part of his Bounty to promote the\r\nRedeemer’s Kingdom? Is it not fit that we should thus _honour the Lord\r\nwith our Substance_? Does it not lie as a Reproach upon us, who make\r\nan high Profession, that we expend so little to promote the Knowledge\r\nof God among the _Natives_, and so much to ill Purposes? Were what we\r\nemploy in unnecessary Expences, by which Pride and Luxury are indulged\r\nand nourished, employed in the laudable Method I am recommending; would\r\nit not be sufficient well to support a Multitude of Missionaries among\r\nthe neighbouring Tribes? Would it not probably be a Means of turning\r\nmany of them _from the Power of Satan to God_? And would it not be\r\n_an Odour of a sweet Smell, a Sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to\r\nGod_[1]? And seeing God, by his Blessings, has enabled us to contribute\r\nto such a good Design, should we not chearfully give of our Substance,\r\nfor the spiritual Benefit of the perishing Heathen?\r\n\r\n2. Should not the Light and Grace of the Gospel, which we, thro’ divine\r\nGoodness enjoy, be a stronger Argument still to excite us to endeavour\r\nthe Conversion of the Heathen?\r\n\r\nA few Generations back we were in a State of Heathenism, as they\r\nnow are: _Aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel--and without God\r\nin the World_[2]. But, thro’ divine Goodness, _the Day-spring from\r\non High has visited us_, and we enjoy the Light and Privileges of\r\nthe Gospel-Dispensation. Seeing then God has had Compassion on us,\r\nand bestowed upon us those richest Blessings, ought we not to have\r\nCompassion on the neighbouring Heathen, and use our best Endeavours\r\nthat they also may be made Partakers of the Light and Blessings of the\r\nGospel?\r\n\r\n3. Should we not be moved to such charitable Endeavours from the\r\nConsideration of the wretched and forlorn Circumstances, in which the\r\npoor _Natives_ appear before our Eyes? We often behold those piteous\r\nObjects, appearing half naked, and almost starved; which is the Effect\r\nof their vicious Way of Living. We see them also in the Depths of\r\nIgnorance and Barbarity; wholly unacquainted with the Way of Salvation,\r\nand quite unconcerned for their eternal Good: And yet their Powers,\r\nboth of Body and Mind, are not inferior to our own. Were they brought\r\nto Civility and Industry, they might stand upon equal Ground with us,\r\nrespecting the Comforts of Life; and were they instructed in divine\r\nThings, made acquainted with the great and important Truths of the\r\nGospel, they might stand as fair for the Kingdom of Heaven as we do.\r\nShould not our Eyes therefore affect our Hearts, when we behold them\r\nin such miserable Circumstances? And should we not exert ourselves in\r\nall proper Ways for their Help? Did the Wounds of the poor Man _half\r\ndead_, who _fell among Thieves_, plead with so much Eloquence for\r\nhuman Compassion, as the unhappy State of the poor _Natives_ does for\r\nChristian Charity? And if the Compassion of a _Samaritan_ was moved by\r\nthe former, how much more should the Bowels of a _Christian_ be moved\r\nby the latter?\r\n\r\n4. The noble Example of some generous and pious Persons, at Home, may\r\nwell excite us to liberal Contributions for the Benefit of the poor\r\nHeathen.\r\n\r\nNot only publick Societies, but also private Persons, in\r\n_Great-Britain_, have generously and liberally contributed for the\r\nBenefit of the _Natives_, in this distant Part of the World. Tho’\r\nthey are at 3000 Miles Distance, and never beheld, as we do, those\r\nmiserable Objects; yet, from a truly pious and generous Spirit, they\r\nhave sent over their liberal Contributions, that the Heathen, by their\r\nMeans, may be informed in the Way of Life. _Verily, they shall not\r\nlose their Reward._ A noble Example they set before us, most worthy\r\nour Imitation: And how can we excuse ourselves, if we neglect to copy\r\nafter it? Some indeed may plead their Inability, but this is not the\r\nCase of all. Are there not among us many wealthy Merchants and Traders?\r\nAre there not also many Farmers, who abound in Wealth, upon the Lands\r\nwhich were, a few Years ago, the Property of the _Indians_, who now\r\nstand in Need of their Charity? Should not such Persons be moved, by\r\nthe generous Examples of others, to help forward the noble Design of\r\nconverting the Heathen? Yea, are not the People in general able to do\r\nsomething to help forward so good a Design? And will it not lie as a\r\nReproach upon us, if we, who make a high Profession of Religion, prove\r\nvoid of Charity, when we are so loudly called to the Exercise of it,\r\nnot only by the laudable Example of generous Benefactors at Home; but\r\nalso by the perishing Circumstances of the neighbouring _Indians_?\r\n\r\nI shall only add my hearty Wishes, that this _American_ Continent,\r\nwhich, for Ages unknown, has been a Seat of Darkness, and _full of\r\nthe Habitations of Cruelty_, may become a Scene of Light and Love;\r\nthat the Heathen in it, who have been wont to thirst after Blood,\r\nmay _hunger and thirst after Righteousness; That the Wilderness and\r\nsolitary Place may be glad for them, the Desart rejoice and blossom\r\nas the Rose;----That the Glory of_ Lebanon _may be given unto it, the\r\nExcellency of_ Carmel _and_ Sharon; _That they may see the Glory of the\r\nLord, and the Excellency of our God_[3].\r\n\r\n_FINIS._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Phil. iv. 18.\r\n\r\n[2] Ephes. ii. 12.\r\n\r\n[3] Isaiah xxxv. 1, 2.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\nFootnotes have been moved to the end of the text and relabeled\r\nconsecutively through the document.\r\n\r\nPunctuation has been made consistent.\r\n\r\nVariations in spelling and hyphenation were retained as they appear in\r\nthe original publication, except that obvious typographical errors have\r\nbeen corrected.",
