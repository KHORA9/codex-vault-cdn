Remsburg\r\nPresident Of American Secular Union\r\n\r\n\"This effort to right the wrongs of Thomas Paine is, in my opinion, a\r\nservice to mankind.\"--Andrew D. White, LL.D., First President of Cornell\r\nUniversity, Minister to Russia, and Ambassador to Germany.\r\n\r\n1917\r\n\r\nIN MEMORY OF THOMAS \"CLIO\" RICKMAN, WILLIAM COBBETT, GILBERT VALE,\r\nHORACE SEAVER, ROBERT G. INGERSOLL, MONCURE D. CONWAY, THADDEUS B.\r\nWAKEMAN and EUGENE M. MACDONALD, noble defenders while living of the\r\nmuch maligned dead, this appreciation of our nation's founder and the\r\nworld's greatest apostle of liberty is reverently inscribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS PAINE, THE APOSTLE OF LIBERTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM time immemorial men have observed the natal days of their gods and\r\nheroes. A few weeks ago Christians celebrated the birthday of a god. We\r\ncome to celebrate the birthday of a man.\r\n\r\nWithin the brief space of twenty-five days occur the anniversaries of\r\nthe births of the three most remarkable men that have appeared on this\r\ncontinent--Paine, Washington and Lincoln--the Creator, the Defender and\r\nthe Savior of our Republic. To do honor to the memory of the first\r\nof these--to acknowledge our indebtedness to him as a patriot and\r\nphilosopher, and to extol his virtues as a man--have we assembled here.\r\nWe come the more willingly and our exercises will be characterized by\r\na deeper earnestness because the one whose merits we celebrate has been\r\nthe victim of almost infinite injustice. In the popular mind to utter a\r\nword in his behalf has been to apologize for wrong--to declare yourself\r\nthe friend of Paine has been to declare yourself the enemy of man. The\r\nworld is not prepared to do him full justice yet. Priestcraft, still\r\npowerful, uses all its power to prejudice the public mind against\r\nhim and in too many hearts, where love and gratitude should dwell,\r\ningratitude and hatred have their home. There are those who will condemn\r\nthis meeting in his name today and some of you may spurn the blossoms I\r\nhave culled to place upon his tomb.\r\n\r\nBut is it a crime to defend the dead? Has the court of Death issued an\r\ninjunction restraining us from pleading the cause of the departed? We\r\ndefend from the assaults of calumny the fair fame of the living, and not\r\nmore sacred are the reputations of the living than of the absent dead\r\nwhose voiceless lips can utter no defense. The lips of Thomas Paine have\r\nlong been dumb; but mine are not, and while I live I shall defend him.\r\nAs Rizpah stood by the bodies of her murdered sons, keeping back the\r\nbirds of prey, so will I stand by the memory of this good man and drive\r\nback the foul vultures that feast their greedy selves and feed their\r\nstarving broods on dead men's characters.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of January, 1737, at Thetford, England, Thomas Paine was\r\nborn. He was of Quaker parentage. Like nearly all of earth's illustrious\r\nsons, he was of humble origin. At an early age he left the paternal roof\r\nand began alone life's struggle,--serving in the British navy, teaching\r\nin London, engaging in mercantile pursuits, and performing the duties of\r\nexciseman.\r\n\r\nWhile in London he formed the acquaintance of the learned Franklin, who\r\ninduced him to cross the ocean and cast his lot with the people of the\r\nNew World. He comes to America toward the close of 1774. A year of quiet\r\nobservation enables him to grasp the situation here. He sees thirteen\r\nfeeble colonies struggling against a powerful monarchy; he sees a tyrant\r\nwhom the world styles \"king\" trampling the fair form of Liberty beneath\r\nhis feet; he sees his subjects crouching and cringing before the throne,\r\npleading in vain for a redress of wrongs. Separation and Independence\r\nhave not yet been proposed. It is true that Lexington, and Concord, and\r\nBunker Hill have passed into history; it is true that Patrick Henry,\r\nJames Otis, John Hancock, and the Adamses have fearlessly denounced the\r\nodious measures of the British ministry; yet up to the very close of\r\n1775, not a voice has been raised in favor of Independence. A redress\r\nof grievances is all that the boldest have demanded. But the current of\r\nhistory is to be turned. Rebellion is to be changed to Revolution. With\r\nthe firm belief that right will triumph, Paine marshals the legions of\r\nthought that spring from his prolific brain and on the first of January,\r\n1776, moves in solid columns against this citadel of tyranny. The shock\r\nis irresistible. The solid masonry gives way, and falls before his\r\nfierce assault. Into the breach thus made an eager people rush, and on\r\nthe ruins plant the unsoiled banner of a new Republic.\r\n\r\nThat the Fourth of July, 1776, would not have witnessed the Declaration\r\nof Independence but for the timely appearance of Paine's \"Common Sense,\"\r\nno candid student of history will for a moment question. This book first\r\nsuggested American Independence; in this book appeared, for the first\r\ntime, \"The Free and Independent States of America.\" Nor did Paine's\r\nlabors end with the publication of this work. He was the inspiring\r\ngenius of the long war that followed. When Washington's little army was\r\nhurled from Long Island, when despondency filled every heart, and all\r\nseemed lost, Paine came to the rescue with the first number of his\r\n\"Crisis,\" in which were couched those thrilling words, \"These are\r\nthe times that try men's souls.\" His pamphlet, by orders of the\r\ncommander-in-chief, was read at the head of each regiment. It was\r\nalso sent broadcast over the land. The effect was magical; into the\r\ndispirited ranks is breathed new life, and in the minds of the people\r\nplanted a determination never to give up the struggle. At critical\r\nperiods during the war number after number of this brave work appeared\r\nuntil, at last, he could triumphantly say, \"The times that tried men's\r\nsouls are over, and the greatest and completest revolution the world\r\never knew, gloriously and happily accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nThe pen of Paine was as mighty as the sword of Washington. \"Common\r\nSense\" was the glorious sun that evolved a new political world; each\r\nnumber of the \"Crisis\" a brilliant satellite that helped to illumine\r\nthis New World's long night of Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn the Old World liberty remained, as it still remains to a large\r\nextent, yet to be wearisomely achieved. In France the people were\r\nstruggling against a corrupt and oppressive government. Paine enlisted\r\nhis services in the cause of freedom there. He advocated a Republic,\r\nand organized the first Republican society in France. But Louis was\r\npermitted to resume his reign, and tranquility having been for a brief\r\nseason restored, Paine went to his native England, where, in reply to\r\nBurke's \"Reflections on the French Revolution,\" appeared his \"Rights\r\nof Man.\" With a desperation characteristic of the detected robber the\r\nGovernment suppressed his work; but not until it had kindled a fire in\r\nEurope which tyrants have not yet succeeded in extinguishing and in the\r\nglare of whose unquenchable flames may be read the doom of monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe storms of revolution bursting forth afresh, Paine again repaired to\r\nFrance. A joyous reception awaited his arrival at Calais. As his vessel\r\nentered the harbor a hundred cannon thundered \"Welcome!\" As he stepped\r\nupon the shore a thousand voices shouted \"_Vive_ Thomas Paine!\" Bright\r\nflowers fell in showers around him; fair hands placed in his hat the\r\nnational cockade. An immense meeting assembled in his honor. Over the\r\nchair he sat in was placed the bust of Mirabeau with the colors of\r\nFrance, England and America united. All France was ready to honor her\r\ndefender.\r\n\r\nThree departments, the Oise, the Pas-de-Calais, and the Puy-de-Dome,\r\neach chose him for its representative. He accepted the honor from\r\nCalais and proceeded to Paris. His entry into the French capital was a\r\ntriumphal one. He was received as a hero,--an intellectual hero who\r\non the field of mental combat had vanquished Europe's most brilliant\r\nchampion of monarchy, and vindicated before the tribunal of the world\r\nmankind's eternal rights.\r\n\r\nHe took his seat in the National Convention. A stupendous task devolved\r\nupon this body--the formation of a new Constitution for Republican\r\nFrance. Its most illustrious statesmen and its wisest legislators must\r\nbe chosen to prepare it. A committee of nine was named: Thomas Paine,\r\nDanton, Condorcet, Brissot, Barrere, Vergniaud, Petion, Gensonne, and\r\nthe Abbe Sieyes. To Paine and Condorcet chiefly was the work of drafting\r\nit assigned by their colleagues.\r\n\r\nThen came the trial of Louis XVI and the beginning of those turbulent\r\nscenes which culminated in the Reign of Terror. The convention was\r\nclamoring for blood. Paine had been one of the foremost in overthrowing\r\nthe monarchy. He believed the king to have been tyrannical,--to have\r\nbeen the pliant tool of a corrupt nobility, and of a still more corrupt\r\npriesthood. But he did not deem him deserving of death, nor did he\r\nbelieve that the best interests of France would be subserved by such\r\nharsh measures. But the Terrorists threatened with vengeance all who\r\nshould dare to oppose them. To plead the cause of the king might be to\r\nshare his fate. A vote by any member in favor of saving his life might\r\nbring an overwhelming vote against that member's own life. They had\r\nresolved that the king should die, and led by such men as Robespierre\r\nand Marat, there were assembled the most determined and the most\r\ndangerous men of France. The galleries, too, were filled with an excited\r\nmob of fifteen hundred--many of them hired assassins, fresh from the\r\nSeptember massacre. \"We vote,\" protested Lanjuinais when the balloting\r\ncommenced, \"under the daggers and the cannon of the factions.\" In this\r\nperilous position what course would Paine pursue? Would he, like others,\r\nquietly acquiesce in these unjust proceedings? He had never yet faltered\r\nin his purpose of pursuing what he deemed the right. Would he shrink\r\nfrom danger now? No! above the wild storm of that enraged assembly,\r\nthrough his interpreter, rose the voice of this brave man in powerful,\r\neloquent appeals in behalf of mercy. \"Destroy the King,\" in effect, he\r\nsaid, \"but save the man! Strike the crown, but spare the heart!\"\r\n\r\nHe pleads in vain; the king must die. \"Death within four-and-twenty\r\nhours,\" is the decree. Amid the insults and execrations of a frenzied\r\nmob Louis is torn from the arms of his queen and children and hurried to\r\nthe scaffold.\r\n\r\nThe Mountain has triumphed. The Jacobins, infuriated by the taste of a\r\nking's blood, will next devour their fellow-members. The Girondins, the\r\nheart and brains of France, are expelled from the convention, dragged\r\nto prison and to the guillotine. Paine's plea for mercy can not be\r\nforgiven. He is imprisoned; sentence of death is finally pronounced\r\nagainst him; the hour for his execution, with that of his\r\nfellow-prisoners, is set. Fortuitously he escapes. In summoning the\r\nvictims for execution he is overlooked. Soon after, and before the\r\nmistake is discovered, the bloody Robespierre is overthrown, and his own\r\nneck receives the blow he meant for Paine. The fall of Robespierre stems\r\nthe crimson torrent and, in time, secures for Paine his freedom. His\r\nimprisonment has lasted nearly a year, a year never to be forgotten, a\r\nyear of chaos, from which is to arise a fairer and a better France.\r\n\r\nLet us contemplate, for a moment, this bloody and protracted drama. Let\r\nus, in imagination, visit this death-stricken Paris. Buildings--once\r\npalaces--have been transformed into prisons. Thousands are crowded\r\nwithin their walls; beings of both sexes, and of every age and rank;\r\ngrayhaired men who look with stolid indifference upon the scenes around\r\nthem; youth, pale with fear; heroic types of manhood pacing to and fro\r\nwith all the bearing of conquerors; frail women, whose swollen eyes,\r\nthose tear-stained windows of the soul, faintly reveal the heart's\r\nfierce agony within! The scene is changed. All is bustle and confusion.\r\nA morbid and excited crowd is gathering; the death tumbrils go rumbling\r\nby toward the Place de la Revolution; the groans of men, the shrieks of\r\nwomen, rend the air and throw a shade of sadness over all deeper than\r\nmidnight's gloom.\r\n\r\nAgain the scene shifts. The bustle is over now; the crowd has dispersed;\r\nthose shrieks and groans are hushed. But that huge pile of headless\r\ntrunks; the headsman's sack; those pools of blood; that blood-stained\r\ninstrument, to whose edge still cling the straggling hairs of its\r\nvictims, the golden threads of youth mingled with the silver threads of\r\nage, these remain--grim fragments of the feast where this French Saturn\r\nmade his last repast.\r\n\r\nDay after day this carnival of death goes on. Danton, Brissot, and many\r\nmore of the best men of France are butchered; Roland and Condorcet die\r\nby their own hands; Talleyrand is a refugee in America, and Lafayette\r\npines in the dungeon vaults of Austria.\r\n\r\nMany noble women, too, are sacrificed. Marie Antoinette follows her\r\nLouis to the scaffold. In the Conciergerie, companions for a time, are\r\nheld captive two of the purest and noblest of women,--the lovely and\r\namiable Josephine Beauhamais, destined to become Napoleon's queen, and\r\nthe beautiful and gifted Madame Roland, whose innocent blood must wet\r\nthe cruel knife of the guillotine.\r\n\r\nSuch was the French Revolution,--\"A mighty truth clad in\r\nhell-fire,\"--the bloodiest, and yet the brightest page in the history\r\nof France. It might have been a bloodless one, it might have been\r\na brighter one, had the wise and moderate counsels of Thomas Paine\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nIn the shadow of death the crowning effort of his life, the \"Age of\r\nReason,\" was composed. His pen had given kingcraft a mortal hurt;\r\npriestcraft must be destroyed. This book has filled die Orthodox world\r\nwith terror. Around it has raged one of the fiercest intellectual\r\nconflicts of the age. All the artillery of Christendom has been brought\r\nto bear upon it; but without effect. Firm, impregnable, like some\r\nGibraltar, it still stands unharmed.\r\n\r\nBowed with the weight of sixty-six years Paine returned to America.\r\nHere the evening of his life was passed,--embittered by a world's\r\ningratitude.\r\n\r\n    \"Men never know their saviors when they come.\"\r\n\r\nThe apostle of liberty, of mercy, and of truth, became successively a\r\nmartyr to each. For espousing the cause of liberty England declared\r\nhim an outlaw; for advocating mercy France gave him a prison; and for\r\nproclaiming the truth America placed upon his aged head the cruel crown\r\nof thorns.\r\n\r\nBut death came at last and brought relief to the persecuted sage. On a\r\nbright June morning (June 8), in 1809, the end came.\r\n\r\nYes, death came. But with it came no fears. No banished Hagar with\r\nfamishing infant haunted him; from the desolate ruins of those Midianite\r\nhomes came no phantoms to strike his soul with terror; no Uriah's ghost\r\nstood before his bedside and would not down; the hand that with no\r\nweapon but the pen had made priests and monarchs tremble, now growing\r\ncold and pallid, was not stained with the blood of a wile or child;\r\nno agonizing shrieks of a burning Servetus rang in his dying ears.\r\nTempestuous as life's voyage had been, the old man readied his port in\r\npeace. Nature, whom he had deified, fondly and pityingly held him in\r\nher all-embracing arms, and soothed him in that last sad hour as with\r\na mother's love. The morning sun looked kindly down and kissed his\r\nthrobbing temples; gentle breezes, fragrant with the odors of a thousand\r\nroses, fanned his fevered brow; joyous birds, whose songs he loved so\r\nwell, came to his window and sang their cheeriest notes; while faithful\r\nfriends were at his bedside, ministering to every want. And so, bravely\r\nand peacefully, with that serenity of soul which only the conscious of a\r\nwell-spent life can give, the grand old patriot passed away.\r\n\r\nThus have I briefly traced the public career of Thomas Paine,--a career\r\nin which his steadfast devotion to manly principles ranks him with the\r\nworld's worthiest heroes. His private life was not less honorable. In\r\nhis moral nature were united the noblest traits that adorn the human\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nHis philanthrophy was bounded only by the limits of the world in which\r\nhe lived Jew and Mohammedan, Christian and Infidel, Caucasian and\r\nMongolian, the despised negro and the rude Indian, all to him were\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nHis charity was of the broadest kind. He was ever ready to share his\r\nlast dollar or his last comfort with the poor and distressed, and this\r\nregardless as to whether they were friends or foes. When his Republican\r\nfriend, Bonneville, was crushed and impoverished by Napoleon, Paine gave\r\nto his family an asylum in America, and willed to them a part of his\r\nestate. When a brutal English officer assaulted him in Paris--and to\r\nstrike a deputy the penalty was death--he saved him from the guillotine,\r\nand finding him penniless, from his own purse paid his passage home to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nHis patriotism was never questioned. Many have won the name of patriot\r\nwhose services to their country have been inspired by mere selfish\r\nmotives; but with him, fame, wealth, comfort, all were sacrificed for\r\nhis country's welfare. Throughout that eight year's struggle, his life,\r\nhis time, his talents, all were at her service. And, whether serving as\r\naid-de-camp to General Greene in that terrible campaign of '76; filling\r\nwith ability the important post of Secretary to the Committee on Foreign\r\nAffairs; with Laurens at the French court negotiating loans for his\r\ngovernment; or cheering the despondent and nerving them up to deeds of\r\nvalor,--he was at all times, and in every situation, the same modest,\r\nmagnanimous, unflinching patriot.\r\n\r\nIn his disinterestedness he stands alone. At the beginning of the\r\nRevolutionary struggle he was a poor author, lacking at times even the\r\nbare necessities of life. But he had the opportunity of becoming rich.\r\nThe enormous sale of \"Common Sense\" would of itself have secured for him\r\na handsome competence. But what did he do? did he secure for himself the\r\nprofits to which he was justly entitled? No! he presented to each of the\r\nthirteen colonies the copyright, and came out indebted to his printer\r\nfor the original edition. When his country languished for want of funds\r\nto pay her soldiers in the field he started a subscription that brought\r\nher more than a million, heading it with five hundred dollars, and\r\nlimited his gift to this because he had no more to give. When his\r\n\"Rights of Man\" was ready for the press he refused one thousand pounds\r\nfor the copyright and then gave it to the world.\r\n\r\nMoral courage was another prominent element in this great man's\r\ncharacter. His espousal of the cause of American Independence--a cause\r\nwhich no other man had up to that time dared to espouse--shows a lofty\r\nheroism; his attack upon monarchy, in the very capital of a monarchical\r\ngovernment, knowing, as he must have known, that every effort would be\r\nmade to crush him, was a grand exhibition of moral bravery, while\r\nhis publication of the \"Age of Reason\" was, in many respects, a more\r\ncourageous act than either. But it was in His heroic defense of Louis\r\nXVI that his moral courage shone with all the lustre of the sun. Search\r\nall the annals of the past and say if on the historian's page is found\r\none act, one single act, surpassing in moral sublimity that of Thomas\r\nPaine accepting a prison and, if need be, death, to save a fallen foe!\r\n\r\nIn the expression of his religious opinions no man has been more frank\r\nor explicit, while no man's religious opinions have been more grossly\r\nmisrepresented. What was his belief?\r\n\r\n\"I believe in one God and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\"I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious\r\nduties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make\r\nour fellow-creatures happy.\r\n\r\n\"The world is my country, to do good my religion.\"\r\n\r\nThis was his creed; and with a firm belief in the truth and justice of\r\nthis creed he lived and died.\r\n\r\nThere are, I regret to say, many good people who believe that Thomas\r\nPaine was a very bad man. They have heard this from the lips of those in\r\nwhose veracity they place implicit confidence. While from infancy they\r\nhave been taught to regard Jesus Christ as the mediator between man and\r\nGod, they have been led to consider Thomas Paine as a sort of negotiator\r\nbetween the Devil and man. Now, let me ask these people, do you know\r\nwhy Thomas Paine has been so bitterly assailed? You have heard various\r\ncharges preferred against him; but seriously, do you believe any of the\r\ncharges named sufficient to account for the intense, the bitter hatred\r\nthat has been manifested toward him? Have you never been impressed with\r\nthe thought that there might be something back of all this, some secret\r\ngrudge which your informants dare not mention? Let us notice briefly the\r\nfaults and vices imputed to him.\r\n\r\nYou have been told that he was a pauper, that he died in wretchedness\r\nand want. Those who told you this were certainly mistaken. The estate\r\npresented to him by New York, in consideration of his Revolutionary\r\nservices, was valued at $30,000, and the greater portion of this was\r\nremaining at his death. It is true that during his long and useful\r\ncareer he was many times in straitened circumstances; but this was\r\nthe result, not of improvidence, or reckless expenditure, but of\r\nthe devotion of his life to the cause of humanity instead of the\r\naccumulation of wealth. But what if he had died poor? Is poverty a\r\ncrime? Yes, were this true, is it a thing of which to boast, that in a\r\nChristian city, within the sound of forty church-bells, an old man was\r\nsuffered to lie neglected and alone, racked by the pangs of hunger and\r\ndisease, piteously pleading for a crust of bread, or a cup of cold water\r\nto cool his parched and fevered tongue; and do you mean to tell us that\r\nChristian charity the while stood by unmoved, mocked his sufferings, and\r\ndamned him when he died?\r\n\r\nYou have been told that he was a drunkard. A baser slander was never\r\nuttered. No human being ever saw Thomas Paine intoxicated. He was one\r\nof the most temperate of men. All of his neighbors and acquaintances\r\nindignantly denied the truth of this imputation. Gilbert Vale tells us\r\nthat he knew more than twenty persons who were intimately acquainted\r\nwith him and not one of whom ever saw him intoxicated. The proprietor of\r\nthe house in New York, a respectable inn at which Paine boarded in his\r\nlater years, says that of all his guests he was the most temperate. But\r\nsupposing that he was a drunkard. Is drunkenness so rare as to secure\r\nfor its victims an immortal notoriety? Are there no living drunkards for\r\nthese omnivorous creatures to devour, that, like hyenas, they must dig\r\ninto a drunkard's grave to fill their empty maws?\r\n\r\nYou have been told by the clergy that his writings are immoral. I defy\r\nthose who make this charge to point to one immoral sentence in all that\r\nhe has written. They cannot; and I further affirm that they dare not\r\npermit you to examine his writings and ascertain for yourselves the\r\ntruth or falsity of this assertion. You who have never read his works\r\nmay believe that they contain much that is bad. You may imagine that\r\na deadly serpent lurks within them. Let me assure you that there is\r\nnothing in them that can harm you. The highest moral tone pervades their\r\npages. They are full of charity, they glow with patriotism, they are\r\nwarm with love. Even yet, within their lids methinks I feel the beating\r\nof the generous heart of him who penned them, every throb marking an\r\naspiration for the welfare of his fellow-men. But admitting, for the\r\nsake of argument, that his writings are immoral. Does not the world teem\r\nwith immoral literature? Are there not hundreds of immoral writers even\r\namong the living? If so, why has all this wrath been concentrated upon\r\nPaine to the almost total exclusion of the rest?\r\n\r\nYou have been told that he was an Infidel. Infidel to what? In the\r\nChristian sense of this term he was. But what peculiar significance\r\ndo your informants attach to this fact? Are not three fourths of the\r\nworld's inhabitants Infidels? Do not the greatest scholars of the age\r\ngo far beyond him in Infidelity? Earth's wisest sons--those who\r\nhave contributed most to the wealth of science, and literature, and\r\nstatesmanship, have been these so-called Infidels. Yet Paine has been\r\ndenounced as if he were the only Infidel that ever lived.\r\n\r\nYou have been told that he recanted on his deathbed. In other words,\r\nthat he lived a hypocrite; that he only feigned Infidelity for the sake\r\nof being persecuted. A very plausible reason, surely. But this statement\r\nhas been widely circulated, and that, too, in spite of the fact that\r\nevery person who was with him during his dying hours pronounced it\r\nfalse,--those who sat by his bedside and heard every word that fell\r\nfrom his lips. It has ever been the custom of the church to make every\r\ndistinguished individual appear as an endorser of her dogmas. See\r\nthose insolent priests haunting the death chamber of Voltaire; see the\r\ncrucifix thrust into the hands of the dying Litre and the dead Sherman;\r\nsee the frantic efforts made to convince the world that Lincoln changed\r\nhis religious views and died a Christian. An honest Quaker who visited\r\nPaine daily during his last illness testified to having been offered\r\nmoney to publicly state that he recanted. But he refused. Others were\r\ndoubtless approached in the same manner, and with the same result.\r\nUnable to find a deathbed witness base enough to make so foul a charge,\r\nthe calumny was originated by one who did not see him die. A Christian's\r\nbrain conceived and bore that infamous falsehood; and black and hideous\r\nas the offspring was, nearly every orthodox clergyman was ready to serve\r\nit in the capacity of a faithful nurse. And in these nurses' arms it\r\nlived and died. Only a little while ago I saw one of them hugging to his\r\nbreast and endeavoring to resuscitate with holy breath the putrid corpse\r\nof this dead lie! But supposing that he did recant, that he acknowledged\r\nthe divinity of Christ. If he did this he died in the Christian faith.\r\nNow does the church treat deathbed penitents in the manner in which\r\nPaine has been treated? Has not every criminal that has repented in his\r\nlast hours, from the dying thief of nineteen hundred years ago to the\r\nlast murderer sent to Heaven, been held up as an object of admiration?\r\nWhy, then, denounce Paine for having, as they claim, renounced his\r\nInfidelity? O Consistency, thou art, indeed, a jewel!\r\n\r\nAnd now, assuming all these charges to be true, he would still have been\r\nnaught but a poor, drunken Infidel; and while this would have subjected\r\nhim to much harsh criticism while living, it would have been merely of a\r\nlocal character, and would have ceased when he was no more. Death would\r\nhave silenced censure, the mantle of charity would have been spread\r\nabove his grave, and the waves of oblivion would have rolled over his\r\nmemory long ago. Is it possible that all Christendom would have been so\r\ndeeply agitated, that the walls of her churches would have echoed every\r\nweek with the fierce anathemas thundered from a thousand pulpits against\r\nthe inanimate dust of a poor, drunken Infidel!\r\n\r\nThe conclusion, I think, must irresistibly force itself upon your minds\r\nthat these reputed faults do not constitute the real head and front\r\nof Thomas Paine's offending. There must be something else. What is it?\r\nWould you have the mystery solved? If so, read his, \"Age of Reason.\"\r\nRead it carefully, thoughtfully, critically; read it with your Bibles\r\nopen before you; read it in connection with the ablest refutations that\r\nhave been attempted against it. Do this, and the mystery will be solved.\r\nYou will then know why Thomas Paine has been so bitterly assailed.\r\n\r\nTwo champions meet in the arena of debate. One of them, is overwhelmed.\r\nSmiles and groans announce his discomfiture, while shouts of applause\r\nreward the triumph of his rival. Then one of them grows angry, and stung\r\nwith madness, drops the sword of argument and seizes in its stead the\r\nbludgeon of malice with which to assail his adversary. But which one\r\ndoes this, the successful or the defeated antagonist? I have somewhere\r\nread that \"the bird that soars on pinions strong and free and is not hit\r\nby the marksman's bullet is not discomposed'\"--that \"_it is the wounded\r\nbird that flutters!_\"\r\n\r\nThat Thomas Paine was not the poor, drunken, immoral wretch that\r\npriestly virulence represents him to have been, is dearly shown by\r\nthe esteem in which he was held by those who knew him best. Would\r\nDr. Franklin have retained the friendship of a poor, drunken, immoral\r\nwretch? Would Lord Erskine have defended against the government of\r\nEngland, a poor, drunken, immoral wretch? Would Bishop Watson have\r\ncrossed swords in theological disputation with a poor, drunken, immoral\r\nwretch? Would Napoleon Bonaparte, when in the zenith of his fame, have\r\ninvited to his table a poor, drunken, immoral wretch? Would France's\r\ngreatest women, Roland and De Stael, have stooped to pay the tribute\r\nof praise to a poor, drunken, immoral wretch? Would President Jefferson\r\nhave offered a national ship to bear to his home a poor, drunken,\r\nimmoral wretch? Would Washington have acknowledged as one of the most\r\npotent factors in achieving American Independence, the pen of a poor,\r\ndrunken, immoral wretch? Would the Congress of the United States and the\r\nNational Convention of France have bestowed gifts and conferred, honors\r\nupon a poor, drunken, immoral wretch? Impossible! Every fact connected\r\nwith his public life refutes these charges made against his private\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIn support of the claims that I have made for Thomas Paine, in\r\nrefutation of the calumnies that have been circulated against him, I\r\nbring the testimony of more than _five hundred witnesses_--those who by\r\nintimate acquaintance, or a careful study of his life, are qualified\r\nto give a just estimate of his character and works,--historians,\r\nbiographers, encyclopedists, statesmen, divines, and others; men and\r\nwomen who have acquired an honorable distinction in the various walks\r\nof life, and whose names alone are a sufficient guarantee that what they\r\ntestify shall be the truth.

John Drayton: \"Colonel Gadsden (having brought the first copy\r\nof Paine's pamphlet 'Common Sense') boldly declared himself [in the\r\nProvincial Congress at Charleston, Feb. 10, 1776] for the absolute\r\nIndependence of America. This last sentiment came like an explosion of\r\nthunder on the members.\"\r\n\r\nBitterly as the Colonists opposed the tyranny of the English Government\r\nthere were no manifestations of disloyalty. If they harbored the thought\r\nof separation and independence no tongue or pen had dared to give\r\nexpression to it. Referring to this period Hon. Alexander H. Stephens\r\nsays: \"Neither did Livingston, nor Washington, nor any of the prominent\r\nleaders in the cause of the Colonists at that time look to anything but\r\na redress of grievances. None were looking to a final separation and\r\nIndependence.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I first took command of the army,\" says Washington, \"I abhorred\r\nthe idea of Independence.\" When admonished that continued resistance to\r\nthe crown might lead to separation, he replied: \"If you ever hear of\r\nme joining in any such measures you have my leave to set me down\r\nfor everything wicked.\" While Paine was writing his \"Common Sense,\"\r\nJefferson, the reputed author of the Declaration of Independence, wrote\r\nthat he was \"looking with fondness toward a reconciliation with Great\r\nBritain.\" But a little while before Franklin had assured Lord\r\nChatham that \"he had never heard in America an expression in favor of\r\nIndependence.\"\r\n\r\nVirginia, the province of Washington and Jefferson, declared in favor\r\nof \"a redress of grievances, and not a revolution of government.\" In\r\nNovember, 1775, the Assembly of Pennsylvania, Franklin's province,\r\nelected a delegation to the Continental Congress with these\r\ninstructions: \"Though the British Parliament and administration have\r\ncompelled us to resist their violence by force of arms, yet we strictly\r\nenjoin that you dissent from and utterly reject any proposition, should\r\nsuch be made, that may cause or lead to a separation from the mother\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Among them all not one had been stirred by that splendid dream of a new\r\nnation, a nation independent and free. There was but one mind and only\r\none that had grasped the great plan. There was one voice crying in the\r\nwilderness. There was one herald of the dawn, one that did not hesitate\r\nin that night of hesitancy and reluctancy.\"--_Dr. J. E. Roberts_.\r\n\r\nDr. David Ramsay, a prominent leader in the Continental Congress and a\r\npopular historian of the Revolution, describing the effects of \"Common\r\nSense,\" says: \"Though that measure [Separation] a few months before was\r\nnot only foreign to their wishes, but the object of their abhorrence,\r\nthe current suddenly became so strong in its favor that it bore down all\r\nbefore it.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Moses Coit Tyler: \"In one sentiment all persons, Tories and\r\nWhigs, seemed perfectly to agree, viz., in abhorrence of the project of\r\nseparation from the Empire. Suddenly, however, and within a period\r\nof less than six months [chiefly as a result of Paine's pamphlet] the\r\nmajority of the Whigs turned completely around, and openly declared for\r\nIndependence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Paine brought to the study of the American Revolution a mind...\r\nquick to see into things, and marvelous in its power of stating them\r\nwith lucidity, with liveliness and with incisive force.\"\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that the writing of \"Common Sense\" with its\r\nadvocacy of separation and independence was suggested by Franklin.\r\nIt was not; Franklin knew nothing of its existence prior to its\r\npublication. What he suggested was a history of Colonial affairs\r\nwhich he believed would convince the world that the grievances of the\r\nColonists against the mother country were just. Paine's own account of\r\nthe origin of this work is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In October, 1775, Dr. Franklin proposed giving me such materials\r\nas were in his hands towards completing a history of the present\r\ntransactions, and seemed desirous of having the first volume out the\r\nnext spring.. I had then formed the outlines of 'Common Sense,' and\r\nfinished nearly the first part; and as I supposed the doctor's design\r\nin getting out a history was to open the new year with a new system, I\r\nexpected to surprise him with a production on that subject much earlier\r\nthan he thought of; and without informing him of what I was doing, got\r\nit ready for the press as fast as I conveniently could, and sent him the\r\nfirst pamphlet that was printed off.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the originality of his revolutionary ideas, \"Appleton's\r\nCyclopedia of American Biography\" says: \"Beyond doubt Washington,\r\nFranklin, and all other prominent men of the Revolutionary period gave\r\nPaine the sole credit for everything that came from his pen.\"\r\n\r\nWashington, Franklin and Jefferson were among Paine's earliest\r\nconverts. Franklin gave his book his immediate approval, and Jefferson's\r\nendorsement soon followed. Washington, writing to Joseph Reed in the\r\nsame month that it was published, acknowledged its \"sound doctrine and\r\nunanswerable reasoning,\" and declared for separation.\r\n\r\n\"Jefferson, Washington and Franklin, who up to that time [publication of\r\n'Common Sense'] had denounced even the thought of Independence,... all\r\nchanged front, and soon, not a majority, but the effective part of the\r\npeople, followed.\"--_T. B. Wakeman_.\r\n\r\n\"Washington, now converted, wrote to his friends in praise of 'Common\r\nSense'... Jefferson, John Adams, Franklin, Madison, all the great\r\nstatesmen of the time, wrote praisefully of Paine's 'flaming\r\narguments.'\"--_Ella Wheeler Wilcox_.\r\n\r\n\"Leaders in the New York Provincial Congress considered the\r\nadvisability of answering it but came to the conclusion that it was\r\nunanswerable.\"--_Encyclopedia Britannica._\r\n\r\nAn Unknown Writer of Charleston, S.

It was felt from New England to the Carolinas; it resounded\r\nthroughout the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe sympathy and assistance of liberty-loving Europeans contributed\r\nmuch to the success of the Revolution, and this was due largely to the\r\ninfluence of Paine's \"Common Sense,\" which was printed in nearly every\r\ntongue and read in nearly every country of Continental Europe. Even in\r\nEngland thousands of copies were circulated, and the American party,\r\nthe party of Chatham, Fox and Burke, was greatly strengthened, while the\r\ninfluence of the king and his ministry was correspondingly weakened by\r\nthe effect of its masterly arguments.\r\n\r\nLord Erskine: \"In that great and calamitous conflict, Edmund Burke and\r\nThomas Paine fought in the same field together, but with very different\r\nsuccess. Mr. Burke spoke to a Parliament in England, such as Sir George\r\nSaville describes it, having no ears but for sounds that flattered its\r\ncorruptions. Mr. Paine, on the other hand, spoke to the people, reasoned\r\nwith them, told them they were bound by no subjection to any sovereignty\r\nfurther than their own benefit connected them, and, by these powerful\r\narguments, prepared the minds of the American people for that glorious,\r\njust, and happy Revolution.\"\r\n\r\nMarquis de Chastelleaux: \"Since my arrival in America I had not yet seen\r\nMr. Paine, that author so celebrated in America and throughout Europe\r\nby his excellent work entitled 'Common Sense.'

Marching by day, listening to the consultations of\r\nWashington and his generals, Paine wrote by the camp fires; the winter\r\nstorms, the Delaware waves, were mingled with his ink; the half-naked\r\nsoldiers in their troubled sleep dreaming of their distant homes, the\r\nskulking deserter creeping off in the dusk, the pallid face of the\r\nheavy-hearted commander, made the awful shadows beneath which was\r\nwritten that leaflet.\"--_Dr. Conway_.\r\n\r\nOf this work Sir George Trevelyan writes: \"The 'Crisis' was an\r\nimpassioned appeal to arms. That circumstance endowed Paine's glowing\r\nrhetoric with a special value in the estimation of Americans. To their\r\nmind's eye the little work was adorned by an imaginary frontispiece of a\r\nsoldier, writing by the watch-fire's light, with his comrades slumbering\r\nround him; and it was among those comrades that the author found his\r\nwarmest admirers and his most convinced disciples.\"\r\n\r\n\"These words were fire and warmed the soldiers; they were meat and drink\r\nfor the famishing; they were clothes for the naked. The soldiers were\r\nfilled with a courage new and unknown. The battle of Trenton came,\r\nand as the soldiers entered that conflict, all down the ranks rang the\r\nbattle cry, 'These are the times that try men's souls.' The battle was\r\nfought and won. The army of the patriots had entered upon a new\r\ncareer. And thus he wrote and wrought to the end of the immortal\r\nstruggle.\"--_Dr. John E.

Major General Greene being anxious for the garrison and\r\ndesirous of knowing its ability to resist sent Mr. Paine to ascertain.\r\nHe accordingly went to Fort Mercer, and from thence, on Nov. 9, (1777),\r\nwent with Col. Christopher Greene commanding Fort Mercer, in an open\r\nboat to Fort Mifflin, during the cannonade, and was there when the enemy\r\nopened with two gun batteries and a mortar battery. This _very_ gallant\r\nact shows what a fearless man Mr. Paine was.\"\r\n\r\nLippincott's Biographical Dictionary: \"He was secretary to the Committee\r\non Foreign Affairs in Congress from April, 1777, to January, 1779.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted by Mr. Roosevelt and others that Paine, because\r\nof his action in the Deane affair, was discharged from his position as\r\nsecretary to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. He was not discharged,\r\nnor was he even asked to resign. He resigned of his own volition.\r\n\r\nFranklin Steiner: \"In 1778 a fraud was about to be committed upon the\r\ninfant republic.... Paine wrote several articles for the press, exposing\r\nthe entire corrupt transaction, and of course made enemies of all\r\ninvolved in the dishonest affair, who at once made attempts to have him\r\ndischarged from his position, in which they failed.\"\r\n\r\n\"A motion for his dismission was lost.\"--_Dr. Conway_.\r\n\r\n\"Congress refused to vote that it was 'an abuse of office,' or to\r\ndischarge him.\"--_Ibid_.\r\n\r\nIt was Paine's honesty and patriotism, a desire to protect the interests\r\nof his adopted country, that caused him to make his exposure. His\r\n\"indiscretion,\" as some diplomats characterized it, saved the Colonies\r\na million livres. Pennsylvania applauded the act and rebuked his\r\ncensors by appointing him clerk of the Assembly. His whole subsequent\r\ncareer--his continued labors in behalf of the Colonies--the confidence\r\nreposed in him by all the people--show that his ability, his integrity,\r\nand his patriotism were never questioned.\r\n\r\nIn less than three years after the Deane affair the members of Congress\r\nwho had honestly espoused Deane's cause acknowledged the justice and\r\nwisdom of Paine's exposure.\r\n\r\nJohn Jay Knox: \"In 1780 occurred the darkest days of the Revolutionary\r\nWar. The army was in great distress.... Thomas Paine, the Clerk in the\r\nPennsylvania Assembly, in a letter to Blair McClenaghan, suggested a\r\nsubscription for relief of the army and enclosed a contribution of $500.\r\n\r\nAmerican Cyclopedia: \"A letter [dated May 28, 1780] was received by\r\nthe Assembly of Pennsylvania from Gen. Washington, saying that,\r\nnotwithstanding his confidence in the attachment of the army to the\r\ncause of the country, he feared their distresses would soon cause mutiny\r\nin the ranks. This letter was read by Paine as clerk. A despairing\r\nsilence pervaded the hall, and the Assembly soon adjourned. Paine wrote\r\nto Blair McClenaghan, a merchant of Philadelphia, explaining the urgency\r\nof affairs, and enclosed in the letter $500, the amount of salary due\r\nhim as clerk, as his contribution toward a relief fund. McClenaghan\r\ncalled a meeting next day and read Paine's letter; a subscription\r\nlist was immediately circulated, and in a short time £300,000 [nearly\r\n$1,500,000] Pennsylvania currency was collected. With this as a capital,\r\nthe Pennsylvania Bank, afterwards expanded into the Bank of North\r\nAmerica, was established for the relief of the army.\"\r\n\r\nCassell's Dictionary of Religion: \"In 1781 Paine was sent to France with\r\nCol.

Moncure D. Conway, then pastor of a\r\nchurch in Cincinnati, in a eulogy on Paine, said: \"So disinterested was\r\nhe, that, when his works were printed by the ten thousand, and as fast\r\nas one edition was out another was demanded, he, a poor and pinched\r\nauthor, who might very easily have grown rich, would not accept one cent\r\nfor them, declared that he would not coin his principles, and made to\r\nthe States a present of the copyrights. His brain was his fortune,--nay\r\nhis living; he gave it all to American Independence.\" Paine also gave\r\nthe copyrights of the several numbers of his \"Crisis\" to the States. The\r\nclose of the Revolution found him, to quote from Dr. Conway's biography\r\nof Paine, \"a penniless patriot who might easily have had fifty thousand\r\npounds in his pocket.\"\r\n\r\n(I shall quote freely from Dr. Conway. For all time this biographer will\r\nbe the standard authority on Thomas Paine. He was a life-long student\r\nof Paine. In each of the three countries which Paine served, America,\r\nFrance and England, he had full access to the national archives of\r\nPaine's time.

Government is the organization of the aggregate natural rights which\r\nindividuals are not competent to secure individually, and therefore\r\nsurrender to the control of society in exchange for the protection of\r\nall rights.\r\n\r\n2. Republican government is that in which the welfare of the whole\r\nnation is the object.\r\n\r\n3. Monarchy is government, more or less arbitrary, in which the\r\ninterests of an individual are paramount to those of the people\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n4. Aristocracy is government, partially arbitrary, in which the\r\ninterests of a class are paramount to the people generally.\r\n\r\n5. Democracy is the whole people governing themselves without secondary\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n6. Representative government is the control of a nation by persons\r\nelected by the whole nation.\r\n\r\n7. The Rights of Man mean the right of all to representation.\r\n\r\nPaine advocated a republic (2.) with a representative government (6.).\r\nThe first real republic with a representative government of importance\r\nestablished in the world was in the United States of America, of which,\r\nwhen religious prejudice passes away, Thomas Paine will be recognized as\r\nthe founder.\r\n\r\nProfessor J.

Bury, LL.D.: \"His 'Rights of Man' is an indictment\r\nof the monarchical form of government, and a plea for representative\r\ndemocracy.\"\r\n\r\nTerrible but truthful is Paine's indictment of monarchy: \"All the\r\nmonarchical governments are military. War is their trade; plunder and\r\nrevenue their objects. While such governments continue, peace has not\r\nthe absolute security of a day. What is the history of all monarchical\r\ngovernments but a disgustful picture of human wretchedness, and the\r\naccidental respite of a few years repose. Wearied with war and tired\r\nwith human butchery, they sat down to rest and called it peace.\"\r\n\r\nThis is his conception of an ideal government:\r\n\r\n\"When it shall be said in any country in the world, 'My poor are happy;\r\nneither ignorance nor distress is to be found among them; my jails are\r\nempty of prisoners, my streets of beggars; the aged are not in want, the\r\ntaxes are not oppressive, the rational world is my friend, because I am\r\nthe friend of its happiness,'---when these things can be said, then may\r\nthat country boast of its constitution and its government.\"\r\n\r\n\"The political events of our own day--of the present hour--point to the\r\ntime when the ambitions and the wars of monarchy will be at an end, and\r\nwhen republican peace will reign throughout the world. Then shall the\r\ndream of Thomas Paine, the world's greatest citizen of the world, be\r\nrealized.\"--_Marshall J. Gaitvin._\r\n\r\nWashington Irving: \"A reprint of Paine's 'Rights of Man,' written\r\nin reply to Burke's pamphlet on the French Revolution, appeared [in\r\nAmerica] under the auspices of Mr. Jefferson.\"\r\n\r\nIn introducing Paine's work to the American people Jefferson, then\r\nSecretary of State, said: \"I have no doubt our citizens will rally a\r\nsecond time round the standard of 'Common Sense.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Builders of the Nation: \"At this time the Republican party as it\r\nwas called, accepted the views of Jefferson, and as he openly accepted\r\nPaine's 'Rights of Man' it followed that the advanced views contained\r\nin that book grew to be held measurably as the party tenets of his\r\nfollowers.\"\r\n\r\nProf. E. D. Adams, Ph. D.: \"As a cult [democracy], the theory\r\nundoubtedly first found adequate expression amongst us in the writings\r\nof Thomas Paine.... In these two books ['Common Sense' and 'Rights of\r\nMan'] Paine was then the first to state the ideal of democracy, as it\r\nlater came to be accepted in America under the leadership of Jefferson.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Monroe, referring to the censure he had received for\r\nhis endorsement of Paine's book, Jefferson says: \"I certainly merit the\r\nsame, for I profess the same principles.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Paine (June 19, 1792,) Jefferson says: \"Our good people\r\nare firm and unanimous in their principles of Republicanism, and there\r\nis no better proof of it than that they love what you write and read it\r\nwith delight.\"\r\n\r\nJames Madison declared the \"Rights of Man\" to be \"a written defense of\r\nthe principles on which that [our] Government is based.\"\r\n\r\nFor our so-called Jeffersonian Democracy we are indebted to Thomas\r\nPaine. He formulated its principles. Jefferson, Madison and others of\r\nhis disciples popularized them.\r\n\r\nAfter commending the \"Rights of Man\" Richard Henry Lee wrote: \"I\r\nsincerely regret that our country could not have offered sufficient\r\ninducements to have retained as a permanent citizen a man so thoroughly\r\nrepublican in sentiment and fearless in the expression of his opinions.\"\r\n\r\nIn his book, one of the most brilliant volumes ever penned, Burke, long\r\nthe friend of popular government, defended royalty and aristocracy.\r\nHe sought to arouse the sympathies of Europe in behalf of royalty and\r\naristocracy in France which were tottering to their fall, a disaster\r\nwhich endangered their existence everywhere. The book was circulated\r\nby tens of thousands. Captivated by its marvelous beauty a reaction in\r\nfavor of despotism was setting in when Paine's immortal work appeared.\r\nThe glowing rhetoric of Burke went down before the merciless logic of\r\nPaine.\r\n\r\nBurke is filled with sorrow for the French king and nobles whose rule\r\nand privileges have been abolished or restricted, but expresses none for\r\nthe millions who for centuries have been persecuted, impoverished and\r\nimprisoned by the ruling classes. In words that come from the heart of\r\nthe author and which reach the hearts of the people, Paine answers him:\r\n\r\n\"Not one glance of compassion, not one commiserating reflection, that I\r\ncan find throughout his book, has he bestowed on those that lingered out\r\nthe most wretched of lives; a life without hope, in the most miserable\r\nof prisons. It is painful to behold a man employing his talents to\r\ncorrupt himself. Nature has been kinder to Mr. Burke than he has been\r\nto her. He is not affected by the reality of distress touching upon his\r\nheart, but by the showy resemblance of it striking his imagination. He\r\npities the plumage, but forgets the dying bird. Accustomed to kiss the\r\naristocratic hand that hath purloined him from himself, he degenerates\r\ninto a composition of art, and the genuine soul of nature forsakes him.\r\nHis hero or his heroine must be a tragedy-victim, expiring in show, and\r\nnot the real prisoner of misery, sliding into death in the silence of a\r\ndungeon.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to this intellectual combat William Cobbett, one of England's\r\nmost distinguished political writers, writing more than a quarter of\r\na century after Paine's reply to Burke, says: \"As my Lord Grenville\r\nintroduced the name of Burke, suffer me, my Lord, to introduce that of\r\na man who put this Burke to shame, who drove him off the public stage\r\nto seek shelter in the pension list, and who is now named fifty million\r\ntimes where the name of the pensioned Burke is mentioned once.\"\r\n\r\nLord John Morley: \"Thomas Paine replied to them [Burke's 'Reflections']\r\nwith an energy, courage and eloquence worthy of his cause in the 'Rights\r\nof Man.'\"\r\n\r\n\"In brilliant rhetoric Burke argued its [Natural Rights] dangerous and\r\nbaseless nature.. Paine in his even more brilliant 'Rights of Man,'\r\nanswered Burke.\"--_Encyclopedia of Social Reform._\r\n\r\nThomas Campbell: \"He strongly answered at the bar of public opinion all\r\nthe arguments of Burke. I do not deny that fact; and I should be sorry\r\nif I could be blind, even with tears in my eyes for Mackintosh, to the\r\nservices that have been rendered to the cause of truth by the shrewdness\r\nand courage of Thomas Paine.\"\r\n\r\n(Great events inspire great works. Three of the masterpieces of\r\nliterature were inspired by the French Revolution, Edmund Burke's\r\n\"Reflections on the French Revolution\" condemning it, and Sir James\r\nMackintosh's \"Vindiciæ Gallicæ\" and Thomas Paine's \"Rights of Man\"\r\ndefending it.)\r\n\r\nDictionary of National Biography (England): \"Paine is the only English\r\nwriter who exposes with uncompromising sharpness the abstract doctrines\r\nof political rights held by the French Revolutionists.\"\r\n\r\nCharles James Fox: \"It ['Rights of Man'] seems as clear and as simple as\r\nthe first rules of arithmetic.\"\r\n\r\nManchester Constitutional Society (March 13, 1792): \"A work of the\r\nhighest importance to every nation under heaven, but particularly to\r\nthis, as containing excellent and practical plans for an immediate and\r\nconsiderable reduction of the public expenditure; for the prevention\r\nof wars; for the extension of our manufactures and commerce; for the\r\neducation of the young; for the comfortable support of the aged; for the\r\nbetter maintenance of the poor.\"\r\n\r\nSheffield Society for Constitutional Information (March 14, 1792): \"We\r\nhave derived more true knowledge from the two works of Thomas Paine,\r\nentitled 'Rights of Man,' Parts First and Second, than from any other\r\nauthor. The practice as well as the principle of government is laid down\r\nin those works in a manner so clear and irresistibly convincing.\"\r\n\r\nJames Anthony Froude: \"Copies of Paine's 'Rights of Man' were sown\r\nbroadcast [in Ireland].\"\r\n\r\n\"Protestant Belfast had declared itself a disciple of Paine.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Irish patriots were red republicans... anxious to establish in\r\nIreland the principles of Paine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paine,\" says his biographer, Dr. Conway, \"held a supremacy in the\r\nconstitutional clubs of England and Ireland equal to that of Robespierre\r\nover the Jacobins of Paris.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Pitt (to Lady Hester Stanhope, who had quoted from the \"Rights\r\nof Man\"): \"Paine is quite in the right, but what am I to do?\"\r\n\r\nSir James Mackintosh: \"His bold speculations and fierce invectives\r\nindicated the approach of social confusion.\"\r\n\r\nProf. G. P. Gooch, M.A.: \"The 'Rights of Man,' compelled attention not\r\nless by the novelty of its ideas than by its consummate pamphleteering\r\nskill.... The alarm increased when it was known that the book was\r\nselling by tens of thousands.\"\r\n\r\nDiccionaris Enciclopedico (Spain): \"The friends of the Government burned\r\nPaine in effigy in the streets of London. Later he was proclaimed the\r\ngreat apostle of liberty and the father of the Revolution.\"\r\n\r\nGouverneur Morris: \"Bonnville is here [Paris]. He is just returned from\r\nEngland. He tells me that Paine's book works mightily in England.\"\r\n\r\nLouis Blanc: \"The militia were armed, in the southeast of England\r\ntroops received orders to march to London, the meeting of Parliament was\r\nadvanced forty days, the Tower was reinforced by a new garrison, in\r\nfine there was enrolled a formidable preparation of war--against Thomas\r\nPaine's book on the 'Rights of Man.'\"\r\n\r\nH. D. Traill, D.C.L.: \"Paine's book on the 'Rights of Man' was known\r\nto have an enormous circulation, and he was prosecuted for it under the\r\nproclamation of May, 1792. Paine's counsel argued in vain that it\r\nhad never been held criminal to express opinions on the problems of\r\npolitical philosophy.... Paine was condemned.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was defended by Erskine, who was then in the zenith of his glory as\r\nan advocate, in a speech of marvelous power and eloquence.\"--_Hon. E. B.\r\nWashburne._\r\n\r\nJ. Redman (\"London, Tuesday, Dec. 18, 1792, 5 P.M.\"): \"Mr. Paine's trial\r\nis this instant over. Erskine shone like the morning star. The instant\r\nErskine closed his speech the venal jury [it was a packed jury]\r\ninterrupted the Attorney General, who was about to make reply, and\r\nwithout waiting for any answer, or any summing up by the Judge,\r\npronounced him guilty. Such an instance of infernal corruption is\r\nscarcely upon record.\"\r\n\r\nPaine's case was set for June, 1792, and he was anxious to go to trial\r\nthen. At the request of the Government it was postponed till December.\r\nIn the meantime Paine, having been elected to the National Convention,\r\nwent to France. Had he remained in England death or a long imprisonment\r\nwould have been his fate, the charge against him being high treason.\r\n\r\nAlexander Gilchrist: \"On Paine's rising to leave [he had delivered a\r\nradical address in London the night before], Blake [William] laid his\r\nhand on the orator's shoulder, saying, 'You must not go home, or you are\r\na dead man,' and he hurried him off on his way to France.... Those were\r\nhanging days in England.\"\r\n\r\nDr. James Currie (1793): \"The prosecutions that are commenced all over\r\nEngland against printers, publishers, etc., would astonish you; and\r\nmost of these are for offenses committed months ago. The printer of the\r\nManchester _Herald_ has had... six different indictments for selling or\r\ndisposing of six different copies of Paine--all previous to the trial of\r\nPaine. The man was opulent, supposed worth £20,000; but these different\r\nactions will ruin him, as they were intended to do.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial of Paine was followed by a veritable reign of terror in\r\nEngland. Alluding to the prosecutions and persecutions of the publishers\r\nand venders of Paine's books, Buckle, in his \"History of Civilization,\"\r\nsays: \"It is no exaggeration to say that for some years England was\r\nruled by a system of absolute terror.\"\r\n\r\nIt was over the writings of Thomas Paine chiefly, his \"Rights of Man\" at\r\nfirst and later his \"Age of Reason,\" that the battle for free speech\r\nand a free press in England was fought and won. In this great struggle\r\nEngland's gifted statesman, Charles James Fox, whom Edmund Burke\r\ndescribes as \"the greatest debater the world ever saw,\" and whom Sir\r\nJames Mackintosh declares to De \"the most Demosthenian speaker since\r\nDemosthenes,\" ably and fearlessly upheld the rights of Paine and the\r\ndisseminators of his writings and teachings. In this struggle the poet\r\nShelley, too, did valiant work.\r\n\r\nRichard Carlile: \"It is not too much to say that if the 'Rights of\r\nMan' had obtained two or three years' free circulation in England and\r\nScotland, it would have produced a similar effect to that which 'Common\r\nSense' did in the United States.\"\r\n\r\nSir Francis Burdett: \"Ministers know that a united people are not to be\r\nresisted; and it is this that we must understand by what is written in\r\nthe works of an honest man too long calumniated. I mean Thomas Paine.\"\r\n\r\nM. Brissot: \"The grievance of the British Cabinet against France is not\r\nthat Louis is in judgment, but that Thomas Paine wrote the 'Rights of\r\nMan'.\"\r\n\r\nAbbe Sieyes: \"His 'Rights of Man,' translated into our language, is\r\nuniversally known; and where is the patriotic Frenchman who has not\r\nalready, from the depths of his soul, thanked him for having fortified\r\nour cause with all the power of his reason and his reputation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paine's 'Rights of Man',\" says Dr. Conway, \"had been in every French\r\nhome. His portrait, painted by Romney and engraved by Sharp, was in\r\nevery cottage, framed in immortelles.\" Napoleon Bonaparte said: \"I\r\nalways sleep with the 'Rights of Man' beneath my pillow.\" Hon. Elihu\r\nB. Washburne, Minister of the United States to France during President\r\nGrant's administration, and later a prominent candidate for president\r\nof the United States himself, in a monograph on Thomas Paine, says:\r\n\"He at once became a hero in France, and was everywhere received with\r\nenthusiasm. The doors of the _salons_ and clubs of Paris were opened to\r\nhim, and he was soon recognized as one of the advanced figures in\r\nthe Revolution, standing by the side of de Bonneville, Brissot and\r\nCondorcet.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a commonly accepted opinion that the French Revolution was\r\ninspired chiefly by the writings of Rousseau and Voltaire. Hardly\r\nless potent, however, were Paine's \"Rights of Man,\" published at the\r\nbeginning of the Revolution, and his \"Common Sense,\" which electrified\r\nFrance fifteen years before. Referring to these French writings and\r\nthe \"Rights of Man,\" Dr. Conway says: \"In this book the philosophy of\r\nvisionary reformers took practical shape. From the ashes of Rousseau's\r\n'Contrat Social,' burnt in Paris, rose the 'Rights of Man,' no phoenix,\r\nbut an eagle of the new world, with eye not blinded by any royal sun.\r\nIt comes to tell how by union of France and America--of Lafayette and\r\nWashington--the 'Contrat Social' was framed into the Constitution of a\r\nhappy and glorious new earth.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Knight: \"In the week of the flight of Louis [June, 1791] Paine\r\nwrote in English a proclamation to the French nation, which, being\r\ntranslated, was affixed to all the walls of Paris. It was an invitation\r\nto the people to profit by existing circumstances, and establish a\r\nRepublic.\"\r\n\r\nIda M. Tarbell: \"Brissot brought several of his friends to see them [the\r\nRolands]. Among the most important of these were Petion and Robespierre.\r\nIn April [1791] Thomas Paine appeared. So agreeable were these informal\r\nreunions found to be that it was arranged to hold them four times a\r\nweek.... To Madame Roland these gatherings were of absorbing interest.\"\r\n\r\n\"With Condorcet, Brissot, and a few others as sympathizers, Paine formed\r\na Republican society.\"\r\n\r\nJustin H. McCarthy: \"The prospectus of a journal called _Le\r\nRepublicaine_ was posted at the very doors of the General Assembly. It\r\nwas signed by Duchatellet, a colonel of Chasseurs, but is said to have\r\nbeen drawn up by Thomas Paine.\"\r\n\r\nEtienne Dumont: \"Some of the seed sown by the audacious hand of Paine\r\nwere now budding in leading minds.\"\r\n\r\nMeyers' Gross Konversations-Lexikon: \"In Paris Paine was declared\r\na French citizen and was elected to the National Convention by the\r\ndepartment of Pas-de-Calais.\"\r\n\r\nLa Grande Encyclopédie: \"Declared a French citizen by the National\r\nAssembly, he was elected a member of the Convention by the departments\r\nof l'Oise, the Puy-de-Dome and the Pas-de-Calais.\"\r\n\r\nH.

Louvet (and thirty-two others): \"Your love for humanity, for liberty\r\nand equality, the useful works that have issued from your pen in their\r\ndefense, have determined our choice.

The tri-colored cockade was presented\r\nto him by the mayor, and the handsomest woman in the town was selected\r\nto place it in his hat.\"\r\n\r\nW. T. Sherwin: \"The hall of the Minimes [in Calais] was so crowded that\r\nit was with the greatest difficulty they made way for Mr. Paine to the\r\nside of the president. Over the chair he sat in was placed the bust\r\nof Mirabeau, and the colors of France, England, and America united.\r\nA speaker acquainted him from the tribune with his election, amid the\r\nplaudits of the people. For some minutes after the ceremony nothing was\r\nheard but '_Vive la Nation! Vive Thomas Paine!_'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ancient Calais, in its time, had received heroes from across the\r\nchannel, but hitherto never with joy. That honor the centuries reserved\r\nfor a Thetford Quaker.

As the representative for\r\nCalais steps on French soil soldiers make his avenue, the officers\r\nembrace him, the national cockade is presented. A beautiful lady\r\nadvances, requesting the honor of setting the cockade in his hat, and\r\nmakes him a pretty speech, ending with Liberty, Equality and France.\r\nAs they move along the Rue de l'Egalité (late Rue du Roi) the air rings\r\nwith '_Vive Thomas Paine_'! At the town hall he is presented to the\r\nMunicipality, by each member embraced, by the Mayor also addressed. At\r\nthe meeting of the Constitutional Society of Calais, in the Minimes, he\r\nsits beside the president, beneath the bust of Mirabeau and the united\r\ncolors of France, England and America. There is an official ceremony\r\nannouncing his election, and plaudits of the crowd, '_Vive la Nation!\r\nVive Thomas Paine!'\"--Dr. Conway_.\r\n\r\nRev. Francis L. Hawkes, LL.D.: \"Meantime Paine had been declared in\r\nParis worthy of citizenship, and he proceeded thither, where he was\r\nreceived with every demonstration of extravagant joy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ovation which Paine received on his arrival in France was one such\r\nas theretofore only kings had received.\"--_Theodore Schroeder_.\r\n\r\nHérault de Sechelles, (President of National Assembly): \"France calls\r\nyou, Sir, to its bosom to fill the most useful, and consequently the\r\nmost honorable of functions--that of contributing, by wise legislation,\r\nto the happiness of a people whose destinies interest and unite all who\r\nthink and all who suffer in the world.\r\n\r\n\"It is meet that the nation which proclaimed the Rights of Man should\r\ndesire to have him among its legislators who first dared to measure all\r\ntheir consequences.\"\r\n\r\nPhilip Van Ness Myers, LL.D.: \"The Convention, consisting of seven\r\nhundred and forty-nine deputies, among whom was the celebrated\r\nfreethinker, Thomas Paine, embraced two active groups, the Girondins and\r\nthe Mountainists [Jacobins].\"\r\n\r\nAlphonse de Lamartine: \"A stranger sat among the members of the\r\nConvention--the philosopher, Thomas Paine, born in England, the apostle\r\nof American independence, the friend of Franklin, author of 'Common\r\nSense,' the 'Rights of Man,' and the 'Age of Reason'--three pages of\r\nthe New Evangelist in which he brought back political institutions\r\nand religious creeds to their primitive justice and lucidity; his name\r\npossessed great weight among the innovators of the two worlds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everyone,\" says Paul Desjardins, \"turned toward Paine as toward the\r\nliving statue of liberty. The enfranchisement of America consecrated\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nThe official reports of the National Convention state that when Paine\r\narose in the Convention and cast his vote for its first decree the act\r\nwas received by \"acclamations of joy, the cries of _Vive la nation!_\r\nrepeated by all the spectators, prolonging themselves for many minutes!\"\r\n\r\nReferring to this Convention, the Hon. E. B. Washburne says: \"Never was\r\nthere a legislative or constituent body which displayed such stupendous\r\nenergy or performed such immense labor. In the delirium of its passions\r\nit stamped itself on the history of the world not only by its crimes,\r\nbut by its great acts of legislation, which will live as long as\r\nFrance shall endure. Thomas Paine was a member of this Convention.\r\nHis popularity in France at this time is shown by the fact that he was\r\nchosen a member of the Convention by three departments.\r\n\r\n\"The Convention was not long in giving Paine a striking recognition of\r\nthe consideration in which it held him. One of its earliest decrees was\r\nto establish a special Commission (committee) of nine members on the\r\nConstitution. This Commission was composed of the most distinguished men\r\nof the Convention: Gensonne, Thomas Paine, Brissot, Petion, Vergniaud,\r\nBarrere, Danton, Condorcet, and the Abbe Sieyes.\"\r\n\r\nLouis Adolphus Thiers: \"A sixth committee was charged with the principal\r\nobject for which the Convention had met, to prepare a new constitution.\r\nIt was composed of nine celebrated members. Philosophy had its\r\nrepresentatives in the persons of Sieyes, Condorcet, and the American\r\nThomas Paine, recently elected a French citizen, and a member of the\r\nConvention. The Gironde was more particularly represented by Gensonne,\r\nVergniaud, Petion, and Brissot; the Centre by Barrere, and the Montagne\r\nby Danton.\"\r\n\r\nThe names of these eminent men will live long in history; but dear was\r\nthe price paid for their fame. Danton, Brissot, Gensonne and Vergniaud\r\ndied on the scaffold; Condorcet died in a prison cell, a suicide; Petion\r\nescaped to a forest where his body was afterward found partly devoured\r\nby wolves; Barrere was banished, and Paine was imprisoned. Sieyes alone\r\nescaped unharmed.\r\n\r\nThomas Carlyle: \"To make the Constitution; to defend the Republic till\r\nthat be made. Speedily enough, accordingly, there has been a Committee\r\nof Constitution got together.

It\r\nis known as the Paine-Condorcet Constitution.\r\n\r\nDr. David Saville Muzzey: \"Paine labored to make this new republic of\r\nFrance an example for the monarchy-cursed countries of Europe. It was he\r\nwho protested against the domination of the Assembly by the section of\r\nParis which led to the Reign of Terror.\"\r\n\r\nM. Taine: \"Compared with the speeches and writings of the times,\r\nit [Paine's Letter to Danton] produces the strangest effect by its\r\npractical good sense.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Stael: \"When the sentence of Louis XVI. came under discussion\r\nPaine alone advised what would have done honor to France if it had been\r\nadopted.\"\r\n\r\nHenri Martin: \"Thomas Paine, the famous representative of the idea of a\r\nuniversal Republic, had voted against both an appeal to the people and\r\nthe penalty of death.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Wright, F. S. A.: \"He urged with great earnestness that the\r\nexecution of the sentence of death should be delayed.\"\r\n\r\nM. Guizot: \"The last effort was about to be attempted to save the\r\nlife of the King by delaying execution. The anger of the Jacobins was\r\nextreme; they refused to listen to a speech from Thomas Paine, the\r\nAmerican, till respect for his courage gained him a hearing.... The\r\nprayer and the hope were as vain as they were affecting.\"\r\n\r\nHon. Elihu B. Washburne: \"It was on the 19th day of January, 1793, that\r\nPaine mounted the tribune to speak to this question. This trial of Louis\r\nXVI. by the National Convention is one of the most remarkable on record.\r\nThe session was made permanent, and the trial went on day and night.\r\nAfter a lapse of nearly one hundred years, the painful and dramatic\r\nscenes stand out with still greater prominence. The _Salle des\r\nMachines_, in the Pavillon de Flores at the Tuileries, had been\r\nconverted into a grand hall for the sittings of the Convention. The\r\ngalleries were immense and could seat fourteen hundred spectators. In\r\nan immense city like Paris, convulsed with a political excitement never\r\nequaled, the trial of a king for his life produced the most profound\r\nemotions that ever agitated any community. All classes and conditions\r\nwere carried away by the prevailing excitement, and the pressure for\r\nplaces exceeded anything ever known.\r\n\r\n\"The appearance of Thomas Paine at the tribune, with a roll of\r\nmanuscript in his hand, created a sensation in the Convention. By his\r\nside stood Bancal, who was there to translate the speech into French\r\nand read it to the Convention. The first declaration of the celebrated\r\nforeigner produced a commotion on the benches of the Montagne. Coming\r\nfrom a democrat like Thomas Paine, a man so intimately allied with the\r\nAmericans, a great thinker and writer, there was fear of their influence\r\non the Convention.\r\n\r\n\"The most violent exclamations broke out, drowning the voice of Bancal,\r\nthe unfortunate interpreter, and creating an indescribable tumult. Never\r\nwas a man in a more embarrassing condition than Paine was at this time.\r\nThough not understanding the language, he yet realized the fury of the\r\nstorm which raged around him. Standing at the tribune in his half Quaker\r\ncoat, and genteelly attired, he remained undaunted and self-possessed\r\nduring the tempest. This speech of Paine breathed greatness of soul and\r\ngenerosity of spirit and will forever honor his memory.\"\r\n\r\nPaine's speech, says Conway, is \"unparalleled for argument and art and\r\neloquence.\"\r\n\r\nCharlotte M. Yonge: \"A brave remonstrance.\"\r\n\r\nHon. Thomas E. Watson: \"Among the brave who would not bend to the storm\r\nwas Thomas Paine. Man enough to defy kings and priests, he was man\r\nenough, likewise, to defy a howling mob.\"\r\n\r\nE. Belford Bax: \"Paine, up to the last, manfully voted in the sense in\r\nwhich he had always spoken, for the life of the king at the imminent\r\nrisk of his own.\"\r\n\r\nWriting of the events which preceded and attended the trial and\r\nexecution of Louis XVI, Prince Talleyrand, a profound admirer of Paine,\r\nsays: \"It was no longer a question that the king should reign, but that\r\nhe himself, the queen, their children, his sister, should be saved. It\r\nmight have been done. It was at least a duty to attempt it.\" It was a\r\nduty, however, whose performance carried with it the probable penalty\r\nof death. Danton, France's greatest and bravest son, wished to save the\r\nlife of the king, but dared not to vote in favor of it. \"Although I may\r\nsave his life,\" he said, \"I shall vote for his death. I am quite willing\r\nto save his head, but not to lose my own.\" Even the king's cousin,\r\nPhilip of Orleans, voted for his kinsman's death. Paine did not shirk\r\nhis duty. He, too, loved life, but he loved honor more, and so, defying\r\ndeath, voted and pleaded for the life of the fallen monarch.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that man who stood there alone in that breathless hall with such\r\nmighty eloquence warming over his lofty brow! That man was one of\r\nthat illustrious band who had been made citizens of France--France\r\nthe redeemed and newborn! Yess with Mackintosh, Franklin, Hamilton,\r\nJefferson and Washington, he had been elected a citizen of France. With\r\nthese great men he hailed the French revolution as the dawn of God's\r\nmillennium. He had hurried to Paris, urged by the same deep love of man\r\nthat accompanied him in the darkest hours of the American revolution,\r\nand there, there pleading for the traitor-king, alone in that breathless\r\nhall he stood, the author-hero, Thomas Paine, pleading--even amid that\r\nsea of scowling faces--for the life of King Louis.\"--_George Lippard._\r\n\r\n\"In that maelstrom of thought, in that pandemonium of words, in that\r\nwhirlwind of passion, pleading for the life of the king, Thomas Paine,\r\nnot counting his own life, well knowing the consequences of his act,\r\nThomas Paine stood there and pleaded that the life of the king might be\r\nspared.\"--_Dr. J. E. Roberts._\r\n\r\nA. F. Bertrand de Moleville (French Minister of State): \"It must be\r\nrecorded to the eternal shame of this assembly, that Thomas Paine...\r\nproved himself the wisest, the most humane, the boldest--in a word, the\r\nmost innocent among them.\"\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo: \"Thomas Paine, an American and merciful.\"\r\n\r\n\"When tidings came of the king's trial and execution, whatever glimpses\r\nthey [Paine's adherents in England] gained of their outlawed leader\r\nshowed him steadfast as a star caught in one wave and another of that\r\nturbid tide. Many, alas, needed apologies, but Paine required none. That\r\none Englishman, standing on the tribune for justice and humanity, amid\r\nthree hundred angry Frenchmen in uproar, was as sublime a sight as\r\nEurope witnessed in those days.\"--_Dr. Conway._\r\n\r\n\"The rank and file followed their Thomas Paine with a faith that crowned\r\nheads might envy. The London men knew Paine thoroughly. The treasures of\r\nthe world would not draw him, nor any terrors drive him, to the side\r\nof cruelty and inhumanity. Their eye was upon him. Had Paine, after the\r\nking's execution, despaired of the republic there might have ensued some\r\ndemoralization among his followers in London. But they saw him by the\r\nside of the delivered prisoner of the Bastile, Brissot, an author well\r\nknown in England, by the side of Condorcet and others of Franklin's\r\nhonored circle engaged in a death struggle with the fire-breathing\r\ndragon called 'The Mountain.' That was the same unswerving man they\r\nhad been following, and to all accusations against the revolution their\r\nanswer was--Paine is still there.\"--_Ibid._\r\n\r\nWhile Paine allied himself to no particular faction of the convention,\r\nhis sympathies were with the Girondins. Lamartine says: \"Paine, the\r\nfriend of Madame Roland, Condorcet and Brissot, had been elected by\r\nthe town of Calais; the Girondins consulted him and placed him on the\r\ncommittee of surveyance.\" The Girondins comprised, for the most part,\r\nthe wisest and the best of France's legislators. Had they remained in\r\npower the excesses of the revolution would, to a great extent, have\r\nbeen avoided. But in an evil hour the Jacobins gained the ascendancy and\r\nwhile they ruled madness reigned supreme. The Girondins were slaughtered\r\nor expelled. In one night twenty-two of them--every one a noted\r\nstatesman or orator--the very flower of French manhood, \"the eloquent,\r\nthe young, the beautiful, the brave,\" as Riouffe, their fellow prisoner,\r\nlovingly describes them, were taken before a Jacobin tribunal and\r\ncondemned to death. Carlyle thus graphically and pathetically tells us\r\nhow they died:\r\n\r\n\"All Paris is out; such a crowd as no man had seen. The death-carts,\r\nValaze's cold corpse [he had committed suicide] stretched among the yet\r\nliving twenty-one, roll along. Bareheaded, hands bound, in their shirt\r\nsleeves, coat flung loosely round the neck; so fare the eloquent of\r\nFrance; bemurmured, beshouted. To the shouts of Vive la Republique,\r\nsome of them keep answering with counter shouts of Vive la Republique.\r\nOthers, as Brissot, sit sunk in silence. At the foot of the scaffold\r\nthey again strike up, with appropriate variations, the hymn of the\r\nMarseilles. Such an act of music; conceive it well! The yet living chant\r\nthere; the chorus so rapidly wearing weak! Samson's axe is rapid; one\r\nhead per minute, or a little less. The chorus is wearing weak; the\r\nchorus is worn out; farewell, forevermore, ye Girondins. Te-Deum Fauchet\r\nhas become silent; Valaze's dead head is lopped; the sickle of the\r\nguillotine has reaped the Girondins all away.\"\r\n\r\n\"How Paine loved those men--Brissot, Condorcet, Lasource, Duchatel,\r\nVergniaud, Gensonne! Never was man more devoted to his intellectual\r\ncomrades. Even across a century one may realize what it meant to him,\r\nthat march of his best friends to the scaffold.\"--_Dr. Conway._\r\n\r\nEight days after the execution of the Girondins another of Paine's\r\nfriends, Madame Roland, the \"Inspiring Soul\" of the Girondins--one of\r\nthe greatest, one of the fairest, one of the bravest, and one of the\r\nnoblest women that ever came to brighten our planet--died on the same\r\nscaffold. Beautiful in life, Madame Roland rose to sublimity in death.\r\nStanding on the scaffold, robed in white, she seemed like a lovely bride\r\nbefore the altar. She asked for pen and paper to record \"the strange\r\nthoughts that were rising in her\" as she gazed into the eyes of death.\r\nThis request denied, she turned toward the statue of liberty and, with\r\ntearful eyes, exclaimed, \"O Liberty, what crimes are committed in\r\nthy name!\" Then, seeing the one who was to have preceded her to the\r\nguillotine trembling with fear, she begged and obtained permission to\r\ntake his place--to die first--that she might soften the terrors of death\r\nby showing him \"how easy it is to die.\" This is her picture--painted by\r\nCarlyle: \"Noble white vision, with its high queenly face, its soft proud\r\neyes, long black hair flowing down to the girdle; and as brave a heart\r\nas ever beat in woman's bosom! Like a white Grecian statue, serenely\r\ncomplete, she shines in that black wreck of things;--long memorable.\"\r\n\r\n\"What with the arrestations and flights Paine found himself, in June,\r\nalmost alone. In the convention he was sometimes the solitary figure\r\nleft on the plain, where but now sat the brilliant statesmen of France.\r\nThey, his beloved friends, have started in procession towards the\r\nguillotine, for even flight must end there; daily others are pressed\r\ninto their ranks; his own summons, he feels, is only a question of a few\r\nweeks or days.\"--_Dr. Conway._\r\n\r\nMadame Roland died in November; Paine was imprisoned in December.\r\n\r\nDictionary of Religious Knowledge: \"Here [trial of Louis XVI] his\r\nhonorable moderation won the enmity of Robespierre, who marked him for a\r\nvictim.\"\r\n\r\nScheaf's Religious Encyclopedia: \"He had the courage to vote against the\r\nexecution of Louis XVI., and thus incurred the anger of Robespierre, who\r\nthrew him into prison.\"\r\n\r\nChambers' Encyclopedia of English Literature: \"He offended the\r\nRobespierre faction, and in 1794 [December 28, 1793], possibly by the\r\nprocurement of the American minister, Gouverneur Morris--who disliked\r\nthe French revolution and the alliance between the new republics--he was\r\nimprisoned.\"\r\n\r\nCol. Thomas W. Higginson: \"They urged him (he was in personal danger) to\r\ngo back to America, the country he had served so long. 'Go there,' they\r\nsaid; 'it is your country,' 'No,' he said, 'for the time, this is my\r\ncountry.'... So said Thomas Paine, and the doors of the Bastile closed\r\naround him.\"\r\n\r\nRev. John W. Chadwick: \"A prisoner deserted by the young Republic at\r\nwhose birth he had assisted so efficiently, his life in jeopardy for the\r\nhumanity of his opinions.\"\r\n\r\nMorning Advertiser (England, Feb. 8, 1794): \"His arrest was a species of\r\ntriumph to all the tyrants on earth. His papers had been examined, and\r\nfar from finding any dangerous propositions the committee had traced\r\nonly the characters of that burning zeal for liberty--of that eloquence\r\nof nature and philosophy--and of those principles of public morality\r\nwhich had through life procured him the hatred of despots and the love\r\nof his fellow citizens.\"\r\n\r\n\"His arrest and imprisonment, without charges preferred or even the\r\npretense of crime, were acts of perfidy without a parallel except in the\r\nhistory of the French revolution.\"--_Hon. E. B. Washburne_.\r\n\r\nMajor W. Jackson (and other Americans in Paris): \"As a countryman of\r\nours, as a man above all so dear to the Americans; who like ourselves\r\nare earnest friends of liberty, we ask you in the name of that goddess\r\ncherished by the only two republics of the world, to give back Thomas\r\nPaine to his brethren.\"\r\n\r\nAchille Audibert: \"A friend of mankind is groaning in chains--Thomas\r\nPaine.... But for Robespierre's villainy the friend of man would now be\r\nfree.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the revolution Robespierre was recognized as one\r\nof the most moderate and humane of men. In the National Assembly he\r\nadvocated the abolition of the death penalty. Describing his advent to\r\nleadership, Paine's biographer says: \"Mirabeau was on his deathbed, and\r\nPaine witnessed that historic procession, four miles long, which bore\r\nthe orator to his shrine.... With others he strained his eyes to see the\r\ncoming man; with others he sees formidable Danton glaring at Lafayette;\r\nand presently sees advancing softly between them the sentimental,\r\nphilanthropic--Robespierre.\"\r\n\r\nM. Danton: \"What thou hast done for the happiness and liberty of thy\r\ncountry I have in vain attempted to do for mine. They are sending us to\r\nthe scaffold.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a strange scene; these two constitution makers, Paine and\r\nDanton, and for the last time in the prison of the Luxembourg, both\r\nequally destined for the scaffold.\"--_Hon. E. B. Washburne_.\r\n\r\nDanton was taken to the guillotine; Paine, by mistake, was left.\r\n\r\nThe manner of Paine's escape, as related by Carlyle, was as follows:\r\n\"The tumbrils move on. But in this set of tumbrils there are two other\r\nthings notable: one notable person; and one want of a notable person.\r\nThe notable person is Lieu-tenant-General Loiserelles, a nobleman by\r\nbirth and by nature; laying down his life for his son. In the prison of\r\nSaint-Lazare, the night before last, hurrying to the grate to hear the\r\ndeath-list read, he caught the name of his son. The son was asleep at\r\nthe moment. 'I am Loiserelles,' cried the old man.... The want of the\r\nnotable person, again, is that of Deputy Paine! Paine has set in the\r\nLuxembourg since January; and seemed forgotten; but Fouquier had pricked\r\nhim at last. The turnkey, list in hand, is marking with chalk the outer\r\ndoors of to-morrow's fournee. Paine's outer door happened to be open,\r\nturned back on the wall; the turnkey marked it on the side next him, and\r\nhurried on; another turnkey came and shut it; no chalkmark now visible,\r\nthe fournee went without Paine. Paine's life lay not there.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Washington, Paine thus narrates the inhuman slaughter of\r\nhis fellow-prisoners, from whose fate he so narrowly escaped: \"The state\r\nof things in the prisons [for over four months] was a continued scene\r\nof horror. No man could count upon life for twenty-four hours. To such a\r\npitch of rage and suspicion were Robespierre and his committee arrived,\r\nthat it seemed as if they feared to leave a man to live. Scarcely a\r\nnight passed in which ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more were\r\nnot taken out of the prison, carried before a pretended tribunal in the\r\nmorning, and guillotined before night. One hundred and sixty-nine were\r\ntaken out of the Luxembourg one night in July, and one hundred and sixty\r\nof them guillotined, of whom I know I was to have been one. A list of\r\ntwo hundred more, according to the report in the prison, was preparing\r\na few days before Robespierre fell. In this last list I have good reason\r\nto believe I was included.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning this reign of terror Guizot says: \"Two thousand four hundred\r\nprisoners were registered in Paris on the books of the prison, at the\r\nmoment of the deaths of the Girondins; three [four] months later, on the\r\n1st of March, 1794, the number reached six thousand; on the 2d of May,\r\neight thousand unfortunate persons waited for death. From June 10th to\r\nJuly 27th, two thousand, two hundred and eighty-five perished on the\r\nscaffold.\" (_History of France, Vol. VI, pp. 178, 196_.) Menzies says:\r\n\"The queen, Marie Antoinette, her sister, Madame Elizabeth, Bailly, the\r\nGirondin chiefs, the Duke of Orleans, General Custine, Madame Roland,\r\nLavoisier, Malesherbes, and a thousand other illustrious heads fell by\r\nthe guillotine.\"\r\n\r\n\"The light of burning rafters flashed luridly over scenes of blood; soon\r\nall that is grotesque, or terrible, or loathsome in murder, was enacted\r\nin the streets of Paris. The lantern posts bore their ghastly fruit;\r\nthe streets flowed with crimson rivers, the life-blood of ten thousand\r\nhearts, down even to the waters of the Seine. Lafayette and Paine and\r\nall the heroes were gone from the councils of France, but in their\r\nplace, aye, in the place of poetry, enthusiasm and eloquence, spoke a\r\nmighty orator--King Guillotine.\"--_George Lippard_.\r\n\r\nWith Danton died another of Paine's cherished friends--Hérault de\r\nSechelles. Hérault, president of the National Assembly, and, for a time,\r\npresident of the National Convention, was the first to welcome Paine to\r\nParis when he came to take his seat in the convention. He was physically\r\nand intellectually one of France's most magnificent men. He was a\r\nripe scholar and a superb orator. He possessed great wealth and a most\r\nfascinating address. He and Paine and Danton had from the first been\r\nmembers of the Convention; they had served together on the Committee of\r\nthe Constitution, Hérault as Paine's suppliant, and they had occupied\r\nthe same prison, the prison set apart for the most illustrious victims\r\nof the Revolution. I quote from Washburne. I desire to present one of the\r\nten thousand tragic and pathetic scenes which compose this mighty and\r\nimmortal drama. \"Tragedy walks hand in hand with History and the eyes of\r\nGlory are wet with tears:\"\r\n\r\n\"More victims were now demanded, and, at this time, the oldest children\r\nof the Revolution were claimed. They were the 'Dantonists,' among whom\r\nwas included Hérault.... Hérault was unmarried. When imprisoned at\r\nthe Luxembourg awaiting his trial he appeared sad and preoccupied. On\r\narriving at the guillotine, on the Place de la Revolution on the day\r\nof his execution, all his looks were turned toward the hotel of the\r\nGarde-Meuble, hoping evidently to exchange glances with one with whom\r\nwere all his thoughts at that supreme moment. Behind the shutters, half\r\nclosed, was a beautiful woman who sent to the condemned a last adieu and\r\nwaved a last sigh of tenderness to the dying man: _Je t'aime_ (I love\r\nthee). It was a beautiful day of the springtime, and the crowd that had\r\nassembled to witness the execution of Danton, the great Apostle of the\r\nRevolution, and his associates was enormous. The splendid figure of\r\nHérault de Sechelles seemed to take new life, and the serenity of\r\ncourage replaced the inquietude and sadness which had settled upon him.\r\nThe first one to mount the scaffold, he showed himself calm, resolute\r\nand unmoved. As he was about to lay his head under the knife, he wished\r\nto present his cheek to the cheek of Danton [their hands were bound],\r\nas a last farewell. The aids of Samson, the executioner, prevented it.\r\n'Imbeciles!' indignantly exclaimed Danton, 'it will be but a moment\r\nbefore our heads will meet in the basket in spite of you.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Declared an outlaw by the same Convention which he had so long used as\r\nan instrument of his private vengeance, Robespierre was killed like a\r\ndog.... The death of Paine's mortal enemy saved his life.\"--_Ibid._\r\n\r\nMadame Lafayette: \"The news of your being set at liberty,... has given\r\nme a moment's consolation in the midst of this abyss of misery.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Lafayette, like Thomas Paine, was a prisoner, daily expecting\r\ndeath. Her mother, grandmother and sister, prominent members of the\r\nFrench nobility, all died together on the scaffold. Lafayette himself\r\nwas at this time confined in an Austrian dungeon.\r\n\r\nGlorious was the freedom born of the French Revolution, but terrible was\r\nthe travail.\r\n\r\nDaniel Coit Gilman, LL.D.: \"His [Minister Monroe's] effort to secure the\r\nrelease of Thomas Paine from imprisonment was a noteworthy transaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Released from prison at Monroe's intercession.\"--_Richard Hildreth._\r\n\r\nStanislaus Murray Hamilton: \"Paine was liberated by the Committee of\r\nGeneral Surety in consequence of Monroe's assertion of his American\r\ncitizenship, and demand for his release; but he had suffered an\r\nimprisonment of ten months and nine days before Monroe's generous and\r\nmanly aid reached him.\"\r\n\r\nWe owe a debt of gratitude to James Monroe.\r\n\r\nHe rescued Paine from prison and from death. When Paine was thought to\r\nbe dying, as a result of his imprisonment, the Monroes tenderly cared\r\nfor him in their own home and nursed him back to life and health.\r\nWashington's apparent neglect of Paine, which for nearly a century\r\nrested as a deep stain upon an otherwise fair name, filled Paine with\r\nastonishment and grief and caused him to write that bitter letter of\r\nreproach. It is now known that this seeming indifference of Washington\r\nwas due to the treachery of Monroe's predecessor, Gouverneur Morris.\r\n\r\nA. Outram Sherman: \"It is a long story, how his secret instructions\r\nconflicted with Paine's hearty and open love for America's ally, how\r\nMorris virtually acquiesced in his imprisonment by Robespierre as a\r\nforeigner, how Morris misled Washington to believe he had demanded\r\nPaine's release as an American, and how he misled Paine to believe that\r\nWashington had given no directions that Paine be so reclaimed.\"\r\n\r\nNelson's Encyclopedia, in its article on Paine, says: \"It seems clear\r\nthat his imprisonment was in part the result of a discreditable intrigue\r\nto which Gouverneur Morris, the American minister, was a party.\"\r\n\r\nMadison, in a letter to Jefferson, dated January 10, 1796, referring\r\nto Paine's letter to Washington, says: \"It appears that the neglect to\r\nclaim him as an American citizen when confined by Robespierre, or even\r\nto interfere in any way whatever in his favor, has filled him with\r\nan indelible rancor against the President, to whom it appears he has\r\nwritten on the subject. His letter to me is in the style of a dying one,\r\nand we hear that he is since dead of the abscess in his side, brought on\r\nby his imprisonment.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to his letter to Washington, Dr. Conway says: \"It was the\r\nnatural outcry of an ill and betrayed man to one whom we now know to\r\nhave been also betrayed. Its bitterness and wrath measure the greatness\r\nof the love that was wounded.\"\r\n\r\nRev. Eugene Rodman Shippen: \"That he was estranged from Washington\r\nthrough the malicious representations of others is one of the sad\r\nepisodes of our national life.\"\r\n\r\nM. Thibaudeau: \"It yet remains for the Convention to perform an act of\r\njustice. I reclaim one of the most zealous defenders of liberty--Thomas\r\nPaine. My reclamation is for a man who has honored his age by his\r\nenergy in defense of the rights of humanity, and who is so gloriously\r\ndistinguished by his part in the American Revolution....I demand that he\r\nbe recalled to the bosom of this Convention.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was unanimously restored to his seat in the\r\nConvention.\"--_International Encyclopedia._\r\n\r\nSamuel P. Putnam: \"Paine was self-centered. He could stand alone, like\r\na mighty rock, with seas and storms breaking upon him.

Voltaire\r\nemphasized justice, Rousseau emphasized liberty; Paine emphasized both\r\nliberty and justice.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest proofs of Paine's transcendent greatness is\r\nthe fact that while nearly all the leaders of the Revolution--even\r\nDanton--were swept from their moorings by this volcanic upheaval,\r\nPaine's career throughout was characterized by wisdom, moderation, and a\r\nmoral courage that was truly sublime.\r\n\r\nThomas Curtis:\r\n\r\n     \"When France shall lift her banners fair,\r\n     And brighter hopes shall dawn once more,\r\n     In counting up her jewels rare\r\n     She'll not forget the days of yore.\r\n     For when the name of Lafayette\r\n     Shall summon others in its train,\r\n     There's one she never will forget--\r\n     The author-hero, Thomas Paine.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Isaac F.

He sat down and wrote the 'Age of\r\nReason.'\"\r\n\r\nPaine found the world cursed with two great evils, kingcraft and\r\npriestcraft, twin vultures that from the earliest ages have fed upon the\r\nvitals of humanity. In his \"Common Sense\" and \"Rights of Man\" kingcraft\r\nwas dealt the deadliest blows that it has yet received. He had resolved\r\nto strike a blow at priestcraft before he died. Seeing imprisonment and\r\ndeath approaching he hurried to his task.

Gaynor: \"What a strange thing it is that that\r\nextraordinary man was so long set down as an Atheist. Some people still\r\nthink that he was an Atheist. And yet no man ever had a fuller belief in\r\nthe existence of God, or a greater reliance upon him.\"\r\n\r\nWashington Times: \"It is not at all difficult to find out whether or not\r\nThomas Paine was an Atheist. All one has to do to discover his opinion\r\non the subject is to go to any bookstore or circulating library, ask for\r\nhis best known work, the 'Age of Reason,' and read the first page:\"'I\r\nbelieve in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this\r\nlife.'\"\r\n\r\n\"He was, in fact, no more an Atheist than William Penn, Roger Williams\r\nor Ralph Waldo Emerson.\"--_New York World._\r\n\r\nIn his \"Age of Reason\" the recognition of a Supreme Being is made more\r\nthan two hundred times.\r\n\r\nRev. Daniel Freeman: \"There has never been a believer in God if Thomas\r\nPaine was not a believer in God.\"\r\n\r\nRev. Charles Alfred Martin (Roman Catholic): \"Thomas Paine while not a\r\nChristian, was not an Atheist. His biographers declare that he penned\r\nhis most famous book to stem with its Deism the tide of Atheism which\r\nflooded France at the time of the Revolution.\"\r\n\r\nMajor J. Weed Cory: \"Thomas Paine was not an Atheist. He wrote against\r\nAtheism, and Trinitarians will soon be appealing to his works to prove\r\nthe existence of a God.\"\r\n\r\nHenry C. Wright: \"Thomas Paine had a clear idea of God. This Being\r\nembodied his highest conception of truth, love, wisdom, mercy, liberty\r\nand power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paine was accursed as an Atheist and hunted and maligned by\r\ninstitutional religion for writing a book in defense of God.\"--_W. M.\r\nvan der Weyde._\r\n\r\nHenry Rowley: \"His 'Age of Reason' was written as much in defense of God\r\nas in opposition to the church. He could not believe that God was guilty\r\nof the cruelties and crimes which the writers of the Bible attributed to\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"The 'Age of Reason' was the protest of a highly moral man against the\r\ndoings of a deeply immoral God.\"\r\n\r\nLucy N. Colman: \"Thomas Paine's God was justice.\"\r\n\r\nBishop Watson: \"There is a philosophical sublimity in some of your ideas\r\nwhen speaking of the Creator of the universe.\"\r\n\r\nThe work of orthodox religious teachers, unwittingly to many, is\r\nconfined chiefly to the propagation of fictions and the suppression of\r\nfacts. The Christian who has been surprised to learn that Paine was not\r\nan Atheist, may be equally surprised to learn that his great compeers,\r\nWashington, Jefferson and Franklin, were not Christians, but like him,\r\nDeists.\r\n\r\nWashington, who has been claimed by the Episcopal church, was like Paine\r\na Deist: His wife was a communicant of this church. During his eight\r\nyears incumbency of the Presidency, and during the Revolution, and\r\nat other times when Mrs. Washington was with him in Philadelphia, he\r\nattended, but not regularly, the Episcopal churches of which Bishop\r\nWhite, father of the Episcopal church of America, and the Rev. Dr.\r\nAbercrombie were rectors. When Bishop White was asked if Washington had\r\never communed he replied: \"Truth requires me to say that Gen. Washington\r\nnever received the communion in the churches of which I am the parochial\r\nminister\"--_Memoir of Bishop White,_ pp. 196, 197. The _Western\r\nChristian Advocate_ accepts this testimony as conclusive. It says:\r\n\"Bishop White seems to have had more intimate relations with Washington\r\nthan any clergyman of his time. His testimony outweighs any amount of\r\ninfluential argumentation on the question.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Abercrombie says: \"On sacramental Sundays, Gen. Washington,\r\nimmediately after the desk and pulpit services went out with the greater\r\npart of the congregation--always leaving Mrs. Washington with the other\r\ncommunicants.\"--_Sprague's Annals of the American Pulpit_, vol. v., p.\r\n394.\r\n\r\nFearing the effect of Washington's example Dr. Abercrombie administered\r\na mild reproof. Washington, he says, \"never afterwards came on the\r\nmorning of sacramental Sunday.\"--_Ibid_.\r\n\r\nRegarding Washington's conduct in Virginia, the Rev. Beverly Tucker,\r\nD.D., of the Episcopal church, says: \"The General was accustomed on\r\nCommunion Sundays to leave the church with her [Nellie Custis, his\r\nstep-granddaughter], sending back the carriage for Mrs. Washington.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. William Jackson, who was at a later, period, rector of this\r\nchurch, conducted an exhaustive search to discover if possible some\r\nevidence of Washington once having communed. His search was futile. He\r\nsays: \"I find no one who ever communed with him.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the last century the Rev. E. D. Neill, a prominent clergyman of\r\nthe Episcopal church, contributed to the Episcopal _Recorder_, the organ\r\nof the Episcopal church, an article on Washington's religion. Regarding\r\nWashington's church membership he says: \"The President was not a\r\ncommunicant, notwithstanding all the pretty stories to the contrary, and\r\nafter the close of the sermon on Sacramental Sundays, had fallen into\r\nthe habit of retiring from the church while his wife remained and\r\ncommuned.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing testimony in disproof of the claim that Washington was a\r\ncommunicant, conclusive as it is, is not needed. His own testimony is\r\nsufficient. To Dr. Abercrombie he declared that \"_he had never been a\r\ncommunicant._\"--Sprague's Annals of the American Pulpit, vol. v., p.\r\n394.\r\n\r\nDuring the presidential campaign of 1880, the Christian Union, at that\r\ntime the leading church paper of this country, made the frank admission\r\nthat of the nineteen men who up to that time had held the office of\r\nPresident of the United States, not one, with the possible exception of\r\nWashington, had been a member of a Christian church. And Washington, as\r\nwe have seen, cannot be made an exception.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing to show that he [Washington] was ever a member of the\r\nchurch.\"--_St. Louis Globe._\r\n\r\n\"He [Washington] belonged to no church.\"--_Western Christian Advocate._\r\n\r\n\"In all the voluminous writings of General Washington, the Holy name of\r\nJesus Christ is never once written.\"--_Catholic World_.\r\n\r\n\"In several thousand letters the name of Jesus Christ never appears,\r\nand it is notably absent from his last will.\"--_General A. W. Greeley in\r\nLadies' Home Journal for April, 1896._\r\n\r\n\"It has been confidently stated to me that he actually refused spiritual\r\naid when it was proposed to send for a clergyman.\"--_Robert Dale Owen_.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Ashbel Green, president of Princeton College, signer of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, member of Congress, and chaplain to\r\nCongress during Washington's administration, says: \"Like nearly all the\r\nfounders of the Republic, he [Washington] was not a Christian, but a\r\nDeist.\" \"He had no belief at all in the divine origin of the Bible.\"\r\n\r\nDuring Jackson's administration the Rev. Dr. Wilson, a noted\r\nPresbyterian divine of Albany, preached a famous sermon on \"The Religion\r\nof the Presidents,\" which was published and had a wide circulation. Dr.\r\nWilson showed that of the seven men who up to that time had been elected\r\npresident, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, John Quincy\r\nAdams, and Jackson, not one had professed a belief in Christianity.\r\nIn his search for evidence he visited the Washingtons' old pastor, Dr.\r\nAbercrombie. In answer to Dr. Wilson's inquiry concerning Washington's\r\nreligious belief Dr. Abercrombie's emphatic answer was, \"Sir, Washington\r\nwas a Deist.\" As a result of his investigation Dr. Wilson says: \"I think\r\nanyone who will candidly do as I have done, will come to the conclusion\r\nthat he [Washington] was a Deist and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone is familiar with the story of Washington's praying at Valley\r\nForge. This is a pure fiction. Intelligent Christians reject it. The\r\nRev. E. D. Neill, of the Episcopal church, whose father's uncle owned\r\nthe building occupied by Washington at Valley Forge, says: \"With the\r\ncapacious and comfortable house at his disposal, it is hardly possible\r\nthat the shy, silent, cautious Washington should leave such retirement\r\nand enter the leafless woods, in the vicinity of the winter encampment\r\nof an army and engage in audible prayer.\"--_Episcopal Recorder_.\r\n\r\nAlluding to this subject, the Rev. Dr. Minot J. Savage, in a sermon,\r\nsaid: \"The pictures that represent him on his knees in the winter forest\r\nat Valley Forge are silly caricatures.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Conway, who was employed to edit Washington's letters, and who is\r\nconsidered one of the best authorities on his domestic life, says:\r\n\"Many clergymen visited him, but they were never invited to hold family\r\nprayers, and no grace was ever said at table.\"\r\n\r\nWashington's library contained the Deistical works of Paine, Voltaire\r\nand other Freethinkers. When the French Freethinker Volney visited this\r\ncountry he was the guest of Washington.\r\n\r\n\"His services as a vestryman had no special significance from a\r\nreligious standpoint. The political affairs of a Virginia county were\r\nthen directed by the vestry, which, having the power to elect its\r\nown members, was an important instrument of the oligarchy of\r\nVirginia.\"--_General A. W. Greeley in Ladies' Home Journal._\r\n\r\nGeorge Wilson, whose ancestors occupied the pew next to Washington's in\r\nVirginia, says.: \"At that time the vestry was the county court, and in\r\norder to have a hand in managing the affairs of the county, in which his\r\nlarge property lay, regulating the levy of taxes, etc., Washington had\r\nto be a vestryman.\"\r\n\r\nJefferson was a more radical Freethinker than Paine, as the following\r\npassages from his writings will show. My quotations are from Randolph's\r\nedition of Jefferson's works, published in 1829.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to his nephew and ward, Peter Carr, while at school,\r\nJefferson writes: \"Read the Bible as you would Livy or Tacitus... Fix\r\nreason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact,\r\nevery opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a\r\nGod.\"--_Jefferson's Works, Vol. ii, P. 217._\r\n\r\nThe God of the Old Testament, the God that Christians worship,\r\nJefferson pronounces \"a being of terrific character--cruel, vindictive,\r\ncapricious, and unjust.\"--_Works, vol. iv, p. 325._\r\n\r\nIn the Four Gospels, which Christians consider the most authentic and\r\nthe most important books of the Bible, Jefferson discovers what he\r\nterms \"a groundwork of vulgar ignorance, of things impossible, of\r\nsuperstitions, fanaticisms, and fabrications.\"--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\"Among the sayings and discourses imputed to him [Jesus] by his\r\nbiographers [Matthew, Mark, Luke and John], I find many passages of fine\r\nimagination, correct morality, and of the most lovely benevolence;\r\nand others, again, of so much ignorance, of so much absurdity, so\r\nmuch untruth and imposture, as to pronounce it impossible that such\r\ncontradictions should have proceeded from the same being. I separate,\r\ntherefore, the gold from the dross, restore to him the former, and leave\r\nthe latter to the stupidity of some and the roguery of others of his\r\ndisciples.\"--_Works, vol. iv. p. 320._\r\n\r\nJefferson made a compilation of the finer alleged sayings of Jesus which\r\nhave been published and paraded as proof of Jefferson's acceptance of\r\nChrist. For the man Jesus, Jefferson, like Paine, Ingersoll and other\r\nFreethinkers, had the greatest admiration, but for the Christ Jesus of\r\northodox Christianity he had the greatest contempt.\r\n\r\n\"Of this band of dupes and impostors, Paul was the great Corypheus, and\r\nfirst corrupter of the doctrines of Jesus.\"--_Vol. iv. p. 327._\r\n\r\n\"It is too late in the day for men of sincerity to pretend they believe\r\nin the Platonic mysticism that three are one and one is three... But\r\nthis constitutes the craft, the power and profit of the priests. Sweep\r\naway their gossamer fabrics of fictitious religion and they would catch\r\nno more flies.\"--_Ibid, p. 205._\r\n\r\n\"The Christian priesthood, finding the doctrines of Christ leveled\r\nto every understanding, and too plain to need explanation, saw in\r\nthe mysticisms of Plato materials with which they might build up\r\nan artificial system, which might, from its indistinctness, admit\r\neverlasting controversy, give employment for their order and introduce\r\nit to profit, power and preeminence.\"--_Ibid, p. 242._\r\n\r\n\"The hocus-pocus phantasm of a God, like another Cerberus, with one body\r\nand three heads had its birth and growth in the blood of thousands and\r\nthousands of martyrs.\"--_Ibid, p. 360._\r\n\r\n\"The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the Supreme\r\nBeing as his father in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the\r\nfable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter.\"--_Ibid, p.\r\n365._\r\n\r\n\"In our Richmond there is much fanaticism, but chiefly among the women.\r\nThey have their night meetings and praying parties, where, attended by\r\ntheir priests and sometimes by a henpecked husband, they pour forth the\r\neffusions of their love to Jesus in terms as amatory and carnal as their\r\nmodesty would permit to a mere earthly lover.\"--_Ibid, p. 358._\r\n\r\n\"Jefferson occupied his Sundays at Monticello in writing letters to\r\nPaine (they are unpublished I believe, but I have seen them) in favor\r\nof the probabilities that Christ and his Twelve Apostles were only\r\npersonifications of the sun and the Twelve signs of the Zodiac.\"--_Dr.\r\nConway._\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of Jefferson and Paine would fill a volume. In these\r\nletters Jefferson unbosomed himself and gave expression to his most\r\nradical sentiments. Randolph's edition of Jefferson's works was\r\npublished twenty years after Paine's death. By this time the Orthodox\r\nghouls had about completed their work and these letters, although\r\ncontaining some of Jefferson's most mature thoughts and best writings,\r\nremained unpublished.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Dr. Woods, Jefferson says: \"I have recently been\r\nexamining all the known superstitions of the world, and do not find in\r\nour particular superstition [Christianity] one redeeming feature.\r\nThey are all alike, founded upon fables and mythologies.\" \"Millions\r\nof innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of\r\nChristianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, and imprisoned; yet we\r\nhave not advanced one inch toward uniformity. What has been the effect\r\nof coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other half\r\nhypocrites.\"--_Jefferson's Notes on Virginia._\r\n\r\nWriting to Jefferson on the 5th of May, 1817, John Adams, giving\r\nexpression to the matured conviction of eighty-two years, says: \"This\r\nwould be the best of all possible worlds if there were no religion in\r\nit.\" To this radical declaration Jefferson replied: \"If by religion we\r\nare to understand sectarian dogmas in which no two of them agree, then\r\nyour declaration on that hypothesis is just, 'that this would be the\r\nbest of worlds, if there were no religion in it.'\"--_Works, vol. iv. p.\r\n301._\r\n\r\nWriting to John Adams just before his death Jefferson makes the\r\nfollowing declaration of his belief: \"I am a Materialist.\"\r\n\r\n\"A question has been raised as to Thomas Jefferson's religious views.\r\nThere need be no question, for he has settled that himself. He was an\r\nInfidel, or, as he chose to term it, a Materialist. By his own account\r\nhe was as heterodox as Colonel Inger-soll, and in some respects even\r\nmore so.\"--_Chicago Tribune._\r\n\r\nAlluding to Jefferson's belief the Rev. Dr. Wilson in his sermon on\r\n\"The Religion of the Presidents,\" previously quoted, says: \"Whatever\r\ndifference of opinion there may have been at the time [of his election],\r\nit is now rendered certain that he was a Deist.... Since his death, and\r\nthe publication of Randolph, [Jefferson's Works], there remains not the\r\nshadow of doubt of his Infidel principles. If any man thinks there is,\r\nlet him look at the book itself. I do not recommend the purchase of\r\nit to any man, for it is one of the most wicked and dangerous books\r\nextant.\"\r\n\r\n\"In religion he was a Freethinker; in morals pure and\r\nunspotted.\"--_Benson J. Lossing, in his \"Lives of the Signers of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence!'_\r\n\r\n\"Surely, Christians, your cause must be growing desperate, when, to\r\nsustain it, you must needs claim for its support so bitter an enemy as\r\nThomas Jefferson--a man who affirmed that he was a Materialist; a man\r\nwho recognized in your religion only \"our particular superstition,\"\r\na superstition without \"one redeeming feature;\" a man who divided the\r\nChristian world into two classes--\"hypocrites and fools;\" a man who\r\nasserted that your Bible is a book abounding with \"vulgar ignorance;\"\r\na man who termed your Father, Son, and Holy Ghost a \"hocus-pocus\r\nphantasm;\" a man who denounced your God as \"cruel, vindictive, and\r\nunjust;\" a man who intimated that your Savior was \"a man of illegitimate\r\nbirth;\" a man who declared his disciples, including your oracle Paul,\r\nto be a \"band of dupes and impostors and who characterized your\r\nmodern priesthood, of all denominations, as cannibal priests\" and an\r\n\"abandoned confederacy\" against public happiness.\"--_The Fathers of Our\r\nRepublic._\r\n\r\nFranklin rejected Christianity when a boy and remained a Rationalist to\r\nthe end of his life.\r\n\r\n\"Some volumes against deism fell into my hands. They were said to be the\r\nsubstance of sermons preached at Boyle's lecture. It happened that they\r\nproduced on me an effect precisely the reverse of what was intended by\r\nthe writers; for the arguments of the deists, which were cited in order\r\nto be refuted, appealed to me much more forcibly than the refutation\r\nitself. In a word I soon became a thorough Deist.\"--_Franklin's\r\nAutobiography._\r\n\r\nWriting to Ezra Stiles, President of Yale College, when he was\r\neighty-four, he says: \"I have with most of the Dissenters in England,\r\ndoubts as to his [Christ's] divinity.\"\r\n\r\n\"By heaven we understand a state of happiness, infinite in degree and\r\neternal in duration. I can do nothing to deserve such a reward.... I\r\nhave not the vanity to think I deserve it, the folly to expect, or the\r\nambition to desire it.\"--_Franklin's Works, vol. vii., p. 75._\r\n\r\n\"I wish it [Christianity] were more productive of good works than I have\r\ngenerally seen it. I mean real good works, works of kindness, charity,\r\nmercy, and public spirit, not holy-day keeping, sermon hearing and\r\nreading, performing church ceremonies, or making long prayers, filled\r\nwith flatteries and compliments, despised even by wise men, and much\r\nless capable of pleasing the Deity.\"--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\"Nowadays we have scarcely a little parson that does not think it the\r\nduty of every man within his reach to sit under his petty ministration,\r\nand that whoever omits this offends God. To such I wish more\r\nhumility.\"--_Franklin's Works, vol. vii. pp. 76,77._\r\n\r\n\"The government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the\r\nChristian religion,\" affirmed Washington (treaty with Tripoli). \"Keep\r\nthe church and the state forever separate,\" said Grant (Des Moines\r\nspeech). And yet, in spite of this declaration and this admonition\r\nreligious liberty has been ignored and a practical union of church and\r\nstate has been maintained--the exemption of ecclesiastical property\r\nfrom taxation, the employment of chaplains, appropriations for sectarian\r\npurposes, religious services, including the use of the Bible, in our\r\npublic schools, the appointment of religious festivals, the judicial\r\noath and the enforced observance of Sunday as a Sabbath. Concerning\r\nthese and similar privileges of his time and of our time, Franklin\r\nsays: \"I think they were invented not so much to secure religion as the\r\nemoluments of it. When a religion is good I conceive it will support\r\nitself; and when it does not support itself, and God does not take care\r\nto support it, so that its professors are obliged to call for help\r\nof the civil power, 'tis a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad\r\none.\"--_Franklin's Works, vol. viii., p. 506._\r\n\r\nTheodore Parker, in his \"Four Historic Americans,\" writes as follows\r\nconcerning Franklin's belief: \"If belief in the miraculous revelation of\r\nthe Old Testament and the New is required to make a man religious, then\r\nFranklin had no religion at all. It would be an insult to say that he\r\nbelieved in the popular theology of his time, or of ours, for I find not\r\na line from his pen indicating any such belief.\"\r\n\r\nThe eminent statesman John Hay, in an article on \"Franklin in France,\"\r\npublished after his death in the _Century Magazine_ for January, 1906,\r\nascribes much of Franklin's popularity in France to his espousal of\r\nFreethought. He says: \"Franklin became the fashion of the season. For\r\nthe court dabbled a little in liberal ideas. So powerful was the vast\r\nimpulse of Freethought that then influenced the mind of France--that\r\nsusceptible French mind, that always answers like the wind harp to the\r\nbreath of every true human aspiration--that even the highest classes\r\nhad caught the infection of liberalism.\" Among Franklin's most intimate\r\ncompanions in France Mr. Hay mentions Voltaire, D'Alembert, D'Holbach,\r\nand Condorcet, four of France's most radical Freethinkers.\r\n\r\nDr. Franklin and Dr. Priestley were intimate friends. After Franklin's\r\ndeath Dr. Priestley wrote: \"It is much to be lamented that a man of\r\nFranklin's general good character and great influence should have been\r\nan unbeliever in Christianity, and also have done as much as he did to\r\nmake others unbelievers.\"--_Priestley's Autobiography, p. 60._\r\n\r\nThis great man was himself denounced as an Infidel. He was a Unitarian,\r\nand was mobbed and driven from England on account of his heretical\r\nopinions and his sympathy with the French Revolution. Franklin's\r\nInfidelity must have been very pronounced to have provoked the censure\r\nof Dr. Priestley.\r\n\r\nThere has been published a religious tract, entitled \"Don't Unchain the\r\nTiger,\" which purports to be a letter from Franklin to Paine, advising\r\nhim not to publish his \"Age of Reason.\" The only thing needed to cause a\r\nrejection of this pious fiction is a knowledge of the fact that Franklin\r\nhad been dead nearly four years when the first page of Paine's book was\r\nwritten. Besides, the opinions expressed in this book were the opinions\r\nof Franklin. Paine's biographer, Dr. Conway, says: \"Paine's deism\r\ndiffered from Franklin's only in being more fervently religious.\"\r\nFranklin's biographer, James Parton, says: \"It ['Age of Reason']\r\ncontains not a position which Franklin, John Adams, Jefferson and\r\nTheodore Parker would have dissented from.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Snyder, of St. Louis, says: \"Paine shared the religious\r\nconvictions of Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton and Franklin.\"\r\nConcerning the belief of these and other noted men, the Rev. Dr. Swing,\r\nof Chicago, says: \"Voltaire, Bolingbroke, Pitt, Burke, Washington,\r\nLafayette, Jefferson, Paine and Franklin moved along in a wonderful\r\nunity of belief, both political and religious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paine wrote the 'Age of Reason' in Paris some years after Franklin\r\nwas dead.... The letter called the letter of Franklin to Paine bears no\r\naddress or date or signature. It may not have been written by Franklin\r\nto anybody. The evangelists who cite this letter intend to convey the\r\nimpression that the 'Tiger' means unbelief. The indication is that the\r\nwriter had in his mind the beast of fanaticism and detraction. That\r\ntiger was let loose by the 'Age of Reason' against its author, and the\r\nanimal and its whelps are still with us.\"--_George E. Macdonald._\r\n\r\nAnother Franklin myth is that concerning Franklin's motion for prayers\r\nin the Convention that framed our Constitution. The Convention, it is\r\nclaimed, had labored for weeks without accomplishing anything when, at\r\nFranklin's suggestion, its sessions were opened with prayer, after\r\nwhich its work was speedily performed. While Franklin's proposal was not\r\ninconsistent with his Deistic belief it was not adopted. There was not a\r\nprayer offered from the opening to the close of the Convention. Franklin\r\nhimself says: \"The Convention, except three or four persons, thought\r\nprayers unnecessary.\"\r\n\r\nWashington, Jefferson, Franklin and Paine were four of the greatest and\r\nnoblest of men. All held substantially the same religious opinions. All\r\nwere Deists. All rejected Christianity. Yet Washington, Jefferson and\r\nFranklin are held in grateful remembrance, while Paine has been reviled\r\nas no other man has been reviled. How do we account for this? Paine's\r\nmere rejection of Christianity does not account for it.\r\n\r\nThe \"Age of Reason\" was suppressed by the government in England. In\r\nAmerica it could not be suppressed by law. The only way the clergy could\r\nsuppress it here was to resort to slander, to cover its author's name\r\nwith obloquy and make him appear so vile that no respectable bookseller\r\nwould dare to sell it and no respectable reader dare to read it.\r\n\r\n\"In England it was easy for Paine's chief antagonist, the bishop of\r\nLlandaff [Watson] to rebuke Paine's strong language, when his lordship\r\ncould sit serenely in the House of Peers with knowledge that his\r\nopponent was answered with handcuffs for every Englishman who sold his\r\nbook. But in America slander had to take the place of handcuffs.\"--_Dr.\r\nConway._\r\n\r\nHenry A. Beers: \"His book was denounced from a hundred pulpits and\r\ncopies of it were carefully locked away from the sight of 'the young,'\r\nwhose religious beliefs it might undermine.\"\r\n\r\nJames B. Elliott, of Philadelphia, says he well remembers the \"time when\r\nit was impossible to obtain the 'Age of Reason' except under cover\r\nof the greatest secrecy and when he who was known to have read it was\r\nshunned as a dangerous person.\"\r\n\r\nHugh O. Pentecost: \"Paine's offense was not that he was an Infidel, but\r\nthat he made his meaning so clear that the common people could become\r\nInfidels, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true that Paine was Republican and Deist, an enemy of kings\r\nand churches. But many men of great and undimmed honor held the same\r\nprinciples: Washington, Jefferson and Franklin and others of the\r\n'Fathers' were Deists, and in England that creed was even fashionable in\r\ncertain aristocratic quarters. Paine's real sin was not that he preached\r\nDeism in the land of Bolingbroke, Hume and Gibbon,... but that he\r\nsucceeded for the first time in inoculating the people with his\r\nheresies.\"--_The Nation, London._\r\n\r\n\"Mimnermus,\" an English writer, says: \"There were critics of the Bible,\r\nit is true, before Paine's day, but they were mainly scholars whose\r\nworks were not easily understood by ordinary folk. Paine himself, a man\r\nof genius, had sprung from the people, and he spoke their tongue and\r\nmade their thoughts articulate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paine held that the people at large had the right of access to all new\r\nideas, and he wrote so as to reach the people. Hence, his book must be\r\nsuppressed.\"--_Prof. J. B. Bury, LL.D._\r\n\r\nJohn S. Crosby: \"The reason why his writings are excluded from our\r\ncolleges is not on account of what he said about the _prophets_, but for\r\nfear that the realization of his ideas may diminish the _profits_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Recognizing the magic influence that a great name carries with it, the\r\nclergy have inscribed in the Christian roster the names of hundreds\r\nwho were total disbelievers in their dogmas. As the venders of quack\r\nnostrums attach the forged certificates of distinguished individuals to\r\ntheir worthless drugs, to make them sell, so these theological venders\r\npresent the manufactured endorsements of the great to make their\r\nnostrums popular. Washington, Jefferson and Franklin have all been\r\ndenominated Christians, not because they were such, for they were not,\r\nbut because of the influence that attaches to their names. Paine's\r\nopposition to priestcraft was too pronounced and too well known to claim\r\nhim as an adherent of their faith, and so they have sought to destroy\r\nhis influence by destroying his good name. Not only this, knowing the\r\nprejudice that has prevailed against Atheism, they have misrepresented\r\nhis theological opinions and declared him an Atheist.\"--_The Fathers of\r\nOur Republic._\r\n\r\n\"This injustice to him was perpetrated in defense of a system that\r\ndoes not care, because it does not dare to have its credentials and\r\nfoundation critically examined; in other words, Paine has been maligned\r\nfor more than a century by those interested in keeping veiled the image;\r\nhe did what he could--and it was much--to uncover to the gaze of the\r\nworld.\"--_E. C. Walker._\r\n\r\nWilliam M. Salter, A. M.: \"It is to the shame of religious prejudice in\r\nour country that he is not freely and gladly given his place alongside\r\nof Franklin and Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rankest ingratitude the American people have ever exhibited has\r\nbeen that of the systematic attempt to blot the name of Paine from the\r\nmemory of succeeding generations, and to allow no historical mention\r\nin the annals of the nation which he greatly and gloriously helped to\r\nfound. But with the destruction of every error truth rises clear and\r\nbright. The time will come when his picture will be as familiar to\r\nschool children as those of his great contemporaries, Washington,\r\nJefferson and Franklin.\"--. _J. B. Wilson._\r\n\r\nPretended reviewers of Paine, including the authors of many encyclopedic\r\narticles on Paine, writers who, for the most part, never read the\r\n\"Age of Reason,\" characterize it as crude and superficial, declare its\r\narguments to be weak and fallacious and its author to have had little\r\nor no influence in changing the religious opinions of his time. It is a\r\nsufficient answer to these critics to cite the fact that from thirty\r\nto forty elaborate replies from Christian writers followed it in rapid\r\nsuccession, each writer tacitly admitting that it needed answering and\r\nthat all preceding efforts to answer it had been failures.\r\n\r\nPaine's orthodox critics also affect to believe that his \"Age of Reason\"\r\nis no longer read, that it is an \"out of print\" book for which there is\r\nno demand. The fact is ever since the first London and Paris editions\r\nwere published in 1794 there has been a constant and widespread demand\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nMillions of copies have been printed and sold during this time, and\r\ntoday the demand for it is greater than ever before.\r\n\r\nDr. John W. Francis (referring to \"Age of Reason\"): \"No work had the\r\ndemand for readers comparable to that of Paine.\"\r\n\r\nOne bookseller of New York says that his sales of the \"Age of Reason\"\r\nnow average more than five thousand copies a year. He is but one of many\r\nNew York booksellers who sell Paine's book, while New York is but one\r\nof many cities where it has an extensive sale. A Chicago bookseller says\r\nthat the \"Age of Reason\" is his best seller, that he sells thousands of\r\nthem every year.\r\n\r\nWilliam Heaford (1913): \"Two large editions of forty thousand copies\r\neach will be issued of this invaluable edition of Paine's great text\r\nbook of Biblical exegesis [by Watts & Co., London].\"\r\n\r\n\"There were sold in Burma [mostly to Buddhists] over ten thousand copies\r\nof the 'Age of Reason' last year.\"--_U.

Moss: \"During the past fifty years hundreds of thousands\r\nof copies of the 'Age of Reason' have been circulated in England and\r\nAmerica alone....

T. Stead._\r\n\r\nHenry Yorke (with Paine in England and France): \"There is not a verse in\r\nit [the Bible] that is not familiar to him.\"\r\n\r\nJ. P. Mendum: \"As a critic and reviewer of the Bible his 'Age of Reason'\r\nis unanswerable.\"\r\n\r\nSir Leslie Stephen: \"Paine's book announced a startling fact, against\r\nwhich all the flimsy collections of conclusive proofs were powerless.\r\nIt amounted to a proclamation that the creed no longer satisfied the\r\ninstincts of cultivated scholars. When the defenders of the old orders\r\ntried to conjure with the old charms, the magic had gone out of them.\r\nIn Paine's rough tones they recognized not the mere echo of coffee-house\r\ngossip, but the voice of deep popular passion. Once and forever, it\r\nwas announced that, for the average mass of mankind, the old creed was\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\nElbert Hubbard: \"As Paine's book 'Common Sense,' broke the power of\r\nGreat Britain in America, and the 'Rights of Man' gave free speech and\r\na free press to England, so did the 'Age of Reason' give pause to the\r\njuggernaut of orthodoxy. Thomas Paine was the legitimate ancestor of\r\nHosea Ballou who founded the Universalist church, and of Theodore\r\nParker who made Unitarianism in America an intellectual torch. Channing,\r\nRipley,' Bartol, Martineau, Frothingham, Hale, Curtis, Collyer, Swing,\r\nThomas, Conway, Leonard, Savage, Crapsey, yes--even Emerson, and\r\nThoreau, were spiritual children, all, of Thomas Paine. He blazed the\r\nway and made it possible, for men to preach the sweet reasonableness of\r\nreason. He was the pioneer in a jungle of superstition.\"\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln became and remained a disciple of Thomas Paine.\r\n\r\nChicago Herald (Feb., 1892): \"In 1834, at New Salem, Ill., Lincoln read\r\nand circulated Vol-ney's 'Ruins' and Paine's 'Age of Reason,' giving to\r\nboth books the sincere recommendation of his unqualified approval.\"\r\n\r\nCol. Ward H. Lamon (biographer of Lincoln): \"He [Lincoln] had made\r\nhimself familiar with the writings of Paine and Volney--the 'Ruins'\r\nof the one, and the 'Age of Reason' of the other,... and then wrote a\r\ndeliberate essay wherein he reached conclusions similar to theirs.\"\r\n\r\n\"In this work he intended to demonstrate:\r\n\r\n\"'First, that the Bible was not God's revelation;\r\n\r\n\"'Secondly, that Jesus was not the Son of God.'\"\r\n\r\n(Lincoln's work was never published.)\r\n\r\n\"You insist on knowing something which you know I possess, and got as\r\na secret, and that is, about Lincoln's little book on Infidelity.\r\nMr. Lincoln did tell me that he _did write a little book on\r\nInfidelity_\"--_Col. James H. Matheny, Lincoln's political manager in\r\nIllinois._\r\n\r\nJames Ford Rhodes, LL.D.: \"When Lincoln entered upon political life\r\nhe became reticent regarding his religious opinions, for at the age of\r\ntwenty-five, influenced by Thomas Paine,... he had written an extended\r\nessay against Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nHon. W. H. Herndon (law partner of Lincoln): \"Paine became a part of Mr.\r\nLincoln from 1834 to the end of his life.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was my good fortune to have had for some years an intimate\r\nacquaintance with Lincoln's partner for twenty-two years. Mr. Herndon\r\nwas a man of academic education, and possessed a number of books that\r\nin that day would be considered a good library, and he told me that the\r\nbooks of his which fairly fascinated Lincoln were Volney's 'Ruins'\r\nand the works of Thomas Paine, especially the latter, of which he had\r\nmemorized many pages.\"--Col. E. A. Stevens.\r\n\r\nHon. James Tuttle: \"He [Lincoln] was one of the most ardent admirers\r\nof Thomas Paine I ever met. He was continually quoting from the 'Age of\r\nReason.'\"\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed that Lincoln changed his religious opinions after\r\nhe became President. In a letter, written May 27, 1865, Col. John\r\nG. Nicolay, his private secretary, says: \"Mr. Lincoln did not, to my\r\nknowledge, in any way, change his religious ideas, opinions, or beliefs,\r\nfrom the time he left Springfield till the day of his death.\"\r\n\r\nHon. Leonard Swett, who placed Lincoln in nomination for the Presidency,\r\nin answer to an inquiry from a friend, wrote as follows: \"You ask me\r\nif Lincoln changed his religion towards the close of his life. I think\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nNext to Mr. Herndon, Lincoln's biographer, Colonel Lamon, has made the\r\nfullest and fairest presentation of Lincoln's religious opinions. He did\r\nnot accept them but he was familiar with them and he was honest enough\r\nto present them. In Illinois he was the friend and confidant of Lincoln.\r\nWhen the time approached for Lincoln to take the Executive chair, and\r\nthe journey from Springfield to Washington was deemed a dangerous one,\r\nto Colonel Lamon was intrusted the responsible duty of conducting him\r\nto the national capital. During the eventful years that followed he\r\nremained at the President's side, holding an important official position\r\nin the District of Columbia. When Lincoln was assassinated, at the great\r\nfuneral pageant in Washington, he led the civic procession, and was,\r\nwith Judge David Davis and Major General Hunter, selected to convey\r\nthe remains to their final resting-place at Springfield. Regarding his\r\nfriend's religious belief Colonel Lamon says: \"Mr. Lincoln was never a\r\nmember of any church, nor did he believe in the divinity of Christ or\r\nthe inspiration of the scriptures in the sense understood by evangelical\r\nChristians\" (Life of Lincoln, p. 486). indefinite expressions about\r\n'Divine Providence,' the 'Justice of God,' 'the favor of the Most High,'\r\nwere easy and not inconsistent with his religious notions. In this\r\naccordingly he indulged freely; but never in all that time [1834 to\r\nhis death] did he let fall from his lips or his pen an expression which\r\nremotely implied the slightest faith in Jesus as the Son of God and the\r\nSavior of men (Ibid, p. 502).\r\n\r\nAfter Lincoln's death Mrs. Lincoln, herself a Christian, made the\r\nfollowing statement: \"Mr. Lincoln had no hope, and no faith, in the\r\nusual acceptation of those words\" (Lamon's Life of Lincoln, p. 489).\r\n\r\nJudge David Davis, his life-long friend and his executor, says: \"He\r\n[Lincoln] had no faith, in the Christian sense of the term.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln did not believe in a personal God. His law partner, W. H.\r\nHerndon, relates the following in proof of this: In 1854 he asked me to\r\nerase the word _God_ from a speech which I had written and read to him\r\nfor criticism, because my language indicated a personal God, whereas\r\nhe insisted that no such personality ever existed.\"--_Lamon's Life of\r\nLincoln, p. 445._\r\n\r\nThe Gettysburg address, as delivered by Lincoln, contained no mention\r\nof Deity. The phrase \"under God\" was inserted afterward, with Lincoln's\r\nconsent, at the earnest solicitation of a friend. The recognition of God\r\nin the Emancipation Proclamation was inserted at the urgent request of\r\nSecretary Chase. The pious phrases to be found in his state papers are\r\nmostly the work of his cabinet ministers and secretaries.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago Judge James M. Nelson, a son of Thomas Pope Nelson,\r\na distinguished statesman of Kentucky, and a great-grandson of Thomas\r\nNelson, Jr., signer of the Declaration of Independence, who was\r\nintimately acquainted with Lincoln, both in Illinois and at Washington,\r\npublished in the Louisville _Times_ his \"Reminiscences of Abraham\r\nLincoln.\" Concerning Lincoln's religious belief Judge Nelson says:\r\n\r\n\"In religion Mr. Lincoln was of about the same belief as Colonel\r\nIngersoll, and there is no account of his ever having changed. He went\r\nto church a few times with his family while he was President, but so far\r\nas I have been able to find he remained an unbeliever.... I asked him\r\nonce about his fervent Thanksgiving Message and twitted him with being\r\nan unbeliever in what was published. 'Oh,' said he, '_that is some of\r\nSeward's nonsense, and it pleases the fools!_\"\r\n\r\nCol. Amos C. Babcock, for many years chairman of the Illinois State\r\nRepublican Committee, and one of Lincoln's confidential agents during\r\nthe war, in an article published in the Peoria _Journal_, says: \"Lincoln\r\nwas an Agnostic. During the war he sometimes talked religiously, but it\r\nwas mere statecraft. He knew that everything depended upon his having\r\nthe support of the religious people,... but he was for all that an utter\r\ndisbeliever in the Christian religion.\"\r\n\r\nIn Springfield, where he lived, Lincoln's rejection of Christianity was\r\nknown to every person and while he was very popular and greatly beloved\r\nby all who were not dominated by their religious prejudices, the bigots\r\nalways opposed him. During the presidential campaign of 1860 his\r\nfriends made a canvass of the voters of Springfield for the purpose of\r\nascertaining how they were going to vote for president. The list was\r\ngiven to Lincoln. With Hon. Newton Bateman, state superintendent of\r\npublic instruction, he went over it carefully, his principal desire\r\nbeing to know how the clergy were going to vote. When they had\r\nfinished Lincoln said: \"Here are twenty-three ministers, of different\r\ndenominations, and all of them are against me but three; and here are a\r\ngreat many prominent' members of the churches, a very great majority of\r\nwhom are against me.\"--_Holland's Life of Lincoln, p. 236._\r\n\r\nWhy, it may be asked, was Lincoln's Infidelity not used against him\r\neverywhere in this campaign? Because the managers of both parties knew\r\nthat Douglas, also, was a disbeliever in Christianity. An agitation\r\nof this question would have weakened the chances of both northern\r\ncandidates while it would have strengthened the chances of Breckinridge,\r\nthe southern candidate.\r\n\r\nLincoln did not believe in prayer. All the stories about his praying,\r\nwithout a single exception, are pure inventions. Let me cite an example.\r\nAfter Lincoln's death the _Western Christian Advocate_ published the\r\nfollowing story, a companion piece to Washington's prayer at Valley\r\nForge: \"On the day of the receipt of the capitulation of Lee, as we\r\nlearn from a friend intimate with the late President Lincoln, the\r\ncabinet meeting was held an hour earlier than usual. Neither the\r\nPresident nor any member was able, for a time, to give utterance to his\r\nfeelings. At the suggestion of Mr. Lincoln all dropped on their\r\nknees, and offered in silence and in tears their humble and heartfelt\r\nacknowledgment to the Almighty for the triumph he had granted to the\r\nnational cause.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to an inquiry respecting the authenticity of this story Hugh\r\nMcCulloch, Lincoln's last secretary of the treasury, wrote as follows:\r\n\"The description of what occurred at the Executive Mansion, when the\r\nintelligence was received of the surrender of the Confederate forces,\r\nwhich you quote from the _Western Christian Advocate_, is not only\r\nabsolutely groundless, but absurd. After I became Secretary of the\r\nTreasury I was present at every Cabinet meeting, and I never saw Mr.\r\nLincoln or any of his ministers upon his knees or in tears.\"\r\n\r\nOur works of art are mostly mythological. And this is true of Christian\r\nart, as it is true of Christian theology. The Washington myth is now\r\npreserved in bronze, and the Lincoln myth will some day find expression\r\non canvas.\r\n\r\nHerndon says: \"It is my opinion that no man ever heard Mr. Lincoln pray\r\nin the true evangelical sense of that word. His philosophy is against\r\nall human prayer as a means of reversing God's decrees.\"\r\n\r\nThe partnership of Lincoln and Herndon was formed in 1843. It was\r\ndissolved by the assassin's bullet in 1865. The love of these men\r\nfor each other was like the love of Damon and Pythias. To the moral\r\ncharacter of his illustrious partner Mr. Herndon pays this tribute: \"The\r\nbenevolence of his impulses., the seriousness of his convictions, and\r\nthe nobility of his character, are evidences unimpeachable that his soul\r\nwas ever filled with the exalted purity and the sublime faith of natural\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln's religion was the religion of Thomas Paine. \"To do good is my\r\nreligion,\" said Paine; \"When I do good I feel good, and when I do bad I\r\nfeel bad,\" said Lincoln.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years the church endeavored to crush Lincoln, but when, in\r\nspite of her malignant opposition, he achieved a glorious immortality,\r\nthis same church, to hide the mediocrity of her devotees, attempts to\r\nsteal his deathless name.\r\n\r\nSix Historic Americans: \"The Church claims all great men. But the truth\r\nis, the great men of all nations have, for the most part, rejected\r\nChristianity. Of these six historic Americans--the six greatest men that\r\nhave lived on this continent [Paine, Washington, Franklin, Jefferson,\r\nLincoln and Grant]--not one was a Christian. All were unbelievers.\r\n\r\n\"It is popularly supposed that Paine was a very irreligious man, while\r\nWashington, Franklin, Jefferson, Lincoln and Grant were very religious.\r\nThe reverse of this is more nearly true. Paine, although not a\r\nChristian, was a deeply religious man; while the others, though\r\npracticing the loftiest morals, cared little for religion.\"\r\n\r\n(\"Six Historic Americans\" contains more than five hundred pages of\r\nevidence in support of the fact that these six eminent men were all\r\ndisbelievers in orthodox Christianity, including the testimony of one\r\nhundred witnesses, mostly friends and acquaintences, in proof of\r\nLincoln's unbelief.)\r\n\r\n\"The 'Age of Reason' can now be estimated calmly. It was written from\r\nthe viewpoint of a Quaker who did not believe in revealed religion, but\r\nwho held that 'all religions are in their nature mild and benign' when\r\nnot associated with political systems.\"--_Encyclopedia Britannica._\r\n\r\n\"All national institutions of churches--whether Jewish, Christian or\r\nTurkish--appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify\r\nand enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit.\"--_Age of Reason._\r\n\r\n\"Each of those churches show certain books which they call revelation,\r\nor the word of God. The Jews say that their word of God was given by God\r\nto Moses face to face; the Christians say that their word of God came by\r\ndivine inspiration; and the Turks say that their word of God (the Koran)\r\nwas brought by an angel from heaven. Each of those churches accuses\r\nthe others of unbelief; and, for my own part, I disbelieve them\r\nall.\"--_Ibid._\r\n\r\nPaine's reason for rejecting the Bible is as logical as it is apparent.\r\nA plurality of so-called divine revelations cannot be harmonized with\r\nthe attributes ascribed to. Deity. There are many Bibles. The world is\r\ndivided into various religious systems. The adherents of each system\r\nhave their sacred book, or Bible. Brahmins have the Vedas and Puranas,\r\nBuddhists the Tripitaka, Zoroastrians the Zend Avesta, Confucians the\r\nKing, Mohammedans the Koran, and Christians the Holy Bible. The\r\nadherents of each claim that their book is a revelation from\r\nGod--that the others are spurious. Now, if the Christian Bible were\r\na revelation--if it were God's only revelation, as affirmed--would he\r\nallow these spurious books to be imposed upon mankind and delude the\r\ngreater portion of his children?\r\n\r\nA divine revelation intended for all mankind can be harmonized only with\r\na universal acceptance of this revelation. God, it is affirmed, has made\r\na revelation to the world. Those who receive and accept this revelation\r\nare saved; those who fail to receive and accept it are lost. This God,\r\nit is claimed, is all-powerful and all-just. If he is all-powerful he\r\ncan give his children a revelation. If he is all-just he will give this\r\nrevelation to all. He will not give it to a part of them and allow them\r\nto be saved and withhold it from the others and suffer them to be lost.\r\nYour house is on fire. Your children are asleep in their rooms. What\r\nis your duty? To arouse them and rescue them--to awaken all of them and\r\nsave all of them. If you awaken and save only a part of them when it is\r\nin your power to save them all, you are a fiend. If you stand outside\r\nand blow a trumpet and say, \"I have warned them, I have done my duty,\",\r\nand they perish, you are still a fiend. If God does not give his\r\nrevelation to all; if he does not disclose his divinity to all; in\r\nshort, if he does not save all, he is the prince of fiends.\r\n\r\nIf all the world's inhabitants but one accepted the Bible and there was\r\none who could not honestly accept it, its rejection by one human being\r\nwould prove that it is not from an all-powerful and an all-just God;\r\nfor an all-powerful God who failed to reach and convince even one of his\r\nchildren would not be an all-just God. Has the Bible been given to all\r\nthe world? Do all accept it? Three-fourths of the human race reject it;\r\nmillions have never heard of it.\r\n\r\n\"The word of God is the creation we behold.\"--_Age of Reason_.\r\n\r\n\"It is only in the creation that all our ideas and conceptions of a\r\nword of God can unite. The creation speaketh a universal language,\r\nindependently of human speech or human languages, multiplied and various\r\nas they be. It is an ever-existing original which every man can read.\r\nIt cannot be forged; it cannot be counterfeited; it cannot be lost; it\r\ncannot be altered; it cannot be suppressed. It does not depend upon the\r\nwill of man whether it shall be published or not; it publishes itself\r\nfrom one end of the earth to the other. It preaches to all nations and\r\nto all worlds; and this word of God reveals to man all that is necessary\r\nfor man to know of God.\r\n\r\n\"Do we want to contemplate his power? We see it in the immensity of\r\nthe Creation. Do we want to contemplate his wisdom? We see it in the\r\nunchangeable order by which the incomprehensible Whole is governed. Do\r\nwe want to contemplate his munificence? We see it in the abundance with\r\nwhich he fills the earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We see it\r\nin his not withholding that abundance even from the unthankful. In\r\nfine, do we want to know what God is? Search not the book called the\r\nScripture, which any human hand might make, but the scripture called the\r\nCreation.\"--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\"The moral duty of man consists in imitating the moral goodness and\r\nbeneficence of God manifested in the creation towards all his creatures.\r\nThat seeing as we daily do the goodness of God to all men, it is an\r\nexample calling upon all men to practice the same towards each other;\r\nand, consequently, that everything of persecution and revenge between\r\nman and man, and everything of cruelty to animals, is a violation of\r\nmoral duty.\"--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\"I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy\r\nand endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\"--Ibid.\r\n\r\n\"Any system of religion that has anything in it that shocks the mind of\r\na child cannot be a true system.\"--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\"I trouble not myself about the manner of future existence. I content\r\nmyself with believing, even to positive conviction, that the power that\r\ngave me existence is able to continue it, in any form and manner he\r\npleases, either with or without this body.\"--_Ibid_.\r\n\r\nIt has been charged that Paine reviled Jesus in his book. He eulogized\r\nJesus. ''Three noble and pathetic tributes to the Man of Nazareth\r\nare audible from the last century--those of Rousseau, Voltaire and\r\nPaine.\"--_Dr. Conway_.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing that is here said can apply, even with the most distant\r\ndisrespect, to the real character of Jesus Christ. He was a virtuous and\r\namiable man. The morality that he preached was of the most benevolent\r\nkind; and though similar Systems of morality had been preached by\r\nConfucius, and by some of the Greek philosophers, many years before;\r\nby the Quakers since, and by many good men in all ages, it has not been\r\nexceeded by any.... But he preached also against the Jewish priests;\r\nand this brought upon him the hatred and vengeance of the whole order of\r\npriesthood.\"--_Age of Reason_.\r\n\r\nHistory repeats itself. What is alleged to have been the fate of Jesus\r\nwas, in a measure, the fate of Thomas Paine. The penning of his honest\r\nthoughts on religion caused his good name to be consigned to everlasting\r\ninfamy on earth and his soul doomed to endless misery in hell. The Jews\r\nwho are said to have demanded the crucifixion of Jesus on Calvary\r\nand the Catholics who burned Bruno at Rome are not more deserving of\r\nexecration than are the Protestant assassins of Paine's character in\r\nEngland and America.\r\n\r\nReferring to Paine's examination and analysis of the Bible and his\r\ncriticisms of the church presented in the \"Age of Reason,\" William\r\nThurston Brown, in a lecture, said: \"He brought to that, examination and\r\nanalysis what almost no other mind in all the ages has brought: a mind\r\nabsolutely free, a soul absolutely incorruptible, a character unstained\r\nby one act of compromise or treachery to friend or foe, a nature\r\ndevoted, as few natures in all history have been, to the truth, and,\r\nmore than all, a sense of the relation of moral and intellectual\r\nintegrity to personal character and social well-being never surpassed\r\nand seldom equaled.\"\r\n\r\nS.

Very little I fancy. But does this mean, or would it mean,\r\nthat Paine had become converted to Christianity? Not a bit of it. It\r\nwould only mean that Christianity had become converted to Paine.

And all because every human being had been taught from his\r\ncradle that there is something more sacred than humanity, and to which\r\nman should be sacrificed. Of all those massacred thinkers not one voice\r\nremains: they have gone silent: over their reeking guillotine sits\r\nthe gloating Apollyon of Inhumanity. But here is one man, a prisoner,\r\npreparing for his long silence. He alone can speak for those slain\r\nbetween the throne and the altar. In these outbursts of laughter and\r\ntears, these outcries that think not of literary style, these appeals\r\nfrom surrounding chaos to the starry realm of order, from the tribune of\r\nvengeance to the sun shining for all, this passionate horror of cruelty\r\nin the powerful which will brave a heartless heaven or hell with its\r\nimmortal indignation,--in all these the unfettered mind may hear the\r\nwail of enthralled Europe, sinking back choked with its blood, under the\r\nchain it tried to break.

Mr. Woodsworth assures us that he neither\r\nheard nor saw anything to justify the belief of any mental change in the\r\nopinions of Mr. Paine previous to his death.\"\r\n\r\nThe English writer, William Cobbett, a believer in Christianity, who\r\nlived for a time in this country, and who made a thorough investigation\r\nof the Paine calumnies, says: \"Among other things said against this\r\nfamous man is that he recanted before he died; and that in his last\r\nillness he discovered horrible fears of death.... It is a pure,\r\nunadulterated falsehood.\"\r\n\r\nCobbett, in 1819, announced his intention of publishing a biography of\r\nPaine. Soon after a pious fanatic of New York, named Collins, attempted\r\nto persuade him that Paine had recanted and begged him to state the\r\nfact in his book. He had induced a disreputable woman, Mary Hinsdale, an\r\nopium fiend, notorious for her lying propensities, to promise that she\r\nwould tell Cobbett that she had visited Paine during his illness and\r\nthat he had confessed to her his disbelief in the \"Age of Reason\" and\r\nexpressed regret for having published it. Cobbett saw at once that the\r\nwhole thing was a fraud. Collins, he says, \"had a sodden face, a simper,\r\nand maneuvered his features precisely like the most perfidious wretch\r\nthat I have known.\" However, he called on the woman. But her courage had\r\nforsaken her. Concerning the result of his visit he says: \"She shuffled;\r\nshe evaded; she equivocated; she warded off; she affected not to\r\nunderstand me.\" It was afterward proven that she had not conversed\r\nwith Paine; that she had never seen him. But it did not need Cobbett's\r\npublication of the lie to secure its acceptance by the church. The\r\noccupant of nearly every orthodox pulpit was only too willing to publish\r\nit. This was the origin of the recantation calumny.\r\n\r\n\"Had Thomas Paine recanted, every citizen of New York would have heard\r\nof it within twenty-four hours. The news of it would have spread to the\r\nremotest confines of America and Europe as rapidly as the human agencies\r\nof that time could have transmitted it.

When the inevitable hour comes;\r\nwhen the lights are being put out, the shutters closed, the end is\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning Paine's recanting Colonel Ingersoll says: \"He died surrounded\r\nby those who hated and despised him,--who endeavored to wring from the\r\nlips of death a recantation. But, dying as he was, his soul stood erect\r\nto the last moment. Nothing like a recantation could be wrung from the\r\nbrave lips of Thomas Paine.\"\r\n\r\nCol.

That he had much to do with\r\nits composition, however, can scarcely be doubted. The circumstances\r\nattending its adoption warrant the assumption, and the style of the\r\ndocument confirms it. Knowing the marvelous power of Paine's pen,\r\nknowing that with it he had led the people to demand independence, to\r\nsuppose that he would not be consulted, that his services would not\r\nbe solicited in regard to its preparation is incredible. Had he been a\r\nmember of the Continental Congress he certainly would have been selected\r\nto draft the document. He was the soul of the movement and its literary\r\nleader. The historian Gaspey says: \"The Government took no steps of\r\nimportance without consulting him.\" The fact that his name was not\r\nmentioned in connection with its authorship at the time argues nothing.\r\nHad he written every word of it neither he nor the Committee could with\r\npropriety have divulged its authorship. The authorship of state papers\r\nand other public documents is assumed by, and credited to, the officials\r\nissuing them and not to the persons who may have been employed to draft\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"There is much evidence, both internal and external, in the Declaration,\r\nthat some other person than Jefferson was the writer. There is much\r\nevidence, internal and external, that the author was Thomas Paine.\"--_W.\r\nM. van der Weyde_.\r\n\r\nA noted writer, Albert Payson Terhune, presents the following as\r\nthe principal arguments that have been adduced in support of Paine's\r\nauthorship of the Declaration of Independence:\r\n\r\n\"The Declaration's first draft contained the phrase: 'Scotch and foreign\r\nmercenaries.' Jefferson was fond of the Scotch, and had two Scotch\r\ntutors; whereas Paine openly hated Scotland and its people.\r\n\r\n\"The first draft contained the word 'hath' This word is said to be found\r\nnowhere else in Jefferson's writings, while it abounds in Paine's.\r\n\r\n\"There was also in this draft a sharp rebuke to the British king for his\r\nintroducing slavery into his provinces. Jefferson was a slave-holder;\r\nPaine hated slavery.\r\n\r\n\"That Jefferson, an owner of slaves, should have declared 'all men to be\r\nequal' and 'entitled to liberty,' has always seemed inconsistent.\r\n\r\n\"Though unjust taxation was one of the Revolution's chief causes,\r\nit receives very slight mention in the Declaration. Jefferson was\r\nsupposedly a foe to such taxation. Paine considered the taxation problem\r\nmerely as a side issue.\r\n\r\n\"Paine's notions concerning government as set forth in his 'Common\r\nSense' are largely embodied in the Declaration.\r\n\r\n\"Jefferson's style of writing was easy and graceful. Paine's was\r\nforceful, terse, pointed. The Declaration is couched far more in the\r\nlatter style than in the former.\r\n\r\n\"Phrases and words dear to Paine are scattered broadcast through the\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\n\"The expression 'Nature and Nature's God' fit in with Paine's favorite\r\ntheory that God was to be found in Nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost a century ago an American newspaper claimed to have proof that\r\nJefferson did not write the Declaration, and strongly hinted that Paine\r\nwrote it.\r\n\r\n\"Jefferson, it is said, never formally claimed the authorship until\r\nafter Paine's death, and was always reticent on the subject.\"\r\n\r\nWalton Williams: \"Ever since the Revolution there has been a tradition\r\nin certain parts of the country that the real author of the Declaration\r\nof Independence was Thomas Paine. The storm of opprobrium that beat upon\r\nPaine's name because af his religious writings almost eradicated this\r\ntradition.\"\r\n\r\nJefferson lived fifty years after the Declaration appeared. During\r\nall this time--and his silence is significant--he never claimed the\r\nauthorship of the document except in the epitaph which he is said to\r\nhave prepared for his tombstone. He was its accredited author and in an\r\nofficial sense was its author, and in this sense the claim made in his\r\nepitaph is admissible.\r\n\r\nNearly seventy years ago George M.

Two hundred and fifty gun-boats were speedily built for the\r\npurpose. Then Napoleon abandoned the expedition against England for the\r\none against Egypt.\r\n\r\nPaine's approval of this proposed invasion of England was not inspired\r\nby a spirit of revenge because of his persecution by the English\r\nGovernment, but by a sincere love of its people, seeing in it the only\r\nmeans of delivering them from the intolerable tyranny of George III. and\r\nhis Ministry. Napoleon at this time had not manifested that insatiable\r\nthirst for blood which at a later period made him the scourge of Europe.\r\n\r\nJames A. Edgerton, A. M.: \"Thomas Paine first suggested American\r\nIndependence. He first suggested the Federal Union of the States. He\r\nfirst proposed the abolition of negro slavery. He first suggested [in\r\nChristendom] protection for dumb animals. He first suggested equal\r\nrights for women. He first proposed old age pensions. He first suggested\r\nthe education of poor children at public expense. He first proposed\r\narbitration and international peace. He suggested a great republic of\r\nall the nations of the world.\"\r\n\r\nTo the claims made in behalf of Paine by Mr. Edgerton and others the\r\nfollowing may be added: He was one of the founders, if not the real\r\nfounder, of modern journalism. He labored to provide better facilities\r\nfor the education of young women. His contributions to hygienic science\r\nwere invaluable. His knowledge of astronomy was profound; he affirmed\r\nthe belief that the fixed stars were suns twenty years before Herschel.\r\nHis views regarding taxation were wise and just. He was an advocate of\r\nland reform. He was recognized as the ablest authority of his time\r\non paper money. He was one of the framers of the Constitution of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nNot only was Paine the real founder of our Republic; he was largely\r\ninstrumental in securing for it the greatest of its subsequent\r\nacquisitions of territory. He shares with Jefferson the honor of being\r\nthe first to propose the purchase from Napoleon of the province of\r\nLouisiana, an empire in extent--reaching from Florida to the Pacific and\r\nto what is now British Columbia, a distance of three thousand miles--a\r\nterritory three times as large as the original United States of America\r\nand from which have been formed, wholly or in part, eighteen of the most\r\nimportant states in the Union.\r\n\r\nNearly half a century before Comte, Paine taught the Religion of\r\nHumanity.\r\n\r\n\"In 1778 he wrote his sublime sentence about the 'Religion of\r\nHumanity.'\"--_Dr. Conway_.\r\n\r\n\"I have discovered that Paine not only wrote those words, 'the Religion\r\nof Humanity,'... but he was the real author by this discovery of all\r\nlaws of social science which is called sociology, now the queen of the\r\nsciences....

Livingston (to Paine in Paris): \"Make your will; leave the\r\nmechanics, the iron bridge, the wheels, etc., to America.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph N. Moreau: \"The Archimedes of the eighteenth century.\"\r\n\r\nElihu Palmer: \"Probably the most useful man that ever lived.\"\r\n\r\nRefutation of Charges of Immorality.\r\n\r\nLouis Masquerier:\r\n\r\n    \"Paine who wrote in man's defense,\r\n    'Rights of Man' and 'Common Sense,\r\n    Let not pious virulence\r\n    Stain his honest fame.\"\r\n\r\nPaine has been represented by his religious enemies as the embodiment\r\nof all that is bad. He was, they assert, drunken, filthy, and immoral.\r\nBanished from respectable society, he associated, they say, only with\r\nthe low and vile. The following testimony covers all the years that\r\nelapsed from the beginning of his public career to the end of his life.\r\n\r\nDr. Franklin, writing from England while Paine was yet a resident of\r\nthat country, says: \"Mr. Thomas Paine is very well recommended to me as\r\nan ingenious worthy young man.\"\r\n\r\nThat his previous life had been above serious reproach is shown by a\r\nletter to the Excise Office in which he says: \"No complaint of the least\r\ndishonesty or intemperance has ever appeared against me.\"\r\n\r\nJames B. Elliot: \"Paine's pamphlet ['Case of the Officers of Excise']\r\nsecured for him the acquaintance of Oliver Goldsmith, who became and\r\nremained his friend until his death, and by whom he was introduced to\r\nBenjamin Franklin.\"\r\n\r\n\"At a coffeehouse in London Paine met that other great thinker,\r\nFranklin. They became fast friends.\"--_Elbert Hubbard_.\r\n\r\n\"Invited by Franklin he went to America.\"--_Encyclopedia of Social\r\nReform_.\r\n\r\n\"His associates in Philadelphia were people of the highest\r\nrespectability and importance.... He was welcomed everywhere.\"--_James\r\nB. Elliott_.\r\n\r\nReferring to his first year in America Bancroft says: \"In that time he\r\nhad frequented the society of Rittenhouse, Clymer and Samuel Adams.\" Dr.\r\nRush says: \"He visited in the families of Dr. Franklin, Mr. Rittenhouse\r\nand Mr. George Clymer.\" Referring to the members of the Philosophical\r\nSociety, founded by Franklin, Dr. Conway says: \"Paine was welcomed\r\ninto their circle by Rittenhouse, Clymer, Rush, Muhlenberg, and other\r\nrepresentatives of the scientific and literary metropolis.\"\r\n\r\nWriting in his journal at a later period John Hall, the English\r\nmechanician who then resided in Philadelphia, mentions among Paine's\r\nvisitors and intimate associates Franklin, Gouverneur Morris, Dr. Rush,\r\nTench Francis, Robert Morris, Rittenhouse, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Library of the World's Best Literature alludes to scientific\r\nexperiments made by Paine \"for the entertainment of Washington whose\r\nguest he was for some time.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis Marion Lemmon: \"When my father [a son of one of Washington's\r\nofficers] was about twelve years of age he was employed by George\r\nWashington to carry messages from his military camp to that of his\r\nfather and other military posts, and for about four years lived as one\r\nof the family of Washington. It was my father's privilege during his\r\nservice with Washington to meet and become acquainted with a number\r\nof the most popular and influential men of that time--such as Thomas\r\nJefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Paine, General\r\nLafayette and General Francis Marion.... My father told me, when I was\r\na boy, of the visits these men paid to Uncle George and Aunt Martha\r\nWashington, as he always called them, and he told me that Aunt Martha\r\nalways called Paine 'Brother Tom' and always looked forward when a visit\r\nof Brother Tom was expected.\"\r\n\r\nAlluding to Paine's conduct and public services during the Revolution,\r\nDr. Conway says:\r\n\r\n\"They are best measured in the value set on them by the great leaders\r\nmost cognizant of them,--by Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Adams,\r\nMadison, Robert Morris, Chancellor Livingston, R. H. Lee, Colonel\r\nLaurens, General Greene, Dickinson. Had there been anything dishonorable\r\nor mercenary in Paine's career, these are the men who would have known\r\nit; but their letters are searched in vain for even the faintest hint of\r\nanything disparaging to his patriotic self-devotion during those eight\r\nweary years.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Adams: \"Thomas Paine, down to the time of his departure for\r\nEurope, in 1787, was a fashionable member of society [in New York],\r\nadmired and courted as the greatest literary genius of his day.\"\r\n\r\nThe oldest and one of the most powerful political organizations in\r\nthis country, outside of the regular political parties, is the Tammany\r\nSociety of New York. Whatever shortcomings may be justly charged to this\r\nsociety in later times it was in its earlier days, when devoted mainly\r\nto social and benevolent purposes, one of the most honorable and\r\nrespectable of societies. Paine was the hero of this society.\r\n\r\nDr. Conway says: \"At the great celebration (October 12, 1792) of the\r\nThird Centenary of the discovery of America, by the sons of St. Tammany,\r\nNew York, the first man toasted after Columbus was Paine, and next to\r\nPaine 'The Rights of Man,' They were also extolled in an ode composed for\r\nthe occasion, and sung.\" Paine was at this time a resident of France.\r\n\r\n\"Visited France in the summer of 1787, where he made the acquaintance\r\nof Buffon, Malesherbes, La Rochefoucauld, and other eminent\r\nmen.\"--_Chambers' Encyclopedia_.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Robinet, the French historian, says on this visit (1787) Paine,\r\nwho had long known the 'soul of the people,' came into' relation with\r\neminent men of all groups, philosophical and political--Condorcet,\r\nAchille Duchatelet, Cardinal De Brienne, and, he believes also Danton,\r\nwho like the English republican [Paine] was a Freemason.\"--_Dr. Conway_.\r\n\r\nGilbert Patten Brown (in Masonic Monthly, July, 1916): \"In the St.\r\nJohn's Regimental Lodge (the first Masonic body to be constituted among\r\nthe troops) Thomas Paine (like Capt. James Monroe, Capt. John Marshall\r\nand many other of minor mention) was entered, crafted and raised a\r\nMaster Mason.\"\r\n\r\nFranklin, who in 1774 introduced Paine to the New World as \"an ingenious\r\nworthy young man\" in 1787, after an acquaintance of thirteen years,\r\nreaffirms his former estimate of the man. In a letter of introduction to\r\nthe Duke of Rochefoucauld he says: \"The bearer of this is Mr. Paine, the\r\nauthor of a famous piece entitled 'Common Sense,' published with great\r\neffect on the minds of the people at the beginning of the Revolution. He\r\nis an ingenious, honest man; and as such I beg leave to recommend him to\r\nyour civilities.\"\r\n\r\nLamb's Biographical Dictionary: \"Visiting London, he at once became a\r\nsocial and diplomatic feature of that metropolis.\"\r\n\r\nThomas \"Clio\" Rickman: \"Mr. Paine's life in London was a quiet round\r\nof philosophical leisure and enjoyment.... Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the\r\nFrench and American embassadors, Mr. Sharp, the engraver, Romney, the\r\npainter, Mrs. Wollstonecraft, Joel Barlow,... Dr. Priestley,...\r\nMr. Horne Tooke, etc., were among the number of his friends and\r\nacquaintances.\"\r\n\r\n\"His manners were easy and gracious; his knowledge was universal and\r\nboundless; in private company and among his friends his conversation had\r\nevery fascination that anecdote, novelty and truth could give it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Paine in his person was about five feet ten inches high, and\r\nrather athletic.... His eye, of which the painter could not convey the\r\nexquisite meaning, was full, brilliant and singularly piercing.\"\r\n\r\nAlexander Wilson: \"The penetration and intelligence of his eye bespeak\r\nthe man of genius.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Adams, in a letter to his wife, refers to Paine as \"a man who,\r\nGeneral Lee says, has genius in his eyes.\" Carlyle describes him as \"the\r\nman with the black beaming eyes.\" Walter Morton, who was with him when\r\nhe died, says, \"His eye glistened with genius under the pangs of death.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Thomas Cooper: \"I have dined with Mr. Paine in literary society,\r\nin London, at least a dozen times, when his dress, manners, and\r\nconversation were such as became the character of an unobtrusive\r\nintelligent gentleman, accustomed to good society.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding Paine's associations in England his biographer, Dr. Conway,\r\nsays: \"There [Rotherham] and in London he was 'lionized' as Franklin had\r\nbeen in Paris. We find him now passing a week with Edmund Burke, now at\r\nthe country seat of the Duke of Portland, or enjoying the hospitalities\r\nof Lord Fitzwilliam at Wentworth House. He is entertained and consulted\r\non public affairs by Fox, Lord Landsdowne, Sir George Staunton, Sir\r\nJoseph Banks.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Americans in London--the artists West and Trumbull, the Alexanders\r\n(Franklin's connections), and others were fond of him as a friend and\r\nproud of him as a countryman.\"--_Ibid_.\r\n\r\n\"His personal acquaintance,\" says Dr. Conway, \"included nearly every\r\ngreat or famous man of his time, in England, America, France.\"\r\n\r\nPaine not only enjoyed the friendship and esteem of the notables of the\r\nworld, he was the idol of the common people who knew him. Before the\r\nRevolution in France began he spent two years in England, engaged a part\r\nof the time perfecting his iron bridge. The leading manufacturing firm\r\nof Rotherham encouraged him and fitted up a shop for him to work in.\r\nNearly a half century later Professor Lesley of Philadelphia, then a\r\nyoung man, visited Rotherham. Notwithstanding the long time that had\r\nelapsed he found Paine's memory still green and one of the cherished\r\npossessions of Yorkshire. The results of his visit are thus related by\r\nDr. Conway:\r\n\r\n\"Professor Lesley of Philadelphia tells me that when visiting in early\r\nlife the works at Rotherham, Paine's workshop and the very tools he used\r\nwere pointed out. They were preserved with care. He conversed with\r\nan aged and intelligent workman who had worked under Paine as a lad.\r\nProfessor Lesley, who had shared some of the prejudice against Paine,\r\nwas impressed by the earnest words of the old man. Mr. Paine he said was\r\nthe most honest man, and the best man he ever knew. After he had been\r\nthere a little time everybody looked up to him, the Walkers and their\r\nworkmen. He knew the people for miles round, and went into their homes;\r\nhis benevolence, his friendliness, his knowledge, made him beloved by\r\nall, rich and poor. His memory had always lasted there.\"\r\n\r\nM. and Madame de Bonneville: \"Not a day [in Paris] escaped without his\r\nreceiving many visits. Mr. Barlow, Mr. [Robert] Fulton, Mr. [Sir Robert]\r\nSmith, came very often to see him. Many travelers also called on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paine was, indeed, so overrun with visitors and adventurers that he\r\nappropriated two mornings of each week at the Philadelphia House for\r\nlevees. These, however, became insufficient to stem the constant stream\r\nof visitors, including spies and lion-hunters, so that he had little\r\ntime for consultation with the men and women whose cooperation he needed\r\nin public affairs. He therefore leased an out-of-the-way house [the\r\nold Madame Pompadour mansion], reserving knowledge of it for particular\r\nfriends, while still retaining his address at the Philadelphia House,\r\nwhere the levees were continued.\"--_Dr. Conway_.\r\n\r\n\"Here [at Paine's house] gathered sympathetic spirits from America,\r\nEngland, France, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, freed from prejudices of\r\nrace, rank, or nationality.\"--_Ibid_.\r\n\r\n\"And now the old hotel became the republican capitol of Europe. There\r\nsat an international Premier with his Cabinet.\"--_Ibid_.\r\n\r\n\"A grand dinner was given by Paine at the Hotel de Ville to Dumouriez,\r\nwhere this brilliant general met Brissot, Condorcet, Santerre, and\r\nseveral eminent English radicals.\"--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\"In the beautiful courtyard of the Palais Royal, I saw today for the\r\nfirst time the statue of Camille Desmoulins, one of the most heroic\r\nfigures of the French Revolution.... He was one of Paine's warmest\r\nfriends in Paris. Desmoulins had known Paine when the latter was a\r\nmember of the Convention and doubtless was one of the interesting\r\ncoterie that met at Paine's house in the Faubourg St. Denis.\"--_William\r\nM. van der Weyde_.\r\n\r\n\"When Bonaparte returned from Italy he called on Paine and invited him\r\nto dinner.\"--_Clio Rickman_.\r\n\r\n\"Among the persons I was in the habit of receiving Paine deserves to be\r\nmentioned.\"--_Madame Roland._\r\n\r\nAmong Paine's most intimate French friends, besides the Bonnevilles with\r\nwhom he lived for several years, were the Rolands, the Brissots, the\r\nCondorcets, and the Lafayettes, France's purest and noblest souls.\r\n\r\nBaron Pichon: \"Paine lived in Monroe's house at Paris.\"\r\n\r\nWhile James Monroe was minister to France Paine was for a year and\r\na half a member of his household, enjoying in the highest degree the\r\nesteem of both Mr. and Mrs. Monroe.\r\n\r\nPaine was one of the most amiable of men and possessed a most charming\r\npersonality. Nicolas and Margaret Bonneville, with whom he resided in\r\nParis, in a biographical sketch of him, written after his death and\r\nrevised by Cobbett, bear this testimony: \"Thomas Paine loved his friends\r\nwith sincere and tender affection. His simplicity of heart and that\r\nhappy kind of openness, or rather, carelessness, which charms our\r\nhearts in reading the fables of the good Lafontaine, made him extremely\r\namiable. If little children were near him he patted them, searched his\r\npockets for the store of cakes, biscuits, sugar-plums, pieces of sugar,\r\nof which he used to take possession as of a treasure belonging to them,\r\nand the distribution of which belonged to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was always gentle to children and to animals.\"--_Ellery Sedgwick_.\r\n\r\nThe deep affection entertained for Paine by his Parisian friends was\r\nshown when, grievously ill and believed to be dying, he was carried from\r\nhis cot in the Luxembourg to the home of the Monroes. I quote again from\r\nDr. Conway: \"Paine had been restored by the tenderness and devotion of\r\nfriends. Had it not been for friendship he could hardly have been saved.\r\nWe are little able, in the present day, to appreciate the reverence and\r\naffection with which Thomas Paine was regarded by those who saw in him\r\nthe greatest apostle of liberty in the world.... In Paris there\r\nwere ladies and gentlemen who had known something of the cost of\r\nliberty--Col. and Mrs. Monroe, Sir Robert and Lady Smith, Madame\r\nLafayette, Mr. and Mrs. Barlow, M. and Madame de Bonneville. They\r\nhad known what it was to watch through anxious nights with terrors\r\nsurrounding them. He who % had suffered most was to them a sacred\r\nperson. He had come out of the succession of ordeals, so weak in body,\r\nso wounded by American ingratitude, so sore at heart, that no delicate\r\nchild needed more tender care.... Men say their Arthur is dead, but\r\ntheir love is stronger than death. And though the service of these\r\nfriends might at first have been reverential, it ended with attachment,\r\nso great was Paine's power, so wonderful and pathetic his memories, so\r\ncharming the play of his wit, so full his response to kindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Luxembourg prison,\" says Conway, \"he won all hearts.\"\r\n\r\nAugustus C. Buel: \"Jones [John Paul] liked Tom Paine and Paine\r\nalmost worshiped Jones [they were in Paris]. All through the American\r\nRevolution they had been fast friends, familiarly calling each other\r\n'Tom' and 'Paul.'\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Mazzini Wheeler: \"Landor [Walter Savage] told my friend Mr. Birch\r\nof Florence that he particularly admired Paine, and that he visited him,\r\nhaving first obtained an interview at the house of General Dumouriez\r\n[the most famous general of the Revolution]. Landor declared that Paine\r\nwas always called 'Tom,' not out of disrespect, but because he was a\r\njolly good fellow.\"\r\n\r\nLord Edward Fitzgerald (to his mother): \"I lodge with my friend Paine\r\n[in Paris]; we breakfast, dine, and sup together. The more I see of his\r\ninterior the more I like and respect him. I cannot express how kind he\r\nis to me. There is a simplicity of manner, a goodness of heart, and a\r\nstrength of mind in him that I never knew a man before to possess.\"\r\n\r\nLady Lucy Fitzgerald: \"Although he [Lord Edward] was unsuccessful in the\r\nglorious attempt of liberating his country [Ireland] from slavery, still\r\nhe was not unmindful of the lessons you taught him. Accept, then, his\r\npicture from his unhappy sister. Its place is in your house; my heart\r\nwill be satisfied with such a Pantheon: it knows no consolation but the\r\napprobation of such men as you, and the soothing recollection that he\r\ndid his duty and died faithful to the cause of liberty.\"\r\n\r\nZachariah Wilkes: \"Let me tell you what he did for me. I was arrested in\r\nParis and condemned to die. I had no friend here; and it was at a time\r\nwhen no friend would have served me: Robespierre ruled. 'I am innocent!'\r\nI cried in desperation. 'I am innocent, so help me God! I am condemned\r\nfor the offense of another.' I wrote a statement of my case with\r\na pencil; thinking at first of addressing it to my judge, then of\r\ndirecting it to the president of the Convention.\"\r\n\r\n[Wilkes, who was an Englishman, had important business to transact which\r\ninvolved his honor and he could not bear the thought of dying with it\r\nunperformed. The jailer referred him to Paine, who, though a prisoner,\r\nhad much influence with the authorities.]\r\n\r\n\"He [Paine] examined me closer than my judge had done; he required my\r\nproofs. After a long time I satisfied him. He then said: 'The leaders of\r\nthe Convention would rather have my life than yours. If by any means\r\nI can obtain your release on my own security, will you promise me to\r\nreturn in twenty days?'\"\r\n\r\nWilkes promised to return. Paine then obtained permission for him to\r\nleave the prison, guaranteeing his return and agreeing to take his\r\nplace at the guillotine if he failed to do so. Wilkes kept his word. He\r\nreturned to the prison, drawing from Paine the exclamation, \"There is\r\nyet English blood in England!\" Wilkes had been opposed to Paine both in\r\npolitics and religion.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of Paine's noble magnanimity is related by Dr. Conway:\r\n\"This personage [Captain Grimstone, R. A.], during a dinner party at the\r\nPalais Egalité, got into a controversy with Paine, and, forgetting that\r\nthe English Jove could not in Paris answer argument with thunder, called\r\nPaine a traitor to his country and struck him a violent blow. Death was\r\nthe penalty for striking a deputy and Paine's friends were not unwilling\r\nto see the penalty inflicted on this stout young captain who had struck\r\na man of fifty-six. Paine had much trouble in obtaining from Barrere,\r\nof the Committee of Public Safety, a passport out of the country for\r\nCaptain Grimstone, whose traveling expenses were supplied by the man he\r\nhad struck.\"\r\n\r\nLady Smith: \"If the usual style of gallantry was as clever as your 'New\r\nCovenant' [a beautiful poem by Paine addressed to Lady Smith] many a\r\nfair lady's heart would be in danger; but the Little Corner of the\r\nWorld [Lady Smith] receives it from the Castle in the Air [Paine]; it is\r\nagreeable to her as being the elegant fancy of a friend.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert and Lady Smith were Paine's most devoted English friends in\r\nParis. When Paine was languishing in prison Lady Smith wrote him letters\r\nof cheer and comfort, signing herself \"Little Corner of the World.\"\r\n\r\nFrederick Freeman: \"He [Captain Rowland Crocker] had taken the great\r\nNapoleon by the hand; he had familiarly known Paine.... He remembered\r\nPaine as a well-dressed and most gentlemanly man, of sound and orthodox\r\nrepublican principles, of a good heart, a strong intellect, and a\r\nfascinating address.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the many calumnies circulated against Paine is the charge that\r\nduring his later years, after he wrote the \"Age of Reason,\" he was, both\r\nin France and in America, a drunkard. This charge is false. Paine\r\nwas one of the most temperate men of his time. Concerning his use of\r\nintoxicants in France his old friend Clio Rickman, who visited him\r\nin Paris, who was with him during his last day in that city, and who\r\naccompanied him to Havre when he sailed for America, says: \"He did not\r\ndrink spirits, and wine he took moderately; he even objected to any\r\nspirits being laid in as a part of his sea-stock.\"\r\n\r\nHon. E. B. Washburne, who made a thorough investigation of Paine's\r\ncareer in France, bears the following testimony: \"A somewhat extended\r\nstudy of the French Revolution during the extraordinary period in which\r\nPaine was so intimately connected with it, fails to show anything to the\r\nprejudice of his personal or political character.\"\r\n\r\n\"Returned to the United States on the invitation of Jefferson in\r\n1802.\"--_Library of World's Best Literature_.\r\n\r\nCharles T. Sprading: \"Jefferson offered him return passage from Europe\r\non a United States man-of-war.\"\r\n\r\nNational Intelligencer (Washington, Nov. 10, 1802): \"Thomas Paine has\r\narrived in this city and has received a cordial reception from the Whigs\r\nof Seventy-six and the Republicans of 1800.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was cordially received by the President, Thomas Jefferson. He also\r\nvisited the heads of the departments.\"--_Boston Post_.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia Aurora, Washington Correspondent of (November 26, 1802):\r\n\"His address is unaffected and unceremonious. He neither shuns nor\r\ncourts observation. At table he enjoys what is good with the appetite\r\nof temperance and vigor, and puts to shame his calumniators by the\r\nmoderation with which he partakes of the common beverage of the\r\nboarders.... I am proud to find a man whose political writings upon the\r\nwhole have never been equaled, and whom I have admired on that account,\r\nfree from the contamination of debauchery and habits of inebriety which\r\nhave been so grossly and falsely sent abroad concerning him.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Samuel Latham Mitchell, M. C. (Washington, Dec. 11, 1802): \"At Mr.\r\nGallatin's I saw for the first time the celebrated Thomas Paine. We had\r\nsome conversation before dinner and we sat side by side at the table....\r\nThis extraordinary man contributed exceedingly much to entertain the\r\ncompany.\"\r\n\r\nAlbert Gallatin was at this time Secretary of the Treasury. Referring to\r\nthis period, including all the remaining years of his life, Conway\r\nsays: \"Paine's defamers have manifested an eagerness to ascribe his\r\nmaltreatment to personal faults. This is not the case.... He was neat\r\nin his attire. In all portraits, French and American, his dress is in\r\naccordance with the fashion. There was not, so far as I can discover, a\r\nsuggestion while he was at Washington, that he was not a suitable guest\r\nfor any drawing-room in the capital.\"\r\n\r\nGilbert Vale, next to Dr. Conway, one of Paine's best biographers, says:\r\n\"Mr. Paine was as much esteemed in his private life as in his public.\r\nHe was a welcome visitor to the tables of the most distinguished\r\ncitizens.... He possessed every prominent virtue in large proportions,\r\nand to these he added the most social qualities.\"\r\n\r\nAnnie Cary Morris: \"Mr. Jefferson, it was said, received him warmly,\r\ndined him at the White House, and could be seen walking arm in arm with\r\nhim on the street any fine afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"The author [Paine] was for some days a guest in the President's\r\nfamily.\"--_Dr. Conway_.\r\n\r\nIn his old age Paine received the following, one of many similar\r\nassurances of Jefferson's affection: \"That you may live long to continue\r\nyour useful labors, and reap the reward in the thankfulness of nations,\r\nis my sincere prayer. Accept the assurances of my high esteem and\r\naffectionate attachment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jefferson's dearest friend,\" says Albert Payson Terhune, \"was Thomas\r\nPaine.\"\r\n\r\nAlbert Badeau: \"My mother [in whose mother's family, prominent and\r\nwealthy residents of New Rochelle, Paine boarded for a time during\r\nhis later years] would never tolerate the aspersions on Mr. Paine.\r\nShe declared steadfastly to the end of her life that he was a\r\nperfect gentleman, and a most faithful friend, amiable, gentle,\r\nnever intemperate in eating or drinking. My mother declared that my\r\ngrandmother equally pronounced the disparaging reports about Mr. Paine\r\nslanders. I never remembered to have seen my mother angry except when\r\nshe heard such calumnies of Mr. Paine, when she would almost insult\r\nthose who uttered them. My mother and grandmother were very religious,\r\nmembers of the Episcopal church.\"\r\n\r\nThe handsome monument erected to Paine at New Rochelle is said to have\r\nbeen suggested by Mrs. Badeau.\r\n\r\nD. Burger (one of Paine's acquaintances at New Rochelle, who often took\r\nhim out riding): \"Mr. Paine was really abstemious, and when pressed to\r\ndrink by those on whom he called during his rides he usually refused\r\nwith great firmness, but politely.\"\r\n\r\nD. M. Bennett of New York, writing forty years ago, says: \"I have\r\nconversed with Major A. Coutant and Mr. Barker of New Rochelle, now\r\nvery far advanced in life, but who distinctly remember Mr. Paine. They\r\nremember him as a pleasant, genial man, who lived on good terms with his\r\nneighbors and was not known to ever have been intoxicated.\" Judge J. B.\r\nStallo, Minister to Italy during President Cleveland's administration,\r\ntold Dr. Conway \"that in early life he visited the place [New Rochelle]\r\nand saw persons who had known Paine, and who declared that Paine resided\r\nthere without fault.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Tabor: \"I was an associate editor of the New York _Beacon_ with\r\nCol. John Fellows, then (1836) advanced in years but retaining all the\r\nvigor and fire of his manhood. He was a ripe scholar, a most agreeable\r\ncompanion, and had been the correspondent and friend of Jefferson,\r\nMadison, Monroe and John Quincy Adams, under all of whom he held a\r\nresponsible office. One of his productions was dedicated, by permission,\r\nto Adams and was republished and favorably received in England. Colonel\r\nFellows was the soul of honor and inflexible in his adhesion to\r\ntruth. He was intimate with Paine during the whole time he lived after\r\nreturning to this country, and boarded for a year in the same house with\r\nhim. I also was acquainted with Judge Herttell of New York city, a man\r\nof wealth and position, being a member of the New York Legislature, both\r\nin the Senate and Assembly, and serving likewise on the judicial bench.\r\nLike Colonel Fellows he was an author and a man of unblemished life and\r\nirreproachable character. These men assured me of their own knowledge\r\nderived from constant personal intercourse during the last seven years\r\nof Paine's life that he never kept any company but what was entirely\r\nrespectable, and that all accusations of drunkenness were grossly\r\nuntrue. They saw him under all circumstances and _knew_ that he was\r\nnever intoxicated. Nay, more, they said for that day he was even\r\nabstemious.\"\r\n\r\nW. J. Hilton (1877): \"It is over twenty years ago that professionally\r\nI made the acquaintance of John Hogeboom, a justice of the peace of\r\nRensselaer county, New York. He was then over seventy years of age and\r\nhad the reputation of being a man of candor and integrity. He was a\r\ngreat admirer of Paine. He told me that he was personally acquainted\r\nwith him and used to see him frequently during the last years of his\r\nlife in the city of New York, where Hogeboom then resided. I asked him\r\nif there was any truth in the charge that Paine was in the habit of\r\ngetting drunk. He said that it was utterly false; that he never heard of\r\nsuch a thing during the lifetime cf Mr. Paine and did not believe anyone\r\nelse did.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lovet (Proprietor of City Hotel, New York): \"Paine boarded for a\r\ntime at my hotel. He drank the least of all my boarders.\"\r\n\r\nGilbert Vale says: \"We know more than twenty persons who were more or\r\nless acquainted with Mr. Paine, and not one of whom ever saw him in\r\nliquor.\" \"We know that he was not only temperate in after life, but even\r\nabstemious.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was accused of offenses he had never committed and of conduct\r\nimpossible to him.\"--_Library of the World's Best Literature_.\r\n\r\n\"That he was a very likeable man is shown... by the prediction of the\r\nbrilliant Home Tooke that whoever should be at a certain dinner party,\r\nPaine would be sure to say the best things said; and by the friendships\r\nhe made so easily. In middle age, at least, he was fastidious in\r\nhis dress, inclined to elegance in his manners, and attractive in\r\nlooks.\"--_Ibid_.\r\n\r\n\"There are eleven original portraits of Thomas Paine, besides a death\r\nmask, a bust, and the profile copied in this [Conway's] work.... In all\r\nof the original portraits of Paine his dress is neat and in accordance\r\nwith fashion.\"--_Dr. Conway_.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing testimonials regarding Paine's personal appearance and\r\ndress are equally true of his old age. The Jarvis painting, executed\r\nwhen he was an old man of sixty-seven, is a mute witness to this. This\r\nportrait is that of a handsome, temperate, well-preserved man. It is\r\nof itself a standing refutation of the slanders of his defamers, and\r\nespecially of the charge that he was addicted to drunkenness in his old\r\nage.\r\n\r\nAaron Burr: \"I always considered Mr. Paine a gentleman, a pleasant\r\ncompanion, and a good-natured and intelligent man, _decidedly\r\ntemperate_.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding another base calumny, Dr. Conway says: \"During Paine's life\r\nthe world heard no hint of sexual immorality connected with him,\r\nbut after his death Cheetham published [in his 'Life of Paine'] the\r\nfollowing: 'Paine brought with him from Paris, and from her husband in\r\nwhose house he had lived, Margaret Brazier Bonneville, and her three\r\nsons. Thomas has the features, countenance, and temper of Paine.'\"\r\nMadame Bonneville was a lady of unblemished character, educated,\r\ncultured and refined. For this vile insinuation its author, a\r\ndisreputable publisher of New York, who boasted of having nine libel\r\nsuits pending against him at one time, was pronounced guilty of slander\r\nby a jury composed mostly of Christians.\r\n\r\nCounsellor Sampson (Cheetham's prosecutor): \"It is argued that\r\neverything should be intended to favor the defendant, who has written\r\nso godly a work against the prince of deists and for the Holy Gospel....\r\nHis book, a godly book--a vile obscene, and filthy compilation, which\r\nbears throughout the character of rancorous malice!\"\r\n\r\nCommenting on this case, Ellery Sedgwick, the able editor of the\r\n_Atlantic Monthly_, in his Beacon biography of Paine, says: \"The\r\nevidence which her (Madame Bonneville's) lawyers adduced at the trial\r\nwas conclusive, and the jury found Cheetham guilty; but Judge Hoffman,\r\nwith casuistry worthy of his version of Christianity, held that Mr.\r\nCheetham, while guilty of libel, had written a very useful book in\r\nfavor of religion, and fixed the damages at the modest sum of $150. Thus\r\nsheltered, Cheetham's lies grew into history.\"\r\n\r\nSome years ago the evangelist, Rev. Dr. R. A. Torrey, while in England,\r\nmade a brutal attack upon Paine's character, repeating the slanders\r\nthat have been circulated against him. W. T. Stead, the noted editor and\r\npublisher of the _Review of Reviews_, London, who later perished on\r\nthe ill-fated Titanic, in his magazine defended Paine and refuted the\r\nslanders of Torrey. Of the Madame Bonneville slander he says:\r\n\r\n\"The 'commonly believed outrageous action' [quoting Torrey] of Thomas\r\nPaine in living with another man's wife was shown to have been the\r\nkindly hospitality shown by an old man of sixty-seven to the refugee\r\nfamily of his French benefactor. The only man who had ever imputed a\r\nshadow of obloquy to Paine in this connection went into the witness-box\r\nafter Paine's death and solemnly swore that there was no foundation for\r\nhis calumny.\"\r\n\r\nThe basis of this calumny was one of the many noble acts of Paine's\r\nlife. When it became known that Napoleon had designs against the\r\nliberties of France, and was planning to elevate himself to power, Paine\r\nand Bonneville opposed him. Concerning the results of this rupture Stead\r\nquotes from Conway as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In return Bonaparte suppressed Bonneville's paper, threw Bonneville\r\ninto prison and placed Paine in surveillance. Afterwards by the\r\nintervention of the American minister Paine was permitted to leave the\r\ncountry. Bonneville was forbidden to quit France. A year after Paine\r\ncrossed the Atlantic Madame Bonneville with her children escaped to\r\nAmerica.... So far from Paine having taken Bonneville's wife away from\r\nher husband, he did everything to induce Napoleon to free Bonneville\r\nfrom surveillance and to allow him to rejoin his wife in New York.\"\r\n\r\nStead finally forced Torrey to eat his words and to make the following\r\nretraction: \"It is the obligation of those who make the charges to prove\r\nthem, and to my mind this particular charge against Paine has not been\r\nproven.\"\r\n\r\nM. and Madame Bonneville had befriended Paine, had invited him to their\r\nhome where for years he enjoyed their hospitality. When Bonneville was\r\nimprisoned and impoverished and his family reduced to penury, Paine\r\nwould have been a base ingrate had he not befriended them.\r\n\r\nDr. Lucy Waite: \"The one circumstance in the life of Thomas Paine that\r\nto my mind more than any other reflects credit upon him as a man,\r\nhas been made the target of the most bitter attacks against him--his\r\nrelations to Madame Bonneville.... His detractors would no doubt have\r\nconsidered it a more 'moral' act if he had sent them to the poor-farm\r\ninstead of to his own farm at New Rochelle; but to the everlasting\r\ncredit of this great man he defied the town gossips, and made them\r\ncomfortable in his own home.\"\r\n\r\nSlanders concerning Paine's marital troubles have been published. He\r\nwas married twice before coming to America, in 1759 to Mary Lambert, who\r\ndied, and in 1771 to Elizabeth Olive, from whom he was separated. The\r\nseparation was by mutual consent and nothing discreditable to either\r\nparty was alleged. As to the cause of the separation all that is known,\r\nor rather surmised, is stated in McClintock and Strong's Cyclopedia, an\r\nOrthodox authority: \"His first wife had died about a year after\r\ntheir marriage; he lived about three years with his second, when they\r\nseparated by mutual consent, it is said, on account of her physical\r\ndisability.\"\r\n\r\nPaine's subsequent treatment of his wife was in the highest degree\r\nhonorable. He had but little property, but what he had he gave to her.\r\nRegarding his conduct in this matter Clio Rickman, his most intimate\r\nfriend in England, and a highly honorable man, bears this testimony:\r\n\r\n\"This I can assert, that Mr. Paine always spoke tenderly and\r\nrespectfully of his wife; and sent her several times pecuniary aid,\r\nwithout her knowing even whence it came.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning this slander W. T. Stead says: \"No one even among Paine's\r\nworst libelers suggests that she had any reason of complaint against\r\nhim.\" One of Paine's calumniators, \"Francis Oldys\" (George Chalmers), a\r\npretended biographer of Paine whose statements are nearly all false or\r\nmisleading, says that while he was an excise officer he bought smuggled\r\ntobacco and was dismissed from the service for the offense. This\r\nstatement is false. Dr. Conway says:\r\n\r\n\"I have before me the minutes of the Board concerning Paine, and there\r\nis no hint whatever of any such accusation.\"\r\n\r\nFalsehoods generally grow rather than diminish with age, and now we are\r\ntold that Paine himself was a smuggler and was dismissed for smuggling.\r\nThe Excise laws were the most odious laws in England, odious alike to\r\nthe people and to the excise officers, who were underpaid (fifty pounds\r\na year) and otherwise mistreated. Paine espoused the cause of his\r\nfellow excisemen and in a memorial addressed to Parliament pleaded for\r\na redress of their grievances. His activity in this matter offended\r\nthe Government and a trivial irregularity commonly practiced by the\r\nexcisemen was made a pretext for his dismissal.\r\n\r\nThe Everyman Encyclopedia: \"Became an excise officer, but agitating for\r\nthe removal of grievances, was dismissed from the service.\"\r\n\r\nHad Paine been discharged for any dishonest or immoral act Franklin\r\nwould have known it and would not have recommended him as \"a worthy\r\nyoung man.\"\r\n\r\nPaine's dismissal was for him, for England, for America and for the\r\nworld one of the most fortunate things that ever occurred. His loss of\r\nthe excise office which occurred in April, 1774, took him to America in\r\nNovember of the same year. The independence of the United States and the\r\nagitation in behalf of popular government throughout the civilized world\r\nfollowed as a result.\r\n\r\nRev. Willet Hicks, a Quaker minister, who was with Paine when he died,\r\ntestified that emissaries of the church tried to bribe him to slander\r\nPaine. He says: \"I could have had any sums if I would have said anything\r\nagainst Thomas Paine, or if even I would have consented to remain\r\nsilent. They informed me that the doctor was willing to say something\r\nthat would satisfy them if I would engage to be silent. Mr. Paine was a\r\ngood man--an honest man.\"\r\n\r\nRev. G. H. Humphrey: \"He was honest. Nor was he uncharitable. He\r\nabstained from profanity and rebuked it in others.\"\r\n\r\nBoston Post (Jan. 29, 1856): \"Calumny has blistered her relentless hand\r\nin trying to stamp him as profane, intemperate and mendacious. The\r\nreal truth appears to be that he was never habituated to profanity,\r\nto drunkenness, nor to falsehood; and that his calumniators are\r\nunconsciously his eulogists.\"\r\n\r\nThe Manchester _Guardian_, probably the most influential journal in\r\nthe British empire, outside of London, says that while the popular\r\nconception of Paine is that of a blatant and immoral demagogue he was\r\nnoted by his companions \"for his shyness, his benevolence, and his\r\ngentleness.\" Joel Barlow, who saw much of him, both in London and Paris,\r\nas well as in America, says: \"He was one of the most benevolent and\r\ndisinterested of mankind.\" \"He was always charitable to the poor beyond\r\nhis means.\" Clio Rickman, most intimate of all his associates, says:\r\n\"He was mild, unoffending, sincere, gentle, humble and unassuming.\" Dr.\r\nBond, who was imprisoned with him in the Luxembourg, says: \"He was the\r\nmost conscientious man I ever knew.\" James Parton says: \"He loved the\r\ntruth for its own sake; and he stood by what he conceived to be the\r\ntruth when all around him reviled it.\" Ellery Sedgwick says: \"The goal\r\nwhich he sought was the happiness of his fellow-men.\"\r\n\r\nHon. George W. Julian, the first Antislavery nominee for Vice-President,\r\none of the founders of the Republican party, and for many years a\r\ndistinguished leader in Congress, says: \"Paine was a perfectly unselfish\r\nand incorruptible patriot; he was a philanthropist in the best sense of\r\nthe word; he was a man of the rarest intelligence and moral courage.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Watts of England says: \"Thomas Paine had a generous and\r\naffectionate nature, a mind superior to fear and selfish interests; a\r\nmind governed by the principles of uniform rectitude and integrity; a\r\nmind the same in prosperity and adversity; a mind which no bribe could\r\nseduce and no terror overawe.\"\r\n\r\nEva Ingersoll Brown: \"Thomas Paine was one of the mental and moral\r\ngiants of his time. He ranked among the foremost of his age. He was\r\nroyal in rectitude, kingly in compassion, sovereign in sympathy. His\r\nreverence for truth and justice was sublime; his love of mercy and his\r\nardor for liberty were unsurpassed.... His was a religion untainted\r\nby touch of dogma or of sect; a thing stainless and pure; of wondrous\r\nbeauty and grandeur.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the orthodox clergy, with a few noble exceptions, have been,\r\nto their overlasting shame, mainly responsible for the ignorance\r\nand prejudice that have prevailed concerning Thomas Paine, Liberal\r\nministers, many of them, to their eternal honor, have braved public\r\nsentiment and dared to do him justice. In an address more than fifty\r\nyears ago the Rev. Moncure D. Conway paid this tribute to the moral\r\ncharacter of Thomas Paine: \"In his life, in his justice, in his truth,\r\nin his adherence to high principles, I look in vain for a parallel in\r\nthose times and in these times. I am selecting my words. I know I am to\r\nbe held accountable for them.\" Rev. Theodore Parker says: \"I think\r\nhe did more to promote piety and morality among men than a hundred\r\nministers of that age in America.\"\r\n\r\nProf. L. F. Laybarger: \"Great was Thomas Paine intellectually, morally\r\nhe was greater.\"\r\n\r\nCol. E. A. Stevens: \"May Americans long appreciate the genius and\r\nreverence the virtues of their noble benefactor, for he left them a\r\nlegacy greater than his works--the contemplation of his high-souled,\r\nunselfish character.\"\r\n\r\nEvery person who has charged Paine with immorality has either invented\r\na falsehood or repeated one. The character of Paine; was as blameless as\r\nthat of Washington. Both men, in their last days, were bitterly assailed\r\nby political enemies. With their deaths political censure, for the most\r\npart, ceased. But Paine's religious opinions were not forgotten, and\r\ncould not be forgiven. His \"Age of Reason\" continued to be read, and\r\nremained unanswered, because unanswerable. What \"Common Sense\" had\r\ndone to kingcraft in America the \"Age of Reason\" promised to do to\r\npriestcraft throughout the world. In her desperation the church seized\r\nher only available weapon, slander. Every inventor of a calumny against\r\nPaine was hailed as a defender of the faith. Unscrupulous biographers\r\nand historians, like Cheetham and McMaster, to curry favor with the\r\nchurch, have recorded these calumnies as facts; and others, accepting\r\nthese writers as reliable authorities, have innocently repeated them.\r\nMany who have acknowledged Paine's services to mankind have felt\r\ncompelled to apologize for his supposed errors. Sir Leslie Stephen, who\r\nhad accepted some of these charges, thus frankly admits that he had been\r\ndeceived: \"I regret to say that I had accepted certain charges against\r\nPaine's character, which Mr. Conway has shown to rest upon worse than\r\nsuspicious evidence.... I fully admit that I was entirely misled by a\r\nhasty reliance upon worthless testimony.\" (_History of English Thought\r\nin the Eighteenth Century, 3rd ed., vol. ii, p. 261, note._)\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Burr: \"While the corpse of the philanthropist lay cooling in\r\nthe ground the English Tory Cheetham wrote a biography full of malignity\r\nand detraction.\"\r\n\r\nCheetham had a double motive in writing his Life of Paine--revenge and\r\ngain. He was an Englishman and had been an ardent Republican. But he had\r\nbetrayed his party and as a result of this he and Paine became engaged\r\nin a bitter controversy. Paine's punishment of the renegade was\r\nterrible. His wounds still smarting when his adversary died, Cheetham\r\nwreaked his vengeance by writing a book in which he presented as facts\r\nall the calumnies that Paine's political and religious enemies had\r\ncirculated concerning him, supplemented by all that his own malignant\r\nmind could invent. Realizing that his career in America was ended he had\r\ndecided to return to England and the book, he believed, would win for\r\nhim the favor and patronage of England's two most powerful institutions,\r\nthe Tory Government and the Orthodox Church.\r\n\r\n\"When, therefore, a party hack, as Cheetham doubtless was, disappointed\r\nand a renegade, with talents, as he certainly possessed, but embittered\r\nin feelings and regardless of truth, as all circumstances contribute to\r\nshow--what could be expected from such a man but just what he produced,\r\na Life of Paine abounding in bold falsehoods, cunningly contrived, and\r\naddressed to a people who wished to be deceived.\"--_Gilbert Vale_.\r\n\r\n\"Cheetham's book is one of the most malicious ever written.\"--_Dr.\r\nConway_.\r\n\r\n\"We have no hesitation in saying that we knew perfectly well at the time\r\nthe motives of that author [Cheetham] for writing and publishing a work,\r\nwhich, we have every reason to believe, is a libel almost from beginning\r\nto end.\"--_Rev. Solomon Southwick._\r\n\r\nEighteen years prior to the appearance of Cheetham's book George\r\nChalmers, an English writer, under the pseudonymn of \"Francis Oldys,\"\r\nbacked by the friends of the English Tory government and for a\r\nconsideration, it is claimed, of £500, to counteract the influence\r\nof the \"Rights of Man\" which was threatening to overthrow monarchy in\r\nEngland, wrote a pretended biography of Paine filled with slander and\r\nvituperation. Referring to this book and the corrupt English political\r\nand religious age in which it was written, Edward Smith, an English\r\nauthor, writing nearly a century later, characterizes it as \"one of the\r\nmost horrible collections of abuse which even that venal day produced.\"\r\n\r\nExcepting Cheetham and Chalmers, all of the biographers of\r\nPaine--Conway, Vale, Rickman, Sedgwick, Sherwin, Blanchard, Linton and\r\nothers--have endeavored to do him justice. But Cheetham's and Chalmer's\r\nbooks have been the arsenals where the orthodox of England and America\r\nhave gone for their weapons with which to attack the author of the \"Age\r\nof Reason.\" Not only have they tried to suppress Paine's book, they have\r\ntried to banish from the public library and book-store every work that\r\nhas appeared in defense of it or its author. For three-quarters of a\r\ncentury the only biographies of Paine to be found in the London library\r\nwere those of Cheetham and Chalmers; the only one to be found in the\r\npublic libraries of America was that of Cheetham. Is it any wonder,\r\nthen, that nearly all the pictures of Paine, even those drawn by\r\nfriendly hands, to be found in our histories, biographical dictionaries,\r\nencyclopedias and other works, should be largely caricatures?\r\n\r\nOne of the foulest of these caricatures is that drawn by the historian\r\nJohn Bach McMaster. For this writer's scurrilous attack on Paine no\r\nexcuse can be offered. The plea of ignorance of Paine's true character\r\nand history cannot be urged in his behalf. He had before him the\r\nauthentic records of Paine's career, in America, at least. He knew\r\nthat his statements were untruthful and unjust. His tirade of abuse is\r\nseemingly for the sole purpose of securing for his books the endorsement\r\nof the clerical bigots who dominate our schools and colleges.\r\n\r\nLouisa Harding: \"One would imagine that even the religious bigot would\r\nknow that he [McMaster] drew for us the picture of a great man, looming\r\nup tall and wide behind the chronicler who strove to pull him down....\r\nIn the course of a careful, impartial investigation of the various\r\nlives of, and articles on, Paine, it became necessary to resort to\r\nthe explanation of blinding religious prejudice; and that, too, having\r\nfailed to fit the case, there seems to be no recourse save to use a\r\nshorter, uglier word--John Bach McMaster _lies_.\"\r\n\r\nA little while ago a prominent American, misled by Paine's calumniators\r\nand too proud to retract it when the error was called to his\r\nattention, applied to the author-hero the brutal epithet \"filthy little\r\nAtheist\"--three falsehoods in three words, for Paine was neither filthy,\r\nlittle, nor an Atheist.\r\n\r\n    [See the works of President Theodore Roosevelt for\r\n    this quotation of his opinion of Thomas Paine.

He was big enough to make in America as\r\nwell as in France the cause of human liberty his debtor forever \"--_Dr.\r\nJohn E. Roberts._\r\n\r\nCommenting on this slander the _Nation_ of England says: \"After all,\r\nour feelings of resentment at such a brutality are assuaged by the\r\nreflection that whereas, this man, will in a quick generation sink to\r\nthe obscurity from which a series of accidents lifted him for a few\r\nyears, history will gradually set in its proper place among the makers\r\nof the Republic the memory of the man whom he defamed.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this vilification is really the tribute that mediocrity pays to\r\ngenius.\"--_Elbert Hubbard_.\r\n\r\nWalt Whitman: \"Paine was double damnably lied about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything lower, meaner, more contemptible, I cannot imagine, to take\r\nan aged man--a man tired to death after a complicated life of toil,\r\nstruggle, anxiety--weak, dragged down, at death's door;... then to\r\npull him into the mud, distort everything he does and says; oh, it's\r\ninfamous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Paine had a noble personality, as exhibited in presence,\r\nface, voice, dress, manner, and what may be called his atmosphere and\r\nmagnetism, especially the later years of his life. I am sure of it. Of\r\nthe foul and foolish fictions yet told about the circumstances of his\r\ndecease, the absolute fact is that he lived a good life, after its kind;\r\nhe died calmly and philosophically, as became him.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Morrison Davidson: \"He died as he lived, one of the grandest\r\nexamples of intellectual piety, fidelity and rectitude that ever lived.\"\r\n\r\nNew York Advertiser (June 9, 1809): \"With heartfelt sorrow and poignant\r\nregret, we are compelled to announce to the world that Thomas Paine is\r\nno more.

Ten years\r\nlater, because of America's ingratitude and neglect, William Cobbett\r\nhad his bones disinterred and sent to England. In connection with\r\ntheir reinterment he had planned a great popular demonstration. \"When I\r\nreturn,\" he said, \"I shall cause them to speak the common sense of\r\nthe great man; I shall gather together the people of Liverpool and\r\nManchester in one assembly with those of London, and those bones will\r\neffect the reformation of England in Church and State.\"\r\n\r\nCobbett, probably waiting for a more opportune time, failed to carry out\r\nhis cherished scheme. The bones of Paine reposed for nearly thirty\r\nyears in their coffin and then disappeared. As late as 1854 a Unitarian\r\nclergyman claimed to have in his possession \"the skull and the right\r\nhand of Thomas Paine.\")\r\n\r\n\"The skull and the right hand of Thomas Paine!\" What priceless relics!\r\nCould they be found America should repossess them, place them in a\r\ncasket of gold and preserve them in a shrine at her national capitol.\r\nWithin that skull was conceived this great republic. That hand wrote the\r\ninspired volume which transformed a vague dream into a glorious reality.\r\nThat hand, too, wrote two other immortal works which, slowly but surely,\r\nare effecting what Cobbett contemplated, \"the reformation of England in\r\nChurch and State.\"\r\n\r\n\"His 'Rights of Man' is now the political constitution of England,\r\nhis 'Age of Reason' is the growing constitution of its Church.\"--_Dr.\r\nConway._\r\n\r\n\"As to his bones, no man knows the place of their rest to this day.

Ingersoll says: \"I challenge the world\r\nto show that Thomas Paine ever wrote one line, one word in favor of\r\ntyranny--in favor of immorality; one line, one word against what he\r\nbelieved to be for the highest and best interests of mankind; one\r\nline, one word against justice, charity or liberty; and yet he has been\r\npursued as though he had been a fiend from hell.\"\r\n\r\nHarriet Law: \"There are few to whom the world owes more, and probably\r\nnone to whose memory it has been more ungrateful.\"\r\n\r\nEdward D.

On the 14th of\r\nOctober, 1905, at New Rochelle, where, less than one hundred years\r\nbefore, Paine, because of his religious belief, was denied burial in\r\na Christian cemetery, the beautiful monument erected at his grave by\r\nadmiring friends was rededicated and assigned to the custody of that\r\ncity, where, held as a sacred treasure, it is now guarded with watchful\r\nand loving care. The nation, the state, and the city united to make\r\nthe event a memorable one. Major General Frederick D. Grant sent two\r\ncompanies of United States troops and a regimental band; the state of\r\nNew York sent a battery which fired a salute of thirteen guns; the mayor\r\ndelivered a eulogy on Paine, and the city council participated in the\r\nexercises. The school children of New Rochelle sang the \"Star Spangled\r\nBanner\" and one of Paine's own songs. Various civic and military\r\nsocieties also took part in the celebration--the Grand Army of the\r\nRepublic, Woman's Auxiliary of the Grand Army of the Republic, Spanish\r\nWar Veterans, Minutemen, Washington Continental Guards, and Sons of\r\nthe American Revolution. Dr. Conway, Paine's faithful biographer, sent\r\na letter of greeting from Paris, and a daughter of France a handsome\r\nwreath to lay upon the patriot's tomb.\r\n\r\nHenry S. Clark (Mayor of New Rochelle):\r\n\r\n\"This memorial should serve and will remain an object lesson,\r\ninculcating not only patriotism, but the fundamental idea which appeared\r\nonly in Paine's writings--political equality for all men.\"\r\n\r\n\"We accept this splendid memorial and pledge ourselves to ever protect\r\nand preserve it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The two chief centers by which the lovers of liberty, humanity and\r\nprogress will love to linger and gather inspiration in America will\r\nhenceforth be the mausoleum of Washington by the Potomac, and\r\nthis monument of Paine by his old home in your lovely city of New\r\nRochelle.\"--_T.

Common Sense is fast supplanting\r\nSuperstition, the Rights of Man are bound to triumph, and the\r\nauthor-hero's name will gather lustre as the years roll by.\r\n\r\n     \"That man is thought a knave or fool,\r\n     Or bigot plotting crime,\r\n     Who for the advancement of his kind,\r\n     Is wiser than his time.\r\n     For him the hemlock shall distil,\r\n     For him the axe be bared;\r\n     For him the gibbet shall be built,\r\n     For him the stake prepared.\r\n     Him shall the scorn and wrath of men\r\n     Pursue with deadly aim;\r\n     And malice, envy, spite, and lies\r\n     Shall desecrate his name.\r\n     But never a truth has been destroyed,\r\n     They may curse it, and call it crime;\r\n     Pervert and betray, and slander and slay\r\n     Its teachers for a time:\r\n     But the sunshine, aye, shall light the sky,\r\n     As round and round we run;\r\n     And the truth shall ever come uppermost,\r\n     And justice shall be done.\"\r\n\r\nUngrateful Athens bade her savior drain the poisoned cup. It did its\r\nwork, the spark of life was quenched; but the name of Socrates shines\r\non, undimmed by the flight of more than twenty centuries. Columbus\r\nlanguished in chains, forged by the nation he had made renowned; but\r\nno chains can bind the towering fame his genius won. Religious zealots\r\nsealed the lips of a philosopher; but could they stop the revolving\r\nearth? Could they control the rising tide that rolled upon the boundless\r\nsea of thought? No! the earth went round, the wave rolled on. To-day,\r\nthe very church that persecuted Galileo reveres his name, accepts\r\nhis teachings, and through his telescope, the instrument she once,\r\ncondemned, her votaries, with eager eye and throbbing pulse, explore the\r\nstarry fields of heaven. It is ever so: \"Truth crushed to earth shall\r\nrise again.\" Each fierce Thermopylae she meets inspires some crowning\r\nSalamis. The wrongs of Thomas Paine shall be avenged. In vain his\r\ncountry passed to him the bitter cup; the fetters forged to chain his\r\nnoble spirit to the dust were forged for naught; loving lips whisper,\r\n\"It still moves!\"\r\n\r\nI pity the man whose soul is so small that he cannot rise above the\r\nlevel of his creed to do justice to those whose religious opinions have\r\nnot been gauged by his particular standard. I am no Christian, but may I\r\nnever become so ungrateful as to ignore my obligations to those who are.\r\nWhen war was desolating our fair land, and my young heart yearned to\r\nenlist in its defense, a Christian mother printed a kiss upon the cheek\r\nof her only boy and bade him go; Christian hands made the grand old flag\r\nwe followed; Christian women visited our hospitals, ministering to the\r\nsick and wiping the death-damp from the brows of the dying; Christian\r\ngenerals led their troops on many a hard-fought field; and tonight the\r\nstately oak, the drooping willow, and the moaning pine stand sentinel\r\nby many a Christian soldier's grave. But they are not alone. Beside his\r\nChristian comrade--beneath the shadows of the same trees--a martyr to\r\nthe same cause--sleeps the unbeliever. And would you strew with flowers\r\nand moisten with tears the grave that enfolds the one, and trample with\r\nscorn the turf that grows upon the other? Side by side they grandly\r\nmarched to war; side by side they bravely fought; side by side\r\nheroically they fell; and in the murmuring stream that, wanders by their\r\nresting-place is heard the funeral chant of no religious creed, but\r\nnature's eternal sweet, sad requiem to all.\r\n\r\nGo to the grave of Thomas Paine, my Christian friend. Stand beside the\r\ntomb where rest the ashes of this unappreciated genius. Take up his\r\nlittle volume \"Common Sense.\" Open its pages and peruse its burning\r\nwords. When done, unfold the map upon which are delineated \"The Free\r\nand Independent States of America.\" Contemplate the inspiring picture\r\nwrought thereon--wrought by the author-hero's magic pen--then refuse the\r\nsimple tribute of a tear or flower!\r\n\r\nWho is responsible for the obloquy that has been cast upon the memory\r\nof this noble man? The church, the orthodox church alone, is responsible\r\nfor it. And let me say to the church, it ill becomes you to point to\r\nthe alleged moral delinquencies of this man while your own garments are\r\nsoiled and crimsoned with the vice and crime of centuries. You claim\r\nthat amid the thunders of Sinai God gave the Decalogue as a moral guide\r\nto man. Judged even by this standard the moral character of Thomas Paine\r\nwill not suffer from a comparison with that of yours.\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\" \"I believe in one God and no\r\nmore,\" said Thomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt worship no graven image.\" No worshiper of images was he.\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.\" He abstained\r\nfrom profanity himself and rebuked it in others.\r\n\r\n\"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.\" He observed this law as\r\nfaithfully as did his Christian neighbors.\r\n\r\n\"Honor thy father and thy mother.\" His parents were the objects of his\r\nreverence and love.\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt not kill.\" He did not kill. He labored to abolish war and\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\n\"Thout shalt not commit adultery.\" He was charged with adultery, and the\r\nfoul beast who made the charge was forced to pay a heavy fine for his\r\nlibelous assault.\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt not steal.\" Were all mankind as honest as he was the\r\nlocksmith's avocation would be gone.\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt not bear false witness.\" From his truthful lips no one ever\r\nheard a falsehood fall.\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt not covet.\" A man who consecrates his life to the cause of\r\nhumanity, and who steadily refuses to be recompensed for his services,\r\ncannot be accused of covetousness.\r\n\r\nNow, let me ask the church, what is your record? How have you kept even\r\nthe commandments of your own law?\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\" And yet, you have persecuted,\r\nimprisoned, tortured, butchered, and burned thousands for not believing\r\nin a trinity of gods.\r\n\r\n\"Before no idol shalt thou bow thy knee.\" Your places of public\r\nworship are filled with idols--virgins, and saints, and crucifixes, and\r\nBibles--objects of as blind adoration as the idols of heathen lands.\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt not take the name of God in vain.\" On every hand our\r\nears are greeted by the oaths of those who, whether belonging to any\r\nparticular sect or not, believe in the existence of the God and the\r\ndivinity of the Christ they curse.\r\n\r\n\"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.\" For eighteen hundred years\r\nyou have not kept a Sabbath of your God. You observe a day he never\r\nauthorized you to observe.\r\n\r\n\"Honor thy father and thy mother.\" The Christ you worship spurned the\r\nloving mother who bore him and declared that he who hated not father and\r\nmother could not be his disciple.\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt not kill.\" You have made of earth a slaughter house. For\r\ncenturies it resounded with the shrieks of murdered millions, victims\r\nof your relentless fury. And today your votaries are drenching Europe's\r\nsoil with blood.\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt not commit adultery.\" Your most immaculate saints violate\r\nthis commandment and become a stench in the nostrils of decent people.\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt not steal.\" Today the prisons of Europe and America shelter\r\nthree hundred thousand Christian thieves.\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt not bear false witness.\" Perjury is rife in Christendom; and\r\neven in heathen lands the very name of Christianity has become a synonym\r\nfor falsehood and deceit.\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt not covet.\" Your history is the history of covetousness\r\nitself. Christian Rome has tried to devour the world. A little while ago\r\nwe saw the Greek cross planted upon the Balkan--saw the Russian eagle\r\nperched upon those snowy crags, gloating over the misfortunes of\r\nTurkey, eager to clutch in his greedy talons the territory of Islam, and\r\nprevented only by the jealous wolves of Protestantism.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the warmest hearts and brightest intellects are leaving\r\nyou. Upon your walls they read the fateful words that met the terrified\r\ngaze of Babylon's sinful king. Your devotees are looking forward to a\r\nmillennium when your power on earth shall be supreme. Delusive phantom!\r\nyour millennium has come and gone. That dark blot on the page of\r\nhistory--that withering pall stretching across the centuries from\r\nConstantine to Luther--that constitutes the thousand years of Christian\r\nrule foretold in the Apocalypse. But that has past, and your power is\r\nvanishing, never to be restored again. From the ashes of that dauntless\r\nhero, Giordano Bruno, young Science, phoenixlike, arose, and in the soil\r\nprepared by Luther, sowed the seed whose harvest is your death. Even now\r\nI hear your death-knell ringing; even now I gaze into a sepulchre where\r\nsoon must lie your Bible and your creeds--your stakes, your gibbets and\r\nyour racks--your priests, your devil and your God! And when the last\r\nhave been entombed, then gather up the crumbling bones of the one\r\nhundred million human beings who have perished at your hands, and let\r\nthis ghastly pile remain, a most befitting monument to your unbounded\r\ncruelties and crimes!\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasing thought to know that bigotry is fading from the\r\nearth. It can flourish only in the malarial swamps of ignorance and\r\nsuperstition, and the poisonous vapors arising from these loathsome\r\nregions are being fast dispelled by the sun of science.\r\n\r\nAn incident in the life of Nicholas I. of Russia furnishes a fitting\r\nparallel to what the bigots of our time are now experiencing. Among\r\nthe many admirers of that other great Deist, Voltaire, was the Empress\r\nCatharine, who ordered a statue of him from the leading sculptor of\r\nEurope. When it arrived Catharine was dying, and for years it lay\r\nuntouched in the box in which it had been shipped.\r\n\r\nAt length Alexander caused it to be set up in a room of the imperial\r\npalace, where it remained until Nicholas ascended the throne. Nicholas\r\nwas a most admirable type of the religious bigot; he was ignorant and\r\nintolerant, and the character of Voltaire was the object of his especial\r\nhatred. Hardly had he donned the imperial robes before he began to\r\nrealize\r\n\r\n     \"How uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.\"\r\n\r\nAn insurrection had broken out in one of his provinces. Troubled and\r\nperplexed, he was wandering through the halls of the palace when,\r\nsuddenly, he stood face to face with the statue of Voltaire. That\r\nhaughty smile, so natural to the face of the living Voltaire, had been\r\ntransferred to his marble image; and now it seemed to mock the troubled\r\nemperor. He summoned one of his ministers and ordered him to remove the\r\noffensive work. The minister did so, placing it in an old lumber room of\r\nthe palace. All went well with the emperor until one night the cry of\r\n\"fire!\" resounded in his ears. The palace was on fire. Rushing to the\r\nscene of the conflagration he chanced to pass through the very room to\r\nwhich the statue had been removed, and again he stood before the object\r\nof his hatred. The red glare of the flames added to the terrors of the\r\nscene, and, for a moment, Nicholas fancied himself translated to the\r\ndominions of Satan and standing before his throne. The flames were\r\nfinally extinguished, the greater portion of the palace was saved, and\r\nwith it the statue. But the remembrance of this terrible scene haunted\r\nhim like an apparition all night long. He could not sleep. In the\r\nmorning he summoned his minister and ordered him to destroy the work of\r\nart. Out of respect for the dead Catharine the order was unheeded. Years\r\nrolled by; the armies of England and France had invaded the Crimea and\r\ndefeated with frightful slaughter the armies of the czar. Then flashed\r\nto St. Petersburg news of the bombardment of Sebastopol which ultimately\r\nfell. It was night, and, wild with anguish, Nicholas was again wandering\r\nthrough those desolate halls--lighted only by the weird moonbeams that\r\ncame straggling through the palace windows--when, for the third time,\r\nhe was confronted by the ghostly statue. Again he summoned his minister.\r\nBut his iconoclastic spirit was broken. He no longer demanded the\r\ndestruction of the statue, but simply begged his official to remove it\r\nto where he should never more behold it. The wily minister bethought\r\nhim of a place never visited by his sovereign, and accordingly had it\r\nremoved to the imperial library. Nicholas is no more; but the statue\r\nremains--a silent monarch in that realm of thought--an object, not of\r\nabhorrence and dread, but of admiration.\r\n\r\nAs the Russian bigot was haunted by the statue of Voltaire, so the\r\nbigots of our day and country are haunted by the memory of Paine.\r\nTheological insurrections are breaking out on every hand; the\r\nintellectual fires of the twentieth century are encircling and consuming\r\nthe rude palace of Superstition; they hear the cannon of Science\r\nthundering before the walls of their Sebastopol. Terror-stricken,\r\naimlessly and hopelessly they wander on, only to be confronted at every\r\nturn by the ghost of Thomas Paine. Unhappy beings, this will not forever\r\nlast. Not always will the good name of Thomas Paine stand as a phantom\r\nto frighten bigots. Gently and lovingly his friends are removing it,\r\npassing it on from generation to generation, to a better and a grander\r\nage--to an age across whose threshold no bigot's foot shall ever pass.\r\nThen, when the Republic of the World has been established, and the\r\nReligion of Humanity has become the universal religion, all mankind will\r\nrecognize the worth and revere the memory of him who wrote the political\r\nand religious creed of this glorious day:\r\n\r\n--THE WORLD IS MY COUNTRY, TO DO GOOD MY RELIGION.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE END.",
