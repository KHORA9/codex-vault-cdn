In some\r\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\r\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\r\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\r\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\r\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\r\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\r\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\r\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\r\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\r\nembalmed in the nation’s memory, and the story of their heroism will\r\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\r\nour children’s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\r\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\r\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\r\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\r\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\r\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\r\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\r\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\r\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\r\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\r\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\r\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\r\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\r\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\r\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\r\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\r\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\r\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  “Although South Africa is\r\na rising colony,” writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, “I hardly think it offers\r\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\r\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\r\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\r\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\r\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\r\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\r\nbecoming a rich man.”  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\r\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\r\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\r\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\r\n“South Africa,” wrote a _Saturday Reviewer_ recently, “is the paradise of\r\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.”  The remark is not exactly\r\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\r\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\r\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\r\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\r\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\r\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\r\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\r\nto be proved.\r\n\r\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\r\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\r\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\r\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\r\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\r\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\r\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\r\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\r\nour earliest colonists, says, “Their demeanour towards us, whom they\r\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\r\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\r\ncircumstances, have been expected.”  They were, he says, uncultivated,\r\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\r\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\r\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\r\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\r\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\r\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\r\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate’s office at Cradock,\r\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\r\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\r\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate’s order, he boldly\r\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\r\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\r\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\r\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\r\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\r\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\r\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\r\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\r\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\r\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\r\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\r\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\r\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\r\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\r\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\r\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\r\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\r\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\r\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\r\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\r\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\r\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\r\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\r\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\r\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\r\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\r\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\r\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\r\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\r\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\r\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\r\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\r\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\r\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\r\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\r\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\r\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\r\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\r\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\r\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\r\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\r\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\r\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\r\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\r\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\r\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\r\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\r\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\r\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\r\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\r\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\r\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\r\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\r\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\r\nfor annexation, he said, “We fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\r\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\r\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\r\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\r\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\r\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\r\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\r\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\r\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?”\r\n\r\n“The Transvaal,” wrote one who knew South Africa well—the late Mr. Thomas\r\nBaines—“will yet command the admiration of the world for the\r\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.”  As\r\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\r\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\r\nseveral hundred pounds’ worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\r\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\r\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\r\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\r\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\r\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\r\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\r\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\r\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\r\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\r\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\r\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\r\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\r\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\r\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\r\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\r\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\r\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\r\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\r\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\r\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\r\n“Some little time before our arrival,” he writes, “a German conjurer had\r\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\r\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\r\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\r\namongst them.”  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\r\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\r\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\r\n“Oh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!” and the poor Boer was done.\r\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\r\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\r\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\r\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\r\nNyl—a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\r\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\r\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\r\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\r\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\r\nthe Lord?\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\r\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\r\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\r\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\r\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\r\ntook possession of Natal, “there was hardly a native to be seen, the\r\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\r\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\r\nevery one.”  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\r\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\r\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\r\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\r\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\r\nnative difficulty in Natal—the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\r\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\r\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\r\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\r\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\r\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\r\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\r\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\r\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\r\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\r\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\r\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: “The coloured people are\r\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\r\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\r\nthrough the Transvaal,” continues the same writer, “I saw in various\r\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\r\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\r\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\r\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\r\nprevious residence in Natal.”  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\r\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\r\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\r\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\r\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\r\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\r\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: “The spirit of dislike to\r\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\r\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\r\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\r\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\r\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\r\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\r\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\r\nwithin them.”  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\r\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\r\nsays, “has a grand appearance, the Dutch minister’s house, standing in\r\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\r\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\r\nworthy of remark.”  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\r\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\r\nprovide, and “before the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\r\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.”  On another occasion,\r\nSir Arthur’s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\r\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\r\nhe records the fact that, “late in the evening the sounds of the Evening\r\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\r\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\r\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,” adds Sir Arthur, “to hear\r\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\r\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\r\nhappy.”  Sir Arthur writes:—“There are no finer young men in the world\r\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\r\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\r\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\r\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\r\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\r\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\r\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.”  As\r\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\r\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\r\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\r\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\r\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\r\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\r\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  “They do not wish,” writes Sir\r\nArthur Cunynghame, “to move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\r\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.”  Their moral discipline also seems\r\nsomewhat severe.  “In the little fort,” writes Captain Aylward, “was an\r\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\r\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\r\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\r\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\r\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\r\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\r\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\r\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\r\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.”  At\r\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur’s visit, an altercation had taken\r\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\r\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\r\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\r\nBoers are, let us take the following story:—A schoolmaster was lately\r\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\r\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\r\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\r\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\r\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\r\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\r\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\r\nschoolmaster said, “I teach them nothing but the movements of the\r\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.”  The\r\nminister answered, “Well, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\r\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\r\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\r\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.”  The\r\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\r\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\r\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\r\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\r\nflourishing, “Yes, we are fortunate in our minister;” and when it was\r\nfalling back it was, “Ah! all will alter when we get rid of our present\r\nminister.”\r\n\r\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\r\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  “Delenda est Carthago” is\r\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\r\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\r\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\r\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\r\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\r\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\r\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\r\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\r\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\r\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\r\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\r\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\r\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\r\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that “our British\r\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\r\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\r\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\r\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives—Zulus and\r\nBasutos—without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\r\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\r\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty’s enemies, and\r\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\r\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\r\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\r\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\r\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\r\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\r\nguns.”  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\r\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\r\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\r\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\r\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\r\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\r\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\r\n“an ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\r\nminority”—a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\r\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\r\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\r\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\r\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\r\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\r\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\r\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\r\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\r\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\r\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\r\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\r\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\r\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\r\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\r\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\r\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\r\nlast, says, “So long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\r\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\r\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\r\nstate of things virtually came to an end.”\r\n\r\n_Ex uno disce omnes_.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\r\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\r\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\r\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\r\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man’s Land, which was some years\r\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\r\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\r\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\r\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\r\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\r\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\r\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\r\n“In the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\r\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\r\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\r\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\r\nthe clergyman in earnest.”  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\r\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\r\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\r\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\r\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\r\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\r\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\r\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\r\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\r\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\r\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\r\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\r\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\r\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\r\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\r\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\r\n\r\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\r\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\r\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\r\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\r\n“The Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\r\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\r\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\r\nCarnarvon’s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\r\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\r\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\r\ndesire to become our subjects.”  The Boers also object to the annexation,\r\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\r\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\r\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\r\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\r\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\r\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\r\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\r\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\r\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\r\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\r\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\r\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\r\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\r\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  “If\r\nthere be,” he writes, “any laws of right and wrong, by which nations\r\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\r\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.”  And Mr.\r\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\r\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\r\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\r\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\r\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\r\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\r\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\r\n\r\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\r\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\r\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\r\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\r\nreported to have said:—“My brethren and fellow-countrymen,—I am very glad\r\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\r\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\r\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\r\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\r\nwishes—aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, _I_ will not detain you\r\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\r\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\r\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\r\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\r\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\r\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\r\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don’t do anything of\r\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\r\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\r\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\r\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\r\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\r\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\r\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\r\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\r\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\r\nthat I, if _I_ have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\r\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God’s\r\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.”  Other speeches were\r\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\r\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\r\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\r\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\r\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\r\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:—“The\r\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\r\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\r\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\r\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.”  After the meeting,\r\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\r\nFrere’s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\r\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\r\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\r\nUltimately it was resolved, “That the committee, having learned the\r\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\r\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\r\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\r\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\r\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\r\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.”  Clearly, when we\r\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\r\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the _Natal Mercury_, we had better\r\nleave them alone.\r\n\r\nThe following, says the _Natal Witness_, is a translation of the oath of\r\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\r\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\r\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\r\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\r\nEnglish nation:—“In the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\r\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\r\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\r\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\r\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\r\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\r\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\r\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\r\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\r\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\r\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\r\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\r\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\r\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\r\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\r\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\r\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\r\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.”\r\n\r\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\r\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\r\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\r\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:—“Who is responsible for\r\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\r\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\r\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\r\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\r\n‘Might is Right’ seems now to be England’s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\r\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\r\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\r\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\r\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\r\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\r\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\r\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\r\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\r\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.”\r\n\r\nThe South African correspondent of the _Daily News_, writing from\r\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:—“It is now only too evident to every one that\r\nSir Bartle Frere’s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\r\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\r\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\r\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\r\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\r\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\r\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\r\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\r\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\r\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons—first, because it was\r\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\r\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\r\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\r\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\r\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\r\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\r\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\r\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\r\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\r\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\r\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\r\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\r\nSouth Africa, would come in also.”\r\n\r\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\r\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\r\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\r\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\r\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\r\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\r\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\r\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was “again\r\nall Government,” see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\r\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\r\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\r\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\r\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\r\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\r\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\r\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\r\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\r\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\r\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\r\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\r\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\r\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\r\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\r\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\r\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\r\nO’Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem—the storm will blow\r\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\r\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\r\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\r\nhave to pay the bill—not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\r\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\r\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\r\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\r\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\r\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR KAFFIR WARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\r\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\r\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\r\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\r\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\r\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\r\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\r\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\r\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\r\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\r\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\r\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\r\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\r\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\r\npassing day—we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\r\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\r\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\r\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\r\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\r\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\r\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\r\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\r\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget £344,000 are put down for the Transkei\r\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\r\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\r\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\r\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\r\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, “Great as is the parliamentary\r\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\r\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\r\npopulation out of the British pocket.”  And yet in Natal the _Daily News_\r\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\r\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\r\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\r\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\r\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\r\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\r\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\r\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\r\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\r\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\r\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\r\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\r\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\r\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\r\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\r\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\r\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\r\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\r\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\r\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\r\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\r\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\r\nmanner—no quarter was given by the white man—no prisoners taken—all were\r\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\r\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\r\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\r\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\r\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\r\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\r\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter’s chief councillors, and\r\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\r\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\r\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\r\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\r\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\r\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\r\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\r\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\r\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\r\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\r\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\r\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\r\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\r\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\r\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\r\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\r\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\r\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\r\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\r\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\r\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy’s country, carrying fire and\r\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\r\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\r\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\r\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\r\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\r\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\r\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\r\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\r\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\r\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\r\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\r\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna’s kraal with a\r\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\r\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\r\nlittle resistance could be made.  _As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\r\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power_, Major Somerset\r\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\r\n7,000 head.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\r\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\r\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\r\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\r\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\r\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\r\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\r\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\r\nthan to get up a _casus belli_.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\r\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\r\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  “I was speaking to a friend,” he\r\nwrites, “respecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\r\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\r\nthem.”  “But,” said my friend, “I would work with foresight.  I would\r\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\r\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\r\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\r\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\r\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\r\nof course they would lose their country.”\r\n\r\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\r\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\r\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\r\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\r\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\r\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\r\nD’Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\r\nKaffirs had “ample justification.”  It seems to an impartial observer\r\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\r\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\r\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\r\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\r\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\r\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\r\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\r\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\r\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\r\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\r\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\r\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, “Every year a commando comes, every week a\r\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.”  It was then\r\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\r\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\r\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\r\n“that Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\r\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\r\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\r\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.”\r\n\r\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\r\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes—the erection\r\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\r\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\r\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\r\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\r\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain—the man was\r\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\r\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\r\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\r\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\r\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\r\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\r\n\r\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\r\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\r\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\r\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\r\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty’s Government to be supreme.  In the case\r\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\r\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\r\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\r\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\r\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\r\n£500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\r\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\r\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\r\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\r\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\r\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\r\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\r\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\r\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\r\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\r\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\r\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\r\nnation—that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\r\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\r\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\r\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\r\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\r\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\r\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\r\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\r\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\r\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\r\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\r\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\r\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\r\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\r\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\r\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\r\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\r\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\r\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\r\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\r\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\r\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\r\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\r\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\r\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\r\nhave hitherto known.\r\n\r\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\r\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\r\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\r\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\r\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\r\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\r\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\r\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\r\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\r\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\r\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\r\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\r\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\r\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\r\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\r\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\r\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\r\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\r\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\r\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\r\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\r\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\r\n£500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\r\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\r\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people—a\r\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\r\nMuch more than this may be said.  “Kaffirs seem,” writes Lady Barker, “a\r\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\r\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\r\noutside our fence.”  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\r\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\r\nSociety of Arts.  “The Zulu,” he said, “may not be dignified, but\r\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\r\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\r\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\r\ndon’t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\r\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\r\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\r\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\r\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\r\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\r\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.”\r\n\r\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\r\n_Cape Mercury_ wrote—“It is said the Kaffir language has no word for\r\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\r\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\r\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\r\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\r\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\r\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\r\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\r\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, ‘I\r\ndon’t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\r\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\r\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\r\nenable you to provide for his children.’  The value of the waggon was\r\n£60.”\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\r\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  “The other day,” says a\r\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the _Independent_, “a wheelbarrow\r\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\r\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\r\nthe careless servant, ‘Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?’  The reply was an\r\nindignant query, ‘What about my wheelbarrow?  It’s smashed, and your\r\nKaffir isn’t hurt.’”\r\n\r\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\r\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\r\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\r\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo’s young men have\r\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\r\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\r\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\r\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\r\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\r\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\r\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\r\n\r\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\r\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\r\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the _Natal\r\nWitness_ of the 8th of February says:—“Civilisation has become\r\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\r\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\r\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\r\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\r\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\r\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\r\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\r\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\r\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\r\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\r\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\r\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing—that it is now extinguished.  The\r\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\r\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\r\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\r\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\r\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this—that the native\r\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\r\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\r\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\r\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\r\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\r\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\r\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\r\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\r\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\r\nnot pay—if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\r\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\r\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\r\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\r\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\r\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\r\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\r\nby our readers as best they may be able.”  Such is a colonial aspect of\r\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\r\n\r\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\r\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\r\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\r\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\r\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\r\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\r\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\r\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\r\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\r\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\r\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\r\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\r\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\r\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\r\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\r\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\r\nharvests of the world.\r\n\r\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\r\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent—hundreds of\r\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\r\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\r\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\r\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\r\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\r\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\r\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\r\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\r\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\r\nnatives themselves.\r\n\r\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\r\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\r\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\r\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\r\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\r\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\r\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\r\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\r\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\r\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\r\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\r\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\r\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\r\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\r\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\r\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\r\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\r\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\r\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\r\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\r\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba ’Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\r\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\r\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\r\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\r\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\r\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\r\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\r\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\r\nPolice, says—“As a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\r\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.”  Mr. Trollope remarks\r\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\r\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\r\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\r\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\r\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\r\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\r\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\r\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\r\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\r\n\r\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\r\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\r\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\r\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\r\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\r\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\r\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\r\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\r\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\r\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\r\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\r\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\r\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\r\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\r\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\r\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\r\nbut they border the Orange Free State—lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\r\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\r\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\r\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\r\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\r\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\r\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\r\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\r\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\r\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\r\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\r\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\r\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs—Morosi—has,\r\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little _emeute_ on his own\r\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\r\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\r\nsays:—“I wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\r\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\r\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\r\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\r\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\r\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\r\nwithout a struggle.”  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\r\nFrankfort and King William’s-town have been British subjects for\r\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\r\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\r\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\r\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\r\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\r\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\r\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\r\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\r\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\r\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\r\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\r\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William’s-town young native men,\r\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys’\r\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\r\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\r\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\r\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\r\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\r\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\r\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\r\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\r\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\r\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\r\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\r\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n           W.

These include the Refuges for\r\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, “Dr.\r\nBarnardo’s Homes.”\r\n\r\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\r\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\r\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\r\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\r\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\r\nbriefly state its more important branches.\r\n\r\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\r\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\r\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\r\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\r\n\r\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\r\nMission, and are trained upon the _family system_, which is, in many\r\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\r\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\r\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\r\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\r\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\r\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\r\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\r\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\r\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\r\n\r\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\r\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\r\nInstitutions.\r\n\r\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\r\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\r\nthe Metropolis, the “Edinburgh Castle,” was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\r\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\r\nfellow, the “Dublin Castle,” situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\r\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\r\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\r\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\r\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\r\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\r\nreligious and temperance efforts, among _adults_, as well as the\r\neducational and refuge work among _destitute children_, need a\r\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\r\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\r\nbankers an advance of £6,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\r\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\r\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\r\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\r\nestablishment in 1867.\r\n\r\nContributions in response to this appeal may be sent to the Bankers of\r\nthe Institution, Messrs. Dimsdale, Fowler, and Co., 50, Cornhill; or the\r\nLondon and South-Western Bank, Bow Branch; and will be gratefully\r\nacknowledged by the Honorary Director, Dr. Barnardo, at the Office of the\r\nInstitution, 18, Stepney Causeway, E.\r\n\r\n                           CAIRNS, _President_.\r\n\r\n                       KINNAIRD, _Vice-President_.\r\n\r\n                         W.
