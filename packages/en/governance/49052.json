[Price 2 Cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Gordon Bennett, Horace Greeley, and Henry J. Raymond.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall review the editorial career of these men, (whom I regard as\r\nextremely vicious,) and I shall begin with Bennett, because he is the\r\neldest and biggest villain of the trio. I have written for the _Herald_\r\nsince I was a student at Cambridge in 1836, for which I have received\r\nonly $250. I have written for the _Times_ nearly since its advent, for\r\nwhich I have received nothing. I have written for the _Tribune_ since\r\nthe first year of its existence, for which I have received nothing\r\nbut infinite detraction. So, in all I may say of these ungrateful\r\nscoundrels, I shall evince no ingratitude or treachery. Bennett’s face\r\nis the reflection of hell and the prince of devils. In conversation,\r\nhe is obscene and blasphemous, and thoroughly wicked in every thought,\r\nand to listen to his obscenity, and blasphemy, and corrupt suggestions,\r\nin his old age, makes one shudder with horror to the inner temples\r\nof the soul. He is a low and cunning Scotchman, of a large brain, of\r\nsuperficial cultivation—has no critical knowledge of grammar, and\r\nhis orthography is quite imperfect—could accurately define Websters\r\n“science,” only as it represents the mode of extortion—has read very\r\nlittle—is an unnaturalized alien, and a monarchist of the deepest dye.\r\nHis leading motive, since he acquired his almighty dollar position as\r\na journalist, has been to corrupt the people, and thus subvert our\r\ninstitutions, and cast us again into the embraces of British despots,\r\nwhom he still loves, and will ever recognize as his native masters.\r\nHis wife permanently resides in Europe, and the son who bears his\r\nname was educated in London, Paris, and Vienna,—and Bennett himself\r\nhas passed most of his latter years in Europe, with flying visits to\r\nAmerica to black mail private citizens and the politicians in our\r\nMunicipal, State, and National elections. As incontrovertible evidence\r\nof his sympathy with corruptionists, he never wrote a syllable in favor\r\nof the election of an honorable man to office. In the abstract, he\r\nprates of virtue, and has always denounced public rogues as no other\r\nman in America, but concretely and in the assassin’s ambush, he toils\r\nfrom choice and for a cash consideration to elect prison birds for\r\nour rulers. As long as the candidate for office holds him through a\r\nbeautiful woman, or will jingle gold before his eyes, he will sustain\r\nhim, and magnify him into a human god; but the moment she ceases to\r\nfondle, and caress, and hug, and kiss his hideous features, or her\r\nbeauty fades, or her paramour falls through penury, or the loss of the\r\npublic confidence,—when one or all of these calamities transpire, he\r\nseeks new victims, and tramples the old like spiders, as he now does\r\nGeorge Law and Fernando Wood, and others, whom he has bled of half a\r\nmillion. And when Mariposa fails to yield its wonted supply of gold, he\r\nwill abandon Fremont, and support some notorious scamp for President,\r\nwho is a perjured alien, or a great national plunderer, or a dastard\r\ntraitor to the Union of our Fathers,—provided the candidate will\r\ngive him $100,000 in cash, with the promise of a first-class Foreign\r\nMission. There is a married woman alternately in the Metropolis and its\r\nsuburbs, to whom Bennett has long been an abject slave. And there is\r\na woman alternately in Washington and its suburbs, to whom President\r\nBuchanan himself is a Russian serf. Bennett and Buchanan, while I\r\nwrite, are in the embraces of two cunning and bewitching ladies, who\r\ncontrol the destinies of America. It was through the fascinations and\r\nmachinations of these two women, that George Law and Fernando Wood\r\nultimately fell, never to rise; and it was through these two Cleopatras\r\nthat the English and Jewish alien, Abraham D. Russell and Daniel E.\r\nSickles were elected to the Judiciary and Congress, and will be again,\r\nas long as James Buchanan, James Gordon Bennett, Judge Russell, Daniel\r\nE. Sickles, and the two lovely ladies in question rule the destinies\r\nof the White House, and meet in its gorgeous halls, and around its\r\nfestive tables. Dan Sickles could pull Buchanan’s nose with impunity,\r\nand Judge Russell could pinch Bennett’s big proboscis, and he would not\r\ndare breathe the faintest murmur. Pretty women ruled the Egyptians,\r\nGrecians, Romans, English, French, Germans, Spaniards, and Italians,\r\nand why should they not rule the Americans? Bennett’s Corporation\r\nplunder and his black mail of politicians and private citizens will\r\nappal the city and country, when I disclose his prodigious operations,\r\nand place Frederick Hudson, (his smooth Private Secretary,) and his\r\nbrother Edward W. Hudson, (the author of the _Herald_ Money Articles,)\r\nin the infamous position of their master. Bennett and Fred and Ned\r\nHudson originated the Parker Vein and Potosi villanies, through which\r\nmy brother William was reduced to beggary and ceaseless illness, for\r\nwhich I will haunt them to their capulets, and beyond, if possible.\r\nAnd now, as the _Alligator’s_ jaws are limited, they cannot hold more\r\nof Bennett’s and the two Hudsons’ carcases to-day, but he will bite\r\nthem mighty hard next week, and take larger chunks from their black\r\nmail hides, at his second lunge. And when my _Alligator’s_ fangs reach\r\nGreeley and Raymond, he will revel and grin and snap his jaws, and\r\nfatten his belly, as though he was basking on the fertile borders of\r\nthe Chagres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Years—Senator Henry B. Anthony.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was in the Providence Post Office, Henry B. Anthony was a\r\nstudent of Brown University, whose noble father resided in Coventry,\r\nand the pale and delicate Henry would descend College Hill at evening\r\nshades, and present his sweet little face at the Post Office window,\r\nand inquire in solicitous and music tones: “Good Stephen, did my dear\r\nfather or mother write me to-day?” And if I said yes, his tiny face\r\nreflected the innocent hilarity of childhood. But if I said no, he\r\nwould depart in silence, with tears careering on his brilliant and\r\nintellectual eyes. One summer evening, while in the doorway of the\r\nPost Office, we had a long political disputation. Henry was a Whig\r\nand I a Democrat. He was a Hamiltonian, and I a Jeffersonian. Samuel\r\nand Joseph Bridgham, Wm. Henry Manton, Giles Eaton, David Perkins,\r\nHalsey Creighton, Edward Hazard, Nathan F. Dixon, George Rivers, and\r\nother students of Brown University, were there, and most of them were\r\nWhigs, and opposed to Gen. Jackson, who was then President. We had a\r\nvery exciting discussion, and the students applauded as we warmed and\r\nglowed and rounded our periods; but Henry received the most applause,\r\nand I the most hisses. I endured all this with composure; but when\r\nHenry corrected my pronunciation of the military word “corps,” (kore,)\r\nwhich I pronounced like corpse, (korps,) a dead body,—he brought\r\nblushes to my cheeks, and copious blood to my brain, and the conquest\r\nwas his, and I retired into the Post Office, and studied dictionary\r\nfor some time, and resolved to acquire the principles of the English\r\nlanguage. And from that memorable evening, I have been a laborious\r\nstudent. When this same Henry B. Anthony became Governor of Rhode\r\nIsland, my father was the Senator from Providence County, which is the\r\nsecond honor of the State Administration, and the duties more arduous\r\nthan those of the Governor himself. And father has told me that Henry\r\noften consulted him during his Gubernatorial Administration. When poor\r\nfather died, I called on Henry at the _Providence Journal_ office, who\r\nreceived me with the cordiality of a brother, and said: “Stephen: My\r\nfather has recently died, and I profoundly sympathize with you, as I\r\nknow what it is to lose a good father like mine. As to your father,\r\nRhode Island never had a wiser nor a better citizen, nor a purer\r\npatriot,—and years will roll ere she will rear a man of his integrity\r\nand penetration. Our whole State is in tears, and will ever cherish\r\nhim with warm affection.” Henry was elected an American Senator last\r\nweek from Rhode Island, and here am I, with a dagger and revolver in my\r\nhand, exposing the robbers and parricides of my country, and with not\r\none truly reliable friend in all the world; and even the few dollars\r\nthat I recently received from the Corporation for public services,\r\nare in ceaseless danger through the stealth of heartless and greedy\r\nwretches, whose avarice will never be satiated until they have wrested\r\nthe very last farthing from trembling hands that are in constant\r\nperil of paralysis. And now, dear Henry, receive my most affectionate\r\ncongratulation on mounting the ladder of your highest ambition. But if\r\nyou join the plunderers and traitors of the Senate, and be recreant to\r\ntruth and justice—to Greene and Perry—to the Rhode Island Line, so\r\nfondly cherished by Washington—and to our dear native soil, and to\r\nthe loved stars of our glorious canopy, and of the long, dark, cold,\r\ndreary, and sleepless nights of the Revolution,—if you be recreant\r\nto these sacred lights of our early years, I will paralyze you with\r\nexecrations,—and if I survive you, I will trample and blight the\r\nverdure that blushes over your odious and accursed mausoleum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Patient and Doctor—The First Interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Patient_—Doctor, I have got the piles and dyspepsia most awfully.\r\nI have taken lots of medicine, and it has made me more costive, and\r\ncaused my head to ache worse than ever. Now, Doctor, what on earth\r\nshall I do to cure me of the piles and dyspepsia?\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Buy BRANCH’S ALLIGATOR.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—What kind of medicine is that?\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—It ain’t medicine. It is a pepper.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—What kind of pepper?\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—A darn funny pepper.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—How can that cure the piles and dyspepsia?\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—It will make you laugh and cry at the same time, and move\r\nyour bowels, and it actually gave one of my patients the diarrhœa and\r\nhysteric cramps in the stomach last week.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—Where can I find it?\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—At any depot in the city.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—I will try it. How much shall I pay you for your medical\r\nadvice?\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Only one dollar.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—There it is. Good day, Doctor.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Good day.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—(stumbles going down the steps)—It looks awful cloudy,\r\nDoctor.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Quite so. It looks like rain.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—Yes, rather. Good day, Doctor.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Good day. Call again.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—I will. [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND INTERVIEW.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—Good morning, Doctor.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—How do you do?\r\n\r\n_Patient_—I am so weak I can hardly stand.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—It must be owing to the warm weather.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—No it ain’t. I have been reading _Branch’s Alligator_, and\r\nI have got the dysentery so bad that I fear I shall lose my entrails\r\nand die before sundown, if you don’t give me something to stop it.\r\nWhy, lord bless your dear soul, Doctor, I was up all last night, and\r\nhave been out ten times to-day. O do relieve and save me, Doctor. Only\r\ngive me back my piles and dyspepsia again, and I’ll be satisfied. The\r\ndysentery is more dangerous than either, and I’m not prepared to die.\r\nI joined the Church at the time Awful Gardner and Ex-Alderman Wesley\r\nSmith did, but I didn’t hold on, and I am worse now than I was before\r\nI joined the Old Dutch Church in Fulton street. Do save me, Doctor, do.\r\nO do! All this trouble has come upon me, because you told me to read\r\n_Branch’s Alligator_, which made me laugh so, that my bowels got under\r\nway, and I couldn’t stop them. Do save me, dear Doctor.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Do you ever read the _Herald_, _Times_, or _Tribune_?\r\n\r\n_Patient_—No. I consider it a sin to read those papers.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Why?\r\n\r\n_Patient_—Because they lie and black mail so, and deceive and sell the\r\npeople, and plunder them, and erect such elegant buildings with their\r\nplunder. They never could make so much money by honorable industry.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Well, now, you go and buy a copy of the _Herald_, _Times_,\r\nand _Tribune_, and go home and read the editorials, and the letters of\r\ntheir Albany and Washington correspondents, and their mercenary Wall\r\nstreet money articles, and read their billingsgate of each other, and\r\ntheir horrible black mail articles, and they will so thrill your blood,\r\nas to produce an instant reaction, and you will soon be more costive\r\nthan before you read _Branch’s Alligator_.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—I’ll do it. How much shall I pay you for your advice?\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Not a cent.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—You are too generous, Doctor.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Not at all. Those editors ain’t worth a cent, only what they\r\nsteal from the government, and the politicians, and the people. They\r\ndon’t make a millionth as much on their paper and advertisements, as\r\nthey do on black mail. They are the source of all governmental evil.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—Them’s my sentiments exactly. Good morning. Doctor.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Good morning, patient. [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD INTERVIEW.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—Good evening, Doctor.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Good evening.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—Well, Doctor, the _Herald_, _Times_, and _Tribune_ have\r\ncured me. I swow, Doctor, how Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond can lie. I\r\nread their fibs, white and black, and their billingsgate of each other,\r\nand their abuse of private citizens, and contractors, and politicians,\r\n(which seemed like polite invitations for interested parties to walk\r\nup to their gilded offices and settle,) until my blood run cold, and\r\nicicles formed in my veins, and my zig-zag circulation flew about and\r\nrushed from my toes, fingers, nose, ears, heart, and liver, into my\r\nskull, until my dysentery was reduced from ten to four times a day; and\r\nthen I put ice on my head, and a poultice over my navel, and bathed my\r\nspleen with brandy, and went to bed, and slept like Rip Van Winkle, and\r\nI now feel as well as I did at my birth,—and I have come to express\r\nmy gratitude, and pay you a standing fee for disclosing the important\r\nsecret, that I can always cure the piles and dysentery by reading the\r\nabominable lies and black mail editorials of the _Herald_, _Times_, and\r\n_Tribune_.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—I am of a costive nature, and never have the piles nor\r\ndysentery, and therefore never read those disreputable newspapers; but\r\nif I ever should have the cholera, or violent diarrhœa, I should read\r\nthose public journals for my life, as I have cured dysentery patients\r\nfor years by recommending the perusal of those journals for only\r\nhalf an hour. And I shall always recommend _Branch’s Alligator_ for\r\ncostiveness.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—Don’t mention the _Alligator_, if you please, Doctor,\r\nbecause I fear it will start my bowels, and again set them in a\r\nterrible and dangerous commotion. So, good night, Doctor, and may God\r\nforever bless you.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Good night, sir.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—Remember me kindly to your wife and children, Doctor.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—I will.\r\n\r\n_Patient_—Good night.\r\n\r\n_Doctor_—Good night. [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nThe Doctor closes the door, and Patient skips up the street, singing,\r\n_a la Bayadere_:\r\n\r\n  Happy am I,\r\n  From piles I’m free,\r\n  Why are not all\r\n  Merry like me?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen H. Branch’s Alligator.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, SATURDAY, JUNE 12, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWar with Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon’t let the grannies and daddies get dangerously nervous over the\r\nbloody rumors from Washington. Drink your tea, good matrons, and take\r\nyour snuff, old gentlemen, as strong as ever, and talk as serenely\r\nand happily of other days, as though we were to have perpetual peace.\r\nThere will be no war between parent and child, so long as New York and\r\nLiverpool exist in mutual interest and brotherly affection. For these\r\ntwo cities, with their mighty commerce, are the peaceful arbiters\r\nof nations, and will be, after all who now behold the Universe have\r\nreturned to ashes, and coming generations cannot find their mortal\r\ncaverns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTremendous Display of Crinoline.\r\n\r\n[WALLACK’S THEATRE JUST OUT—A DRIZZLING RAIN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Omnibus Driver_—Broadway—ride up?\r\n\r\n_Dad_ (on sidewalk)—I say, driver, have you got room for all my family?\r\n\r\n_Driver_—How many have you got?\r\n\r\n_Dad_—Myself and two female children—two girls in their teens, and my\r\nwife and mother.\r\n\r\n_Driver_—Yes, daddy, I can accommodate you, as I have just got room\r\nfor yourself, old boy, and your two female children, and two kegs, and\r\nyour two girls in their teens, and two barrels, and for your wife and\r\nmother, and two hogsheads. Jump in, old cock, with all your tribes and\r\ntrappings.\r\n\r\n_Dad_—Thank you, driver, thank you,—but darn your impudent\r\nreflections about crinoline. But it rains, and I’m anxious to get home,\r\nand I’ll forgive your facetious comments this time. There, now, get in\r\nwife, and mother, and girls, and children—get in as fast as possible,\r\nand get out of the rain, and save your bonnets, and shawls, and silks,\r\nand kegs, barrels, and hogsheads, that our waggish driver prates of\r\nwith such truthful severity.\r\n\r\n_Driver_ (peeping through the hole)—Are you all right inside, daddy?\r\nCrinoline all nicely arranged and tucked in? eh? old cock?\r\n\r\n_Dad_—Go ahead, you rascal. I’ll tell Mayor Tiemann and Peter Cooper\r\nof your didos, and have you arrested.\r\n\r\n_Driver_—Laughs, and snaps his whip, and away they go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Queer Letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK, May 28th, 1858.\r\n\r\n  STEPHEN H. BRANCH, ESQ.—\r\n\r\n _Dear Sir_,—As a reader of your rapacious ALLIGATOR, and a warm\r\n sympathiser with you throughout your misfortunes, I think I am\r\n entitled to make a suggestion, which I believe to be for your own\r\n good. I want to praise the manner in which you have conducted\r\n your Journal thus far, and it is because I do not, wish to see it\r\n unworthy of consideration that I have taken the liberty to write to\r\n you—a perfect stranger, as far as personal acquaintance goes. Your\r\n sanguinary and characteristic fearless attacks on the magnates of\r\n Tammany and the City Hall have won you great favor among the honest\r\n and peaceful citizens of New York, as well as elsewhere, but I am of\r\n opinion that an attack on the city press would only be productive of\r\n serious mischief to yourself. In your latest number, you mention the\r\n apparent slight of the ALLIGATOR by Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond,\r\n and avow your intention to “let up” on them in your next. I seriously\r\n advise you not to do it. It will hurt you. Only a week since you spoke\r\n of your unwillingness to attack and expose Russell, because he is\r\n Bennett’s friend, _who aided you in your misfortunes_. It may hurt the\r\n man’s feelings somewhat to see his friends or relations calumniated\r\n or condemned, but it is much worse (and savors of ingratitude in the\r\n assailant) to be set upon himself. Besides, if you wake the wrath of\r\n these three Leviathans, it will take a bigger and stronger animal than\r\n the ALLIGATOR to extinguish it. It is therefore a matter of policy in\r\n you not to weaken yourself by entering into a war with the _Herald_,\r\n _Times_, or _Tribune_. You are yet weak, and need all the help you can\r\n possibly obtain. You know yourself that newspapers are not established\r\n in a day, however high their aim or select their contributions, and\r\n to be drawn into a controversy with the papers named, will be almost\r\n fatal to your editorial prospects.\r\n\r\n Again: they may have reasons for not noticing your paper, as a press\r\n of business, neglect, overlooking, and so forth, and may, when a more\r\n convenient season presents itself, give you a highly flavored puff.\r\n Would it not be better to ask them privately to speak favorably of\r\n your new enterprise, than to attempt to force them to do it by a\r\n public attack in your paper?\r\n\r\n Yours very respectfully, and with sincere wishes for your welfare,\r\n\r\n  R. P. C.\r\n\r\n (Private.)\r\n\r\nThis letter came from the _Herald_, _Times_, and _Tribune_ offices, and\r\nwas the result of the deliberations of Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond,\r\nthrough their Secretaries, Hudson, Dana, and Tuthill. My heart was\r\nmoved while reading this production. The genial spirits of Houston and\r\nHamilton, of the _Herald_, and of the equally meritorious dead in the\r\n_Times_ and _Tribune_ establishments, passed before my vision, and I\r\nwas unmanly, and wept like a delicate female. And with electric flights\r\nof the imagination, I grasped the long and happy years I have passed in\r\nthe _Herald_, _Times_, and _Tribune_ offices, in the pleasing effort to\r\nimprove the Fire and Police Departments. I thought, too, of the noble\r\nband of intellectual living giants connected with the Metropolitan\r\nPress in question, and I wept to know that we would be less friendly,\r\nand that my form and intellect were never more to be reflected by the\r\nleading Press of America. And why must this be so? Why must I pass\r\nin silence, in my whole journey to the grave, such men as Bennett,\r\nGreeley, and Raymond, and their Secretaries, Hudson, Dana, and Tuthill?\r\nIs it because they have not noticed the ALLIGATOR? I would despise\r\nmyself, if I could be governed by so mean a motive. A spark will light\r\na flame that will defy a million men. Isolated snow will come silently\r\nfrom Heaven, and form mountains that will bury thousands. And I admit\r\nthat after my gratuitous labors in the _Herald_, _Times_, and _Tribune_\r\nestablishments for so many years, (in which I devoted the integrity and\r\neducation that my father gave me,) the refusal of Bennett, Greeley,\r\nand Raymond to notice my feeble efforts to establish a truthful press,\r\nkindled a blaze in my bosom that they can never quench. For seven\r\nweeks I looked with solicitude for the mention of my Journal in\r\ntheir columns, and crushed to the earth with pain and disgust with my\r\nspecies, I resolved to dissect the bodies that were animated by such\r\ncontracted souls. Their refusal to notice and encourage the efforts of\r\nan old and tried friend like me, (who has toiled so long and hard to\r\ngive them important public documents and early valuable domestic and\r\nforeign intelligence,) aroused a million demons that have slumbered\r\nin my bosom, and yearned for years to expose the villainy of American\r\neditors, who hold the destinies of my country and of human liberty in\r\ntheir palms, and who trifle and play with the people, and sell them\r\nlike cattle in the face of the morning sun. Bennett, Greeley, and\r\nRaymond never meet by daylight, but they do by night light in great\r\nemergencies. They fret and scold before the people, but they act in\r\nconcert in subterranean caverns. And their Secretaries, Hudson, Dana,\r\nand Tuthill, daily walk arm-in-arm, plotting deeds of hell for their\r\nwicked masters, in which the people are invariably sold. And so with\r\nthe money-article writers of these public journals. They see each\r\nother often, and act in concert, and spread terror in Wall street,\r\nand throughout the country, and desolate the hearth of many a happy\r\ndomestic circle, in the journey of every sun. And shall I be silent,\r\nand go down to my grave, with these fatal secrets on my heart, that\r\nhave depressed me for years? Shall I be recreant to my mission, and to\r\nthe toiling millions, on whom their accursed treason falls? Shall I not\r\ntell the American people, that the evils and corruption that overshadow\r\nour land, and threaten to subvert our glorious institutions, have their\r\nsource in the American Press? And shall I not adduce my proof and\r\nargument, and scathing analysis of their pernicious motives? And shall\r\nI be silenced by the threats in this letter, that I will be crushed by\r\nthree Leviathans the instant I open my fatal batteries? No, no. All\r\nhell shall not deter me from my exposition of Bennett, Greeley, and\r\nRaymond, and their vile Secretaries. For my honor I care every thing,\r\nand he who strives to deprive me of it, through unmerited detraction,\r\nshall die by my avenging hand. But for life I care nothing, only to be\r\nuseful to my kind, and to adhere to integrity, and serve the God of my\r\nsupreme adoration. Life! Take it! Take the poor, trembling, pining,\r\nmortal trunk and scabbard, but beware of the sword and soul! Look, but\r\ntouch not them, lest the ground rock, and open, and yawn, and swallow,\r\nand cut, and dash, and burn your demon bones and nerves through undying\r\nages. Beware! I say! O beware! and tremble! For I have a superstition,\r\nthat a soul is sacred in the eyes of God, according to its love of\r\ntruth, or its hatred and horror of such hypocrites, thieves, and\r\ntraitors, as Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1857, by\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN H.

Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news of my return to Providence spread rapidly, and the political\r\nnewspapers unfriendly to father most cruelly announced my arrival in\r\nblazing capitals. I then told my father that if he would furnish me\r\nthe means, I would go to the sea shore, and he instantly complied. I\r\ndeparted for Boston with White, whose father resided in Pepperell,\r\nMassachusetts, whither he went, and I took the stage to Salem and\r\nGloucester, near Cape Ann. When I parted with White, I was overwhelmed\r\nwith tears and desolation. I passed the first night in Gloucester\r\nat a hotel, and the next day engaged private board. I now was\r\nvery lonely,—had no congenial spirit by my side,—knew no one in\r\nGloucester,—was a mere skeleton,—could not read nor compose, without\r\nsuffusing my brain with blood, and I sometimes thought I should drop\r\ndead, and seriously contemplated self-destruction. But the ocean air\r\nrevived me, and I gave lessons in penmanship to a Mr. Story and his two\r\nsons, who gave me $5 a week, which defrayed my expenses, and diverted\r\nmy mind from the melancholy past, which was a precious solace. The\r\nsummer closed, and the leaves began to fall, and the first blast of\r\nautumn made its advent from the north, and I returned to Boston, and\r\nwent to New York by way of Hartford and New Haven. I engaged board with\r\nMrs. Reeve, in Pearl street, near Franklin Square, and hired a cheap\r\npiano of Firth, Hall, & Pond, and gave English lessons to the son of\r\nMr. Vultee, for which he imparted musical instruction. I then went to\r\nArthur Tappan, and informed him that I contemplated the instruction\r\nof colored persons, who sent me to his brother, Lewis Tappan, with\r\nwhom I had a long conversation, at his store in Pearl street, during\r\nwhich he examined my qualifications in spelling, reading, figures,\r\nand penmanship, and gave me a letter of introduction to a colored man\r\nnamed Van Ransselaer, who kept a restaurant under the office of the\r\n_Journal of Commerce_. I taught Mr. and Mrs. Van Ransselaer and their\r\nadopted boy for some weeks, for which I received my meals at their\r\nrestaurant. They had a room in the sixth story of one of the Wall\r\nstreet buildings, and, in climbing the stairs, I often thought I should\r\ndie before I reached the upper story. I now see an advertisement, and\r\nobtain a situation as teacher on the plantation of Mr. Bennett, near\r\nFranklin, Alabama, and departed for Apalachicola, in the brig Sampson,\r\nCaptain Robinson. The passengers could scarcely move in consequence\r\nof the barrels of potatoes and apples on deck. We paid our passage in\r\nadvance. The proprietors of the vessel allowed the captain a limited\r\nsum for sailors, and, to save a portion of the money for himself, the\r\ncaptain obtained most of his sailors from the hospital, from those\r\njust recovering from protracted illness. One was lame, and another had\r\nbut one eye, and all were pale and extremely feeble. We had a gale off\r\nCape Hatteras, and some of the more emaciated sailors were instantly\r\nprostrated, and retired to their berths, and the passengers had to\r\nwork night and day, or go to the bottom of the ocean. In a week after\r\nI left New York, my hands were nearly raw with blisters from hauling\r\nropes. The owners permitted the captain to provision the vessel as he\r\npleased, and render his account to them at the close of the voyage,\r\nand he nearly starved us, although he charged the proprietors of the\r\nvessel for the best provisions the market afforded. I often caught the\r\ncaptain drinking wines and eating luxuries behind the masts, which the\r\npassengers should have had, and I denounced him, but to no purpose. I\r\ndiscovered the helmsman asleep at midnight, and the vessel going stern\r\nforemost, and aroused the passengers just in time to save all from a\r\nwatery grave. There was a passenger who had been a skilful mariner,\r\nand we acted in concert, or we must have been lost. We watched the\r\nhelmsman on alternate nights, but got weary of the task, and shared\r\nthe toil with other passengers. I emerged from my berth at midnight,\r\nand found both passenger and helmsman asleep, when I aroused all hands\r\nto witness the extraordinary spectacle, and our common peril, and,\r\nafter that, the passengers formed a Vigilance Committee to unceasingly\r\nwatch the captain and sailors. In a week, land was discovered, although\r\nthe captain assured us one hour before the discovery, that we were\r\nabout one hundred miles from land. It was near sunset, and if we had\r\nnot discovered land before dark, we would have gone ashore, and been\r\ndrowned, or butchered by the hostile Indians on the coast of Florida,\r\nwho were then engaged in their final struggle with the Americans. We\r\nhad a hurricane soon afterwards, and lost all the apples and potatoes\r\nfrom the deck, but we at last arrived at Key West. We took in water,\r\nand some bread and herrings, and steered for Apalachicola, and on the\r\nfollowing day, we took four men from a vessel that must have sunk in\r\none hour after we rescued them. The poor fellows had been several\r\ndays on the wreck, without food or water, and they shivered and cried\r\nlike children, when they reached our vessel. It was a very affecting\r\nscene, and none could restrain their tears. We had a gale in the\r\nGulf of Mexico, and expected to be lost, but we ultimately reached\r\nApalachicola, which I found a perfect desert. My employer, and a wagon\r\nwith two horses, anticipated my arrival, and we went to Saint Joseph,\r\nand thence up the banks of the Chattahoochee River, and often passed\r\nnear the encampment of hostile tribes of Indians. There had been no\r\nrain for two months, and the woods were on fire at times throughout\r\nthe journey, which presented at night a scene of great sublimity. We\r\nwere often surrounded by smoke and flame, and were scorched and nearly\r\nstrangled by the dense smoke that emanated from the burning pine trees.\r\nOn one occasion, the horses were unmanageable, and ran towards the\r\nflames, and we supposed we would be lost, but we subdued the terror\r\nof the horses, and emerged from the flames after infinite peril and\r\ntrouble. The miserable habitations were often thirty miles apart, and\r\nwe nearly died from thirst, but we reached Franklin, Alabama, after\r\nunexampled suffering. I soon repaired to Bennett’s Plantation, five\r\nmiles from Franklin, and opened my school, near his house, in a log\r\ncabin, to which Bennett permitted children to come from the surrounding\r\ncountry. My health was poor, and I nearly died with dyspepsia. I soon\r\ndiscovered that Bennett was intemperate and cruel to his slaves, most\r\nof whom had committed grave offences, and had been confined in the\r\nprisons of Georgia and Alabama. Bennett’s Overseer whipped the slaves\r\nevery morning, and my feelings were lacerated almost beyond endurance,\r\nwhen I heard the lash, and their piercing cries for mercy. Mike, a\r\nslave, fled in the night, and Bennett and the Overseer pursued and\r\ncaptured him partially drunk in a swamp. They tied him to a tree,\r\nnear my window, and paddled him with a wooden spade full of holes,\r\nwhich brought blood and blisters at every blow. I had witnessed the\r\nexecutions of murderers at the North, but I never beheld brutality like\r\nthis. I closed my window, and went to bed, and buried myself in the\r\nclothes, so that I could not hear the blows, and poor Mike’s thrilling\r\nappeals for succor. Chloe, a slave from Africa, (who was seventy years\r\nold, and had been the slave of Bennett’s father,) told a lie to screen\r\none of her children, who had been absent two nights on a drunken\r\nfrolic, and she was tied to a tree, and severely horsewhipped on her\r\nnaked back. I shall never forget the moans of poor Chloe, as the whip\r\nlacerated her scanty flesh, and aged bones. Mrs. Bennett taught her\r\nchildren, male and female, to whip the children slaves, and when they\r\ndid not strike hard, she would fly into a fearful passion, and lash\r\nher own children for their lenity towards the sinless little slaves.\r\nThese cruel scenes disgusted and harrowed my heart beyond the power of\r\nlanguage to express, and I resolved to resort to honorable stratagem to\r\nget away from Bennett’s Plantation. So, on Bennett’s return from his\r\nfavorite amusement of hunting deer at night, with which the country\r\nteemed, he was very proud of his success in killing deer, and was\r\npartially intoxicated, and in sparkling humor, and I breathed in his\r\nmerry ears the following plaintive intelligence. I told him that I\r\nwas ill, and anticipated a return of fits, which sometimes tormented\r\nme for months,—that, at times, when I emerged from these fits, I was\r\nwild and dangerous, unless confined in irons, and that I once nearly\r\nstrangled a child, during my delirium. He started back, and stared like\r\nan owl, and his wife opened her mouth, and stretched her large gray\r\neyes prodigiously, and asked me how long I had had symptoms of the\r\nreturn of fits. I said, about two days. Bennett then inquired about\r\nhow long before I expected they would commence. I replied, in a day or\r\ntwo. He asked me if I desired to return to Apalachicola, and thence\r\nto New York, or would rather go by way of Columbus, Georgia. I told\r\nhim that I had a brother in New Orleans, who was proprietor of the\r\n“_New Orleans Daily Times_,” and I would like to go to him, as he knew\r\nhow to nurse me, when the fits were on. He said that he would let his\r\nslave Edward take me in his wagon down the banks of the Chattahoochee,\r\nto the point where the mail stage passed, on its way to Lagrange,\r\nwhere I could get a steamer to Pensacola, and thence to Mobile and\r\nNew Orleans. I told him that I had no money. He said he would supply\r\nme with enough to defray my expenses to New Orleans. In the morning,\r\nwhile the Overseer was whipping slaves in the yard, I started down the\r\nChattahoochee, and, after an encampment of three nights, reached the\r\nroad that led to Lagrange. On the following day, the stage arrived,\r\nand I left for Lagrange. General James Hamilton, of South Carolina,\r\nwas a passenger, with whom I had many a pleasant conversation. After a\r\ntedious journey through the piny solitudes of Florida, we arrived at\r\nLagrange, and left for Pensacola, in a ricketty steamer, in which we\r\ncame near being lost in the Gulf of Mexico, in about half a gale. At\r\nPensacola, we took the steamer Champion, and proceeded to Mobile, and\r\nthence to New Orleans, by way of Lake Pontchartrain. I boarded with my\r\nbrother Albert in Poydras street, and worked in his printing office. I\r\nlearned, through the newspapers, that the Captain left Apalachicola for\r\nHavana, but couldn’t find it, and went to Key West—that he left for\r\nNew York, and was capsized in the Atlantic ocean, and only the second\r\nmate was saved, who stated in substance that “six of us were on a raft\r\nfor nine days, and, after we ate the dog, we drew lots for each other,\r\nand that he who drew the shortest piece of shirt from my inclosed hand,\r\nshould die, but have the privilege of resisting the other five in their\r\nattempted slaughter of his body for his blood and flesh as their water\r\nand food,—that a Hungarian passenger drew the shortest cut, and fought\r\nfor his life for two hours, on the raft, which was the roof of the deck\r\ncabin, and very large, and could hold twenty men with safety,—that the\r\nHungarian at last fell asleep at midnight, against his will, and we cut\r\nhis head entirely off, and drank his blood, and ate his flesh, and I\r\nnever relished any food like the Hungarian’s,—that on the tenth day,\r\nthe first mate died from eating too heartily of the Hungarian, and on\r\nthe eleventh day a passenger and sailor died from exhaustion,—that on\r\nthe twelfth day a vessel came near, and while on a mountain wave just\r\nover my head, the cook discovered myself and the last sailor down in\r\nthe cavern of the ocean,—the cook screamed,—the helmsman discovered\r\nus,—a rope was cast, and I seized it, and tied it around me,—another\r\nis thrown,—I tied it around my comrade, and gave the signal to hoist\r\naway, and up we went into the vessel, but, alas! my sailor boy was\r\ndead, dying from exhaustion and excessive joy at his too sudden and\r\nunexpected rescue!” This melancholy news cast a profound gloom over\r\nmy meditations for several weeks. I now see an advertisement for a\r\nteacher in Napoleonville, on Bayou Lafourche, about twenty miles from\r\nDonaldsonville, and seventy-five miles west of New Orleans, on the\r\nplantation of Thomas Pugh, who was a classmate of President Polk, the\r\nReverend Doctor Hawks, and the Reverend Doctor Thomas House Taylor,\r\nof Grace Church, and other distinguished men, at Chapel Hill, North\r\nCarolina. Albert C. Ainsworth and Senator Conrad, of New Orleans, gave\r\nme letters to Mr. Pugh, which secured the situation. Mr. Pugh was a\r\nMember of the Legislature, and so was Mr. Conrad. Mr. Ainsworth was a\r\nnative of Providence, Rhode Island, and an old school mate of mine,\r\nwhose father was a school master. Mr. Pugh had about two hundred slaves\r\non his sugar and cotton plantations, and his brother, just below him,\r\non the Bayou, had a thousand slaves. I found Mr. Thomas Pugh to be a\r\nnoble character, and very kind to his slaves, who most fondly loved\r\nhim. I had a school house in the centre of a beautiful field, to which\r\ncame the pretty children of Mr. Pugh, and about a dozen others from\r\nthe contiguous plantations. I had six hundred dollars per annum, and a\r\nhorse to ride when I chose, and a slave named Nathan to wait upon me.\r\nThe country teemed with poultry, and we had the most delicious oysters,\r\nand all the choice fruits and vegetables of those sunny and prolific\r\nlatitudes. I was thrown from my horse one moonlight evening, while\r\nriding along the Bayou, and soon after was bitten by a snake, and in\r\nabout a week found a lizzard in my bed when I awoke in the morning, and\r\nI got uneasy and very nervous, and left Mr. Pugh and his interesting\r\nfamily with tearful sorrow, because they had treated me with parental\r\nkindness. I returned to New Orleans, and engaged passage in a steamer\r\nfor Louisville, Kentucky.\r\n\r\n (To be continued to our last dream.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertisements—25 Cents a line.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit—From two to four seconds, or as long as the Advertiser can hold\r\nhis breath!
