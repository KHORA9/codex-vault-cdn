Thwaites, in his \"France in America,\" shows how\r\nthe French opened up the country and prepared the way; the Tennessee\r\nand Kentucky settlements are described in Howard's \"Preliminaries of\r\nthe Revolution\"; Van Tyne's \"American Revolution\" goes into the\r\nearliest western governments; McLaughlin's \"Confederation and\r\nConstitution\" deals with the organization of the new communities by\r\nCongress; Bassett's \"Federalist System\" and Channing's \"Jeffersonian\r\nSystem\" show how the diplomacy and politics of the country were\r\naffected by the appearance of a new group of equal states; while\r\nBabcock's \"Rise of American Nationality\" carries the influence of\r\nthose states into a broader national life. Professor Turner takes up\r\nthe west as an integral part of the Union, with a self-consciousness\r\nas lively as that of the east or south, with its own aims and\r\nprejudices, but a partner in the councils and the benefits of the\r\nnational government which, as a whole, it is the aim of this volume\r\nto describe.\r\n\r\nIn a way the west is simply a broader east, for up to the end of the\r\nperiod covered by this volume most of the grown men and women in the\r\nwest came across the mountains to found new homes--the New-Englander\r\nin western New York; the Pennsylvanian diverging westward and\r\nsouthwestward; the Virginian in Kentucky; the North-Carolinian in\r\nTennessee and Missouri and, along with the South-Carolinian and\r\nGeorgian, in the new southwestern states; while north of the Ohio\r\nRiver the principal element up to 1830 was southern.\r\n\r\nTo describe such a movement and its effects, Professor Turner has\r\nthe advantage to be a descendant of New-Yorkers, of New England\r\nstock, but native to the west, and living alongside the most\r\ncomplete collection of materials upon the west which has ever been\r\nbrought together--the Library of the Wisconsin State Historical\r\nSociety. His point of view is that the west and east were always\r\ninterdependent, and that the rising power of the western states in\r\nnational affairs was a wholesome and natural outcome of forces at\r\nwork for half a century. The transformation of the west from a rude\r\nand boisterous frontier to a group of states, soon rivaling their\r\nparent communities in population and wealth, was not unlike the\r\nprocess through which Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and Virginia\r\npassed as colonies, except that the inland people accepted ideals\r\nand standards originally English, but worked out and put into shape\r\nby their colonist fathers.\r\n\r\nAs the volume treats of the nation, and not simply of any section,\r\nit contains three chapters (i., ii., iii.) on the social and\r\npolitical life in New England, the middle region, and the south. The\r\nnext four chapters are a systematic account of the west as the\r\nsettler and the traveler saw it. between 1820 and 1830. In chapter\r\nv., on Colonization, the settlers are traced from their old homes to\r\ntheir new ones by road and river. Chapter vi., off Social and\r\nEconomic Development, is a picture of frontier life in the forest\r\nand on the farm; chapter vii. brings into relief the need of a\r\nmarket and the difficulty of reaching tide-water with western\r\nproducts--a subject taken up again in the two later chapters on\r\ninternal improvements; chapter viii., on The Far West, goes with the\r\ntrapper into the mountains and then across the continent to\r\nCalifornia and to Oregon, which were included in the ambitions of\r\nthe buoyant westerner.\r\n\r\nChapters ix. to xi. are a narrative of a succession of national\r\nquestions involving all sections--the commercial crisis of 1819; the\r\nMissouri Compromise, which was in good part a western question; and\r\nthe slow recrystallization of political parties after 1820. Chapter\r\nxii. is on the Monroe Doctrine, which included eastern questions of\r\ncommerce, southern questions of nearness to Cuba, and western\r\nquestions of Latin-American neighbors. Chapters xiii. and xvii.\r\ndescribe the efforts by internal improvements to help all the\r\nstates, and especially to bind the eastern and western groups\r\ntogether by the Cumberland Road and by canals. Chapters xiv. to xvi.\r\ntake up the tariff of 1824, the presidential election of that year,\r\nand its political results. Chapter xviii. brings into clear light\r\nthe causes for the reaction from the ardent nationalism described in\r\nBabcock's American Nationality. With chapter xix., on the tariff of\r\n1828 and the South Carolina protest, the narrative part of the\r\nvolume closes. The Critical Essay on Authorities and a wealth of\r\nfoot-notes carry the reader back to materials little studied\r\nhitherto, and prepare the way for many detailed investigations.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the volume is not to show the Rise of the New West as\r\nthough it were a separate story, but to show how the nation found\r\nitself in the midst of questions involving the west, and how all\r\nparts of the Union were enriched and stimulated by the appearance of\r\na new section. It opens up new vistas of historical study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE\r\n\r\nIn the present volume I have kept before myself the importance of\r\nregarding American development as the outcome of economic and social\r\nas well as political forces. To make plain the attitude and\r\ninfluence of New England, the middle region, the south, and the\r\nwest, and of the public men who reflected the changing conditions of\r\nthose sections in the period under consideration, has been my\r\nprincipal purpose.\r\n\r\nThe limits of the volume have prevented the elaboration of some\r\npoints well worthy of fuller treatment; and, by the plan of the\r\nseries, certain aspects of the period have been reserved for other\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nI desire to express my cordial appreciation of the friendly\r\ncriticism and assistance I have received from the editor, Professor\r\nHart. To Professor Carl R. Fish, Professor A. A. Young, and Dr. U.\r\nB. Phillips, my colleagues, I am indebted for a critical reading of\r\nseveral chapters. I have drawn on the manuscript sources possessed\r\nby Dr. Phillips for information on many points of southern history.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the topics dealt with in the volume have been\r\ninvestigated by graduate students in my seminary; particularly I\r\nhave profited by the papers of Professor Homer C. Hockett on the\r\nMissouri Compromise and the rise of Jacksonian democracy; of Mr.\r\nRoyal B. Way, now instructor in history in Northwestern University,\r\non internal improvements; and of Dr. W. V. Pooley and Mr. A. C.\r\nBoggess on the settlement of Illinois. Mr. S. J. Buck, my assistant\r\nin American history, prepared under my direction some of the maps,\r\nparticularly those of congressional votes.\r\n\r\nThe map of western fur-trading posts in Captain Chittenden's\r\nexcellent History of the American Fur Trade furnished the basis for\r\nthe map of western posts and trails. In the construction of the map\r\nof highways and waterways, I have used the map of H. S. Tanner,\r\n1825, and Hewett's American Traveller (Washington, 1825). From the\r\nmaps in the Eighteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology have\r\nbeen drawn the data for the map of Indian cessions. The editor\r\nkindly supplied the map of Russian settlements and claims.\r\n\r\nFor the portrait of Henry Clay, which forms the frontispiece, thanks\r\nare due to Mr. Charles Henry Hart, of Philadelphia, the owner of the\r\nlife-mask made by J. H. Browere.\r\n\r\nFREDERICK J. TURNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRISE OF THE NEW WEST\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nNATIONALISM AND SECTIONALISM (1815-1830)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the United States is the history of a growing nation.\r\nEvery period of its life is a transitional period, but that from the\r\nclose of the War of 1812 to the election of Andrew Jackson was\r\npeculiarly one of readjustment. It was during this time that the new\r\nrepublic gave clear evidence that it was throwing off the last\r\nremnants of colonial dependence. The Revolution had not fully\r\nsevered the United States from the European state system; but now\r\nthe United States attained complete independence and asserted its\r\npredominance in the western continent. It was in this period that\r\nthe nation strengthened its hold on the Gulf of Mexico by the\r\nacquisition of Florida, recognized the independence of the revolting\r\nSpanish-American colonies, and took the leadership of the free\r\nsisterhood of the New World under the terms of the Monroe Doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe joyous outburst of nationalism which at first succeeded the\r\ndissensions of the period of war revealed itself in measures passed\r\nin Congress, under the leadership of Calhoun and Clay; it spoke\r\nclearly in the decisions of Judge Marshall; and in the lofty tone of\r\ncondemnation with which the country as a whole reproached New\r\nEngland for the sectionalism exhibited in the Hartford Convention.\r\n[Footnote: Babcock, Am. Nationality (Am. Nation, XIII.), chaps, ix.,\r\nxviii.; Gallatin, Writings, I., 700.]\r\n\r\nIt was not only in the field of foreign relations, in an aroused\r\nnational sentiment, and in a realization that the future of the\r\ncountry lay in the development of its own resources that America\r\ngave evidence of fundamental change. In the industrial field\r\ntransportation was revolutionized by the introduction of the\r\nsteamboat and by the development of canals and turnpikes. The\r\nfactory system, nourished by the restrictions of the embargo and the\r\nwar, rapidly developed until American manufactures became an\r\ninterest which, in political importance, outweighed the old\r\nindustries of shipping and foreign commerce. The expansion of\r\ncotton-planting transformed the energies of the south, extended her\r\nactivity into the newer regions of the Gulf, and gave a new life to\r\nthe decaying institution of slavery.\r\n\r\nFrom all the older sections, but especially from the south and its\r\ncolonies in Kentucky and Tennessee, a flood of colonists was\r\nspreading along the waters of the west. In the Mississippi Valley\r\nthe forests were falling before the blows of the pioneers, cities\r\nwere developing where clearings had just let in the light of day,\r\nand new commonwealths were seeking outlets for their surplus and\r\nrising to industrial and political power. It is this vast\r\ndevelopment of the internal resources of the United States, the\r\n\"Rise of the New West,\" that gives the tone to the period. \"The\r\npeace,\" wrote Webster in later years, \"brought about an entirely new\r\nand a most interesting state of things; it opened to us other\r\nprospects and suggested other duties. We ourselves were changed, and\r\nthe whole world was changed. . . . Other nations would produce for\r\nthemselves, and carry for themselves, and manufacture for\r\nthemselves, to the full extent of their abilities. The crops of our\r\nplains would no longer sustain European armies, nor our ships longer\r\nsupply those whom war had rendered unable to supply themselves. It\r\nwas obvious, that, under these circumstances, the country would\r\nbegin to survey itself, and to estimate its own capacity of\r\nimprovement.\" [Footnote: Webster, Writings (National ed.), VI., 28.]\r\n\r\nThese very forces of economic transformation were soon followed by a\r\ndistinct reaction against the spirit of nationalism and\r\nconsolidation which had flamed out at the close of the War of 1812.\r\nThis was shown, not only in protests against the loose-construction\r\ntendencies of Congress, and in denunciations of the decisions of the\r\ngreat chief-justice, but more significantly in the tendency of the\r\nseparate geographical divisions of the country to follow their own\r\ninterests and to make combinations with one another on this basis.\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view the United States, even in this day of its\r\nyouth, was more like an empire than a nation. Sectionalism had been\r\nfundamental in American history before the period which we have\r\nreached. The vast physiographic provinces of the country formed the\r\nbasis for the development of natural economic and social areas,\r\ncomparable in their size, industrial resources, and spirit, to\r\nnations of the Old World. In our period these sections underwent\r\nstriking transformations, and engaged, under new conditions, in the\r\nold struggle for power. Their leaders, changing their attitude\r\ntowards public questions as the economic conditions of their\r\nsections changed, were obliged not only to adjust themselves to the\r\ninterests of the sections which they represented, but also, if they\r\nwould achieve a national career, to make effective combinations with\r\nother sections. [Footnote: Turner. \"Problems of American History,\"\r\nin Congress of Arts and Sciences, St. Louis, II.]\r\n\r\nThis gives the clew to the decade. Underneath the superficial calm\r\nof the \"Era of Good Feeling,\" and in contradiction to the apparent\r\nabsorption of all parties into one, there were arising new issues,\r\nnew party formations, and some of the most profound changes in the\r\nhistory of American evolution.\r\n\r\nThe men of the time were not unaware of these tendencies. Writing in\r\n1823, Henry Clay declared that it was a just principle to inquire\r\nwhat great interests belong to each section of our country, and to\r\npromote those interests, as far as practicable, consistently with\r\nthe Constitution, having always an eye to the welfare of the whole.\r\n\"Assuming this principle,\" said he, \"does any one doubt that if New\r\nYork, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and the Western\r\nStates constituted an independent nation, it would immediately\r\nprotect the important interests in question? And is it not to be\r\nfeared that, if protection is not to be found for vital interests,\r\nfrom the existing systems, in great parts of the confederacy, those\r\nparts will ultimately seek to establish a system that will afford\r\nthe requisite protection?\" [Footnote: Clay, Works, IV., 81, 82;\r\nAnnals of Cong., 18 Cong., 1 Sess., II., 1997, 2423.]\r\n\r\nWhile the most prominent western statesman thus expressed his\r\nconviction that national affairs were to be conducted through\r\ncombinations between sections on the basis of peculiar interests,\r\nCalhoun, at first a nationalist, later the leader of the south,\r\nchanged his policy to a similar system of adjustments between the\r\nrival sections. John Quincy Adams, in 1819, said of Calhoun: \"he is\r\nabove all sectional and factious prejudices more than any other\r\nstatesman of this union with whom I have ever acted.\" [Footnote:\r\nAdams, Memoirs, V., 361, VI., 75.] But Calhoun, by the close of the\r\ndecade, was not only complaining that the protective policy of\r\ncertain sections set a dangerous example \"of separate\r\nrepresentation, and association of great Geographical interests to\r\npromote their prosperity at the expense of other interests,\" but he\r\nwas also convinced that a great defect in our system was that the\r\nseparate geographical interests were not sufficiently guarded.\r\n[Footnote: Am. Hist. Assoc., Report 1899, II., 250.] Speaking, in\r\n1831, of the three great interests of the nation--the north, the\r\nsouth, and the west--he declared that they had been struggling in a\r\nfierce war with one another, and that the period was approaching\r\nwhich was to determine whether they could be reconciled or not so as\r\nto perpetuate the Union. [Footnote: Am. Hist. Rev., VI., 742; cf.\r\nJ.Q. Adams, in Richardson, Messages and Papers. II., 297; J. Taylor,\r\nNew Views, 261; [Turnbull]. The Crisis, No. 2.]\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that, in the minds of some of the most\r\nenlightened statesmen of this decade, American politics were\r\nessentially a struggle for power between rival sections. Even those\r\nof most enlarged national sympathies and purposes accepted the fact\r\nof sectional rivalries and combinations as fundamental in their\r\npolicies. To understand the period, we must begin with a survey of\r\nthe separate sections in the decade from 1820 to 1830, and determine\r\nwhat were the main interests shown in each and impressed upon the\r\nleaders who represented them. For the purposes of such a survey, the\r\nconventional division into New England, middle region, south, and\r\nwest may be adopted. It is true that within each of these sections\r\nthere were areas which were so different as to constitute almost\r\nindependent divisions, and which had close affiliations with other\r\nsections. Nevertheless, the conventional grouping will reveal\r\nfundamental and contrasted interests and types of life between the\r\nvarious sections. In the rivalries of their leaders these sectional\r\ndifferences found political expression. By first presenting a\r\nnarrative of forces in the separate sections, the narrative of\r\nevents in the nation will be better understood.\r\n\r\nA sectional survey, however, cannot fully exhibit one profound\r\nchange, not easy to depict except by its results. This was the\r\nformation of the self-conscious American democracy, strongest in the\r\nwest and middle region, but running across all sections and tending\r\nto divide the people on the lines of social classes. This democracy\r\ncame to its own when Andrew Jackson triumphed over the old order of\r\nthings and rudely threw open the sanctuary of federal government to\r\nthe populace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nNEW ENGLAND (1820-1830)\r\n\r\n\r\nBy geographical position, the land of the Puritans was devoted to\r\nprovincialism. While other sections merged into one another and even\r\nhad a west in their own midst, New England was obliged to cross\r\npopulous states in order to reach the regions into which national\r\nlife was expanding; and her sons who migrated found themselves under\r\nconditions that weakened their old affiliations and linked their\r\nfortunes with the section which they entered. The ocean had\r\ndominated New England's interests and connected her with the Old\r\nWorld; the fisheries and carrying--trade had engrossed her attention\r\nuntil the embargo and the War of 1812 gave importance to her\r\nmanufactures. In spirit, also, New England was a section apart, The\r\nimpress of Puritanism was still strong upon her, and the unity of\r\nher moral life was exceptional. Moreover, up to the beginning of the\r\ndecade with which we have to deal, New England had a population of\r\nalmost unmixed English origin, contrasting sharply, in this respect,\r\nwith the other sections. [Footnote: For the characteristics of New\r\nEngland in colonial times, see Tyler, England in America, chaps,\r\nxviii., xix.; Andrews, Colonial Self-Government, chaps, xviii.,\r\nxix.; Greene, Provincial America, chaps, xii., xiii., xvi.-xviii.;\r\nBassett, Federalist System, chaps, xi., xiii. (Am. Nation, IV., V.,\r\nVI., XI.)].\r\n\r\nWith these peculiarities, New England often played an important\r\nsectional role, not the least effective instance of which had been\r\nher independent attitude in the War of 1812. [Footnote: Babcock, Am.\r\nNationality (Am. Nation, XIII.), chap. ix.] By 1820, not only were\r\nprofound economic and social changes affecting the section, but its\r\nrelative importance as a factor in our political life was declining.\r\n[Footnote: Adams, United States, IX., chaps, iv., vii.] The trans-\r\nAllegheny states, which in 1790 reported only a little over one\r\nhundred thousand souls, at a time when New England's population was\r\nover one million, had in 1820 reached a population of nearly two\r\nmillions and a quarter, while New England had not much over a\r\nmillion and a half. Ten years later, the latter section had less\r\nthan two millions, while the western states beyond the Alleghenies\r\nhad over three millions and a half, and the people northwest of the\r\nOhio River alone numbered nearly a million and a half. In 1820 the\r\ntotal population of New England was about equal to the combined\r\npopulation of New York and New Jersey; but its increase between 1820\r\nand 1830 was hardly three hundred thousand, not much over half that\r\nof New York, and less than the gain of Ohio. If Maine, the growing\r\nstate of the group, be excluded, the increase of the whole section\r\nwas less than that of the frontier state of Indiana. \"Our New\r\nEngland prosperity and importance are passing away,\" wrote Webster\r\nat the beginning of the period. [Footnote: McMaster, Webster, 90.]\r\n\r\nWere it not that New England was passing through a series of\r\nrevolutionary economic changes, not fully appreciated at that time,\r\ndoubtless the percentage of her growth would have been even more\r\nunfavorable. As it was, the rise of new manufactures helped to save\r\nher from becoming an entirely stationary section. In the course of\r\nthe preceding two decades, New England's shipping industry had\r\nreached an extraordinary height, by reason of her control of the\r\nneutral trade during the European wars. The close of that period saw\r\nan apparent decline in her relative maritime power in the Union, but\r\nthe shipping and commercial interests were still strong. New England\r\npossessed half the vessels owned in the United States and over half\r\nthe seamen. Massachusetts alone had a quarter of the ships of the\r\nnation and over a third of the sailors. [Footnote: Pitkin,\r\nStatistical View (ed. of 1835), 350.] Of the exports of the United\r\nStates in 1820, the statistics gave to New England about twenty per\r\ncent., nine-tenths of which were from Massachusetts. [Footnote:\r\nShaler, United States, I., chap, x.; MacGregor, Commercial\r\nStatistics of America, 41, 58, 63, 72, 126, 133.] This is rather an\r\nunder-estimate of the share of New England, because a portion of the\r\ncommerce fitted out by her capital and her ships sought the harbor\r\nof New York.\r\n\r\nGreat as was New England's interest in the commercial policy of the\r\nUnited States, the manufactures of the section rose to such\r\nimportance in the course of this decade that the policy of the\r\nsection was divided. The statistics of the manufactures of the\r\nUnited States at the beginning and at the end of the period were so\r\ndefective that little dependence can be placed upon them for\r\ndetails. But the figures for New England were more complete than for\r\nthe other regions; the product of her cotton mills increased in\r\nvalue from two and one-half million dollars in 1820 to over fifteen\r\nand one-half millions in 1831; and her woolen products rose from\r\nless than a million dollars to over eleven million dollars. In\r\nMassachusetts alone, in the same years, the increase in cottons was\r\nfrom about seven hundred thousand dollars to over seven million\r\nseven hundred thousand dollars; and in woolens, from less than three\r\nhundred thousand dollars to over seven million three hundred\r\nthousand dollars. [Footnote: See Secretary of Treasury, Report,\r\n1854-1855, PP-, 87-92; \"Treasury Report,\" in House Exec. Docs., 22\r\nCong., i Sess., I., No. 308.]\r\n\r\nIn brief, the period witnessed the transfer of the industrial center\r\nof gravity from the harbors to the water-falls, from commerce and\r\nnavigation to manufactures. Besides the textile mills of Rhode\r\nIsland and Connecticut, the Merrimac mills grew rapidly around\r\nLowell, Massachusetts; the water-powers of New Hampshire became the\r\nsites of factory towns, and the industrial revolution which, in the\r\ntime of the embargo, began to transfer industries from the household\r\nto the factory, was rapidly carried on. A labor class began to\r\ndevelop, farmers moved into towns, the daughters worked in the\r\nmills. It was not long before Irish immigrants found their way to\r\nthe section and replaced the natives in the mills. The old social\r\nand racial unity began to break down. [Footnote: Woollen, \"Labor\r\nTroubles between 1834 and 1837,\" in Yale Review, I., 87; Martineau,\r\nSociety in America, II., 227, 243, 246; Chevalier, Society, Manners,\r\nand Politics, 137; Addison, Lucy Larcom, 6; Clay, Works, V., 467.]\r\n\r\nAgriculture still occupied the larger number of New England people,\r\nbut it was relatively a declining interest. As early as 1794, Tench\r\nCoxe had characterized New England as a completely settled region,\r\nwith the exception of Maine and Vermont. The generation that\r\nfollowed saw an expansion of agricultural population until the best\r\nvalley lands were taken and the hill-sides were occupied by\r\nstruggling farmers. By 1830 New England was importing corn and flour\r\nin large quantities from the other sections. The raising of cattle\r\nand sheep increased as grain cultivation declined. The back-country\r\nof Maine particularly was being occupied for cattle farms, and in\r\nVermont and the Berkshires there was, towards the close of the\r\ndecade, a marked tendency to combine the small farms into sheep\r\npastures. Thus, in the tariff agitation of the latter part of the\r\ndecade, these two areas of western New England showed a decided\r\nsympathy with the interests of the wool-growers of the country at\r\nlarge. This tendency also fostered emigration from New England,\r\nsince it diminished the number of small farms. By the sale of their\r\nlands to their wealthier neighbors, the New England farmers were\r\nable to go west with money to invest. [Footnote: Niles' Register,\r\nXLIX., 68; Smith and Rann, Rutland County [Vt.], 166; Goodhue, Hist.\r\nof Shoreham [Vt.], 59; Nat. Assoc. of Wool Manufacturers, Bulletin,\r\nXXX., 47, 242, 261.]\r\n\r\nIn the outlying parts, like the back-country of Vermont, farmers\r\nstill lived under primitive industrial conditions, supporting the\r\nfamily largely from the products of the farm, weaving and spinning\r\nunder the conditions of household industry that had characterized\r\nthe colonial period, slaughtering their cattle and hogs, and packing\r\ntheir cheese. When the cold weather set in, caravans of Vermont\r\nfarmers passed, by sledges, to the commercial centers of New\r\nEngland. [Footnote: Heaton, Story of Vermont, chap. vi.] But the\r\nconditions of life were hard for the back-country farmer, and the\r\ntime was rapidly approaching when the attractions of the western\r\nprairies would cause a great exodus from these regions.\r\n\r\nWhile New England underwent the economic changes that have been\r\nmentioned, a political revolution was also in progress. The old\r\nFederalist party and Federalist ideas gradually gave way. Federalism\r\nfound its most complete expression in Connecticut, \"the land of\r\nsteady habits,\" where \"Innovation\" had always been frowned upon by a\r\ngoverning class in which the Congregational clergy were powerful.\r\nPermanence in office and the influence of the clergy were prominent\r\ncharacteristics of the Connecticut government. [Footnote: Dwight,\r\nTravels, I., 262, 263, 291; Welling, \"Conn. Federalism,\" in N. Y.\r\nHist. Soc., Address, 1890, pp. 39-41.] The ceremonies of the\r\ncounting of votes for governor indicated the position of the\r\ndominant classes in this society. This solemnity was performed in\r\nthe church. \"After the Representatives,\" wrote Dwight, the president\r\nof Yale College, \"walk the Preacher of the Day, and the Preacher of\r\nthe succeeding year: and a numerous body of the Clergy, usually more\r\nthan one hundred, close the procession.\" He notes that there were\r\nseveral thousand spectators from all over the state, who were\r\nperfectly decorous, not even engaging in noisy conversation, and\r\nthat a public dinner was regularly given by the state to the clergy\r\nwho were present at the election. [Footnote: Dwight, Travels, I.,\r\n267.]\r\n\r\nAfter the War of 1812, this dominance of the Congregational clergy\r\nthroughout the section was attacked by a combination of religious\r\nand political forces. [Footnote: Schouler, United States, II., 282,\r\n511, III., 52; Adams, United States, IX., 133.] There had been a\r\nsteady growth of denominations like the Baptists and Methodists in\r\nNew England. As a rule, these were located in the remoter and newer\r\ncommunities, and, where they were strongest, there was certain to be\r\na considerable democratic influence. Not only did these\r\ndenominations tend to unite against the Federalists and the\r\nCongregationalists, but they found useful allies in the members of\r\nthe old and influential Episcopal church, who had with them a common\r\ngrievance because of the relations between the state and\r\nCongregationalism. Although the original support of the\r\nCongregational clergy by public taxation had been modified by\r\nsuccessive acts of legislation in most of these states, so that\r\npersons not of that church might make their legal contributions for\r\nthe support of their own clergy, [Footnote: Fearon, Sketches of\r\nAmerica, 114.] yet this had been achieved only recently and but\r\nincompletely.\r\n\r\nWe find, therefore, that the alliance of Episcopalians and\r\nDissenters against the dominant clergy and the Federalists was the\r\nkey to internal politics at the opening of our period. \"The old\r\npolitical distinctions,\" wrote the editor of the Vermont Journal,\r\n\"seem to have given place to religious ones.\" But the religious\r\ncontentions were so closely interwoven with the struggle of New\r\nEngland's democracy to throw off the control of the established\r\nclasses, that the contest was in reality rather more political and\r\nsocial than religious. By her constitutional convention of 1818,\r\nConnecticut practically disestablished the Congregational church and\r\ndid away with the old manner of choosing assistants. [Footnote:\r\nBaldwin, \"The Three Constitutions of Conn.,\" in New Haven Colony\r\nHist. Soc., Papers, V., 210-214.] In the election of 1820 the\r\nRepublican candidate for governor was elected by a decisive vote,\r\nand all of Connecticut's representation in the lower house of\r\nCongress was Republican, [Footnote: Niles' Register, XVIII., 128.]\r\nalthough, in 1816, the Federalist candidate had been chosen by a\r\nsmall majority. [Footnote: Adams, United States, IX., 133.] New\r\nHampshire's toleration act was passed in 1819, but she had achieved\r\nher revolution as early as 1816, when a union of the anti-\r\nCongregational denominations with the Republicans destroyed the\r\nascendancy of the Federalists and tried to break that party's\r\ncontrol of the educational center at Dartmouth College. [Footnote:\r\nP. B. Sanborn, New Hampshire, 251 et seq.; Barstow, New Hampshire,\r\nchaps, xi., xii.; Plumer, William Plumer, 437-460.]\r\n\r\nThe contest was not so clearly marked in Massachusetts as in the\r\nother states, for the old centers of Congregational power, notably\r\nHarvard College, had already begun to feel the liberalizing\r\ninfluence of the Unitarian movement. Congregationalism in\r\nMassachusetts divided into warring camps [Footnote: Walker, Cong.\r\nChurches in the U.S., 303-308.] and was not in a position to\r\nexercise the political power it had shown in other states of New\r\nEngland. The discussion in that state between the Unitarian and\r\northodox wings of the Congregational churches tended, on the whole,\r\nto moderate the extreme views of each, as well as to prevent their\r\nunited domination. In her constitutional convention of 1820,\r\nMassachusetts refused to do away with the advantage which the\r\nCongregational church had in the matter of public support, and it\r\nwas not until 1833 that the other denominations secured the complete\r\nseparation of church and state. The moderate attitude of the\r\nFederalists of the state lengthened their tenure of power. Governor\r\nBrooks, elected by the Federalists in 1817, was a friend of Monroe,\r\nand a moderate who often took Republicans for his counselors, a\r\ngenuine representative of what has been aptly termed the \"Indian\r\nsummer of Federalism in Massachusetts.\"\r\n\r\nThe Republican party controlled the other states of the section, but\r\nthere was in New England, as a whole, a gradual decline and\r\nabsorption, rather than a destruction, of the Federalist party,\r\nwhile, at the same time, marked internal political differences\r\nconstituted a basis for subsequent political conflicts. Just before\r\nhe took his seat in Congress in 1823, Webster lamented to Judge\r\nStory that New England did not get out of the \"dirty squabble of\r\nlocal politics, and assert her proper character and consequence.\"\r\n\"We are disgraced,\" he said, \"beyond help or hope by these things.\r\nThere is a Federal interest, a Democratic interest, a bankrupt\r\ninterest, an orthodox interest, and a middling interest; but I see\r\nno national interest, nor any national feeling in the whole\r\nmatter.\"[Footnote: McMaster, Webster, 99.]\r\n\r\nIn general, northern New England--Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont-\r\n-showed a distinct tendency towards Democracy; in southern New\r\nEngland the fortifications of Federalism and Congregational power\r\nlay in a wide belt along the Connecticut River, while along the sea-\r\ncoast and in the Berkshire region the Democratic forces showed\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nFrom the outlying rural forces, where Democracy was strong, the\r\nsettlement of New-Englanders in the middle west was to come. To\r\nTimothy Dwight, the president of Yale, who voiced the extreme\r\nconservatism of Federal New England, the pioneers seemed unable to\r\nlive in regular society. \"They are impatient of the restraints of\r\nlaw, religion, and morality; grumble about the taxes, by which\r\nRulers, Ministers, and School-masters, are supported; and complain\r\nincessantly, as well as bitterly, of the extortions of mechanics,\r\nfarmers, merchants, and physicians; to whom they are always\r\nindebted. At the same time, they are usually possessed, in their own\r\nview, of uncommon wisdom; understand medical science, politics, and\r\nreligion, better than those, who have studied them through life.\"\r\nThese restless men, with nothing to lose, who were delighted with\r\ninnovation, were, in his judgment, of the type that had ruined\r\nGreece and Rome. \"In mercy, therefore,\" exclaimed Dwight, \"to the\r\nsober, industrious, and well-disposed inhabitants, Providence has\r\nopened in the vast western wilderness a retreat, sufficiently\r\nalluring to draw them away from the land of their nativity. We have\r\nmany troubles even now; but we should have many more, if this body\r\nof foresters had remained at home.\" [Footnote: Dwight, Travels, II.,\r\n458-463.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking feature of New England life was its\r\norganization into communities. What impressed the traveler from\r\nother sections or from the Old World was partly the small farms,\r\ndivided into petty fields by stone fences, but, above all, \"the\r\nclustering of habitations in villages instead of dispersing them at\r\nintervals of a mile over the country.\" The spires of the white\r\nchurches of separate hamlets dotted the landscape. Simple comfort\r\nand thrift were characteristic of the region. \"Here,\" wrote a\r\nVirginia planter, traveling in New England in the early thirties,\r\n\"is not apparent a hundredth part of the abject squalid poverty that\r\nour State presents.\" [Footnote: \"Minor's Journal,\" in Atlantic\r\nMonthly, XXVI., 333.]\r\n\r\nThe morale of New England was distinctive. Puritanism had founded\r\nthe section, and two centuries of Calvinistic discipline had molded\r\nthe New England conscience. That serious self-consciousness, that\r\nself-scrutiny, almost morbid at times, by which the Puritan tried to\r\nsolve the problem of his personal salvation, to determine whether he\r\nwas of the elect, [Footnote: Wendell, Cotton Mather, 6.] was\r\naccompanied by an almost equal anxiety concerning the conduct of his\r\nneighbors. The community life of New England emphasized this trait.\r\n\r\nTudor, who was not friendly to the ideals of the \"land of steady\r\nhabits,\" criticized \"the narrowing influence of local policy,\" and\r\nlamented the \"sort of habitual, pervading police, made up of\r\nCalvinistic inquisition and village scrutiny\" in Connecticut.\r\n[Footnote: Tudor, Letters on the Eastern States (ed. of 1821), 60.]\r\nNot to be one's brother's keeper and not to assent to the dictates\r\nof community sentiment were indications of moral laxity. This long\r\ntraining in theological inquiry, this continued emphasis upon\r\nconduct, and this use of community sentiment as a means of enforcing\r\ncertain moral and political ideals, led the New-Englander to war\r\nwith opposing conceptions wherever he went.\r\n\r\nA test of the ideals of New England is found in the attitude of\r\nthose who spread into new regions. The migrating Yankee was a\r\nreformer. A considerable proportion of the New-Englanders who left\r\nthe section were \"come-outers\" in religion as in politics; many of\r\nthe Vermonters and the pioneers who went west were radicals. But the\r\nmajority of these dissenters from the established order carried with\r\nthem a body of ideas regarding conduct and a way of looking at the\r\nworld that were deeply influenced by their old Puritan training. If,\r\nindeed, they revolted from the older type of Calvinism in the freer\r\nair of a new country, they were, by this sudden release from\r\nrestraint, likely to develop \"isms\" of their own, which revealed the\r\nstrong underlying forces of religious thinking. Lacking the\r\nrestraining influence of the old Congregational system, some of them\r\ncontented themselves with placing greater emphasis upon emotional\r\nreligion and eagerly embraced membership in churches like the\r\nBaptist or Methodist, or accepted fellowship with Presbyterians and\r\nwelcomed the revival spirit of the western churches.\r\n\r\nOthers used their freedom to proclaim a new order of things in the\r\nreligious world. Most noteworthy was Mormonism, which was founded by\r\na migrating New England family and was announced and reached its\r\nfirst success among the New-Englanders of New York and Ohio.\r\nAntimasonry and spiritualism flourished in the Greater New England\r\nin which these emancipated Puritans settled. Wherever the New-\r\nEnglander went he was a leader in reform, in temperance crusades, in\r\nabolition of slavery, in Bible societies, in home missions, in the\r\nevangelization of the west, in the promotion of schools, and in the\r\nestablishment of sectarian colleges.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most significant elements in the disintegration of the\r\nold Congregationalism in New England itself, however, were furnished\r\nby the Unitarians and the Universalists. For nearly a generation the\r\nliberal movement in religion had been progressing. The Unitarian\r\nrevolt, of which Channing was the most important leader, laid its\r\nemphasis upon conduct rather than upon a plan of salvation by\r\natonement. In place of original sin and total depravity, it came\r\nmore and more to put stress upon the fatherhood of God and the\r\ndignity of man. The new optimism of this faith was carried in still\r\nanother direction by the Universalist movement, with its gospel of\r\nuniversal salvation.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the Unitarian movement was confined to a limited\r\narea about Boston, but within its own sphere of influence it\r\ncontested successfully with the old Congregational power, captured\r\nHarvard College, and caught the imaginations of large numbers of the\r\nbest educated and prosperous classes of the community. Attempting to\r\nadjust themselves between the old order of things on the one side,\r\nand the new forces of evangelism and liberalism on the other,\r\nanother great body of Congregationalists found a middle ground in a\r\nmovement of modified Calvinism, which sustained the life of\r\nCongregationalism in large areas of New England. By these movements\r\nof conflict and readjustment, whatever of unity the older\r\nCongregational faith had possessed was gradually broken down and a\r\nrenaissance of religious and moral ideas was ushered in.\r\n\r\nThis change was soon to find expression in a new literary movement\r\nin New England, a movement in which poetry and prose were to take on\r\na cheerful optimism, a joy in life, and an idealism. This new\r\nliterature reflected the influence of the Unitarian movement, the\r\ninfluence of European romantic literature, and the influence of\r\nGerman philosophy. Before long the Transcendentalists proclaimed the\r\nnew idealism that was showing itself about Boston. [Footnote:\r\nWendell, Literary Hist. of America, book V., chaps. iv., v.] Bryant,\r\nLongfellow, Whittier, Hawthorne, and Emerson were all prophesied in\r\nthe forces of intellectual change that now spread over the section.\r\n\r\nEven New England's statesmen were deeply influenced by the literary\r\nspirit. Daniel Webster, although the son of a New Hampshire pioneer\r\nwhose log cabin was on the edge of the vast forest that stretched\r\nnorth to Canada, had won an education at the \"little college\" at\r\nDartmouth; and, after his removal to Boston, he captivated New\r\nEngland by his noble commemorative orations and enriched his\r\narguments before the courts by the splendor of his style. He united\r\nthe strong, passionate nature of his backwoods father with a mind\r\nbrought under the influences of the cultured society of Boston. John\r\nQuincy Adams, also, had been professor of rhetoric and oratory at\r\nHarvard, and he found in the classics a solace when the political\r\nworld grew dark around him. Edward Everett represented even more\r\nclearly the union of the man of letters with the political leader.\r\nIf we except the brilliant but erratic John Randolph, of Roanoke, no\r\nstatesman from other sections showed this impress of literature.\r\n\r\nWhile these forces were developing, a liberalizing of the colleges,\r\nand particularly of Harvard, by the introduction of new courses in\r\nliterature and science, was in progress. Reform movements, designed\r\nto give fuller expression to common-school public education, began,\r\nand already in 1821 Boston had established the first English high-\r\nschool, precursor of a movement of profound importance in the\r\nuplifting of the masses. Lyceums and special schools for the\r\nlaborers flourished in the new centers of manufacturing. The smaller\r\neducational centers, like Dartmouth, Bowdoin, Amherst, and Williams,\r\nwhere the farmer boys of New England worked their way through\r\ncollege, sent out each year men to other sections to become leaders\r\nat the bar, in the pulpit, in the press, and in the newer colleges.\r\nThe careers of Amos Kendall, Prentiss, and others illustrate these\r\ntendencies. In short, New England was training herself to be the\r\nschool-mistress of the nation. Her abiding power was to lie in the\r\ninfluence which she exerted in letters, in education, and in reform.\r\nShe was to find a new life and a larger sphere of activity in the\r\nwide-spread western communities which were already invaded by her\r\nsons. In furnishing men of talent in these fields she was to have an\r\ninfluence out of all relation to her population.[Footnote: Century\r\nMag., XLVII., 43.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE REGION (1820-1830)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe middle states formed a zone of transition between the east and\r\nthe west, the north and the south [Footnote: For earlier discussions\r\nof the middle colonies and states, see Tyler, ENGLAND IN AMERICA,\r\nchap, xvii.; Andrews, COLONIAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, chaps, v., vii.,\r\nxviii., xix.; Greene, PROVINCIAL AMERICA, chaps. xvi.-xviii. (AM.\r\nNATION, IV., V., VI.)]. Geographically, they lay on the line of the\r\nnatural routes between the Atlantic on the one side, and the Ohio\r\nand the Great Lakes on the other. [Footnote: Gallatin, WRITINGS,\r\nIII., 49; Clinton, in LAWS OF THE STATE OF N.Y. IN RELATION TO ERIE\r\nAND CHAMPLAIN CANALS, I., 140.] The waters of the Susquehanna,\r\nrising near the lake region of central New York, flowed to\r\nChesapeake Bay, which opened into the Atlantic far down Virginia's\r\ncoast-line. The Great Valley ran through eastern Pennsylvania,\r\nacross Maryland, and, in the form of the Shenandoah Valley, made a\r\nnatural highway to the interior of North Carolina. New York City and\r\nPhiladelphia saw in an intimate connection with the rising west the\r\npledge of their prosperity; and Baltimore, which was both a\r\nmetropolis of the south and of the middle region, extended her trade\r\nnorth to central New York, west to the Ohio, and south into\r\nVirginia, and, like her rivals, sent her fleets to garner the\r\ncommercial harvest of the sea. In the composition of its population,\r\nalso, the middle region was a land of transitions between sections,\r\nand a prototype of the modern United States, composite in its\r\nnationality. In New York an influential Dutch element still\r\nremained; the New England settlers had colonized the western half of\r\nthe state and about equaled the native population. In Pennsylvania,\r\nGermans and Scotch-Irishmen had settled in such numbers in the\r\ncourse of the eighteenth century that, by the time of the\r\nRevolution, her population was almost evenly divided between these\r\nstocks and the English. [Footnote: See Lincoln, Revolutionary\r\nMovement in Pa., in University of Pa., Publications, I., 24, 35.]\r\nThere was also a larger proportion of recent immigrants than in any\r\nother state, for by 1830 Pennsylvania had one unnaturalized alien to\r\nevery fifty inhabitants.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Great Valley in the middle of the same century, the\r\nScotch-Irish and German settlers had poured into the up-country of\r\nthe south, so that these interior counties of Virginia and the\r\nCarolinas were like a peninsula thrust down from Pennsylvania into\r\nthe south, with economic, racial, social, and religious connections\r\nwhich made an intimate bond between the two sections. A multitude of\r\nreligious sects flourished in tolerant Pennsylvania, and even the\r\nsystem of local government was a combination of the New England town\r\nand the southern county.\r\n\r\nThis region, therefore, was essentially a mediating, transitional\r\nzone, including in its midst an outlying New England and a west, and\r\nlacking the essential traits of a separate section. It was\r\nfundamentally national in its physiography, its composition, and its\r\nideals--a fighting-ground for political issues which found their\r\nleaders in the other sections.\r\n\r\nCompared with New England, the middle region was a rapidly growing\r\nsection. The population of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and\r\nDelaware combined was about two and three-quarter millions in 1820,\r\nand three and two-third millions in 1830. By that date New York\r\nalone balanced all New England in the number of its people. But it\r\nwas its western half that permitted this growth of the middle\r\nsection. During the decade 1820-1830, New York west of Oneida Lake\r\nincreased in population by a percentage more than twice as great,\r\nand by an amount almost as great, as that of the populous eastern\r\nhalf of the state. By the end of the decade, about one-third of\r\nPennsylvania's population was found west of her central counties. At\r\nthat time New York and Pennsylvania became the most populous states\r\nin the Union. Virginia and Massachusetts, which in 1790 held the\r\nlead, had now fallen to third and eighth place respectively. New\r\nJersey, meanwhile, lagged far behind, and Delaware's rate of\r\nincrease was only five and one-half per cent. In 1829 a member of\r\nthe Virginia constitutional convention asked: \"Do gentlemen really\r\nbelieve, that it is owing to any diversity in the principles of the\r\nState Governments of the two states, that New York has advanced to\r\nbe the first state in the Union, and that Virginia, from being the\r\nfirst, is now the third, in wealth and population? Virginia ceded\r\naway her Kentucky, to form a new state; and New York has retained\r\nher Genessee--there lies the whole secret.\" [Footnote: Va.\r\nConstitutional Convention, Debates (1829-1830), 405.]\r\n\r\nIn the closing years of the eighteenth century and the first decade\r\nof the nineteenth the New York lands beyond the sources of the\r\nMohawk had been taken up by a colonization characteristically\r\nwestern. New England farmers swarmed into the region, hard on the\r\nheels of the retreating Indians. Scarcely more than a decade before\r\n1820 western New York presented typically frontier conditions. The\r\nsettlers felled and burned the forest, built little towns, and\r\nerected mills, and now, with a surplus of agricultural products,\r\nthey were suffering from the lack of a market and were demanding\r\ntransportation facilities. Some of their lumber and flour found its\r\nway by the lakes and the St. Lawrence to Montreal, a portion went by\r\nrafts down the Allegheny to the waters of the Ohio, and some\r\ndescended the upper tributaries of the Susquehanna and found an\r\noutlet in Baltimore or Philadelphia; but these routes were\r\nunreliable and expensive, and by one of them trade was diverted from\r\nthe United States to Canada. There was a growing demand for canals\r\nthat should give economic unity to New York and turn the tide of her\r\ninterior commerce along the Mohawk and Lake Champlain into the\r\nwaters of the Hudson and so to the harbor of New York City. The Erie\r\nand the Champlain canals were the outcome of this demand.\r\n\r\nIt is the glory of De Witt Clinton that he saw the economic\r\nrevolution which the Erie Canal would work, and that he was able to\r\npresent clearly and effectively the reasons which made the\r\nundertaking practicable and the financial plan which made it\r\npossible. He persuaded the legislature by the vision of a greater\r\nHudson River, not only reaching to the western confines of the\r\nstate, but even, by its connection with Lake Erie, stretching\r\nthrough two thousand miles of navigable lakes and rivers to the very\r\nheart of the interior of the United States. To him the Erie Canal\r\nwas a political as well as an economic undertaking. \"As a bond of\r\nunion between the Atlantic and western states,\" he declared, \"it may\r\nprevent the dismemberment of the American empire. As an organ of\r\ncommunication between the Hudson, the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence,\r\nthe great lakes of the north and west, and their tributary rivers,\r\nit will create the greatest inland trade ever witnessed. The most\r\nfertile and extensive regions of America will avail themselves of\r\nits facilities for a market. All their surplus productions, whether\r\nof the soil, the forest, the mines, or the water, their fabrics of\r\nart and their supplies of foreign commodities, will concentrate in\r\nthe city of New-York, for transportation abroad or consumption at\r\nhome. Agriculture, manufactures, commerce, trade, navigation, and\r\nthe arts, will receive a correspondent encouragement. That city\r\nwill, in the course of time become the granary of the world, the\r\nemporium of commerce, the seat of manufactures, the focus of great\r\nmoneyed operations, and the concentrating point of vast, disposable,\r\nand accumulating capitals, which will stimulate, enliven, extend,\r\nand reward the exertions of human labor and ingenuity, in all their\r\nprocesses and exhibitions. And before the revolution of a century,\r\nthe whole island of Manhattan, covered with habitations and\r\nreplenished with a dense population, will constitute one vast city.\"\r\n[Footnote: View of the Grand Canal (N. Y., 1825), 20.]\r\n\r\nSanguine as were Clinton's expectations, the event more than\r\njustified his confidence. By 1825 the great canal system, reaching\r\nby way of Lake Champlain to the St. Lawrence, and by way of the\r\nMohawk and the lakes of central New York to Lake Erie, was opened\r\nfor traffic throughout its whole length. The decrease in\r\ntransportation charges brought prosperity and a tide of population\r\ninto western New York; villages sprang up along the whole line of\r\nthe canal; the water-power was utilized for manufactures; land\r\nvalues in the western part of the state doubled and in many cases\r\nquadrupled; farm produce more than doubled in value. Buffalo and\r\nRochester became cities. [Footnote: J. Winden, Influence of the Erie\r\nCanal (MS. Thesis, University of Wisconsin); U. S. Census of 1900,\r\nPopulation, I., 430, 432; Callender, in Quarterly Journal of\r\nEconomics, XVII., 22; Hulbert, Historic Highways, XIV., chap. v.]\r\nThe raw products of the disappearing forests of western New York--\r\nlumber, staves, pot and pearl ashes, etc., and the growing surplus\r\nof agricultural products, began to flow in increasing volume down\r\nthis greater Hudson River to New York City. The farther west was\r\nalso turning its streams of commerce into this channel. The tolls of\r\nthe canal system were over half a million dollars immediately upon\r\nits completion; for 1830 they were over a million dollars.\r\n[Footnote: McMaster, United States, V., 135; Canal Commissioners of\r\nN. Y., Report (January 17, 1833), App. A.] By 1833 the annual value\r\nof the products sent by way of the Erie and Champlain canals was\r\nestimated at thirteen million dollars. [Footnote: Pitkin,\r\nStatistical View (ed. of 1835), 577.] At the close of this decade\r\nthe Ohio system of canals, inspired by the success of the Erie\r\nCanal, had rendered a large area of that state tributary to New\r\nYork. The Great Lake navigation grew steadily, the Western Reserve\r\nincreased its population, and the harbor of Cleveland became a\r\ncenter of trade.\r\n\r\nThe effect of all this upon New York City was revolutionary. Its\r\npopulation increased from 123,000 in 1820 to 202,000 in 1830. Its\r\nreal and personal estate rose in value from about seventy million\r\ndollars in 1820 to about one hundred and twenty-five million dollars\r\nin 1830. [Footnote: U. S. Census of 1900, Population, I., 432;\r\nMacGregor, Commercial Statistics of America, 145.] The most\r\nsignificant result of the canal was the development of the commerce\r\nof New York City, which rose from a market town for the Hudson River\r\nto be the metropolis of the north. The value of the imports of New\r\nYork state in 1821 was twenty-four million dollars; in 1825, the\r\nyear of the completion of the canal, it was fifty million dollars.\r\nThis was an exceptional year, however, and in 1830 the value of the\r\nimports was thirty-six million dollars. In 1821 New York had thirty-\r\neight per cent. of the total value of imports into the United\r\nStates; in 1825, over fifty per cent.; and this proportion she\r\nmaintained during our period. In the exports of domestic origin, New\r\nYork was surpassed in 1819 by Louisiana, and in 1820 by South\r\nCarolina, but thereafter the state took and held the lead.\r\n[Footnote: Compiled from Pitkin, Statistical View.] In 1823 the\r\namount of flour sent from the western portion of New York by the\r\nErie Canal equaled the whole amount which reached New Orleans from\r\nthe Mississippi Valley in that year. [Footnote: Based on statistics\r\nin Report on Internal Commerce, 1887, p. 196; Canal Commissioners of\r\nN. Y., Annual Report (February 20, 1824), 33.] The state of New York\r\nhad by a stroke achieved economic unity, and its metropolis at once\r\nbecame the leading city of the country.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia lost power as New York City gained it. Though the\r\ncounties tributary to Philadelphia constituted the old center of\r\npopulation and political power, the significant fact of growth in\r\nPennsylvania was the increasing importance of Pittsburgh at the\r\ngateway to the Ohio Valley. In the Great Valley beyond the Blue\r\nRidge lived the descendants of those early Germans and Scotch-\r\nIrishmen who early occupied the broad and level fields of this\r\nfertile zone, the granary of Pennsylvania. Beyond this rock-walled\r\nvalley lay the mountains in the west and north of the state, their\r\nlittle valleys occupied by farmers, but already giving promise of\r\nthe rich yield of iron and coal on which the future greatness of the\r\nstate was to rest. The anthracite mines of the northeastern corner\r\nof the state, which have given to their later possessors such\r\ninfluence over the industries of the country, were just coming into\r\nuse. The iron ores of the middle mountain counties found their way\r\nto the forges at Pittsburgh. Already the bituminous coals of the\r\nwestern counties were serving to generate steam-power for the mills\r\nupon the upper waters of the Ohio, but, as yet, the iron\r\nmanufacturers of the state depended on the abundant forests for the\r\nproduction of coke for smelting.\r\n\r\nThe problem of transportation pressed hard upon Pennsylvania from\r\nthe beginning. While Philadelphia was obliged to contest with\r\nBaltimore the possession of the eastern half of the state, she saw\r\nthe productions of the western counties descending the Ohio and\r\nMississippi to New Orleans. Even the trade in manufactured goods\r\nwhich she had formerly sent to the western rivers was now menaced\r\nfrom two quarters: the development of steam navigation on the\r\nMississippi enabled New Orleans to compete for this trade; and the\r\nconstruction of the Erie Canal, with the projected system of\r\ntributary canals in Ohio, made it plain to Pennsylvania that New\r\nYork was about to wrest from her the markets of the west. It had\r\ntaken thirty days and cost five dollars a hundred pounds to\r\ntransport goods from Philadelphia to Columbus, Ohio; the same\r\narticles could be brought in twenty days from New York, by the Erie\r\nCanal, at a cost of two dollars and a half a hundred. [Footnote:\r\nMcMaster, United States, V., 136.] To Pennsylvania the control of\r\nthe western market, always an important interest, had led in 1800 to\r\nthe construction of a system of turnpikes to connect Philadelphia\r\nwith Pittsburgh over the mountains, which developed a great wagon\r\ntrade. But the days of this wagon trade were now numbered, for the\r\nNational Road, joining the Ohio and the Potomac and passing south of\r\nPittsburgh, diverted a large share of this overland trade to\r\nBaltimore. The superior safety, rapidity, and cheapness of canal\r\ncommunication showed Pennsylvania that she must adjust her\r\ntransportation to the new conditions.\r\n\r\nThe way was prepared by the experience of corporations attempting to\r\nreach the coal-fields of northeastern Pennsylvania. In 1820\r\npractically the whole output from the anthracite fields came from\r\nthe Lehigh Valley and amounted to three hundred and sixty-five tons-\r\n-an equivalent of one for each day of the year. By the end of the\r\ndecade the output of the anthracite fields was about one hundred and\r\nseventy-five thousand tons, and the retail price was reduced to six\r\ndollars and a half a ton. Navigation had been secured by the coal\r\ncompanies between the mines and Philadelphia by the Schuylkill; the\r\nUnion Canal connected the Schuylkill and Susquehanna, and New York\r\nCity was supplied by the Delaware Canal. [Footnote: McCulloch,\r\nCommercial Dictionary (ed. of 1852), I., 366; U.S. Census of 1880,\r\nIV.; Worthington, Finances of Pa.]\r\n\r\nThis activity in Pennsylvania in the improvement of navigation so\r\nfar had been the work of corporations; but now, with the growth of\r\npopulation in the west and the completion of the Erie Canal, a\r\npopular demand arose for state construction of inland waterways. In\r\n1825 the legislature passed an act under which an extensive system\r\nof canals was begun, to connect Philadelphia with Pittsburgh, the\r\nAllegheny River with Lake Erie, and Philadelphia with the central\r\ncounties of New York at the head of the Susquehanna. [Footnote: See\r\nchap. xvii., below.] Obstacles speedily developed in the jealousies\r\nof the various sections of the state. The farmers of the Great\r\nValley, whose interests lay in the development of a communication\r\nwith Baltimore, were not enthusiastic; the southern counties of the\r\nstate, along the line of the turnpikes, found their interests\r\nthreatened; and the citizens of the northwestern counties were\r\nunwilling to postpone their demands for an outlet while the trunk-\r\nline was building. These jealousies furnish issues for the politics\r\nof the state during the rest of the decade. [Footnote: McCarthy,\r\n'Antimasonic Party,' in Am. Hist. Assoc., Report 1902, I., 427.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Pennsylvania was growing rich through the development\r\nof her agriculture and her manufactures. The iron industry of the\r\nstate was the largest in the Union. Although the industry was only\r\nin its infancy, Pittsburgh was already producing or receiving a\r\nlarge part of the pig-iron that was produced in Pennsylvania. The\r\nfigures of the census of 1820 give to the middle states over forty\r\nper cent, of the product of pig-iron and castings and wrought iron\r\nin the United States, the value of the latter article for\r\nPennsylvania being one million one hundred and fifty-six thousand\r\ndollars as against four hundred and seventy-two thousand dollars for\r\nNew York. [Footnote: Secretary of Treasury, 'Report,' 1854-1855, p.\r\n90.] The influence of this industry upon Pennsylvania politics\r\nbecame apparent in the discussions over the protective tariff during\r\nthe decade.\r\n\r\nTogether, New York and Pennsylvania constituted a region dominated\r\nby interest in the production of grain and the manufacture of iron.\r\nVast as was the commerce that entered the port of New York, the\r\ncapital and shipping for the port were furnished in part by New\r\nEngland, and the real interest of the section was bound up with the\r\ndeveloping resources of the interior of the nation.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that, in these years of entrance upon its\r\nindustrial career, the middle region was also the scene of\r\nintellectual movements of importance. These were the days when the\r\nKnickerbocker school in New York brought independence and reputation\r\nto American literature, when Irving, although abroad, worked the\r\nrich mine of Hudson River traditions, and Cooper utilized his early\r\nexperience in the frontier around Lake Otsego to write his\r\n\"Leatherstocking Tales.\" Movements for social amelioration abounded.\r\nThe lighting of New York City and Philadelphia by gas diminished\r\ncrime. Reform movements with regard to imprisonment for debt and the\r\nimprovement of the condition of prisons, temperance movements,\r\nimprovements in the administration of the public schools, and the\r\nincrease in the number of high-schools were all indicative of the\r\nfact that this new democracy was not unresponsive to ideals. Among\r\nthe New England element of western New York, as has already been\r\npointed out, there arose some of the most interesting religious and\r\npolitical movements of the period, such as Mormonism, Spiritualism,\r\nand Antimasonry. The Presbyterians and Baptists found a sympathetic\r\nconstituency in the new regions. It is easy to see that the traits\r\nof these western counties of the middle states were such that\r\nidealistic political movements, as antislavery, would find in them\r\neffective support.\r\n\r\nObviously, the political traits of this section would have a\r\nsignificance proportionate to the power of its population and\r\nresources. On the whole, the middle region was the most democratic\r\nsection of the seaboard, but it was managed by the politicians under\r\na system of political bargaining for the spoils of office. The old\r\nascendancy which the great families exercised over New York politics\r\n[Footnote: Becker, \"Nominations in Colonial New York\" (Am. Hist.\r\nRev., VI., 261).] was on the wane. The rise of the western half of\r\nthe state diminished the influence of the successors to the\r\npatroons; but, nevertheless, family power continued to make itself\r\nfelt, and a group of new men arose, around whom factions formed and\r\ndissolved in a kaleidoscope of political change.\r\n\r\nDuring the colonial period, executive patronage and land grants had\r\nbeen used to promote the interests of the men in power, and the\r\nreaction against executive corruption resulted in a provision in New\r\nYork's constitution of 1777 whereby the executive was limited by the\r\nCouncil of Appointment. The state was divided into four districts,\r\nand one senator from each was selected by the House of\r\nRepresentatives to serve in this council. [Footnote: Fish, Civil\r\nService, 87.] By 1821 the council appointed 8287 military officers\r\nand 6663 civil officers. Nearly all the state officers, all the\r\nmayors, militia officers, and justices of the peace fell under its\r\ncontrol.[Footnote: Hammond, Political Parties in N.Y., II., 65.]\r\nThis concentration of the appointive power in the hands of the\r\ndominant faction brought the system of rotation in office, and the\r\ndoctrine that to the victors belong the spoils of war, to a climax.\r\nIt led to the building up of political machines by the use of\r\noffices, from the lowest to the highest, as the currency for\r\npolitical trading. The governor was checked, but the leaders of the\r\nparty in power held despotic control over the offices of the state.\r\n\r\nThis bargaining was facilitated by the extension of the system of\r\nnominating conventions. From the local units of town and county\r\nupwards, the custom of sending delegates to conventions had early\r\ndeveloped in the state. It had become a settled practice for the\r\nrepresentatives of one local unit to agree with those of another\r\nregarding the order in which their favorite sons should receive\r\noffice. Town bargained with town, county with county, district with\r\ndistrict. In place of the system of control by the established\r\nclasses, New York's democracy was learning to elaborate the\r\nmachinery of nomination by the people; but in the process there was\r\ndeveloped a race of managing politicians, and the campaigns tended\r\nto become struggles between personal elements for power rather than\r\ncontests on political issues.\r\n\r\nThe finished product of New York politics is shown in Van Buren, the\r\ndevotee of \"regularity\" in party and the adroit manager of its\r\nmachinery. Shrewdness, tact, and self-reliant judgment, urbane good-\r\nhumor, mingled with a suspicious and half-cynical expression, were\r\nwritten on his face. \"Little Van\" was an affable, firm, and crafty\r\npolitician. Although he was not a creative statesman, neither was he\r\na mere schemer. He had definite ideas, if not convictions, of the\r\nproper lines of policy, and was able to state them with incisive and\r\nforcible argument when occasion demanded. To him, perhaps, more than\r\nto any other of the politicians, fell the task of organizing the\r\ncampaign of Crawford, and afterwards of making the political\r\ncombinations that brought in the reign of Andrew Jackson. He was the\r\nleader of that element of New York politics known as the Bucktails,\r\nfrom the emblem worn by the Tammany Society. Clinton, his opponent,\r\nexercised an influence somewhat akin to the Livingstons, the\r\nSchuylers, the Van Rensselaers, and the other great family leaders\r\nin the baronial days of New York politics. Brusque, arrogant, and\r\nambitious, he combined the petty enmities of a domineering\r\npolitician with flashes of statesman-like insight, and he crushed\r\nhis way to success by an exterminating warfare against his enemies.\r\nAround him gathered a personal following embracing one wing of the\r\nRepublicans, aided by a large fraction of the old Federal party. For\r\nthe most part, his strength lay along the line of the Erie Canal and\r\nin the regions where the New England element was strong.\r\n\r\nAbout these New York rivals were grouped many lesser lights, for the\r\npolitical organization tended to create a multitude of able\r\npolitical leaders, many of them capable of holding high position,\r\nbut few of them swayed by compelling ideas or policies.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania, where the spoils system and the nominating\r\nconvention developed contemporaneously with the movement in New\r\nYork, there were even fewer men of the highest political rank.\r\nGallatin's effective career belongs to an earlier period, and he had\r\nno successor, as a national figure, among the Pennsylvania party\r\nchieftains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH (1820-1830)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the decade which forms the subject of this volume, no section\r\nunderwent more far-reaching changes than did the group of South\r\nAtlantic states made up of Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, and\r\nGeorgia, with which this chapter will deal under the name of the\r\nsouth. Then it was that the south came to appreciate the effect of\r\nthe westward spread of the cotton-plant upon slavery and politics.\r\nThe invention of the cotton-gin by Eli Whitney, [Footnote: Am. Hist.\r\nReview, III., 99.] in 1793, made possible the profitable cultivation\r\nof the short-staple variety of cotton. Before this, the labor of\r\ntaking the seeds by hand from this variety, the only one suited to\r\nproduction in the uplands, had prevented its use; thereafter, it was\r\nonly a question of time when the cotton area, no longer limited to\r\nthe tidewater region, would extend to the interior, carrying slavery\r\nwith it. This invention came at an opportune time. Already the\r\ninventions of Arkwright, Hargreaves, and Cartwright had worked a\r\nrevolution in the textile industries of England, by means of the\r\nspinning-jenny, the power-loom, and the factory system, furnishing\r\nmachinery for the manufacture of cotton beyond the world's\r\nsupply.[Footnote: M. B. Hammond, Cotton Industry, chaps, i., ii.;\r\nVon Halle, \"Baumwollproduktion,\" in Schmoller, Staats und Social-\r\nwissenschaftliche Forschungen, XV.] Under the stimulus of this\r\ndemand for cotton, year by year the area of slavery extended towards\r\nthe west. In the twenties, some of the southern counties of Virginia\r\nwere attempting its cultivation; [Footnote: Va. Const. Conv.,\r\nDebates (1829-1830), 333, 336; Martin, Gazetteer of Va. and D. C.\r\n(1836), 99.] interior counties of North Carolina were combining\r\ncotton-raising with their old industries; in South Carolina the area\r\nof cotton and slavery had extended up the rivers well beyond the\r\nmiddle of the state; [Footnote: Schaper, \"Sectionalism and\r\nRepresentation in S. C.,\" in Am. Hist. Assoc. Report, 1900, I., 387-\r\n393.] while in Georgia the cotton planters, so long restrained by\r\nthe Indian line, broke through the barriers and spread over the\r\nnewly ceded lands. [Footnote: Phillips, \"Georgia and State Rights,\"\r\nin Ibid., 1901, II. 140 (map).] The accompanying table shows the\r\nprogress of this crop: It is evident from the figures that tidewater\r\nSouth Carolina and Georgia produced practically all of the cotton\r\ncrop in 1791, when the total was but two million pounds. By 1821 the\r\nold south produced one hundred and seventeen million pounds, and,\r\nfive years later, one hundred and eighty millions. But how rapidly\r\nin these five years the recently settled southwest was overtaking\r\nthe older section cotton crop (in million pounds)[Footnote: Based on\r\nMacGregor, Commercial Statistics, 462; cf. De Bow's Review, XVII.,\r\n428; Von Halle, Baumwollproduktion, 169; Secretary of Treasury,\r\nReport, 1855-1856, p. 116. There are discrepancies; the figures are\r\nto be taken as illustrative rather than exact; e.g., De Bow gives\r\nseventy million pounds for Mississippi in 1826.] [Table omitted] is\r\nshown by its total of over one hundred and fifty millions. By 1834\r\nthe southwest had distanced the older section. What had occurred was\r\na repeated westward movement: the cotton-plant first spread from the\r\nsea-coast to the uplands, and then, by the beginning of our period,\r\nadvanced to the Gulf plains, until that region achieved supremacy in\r\nits production.\r\n\r\nHow deeply the section was interested in this crop, and how\r\ninfluential it was in the commerce of the United States, appears\r\nfrom the fact that, in 1820, the domestic exports of South Carolina\r\nand Georgia amounted to $15,215,000, while the value of the whole\r\ndomestic exports for all the rest of the United States was\r\n$36,468,000. [Footnote: Pitkin, Statistical View (ed. of 1835), p.\r\n57.] This, however, inadequately represents the value of the exports\r\nfrom these two cotton states, because a large fraction of the cotton\r\nwas carried by the coastwise trade to northern ports and appeared in\r\ntheir shipments. Senator William Smith, of South Carolina, estimated\r\nthat in 1818 the real exports of South Carolina and Georgia amounted\r\nto \"more than half as much as that of the other states of the Union,\r\nincluding the vast and fertile valley of the Mississippi.\" The\r\naverage annual amount of the exports of cotton, tobacco, and rice\r\nfrom the United States between 1821 and 1830 was about thirty-three\r\nmillion dollars, while all other domestic exports made a sum of but\r\ntwenty million dollars. [Footnote: Ibid., 518.] Even greater than\r\nNew England's interest in the carrying-trade was the interest of the\r\nsouth in the exchange of her great staples in the markets of Europe.\r\n\r\nNever in history, perhaps, was an economic force more influential\r\nupon the life of a people. As the production of cotton increased,\r\nthe price fell, and the seaboard south, feeling the competition of\r\nthe virgin soils of the southwest, saw in the protective tariff for\r\nthe development of northern manufactures the real source of her\r\ndistress. The price of cotton was in these years a barometer of\r\nsouthern prosperity and of southern discontent. [Footnote: See chap,\r\nxix., below; M. B. Hammond, Cotton Industry, part i., App. i.;\r\nDonnell, Hist. of Cotton; Watkins, Production and Prices of Cotton.]\r\n\r\nEven more important than the effect of cotton production upon the\r\nprosperity of the south was its effect upon her social system. This\r\neconomic transformation resuscitated slavery from a moribund\r\ncondition to a vigorous and aggressive life. Slowly Virginia and\r\nNorth Carolina came to realize that the burden and expense of\r\nslavery as the labor system for their outworn tobacco and corn\r\nfields was partly counteracted by the demand for their surplus\r\nNegroes in the cotton-fields of their more southern neighbors. When\r\nthe lower south accepted the system as the basis of its prosperity\r\nand its society, the tendency in the states of the upper south,\r\nexcept in the pine barrens and the hill country, to look upon the\r\ninstitution as a heritage to be reluctantly and apologetically\r\naccepted grew fainter. The efforts to find some mode of removing the\r\nNegro from their midst gradually came to an end, and they adjusted\r\nthemselves to slavery as a permanent system. Meanwhile, South\r\nCarolina and Georgia found in the institution the source of their\r\neconomic well-being and hotly challenged the right of other sections\r\nto speak ill of it or meddle with it in any way, lest their domestic\r\nsecurity be endangered. [Footnote: See Hart, Slavery and Abolition\r\n(Am. Nation, XVI.)] When the south became fully conscious that\r\nslavery set the section apart from the rest of the nation, when it\r\nsaw in nationalizing legislation, such as protection to manufactures\r\nand the construction of a system of internal improvements, the\r\nefforts of other sections to deprive the cotton states of their\r\nprofits for the benefit of an industrial development in which they\r\ndid not share, deep discontent prevailed. With but slight\r\nintermission from the days of Washington to those of Monroe, the\r\ntobacco planters under the Virginia dynasty had ruled the nation.\r\nBut now, when the center of power within the section passed from the\r\nweakening hands of Virginia to those of South Carolina, the\r\naggressive leader of the Cotton Kingdom, the south found itself a\r\nminority section in the Union. When it realized this, it denied the\r\nright of the majority to rule, and proceeded to elaborate a system\r\nof minority rights as a protection against the forces of national\r\ndevelopment, believing that these forces threatened the foundations\r\nof the prosperity and even the social safety of the south.\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of the eighteenth century the seaboard planters had\r\nbeen learning the lesson of control by a fraction of the population.\r\nThe south was by no means a unified region in its physiography. The\r\nBlue Ridge cut off the low country of Virginia from the Shenandoah\r\nValley, and beyond this valley the Alleghenies separated the rest of\r\nthe state from those counties which we now know as West Virginia. By\r\nthe time of the Revolution, in the Carolinas and Georgia, a belt of\r\npine barrens, skirting the \"fall line\" from fifty to one hundred\r\nmiles from the coast, divided the region of tidewater planters of\r\nthese states from the small farmers of the up-country. This\r\npopulation of the interior had entered the region in the course of\r\nthe second half of the eighteenth century. Scotch-Irishmen and\r\nGermans passed down the Great Valley from Pennsylvania into\r\nVirginia, and through the gaps in the Blue Ridge out to the Piedmont\r\nregion of the Carolinas, while contemporaneously other streams from\r\nCharleston advanced to meet them. [Footnote: Bassett, in Am. Hist.\r\nAssoc., Report 1894, p. 141; Schaper, ibid., 1900, I., 317;\r\nPhillips, ibid., 1901, II., 88.] Thus, at the close of the\r\neighteenth century, the south was divided into two areas presenting\r\ncontrasted types of civilization. On the one side were the planters,\r\nraising their staple crops of tobacco, rice, and indigo, together\r\nwith some cultivation of the cereals. To this region belonged the\r\nslaves. On the other side was this area of small farmers, raising\r\nlivestock, wheat, and corn under the same conditions of pioneer\r\nfarming as characterized the interior of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nFrom the second half of the eighteenth century down to the time with\r\nwhich this volume deals, there was a persistent struggle between the\r\nplanters of the coast, who controlled the wealth of the region, and\r\nthe free farmers of the interior of Maryland, Virginia, the\r\nCarolinas, and Georgia. The tidewater counties retained the\r\npolitical power which they already possessed before this tide of\r\nsettlement flowed into the back-country. Refusing in most of these\r\nstates to reapportion on the basis of numbers, they protected their\r\nslaves and their wealth against the dangers of a democracy\r\ninterested in internal improvements and capable of imposing a tax\r\nupon slave property in order to promote their ends. In Virginia, in\r\n1825, for example, the western men complained that twenty counties\r\nin the upper country, with over two hundred and twenty thousand free\r\nwhite inhabitants, had no more weight in the government than twenty\r\ncounties on tidewater, containing only about fifty thousand; that\r\nthe six smallest counties in the state, compared with the six\r\nlargest, enjoyed nearly ten times as much political power.\r\n[Footnote: Alexandria Herald, June 13, 1825.] To the gentlemen\r\nplanters of the seaboard, the idea of falling under the control of\r\nthe farmers of the interior of the south seemed intolerable.\r\n\r\nIt was only as slavery spread into the uplands, with the cultivation\r\nof cotton, that the lowlands began to concede and to permit an\r\nincreased power in the legislatures to the sections most nearly\r\nassimilated to the seaboard type. South Carolina achieved this end\r\nin 1808 by the plan of giving to the seaboard the control of one\r\nhouse, while the interior held the other; but it is to be noted that\r\nthis concession was not made until slavery had pushed so far up the\r\nriver-courses that the reapportionment preserved the control in the\r\nhands of slave-holding counties. [Footnote: Calhoun, Works, I., 401;\r\nSchaper, Sectionalism and Representation in S. C., in Am. Hist.\r\nAssoc., Report 1900, I., 434-437.] A similar course was followed by\r\nVirginia in the convention of 1829-1830, when, after a long\r\nstruggle, a compromise was adopted, by which the balance of power in\r\nthe state legislature was transferred to the counties of the\r\nPiedmont and the Valley. [Footnote: Va. Const. Conv., Debates (1829-\r\n1830); Chandler, Representation in Va., in Johns Hopkins Univ.\r\nStudies, XIV., 286-298.] Here slave-holding had progressed so far\r\nthat the interest of those counties was affiliated rather with the\r\ncoast than with the trans-Allegheny country. West Virginia remained\r\na discontented area until her independent statehood in the days of\r\nthe Civil War. These transmontane counties of Virginia were, in\r\ntheir political activity during our period, rather to be reckoned\r\nwith the west than with the south. Thus the southern seaboard\r\nexperienced the need of protecting the interests of its slave-\r\nholding planters against the free democracy of the interior of the\r\nsouth itself, and learned how to safeguard the minority. This\r\nexperience was now to serve the south, when, having attained unity\r\nby the spread of slavery into the interior, it found itself as a\r\nsection in the same relation to the Union which the slave-holding\r\ntidewater area had held towards the more populous up-country of the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThe unification of the section is one of the most important features\r\nof the period. Not only had the south been divided into opposing\r\nareas, as we have seen, but even its population was far from\r\nhomogeneous. By the period of this volume, however, English, French-\r\nHuguenots, Scotch-Irish, and Germans had become assimilated into one\r\npeople, and the Negroes, who in 1830 in the South Atlantic states\r\nnumbered over a million and a half in a white population of not much\r\nover two millions, were diffusing themselves throughout the area of\r\nthe section except in West Virginia and the mountains.\r\nContemporaneously the pioneer farming type of the interior of the\r\nsection was replaced by the planter type. [Footnote: Niles'\r\nRegister, XXI., 132; cf. p. 55 below.] As cotton-planting and slave-\r\nholding advanced into the interior counties of the old southern\r\nstates, the free farmers were obliged either to change to the\r\nplantation economy and buy slaves, or to sell their lands and\r\nmigrate. Large numbers of them, particularly in the Carolinas, were\r\nQuakers or Baptists, whose religious scruples combined with their\r\nagricultural habits to make this change obnoxious. This upland\r\ncountry, too distant from the sea-shore to permit a satisfactory\r\nmarket, was a hive from which pioneers earlier passed into Kentucky\r\nand Tennessee, until those states had become populous commonwealths.\r\nNow the exodus was increased by this later colonization.[Footnote:\r\nSee chap. v. below.] The Ohio was crossed, the Mississippi-Missouri\r\nascended, and the streams that flowed to the Gulf were followed by\r\nmovers away from the regions that were undergoing this social and\r\neconomic reconstruction. This industrial revolution was effective in\r\ndifferent degrees in the different states. Comparatively few of\r\nVirginia's slaves, which by 1830 numbered nearly half a million,\r\nwere found in her trans-Allegheny counties, but the Shenandoah\r\nValley was receiving slaves and changing to the plantation type. In\r\nNorth Carolina the slave population of nearly two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand, at the same date, had spread well into the interior, but\r\ncotton did not achieve the position there which it held farther\r\nsouth. The interior farmers worked small farms of wheat and corn,\r\nlaboring side by side with their Negro slaves in the fields.\r\n[Footnote: Bassett, Slavery in N. C., in Johns Hopkins Univ.\r\nStudies, XVII., 324, 399.] South Carolina had over three hundred\r\nthousand slaves-more than a majority of her population--and the\r\nblack belt extended to the interior. Georgia's slaves, amounting to\r\nover two hundred thousand, somewhat less than half her population,\r\nsteadily advanced from the coast and the Savannah River towards the\r\ncotton-lands of the interior, pushing before them the less\r\nprosperous farmers, who found new homes to the north or south of the\r\ncotton-belt or migrated to the southwestern frontier.[Footnote:\r\nPhillips, Georgia and State Rights, in Am. Hist. Assoc., Report\r\n1901, II., 106.] Here, as in North Carolina, the planters in the\r\ninterior of the state frequently followed the plough or encouraged\r\ntheir slaves by wielding the hoe. [Footnote: Phillips, Georgia and\r\nState Rights, in Am. Hist. Assoc., Report 1901, II., 107.] Thus this\r\nprocess of economic transformation passed from the coast towards the\r\nmountain barrier, gradually eliminating the inharmonious elements\r\nand steadily tending to produce a solidarity of interests. The south\r\nas a whole was becoming, for the first time since colonial days, a\r\nstaple-producing region; and, as diversified farming declined, the\r\nregion tended to become dependent for its supplies of meat products,\r\nhorses, and mules, and even hay and cereals, upon the north and\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThe westward migration of its people checked the growth of the\r\nsouth. It had colonized the new west at the same time that the\r\nmiddle region had been rapidly growing in population, and the result\r\nwas that the proud states of the southern seaboard were reduced to\r\nnumerical inferiority. Like New England, it was an almost stationary\r\nsection. Prom 1820 to 1830 the states of this group gained little\r\nmore than half a million souls, hardly more than the increase of the\r\nsingle state of New York. Virginia, with a population of over a\r\nmillion, increased but 13.7 per cent., and the Carolinas only 15.5\r\nper cent. In the next decade these tendencies were even more clearly\r\nshown, for Virginia and the Carolinas then gained but little more\r\nthan 2 per cent.\r\n\r\nGeorgia alone showed rapid increase. At the beginning of the decade\r\nthe Indians still held all of the territory west of Macon, at the\r\ncenter of the state, with the exception of two tiers of counties\r\nalong the southern border; and, when these lands were opened towards\r\nthe close of the decade, they were occupied by a rush of settlement\r\nsimilar to the occupation of Oklahoma and Indian Territory in our\r\nown day. What Maine was to New England, that Georgia was to the\r\nsouthern seaboard, with the difference that it was deeply touched by\r\ninfluences characteristically western. Because of the traits of her\r\nleaders, and the rude, aggressive policy of her people, Georgia\r\nbelonged at least as much to the west as to the south. From colonial\r\ntimes the Georgia settlers had been engaged in an almost incessant\r\nstruggle against the savages on her border, and had the instincts of\r\na frontier society. [Footnote: Ibid., II., 88; Longstreet, Georgia\r\nScenes; Gilmer, Sketches; Miss. Hist. Soc., Publications, VIII.,\r\n443.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1800 to 1830, throughout the tidewater region, there were clear\r\nevidences of decline. As the movement of capital and population\r\ntowards the interior went on, wealth was drained from the coast;\r\nand, as time passed, the competition of the fertile and low-priced\r\nlands of the Gulf basin proved too strong for the outworn lands even\r\nof the interior of the south. Under the wasteful system of tobacco\r\nand cotton culture, without replenishment of the soil, the staple\r\nareas would, in any case, have declined in value. Even the corn and\r\nwheat lands were exhausted by unscientific farming. [Footnote:\r\nGooch, Prize Essay on Agriculture in Va., in Lynchburg Virginian,\r\nJuly 4, 1833; Martin, Gazetteer of Va., 99, 100.] Writing in 1814 to\r\nJosiah Quincy, [Footnote: E Quincy, Josiah Quincy, 353.] John\r\nRandolph of Roanoke lamented the decline of the seaboard planters.\r\nHe declared that the region was now sunk in obscurity: what\r\nenterprise or capital there was in the country had retired westward;\r\ndeer and wild turkeys were not so plentiful anywhere in Kentucky as\r\nnear the site of the ancient Virginia capital, Williamsburg. In the\r\nVirginia convention of 1829, Mr. Mercer estimated that in 1817 land\r\nvalues in Virginia aggregated two hundred and six million dollars,\r\nand Negroes averaged three hundred dollars, while in 1829 the land\r\nvalues did not surpass ninety millions, and slaves had fallen in\r\nvalue to one hundred and fifty dollars. [Footnote: Va. Const. Conv.,\r\nDebates (1829-1830), 178; Collins, Domestic Slave Trade, 26.]\r\n\r\nIn a speech in the Virginia House of Delegates, in 1832, Thomas\r\nMarshall [Footnote: Collins, Domestic Slave Trade, 24, cited from\r\nRichmond Enquirer, February, 2, 1832.] asserted that the whole\r\nagricultural product of Virginia did not exceed in value the exports\r\nof eighty or ninety years before, when it contained not one-sixth of\r\nthe population. In his judgment, the greater proportion of the\r\nlarger plantations, with from fifty to one hundred slaves, brought\r\nthe proprietors into debt, and rarely did a plantation yield one and\r\na half per cent. profit on the capital. So great had become the\r\ndepression that Randolph prophesied that the time was coming when\r\nthe masters would run away from the slaves and be advertised by them\r\nin the public papers. [Footnote: Collins, Domestic Slave Trade, 26.]\r\n\r\nIt was in this period that Thomas Jefferson fell into such financial\r\nembarrassments that he was obliged to request of the legislature of\r\nVirginia permission to dispose of property by lottery to pay his\r\ndebts, and that a subscription was taken up to relieve his distress.\r\n[Footnote: Randall, Jefferson, III., 527, 561.] At the same time,\r\nMadison, having vainly tried to get a loan from the United States\r\nBank, was forced to dispose of some of his lands and stocks;\r\n[Footnote: Hunt, Madison, 380.] and Monroe, at the close of his term\r\nof office, found himself financially ruined. He gave up Oak Hill and\r\nspent his declining years with his son-in-law in New York City. The\r\nold-time tide-water mansions, where, in an earlier day, everybody\r\nkept open house, gradually fell into decay.\r\n\r\nSad indeed was the spectacle of Virginia's ancient aristocracy. It\r\nhad never been a luxurious society. The very wealthy planters, with\r\nvast cultivated estates and pretentious homes, were in the minority.\r\nFor the most part, the houses were moderate frame structures, set at\r\nintervals of a mile or so apart, often in park like grounds, with\r\nlong avenues of trees. The plantation was a little world in itself.\r\n\r\nHere was made much of the clothing for the slaves, and the mistress\r\nof the plantation supervised the spinning and weaving. Leather was\r\ntanned on the place, and blacksmithing, wood-working, and other\r\nindustries were carried on, often under the direction of white\r\nmechanics. The planter and his wife commonly had the care of the\r\nblack families whom they possessed, looked after them when they were\r\nsick, saw to their daily rations, arranged marriages, and determined\r\nthe daily tasks of the plantation. The abundant hospitality between\r\nneighbors gave opportunity for social cultivation, and politics was\r\na favorite subject of conversation.\r\n\r\nThe leading planters served as justices of the peace, but they were\r\nnot dependent for their selection upon the popular vote. Appointed\r\nby the governor on nomination of the court itself, they constituted\r\na kind of close corporation, exercising local judicial, legislative,\r\nand executive functions. The sheriff was appointed by the governor\r\nfrom three justices of the peace recommended by the court, and the\r\ncourt itself appointed the county clerk. Thus the county government\r\nof Virginia was distinctly aristocratic. County-court day served as\r\nan opportunity for bringing together the freeholders, who included\r\nnot only the larger planters, but the small farmers and the poor\r\nwhites--hangers-on of the greater plantations. Almost no large\r\ncities were found in Virginia. The court-house was hardly more than\r\na meeting-place for the rural population. Here farmers exchanged\r\ntheir goods, traded horses, often fought, and listened to the stump\r\nspeeches of the orators. [Footnote: Johnson, Robert Lewis Dabney,\r\n14-24; Smedes, A Southern Planter, 34-37.]\r\n\r\nSuch were, in the main, the characteristics of that homespun\r\nplantation aristocracy which, through the Virginia dynasty, had\r\nruled the nation in the days of Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and\r\nMonroe. As their lands declined in value, they naturally sought for\r\nan explanation and a remedy. [Footnote: Randall, Jefferson, III.,\r\n532.] The explanation was found most commonly in the charge that the\r\nprotective tariff was destroying the prosperity of the south; and in\r\nreaction they turned to demand the old days of Jeffersonian rural\r\nsimplicity, under the guardianship of state rights and a strict\r\nconstruction of the Constitution. Madison in vain laid the fall in\r\nland values in Virginia to the uncertainty and low prices of the\r\ncrops, to the quantity of land thrown on the market, and the\r\nattractions of the cheaper and better lands beyond the mountains.\r\n[Footnote: Madison, Writings (ed. of 1865), III., 614.]\r\n\r\nOthers called attention to the fact that the semi-annual migration\r\ntowards the west and southwest, which swept off enterprising\r\nportions of the people and much of the capital and movable property\r\nof the state, also kept down the price of land by the great\r\nquantities thereby thrown into the market. Instead of applying a\r\nsystem of scientific farming and replenishment of the soil, there\r\nwas a tendency for the planters who remained to get into debt in\r\norder to add to their possessions the farms which were offered for\r\nsale by the movers. Thus there was a flow of wealth towards the west\r\nto pay for these new purchases. The overgrown plantations soon began\r\nto look tattered and almost desolate. \"Galled and gullied hill-sides\r\nand sedgy, briary fields\" [Footnote: Lynchburg Virginian, July 4,\r\n1833.] showed themselves in every direction. Finally the planter\r\nfound himself obliged to part with some of his slaves, in response\r\nto the demand from the new cotton-fields; or to migrate himself,\r\nwith his caravan of Negroes, to open a new home in the Gulf region.\r\nDuring the period of this survey the price for prime field-hands in\r\nGeorgia averaged a little over seven hundred dollars. [Footnote:\r\nPhillips, in Pol. Sci. Quart., XX., 267.] If the estimate of one\r\nhundred and fifty dollars for Negroes sold in family lots in\r\nVirginia is correct, it is clear that economic laws would bring\r\nabout a condition where Virginia's resources would in part depend\r\nupon her supply of slaves to the cotton-belt. [Footnote: Collins,\r\nDomestic Slave Trade, 42-46.] It is clear, also, that the Old\r\nDominion had passed the apogee of her political power.\r\n\r\nIt was not only the planters of Virginia that suffered in this\r\nperiod of change. As the more extensive and fertile cotton-fields of\r\nthe new states of the southwest opened, North Carolina and even\r\nSouth Carolina found themselves embarrassed. With the fall in cotton\r\nprices, already mentioned, it became increasingly necessary to\r\npossess the advantages of large estates and unexhausted soils, in\r\norder to extract a profit from this cultivation. From South Carolina\r\nthere came a protest more vehement and aggressive than that of the\r\ndiscontented classes of Virginia. Already the indigo plantation had\r\nceased to be profitable and the rice planters no longer held their\r\nold prosperity.\r\n\r\nCharleston was peculiarly suited to lead in a movement of revolt. It\r\nwas the one important center of real city life of the seaboard south\r\nof Baltimore. Here every February the planters gathered from their\r\nplantations, thirty to one hundred and fifty miles away, for a month\r\nin their town houses. At this season, races, social gayeties, and\r\npolitical conferences vied with one another in engaging the\r\nattention of the planters. Returning to their plantations in the\r\nearly spring, they remained until June, when considerations of\r\nhealth compelled them either again to return to the city, to visit\r\nthe mountains, or to go to such watering-places as Saratoga in New\r\nYork. Here again they talked politics and mingled with political\r\nleaders of the north. It was not until the fall that they were able\r\nto return again to their estates. [Footnote: Hodgson, Letters from\r\nNorth America, I.,50.] Thus South Carolina, affording a combination\r\nof plantation life with the social intercourse of the city, gave\r\npeculiar opportunities for exchanging ideas and consolidating the\r\nsentiment of her leaders.\r\n\r\nThe condition of South Carolina was doubtless exaggerated by Hayne,\r\nin his speech in the Senate in 1832, when he characterized it as\r\n\"not merely one of unexampled depression, but of great and all-\r\npervading distress,\" with \"the mournful evidence of premature\r\ndecay,\" \"merchants bankrupt or driven away--their capital sunk or\r\ntransferred to other pursuits--our shipyards broken up--our ships\r\nall sold!\" \"If,\" said he, \"we fly from the city to the country, what\r\ndo we there behold? Fields abandoned; the hospitable mansions of our\r\nfathers deserted; agriculture drooping; our slaves, like their\r\nmasters, working harder, and faring worse; the planter striving with\r\nunavailing efforts to avert the ruin which is before him.\" He drew a\r\nsad picture of the once thriving planter, reduced to despair,\r\ngathering up the small remnants of his broken fortune, and, with his\r\nwife and little ones, tearing himself from the scenes of his\r\nchildhood and the bones of his ancestors to seek in the wilderness\r\nthe reward for his industry of which the policy of Congress had\r\ndeprived him. [Footnote: Register of Debates, VIII., pt. i., 80; cf.\r\nHouston, Nullification in S.C., 46; McDuffie, in Register of\r\nDebates, 18th Cong., 2 Sess., 253.]\r\n\r\nThe genius of the south expressed itself most clearly in the field\r\nof politics. If the democratic middle region could show a multitude\r\nof clever politicians, the aristocratic south possessed an abundance\r\nof leaders bold in political initiative and masterful in their\r\nability to use the talents of their northern allies. When the\r\nMissouri question was debated, John Quincy Adams remarked \"that if\r\ninstitutions are to be judged by their results in the composition of\r\nthe councils of this Union, the slave-holders are much more ably\r\nrepresented than the simple freemen.\" [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs,\r\nIV., 506.]\r\n\r\nThe southern statesmen fall into two classes. On the one side was\r\nthe Virginia group, now for the most part old men, rich in the\r\nhonors of the nation, still influential, but, except for Monroe, no\r\nlonger directing party policy. Jefferson and Madison were in\r\nretirement in their old age; Marshall, as chief-justice, was\r\ncontinuing his career as the expounder of the Constitution in\r\naccordance with Federalist ideals; John Randolph, his old\r\neccentricities increased by disease and intemperance, remained to\r\nproclaim the extreme doctrines of southern dissent and to impale his\r\nadversaries with javelins of flashing wit. A maker of phrases which\r\nstung and festered, he was still capable of influencing public\r\nopinion somewhat in the same way as are the cartoonists of modern\r\ntimes. But \"his course through life had been like that of the arrow\r\nwhich Alcestes shot to heaven, which effected nothing useful, though\r\nit left a long stream of light behind it.\" [Footnote: Lynchburg\r\nVirginian, May 9, 1833.] In North Carolina, the venerable Macon\r\nremained to protest like a later Cato against the tendencies of the\r\ntimes and to raise a warning voice to his fellow slave-holders\r\nagainst national consolidation.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this decade, the effective leadership of the south\r\nfell to Calhoun and Crawford. [Footnote: See chap. xi. below.] About\r\nthese statesmen were grouped energetic and able men like Hayne,\r\nMcDuffie, and Hamilton of South Carolina, and Cobb and Forsyth of\r\nGeorgia--men who sometimes pushed their leaders on in a sectional\r\npath which the latter's caution or personal ambitions made them\r\nreluctant to tread. Nor must it be forgotten that early in the\r\ndecade the south lost two of her greatest statesmen, the wise and\r\nmoderate Lowndes, of South Carolina, and Pinkney, the brilliant\r\nMaryland orator. In the course of the ten years which we are to\r\nsketch, the influence of economic change within this section\r\ntransformed the South Carolinians from warm supporters of a liberal\r\nnational policy into the straightest of the sect of state-\r\nsovereignty advocates, intent upon raising barriers against the\r\nflood of nationalism that threatened to overwhelm the south. In\r\nrelating the changing policy of the southern political leaders, we\r\nshall again observe the progress and the effects of the economic\r\ntransformations which it has been the purpose of this chapter to\r\nportray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCOLONIZATION OF THE WEST (1820-1830)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rise of the new west was the most significant fact in American\r\nhistory in the years immediately following the War of 1812. Ever\r\nsince the beginnings of colonization on the Atlantic coast a\r\nfrontier of settlement had advanced, cutting into the forest,\r\npushing back the Indian, and steadily widening the area of\r\ncivilization in its rear. [Footnote: Three articles by F.J. Turner,\r\nviz.: \"Significance of the Frontier in American History,\" in Am.\r\nHist. Assoc., Report 1893, 199-227; \"Problem of the West,\" in\r\n\"Atlantic Monthly, LXXVIII, 289; \"Contributions of the West to\r\nAmerican Democracy, ibid, XCI., 83.] There had been a west even in\r\nearly colonial days; but then it lay close to the coast. By the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century the west was to be found beyond\r\ntide-water, advancing towards the Allegheny Mountains. When this\r\nbarrier was crossed and the lands on the other side of the mountains\r\nwere won, in the days of the Revolution, a new and greater west,\r\nmore influential on the nation's destiny, was created. [Footnote:\r\nHoward, Preliminaries of Revolution, chap. xiii.; Van Tyne, Am.\r\nRevolution, chap. xv.; McLaughlin, Confederation and Constitution,\r\nchap. viii. (Am. Nation, VIII., IX., X.).]\r\n\r\nThe men of the \"Western Waters\" or the \"Western World,\" as they\r\nloved to call themselves, developed under conditions of separation\r\nfrom the older settlements and from Europe. The lands, practically\r\nfree, in this vast area not only attracted the settler, but\r\nfurnished opportunity for all men to hew out their own careers. The\r\nwilderness ever opened a gate of escape to the poor, the\r\ndiscontented, and the oppressed. If social conditions tended to\r\ncrystallize in the east, beyond the Alleghenies there was freedom.\r\nGrappling with new problems, under these conditions, the society\r\nthat spread into this region developed inventiveness and\r\nresourcefulness; the restraints of custom were broken, and new\r\nactivities, new lines of growth, new institutions were produced. Mr.\r\nBryce has well declared that \"the West is the most American part of\r\nAmerica.... What Europe is to Asia, what England is to the rest of\r\nEurope, what America is to England, that the Western States and\r\nTerritories are to the Atlantic States.\" [Footnote: Bryce, American\r\nCommonwealth (ed. of 1895), II., 830.] The American spirit--the\r\ntraits that have come to be recognized as the most characteristic--\r\nwas developed in the new commonwealths that sprang into life beyond\r\nthe seaboard. In these new western lands Americans achieved a\r\nboldness of conception of the country's destiny and democracy. The\r\nideal of the west was its emphasis upon the worth and possibilities\r\nof the common man, its belief in the right of every man to rise to\r\nthe full measure of his own nature, under conditions of social\r\nmobility. Western democracy was no theorist's dream. It came, stark\r\nand strong and full of life, from the American forest. [Footnote: P.\r\nJ. Turner, \"Contributions of the West to American Democracy,\" in\r\nAtlantic Monthly, XCL, 83, and \"The Middle West,\" in International\r\nMonthly, IV., 794.]\r\n\r\nThe time had now come when this section was to make itself felt as a\r\ndominant force in American life. Already it had shown its influence\r\nupon the older sections. By its competition, by its attractions for\r\nsettlers, it reacted on the east and gave added impulse to the\r\ndemocratic movement in New England and New York. The struggle of\r\nBaltimore, New York City, and Philadelphia for the rising commerce\r\nof the interior was a potent factor in the development of the middle\r\nregion. In the south the spread of the cotton-plant and the new form\r\nwhich slavery took were phases of the westward movement of the\r\nplantation. The discontent of the old south is partly explained by\r\nthe migration of her citizens to the west and by the competition of\r\nher colonists in the lands beyond the Alleghenies. The future of the\r\nsouth lay in its affiliation to the Cotton Kingdom of the lower\r\nstates which were rising on the plains of the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nRightly to understand the power which the new west was to exert upon\r\nthe economic and political life of the nation in the years between\r\n1820 and 1830, it is necessary to consider somewhat fully the\r\nstatistics of growth in western population and industry.\r\n\r\nThe western states ranked with the middle region and the south in\r\nrespect to population. Between 1812 and 1821 six new western\r\ncommonwealths were added to the Union: Louisiana (1812), Indiana\r\n(1816), Mississippi (1817), Illinois (1818), Alabama (1819), and\r\nMissouri (1821). In the decade from 1820 to 1830, these states, with\r\ntheir older sisters, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio, increased their\r\npopulation from 2,217,000 to nearly 3,700,000, a gain of about a\r\nmillion and a half in the decade. The percentages of increase in\r\nthese new communities tell a striking story. Even the older states\r\nof the group grew steadily. Kentucky, with 22 per cent., Louisiana,\r\nwith 41, and Tennessee and Ohio, each with 61, were increasing much\r\nfaster than New England and the south, outside of Maine and Georgia.\r\nBut for the newer communities the percentages of gain are still more\r\nsignificant: Mississippi, 81 per cent.; Alabama, 142; Indiana, 133;\r\nand Illinois, 185. The population of Ohio, which hardly more than a\r\ngeneration before was \"fresh, untouched, unbounded, magnificent\r\nwilderness,\" [Footnote: Webster, Writings (National ed.), V., 252.]\r\nwas now nearly a million, surpassing the combined population of\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut.\r\n\r\nA new section had arisen and was growing at such a rate that a\r\ndescription of it in any single year would be falsified before it\r\ncould be published. Nor is the whole strength of the western element\r\nrevealed by these figures. In order to estimate the weight of the\r\nwestern population in 1830, we must add six hundred thousand souls\r\nin the western half of New York, three hundred thousand in the\r\ninterior counties of Pennsylvania, and over two hundred thousand in\r\nthe trans-Allegheny counties of Virginia, making an aggregate of\r\nfour million six hundred thousand. Fully to reckon the forces of\r\nbackwoods democracy, moreover, we should include a large fraction of\r\nthe interior population of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, North\r\nCarolina, and Georgia, and northern New York. All of these regions\r\nwere to be influenced by the ideals of democratic rule which were\r\nspringing up in the Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nIn voting-power the western states alone--to say nothing of the\r\ninterior districts of the older states--were even more important\r\nthan the figures for population indicate. The west itself had, under\r\nthe apportionment of 1822, forty-seven out of the two hundred and\r\nthirteen members of the House of Representatives, while in the\r\nSenate its representation was eighteen out of forty-eight--more than\r\nthat of any other section. Clearly, here was a region to be reckoned\r\nwith; its economic interests, its ideals, and its political leaders\r\nwere certain to have a powerful, if not a controlling, voice in the\r\ncouncils of the nation.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the War of 1812 the west had much homogeneity. Parts\r\nof Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio had been settled so many years that\r\nthey no longer presented typical western conditions; but in most of\r\nits area the west then was occupied by pioneer farmers and stock-\r\nraisers, eking out their larder and getting peltries by hunting, and\r\nraising only a small surplus for market. By 1830, however,\r\nindustrial differentiation between the northern and southern\r\nportions of the Mississippi Valley was clearly marked. The northwest\r\nwas changing to a land of farmers and town-builders, anxious for a\r\nmarket for their grain and cattle; while the southwest was becoming\r\nincreasingly a cotton-raising section, swayed by the same impulses\r\nin respect to staple exports as those which governed the southern\r\nseaboard. Economically, the northern portion of the valley tended to\r\nconnect itself with the middle states, while the southern portion\r\ncame into increasingly intimate connection with the south.\r\nNevertheless, it would be a radical mistake not to deal with the\r\nwest as a separate region, for, with all these differences within\r\nitself, it possessed a fundamental unity in its social structure and\r\nits democratic ideals, and at times, in no uncertain way, it showed\r\na consciousness of its separate existence.\r\n\r\nIn occupying the Mississippi Valley the American people colonized a\r\nregion far surpassing in area the territory of the old thirteen\r\nstates. The movement was, indeed, but the continuation of the\r\nadvance of the frontier which had begun in the earliest days of\r\nAmerican colonization. The existence of a great body of land,\r\noffered at so low a price as to be practically free, inevitably drew\r\npopulation towards the west. When wild lands sold for two dollars an\r\nacre, and, indeed, could be occupied by squatters almost without\r\nmolestation, it was certain that settlers would seek them instead of\r\npaying twenty to fifty dollars an acre for farms that lay not much\r\nfarther to the east--particularly when the western lands were more\r\nfertile. The introduction of the steamboat on the western waters in\r\n1811, moreover, soon revolutionized transportation conditions in the\r\nWest. [Footnote: Flint, Letters, 260; Monette, in Miss. Hist. Soc.,\r\nPublications, VII., 503; Hall, Statistics of the West, 236, 247;\r\nLloyd, Steamboat Disasters (1853), 32, 40-45; Preble, Steam\r\nNavigation, 64; McMaster, United States, IV., 402; Chittenden, Early\r\nSteamboat Navigation on the Missouri, chap. ix.] At the beginning of\r\nthe period of which we are treating, steamers were ascending the\r\nMississippi and the Missouri, as well as the Ohio and its\r\ntributaries. Between the close of the War of 1812 and 1830,\r\nmoreover, the Indian title was extinguished to vast regions in the\r\nwest. Half of Michigan was opened to settlement; the northwestern\r\nquarter of Ohio was freed; in Indiana and Illinois (more than half\r\nof which had been Indian country prior to 1816) all but a\r\ncomparatively small region of undesired prairie lands south of Lake\r\nMichigan was ceded; almost the whole state of Missouri was freed\r\nfrom its Indian title; and, in the Gulf region, at the close of the\r\ndecade, the Indians held but two isolated islands of territory, one\r\nin western Georgia and eastern Alabama, and the other in northern\r\nand central Mississippi. These ceded regions were the fruit of the\r\nvictories of William Henry Harrison in the northwest, and of Andrew\r\nJackson in the Gulf region. They were, in effect, conquered\r\nprovinces, just opened to colonization.\r\n\r\nThe maps of the United States census, giving the distribution of\r\npopulation in 1810, 1820, and 1830, [Footnote: See maps of\r\npopulation; compare U. S. Census of 1900, Statistical Atlas, plates\r\n4, 5, 6.] exhibit clearly the effects of the defeat of the Indians,\r\nand show the areas that were occupied in these years. In 1810\r\nsettlement beyond the mountains was almost limited to a zone along\r\nthe Ohio River and its tributaries, the Cumberland and the\r\nTennessee. In the southwest, the vicinity of Mobile showed sparse\r\nsettlement, chiefly survivals of the Spanish and English occupation;\r\nand, along the fluvial lands of the eastern bank of the lower\r\nMississippi, in the Natchez region, as well as in the old province\r\nof Louisiana, there was a considerable area occupied by planters.\r\n\r\nBy 1820 the effects of the War of 1812 and the rising tide of\r\nwestward migration became manifest. Pioneers spread along the river-\r\ncourses of the northwest well up to the Indian boundary. The zone of\r\nsettlement along the Ohio ascended the Missouri, in the rush to the\r\nBoone's Lick country, towards the center of the present state. From\r\nthe settlements of middle Tennessee a pioneer farming area reached\r\nsouthward to connect with the settlements of Mobile, and the latter\r\nbecame conterminous with those of the lower Mississippi.\r\n\r\nBy 1830 large portions of these Indian lands, which were ceded\r\nbetween 1817 and 1829, received the same type of colonization. The\r\nunoccupied lands in Indiana and Illinois were prairie country, then\r\ndeemed unsuited for settlement because of the lack of wood and\r\ndrinking-water. It was the hardwoods that had been taken up in the\r\nnorthwest, and, for the most part, the tracts a little back from the\r\nunhealthful bottom-lands, but in close proximity to the rivers,\r\nwhich were the only means of transportation before the building of\r\ngood roads. A new island of settlement appeared in the northwestern\r\nportion of Illinois and the adjacent regions of Wisconsin and Iowa,\r\ndue to the opening of the lead-mines. Along the Missouri Valley and\r\nin the Gulf region the areas possessed in 1820 increased in density\r\nof population. Georgia spread her settlers into the Indian lands,\r\nwhich she had so recently secured by threatening a rupture with the\r\nUnited States. [Footnote: MacDonald, Jacksonian Democracy (Am.\r\nNation, XV.), chap. x. ]\r\n\r\nTranslated into terms of human activity, these shaded areas,\r\nencroaching on the blank spaces of the map, meant much for the\r\nhistory of the United States. Even in the northwest, which we shall\r\nfirst describe, they represent, in the main, the migration of\r\nsouthern people. New England, after the distress following the War\r\nof 1812 and the hard winter of 1816-1817, had sent many settlers\r\ninto western New York and Ohio; the Western Reserve had increased in\r\npopulation by the immigration, of Connecticut people; Pennsylvania\r\nand New Jersey had sent colonists to southern and central Ohio, with\r\nCincinnati as the commercial center. In Ohio the settlers of middle-\r\nstate origin were decidedly more numerous than those from the south,\r\nand New England's share was distinctly smaller than that of the\r\nsouth. In the Ohio legislature in 1822 there were thirty-eight\r\nmembers of middle-state birth, thirty-three of southern (including\r\nKentucky), and twenty-five of New England. But Kentucky and\r\nTennessee (now sufficiently settled to need larger and cheaper farms\r\nfor the rising generation), together with the up-country of the\r\nsouth, contributed the mass of the pioneer colonists to most of the\r\nMississippi Valley prior to 1830. [Footnote: See, for Ohio, Niles'\r\nRegister, XXI., 368 (leg. session of 1822), and Nat. Republican,\r\nJanuary 2, 1824; for Illinois in 1833, Western Monthly Magazine, I.,\r\n199; for Missouri convention of 1820, Niles' Register, XVIII., 400;\r\nfor Alabama in 1820, ibid., XX., 64. Local histories, travels,\r\nnewspapers, and the census of 1850 support the text.] Of course, a\r\nlarge fraction of these came from the Scotch-Irish and German stock\r\nthat in the first half of the eighteenth century passed from\r\nPennsylvania along the Great Valley to the up-country of the south.\r\nIndiana, so late as 1850, showed but ten thousand natives of New\r\nEngland, and twice as many persons of southern as of middle states\r\norigin. In the history of Indiana, North Carolina contributed a\r\nlarge fraction of the population, giving to it its \"Hoosier\" as well\r\nas much of its Quaker stock. Illinois in this period had but a\r\nsprinkling of New-Englanders, engaged in business in the little\r\ntowns. The southern stock, including settlers from Kentucky and\r\nTennessee, was the preponderant class. The Illinois legislature for\r\n1833 contained fifty-eight from the south (including Kentucky and\r\nTennessee), nineteen from the middle states, and only four from New\r\nEngland. Missouri's population was chiefly Kentuckians and\r\nTennesseeans.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of this southern element came, in considerable measure,\r\nfrom well-to-do classes, who migrated to improve their conditions in\r\nthe freer opportunities of a new country. Land speculation, the\r\nopportunity of political preferment, and the advantages which these\r\ngrowing communities brought to practitioners of the law combined to\r\nattract men of this class. Many of them, as we shall see, brought\r\ntheir slaves with them, under the systems of indenture which made\r\nthis possible. Missouri, especially, was sought by planters with\r\ntheir slaves. But it was the poorer whites, the more democratic,\r\nnon-slaveholding element of the south, which furnished the great\r\nbulk of the settlers north of the Ohio. Prior to the close of the\r\ndecade the same farmer type was in possession of large parts of the\r\nGulf region, whither, through the whole of our period, the slave-\r\nholding planters came in increasing numbers.\r\n\r\nTwo of the families which left Kentucky for the newer country in\r\nthese years will illustrate the movement. The Lincoln family\r\n[Footnote: Tarbell, Lincoln, I., chaps, i.-iv.; Herndon, Lincoln,\r\nI., chaps, i.-iv.; Nicolay and Hay, Lincoln, I., chaps, i.-iii.] had\r\nreached that state by migration from the north with the stream of\r\nbackwoodsmen which bore along with it the Calhouns and the Boones.\r\nAbraham Lincoln was born in a hilly, barren portion of Kentucky in\r\n1809. In 1816, when Lincoln was a boy of seven, his father, a poor\r\ncarpenter, took his family across the Ohio on a raft, with a capital\r\nconsisting of his kit of tools and several hundred gallons of\r\nwhiskey. In Indiana he hewed a path into the forest to a new home in\r\nthe southern part of the state, where for a year the family lived in\r\na \"half-faced camp,\" or open shed of poles, clearing their land. In\r\nthe hardships of the pioneer life Lincoln's mother died, as did many\r\nanother frontier woman. In 1830 Lincoln was a tall, strapping youth,\r\nsix feet four inches in height, able to sink his axe deeper than\r\nother men into the opposing forest. At that time his father moved to\r\nthe Sangamon country of Illinois with the rush of land-seekers into\r\nthat new and popular region. Near the home of Lincoln in Kentucky\r\nwas born, in 1808, Jefferson Davis [Footnote: Mrs. Davis, Jefferson\r\nDavis, I., 5.], whose father, shortly before the War of 1812, went\r\nwith the stream of southward movers to Louisiana and then to\r\nMississippi. Davis's brothers fought under Jackson in the War of\r\n1812, and the family became typical planters of the Gulf region.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the roads that led to the Ohio Valley were followed by an\r\nincreasing tide of settlers from the east. \"Old America seems to be\r\nbreaking up, and moving westward,\" wrote Morris Birkbeck in 1817, as\r\nhe passed on the National Road through Pennsylvania. \"We are seldom\r\nout of sight, as we travel on this grand track, towards the Ohio, of\r\nfamily groups, behind and before us. ... A small waggon (so light\r\nthat you might almost carry it, yet strong enough to bear a good\r\nload of bedding, utensils and provisions, and a swarm of young\r\ncitizens,--and to sustain marvellous shocks in its passage over\r\nthese rocky heights) with two small horses; sometimes a cow or two,\r\ncomprises their all; excepting a little store of hard-earned cash\r\nfor the land office of the district; where they may obtain a title\r\nfor as many acres as they possess half-dollars, being one fourth of\r\nthe purchase-money. The waggon has a tilt, or cover, made of a\r\nsheet, or perhaps a blanket. The family are seen before, behind, or\r\nwithin the vehicle, according to the road or the weather, or perhaps\r\nthe spirits of the party. ... A cart and single horse frequently\r\naffords the means of transfer, sometimes a horse and packsaddle.\r\nOften the back of the poor pilgrim bears all his effects, and his\r\nwife follows, naked-footed, bending under the hopes of the family.\"\r\n[Footnote: Birkbeck, Notes on a Journey from Va. to Ill., 25, 26.]\r\n\r\nThe southerners who came by land along the many bad roads through\r\nTennessee and Kentucky usually traveled with heavy, long-bodied\r\nwagons, drawn by four or six horses. [Footnote: Hist. of Grundy\r\nCounty, Ill., 149.] These family groups, crowding roads and fords,\r\nmarching towards the sunset, with the canvas-covered wagon, ancestor\r\nof the prairie-schooner of the later times, were typical of the\r\noverland migration. The poorer classes traveled on foot, sometimes\r\ncarrying their entire effects in a cart drawn by themselves.\r\n[Footnote: Niles' Register, XXI., 320.] Those of more means took\r\nhorses, cattle, and sheep, and sometimes sent their household goods\r\nby wagon or by steamboat up the Mississippi. [Footnote: Howells,\r\nLife in Ohio, 1813-1840, 86; Jones, Ill. and the West, 31; Hist, of\r\nGrundy County, Ill., 149.] The routes of travel to the western\r\ncountry were numerous. [Footnote: See map, page 226.] Prior to the\r\nopening of the Erie Canal the New England element either passed\r\nalong the Mohawk and the Genesee turnpike to Lake Erie, or crossed\r\nthe Hudson and followed the line of the Catskill turnpike to the\r\nheadwaters of the Allegheny, or, by way of Boston, took ship to New\r\nYork, Philadelphia, or Baltimore, in order to follow a more\r\nsoutherly route. In Pennsylvania the principal route was the old\r\nroad which, in a general way, followed the line that Forbes had cut\r\nin the French and Indian War from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh by way\r\nof Lancaster and Bedford. By this time the road had been made a\r\nturnpike through a large portion of its course. From Baltimore the\r\ntraveler followed a turnpike to Cumberland, on the Potomac, where\r\nbegan the old National Road across the mountains to Wheeling, on the\r\nOhio, with branches leading to Pittsburgh. This became one of the\r\ngreat arteries of western migration and commerce, connecting, as it\r\ndid at its eastern end, with the Shenandoah Valley, and thus\r\naffording access to the Ohio for large areas of Virginia. Other\r\nroutes lay through the passes of the Alleghenies, easily reached\r\nfrom the divide between the waters of North Carolina and of West\r\nVirginia. Saluda Gap, in northwestern South Carolina, led the way to\r\nthe great valley of eastern Tennessee. In Tennessee and Kentucky\r\nmany routes passed to the Ohio in the region of Cincinnati or\r\nLouisville.\r\n\r\nWhen the settler arrived at the waters of the Ohio, he either took a\r\nsteamboat or placed his possessions on a flatboat, or ark, and\r\nfloated down the river to his destination. From the upper waters of\r\nthe Allegheny many emigrants took advantage of the lumber-rafts,\r\nwhich were constructed from the pine forests of southwestern New\r\nYork, to float to the Ohio with themselves and their belongings.\r\nWith the advent of the steamboat these older modes of navigation\r\nwere, to a considerable extent, superseded. But navigation on the\r\nGreat Lakes had not sufficiently advanced to afford opportunity for\r\nany considerable movement of settlement, by this route, beyond Lake\r\nErie.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the decade the cost of reaching the west varied\r\ngreatly with the decrease in the transportation rates brought about\r\nby the competition of the Erie Canal, the improvement of the\r\nturnpikes, and the development of steamboat navigation. The expense\r\nof the long overland journey from New England, prior to the opening\r\nof the Erie Canal, made it extremely difficult for those without any\r\ncapital to reach the west. The stage rates on the Pennsylvania\r\nturnpike and the old National Road, prior to the opening of the Erie\r\nCanal, were about five or six dollars a hundred-weight from\r\nPhiladelphia or Baltimore to the Ohio River; the individual was\r\nregarded as so much freight. [Footnote: Evans, Pedestrians Tour,\r\n145.] To most of the movers, who drove their own teams and camped by\r\nthe wayside, however, the actual expense was simply that of\r\nproviding food for themselves and their horses on the road. The cost\r\nof moving by land a few years later is illustrated by the case of a\r\nMaryland family, consisting of fifteen persons, of whom five were\r\nslaves. They traveled about twenty miles a day, with a four-horse\r\nwagon, three hundred miles, to Wheeling, at an expense of seventy-\r\nfive dollars. [Footnote: Niles' Register, XLVIII., 242.] The expense\r\nof traveling by stage and steamboat from Philadelphia to St. Louis\r\nat the close of the decade was about fifty-five dollars for one\r\nperson; or by steamboat from New Orleans to St. Louis, thirty\r\ndollars, including food and lodging. For deck-passage, without food\r\nor lodging, the charge was only eight dollars. [Footnote: Ill.\r\nMonthly Magazine, II., 53.] In 1823 the cost of passage from\r\nCincinnati to New Orleans by steamboat was twenty-five dollars; from\r\nNew Orleans to Cincinnati, fifty dollars. [Footnote: Niles'\r\nRegister, XXV., 95.] In the early thirties one could go from New\r\nOrleans to Pittsburgh, as cabin passenger, for from thirty-five to\r\nforty-five dollars. [Footnote: Emigrants' and Travelers' Guide\r\nthrough the Valley of the Mississippi, 341.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE WEST (1820-1830)\r\n\r\n\r\nArrived at the nearest point to his destination on the Ohio, the\r\nemigrant either cut out a road to his new home or pushed up some\r\ntributary of that river in a keel-boat. If he was one of the poorer\r\nclasses, he became a squatter on the public lands, trusting to find\r\nin the profits of his farming the means of paying for his land. Not\r\nuncommonly, after clearing the land, he sold his improvements to the\r\nactual purchaser, under the customary usage or by pre-emption laws.\r\n[Footnote: Hall, Statistics of the West, 180; Kingdom, America, 56;\r\nPeck, New Guide for Emigrants to the West (1837), 119-132.] With the\r\nmoney thus secured he would purchase new land in a remoter area, and\r\nthus establish himself as an independent land-owner. Under the\r\ncredit system [Footnote: Emerick, Credit and the Public Domain.]\r\nwhich existed at the opening of the period, the settler purchased\r\nhis land in quantities of not less than one hundred and sixty acres\r\nat two dollars per acre, by a cash payment of fifty cents per acre\r\nand the rest in installments running over a period of four years;\r\nbut by the new law of 1820 the settler was permitted to buy as small\r\na tract as eighty acres from the government at a minimum price of a\r\ndollar and a quarter per acre, without credit. The price of labor in\r\nthe towns along the Ohio, coupled with the low cost of provisions,\r\nmade it possible for even a poor day-laborer from the East to\r\naccumulate the necessary amount to make his land-purchase.\r\n[Footnote: See, for example, Peck, New Guide for Emigrants to the\r\nWest (1837), 107-134; Bradbury, Travels, 286.]\r\n\r\nHaving in this way settled down either as a squatter or as a land-\r\nowner, the pioneer proceeded to hew out a clearing in the midst of\r\nthe forest. [Footnote: Kingdom, America, 10, 54, 63; Flint, Letters,\r\n206; McMaster, United States, V., 152-155; Howells, Life in Ohio,\r\n115.] Commonly he had selected his lands with reference to the value\r\nof the soil, as indicated by the character of the hardwoods, but\r\nthis meant that the labor of clearing was the more severe in good\r\nsoil. Under the sturdy strokes of his axe the light of day was let\r\ninto the little circle of cleared ground. [Footnote: Hall,\r\nStatistics of the West, 98, 101, 145.] With the aid of his\r\nneighbors, called together under the social attractions of a\r\n\"raising,\" with its inevitable accompaniment of whiskey and a\r\n\"frolic,\" he erected his log-cabin. \"America,\" wrote Birkbeck, \"was\r\nbred in a cabin.\" [Footnote: Birkbeck, Notes on Journey, 94.]\r\n\r\nHaving secured a foothold, the settler next proceeded to \"girdle\" or\r\n\"deaden\" an additional forest area, preparatory to his farming\r\noperations. This consisted in cutting a ring through the bark around\r\nthe lower portion of the trunk, to prevent the sap from rising. In a\r\nshort time the withered branches were ready for burning, and in the\r\nmidst of the stumps the first crop of corn and vegetables was\r\nplanted. Often the settler did not even burn the girdled trees, but\r\nplanted his crop under the dead foliage.\r\n\r\nIn regions nearer to the east, as in western New York, it was\r\nsometimes possible to repay a large portion of the cost of clearing\r\nby the sale of pot and pearl ashes extracted from the logs, which\r\nwere brought together into huge piles for burning. [Footnote: Life\r\nof Thurlow Weed (Autobiography), I., ii.] This was accomplished by a\r\n\"log-rolling,\" under the united efforts of the neighbors, as in the\r\ncase of the \"raising.\" More commonly in the west the logs were\r\nwasted by burning, except such as were split into rails, which, laid\r\none above another, made the zig-zag \"worm-fences\" for the protection\r\nof the fields of the pioneer.\r\n\r\nWhen a clearing was sold to a later comer, fifty or sixty dollars,\r\nin addition to the government price of land, was commonly charged\r\nfor forty acres, enclosed and partly cleared. [Footnote: Kingdom,\r\nAmerica, 10, 54.] It was estimated that the cost of a farm of three\r\nhundred and twenty acres at the edge of the prairie in Illinois, at\r\nthis time, would be divided as follows: for one hundred and sixty\r\nacres of prairie, two hundred dollars; for fencing it into four\r\nforty-acre fields with rail-fences, one hundred and sixty dollars;\r\nfor breaking it up with a plough, two dollars per acre, or three\r\nhundred and twenty dollars; eighty acres of timber land and eighty\r\nacres of pasture prairie, two hundred dollars. Thus, with cabins,\r\nstables, etc., it cost a little over a thousand dollars to secure an\r\nimproved farm of three hundred and twenty acres. [Footnote: J.M.\r\nPeck, Guide for Emigrants (1831), 183-188; cf. Birkbeck (London,\r\n1818), Letters, 45, 46, 69-73; S.H. Collins, Emigrant's Guide;\r\nTanner (publisher), View of the Valley of the Miss. (1834), 232; J.\r\nWoods, Two Years' Residence, 146, 172.] But the mass of the early\r\nsettlers were too poor to afford such an outlay, and were either\r\nsquatters within a little clearing, or owners of eighty acres, which\r\nthey hoped to increase by subsequent purchase. Since they worked\r\nwith the labor of their own hands and that of their sons, the cash\r\noutlay was practically limited to the original cost of the lands and\r\narticles of husbandry. The cost of an Indiana farm of eighty acres\r\nof land, with two horses, two or three cows, a few hogs and sheep,\r\nand farming utensils, was estimated at about four hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar skill required of the axeman who entered the hardwood\r\nforests, together with readiness to undergo the privations of the\r\nlife, made the backwoodsman in a sense an expert engaged in a\r\nspecial calling. [Footnote: J. Hall, Statistics of the West, 101;\r\ncf. Chastellux, Travels in North America (London, 1787), I., 44.]\r\nFrequently he was the descendant of generations of pioneers, who, on\r\nsuccessive frontiers, from the neighborhood of the Atlantic coast\r\ntowards the interior, had cut and burned the forest, fought the\r\nIndians, and pushed forward the line of civilization. He bore the\r\nmarks of the struggle in his face, made sallow by living in the\r\nshade of the forest, \"shut from the common air,\" [Footnote:\r\nBirkbeck, Notes on Journey, 105-114.] and in a constitution often\r\nracked by malarial fever. Dirt and squalor were too frequently found\r\nin the squatter's cabin, and education and the refinements of life\r\nwere denied to him. Often shiftless and indolent, in the intervals\r\nbetween his tasks of forest-felling he was fonder of hunting than of\r\na settled agricultural life. With his rifle he eked out his\r\nsustenance, and the peltries furnished him a little ready cash. His\r\nfew cattle grazed in the surrounding forest, and his hogs fed on its\r\nmast.\r\n\r\nThe backwoodsman of this type represented the outer edge of the\r\nadvance of civilization. Where settlement was closer, co-operative\r\nactivity possible, and little villages, with the mill and retail\r\nstores, existed, conditions of life were ameliorated, and a better\r\ntype of pioneer was found. Into such regions circuit-riders and\r\nwandering preachers carried the beginnings of church organization,\r\nand schools were started. But the frontiersmen proper constituted a\r\nmoving class, ever ready to sell out their clearings in [Footnote:\r\nBabcock, Forty Years of Pioneer Life (\"Journals and Correspondence\r\nof J.M. Peck\"), 101.] order to press on to a new frontier, where\r\ngame more abounded, soil was reported to be better, and where the\r\nforest furnished a welcome retreat from the uncongenial\r\nencroachments of civilization. If, however, he was thrifty and\r\nforehanded, the backwoodsman remained on his clearing, improving his\r\nfarm and sharing in the change from wilderness life.\r\n\r\nBehind the type of the backwoodsman came the type of the pioneer\r\nfarmer. Equipped with a little capital, he often, as we have seen,\r\npurchased the clearing, and thus avoided some of the initial\r\nhardships of pioneer life. In the course of a few years, as saw-\r\nmills were erected, frame-houses took the place of the log-cabins;\r\nthe rough clearing, with its stumps, gave way to well-tilled fields;\r\norchards were planted; live-stock roamed over the enlarged clearing;\r\nand an agricultural surplus was ready for export. Soon the\r\nadventurous speculator offered corner lots in a new town-site, and\r\nthe rude beginnings of a city were seen.\r\n\r\nThus western occupation advanced in a series of waves: [Footnote:\r\nJ.M. Peck, New Guide to the West (Cincinnati, 1848), chap. iv.; T.\r\nFlint, Geography and Hist. of the Western States, 350 et seq.; J.\r\nFlint, Letters from America, 206; cf. Turner, Significance of the\r\nFrontier in American History, in Am. Hist. Assoc., Report 1893, p.\r\n214; McMaster, United States, V., 152-160.] the Indian was sought by\r\nthe fur-trader; the fur-trader was followed by the frontiersman,\r\nwhose live-stock exploited the natural grasses and the acorns of the\r\nforest; next came the wave of primitive agriculture, followed by\r\nmore intensive farming and city life. All the stages of social\r\ndevelopment went on under the eye of the traveler as he passed from\r\nthe frontier towards the east. Such were the forces which were\r\nsteadily pushing their way into the American wilderness, as they had\r\npushed for generations.\r\n\r\nWhile thus the frontier folk spread north of the Ohio and up the\r\nMissouri, a different movement was in progress in the Gulf region of\r\nthe west. In the beginning precisely the same type of occupation was\r\nto be seen: the poorer classes of southern emigrants cut out their\r\nclearings along rivers that flowed to the Gulf and to the lower\r\nMississippi, and, with the opening of this decade, went in\r\nincreasing numbers into Texas, where enterprising Americans secured\r\nconcessions from the Mexican government. [Footnote: Garrison, Texas,\r\nchaps, xiii., xiv.; Wooten (editor), Comprehensive Hist. of Texas,\r\nI., chaps. viii., ix.; Texas State Hist. Assoc., Quarterly, VII.,\r\n29, 289; Bugbee, \"Texas Frontier,\" in Southern Hist. Assoc.,\r\nPublications, IV., 106.]\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the most recently occupied area was but thinly\r\nsettled. It represented the movement of the backwoodsman, with axe\r\nand rifle, advancing to the conquest of the forest. But closer to\r\nthe old settlements a more highly developed agriculture was to be\r\nseen. Hodgson, in 1821, describes plantations in northern Alabama in\r\nlands ceded by the Indians in 1818. Though settled less than two\r\nyears, there were within a few miles five schools and four places of\r\nworship. One plantation had one hundred acres in cotton and one\r\nhundred and ten in corn, although a year and a half before it was\r\nwilderness. [Footnote: Hodgson, Letters from North Am., I., 269; see\r\nRiley (editor), \"Autobiography of Lincecum,\" in Miss. Hist. Soc.,\r\nPublications, VIII., 443, for the wanderings of a southern pioneer\r\nin the recently opened Indian lands of Georgia and the southwest in\r\nthese years.]\r\n\r\nBut while this population of log-cabin pioneers was entering the\r\nGulf plains, caravans of slave-holding planters were advancing from\r\nthe seaboard to the occupation of the cotton-lands of the same\r\nregion. As the free farmers of the interior had been replaced in the\r\nupland country of the south by the slaveholding planters, so now the\r\nfrontiersmen of the southwest were pushed back from the more fertile\r\nlands into the pine hills and barrens. Not only was the pioneer\r\nunable to refuse the higher price which was offered him for his\r\nclearing, but, in the competitive bidding of the public land sales,\r\n[Footnote: Northern Ala. (published by Smith & De Land), 249; Brown,\r\nHist. of Ala., 129-131; Brown, Lower South, 24-26.] the wealthier\r\nplanter secured the desirable soils. Social forces worked to the\r\nsame end. When the pioneer invited his slave-holding neighbor to a\r\n\"raising,\" it grated on his sense of the fitness of things to have\r\nthe guest appear with gloves, directing the gang of slaves which he\r\ncontributed to the function. [Footnote: Smedes, A Southern Planter,\r\n67.] Little by little, therefore, the old pioneer life tended to\r\nretreat to the less desirable lands, leaving the slave-holder in\r\npossession of the rich \"buck-shot\" soils that spread over central\r\nAlabama and Mississippi and the fat alluvium that lined the eastern\r\nbank of the Mississippi. Even to-day the counties of dense Negro\r\npopulation reveal the results of this movement of segregation.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the picture of the advance of the pioneer farmer,\r\nbearing his household goods in his canvas-covered wagon to his new\r\nhome across the Ohio, must therefore be placed the picture of the\r\nsouthern planter crossing through the forests of western Georgia,\r\nAlabama, and Mississippi, or passing over the free state of Illinois\r\nto the Missouri Valley, in his family carriage, with servants, packs\r\nof hunting-dogs, and a train of slaves, their nightly camp-fires\r\nlighting up the wilderness where so recently the Indian hunter had\r\nheld possession. [Footnote: Hodgson, Letters from North Am., I.,\r\n138; Niles' Register, XLIV., 222; Smedes, A Southern Planter, 52-54;\r\nFlint, Geography and History of the Western States, II., 350, 379;\r\nBernhard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Travels, II., chaps. xvi., xvii.]\r\n\r\nBut this new society had a characteristic western flavor. The old\r\npatriarchal type of slavery along the seaboard was modified by the\r\nwestern conditions in the midst of which the slave-holding interest\r\nwas now lodged. Planters, as well as pioneer farmers, were\r\nexploiting the wilderness and building a new society under\r\ncharacteristic western influences. Rude strength, a certain\r\ncoarseness of life, and aggressiveness characterized this society,\r\nas it did the whole of the Mississippi Valley. [Footnote: Baldwin,\r\nFlush Times in Ala.; cf. Gilmer, Sketches of Georgia, etc.] Slavery\r\nfurnished a new ingredient for western forces to act upon. The\r\nsystem took on a more commercial tinge: the plantation had to be\r\ncleared and made profitable as a purely business enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe slaves were purchased in considerable numbers from the older\r\nstates instead of being inherited in the family. Slave-dealers\r\npassed to the southwest, with their coffles of Negroes brought from\r\nthe outworn lands of the old south. It was estimated in 1832 that\r\nVirginia annually exported six thousand slaves for sale to other\r\nstates. [Footnote: Collins, Domestic Slave Trade, 50.] An English\r\ntraveler reported in 1823 that every year from ten to fifteen\r\nthousand slaves were sold from the states of Delaware, Maryland, and\r\nVirginia, and sent to the south. [Footnote: Blane, Excursion through\r\nU.S., 226; Hodgson, Letters from North Am., I., 194.] At the same\r\ntime, illicit importation of slaves through New Orleans reached an\r\namount estimated at from ten to fifteen thousand a year. [Footnote:\r\nCollins, Domestic Slave Trade, 44.] It was not until the next decade\r\nthat this incoming tide of slaves reached its height, but by 1830 it\r\nwas clearly marked and was already transforming the southwest.\r\nMississippi doubled the number of her slaves in the decade, and\r\nAlabama nearly trebled hers. In the same period the number of slaves\r\nof Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina increased but slightly.\r\n\r\nAs the discussion of the south has already made clear, the\r\nexplanation of this transformation of the southwest into a region of\r\nslave-holding planters lies in the spread of cotton into the Gulf\r\nplains. In 1811 this region raised but five million pounds of\r\ncotton; ten years later its product was sixty million pounds; and in\r\n1826 its fields were white with a crop of over one hundred and fifty\r\nmillion pounds. It soon outstripped the seaboard south. Alabama,\r\nwhich had practically no cotton crop in 1811, and only ten million\r\npounds in 1821, had in 1834 eighty-five million pounds, [Footnote:\r\nSee table of cotton crop, ante, p. 47.] a larger crop than either\r\nSouth Carolina or Georgia.\r\n\r\nSoon after 1830 the differences between the northern and southern\r\nportions of the Mississippi Valley were still further accentuated.\r\n(1) From New York and New England came a tide of settlement, in the\r\nthirties, which followed the Erie Canal and the Great Lakes, and\r\nbegan to occupy the prairie lands which had been avoided by the\r\nsouthern axemen. This region then became an extension of the greater\r\nNew England already to be seen in New York. (2) The southern\r\npioneers in the northwest formed a transitional zone between this\r\nnorthern area and the slave states south of the Ohio. (3) In the\r\nGulf plains a greater south was in process of formation, but by no\r\nmeans completely established. As yet it was a mixture of pioneer and\r\nplanter, slave and free, profoundly affected by its western traits.\r\n[Footnote: Curry, \"A Settlement in East Ala.,\" in Am. Hist.\r\nMagazine, II., 203.]\r\n\r\nThe different states of the south were steadily sending in bands of\r\ncolonists. In Alabama, for example, the Georgians settled, as a\r\nrule, in the east; the Tennesseeans, moving from the great bend of\r\nthe Tennessee River, were attracted to the northern and middle\r\nsection; and the Virginians and Carolinians went to the west and\r\nsouthwest, following the bottom-lands near the rivers. [Footnote:\r\nBrown, Hist. of Ala., 129, 130; Northern Ala. (published bv Smith &\r\nDe Land), pt. iv., 243 et seq.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWESTERN COMMERCE AND IDEALS (1820-1830)\r\n\r\n\r\nBy 1820 the west had developed the beginnings of many of the cities\r\nwhich have since ruled over the region. Buffalo and Detroit were\r\nhardly more than villages until the close of this period. They\r\nwaited for the rise of steam navigation on the Great Lakes and for\r\nthe opening of the prairies. Cleveland, also, was but a hamlet\r\nduring most of the decade; but by 1830 the construction of the canal\r\nconnecting the Cuyahoga with the Scioto increased its prosperity,\r\nand its harbor began to profit by its natural advantages. [Footnote:\r\nWhittlesey, Early Hist. of Cleveland, 456; Kennedy, Hist. of\r\nCleveland, chap. viii.] Chicago and Milwaukee were mere fur-trading\r\nstations in the Indian country. Pittsburgh, at the head of the Ohio,\r\nwas losing its old pre-eminence as the gateway to the west, but was\r\nfinding recompense in the development of its manufactures. By 1830\r\nits population was about twelve thousand. [Footnote: Thurston,\r\nPittsburg and Allegheny in the Centennial Year, 61.] Foundries,\r\nrolling-mills, nail-factories, steam-engine shops, and distilleries\r\nwere busily at work, and the city, dingy with the smoke of soft\r\ncoal, was already dubbed the \"young Manchester\" or the \"Birmingham\"\r\nof America. By 1830 Wheeling had intercepted much of the overland\r\ntrade and travel to the Ohio, profiting by the old National Road and\r\nthe wagon trade from Baltimore. [Footnote: Martin, Gazetteer of Va.,\r\n407.]\r\n\r\nCincinnati was rapidly rising to the position of the \"Queen City of\r\nthe West.\" Situated where the river reached with a great bend\r\ntowards the interior of the northwest, in the rich farming country\r\nbetween the two Miamis, and opposite the Licking River, it was the\r\ncommercial center of a vast and fertile region of Ohio and Kentucky;\r\n[Footnote: Melish, Information to Emigrants, 108.] and by 1830, with\r\na population of nearly twenty-five thousand souls, it was the\r\nlargest city of the west, with the exception of New Orleans. The\r\ncenter of steamboat-building, it also received extensive imports of\r\ngoods from the east and exported the surplus crops of Ohio and\r\nadjacent parts of Kentucky. Its principal industry, however, was\r\npork-packing, from which it won the name of \"Porkopolis\" [Footnote:\r\nDrake and Mansfield, Cincinnati in 1826, p. 70; Winter in the West,\r\nI., 115.] Louisville, at the falls of the Ohio, was an important\r\nplace of trans-shipment, and the export center for large quantities\r\nof tobacco. There were considerable manufactures of rope and\r\nbagging, products of the Kentucky hemp-fields; and new cotton and\r\nwoolen factories were struggling for existence. [Footnote: Durrett,\r\nCentenary of Louisville (Filson Club, Publications, No. 8), 50-101;\r\nLouisville Directory, 1832, p. 131.] St. Louis occupied a unique\r\nposition, as the entrepot of the important fur-trade of the upper\r\nMississippi and the vast water system of the Missouri, as well as\r\nthe outfitting-point for the Missouri settlements. It was the\r\ncapital of the far west, and the commercial center for Illinois. Its\r\npopulation at the close of the decade was about six thousand.\r\n\r\nOnly a few villages lay along the Mississippi below St. Louis until\r\nthe traveler reached New Orleans, the emporium of the whole\r\nMississippi Valley. As yet the direct effect of the Erie Canal was\r\nchiefly limited to the state of New York. The great bulk of western\r\nexports passed down the tributaries of the Mississippi to this city,\r\nwhich was, therefore, the center of foreign exports for the valley,\r\nas well as the port from which the coastwise trade in the products\r\nof the whole interior departed. In 1830 its population was nearly\r\nfifty thousand.\r\n\r\nThe rise of an agricultural surplus was transforming the west and\r\npreparing a new influence in the nation. It was this surplus and the\r\ndemand for markets that developed the cities just mentioned. As they\r\ngrew, the price of land in their neighborhood increased; roads\r\nradiated into the surrounding country; and farmers, whose crops had\r\nbeen almost worthless from the lack of transportation facilities,\r\nnow found it possible to market their surplus at a small profit.\r\nWhile the west was thus learning the advantages of a home market,\r\nthe extension of cotton and sugar cultivation in the south and\r\nsouthwest gave it a new and valuable market. More and more, the\r\nplanters came to rely upon the northwest for their food supplies and\r\nfor the mules and horses for their fields. Cotton became the\r\nengrossing interest of the plantation belt, and, while the full\r\neffects of this differentiation of industry did not appear in the\r\ndecade of this volume, the beginnings were already visible.\r\n[Footnote: Callender, \"Early Transportation and Banking Enterprises\r\nof the States,\" in Quarterly Journal of Econ., XVII., 3-54.] In\r\n1835, Pitkin [Footnote: Pitkin, Statistical View (1835), 534.]\r\nreckoned the value of the domestic and foreign exports of the\r\ninterior as far in excess of the whole exports of the United States\r\nin 1790. Within forty years the development of the interior had\r\nbrought about the economic independence of the United States.\r\n\r\nDuring most of the decade the merchandise to supply the interior was\r\nbrought laboriously across the mountains by the Pennsylvania\r\nturnpikes and the old National Road; or, in the case of especially\r\nheavy freight, was carried along the Atlantic coast into the gulf\r\nand up the Mississippi and Ohio by steamboats. The cost of\r\ntransportation in the wagon trade from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh\r\nand Baltimore to Wheeling placed a heavy tax upon the consumer.\r\n[Footnote: Niles' Register, XX., 180.] In 1817 the freight charge\r\nfrom Philadelphia to Pittsburgh was sometimes as high as seven to\r\nten dollars a hundredweight; a few years later it became from four\r\nto six dollars; and in 1823 it had fallen to three dollars. It took\r\na month to wagon merchandise from Baltimore to central Ohio.\r\nTransportation companies, running four-horse freight wagons,\r\nconducted a regular business on these turn-pikes between the eastern\r\nand western states. In 1820 over three thousand wagons ran between\r\nPhiladelphia and Pittsburgh, transporting merchandise valued at\r\nabout eighteen million dollars annually. [Footnote: Birkbeck,\r\nJourney from Va., 128; Ogden, Letters from the West, 8; Cobbett,\r\nYear's Residence, 337; Evans, Pedestrious Tour, 145; Philadelphia in\r\n1824, 45; Searight, Old Pike, 107, 112; Mills, Treatise on Inland\r\nNavigation (1820), 89, 90, 93, 95-97; Journal of Polit. Econ.,\r\nVIII., 36.]\r\n\r\nThe construction of the National Road reduced freight rates to\r\nnearly one-half what they were at the close of the War of 1812; and\r\nthe introduction of steam navigation from New Orleans up the\r\nMississippi cut water-rates by that route to one-third of the former\r\ncharge. [Footnote: Annals of Cong., 18 Cong., I Sess., I., 991; cf.\r\nFearon, Sketches, 260; Niles' Register, XXV., 95; Cincinnati\r\nChristian Journal, July 27, 1830.] Nevertheless, there was a crying\r\nneed for internal improvements, and particularly for canals, to\r\nprovide an outlet for the increasing products of the west. \"Even in\r\nthe country where I reside, not eighty miles from tidewater,\" said\r\nTucker, [Footnote: Annals of Cong., 15 Cong., I Sess., I., 1126.] of\r\nVirginia, in 1818, \"it takes the farmer one bushel of wheat to pay\r\nthe expense of carrying two to a seaport town.\"\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the crop, as compared with its value, practically\r\nprevented transportation by land farther than a hundred miles.\r\n[Footnote: McMaster, United States, III., 464.] It is this that\r\nhelps to explain the attention which the interior first gave to\r\nmaking whiskey and raising live-stock; the former carried the crop\r\nin a small bulk with high value, while the live-stock could walk to\r\na market. Until after the War of 1812, the cattle of the Ohio Valley\r\nwere driven to the seaboard, chiefly to Philadelphia or Baltimore.\r\nTravelers were astonished to see on the highway droves of four or\r\nfive thousand hogs, going to an eastern market. It was estimated\r\nthat over a hundred thousand hogs were driven east annually from\r\nKentucky alone. Kentucky hog-drivers also passed into Tennessee,\r\nVirginia, and the Carolinas with their droves. [Footnote: Life of\r\nEphraim Cutler, 89; Birkbeck, Journey, 24.; Blane, Excursion through\r\nU. S. (London, 1824), 90; Atlantic Monthly, XXVI., 170.] The swine\r\nlived on the nuts and acorns of the forest; thus they were\r\npeculiarly suited to pioneer conditions. At first the cattle were\r\ntaken to the plantations of the Potomac to fatten for Baltimore and\r\nPhiladelphia, much in the same way that, in recent times, the cattle\r\nof the Great Plains are brought to the feeding-grounds in the corn\r\nbelt of Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa. [Footnote: Michaux, Travels,\r\n191: Palmer, Journal of Travels, 36] Towards the close of the\r\ndecade, however, the feeding-grounds shifted into Ohio, and the\r\npork-packing industry, as we have seen, found its center at\r\nCincinnati, [Footnote:  Hall, Statistics of the West (1836), 145-\r\n147.] the most important source of supply for the hams and bacon and\r\nsalt pork which passed down the Mississippi to furnish a large share\r\nof the plantation food. From Kentucky and the rest of the Ohio\r\nValley droves of mules and horses passed through the Tennessee\r\nValley to the south to supply the plantations. Statistics at\r\nCumberland Gap for 1828 gave the value of live-stock passing the\r\nturnpike gate there at $1,167,000. [Footnote: Emigrants' and\r\nTravellers' Guide to the West (1834), 194.] Senator Hayne, of South\r\nCarolina, declared that in 1824 the south was supplied from the\r\nwest, through Saluda Gap, with live-stock, horses, cattle, and hogs\r\nto the amount of over a million dollars a year. [Footnote: Speech in\r\nSenate in 1832, Register of Debates in Cong., VIII., pt. i., 80; cf.\r\nAnnals of Cong., 18 Cong., i Sess., I., 1411.]\r\n\r\nBut the outlet from the west over the roads to the east and south\r\nwas but a subordinate element in the internal commerce. Down the\r\nMississippi floated a multitude of heavily freighted craft: lumber\r\nrafts from the Allegheny, the old-time arks, with cattle, flour, and\r\nbacon, hay-boats, keel-boats, and skiffs, all mingled with the\r\nsteamboats which plied the western waters. [Footnote: Flint,\r\nRecollections of the Last Ten Years, 101-110; E. S. Thomas,\r\nReminiscences, I., 290-293; Hall, Statistics of the West (1836),\r\n236; Howells, Life in Ohio, 85; Schultz, Travels, 129; Hulbert,\r\nHistoric Highways, IX., chaps, iii., iv., v.] Flatboatmen, raftsmen,\r\nand deck-hands constituted a turbulent and reckless population,\r\nliving on the country through which they passed, fighting and\r\ndrinking in true \"half-horse, half-alligator\" style. Prior to the\r\nsteamboat, all of the commerce from New Orleans to the upper country\r\nwas carried on in about twenty barges, averaging a hundred tons\r\neach, and making one trip a year. Although the steamboat did not\r\ndrive out the other craft, it revolutionized the commerce of the\r\nriver. Whereas it had taken the keel-boats thirty to forty days to\r\ndescend from Louisville to New Orleans, and about ninety days to\r\nascend the fifteen hundred miles of navigation by poling and warping\r\nup-stream, the steamboat had shortened the time, by 1822, to seven\r\ndays down and sixteen days up. [Footnote: Annals of Cong., 17 Gong.,\r\n2 Sess., 407; McMaster, United States, V., 166; National Gazette,\r\nSeptember 26, 1823 (list of steamboats, rates of passage, estimate\r\nof products); Blane, Excursion through the U. S., 119; Niles'\r\nRegister, XXV., 95.] As the steamboats ascended the various\r\ntributaries of the Mississippi to gather the products of the growing\r\nwest, the pioneers came more and more to realize the importance of\r\nthe invention. They resented the idea of the monopoly which Pulton\r\nand Livingston wished to enforce prior to the decision of Chief-\r\nJustice Marshall, in the case of Gibbons vs. Ogden--a decision of\r\nvital interest to the whole interior. [Footnote: Thomas, Travels\r\nthrough the Western Country, 62; Alexandria Herald, June 23, 1817.]\r\n\r\nThey saw in the steamboat a symbol of their own development. A\r\nwriter in the Western Monthly Review, [Footnote: Timothy Flint's\r\nWestern Monthly Review (May, 1827), I., 25; William Bullock, Sketch\r\nof a Journey, 132.] unconsciously expressed the very spirit of the\r\nself-contented, hustling, materialistic west in these words: \"An\r\nAtlantic cit, who talks of us under the name of backwoodsmen, would\r\nnot believe, that such fairy structures of oriental gorgeousness and\r\nsplendor, as the Washington, the Florida, the Walk in the Water, the\r\nLady of the Lake, etc. etc., had ever existed in the imaginative\r\nbrain of a romancer, much less, that they were actually in\r\nexistence, rushing down the Mississippi, as on the wings of the\r\nwind, or plowing up between the forests, and walking against the\r\nmighty current 'as things of life,' bearing speculators, merchants,\r\ndandies, fine ladies, every thing real, and every thing affected, in\r\nthe form of humanity, with pianos, and stocks of novels, and cards,\r\nand dice, and flirting, and love-making, and drinking, and\r\nchampagne, and on the deck, perhaps, three hundred fellows, who have\r\nseen alligators, and neither fear whiskey, nor gun-powder. A\r\nsteamboat, coming from New Orleans, brings to the remotest villages\r\nof our streams, and the very doors of the cabins, a little Paris, a\r\nsection of Broadway, or a slice of Philadelphia, to ferment in the\r\nminds of our young people, the innate propensity for fashions and\r\nfinery. Within a day's journey of us, three distinct canals are in\r\nrespectable progress towards completion. . . . Cincinnati will soon\r\nbe the center of the 'celestial empire,' as the Chinese say; and\r\ninstead of encountering the storms, the sea sickness, and dangers of\r\na passage from the gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic, whenever the Erie\r\ncanal shall be completed, the opulent southern planters will take\r\ntheir families, their dogs and parrots, through a world of forests,\r\nfrom New Orleans to New York, giving us a call by the way. When they\r\nare more acquainted with us, their voyage will often terminate\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1830 the produce which reached New Orleans from the Mississippi\r\nValley amounted to about twenty-six million dollars. [Footnote:\r\nQuarterly Journal of Economics, XVII., 20; Pitkin, Statistical View\r\n(ed. of 1835), 534-536.] In 1822 three million dollars' worth of\r\ngoods was estimated to have passed the Falls of the Ohio on the way\r\nto market, representing much of the surplus of the Ohio Valley. Of\r\nthis, pork amounted to $1,000,000 in value; flour to $900,000;\r\ntobacco to $600,000; and whiskey to $500,000. [Footnote: National\r\nRepublican, March 7, 1823; cf. National Gazette, September 26, 1823;\r\nBlane, Excursion through the U. S., 119.] The inventory of products\r\nreveals the Mississippi Valley as a vast colonial society, producing\r\nthe raw materials of a simple and primitive agriculture. The\r\nbeginnings of manufacture in the cities, however, promised to bring\r\nabout a movement for industrial independence in the west. In spite\r\nof evidences of growing wealth, there was such a decline in\r\nagricultural prices that, for the farmer who did not live on the\r\nhighways of commerce, it was almost unprofitable to raise wheat for\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\nAn Ohio pioneer of this time relates that at the beginning of the\r\ndecade fifty cents a bushel was a great price for wheat at the\r\nriver; and as two horses and a man were required for four days to\r\nmake the journey of thirty-five miles to the Ohio, in good weather,\r\nwith thirty-five or forty bushels of wheat, and a great deal longer\r\nif the roads were bad, it was not to be expected that the farmer\r\ncould realize more than twenty-five cents in cash for it. But there\r\nwas no sale for it in cash. The nominal price for it in trade was\r\nusually thirty cents. [Footnote: Howells, Life in Ohio, 138; see\r\nM'Culloch, Commercial Dictionary, I., 683,684; Hazard, U.S.\r\nCommercial and Statistical Register, I., 251; O'Reilly, Sketches of\r\nRochester, 362.] When wheat brought twenty-five cents a bushel in\r\nIllinois in 1825, it sold at over eighty cents in Petersburg,\r\nVirginia, and flour was six dollars a barrel at Charleston, South\r\nCarolina. [Footnote: Niles' Register, XXIX, 165.]\r\n\r\nThese are the economic conditions that assist in understanding the\r\npolitical attitude of western leaders like Henry Clay and Andrew\r\nJackson. The cry of the east for protection to infant industries was\r\nswelled by the little cities of the west, and the demand for a home\r\nmarket found its strongest support beyond the Alleghenies. Internal\r\nimprovements and lower rates of transportation were essential to the\r\nprosperity of the westerners. Largely a debtor class, in need of\r\ncapital, credit, and an expansion of the currency, they resented\r\nattempts to restrain the reckless state banking which their optimism\r\nfostered.\r\n\r\nBut the political ideals and actions of the west are explained by\r\nsocial quite as much as by economic forces. It was certain that this\r\nsociety, where equality and individualism flourished, where\r\nassertive democracy was supreme, where impatience with the old order\r\nof things was a ruling passion, would demand control of the\r\ngovernment, would resent the rule of the trained statesmen and\r\nofficial classes, and would fight nominations by congressional\r\ncaucus and the continuance of presidential dynasties. Besides its\r\nsusceptibility to change, the west had generated, from its Indian\r\nfighting, forest-felling, and expansion, a belligerency and a\r\nlargeness of outlook with regard to the nation's territorial\r\ndestiny. As the pioneer, widening the ring-wall of his clearing in\r\nthe midst of the stumps and marshes of the wilderness, had a vision\r\nof the lofty buildings and crowded streets of a future city, so the\r\nwest as a whole developed ideals of the future of the common man,\r\nand of the grandeur and expansion of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe west was too new a section to have developed educational\r\nfacilities to any large extent. The pioneers' poverty, as well as\r\nthe traditions of the southern interior from which they so largely\r\ncame, discouraged extensive expenditures for public schools.\r\n[Footnote: McMaster, United States, V., 370-372.] In Kentucky and\r\nTennessee the more prosperous planters had private tutors, often New\r\nEngland collegians, for their children. For example, Amos Kendall,\r\nlater postmaster-general, was tutor in Henry Clay's family. So-\r\ncalled colleges were numerous, some of them fairly good. In 1830 a\r\nwriter made a survey of higher education in the whole western\r\ncountry and reported twenty-eight institutions, with seven hundred\r\nand sixty-six graduates and fourteen hundred and thirty\r\nundergraduates. Less than forty thousand volumes were recorded in\r\nthe college and \"social\" libraries of the entire Mississippi Valley.\r\n[Footnote: Am. Quarterly Register (November, 1830), III., 127-131.]\r\nVery few students went from the west to eastern colleges; but the\r\nfoundations of public education had been laid in the land grants for\r\ncommon schools and universities. For the present this fund was\r\ngenerally misappropriated and wasted, or worse. Nevertheless, the\r\nideal of a democratic education was held up in the first\r\nconstitution of Indiana, making it the duty of the legislature to\r\nprovide for \"a general system of education, ascending in a regular\r\ngraduation from township schools to a State university, wherein\r\ntuition shall be gratis, and equally open to all.\" [Footnote: Poore,\r\nCharters and Constitutions, pt. i., 508 (art. ix., sec. 2 of\r\nConstitution of Ind., 1816).]\r\n\r\nLiterature did not flourish in the west, although the newspaper\r\npress [Footnote: W. H. Perrin, Pioneer Press of Ky. (Filson Club\r\nPublications).] followed closely after the retreating savage; many\r\nshort-lived periodicals were founded, [Footnote: Venable, Beginnings\r\nof Literary Culture in the Ohio Valley, chap, iii.; W. B. Cairns,\r\nDevelopment of American Literature from 1815 to 1833, in University\r\nof Wis., Bulletin (Phil, and Lit. Series), I., 60-63.] and writers\r\nlike Timothy Flint and James Hall were not devoid of literary\r\nability. Lexington, in Kentucky, and Cincinnati made rival claims to\r\nbe the \"Athens of the West.\" In religion, the west was partial to\r\nthose denominations which prevailed in the democratic portions of\r\nthe older sections. Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians took the\r\nlead. [Footnote: Am. Quarterly Register, III., 135 (November, 1830);\r\nSchermerhorn and Mills, View of U. S. West of the Alleghany\r\nMountains (Hartford, 1814); Home Missionary, 1829, pp. 78, 79; 1830,\r\np. 172; McMaster, United States, IV., 550-555.]\r\n\r\nThe religious life of the west frequently expressed itself in the\r\nform of emotional gatherings, in the camp-meetings and the revivals,\r\nwhere the rude, unlettered, but deeply religious backwoods preachers\r\nmoved their large audiences with warnings of the wrath of God.\r\nMuscular Christianity was personified in the circuit-rider, who,\r\nwith his saddle-bags and Bible, threaded the dreary trails through\r\nthe forest from settlement to settlement. From the responsiveness of\r\nthe west to religious excitement, it was easy to perceive that here\r\nwas a region capable of being swayed in large masses by enthusiasm.\r\nThese traits of the camp-meeting were manifested later in political\r\ncampaigns.\r\n\r\nThus this society beyond the mountains, recruited from all the older\r\nstates and bound together by the Mississippi, constituted a region\r\nswayed for the most part by common impulses. By the march of the\r\nwesterners away from their native states to the public domain of the\r\nnation, and by their organization as territories of the United\r\nStates, they lost that state particularism which distinguished many\r\nof the old commonwealths of the coast. The section was nationalistic\r\nand democratic to the core. The west admired the self-made man and\r\nwas ready to follow its hero with the enthusiasm of a section more\r\nresponsive to personality than to the programmes of trained\r\nstatesmen. It was a self-confident section, believing in its right\r\nto share in government, and troubled by no doubts of its capacity to\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE FAR WEST (1820-1830)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the decade of which we write, more than two-thirds of the present\r\narea of the United States was Indian country--a vast wilderness\r\nstretching from the Great Lakes to the Pacific Ocean. East of the\r\nMississippi, the pioneers had taken possession of the hardwoods of\r\nthe Ohio, but over the prairies between them and the Great Lakes the\r\nwild flowers and grasses grew rank and undisturbed. To the north,\r\nacross Michigan and Wisconsin, spread the somber, white-pine\r\nwilderness, interlaced with hardwoods, which swept in ample zone\r\nalong the Great Lakes, and, in turn, faded into the treeless expanse\r\nof the prairies beyond the Mississippi. To the south, in the Gulf\r\nplains, Florida was, for the most part, a wilderness; and, as we\r\nhave seen, great areas of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia were\r\nstill unoccupied by civilization.\r\n\r\nWest of the Mississippi lay a huge new world--an ocean of grassy\r\nprairie that rolled far to the west, till it reached the zone where\r\ninsufficient rainfall transformed it into the arid plains, which\r\nstretched away to the foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains. Over this\r\nvast waste, equal in area to France, Germany, Spain, Portugal,\r\nAustria-Hungary, Italy, Denmark, and Belgium combined, a land where\r\nnow wheat and corn fields and grazing herds produce much of the food\r\nsupply for the larger part of America and for great areas of Europe,\r\nroamed the bison and the Indian hunter. Beyond this, the Rocky\r\nMountains and the Sierra Nevadas, enclosing high plateaus, heaved up\r\ntheir vast bulk through nearly a thousand miles from east to west,\r\nconcealing untouched treasures of silver and gold. The great valleys\r\nof the Pacific coast in Oregon and California held but a sparse\r\npopulation of Indian traders, a few Spanish missions, and scattered\r\nherdsmen.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of Monroe's presidency, the Pacific coast was still\r\nin dispute between England, Spain, Russia, and the United States.\r\nHolding to all of Texas, Spain also raised her flag over her\r\ncolonists who spread from Mexico along the valley of the Rio Grande\r\nto Santa Fe, and she claimed the great unoccupied wilderness of\r\nmountain and desert comprising the larger portion of Colorado,\r\nArizona, Utah, and Nevada, as well as California. In the decade of\r\n1820-1830, fur-traders threaded the dark and forbidding defiles of\r\nthe mountains, unfolded the secrets of the Great Basin, and found\r\ntheir way across the Rockies to California and Oregon; the\r\ngovernment undertook diplomatic negotiations to safeguard American\r\nrights on the Pacific, and extended a line of forts well into the\r\nIndian country; while far-seeing statesmen on the floor of Congress\r\nchallenged the nation to fulfill its destiny by planting its\r\nsettlements boldly beyond the Rocky Mountains on the shores of the\r\nPacific. It was a call to the lodgment of American power on that\r\nocean, the mastery of which is to determine the future relations of\r\nAsiatic and European civilizations. [Footnote: Cf. Babcock, Am.\r\nNationality (Am. Nation, XIII.), chap. xv.]\r\n\r\nA survey of the characteristics of the life of the far west shows\r\nthat, over Wisconsin and the larger part of Michigan, the Indian\r\ntrade was still carried on by methods introduced by the French.\r\n[Footnote: Masson, Le Bourgeois de Nordwest; Parkman. Old Regime.]\r\nAster's American Fur Company practically controlled the trade of\r\nWisconsin and Michigan. It shipped its guns and ammunition,\r\nblankets, gewgaws, and whiskey from Mackinac to some one of the\r\nprincipal posts, where they were placed in the light birch canoes,\r\nmanned by French boatmen, and sent throughout the forests to the\r\nminor trading-posts. Practically all of the Indian villages of the\r\ntributaries of the Great Lakes and of the upper Mississippi were\r\nregularly visited by the trader. The trading-posts became the nuclei\r\nof later settlements; the traders' trails grew into the early roads,\r\nand their portages marked out the location for canals. Little by\r\nlittle the fur-trade was undermining the Indian society and paving\r\nthe way for the entrance of civilization. [Footnote: Turner,\r\nCharacter and Influence of the Fur Trade in Wis., in Wis. Hist.\r\nSoc., Transactions, 1889.]\r\n\r\nIn the War of 1812, all along the frontier of Indiana, Illinois, and\r\nMissouri, as well as in the southwest, the settlers had drawn back\r\ninto forts, much as in the early days of the occupation of Kentucky\r\nand Tennessee, and the traders and the Indians had been entirely\r\nunder the influence of Great Britain. In the negotiations at Ghent,\r\nthat power, having captured the American forts at Mackinac, Prairie\r\ndu Chien, and Chicago, tried to incorporate in the treaty a\r\nprovision for a neutral belt, or buffer state, of Indian territory\r\nin the northwest, to separate Canada from the United States.\r\n[Footnote: Cf. Babcock, Am. Nationality (Am. Nation, XIII.), chap.\r\nx.] Taught by this experience, the United States, at the close of\r\nthe war, passed laws excluding aliens from conducting the Indian\r\ntrade, and erected forts at Green Bay, Prairie du Chien, Chicago,\r\nand Fort Snelling. By order of Secretary of War Calhoun, Governor\r\nCass, of Michigan, made an expedition in 1820 along the south shore\r\nof Lake Superior into Minnesota, to compel the removal of English\r\nflags and to replace British by American influence. [Footnote:\r\nSchoolcraft, Hist, of Indian Tribes, VI., 422; ibid., Narrative\r\nJournal; \"Doty's Journal,\" in Wis. Hist. Soc., Collections, XIII.,\r\n163.] At the same time, an expedition under Major Long visited the\r\nupper waters of the Minnesota River on a similar errand. [Footnote:\r\nKeating, Long's Expedition.] An agent who was sent by the government\r\nto investigate the Indian conditions of this region in 1820,\r\nrecommended that the country now included in Wisconsin, northern\r\nMichigan, and part of Minnesota should be an Indian reservation,\r\nfrom which white settlements should be excluded, with the idea that\r\nultimately the Indian population should be organized as a state of\r\nthe Union. [Footnote: Morse, Report on Indian Affairs in 1820.]\r\n\r\nThe Creeks and Cherokees, Choctaws, and Chickasaws of the Gulf\r\nregion were more advanced towards civilization than the Indians of\r\nthe northwest. While the latter lived chiefly by hunting and\r\ntrapping, the southwestern Indians had developed a considerable\r\nagriculture and a sedentary life. For that very reason, however,\r\nthey were the more obnoxious to the pioneers who pressed upon their\r\nterritory from all sides; and, as we shall see, strenuous efforts\r\nwere made to remove them beyond the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThroughout the decade the problem of the future of the Indians east\r\nof this river was a pressing one, and the secretaries of war, to\r\nwhose department the management of the tribes belonged, made many\r\nplans and recommendations for their civilization, improvement, and\r\nassimilation. But the advance of the frontier broke down the efforts\r\nto preserve and incorporate these primitive people in the dominant\r\nAmerican society. [Footnote: Am. State Paps., Indian, II., 275, 542,\r\net passim; J. Q. Adams, Memoirs, VII., 89, 90, 92; Richardson,\r\nMessages and Papers, II., 234, et seq.]\r\n\r\nAcross the Mississippi, settlement of the whites had, in the course\r\nof this decade, pushed up the Missouri well towards the western\r\nboundary of the state, and, as the map of the settlement shows, had\r\nmade advances towards the interior in parts of Arkansas as well. But\r\nthese were only narrow wedges of civilization thrust into the Indian\r\ncountry, the field of operations of the fur-traders. Successors to\r\nthe French traders who had followed the rivers and lakes of Canada\r\nfar towards the interior, the Hudson's Bay Company, and the\r\nNorthwest Company under British charters had carried their\r\noperations from the Great Lakes to the Pacific long before Americans\r\nentered the west. As early as 1793, Alexander Mackenzie reached the\r\nPacific from the Great Lakes by way of Canada. [Footnote: Mackenzie,\r\nTravels.] The year before, an English ship under Vancouver explored\r\nthe northwestern coast in the hope of finding a passage by sea to\r\nthe north and east. He missed the mouth of the Columbia, which in\r\nthe following month was entered by an American, Captain Gray, who\r\nascended the river twenty miles. The expedition of Lewis and Clark,\r\n1804-1806, made the first crossing of the continent from territory\r\nof the United States, and strengthened the claims of that country to\r\nthe region of the Columbia. [Footnote: Cf. Charming, Jeffersonian\r\nSystem (Am. Nation, XII.), chap vii.]\r\n\r\nJohn Jacob Astor's attempt to plant a trading-post at Astoria\r\n[Footnote: Irving, Astoria.] had been defeated by the treachery of\r\nhis men, who, at the opening of the War of 1812, turned the post\r\nover to the British Northwest fur-traders. The two great branches of\r\nthe Columbia, the one reaching up into Canada, and the other pushing\r\nfar into the Rocky Mountains, on the American side, constituted\r\nlines of advance for the rival forces of England and the United\r\nStates in the struggle for the Oregon country. The British traders\r\nrapidly made themselves masters of the region. [Footnote: Coues\r\n(editor), Greater Northwest.] By 1825 the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nmonopolized the English fur-trade and was established at Fort George\r\n(as Astoria was rechristened), Fort Walla-Walla, and Fort Vancouver,\r\nnear the mouth of the Willamette. Here, for twenty-two years, its\r\nagent, Dr. John McLoughlin, one of the many Scotchmen who have built\r\nup England's dominion in the new countries of the globe, ruled like\r\na benevolent monarch over the realms of the British traders.\r\n[Footnote: Schafer, Pacific Northwest, chap. viii.] From these\r\nOregon posts as centers they passed as far south as the region of\r\nGreat Salt Lake, in what was then Mexican territory.\r\n\r\nWhile the British traders occupied the northwest coast the Spaniards\r\nheld California. Although they established the settlement of San\r\nFrancisco in the year of the declaration of American independence,\r\nsettlement grew but slowly. The presidios, the missions, with their\r\nIndian neophytes, and the cattle ranches feebly occupied this\r\nimperial domain. Yankee trading-ships gathered hides and tallow at\r\nSan Diego, Monterey, and San Francisco; Yankee whalers, seal-\r\nhunters, and fur-traders sought the northwest coast and passed on to\r\nChina to bring back to Boston and Salem the products of the far\r\neast. [Footnote: R. H. Dana, Two Years before the Mast.] But Spain's\r\npossession was not secure. The genius for expansion which had\r\nalready brought the Russians to Alaska drew them down the coast even\r\nto California, and in 1812 they established Fort Ross at Bodega Bay,\r\na few miles below the mouth of Russian River, north of San\r\nFrancisco. This settlement, as well as the lesser one in the\r\nFarallone Islands, endured for nearly a generation, a menace to\r\nSpain's ascendancy in California in the chaotic period when her\r\ncolonies were in revolt. [Footnote: H. H. Bancroft, Hist. of\r\nCalifornia, II., 628; Hittel, Hist. of California.]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, from St. Louis as a center, American fur-traders,\r\nthe advance-guard of settlement, were penetrating into the heart of\r\nthe vast wilderness between the Mississippi and the Pacific coast.\r\n[Footnote: Chittenden, Am. Fur Trade of the Far West] This was a\r\nmore absolute Indian domain than was the region between the\r\nAlleghenies and the Mississippi at the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury--an empire of mountains and prairies, where the men of the\r\nStone Age watched with alarm the first crawling waves of that tide\r\nof civilization that was to sweep them away. The savage population\r\nof the far west has already been described in an earlier volume of\r\nthis series.[Footnote: Farrand, Basis of Am. Hist. (Am. Nation,\r\nII.), chaps, viii., ix., xii.; see also chap. iv. On the location of\r\nthe Indians, see map, p. 309; Chittenden, Am. Fur Trade, II., pt.\r\nv., chaps, viii., ix., x.; Bureau of Ethnology, Seventh Annual\r\nReport.]\r\n\r\nWith the development of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, the most\r\nflourishing period of the St. Louis trade in the far west began. The\r\nfounder of this company was William H. Ashley, a Virginian. Between\r\nthe autumn of 1823 and the spring of the next year, one of his\r\nagents erected a post at the mouth of the Bighorn, and sent out his\r\ntrappers through the Green River valley, possibly even to Great Salt\r\nLake. A detachment of this party found the gateway of the Rocky\r\nMountains, through the famous South Pass by way of the Sweetwater\r\nbranch of the north fork of the Platte. This pass commanded the\r\nroutes to the great interior basin and to the Pacific Ocean. What\r\nCumberland Gap was in the advance of settlement across the\r\nAlleghenies, South Pass was in the movement across the Rocky\r\nMountains; through it passed the later Oregon and California trails\r\nto the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nOn the lower Missouri and at various places in the\r\ninterior,[Footnote: See map, p. 114; Chittenden, Am. Fur Trade, I.,\r\n44-51 (describes posts, etc.).] stockaded trading-posts were erected\r\nby the Rocky Mountain Fur Company and its rival, the American Fur\r\nCompany. In these posts the old fur-trade life of the past went on,\r\nwith French half-breed packmen and boatmen, commanded by the\r\nbourgeois. But in some of the best trading-grounds, the savages\r\ndeclined to permit the erection of posts, and so, under Ashley's\r\nleadership, bands of mounted American trappers, chiefly Kentuckians,\r\nTennesseeans, and Missourians, were sent out to hunt and trade in\r\nthe rich beaver valleys of the mountains. The Rocky Mountain\r\ntrappers were the successors to the Allegheny frontiersmen, carrying\r\non in this new region, where nature wrought on a vaster plan, the\r\nold trapping life which their ancestors had carried on through\r\nCumberland Gap in the \"dark and bloody ground\" of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nYearly, in June and July, a rendezvous was held in the mountains, to\r\nwhich the brigades of trappers returned with the products of their\r\nhunt, to receive the supplies for the coming year. Here, also, came\r\nIndian tribes to trade, and bands of free trappers, lone wanderers\r\nin the mountains, to sell their furs and secure supplies. [Footnote:\r\nIrving, Bonneville, chap. i.] The rendezvous was usually some\r\nverdure-clad valley or park set in the midst of snow-capped\r\nmountains, a paradise of game. Such places were Jackson's Hole, at\r\nthe foot of the lofty Tetons, Pierre's Hole, not far away, and\r\nOgden's Hole, near the present site of Ogden, in Utah. Great Salt\r\nLake was probably first visited by Bridger in 1824, and the next\r\nyear a party of Hudson Bay trappers were expelled by Americans who\r\ntook possession of their furs. In 1826, Ashley carried a six-pounder\r\ncannon on wheels to Utah Lake for the defense of his post.\r\n\r\nA new advance of the American fur-trader was made when Jedediah\r\nSmith succeeded Ashley as the leader in Rocky Mountain trade and\r\nexploration. In 1826 he left the Salt Lake rendezvous with a party\r\nof trappers to learn the secrets of the lands between the Rocky\r\nMountains and the Pacific Ocean. Proceeding to the southwest along\r\nthe Virgin River, Smith descended it to the Colorado, and crossed\r\nthe desert to San Diego, California. Here, by the intercession of a\r\nYankee captain then in that port, he obtained supplies from the\r\nSpaniards, and turned to the northwest, traveling parallel to the\r\ncoast for some three hundred miles to wintering grounds on the\r\nheadwaters of the San Joaquin and the Merced. Leaving most of his\r\nparty behind, he crossed the mountains, by a route south of the\r\nHumboldt, and returned to Great Salt Lake.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately he set out again for California by the previous\r\nroute, and in 1827 reached the San Jose mission. Here he was\r\narrested by the Spanish authorities and sent under guard to\r\nMonterey, where another Yankee skipper secured his release.\r\nWintering once more in California, this time on the American Fork,\r\nhe reached the coast in the spring of 1828, and followed the Umpquah\r\nRiver towards the Oregon country. While he was absent, his camp was\r\nattacked by the Indians and fifteen of his men killed. Absolutely\r\nalone, Smith worked his way through the forest to Fort Vancouver,\r\nwhere he enjoyed the hospitality of Dr. McLoughlin through the\r\nwinter. In the following spring he ascended the Columbia to the\r\nHudson Bay posts among the Flatheads, and made his way in the summer\r\nof 1829 to the rendezvous of his company at the Tetons. In three\r\nyears this daring trader, braving the horrors of the desert and\r\npassing unscathed from Indian attacks which carried off most of his\r\ncompanions, opened to knowledge much of the vast country between\r\nGreat Salt Lake and the Pacific. [Footnote: H. H. Bancroft,\r\nCalifornia, III., 152-160, citing the sources.] In 1831, while on\r\nthe Santa Fe trail, Smith and his companions lost their way.\r\nPerishing with thirst, he finally reached the Cimaron, where, as he\r\nwas digging for water in its sandy bed, he was shot by an Indian.\r\n\r\nThus the active men of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, in the decade\r\nbetween 1820 and 1830, revealed the sources of the Platte, the\r\nGreen, the Yellowstone, and the Snake rivers, and the\r\ncharacteristics of the Great Salt Lake region; they pioneered the\r\nway to South Pass, descended Green River by boat, carried cannon\r\ninto the interior basin; showed the practicability of a wagon route\r\nthrough the Rockies, reached California from Salt Lake, crossed the\r\nSierras and the deserts of Utah and Nevada, and became intimately\r\nacquainted with the activity of the British traders of the northwest\r\ncoast. [Footnote: Chittenden, Am. Fur Trade, I., 306.]\r\n\r\nAlready an interest in Oregon and the Rocky Mountain region was\r\narising on the eastern seaboard. In 1832, Captain Bonneville, an\r\nofficer in the United States army, on leave of absence, passed with\r\na wagon-train into the Rocky Mountains, where for nearly three years\r\nhe trapped and traded and explored. [Footnote: Irving, Bonneville.]\r\nWalker, one of his men, in 1833, reached California by the Humboldt\r\nRiver (a route afterwards followed by the emigrants to California),\r\nand made known much new country. A New England enthusiast, Hall\r\nKelley, had for some years been lecturing on the riches of the\r\nOregon country and the need of planting an agricultural colony\r\nthere. It was natural that Boston should be interested in the Oregon\r\ncountry, which was visited by so many vessels from that port. In\r\n1820, New England missionaries settled in the Hawaiian Islands,\r\nclosely connected by trade with the coast. In 1832, Nathaniel Wyeth,\r\nof Cambridge, Massachusetts, led a party of New-Englanders west,\r\nwith the plan of establishing a trading and fishing post on the\r\nwaters of the Columbia. [Footnote: Chittenden, Am. Fur Trade, I.,\r\n435; Wyeth's \"Journals\" are published by the Oregon Hist. Soc.; cf.\r\nIrving, Bonneville, chap. vi.]\r\n\r\nWith Wyeth, on a second expedition in 1834, went the Reverend Jason\r\nLee and four Methodist missionaries. Two years later came Dr. Marcus\r\nWhitman and another company of missionaries with their wives; they\r\nbrought a wagon through South Pass and over the mountains to the\r\nSnake River, and began an agricultural colony. Thus the old story of\r\nthe sequence of fur-trader, missionary, and settler was repeated.\r\nThe possession of Oregon by the British fur-trader was challenged by\r\nthe American farmer.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with the development of the fur-trade in the Rocky\r\nMountains, a trade was opened between St. Louis and the old Spanish\r\nsettlements at Santa Fe. Although even in the days of Washington\r\nadventurous frontiersmen like George Rogers Clark had set their eyes\r\non Santa Fe and the silver-mines of the southwest, it was not until\r\nthe Mexican revolution (1821), when Spain's control was weakened\r\nthroughout her whole domain, that systematic trade was possible. In\r\n1822, Becknell, of Missouri, took a wagon-train to Santa Fe, to\r\ntrade for horses and mules and to trap en route. Year after year\r\nthereafter, caravans of Missouri traders found their way across the\r\ndesert, by the Santa Fe trail, with cottons and other dry-goods\r\nfurnished from St. Louis, and brought back horses, mules, furs, and\r\nsilver. The trade averaged about one hundred and thirty thousand\r\ndollars a year, and was an important source of supply of specie for\r\nthe west; and it stimulated the interest of St. Louis in the Mexican\r\nprovinces. The mode of handling the wagon--trains that passed\r\nbetween Missouri and Santa Fe furnished the model for the caravans\r\nthat later were to cross the plains in the rush to the gold-fields\r\nof California.[Footnote: Gregg, Commerce of the Prairies;\r\nChittenden, Am. Fur Trade, II., chap. xxix.] By 1833 the important\r\nwestern routes were clearly made known.[Footnote: Semple, Am. Hist.\r\nand its Geographic Conditions, chap, x.] The Oregon trail, the Santa\r\nFe trail, the Spanish trail, and the Gila route [Footnote: Personal\r\nNarrative of James O. Pattie; H. H. Bancroft, Hist. of California,\r\nIII., 162.] had been followed by frontiersmen into the promised land\r\nof the Pacific coast and the southwest. In the course of ten years,\r\nnot only had the principal secrets of the topography of the Rocky\r\nMountains, the Great Basin, the passes across the Sierra Nevadas\r\nbeen revealed, but also the characteristics of the Spanish-American\r\nsettlements of California and the Rio Grande region. Already\r\npioneers sought Texas, and American colonization was preparing for\r\nanother and greater conquest of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the United States government in the far west in this\r\nperiod was shown in exploration and diplomacy. Calhoun projected an\r\nextension of the forts of the United States well up the Missouri\r\ninto the Indian country, partly as protection to the traders and\r\npartly as a defense against English aggressions. Two Yellowstone\r\nexpeditions [Footnote: Chittenden, Am. Fur Trade, II., 562; Long's\r\nExpedition (Early Western Travels, XIV.-XVII.).] were designed to\r\npromote these ends. The first of these, 1819-1820, was a joint\r\nmilitary and scientific undertaking; but the military expedition,\r\nattempting to ascend the Missouri in steamboats, got no farther than\r\nCouncil Bluffs. Mismanagement, extravagance, and scandal attended\r\nthe undertaking, and the enterprise was made an occasion for a\r\npolitical onslaught on Calhoun's management of the war department.\r\n\r\nThe scientific expedition, under Major Long, of the United States\r\nEngineering Corps, ascended the Missouri in the Western Engineer,\r\nthe first steamboat which navigated those waters above St. Louis--a\r\nstern-wheeler, with serpent-mouthed figure-head, through which the\r\nsteam escaped, bringing terror to the savages along the banks. The\r\nexpedition advanced far up the South Platte, discovered Long's Peak,\r\nand camped near the site of Denver. Thence the party passed to La\r\nJunta, Colorado, whence it broke into two divisions, one of which\r\ndescended the Arkansas; the other reached the Canadian River (which\r\nit mistook for the Red) and descended to its junction with the\r\nArkansas. The effort to push the military power of the government to\r\nthe mouth of the Yellowstone failed, and the net result, on the\r\nmilitary side, was a temporary post near the present site of Omaha.\r\n\r\nThe most important effect of the expedition was to give currency to\r\nLong's description of the country through which he passed as the\r\n\"Great American Desert,\" unfit for cultivation and uninhabitable by\r\nagricultural settlers. The whole of the region between the Missouri\r\nRiver and the Rocky Mountains seemed to him adapted as a range for\r\nbuffalo, \"calculated to serve as a barrier to prevent too great an\r\nextension of our population westward,\" and to secure us against the\r\nincursions of enemies in that quarter. [Footnote: Long's Expedition\r\n(Early Western Travels, XVII.), 147, 148.] A second expedition, in\r\n1825, under General Atkinson and Major O'Fallon, reached the mouth\r\nof the Yellowstone, having made treaties with various Indian tribes\r\non the way.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Congress and the president were busy with the\r\nquestion of Oregon. By the convention of 1818, with Great Britain,\r\nthe northern boundary of the United States was carried from the Lake\r\nof the Woods to the Rocky Mountains, along the forty-ninth parallel.\r\nBeyond the mountains, the Oregon country was left open, for a period\r\nof ten years, to joint occupation of both powers, without prejudice\r\nto the claims of either. Having thus postponed the Oregon question,\r\nthe secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, turned to his Spanish\r\nrelations. Obliged by Monroe to relinquish our claim to Texas in the\r\ntreaty of 1819, by which we obtained Florida, he insisted on so\r\ndrawing our boundary-line in the southwest as to acquire Spain's\r\ntitle to the Pacific north of the forty-second parallel, and to the\r\nlands that lay north and east of the irregular line from the\r\nintersection of this parallel with the Rocky Mountains to the\r\nSabine. Adams was proud of securing this line to the Pacific Ocean,\r\nfor it was the first recognition by an outside power of our rights\r\nin the Oregon country.[Footnote: Treaties and Conventions (ed. of\r\n1889), 416, 1017; Babcock, Am. Nationality (Am. Nation, XIII.),\r\nchap, xvi.; J. Q. Adams, Memoirs, IV., 275.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Russia put forward large and exclusive claims north of the\r\nfifty-first parallel, which we challenged, the contest for Oregon\r\nlay between England and the United States. At the close of 1820,\r\nFloyd, of Virginia, moved in the House of Representatives to inquire\r\ninto the feasibility of the occupation of the Columbia River; and\r\nearly the next year [Footnote: Annals of Cong., 16 Cong., 2 Sess.,\r\n945; J. Q. Adams, Memoirs, V., 238, 243-260.] a committee report was\r\nbrought in, discussing the American rights. Floyd's bill provided\r\nfor the military occupation of the Columbia River, donation of lands\r\nto actual settlers, and control of the Indians. No vote was reached,\r\nhowever, and it was not until the close of 1822 that the matter\r\nsecured the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been his motives, Floyd stated with vividness the\r\nsignificance of western advance in relation to the Pacific coast. He\r\nshowed that, while in 1755, nearly a hundred and fifty years after\r\nthe foundation of Jamestown, the population of Virginia had spread\r\nbut three hundred miles into the interior of the country, during the\r\nlast forty-three years population had spread westward more than a\r\nthousand miles. He recalled the days when more than a month was\r\nrequired to furnish Kentucky with eastern goods, by way of\r\nPittsburgh, and when it required a voyage of over a month to pass\r\nfrom Louisville to New Orleans and nearly three months for the\r\nupward voyage. This had now been shortened by steamboat to seven\r\ndays down and sixteen days up. From these considerations and the\r\ntime from St. Louis to the mouth of the Columbia by steamboat and\r\nwagon, he argued that Oregon was no more distant from St. Louis in\r\n1822 than St. Louis was twenty years before from Philadelphia. The\r\nfur-trade, the whale and seal fisheries, the trade with China, and\r\nthe opportunity for agricultural occupation afforded by Oregon were\r\nall set forth.[Footnote: Annals of Cong., 17 Cong., 2 Sess., 397.]\r\n\r\nAgainst the proposal, his opponents argued inexpediency rather than\r\nour treaties with Great Britain. Tracy, of New York, doubted the\r\nvalue of the Oregon country, and, influenced perhaps by Long's\r\nreport, declared that \"nature has fixed limits for our nation; she\r\nhas kindly introduced as our Western barrier, mountains almost\r\ninaccessible, whose base she has skirted with irreclaimable deserts\r\nof sand.\"[Footnote: Ibid., 590.] In a later debate, Smyth, of\r\nVirginia, amplified this idea by a proposal to limit the boundaries\r\nof the United States, so that it should include but one or two tiers\r\nof states beyond the Mississippi. He would remove the Indians beyond\r\nthis limit, and, if American settlements should cross it, they might\r\nbe in alliance with, or under the protection of, the United States,\r\nbut outside of its bounds. [Footnote: Register of Debates, 18 Cong.,\r\n2 Sess., I., 37.]\r\n\r\nBaylies, of Massachusetts, declared that there were living witnesses\r\n\"who have seen a population of scarcely six hundred thousand swelled\r\ninto ten millions; a population which, in their youth, extended\r\nscarcely an hundred miles from the ocean, spreading beyond the\r\nmountains of the West, and sweeping down those mighty waters which\r\nopen into regions of such matchless fertility and beauty.\" \"Some now\r\nwithin these walls may, before they die, witness scenes more\r\nwonderful than these; and in aftertimes may cherish delightful\r\nrecollections of this day, when America, almost shrinking from the\r\n'shadows of coming events,' first placed her feet upon untrodden\r\nground, scarcely daring to anticipate the grandeur which awaited\r\nher.\" Tucker, of Virginia, agreed that settlement \"marches on, with\r\nthe increasing rapidity of a fire, and nothing will stop it until it\r\nreaches the shores of the Pacific,\" which he estimated would be by\r\n1872. But he was loath to see it accelerated, believing that the\r\npeople on the east and the west side of the Rocky Mountains would\r\nhave a permanent separation of interests. [Footnote: Annals of\r\nCong., 17 Cong., 2 Sess., 422.] Nor were even western men sanguine\r\nthat the nation could retain the Pacific coast as an integral part\r\nof its vast empire. Senator Benton, of Missouri, was the\r\ncongressional champion of the far west. Born in interior North\r\nCarolina, he had followed the frontier to Tennessee, and then, after\r\nkilling his man in a duel and exchanging pistol-shots in a free\r\nfight with Jackson, he removed to the new frontier at St. Louis.\r\nPedantic and ponderous, deeply read in curious historical lore, in\r\nmany ways he was not characteristic of the far west, but in the\r\ncoarse vigor with which he bore down opposition by abuse, and in the\r\nfar horizon line of the policies he advocated, he thoroughly\r\nrepresented its traits.\r\n\r\nFamiliar as he was with frontier needs and aspirations, he urged the\r\nUnited States to block England's control of the northwest, and to\r\nassert title to the Oregon territory, with the idea of ultimately\r\nfounding a new and independent American nation there. It is true\r\nthat he admitted that along the ridge of the Rocky Mountains \"the\r\nwestern limit of this republic should be drawn, and the statue of\r\nthe fabled god Terminus should be raised upon its highest peak,\r\nnever to be thrown down.\" [Footnote: Register of Debates, I., 712.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in his utterances the ideal of expansion was not to be\r\nmistaken. He spoke bravely in favor of the protection and extension\r\nof the fur-trade, [Footnote: Annals of Cong., 17 Cong., 1 Sess., I.,\r\n416; cf. ibid., 18 Cong., I Sess., I., 456.] pointing out that\r\ninasmuch as England occupied Oregon, she would, under the law of\r\nnations, have the right of possession until the question of\r\nsovereignty were decided. He warned his countrymen, in 1823, that\r\nGreat Britain would monopolize the Pacific Ocean, and by obtaining\r\ncontrol of the Rocky Mountain fur-trade would be able to launch the\r\nIndians of the north and west against the frontiers of Missouri and\r\nArkansas, Illinois and Michigan, upon the first renewal of\r\nhostilities between the United States of America and the king of\r\nGreat Britain. [Footnote: Ibid., 17 Cong., 2 Sess., 246-251.]\r\n\r\nBenton believed that, within a century, a population greater than\r\nthat of the United States of 1820 would exist on the west side of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains; and he saw in the occupation of the northwest\r\ncoast the means of promoting a trade between the valley of the\r\nMississippi, the Pacific Ocean, and Asia. Upon the people of eastern\r\nAsia, he thought, the establishment of a civilized power on the\r\nopposite coast of America would produce great benefits. \"Science,\r\nliberal principles in government, and the true religion, might cast\r\ntheir lights across the intervening sea. The valley of the Columbia\r\nmight become the granary of China and Japan, and an outlet to their\r\nimprisoned and exuberant population.... Russia and the legitimates\r\nmenace Turkey, Persia, China, and Japan; they menace them for their\r\nriches and dominions; the same Powers menace the two Americas for\r\nthe popular forms of their Governments. To my mind the proposition\r\nis clear, that Eastern Asia and the two Americas, as they have\r\nbecome neighbors, should become friends.\" [Footnote: Register of\r\nDebates, I., 712.]\r\n\r\nWith true western passion he denounced the relinquishment of Texas\r\nby the treaty of 1819. \"The magnificent valley of the Mississippi is\r\nours,\" he proclaimed, \"with all its fountains, springs, and floods\r\nand woe to the statesman who shall undertake to surrender one drop\r\nof its water, one inch of its soil, to any foreign power.\" He was\r\nready for a war with Spain, believing that it would give the United\r\nStates the Floridas and Cuba, \"the geographical appurtenance of the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi\"; that it would free the New from the Old\r\nWorld; and that it would create a cordon of republics across the two\r\ncontinents of North and South America. He pointed to the west as the\r\nroute to the east--the long-sought way to India; and, in\r\nimagination, he outlined the states to be laid off \"from the center\r\nof the valley of the Mississippi to the foot of the shining\r\nmountains.\" \"It is time,\" he wrote, \"that Western men had some share\r\nin the destinies of this republic.\" [Footnote: Meigs, Benton, 98,\r\n99, cf. 91.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS OF 1819 AND ITS RESULTS (1819-1820)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1820 the United States had a population of about nine and one-\r\nhalf millions; in 1830, nearly thirteen millions. It was spread out\r\nfrom east to west like a page in the history of society. On the\r\nAtlantic seaboard were the centers of American civilization that had\r\ngrown up in colonial days in close touch with Europe. From this\r\nregion of commerce and manufacture, the nation, on its march towards\r\nthe west, changed through successive types of industrial life until\r\nin the Rocky Mountains the frontier fur-trader mingled with the\r\nIndians. The successive stages of social evolution which at first\r\nwere exhibited in narrow belts on the Atlantic coast had now spread\r\nnearly across the continent. [Footnote: Turner, \"Significance of the\r\nFrontier,\" in Am. Hist. Assoc., Report 1893, pp. 200, 206, 208.]\r\n\r\nNot only was the country vast in extent, it was rapidly growing. In\r\nthe decade the nation increased its population by over three million\r\nand a quarter inhabitants, an addition which nearly equaled the\r\nwhole population of any one of the three great sections, the middle\r\nstates, the south, and the west. As traveler after traveler passed\r\nover the routes of his predecessor in this period, reporting the\r\nlife by the wayside and in the towns, we can almost see American\r\nsociety unfolding with startling rapidity under our gaze; farms\r\nbecome hamlets, hamlets grow into prosperous cities; the Indian and\r\nthe forests recede; new stretches of wilderness come into view in\r\nthe farther west, and we see the irresistible tide of settlement\r\nflowing towards the solitudes.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, at the opening of our survey the nation was in the\r\ngloom of the panic of 1819. This was brought on by the speculative\r\nreaction that immediately followed the war, when the long-pent-up\r\ncrops of cotton found a market at the extraordinary price of nearly\r\nthirty cents a pound, and as high as seventy-eight dollars per acre\r\nwas bid for government land in the offices of the southwest.\r\n[Footnote: Annals of Cong., 16 Cong., I Sess., 446.] The policy of\r\nthe government fostered reckless purchases of public land. In the\r\ncritical times of the closing years of the war, the treasury agreed\r\nto accept the notes of state banks in payment for lands, on\r\ncondition that these banks should resume specie payment; and then\r\nthe banks, while taking only nominal steps towards resumption,\r\nloaned their paper freely to the settlers and speculators who wished\r\nto invest in the public domain.\r\n\r\nUnder the credit system already mentioned, the pioneer was tempted\r\nto exhaust his funds in making his first partial payment, and to\r\nrely upon loans from some \"wild cat\" bank wherewith to complete the\r\npurchase of the hundred and sixty acres, the smallest tract offered\r\nunder the terms of the law; planters, relying equally on the state\r\nbanks, bought great tracts of land at absurd prices; speculators,\r\ntempted by the rapid rise in land values and by the ease of securing\r\nloans, purchased large quantities in the hope of selling before it\r\nbecame necessary to complete their payment. On the seaboard,\r\nextravagance abounded as a reaction from the economies of war times,\r\nimported manufactures found a ready market, and the domestic\r\nfactories were in distress.\r\n\r\nWhile state banks greatly multiplied and expanded their circulation\r\nfreely to meet the demands of borrowers, [Footnote: Stunner, Hist,\r\nof Banking, I., chaps, iv.-vi.] the United States Bank not only\r\nfailed to check the movement, but even contributed to it. After a\r\ndance of speculation, the bank, in the summer of 1818, was facing\r\nruin, and it took drastic means to save itself. Its measures\r\ncompelled the state banks to redeem their notes in specie or close\r\ntheir doors. [Footnote: Catterall, Second Bank, chap. iii.; Dewey,\r\nFinancial Hist, of the U. S., chap, vii.; Babcock, Am. Nationality\r\n(Am. Nation. XIII.), chap. xiii.]\r\n\r\nBy the spring of 1819 the country was in the throes of a panic.\r\nState-bank issues were reduced from one hundred million dollars in\r\n1817 to forty-five millions in 1819. Few banks in the south and west\r\nwere able to redeem their notes in specie before 1822; but they\r\npressed their debtors harshly. Staple productions fell to less than\r\nhalf of their former price; land values declined fifty to seventy\r\nper cent.; manufacturers were in distress; laborers were out of\r\nwork; merchants were ruined. [Footnote: J. Q. Adams, Memoirs, IV.,\r\n375; Jefferson, Writings, X., 257; Benton, View, I., 5; Niles'\r\nRegister, XVI., 114; Hodgson, Travels, II., 128; Sumner, Hist, of\r\nBanking, I., chaps, vii., viii.] The conditions are illustrated in\r\nthe case of Cincinnati. By the foreclosure of mortgages, the\r\nnational bank came to own a large part of the city-hotels, coffee-\r\nhouses, warehouses, stables, iron foundries, residences, and vacant\r\nlots. \"All the flourishing cities of the West,\" cried Benton, \"are\r\nmortgaged to this money power. They may be devoured by it at any\r\nmoment. They are in the jaws of the monster!\" Throughout the south\r\nand west the bank became familiarly known as The Monster. [Footnote:\r\nCatterall, Second Bank, 67.]\r\n\r\nEven in the days of its laxity the national bank was obnoxious in\r\nmany quarters of the country. By the state constitution of 1816\r\nIndiana attempted to prevent the establishment within its limits of\r\nany bank not chartered by the state; and Illinois incorporated a\r\nsimilar provision in her constitution of 1818. Between 1817 and 1819\r\nMaryland, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Ohio all\r\npassed acts taxing the United States Bank. [Footnote: Ibid., 64,\r\n65.] Ohio, defying the decision of the supreme court in The case of\r\nMcCulloch vs. Maryland, which asserted the constitutionality of the\r\nbank and denied to the states the right to tax it, forcibly\r\ncollected the tax and practically outlawed the bank. [Footnote: See\r\nchap. xv., below.]\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of our history the frontier had been a debtor\r\nregion, always favorable to an expansion of the currency and to laws\r\nto relieve the debtor class. It was but the continuation of an old\r\npractice when the western legislature in this time of stringency\r\nattempted measures of relief for their citizens. Kentucky's \"litter\"\r\nof forty banks chartered in the session of 1818-1819 had been forced\r\nto the wall by the measures of the national bank. After the panic,\r\nKentucky repealed the charters of these banks and incorporated the\r\nBank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, an institution without\r\nstockholders and under officers elected by the legislature and paid\r\nby the state. Its notes were assigned to the counties in proportion\r\nto the taxable property, to be loaned on mortgage securities to\r\nthose who needed them \"for the purpose of paying his, her, or their\r\njust debts,\" or to purchase products for exportation. The only real\r\ncapital of the bank was a legislative appropriation of seven\r\nthousand dollars to buy the material and plates for printing notes.\r\nIn short, the treasury of the state was used as a kind of land bank\r\nof the sort favored in the colonial days for the relief of the\r\ndebtors.[Footnote: Cf. Greene, Provincial America Am. Nation, VI.,\r\nchap. xvii.] The legislature then passed a replevin law giving the\r\ndebtor a delay of two years to satisfy an execution, in case the\r\ncreditor refused to accept notes of the Bank of the Commonwealth of\r\nKentucky as payment; otherwise the debtor received an extension of\r\nbut one year. By another law, land could not be sold under execution\r\nto pay a debt unless it brought three-fourths of its value as\r\nappraised by a board of neighbors, usually themselves debtors and\r\ninterested in supporting values.\r\n\r\nIn 1823 the court of appeals of Kentucky declared the replevin and\r\nstay laws unconstitutional. In retaliation the legislature, in\r\nDecember, 1824, repealed the law establishing the court of appeals,\r\nand a new court was created favorable to the \"relief system.\" This\r\nact the old court also declared unconstitutional, and a contest\r\nfollowed between the \"old court\" and the \"new court\" parties, which\r\nlasted until 1826, when the \"old court,\" \"anti-relief\" party was\r\nvictorious. In the mean time, similar relief measures had been\r\npassed in Tennessee, Illinois, Missouri, and other western\r\nstates.[Footnote: Summer, Hist. of Banking, I., chap. x.; ibid.,\r\n122, 146, 157, 161; Durrett, Centenary of Louisville; McMaster,\r\nUnited states, V., 160.]\r\n\r\nThe distress brought about by the panic of 1819, the popular\r\nantagonism to the banks in general, and especially to the Bank of\r\nthe United States, as \"engines of aristocracy,\" oppressive to the\r\ncommon people, and the general discontent with the established\r\norder, had, as we have seen, produced a movement comparable to the\r\npopulist agitation of our own time.\r\n\r\nUpon the general government the first effect of this period of\r\ndistress was a general reduction of the revenue. Imports fell from\r\nabout $121,000,000 in 1818 to $87,000,000 in 1819. Customs receipts,\r\nWhich in 1816 were over $36,000,000, were but $13,000,000 in 1821.\r\nReceipts for public lands, which amounted to $3,274,000 in 1819,\r\nwere but $1,635,000 in 1820. In December, 1819, Crawford, the\r\nsecretary of the treasury, was obliged to announce a deficit which\r\nrequired either a reduction in expenditures or an increase in\r\nrevenue. Congress provided for two loans, one of $3,000,000 in 1820,\r\nand another of $5,000,000 in 1821. A policy of retrenchment was\r\nvigorously instituted, leveled chiefly at the department of war.\r\nInternal improvement schemes which had been urged in Congress in\r\n1818 were now temporarily put to rest. With the year 1822, however,\r\nconditions brightened, and the treasury began a long term of\r\nprosperity. [Footnote: Dewey, Financial Hist. of the U. S., 168.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important results of the crisis was the complete\r\nreorganization of the system of disposal of the public lands. The\r\npublic domain was more than a source of revenue to the general\r\ngovernment; it was one of the most profoundly influential factors in\r\nshaping American social conditions. The settler who entered the\r\nwilderness with but a small capital, or who became a squatter on the\r\npublic lands without legal title, was impatient with the policy\r\nwhich made revenue the primary consideration of the government.\r\nBenton expressed this view in 1826, [Footnote: Register of Debates,\r\n19 Cong., I Sess., I., 727.] when he said: \"I speak to statesmen,\r\nand not to compting clerks; to Senators, and not to Quaestors of\r\nprovinces; to an assembly of legislators, and not to a keeper of the\r\nKing's forests. I speak to Senators who know this to be a Republic,\r\nnot a Monarchy; who know that the public lands belong to the People\r\nand not to the Federal Government.\" The effect of the credit system\r\nhad been, as we have seen, to stimulate speculation and to plunge\r\nthe settlers deeply in debt to the general government.\r\n\r\nBy 1820 these payments for the public lands were over twenty-two\r\nmillion dollars in arrears. Relief measures passed by Congress from\r\ntime to time had extended the period of payment and made other\r\nconcessions. Now the government had to face the problem of\r\nreconstructing its land laws or of continuing the old credit system\r\nand relentlessly expelling the delinquent purchasers from their\r\nhard-won homes on the public domain. Although the legal title\r\nremained in the government, the latter alternative was so obviously\r\ndangerous and inexpedient that Congress passed two new acts. The\r\nfirst [Footnote: U. S. Statutes at Large, III., 566.] (April 24,\r\n1820) reduced the price of land from two dollars to one dollar and\r\ntwenty-five cents per acre, abolished the system of credit, and\r\nprovided that lands might be purchased in multiples of eighty acres.\r\nThus the settler with one hundred dollars could secure full title to\r\na farm. This was followed by a relief act (March 2, 1821),\r\nrecommended by Secretary Crawford, [Footnote: Am. State Papers.,\r\nFinance, III., 551, 718; U. S. Statutes at Large, III., 566.]\r\nallowing previous purchasers to relinquish their claims to land for\r\nwhich they had not paid, and apply payments already made to full\r\npurchase of a portion of the land to be retained by the buyer, all\r\noverdue interest to be remitted. [Footnote: Ibid., III., 612.] It is\r\nsignificant that this system was not unlike the relief system which\r\nhad been so popular in the west.\r\n\r\nThis adjustment of the land question by no means closed the\r\nagitation. A few years later Benton repeatedly urged Congress to\r\ngraduate the price of public lands according to their real value,\r\nand to donate to actual settlers lands which remained unsold after\r\nthey had been offered at fifty cents an acre. [Footnote: Speech in\r\nthe Senate, May 16, 1826, Meigs, Benton, 163-170.] The argument\r\nrested chiefly on the large number of men unable to secure a farm\r\neven under the cheaper price of 1820; the great quantity of public\r\nland which remained unsold after it had been offered; the advantage\r\nto the revenues from filling the vacant lands with a productive\r\npopulation; and the injustice to the western states, which found\r\nthemselves unable to obtain revenue by taxing unsold public lands\r\nand which were limited in their power of eminent domain and\r\njurisdiction as compared with the eastern states, which owned their\r\npublic lands. In this agitation lay the germs of the later homestead\r\nsystem, as well as of the propositions to relinquish the federal\r\npublic lands to the states within which they lay.\r\n\r\nWith manufacturers in distress, thousands of operatives out of\r\nemployment, and the crops of parts of the middle states and the west\r\nfalling in price to a point where it hardly paid to produce them, an\r\nappeal to Congress to raise the duties established by the tariff of\r\n1816 [Footnote: Babcock, Am. Nationality (Am. Nation, XIII.). chap.\r\nxiv.] was inevitable. Hence, in the spring of 1820 a new tariff bill\r\nwas presented by Baldwin, of Pennsylvania, the member from\r\nPittsburgh. He came from a city which felt the full effects of the\r\ndistress of the manufacturers, especially those of iron and glass,\r\nand which was one of the important centers of the great grain-\r\nraising area of the middle states and the Ohio Valley.\r\n\r\nBaldwin believed that the time had arrived when, \"all the great\r\ninterests of the country being equally prostrate, and one general\r\nscene of distress pervading all its parts,\" there should be a common\r\neffort to improve conditions by a new tariff, intended not for the\r\nsake of restoring the depleted treasury, but distinctly for\r\nprotection. Its advocates proposed to meet the failure of the system\r\nof revenue, not by encouraging importations, but by internal taxes\r\nand excises on the manufactured goods protected by the impost.\r\nAdditional revenue would be secured by higher duties on sugar,\r\nmolasses, coffee, and salt. The bill increased ad valorem duties by\r\nan amount varying from twenty-five to sixty-six per cent,\r\nadditional. For woolen and cotton manufactures the rate of\r\nadditional duty was about one-third; on hemp, an important product\r\nin Kentucky, about two-thirds. Duty on forged iron bars was\r\nincreased from seventy-five cents to one dollar and twenty-five\r\ncents per hundred-weight. On many other articles the increase of\r\nduty amounted to from twenty to one hundred per cent.\r\n\r\nNaturally the home-market argument played an important part in the\r\ndebates. It was relied upon especially by Henry Clay in his closing\r\nspeech, [Footnote: Annals of Cong., 16 Cong., I Sess., II., 3034.]\r\nin which he argued that the rapidity of growth of the United States\r\nas compared with Europe made the ratio of the increase of her\r\ncapacity of consumption to that of our capacity of production as one\r\nto four. Already he thought Europe was showing a want of capacity to\r\nconsume our surplus; in his opinion, cotton, tobacco, and bread-\r\nstuffs had already reached the maximum of foreign demand. From this\r\nhe argued that home manufactures should be encouraged to consume the\r\nsurplus, and that some portion of American industry should be\r\ndiverted from agriculture to manufacturing.\r\n\r\nIndustrial independence also required this action. England had\r\nrecently imposed new duties on wool and cotton, and her corn laws\r\ncontributed to limit her demand for our flour. \"I am, too,\" he said,\r\n\"a friend of free trade, but it must be a free trade of perfect\r\nreciprocity. If the governing considerations were cheapness; if\r\nnational independence were to weigh nothing; if honor nothing; why\r\nnot subsidize foreign powers to defend us?\" He met the argument of\r\nthe deficiency of labor and of the danger of developing overcrowded\r\nand pauperized manufacturing centers by reasoning that machinery\r\nwould enable the Americans to atone for their lack of laborers; and\r\nthat while distance and attachment to the native soil would check\r\nundue migration of laborers to the west, at the same time the danger\r\nof congestion in the east would be avoided by the attraction of the\r\ncheap western lands.\r\n\r\nLowndes, of South Carolina, who with Calhoun had been one of the\r\nprominent supporters of the tariff in 1816, now made the principal\r\nspeech in opposition: he denied the validity of the argument in\r\nfavor of a home market and contended that the supply of domestic\r\ngrain would in any case exceed the demand; and that, however small\r\nthe export, the price of the portion sent abroad would determine\r\nthat of the whole. It is important to observe that the question of\r\nconstitutionality was hardly raised. The final vote in the House\r\n(April 29, 1820) stood 91 to 78. New England gave 18 votes in favor\r\nand 17 opposed; the middle region, including Delaware, gave 56 votes\r\nfor and 1 vote against; the south, including Maryland and her sister\r\nstates on the southern seaboard, gave 5 votes in favor and 50\r\nopposed. The northwest gave its 8 votes in favor, and the southwest,\r\nincluding Kentucky, gave 4 votes in favor and 10 opposed. The vote\r\nof New England was the most divided of that of any section. From the\r\nmanufacturing states of Connecticut and Rhode Island but one member,\r\na Connecticut man, voted in opposition to the bill. The only 3\r\nnegative votes from Massachusetts proper came from the commercial\r\nregion of Boston and Salem. That portion of Massachusetts soon to\r\nbecome the state of Maine gave 4 votes in opposition and only 2 in\r\nfavor, the latter coming from the areas least interested in the\r\ncarrying-trade. New Hampshire and Vermont gave their whole vote in\r\nopposition, except for one affirmative from Vermont. Kentucky's vote\r\nwas 4 in favor to 3 opposed, Speaker Clay not voting.\r\n\r\nIn general, the distribution of the vote shows that the maritime\r\ninterests united with the slave-holding planters, engaged in\r\nproducing tobacco, cotton, and sugar, in opposition. On the other\r\nside, the manufacturing areas joined with the grain and wool raising\r\nregions of the middle and western states to support the measure.\r\nFrom the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\nOhio, Indiana, and Illinois, casting altogether 65 votes, but one\r\nman voted against the bill, and he was burned in effigy by his\r\nconstituents and resigned the same year. Of the 53 votes cast by the\r\nsouth and southwest, outside of the border states of Maryland and\r\nKentucky, there were but 5 affirmative votes. It is seen, therefore,\r\nthat in the House of Representatives, on the tariff issue, the\r\nmiddle states and the Ohio Valley were combined against the south\r\nand southwest, while New England's influence was nullified by her\r\ndivision of interests. By a single vote, on a motion to postpone,\r\nthe measure failed in the Senate; but the struggle was only\r\ndeferred.\r\n\r\nThe most important aspect of the panic of 1819 was its relation to\r\nthe forces of unrest and democratic change that were developing in\r\nthe United States. Calhoun and John Quincy Adams, conversing in the\r\nspring of 1820 upon politics, had the gloomiest apprehensions. There\r\nhad been, within two years, Calhoun said, \"an immense revolution of\r\nfortunes in every part of the Union; enormous numbers of persons\r\nutterly ruined; multitudes in deep distress; and a general mass of\r\ndisaffection to the Government not concentrated in any particular\r\ndirection, but ready to seize upon any event and looking out\r\nanywhere for a leader.\" They agreed that the Missouri question and\r\nthe debates on the tariff were merely incidental to this state of\r\nthings, and that this vague but wide-spread discontent, caused by\r\nthe disordered circumstances of individuals, had resulted in a\r\ngeneral impression that there was something radically wrong in the\r\nadministration of the government. [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, V.,\r\n128; cf. IV., 498.] Although this impression was the result of\r\ndeeper influences than those to which it was attributed by these\r\nstatesmen, yet the crisis of 1819, which bore with peculiar\r\nheaviness upon the west and south, undoubtedly aggravated all the\r\ndiscontent of those regions. To the historian the movement is\r\nprofoundly significant, for ultimately it found its leader in Andrew\r\nJackson. More immediately it led to the demand for legislation to\r\nprevent imprisonment for debt, [Footnote: See, for example, Annals\r\nof Cong., 16 Cong., 2 Sess., 1224; McMaster, United States, IV.,\r\n532-535.] to debates over a national bankruptcy law, [Footnote:\r\nAnnals of Cong., 16 Cong., 2 Sess., I., 757, 759, 792, 1203 et\r\npassim.] to the proposal of constitutional amendments leading to the\r\ndiminution of the powers of the supreme court, to a reassertion of\r\nthe sovereignty of the states, [Footnote: See chap. viii., below.]\r\nand to new legislation regarding the public lands and the tariff.\r\nThe next few years bore clear evidence of the deep influence which\r\nthis period of distress had on the politics and legislation of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE MISSOURI COMPROMISE (1819-1821)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the dark period of the commercial crisis of 1819, while Congress\r\nwas considering the admission of Missouri, the slavery issue flamed\r\nout, and revealed with startling distinctness the political\r\nsignificance of the institution, fateful and ominous for the nation,\r\ntranscending in importance the temporary financial and industrial\r\nills.\r\n\r\nThe advance of settlement in the United States made the slavery\r\ncontest a struggle for power between sections, marching in parallel\r\ncolumns into the west, each carrying its own system of labor.\r\n[Footnote: For previous questions of slavery, see Channing,\r\nJeffersonian System (Am. Nation, XII.), chap. viii.] By 1819 the\r\nvarious states of the north, under favorable conditions of climate\r\nand industrial life, had either completely extinguished slavery or\r\nwere in the process of emancipation [Footnote: See map, p. 6.] and\r\nby the Ordinance of 1787 the old Congress had excluded the\r\ninstitution in the territory north of the Ohio River. Thus Mason and\r\nDixon's line and the Ohio made a boundary between the slave-holding\r\nand the free streams of population that flowed into the Mississippi\r\nValley. Not that this line was a complete barrier: the Ordinance of\r\n1787 was not construed to free the slaves already in the old French\r\ntowns of the territory; and many southern masters brought their\r\nslaves into Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois by virtue of laws which\r\nprovided for them under the fiction of indented servants. [Footnote:\r\nHarris, Negro Servitude in Ill., 10; Durm, Indiana, chaps. ix., x.]\r\nIndeed, several efforts were made in the territory of Indiana at the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century to rescind the prohibition of\r\n1787; but to this petition Congress, under the strange leadership of\r\nJohn Randolph, gave a negative; [Footnote: Ibid., chap, xii.;\r\nHinsdale, Old Northwest, chap, xviii.] and, after a struggle between\r\nthe southern slavery and antislavery elements by which the state had\r\nbeen settled, Indiana entered the Union in 1816 as a free state,\r\nunder an agreement not to violate the Ordinance of 1787.\r\n\r\nIllinois, on her admission in 1818, also guaranteed the provisions\r\nof the Ordinance of 1787, and, not without a contest, included in\r\nher constitution an article preventing the introduction of slavery,\r\nbut so worded that the system of indenture of Negro servants was\r\ncontinued in a modified form. The issue of slavery still continued\r\nto influence Illinois elections, and, as the inhabitants saw well-\r\nto-do planters pass with their slaves across the state to recruit\r\nthe property and population of Missouri, a movement (1823-1824) in\r\nfavor of revising their constitution so as to admit slavery required\r\nthe most vigorous opposition to hold the state to freedom. The\r\nleader of the antislavery forces in Illinois was a Virginian,\r\nGovernor Coles (once private secretary to President Madison), who\r\nhad migrated to free his slaves after he became convinced that it\r\nwas hopeless to make the fight which Jefferson advised him to carry\r\non in favor of gradual emancipation in his native state. [Footnote:\r\nHarris, Negro Servitude in III., chap. iv.; Washburne, Coles, chaps,\r\niii., v.] In both Indiana and Illinois, the strength of the\r\nopposition to slavery and indented servitude came from the poorer\r\nwhites, particularly from the Quaker and Baptist elements of the\r\nsouthern stock, and from the northern settlers.\r\n\r\nIn Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, ever since the decline of\r\nthe tobacco culture, a strong opposition to slavery had existed,\r\nshown in the votes of those states on the Ordinance of 1787, and in\r\nthe fact that as late as 1827 the great majority of the abolition\r\nsocieties of the United States were to be found in this region.\r\n[Footnote: Dunn, Indiana, 190; Bassettin Johns Hopkins Univ.\r\nStudies, XVI., No. vi.; cf. Hart, Slavery and Abolition (Am. Nation,\r\nXVI.), chap. xi.] But the problem of dealing with the free Negro\r\nweighed upon the south. Even in the north these people were\r\nunwelcome. They frequently became a charge upon the community, and\r\nthey were placed under numerous disabilities. [Footnote: McMaster,\r\nUnited States, IV., 558; Gordy, Political Hist, of U. S., II., 405.]\r\n\r\nThe idea of deporting freedmen from the United States found support\r\nboth among the humanitarians, who saw in it a step towards general\r\nemancipation, and among the slave-holders who viewed the increase of\r\nthe free Negroes with apprehension. To promote this solution of the\r\nproblem, the Colonization Society [Footnote: McPherson, Liberia;\r\nMcMaster, United States, IV., 556 et seq.] was incorporated in 1816,\r\nand it found support, not only from antislavery agitators like\r\nLundy, who edited the \"Genius of Universal Emancipation\" at\r\nBaltimore, but also from slave-holders like Jefferson, Clay, and\r\nRandolph. It was the design of this society to found on the coast of\r\nAfrica a colony of free blacks, brought from the United States.\r\nAlthough, after unsuccessful efforts, Liberia was finally\r\nestablished in the twenties, with the assistance of the general\r\ngovernment (but not under its jurisdiction), it never promoted state\r\nemancipation. Nevertheless, at first it met with much sympathy in\r\nVirginia, where in 1820 the governor proposed to the legislature the\r\nuse of one-third of the state revenue as a fund to promote the\r\nemancipation and deportation of the Negroes. [Footnote: Jefferson,\r\nWritings (Ford's ed.), X., 173, 178; Niles' Register, XVII., 363;\r\nKing, Life and Corresp. of King, VI., 342; Adams, Memoirs, IV.,\r\n293.]\r\n\r\nThe unprofitableness of slavery in the border states, where outworn\r\nfields, the decline of tobacco culture, and the competition of\r\nwestern lands bore hard on the planter, [Footnote: See chap. iv.\r\nabove; Hart, Slavery and Abolition (Am. Nation, XVI.), chap. iv.]\r\nnow became an argument in favor of, permitting slavery to pass\r\nfreely into the new country of the west. Any limitation of the area\r\nof slavery would diminish the value of the slaves and would leave\r\nthe old south to support, under increasingly hard conditions, the\r\nredundant and unwelcome slave population in its midst. The hard\r\ntimes from 1817 to 1820 rendered slave property a still greater\r\nburden to Virginia. Moreover, the increase of the proportion of\r\nslaves to whites, if slavery were confined to the region east of the\r\nMississippi, might eventually make possible a servile insurrection,\r\nparticularly if foreign war should break out. All of these\r\ndifficulties would be met, in the opinion of the south, by\r\nscattering the existing slaves and thus mitigating the evil without\r\nincreasing the number of those in bondage.\r\n\r\nIt was seen that the struggle was not simply one of morals and of\r\nrival social and industrial institutions, but was a question of\r\npolitical power between the two great and opposing sections,\r\ninterested, on the one side, in manufacturing and in the raising of\r\nfood products under a system of free labor; and, on the other, in\r\nthe production of the great staples, cotton, tobacco, and sugar, by\r\nthe use of slave labor. Already the southern section had shown its\r\nopposition to tariff and internal improvements, which the majority\r\nof, the northern states vehemently favored. In other words, the\r\nslavery issue was seen to be a struggle for sectional domination.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the nation in 1790, the population of the north\r\nand the south was almost exactly balanced. Steadily, however, the\r\nfree states drew ahead, until in 1820 they possessed a population of\r\n5,152,000 against 4,485,000 for the slave-holding states and\r\nterritories; and in the House of Representatives, by the operation\r\nof the three-fifths ratio, the free states could muster 105 votes to\r\nbut 81 for the slave states. Thus power had passed definitely to the\r\nnorth in the House of Representatives. The instinct for self-\r\npreservation that led the planters to stand out against an\r\napportionment in their legislatures which would throw power into the\r\nhands of non-slaveholders now led them to seek for some means to\r\nprotect the interests of their minority section in the nation as a\r\nwhole. The Senate offered such an opportunity: by the alternate\r\nadmission of free and slave states from 1802 to 1818, out of the\r\ntwenty-two states of the nation eleven were slave-holding and eleven\r\nfree. If the south retained this balance, the Senate could block the\r\naction of the majority which controlled the lower House.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation when the application of Missouri for\r\nadmission as a state in 1819 presented to Congress the whole\r\nquestion of slavery beyond the Mississippi, where freedom and\r\nslavery had found a new fighting-ground. East of the Mississippi the\r\nOhio was a natural dividing-line; farther west there appeared no\r\nobvious boundary between slavery and freedom. By a natural process\r\nof selection, the valleys of the western tributaries of the\r\nMississippi, as far north as the Arkansas and Missouri, in which\r\nslaves had been allowed while it was a part of French and Spanish\r\nLouisiana (no restraints having been imposed by Congress), received\r\nan increasing proportion of the slave-holding planters. It would, in\r\nthe ordinary course of events, become the area of slave states.\r\n\r\nThe struggle began in the House of Representatives, when the\r\napplication of Missouri for statehood was met by an amendment,\r\nintroduced by Tallmadge of New York, February 13, 1819, [Footnote:\r\nAnnals of Cong., 15 Cong., 2 Sess., I., 1170.] providing that\r\nfurther introduction of slavery be prohibited and that all children\r\nborn within the state after admission should be free at the age of\r\ntwenty-five years. [Footnote: See amended form in House Journal, 15\r\nCong., 2 Sess., 272.] Tallmadge had already showed his attitude on\r\nthis question when in 1818 he opposed the admission of Illinois\r\nunder its constitution, which seemed to him to make insufficient\r\nbarriers to slavery. Brief as was the first Missouri debate, the\r\nwhole subject was opened up by arguments to which later discussion\r\nadded but little. The speaker, Henry Clay, in spite of the fact that\r\nearly in his political career he had favored gradual emancipation in\r\nKentucky, led the opposition to restriction. His principal reliance\r\nwas upon the arguments that the evils of slavery would be mitigated\r\nby diffusion, and that the proposed restriction was\r\nunconstitutional. Tallmadge and Taylor, of New York, combated these\r\narguments so vigorously and with such bold challenge of the whole\r\nsystem of slavery in new territories, that Cobb, of Georgia,\r\ndeclared, \"You have kindled a fire which all the waters of the ocean\r\ncannot put out, which seas of blood can only extinguish.\" [Footnote:\r\nAnnals of Cong., 15 Coneg., 2 Sess., I., 1204.]\r\n\r\nThe first clause of Tallmadge's motion was carried (February 16,\r\n1819) by a vote of 87 to 76, and the second by 82 to 78. [Footnote:\r\nIbid., 1214.] Taylor was emboldened to offer (February 18) to the\r\nbill for the organization of Arkansas territory an amendment by\r\nwhich slavery should be excluded, whereupon McLane, of Delaware,\r\ntentatively proposed that a line should be drawn west of the\r\nMississippi, dividing the territories between freedom and slavery.\r\nThus early was the whole question presented to Congress. In the\r\nSenate, Tallmadge's amendment was lost (February 27) by a vote of 22\r\nto 16, several northern senators adhering to the south; and Congress\r\nadjourned without action. [Footnote: But Arkansas was organized as a\r\nterritory without restriction.]\r\n\r\nThe issue was then transferred to the people, and in all quarters of\r\nthe Union vehement discussions took place upon the question of\r\nimposing an anti-slavery restriction upon Missouri. Mass-meetings in\r\nthe northern states took up the agitation, and various state\r\nlegislatures, including Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Ohio,\r\nand even the slave state of Delaware, passed resolutions with\r\nsubstantial unanimity against the further introduction of slaves\r\ninto the territories of the United States, and against the admission\r\nof new slave states. Pennsylvania, so long the trusted ally of the\r\nsouth, invoked her sister states \"to refuse to covenant with crime\"\r\nby spreading the \"cruelties of slavery, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi to the shores of the Pacific.\" From the south came\r\nequally insistent protests against restriction. [Footnote: Niles'\r\nRegister, XVII., 296, 307, 334, 342-344, 395. 399. 400, 416; Ames,\r\nState Docs. on Federal Relations, No. 5, p. 4.]\r\n\r\nNo argument in the debate in 1819 was more effective than the speech\r\nof Rufus King in the Senate, which was widely circulated as a\r\ncampaign document expressing the northern view. King's antislavery\r\nattitude, shown as early as 1785, when he made an earnest fight to\r\nsecure the exclusion of slavery from the territories, [Footnote:\r\nMcLaughlin, Confederation and Constitution (Am. Nation, X.), chap.\r\nvii.] was clearly stated in his constitutional argument in favor of\r\nrestriction on Missouri, and his speech may be accepted as typical.\r\n[Footnote: Niles' Register, XVII., 215; King, Life and Corresp. of\r\nKing, VI., 690.] But it was also the speech of an old-time\r\nFederalist, apprehensive of the growth of western power under\r\nsouthern leadership. He held that, under the power of making all\r\nneedful rules and regulations respecting the territory and other\r\nproperty of the United States, Congress had the right to prohibit\r\nslavery in the Louisiana purchase, which belonged to the United\r\nStates in full dominion. Congress was further empowered, but not\r\nrequired, to admit new states into the Union. Since the Constitution\r\ncontained no express provision respecting slavery in a new state,\r\nCongress could make the perpetual prohibition of slavery a condition\r\nof admission. In support of this argument, King appealed to the\r\nprecedent of the Ordinance of 1787, and of the states of Ohio,\r\nIndiana, and Illinois, all admitted on the conditions expressed in\r\nthat ordinance. In admitting the state of Louisiana in 1812, a\r\ndifferent group of conditions had been attached, such as the\r\nrequirement of the use of the English language in judicial and\r\nlegislative proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe next question was the effect of the Louisiana treaty, by which\r\nthe United States had made this promise: \"The inhabitants of the\r\nceded territory shall be incorporated in the Union of the United\r\nStates, and admitted as soon as possible, according to the\r\nprinciples of the Federal constitution, to the enjoyment of all the\r\nrights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the United States;\r\nand in the mean time they shall be maintained and protected in the\r\nfree enjoyment of their liberty, property and the religion which\r\nthey profess.\" [Footnote: U. S. Treaties and Conventions, 332.] King\r\ncontended that, by the admission of Missouri to the Union, its\r\ninhabitants would obtain all of the \"federal\" rights which citizens\r\nof the United States derived from its Constitution, though not the\r\nrights derived from the constitutions and laws of the various\r\nstates. In his opinion, the term PROPERTY did not describe slaves,\r\ninasmuch as the terms of the treaty should be construed according to\r\ndiplomatic usage, and not all nations permitted slavery. In any\r\ncase, property acquired since the territory was occupied by the\r\nUnited States was not included in the treaty, and, therefore, the\r\nprohibition of the future introduction of slaves into Missouri would\r\nnot affect its guarantees.\r\n\r\nCould Missouri, after admission, revoke the consent to the exclusion\r\nof slavery under its powers as a sovereign state? Such action, King\r\ndeclared, would be contrary to the obligations of good faith, for\r\neven sovereigns were bound by their engagements. Moreover, the\r\njudicial power of the United States would deliver from bondage any\r\nperson detained as a slave in a state which had agreed, as a\r\ncondition of admission, that slavery should be excluded.\r\n\r\nHaving thus set forth the constitutional principles, King next took\r\nup the expediency of the exclusion of slavery from new states. He\r\nstruck with firm hand the chord of sectional rivalry in his argument\r\nagainst the injustice to the north of creating new slave-holding\r\nstates, which would have a political representation, under the\r\n\"federal ratio,\" not possessed by the north. Under this provision\r\nfor counting three-fifths of the slaves, five free persons in\r\nVirginia (so he argued) had as much power in the choice of\r\nrepresentatives to Congress and in the appointment of presidential\r\nelectors as seven free persons in any of the states in which slavery\r\ndid not exist. The disproportionate power and influence allowed to\r\nthe original slave-holding states was a necessary sacrifice to the\r\nestablishment of the Constitution; but the arrangement was limited\r\nto the old thirteen states, and was not applicable to the states\r\nmade out of territory since acquired. This argument had been\r\nfamiliar to New England ever since the purchase of Louisiana.\r\nFinally, he argued that the safety of the Union demanded the\r\nexclusion of slavery west of the Mississippi, where the exposed and\r\nimportant frontier needed a barrier of free citizens against the\r\nattacks of future assailants.\r\n\r\nTo the southern mind, King's sectional appeal unblushingly raised\r\nthe prospect of the rule of a free majority over a slave-holding\r\nminority, the downfall of the ascendancy so long held by the south,\r\nand the creation of a new Union, in which the western states should\r\nbe admitted on terms of subordination to the will of the majority,\r\nwhose power would thus become perpetual. [Footnote: King, Life and\r\nCorresp. of King, VI., 205, 267, 279, 288, 329, 339-344, 501;\r\nJefferson, Writings (Ford's ed.), X., 162, 172, 280; Tyler, Tylers,\r\nI., 316.]\r\n\r\nWhen the next Congress met, in December, 1819, the admission of\r\nAlabama was quickly completed; and the House also passed a bill\r\nadmitting Maine to the Union, Massachusetts having agreed to this\r\ndivision of the ancient commonwealth, on condition that consent\r\nCongress should be obtained prior to March 4, 1820. The Senate,\r\nquick to see the opportunity afforded by the situation, combined the\r\nbill for the admission of Maine with that for the unrestricted\r\nadmission of Missouri, a proposition carried (February 16, 1820) by\r\na vote of 23 to 21. Senator Thomas, who represented Illinois, which,\r\nas we have seen, was divided in its interests on the question of\r\nslavery, and who, as the vote showed, could produce a tie in the\r\nSenate, moved a compromise amendment, providing for the admission of\r\nMissouri as a slave state and for the prohibition of slavery north\r\nof 36 degrees 30' in the rest of the Louisiana purchase; and on the\r\nnext day his amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 34 to 10.\r\n\r\nThe debate in the Senate was marked by another speech of Rufus King,\r\njust re-elected a senator from New York by an almost unanimous vote.\r\nWith this prestige, and the knowledge that the states of\r\nPennsylvania and New York stood behind him, he reiterated his\r\narguments with such power that John Quincy Adams, who listened to\r\nthe debate, wrote in his diary that \"the great slave-holders in the\r\nHouse gnawed their lips and clenched their fists as they heard him.\"\r\n[Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, IV., 522; see Cong. Globe, 30 Cong., 2\r\nSess., App. 63-67.]\r\n\r\nThe case for the south was best presented by William Pinkney, of\r\nMaryland, the leader of the American bar, a man of fashion, but an\r\norator of the first rank. His argument, on lines that the debates\r\nhad made familiar, was stated with such eloquence, force, and\r\ngraphic power that it produced the effect of a new presentation.\r\nWaiving the question whether Congress might refuse admission to a\r\nstate, he held that, if it were admitted, it was admitted into a\r\nunion of equals, and hence could not be subjected to any special\r\nrestriction. [Footnote: Annals of Cong., 16 Cong., 1 Sess., I., 389\r\net seq.] Without denying the danger of the extension of slavery, he\r\nargued that it was not for Congress to stay the course of this dark\r\ntorrent. \"If you have power,\" said he, \"to restrict the new states\r\non admission, you may squeeze a new-born sovereign state to the size\r\nof a pigmy.\" There would be nothing to hinder Congress \"from\r\nplundering power after power at the expense of the new states,\"\r\nuntil they should be left empty shadows of domestic sovereignty, in\r\na union between giants and dwarfs, between power and feebleness. In\r\nvivid oratory he conjured up this vision of an unequal union, into\r\nwhich the new state would enter, \"shorn of its beams,\" a mere\r\nservant of the majority. From the point of view of the political\r\ntheory of a confederation, his contention had force, and the hot-\r\ntempered west was not likely to submit to an inferior status in the\r\nUnion. Nevertheless, the debates and votes in the Constitutional\r\nConvention of 1787 seem to show that the fathers of the Constitution\r\nintended to leave Congress free to impose limitations on the states\r\nat admission. [Footnote: Elliot, Debates, V., 492.]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the House of Representatives was continuing the\r\ndiscussion on the old lines. Although the arguments brought out\r\nlittle that had not been stated in the first Missouri debate, they\r\nwere restated day after day with an amplitude and a bitterness of\r\nfeeling that aggravated the hostility between the rival forces. Even\r\nunder this provocation, most southern members expressed their\r\nopinions on the morality and expediency of slavery in language that\r\naffords a strange contrast to their later utterances: in almost\r\nevery case they lamented its existence and demanded its dispersion\r\nthroughout the west as a means of alleviating their misfortune.\r\nAlthough most of the men who spoke on the point were from the\r\nregions where cotton was least cultivated, yet even Reid, of\r\nGeorgia, likened the south to an unfortunate man who \"wears a cancer\r\nin his bosom.\" [Footnote: Annals of Cong., 16 Cong., 1 Sess., I.,\r\n1025.] Tyler of Virginia, afterwards president of the United States,\r\ncharacterized slavery as a dark cloud, and asked, \"Will you permit\r\nthe lightnings of its wrath to break upon the South when by the\r\ninterposition of a wise system of legislation you may reduce it to a\r\nsummer's cloud?\" [Footnote: Ibid., II., 1391.] John Randolph, the\r\nultra-southerner, was quoted as saying that all the misfortunes of\r\nhis life were light in the balance when compared with the single\r\nmisfortune of having been born a master of slaves.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the argument of \"mitigation by diffusion,\" the south\r\nurged the injustice of excluding its citizens from the territories\r\nby making it impossible for the southern planter to migrate thither\r\nwith his property. On the side of the north, it was argued with\r\nequal energy that the spread of slaves into the west would\r\ninevitably increase their numbers and strengthen the institution.\r\nSince free labor was unable to work in the midst of slave labor,\r\nnorthern men would be effectively excluded from the territories\r\nwhich might be given over to slavery. Economic law, it was urged,\r\nwould make it almost certain that, in order to supply the vast area\r\nwhich it was proposed to devote to slavery, the African slave-trade\r\nwould be reopened. As the struggle waxed hot, as the arguments\r\nbrought out with increasing clearness the fundamental differences\r\nbetween the sections, threats of disunion were freely exchanged.\r\n[Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, V., 13, 53; Benton, Abridgment of\r\nDebates, XIII., 607.] Even Clay predicted the existence of several\r\nnew confederacies. [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, IV., 526.] Nor were\r\nthe extremists of the north unwilling to accept this alternative.\r\n[Footnote:  King, Life and Corresp. of King, VI., 274, 286, 287,\r\n387.] But the danger of southern secession was diminished because\r\nMonroe was ready to veto any bill which excluded slavery from\r\nMissouri. [Footnote: Cong. Globe, 30 Cong., 2 Sess., App. 67.] While\r\nstill engaged in its own debates, the House received the compromise\r\nproposal from the Senate. At first the majority remained firm and\r\nrefused to accept it. [Footnote: Woodburn, in Am. Hist. Assoc.,\r\nReport 1893, p. 251-297.] March 1, 1820, the House passed its own\r\nbill imposing the restriction on Missouri, by a vote of 91 to 82. By\r\nthe efforts of the compromisers, however, a committee of conference\r\nwas arranged, which on the very next day resulted in the surrender\r\nof the House. The vote on striking out the restriction on Missouri\r\nwas 90 to 87. New England gave 7 ayes to 33 nays; the middle states,\r\n8 to 46; the south cast 58 votes for striking out, and none against\r\nit; the northwest gave all its 8 votes against striking out the\r\nrestriction; while the 17 southwestern votes were solidly in favor\r\nof admitting Missouri as a slave state.\r\n\r\nThus, while the southern phalanx in opposition remained firm, enough\r\nmembers were won over from the northern ranks to defeat the\r\nrestrictionists. Some of these deserters [Footnote: See King, Life\r\nand Corresp. of King, VI., 291, 329; Benton, View, I., 10; Adams,\r\nMemoirs, V., 15, 307. Randolph applied to them the term\r\n\"doughfaces.\"] from the northern cause were influenced by the\r\nknowledge that the admission of Maine would fail without this\r\nconcession; others, by the constitutional argument; others, by the\r\nfear of disunion; and still others, by the apprehension that the\r\nunity of the Democratic party was menaced by the new sectional\r\nalignment, which included among its leaders men who had been\r\nprominent in the councils of the Federalists. By the final solution,\r\nit was agreed (134 to 42) to admit Missouri as a slave state and\r\nMaine as a free state; while all of the rest of the territory,\r\npossessed by the United States west of the Mississippi and north of\r\n36 degrees 30' was pledged to freedom. Yet the fate of the measure\r\nwas uncertain, for some of Monroe's southern friends strongly urged\r\nhim still to veto the compromise. [Footnote: Cong. Globe, 30 Cong.,\r\n2 Sess., App. 64.] The president submitted to the cabinet the\r\nquestion whether Congress had the right to prohibit slavery in a\r\nterritory, and whether the section of the Missouri bill which\r\ninterdicted slavery forever in the territory north of 36 degrees 30'\r\nwas applicable only to the territorial condition, or also to states\r\nmade from the territory. John Quincy Adams notes in his diary that\r\n\"it was unanimously agreed that Congress have the power to prohibit\r\nslavery in the Territories\"; though he adds that neither Crawford,\r\nCalhoun, nor Wirt could find any express power to that effect given\r\nin the Constitution. [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, V., 5.] In order to\r\navoid the difficulty arising from the fact that Adams alone believed\r\nthe word \"forever\" to apply to states as well as territories, the\r\npresident modified the question so that all would be able to answer\r\nthat the act was constitutional, leaving each member to construe the\r\nsection to suit himself.\r\n\r\nAlthough apparently the Missouri struggle was thus brought to a\r\nconclusion, it is necessary to take note of two succeeding episodes\r\nin the contest, which immediately revived the whole question,\r\nembittered the antagonism, threatened the Union, and were settled by\r\nnew compromises. In her constitution, Missouri not only incorporated\r\nguarantees of a slavery system, but also a provision against the\r\nadmission of free Negroes to the state. Application for admission to\r\nthe Union under this constitution in the fall of 1820 brought on a\r\ncontest perhaps more heated and more dangerous to the Union than the\r\nprevious struggle. Holding that Missouri's clause against free\r\nNegroes infringed the provision of the federal Constitution\r\nguaranteeing the rights of citizens of the respective states,\r\nnorthern leaders reopened the whole question by refusing to vote for\r\nthe admission of Missouri with the obnoxious clause. Again the north\r\nrevealed its mastery of the House, and the south its control of the\r\nSenate, and a deadlock followed. Under the skilful management of\r\nClay, a new compromise was framed, by which Missouri was required,\r\nthrough her legislature, to promise that the objectionable clause\r\nshould never be construed to authorize the passage of any laws by\r\nwhich any citizen of either of the states of the Union should be\r\nexcluded from the enjoyment of any of the privileges and immunities\r\nto which such citizen was entitled under the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. This Missouri accepted, but the legislature somewhat\r\ncontemptuously added that it was without power to bind the state.\r\n[Footnote: Niles' Register, XX., 388, cf. 300.]\r\n\r\nWhile this debate was in progress, and the problem of the status of\r\nMissouri, which had already established a constitution and claimed\r\nto be a state, was under consideration, the question of counting the\r\nMissouri vote in the presidential election of 1820 was raised. For\r\nthis a third compromise was framed by Clay, by which the result of\r\nthe election was stated as it would be with and without Missouri's\r\nvote. Since Monroe had been elected by a vote all but unanimous, the\r\nresult was in either case the same; this theoretical question,\r\nnevertheless, was fraught with dangerous possibilities. Missouri was\r\nfinally admitted by the proclamation of President Monroe, dated\r\nAugust 10, 1821, more than three years from the first application\r\nfor statehood.\r\n\r\nIn a large view of American history, the significance of this great\r\nstruggle cannot be too highly emphasized. Although the danger passed\r\nby and the ocean became placid, yet the storm in many ways changed\r\nthe coast-line of American politics and broke new channels for the\r\nprogress of the nation. The future had been revealed to far-sighted\r\nstatesmen, who realized that this was but the beginning, not the\r\nend, of the struggle. \"This momentous question,\" wrote Jefferson,\r\n\"like a fire bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror.\r\nI considered it at once as the knell of the Union. It is hushed,\r\nindeed, for the moment. But this is a reprieve only, not a final\r\nsentence. A geographical line, coinciding with a marked principle,\r\nmoral and political, once conceived and held up to the angry\r\npassions of men, will never be obliterated; and every new irritation\r\nwill mark it deeper and deeper.\" [Footnote: Jefferson, Writings\r\n(Ford's ed.), X., 157.]\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams relates a contemporaneous conversation with\r\nCalhoun, in which the latter took the ground that, if a dissolution\r\nof the Union should follow, the south would be compelled to form an\r\nalliance, offensive and defensive, with Great Britain, though he\r\nadmitted that it would be returning pretty much to the colonial\r\nstate. When Adams, with unconscious prophecy of Sherman's march\r\nthrough Georgia, pressed Calhoun with the question whether the\r\nnorth, cut off from its natural outlet upon the ocean, \"would fall\r\nback upon its rocks bound hand and foot, to starve, or whether it\r\nwould not retain its powers of locomotion to move southward by\r\nland,\" Calhoun answered that the southern states would find it\r\nnecessary to make their communities military. [Footnote: Adams,\r\nMemoirs, IV., 530, 531.]\r\n\r\nTo Adams himself the present question was but a \"title page to a\r\ngreat tragic volume.\" He believed that, if dissolution of the Union\r\nshould result from the slavery question, it would be followed by\r\nuniversal emancipation of the slaves, and he was ready to\r\ncontemplate such a dissolution of the Union, upon a point involving\r\nslavery and no other, believing that \"the Union might then be\r\nreorganized on the fundamental principle of emancipation.\" \"This\r\nobject,\" wrote he, \"is vast in its compass, awful in its prospects,\r\nsublime and beautiful in its issue. A life devoted to it would be\r\nnobly spent or sacrificed.\" [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, IV., 531.]\r\nLooking forward to civil war, he declared: \"So glorious would be its\r\nfinal issue, that as God shall judge me I do not say that it is not\r\nto be desired.\" [Footnote: Ibid., V., 210.] But as yet he confided\r\nthese thoughts to his diary. The south was far from contented with\r\nthe compromise, and her leading statesmen, Calhoun especially, came\r\nbitterly to regret both the concession in the matter of admitting\r\nfederal control over slavery in the territories, and the division of\r\nthe Louisiana purchase into spheres of influence which left to the\r\nslave-holding section that small apex of the triangle practically\r\nembraced in Arkansas. While the north received an area capable of\r\nbeing organized into many free states, the south could expect from\r\nthe remaining territory awarded her only one state.\r\n\r\nAmong the immediate effects of the contest was its influence upon\r\nMonroe, who was the more ready to relinquish the American claim to\r\nTexas in the negotiations over Florida, because he feared that the\r\nacquisition of this southern province would revive the antagonism of\r\nthe northern antislavery forces. [Footnote: Monroe, Writings, VI.,\r\n127; cf. Adams, Memoirs, V., 25, 54, 68.]\r\n\r\nThe south learned also the lesson that slavery needed defense\r\nagainst the power of the majority, and that it must shape its\r\npolitical doctrine and its policy to this end. But it would be a\r\nmistake to emphasize too strongly the immediate effect in this\r\nrespect. Slavery was not yet accepted as the foundation of southern\r\nsocial and economic life. The institution was still mentioned with\r\nregret by southern leaders, and there were still efforts in the\r\nborder states to put it in the process of extinction. South Carolina\r\nleaders were still friendly to national power, and for several years\r\nthe ruling party in that state deprecated appeals to state\r\nsovereignty. [Footnote: See chap, xviii. below.] In the next few\r\nyears other questions, of an economic and judicial nature, were even\r\nmore influential, as a direct issue, than the slavery question. But\r\nthe economic life of the south was based on slavery, and the section\r\nbecame increasingly conscious that the current of national\r\nlegislation was shaped by the majority against their interests.\r\nTheir political alliances in the north had failed them in the time\r\nof test, and the Missouri question disclosed the possibility of a\r\nnew organization of parties threatening that southern domination\r\nwhich had swayed the Union for the past twenty years. [Footnote:\r\nAdams, Memoirs, IV., 529; King, Life and Corresp. of King, VI., 501;\r\nJefferson, Writings, X., 175, 193 n.; cf. chap. xi. below; Hart,\r\nSlavery and Abolition (Am. Nation, XVI.), chap, xviii.]\r\n\r\nThe slavery struggle derived its national significance from the\r\nwest, into which expanding sections carried warring institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPARTY POLITICS (1820-1822)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the superficial observer, politics might have seemed never more\r\ntranquil than when, in 1820, James Monroe received all but one of\r\nthe electoral votes for his second term as president of the United\r\nStates. One New Hampshire elector preferred John Quincy Adams,\r\nalthough he was not a candidate, and this deprived Monroe of ranking\r\nwith Washington in the unanimity of official approval. But in truth\r\nthe calm was deceptive. The election of 1820 was an armistice rather\r\nthan a real test of political forces. The forming party factions\r\nwere not yet ready for the final test of strength, most of the\r\ncandidates were members of the cabinet, and the reelection of\r\nMonroe, safe, conciliatory, and judicious, afforded an opportunity\r\nfor postponing the issue.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the Missouri contest had in it the possibility of a\r\nrevolutionary division of the Republican party into two parties on\r\nsectional lines. The aged Jefferson, keen of scent for anything that\r\nthreatened the ascendancy of the triumphant democracy, saw in the\r\ndissolution of the old alliance between Virginia and the\r\n\"fanaticized\" Pennsylvania, [Footnote: Jefferson, Writings (Ford's\r\ned.), X., 161, 171, 172, 177, 179, 192, 193 n., 279; King, Life and\r\nCorresp. of King, VI., 279, 282, 290: Cong. Globe, 30 Cong., 2\r\nSess., App. 63-67.] in the heat of the Missouri conflict, the menace\r\nof a revived Federalist party, and the loss of Virginia's northern\r\nfollowing. So hotly did Virginia resent the Missouri Compromise,\r\nthat while the question was still pending, in February, 1820, her\r\nlegislative caucus, which had assembled to nominate presidential\r\nelectors, indignantly adjourned on learning that Monroe favored the\r\nmeasure. \"I trust in God,\" said H. St. George Tucker, \"if the\r\npresident does sign a bill to that effect, the Southern people will\r\nbe able to find some man who has not committed himself to our foes;\r\nfor such are, depend on it, the Northern Politicians.\" [Footnote:\r\nWilliam and Mary College Quarterly, X., 11, 15.] But the sober\r\nsecond thought of Virginia sustained Monroe. On the other side,\r\nRufus King believed that the issue of the Missouri question would\r\nsettle \"forever the dominion of the Union.\" \"Old Mr. Adams,\" said\r\nhe, \"as he is the first, will on this hypothesis be the last\r\nPresident from a free state.\" [Footnote: King, Life and Corresp. of\r\nKing, 267; cf. Adams, Memoirs, IV., 528.]\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the individual interests of the south were\r\nstronger in opposing than those of the north in supporting a\r\nlimitation of slavery; [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, IV., 533.] the\r\nnorthern phalanx had hardly formed before it began to dissolve.\r\n[Footnote: Benton, Thirty Years' View, I., 10.] Nevertheless, the\r\nMissouri question played some part in the elections in most of the\r\nstates. In Pennsylvania, under the leadership of Duane, the editor\r\nof the Aurora, electors favorable to Clinton were nominated on an\r\nantislavery ticket, [Footnote: Niles' Register, XIX., 129; National\r\nAdvocate, October 27, 1820; Franklin Gazette, October 25, November\r\n8, 1820 (election returns); Ames, State Docs. on Federal Relations,\r\nNo. 5, p. 5.] but, outside of Philadelphia and the adjacent\r\ndistrict, this ticket received but slight support. With few\r\nexceptions, the northern congressmen who had voted with the south\r\nfailed of re-election.\r\n\r\nThe elections in the various states in this year showed more\r\npolitical division than was revealed by the vote for president, and\r\nthey showed that in state politics the Federalist party was by no\r\nmeans completely extinct. In the congressional elections the flood\r\nof Republicanism left only isolated islands of Federalism\r\nunsubmerged. In Massachusetts eight of the thirteen members\r\nprofessed this political faith; New York returned some half-dozen\r\nmen whose affiliations were with the same party; from Pennsylvania\r\ncame a somewhat larger number; and they numbered nearly half of the\r\ndelegation of Maryland. The cities of New York and Philadelphia were\r\nrepresented by Federalists, and there were three or four other\r\ndistricts, chiefly in New England, which adhered to the old party.\r\nThere were also a few congressmen from the south who had been\r\nmembers of this organization. On the whole, however, the Federalists\r\nawaited the new development of parties, determined to secure the\r\nbest terms from those to whom they should transfer their allegiance.\r\nIn New England, as has already been pointed out, [Footnote: See\r\nchap. ii. above.] the toleration movement was completing its work of\r\ntransferring power to democracy.\r\n\r\nMore important than local issues or the death throes of federalism,\r\nwas the democratic tendency revealed in the constitutional\r\nconventions of this period. Between 1816 and 1830, ten states either\r\nestablished new constitutions or revised their old ones. In this the\r\ninfluence of the new west was peculiarly important. All of the new\r\nstates which were formed in that region, after the War of 1812, gave\r\nevidence in their constitutions of the democratic spirit of the\r\nfrontier. With the exception of Mississippi, where the voter was\r\nobliged either to be a tax-payer or a member of the militia, all the\r\nwestern states entered the Union with manhood suffrage, and all of\r\nthem, in contrast with the south, from which their settlers had\r\nchiefly been drawn, provided that apportionment of the legislature\r\nshould be based upon the white population, thus accepting the\r\ndoctrine of the rule of the majority rather than that of property.\r\nAs the flood of population moved towards the west and offered these\r\nattractive examples of democratic growth, the influence reacted on\r\nthe older states. In her constitution of 1818, Connecticut gave the\r\nfranchise to tax-payers or members of the militia, as did\r\nMassachusetts and New York in their constitutions of 1821. Maine\r\nprovided in her constitution of 1820 for manhood suffrage, but by\r\nthis time there was but slight difference between manhood suffrage\r\nand one based upon tax-paying.\r\n\r\nWebster in Massachusetts and Chancellor Kent in New York viewed with\r\nalarm the prospect that freehold property should cease to be the\r\nfoundation of government. Kent particularly warned the landed class\r\nthat \"one master capitalist with his one hundred apprentices, and\r\njourneymen, and agents, and dependents, will bear down at the polls\r\nan equal number of farmers of small estates in his vicinity, who\r\ncannot safely unite for their common defense.\" [Footnote: Carter and\r\nStone, Reports of the Proceedings and Debates of the Convention of\r\n1821, 222.] It was the new counties of New York, particularly those\r\nof the western and northeastern frontier, which were the stronghold\r\nof the reform movement in that state. The abolition of the council\r\nof appointments and the council of revision by the New York\r\nconvention contributed to the transfer of power to the people. But\r\nunder the leadership of Van Buren a group of politicians, dubbed\r\n\"The Albany Regency,\" controlled the political machinery as\r\neffectively as before. [Footnote: McMaster, United States, V., 373-\r\n432; ibid., Rights of Man, 61; MacDonald, Jacksonian Democracy (Am.\r\nNation, XV.), chap. iv.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign for the presidency of 1824 may be said to have begun as\r\nearly as 1816. [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, V., 89.] Adams observed in\r\n1818 that the government was assuming daily the character of cabal,\r\n\"and preparation, not for the next Presidential election, but for\r\nthe one after\"; [Footnote: Ibid., IV., 193.] and by 1820, when the\r\npolitical sea appeared so placid, and parties had apparently\r\ndissolved, bitter factional fights between the friends of the rival\r\ncandidates constituted the really significant indications of\r\nAmerican politics. From the details of the personal struggles\r\n(usually less important to the student of party history) one must\r\nlearn the tendency towards the reappearance of parties in this\r\nperiod, when idealists believed that all factions had been fused\r\ninto one triumphant organization. In all of the great sections,\r\ncandidates appeared, anxious to consolidate the support of their own\r\nsection and to win a following in the nation. It is time that we\r\nshould survey these men, for the personal traits of the aspirants\r\nfor the presidency had a larger influence than ever before or since\r\nin the history of the country. Moreover, we are able to see in these\r\ncandidates the significant features of the sections from which they\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nNew England was reluctantly and slowly coming to the conclusion that\r\nJohn Quincy Adams was the only available northern candidate. Adams\r\ndid not fully represent the characteristics of his section, for he\r\nneither sprang from the democracy of the interior of New England nor\r\ndid he remain loyal to the Federalist ideas that controlled the\r\ncommercial interests of the coast. Moreover, of all the statesmen\r\nwhom the nation produced, he had had the largest opportunity to make\r\na comparative study of government. As an eleven-year-old boy, he\r\nwent with his father to Paris in 1778, and from then until 1817,\r\nwhen he became Monroe's secretary of state, nearly half his time was\r\nspent at European courts. He served in France, Holland, Sweden,\r\nRussia, Prussia, and England, and had been senator of the United\r\nStates from Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThus Adams entered on the middle period of his career, a man of\r\nlearning and broad culture, rich in experience of national affairs,\r\nfamiliar with the centers of Old-World civilization and with methods\r\nof European administration. He had touched life too broadly, in too\r\nmany countries, to be provincial in his policy. In the minds of a\r\nlarge and influential body of his fellow-citizens, the Federalists,\r\nhe was an apostate, for in the days of the embargo he had warned\r\nJefferson of the temper of his section, had resigned, and had been\r\nread out of the party. The unpopularity, as well as the fame, of his\r\nfather, was the heritage of the son. Perhaps the most decisive\r\nindication of the weakening of sectional bias by his foreign\r\ntraining is afforded by his diplomatic policy. An expansionist by\r\nnature, he had been confirmed in the faith by his training in\r\nforeign courts. \"If we are not taken for Romans we shall be taken\r\nfor Jews,\" he exclaimed to one who questioned the wisdom of the bold\r\nutterances of his diplomatic correspondence.\r\n\r\nIn one important respect Adams was the personification of his\r\nsection. He was a Puritan, and his whole career was deeply affected\r\nby the fact. A man of method and regularity, tireless in his work\r\n(for he rose before the dawn and worked till midnight), he never had\r\na childhood and never tried to achieve self-forgetfulness. His\r\ndiary, printed in twelve volumes, is a unique document for the study\r\nof the Puritan in politics. Not that it was an entirely unreserved\r\nexpression of his soul, for he wrote with a consciousness that\r\nposterity would read the record, and its pages are a compound of\r\napparently spontaneous revelation of his inmost thought and of\r\nsilence upon subjects of which we would gladly know more. He had the\r\nPuritan's restraint, self-scrutiny, and self-condemnation. \"I am,\"\r\nhe writes, \"a man of reserved, cold, austere, and forbidding\r\nmanners.\" Nor can this estimate be pronounced unjust. He was a\r\nlonely man, communing with his soul in his diary more than with a\r\ncircle of admiring friends. It was not easy for men to love John\r\nQuincy Adams. The world may respect the man who regulates his course\r\nby a daily dead-reckoning, but it finds it easier to make friends\r\nwith him who stumbles towards rectitude by the momentum of his own\r\nnature. Popularity, in any deep sense, was denied him. This\r\ndeprivation he repaid by harsh, vindictive, and censorious judgments\r\nupon his contemporaries, and by indifference to popular prejudices.\r\nWith the less lovely qualities of the Puritan aggravated by his own\r\ncritical nature, Adams found himself in a struggle for the\r\npresidency against some of the most engaging personalities in\r\nAmerican history. He must win over his enemies in New England and\r\nattach that section to his fortunes; he must find friends in the\r\nmiddle states, conciliate the south, and procure a following in the\r\nwest, where Clay, the Hotspur of debate, with all the power of the\r\nspeakership behind him, and Jackson, \"Old Hickory,\" the hero of New\r\nOrleans, contested the field. And all the time he must satisfy his\r\nconscience, and reach his goal by the craft and strength of his\r\nintellect rather than by the arts of popular management. No\r\nstatesman ever handled the problems of his public career with a\r\nkeener understanding of the conditions of success.\r\n\r\nThe middle region was too much divided by the game of politics\r\nplayed by her multitude of minor leaders to unite upon a favorite\r\nson in this campaign; but De Witt Clinton, finding elements of\r\nstrength in the prestige which his successful advocacy of the Erie\r\nCanal had brought to him throughout the region where internal\r\nimprovements were popular, and relying upon his old connections with\r\nthe Federalists, watched events with eager eye, waiting for an\r\nopportunity which never came. Although the south saw in Rufus King's\r\nadvocacy of the exclusion of slavery from Missouri a deep design to\r\nwin the presidency by an antislavery combination of the northern\r\nstates, there was little ground for this belief. In truth, the\r\nmiddle region was merely the fighting-ground for leaders in the\r\nother sections.\r\n\r\nIn the south, Calhoun and Crawford were already contending for the\r\nmastery. Each of them represented fundamental tendencies in the\r\nsection. Born in Virginia in 1772, Crawford had migrated with his\r\nfather in early childhood to South Carolina, and soon after to\r\nGeorgia. [Footnote: Phillips, \"Georgia and State Rights,\" in Am.\r\nHist. Assoc., Report 1901, II., 95; Cobb, Leisure Labors; Miller,\r\nBench and Bar of Georgia; West, \"Life and Times of William H.\r\nCrawford,\" in National Portrait Gallery, IV.; Adams, Life of\r\nGallatin. 598.] Here he became the leader of the Virginia element\r\nagainst the interior democracy. But in his coarse strength and\r\nadaptability the burly Georgian showed the impress which frontier\r\ninfluences had given to his state. His career in national politics\r\nbrought him strange alliances. This Georgia candidate had been no\r\nmere subject of the Virginia dynasty, for he supported John Adams in\r\nhis resistance to France in 1798; challenged the administration of\r\nJefferson by voting with the Federalists in the United States Senate\r\nagainst the embargo; and ridiculed the ambiguous message of Madison\r\nwhen the issue of peace or war with Great Britain was under\r\nconsideration. A fearless supporter of the recharter of the national\r\nbank, he had championed the doctrine of implied powers and denied\r\nthe right of a state to resist the laws of Congress except by\r\nchanging its representation or appealing to the sword under the\r\nright of revolution.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the period of this volume, Crawford joined the\r\nranks of the southerners who demanded a return to strict\r\nconstruction and insistence on state rights. In the congressional\r\ncaucus of 1816, he obtained 54 votes for the presidency against 65\r\nfor Monroe. Had not the influence of Madison been thrown for the\r\nlatter, it seems probable that Crawford would have obtained the\r\nnomination; but his strength in building up a following in Congress\r\nwas much greater than his popularity with the people at large.\r\nControlling the patronage of the treasury department, he enlarged\r\nhis political influence. As the author of the four-years'-tenure-of-\r\noffice act, in 1820, he has been vehemently criticized as a founder\r\nof the spoils system. But there are reasons for thinking that\r\nCrawford's advocacy of this measure was based upon considerations of\r\nefficiency at least as much as those of politics, [Footnote: Fish,\r\nCivil Service and Patronage, 66 et seq.] and the conduct of his\r\ndepartment was marked by sagacity. The administration of such a man\r\nwould probably have been characterized by an accommodating spirit\r\nwhich would have carried on the traditions of Monroe.\r\n\r\nIn the career of Calhoun are strikingly exhibited the changing\r\ncharacteristics of the south in this era. His grandfather was a\r\nScotch-Irishman who came to Pennsylvania with the emigration of that\r\npeople in the first half of the eighteenth century, and thence\r\nfollowed the stream of settlement that passed up the Great Valley\r\nand into South Carolina to the frontier, from which men like Daniel\r\nBoone crossed the mountains to the conquest of Kentucky and\r\nTennessee. [Footnote: Cf. Howard, Preliminaries of the Revolution\r\n(Am. Nation, VIII.), chap. xiii.] The Calhoun family were frontier\r\nIndian fighters, but, instead of crossing the mountains as did\r\nAndrew Jackson, Calhoun remained to grow up with his section and to\r\nshare its changes from a community essentially western to a cotton-\r\nplanting and slave-holding region. This is the clew to his career.\r\n\r\nIn his speech in the House of Representatives in 1817, on internal\r\nimprovements, Calhoun warned his colleagues against \"a low, sordid,\r\nselfish, and sectional spirit,\" and declared that \"in a country so\r\nextensive, and so various in its interests, what is necessary for\r\nthe common good, may apparently be opposed to the interests of\r\nparticular sections. It must be submitted to as the condition of our\r\ngreatness.\" [Footnote: Annals of Cong., 14 Cong., 2 Sess., 854,\r\n855.] This was the voice of the nationalistic west, as well as that\r\nof South Carolina in Calhoun's young manhood.\r\n\r\nIn view of his later career, it is significant that many of those\r\nwho described him in these youthful years of his nationalistic\r\npolicy found in him a noticeable tendency to rash speculation and\r\nnovelty. \"As a politician,\" said Senator Mills, of Massachusetts,\r\nabout 1823, he is \"too theorizing, speculative, and metaphysical,--\r\nmagnificent in his views of the powers and capacities of the\r\ngovernment, and of the virtue, intelligence, and wisdom of the\r\nPEOPLE. He is in favor of elevating, cherishing, and increasing all\r\nthe institutions of the government, and of a vigorous and energetic\r\nadministration of it. From his rapidity of thought, he is often\r\nwrong in his conclusions, and his theories are sometimes wild,\r\nextravagant, and impractical. He has always claimed to be, and is,\r\nof the Democratic party, but of a very different class from that of\r\nCrawford; more like Adams, and his schemes are sometimes denounced\r\nby his party as ultra-fanatical.\" [Footnote: Mass. Hist. Soc.,\r\nProceedings, XIX., 37 (1881-1882).]\r\n\r\nAnother contemporary, writing prior to 1824, declared: \"He wants, I\r\nthink, consistency and perseverance of mind, and seems incapable of\r\nlong-continued and patient investigation. What he does not see at\r\nthe first examination, he seldom takes pains to search for; but\r\nstill the lightning glance of his mind, and the rapidity with which\r\nhe analyzes, never fail to furnish him with all that may be\r\nnecessary for his immediate purposes. In his legislative career,\r\nwhich, though short, was uncommonly luminous, his love of novelty,\r\nand his apparent solicitude to astonish were so great, that he has\r\noccasionally been known to go beyond even the dreams of political\r\nvisionaries, and to propose schemes which were in their nature\r\nimpracticable or injurious, and which he seemed to offer merely for\r\nthe purpose of displaying the affluence of his mind, and the\r\nfertility of his ingenuity.\" [Footnote: Quoted by Hodgson, Letters\r\nfrom North Am., I., 81.] \"Calhoun,\" said William Wirt, in 1824,\r\n\"advised me the other day to study less and trust more to genius;\r\nand I believe the advice is sound. He has certainly practiced on his\r\nown precepts, and has become, justly, a distinguished man. It may do\r\nvery well in politics, where a proposition has only to be compared\r\nwith general principles with which the politician is familiar.\"\r\n[Footnote: Kennedy, William Wirt, II., 143; other views of Calhoun\r\nin MacDonald, Jacksonian Democracy, chaps, v., ix.; Hart, Slavery\r\nand Abolition, chap. xix.; Garrison, Westward Extension (Am. Nation,\r\nXV., XVI., XVII.).]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the campaign, Calhoun was the confidant and\r\nfriend of Adams, apparently considering the alternative of throwing\r\nhis influence in the latter's favor, if it proved impossible to\r\nrealize his own aspirations.\r\n\r\nFrom beyond the Alleghenies came two candidates who personified the\r\nforces of their section. We can see the very essence of the west in\r\nHenry Clay and Andrew Jackson. Clay was a Kentuckian, with the\r\ncharacteristics of his state; but, in a larger sense, he represented\r\nthe stream of migration which had occupied the Ohio Valley during\r\nthe preceding half-century. This society was one which, in its\r\ncomposition, embraced elements of the middle region as well as of\r\nthe south. It tended towards freedom, but had slaves in its midst,\r\nand had been accustomed, through experience, to adjust relations\r\nbetween slavery and free labor by a system of compromise.\r\nEconomically, it was in need of internal improvements and the\r\ndevelopment of manufactures to afford a home market. It had the\r\nideal of American expansion, and in earlier days vehemently demanded\r\nthe control of the Mississippi and the expulsion of the Spaniard\r\nfrom the coasts of the Gulf. In the War of 1812 it sent its sons to\r\ndestroy English influence about the Great Lakes and had been\r\nambitious to conquer Canada.\r\n\r\nIt is an evidence of the rapidity with which the west stamped itself\r\nupon its colonists, that although Clay was born, and bred to the\r\nlaw, in Virginia, he soon became the mouth-piece of these western\r\nforces. In his personality, also, he reflected many of the traits of\r\nthis region. Kentucky, ardent in its spirit, not ashamed of a strain\r\nof sporting blood, fond of the horse-race, partial to its whiskey,\r\nready to \"bluff\" in politics as in poker, but sensitive to honor,\r\nwas the true home of Henry Clay. To a Puritan like John Quincy\r\nAdams, Clay was, \"in politics, as in private life, essentially a\r\ngamester.\"[Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, V., 59.] But if the Puritan\r\nmind did not approve of Henry Clay, multitudes of his fellow-\r\ncountrymen in other sections did. There was a charm about him that\r\nfastened men to him. He was \"Harry of the West,\" an impetuous,\r\nwillful, high-spirited, daring, jealous, but, withal, a lovable man.\r\nHe had the qualities of leadership; was ambitious, impulsive, often\r\nguided by his intuitions and his sensibilities, but, at the same\r\ntime, an adroit and bold champion of constructive legislation. He\r\nknew, too, the time for compromise and for concession. Perhaps he\r\nknew it too well; for, although no statesman of this era possessed\r\nmore courageous initiative and constructive power, his tact and his\r\npowers of management were such that his place in history is quite as\r\nmuch that of the \"great compromiser\" as it is that of the author of\r\nthe \"American system.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that Clay made the speakership one of the\r\nimportant American institutions. He was the master of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, shaping its measures by the appointment of his\r\ncommittees and his parliamentary management.[Footnote: Follett,\r\nSpeaker of the House, pp. 41-46.] By the period of our survey, with\r\nthe power of this office behind him, Clay had fashioned a set of\r\nAmerican political issues reflective of western and middle-state\r\nideas, and had made himself a formidable rival in the presidential\r\nstruggle. He had caught the self-confidence, the continental\r\naspirations, the dash and impetuosity of the west. But he was also,\r\nas a writer of the time declared, \"able to captivate high and low,\r\nl'homme du salon and the 'squatter' in the Western wilderness.\" He\r\nwas a mediator between east and west, between north and south--the\r\n\"great conciliator.\" [Footnote: Grund, Aristocracy in America, II.,\r\n213. For other views of Clay, cf. Babcock, Am. Nationality, chap.\r\nxii.; MacDonald, Jacksonian Democracy, chap. xi.; Garrison, Westward\r\nExtension, chap. iii. (Am. Nation, XIII., XV., XVII.).]\r\n\r\nIf Henry Clay was one of the favorites of the west, Andrew Jackson\r\nwas the west itself. While Clay was able to voice, with statesman-\r\nlike ability, the demand for economic legislation to promote her\r\ninterests, and while he exercised an extraordinary fascination by\r\nhis personal magnetism and his eloquence, he never became the hero\r\nof the great masses of the west; he appealed rather to the more\r\nintelligent--to the men of business and of property. Andrew Jackson\r\nwas the very personification of the contentious, nationalistic\r\ndemocracy of the interior. He was born, in 1767, of Scotch-Irish\r\nparents, who had settled near the boundary-line between North and\r\nSouth Carolina, not far from the similar settlements from which,\r\nwithin a few years of Jackson's birth, Daniel Boone and Robertson\r\nwent forth to be the founders of Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1788,\r\nwith a caravan of emigrants, Jackson crossed the Alleghenies to\r\nNashville, Tennessee, then an outpost of settlement still exposed to\r\nthe incursions of Indians. During the first seven or eight years of\r\nhis residence he was public prosecutor--an office that called for\r\nnerve and decision, rather than legal acumen, in that turbulent\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this frontiersman on the floor of Congress was an\r\nomen full of significance. He reached Philadelphia at the close of\r\nWashington's administration, having ridden on horseback nearly eight\r\nhundred miles to his destination. Gallatin (himself a western\r\nPennsylvanian) afterwards graphically described Jackson, as he\r\nentered the halls of Congress, as \"a tall, lank, uncouth-looking\r\npersonage, with long locks of hair hanging over his face, and a cue\r\ndown his back tied in an eel-skin; his dress singular, his manners\r\nand deportment those of a rough backwoodsman.\"[Footnote: Hildreth,\r\nUnited States, iv., 692.] Jefferson afterwards testified to Webster:\r\n\"His passions are terrible. When I was President of the Senate, he\r\nwas a Senator, and he could never speak, on account of the rashness\r\nof his feelings. I have seen him attempt it repeatedly, and as often\r\nchoke with rage.\"[Footnote: Webster, Writings (National ed.), XVII.,\r\n371.] At length the frontier, in the person of its leader, had found\r\na place in the government. This six-foot backwoodsman, angular,\r\nlantern-jawed, and thin, with blue eyes that blazed on occasion;\r\nthis choleric, impetuous, Scotch-Irish leader of men; this expert\r\nduelist and ready fighter; this embodiment of the contentious,\r\nvehement, personal west, was in politics to stay.[Footnote: For\r\nother appreciations, see Babcock, Am. Nationality, chap, xvii.;\r\nMacDonald, Jacksonian Democracy, chaps, ii., xviii.(Am. Nation,\r\nXIII., XV.).] In the War of 1812, by the defeat of the Indians of\r\nthe Gulf plains, he made himself the conqueror of a new province for\r\nwestern settlement, and when he led his frontier riflemen to the\r\nvictory of New Orleans he became the national hero, the self-made\r\nman, the incarnation of the popular ideal of democracy. The very\r\nrashness and arbitrariness which his Seminole campaign displayed\r\nappealed to the west, for he went to his object with the relentless\r\ndirectness of a frontiersman. This episode gave to Adams the\r\nopportunity to write his masterly state paper defending the actions\r\nof the general. But Henry Clay, seeing, perhaps, in the rising star\r\nof the frontier military hero a baneful omen to his own career, and\r\nhoping to break the administration forces by holding the government\r\nresponsible for Jackson's actions, led an assault upon him in the\r\nSeminole debates on the floor of the House of\r\nRepresentatives.[Footnote: Babcock, Am. Nationality (Am. Nation,\r\nXIII.), chap. xvii.] Leaving Tennessee when he heard of the attack\r\nwhich was meditated against him, the general rushed (1819) to this\r\nnew field of battle, and had the satisfaction of winning what he\r\nregarded as \"the greatest victory he ever obtained\"--a triumph on\r\nevery count of Clay's indictment. This contest Jackson considered\r\n\"the Touchstone of the election of the next president.\"[Footnote: N.\r\nY. Publ. Library, Bulletin, IV., 160, 161; Parton, Jackson, II.,\r\nchap. xl.] From this time the personality of the \"Old Hero\" was as\r\nweighty a factor in\r\n\r\nAmerican politics as the tariff or internal improvements. He had now\r\noutgrown the uncouthness of his earlier days and had become stately\r\nand dignified in his manner. Around this unique personality there\r\nbegan to gather all those democratic forces which we have noted as\r\ncharacteristic of the interior of the country, reinforced by the\r\ndemocracy of the cities, growing into self-consciousness and power.\r\nA new force was coming into American life. This fiery Tennesseean\r\nwas becoming the political idol of a popular movement which swept\r\nacross all sections, with but slight regard to their separate\r\neconomic interests. The rude, strong, turbulent democracy of the\r\nwest and of the country found in him its natural leader.\r\n\r\nAll these candidates and the dominant element in every section\r\nprofessed the doctrines of republicanism; but what were the orthodox\r\ntenets of republicanism at the end of the rule of the Virginia\r\ndynasty? To this question different candidates and different\r\nsections gave conflicting answers. Out of their differences there\r\nwas already the beginning of a new division of parties.\r\n\r\nThe progress of events gave ample opportunity for collision between\r\nthe various factions. The crisis of 1819 and the depression of the\r\nsucceeding years worked, on the whole, in the interests of Jackson,\r\ninclining the common people to demand a leader and a new\r\ndispensation. Not, perhaps, without a malicious joy did John Quincy\r\nAdams write in his diary at that time that \"Crawford has labors and\r\nperils enough before him in the management of the finances for the\r\nthree succeeding years.\"[Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, IV., 391.] From\r\nthe negotiation of the Florida treaty in 1819, and especially from\r\nthe relinquishment by Spain of her claims to the Pacific coast north\r\nof the forty-second parallel, the secretary of state expected to\r\nreap a harvest of political advantage.[Footnote: Ibid., IV., 238,\r\n273, 451, V., 53, 109, 290; Monroe, Writings, VI., 127.] But Clay,\r\nas well as Benton and the west in general, balked his hopes by\r\ndenouncing the treaty as an abandonment of American rights; and,\r\nalthough Adams won friends in the south by the acquisition of\r\nFlorida, Spain's delay of two years in the ratification of the\r\ntreaty so far neutralized the credit that the treaty was, after all,\r\nbut a feast of Tantalus. In these intervening years, when the United\r\nStates was several times on the verge of forcibly occupying Florida,\r\nthe possibility of a war with Spain, into which European powers\r\nmight be drawn, increased the importance of General Jackson as a\r\nfigure in the eyes of the public.\r\n\r\nNext the Missouri controversy, like \"a flaming sword,\" [Footnote:\r\nAdams, Memoirs, V., 91.]cut in every direction and affected the\r\nfuture of all the presidential candidates. The hope of Crawford to\r\nreap the reward of his renunciation in 1816 was based, not only upon\r\nhis moderation in his earlier career, which had brought him friends\r\namong the Federalists, but also upon the prospect of attracting a\r\nfollowing in Pennsylvania, with the aid of the influence of\r\nGallatin, and in New York as the regular candidate of the party.\r\nThese hopes of northern support demanded that Crawford should trim\r\nhis sails with care, attacking the policies of his rivals rather\r\nthan framing issues of his own. But for a time the Missouri\r\ncontroversy alienated both Pennsylvania and New York from the south,\r\nand it brought about a bitterness of feeling fatal to his success in\r\nthose two states. To Clay, too, the slavery struggle brought\r\nembarrassments, for his attitude as a compromiser failed to\r\nstrengthen him in the south, while it diminished his following in\r\nthe north. Calhoun suffered from the same difficulty, although his\r\nposition in the cabinet enabled him to keep in the background in\r\nthis heated contest. Jackson stood in a different situation. At the\r\ntime he was remote from the controversy, having his own troubles as\r\ngovernor of Florida, and, as a slave-holding planter he was not\r\nsuspected by the south, while at the same time his popularity as the\r\nrepresentative of the new democracy was steadily winning him friends\r\nin the antislavery state of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nTo Adams all the agitation was a distinct gain, since it broke the\r\nconcert between Virginia and New York and increased his chances as\r\nthe only important northern candidate. He saw--none more clearly--\r\nthe possibility of this issue as a basis for a new party\r\norganization,[Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, IV., 529.] but he saw also\r\nthat it menaced a dissolution of the Union.[Footnote: Ibid., V., 12,\r\n13, 53.] He was not disposed to alienate the south, and he contented\r\nhimself with confiding his denunciation of slavery to the secret\r\npages of his diary, while publicly he took his stand on the doctrine\r\nthat the proposed restriction upon Missouri was against the\r\nConstitution.[Footnote: Ibid., IV., 529.] As early as 1821 he\r\nrecognized that the number of candidates in the field made it almost\r\ncertain that the election would be decided by the vote of states in\r\nthe House of Representatives, where the vote of the single member\r\nfrom Illinois would count as much as that of the whole delegation of\r\nNew York or Pennsylvania. What Adams needed, therefore, was to\r\ncombine New England in his support, obtain, if possible, a majority\r\nin New York, and add the votes of a sufficient number of smaller\r\nstates to win the election.\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth Congress, which met in December, 1821, and lasted\r\nuntil the spring of 1823, was one of the most ineffective\r\nlegislative bodies in the country's history. Henry Clay had returned\r\nto Kentucky to resume the practice of the law as a means of\r\nrestoring his financial fortunes, and the importance of his\r\nleadership was emphasized by his absence. Without mastery, and in\r\nthe absence of party discipline, Congress degenerated into a. mere\r\narena for the conflicts of rival personal factions, each anxious to\r\ndestroy the reputation of the candidate favored by the other.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1821, Barbour, of Virginia, was chosen speaker, by a\r\nclose vote, over Taylor, the favorite of Adams, thus transferring\r\nthe control of the congressional committees again to the south,\r\naided by its New York allies. The advantage to Crawford arising from\r\nthis election was partly neutralized by the fact that in this year\r\nhis partisans in Georgia were defeated by the choice of his\r\nbitterest enemy for the governorship. It may have been this\r\ncircumstance which aroused the hope of Crawford's southern rivals\r\nand led to the calling of a legislative caucus in South Carolina,\r\nwhich, on December 18, 1821, by a close vote, nominated William\r\nLowndes instead of Calhoun for the presidency. Many of Calhoun's\r\npartisans refused to attend this caucus, and the vote was a close\r\none (57 to 53). [Footnote: Ravenel, William Lowndes, chap, x.;\r\nAdams, Memoirs, V., 468, 470; National Intelligencer, January 19,\r\n1822.] Lowndes was a wealthy South Carolina planter, judicious and\r\ndispassionate, with a reputation for fair-mindedness and wisdom that\r\ngained him the respect of his foes as well as his friends. According\r\nto tradition, Clay once declared that among the many men he had\r\nknown he found it difficult to decide who was the greatest, but\r\nadded, \"I think the wisest man I ever knew was William\r\nLowndes.\"[Footnote: Ravenel, William Lowndes, 238.] His death, in\r\nless than a year, removed from the presidential contest an important\r\nfigure, and from the south one of the most gifted of her sons.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news of the nomination of Lowndes reached Washington,\r\na delegation of members of Congress, from various sections, secured\r\nCalhoun's consent to avow his candidacy. His career as a tariff man\r\nand as a friend of internal improvements had won him northern\r\nsupporters, especially in Pennsylvania, although, as South\r\nCarolina's action showed, he was not able to control his state. The\r\nannouncement of Calhoun's candidacy turned against him all the\r\nbatteries of his rivals. Pleading the depleted condition of the\r\ntreasury, Crawford's partisans in Congress attacked the measures of\r\nCalhoun as secretary of war. Retrenchment in the expenditures for\r\nthe army was demanded, and finally, under the leadership of\r\nCrawford's friends, the Senate refused to ratify certain nominations\r\nof military officers made by the president on the recommendation of\r\nthe secretary of war, giving as a reason that they were not in\r\naccordance with the law for the reduction of the army. In the\r\ncabinet discussion, Crawford openly supported this opposition, and\r\nhis relations with the president became so strained that, in the\r\nspring of 1822, reports were rife that his resignation would be\r\ndemanded. [Footnote: Cf. Adams, Memoirs, V., 525.] Crawford himself\r\nwrote to Gallatin that it would not be to his disadvantage to be\r\nremoved from office. [Footnote: Gallatin, Writings, 31., 241.]\r\n\r\nIn the summer the matter was brought to a head by a correspondence\r\nin which Monroe indignantly intimated that Crawford had given\r\ncountenance to the allegation that the president's principles and\r\npolicy were not in sympathy with the early Jeffersonian system of\r\neconomy and state rights. Believing that Crawford was aiming at the\r\ncreation of a new party (a thing which distressed Monroe, who\r\nregarded parties as an evil),[Footnote: Monroe, Writings, VI., 286-\r\n291.] he made it clear that it was the duty of a cabinet officer,\r\nwhen once the policy of the executive had been determined, to give\r\nthat policy co-operation and support.[Footnote: Monroe to Crawford,\r\nAugust 22, 1822, MS. in N.Y. Pub. Library.] In his reply Crawford\r\ndenied that he had personally antagonized the measures of the\r\nadministration; [Footnote: Crawford to Monroe, September 3, 1822,\r\nMS. in N.Y. Pub. Library; cf. Adams, Memoirs, VI., 390.] but he took\r\nthe ground that a cabinet officer should not attempt to influence\r\nhis friends in Congress either for or against the policy of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nHis assurances of loyalty satisfied Monroe and averted the breach.\r\nIt is easy to see, however, that Crawford's attitude strengthened\r\nthe feeling on the part of his rivals that he was intriguing against\r\nthe administration. They believed, whether he instigated his\r\npartisans to oppose measures favored by the president or was unable\r\nto restrain them, in either case he should be forced into open\r\nopposition. [Footnote: Cf. Poinsett to Monroe, May 10, 1822, Monroe\r\nMSS., in Library of Cong.; Adams, Memoirs, V., 315, VI., 57.] The\r\ntruth is that the government was so divided within itself that it\r\nwas difficult to determine with certainty what its policy was.\r\nMonroe's greatest weakness was revealed at this time in his\r\ninability to create and insist upon a definite policy. The situation\r\nwas aggravated by the president's determination to remain neutral\r\nbetween the rival members of his official family, and by the loss of\r\ninfluence which he suffered through the knowledge that he was soon\r\nto lay down the presidential power.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, John Quincy Adams watched these intrigues with bitterness\r\nof soul. Debarred by his Puritan principles from the open\r\nsolicitation of votes which his rivals practiced, he yet knew every\r\nmove in the game and gauged the political tendencies with the\r\nastuteness of the politician, albeit a Puritan politician. Nor did\r\nhe disdain to make such use of his position as would win friends or\r\nremove enemies. He proposed to Calhoun a foreign mission, suggested\r\nthe same to Clay, favored an ambassadorship for Clinton, and urged\r\nthe appointment of Jackson to Mexico. These overtures were politely\r\ndeclined by the candidates, and Adams was forced to fight for the\r\npresidency against the men whom he would so gladly have sent to\r\nhonor their country abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE MONROE DOCTRINE (1821-1823)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe place of slavery in the westward expansion of the nation was not\r\nthe only burning question which the American people had to face in\r\nthe presidency of Monroe. Within a few years after that contest, the\r\nproblem of the independence of the New World and of the destiny of\r\nthe United States in the sisterhood of new American republics\r\nconfronted the administration. Should the political rivalries and\r\nwars of Europe to acquire territory be excluded from the western\r\nhemisphere? Should the acquisition of new colonies by European\r\nstates in the vast unsettled spaces of the two Americas be\r\nterminated? These weighty questions were put to the mild Virginian\r\nstatesman; history has named his answer the Monroe Doctrine.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of our national existence, the United States had\r\nbeen pushing back Europe from her borders, and asserting neutrality\r\nand the right to remain outside of the political System of the Old\r\nWorld. Washington's farewell address of 1796, with its appeal to his\r\nfellow-citizens against \"interweaving our destiny with that of any\r\npart of Europe,\" sank deep into the popular consciousness. It did\r\nnot interfere with the process by which, piece by piece, the United\r\nStates added to its domains fragments from the disintegrating\r\nSpanish empire; for so long as European states held the strategic\r\npositions on our flanks, as they did in Washington's day, the policy\r\nof separation from the nations of the Old World was one difficult to\r\nmaintain; and France and England watched the enlargement of the\r\nUnited States with jealous eye. Each nation, in turn, considered the\r\nplans of Miranda, a Venezuelan revolutionist, for the freeing of\r\nSpanish America. In 1790 the Nootka Sound affair threatened to place\r\nEngland in possession of the whole Mississippi valley and to give\r\nher the leadership in Spanish America. [Footnote: Turner, in Am.\r\nHist. Rev., VII., 704, VIII., 78; Manning, Nootka Sound Controversy,\r\nin Am. Hist. Assoc., Report, 1904, p. 281; cf. Bassett, Federalist\r\nSystem (Am. Nation, XI), chap. vi.] Two years later, France urged\r\nEngland to join her in freeing the colonies of Spain in the New\r\nWorld;[Footnote: Sorel, L'Europe et la Revolution Francaise, II.,\r\n384, 418, III., 17.] and when Pitt rejected these overtures, France\r\nsent Genet to spread the fires of her revolution in Louisiana and\r\nFlorida.[Footnote: Turner, in Am. Hist. Rev., III., 650, X. 259.]\r\nWhen this design failed, France turned to diplomacy, and between\r\n1795 and 1800 tried to persuade Spain to relinquish Florida and\r\nLouisiana to herself, as a means of checking the expansion of the\r\nUnited States and of rendering her subservient to France. The\r\ngrowing preponderance of France over Spain, and the fear that she\r\nwould secure control of Spanish America, led England again in 1798\r\nto listen to Miranda's dream of freeing his countrymen, and to sound\r\nthe United States on a plan for joint action against Spain in the\r\nNew World. [Footnote: Turner, in Am. Hist. Rev., X., 249 et seq.,\r\n276.] The elder Adams turned a deaf ear to these suggestions, and\r\nwhen at last Napoleon achieved the possession of Louisiana, it was\r\nonly to turn it over to the United States. [Footnote: Sloane, in Am.\r\nHist. Rev., IV., 439.] Jefferson's threat that the possession of\r\nLouisiana by France would seal the union between England and the\r\nUnited States and \"make the first cannon which shall be fired in\r\nEurope the signal for the tearing up of any settlement she may have\r\nmade, and for holding the two continents of America in sequestration\r\nfor the common purposes of the united British and American nations,\"\r\n[Footnote: Jefferson, Writings (Ford's ed.), VIII., 145.] showed how\r\nunstable must be the American policy of isolation so long as Europe\r\nhad a lodgment on our borders. [Footnote: Cf. Channing, Jeffersonian\r\nSystem (Am. Nation, XII.), chap. v.]\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of Louisiana by the United States was followed by\r\nthe annexation of West Florida; and the Seminole campaign frightened\r\nSpain into the abandonment of East Florida. [Footnote: Babcock,\r\nAmerican Nationality (Am. Nation, XIII.), chap. xvii.] While the\r\nUnited States was thus crowding Europe back from its borders and\r\nstrengthening its leadership in the New World, Spanish America was\r\nrevolting from the mother-country. When Napoleon made himself master\r\nof Spain in 1807, English merchants, alarmed at the prospect of\r\nlosing the lucrative trade which they had built up in the lands\r\nwhich Spain had so long monopolized, supported the revolutionists\r\nwith money, while various expeditions led by English officers aided\r\nthe revolt. [Footnote: Paxson, Independence of the So. Am.\r\nRepublics, chap, iii.; Am. Hist. Rev., IV., 449, VI., 508.] At\r\nfirst, failure met the efforts of the loosely compacted provinces,\r\nmade up of sharply marked social classes, separated by race\r\nantagonisms, and untrained in self-government. Only in Buenos Ayres\r\n(later the Argentine Confederation), where representatives of the\r\nUnited Provinces of the Rio de la Plata declared their independence\r\nin 1816, were the colonists able to hold their ground.\r\n\r\nA new era in the revolt began, however, in 1817, when General San\r\nMartin surprised the Spaniards by his march, from a frontier\r\nprovince of La Plata, over a pass thirteen thousand feet above the\r\nsea across the Andes to Chili. In the course of four years, with the\r\nco-operation of Lord Cochrane (who relinquished the British service\r\nin order to command the fleet of the insurgents on the Pacific), he\r\neffected the liberation of Chili and of Peru. Meanwhile, in the\r\nnorthern provinces the other great South American revolutionist,\r\nBolivar, aided by a legion of Irish and English veterans, won the\r\nindependence of Venezuela and Colombia. In July, 1822, these two\r\nsuccessful generals met in Ecuador; and San Martin, yielding the\r\nleadership to the more ambitious Bolivar, withdrew from the New\r\nWorld. By this date, America was clearly lost to the Latin states of\r\nEurope, for Mexico became an independent empire in 1821, and the\r\nnext year Brazil, while it chose for its ruler a prince of the\r\nyounger line of the royal house of Portugal, proclaimed its\r\nindependence.[Footnote: Paxson, Independence of the So. Am.\r\nRepublics, chap. i.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the relations between these revolutionary states and\r\nEngland, both on the military and on the commercial side, were much\r\ncloser than with the United States, this nation followed the course\r\nof events with keen interest. Agents were sent, in 1817 and 1820, to\r\nvarious South American states, to report upon the conditions there;\r\nand the vessels of the revolutionary governments were accorded\r\nbelligerent rights, and admitted to the ports of the United\r\nStates.[Footnote: Ibid., 121; Am. State Papers, Foreign, IV., 217,\r\n818.] The occupation of Amelia Island and Galveston, in 1817, by\r\nrevolutionists, claiming the protection of the flags of Colombia and\r\nMexico respectively, gave opportunity for piratical forays upon\r\ncommerce, which the United States was unable to tolerate, and these\r\nestablishments were broken up by the government.[Footnote: McMaster,\r\nUnited States, IV., chap. xxxiv.; Reeves, in Johns Hopkins Univ.\r\nStudies, XXIII., Nos. 9, 10.]\r\n\r\nPresident Monroe seems to have been inclined to recognize the\r\nindependence of these states on the earliest evidence of their\r\nability to sustain it; but the secretary of state, John Quincy\r\nAdams, favored a policy of delay. He had slight confidence in the\r\nturbulent, untrained republics of Latin-America, and little patience\r\nwith the idea that their revolution had anything in common with that\r\nof the United States. At the close of 1817 he believed it\r\ninexpedient and unjust for the United States to favor their cause,\r\nand he urged a friend to publish inquiries into the political\r\nmorality and the right of the United States to take sides with a\r\npeople who trampled upon civil rights, disgraced their revolution by\r\nbuccaneering and piracy, and who lacked both unity of cause and of\r\neffort. [Footnote: Letter to A. H. Everett, in Am. Hist. Rev., XI.,\r\n112.] His own system was based on the theory that the United States.\r\nshould move in harmony with England, and, if possible, with the\r\nother European powers in the matter of recognition; [Footnote:\r\nPaxson, Independence of the So. Am. Republics, 149 (citing MSS. in\r\nState Dept.)] and he perceived that Spain would be more likely to\r\nyield Florida to the United States if the president did not\r\nacknowledge the independence of her other provinces.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay now came forward as the advocate of immediate recognition\r\nof the revolutionary republics. In this he was undoubtedly swayed by\r\na real sympathy with the cause of freedom and by the natural\r\ninstincts of a man of the west, where antagonism to Spain was bred\r\nin the bone. But his insistence upon immediate action was also\r\nstimulated by his opposition to Monroe and the secretary of state.\r\nClay's great speech on recognition was made May 24 and 25, 1818. His\r\nimagination kindled at the vastness of South America: \"The loftiest\r\nmountains; the most majestic rivers in the world; the richest mines\r\nof the precious metals; and the choicest productions of the earth.\"\r\n\"We behold there,\" said he, \"a spectacle still more interesting and\r\nsublime--the glorious spectacle of eighteen millions of people\r\nstruggling to burst their chains and be free.\" He appealed to\r\nCongress to support an American system by recognizing these sister\r\nrepublics, and argued that, both in diplomacy and in commerce they\r\nwould be guided by an American policy and aid the United States to\r\nfree itself from dependence on Europe. His motion was lost by an\r\noverwhelming majority, but the speech made a deep impression.\r\n[Footnote: Annals of Cong., 15 Cong., 1 Sess., II., 1474.]\r\n\r\nIn the two years which elapsed between the negotiation and the\r\nratification of the Florida treaty, the president was several times\r\non the point of recommending the forcible occupation of Florida, but\r\nhe withheld the blow, hoping that the liberal Spanish government\r\nestablished under the constitution of 1820 might be brought to give\r\nits consent to the cession. The impetuous Clay chafed under this\r\ndelay, and on May 10, 1820, he broke forth in another speech, in\r\nsupport of a resolution declaring the expediency of sending\r\nministers to the South American states. Charging the administration,\r\nand especially John Quincy Adams, with subserviency to Great\r\nBritain, he demanded that the United States should become the center\r\nof a system against the despotism of the Old World and should act on\r\nits own responsibility. \"We look too much abroad,\" said he. \"Let us\r\nbreak these commercial and political fetters; let us no longer watch\r\nthe nod of any European politician; let us become real and true\r\nAmericans, and place ourselves at the head of the American system.\"\r\n[Footnote: Annals of Cong., 16 Cong., 1 Sess., II., 2727.]\r\n\r\nClay was steadily gaining support in his efforts to force the hands\r\nof the administration: his resolutions won by a fair majority, and\r\nagain, in February, 1821, he secured the almost unanimous assent of\r\nthe House to a resolution of sympathy with South America. Another\r\nresolution, expressing the readiness of that body to support the\r\npresident whenever he should think it expedient to recognize the\r\nrepublics, passed by a vote of 86 to 68, and the triumphant Clay was\r\nplaced at the head of a committee to wait on the president with this\r\nresolution.[Footnote: Ibid., 2229, and 2 Sess., 1081, 1091; Adams,\r\nMemoirs, V., 268]\r\n\r\nAlthough the victory was without immediate effect on the\r\nadministration, which refused to act while the Florida treaty was\r\nstill unratified, Adams perceived that the popular current was\r\ngrowing too strong to be much longer stemmed; the charge of\r\ndependence upon England was one not easy to be borne, and Clay's\r\nvision of an independent American system guided by the United States\r\nhad its influence on his mind. Five months after Clay's speech, in\r\n1820, extolling such a system, Adams set forth similar general ideas\r\nin a discussion between himself and the British minister over the\r\nregulation, of the slave-trade. [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, V., 182]\r\nBy 1822, Florida was in our possession. The success of the arms of\r\nthe revolutionists was unmistakable; several governments, of\r\nsufficient stability to warrant recognition had been erected; and it\r\nwas patent to the world that Spain had lost her colonies. Acting on\r\nthese considerations, Monroe sent a message to Congress, March 8,\r\n1822, announcing that the time for recognition had come, and asking\r\nfor appropriations for ministers to South America. [Footnote:\r\nRichardson, Messages and Papers, II., 116]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the secretary of state was confronted with\r\nimportant diplomatic questions which, complicated the South American\r\nproblem. As Spanish America broke away from the mother-country, its\r\npossessions in North America on the Pacific were exposed to seizure\r\nby the rival powers. In 1821, when Stratford Canning, the British\r\nminister to the United States, protested against a motion, in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, that the United States should form an\r\nestablishment on the Columbia, Adams challenged any claim of England\r\nto the shores of the Pacific. \"I do not know,\" said he, \"what you\r\nclaim nor what you do not claim. You claim India; you claim Africa;\r\nyou claim--\" \"Perhaps,\" said Canning, \"a piece of the moon.\" \"No,\"\r\nsaid Adams, \"I have not heard that you claim exclusively any part of\r\nthe moon; but there is not a spot on THIS habitable globe that I\r\ncould affirm you do not claim; and there is none which you may not\r\nclaim with as much color of right as you can have to Columbia River\r\nor its mouth.\" [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, V., 252.]\r\n\r\nThe time had arrived when Adams's familiarity with foreign\r\ndiplomacy, his belief that a new nation must assert its rights with\r\nvigor if it expected to maintain them, his very testiness and\r\nirascibility, his \"bull-dog fighting qualities\"--in short, the\r\ncharacteristics that were sources of weakness to him in domestic\r\npolitics--proved to be elements of strength in his conduct of\r\nforeign relations. The individualism, the uncompromising nature, the\r\naggressiveness, and the natural love of expansion, which were traits\r\nof John Quincy Adams, became of highest service to his country in\r\nthe diplomatic relations of the next few years.\r\n\r\nHardly a year elapsed after this defiance to England when Adams met\r\nthe claims of Russia likewise with a similar challenge. On September\r\n4, 1821, the Russian czar issued a ukase announcing the claim of\r\nRussia on the Pacific coast north of the fifty-first degree, and\r\ninterdicting to the commercial vessels of other powers the approach\r\non the high seas within one hundred Italian miles of this claim.\r\n[Footnote: U. S. Foreign Relations (1890), 439.] This assertion of\r\nRussian monopoly, which would, in effect, have closed Bering Sea,\r\nmet with peremptory refusal by Adams, and on July 17, 1823, having\r\nin mind Russia's posts in California, he informed the minister,\r\nBaron Tuyl, \"that we should contest the right of Russia to any\r\nterritorial establishment on this continent, and that we should\r\nassume distinctly the principle that the American continents are no\r\nlonger subjects for any new European colonial establishments.\"\r\n[Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 163.] After negotiations, Russia\r\nconcluded the treaty of April 17, 1824, by which she agreed to form\r\nno establishments on the northwest coast south of latitude 54\r\ndegrees 40', and the United States reciprocally agreed to make no\r\nestablishments north of that line. At the same time Russia abandoned\r\nher extreme claim of maritime jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nWhile the Russian claims were under consideration, the question of\r\nthe future of Cuba was also giving great concern. The Pearl of the\r\nAntilles remained in the possession of Spain when she lost her main-\r\nland colonies. By its position, commanding both the Gulf of Mexico\r\nand the Caribbean Sea, it was of the highest importance to the\r\nUnited States as well as to the West Indian powers, England and\r\nFrance. From a party in Cuba itself, in September, 1822, advances\r\nwere made to the United States for annexation, and Monroe sent an\r\nagent to investigate, meanwhile refraining from encouraging the\r\nmovement. [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 69, 72.]\r\n\r\nGeorge Canning, who became premier of England in September, 1822,\r\nwas convinced that no questions relating to continental Europe could\r\nbe more immediately and vitally important to Great Britain than\r\nthose which related to America. [Footnote: Stapleton, Official\r\nCorresp. of George Canning, I., 48.] Alarmed lest the United States\r\nshould occupy Cuba, Canning, in a memorandum to the cabinet in\r\nNovember, questioned whether any blow that could be struck by any\r\nforeign power in any part of the world would more affect the\r\ninterests of England. [Footnote: Ibid., 52; Royal Hist. Soc.,\r\nTransactions (new series), XVIII., 89] He contented himself,\r\nhowever, with sending a naval force to the waters of Cuba and Puerto\r\nRico, with the double purpose of checking American aggressions and\r\nprotecting English commerce. This action created suspicion on the\r\npart of the United States, and Adams issued instructions (April 28,\r\n1823) to the American minister at Madrid, declaring that, within a\r\nhalf-century, the annexation of Cuba to the United States would be\r\nindispensable to the continuance and integrity of the Union itself.\r\nThe laws of political gravitation would, in his opinion, ultimately\r\nbring Cuba to this country, if, in the mean time, it were not\r\nacquired by some other power. Adams's immediate policy, therefore,\r\nfavored the retention of Cuba and Puerto Rico by Spain, but he\r\nrefused to commit the United States to a guarantee of the\r\nindependence of Cuba against all the world except that power.\r\n[Footnote: Wharton, Digest of Am. Int. Law, I., 361-366; Latane,\r\nDiplomatic Relations with Lat. Am., chap. iii.]\r\n\r\nThe mutual jealousies of the nations with respect to the destiny of\r\nCuba became, at this time, entangled with the greater question of\r\nthe intervention of the Holy Alliance in the New World. At the\r\nCongress of Verona, in November, 1822, Austria, France, Russia, and\r\nPrussia signed a revision of the treaty of the Holy Alliance,\r\n[Footnote: Snow, Treaties and Topics; Seignobos, Pol. Hist. of\r\nEurope since 1814, 762.] which had for its objects the promotion of\r\nthe doctrine of legitimacy in support of the divine right of rulers,\r\nand the doctrine of intervention, for the purpose of restoring to\r\ntheir thrones those monarchs who had been deposed by popular\r\nuprisings, and of rehabilitating those who had been limited by\r\nwritten constitutions. At Verona, the allies agreed to use their\r\nefforts to put an end to the system of representative government in\r\nEurope, and to prevent its further introduction. Having already\r\nsuppressed uprisings in Naples and Piedmont, the Alliance empowered\r\nFrance to send troops into the Spanish peninsula to restore the\r\nauthority of the king of Spain and to put down the revolutionary\r\nconstitution of 1820. Chateaubriand, the French representative,\r\ndesired the congress to go further and intervene in Spanish America,\r\nbut this question was postponed.\r\n\r\nAlarmed by the prospect of French power in Spain and by the proposed\r\nextension of the system of the allies to the New World, Canning\r\nprotested against the doctrine of intervention, and determined that,\r\nif France was to become the mistress of Spain, she should at least\r\nnot control the old Spanish empire. In the spring of 1823 he made an\r\nunsuccessful effort to secure a pledge from France not to acquire\r\nany Spanish-American possessions, either by conquest or by cession\r\nfrom Spain. But the French government maintained its reserve, even\r\nafter England disclaimed for herself the intention of acquiring\r\nSpanish-American territory. [Footnote: Stapleton, Political Life of\r\nCanning, I., 19.]\r\n\r\nHaving broken with the concert of the European powers, it was\r\nnatural that England should turn to the United States, and it is\r\nvery likely that the next step of Canning was influenced by the\r\ndispatches of the British minister to the United States, who\r\nreported a conversation with Adams, in June, 1823, in which the\r\nsecretary strongly set forth his belief that, in view of the virtual\r\ndissolution of the European alliance, England and the United States\r\nhad much in common in their policy. \"With respect to the vast\r\ncontinent of the West,\" said he, \"the United States must necessarily\r\ntake a warm and decided interest in whatever determined the fate or\r\naffected the welfare of its component members.\" But he disclaimed\r\nany wish on the part of this country to obtain exclusive advantages\r\nthere. He urged that England ought to recognize the independence of\r\nthe revolted provinces, and he deprecated the conquest or cession of\r\nany part of them. [Footnote: Stratford Canning to George Canning,\r\nJune 6, 1823, MSS. Foreign Office, America, CLXXVI; Adams, Memoirs,\r\nVI., 151; cf. Reddaway, Monroe Doctrine, 83.]\r\n\r\nThe first impression of the British minister, on hearing Adams's\r\nemphasis on the community of interests between the two nations, was\r\nthat the secretary was suggesting an alliance; and it may well have\r\nbeen that Canning was encouraged by the American attitude to make\r\novertures to Rush, the American minister, shortly after these\r\ndispatches must have reached him. On August 16, 1823, and three\r\ntimes thereafter, Canning proposed a joint declaration by England\r\nand the United States against any project by a European power of \"a\r\nforcible enterprise for reducing the colonies to subjugation, on the\r\nbehalf or in the name of Spain; or which meditates the acquisition\r\nof any part of them to itself, by cession or by conquest.\"\r\n[Footnote: Stapleton, Political Life of Canning, II., 24; W. C.\r\nFord, in Mass. Hist. Soc. Proceedings (2d series), XV., 415.]\r\nCanning was willing to make public announcement that the recovery of\r\nthe colonies by Spain was hopeless; that the matter of recognition\r\nwas only a question of time; and that Great Britain did not aim at\r\nthe possession of any portion of them, but that it \"could not see\r\nany part of them transferred to any other power with indifference.\"\r\nThese professions Canning desired that the United States and England\r\nshould mutually confide to each other and declare \"in the face of\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\nConfronted with Canning's important proposition, Rush, who doubted\r\nthe disinterestedness of England, prudently attempted to exact a\r\npreliminary recognition of the Spanish-American republics; if\r\nCanning would agree to take this action, he would accept the\r\nresponsibility of engaging in such a declaration. [Footnote: Ford,\r\nin Mass. Hist. Soc. Proceedings (2d series), XV., 420, 423.] Having\r\nfailed in four successive efforts to persuade Rush to join in an\r\nimmediate declaration, irrespective of prior recognition by England,\r\nCanning proceeded alone, and, in an interview with Polignac, the\r\nFrench minister in London, on October 9, 1823, he announced\r\nsubstantially the principles which he had expressed to the American\r\nminister. [Footnote: Stapleton, Political Life of Canning, II., 26.]\r\nPolignac thereupon disclaimed for France any intention to\r\nappropriate Spanish possessions in America, and abjured any design,\r\non the part of his country, of acting against the colonies by force;\r\nbut he significantly added that the future relations between Spain\r\nand her colonies ought to form a subject of discussion between the\r\nEuropean powers. Acting on this idea, and in opposition to England's\r\nwishes, an invitation was sent to Russia, Prussia, and Austria to\r\nconfer at Paris on the relations of Spain and her revolted\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nRush's despatches relating the overtures of Canning reached\r\nPresident Monroe [Footnote: Ford, in Am. Hist. Rev., VII., 684.]\r\nOctober 9, 1823, on the same day that Canning was interviewing\r\nPolignac. Adams was absent from Washington at the time, and Monroe,\r\nreturning to Virginia, consulted ex-Presidents Jefferson and\r\nMadison. He clearly intimated his own belief that the present case\r\nmight be an exception to the general maxim against entanglement in\r\nEuropean politics, and was evidently willing to accept the proposal\r\nof the British government. [Footnote: Monroe, Writings, VI., 323.]\r\n\r\nTo Jefferson [Footnote: Ibid., VI., 394.] the question seemed the\r\nmost momentous since the Declaration of Independence. One nation,\r\nmost of all, he thought, could disturb America in its efforts to\r\nhave an independent system, and that nation, England, now offered\r\n\"to lead, aid, and accompany us in it.\" He believed that by acceding\r\nto her proposition her mighty weight would be brought into the scale\r\nof free government, and \"emancipate a continent at one stroke.\"\r\nConstruing the English proposition to be a maintenance of our own\r\nprinciple of \"keeping out of our land all foreign-powers,\" he was\r\nready to accept Canning's invitation. He was even ready to yield his\r\ndesire for the annexation or independence of Cuba, in order to\r\nobtain England's co-operation. Madison, [Footnote: Madison, Writings\r\n(ed. of 1865), III., 339-341.] also, was prepared to accept the\r\nEnglish proposal, and to invite that government to join in\r\ndisapproval of the campaign of France in Spain and in a declaration\r\nin behalf of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThus, by a strange operation of fate, members of the \"Virginia\r\ndynasty,\" the traditional antagonists of England, were now willing\r\nto accept her leadership in American affairs, and were inclined to\r\nmingle in European concerns in opposition to the Holy Alliance. By\r\nan equally strange chance, it was a statesman from New England, the\r\nsection traditionally friendly to British leadership, who prevented\r\nthe United States from casting itself into the arms of England at\r\nthis crisis, and who summoned his country to stand forth\r\nindependently as the protector of an American system.\r\n\r\nWhen John Quincy Adams learned of Canning's proposals, he had just\r\nbeen engaged in a discussion with the representative of the czar,\r\nwho informed him of the refusal of Russia to recognize the Spanish-\r\nAmerican republics, and expressed the hope that America would\r\ncontinue her policy of neutrality.\r\n\r\nWhile the cabinet had Rush's dispatches under consideration, Adams\r\nreceived a second communication from the Russian minister,\r\nexpounding the reactionary ideas of the Holy Alliance. [Footnote:\r\nFord, in Mass. Hist. Soc. Proceedings (2d series), XV., 378, 395,\r\n402-408.] To the secretary of state this was a challenge to defend\r\nthe American ideas of liberty. Convinces that his Country ought to\r\ndecline the overture of Great Britain and avow its principles\r\nexplicitly to Russia and France, \"rather than to come in as a cock-\r\nboat in the wake of the British man-of-war,\" Adams informed the\r\npresident that the reply to Russia and the instructions to Rush in\r\nEngland must be part of a combined system of policy. \"The ground\r\nthat I wish to take,\" he said, \"is that of earnest remonstrance\r\nagainst the interference of European powers by force with South\r\nAmerica, but to disclaim all interference on our part with Europe;\r\nto make an American cause and adhere inflexibly to that.\" [Footnote:\r\nAdams, Memoirs, VI., 178, 194, 197, 199-212.]\r\n\r\nIn the cabinet he stood firmly against giving guarantees to England\r\nwith respect to Cuba. He heartened up his colleagues, who were\r\nalarmed at the possibility of the spread of war to the United\r\nStates; but at the same time that he dismissed this danger as remote\r\nhe pictured to the cabinet the alarming alternatives in case the\r\nallies subjugated Spanish America: California, Peru, and Chili might\r\nfall to Russia; Cuba, to England; and Mexico, to France. The danger\r\nwas even at our doors, he declared, for within a few days the\r\nminister of France had openly threatened to recover Louisiana.\r\n[Footnote: Ibid., VI., 207; cf. Reeves, in Johns Hopkins Univ.\r\nStudies, XXIII, Nos. 9, 10.] Such suggestions exhibit the real\r\nsignificance of the problem, which in truth involved the question of\r\nwhether America should lie open to seizure by rival European\r\nnations, each fearful lest the other gain an undue advantage. It was\r\ntime for the United States to take its stand against intervention in\r\nthis hemisphere.\r\n\r\nMonroe was persuaded by Adams to change the first draught of his\r\nmessage, in which the president criticized the invasion of Spain by\r\nFrance and recommended the acknowledgment of the independence of the\r\nGreeks, in terms which seemed to threaten war with Europe on\r\nEuropean questions. Even Webster and Clay, in fervent orations,\r\nshowed themselves ready to go far towards committing the United\r\nStates to an unwise support of the cause of the Greeks, which at\r\nthis time was deeply stirring the sympathy of the United States. On\r\nthe other hand, Adams stood firmly on the well-established doctrine\r\nof isolation from Europe, and of an independent utterance, by the\r\nUnited States, as the leader in the New World, of the principles of\r\na purely American system. In the final draught, these ideas were all\r\naccepted, as well as the principles affirmed by Adams in his\r\nconferences with the Russian minister.\r\n\r\nWhen sent to Congress, on December 2, 1823, Monroe's message\r\nasserted \"as a principle in which the rights and interests of the\r\nUnited States are involved, that the American continents, by the\r\nfree and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain,\r\nare henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future\r\ncolonization by any European powers.\" This was in effect the\r\nproclamation of the end of a process that began with Columbus,\r\nCabot, and Cartier--the rivalry of the nations of the Old World in\r\nthe discovery, occupation, and political control of the wild lands\r\nof the western hemisphere. The interpretation by the next\r\nadministration left the enforcement of this general principle to the\r\nvarious American states according to their interests. [Footnote: See\r\nchap. xvi. below]\r\n\r\nThe message further dealt with the determination of the United\r\nStates not to meddle with European affairs. \"It is only when our\r\nrights are invaded or seriously menaced,\" said Monroe, \"that we\r\nresent injuries or make preparation for our defense. With the\r\nmovements in this hemisphere we are of necessity more immediately\r\nconnected, and by causes which must be obvious to all enlightened\r\nand impartial observers. The political system of the allied powers\r\nis essentially different in this respect from that of America.\" This\r\ndeclaration expressed the consciousness that there was a real\r\nAmerican system contrasted with that of Europe and capable of\r\nseparate existence.\r\n\r\nFinally, the message met the immediate crisis by a bold assertion of\r\nthe policy of the United States: \"We owe it, therefore, to candor\r\nand to the amicable relations existing between the United States and\r\nthose powers to declare that we should consider any attempt on their\r\npart to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as\r\ndangerous to our peace and safety. With the existing colonies or\r\ndependencies of any European power we have not interfered and shall\r\nnot interfere. But with the Governments who have declared their\r\nindependence and maintained it, and whose independence we have, on\r\ngreat consideration and on just principles, acknowledged, we could\r\nnot view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or\r\ncontrolling in any other manner their destiny, by any European power\r\nin any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly\r\ndisposition toward the United States.\" [Footnote: Richardson,\r\nMessages and Papers, II., 207-218; cf. Hart, Foundations of Am.\r\nForeign Policy, chap. vii.] Herein was the assertion of the well-\r\nestablished opposition of the United States to the doctrine of\r\nintervention as violating the equality of nations. It was the\r\naffirmation also of the equality of the Old and the New World in\r\ndiplomatic relations, and the announcement of the paramount interest\r\nof the United States in American affairs. [Footnote: Moore, \"Non-\r\nIntervention and the Monroe Doctrine,\" in Harper's Mag., CIX., 857.]\r\n\r\nThis classic statement of the position of the United States in the\r\nNew World, therefore, applied an old tendency on the part of this\r\ncountry to a particular exigency. Its authorship can hardly be\r\nattributed to any single individual, but its peculiar significance\r\nat this juncture lay in the fact that the United States came\r\nforward, unconnected with Europe, as the champion of the autonomy\r\nand freedom of America, and declared that the era of European\r\ncolonization in the New World had passed away. The idea of an\r\nAmerican system, under the leadership of the United States,\r\nunhampered by dependence upon European diplomacy, had been\r\neloquently and clearly voiced by Henry Clay in 1820. But John Quincy\r\nAdams also reached the conception of an independent American system,\r\nand to him belongs the credit for the doctrine that the two Americas\r\nwere closed to future political colonization. His office of\r\nsecretary of state placed him where he was able to insist upon a\r\nconsistent, clear-cut, and independent expression of the doctrine of\r\nan American system. Monroe's was the honor of taking the\r\nresponsibility for these utterances. [Footnote: Cf. Reddaway, Monroe\r\nDoctrine, chap, v.; and Ford, in Am. Hist. Rev., VII., 676, VIII.,\r\n28.]\r\n\r\nCanning afterwards boasted, \"I called the New World into existence\r\nto redress the balance of the Old.\" [Footnote: Stapleton, Political\r\nLife of Canning, III., 227.] Unquestionably his determination that\r\n\"if France had Spain it should not be Spain with the Indies,\"\r\nmaterially contributed to make effective the protest of the United\r\nStates, and he recognized the value of the president's message in\r\nputting an end to the proposal of a European congress. \"It was\r\nbroken,\" said he, \"in all its limbs before, but the president's\r\nmessage gives it the coup de grace.\" [Footnote: Stapleton, George\r\nCanning and His Times, 395.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the assertion by the United States of an American\r\nsystem independent of Europe, and the proposed exclusion of Europe\r\nfrom further colonization were, in truth, as obnoxious to England as\r\nthey were to France. [Footnote: Reddaway, Monroe Doctrine, 98.] \"The\r\ngreat danger of the time,\" declared Canning in 1825, shortly after\r\nthe British recognition of Mexico, \"--a danger which the policy of\r\nthe European system would have fostered--was a division of the world\r\ninto European and American, republican and monarchical; a league of\r\nworn-out governments on the one hand and of youthful and stirring\r\nnations, with the United States at their head, on the other. WE slip\r\nin between, and plant ourselves in Mexico. The United States have\r\ngotten the start of us in vain, and we link once more America to\r\nEurope.\" On December 17, 1824, Canning wrote: \"Spanish America is\r\nfree; and if we do not mismanage our matters sadly, she is English,\r\nand novus saeclorum nascitur ordo.\" [Footnote: Festing, J.H. Frere\r\nand His Friends, 267, quoted by E.M. Lloyd, in Royal Hist. Soc.\r\nTransactions (new series), XVIII., 77, 93.]\r\n\r\nLater events were to reveal how unsubstantial were the hopes of the\r\nBritish minister. For the present, his hands were tied by the fact\r\nthat England and the United States had a common interest in\r\nsafeguarding Spanish America; and the form of Monroe's declaration\r\nseemed less important than its effectiveness in promoting this\r\nresult. In the United States the message was received with\r\napprobation. Although Clay, from considerations of policy, withdrew\r\na resolution which he presented to Congress (January 20,1824),\r\ngiving legislative endorsement to the doctrine, [Footnote: Annals of\r\nCong., 18 Cong., 1 Sess., I., 1104, II., 2763.] there was no doubt\r\nof the sympathy of the American people with its fundamental\r\nprinciples. Together with the attitude of England, it put an end to\r\nthe menace of the Holy Alliance on this side of the ocean, and it\r\nbegan a new chapter, yet unfinished, in the history of the\r\npredominance of the United States in the New World.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nINTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS (1818-1824)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transformation by which the slender line of the Indian trail\r\nbecame the trader's trace, and then a road, superseded by the\r\nturnpike and canal, and again replaced by the railroad, is typical\r\nof the economic development of the United States. As the population\r\nof the west increased, its surplus products sought outlets. Improved\r\nmeans of communication became essential, and when these were\r\nfurnished the new lines of internal trade knitted the nation into\r\norganic unity and replaced the former colonial dependence upon\r\nEurope, in the matter of commerce, by an extensive domestic trade\r\nbetween the various sections. From these changes flowed important\r\npolitical results. [Footnote: For the earlier phase of internal\r\nimprovements, cf. Babcock, Am. Nationality (Am. Nation, XIII.),\r\nchap. xv.]\r\n\r\nMany natural obstacles checked this process. The Appalachian\r\nmountain system cut off the seaboard of the United States from the\r\ninterior. From the beginning, the Alleghenies profoundly influenced\r\nthe course of American history, and at one time even endangered the\r\npermanency of the Union. In our own day the railroad has so reduced\r\nthe importance of these mountains that it is difficult for us to\r\nrealize the part which they once played in our development. Although\r\nWebster boasted that there were no Alleghenies in his politics, we\r\nhave already seen [Footnote: See chaps, iii., vi., above.] that in\r\nthe twenties they exercised a dominant influence on the lines of\r\ninternal commerce, and compelled the pioneer farmers to ship their\r\nsurplus down the Mississippi to New Orleans and around the coast,\r\nand thence abroad and to the cities of the north. The difficult and\r\nexpensive process of wagoning goods from Philadelphia and Baltimore\r\nacross the mountains to the Ohio Valley raised the price of\r\nmanufactured goods to the western farmer; while, on the other hand,\r\nthe cost of transportation for his crops left him little profit and\r\nreduced the value of his lands. [Footnote: Journ. of Polit. Econ.,\r\nVIII., 36-41.]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, it was inevitable that the natural\r\nopportunities furnished by the water system of the Great Lakes and\r\nthe widely ramifying tributaries of the Mississippi should appeal to\r\nstatesmen who considered the short distances that intervened between\r\nthese navigable waters and the rivers that sought the Atlantic.\r\nTurnpikes and canals had already shown themselves practicable and\r\nprofitable in England, so a natural effort arose to use them in aid\r\nof that movement for connecting east and west by ties of interest\r\nwhich Washington had so much at heart. New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, and Virginia, all subdivided by the mountains into eastern\r\nand western sections, fostered roads and chartered turnpike and\r\ncanal companies. Pennsylvania was pre-eminent in this movement even\r\nbefore the close of the eighteenth century, subscribing large\r\namounts to the stock of turnpike companies in order to promote the\r\ntrade between Philadelphia and the growing population in the region\r\nof Pittsburgh. So numerous were the projects and beginnings of roads\r\nand canals in the nation, that as early as 1808 the far-sighted\r\nGallatin made his famous report for a complete national system of\r\nroads and canals. [Footnote: Cf. Hart, Slavery and Abolition (Am.\r\nNation, XVI.), chap. iii.]\r\n\r\nWhen New York undertook the Erie Canal in 1817 as a state\r\nenterprise, and pushed it to such a triumphant conclusion that\r\nbefore a decade after its completion its tolls repaid the cost of\r\nconstruction, a revolution was effected in transportation. The\r\ncheapness of water carriage not only compelled the freighters on the\r\nturnpike roads to lower their charges, but also soon made it\r\nprobable that canals would supersede land transportation for heavy\r\nfreights, and even for passengers. For a time the power of\r\nPittsburgh and the activity of Philadelphia merchants sustained the\r\nimportance of the Pennsylvania turnpike. Until Great Lake steam\r\nnavigation developed and population spread along the shore of Lake\r\nErie and canals joined the Ohio and the lakes, the Erie Canal did\r\nnot reap its harvest of trade in the west. But already Pennsylvania\r\nwas alarmed at the prospect of losing her commercial ascendancy.\r\nWhile New York and Philadelphia were developing canals and turnpikes\r\nto reach the west, Baltimore was placed in an awkward position. The\r\nattempts to improve the waters of the upper Potomac engaged the\r\ninterests of Maryland and Virginia from the days of Washington. But\r\nthe success of the Potomac Company, chartered jointly by these two\r\nstates in an effort to reach the Ohio trade, would have turned\r\ntraffic towards the city of Washington and its outlying suburbs\r\ninstead of towards Baltimore, which was already connected by a\r\nturnpike with the Cumberland Road, so as to share with Philadelphia\r\nin the wagon trade to the Ohio. On the other hand, Baltimore was\r\ninterested in the development of the Susquehanna's navigation, for\r\nthis river had its outlet in Chesapeake Bay, near enough to\r\nBaltimore to make that city its entrepot; and it tapped the great\r\nvalley of Pennsylvania as well as the growing agricultural area of\r\nsouth-central New York, which was not tributary to the Erie Canal.\r\nBut it was not possible to expect New York, Pennsylvania, or even\r\nthat part of Maryland interested in the Potomac to aid these\r\nambitions of Baltimore; and that city found itself at a disadvantage\r\nand Maryland's interests were divided. [Footnote: Hulbert, Historic\r\nHighways, XIII., 69 et seq.; Mills, Treatise on Inland Navig.; see\r\nchap, xvii., below.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, Virginia, anxious to check the western exodus from the\r\ninterior of her state, established a state fund and a board of\r\npublic works for the improvement of her rivers, including the\r\nproject of connecting the James and Kanawha. [Footnote: Babcock, Am.\r\nNationality (Am. Nation, XIII.), chap. xv.; Adams, United States,\r\nIX., 164.] North Carolina was agitating similar plans; [Footnote:\r\nMurphy, Memorial on Internal Improvements; Weaver, Internal\r\nImprovements in N. C., in Johns Hopkins Univ. Studies, XXI, 113.]\r\nand South Carolina made appropriations for extensive improvements.\r\n\r\nNew England devoted her attention to canals along the seaboard and\r\nup the Connecticut Valley, to give the products of the interior of\r\nthat section an outlet on the coast. Boston was feeling the\r\nisolation from the western trade that was enriching New York, and\r\nsome voices were raised in favor of a canal to reach the Hudson; but\r\nthe undertaking was too difficult, and the metropolis of New England\r\ndevoted its energies to the ocean commerce.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the west was urging the federal government to construct\r\nthose interstate roads and canals which were essential to the\r\nprosperity of that section and which could not be undertaken by\r\njealous and conflicting states. The veto by Madison of Calhoun's\r\nbonus bill, in 1817, [Footnote: Cf. Babcock, Am. Nationality (Am.\r\nNation, XIII.), chap. xvii.] was followed nine months later by\r\nMonroe's first annual message, [Footnote: Richardson, Messages and\r\nPapers, II., 18.] in which he stated his belief that the\r\nConstitution did not empower Congress to establish a system of\r\ninternal improvements, and recommended an amendment to convey the\r\npower. To Clay and the friends of internal improvements, these\r\nconstitutional scruples of the Virginia dynasty, although\r\naccompanied by approval of the plan of a system of internal\r\nimprovements at federal expense, came as a challenge. In an\r\nimportant debate on the constitutionality of national internal\r\nimprovements, in 1818, the House of Representatives, voting on four\r\nresolutions submitted by Lowndes, of South Carolina, [Footnote:\r\nAnnals of Cong., 15 Cong., 1 Sess., I., 1249] declared that Congress\r\nhad power to appropriate money for the construction of military\r\nroads, and of other roads, and of canals, and for the improvement of\r\nwatercourses (89 ayes to 75 nays). [Footnote: By count of names; the\r\nJournal gives ayes 90.] But after a debate which turned on the\r\nsignificance of the word \"establish\" in the Constitution, the House\r\ndecided against the power to construct post-roads and military roads\r\n(81 to 84); against the power to construct roads and canals\r\nnecessary to commerce between the states (71 to 95); and against the\r\npower to construct canals for military purposes (81 to 83).\r\n\r\nIt was clear after this debate that there was not a sufficient\r\nmajority to override the veto which might be expected from the\r\npresident. On the other hand, the majority were unwilling to hazard\r\nthe rights which they claimed to possess, by appealing to the states\r\nfor a constitutional amendment. The next year Calhoun, the secretary\r\nof war, responding to an invitation of Congress, submitted a report\r\noutlining a comprehensive system of internal improvements requisite\r\nfor the defense of the United States. While avoiding an opinion on\r\nthe question of constitutionality, he declared that a judicious\r\nsystem of roads and canals, constructed for commerce and the mail,\r\nwould be \"itself among the most efficient means for the more\r\ncomplete defense of the United States\"; [Footnote: Am. State Papers,\r\nMiscellaneous, 534.] and he favored the use of the engineering corps\r\nfor surveying the routes and of federal troops for the actual work\r\nof construction.\r\n\r\nBy 1818 the National Road [Footnote: Cf. Babcock, Am. Nationality\r\n(Am. Nation, XIII.), chap. xv.; Young, Cumberland Road, 15; Hulbert,\r\nHistoric Highways, X., chap. i.] had been constructed from\r\nCumberland, on the Potomac, across the mountains to Wheeling, on the\r\nOhio, and two years later Congress made appropriations for a survey\r\nof the road westward to the Mississippi River. The panic of 1819,\r\nhowever, left the treasury in such a condition that it was not until\r\n1822 that the preservation and construction of this highway was\r\nagain taken up with vigor. In that year a bill was introduced\r\nauthorizing the president to cause toll-houses, gates, and turnpikes\r\nto be erected on the Cumberland Road, and to appoint toll-gatherers,\r\nwith power to enforce the collection of tolls to be used for the\r\npreservation of the road. The bill further provided for a system of\r\nfines for violation of the laws of the road. It therefore involved\r\nthe question of the right of jurisdiction as well as of\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe measure passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 87 to\r\n68. The districts along the line of the Potomac and the Ohio, and\r\nthe regions tributary to the road in Pennsylvania and western\r\nVirginia, were almost a unit in favor of the bill. Indeed, the whole\r\nvote of the western states, with the exception of two members from\r\nTennessee, was given in the affirmative. But Pittsburgh, which\r\nfeared the diversion of her western trade to Baltimore, opposed the\r\nbill. The area along the Susquehanna which looked to Baltimore also\r\nvoted in the negative, as did the majority of the delegation from\r\nNew York, who were apprehensive of the effect of the National Road\r\nas a rival to the Erie Canal. The Senate passed the bill by the\r\ndecisive vote of 29 to 7.\r\n\r\nMonroe vetoed this measure, on the ground that it implied a power to\r\nexecute a complete system of internal improvements, with the right\r\nof jurisdiction and sovereignty. Accompanying his veto (May 4,\r\n1822), he submitted \"Views on the Subject of Internal Improvements.\"\r\n[Footnote: Richardson, Messages and Papers, II., 142-183; Monroe,\r\nWritings, VI., 216; Mason, Veto Power, 85; Nelson presidential\r\nInfluence on Int. Imp. (Iowa Journal of Hist, and Politics), IV.,\r\n29, 30.] In this elaborate disquisition, he rehearsed the\r\nconstitutional history of internal improvements, and expounded his\r\nconception of the construction of the Constitution, and of the\r\nrelation of the states and the nation under the theory of divided\r\nsovereignty. Although he denied to the federal government the right\r\nof jurisdiction and construction, he asserted that Congress had\r\nunlimited power to raise money, and that \"in its appropriation, they\r\nhave a discretionary power, restricted only by their duty to\r\nappropriate it to purposes of common defense and of general, not\r\nlocal, national, not state, benefit.\" Nevertheless, he strongly\r\nrecommended a system of internal improvements, if it could be\r\nestablished by means of a constitutional amendment. Both houses\r\nsustained the president's veto.\r\n\r\nActing upon Monroe's intimation of the power to appropriate money,\r\nand following the line of least resistance, the next year an act was\r\npassed making appropriations for repairs of the Cumberland Road. On\r\nMarch 3, 1823, also, was signed the first of the national acts for\r\nthe improvement of harbors. [Footnote: U. S. Statutes at Large,\r\nIII., 780.] The irresistible demand for better internal\r\ncommunications and the development of a multitude of local projects,\r\nchief among them a new plan for uniting Chesapeake Bay with the Ohio\r\nby a canal along the Potomac, resulted, in 1824, in the introduction\r\nof the general survey bill, authorizing the president to cause\r\nsurveys to be made for such roads and canals as he deemed of\r\nnational importance for commercial, military, or postal purposes.\r\nThe evident intention of the bill was to prepare a programme for\r\nappropriations for internal improvements on a national scale, and\r\nfor subscription to the stock of companies engaged in these\r\nenterprises. The discussion of the general survey bill brought out\r\nthe significance of the problem of transportation, and revealed the\r\nsectional divisions of the nation in clear light.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay made an earnest effort to commit Congress to the exercise\r\nof the power of construction of interstate highways and canals which\r\ncould not be undertaken by individual states or by combinations of\r\nstates, and which, if built at all, must be by the nation. He\r\nrecounted the attention given by Congress to the construction of\r\npublic buildings and light-houses, coast surveys, erection of sea-\r\nwalls in the Atlantic states--\"everything on the margin of the\r\nocean, but nothing for domestic trade; nothing for the great\r\ninterior of the country.\" [Footnote: Annals of Cong., 18 Cong., 1\r\nSess., I., 1035.] \"Not one stone,\" he said, \"had yet been broken,\r\nnot one spade of earth removed, in any Western State.\" He boldly\r\nclaimed that the right to regulate commerce granted as fully the\r\npower to construct roads and canals for the benefit of circulation\r\nand trade in the interior as it did the power to promote coastwise\r\ntraffic. His speech was a strong assertion of the right of the west\r\nto equality of treatment with the old sections of the country. \"A\r\nnew world,\" said he, \"has come into being since the Constitution was\r\nadopted. Are the narrow, limited necessities of the old thirteen\r\nstates, of, indeed, parts only of the old thirteen states, as they\r\nexisted at the formation of the present Constitution, forever to\r\nremain the rule of its interpretation?\" [Footnote: Annals of Cong.,\r\n18 Cong., 1 Sess., I., 1315; Colton, Private Corresp. of Clay, 81.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the united attitude of the west upon internal\r\nimprovements, which Henry Clay voiced with such lofty accent, the\r\nsouth showed divisions which reflected opposing economic interests\r\nin the section. Not only were the representatives of Maryland almost\r\na unit in support of the bill, but also the western districts of\r\nVirginia and North Carolina, as well as a considerable fraction of\r\nthe representatives from South Carolina and Georgia, supported the\r\ncause of the west on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe opposition in the south found, perhaps, its most inflexible\r\nexpression in the speech of John Randolph, [Footnote: Annals of\r\nCong., 18 Cong., 1 Sess., I., 1296-1311.] who, with characteristic\r\nrecklessness and irresponsibility, dragged from its closet the\r\nfamily skeleton of the south, and warned his fellow slaveholders\r\nthat, if Congress possessed power to do what was proposed by the\r\nbill, they might emancipate every slave in the United States, \"and\r\nwith stronger color of reason than they can exercise the power now\r\ncontended for.\" He closed by threatening the formation of\r\nassociations and \"every other means short of actual insurrection.\"\r\n\"We shall keep on the windward side of treason,\" said he. [Footnote:\r\nCf. Macon's identical views in 1818 and 1824, Univ. of North\r\nCarolina, James Sprunt Hist. Monographs, No. 2, pp. 47, 72.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, McDuffie, of South Carolina, the friend and\r\nprotege of Calhoun and a later leader of the nullification forces,\r\nsupported the measure and spoke as earnestly in favor of a liberal\r\nconstruction of the Constitution as any of the most enthusiastic\r\nsupporters of the bill. He declared that the constitutional\r\nconvention \"did not regard the state governments as sentinels upon\r\nthe watch-towers of freedom, or in any respect more worthy of\r\nconfidence than the general government.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the bill came to the final vote in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, New England gave 12 votes in favor and 26 against;\r\nthe middle states, 37 to 26 (New York, 7 to 24); the south, 23 to\r\n34; the west, 43 to 0. Thus the bill carried by 115 to 86. As the\r\nmap shows, the opposition was chiefly located in New England and New\r\nYork and in a fragment of the old south. The entire west, including\r\nthe southwestern slave states, with Pennsylvania and the Potomac\r\nValley, acted together. In the Senate, the vote stood 24 to 18. Here\r\nNew England gave an almost solid vote against the bill.\r\n\r\nThus by the close of Monroe's administration the forces of\r\nnationalism seemed to have triumphed in the important field of\r\ninternal improvements. It was the line of least resistance then, as\r\nit had been in the days of the Annapolis Convention. [Footnote:\r\nMcLaughlin, Confederation and Constitution (Am. Nation, X.), chap,\r\nxi.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE TARIFF OF 1824 (1820-1824)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has been shown in the last chapter, the attitude of portions of\r\nthe south towards strict construction was not inveterate upon\r\nmeasures which promised advantages to that section. But the tariff\r\nstruggle revealed the spirit which arose when powers were asserted\r\nunfavorable to any section. The failure of the tariff bill of 1820\r\n[Footnote: See above, chap. ix.] was followed by other unsuccessful\r\nattempts to induce a majority of Congress to revive the subject. The\r\nmessages of Monroe favored a moderate increase of duties; but it was\r\nnot until 1824, after the return of Henry Clay and his triumphant\r\nelection to the speakership, that Congress showed a protectionist\r\nmajority ably disciplined and led. [Footnote: For previous tariff\r\nhistory, cf. Babcock, Am. Nationality (Am. Nation, XIII.), chap.\r\nxiv.]\r\n\r\nThe tariff bill of 1824 was supported, not as a revenue, but as a\r\nprotective measure. It proposed an increase of the duty upon iron,\r\nhemp, cotton bagging, woolens, and cottons. Upon woolen goods, the\r\nfriends of protection desired to apply the minimum principle which\r\nthe tariff of 1816 had provided for cotton goods. But the cheap\r\nwoolens were mostly used for the clothing of southern slaves, and\r\nthe proposition for an increase of duty met with so strenuous a\r\nresistance that in the outcome the cheap foreign goods bore a lower\r\nrate of duty than did the high-priced products. Although the act\r\nsomewhat increased the protection upon woolen fabrics as a whole,\r\nthis was more than offset by the increased duty which was levied\r\nupon raw wool in response to the demand of the wool-raising\r\ninterests of the country. [Footnote: Taussig, Tariff Hist., 75.]\r\n\r\nAnother struggle occurred over the protection of hemp. This product\r\nwas used both for the manufacture of the ropes essential to New\r\nEngland shipping and for the cotton bagging used in the south. Thus\r\nthe shipping and the slave-holding sections were brought into union\r\nin opposition to the provision. Nevertheless, this important\r\nKentucky interest received a substantial protection. The attempt to\r\nsecure a marked increase of the duty on iron bars resulted in a\r\ncompromise proposition which satisfied neither party and had little\r\neffect upon domestic manufacture, while it increased the cost to the\r\nconsumer. The Senate amendments reduced the proposed rates on the\r\nmost important articles, so that, on the whole, the extreme\r\nprotectionists failed to carry their programme, although the bill\r\nincreased the duties upon the articles most essential to the\r\nshipping and planting sections sufficiently to leave great\r\ndiscontent. [Footnote: Stanwood, Amer. Tariff Controversies, I.,\r\nchap. vii.]\r\n\r\nIn the debates upon this tariff, Henry Clay led the protectionist\r\nforces, basing his arguments upon the general distress of the\r\ncountry, which he explained by the loss of the foreign market for\r\nagricultural products, and which he would remedy by building up a\r\nhome market by means of the support of manufactures--the creation of\r\nan \"American system.\" \"We must naturalize the arts in our country,\"\r\nsaid he. Not the least significant portion of his plea for\r\nprotection was that in which he called attention to the great\r\ndiversity of interests--\"agricultural, planting, farming,\r\ncommercial, navigating, fishing, manufacturing\"--within the United\r\nStates. Some of these interests were, as he said, peculiar to\r\nparticular sections. \"The inquiry should be in reference to the\r\ngreat interests of every section of the Union (I speak not of minute\r\nsubdivisions); what would be done for those interests if that\r\nsection stood alone and separated from the residue of the Republic?\r\nIf they come into absolute collision with the interests of another\r\nsection, a reconciliation, if possible, should be attempted, by\r\nmutual concession, so as to avoid a sacrifice of the prosperity of\r\neither to that of the other.\" [Footnote: Annals of Cong., 18 Cong.,\r\n1 Sess., II., 1997; cf. Clay's letter to Brooke, August 28, 1823,\r\nClay, Private Corresp., 81.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the ablest speech on the other side was that of Webster,\r\n[Footnote: Webster, Writings (National ed.), V., 94-149.] who\r\nridiculed Clay's discovery. \"This favorite American policy,\" said\r\nhe, \"is what America has never tried, and this odious foreign policy\r\nis what, as we are told, foreign states have never pursued.\" He\r\ndenied the existence of general depression, although he admitted\r\nthat profits were lower and prices considerably depressed. Webster's\r\nargument included an analysis of the theory of protection as against\r\nfree-trade, in which he made a classical statement of the opposition\r\nto protection. In short, he represented the attitude of the\r\ncommercial classes, particularly those of New England, whose\r\ninterests were injured by any restraint of the freedom of exchange.\r\nAs yet these classes exercised a dominant influence in\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nSenator Hayne, of South Carolina, also argued the case against the\r\ntariff with a grasp and power of presentation that was hardly second\r\nto that of Webster. In particular he protested against compelling\r\nthe planting regions to pay the cost of a protective system. Two-\r\nthirds of the whole amount of the domestic exports of the United\r\nStates, he argued, were composed of cotton, rice, and tobacco, and\r\nfrom this trade arose the imports of manufactured goods which paid\r\nthe revenues of the United States, and which the protective system\r\nrendered expensive and burdensome to his section. He warned the\r\nmanufacturers that the south would repeal the system at the first\r\nopportunity, regardless of interests that might accrue under the\r\nproposed measure. [Footnote: Annals of Cong., 18 Cong., 1 Sess., I.,\r\n618.]\r\n\r\nIn the speeches of some of the representatives of the south was a\r\nnote of revolt not to be found in Webster's argument. For the first\r\ntime in the discussion of the tariff, the constitutional objection\r\nwas made prominent. It was argued that the power to impose taxes and\r\nduties was given for the purpose of raising revenue, not for the\r\npurpose of protection. If not the letter, at least the spirit, of\r\nthe Constitution was violated, so it was charged, by this distortion\r\nof the power of taxation. The proceedings of the constitutional\r\nconvention were recited to show that a proposition conferring the\r\nalleged power was voted down. To this, Clay gave the reply that the\r\nclause on which the protectionists relied was the power to regulate\r\ncommerce with foreign nations.\r\n\r\nEven the south, however, laid less stress upon the constitutional\r\nargument than upon the injustice to the section. McDuffie, for\r\nexample, replying to Clay, [Footnote: Ibid., II., 2400 et seq.]\r\nargued that no one of the great sections of the country, if it were\r\na separate nation, could advantageously apply the system of\r\nprotection. He warned the western states that the system would make\r\nthem tributary to the Atlantic states, [Footnote: Ibid., II., 2423.]\r\nand that they had more to lose by alienating the friendship of the\r\nsouth for a system of internal improvements which should facilitate\r\nthe sale of their meat products to the south than by a union with\r\nthe manufacturing interests. With respect to the south itself, he\r\ndeclared that cotton, which alone constituted one-third of the whole\r\nexport of the Union, was in danger of losing the market of England\r\nif we ceased to take the manufactures of that country. Protesting\r\nthat the protective system would strike at the root of their\r\nprosperity, by enhancing the cost of the clothing of their slaves\r\nand the bagging used to cover their cotton-bales, while at the same\r\ntime it put to hazard the sale of their great staple in the English\r\nmarket, he yet declared that, if the bill should pass, \"even with a\r\nmajority of a single vote, I shall, as bound by my allegiance,\r\nsubmit to it as one of the laws of my country.\"\r\n\r\nBut if this South Carolina leader represented the attitude of his\r\nstate in showing moderation at this time, [Footnote: See Ames, State\r\nDocs, on Federal Relations, No. 4, p. 6.] not so did the free-lance\r\nJohn Randolph, of Virginia. \"I do not stop here, sir,\" said he, \"to\r\nargue about the constitutionality of this bill; I consider the\r\nConstitution a dead letter; I consider it to consist, at this time,\r\nof the power of the General Government and the power of the States--\r\nthat is the Constitution.\" \"I have no faith in parchment, sir; ... I\r\nhave faith in the power of the commonwealth of which I am an\r\nunworthy son.\" \"If, under a power to regulate trade, you prevent\r\nexportation; if, with the most approved spring lancets, you draw the\r\nlast drop of blood from our veins; if, secundum artem, you draw the\r\nlast shilling from our pockets, what are the checks of the\r\nConstitution to us? A fig for the Constitution! When the scorpion's\r\nsting is probing to the quick, shall we stop to chop logic? ...\r\nThere is no magic in this word union.\" While he threatened forcible\r\nresistance, he rejoiced in the combination of the shipping and\r\ncommercial classes of New England with the south in opposition to\r\nthe measure. \"The merchants and manufacturers of Massachusetts, New\r\nHampshire, the province of Maine and Sagadahock,\" said he, \"repel\r\nthis bill, whilst men in hunting-shirts, with deer-skin leggings and\r\nmoccasins on their feet, want protection for manufactures.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill passed the House of Representatives on April 16, 1824, by\r\nthe close vote of 107 to 102, and subsequently passed the Senate by\r\na small majority:\r\n\r\n          New England          Middle Region          South\r\n          M N V M  R C T         N N P  D T         M V  N S  G T\r\n          e H t a  I o o         Y J a  e o         d a  C C  a o\r\n                s    n t                l t                     t\r\n                s    n a                  a                     a\r\n                       l                  l                     l\r\n\r\nAyes . . .1 1 5 1  2 5 15       26 6 24 1 57        3 1  0  0 0 4\r\nNays . . .6 5 0 11 0 1 23        8 0  1 0  9        6 21 13 9 7 56\r\n\r\n          Northwest and Kentucky         Southwest\r\n          O  I I M K  T                  T A M L T\r\n          h  n l o y  o                  e l i a o\r\n          i  d        t                  n a s   t     Total\r\n          o           a                  n   s   a\r\n                      l                          l\r\n\r\nAyes . . .14 2 1 1 11 29                 2 0 0 0 2      107\r\nNays . . . 0 0 0 0  0 0                  7 3 1 3 14     102\r\n\r\nBy this analysis and the map, it is clear that the navigating states\r\nwere in opposition, while the manufacturing states were generally in\r\nfavor of the bill. The most important textile manufacturers of\r\nMassachusetts, however, were not advocates of protection at this\r\ntime. The grain and wool producing states gave an overwhelming vote\r\n(91 to 9) in favor of the attempt to provide a home market. The\r\nplanting states gave but 3 votes in favor to 64 against. [Footnote:\r\nSee the analysis in Niles' Register, XXVI., 113.] By comparison with\r\nthe map of the general survey bill, it is seen that the southern\r\nhalf of the west was in a state of unstable equilibrium on these\r\nsectional issues. It joined the Ohio Valley and the middle states in\r\nsupporting a system of internal improvements, while it transferred\r\nits support to the old south on the question of the tariff. New\r\nEngland, on the other hand, although divided, tended to unite its\r\nstrength with that of the south on both these measures. In general,\r\nthe map reveals the process of forming a northern section in\r\nopposition to the south--the union of the Ohio Valley with the\r\nmiddle states against the alliance of the south Atlantic seaboard\r\nwith the Gulf states. The division of forces exhibited in the\r\nMissouri struggle was strikingly like the division now revealed on\r\nthe tariff question.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the tariff of 1824 was distinctly a compromise\r\nmeasure. Although the ad valorem duties on cotton and woolen goods\r\nwere raised, this was balanced by the doubled duty on raw wool.\r\nNevertheless, it aroused the opposition of the entire planting\r\nsection, at the same time that the manufacturers of woolen goods\r\nfelt that their interests had been sacrificed. The tariff question\r\nwas, in fact, only postponed. In the history of party development,\r\nhowever, Clay's system of internal improvements and tariff, as shown\r\nin this session of Congress, had a significance not easily missed;\r\nand state sovereignty sentiment in the south grew steadily after\r\nthese measures.

Antes,\r\nState Docs, on Federal Relations, No. 4, pp. 4-13.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTION OF 1824 (1822-1825)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, [Footnote: See above, chap. x.] the dissensions in\r\nMonroe's cabinet approached the point of rupture by the spring and\r\nsummer of 1822, when the spectacle was presented of the friends of\r\nthe secretary of the treasury making war upon the measures of the\r\nsecretary of war, and even antagonizing the president himself.\r\nCrawford's followers gained the name of the \"radicals,\" and declared\r\nas their principles, democracy, economy, and reform. [Footnote:\r\nAdams, Memoirs, VI., 56; Mass. Hist. Soc., Proceedings, XIX., 40.]\r\nProfessing to represent the pure Jeffersonian republicanism of the\r\n\"Revolution of 1800,\" they appealed to the adherents of the Virginia\r\nschool of politics for support. [Footnote: Edwards, Illinois, 489.]\r\nJefferson, although refusing to come out openly, was clearly in\r\nsympathy with Crawford's candidacy: he believed that the old parties\r\nstill continued, although under different names, and that the issue\r\nwould finally be reduced to a contest between a northern and a\r\nsouthern candidate.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said he, in a letter to Gallatin, \"many calling\r\nthemselves Republicans and preaching the rankest doctrine of the old\r\nFederalists. One of the prominent candidates [Adams] is presumed to\r\nbe of this party; the other [Crawford] a Republican of the old\r\nschool, and a friend to the barrier of state rights, as provided by\r\nthe Constitution against the danger of consolidation.\" [Footnote:\r\nJefferson, Writings (Ford's ed.), X., 235; cf. 225-227, 237, 261,\r\n264, 280.] Pennsylvania and New York, he thought, would decide the\r\nquestion, and the issue would depend upon whether or not the\r\n\"Missouri principle\" became involved.\r\n\r\nAt this time parties and principles were still plastic. This is\r\nillustrated by a letter written in the spring of 1823 to Monroe, by\r\nJohn Taylor, of Caroline, the leading exponent of the orthodox\r\nVirginia tenets of state sovereignty. The writer was evidently\r\nstirred by the recent publication, in Calhoun's Washington organ, of\r\na series of letters signed A. B., [Footnote: Edwards, Illinois, 525;\r\nNational Intelligencer, April 21-23, 1823; Am. State Papers Finance,\r\nV., 1-145.] in which Crawford was denounced for corrupt dealings\r\nwith the banks, collusion with slave-traders, and intrigues in\r\ngeneral. Calhoun himself had just ended a visit with Taylor when the\r\nlatter wrote, bitterly condemning the \"example of obtaining the\r\npresidency by crafty intrigues and pecuniary influence,\" as tending\r\nto transfer power to a moneyed aristocracy. Neither Calhoun nor\r\nAdams, in his opinion, was open to this objection, and neither of\r\nthem, he thought, would prefer a protective tariff to a navy as a\r\nmeans of national defense. While he admitted his ignorance of\r\nAdams's views on the subject of division of power between the\r\nfederal and state governments, he declared that Calhoun had no\r\nadvantage on this point, for although the latter professed to\r\nconsider the distribution of powers between the states and the\r\ncentral authority as \"a distinguishing pre-eminence in our form of\r\ngovernment,\" yet, in the opinion of Taylor, he destroyed \"this pre-\r\neminence by endowing the federal government with a supremacy over\r\nthe state governments whenever they come in conflict.\" This was\r\nimportant testimony, following immediately on Calhoun's visit, and\r\ncoming from the pen of a man who was primarily interested in the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these objections, which would seem to be insuperable\r\nfrom the point of view of this distinguished expositor of state\r\nsovereignty, Taylor was ready to take the initiative in a movement\r\nagainst Crawford, if Monroe, Jefferson, and Madison agreed. Although\r\nas between Calhoun and Adams, he intimated that \"the Missouri\r\nquestion\" made a distinction of considerable weight, [Footnote:\r\nTaylor to Monroe, April 29, 1823, Monroe Papers, MSS. in Cong.\r\nLibr.; cf. \"Farmer's\" attacks on Crawford as a protectionist, in\r\nRichmond Enquirer, noted in Niles' Register, XXIV., 306. See Calhoun\r\nto Gouverneur, April 28, 1823, N. Y. Publ. Libr., Bulletin, 1899, p.\r\n324; Adams, Memoirs, VI., 356.] he did not press the point. James\r\nBarbour, the other senator from Virginia, also seriously thought of\r\nsupporting Adams, [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 242, 450-452; see\r\nalso Taylor's interview with Adams, May 26, 1824, ibid., 356, 357.]\r\nand it is clear that the secretary of state at this time was not\r\nregarded as unsafe in the Old Dominion. In the spring and summer of\r\n1823, however, Crawford seemed to be clearly in the lead. He was\r\nsupported by a well-organized press, which took its tone from the\r\nWashington newspapers; and until Calhoun, in retaliation,\r\nestablished a paper of his own to denounce Crawford's management of\r\nhis department, he had effective control of the most influential\r\norgans of public opinion. [Footnote: Ibid., 47, 56, 57, 60, 62-64,\r\n66.] He was a master of political manipulation; but among his rivals\r\nwere men of almost equal skill in this respect.\r\n\r\nClay was again chosen speaker, on his return to the House of\r\nRepresentatives in December, 1823, by a triumphant majority, and, as\r\nthe session advanced, he and Calhoun, with all the arts of\r\nfascinating conversation, plied the old and new members. At this\r\ncritical period in his campaign, Crawford was overwhelmed by a\r\nstroke of paralysis (September, 1823), which wrecked his huge frame\r\nand shattered his career. Shut in a darkened room, threatened with\r\nblindness and the loss of speech, bled by the doctors twenty-three\r\ntimes in three weeks, unable to sign his official papers with his\r\nown hand, he was prevented from conducting his own political battle.\r\nBut he kept his courage and his purpose, concealing his real\r\ncondition from all but his most trusted intimates. Not until April,\r\n1824, was he able to attend cabinet meetings, and within a month\r\nafter that he suffered a relapse, which prevented his active\r\nparticipation in his duties until the fall. [Footnote: National\r\nIntelligencer, September 15, 1824; Life of W. W. Seaton, 160; King,\r\nLife and Corresp. of King, VI., 539; Adams, Memoirs, VI., 130, 270,\r\n275, 356, 357, 387, 428, 435, 439; Univ. of North Carolina, James\r\nSprunt Hist. Monographs, No. 2, pp. 69, 71; Edwards, Illinois, 492.]\r\n\r\nAdams had the New England scruples against urging his cause\r\npersonally, and took the attitude that the office of president\r\nshould come from merit, not from manipulation. [Footnote: Adams,\r\nMemoirs, IV., 64, 242, 298, V., 89, 129, 298, 525; Dwight, Travels,\r\nI., 266.] Moreover, he saw that the practice of soliciting votes\r\nfrom members of Congress would render the executive subservient to\r\nthat body. Although his uncompromising temper unfitted him for the\r\ntactics of political management, he was an adept in the grand\r\nstrategy of the contest, and he noted every move of his adversaries.\r\nHis replies to attacks were crushing, for he had the gift of clear\r\nand forcible exposition. [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, V., 361, 496-\r\n535, VI., 116-118; King, Life and Corresp. of King, VI., 475;\r\nGallatin, Writings, II., 246.] But his greatest strength in the\r\npresidential contest lay in the fact that he was the only promising\r\nnorthern candidate.\r\n\r\nEarly in the campaign, Calhoun commented on the fact that five\r\ncandidates were from the slave-holding states--a circumstance which,\r\nin his opinion, would give Adams great advantages if he knew how to\r\nimprove them. [Footnote: Edwards, Illinois, 492.] Naturally,\r\ntherefore, Adams gained the influential support of Rufus King, the\r\nchief antagonist of the slave section. At first decidedly hostile,\r\nKing's final adhesion was given to him, not out of personal regard,\r\nbut because he believed that the public should be aroused against\r\n\"longer submission to a Southern Master.... He is the only northern\r\nCandidate, and as between him and the black Candidates I prefer\r\nhim.\" [Footnote: King, Life and Corresp. of King, VI., 508, 510.]\r\nSteadily Adams increased his following in reluctant New England.\r\n[Footnote: Niles' Register, XXIII., 322, 342; Clay, Private\r\nCorresp., 98; Adams, Memoirs, VI., 235.] In New York he had an\r\nelement of strength in the fact that the population was nearly\r\nevenly divided between the natives of that state and the settlers\r\nfrom New England. Of the delegation from the state of New York in\r\nthe seventeenth Congress, for example, those who were born in New\r\nEngland were about equal to those born in the state itself. Nearly\r\nforty per cent, of the members of the New York constitutional\r\nconvention of 1821 were born in New England. [Footnote: King, Life\r\nand Corresp. of King, VI., 413; Carter and Stone, Reports of New\r\nYork Convention, 637; Force, Calendar (1823).] The adhesion of ex-\r\nSpeaker Taylor, another of the champions of restriction in the\r\nMissouri struggle, furnished an able manager in New York.\r\n\r\nEven the attitude of Van Buren was for a time in doubt, for he would\r\ngladly have retired from politics to accept a place on the bench of\r\nthe supreme court of the United States; but Adams and King pressed\r\nhis candidacy for this position in vain upon the president, and Van\r\nBuren finally gave his full support to Crawford. [Footnote: King,\r\nLife and Corresp. of King, VI., 512-517, 518-527; Adams, Memoirs,\r\nVI., 168, 173; Crawford to Van Buren, August 1, 1823, Van Buren\r\nPapers (MSS.); Am. Hist. Assoc., Report 1904, p. 178.] So little did\r\nAdams appreciate the popular movement that was gathering about\r\nJackson's name, that he advised his followers to support the \"Old\r\nHero\" for the vice-presidency, \"a station in which the General could\r\nhang no one, and in which he would need to quarrel with no one. His\r\nname and character would serve to restore the forgotten dignity of\r\nthe place, and it would afford an easy and dignified retirement to\r\nhis old age.\" [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 333.] In January,\r\n1824, on the anniversary of the victory of New Orleans, Adams gave a\r\ngreat ball, attended by over a thousand people, in honor of his\r\nrival. [Footnote: Ibid., 220; Sargent, Public Men and Events, I.,\r\n48-51.]\r\n\r\nAfter Jackson's return from the governorship of Florida, in 1821,\r\nhis star steadily rose in the political horizon. His canvass was\r\nconducted by his neighbor, Major Lewis, who was one of the most\r\nastute politicians in American history, able subtly to influence the\r\nattitude of his volcanic candidate and to touch the springs of\r\npolitical management. On July 20, 1822, the legislature of Tennessee\r\nformally nominated the general for the presidency. [Footnote:\r\nParton, Jackson, III., 20; Niles' Register, XXII., 402.]\r\n\r\nThis gave the signal of revolt by the states against the\r\ncongressional caucus. Clay rallied his own forces, and in 1822 and\r\n1823 was nominated [Footnote: Niles' Register, XXIII., 245, 342;\r\nOhio Monitor, January 4, 1823; National Republican (Cincinnati),\r\nJanuary 14,1823; King, Life and Corresp., VI., 487; Clay, Private\r\nCorresp., 70. ] by members of the legislatures of Missouri,\r\nKentucky, Ohio, and Louisiana. [Footnote: National Intelligencer,\r\nApril 12, 1823; Ky. Reporter, April 21. 1823.] Alabama nominated\r\nJackson; and Mississippi, by a tie vote, proposed both Adams and\r\nJackson. [Footnote: McMaster, United States, V., 68.] These\r\nnominations by states showed that, however the west might be\r\ndivided, it was a unit in resistance to the selection of a president\r\nby a combination of congressmen. It was believed that the spirit of\r\nthe Constitution was violated by this method, which made the\r\nexecutive depend on the legislative body for nomination; and that a\r\nminority candidate might win by the caucus. This became the rallying\r\ncry of Jackson, whose canvass was conducted on the issue of the\r\nright of the people to select their president; [Footnote: Sargent,\r\nPublic Men and Events, I., 57; Parton, Jackson, III., 17, 40, 41.]\r\nand the prevalent discontent and industrial depression made the\r\nvoters responsive to this idea. The movement was one of permanent\r\nsignificance in American history, for it represented the growth of\r\ndemocracy, and led the way to the institution of the national\r\nnominating convention.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1823, Tennessee returned Jackson to the Senate,\r\nhaving chosen him over one of the prominent leaders of the Crawford\r\nparty, and, shortly afterwards, the legislature sent to the other\r\nstates a vigorous resolution, asking them to unite in putting down\r\nthe congressional caucus. [Footnote: Parton, Jackson, III., 21;\r\nNiles' Register, XXV., 114, 137, 197, 292; McMaster, United States,\r\nV., 60; Tyler, Tylers, I., 341; Richmond Enquirer, January 1, 6, 13,\r\n1824.] In Virginia and many other states the Tennessee resolutions\r\ngave rise to agitation which strengthened the popular feeling\r\nagainst congressional dictation. [Footnote: McMaster, United States,\r\nV., 60-62, 64; Dallinger, Nominations, 19 n., 54.] Although Adams at\r\nfirst considered the congressional caucus as one of the \"least\r\nobnoxious modes of intrigue,\" he also finally threw his influence\r\nagainst the system and announced that he would not accept a\r\nnomination by that body. [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 191, 236.]\r\n\r\nRealizing that, in spite of his illness, Crawford could command the\r\nlargest following in Congress, the friends of all the other\r\ncandidates united their forces in an effort to prevent the meeting\r\nof the caucus. Already it was evident to the Georgian's supporters\r\nthat the only thing that could bring him the victory was insistence\r\nupon party unity and discipline, and on February 14, 1824, sixty-six\r\nof the two hundred and sixteen Democrats in Congress gathered for\r\nthe last congressional caucus which nominated a president. That\r\nthese were practically all Crawford men was shown by his nomination\r\nwith only four opposing votes. [Footnote: Dallinger, Nominations,\r\n19; Niles' Register, XXV., 388-392, 403; Hammond, Pol. Hist, of\r\nN.Y., II., 149; McMaster, United States, V., 64; Life of W.W.\r\nSeaton, 173; Annals of Cong., 18 Cong., I Sess., I., 358.] Gallatin\r\nhad been persuaded to return from Paris, and he received the\r\nnomination for vice-president, in order to hold the state of\r\nPennsylvania in Crawford's column; but it proved a forlorn hope, for\r\nthis old companion-in-arms of Jefferson found Pennsylvania \"Jackson\r\nmad.\"\r\n\r\nCalhoun, seeing that he had lost the northern state on which he had\r\nfounded his hopes of success, and despairing of making inroads upon\r\nCrawford's southern forces after the congressional caucus, sought\r\nhis political fortunes in an alliance with his rival. [Footnote:\r\nClay, Private Corresp., 87.] The result was that, in a state\r\nnominating convention held at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (March 4,\r\n1824), Jackson was almost unanimously nominated by that state for\r\npresident, and Calhoun was named for the vice-presidency. In vain\r\nthe managers of Crawford sought to throw discredit upon Jackson by\r\nthe publication of his correspondence with Monroe, in which he had\r\npleaded for recognition of the Federalists; [Footnote: Parton,\r\nJackson, II., 357, III., 20; Monroe, Writings.] the letters added to\r\nhis strength, and finally Gallatin was induced to withdraw from the\r\nunequal contest, in order that an attempt might be made to persuade\r\nHenry Clay to accept the vice-presidency under Crawford. [Footnote:\r\nGallatin, Works, II., 297-300; Adams, Life of Gallatin, 604; Clay,\r\nPrivate Corresp., 100-103; Sargent, Public Men and Events, I., 57.]\r\n\r\nThe conflict was not entirely a matter of personal politics. Jackson\r\nhad raised the popular movement against the congressional caucus\r\ninto a distinct issue--the right of the people to choose their own\r\npresident. Clay's \"American system\" of internal improvements and the\r\nprotective tariff furnished others. We have seen that these subjects\r\nwere hotly debated in Congress during the spring months of 1824. As\r\nthe pre-eminent champion of these interests, Clay had a large\r\nfollowing in the states of the Ohio Valley, as well as in New York\r\nThe early popularity of Calhoun in Pennsylvania was also due, in\r\npart, to his record as a friend of tariff and internal improvements.\r\nUpon that subject, on July 3, 1824, he gave an exposition of his\r\nconstitutional principles to Garnett, of Virginia, in which he\r\nshowed some tendency to moderate his position. [Footnote: Houston,\r\nNullification in S. C., 143.] When interrogated upon his views in\r\nrespect to the tariff, Jackson replied, in a letter to Coleman,\r\navowing himself a moderate protectionist and a supporter of the\r\ndoctrine of the promotion of manufactures in order to create a home\r\nmarket; and in the Senate he voted for the tariff of 1824, and in\r\nfavor of internal improvements. [Footnote: Parton, Jackson, III.,\r\n34, 35; Niles' Register, XXVI., 245; Wheeler, Hist, of Cong., II.,\r\n231.] Crawford was embarrassed by the need of reconciling his\r\nsouthern support with his following in the middle states upon these\r\nsubjects. While his treasury reports indicated a preference for a\r\nrevenue tariff, they were sufficiently ambiguous to create\r\nopposition in the south and a loss of support in the north. The\r\nissue of internal improvements he evaded by professing himself in\r\nfavor of a constitutional amendment, for which he tried in vain to\r\nsecure the support of his friends in the Georgia legislature.\r\n[Footnote: King, Life and Corresp. of King, VI., 496, 500; Niles'\r\nRegister, XXIV, 306; Gilmer, Sketches, 294.]\r\n\r\nAdams announced that his policy with reference to the opposing\r\ninterests of the country was \"conciliation, not collision\"; but he\r\ndeclared that there was no constitutional question involved, either\r\nin the tariff or in internal improvements, [Footnote: Adams,\r\nMemoirs, VI., 353, 451; cf. 343.] and he was frankly in favor of the\r\nlatter, while he professed himself satisfied with the tariff of\r\n1824, as a reasonable compromise between the conflicting interests.\r\nIf changed at all, he believed that the tariff should be reduced. An\r\nattempt was made to bring him into disrepute in the south for his\r\nnegotiation of a convention in 1824 with England for the\r\ninternational regulation of the slave-trade. This subject had been\r\nforced upon his reluctant attention early in his career as secretary\r\nof state. While he was willing to join in declaring that traffic\r\npiracy, he was very proud of his record as a steadfast opponent of\r\nthe right of search in any form. It was too valuable political\r\ncapital to be given up, even if he had not espoused the cause with\r\nall his energy. To all propositions, therefore, for conceding the\r\nright of search of suspected slavers, Adams had turned a deaf ear,\r\nas he did to proposals of mixed courts to try cases of capture. But\r\nin the convention of 1824, declaring the slave-trade piracy under\r\nthe law of nations, he had offered to concede the right of British\r\nvessels to cruise along our coasts to intercept slavers, and this\r\nclause the Senate struck out, whereupon England refused to ratify\r\nit.[Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 321, 338, 345; Monroe, Writings,\r\nVII., 22; King, Life and Corresp. of King, 571, 572; DuBois, Slave\r\nTrade, 139, 140.]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, while candidates were forced to declare\r\nthemselves on important questions, and while there were distinct\r\nsectional groupings in Congress, which revealed conflicting\r\ninterests in economic policy, issues were not clearly drawn in this\r\ncampaign. Indeed, it was difficult for any one of the candidates to\r\nstand on a clear-cut platform without losing some of the support\r\nessential to his success. \"Could we hit upon a few great principles,\r\nand unite their support with that of Crawford,\" wrote his friend\r\nCobb, shortly before the election, \"we could succeed beyond doubt.\"\r\n[Footnote: Cobb, Leisure Labors, 216; Shepard, Van Buren, 92.]\r\n\r\nAs the year 1824 drew towards its close, the heat of the struggle\r\nwas transferred to New York. Nowhere was the revulsion of popular\r\nfeeling against caucus control more clearly manifested than in that\r\nstate. The feeling was aggravated by the fact that the Albany\r\nRegency, under Van Buren, stubbornly refused to concede the popular\r\ndemand for the repeal of the state law for choice of presidential\r\nelectors by the legislature. The political machine's control of the\r\nlegislature insured New York's vote to Crawford; but if the choice\r\nwere confided to the people, no one could predict the result. Out of\r\nthese conditions a new combination sprang up in New York, which took\r\nthe name of the \"People's party,\" and sought not only to transfer\r\nthe choice of electors to the people, but to overturn the Albany\r\nRegency. So rapidly did the discordant elements of New York\r\nClintonians and anti-Clintonians combine in this party, that\r\nCrawford's managers, in an effort to break the combination,\r\nintroduced a resolution in the legislature removing DeWitt Clinton\r\nfrom his office of canal commissioner. The purpose was to split the\r\nPeople's party by compelling its members to revive their old\r\nantagonisms by taking sides for or against Clinton. Although the\r\nresolution was carried by a decisive majority, the indignity placed\r\nupon the champion of the Erie Canal aroused popular resentment and\r\nincreased the revolt against the Regency. In September, 1824, the\r\nPeople's party met in a state convention at Utica and nominated\r\nClinton for governor. [Footnote: On the New York campaign, see\r\nRammelkamp, Am. Hist. Assoc., Report 1904, p. 177; Hammond, Pol,\r\nHist, of N. Y., II., chaps, xxix.-xxxii.; Weed, Autobiography, chap.\r\nxv.; McMaster, United States, V., 71-73.]\r\n\r\nWhile this campaign (which resulted in an overwhelming victory for\r\nthe People's party) was in progress, the legislature met to choose\r\nelectors. So clearly marked was the trend of public opinion that\r\nmany members broke away from their allegiance to Crawford. The\r\nSenate nominated electors favorable to him, but in the Assembly the\r\nAdams men predominated, although they were not in a majority. After\r\nseveral days of deadlock, a combination ticket, made up of Adams\r\nelectors and certain Clay men who had been named on the Senate's\r\nticket, was suddenly presented to the Assembly and passed, with the\r\naid of Crawford men, who thought that if the matter could be brought\r\nto a joint ballot they could then win and exclude Clay from the\r\ncontest. But the Adams men had conciliated the supporters of Clay by\r\nguaranteeing to them five electoral votes, which were expected, if\r\nthe ultimate choice of the president should come to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, to make Clay one of the three candidates before\r\nthat body. [Footnote: Clay, Private Corresp., 99, 104, 106; National\r\nIntelligencer, September 15, 1824; Van Buren to Crawford, November\r\n17, 1824; Van Buren Papers (Cong. Libr.).] The Clay following,\r\ntherefore, supported the Adams ticket on the joint ballot, with the\r\nresult that Adams secured 25 electors, Clay 7, and Crawford 4. When\r\nthe electoral college met in December, Clay lost three of his votes,\r\nso that New York finally gave 26 to Adams, 5 to Crawford, 4 to Clay,\r\nand 1 to Jackson. Thus the Adams men had failed to carry out their\r\nagreement with the followers of Clay; had not these three Clay votes\r\nbeen withdrawn he would have tied Crawford for third place.\r\nLouisiana, although New York's electoral college voted in ignorance\r\nof the fact, had already deserted Clay. [Footnote: N. Y. American,\r\nDecember 3, 1824; N. Y. Com. Adv., December 14, 1824; Weed,\r\nAutobiography, 128, is in error; L. E. Aylsworth, Clay in Elec. of\r\n1824 (MS. thesis).] The choice of electors in Louisiana was made by\r\nthe legislature, in the absence of several Clay men, and the\r\ncombined Jackson and Adams ticket received a majority of only two\r\nvotes over Clay. [Footnote: Sargent, Public Men and Events, I., 67;\r\nNiles' Register, XXVII., 257; Adams, Memoirs, VI., 446.] Thus\r\nvanished the latter's hopes of becoming one of the three candidates\r\nto be voted on by the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nIn the country as a whole, Jackson received 99 electoral votes,\r\nAdams 84, Crawford 41, and Clay 37. For the vice-presidency, Calhoun\r\nwas chosen by a vote of 182, while Sanford, of New York, received\r\nthe vote of Ohio, together with a portion of that of Kentucky and\r\nNew York; Virginia voted for Macon, of North Carolina; Georgia for\r\nVan Buren; and scattering votes were given for Jackson and Clay. No\r\npresidential candidate had a majority, and, in accordance with the\r\nConstitution, the House of Representatives was to decide between the\r\nthree highest candidates.\r\n\r\nTo Clay, powerful in Congress, fell the bitter honor of deciding\r\nbetween his rivals. Jackson had a decisive plurality of the\r\nelectoral vote, and even the Kentucky legislature, under the\r\ndominance of the \"relief party, \"urged the representatives from that\r\nstate to cast their vote in his favor.[Footnote: Adams, Memoirs,\r\nVI., 446.] But although Jackson was popular in the west, Clay had\r\nlong been hostile to the candidacy of this military chieftain, and\r\ncould not well alter his opinion. Moreover, Clay's presidential\r\nambitions stood in the way of this choice. It would not have been\r\neasy for him to become Jackson's successor, both because of the\r\ndifficulty of electing two successive candidates from the west and\r\nbecause Calhoun had already anticipated him in the alliance. With\r\nCrawford, he was on better terms; but that candidate was clearly in\r\nthe minority, his health was gravely impaired, and his following was\r\nmade up largely of the opponents of the policies which Clay\r\nrepresented.[Footnote: Ibid., VII., 4; Niles' Register, XXVII.,\r\n386.] He determined, therefore, to use his influence in behalf of\r\nAdams--the rival who had borne away from him the secretaryship of\r\nstate and whose foreign policy had been the target of his most\r\npersistent attacks. On the other hand, the recognition of the\r\nSpanish-American republics and the announcement of the Monroe\r\nDoctrine had made Adams in a sense the heir of Clay's own foreign\r\npolicy, and, in the matter of tariff and internal improvements,\r\nAdams was far more in accord with him than was Crawford.\r\n\r\nAs the day approached on which the House was to make its choice,\r\nfriends of Clay, including his \"messmate,\" Letcher, of Kentucky,\r\nsought Adams to convey to him the friendly attitude of Clay and\r\ntheir hope that their chieftain might serve himself by supporting\r\nAdams.[Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 447, 457, 473-475.] They made\r\nit perfectly clear that by this they intended to suggest for Clay a\r\nmembership in his cabinet. Without giving explicit promises, Adams\r\nmade it equally clear to these visitors that, if he were chosen by\r\nthe votes of western delegations, he should naturally look to the\r\nwest for much of the support that he should need. In short, Adams's\r\ndiary, like a book of judgment, shows that he walked perilously, if\r\nsafely, along the edge of his conscience at this time. \"Incedo super\r\nignes,\"[Footnote: Ibid., 453.] he wrote--\"I walk over fires.\" But\r\nhis diary records no vulgar bargaining with Clay, although he talked\r\nover with him the general principles which he would follow in his\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe adhesion of Clay by no means assured Adams's election: the\r\nresult was not fully certain until the actual vote was given.\r\nMissouri and Illinois were long in doubt,[Footnote: Ibid., 469.] and\r\nin the case of both of these states the vote was cast by a single\r\nperson. Cook, of Illinois, was a personal friend of Adams, and,\r\nalthough the plurality of the electoral vote of that state had been\r\nin favor of Jackson, Cook, giving a strained interpretation of his\r\npre-election promises to follow the will of his constituency, cast\r\nhis vote in favor of Adams. [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 443,\r\n473, 476, 495; Edwards, Illinois, 261-265.] With Scott, of Missouri,\r\nAdams made his peace in an interview wherein he gave him assurances\r\nwith respect to newspaper patronage and the retention of his\r\nbrother, a judge in Arkansas territory, who was threatened with the\r\nloss of his office because he had killed his colleague in a duel. He\r\nalso secured the vote of Louisiana, by the one delegate who held the\r\nbalance of power; and he won the Maryland member who had its\r\ndecisive vote, by the statement given through Webster, that his\r\nadministration would not proscribe the Federalists. [Footnote:\r\nAdams, Memoirs, VI., 492, 499; Webster, Writings (National ed.),\r\nXVII., 378.] Friends of all the other candidates were busy in\r\nproposing combinations and making promises which cannot be traced to\r\ntheir principals. [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 476, 495, 513;\r\nClay, Private Corresp., 109, 111; Parton, Jackson, III., 56.]\r\n\r\nWhen the vote was taken, Adams was found to have thirteen states,\r\nJackson seven, and Crawford four. [Footnote: See map.] Adams\r\ncontrolled New England, New York, and the Ohio Valley, with the\r\nexception of Indiana, together with Maryland, Missouri, and\r\nLouisiana. The grouping of the Jackson vote showed a union of the\r\nstates of Pennsylvania and New Jersey with South Carolina,\r\nTennessee, and the cotton states of the southwest. The Crawford\r\nterritory included Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware.\r\nVan Buren had received the electoral vote of Georgia for the vice-\r\npresidency, and he still exercised a powerful influence in New York.\r\nAdams had to face, therefore, the possibility of a union between two\r\nof the ablest politicians in the nation, Calhoun and Van Buren, both\r\nof whom saw that their political fortunes were involved in the\r\ntriumph of Andrew Jackson; and Jackson's popularity was\r\nextraordinary even in the western states which voted for Adams. Even\r\nas he saw victory approaching, the New England leader was filled\r\nwith gloomy forebodings over the prospects. \"They are nattering for\r\nthe immediate issue,\" he recorded in his diary, \"but the fearful\r\ncondition of them is that success would open to a far severer trial\r\nthan defeat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT ADAMS AND THE OPPOSITION (1825-1827)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor eight years President Monroe had administered the executive\r\ndepartment of the federal government-years that have been called the\r\n\"Era of Good Feeling.\" The reader who has followed the evidences of\r\nfactional controversy among the rival presidential candidates in the\r\ncabinet, and noted the wide-spread distress following the panic of\r\n1819, the growing sectional jealousies, the first skirmishes in the\r\nslavery struggle, and the clamor of a democracy eager to assert its\r\ncontrol and profoundly distrustful of the reigning political powers,\r\nwill question the reality of this good feeling. On the other hand,\r\nin spite of temporary reverses, the nation as a whole was bounding\r\nwith vigor in these years of peace after war; and if in truth party\r\nwas not dead, and a golden age had not yet been given to the\r\nAmerican people, at least the heat of formal party contest had been\r\nfor a time allayed. The bitterness of political warfare in the four\r\nyears which we are next to consider might well make the\r\nadministration of the last of the Virginia dynasty seem peaceful and\r\nhappy by contrast.\r\n\r\nMonroe's presidential career descended to a close in a mellow sunset\r\nof personal approval, despite the angry clouds that gathered on the\r\nhorizon. He had grown in wisdom by his experiences, and, although\r\nnot a genius, he had shown himself able, by patient and\r\ndispassionate investigation, to reach judgments of greater value\r\nthan those of more brilliant but less safe statesmen. Candor, fair-\r\nmindedness, and magnanimity were attributed to him even by those who\r\nwere engaged in bitter rivalry for the office which he now laid\r\ndown. He was not rapid or inflexible in his decisions between the\r\nconflicting views of his official family; but in the last resort he\r\nchose between policies, accepted responsibility, and steered the\r\nship of state between the shoals and reefs that underlay the\r\napparently placid sea of the \"Era of Good Feeling.\" How useful were\r\nhis services in these transitional years appeared as soon as John\r\nQuincy Adams grasped, with incautious hands, the helm which Monroe\r\nrelinquished.[Footnote: On Monroe's personal traits, see Adams,\r\nMemoirs, IV., 240 et passim; J. Q. Adams, Eulogy on the Life and\r\nCharacter of James Monroe; Schouler, United States, IV., 201-207.]\r\n\"Less possessed of your confidence in advance than any of my\r\npredecessors,\" wrote President Adams, in his first annual message,\r\n\"I am deeply conscious of the prospect that I shall stand more and\r\noftener in need of your indulgence.\" In his reply to the\r\nnotification of his election by the House, after adverting to the\r\nfact that one of his competitors had received a larger minority of\r\nthe electoral vote than his own, he declared that, if his refusal of\r\nthe office would enable the people authoritatively to express their\r\nchoice, he should not hesitate to decline; [Footnote: Richardson,\r\nMessages and Papers, II., 293.] he believed that perhaps two-thirds\r\nof the people were adverse to the result of the election.[Footnote:\r\nAdams, Memoirs, VII., 98; cf. ibid., VI., 481.] In truth, the\r\nposition of the new president was a delicate one, and he was\r\ndestined neither to obtain the indulgence asked nor the popular\r\nratification which he craved. By receiving his office from the hands\r\nof the House of Representatives in competition with a candidate who\r\nhad a larger electoral vote, he fell heir to the popular opposition\r\nwhich had been aroused against congressional intrigue, and\r\nespecially against the selection of the president by the\r\ncongressional caucus. More than this, it was charged that Clay's\r\nsupport was the result of a corrupt bargain, by which the Kentucky\r\nleader was promised the office of secretary of state. This\r\naccusation was first publicly made by an obscure Pennsylvania\r\nmember, George Kremer, who, in an unsigned communication to a\r\nnewspaper, when Clay's decision to vote for Adams was first given\r\nout, reported that overtures were said to have been made by the\r\nfriends of Adams to the friends of Clay, offering him the\r\nappointment of secretary of state for his aid to elect Adams; and\r\nthat the friends of Clay gave this information to the friends of\r\nJackson, hinting that for the same price they would close with the\r\nTennesseean. When these overtures, said the writer, were rejected,\r\nClay transferred his interest to Adams. [Footnote: Niles' Register,\r\nXXVII., 353.]\r\n\r\nStung to the quick, Clay rushed into print with a denunciation of\r\nthe writer as a dastard and a liar, and held him responsible to the\r\nlaws which govern men of honor. [Footnote: Ibid., 355.] In reply to\r\nthis evident invitation to a duel, Kremer avowed his authorship and\r\nhis readiness to prove his charges. If Clay had known the identity\r\nof his traducer, he would hardly have summoned him to the field of\r\nhonor, for Kremer was a well-meaning but credulous and thick-headed\r\nrustic noted solely for his leopard-skin overcoat. The speaker,\r\ntherefore, abandoned his first idea, and asked of the House an\r\ninvestigation of the charges, which Kremer reiterated his readiness\r\nto prove. But when the investigating committee was ready to take\r\ntestimony, the Pennsylvania congressman refused to appear. He was,\r\nin fact, the tool of Jackson's managers, who greatly preferred to\r\nlet the scandal go unprobed by Congress. If Clay transferred his\r\nfollowing to Adams, the charge would gain credence with the masses;\r\nif he were not made secretary of state, it would be alleged that\r\nhonest George Kremer had exposed the bargain and prevented its\r\nconsummation. In vain, in two successive and elaborate addresses,\r\n[Footnote: Address of 1825 and of 1827, in Clay, Works (Colton's\r\ned.), V., 299, 341.] did Clay marshal evidence that, before he left\r\nKentucky, he had determined to vote for Adams in preference to\r\nCrawford or Jackson, and that there was no proof of Kremer's charge.\r\n[Footnote: Clay, Address to the Public (1827), 52; ibid., Works\r\n(Colton's ed.), IV., 109; Adams, Memoirs, VII., 4.] In vain was\r\nevidence produced to show that friends of Jackson [Footnote: Clay,\r\nWorks (Colton's ed.), I., chaps. xvi., xvii.; Parton, Jackson, III.,\r\n56, 110-116.] and Crawford [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 464, 513,\r\nVII., 91.] solicited Clay's support by even more unblushing offers\r\nof political reward than those alleged against Adams. To the end of\r\nhis career, the charge remained a stumbling-block to Clay's\r\nambitions, and the more he denounced and summoned witnesses\r\n[Footnote: See, for example, testimony of congressmen, Niles'\r\nRegister, XXVIII., 69, 133, 134, 203; Address of David Trimble\r\n(1828).] the more the scandal did its poisonous work.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it was Adams who gave the charge immortality. Even if he\r\nhad appreciated the power of public feeling he would not have\r\nhesitated. If the accusation was a challenge to the spirited\r\nKentuckian, it was a call to duty to the Puritan. Two days after his\r\nelection, Adams, asking Monroe's advice about the composition of the\r\ncabinet, announced that he had already determined to appoint Clay\r\nsecretary of state, \"considering it due,\" said he, \"to his talents\r\nand services to the western section of the Union, whence he comes,\r\nand to the confidence in me manifested by their delegations.\"\r\n[Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 508.] Clay spoke lightly of the\r\nthreatened opposition as a mere temporary ebullition of\r\ndisappointment at the issue of the election, [Footnote: Adams,\r\nMemoirs, VI., 509.] and after a short interval accepted the\r\nappointment. [Footnote: For his reasons, see Clay, Works (Colton's\r\ned.), IV., 114, 192.]\r\n\r\nUp to this time Jackson had kept his temper remarkably; but now that\r\nAdams had called to the department of state the man who made him\r\npresident, the man who justified his choice by the statement that\r\nJackson was a \"military chieftain,\" the great deep of his wrath was\r\nstirred. Clay seemed to him the \"Judas of the West,\" and he wrote a\r\nletter, probably for publication, passionately defending the\r\ndisinterestedness of his military services, calling attention to the\r\nfact that Clay had never yet risked himself for his country, and\r\nsoothing himself in defeat by this consolation: \"No midnight taper\r\nburnt by me; no secret conclaves were held; no cabals entered into\r\nto persuade any one to a violation of pledges given or of\r\ninstructions received. By me no plans were concerted to impair the\r\npure principles of our republican institutions, nor to prostrate\r\nthat fundamental maxim, which maintains the supremacy of the\r\npeople's will.\" [Footnote: Niles' Register, XXVIII., 20; Parton,\r\nJackson, III., 77.]\r\n\r\nOn his way back to Tennessee, he spread broadcast in conversation\r\nhis conviction that \"honest George Kremer\" had exposed a corrupt\r\nbargain between Clay and Adams, [Footnote: Parton, Jackson, III.,\r\n107.] and to this belief he stuck through the rest of his life,\r\nappealing, when his witnesses failed him, to the stubborn fact of\r\nClay's appointment. [Footnote: Parton, Jackson, III., 110-116.] In\r\nOctober, 1825, Tennessee renominated Jackson, who accepted, and\r\nresigned his seat in the Senate, accompanying his action with a plea\r\nfor a constitutional amendment rendering congressmen ineligible to\r\noffice during their term of service and for two years thereafter,\r\nexcept in cases of judicial appointment. The purpose was evidently\r\nto wage a new campaign to give effect to \"the will of the people.\"\r\n[Footnote: Ibid., III., 95; Niles' Register, XXIX., 155.]\r\n\r\nAlthough he realized that an organized opposition would be formed,\r\nAdams sought to give a non-partisan character to his administration.\r\n[Footnote: Richardson, Messages and Papers, II., 295-297.] In spite\r\nof the low opinion expressed in his diary for the honesty and\r\npolitical rectitude of the secretary of the treasury, he asked him\r\nto retain his office, but Crawford refused. [Footnote: Adams,\r\nMemoirs, VI., 506, 508.] Ascertaining that Gallatin would also\r\ndecline the place, [Footnote: Ibid., Life of Gallatin, 607;\r\nGallatin, Writings, II., 301.] he appointed Richard Rush, of\r\nPennsylvania, then serving as minister to England. Jackson's friends\r\nmade it clear that he would take unkindly the offer of the\r\ndepartment of war, and Adams gave that office to James Barbour, of\r\nVirginia. [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 510; cf. ibid., 450.] He\r\nretained Southard, of New Jersey, as secretary of the navy, William\r\nWirt, of Virginia, as attorney-general, and McLean, of Ohio, as\r\npostmaster-general. The latter selection proved peculiarly\r\nunfortunate, since it gave the influence and the patronage of the\r\npost-office to the friends of Jackson. For the mission to England,\r\nhe first selected Clinton, and after his refusal he persuaded Rufus\r\nKing to take the post. [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 523.] Since\r\nKing's acceptance of the senatorship at the hands of the Van Buren\r\nelement in New York, he had been less a representative of the\r\nFederalists than in his earlier days; but the appointment met in\r\nsome measure the obligations which Adams owed to supporters in that\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nFar from organizing party machinery and using the federal office-\r\nholders as a political engine, he rigidly refused to introduce\r\nrotation in office at the expiration of the term of the incumbent--a\r\nprinciple which \"would make the Government a perpetual and\r\nunintermitting scramble for office.\" [Footnote: Ibid., 521.] He\r\ndetermined to renominate every person against whom there was no\r\ncomplaint which would have warranted his removal. By this choice he\r\nnot only retained many outworn and superfluous officers and thus\r\nfostered a bureaucratic feeling, [Footnote: Fish, Civil Service, 76-\r\n78.] but he also furnished to his enemies local managers of the\r\nopposition, for these office-holders were, in general, appointees of\r\nCrawford, in his own interest, or of McLean, in the interest of\r\nCalhoun and Jackson.\r\n\r\nSo rigidly did Adams interpret his duty in the matter that only\r\ntwelve removals altogether were made during his term. [Footnote:\r\nFish, Civil Service, 72.] He even retained the surveyor of the port\r\nof Philadelphia, whose negligence had occasioned the loss of large\r\nsums of money to the government and whose subordinates were hostile\r\nto Adams. Under such conditions, the friends of the administration\r\nhad to contend not only against their enemies, but against the Adams\r\nadministration itself, which left its power in the hands of its\r\nenemies to be wielded against its friends. [Footnote: Adams,\r\nMemoirs, VII., 163.] Binns, the editor of one of the leading\r\nadministration papers, in an interview was informed that the\r\npresident did not intend to make any removals. \"I bowed\r\nrespectfully,\" said the editor, \"assuring the president that I had\r\nno doubt the consequence would be that he himself would be removed\r\nso soon as the term for which he had been elected had expired. This\r\nintimation gave the president no concern.\" [Footnote: Parton,\r\nJackson, III., 92; Adams, Memoirs, VII., 154.]\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of his tenacity in this matter, even in\r\nopposition to the wishes of Henry Clay, was his refusal to remove a\r\nnaval officer at New Orleans who had made preparations for a public\r\ndemonstration to insult a member of Congress who had assisted in\r\nelecting Adams. Clay believed that the administration \"should avoid,\r\non the one hand, political persecution, and, on the other, an\r\nappearance of pusillanimity.\" But the president refused to remove a\r\nman for an intention not carried into effect, and particularly\r\nbecause he could frame no general policy applicable to this case\r\nwhich would not result in a clean sweep. Four-fifths of the custom\r\nofficers throughout the Union, he thought, were opposed to his\r\nelection. To depart in one case from the rule which he had laid down\r\nagainst removals would be to expose himself to demands from all\r\nparts of the country. [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 546.]\r\n\r\nThe president who rejected these favorite instruments of political\r\nsuccess was unable to find compensation in personal popularity or\r\nthe graces of manner. Cold and repellent, he leaned backward in his\r\ndesire to do the right, and alienated men by his testy and\r\nuncompromising reception of advances. And yet there never was a\r\npresident more in need of conciliating, for already the forces of\r\nthe opposition were forming. Even before his election he had been\r\nwarned that the price of his victory would be an organized\r\nopposition to the measures of the administration, [Footnote: Ibid.,\r\n476, 481, 495, 506, 510.] and that Calhoun and his friends in South\r\nCarolina and Pennsylvania would be the leaders. [Footnote: Am. Hist.\r\nAssoc., Report 1899, II., 230, 231; Calhoun, Works, III., 51;\r\nSargent, Public Men and Events, I., 106, 109.]\r\n\r\nThe union of the opposition forces into a party was perfected\r\nslowly, for between Crawford, Jackson, and Calhoun there had been\r\nsharp rivalry. Virginia by no means relished the idea of the\r\npromotion of the military hero; and in New York Jackson had been\r\nsustained by Clinton in 1824 against Crawford, the candidate of Van\r\nBuren. The Senate ratification of the nomination of Clay (March 7,\r\n1825) foreshadowed the alliance of southern interests with those of\r\nPennsylvania; [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 525, VII., 69.] but\r\nonly fourteen votes, including that of Jackson, were mustered\r\nagainst him, while among the twenty-seven who ratified the\r\nnomination was Van Buren. By the opening of the nineteenth Congress,\r\nin December, 1825, however, the situation might well have convinced\r\nAdams of the need of caution. Taylor, the administration candidate\r\nfor speaker, was elected by a majority of only five against his\r\nopponents' combined vote, and, in the Senate, Calhoun appointed\r\ncommittees unfriendly to the president.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in his first annual message [Footnote: Richardson,\r\nMessages and Papers, II., 299.] Adams challenged his critics by\r\navowing the boldest doctrines of loose construction. The tide of\r\nsentiment in favor of internal improvements was so strong [Footnote:\r\nJefferson, Writings (Ford's ed.), X., 348.] that, to insure its\r\ncomplete success, it would have been necessary only for the\r\nexecutive to cease to interpose the checks which Monroe had placed\r\nupon this movement. Prudence would have dictated to a president\r\nanxious to enlarge his following the avoidance of irritating\r\nutterances upon this point. But Adams characteristically threw away\r\nhis opportunity, choosing rather to make extreme proposals which he\r\nrealized had slight chance of success, and to state broad principles\r\nof national power.\r\n\r\nIn this respect he went even further than Clay approved. [Footnote:\r\nAdams, Memoirs, VII., 59, 61-63.] Defining the object of civil\r\ngovernment as the improvement of the condition of those over whom it\r\nis established, not only did he urge the construction of roads and\r\ncanals, but, in his enlarged view of internal improvements, he\r\nincluded the establishment of a national university, the support of\r\nobservatories, \"light-houses of the skies,\" and the exploration of\r\nthe interior of the United States and of the northwest coast.\r\nAppealing to the example of European nations, as well as of various\r\nstates of the Union, he urged Congress to pass laws for the\r\npromotion of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, the\r\n\"encouragement of the mechanic and of the elegant arts, the\r\nadvancement of literature, and the progress of the sciences,\r\nornamental and profound.\" \"Were we,\" he asked, \"to slumber in\r\nindolence or fold up our arms and proclaim to the world that we are\r\npalsied by the will of our constituents, would it not be to cast\r\naway the bounties of Providence and doom ourselves to perpetual\r\ninferiority?\" Such a profession of faith as this sounded strangely\r\nin the ears of Americans, respectful of their constituents and\r\naccustomed to regard government as a necessary evil. At a stroke,\r\nAdams had destroyed his fair prospects of winning the support of\r\nVirginia, and, what is more, he had aroused the fears of the whole\r\nslave-holding section.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1824 the legislature of Ohio passed a resolution\r\nin favor of the emancipation and colonization of the adult children\r\nof slaves, and was supported by the legislatures of at least six\r\nnorthern states, including Pennsylvania, while the proposal was\r\nattacked by all the states of the lower south. [Footnote: Ames,\r\nState Docs. on Federal Relations, No. 5, p. II (with citations);\r\nMcMaster, United States, V., 204.] This followed soon after the\r\nexcitement aroused by an attempted Negro insurrection in Charleston,\r\n[Footnote: McMaster, United States, V., 199; Atlantic Monthly, VII.,\r\n728.] in 1822, and from the fears aroused by this plot the south had\r\nnot yet recovered. Already Governor Wilson, of South Carolina, was\r\nsounding the alarm in a message [Footnote: December 1, 1824. Ames,\r\nState Docs. on Federal Relations, No. 5, p. 13; Niles' Register,\r\nXXVII., 263, 292.] denouncing the Ohio proposition, and declaring\r\nthat there would be more \"glory in forming a rampart with our bodies\r\non the confines of our territory than to be the victims of a\r\nsuccessful rebellion or the slaves of a great consolidated\r\ngovernment.\" Governor Troup, of Georgia, stirred by the same\r\nproposition, and especially by a resolution which Senator King, of\r\nNew York, submitted (February 18, 1825) for the use of the funds\r\narising from the public lands to aid in emancipating and removing\r\nthe slaves, warned his constituents that very soon \"the United\r\nStates government, discarding the mask, will openly lend itself to a\r\ncombination of fanatics for the destruction of everything valuable\r\nin the southern country\"; and he entreated the legislature, \"having\r\nexhausted the argument, to stand by its arms.\" [Footnote: Ames,\r\nState Docs. on Federal Relations, No. 5, p. 17; House Exec. Docs.,\r\n19 Cong., 2 Sess., IV., No. 59, pp. 69, 70.] While Georgia was in\r\nthis frame of mind, the administration, as we shall see, [Footnote:\r\nChap, xviii., below.] completed the breach by refusing to permit the\r\nsurvey of the Indian lands by the state, and thus forced the\r\nfollowers of Crawford in Georgia to unite with their former\r\nopponents in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nEven in North Carolina, where there had been a considerable\r\nsentiment in favor of Adams, [Footnote: Univ. of North Carolina,\r\nJames Sprunt Hist. Monographs, No. 2, pp. 79, 88, 106.] the\r\nconviction grew strong that, under such a loose construction of the\r\nConstitution as that which his message advocated, the abolition of\r\nslavery might be effected. The venerable Senator Macon, to whom\r\nAdams had at one time looked as a possible candidate for the vice-\r\npresidency, believed that the spirit of emancipation was stronger\r\nthan that for internal improvements; and that the president's loose-\r\nconstruction doctrine would render it possible for Congress to free\r\nevery slave. [Footnote: Ibid., 76, 106, 107.] One of the senators of\r\nSouth Carolina, desirous of supporting the administration in\r\nopposition to the Calhoun faction, begged Adams to include in his\r\nmessage some passage reassuring the south in the matter of slavery,\r\nbut he received a chilling reply. [Footnote:  Adams, Memoirs, VII.,\r\n57.] The speaker, Taylor, already obnoxious because of his previous\r\nchampionship of the proposed exclusion of slavery from Missouri,\r\naroused the wrath of the south by presenting to the House a memorial\r\nfrom a \"crazy Frenchman,\" who invited Congress to destroy all the\r\nstates which should refuse to free their slaves. [Footnote: Ibid.,\r\n103.] In short, there was a wide-spread though absolutely unfounded\r\nfear that the administration favored emancipation, and that the\r\ndoctrines avowed in the message of the president gave full\r\nconstitutional pretext for such action.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the opposition was in no agreement on principles.\r\n[Footnote: Univ. of North Carolina, James Sprunt Hist. Monographs,\r\nNo. 2, p. 79.] It was dangerous for the south to marshal its forces\r\non an issue which might alienate the support of Pennsylvania. Much\r\nmore safely could the enemies of the president press the charge that\r\nthe favorite of the people had been deprived of his rights by a\r\ncorrupt political intrigue. Consequently, a flood of proposed\r\namendments to the Constitution poured upon both branches of Congress\r\nday after day, demanding the abolition of the choice of president by\r\nthe House of Representatives and the exclusion of members of\r\nCongress from appointment to executive office during their term of\r\nservice. [Footnote: Ames, Amendments to the Const., in Am. Hist.\r\nAssoc., Report 1896, II., 21, 106, 339, 343.]\r\n\r\nThese measures were championed by McDuffie, Benton, and other\r\nfriends of Calhoun and Jackson. Although they were undoubtedly\r\ncalled out in part by a sincere desire to effect a change in a\r\nsystem which was regarded as dangerous, they also served admirably\r\nthe purpose of popular agitation. In pursuance of the same policy, a\r\nreport proposing restrictions upon the executive patronage was made\r\nin the Senate (1826) by a committee which included Benton and Van\r\nBuren. This was accompanied by six bills, transferring a large share\r\nof the patronage from the president to the congressmen, and\r\nproposing the repeal of the four-year tenure of office act.\r\n[Footnote: Fish, Civil Service, 73; McMaster, United States, V.,\r\n432.] Six thousand copies of this report were printed for\r\ndistribution, and the Puritan president, so scrupulous in the matter\r\nof the civil service that he disgusted his own followers, found\r\nhimself bitterly attacked throughout the country as a corrupt\r\nmanipulator of patronage.\r\n\r\nThe first fully organized opposition, however, was effected in the\r\ndebates over Adams's proposal to send delegates to the Panama\r\nCongress, for here was a topic that permitted combined attack under\r\nmany flags. In the spring of 1825 the ministers of Mexico and\r\nColombia sounded Clay to ascertain whether the United States would\r\nwelcome an invitation to a congress [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI.,\r\n531, 536, 542; International Am. Conference, Reports, etc., IV.,\r\n\"The Congress of 1826 at Panama,\" 23.] initiated by Bolivar, with\r\nthe design of consolidating the Spanish-American policy, though at\r\nfirst the United States had not been included among the states\r\ninvited. [Footnote: International Am. Conference, Reports, etc.,\r\nIV., \"The Congress of 1826 at Panama,\" 155.] Clay was predisposed to\r\naccept the overture, for he saw in the congress an opportunity to\r\ncomplete the American system, which he had long advocated and which\r\nappealed strongly to his idealistic view of the destiny of the new\r\nrepublics. [Footnote: See chap, xi., above.] But Adams was skeptical\r\nof the future of these new nations, and, as for an American system,\r\nhe had once (1820) declared that we had one already, \"we constituted\r\nthe whole of it; there is no community of interests or of principles\r\nbetween North and South America.\" [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, V.,\r\n176; cf. Am. Hist. Rev., XII., 113.]\r\n\r\nAdams had learned something from Clay in the mean time, however, and\r\nhis own share in announcing the Monroe Doctrine inclined him to\r\nfavor the idea of such a congress, under careful restrictions, to\r\nsafeguard our neutrality and independence. So the inquiries were met\r\nin a friendly spirit, and formal invitations were received from\r\nMexico, Colombia, and Central America in the fall of 1825, defining\r\nmore clearly the purposes of the congress and the mode of procedure.\r\n[Footnote: International Am. Conference, Report, IV., 24-34.] The\r\nexplanations still left much to be desired, and it may be doubted\r\nwhether the president would have accepted the invitation had not\r\nClay's zeal influenced his decision.\r\n\r\nAs its proceedings finally showed, the real purpose of the congress\r\nwas to form a close union of the new republics against Spain or\r\nother nations which might attack them or make colonial settlements\r\nin violation of their territory, and to determine the troops and\r\nfunds to be contributed by each state for this end. Its general\r\nassembly was to meet every two years, and, during the war, its\r\nmembers were to be bound by the action of the majority. [Footnote:\r\nInternational Am. Conference, Report, IV., 169 (Bolivar's\r\ninstructions); 184 (Treaty of Confederation framed by the Panama\r\nCongress).] Such an organization was manifestly dangerous to the\r\npredominance of the United States, and participation in it was\r\nincompatible with our neutrality and independence. Having reason to\r\napprehend that the congress might go to this extent, the president,\r\nin determining to accept the invitation, also determined so to limit\r\nour representatives that they should have no power to commit either\r\nour neutrality or our independent action, unless their action were\r\nratified by the government.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the prospect of an American system from which the\r\nUnited States was excluded was not a pleasing one, and certain\r\ntopics which were suggested for consideration made the situation\r\nreally critical. The presence of a large French fleet off the coast\r\nof Cuba, in the summer of 1825, revived the apprehension of an\r\ninvasion of that island, and both Colombia and Mexico contemplated\r\nan attack upon this remaining stronghold of Spain. The annexation of\r\nCuba and Puerto Rico by any of the South American republics would\r\nunquestionably have meant the emancipation of the slaves, and\r\nalready the spectacle of the black republic of Haiti had brought\r\nuneasiness to the south. In this juncture the administration\r\nendeavored to persuade the South American republics to suspend their\r\nexpedition, and made overtures for Russian influence to induce Spain\r\nto recognize the revolted republics and thus avoid the danger of\r\nloss of her remaining possessions.\r\n\r\nAdams sent a special message to the Senate (December 26, 1825),\r\nnominating two delegates to the Panama Congress. He attempted to\r\ndisarm the gathering opposition by declaring that, although the\r\ncommissioning of these delegates was regarded as within the rights\r\nof the executive, he desired the advice and consent of the Senate\r\nand the House of Representatives to the proposed mission. Among the\r\ntopics named by Adams as suitable for discussion at the congress\r\nwere the principles of maritime neutrality, and \"an agreement\r\nbetween all of the parties represented at the meeting that each will\r\nguard by its own means against the establishment of any future\r\nEuropean colony within its borders.\" This was a striking\r\nqualification of a portion of the Monroe Doctrine, and it indicates\r\nthe anxiety of the executive not to commit the United States to any\r\npermanent defensive alliance of the American republics. Seeing their\r\nopportunity, however, the opposition brought in a report strongly\r\nantagonizing the recommendation of this congress, on the ground that\r\nit involved a departure from our time-honored policy of avoiding\r\nentangling alliances, that the congress would really constitute a\r\ngovernment, and that the topics of discussion might better be\r\nhandled by negotiation with the respective states. The opposition\r\nconsidered rather the purposes of the congress as contemplated by\r\nthe South American promoters than the propositions which the United\r\nStates was willing to discuss in the purely consultative body which\r\nAdams and Clay had in mind.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge, ignored in the executive message, that the congress\r\nproposed to deal with the problem of the slave-trade and of the\r\ndestiny of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Haiti, kindled southern\r\nindignation at the idea of submitting the subject of slavery to the\r\ndiscussion of an international tribunal. In a notable speech, Hayne\r\ndeclared this an entirely \"domestic question.\" \"With respect to\r\nforeign Nations,\" said he, \"the language of the United States ought\r\nto be, that it concerns the peace of our own political family, and\r\ntherefore we cannot permit it to be touched; and in respect to the\r\nslave-holding States, the only safe and constitutional ground on\r\nwhich they can stand, is, that they will not permit it to be brought\r\ninto question either by their sister States, or by the Federal\r\nGovernment.\" [Footnote: Register of Debates, 19 Cong., 1 Sess., II.,\r\npt. i., 165.] \"The peace of eleven States in this Union,\" said\r\nBenton, \"will not permit the fruits of a successful Negro\r\ninsurrection to be exhibited among them.\" [Footnote: Register of\r\nDebates, 19 Cong., 1 Sess., II., pt. i., 330.]\r\n\r\nThis southern resentment against the submission of the question of\r\nour connection with slavery and with the insurrectionary Negro\r\nrepublics to the discussion of a foreign tribunal, was combined with\r\nthe opposition of northern men like Van Buren to engaging the United\r\nStates in a system for the control of American affairs by a\r\ncongress. Thus the enemies of the administration were brought into\r\nunison. Nevertheless, the Senate assented to the mission (March 14,\r\n1826) by a vote of 24 to 19; and, after an animated debate, the\r\nHouse, by a vote of 134 to 60, made the necessary appropriations. It\r\nwas a barren victory, however, for one of the delegates died while\r\non his way, and the other reached Panama after the Congress had\r\nadjourned. Although a subsequent session was to have been held at\r\nTacubaya, near the city of Mexico, dissensions among the Spanish-\r\nAmerican states prevented its meeting. [Footnote: Richardson,\r\nMessages and Papers, II., 329; International Am. Conference, Report,\r\nIV., 81, 113, 173-201.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nINTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS AND FOREIGN TRADE\r\n\r\n(1825-1829)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Adams had nearest at heart in his administration was the\r\nconstruction of a great system of roads and canals, irrespective of\r\nlocal interests, for the nation as a whole. [Footnote: Wheeler,\r\nHist. of Cong., II., 154; Adams, Memoirs, VII., 59, VIII., 444; cf.\r\nchap, xiii., above.] To \"exalt the valleys and lay low the mountains\r\nand the hills\" appealed to his imagination. He hoped that the\r\nincreased price of the public lands, arising from the improved means\r\nof communication, would in turn furnish a large and steadily\r\nincreasing fund for national turnpikes and canals. But the American\r\npeople were not anxious for a system of scientific administration,\r\neither of the public domain or of internal improvements. Although\r\nBenton could not secure sufficient support to carry his measure for\r\ngraduating the price of the public lands and donating those which\r\nfound no purchasers at fifty cents an acre, [Footnote: Meigs,\r\nBenton, 165-172.] he voiced, nevertheless, a very general antagonism\r\nto the management of the domain by the methods of the counting-\r\nhouse. Nor was the president able to control legislation on internal\r\nimprovements. The report of the engineers appointed under the\r\ngeneral survey act of 1824 provided for the development of the\r\nroutes of national importance. [Footnote: State Papers, 18 Cong., 2\r\nSess., V., Doc. 83 (February 14, 1825); cf. ibid., 19 Cong., 2\r\nSess., II., Ex. Doc. No. 10 (December 7, 1826).] But local interests\r\nand the pressure of corporations eager to receive federal\r\nsubscriptions to their stock quickly broke down the unity of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe Senate declined to take action on a resolution introduced\r\nDecember 20, 1825, by Senator Van Buren, of New York, which denied\r\nCongress the power to make roads and canals within the respective\r\nstates, and proposed a constitutional amendment for the grant of the\r\npower under limitations. [Footnote: Register of Debates, 19 Cong., 1\r\nSess., II., pt. i., 20; Ames, Amendments of the Fed. Const. (Am.\r\nHist. Assoc., Report 1896), 71, 261.] Provision had been made in\r\n1825 for extending the Cumberland Road from Wheeling to Zanesville,\r\nOhio, and for surveys through the other states of the northwest to\r\nMissouri, and appropriations were annually made for the road, until\r\nby 1833 it was completed as far as Columbus, Ohio. Nevertheless,\r\nthat highway was rapidly going to destruction, and a counter\r\nproject, ultimately successful, was already initiated for\r\nrelinquishing the road to the states through which it passed.\r\n[Footnote: Young, Cumberland Road, chap. vii.; Hulbert, Historic\r\nHighways, X.]\r\n\r\nOver two and a third million dollars was appropriated for roads and\r\nharbors during the administration of John Quincy Adams, as against\r\nabout one million during the administrations of all of his\r\npredecessors combined. Acting on the line of least constitutional\r\nresistance opened by Monroe, when he admitted the right of\r\nappropriation for internal improvements, though not the right of\r\nconstruction or jurisdiction, extensive appropriations were made for\r\nroads and canals and for harbors on the Great Lakes and the\r\nAtlantic. Far from accepting Adams's ideal of a scientific general\r\nsystem irrespective of local or party interests, districts combined\r\nwith one another for local favors, corporations eagerly sought\r\nsubscriptions for their canal stock, and the rival political parties\r\nbid against each other for the support of states which asked federal\r\naid for their roads and canals.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of this administration the popularity of internal\r\nimprovement appropriations seemed irresistible, although southern\r\nstates raised their voices against it and complained bitterly that\r\nthey were neglected. The example of the Erie Canal, which was open\r\nby 1825, seemed to furnish proof of the success that awaited state\r\ncanal construction. States were learning that English capital was\r\nready for investment in such undertakings and that Congress could\r\ndonate lands and subscribe for stock.\r\n\r\nBy acts of 1825 and 1826, Pennsylvania initiated its extensive state\r\nsystem of roads and canals to reach the Ohio, the central part of\r\nNew York, and the Great Lakes. [Footnote: Hulbert, Historic\r\nHighways, XIII., chap, iv.; Worthington, Finances of Pennsylvania,\r\n22.] The trunk line of this system united Philadelphia with\r\nPittsburgh by a horse railway to Columbia on the Susquehanna, thence\r\nby a canal along that river and its tributary, the Juniata, to\r\nHollidaysburg, where stationary engines carried the freight over a\r\nseries of inclined planes across the thirty-six miles of mountains,\r\nto reach the western section of the canal at Johnstown on the\r\nConemaugh, and so by the Allegheny to Pittsburgh. Sectional\r\njealousies delayed the work, and piled up a debt incurred partly for\r\nbranch canals in various parts of the state; but by 1830 over four\r\nhundred miles of canal had been built in Pennsylvania and five\r\nhundred more projected. Not until 1835 was the trunk line between\r\nPhiladelphia and Pittsburgh fully in operation, however, and in the\r\ndecade after 1822 the total expenditure for internal improvements in\r\nthe state amounted to nearly twenty-six million dollars, of which\r\nover ten millions was contributed by individual subscription. But\r\nthe steam railroad proved too strong a competitor, the state was\r\nplunged too deeply in debt, and it was not many years before the\r\npublic works were sold, and the era of the corporation opened.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal project [Footnote: Hulbert,\r\nHistoric Highways, XIII., chap, iii.; Ward, Chesapeake and Ohio\r\nCanal (Johns Hopkins Univ. Studies, XVII.)] had gained great impetus\r\nunder the efforts of those who wished to turn the tide of western\r\ncommerce to the Potomac River. The innate difficulties of the task,\r\neven more than the opposition of Baltimore, rendered abortive the\r\nefforts of the Potomac Company to make the river navigable above\r\ntide-water. But in 1823 public interest in Virginia and Maryland was\r\naroused by the plan of a great canal to run alongside of the Potomac\r\nto its upper streams, and thence to connect with the Monongahela or\r\nYoughiogheny in order to reach the Ohio. At a convention which met\r\nin Washington in the fall of 1823, Maryland, Virginia, and the\r\nDistrict of Columbia were largely represented by delegates\r\nenthusiastic over this new highway to the west. Even Baltimore\r\nacquiesced in the undertaking after a provision giving the right to\r\ntap the canal by a branch to that city, so that her western trade\r\nshould not be diverted to the Potomac cities.\r\n\r\nBy 1826 the company was duly chartered by Virginia and Maryland;\r\nPennsylvania's consent was also obtained; and the financiering of\r\nthe enterprise seemed feasible by joint subscription to the stock by\r\nMaryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and the federal\r\ngovernment. Under the general survey act of 1824, the route was\r\nsurveyed, including an extension to Lake Erie by way of a canal from\r\nthe Ohio. But when, in 1826, the board of engineers published its\r\nestimate of the cost of the canal, it was seen that the larger plans\r\nwere doomed, for the total cost was placed at over twenty-two\r\nmillion dollars. This was practically prohibitive, for the whole\r\ncapital stock of the Chesapeake and Ohio Company was only six\r\nmillions. Congress made a million-dollar subscription to the stock\r\nof the company, but only the eastern section of the canal could be\r\nbegun; the completion of navigation between the coal-fields on the\r\nupper Ohio and Cumberland on the Potomac must be postponed.\r\n\r\nBaltimore's interest in the grand design of canal communication\r\nbetween that city and Pittsburgh quickly disappeared. Nearer to the\r\nOhio Valley than any other seaport, she had built turnpikes to\r\nconnect with the national road, and thus shared with Philadelphia\r\nthe western trade. But now New York and Pennsylvania were\r\nundertaking canal systems which were certain in the long run to\r\ndestroy the advantages of Baltimore. In desperation, her far-sighted\r\nand courageous merchants inaugurated the plan of a railroad across\r\nthe mountains to the Ohio, grasping the idea that as the canal had\r\nshown its superiority over the turnpike, so this new device would\r\nwin the day over the canal. In 1827 and 1828 charters for the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad were granted by Maryland, Virginia, and\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAt Washington, on July 4, 1828, President Adams stripped off his\r\ncoat, amid the cheers of the crowd, and thrust the spade into the\r\nground in signal of the beginning of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal;\r\nbut on the same day a rival celebration was in progress at\r\nBaltimore, where the venerable signer of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, placed the foundation-\r\nstone to commemorate the commencement of the Baltimore and Ohio\r\nRailroad, first of the iron bonds between the east and the west.\r\nWhen Adams thus won the plaudits of the people for his evidence of\r\nability to break the conventions of polite society and use a\r\nlaborer's tool, it was perhaps the only time that he and democracy\r\ncame into sympathetic touch. But he was aiding in a losing cause,\r\nfor, though Carroll was a man of the past, destiny was working on\r\nthe side of the movement which he represented. In the field of\r\ntransportation, the initiative of individuals and of corporations\r\nduring the next two generations proved superior to that of state or\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Ohio, eager to take advantage of the competition\r\nof these rival routes from New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and\r\nWashington, and wishing to develop the central region of the state,\r\nundertook in 1825 a state system of canals connecting the Ohio with\r\nLake Erie. [Footnote: Morris, Internal Improvement in Ohio (Am.\r\nHist. Assoc., Papers, III.), 107; see also McClelland and\r\nHuntington, Ohio Canals.] The Ohio Canal began at Portsmouth and\r\nfollowed the valleys of the Scioto and the Cuyahoga to Cleveland,\r\nwhile another canal extended from Cincinnati along the Miami to\r\nDayton. By branches connecting with the Pennsylvania system, this\r\nnet-work of water-ways was intended to give alternative outlets for\r\nthe rapidly growing surplus of the state. Wheat which sold for from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty-seven cents per bushel in central Ohio in 1825\r\nbrought double the amount in 1832 when the canal began to be\r\neffective; and it sold for a higher price a hundred miles west of\r\nPittsburgh than it did sixty miles to the east of that city, where\r\nwater transportation was lacking. [Footnote: Quar. Jour. of Econ.,\r\nXVII., 15; Dial, in Ohio Archaeological and Hist. Soc.,\r\nPublications, XIII., 479.] An example of the rivalry of the\r\nfollowers of Adams and of Jackson in conciliating western interests\r\nis furnished in the case of Ohio, just prior to the campaign of\r\n1828, when each party in Congress persisted in supporting its own\r\nbill donating lands for the canals of that state. Owing to the fear\r\nof each that the other party would gain the credit of the measure,\r\nboth bills were passed, and Ohio received double the amount\r\noriginally asked. [Footnote: Benton, Abridgment, X., 197 n.] It was\r\nsmall wonder that Indiana, Illinois, and other western states\r\nmemorialized Congress for aid in their own plans for canals.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the states, no longer waiting for the federal\r\ngovernment to construct a national system; the rapidly growing\r\ndemand for the relinquishment of the national road to the states\r\nwithin which it lay; and the activity of corporations, all pointed\r\nto a new era in internal improvements. The states were ready to\r\nreceive appropriations, but they preferred to build their own roads\r\nand dig their own canals. The state and the corporation were\r\nreplacing the national government as the controlling power in\r\ninternal improvements, and Adams's conception of a national system\r\nof turnpikes and canals had failed.\r\n\r\nNor was President Adams successful in carrying out a system of\r\ncomplete maritime reciprocity. After the War of 1812, Great Britain\r\nand the United States agreed upon the abolition of discriminating\r\nduties on ships or products engaged in the trade between the two\r\ncountries; [Footnote: Cf. Babcock, Am. Nationality (Am. Nation,\r\nXIII.), chap. xvi.] but England reserved her right to exempt her\r\nAmerican possessions from this reciprocity. By excluding the ships\r\nof the United States from the trade with the English West Indies,\r\nEngland denied a profitable avocation to American ship-owners;\r\nwhile, at the same time, the liberal arrangements of the United\r\nStates permitted her vessels freely to enter the ports of this\r\ncountry with their cargoes of English manufactures, and to carry\r\nthence to the West Indies lumber, flour, and provisions to exchange\r\nfor the molasses and sugar of the islands.\r\n\r\nThis ability to make a triangular voyage, with profits on each\r\ntransaction, gave such advantage to British ships that they were\r\nable to carry on the trade between the United States and England at\r\na rate below that which American vessels could afford. Driven to\r\nseek some remedy, the Yankee merchants and skippers turned to the\r\nOrient. The trade with China and the East Indies developed rapidly,\r\nand our tonnage registered for foreign trade increased from 583,000\r\ntons in 1820 to 758,000 in 1828. [Footnote: Marvin, American\r\nMerchant Marine, chap. ix.] Ninety per cent. of our foreign commerce\r\nwas carried in our own vessels, and, from this point of view,\r\nAmerican shipping enjoyed one of the most prosperous periods in its\r\nhistory. [Footnote: Pitkin, Statistical View (ed. of 1835), 363;\r\nSoley, \"Maritime Industries,\" in Shaler (ed. of 1894), United\r\nStates, I., 538.] Smuggling was extensively carried on in the West\r\nIndies, and a war of retaliatory legislation in regard to shipping\r\ncharacterized the whole decade.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Parliament passed a somewhat obscure act which opened the\r\nports on a more liberal system of reciprocity. To nations without\r\ncolonies she offered the same shipping rights in her colonies which\r\nsuch nations gave to England and her possessions. The act provided\r\nthat it must be accepted within a year by nations who desired to\r\navail themselves of its provisions. President Adams preferred to\r\ndeal with the question by diplomacy, and Congress neglected to pass\r\nthe legislation necessary to accept the offer. When Gallatin, who\r\nhad been sent to England to treat of this matter, opened his\r\nnegotiations in 1826, he was informed that it was too late. The\r\nstipulated time having elapsed, American vessels were definitely\r\nexcluded from the West Indies in 1826 by orders in council.\r\n[Footnote: Adams, Gallatin, 615-620; cf. MacDonald, Jacksonian\r\nDemocracy (Am. Nation, XV.), 201.] In the campaign of 1828 Adams was\r\nblamed for the failure to seize this opportunity, but the generally\r\nprosperous condition of our shipping not only moderated the\r\ndiscontent, but even led to a law (May 24, 1828) intended to place\r\nAmerican vessels in complete control of our foreign commerce by\r\nproviding for the abolition, by proclamation of the president, of\r\nall discriminating duties against such nations as should free ships\r\nof the United States from corresponding discriminations. In the long\r\nrun, this reciprocity act proved a mistake; the end of Adams's\r\nadministration marked the beginning of a decline in the prosperity\r\nof the merchant marine. [Footnote: Soley, in Shaler, United States,\r\nI., 540.]\r\n\r\nAmerican commerce during this period by no means kept pace with the\r\ngrowing wealth and population of the country. [Footnote 2: Sterns,\r\nForeign Trade of the United States, 1820-1840, in Jour. Pol. Econ.,\r\nVIII., 34, 452.] As we have seen, the staple states produced the\r\nlion's share of the domestic exports, and the internal exchange\r\nfavored by the protective tariffs restrained the foreign\r\nimportations. Aside from the depression in 1821, following the panic\r\nof 1819, and the extraordinary rise in 1825, the exports in general\r\nexhibited no marked increase or decline between 1820 and 1829.\r\nImports showed a value of nearly seventy-four and one-half million\r\ndollars in 1820, ninety millions in 1825, and sixty-seven millions\r\nin 1829. [Footnote 3: Soley, in Shaler, United States, I., 538; cf.\r\nPitkin, Statistical View (ed. of 1835), 177; W. C. Ford, in Depew,\r\nOne Hundred Years of Am. Commerce, I., 23.] During the whole of\r\nAdams's administration, New York preserved its easy lead in domestic\r\nexports, although, as the west leaped up to power, New Orleans rose\r\nrapidly to a close second in exports of domestic origin. The\r\nsouthern cities retained merely the same proportion of the exports\r\nof domestic origin which they had in 1820, in spite of the great\r\nincrease of cotton production. New York and New Orleans gained a\r\nlarge fraction of this trade, and Massachusetts changed its\r\nproportion of domestic exports only slightly during the whole\r\ndecade. Over three-fourths of the cotton went to the British Isles,\r\nwhile almost all the pork and beef, and two-thirds of the flour,\r\nwent to the West Indies, South America, and Great Britain's American\r\ncolonies. [Footnote: Pitkin, Statistical View, 121-137.]\r\n\r\nThe statistics of commerce repeat the same story of increasing\r\nnational self-dependence which was told by the development of\r\nmanufactures, internal trade, and transportation, and even by the\r\ndiplomatic policy of the United States. The nation was building an\r\nempire of its own, with sections which took the place of kingdoms.\r\nThe west was already becoming the granary of the whole country. But\r\nin the development of this \"American system,\" the navigating\r\nportions of New England and the staple states of the south and\r\nsouthwest found themselves at a disadvantage. Their interest lay in\r\na free exchange across the ocean.\r\n\r\nAlthough many minor treaties of commerce and navigation were\r\nnegotiated by Clay during this administration, all his other\r\ndiplomatic efforts met with failure, among them attempts to purchase\r\nTexas and to procure a treaty with England for the rendition of\r\nfugitive slaves who had escaped to Canada--strange evidences of the\r\npolitical concessions of the northern president.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nREACTION TOWARDS STATE SOVEREIGNTY (1816-1829)\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the close of the War of 1812, an increasing reaction was in\r\nprogress in various states against the ardent nationalism which\r\ncharacterized the country at that time. The assertion of the\r\ndoctrine of state sovereignty by the Hartford Convention in 1814\r\n[Footnote: Babcock, Am. Nationality (Am. Nation, XIII.), chap. xv.]\r\nso aroused the other sections of the country that particularism was\r\nfor the time discredited. Leaders of Virginia politics even approved\r\na rumor that Madison would march troops against New England; Judge\r\nRoane, later a champion of Virginia's sovereignty, denounced the\r\n\"anarchical principles\" of the section. [Footnote: Randolph-Macon\r\nCollege, John P. Branch Hist. Papers, II., 18.] In that period, when\r\nCalhoun and the other leading statesmen of South Carolina supported\r\nthe protective tariff and the bonus bill, when Madison, the author\r\nof the Virginia resolutions of 1798, signed the bill for the\r\nrecharter of the national bank, when Chief-Justice Marshall, a son\r\nof Virginia, was welding firm the bonds of nationalism in his great\r\nseries of decisions limiting the powers of the states and developing\r\nthe doctrine of loose construction of the Constitution, [Footnote:\r\nBabcock, Am. Nationality (Am. Nation, XIII.), chap. xviii.] and when\r\nNew England itself was explaining away the particularistic purposes\r\nof the Hartford Convention, it might well seem that the days of\r\nstate sovereignty had come to an end.\r\n\r\nEven then, however, the pendulum was starting to swing in the\r\nopposite direction. The crisis of 1819 and the decisions of the\r\nsupreme court asserting the constitutionality of the national bank\r\nunder the broad national conception of the Constitution, produced\r\nprotests and even resistance from various states whose interests\r\nwere most affected. Ohio in 1819 forcibly collected a tax on the\r\nbranch bank of the United States, in defiance of Marshall's decision\r\nrendered earlier in the year in the case of McCulloch vs. Maryland;\r\nand in 1821 her legislature reaffirmed the doctrines of the Virginia\r\nand Kentucky resolutions, and passed an act withdrawing the\r\nprotection of the laws of the state from the national bank,\r\n[Footnote 2: Ames, State Docs. on Federal Relations, No. 3, p. 5.]\r\nand even persisted in her resistance after the decision (Osborn vs.\r\nBank of U. S., 1824) against the state. But the proceeds of the tax\r\nwere ultimately restored. Nor was Ohio alone in her opposition to\r\nthis decision. Kentucky was almost equally excited, and Senator R.\r\nM. Johnson made a vain attempt in 1821 to procure an amendment to\r\nthe Constitution providing that in controversies in which a state\r\nwas a party the Senate of the United States should have appellate\r\njurisdiction. [Footnote: Annals of Cong., 17 Cong., I Sess., I., 23,\r\n68, 96; Ames, State Docs., No. 3, p. 17; Ames, Amendments to the\r\nConst., in Am. Hist. Assoc., Report 1896, II., 161; Niles' Register,\r\nXVII., 289, 311, 447.] Judge Roane, chief-justice of Virginia, in a\r\nseries of papers in the Richmond Enquirer, challenging the\r\nnationalistic reasoning of the court, asserted that the Constitution\r\nresulted from a compact between the states, [Footnote 2: Randolph-\r\nMacon College, John P. Branch Hist. Papers, II., 106-121.] and in\r\nthis attack he was heartily supported by Jefferson. [Footnote 3:\r\nJefferson, Writings (Ford's ed.), X., 140, 189, 229.] Justice\r\nMarshall, in Cohens vs. Virginia [Footnote 4: 6 Wheaton, 264.]\r\n(1821), decided that the supreme court had appellate jurisdiction in\r\na case decided by the state court where the Constitution and the\r\nlaws of the United States were involved, even though a state was a\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nVirginia's attorneys maintained, on the contrary, that the final\r\nconstruction of the Constitution might be given by the courts of\r\nevery state in the Union; and Judge Roane, whose own decision had\r\nbeen overturned, again appealed to his fellow-citizens in a strong\r\nseries of articles. Again Jefferson denounced the consolidating\r\ntendencies of the judiciary, \"which, working like gravity without\r\nany intermission, is to press us at last into one consolidated\r\nmass.\" Virginia entered her solemn protest against the decision, and\r\nher House of Delegates reaffirmed the argument of Virginia's\r\ncounsel, and asserted that neither the government of the state nor\r\nof the United States could press the other from its sphere. In\r\neffect, Virginia's position would have given the state a veto on the\r\nwill of the federal government, by the protection which her courts\r\ncould have extended to the individual subject to her jurisdiction\r\nunder the interpretation placed by the state upon the Constitution.\r\n[Footnote: Randolph-Macon College, John P. Branch Hist. Papers, II.,\r\n28; Jefferson, Writings (Ford's ed.), IX., 184; cf. ibid., X.\r\npassim; Madison, Writings, III., 217-224; Ames, State Docs. on\r\nFederal Relations, No. 3. p. 15; Niles' Register, XX., 118; 6\r\nWheaton 385.] The leading expositor of Virginia reaction in this\r\nperiod was John Taylor of Caroline, the mover of the resolutions of\r\n1798. His \"Construction Construed\", published in 1820, was\r\nintroduced by a preface in which the editor said: \"The period is\r\nindeed by no means an agreeable one. It borrows new gloom from the\r\napathy which seems to run over so many of our sister states. The\r\nvery sound of State Rights is scarcely ever heard among them; and by\r\nmany of their eminent politicians is only heard to be mocked at.\"\r\nTaylor himself was led to write the book by the agitation over the\r\nMissouri question and the case of McCulloch vs. Maryland. One of its\r\npurposes was to insist that sovereignty was not divided between the\r\nseparate spheres of the state and federal government, but rested\r\nrather in the people of the several states. Two years later, in his\r\n\"Tyranny Unmasked\", Taylor developed the idea that the division of\r\nthe power of the people between the federal and state governments\r\nwould be nugatory if either Congress or the supreme court could\r\nexclusively determine the boundaries of power between the states and\r\nthe general government. His remedy for usurpation was the \"state\r\nveto,\" which was to be \"no mere didactic lecture,\" but involved the\r\nright of resisting unconstitutional laws. He met the difficulty that\r\nthe people of one state would construe the Constitution for the\r\npeople of all the states, by the answer that it was the lesser evil.\r\n[Footnote: Taylor, Tyranny Unmasked, 258, 262.] Again in 1823, in\r\nhis \"New Views of the Constitution\", he expounded the same ideas,\r\nand dwelt upon the position of the states as the defenders of\r\nseparate geographical interests against oppression by the majority\r\nof the nation. He saw a grave danger in the relinquishment to\r\nCongress of the power to deal with local and dissimilar geographical\r\ninterests by loose-construction legislation upon such subjects as\r\nbanks, roads, canals, and manufactures. It would tend to produce\r\ngeographical combinations; sections by combining would exploit and\r\noppress the minority; \"Congress would become an assembly of\r\ngeographical envoys from the North, the South, and the West.\"\r\nAgainst these evils, the Constitution, according to his view, had\r\nprovided by confining geographical interests within state lines\r\ninstead of \"collecting them into one intriguing arena.\" The states,\r\nreposing on their sovereignty, would interpose a check to oppressive\r\naction and to the combination of sectional interests against the\r\nminority. [Footnote 1: Taylor, New Views (ed. of 1823), 261 et seq.]\r\n\r\nNot a theory of government, however, but a political exigency called\r\nout a working principle of state rights. When the industrial policy\r\nof the government fell under the complete control of the north, and\r\nthe social system of the south seemed to be menaced, state\r\nsovereignty controlled the southern policy. The increase in\r\npopularity of Clay's American system of internal improvements and a\r\nprotective tariff aroused the apprehensions of the whole planting\r\nsection; the struggle over the admission of Missouri taught the\r\nsouth the power of an unfriendly national majority; and, in 1822, a\r\nthreatened insurrection of the Negroes at Charleston brought home to\r\nthe whole section, and particularly to South Carolina, the dangers\r\narising from an agitation of the question of slavery. [Footnote 2:\r\nCf. Hart, Slavery and Abolition (Am. Nation, XVI.), chap. viii.] In\r\nthe irritated condition and depression of this section, the triumph\r\nof loose construction principles and the possible election of a\r\nnorthern president seemed to presage not only the sacrifice of their\r\neconomic interests, but even the freeing of their slaves. [Footnote\r\n3: See the resolutions of Virginia, December 23, 1816, in Ames,\r\nState Docs. on Federal Relations, No. 5, p. 3.] The colonization\r\nsociety, which in its origin had been supported by southern men,\r\nbecame an object of denunciation by the lower south after the\r\nMissouri controversy and the insurrection of 1822. The opposition\r\nwas intensified by the disposition of the society, towards the close\r\nof the period, to advocate emancipation, as well as the removal of\r\nthe existing free Negroes. [Footnote: Cf. Hart, Slavery and\r\nAbolition (Am. Nation, XVI.), chap. xiv.]\r\n\r\nIn Virginia the doctrine of state rights was supported by the\r\nfriends of Crawford, and, in general, by the older portion of the\r\nstate. In her western counties, however, where a movement was in\r\nprogress for a constitutional convention to redistribute political\r\npower so that the populous interior should not be subordinated to\r\nthe slave-holding minority of the coast, there was a strong\r\nsentiment in favor of the constitutionality and expediency both of\r\nfederal internal improvements and the tariff. Nevertheless,\r\nVirginia's voice was determined by the ascendancy of the old-time\r\nplantation interests. In 1825, Jefferson suggested that the\r\nlegislature of Virginia should pass a set of resolutions, declaring\r\nthe internal-improvement laws null and void. He advised, however,\r\nthat, at the same time, the issue should be avoided by an act of the\r\nVirginia legislature validating these congressional laws [Footnote\r\n2: Jefferson, Writings (Ford's ed.), X., 348-352; Ames, State Docs.\r\non Federal Relations, No. 4, p. 8.] until action could be taken on a\r\ncarefully guarded proposal to amend the Constitution so as to grant\r\nthe right. This was the last effort of Jefferson to stay the tide of\r\ninternal improvements which was sweeping opposition before it, and\r\neven he withdrew his project before it was acted on. His death (July\r\n4, 1826) removed from Virginia the most influential advocate of\r\nstate sovereignty and the greatest of the Virginia dynasty since\r\nWashington. On the same day John Adams died. The men who made the\r\ndeclaration of independence were passing away, but the spirit of\r\nthat epoch was reviving in the south.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina was the theatre of a conflict between the old-time\r\nforces of nationalism, of which Calhoun had been the most prominent\r\nexponent, and the newer tendencies which would safeguard the\r\ninterests of the commonwealth by appealing to the doctrine of state\r\nsovereignty. [Footnote: Houston, Nullification in S. C., chap. iv. ]\r\nAt first, the conservative party was in the ascendancy. In 1820 the\r\nHouse of Representatives of South Carolina passed a resolution which\r\ndeprecated the system of protection as premature and pernicious, but\r\nadmitted that Congress possessed the power of enacting all laws\r\nrelating to commerce, and lamented the practice \"of arraying upon\r\nthe questions of national policy the states as distinct and\r\nindependent sovereignties in opposition to, or (what is much the\r\nsame thing), with a view to exercise a control over the general\r\ngovernment\"; [Footnote 2: Ames, State Docs. on Federal Relations,\r\nNo. 4, p. 3.] and, as late as 1824, the same body passed resolutions\r\ndeclaring that the man \"who disseminates doctrines whose tendency is\r\nto give an unconstitutional preponderance to State, or United\r\nStates' rights, must be regarded as inimical to the forms of\r\ngovernment under which we have hitherto so happily lived\"; and that\r\n\"the People have conferred no power upon their state legislature to\r\nimpugn the Acts of the Federal Government or the decisions of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States.\" [Footnote: Ames, State Docs. on\r\nFederal Relations, No. 4, p. 6.] The state Senate was already\r\ncontrolled by the opponents of national power, led by Judge Smith;\r\nand the next year the Lower House also fell under their dominance.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of McDuffie illustrates the transitional conditions in\r\nSouth Carolina. In 1821 he published a pamphlet supporting a liberal\r\nconstruction of the powers of Congress, and refuting the \"ultra\r\ndoctrines respecting consolidation and state sovereignty.\" [Footnote\r\n2: Defense of a Liberal Construction, etc., by \"One of the People.\"\r\nReprinted in Philadelphia, 1831. To this pamphlet, Governor Hamilton\r\nhad prefixed \"an encomiastic advertisement.\"] In 1824, also, he\r\nsupported the constitutionality and expediency of the general survey\r\nact, and repudiated the idea that the state governments were \"in any\r\nrespect more worthy of confidence than the General Government.\"\r\n[Footnote 3: Annals of Cong., 18 Cong., I Sess., 1372.] But he\r\nopposed the tariff of 1824, and in 1825 he voted against specific\r\nmeasures for internal improvement. Soon after this he joined the\r\nranks of the advocates of state sovereignty, and, together with\r\nHamilton and Hayne, so far outstripped the leaders of that faction\r\nthat Judge Smith and his friends found themselves in a conservative\r\nminority against the ultra doctrines of their former opponents.\r\nDoubtless the reversal of South Carolina's attitude was accelerated\r\nby the slavery agitation which followed the emancipation proposition\r\nof Ohio, already mentioned, and by the contest over the Negro seamen\r\nact, [Footnote: Passed December 21, 1822. See Ames, State Docs. on\r\nFederal Relations, No. 5, p. 12; cf. Hart, Slavery and Abolition\r\n(Am. Nation, XVI.), chap. xix.] a measure by which South Carolina,\r\nin consequence of the plot at Charleston, required that free Negroes\r\non vessels entering a port of South Carolina should be imprisoned\r\nduring the sojourn of the ship. The act brought out protests, both\r\nfrom other states and from Great Britain, whose subjects were\r\nimprisoned; and it was declared unconstitutional by Adams's\r\nattorney-general and by the federal courts nevertheless, it remained\r\nunrepealed and continued to be enforced. [Footnote 2: McMaster,\r\nUnited States, V., 200-204, 417.] The Senate of South Carolina met\r\nthe situation, at the close of 1824, by resolutions affirming that\r\nthe duty of preventing insurrections was \"paramount to all laws, all\r\ntreaties, all constitutions,\" and protesting against any claims of\r\nright of the United States to interfere with her domestic\r\nregulations in respect to the colored population. [Footnote 3: Ames,\r\nState Docs. on Federal Relations, No. 5, p. 14.]\r\n\r\nGeorgia, a few years later (December, 1827), in opposition to the\r\nColonization Society, [Footnote 4: Ibid., 17, 19.] vehemently\r\nasserted her rights, and found the remedy no longer in remonstrance,\r\nbut in \"a firm and determined union of the people and the states of\r\nthe south\" against submission to interference. Already Georgia had\r\nplaced herself in the attitude of resistance to the general\r\ngovernment over the question of the Indians within the state. From\r\nthe beginning of the nation, the Indians on the borders of the\r\nsettled area of Georgia were a menace and an obstacle to her\r\ndevelopment. Indeed, they constituted a danger to the United States\r\nas well: their pretensions to independence and complete sovereignty\r\nover their territory were at various times utilized by adventurers\r\nfrom France, England, and Spain as a means of promoting the designs\r\nof these powers. [Footnote: Am. Hist. Rev., X., 249.] Jackson drove\r\na wedge between the Indian confederacies of this region by his\r\nvictories in the War of 1812 and the cessions which followed.\r\n[Footnote: Babcock, Am. Nationality (Am. Nation, XIII.), chaps, ii.,\r\nxvii.] Although, in 1821, a large belt of territory between the\r\nOcmulgee and Flint rivers was ceded by the Creeks to Georgia, the\r\nstate saw with impatience some of the best lands still occupied by\r\nthese Indians in the territory lying between the Flint and the\r\nChattahoochee.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of a stream of Georgia settlers crossing this rich\r\nIndian area of their own state to settle in the lands newly acquired\r\nin Alabama and Mississippi provoked Georgia's wrath, and numerous\r\nurgent calls were made upon the government to carry out the\r\nagreement made in 1802, [Footnote: Phillips, \"Georgia and State\r\nRights,\" in Am. Hist. Assoc., Report 1901, II., 34.] by completing\r\nthe acquisition of these Indian lands. Responding to this demand, a\r\ntreaty was made at Indian Springs in February, 1825, by which the\r\nCreeks ceded all of their lands in Georgia; but when Adams came to\r\nthe presidency he was confronted with a serious situation arising\r\nfrom this treaty. Shortly after it had been ratified, Mclntosh, a\r\nprincipal chief of the Lower Creeks, who had signed the treaty,\r\ncontrary to the rule of the tribe and in spite of the decision to\r\nsell no more land, was put to death; and the whole treaty was\r\nrepudiated by the great body of the Creeks, as having been procured\r\nby fraud and made by a small minority of their nation. The\r\ndifficulty arose from the fact that the various villages of these\r\nIndians were divided into opposing parties: the Upper Creeks, living\r\nchiefly along the forks of the Alabama, on the Tallapoosa and the\r\nCoosa in Alabama, constituting the more numerous branch, were\r\ndetermined to yield no more territory, while the principal chiefs of\r\nthe Lower Creeks, who dwelt in western Georgia, along the Flint and\r\nChattahoochee branches of the Appalachicola, were not unfavorable to\r\nremoval.\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Troup, of Georgia, determined to survey the ceded\r\nlands, he was notified that the president expected Georgia to\r\nabandon the survey until it could be done consistently with the\r\nprovisions of the treaty. Although the treaty had given the Creeks\r\nuntil September, 1826, to vacate, Governor Troup informed General\r\nGaines, who had been sent to preserve peace, that, as there existed\r\n\"two independent parties to the question, each is permitted to\r\ndecide for itself,\" and he announced that the line would be run and\r\nthe survey effected. The defiant correspondence which now ensued\r\nbetween the governor and the war department doubtless reflected the\r\npersonal hot-headedness of Troup himself, but Georgia supported her\r\ngovernor and made his defiances effective. He plainly threatened\r\ncivil war in case the United States used force to prevent the\r\nsurvey. [Footnote: Ames, State Docs on Federal Relations, No. 3, pp.\r\n25-31; Phillips, \"Georgia and State Rights,\" in Am. Hist. Assoc.,\r\nReport 1901, II., 58-60; 40 (map).]\r\n\r\nOn investigation, President Adams reached the conclusion that the\r\ntreaty was wrongfully secured, and gave orders for a new\r\nnegotiation. This resulted in the treaty of Washington, in January,\r\n1826, supplemented by that of March, 1826, by which the Creek\r\nIndians ceded all of their lands within the state except a narrow\r\nstrip along the western border. This treaty abrogated the treaty of\r\nIndian Springs and it provided that the Indians should remain in\r\npossession of their lands until January 1, 1827. Throughout the\r\nwhole of these proceedings Georgia was bitterly incensed. Claiming\r\nthat the treaty of Indian Springs became operative after its\r\nratification, and that the lands acquired by it were thereby\r\nincorporated with Georgia and were under her sovereignty, the state\r\ndenied the right of the general government to reopen the question.\r\n\"Georgia,\" said Troup, \"is sovereign on her own soil,\" and he\r\nentered actively upon the survey of the tract without waiting for\r\nthe date stipulated in the new treaty. When the surveyors entered\r\nthe area not ceded by the later treaty, the Indians threatened to\r\nuse force against them, and at the beginning of 1827 another heated\r\ncontroversy arose. The president warned the governor of Georgia that\r\nhe should employ, if necessary, \"all the means under his control to\r\nmaintain the faith of the nation by carrying the treaty into\r\neffect.\" Having done this, he submitted the whole matter in a\r\nspecial message to Congress. [Footnote: February 5, 1827.\r\nRichardson, Messages and Papers, II., 370.]\r\n\r\n\"From the first decisive act of hostility,\" wrote Troup to the\r\nsecretary of war, \"you will be considered and treated as a public\r\nenemy\"; and he announced his intention to resist any military attack\r\non the part of the United States, \"the unblushing allies of the\r\nsavages.\" [Footnote: Harden, Troup, 485.] He thereupon made\r\npreparations for liberating any surveyors who might be arrested by\r\nthe United States, and for calling out the militia. In the House of\r\nRepresentatives, a committee recommended the purchase of the Indian\r\ntitle to all lands in Georgia, and, until such cession were\r\nprocured, the maintenance of the treaty of Washington by all\r\nnecessary and constitutional means; but the report of the Senate\r\ncommittee, submitted by Benton, supported the idea that the\r\nratification of the treaty of Indian Springs vested the title to the\r\nlands in Georgia, and reached the conclusion that no preparations\r\nshould be made to coerce the state by military force. In November,\r\n1827, the Creeks consented to a treaty extinguishing the last of\r\ntheir claims, and the issue was avoided.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the Cherokees in the north-western portion of the\r\nstate gave rise to a new problem by adopting a national constitution\r\n(July 26, 1827) and asserting that they constituted one of the\r\nsovereign and independent nations of the earth, with complete\r\njurisdiction over their own territory to the exclusion of the\r\nauthority of any other state. [Footnote: Text in Exec. Docs., 23\r\nCong., 2 Sess., III., No. 91 (Serial No. 273); Ames, State Docs. on\r\nFederal Relations, No. 3, p. 36; see also House Reports, 19 Cong., 2\r\nSess. No. 98.] This bold challenge was met by Georgia in the same\r\nspirit which guided her policy in regard to the Creek lands. The\r\nlegislature, by an act of December 20, 1828, subjected all white\r\npersons in the Cherokee territory to the laws of Georgia, and\r\nprovided that in 1830 the Indians also should be subject to the laws\r\nof the state. Thus Georgia completed her assertion of sovereignty\r\nover her soil both against the United States and the Indians. But\r\nthis phase of the controversy was not settled during the presidency\r\nof Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE TARIFF OF ABOMINATIONS AND THE SOUTH CAROLINA EXPOSITION (1827-\r\n1828)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the slavery agitation was inflaming the minds of South\r\nCarolina and her sister states of the cotton region, and while\r\nGeorgia, half a frontier state, was flinging defiance at the general\r\ngovernment when it checked her efforts to complete the possession of\r\nher territory, the reopening of the tariff question brought the\r\nmatter of state resistance to a climax.\r\n\r\nThe tariff of 1824 was unsatisfactory to the woolen interests. In\r\nthe course of the decade there had been an astonishing increase of\r\nwoolen factories in New England, [Footnote: See chap. ii., above.]\r\nand the strength of the protective movement grew correspondingly in\r\nthat section. By a law which took effect at the end of 1824, England\r\nreduced the duty on wool to a penny a pound, and thus had the\r\nadvantage of a cheap raw material as well as low wages, so that the\r\nAmerican mills found themselves placed at an increasing\r\ndisadvantage. Under the system of ad valorem duties, the English\r\nexporters got their goods through the United States custom-house by\r\nsuch under valuation as gravely diminished even the protection\r\nafforded by the tariff of 1824; and the unloading of large\r\nquantities of woolen goods by auction sales brought a cry of\r\ndistress from New England. This led to an agitation to substitute\r\nspecific duties in place of ad valorem, and to apply to woolens the\r\nminimum principle already applied to cottons. At the same time\r\nsheep-raisers were demanding increased protection.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1827, therefore, Mallory, of Vermont, a state which was\r\nespecially interested in wool-growing, brought into the House of\r\nRepresentatives a report of the committee on manufactures, proposing\r\na bill which provided three minimum points for woolen goods, with\r\ncertain exceptions, those that cost less than 40 cents a square yard\r\nwere to be rated as though they cost 40 cents in imposing the\r\ntariff; those which cost between 40 cents and $2.50 were reckoned at\r\n$2.50; and those which cost between $2.50 and $4, at $4. Upon\r\nunmanufactured wool, after 1828, a duty of forty per cent, was\r\nimposed, and all wool costing between 10 and 40 cents a pound was to\r\nbe rated at 40 cents. [Footnote: Stanwood, Tariff Controversies, I.,\r\n255.]\r\n\r\nThe political situation exercised a dominant influence upon the\r\ntariff legislation at this time. As the campaign between Adams and\r\nJackson was approaching its end, the managers of Jackson faced the\r\nproblem of how to hold together the forces of the south, which were\r\nalmost to a man opposed to tariff legislation, and those of\r\nPennsylvania and New York, where protection was so popular. Jackson\r\nhimself, as we have seen, announced his belief in the home-market\r\nidea, and, although with some reservations, committed himself to the\r\nsupport of the protective system.\r\n\r\nWhile the forces of Jackson were not harmonious on the tariff,\r\nneither was there consistency of interests between the friends of\r\nprotection in New England, the middle states, and the west. If New\r\nEngland needed an increased tariff to sustain her woolen factories,\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, and parts of New York were equally interested in\r\nextending the protection to wool, the raw material of the New\r\nEngland mills. If the New England shipping interests demanded cheap\r\ncordage, on the other hand, the Kentucky planters were ever ready to\r\nplead for an increased duty upon the hemp which made the ropes. If\r\niron foundries were developing among the towns of the New England\r\ncoast, where ships brought in the raw material from Sweden and from\r\nEngland, the Pennsylvania forges found an opposite interest in their\r\ndesire for an increased duty on pig-iron to protect the domestic\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nThe history of the tariff has always been the history of the\r\nstruggle to combine local and opposing interests into a single bill.\r\nSuch conditions furnished opportunity for the clever politicians who\r\nguided Jackson's canvass to introduce discordant ideas and jealousy\r\nbetween the middle states, the west, and New England. The silence of\r\nthe New England president upon the question of the tariff, the\r\n\"selfishness of New England's policy,\" and the inducements offered\r\nto the middle region and the west to demand protection for their\r\nspecial interests were all successfully used to break the unity of\r\nthe tariff forces. Even protectionist Pennsylvania, and Kentucky,\r\nhome of the champion of the American system, gave a large share of\r\ntheir votes against the bill. Although it passed the House (February\r\n10, 1827), the Senate laid it on the table by the casting-vote of\r\nVice-President Calhoun, who was thus compelled to take the\r\nresponsibility of defeating the measure, [Footnote: See the account\r\nof Van Buren's tactics at this time, in Stanwood, Tariff\r\nControversies, I., 258; and Calhoun, Works, III., 47.] and to range\r\nhimself permanently with the anti-tariff sentiment of his section.\r\n\r\nHardly had the woolens bill met its fate when the rival forces began\r\nto reorganize for another struggle. From the south and from the\r\nshipping interests of New England came memorials in opposition to\r\nthe tariff and in support of the theory of free-trade. [Footnote:\r\nAm. State Papers, Finance, V. passim.] At a convention which met in\r\nHarrisburg, Pennsylvania, July 30, 1827, a hundred delegates from\r\nthirteen states met to promote the cause of protection. Finding it\r\nnecessary to combine the various interests, the convention\r\nrecommended increased duties both upon wool and woolen goods, and\r\nthe establishment of the minimum system. This combination was made\r\npossible by the proposal of effectively counterbalancing the\r\nprohibitory duties on wool by such use of the minimum device as\r\nwould give a practical monopoly of the American market to the\r\ndomestic manufacturers in the class of goods in which they were most\r\ninterested. To conciliate other sections, the convention adopted the\r\nplan of an additional duty on hammered bar-iron, hemp and flax, and\r\nvarious other products. [Footnote: Stanwood, Tariff Controversies,\r\nI., 264; Niles' Register, XXXII., 369, 386, XXXIII., 187; Elliott,\r\nTariff Controversy, 239.]\r\n\r\nWhen the twentieth Congress met, in December, 1827, Stevenson, of\r\nVirginia, defeated the administration candidate, Taylor, of New\r\nYork, for the speakership, and both branches of Congress and the\r\nimportant committees were put in the hands of the opposition to\r\nAdams. Rejecting the plan of the Harrisburg Convention, the House\r\ncommittee brought in a bill framed to satisfy the producers of raw\r\nmaterial, wool, hemp, flax, and iron, and to deny the protection\r\ndesired by New England. [Footnote: Taussig, Tariff Hist., 89-92;\r\nDewey, Financial Hist. of the U.S., 178-181.] Protection was\r\nafforded to raw material even where the producers did not seek it;\r\nand in some important cases high duties were imposed on raw material\r\nnot produced in this country. The essential point of the provision\r\nrespecting woolens favored by the Harrisburg Convention was the\r\nfixing of four minimum points, but the committee on manufactures\r\ninterposed between the minimum of 50 cents and that of $2.50 a\r\nminimum of $1, which effectively withdrew protection from the woolen\r\ngoods most largely manufactured in New England. Moreover, the\r\ncommittee refused to establish the increasing rate of duty asked for\r\nat Harrisburg.\r\n\r\nCalhoun afterwards explained the attitude of the southern\r\nrepresentatives as follows: [Footnote: Calhoun, Works, III., 49; cf.\r\nHouston, Nullification in S. C., 34, for similar explanations by\r\nMitchell and McDuffie; Clay, Works (Colton's ed.), II., 13; Jenkins,\r\nWright, 53.] Having before them the option of joining New England in\r\nsecuring amendments satisfactory to the section, or, by resisting\r\nall amendment, to force New England to join with the south in\r\nrejecting the bill, which would involve Adams in the responsibility\r\nfor its defeat, they chose the latter alternative. Assurances were\r\ngiven them by Jackson men that the two tariff interests would not be\r\nunited by mutual concession in the last stages of the discussion to\r\ninsure the passage of the bill; and so the south consistently threw\r\nits weight against the passage of amendments modifying this\r\ndesignedly high tariff. \"We determined,\" said McDuffie later, \"to\r\nput such ingredients in the chalice as would poison the monster, and\r\ncommend it to his own lips.\" At the same time the Jackson men in\r\nPennsylvania, New York, and the west shifted their votes so as to\r\ndeprive New England of her share in the protective system. When an\r\namendment was proposed, striking out the duty on molasses--an\r\narticle essential to the rum distilleries of New England, but\r\nobnoxious to the distillers of whiskey in Pennsylvania and the west-\r\n-Pennsylvania and a large share of the delegation from Ohio, New\r\nYork, Indiana, and Kentucky voted with most of the south against the\r\namendment. On the motion to substitute the proposals of the\r\nHarrisburg Convention with respect to wool and woolens, almost all\r\nof the delegation of Pennsylvania, and a large portion of that of\r\nNew York and Kentucky, as well as the members from Indiana and\r\nMissouri and the south, opposed the proposition. Thus the interests\r\nof the seaboard protectionists were overcome by the alliance between\r\nthe middle states and the south, while the west was divided.\r\n\r\nBitter as was the pill, it was swallowed by enough of the eastern\r\nprotectionists to carry the act. The vote, 105 to 94, by which the\r\nmeasure passed in the House [Footnote: See map.] (April 22, 1828)\r\nshowed all of the south in opposition, with the exception of certain\r\ndistricts in Maryland and the western districts of Virginia, while\r\nthe great area of the states of the Ohio Valley and the middle\r\nregion was almost a unit in favor. The lower counties of New York\r\nalong the Hudson revealed their identity with the commercial\r\ninterests by opposing the bill. New England broke in two; Vermont,\r\nNew Hampshire, and Connecticut voted almost unanimously in favor of\r\nthe proposition; while Maine cast a unanimous vote in opposition.\r\nRhode Island was divided, and in Massachusetts only two districts--\r\nthat of the Berkshire wool-growing region and the Essex county area-\r\n-supported the bill.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, an amendment was passed making the duty on woolens an\r\nad valorem rate of forty-five per cent., but retaining the minima.\r\nVarious considerations induced some New England friends of Adams to\r\nsupport the measure. Webster defended his action in voting for the\r\nbill by declaring that New England had accepted the protective\r\nsystem as the established policy of the government, and after 1824\r\nhad built up her manufacturing enterprises on that basis.\r\nNevertheless, in the final vote in the Senate, the five northern\r\nmembers who opposed were all from New England.\r\n\r\nThus the \"tariff of abominations,\" shaped by the south for defeat,\r\nsatisfactory to but a fraction of the protectionists, was passed by\r\na vote of 26 to 21 in the Senate, May 13, 1828, and was concurred in\r\nby the House. John Randolph did not greatly overstate the case when\r\nhe declared that \"the bill referred to manufactures of no sort or\r\nkind, but the manufacture of a President of the United States\"; for,\r\non the whole, the friends of Jackson had, on this issue, taken sides\r\nagainst the friends of Adams, and in the effort to make the latter\r\nunpopular had produced a tariff which better illustrated sectional\r\njealousies and political intrigues than the economic policy of the\r\nnation. [Footnote: Register of Debates, 20 Cong., I Sess., IV., pt.\r\nii., 2472; Niles' Register, XXV., 55-57, analyzes the votes to show\r\nthe political groupings; cf. Taussig, Tariff History, 101, 102.]\r\n\r\nThe tariff agitation of 1827 and the passage of the act of 1828\r\ninflamed the south to the point of conflagration. John Randolph's\r\nelevation of the standard of revolt in 1824 now brought him credit\r\nas the prophet of the gospel of resistance. \"Here is a district of\r\ncountry,\" he had proclaimed, in his speech on the tariff in that\r\nyear, \"extending from the Patapsco to the Gulf of Mexico, from the\r\nAllegheny to the Atlantic; a district... which RAISES FIVE-SIXTHS of\r\nall the exports of this country that are OF HOME GROWTH.... I bless\r\nGod that in this insulted, oppressed and outraged region, we are as\r\nto our counsels in regard to this measure, but as one man. We are\r\nproscribed and put to the ban; and if we do not feel, and feeling,\r\ndo not act, we are bastards to those fathers who achieved the\r\nRevolution.\" [Footnote: Annals of Cong., 18 Cong., I Sess., II.,\r\n2360.]\r\n\r\nIt was South Carolina, rather than Virginia, however, that led in\r\nviolent proposals. [Footnote: Houston, Nullification in S. C.] Dr.\r\nCooper, an Englishman, president of South Carolina College, had long\r\nbeen engaged in propagating the Manchester doctrines of laissez-\r\nfaire and free-trade, and he was greeted with applause when he\r\ndeclared that the time had come to calculate the value of the Union.\r\n[Footnote: Niles' Register, XXXIII., 59+] Agricultural societies met\r\nto protest and to threaten. Turnbull, an aggressive and violent\r\nwriter, in a stirring series of papers published in 1827, under the\r\ntitle of The Crisis, over the signature of Brutus, sounded the\r\ntocsin of resistance. He repudiated the moderation and nationalism\r\nof \"Messrs. Monroe and Calhoun,\" and stood squarely on the doctrine\r\nthat the only safety for the south was in the cultivation of\r\nsectionalism. \"In the Northern, Eastern, Middle, and Western\r\nStates,\" said he, \"the people have no fears whatever from the\r\nexercise of the implied powers of Congress on any subject; but it is\r\nin the SOUTH alone where uneasiness begins to manifest itself, and a\r\nsensitiveness prevails on the subject of consolidation.\" \"The more\r\nNATIONAL and the less FEDERAL the government becomes, the more\r\ncertainly will the interest of the great majority of the States be\r\npromoted, but with the same certainty, will the interests of the\r\nSOUTH be depressed and destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nOn their return from the session of 1828, the South Carolina\r\ndelegation added fuel to the fire. In a caucus of the members, held\r\nshortly after the passage of the tariff, proposals were even made\r\nfor the delegation to vacate their seats in Congress as a protest,\r\nand in this temper they returned to their state. [Footnote: Niles'\r\nRegister, XXXV., 184, 202.] McDuffie told his constituents that\r\nthere was no hope of a change of the system in Congress; that the\r\nsouthern states, by the law of self-preservation, were free to save\r\nthemselves from utter ruin; and that the government formed for their\r\nprotection and benefit was determined to push every matter to their\r\nannihilation. He recommended that the state should levy a tax on the\r\nconsumption of northern manufactured goods, boycott the live-stock\r\nof Kentucky, and wear homespun; and he closed by drawing a\r\ncomparison between the wrongs suffered by the colonists when they\r\nrevolted from Great Britain and that by which the south was now\r\noppressed. [Footnote: Niles' Register, XXXIII., 339; cf. ibid.,\r\nXXXV., 82, 131.]\r\n\r\nAlthough South Carolina and all of the staple-producing section\r\nexcept Louisiana and Kentucky were in substantial agreement upon the\r\niniquity of the tariff, yet, in respect to the remedy, they were\r\nwidely at variance. Protest had proven ineffective; proposals of\r\nresistance by force, plans for a southern convention, and threats of\r\ndisunion were rife. [Footnote: Houston, Nullification in S.C., 49-\r\n52, 73-75.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation which confronted Calhoun when he returned\r\nfrom Washington and found that his section had passed beyond him.\r\nThe same considerations that had aroused this storm of opposition\r\nalso had their effect upon him. But he was still hopeful that, by\r\nthe election of Jackson, a cotton-planter, the current of northern\r\npower might be checked; and he looked forward also to the prospect\r\nthat he himself might eventually reach the presidential chair.\r\nBefore him lay the double task of uniting himself to his friends in\r\nSouth Carolina, lest he lose touch with the forces of his own\r\nsection, and of framing a platform of opposition that should be\r\nconsistent, logical, and defensible; and, at the same time, of\r\nproviding some mode of avoiding the forcible revolution that the\r\nhotheads of his section threatened as an immediate programme.\r\n\r\nIt was by the very processes of western growth that the seaboard\r\nsouth now found itself a minority section and the home of\r\ndiscontent. As the rich virgin soil of the Gulf plains opened to\r\ncotton culture, the output leaped up by bounds. In 1811 the total\r\nproduct was eighty million pounds; in 1821 it was one hundred and\r\nseventy-seven millions; in 1826 it was three hundred and thirty\r\nmillions. Prices fell as production increased. In 1816 the average\r\nprice of middling uplands in New York was nearly thirty cents, and\r\nSouth Carolina's leaders favored the tariff; in 1820 it was\r\nseventeen cents, and the south saw in the protective system a\r\ngrievance; in 1824 it was fourteen and three-quarters cents, and the\r\nSouth-Carolinians denounced the tariff as unconstitutional. When the\r\nwoolens bill was agitated in 1827, cotton had fallen to but little\r\nmore than nine cents, and the radicals of the section threatened\r\ncivil war.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the price of slaves was increased by the demands of the\r\nnew cotton-fields of Alabama, Mississippi, and the rest of the\r\nsouthwest, so that the Carolina planter had to apply a larger\r\ncapital to his operations, while, at the same time, the cheap and\r\nunexhausted soil of these new states tended still further to hamper\r\nthe older cotton areas in their competition, and the means of\r\ntransportation from the western cotton-fields were better than from\r\nthose of South Carolina. By devoting almost exclusive attention to\r\nher great staple, South Carolina had made herself dependent on the\r\ngrain and live-stock of the west and the manufactures of the north\r\nor of England; and, when the one crop from which she derived her\r\nmeans of purchasing declined in value, the state was plunged in\r\nunrelieved distress. Nevertheless, the planters of the old south saw\r\nclearly but two of the causes of their distress: the tariff, which\r\nseemed to them to steal the profits of their crops; and internal\r\nimprovements, by which the proceeds of their indirect taxes were\r\nexpended in the west and north. Their indignation was also fanned to\r\na fiercer flame by apprehensions over the attitude of the north\r\ntowards slavery.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1828, Calhoun addressed himself to the statement of\r\nthese grievances and to the formulation of a remedy. After\r\nconsultation with leading men in his home at Fort Hill, he was ready\r\nto shape a document which, nominally a report of a legislative\r\ncommittee (since it was not expedient for the vice-president to\r\nappear in the matter), put in its first systematic form the doctrine\r\nof nullification. This so-called Exposition, [Footnote: Calhoun,\r\nWorks, VI., 1-59.] beginning with the unconstitutionality and\r\ninjustice of protection, developed the argument that the tax on\r\nimports, amounting to about twenty-three million dollars, fell, in\r\neffect, solely on the south, because the northern sections\r\nrecompensed themselves by the increased profits afforded to their\r\nproductions by protection; while the south, seeking in the markets\r\nof the world customers for its staples, and obliged to purchase\r\nmanufactures and supplies in return, was forced to pay tribute on\r\nthis exchange for the benefit of the north. \"To the growers of\r\ncotton, rice, and tobacco, it is the same whether the Government\r\ntakes one-third of what they raise, for the liberty of sending the\r\nother two-thirds abroad, or one-third of the iron, salt, sugar,\r\ncoffee, cloth and other articles they may need in exchange for the\r\nliberty of bringing them home.\"\r\n\r\nEstimating the annual average export of domestic produce at fifty-\r\nthree million dollars, the Exposition attributed to the planting\r\nsection at least thirty-seven million dollars--over two-thirds of\r\nthe total exports; the voting power of this section in the House of\r\nRepresentatives was but seventy-six, while the rest of the Union had\r\none hundred and thirty-seven members. Thus, one-third of the\r\npolitical Union exported more than two-thirds of the domestic\r\nproducts. Assuming imports to equal exports, and the tariff of 1828\r\nto average forty-five per cent., the south would pay sixteen million\r\nsix hundred and fifty thousand dollars as its share of contributions\r\nto the national treasury. Calhoun then presented the ominous\r\nsuggestion that, if the staple section had a separate custom-house,\r\nit would have for its own use a revenue of sixteen million six\r\nhundred and fifty thousand dollars from foreign trade alone, not\r\ncounting the imports from the north, which would bring in millions\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\"We are mere consumers,\" he declared, \"the serfs of the system--out\r\nof whose labor is raised, not only the money paid into the Treasury,\r\nbut the funds out of which are drawn the rich rewards of the\r\nmanufacturer and his associates in interest.\"\r\n\r\nTaking for granted that the price at which the south could afford to\r\ncultivate cotton was determined by the price at which it received\r\nits supplies, he argued that, if the crop could be produced at ten\r\ncents a pound, the removal of the duty would enable the planter to\r\nproduce it at five and one-half cents, and thus to drive out\r\ncompetition and to add three or four hundred thousand bales annually\r\nto the production, with a corresponding increase of profit. The\r\ncomplaints of the south were not yet exhausted, for the Exposition\r\nwent on to point out that, in the commercial warfare with Europe\r\nwhich protection might be expected to engender, the south would be\r\ndeprived of its market and might be forced to change its industrial\r\nlife and compete with the northern states in manufactures. The\r\nadvantages of the north would probably insure it an easy victory;\r\nbut if not, then an attack might be expected on the labor system of\r\nthe south, in behalf of the white workmen of the north.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the remedy? Calhoun found this, although in\r\nfragmentary form, ready to his hand. The reserved rights of the\r\nsovereign states had long been the theoretical basis of southern\r\nresistance. In the argumentation of such writers as Taylor,\r\nTurnbull, and Judge Roane, not to mention Madison and Jefferson in\r\nthe Virginia and Kentucky resolutions, there was material for the\r\nsystem; but as yet no one had stated with entire clearness the two\r\nfeatures which Calhoun made prominent in his Exposition. First, he\r\nmade use of reasoning in sharp contrast to that of the statesmen of\r\nthe days of the American Revolution, by rejecting the doctrine of\r\nthe division of sovereignty between the states and the general\r\ngovernment. [Footnote: McLaughlin, in Am. Hist. Rev., V., 482, 484.]\r\nClearly differentiating government from sovereignty, he limited the\r\napplication of the division to the powers of government, and\r\nattributed the sovereignty solely to the people of the several\r\nstates. This conception of the unity of sovereignty was combined\r\nwith the designation of the Constitution as articles of compact\r\nbetween sovereign states, each entitled to determine whether or not\r\nthe general government had usurped powers not granted by the\r\nConstitution, and each entitled peacefully to prevent the operation\r\nof the disputed law within its own limits, pending a decision by the\r\nsame power that could amend the Constitution--namely, three-fourths\r\nof the states.\r\n\r\nThese doctrines were brought out with definiteness and with the\r\ndeliberate intention of creating from them a practical governmental\r\nmachinery to be peacefully applied for the preservation of the\r\nrights of the states. In effect, therefore, Calhoun, the logician of\r\nnationalism in the legislation that followed the War of 1812, became\r\nthe real architect of the system of nullification as a plan of\r\naction rather than a protest. As it left his hands, the system was\r\nessentially a new creation. In the Exposition, the doctrine was\r\nsketched only in its larger lines, for it was in later documents\r\nthat he refined and elaborated it. It was intended as a substitute\r\nfor revolution and disunion--but it proved to be the basis on which\r\nwas afterwards developed the theory of peaceable secession. Calhoun\r\ndid not publicly avow his authorship or his adhesion to\r\nnullification until three years later.\r\n\r\nThe rallying of the party of the Union in South Carolina against\r\nthis doctrine, the refusal of Georgia, Virginia, and other southern\r\nstates to accept it as the true exposition of the Virginia and\r\nKentucky resolutions, the repudiation of it by the planting states\r\nof the southwest, all belong to the next volume of this series.\r\n\r\nYet the Exposition marks the culmination of the process of\r\ntransformation with which this volume has dealt. Beginning with\r\nnationalism, the period ends with sectionalism. Beginning with unity\r\nof party and with the almost complete ascendancy of republicanism of\r\nthe type of Monroe, it ends with sharply distinguished rival\r\nparties, as yet unnamed, but fully organized, and tending to differ\r\nfundamentally on the question of national powers. From the days when\r\nSouth-Carolinians led in legislation for tariff and internal\r\nimprovements, when Virginians promoted the Colonization Society, and\r\nGeorgians advocated the policy of mitigating the evils of slavery by\r\nscattering the slaves, we have reached the period when a united\r\nsouth protests against \"the American system,\" and the lower south\r\nasserts that slavery must not be touched--not even discussed.\r\n\r\nIn various southern states the minority counties of the coast,\r\nraising staples by slave labor, had protected their property\r\ninterests against the free majority of farmers in the interior\r\ncounties by so apportioning the legislature as to prevent action by\r\nthe majority. Now the same conditions existed for the nation. The\r\nfree majority embraced a great zone of states in the north and west;\r\nthe south, a minority section, was now seeking protection against\r\nthe majority of the Union by the device of state sovereignty; and\r\nCalhoun made himself the political philosopher of the rights of this\r\nminority section, applying to the nation the experience of South\r\nCarolina. [Footnote: Calhoun. Works, I., 400-405.]\r\n\r\nStill the great currents of national growth ran on. New England was\r\nachieving unity and national feeling as a manufacturing region, and\r\nWebster was developing those powers which were to make him the\r\norator of consolidation. While the leaders of the middle states\r\nplayed the game of personal politics, their people and those of the\r\ngrowing west were rallying around the man who personified their\r\npassion for democracy and nationalism--the fiery Jackson, who\r\nconfused sectional opposition to the government with personal\r\nhostility to himself. This frontiersman was little likely to allow\r\npolitical metaphysics, or even sectional suffering, to check his\r\nwill. And on the frontier of the northwest, the young Lincoln sank\r\nhis axe deep in the opposing forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nCRITICAL ESSAY ON AUTHORITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL AIDS\r\n\r\nThe authorities characterized in the Critical Essays of Babcock's\r\nRise of American Nationality, MacDonald's Jacksonian Democracy, and\r\nHart's Slavery and Abolition (American Nation, XIII., XV., XVI.),\r\ninclude most of the general authorities, and need not be repeated\r\nhere in detail.

The volumes of the American Statesmen series\r\nare accurate and well written, especially Morse's John Quincy Adams,\r\nSchurz's Henry Clay, Adams's John Randolph, Roosevelt's Thomas H.\r\nBenton, McLaughlin's Lewis Cass, Shepard's Van Buren. SECTIONAL\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\nAmong the bibliographies useful for attacking the mass of local and\r\nstate histories for this period are the following: R.R. Bowker,\r\nState Publications (New York, 1899, 1902, 1905); A.P.C. Griffin,\r\nBibliography of Historical Societies of the United States (American\r\nHistorical Association, Reports, 1890, 1892, 1893).\r\n\r\nNEW ENGLAND.--The history of this section, since the Revolution, has\r\nbeen neglected, but indications of its importance appear in Justin\r\nWinsor, Memorial History of Boston (4 vols., 1880-1882), III., IV.,\r\nand I.B. Richman, Rhode Island: a Study in Separatism (1905). M.\r\nLouise Greene, The Development of Religious Liberty in Connecticut\r\n(1905), deals with the toleration movement. The various historical\r\nsocieties print documentary material; but, for the most part, New\r\nEngland's activity in this decade must be sought in original\r\nmaterial, biographies, travels, scattered monographs, and, in\r\nfragments, in state histories.\r\n\r\nMIDDLE STATES.--The state and local histories of the middle region\r\nare more satisfactory on this period, but the political life must be\r\nsought chiefly in biographies; and the economic and social\r\nconditions in the scattered material elsewhere cited in this\r\nbibliography. J.G. Wilson, Memorial History of the City of New York\r\n(4 vols., 1891-1893); and Scharf and Westcott, History of\r\nPhiladelphia (3 vols., 1884), are serviceable accounts of the\r\ndevelopment of the great cities of the section.\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH.--Virginia has been neglected in this period, but the\r\ntravelers afford interesting material; and a good view of plantation\r\nlife is T.C. Johnson, Life and Letters of Robert Lewis Dabney\r\n(1903). For North Carolina, the literature is cited in S.B. Weeks,\r\nBibliography of the Historical Literature of North Carolina (1895).\r\nTwo monographs by J.S. Bassett, Anti-Slavery Leaders of North\r\nCarolina (Johns Hopkins University Studies, XVI., No. 6), and\r\nHistory of Slavery in North Carolina (ibid., XVII., Nos. 7, 8), are\r\nespecially important for the up-country. W.E. Dodd, Life of\r\nNathaniel Macon (1903), is useful on this period. South Carolina\r\nconditions are shown in R. Mills, Statistics of South Carolina\r\n(1826); and W.A. Schaper, Sectionalism and Representation in South\r\nCarolina (American Historical Association, Report, 1900, I.).\r\nGeorgia is depicted in U.B. Phillips, Georgia and State Rights\r\n(ibid., 1901, II.); [G.R. Gilmer], Sketches of Some of the First\r\nSettlers of Upper Georgia (1855); and [A.B. Longstreet], Georgia\r\nScenes (last edition, 1897), the latter made up of rollicking\r\ncharacter-sketches. Among the many travelers useful (after\r\ncriticism) for the South and Southwest may be mentioned, the Duke of\r\nSaxe-Weimar, Murat, Paulding, Hodgson, and Mrs. Royall.\r\nCorrespondence illustrating Mississippi conditions is printed in\r\nJ.F.H. Claiborne, Life and Correspondence of John A. Quitman (2\r\nvols., 1860). Two lists by T.M. Owen, Bibliography of Alabama\r\n(American Historical Association, Report, 1897); and Bibliography of\r\nMississippi (ibid., 1889, I.), open a wealth of southwestern\r\nmaterial. For Louisiana, there are various popular histories of New\r\nOrleans; and A. Fortier, History of Louisiana (1904), III.; S.D.\r\nSmedes, Memorials of a Southern Planter [Thomas Dabney], (1887, also\r\n1890), is highly valuable in the developed opening of the Gulf area.\r\nOne of the best pictures of southwestern conditions is Lincecum's\r\n\"Autobiography\" (so called), in the Mississippi Historical Society,\r\nPublications, VIII. W.G. Brown, Lower South in American History\r\n(1902), is illuminative.\r\n\r\nTHE WEST.--The material for the West is scattered, the general\r\nhistories of the Mississippi Valley failing to deal extensively with\r\nsettlement. John B. McMaster, History of the People of the United\r\nStates (1883-1900), IV., chap, xxxiii., and V., chap, xlv., give\r\ngood accounts of the westward movement. B.A. Hinsdale, Old Northwest\r\n(2 vols., 1888, 1899), is scholarly, but brief on this period. W.H.\r\nVenable, Beginnings of Literary Culture in the Ohio Valley (1891),\r\nis important. Of especial value are the travelers, gazetteers, etc.,\r\namong which the following are exceptionally useful: Timothy Flint,\r\nRecollections of the Last Ten Years (1826); Timothy Flint, History\r\nand Geography of the Mississippi Valley (2 vols., 2d edition, 1832);\r\nfour books by J. Hall, viz.: Letters from the West (1828), Legends\r\nof the West (1833 and 1869), Notes on the Western States (1838),\r\nStatistics of the West (1836); Ohio Navigator (1821 and many other\r\neditions); J.M. Peck, Guide for Emigrants (1831); H.S. Tanner, View\r\nof the Valley of the Mississippi (1834). All of these, of course,\r\nmust be used critically.\r\n\r\nAmong the contemporaneous state histories, T. Ford, History of\r\nIllinois (1854); J. Reynolds, My Own Times (1854-1855, also 1879),\r\nthough unreliable in detail, have a value as material on pioneer\r\nconditions. The historical societies of the western states abound in\r\nold settlers' accounts. W.C. Howells, Recollections of Life in Ohio\r\n(1895), is a gem. P.G. Thomson, Bibliography of Ohio (1880), is the\r\nkey to an extensive literature. There is no good history of Kentucky\r\nin this period; but J. Phelan, History of Tennessee (1888), is\r\nexcellent. Lives of Clay, Jackson, and Benton all aid in\r\nunderstanding the region.\r\n\r\nTHE FAR WEST.--H.M. Chittenden, The American Fur Trade of the Far\r\nWest (3 vols., 1902), is excellent. The larger histories of the\r\nPacific states, viz.: H. . Bancroft, Works; Hittell, California; and\r\nLyman, Oregon, are characterized by Garrison, Westward Expansion\r\n(American Nation, XVII.). The publications of the Oregon Historical\r\nSociety and the Quarterly of the Texas Historical Society are\r\nextremely useful. D.G. Wooten [editor], Comprehensive History of\r\nTexas (2 vols., 1899), has material on settlement in this period.\r\nG.P. Garrison, Texas (1903), is an excellent little book. Brief\r\naccounts of exploration in this period are in E.C. Semple, American\r\nHistory and Its Geographic Conditions (1903); and R.G. Thwaites,\r\nRocky Mountain Exploration (1904). J. Schafer, History of the\r\nPacific Northwest (1905), and G.W. James, In and about the Old\r\nMissions of California (1905), are useful brief presentations of\r\nconditions on the coast. For all this field the H.H. Bancroft\r\nlibrary, now the property of the University of California, is the\r\ngreat collection of documentary material. Illustrative books by\r\ncontemporaries are: R.H. Dana, Two Years before the Mast (1849 and\r\nother editions), giving California life; W. Irving, Adventures of\r\nCaptain Bonneville (1849), giving Rocky Mountain life; and J. Gregg,\r\nCommerce of the Prairies; or, the Journal of a Santa Fe Trader (2\r\nvols., 1844, also in Thwaites, Early Western Travels, XIX., XX.).\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORIES OF PARTIES AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\nCharles McCarthy, The Antimasonic Party (American Historical\r\nAssociation, Report, 1902, I.), sets a high standard as a\r\nmonographic party history; C.H. Rammelkamp gives a detailed study of\r\nthe Campaign of 1824 in New York (in ibid., 1904, pp. 175-202); all\r\nof the biographies of the contemporary statesmen deal with the\r\nparties of this period; and J.D. Hammond, History of Political\r\nParties in the State of New York (2 vols., 1852), is a good history\r\nby a contemporary. U.B. Phillips, Georgia and State Rights (American\r\nHistorical Association, Report, 1901, II.), gives a modern treatment\r\nof state politics.\r\n\r\nOn political institutions the following are particularly useful:\r\nEdward Stanwood, History of the Presidency (1898); M. P. Pollett,\r\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives (1896); L. G.\r\nMcConachie, Congressional Committees (1898); C. R. Fish, The Civil\r\nService and the Patronage (Harvard Historical Studies, XI., 1905);\r\nF. W. Dallinger, Nominations for Elective Office in the United\r\nStates (ibid., IV., 1897); J. B. McMaster, Acquisition of Political,\r\nSocial, and Industrial Rights of Man in America (1903).\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nFor a list of records of debates, legislative journals, documents,\r\nstatutes, judicial decisions, treaties, and the like, see the\r\n\"Critical Essays\" in the neighboring volumes, and in Channing and\r\nHart, Guide, p. 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS OF AMERICAN STATESMEN\r\n\r\nTo the various editions of the works of James Monroe, Henry Clay,\r\nDaniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison,\r\nRufus King, described in other volumes of this series, may be added\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, Memoirs: Comprising Portions of His Diary from\r\n1795 to 1848 (edited by Charles Francis Adams, 12 vols., 1874-1877).\r\nThe diary is unusually full, and abounds in valuable material for\r\nunderstanding the politics of the period and the character of Adams.\r\nHe was biased and harsh in his judgment of contemporaries, but\r\nconscientious in his record. The Adams papers are now in the private\r\narchives of the family at Quincy.\r\n\r\nFor statesmen of lesser distinction, see W. W. Story, Life and\r\nLetters of Joseph Story (2 vols., 1851); L. G. Tyler, Letters and\r\nTimes of the Tylers (3 vols., 1884, also 1896). A collection of De\r\nWitt Clinton's letters was published in Harper's Magazine, L., 409,\r\n563, and other letters and papers are in the following: David\r\nHosack, Memoir of De Witt Clinton (1829); W. C. Campbell, Life and\r\nWritings of De Witt Clinton (1849); James Renwick, Life of De Witt\r\nClinton (1854). There is no collection of Crawford's works; he is\r\nsaid to have destroyed his papers; a few letters remain, some of\r\nthem in the possession of Dr. U. B. Phillips (University of\r\nWisconsin). In E. B. Washburne [editor], Edwards Papers (1884), and\r\nN. W. Edwards, History of Illinois and Life and Times of Ninian\r\nEdwards (1870), are important letters illustrating national as well\r\nas western politics; see also the letters of Senator Mills of\r\nMassachusetts, in Massachusetts Historical Society, Proceedings, 1st\r\nseries, XIX., 12-53; and those of Marshall, Kent, Story, and\r\nWebster, in ibid., 26. series, XIV., 320 et seq., 398, 412 et seq. A\r\ncollection of Macon's letters in this decade is in North Carolina\r\nUniversity, James Sprunt Historical Monographs, No. 2. Literary men\r\nand journalists are described by Herbert B. Adams, Life and Writings\r\nof Jared Sparks (2 vols., 1893); John Binns, Recollections of His\r\nLife, Written by Himself (1854); Amos Kendall, Autobiography (edited\r\nby W. Stickney, 1872), valuable for Dartmouth College life and for\r\nKentucky in this period; Thurlow Weed, Autobiography (1883), useful\r\nalso for western New York; E. S. Thomas, Reminiscences of the Last\r\nSixty-five Years (2 vols., 1840), editor in Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, and in Cincinnati; William Winston Seaton of the National\r\nIntelligencer: a Biographical Sketch (1871), contains useful letters\r\nby various persons from Washington; The John P. Branch Historical\r\nPapers of Randolph--Macon College, Nos. 2 and 3 (1902, 1903),\r\ncontain some letters and a biography of Thomas Ritchie, editor of\r\nthe Richmond Enquirer.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOBIOGRAPHIES\r\n\r\nIn the group of autobiographies, reminiscences, etc., Thomas H.\r\nBenton, Thirty Years' View; or, A History of the Working of the\r\nAmerican Government, 1820--1850 (2 vols., 1854), is the most\r\nimportant: as a member of the Senate, Benton was active and\r\ninfluential, and, despite his positive character, he aims at\r\nfairness; Nathan Sargent, Public Men and Events [1817-1853], (2\r\nvols., 1875), is made up of chatty sketches, with an anti-Jackson\r\nbias; Josiah Quincy, Figures of the Past (1901), pen-pictures of men\r\nof the period; B. F. Perry, Reminiscences of Public Men (two series:\r\n1st, 1883; 2d, 1889), anecdotal views of South Carolinians; S. G.\r\nGoodrich, Recollections of a Lifetime; or, Men and Things I Have\r\nSeen (2 vols., 1886).\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS\r\n\r\nManuscript collections are located in the reports of the Historical\r\nManuscripts Commission, published by the American Historical\r\nAssociation in its annual Reports; and in Justin Winsor, Narrative\r\nand Critical History of America, VIII. (1889). The Library of\r\nCongress contains important manuscripts of Madison (calendared in\r\nBureau of Rolls and Library, Department of State, Bulletin, IV.); of\r\nJefferson (ibid., VI., VIII., X.); Monroe (indexed in ibid., II.),\r\nand in W. C. Ford [editor], Papers of James Monroe (1904); indexes\r\nof the manuscripts of Jackson and Van Buren are in progress. In the\r\nNew York Public Library are collections of correspondence of various\r\nstatesmen of the period (New York Public Library, Bulletin, V., 306\r\net seq.), including Monroe (calendared in ibid., V., 316, VII., 210,\r\n247-257); Jackson (ibid., IV., 154-162, 188-198, 292-320, V., 316);\r\nCalhoun (ibid., III., 324-333); James Barbour (ibid., V., 316, VI.,\r\n22-34). The Clinton Papers are in the State Library at Albany, N. Y.\r\n(American Historical Association, Report, 1898, p. 578). The papers\r\nof Senator Mahlon Dickerson, of New Jersey, including letters from\r\nimportant statesmen of the period, are in the possession of William.\r\nNelson, corresponding secretary of the New Jersey Historical\r\nSociety. The correspondence of Senator W. P. Mangum, of North\r\nCarolina, including letters from Clay, Webster, etc., is in the\r\npossession of Dr. S. B. Weeks, San Carlos, Arizona. The papers of\r\nVice-President Tompkins in the State Library at Albany are described\r\nin Albany Institute, Transactions, XI., 223-240. The Plumer papers\r\nare in the New Hampshire Historical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERIODICALS\r\n\r\nThe newspapers and periodicals constitute indispensable sources. For\r\nthe former the following catalogues are useful: Check List of\r\nAmerican Newspapers in the Library of Congress (1901); Wisconsin\r\nHistorical Society, Annotated Catalogue of Newspaper Files (1899);\r\nW. F. Poole [editor], Index to Periodical Literature (1853 and later\r\neditions), renders the magazines of the period accessible; and W. B.\r\nCairns, Development of American Literature from 1815 to 1833, with\r\nespecial Reference to Periodicals, in University of Wisconsin,\r\nBulletin (Literature Series, I., 1898), enumerates a list of\r\nperiodicals not indexed in Poole. Easily first in importance among\r\nthe periodicals useful on the period from 1819 to 1829 is Niles'\r\nWeekly Register, edited by Hezekiah Niles (76 vols., 1811-1849),\r\nwhich abounds in material, political, social, and economic; although\r\nNiles was a strong protectionist, he was also fair-minded and\r\nconscientious in collecting information. The North American Review\r\n(Boston, begun in 1815 and still continues); The American Quarterly\r\nReview (Philadelphia, 1827-1837); The Southern Review (Charleston,\r\n1828-1832); The American Annual Register (New York, 1825-1833). The\r\nQuarterly Register and Journal of the American Education Society\r\n(1829-1843); The Methodist Magazine (1818-1840); The Christian\r\nExaminer (Boston, 1824-1869); and Christian Monthly Spectator (1819-\r\n1828), are examples of religious and educational publications. Among\r\nperiodicals which contain articles dealing with the decade, although\r\npublished later, are The Democratic Review, of which the first\r\nnumber appeared in 1837; Hunt's Merchants' Magazine and Commercial\r\nReview (first volume, 1839); and D. B. De Bow's Commercial Review of\r\nthe South and West (first volume, 1846). Among the short-lived\r\nmagazines of the West are: The Western Review (Lexington, 1820-\r\n1821); The Western Monthly Review (edited by Timothy Flint,\r\nCincinnati, 1827-1830); The Illinois Monthly Magazine (edited by\r\nJames Hall, 1830-1831); The Western Monthly Magazine (continuation\r\nof the former, Cincinnati, 1833-1837).\r\n\r\n\r\nGAZETTEERS AND GUIDES\r\n\r\nAmong the important sources for understanding the growth of the\r\ncountry are various descriptions, gazetters, etc. Of the many books\r\nof this class may be mentioned the following: Emigrants' Guide; or,\r\nPocket Geography of the Western States and Territories (Cincinnati,\r\n1818); William Amphlett, Emigrants' Directory of the Western States\r\nof North America (London, 1819); D.

Warden,\r\nStatistical, Political, and Historical Account of the United States\r\nof North America (3 vols., Edinburgh, 1819.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAVELS\r\n\r\nThe life of this period is illustrated by the reports of travelers;\r\nbut the reader must remember that the traveller carries his\r\nprejudices, is prone to find in striking exceptions the\r\ncharacteristics of a region, and is exposed to misinformation by the\r\nnatives; many of these travelers are, nevertheless, keen observers,\r\nwell worth attention, and, when checked by comparison with others,\r\nthey are a useful source. A full list of the travels bearing on the\r\nWest and South from 1819 to 1829 would take more space than can be\r\nallotted here. Bibliographies of travels in the United States may be\r\nfound in Justin Winsor, Narrative and Critical History of America\r\n(1884-1889), VIII., 493; Channing and Hart, Guide to American\r\nHistory (1896), p. 24; W. B. Bryan, Bibliography of the District of\r\nColumbia (1900), Article \"America\" (Senate Document, 56 Cong., 1\r\nSess., No. 61); P. G. Thomson, Bibliography of Ohio (1880); R. G.\r\nThwaites, On the Storied Ohio (1897), App.; H. T. Tuckerman, America\r\nand Her Commentators (1864); B.C. Steiner, Descriptions of Maryland\r\n(Johns Hopkins University Studies, XXII., No. 6.), 608-647. The most\r\nimportant collection of travels is R. G. Thwaites [editor], Early\r\nWestern Travels (1748-1846), to be completed in thirty volumes and\r\nan analytical index. For an estimate of English travellers, see J.\r\nB. McMaster, United States, V., chap, xlviii. A list of travels in\r\nthe period 1820-1860 will be found in Albert Bushnell Hart, Slavery\r\nand Abolition (American Nation, XVI.), chap. xxii.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVERY, COTTON, AND THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE\r\n\r\nFor works on slavery, see Hart, Slavery and Abolition (American\r\nNation, XVI.), chap. xxii. The general histories, such as W. H.\r\nSmith, Political History of Slavery (1903), and G. W. Williams,\r\nHistory of the Negro Race in America (2 vols., 1883), leave much to\r\nbe desired. Among the most important references are the Reports of\r\nthe American Colonization Society; J. H. T. McPherson, History of\r\nLiberia (Johns Hopkins University Studies, IX., No. 10.); John S.\r\nBassett, Anti-Slavery Leaders of North Carolina (ibid., XVI., No.\r\n6); and Slavery in the State of North Carolina (ibid., XVII., Nos.\r\n7, 8); H.

Harris, The History of Negro\r\nServitude in Illinois (1904); E. B. Washburne, Sketch of Edward\r\nColes, Second Governor of Illinois, and of the Slavery Struggle of\r\n1823-4 (1882). The economic history of slavery can be written only\r\nafter much monographic work; compare U. B. Phillips, \"Economic Cost\r\nof Slave-Holding in the Cotton Belt,\" in Political Science\r\nQuarterly, XX., 267.\r\n\r\nOn the history of cotton, see M. B. Hammond, Cotton Industry, in\r\nAmerican Economic Association, Publications, new series, No. 1\r\n(1897); E. Von Halle, Baumwollproduktion (in Schmoller, Staats und\r\nSocial-wissenschaftliche Forschungen, XV.); E. G. Donnell, History\r\nof Cotton (1872); J. L. Watkins, Production and Price of Cotton for\r\nOne Hundred Years (U. S. Department of Agriculture, Division of\r\nStatistics, Miscellaneous Series, Bulletin, No. 9, 1895).\r\n\r\nThe best sketch of the Missouri Compromise is J. A. Woodburn, The\r\nHistorical Significance of the Missouri Compromise (American\r\nHistorical Association, Report, 1893, pp. 249-298). Source material\r\nis in the Annals of Congress; the works of King, Jefferson, Benton,\r\nand J. Q. Adams, above-mentioned; and also Congressional Globe, 30\r\nCong., 2 Sess., App.; William and Mary College Quarterly, X.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE SOVEREIGNTY\r\n\r\nOn the reaction towards state sovereignty, documentary material so\r\nwell selected as to have the effect of a monograph is in H. V. Ames,\r\nState Documents on Federal Relations (1900-1905), Nos. 3-5. The\r\nworks of John Taylor of Caroline are essential, especially\r\nConstruction Construed (1820), Tyranny Unmasked (1822), and New\r\nViews of the Constitution of the United States (1823); Brutus [R.\r\nTurnbull], The Crisis; or, Essays on the Usurpations of the Federal\r\nGovernment (1827), is equally important. Defense of a Liberal\r\nConstruction of the Powers of Congress as regards Internal\r\nImprovements, etc., with a Complete Refutation of the Ultra\r\nDoctrines Respecting Consolidation and State Sovereignty, Written by\r\nGeorge M'Duffle, Esq., in the Year 1821 over the Signature \"One of\r\nthe People\" (1831), is an important pamphlet to mark the extent of\r\nthe changing views of southern leaders. Judge Spencer Roane's\r\nantagonism to Marshall's nationalizing decisions is brought out in\r\nhis articles in Randolph-Macon College, John P. Branch Historical\r\nPapers, No. 2; see also Jefferson, Writings (Ford's edition), X.;\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society, Proceedings, ad series, XIV., 327\r\n(Marshall's strictures on Roane); and the case of Cohens vs.\r\nVirginia, in 6 Wheaton, 264. Calhoun's \"Exposition of 1828\" is in\r\nhis Works, VI., 1-59. Governor Troup's defiance of the United States\r\nis best given in E. J. Harden, Life of George M. Troup (1859),\r\ncontaining many of his letters. T. Cooper, Consolidation, an Account\r\nof Parties (2d edition, 1830, and in Examiner, II., 86, 100), is a\r\nSouth Carolina view. The best monographs in this field are David F.\r\nHouston, A Critical Study of Nullification in South Carolina\r\n(Harvard Historical Studies, III., 1893), and U. B. Phillips,\r\nGeorgia and State Rights (American Historical Association, Report,\r\n1901, II.).\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC AND SOCIAL TOPICS\r\n\r\nCommerce and Trade.-For this period, the best commercial\r\nauthorities, aside from government documents, are Timothy Pitkin, A\r\nStatistical View of the Commerce of the United States of America\r\n(1835), and W. P. Sterns, Foreign Trade of the United States, 1820-\r\n1840, in Journal of Political Economy, VIII., 34, 452.

Wells, Our Merchant Marine: How It Rose,\r\nIncreased, Became Great, Declined, and Decayed (1882). In these\r\nworks there is a tendency to controversy.\r\n\r\nFinance.--The best manual on the financial history of the period is\r\nDavis R. Dewey, Financial History of the United States (1903), clear\r\nand judicious, with full bibliography. The best accounts of banking\r\nare: R. C. H. Catterall, The Second Bank of the United States\r\n(University of Chicago, Decennial Publications, 2d series, II.,\r\n1903); W. G.

Wright, The\r\nIndustrial Evolution of the United States (1895).\r\n\r\nLand.--On the land question, the American State Papers, Public\r\nLands, are the main reliance. See also Thomas Donaldson, The Public\r\nDomain: Its History, with Statistics (Washington, 1884; also in\r\nHouse Miscellaneous Documents, 47 Cong., 2 Sess., XIX., 1882-1883);\r\nEmerick, The Credit System and the Public Domain (Vanderbilt\r\nSouthern History Society, Publications, No. 3, 1899). The actual\r\noperation of the land system may be studied in the emigrant guides\r\nand works of travelers previously cited.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\nGeneral Views.--Upon the internal improvements of the United States\r\nnote the following: [G. Armroyd], Connected View of the Whole\r\nInternal Navigation of the United States (Philadelphia, 1826; 2d\r\nedition, 1830); G. T. Poussin, Travaux d'ameliorations interieurs\r\ndes Etats-Unis de 1824 a 1831 (Paris, 1836); S. A. Mitchell,\r\nCompendium of the Internal Improvements of the United States\r\n(Philadelphia, 1835); Michel Chevalier, Society, Manners, and\r\nPolitics in the United States (Boston, 1839); D. Hewett, The\r\nAmerican Traveller; or, National Directory Containing an Account of\r\nall the Great Post-Roads and Most Important Cross-Roads in the\r\nUnited States (Washington, 1825). The best estimate of the\r\nsignificance of internal improvements in this period is G. S.\r\nCallender, \"Early Transportation and Banking Enterprises of the\r\nStates in Relation to the Growth of Corporations,\" in Quarterly\r\nJournal of Economics, XVII., 3-54. A useful history of federal\r\ninternal improvement legislation is H. G. Wheeler, History of\r\nCongress (1848), II., 109-513. J. L. Ringwalt, Development of\r\nTransportation Systems in the United States (1888), a summary but\r\nvaluable account; H. V. Poor, Sketch of the Rise and Progress of\r\nInternal Improvements, in his Manual of the Railroads of the United\r\nStates for 1881.\r\n\r\nOfficial Publications.--Especially significant are: Niles' Register,\r\nXXXVI., 168, a statement of the amount of money expended in each\r\nstate and territory upon works of internal improvement to October 1,\r\n1828; J. C. Calhoun's report on carrying out the general survey act\r\nof 1824, in his Works, V., 137-147; the historical survey of the\r\ncanals of the United States, Census of the United States, 1880, IV.\r\nIn the American State Papers, Post-Office, 120, is the Report of the\r\nPostmaster-General, January, 1825, giving post routes, frequency of\r\nmails, and cost of transportation. See, for statistical data on\r\ninternal improvements, River and Harbor Legislation from 1790 to\r\n1887 (Senate Miscellaneous Documents, 49 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 91);\r\nand Secretary of the Interior, Statement Showing Land Grants Made by\r\nCongress to Aid in the Construction of Railroads, Wagon Roads,\r\nCanals, and Internal Improvements,. . . from Records of the General\r\nLand Office (1888).\r\n\r\nConstitutional Aspects.--For this side of the question, see Joseph\r\nStory, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States (2\r\nvols., 5th edition, 1891); James Monroe. View of the Conduct of the\r\nExecutive in Foreign Affairs of United States, in his Writings, VI.,\r\n216-284, and in J. D. Richardson, Messages and Public Papers of the\r\nPresidents, II., 144-183 (1899); E. C. Nelson, \"Presidential\r\nInfluence on the Policy of Internal Improvements,\" in Iowa Journal\r\nof History and Politics, IV., 3-69.\r\n\r\nSpecial Monographs.--Among the more useful are R. Mills, Treatise on\r\nInland Navigation (1820); G. W. Ward, The Early Development of the\r\nChesapeake and Ohio Canal Project (Johns Hopkins University Studies,\r\nXVII., 431, 1899); C. C. Weaver, History of Internal Improvements in\r\nNorth Carolina Previous to 1860 (ibid., XXI., 1903); E. J. Benton,\r\nThe Wabash Trade Route, in the Development of the Old Northwest\r\n(ibid., XXI., 1903); J. S. Young, Political and Constitutional Study\r\nof the Cumberland Road (University of Chicago Press, 1904), is badly\r\narranged, but useful; T. B. Searight, Old Pike (Uniontown, Pa.,\r\n1894), entertaining; T. K. Worthington, Historical Sketch of\r\nFinances of Pennsylvania, in American Economic Association,\r\nPublications, II., 126, gives a good sketch of the internal\r\nimprovements of that state; C. McCarthy, Antimasonic Party, in\r\nAmerican Historical Association, Report, 1902, chaps, viii.-x.,\r\nshows the political influence of canal schemes in Pennsylvania. For\r\nOhio internal improvements, see C. N. Morris, Internal Improvements\r\nin Ohio, in American Historical Association, Papers, III., 107\r\n(1889); G. W. Dial, in Ohio Archeological and Historical Society,\r\nPublications, XIII., 479; C. P. McClelland and C. C. Huntington,\r\nHistory of the Ohio Canals; A. B. Hulbert, Historic Highways of\r\nAmerica (16 vols., 1902-1905), including IX., Waterways of Westward\r\nExpansion; X., The Ohio River and Its Tributaries; XI., The\r\nCumberland Road; XII., Pioneer Roads and Experiences of Travellers;\r\nXIII., XIV., Great American Canals [Chesapeake and Ohio,\r\nPennsylvania, and Erie], useful, but not well digested.\r\n\r\nThe best sources for the Erie Canal are Laws of the State of New\r\nYork, in Relation to the Erie and Champlain Canals, together with\r\nthe Annual Reports of the Canal Commissioners (Albany, 1825), and\r\nthe succeeding Reports of the Canal Commissioners; View of the Grand\r\nCanal (pamphlet, Albany, 1825); and the biographies of Clinton by\r\nHosack and Renwick above mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\r\n\r\nOn foreign relations, especially the Monroe Doctrine, see C.\r\nSeignobos, Political History of Europe since 1814 (1899), 762, for\r\nbibliography of the Holy Alliance. The following serve to elucidate\r\nBritish policy: H. W. V. Temperley, Life of Canning (1905); A. G.\r\nStapleton, Political Life of the Right-Honourable George Canning (3\r\nvols., 1831); E. J. Stapleton, Some Official Correspondence of\r\nGeorge Canning (3 vols., 1887); Festing, J. H. Frere and His\r\nFriends; Memoirs and Correspondence of Viscount Castkreagh (8 vols.,\r\n1848-1851), VII.; and Richard Rush, Memoranda of a Residence at the\r\nCourt of London [1817-1819], (2d edition, 1833), and Memoranda of a\r\nResidence at the Court of London. . . from 1819 to 1825 (1845). For\r\nSpanish America, see F. L. Paxson, Independence of the South\r\nAmerican Republics (1903), an excellent sketch, with bibliography;\r\nJ. H. Latane, Diplomatic Relations of the United States and Spanish\r\nAmerica (1900); J. M. Callahan, Cuba and International Relations\r\n(1899). On the genesis of Monroe's message announcing the Doctrine,\r\nthe best survey is in the two articles by Worthington C. Ford, John\r\nQuincy Adams: His Connection with the Monroe Doctrine, in\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society, Proceedings, 2d series, XV.\r\n(1902), 373-436, and in American Historical Review, VII., 676-696,\r\nand VIII., 28-52. W. F. Reddaway, The Monroe Doctrine (1898; 2d\r\nedition, 1906), is a particularly lucid and valuable study. Albert\r\nBushnell Hart, Foundations of American Foreign Policy (1901), chap.\r\nvii.; John B. Moore, in Harper's Magazine, CIX., 857; G. Tucker,\r\nMonroe Doctrine (Boston, 1885); and D. C. Gilman, James Monroe\r\n(Boston, 1883), are other useful brief accounts. See also Frances\r\nWharton [editor], Digest of the International Law of the United\r\nStates (3 vols., 1887), I., superseded by John B. Moore, Digest (5\r\nvols., 1906).\r\n\r\nOn the Panama Congress, considerable material is collected in The\r\nCongress of 1826 at Panama (International American Conference, IV.,\r\nHistorical Appendix, 1890).",
