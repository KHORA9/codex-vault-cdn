HOAR, LL.D.\r\n  A WORTHY SUCCESSOR OF\r\n  DANIEL WEBSTER\r\n  IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Blest Statesman He, whose Mind's unselfish will\r\n  Leaves him at ease among grand thoughts: whose eye\r\n  Sees that, apart from magnanimity,\r\n  Wisdom exists not; nor the humbler skill\r\n  Of Prudence, disentangling good and ill\r\n  With patient care. What tho' assaults run high,\r\n  They daunt not him who holds his ministry,\r\n  Resolute, at all hazards, to fulfil\r\n  Its duties; prompt to move, but firm to wait;\r\n  Knowing, things rashly sought are rarely found;\r\n  That, for the functions of an ancient State--\r\n  Strong by her charters, free because imbound,\r\n  Servant of Providence, not slave of Fate--\r\n  Perilous is sweeping change, all chance unsound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBurke and Webster are models in the forensic literature of our own\r\nlanguage as truly as are Demosthenes and Cicero in the language of the\r\nancient classics. Each has distinct and inimitable characteristics\r\nwhich give force and beauty to his work. The study of each should be\r\nordered in such a way as to put one in touch with those qualities of\r\nmind and heart, of intellectual and moral manhood, by which each became\r\na leader in political philosophy and a model in literary style. One who\r\nstudies such authors in order to formulate a historical or a personal\r\nestimate merely, or to compare each as to certain externals of\r\nrhetorical form, has lost the true perspective of literary judgment.\r\n\r\nReading in the school and in the home is far too often pursued with a\r\npurpose to controvert and prove rather than to weigh and consider.\r\nReading which does not result in enlarging, stimulating, and refining\r\none's nature is but a busy idleness. The schools must see to it that\r\nthe desultory and dissipating methods of reading, so prevalent in the\r\nhome, are not encouraged. Pupils must be stimulated first of all to\r\nenjoy what is beautiful in nature and in art: for here is\r\n\r\n  \"A world of ready wealth,\r\n  Their minds and hearts to bless--\r\n  Spontaneous wisdom breathed by health,\r\n  Truth breathed by cheerfulness.\"\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of the classroom is too often \"art tongue-tied by\r\nauthority,\" and hence it is not wisdom at all, but a sham and a\r\npretence. Not until pupils rise to the spontaneity which betokens a\r\ngenuine love for the work in hand do they secure the richest results.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the masterpieces of the epic, the lyric, and the\r\ndrama; of the novel, the essay, and the oration, in a convenient form\r\nand at such a price as to bring them within the reach of our schools,\r\nmakes it inexcusable if pupils are allowed to be ignorant of the great\r\nliterary, ethical, and artistic impulses which have touched and\r\nquickened the life of the past.\r\n\r\nBurke's _American Orations_ present him at his best as a statesman, an\r\norator, and a stylist. When the edition of those speeches was prepared,\r\na selection from Webster's great speeches was contemplated as a\r\ncompanion volume. The present edition represents Webster in the various\r\nand distinct fields in which his genius manifested itself so powerfully\r\nand so nobly. He is here seen before a jury, before the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States, on a great historical occasion, in the Senate of\r\nthe United States, in a great national canvass, and as a eulogist.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for making the volume too large for school use I should\r\nhave included the famous speech delivered in the Senate on the 7th of\r\nMarch, 1850. This speech has been considered by many as the _vulnus\r\nimmedicabile_ of Mr. Webster's political life; it is certain that for\r\nit he was most rankly abused. \"Massachusetts,\" as Hon. John D. Long has\r\nsaid, \"smote and broke the heart of Webster, her idol, and then broke\r\nher own above his grave, and to-day writes his name highest upon her\r\nroll of statesmen.\"\r\n\r\nI find in this speech nothing but what is consistent with Mr. Webster's\r\nnoble adherence to the Constitution and the Union; nothing but what is\r\nconsistent with the solemn duty of a great man in a great national\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nIn his address at Buffalo on the 22d of May, 1851, he expressed himself\r\nvery freely in regard to this speech, saying: \"I felt that I had a duty\r\nto perform to my country, to my own reputation; for I flattered myself\r\nthat a service of forty years had given me some character, on which I\r\nhad a right to repose for my justification in the performance of a duty\r\nattended with some degree of local unpopularity. I thought it was my\r\nduty to pursue this course, and I did not care what was to be the\r\nconsequence. And, Gentlemen, allow me to say here to-day, that if the\r\nfate of John Rogers had stared me in the face, if I had seen the stake,\r\nif I had heard the fagots already crackling, by the blessing of\r\nAlmighty God I would have gone on and discharged the duty which I\r\nthought my country called upon me to perform.\"\r\n\r\nDoes this seem the language of one who had abandoned his post and was\r\nmerely \"bidding for the Presidency\"?\r\n\r\nThe address of Hon. Rufus Choate, before the students of Dartmouth\r\nCollege, commemorative of Daniel Webster, has a remark on this subject\r\nso just that I cannot refrain from quoting it. He says: \"Until the\r\naccuser who charges Mr. Webster with having 'sinned against his\r\nconscience' will assert that the conscience of a public man may not,\r\nmust not, be instructed by profound knowledge of the vast\r\nsubject-matter with which public life is conversant, and will assert\r\nthat he is certain that the consummate science of our great statesman\r\nwas _felt by himself to prescribe to his morality_ another conduct than\r\nthat which he adopted, and that he thus consciously outraged that\r\n'sense of duty which pursues us ever,'--is he not inexcusable, whoever\r\nhe is, that so judges another?\"\r\n\r\nAt the meeting held in Faneuil Hall, Oct. 27, 1852, commemorative of\r\nMr. Webster's life and work, Mr. Edward Everett said: \"Whoever, in\r\nafter time, shall write the history of the United States for the last\r\nforty years will write the life of Daniel Webster; and whoever writes\r\nthe life of Daniel Webster as it ought to be written will write the\r\nhistory of the Union from the time he took a leading part in its\r\nconcerns.\" Mr. Choate, at a meeting of the Supreme Court of\r\nMassachusetts, Oct. 25, 1852, said: \"Happier than the younger Pliny,\r\nhappier than Cicero, he has found his historian, unsolicited, in his\r\nlifetime, and his countrymen have him all by heart.\"\r\n\r\nIf this volume shall aid in bringing the young of this generation \"to\r\nhave him all by heart,\" to ascend his imaginative heights and sit under\r\nthe shadow of his profound reflections on that which is fundamental in\r\ncivil and religious liberty, its purpose will be accomplished.\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions these selections are given entire. Whenever they\r\nhave been abridged, the continuity of the discourse has not been\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of annotation the purpose has been to furnish sufficient\r\naid to the general reader, and at the same time to indicate to the\r\nspecial student lines along which he may study the speeches.\r\n\r\nIn Edward Everett's Memoir, found in the first volume of Mr. Webster's\r\nworks; in the life of Mr. Webster by George Tichnor Curtis, and in\r\nHenry Cabot Lodge's _Daniel Webster_, in the American Statesman Series,\r\nthe student has exhaustive, scholarly, and judicious estimates of Mr.\r\nWebster's work.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to the Hon. George F. Hoar and the Hon. Edward J. Phelps\r\nfor assistance in the task of selecting representative speeches; and to\r\nthe former for permission to associate his name with this edition of\r\nMr. Webster's work.\r\n\r\nA. J. G.\r\n\r\nBrookline, November, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Webster approaches as nearly to the _beau ideal_ of a republican\r\nSenator as any man that I have ever seen in the course of my life;\r\nworthy of Rome or Venice rather than of our noisy and wrangling\r\ngeneration.--Hallam.\r\n\r\nColeridge used to say that he had seldom known or heard of any great\r\nman who had not much of the woman in him. Even so the large intellect\r\nof Daniel Webster seemed to be coupled with all softer feelings; and\r\nhis countenance and bearing, at the very first, impressed me with this.\r\nA commanding brow, thoughtful eyes, and a mouth that seemed to respond\r\nto all humanities. He deserves his fame, I am sure.--John Kenyon.\r\n\r\nHe is a magnificent specimen. You might say to all the world, \"This is\r\nour Yankee Englishman; such limbs we make in Yankee-land!\" As a\r\nparliamentary Hercules one would incline to back him at first sight\r\nagainst all the extant world. The tanned complexion; that amorphous\r\ncraglike face; the dull black eyes under the precipice of brows, like\r\ndull anthracite furnaces needing only to be _blown_; the mastiff mouth,\r\naccurately closed; I have not traced so much of _silent Berserkir rage_\r\nthat I remember of in any other man.--Thomas Carlyle.\r\n\r\nWhen the historian shall look back upon the first century of the\r\nAmerican Republic, the two names that will shine with most unfading\r\nlustre and the serenest glory, high above all others, are Washington\r\nand Webster.--Professor Felton.\r\n\r\nConsider the remarkable phenomenon of excellence in three unkindred,\r\none might have thought incompatible, forms of public speech,--that of\r\nthe forum, with its double audience of bench and jury, of the halls of\r\nlegislation, and of the most thronged and tumultuous assemblies of the\r\npeople. Consider, further, that this multiform eloquence, exactly as\r\nhis words fell, became at once so much accession to permanent\r\nliterature in the strictest sense,--solid, attractive, rich,--and ask\r\nhow often in the history of public life such a thing has been\r\nexemplified.--Rufus Choate.\r\n\r\nThe noblest monument to Daniel Webster is in his works. As a repository\r\nof political truth and practical wisdom, applied to the affairs of\r\ngovernment, I know not where we shall find their equal. The works of\r\nBurke naturally suggest themselves to the mind, as the only writings in\r\nour language that can sustain the comparison.--Edward Everett.\r\n\r\nHe writes like a man who is thinking of his subject, and not of his\r\nstyle, and thus he wastes no time upon the mere garb of his thoughts.\r\nHis style is Doric, not Corinthian. His sentences are like shafts hewn\r\nfrom the granite of his own hills,--simple, massive, strong. We may\r\napply to him what Quinctilian says of Cicero, that a relish for his\r\nwritings is itself a mark of good taste.--George S. Hillard.\r\n\r\nHe taught the people of the United States, in the simplicity of common\r\nunderstanding, the principles of the Constitution and government of the\r\ncountry, and he wrought for them, in a style of matchless strength and\r\nbeauty, the literature of statesmanship. He made his language the very\r\nhousehold words of a nation. They are the library of the people. They\r\nare the school-book of the citizen.--John D. Long.\r\n\r\nTake him for all in all, he was not only the greatest orator this\r\ncountry has ever known, but in the history of eloquence his name will\r\nstand with those of Demosthenes and Cicero, Chatham and Burke.--Henry\r\nCabot Lodge.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the style of Webster is pre-eminently distinguished\r\nby manliness. The intellect and moral manliness of Webster underlies\r\nall his great orations and speeches; and this plain force of manhood,\r\nthis sturdy grapple with every question that comes before his\r\nunderstanding for settlement, leads him to reject all the meretricious\r\naids and ornaments of mere rhetoric, and is prominent, among the many\r\nexceptional qualities of his large nature, which have given him a high\r\nposition among the prose-writers of his country as a consummate master\r\nof English style.--Edwin P. Whipple.\r\n\r\nHis broad, wise statesmanship is to be the ample and refreshing shade,\r\nhis character the bright and breezy presence, in which all the members\r\nof this great and illustrious Republic may meet and sit down and feast\r\ntogether.--H. N. Hudson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Defence of the Kennistons\r\n  The Dartmouth College Case\r\n  First Settlement of New England\r\n  The Bunker Hill Monument\r\n  The Reply to Hayne\r\n  The Murder of Captain Joseph White\r\n  The Constitution Not a Compact Between Sovereign States\r\n  Speech at Saratoga\r\n  Eulogy on Mr. Justice Story\r\n  Biographical\r\n  Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefence of the Kennistons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Jury,--It is true that the offence charged in the\r\nindictment in this case is not capital; but perhaps this can hardly be\r\nconsidered as favorable to the defendants. To those who are guilty, and\r\nwithout hope of escape, no doubt the lightness of the penalty of\r\ntransgression gives consolation. But if the defendants are innocent, it\r\nis more natural for them to be thinking upon what they have lost by\r\nthat alteration of the law which has left highway robbery no longer\r\ncapital, than upon what the guilty might gain by it. They have lost\r\nthose great privileges in their trial, which the law allows, in capital\r\ncases, for the protection of innocence against unfounded accusation.\r\nThey have lost the right of being previously furnished with a copy of\r\nthe indictment, and a list of the government witnesses. They have lost\r\nthe right of peremptory challenge; and, notwithstanding the prejudices\r\nwhich they know have been excited against them, they must show legal\r\ncause of challenge, in each individual case, or else take the jury as\r\nthey find it. They have lost the benefit of assignment of counsel by\r\nthe court. They have lost the benefit of the Commonwealth's process to\r\nbring in witnesses in their behalf. When to these circumstances it is\r\nadded that they are strangers, almost wholly without friends, and\r\nwithout the means for preparing their defence, it is evident they must\r\ntake their trial under great disadvantages.\r\n\r\nBut without dwelling on these considerations, I proceed, Gentlemen of\r\nthe Jury, to ask your attention to those circumstances which cannot but\r\ncast doubts on the story of the prosecutor.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is impossible to believe that a robbery of this\r\nsort could have been committed by three or four men without previous\r\narrangement and concert, and of course without the knowledge of the\r\nfact that Goodridge would be there, and that he had money. They did not\r\ngo on the highway, in such a place, in a cold December's night, for the\r\ngeneral purpose of attacking the first passenger, running the chance of\r\nhis being somebody who had money. It is not easy to believe that a gang\r\nof robbers existed, that they acted systematically, communicating\r\nintelligence to one another, and meeting and dispersing as occasion\r\nrequired, and that this gang had their head-quarters in such a place as\r\nNewburyport. No town is more distinguished for the general correctness\r\nof the habits of its citizens; and it is of such a size that every man\r\nin it may be known to all the rest. The pursuits, occupations, and\r\nhabits of every person within it are within the observation of his\r\nneighbors. A suspicious stranger would be instantly observed, and all\r\nhis movements could be easily traced. This is not the place to be the\r\ngeneral rendezvous of a gang of robbers. Offenders of this sort hang on\r\nthe skirts of large towns. From the commission of their crimes they\r\nhasten into the crowd, and hide themselves in the populousness of great\r\ncities. If it be wholly improbable that a gang existed in such a place\r\nfor the purpose of general plunder, the next inquiry is, Is there any\r\nreason to think that there was a special or particular combination, for\r\nthe single purpose of robbing the prosecutor? Now it is material to\r\nobserve, that not only is there no evidence of any such combination,\r\nbut also, that circumstances existed which render it next to impossible\r\nthat the defendants could have been parties to such a combination, or\r\neven that they could have any knowledge of the existence of any such\r\nman as Goodridge, or that any person, with money, was expected to come\r\nfrom the eastward, and to be near Essex Bridge, at or about nine\r\no'clock, the evening when the robbery is said to have been committed.\r\n\r\nOne of the defendants had been for some weeks in Newburyport, the other\r\npassed the bridge from New Hampshire at twelve o'clock on the 19th of\r\nDecember, 1816. At this time, Goodridge had not yet arrived at Exeter,\r\ntwelve or fourteen miles from the bridge. How, then, could either of\r\nthe defendants know that he was coming? Besides, he says that nobody,\r\nas far as he is aware, knew on the road that he had money, and nothing\r\nhappened till he reached Exeter, according to his account, from which\r\nit might be conjectured that such was the case. Here, as he relates it,\r\nit became known that he had pistols; and he must wish you to infer that\r\nthe plan to rob him was laid here, at Exeter, by some of the persons\r\nwho inferred that he had money from his being armed. Who were these\r\npersons? Certainly not the defendants, or either of them. Certainly not\r\nTaber. Certainly not Jackman. Were they persons of suspicious\r\ncharacters? Was he in a house of a suspicious character? On this point\r\nhe gives us no information. He has either not taken the pains to\r\ninquire, or he chooses not to communicate the result of his inquiries.\r\nYet nothing could be more important, since he seems compelled to lay\r\nthe scene of the plot against him at Exeter, than to know who the\r\npersons were that he saw, or who saw him, at that place. On the face of\r\nthe facts now proved, nothing could be more improbable than that the\r\nplan of robbery was concerted at Exeter. If so, why should those who\r\nconcerted it send forward to Newburyport to engage the defendants,\r\nespecially as they did not know that they were there? What should\r\ninduce any persons so suddenly to apply to the defendants to assist in\r\na robbery? There was nothing in their personal character or previous\r\nhistory that should induce this.\r\n\r\nNor was there time for all this. If the prosecutor had not lingered on\r\nthe road, for reasons not yet discovered, he must have been in\r\nNewburyport long before the time at which he states the robbery to have\r\nbeen committed. How, then, could any one expect to leave Exeter, come\r\nto Newburyport, fifteen miles, there look out for and find out\r\nassistants for a highway robbery, and get back two miles to a\r\nconvenient place for the commission of the crime? That any body should\r\nhave undertaken to act thus is wholly improbable; and, in point of\r\nfact, there is not the least proof of any body's travelling, that\r\nafternoon, from Exeter to Newburyport, or of any person who was at the\r\ntavern at Exeter having left it that afternoon. In all probability,\r\nnothing of this sort could have taken place without being capable of\r\ndetection and proof. In every particular, the prosecutor has wholly\r\nfailed to show the least probability of a plan to rob him having been\r\nlaid at Exeter.\r\n\r\nBut how comes it that Goodridge was near or quite four hours and a half\r\nin travelling a distance which might have been travelled in two hours\r\nor two hours and a half. He says he missed his way, and went the\r\nSalisbury road. But some of the jury know that this could not have\r\ndelayed him more than five or ten minutes. He ought to be able to give\r\nsome better account of this delay.\r\n\r\nFailing, as he seems to do, to create any belief that a plan to rob him\r\nwas arranged at Exeter, the prosecutor goes back to Alfred, and says he\r\nsaw there a man whom Taber resembles. But Taber is proved to have been\r\nat that time, and at the time of the robbery, in Boston. This is proved\r\nbeyond question. It is so certain, that the Solicitor-General has _nol\r\nprossed_ the indictment against him.\r\n\r\nThere is an end, then, of all pretence of the adoption of a scheme of\r\nrobbery at Alfred. This leaves the prosecutor altogether unable to\r\npoint out any manner in which it should become known that he had money,\r\nor in which a design to rob him should originate.\r\n\r\nIt is next to be considered whether the prosecutor's story is either\r\nnatural or consistent. But, on the threshold of the inquiry, every one\r\nputs the question, What motive had the prosecutor to be guilty of the\r\nabominable conduct of feigning a robbery? It is difficult to assign\r\nmotives. The jury do not know enough of his character or circumstances.\r\nSuch things have happened, and may happen again. Suppose he owed money\r\nin Boston, and had it not to pay? Who knows how high he might estimate\r\nthe value of a plausible apology? Some men have also a whimsical\r\nambition of distinction. There is no end to the variety of modes in\r\nwhich human vanity exhibits itself. A story of this nature excites the\r\npublic sympathy. It attracts general attention. It causes the name of\r\nthe prosecutor to be celebrated as a man who has been attacked, and,\r\nafter a manly resistance, overcome by robbers, and who has renewed his\r\nresistance as soon as returning life and sensation enabled him, and,\r\nafter a second conflict, has been quite subdued, beaten and bruised out\r\nof all sense and sensation, and finally left for dead on the field. It\r\nis not easy to say how far such motives, trifling and ridiculous as\r\nmost men would think them, might influence the prosecutor, when\r\nconnected with any expectation of favor or indulgence, if he wanted\r\nsuch, from his creditors. It is to be remembered that he probably did\r\nnot see all the consequences of his conduct, if his robbery be a\r\npretence. He might not intend to prosecute any body. But he probably\r\nfound, and indeed there is evidence to show, that it was necessary for\r\nhim to do something to find out the authors of the alleged robbery. He\r\nmanifested no particular zeal on this subject. He was in no haste. He\r\nappears rather to have been pressed by others to do that which, if he\r\nhad really been robbed, we should suppose he would have been most\r\nearnest to do, the earliest moment.\r\n\r\nBut could he so seriously wound himself? Could he or would he shoot a\r\npistol-bullet through his hand, in order to render the robbery\r\nprobable, and to obtain belief in his story? All exhibitions are\r\nsubject to accidents. Whether they are serious or farcical, they may,\r\nin some particulars, not proceed exactly as they are designed to do. If\r\nwe knew that this shot through the hand, if made by himself, must have\r\nbeen intentionally made by himself, it would be a circumstance of\r\ngreater weight. The bullet went through the sleeve of his coat. He\r\nmight have intended it should go through nothing else. It is quite\r\ncertain he did not receive the wound in the way he described. He says\r\nhe was pulling or thrusting aside the robber's pistol, and while his\r\nhand was on it, it was fired, and the contents passed through his hand.\r\nThis could not have been so, because no part of the contents went\r\nthrough the hand, except the ball. There was powder on the sleeve of\r\nhis coat, and from the appearance one would think the pistol to have\r\nbeen three or four feet from the hand when fired. The fact of the\r\npistol-bullet being fired through the hand, is doubtless a circumstance\r\nof importance. It may not be easy to account for it; but it is to be\r\nweighed with other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is most extraordinary, that, in the whole case, the prosecutor\r\nshould prove hardly any fact in any way but by his own oath. He chooses\r\nto trust every thing on his own credit with the jury. Had he the money\r\nwith him which he mentions? If so, his clerks or persons connected with\r\nhim in business must have known it; yet no witness is produced. Nothing\r\ncan be more important than to prove that he had the money. Yet he does\r\nnot prove it. Why should he leave this essential fact without further\r\nsupport? He is not surprised with this defence, he knew what it would\r\nbe. He knew that nothing could be more important than to prove that, in\r\ntruth, he did possess the money which he says he lost; yet he does not\r\nprove it. All that he saw, and all that he did, and everything that\r\noccurred to him until the alleged robbery, rests solely on his own\r\ncredit. He does not see fit to corroborate any fact by the testimony of\r\nany witness. So he went to New York to arrest Jackman. He did arrest\r\nhim. He swears positively that he found in his possession papers which\r\nhe lost at the time of the robbery; yet he neither produces the papers\r\nthemselves, nor the persons who assisted in the search.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, he represents his intercourse with Taber at Boston.\r\nTaber, he says, made certain confessions. They made a bargain for a\r\ndisclosure or confession on one side, and a reward on the other. But no\r\none heard these confessions except Goodridge himself. Taber now\r\nconfronts him, and pronounces this part of his story to be wholly\r\nfalse; and there is nobody who can support the prosecutor.\r\n\r\nA jury cannot too seriously reflect on this part of the case. There are\r\nmany most important allegations of fact, which, if true, could easily\r\nbe shown by other witnesses, and yet are not so shown.\r\n\r\nHow came Mr. Goodridge to set out from Bangor, armed in this formal and\r\nformidable manner? How came he to be so apprehensive of a robbery? The\r\nreason he gives is completely ridiculous. As the foundation of his\r\nalarm, he tells a story of a robbery which he had heard of, but which,\r\nas far as appears, no one else ever heard of; and the story itself is\r\nso perfectly absurd, it is difficult to resist the belief that it was\r\nthe product of his imagination at the moment. He seems to have been a\r\nlittle too confident that an attempt would be made to rob him. The\r\nmanner in which he carried his money, as he says, indicated a strong\r\nexpectation of this sort. His gold he wrapped in a cambric cloth, put\r\nit into a shot bag, and then into a portmanteau. One parcel of bills,\r\nof a hundred dollars in amount, he put into his pocket-book; another,\r\nof somewhat more than a thousand dollars, he carried next his person,\r\nunderneath all his clothes. Having disposed of his money in this way,\r\nand armed himself with two good pistols, he set out from Bangor. The\r\njury will judge whether this extraordinary care of his money, and this\r\nformal arming of himself to defend it, are not circumstances of a very\r\nsuspicious character.\r\n\r\nHe stated that he did not travel in the night; that he would not so\r\nmuch expose himself to robbers. He said that, when he came near Alfred,\r\nhe did not go into the village, but stopped a few miles short, because\r\nnight was coming on, and he would not trust himself and his money out\r\nat night. He represents himself to have observed this rule constantly\r\nand invariably until he got to Exeter. Yet, when the time came for the\r\nrobbery, he was found out at night. He left Exeter about sunset,\r\nintending to go to Newburyport, fifteen miles distant, that evening.\r\nWhen he is asked how this should happen, he says he had no fear of\r\nrobbers after he left the District of Maine. He thought himself quite\r\nsafe when he arrived at Exeter. Yet he told the jury, that at Exeter he\r\nthought it necessary to load his pistol afresh. He asked for a private\r\nroom at the inn. He told the persons in attendance that he wished such\r\na room for the purpose of changing his clothes. He charged them not to\r\nsuffer him to be interrupted. But he now testifies that his object was\r\nnot to change his dress, but to put new loading into his pistols. What\r\nsort of a story is this?\r\n\r\nHe says he now felt himself out of all danger from robbers, and was\r\ntherefore willing to travel at night. At the same time, he thought\r\nhimself in very great danger from robbers, and therefore took the\r\nutmost pains to keep his pistols well loaded and in good order. To\r\naccount for the pains he took about loading his pistols at Exeter, he\r\nsays it was his invariable practice, every day after he left Bangor, to\r\ndischarge and load again one or both of his pistols; that he never\r\nmissed doing this; that he avoided doing it at the inns, lest he should\r\ncreate suspicion, but that he did it, while alone, on the road, every\r\nday.\r\n\r\nHow far this is probable the jury will judge. It will be observed that\r\nhe gave up his habits of caution as he approached the place of the\r\nrobbery. He then loaded his pistols at the tavern, where persons might\r\nand did see him; and he then also travelled in the night. He passed the\r\nbridge over Merrimack River a few minutes before nine o'clock. He was\r\nnow at a part of his progress where he was within the observation of\r\nother witnesses, and something could be known of him besides what he\r\ntold of himself. Immediately after him passed the two persons with\r\ntheir wagons, Shaw and Keyser. Close upon them followed the mail-coach.\r\nNow, these wagons and the mail must have passed within three rods, at\r\nmost, of Goodridge, at the very time of the robbery. They must have\r\nbeen very near the spot, the very moment of the attack; and if he was\r\nunder the robbers' hands as long as he represents, or if they staid on\r\nthe spot long enough to do half what he says they did, they must have\r\nbeen there when the wagons and the stage passed. At any rate, it is\r\nnext to impossible, by any computation of time, to put these carriages\r\nso far from the spot, that the drivers should not have heard the cry of\r\nmurder, which he says he raised, or the report of the two pistols,\r\nwhich he says were discharged. In three quarters of an hour, or an\r\nhour, he returned, and repassed the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe jury will next naturally look to the appearances exhibited on the\r\nfield after the robbery. The portmanteau was there. The witnesses say,\r\nthat the straps which fastened it to the saddle had been neither cut\r\nnor broken. They were carefully unbuckled. This was very considerate\r\nfor robbers. It had been opened, and its contents were scattered about\r\nthe field. The pocket-book, too, had been opened, and many papers it\r\ncontained found on the ground. Nothing valuable was lost but money. The\r\nrobbers did not think it well to go off at once with the portmanteau\r\nand the pocket-book. The place was so secure, so remote, so\r\nunfrequented; they were so far from the highway, at least one full rod;\r\nthere were so few persons passing, probably not more than four or five\r\nthen in the road, within hearing of the pistols and the cries of\r\nGoodridge; there being, too, not above five or six dwelling-houses,\r\nfull of people, within the hearing of the report of a pistol; these\r\ncircumstances were all so favorable to their safety, that the robbers\r\nsat down to look over the prosecutor's papers, carefully examined the\r\ncontents of his pocket-book and portmanteau, and took only the things\r\nwhich they needed! There was money belonging to other persons. The\r\nrobbers did not take it. They found out it was not the prosecutor's,\r\nand left it. It may be said to be favorable to the prosecutor's story,\r\nthat the money which did not belong to him, and the plunder of which\r\nwould seem to be the most probable inducement he could have to feign a\r\nrobbery, was not taken. But the jury will consider whether this\r\ncircumstance does not bear quite as strongly the other way, and whether\r\nthey can believe that robbers could have left this money, either from\r\naccident or design.\r\n\r\nThe robbers, by Goodridge's account, were extremely careful to search\r\nhis person. Having found money in his portmanteau and in his\r\npocket-book, they still forthwith stripped him to the skin, and\r\nsearched until they found the sum which had been so carefully deposited\r\nunder his clothes. Was it likely, that, having found money in the\r\nplaces where it is ordinarily carried, robbers should proceed to search\r\nfor more, where they had no reason to suppose more would be found?\r\nGoodridge says that no person knew of his having put his bank-notes in\r\nthat situation. On the first attack, however, they proceeded to open\r\none garment after another, until they penetrated to the treasure, which\r\nwas beneath them all.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Mr. Howard is material. He examined Goodridge's\r\npistol, which was found on the spot, and thinks it had not been fired\r\nat all. If this be so, it would follow that the wound through the hand\r\nwas not made by this pistol; but then, as the pistol is now discharged,\r\nif it had not been fired, he is not correct in swearing that he fired\r\nit at the robbers, nor could it have been loaded at Exeter, as he\r\ntestified.\r\n\r\nIn the whole case, there is nothing, perhaps, more deserving\r\nconsideration, than the prosecutor's statement of the violence which\r\nthe robbers used towards him. He says he was struck with a heavy club,\r\non the back part of his head. He fell senseless to the ground. Three or\r\nfour rough-handed villains then dragged him to the fence, and through\r\nit or over it, with such force as to break one of the boards. They then\r\nplundered his money. Presently he came to his senses; perceived his\r\nsituation; saw one of the robbers sitting or standing near; he\r\nvaliantly sprung upon, and would have overcome him, but the ruffian\r\ncalled out for his comrades, who returned, and all together they\r\nrenewed their attack upon, subdued him, and redoubled their violence.\r\nThey struck him heavy blows; they threw him violently to the ground;\r\nthey kicked him in the side; they choked him; one of them, to use his\r\nown words, jumped upon his breast. They left him only when they\r\nsupposed they had killed him. He went back to Pearson's, at the bridge,\r\nin a state of delirium, and it was several hours before his\r\nrecollection came to him. This is his account. Now, in point of fact,\r\nit is certain that on no part of his person was there the least mark of\r\nthis beating and wounding. The blow on the head, which brought him\r\nsenseless to the ground, neither broke the skin, nor caused any tumor,\r\nnor left any mark whatever. He fell from his horse on the frozen\r\nground, without any appearance of injury. He was drawn through or over\r\nthe fence with such force as to break the rail, but not so as to leave\r\nany wound or scratch on him. A second time he is knocked down, kicked,\r\nstamped upon, choked, and in every way abused and beaten till sense had\r\ndeparted, and the breath of life hardly remained; and yet no wound,\r\nbruise, discoloration, or mark of injury was found to result from all\r\nthis. Except the wound in his hand, and a few slight punctures in his\r\nleft arm, apparently made with his own penknife, which was found open\r\non the spot, there was no wound or mark which the surgeons, upon\r\nrepeated examinations, could anywhere discover. This is a story not to\r\nbe believed. No matter who tells it, it is so impossible to be true,\r\nthat all belief is set at defiance. No man can believe it. All this\r\ntale of blows which left no marks, and of wounds which could not be\r\ndiscovered, must be the work of imagination. If the jury can believe\r\nthat he was robbed, it is impossible they can believe his account of\r\nthe manner of it.\r\n\r\nWith respect, next, to delirium. The jury have heard the physicians.\r\nTwo of them have no doubt it was all feigned. Dr. Spofford spoke in a\r\nmore guarded manner, but it was very evident his opinion agreed with\r\ntheirs. In the height of his raving, the physician who was present said\r\nto others, that he could find nothing the matter with the man, and that\r\nhis pulse was perfectly regular. But consider the facts which Dr. Balch\r\ntestifies. He suspected the whole of this illness and delirium to be\r\nfeigned. He wished to ascertain the truth. While he or others were\r\npresent, Goodridge appeared to be in the greatest pains and agony from\r\nhis wounds. He could not turn himself in bed, nor be turned by others,\r\nwithout infinite distress. His mind, too, was as much disordered as his\r\nbody. He was constantly raving about robbery and murder. At length the\r\nphysicians and others withdrew, and left him alone in the room. Dr.\r\nBalch returned softly to the door, which he had left partly open, and\r\nthere he had a full view of his patient, unobserved by him. Goodridge\r\nwas then very quiet. His incoherent exclamations had ceased. Dr. Balch\r\nsaw him turn over without inconvenience. Pretty soon he sat up in bed,\r\nand adjusted his neckcloth and his hair. Then, hearing footsteps on the\r\nstaircase, he instantly sunk into the bed again; his pains all\r\nreturned, and he cried out against robbers and murderers as loud as\r\never. Now, these facts are all sworn to by an intelligent witness, who\r\ncannot be mistaken in them; a respectable physician, whose veracity or\r\naccuracy is in no way impeached or questioned. After this, it is\r\ndifficult to retain any good opinion of the prosecutor. Robbed or not\r\nrobbed, this was his conduct; and such conduct necessarily takes away\r\nall claim to sympathy and respect. The jury will consider whether it\r\ndoes not also take away all right to be believed in anything. For if\r\nthey should be of opinion that in any one point he has intentionally\r\nmisrepresented facts, he can be believed in nothing. No man is to be\r\nconvicted on the testimony of a witness whom the jury has found\r\nwilfully violating the truth in any particular.\r\n\r\nThe next part of the case is the conduct of the prosecutor in\r\nattempting to find out the robbers, after he had recovered from his\r\nillness. He suspected Mr. Pearson, a very honest, respectable man, who\r\nkeeps the tavern at the bridge. He searched his house and premises. He\r\nsent for a conjuror to come, with his metallic rods and witch-hazel, to\r\nfind the stolen money. Goodridge says now, that he thought he should\r\nfind it, if the conjuror's instruments were properly prepared. He\r\nprofesses to have full faith in the art. Was this folly, or fraud, or a\r\nstrange mixture of both? Pretty soon after the last search, gold pieces\r\nwere actually found near Mr. pearson's house, in the manner stated by\r\nthe female witness. How came they there? Did the robber deposit them\r\nthere? That is not possible. Did he accidentally leave them there? Why\r\nshould not a robber take as good care of his money as others? It is\r\ncertain, too, that the gold pieces were not put there at the time of\r\nthe robbery, because the ground was then bare; but when these pieces\r\nwere found, there were several inches of snow below them. When\r\nGoodridge searched here with his conjuror, he was on this spot, alone\r\nand unobserved, as he thought. Whether he did not, at that time, drop\r\nhis gold into the snow, the jury will judge. When he came to this\r\nsearch, he proposed something very ridiculous. He proposed that all\r\npersons about to assist in the search should be examined, to see that\r\nthey had nothing which they could put into Pearson's possession, for\r\nthe purpose of being found there. But how was this examination to be\r\nmade? Why, truly, Goodridge proposed that every man should examine\r\nhimself, and that, among others, he would examine himself, till he was\r\nsatisfied he had nothing in his pockets which he could leave at\r\npearson's, with the fraudulent design of being afterwards found there,\r\nas evidence against pearson. What construction would be given to such\r\nconduct?\r\n\r\nAs to Jackman, Goodridge went to New York and arrested him. In his room\r\nhe says he found paper coverings of gold, with his own figures on them,\r\nand pieces of an old and useless receipt, which he can identify, and\r\nwhich he had in his possession at the time of the robbery. He found\r\nthese things lying on the floor in Jackman's room. What should induce\r\nthe robbers, when they left all other papers, to take this receipt? And\r\nwhat should induce Jackman to carry it to New York, and keep it, with\r\nthe coverings of the gold, in a situation where it was likely to be\r\nfound, and used as evidence against him?\r\n\r\nThere is no end to the series of improbabilities growing out of the\r\nprosecutor's story.\r\n\r\nOne thing especially deserves notice. Wherever Goodridge searches, he\r\nalways finds something; and what he finds, he always can identify and\r\nswear to, as being his. The thing found has always some marks by which\r\nhe knows it. Yet he never finds much. He never finds the mass of his\r\nlost treasure. He finds just enough to be evidence, and no more.\r\n\r\nThese are the circumstances which tend to raise doubts of the truth of\r\nthe prosecutor's relation. It is for the jury to say, whether it would\r\nbe safe to convict any man for this robbery until these doubts shall be\r\ncleared up. No doubt they are to judge him candidly; but they are not\r\nto make every thing yield to a regard to his reputation, or a desire to\r\nvindicate him from the suspicion of a fraudulent prosecution.\r\n\r\nHe stands like other witnesses, except that he is a very interested\r\nwitness; and he must hope for credit, if at all, from the consistency\r\nand general probability of the facts to which he testifies. The jury\r\nwill not convict the prisoners to save the prosecutor from disgrace. He\r\nhas had every opportunity of making out his case. If any person in the\r\nState could have corroborated any part of his story, that person he\r\ncould have produced. He has had the benefit of full time, and good\r\ncounsel, and of the Commonwealth's process, to bring in his witnesses.\r\nMore than all, he has had an opportunity of telling his own story, with\r\nthe simplicity that belongs to truth, if it were true, and the\r\nfrankness and earnestness of an honest man, if he be such. It is for\r\nthe jury to say, under their oaths, how he has acquitted himself in\r\nthese particulars, and whether he has left their minds free from doubt\r\nas to the truth of his narration.\r\n\r\nBut if Goodridge were really robbed, is there satisfactory evidence\r\nthat the defendants had a hand in the commission of this offence? The\r\nevidence relied on is the finding of the money in their house. It\r\nappears that these defendants lived together, and, with a sister,\r\nconstituted one family. Their father lived in another part of the same\r\nhouse, and with his wife constituted another and distinct family. In\r\nthis house, some six weeks after the robbery, the prosecutor made a\r\nsearch; and the result has been stated by the witnesses. Now, if the\r\nmoney had been passed or used by the defendants it might have been\r\nconclusive. If found about their persons, it might have been very\r\nstrong proof. But, under the circumstances of this case, the mere\r\nfinding of money in their house, and that only in places where the\r\nprosecutor had previously been, is no evidence at all. With respect to\r\nthe gold pieces, it is certainly true that they were found in\r\nGoodridge's track. They were found only where he had been, and might\r\nhave put them.\r\n\r\nWhen the sheriff was in the house and Goodridge in the cellar, gold was\r\nfound in the cellar. When the sheriff was up stairs and Goodridge in\r\nthe rooms below, the sheriff was called down to look for money where\r\nGoodridge directed, and there money was found. As to the bank-note, the\r\nevidence is not quite so clear. Mr. Leavitt says he found a note in a\r\ndrawer in a room in which none of the party had before been; that he\r\nthought it an uncurrent or counterfeit note, and not a part of\r\nGoodridge's money, and left it where he found it, without further\r\nnotice. An hour or two afterward, Upton perceived a note in the same\r\ndrawer, Goodridge being then with or near him, and called to Leavitt.\r\nLeavitt told him that he had discovered that note before, but that it\r\ncould not be Goodridge's. It was then examined. Leavitt says he looked\r\nat it, and saw writing on the back of it. Upton says he looked at it,\r\nand saw writing on the back of it. He says also that it was shown to\r\nGoodridge, who examined it in the same way that he and Leavitt examined\r\nit. None of the party at this time suspected it to be Goodridge's. It\r\nwas then put into Leavitt's pocket-book, where it remained till\r\nevening, when it was taken out at the tavern; and then it turns out to\r\nbe, plainly and clearly, one of Goodridge's notes, and has the name of\r\n\"James Poor, Bangor,\" in Goodridge's own handwriting, on the back of\r\nit. The first thing that strikes one in this account is, Why was not\r\nthis discovery made at the time? Goodridge was looking for notes, as\r\nwell as gold. He was looking for Boston notes, for such he had lost. He\r\nwas looking for ten-dollar notes, for such he had lost. He was looking\r\nfor notes which he could recognize and identify. He would, therefore,\r\nnaturally be particularly attentive to any writing or marks upon such\r\nas he might find. Under these circumstances, a note is found in the\r\nhouse of the supposed robbers. It is a Boston note, it is a ten-dollar\r\nnote, it has writing on the back of it; that writing is the name of his\r\ntown and the name of one of his neighbors; more than all, that writing\r\nis his own handwriting! Notwithstanding all this, neither Goodridge,\r\nnor Upton, nor the sheriff, examined it so as to see whether it was\r\nGoodridge's money. Notwithstanding it so fully resembled, in all\r\npoints, the money they were looking for, and notwithstanding they also\r\nsaw writing on the back of it, which, they must know, if they read it,\r\nwould probably have shown where it came from, neither of them did so\r\nfar examine it as to see any proof of its being Goodridge's.\r\n\r\nThis is hardly to be believed. It must be a pretty strong faith in the\r\nprosecutor that could credit this story. In every part of it, it is\r\nimprobable and absurd. It is much more easy to believe that the note\r\nwas changed. There might have been, and there probably was, an\r\nuncurrent or counterfeit note found in the drawer by Leavitt. He\r\ncertainly did not at the time think it to be Goodridge's, and he left\r\nit in the drawer where he found it. Before he saw it again, the\r\nprosecutor had been in that room, and was in or near it when the\r\nsheriff was again called in, and asked to put that bill in his\r\npocket-book. How do the jury know that this was the same note which\r\nLeavitt had before seen? Or suppose it was. Leavitt carried it to\r\nCoffin's; in the evening he produced it, and, after having been handed\r\nabout for some time among the company, it turns out to be Goodridge's\r\nnote, and to have upon it infallible marks of identity. How do the jury\r\nknow that a sleight of hand had not changed the note at Coffin's? It is\r\nsufficient to say, the note might have been changed. It is not certain\r\nthat this is the note which Leavitt first found in the drawer, and this\r\nnot being certain, it is not proof against the defendants.\r\n\r\nIs it not extremely improbable, if the defendants are guilty, that they\r\nshould deposit the money in the places where it was found? Why should\r\nthey put it in small parcels in so many places, for no end but to\r\nmultiply the chances of detection? Why, especially, should they put a\r\ndoubloon in their father's pocket-book? There is no evidence, nor any\r\nground of suspicion, that the father knew of the money being in his\r\npocket-book. He swears he did not know it. His general character is\r\nunimpeached, and there is nothing against his credit. The inquiry at\r\nStratham was calculated to elicit the truth; and, after all, there is\r\nnot the slightest reason to suspect that he knew that the doubloon was\r\nin his pocket-book. What could possibly induce the defendants to place\r\nit there? No man can conjecture a reason. On the other hand, if this is\r\na fraudulent proceeding on the part of the prosecutor, this\r\ncircumstance could be explained. He did not know that the pocket-book,\r\nand the garment in which it was found, did not belong to one of the\r\ndefendants. He was as likely, therefore, to place it there as\r\nelsewhere. It is very material to consider that nothing was found in\r\nthat part of the house which belonged to the defendants. Every thing\r\nwas discovered in the father's apartments. They were not found,\r\ntherefore, in the possession of the defendants, any more than if they\r\nhad been discovered in any other house in the neighborhood. The two\r\ntenements, it is true, were under the same roof; but they were not on\r\nthat account the same tenements. They were as distinct as any other\r\nhouses. Now, how should it happen that the several parcels of money\r\nshould all be found in the father's possession? He is not suspected,\r\ncertainly there is no reason to suspect him, of having had any hand\r\neither in the commission of the robbery or the concealing of the goods.\r\nHe swears he had no knowledge of any part of this money being in his\r\nhouse. It is not easy to imagine how it came there, unless it be\r\nsupposed to have been put there by some one who did not know what part\r\nof the house belonged to the defendants and what part did not.\r\n\r\nThe witnesses on the part of the prosecution have testified that the\r\ndefendants, when arrested, manifested great agitation and alarm;\r\npaleness overspread their faces, and drops of sweat stood on their\r\ntemples. This satisfied the witnesses of the defendants' guilt, and\r\nthey now state the circumstances as being indubitable proof. This\r\nargument manifests, in those who use it, an equal want of sense and\r\nsensibility. It is precisely fitted to the feeling and the intellect of\r\na bum-bailiff. In a court of justice it deserves nothing but contempt.\r\nIs there nothing that can agitate the frame or excite the blood but the\r\nconsciousness of guilt? If the defendants were innocent, would they not\r\nfeel indignation at this unjust accusation? If they saw an attempt to\r\nproduce false evidence against them, would they not be angry? And,\r\nseeing the production of such evidence, might they not feel fear and\r\nalarm? And have indignation, and anger, and terror, no power to affect\r\nthe human countenance or the human frame?\r\n\r\nMiserable, miserable, indeed, is the reasoning which would infer any\r\nman's guilt from his agitation when he found himself accused of a\r\nheinous offence; when he saw evidence which he might know to be false\r\nand fraudulent brought against him; when his house was filled, from the\r\ngarret to the cellar, by those whom he might esteem as false witnesses;\r\nand when he himself, instead of being at liberty to observe their\r\nconduct and watch their motions, was a prisoner in close custody in his\r\nown house, with the fists of a catch-poll clenched upon his throat.\r\n\r\nThe defendants were at Newburyport the afternoon and evening of the\r\nrobbery. For the greater part of the time they show where they were,\r\nand what they were doing. Their proof, it is true, does not apply to\r\nevery moment. But when it is considered that, from the moment of their\r\narrest, they have been in close prison, perhaps they have shown as much\r\nas could be expected. Few men, when called on afterwards, can remember,\r\nand fewer still can prove, how they have passed every half-hour of an\r\nevening. At a reasonable hour they both came to the house where Laban\r\nhad lodged the night before. Nothing suspicious was observed in their\r\nmanner or conversation. Is it probable they would thus come\r\nunconcernedly into the company of others, from a field of robbery, and,\r\nas they must have supposed, of murder, before they could have\r\nascertained whether the stain of blood was not on their garments? They\r\nremained in the place a part of the next day. The town was alarmed; a\r\nstrict inquiry was made of all strangers, and of the defendants among\r\nothers. Nothing suspicious was discovered. They avoided no inquiry, nor\r\ndid they leave the town in any haste. The jury has had an opportunity\r\nof seeing the defendants. Does their general appearance indicate that\r\nhardihood which would enable them to act this cool, unconcerned part?\r\nIs it not more likely they would have fled?\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the robbery to the arrest, five or six weeks, the\r\ndefendants were engaged in their usual occupations. They are not found\r\nto have passed a dollar of money to any body. They continued their\r\nordinary habits of labor. No man saw money about them, nor any\r\ncircumstance that might lead to a suspicion that they had money.\r\nNothing occurred tending in any degree to excite suspicion against\r\nthem. When arrested, and when all this array of evidence was brought\r\nagainst them, and when they could hope in nothing but their innocence,\r\nimmunity was offered them again if they would confess. They were\r\npressed, and urged, and allured, by every motive which could be set\r\nbefore them, to acknowledge their participation in the offence, and to\r\nbring out their accomplices. They steadily protested that they could\r\nconfess nothing because they knew nothing. In defiance of all the\r\ndiscoveries made in their house, they have trusted to their innocence.\r\nOn that, and on the candor and discernment of an enlightened jury, they\r\nstill rely.  If the jury are satisfied that there is the highest\r\nimprobability that these persons could have had any previous knowledge\r\nof Goodridge, or been concerned in any previous concert to rob him; if\r\ntheir conduct that evening and the next day was marked by no\r\ncircumstances of suspicion; if from that moment until their arrest\r\nnothing appeared against them; if they neither passed money, nor are\r\nfound to have had money; if the manner of the search of their house,\r\nand the circumstances attending it, excite strong suspicions of unfair\r\nand fraudulent practices; if, in the hour of their utmost peril, no\r\npromises of safety could draw from the defendants any confession\r\naffecting themselves or others, it will be for the jury to say whether\r\nthey can pronounce them guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dartmouth College Case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general question is, whether the acts of the legislature of New\r\nHampshire of the 27th of June, and of the 18th and 26th of December,\r\n1816, are valid and binding on the plaintiffs, _without their\r\nacceptance or assent_.\r\n\r\nThe charter of 1769 created and established a corporation, to consist\r\nof twelve persons, and no more; to be called the \"Trustees of Dartmouth\r\nCollege.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the institution thus created and constituted had existed,\r\nuninterruptedly and usefully, nearly fifty years, the legislature of\r\nNew Hampshire passed the acts in question.\r\n\r\nThe first act makes the twelve trustees under the charter, and nine\r\nother individuals, to be appointed by the Governor and Council, a\r\ncorporation, by a new name; and to this new corporation transfers all\r\nthe _property, rights, powers, liberties, and privileges_ of the old\r\ncorporation; with further power to establish new colleges and an\r\ninstitute, and to apply all or any part of the funds to these purposes;\r\nsubject to the power and control of a board of twenty-five overseers,\r\nto be appointed by the Governor and Council.\r\n\r\nThe second act makes further provisions for executing the objects of\r\nthe first, and the last act authorizes the defendant, the treasurer of\r\nthe plaintiffs, to retain and hold their property, against their will.\r\n\r\nIf these acts are valid, the old corporation is abolished, and a new\r\none created. The first act does, in fact, if it can have any effect,\r\ncreate a new corporation, and transfer to it all the property and\r\nfranchises of the old. The two corporations are not the same in\r\nanything which essentially belongs to the existence of a corporation.\r\nThey have different names, and different powers, rights, and duties.\r\nTheir organization is wholly different. The powers of the corporation\r\nare not vested in the same, or similar hands. In one, the trustees are\r\ntwelve, and no more. In the other, they are twenty-one. In one, the\r\npower is in a single board. In the other, it is divided between two\r\nboards. Although the act professes to include the old trustees in the\r\nnew corporation, yet that was without their assent, and against their\r\nremonstrance; and no person can be compelled to be a member of such a\r\ncorporation against his will. It was neither expected nor intended that\r\nthey should be members of the new corporation. The act itself treats\r\nthe old corporation as at an end, and, going on the ground that all its\r\nfunctions have ceased, it provides for the first meeting and\r\norganization of the new corporation. It expressly provides, also, that\r\nthe new corporation shall have and hold all the property of the old; a\r\nprovision which would be quite unnecessary upon any other ground, than\r\nthat the old corporation was dissolved. But if it could be contended\r\nthat the effect of these acts was not entirely to abolish the old\r\ncorporation, yet it is manifest that they impair and invade the rights,\r\nproperty, and powers of the trustees under the charter, as a\r\ncorporation, and the legal rights, privileges, and immunities which\r\nbelong to them, as individual members of the corporation.\r\n\r\nThe twelve trustees were the _sole_ legal owners of all the property\r\nacquired under the charter. By the acts, others are admitted, against\r\n_their_ will, to be joint owners. The twelve individuals who are\r\ntrustees were possessed of all the franchises and immunities conferred\r\nby the charter. By the acts, _nine_ other trustees and _twenty-five_\r\noverseers are admitted, against their will, to divide these franchises\r\nand immunities with them.\r\n\r\nIf, either as a corporation or as individuals, they have any legal\r\nrights, this forcible intrusion of others violates those rights, as\r\nmanifestly as an entire and complete ouster and dispossession. These\r\nacts alter the whole constitution of the corporation. They affect the\r\nrights of the whole body as a corporation, and the rights of the\r\nindividuals who compose it. They revoke corporate powers and\r\nfranchises. They alienate and transfer the property of the college to\r\nothers. By the charter, the trustees had a right to fill vacancies in\r\ntheir own number. This is now taken away. They were to consist of\r\ntwelve, and, by express provision, of no more. This is altered. They\r\nand their successors, appointed by themselves, were for ever to hold\r\nthe property. The legislature has found successors for them, before\r\ntheir seats are vacant. The powers and privileges which the twelve were\r\nto exercise exclusively, are now to be exercised by others. By one of\r\nthe acts, they are subjected to heavy penalties if they exercise their\r\noffices, or any of those powers and privileges granted them by charter,\r\nand which they had exercised for fifty years. They are to be punished\r\nfor not accepting the new grant and taking its benefits. This, it must\r\nbe confessed, is rather a summary mode of settling a question of\r\nconstitutional right. Not only are new trustees forced into the\r\ncorporation, but new trusts and uses are created. The college is turned\r\ninto a university. Power is given to create new colleges, and, to\r\nauthorize any diversion of the funds which may be agreeable to the new\r\nboards, sufficient latitude is given by the undefined power of\r\nestablishing an institute. To these new colleges, and this institute,\r\nthe funds contributed by the founder, Dr. Wheelock, and by the original\r\ndonors, the Earl of Dartmouth and others, are to be applied, in plain\r\nand manifest disregard of the uses to which they were given.\r\n\r\nThe president, one of the old trustees, had a right to his office,\r\nsalary, and emoluments, subject to the twelve trustees alone. His title\r\nto these is now changed, and he is made accountable to new masters. So\r\nalso all the professors and tutors. If the legislature can at pleasure\r\nmake these alterations and changes in the rights and privileges of the\r\nplaintiffs, it may, with equal propriety, abolish these rights and\r\nprivileges altogether. The same power which can do any part of this\r\nwork can accomplish the whole. And, indeed, the argument on which these\r\nacts have been hitherto defended goes altogether on the ground, that\r\nthis is such a corporation as the legislature may abolish at pleasure;\r\nand that its members have _no rights, liberties, franchises, property,\r\nor privileges_, which the legislature may not revoke, annul, alienate,\r\nor transfer to others, whenever it sees fit.\r\n\r\nIt will be contended by the plaintiffs, that these acts are not valid\r\nand binding on them without their assent,--\r\n\r\n1. Because they are against common right, and the Constitution of New\r\nHampshire.\r\n\r\n2. Because they are repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nI am aware of the limits which bound the jurisdiction of the court in\r\nthis case, and that on this record nothing can be decided but the\r\nsingle question, whether these acts are repugnant to the Constitution\r\nof the United States. Yet it may assist in forming an opinion of their\r\ntrue nature and character to compare them with those fundamental\r\nprinciples introduced into the State governments for the purpose of\r\nlimiting the exercise of the legislative power, and which the\r\nConstitution of New Hampshire expresses with great fulness and accuracy.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to assert, that the legislature of New Hampshire\r\nwould not have been competent to pass the acts in question, and to make\r\nthem binding on the plaintiffs without their assent, even if there had\r\nbeen, in the Constitution of New Hampshire, or of the United States, no\r\nspecial restriction on their power, because these acts are not the\r\nexercise of a power properly legislative. Their effect and object are\r\nto take away, from one, rights, property, and franchises, and to grant\r\nthem to another. This is not the exercise of a legislative power. To\r\njustify the taking away of vested rights there must be a forfeiture, to\r\nadjudge upon and declare which is the proper province of the judiciary.\r\nAttainder and confiscation are acts of sovereign power, not acts of\r\nlegislation. The British Parliament, among other unlimited powers,\r\nclaims that of altering and vacating charters; not as an act of\r\nordinary legislation, but of uncontrolled authority. It is\r\ntheoretically omnipotent. Yet, in modern times, it has very rarely\r\nattempted the exercise of this power.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of New Hampshire has no more power over the rights of\r\nthe plaintiffs than existed somewhere, in some department of\r\ngovernment, before the Revolution. The British Parliament could not\r\nhave annulled or revoked this grant as an act of ordinary legislation.\r\nIf it had done it at all, it could only have been in virtue of that\r\nsovereign power, called omnipotent, which does not belong to any\r\nlegislature in the United States. The legislature of New Hampshire has\r\nthe same power over this charter which belonged to the king who granted\r\nit, and no more. By the law of England, the power to create\r\ncorporations is a part of the royal prerogative. By the Revolution,\r\nthis power may be considered as having devolved on the legislature of\r\nthe State, and it has accordingly been exercised by the legislature.\r\nBut the king cannot abolish a corporation, or new-model it, or alter\r\nits powers, without its assent. This is the acknowledged and well-known\r\ndoctrine of the common law.\r\n\r\nThere are prohibitions in the Constitution and Bill of Rights of New\r\nHampshire, introduced for the purpose of limiting the legislative power\r\nand protecting the rights and property of the citizens. One prohibition\r\nis, \"that no person shall be deprived of his property, immunities, or\r\nprivileges, put out of the protection of the law, or deprived of his\r\nlife, liberty, or estate, but by judgment of his peers or the law of\r\nthe land.\"\r\n\r\nIn the opinion, however, which was given in the court below, it is\r\ndenied that the trustees under the charter had any property, immunity,\r\nliberty, or privilege in this corporation, within the meaning of this\r\nprohibition in the Bill of Rights. It is said that it is a public\r\ncorporation and public property; that the trustees have no greater\r\ninterest in it than any other individuals; that it is not private\r\nproperty, which they can sell or transmit to their heirs, and that\r\ntherefore they have no interest in it; that their office is a public\r\ntrust, like that of the Governor or a judge, and that they have no more\r\nconcern in the property of the college than the Governor in the\r\nproperty of the State, or than the judges in the fines which they\r\nimpose on the culprits at their bar; that it is nothing to them whether\r\ntheir powers shall be extended or lessened, any more than it is to\r\ntheir honors whether their jurisdiction shall be enlarged or\r\ndiminished. It is necessary, therefore, to inquire into the true nature\r\nand character of the corporation which was created by the charter of\r\n1769.\r\n\r\nThere are divers sorts of corporations; and it may be safely admitted\r\nthat the legislature has more power over some than others. Some\r\ncorporations are for government and political arrangement; such, for\r\nexample, as cities, counties, and towns in New England. These may be\r\nchanged and modified as public convenience may require, due regard\r\nbeing always had to the rights of property. Of such corporations, all\r\nwho live within the limits are of course obliged to be members, and to\r\nsubmit to the duties which the law imposes on them as such. Other civil\r\ncorporations are for the advancement of trade and business, such as\r\nbanks, insurance companies, and the like. These are created, not by\r\ngeneral law, but usually by grant. Their constitution is special. It is\r\nsuch as the legislature sees fit to give, and the grantees to accept.\r\n\r\nThe corporation in question is not a civil, although it is a lay\r\ncorporation. It is an eleemosynary corporation. It is a private\r\ncharity, originally founded and endowed by an individual, with a\r\ncharter obtained for it at his request, for the better administration\r\nof his charity. \"The eleemosynary sort of corporations are such as are\r\nconstituted for the perpetual distributions of the free alms or bounty\r\nof the founder of them, to such persons as he has directed. Of this are\r\nall hospitals for the maintenance of the poor, sick, and impotent; and\r\nall colleges both in our universities and out of them.\" Eleemosynary\r\ncorporations are for the management of private property, according to\r\nthe will of the donors. They are private corporations. A college is as\r\nmuch a private corporation as a hospital; especially a college founded,\r\nas this was, by private bounty. A college is a charity. \"The\r\nestablishment of learning,\" says Lord Hardwicke, \"is a charity, and so\r\nconsidered in the statute of Elizabeth. To devise to a college, for\r\ntheir benefit, is a laudable charity, and deserves encouragement.\"\r\n\r\nThe legal signification of _a charity_ is derived chiefly from the\r\nstatute 43 Eliz. ch. 4. \"Those purposes,\" says Sir William Grant, \"are\r\nconsidered _charitable_ which that statute enumerates.\" Colleges are\r\nenumerated as charities in that statute. The government, in these\r\ncases, lends its aid to perpetuate the beneficent intention of the\r\ndonor, by granting a charter under which his private charity shall\r\ncontinue to be dispensed after his death. This is done either by\r\nincorporating the objects of the charity, as, for instance, the\r\nscholars in a college or the poor in a hospital, or by incorporating\r\nthose who are to be governors or trustees of the charity. In cases of\r\nthe first sort, the founder is, by the common law, visitor. In early\r\ntimes it became a maxim, that he who gave the property might regulate\r\nit in future. \"Cujus est dare, ejus est disponere.\" This right of\r\nvisitation descended from the founder to his heir as a right of\r\nproperty, and precisely as his other property went to his heir; and in\r\ndefault of heirs it went to the king, as all other property goes to the\r\nking for the want of heirs. The right of visitation arises from the\r\nproperty. It grows out of the endowment. The founder may, if he please,\r\npart with it at the time when he establishes the charity, and may vest\r\nit in others. Therefore, if he chooses that governors, trustees, or\r\noverseers should be appointed in the charter, he may cause it to be\r\ndone, and his power of visitation may be transferred to them, instead\r\nof descending to his heirs. The persons thus assigned or appointed by\r\nthe founder will be visitors, with all the powers of the founder, in\r\nexclusion of his heir. The right of visitation, then, accrues to them,\r\nas a matter of property, by the gift, transfer, or appointment of the\r\nfounder. This is a private right, which they can assert in all legal\r\nmodes, and in which they have the same protection of the law as in all\r\nother rights. As visitors they may make rules, ordinances, and\r\nstatutes, and alter and repeal them, as far as permitted so to do by\r\nthe charter. Although the charter proceeds from the crown or the\r\ngovernment, it is considered as the will of the donor. It is obtained\r\nat his request. He uses it as the rule which is to prevail in the\r\ndispensation of his bounty in all future times. The king or government\r\nwhich grants the charter is not thereby the founder, but he who\r\nfurnishes the funds. The gift of the revenues is the foundation.\r\n\r\nThe leading case on this subject is _Phillips v. Bury_. This was an\r\nejectment brought to recover the rectory-house, &c. of Exeter College\r\nin Oxford. The question was whether the plaintiff or defendant was\r\nlegal rector. Exeter College was founded by an individual, and\r\nincorporated by a charter granted by Queen Elizabeth. The controversy\r\nturned upon the power of the visitor, and, in the discussion of the\r\ncause, the nature of college charters and corporations was very fully\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nLord Holt's judgment is that that college was a _private corporation_,\r\nand that the founder had a right to appoint a visitor, and to give him\r\nsuch power as he saw fit.\r\n\r\nThe learned Bishop Stillingfleet's argument in the same cause, as a\r\nmember of the House of Lords, when it was there heard, exhibits very\r\nclearly the nature of colleges and similar corporations. It is to the\r\nfollowing effect. \"That colleges, although founded by private persons,\r\nare yet incorporated by the king's charter; but although the kings by\r\ntheir charter made the colleges to be such in law, that is, to be legal\r\ncorporations, yet they left to the particular founders authority to\r\nappoint what statutes they thought fit for the regulation of them. And\r\nnot only the statutes, but the appointment of visitors, was left to\r\nthem, and the manner of government, and the several conditions on which\r\nany persons were to be made or continue partakers of their bounty.\"\r\n\r\nThese opinions received the sanction of the House of Lords, and they\r\nseem to be settled and undoubted law.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing better established,\" says Lord Commissioner Eyre,\r\n\"than that this court does not entertain a general jurisdiction, or\r\nregulate and control charities _established by charter_. There the\r\nestablishment is fixed and determined; and the court has no power to\r\nvary it. If the governors established for the regulation of it are not\r\nthose who have the management of the revenue, this court has no\r\njurisdiction, and if it is ever so much abused, as far as it respects\r\nthe jurisdiction of this court it is without remedy; but if those\r\nestablished as governors have also the management of the revenues, this\r\ncourt does assume a jurisdiction of necessity, so far as they are to be\r\nconsidered as trustees of the revenue.\"\r\n\r\n\"The foundations of colleges,\" says Lord Mansfield, \"are to be\r\nconsidered in two views; namely, as they are _corporations_ and as they\r\nare _eleemosynary_. As eleemosynary, they are the creatures of the\r\nfounder; he may delegate his power, either generally or specially; he\r\nmay prescribe particular modes and manners, as to the exercise of part\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\nIn New England, and perhaps throughout the United States, eleemosynary\r\ncorporations have been generally established by incorporating\r\ngovernors, or trustees, and vesting in them the right of visitation.\r\nThe case before the court is clearly that of an eleemosynary\r\ncorporation. It is, in the strictest legal sense, a private charity. In\r\n_King v. St. Catherine's Hall_, that college is called a private\r\neleemosynary lay corporation. It was endowed by a private founder, and\r\nincorporated by letters patent. And in the same manner was Dartmouth\r\nCollege founded and incorporated. Dr. Wheelock is declared by the\r\ncharter to be its founder. It was established by him, or funds\r\ncontributed and collected by himself.\r\n\r\nAs such founder, he had a right of visitation, which he assigned to the\r\ntrustees, and they received it by his consent and appointment, and held\r\nit under the charter. He appointed these trustees visitors, and in that\r\nrespect to take place of his heir; as he might have appointed devisees,\r\nto take his estate instead of his heir. Little, probably, did he think,\r\nat that time, that the legislature would ever take away this property\r\nand these privileges, and give them to others. Little did he suppose\r\nthat this charter secured to him and his successors no legal rights.\r\nLittle did the other donors think so. If they had, the college would\r\nhave been, what the university is now, a thing upon paper, existing\r\nonly in name.\r\n\r\nThe numerous academies in New England have been established\r\nsubstantially in the same manner. They hold their property by the same\r\ntenure, and no other. Nor has Harvard College any surer title than\r\nDartmouth College. It may to-day have more friends; but to-morrow it\r\nmay have more enemies. Its legal rights are the same. So also of Yale\r\nCollege; and, indeed, of all the others. When the legislature gives to\r\nthese institutions, it may and does accompany its grants with such\r\nconditions as it pleases. The grant of lands by the legislature of New\r\nHampshire to Dartmouth College, in 1789, was accompanied with various\r\nconditions. When donations are made, by the legislature or others, to a\r\ncharity already existing, without any condition, or the specification\r\nof any new use, the donation follows the nature of the charity. Hence\r\nthe doctrine, that all eleemosynary corporations are private bodies.\r\nThey are founded by private persons, and on private property. The\r\npublic cannot be charitable in these institutions. It is not the money\r\nof the public, but of private persons, which is dispensed. It may be\r\npublic, that is general, in its uses and advantages; and the State may\r\nvery laudably add contributions of its own to the funds; but it is\r\nstill private in the tenure of the property, and in the right of\r\nadministering the funds.\r\n\r\nThe charter declares that the powers conferred on the trustees are\r\n\"privileges, advantages, liberties, and immunities\"; and that they\r\nshall be for ever holden by them and their successors. The New\r\nHampshire Bill of Rights declares that no one shall be deprived of his\r\n\"property, privileges, or immunities,\" but by judgment of his peers, or\r\nthe law of the land. The argument on the other side is, that, although\r\nthese terms may mean something in the Bill of Rights, they mean nothing\r\nin this charter. They are equivalent with _franchises_. Blackstone says\r\nthat _franchise_ and _liberty_ are used as synonymous terms.\r\n\r\nThe privilege, then, of being a member of a corporation, under a lawful\r\ngrant, and of exercising the rights and powers of such member, is such\r\na privilege, _liberty_, or _franchise_, as has been the object of legal\r\nprotection, and the subject of a legal interest, from the time of Magna\r\nCharta to the present moment. The plaintiffs have such an interest in\r\nthis corporation, individually, as they could assert and maintain in a\r\ncourt of law, not as agents of the public, but in their own right. Each\r\ntrustee has a _franchise_, and if he be disturbed in the enjoyment of\r\nit, he would have redress, on appealing to the law, as promptly as for\r\nany other injury. If the other trustees should conspire against any one\r\nof them to prevent his equal right and voice in the appointment of a\r\npresident or professor, or in the passing of any statute or ordinance\r\nof the college, he would be entitled to his action, for depriving him\r\nof his franchise. It makes no difference, that this property is to be\r\nholden and administered, and these franchises exercised, for the\r\npurpose of diffusing learning. No principle and no case establishes any\r\nsuch distinction. The public may be benefited by the use of this\r\nproperty. But this does not change the nature of the property, or the\r\nrights of the owners. The object of the charter may be public good; so\r\nit is in all other corporations; and this would as well justify the\r\nresumption or violation of the grant in any other case as in this. In\r\nthe case of an advowson, the use is public, and the right cannot be\r\nturned to any private benefit or emolument. It is nevertheless a legal\r\nprivate right, and the _property_ of the owner, as emphatically as his\r\nfreehold. The rights and privileges of trustees, visitors, or governors\r\nof incorporated colleges, stand on the same foundation. They are so\r\nconsidered, both by Lord Holt and Lord Hardwicke.\r\n\r\nTo contend that the rights of the plaintiffs may be taken away, because\r\nthey derive from them no pecuniary benefit or private emolument, or\r\nbecause they cannot be transmitted to their heirs, or would not be\r\nassets to pay their debts, is taking an extremely narrow view of the\r\nsubject. According to this notion, the case would be different, if, in\r\nthe charter, they had stipulated for a commission on the disbursement\r\nof the funds; and they have ceased to have any interest in the\r\nproperty, because they have undertaken to administer it gratuitously.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be necessary to say much in refutation of the idea, that\r\nthere cannot be a legal interest, or ownership, in any thing which does\r\nnot yield a pecuniary profit; as if the law regarded no rights but the\r\nrights of money, and of visible, tangible property. Of what nature are\r\nall rights of suffrage? No elector has a particular personal interest;\r\nbut each has a legal right, to be exercised at his own discretion, and\r\nit cannot be taken away from him. The exercise of this right directly\r\nand very materially affects the public; much more so than the exercise\r\nof the privileges of a trustee of this college. Consequences of the\r\nutmost magnitude may sometimes depend on the exercise of the right of\r\nsuffrage by one or a few electors. Nobody was ever yet heard to\r\ncontend, however, that on that account the public might take away the\r\nright, or impair it. This notion appears to be borrowed from no better\r\nsource than the repudiated doctrine of the three judges in the\r\nAylesbury case. The doctrine having been exploded for a century, seems\r\nnow for the first time to be revived.\r\n\r\nIndividuals have a right to use their own property for purposes of\r\nbenevolence, either towards the public, or towards other individuals.\r\nThey have a right to exercise this benevolence in such lawful manner as\r\nthey may choose; and when the government has induced and excited it, by\r\ncontracting to give perpetuity to the stipulated manner of exercising\r\nit, it is not law, but violence, to rescind this contract, and seize on\r\nthe property. Whether the State will grant these franchises, and under\r\nwhat conditions it will grant them, it decides for itself. But when\r\nonce granted, the constitution holds them to be sacred, till forfeited\r\nfor just cause.\r\n\r\nThat all property, of which the use may be beneficial to the public,\r\nbelongs therefore to the public, is quite a new doctrine. It has no\r\nprecedent, and is supported by no known principle. Dr. Wheelock might\r\nhave answered his purposes, in this case, by executing a private deed\r\nof trust. He might have conveyed his property to trustees, for\r\nprecisely such uses as are described in this charter. Indeed, it\r\nappears that he had contemplated the establishing of his school in that\r\nmanner, and had made his will, and devised the property to the same\r\npersons who were afterwards appointed trustees in the charter. Many\r\nliterary and other charitable institutions are founded in that manner,\r\nand the trust is renewed, and conferred on other persons, from time to\r\ntime, as occasion may require. In such a case, no lawyer would or could\r\nsay, that the legislature might divest the trustees, constituted by\r\ndeed or will, seize upon the property, and give it to other persons,\r\nfor other purposes. And does the granting of a charter, which is only\r\ndone to perpetuate the trust in a more convenient manner, make any\r\ndifference? Does or can this change the nature of the charity, and turn\r\nit into a public political corporation? Happily, we are not without\r\nauthority on this point. It has been considered and adjudged. Lord\r\nHardwicke says, in so many words, \"The charter of the crown cannot make\r\na charity more or less public, but only more permanent than it would\r\notherwise be.\"\r\n\r\nThe granting of the corporation is but making the trust perpetual, and\r\ndoes not alter the nature of the charity. The very object sought in\r\nobtaining such charter, and in giving property to such a corporation,\r\nis to make and keep it private property, and to clothe it with all the\r\nsecurity and inviolability of private property. The intent is, that\r\nthere shall be a legal private ownership, and that the legal owners\r\nshall maintain and protect the property, for the benefit of those for\r\nwhose use it was designed. Who ever endowed the public? Who ever\r\nappointed a legislature to administer his charity? Or who ever heard,\r\nbefore, that a gift to a college, or a hospital, or an asylum, was, in\r\nreality, nothing but a gift to the State?\r\n\r\nThe State of Vermont is a principal donor to Dartmouth College. The\r\nlands given lie in that State. This appears in the special verdict. Is\r\nVermont to be considered as having intended a gift to the State of New\r\nHampshire in this case, as, it has been said, is to be the reasonable\r\nconstruction of all donations to the college? The legislature of New\r\nHampshire affects to represent the public, and therefore claims a right\r\nto control all property destined to public use. What hinders Vermont\r\nfrom considering herself equally the representative of the public, and\r\nfrom resuming her grants, at her own pleasure? Her right to do so is\r\nless doubtful than the power of New Hampshire to pass the laws in\r\nquestion. I hope enough has been said to show that the trustees\r\npossessed vested liberties, privileges, and immunities, under this\r\ncharter; and that such liberties, privileges, and immunities, being\r\nonce lawfully obtained and vested, are as inviolable as any vested\r\nrights of property whatever. Rights to do certain acts, such, for\r\ninstance, as the visitation and superintendence of a college and the\r\nappointment of its officers, may surely be vested rights, to all legal\r\nintents, as completely as the right to possess property. A late learned\r\njudge of this court has said, \"When I say that a _right_ is vested in a\r\ncitizen, I mean that he has the power to do _certain actions_, or to\r\npossess _certain things_, according to the law of the land.\"\r\n\r\nIf such be the true nature of the plaintiffs' interests under this\r\ncharter, what are the articles in the New Hampshire Bill of Rights\r\nwhich these acts infringe?\r\n\r\nThey infringe the second article; which says, that the citizens of the\r\nState have a right to hold and possess property. The plaintiffs had a\r\nlegal property in this charter; and they had acquired property under\r\nit. The acts deprive them of both. They impair and take away the\r\ncharter; and they appropriate the property to new uses, against their\r\nconsent. The plaintiffs cannot now hold the property acquired by\r\nthemselves, and which this article says they have a right to hold.\r\n\r\nThey infringe the twentieth article. By that article it is declared\r\nthat, in questions of property, there is a right to trial. The\r\nplaintiffs are divested, without trial or judgment.\r\n\r\nThey infringe the twenty-third article. It is therein declared that no\r\nretrospective laws shall be passed. This article bears directly on the\r\ncase. These acts must be deemed to be retrospective, within the settled\r\nconstruction of that term. What a retrospective law is, has been\r\ndecided, on the construction of this very article, in the Circuit Court\r\nfor the First Circuit, The learned judge of that circuit says: \"Every\r\nstatute which takes away or impairs vested rights, acquired under\r\nexisting laws, must be deemed retrospective.\" That all such laws are\r\nretrospective was decided also in the case of _Dash v. Van Kleek_,\r\nwhere a most learned judge quotes this article from the constitution of\r\nNew Hampshire, with manifest approbation, as a plain and clear\r\nexpression of those fundamental and unalterable principles of justice,\r\nwhich must lie at the foundation of every free and just system of laws.\r\nCan any man deny that the plaintiffs had rights, under the charter,\r\nwhich were legally vested, and that by these acts those rights are\r\nimpaired?\r\n\r\n\"It is a principle in the English law,\" says Chief Justice Kent, in the\r\ncase last cited, \"as ancient as the law itself, that a statute, even of\r\nits omnipotent Parliament, is not to have a retrospective effect. 'Nova\r\nconstitutio futuris formam imponere debet, et non praeteritis.' The\r\nmaxim in Bracton was taken from the civil law, for we find in that\r\nsystem the same principle, expressed substantially in the same words,\r\nthat the law-giver cannot alter his mind to the prejudice of a vested\r\nright. 'Nemo potest mutare concilium suum in alterius injuriam.'\"\r\n\r\nThese acts infringe also the thirty-seventh article of the constitution\r\nof New Hampshire; which says, that the powers of government shall be\r\nkept separate. By these acts, the legislature assumes to exercise a\r\njudicial power. It declares a forfeiture, and resumes franchises, once\r\ngranted, without trial or hearing.\r\n\r\nIf the constitution be not altogether waste-paper, it has restrained\r\nthe power of the legislature in these particulars. If it has any\r\nmeaning, it is that the legislature shall pass no act directly and\r\nmanifestly impairing private property and private privileges. It shall\r\nnot judge by act. It shall not decide by act. It shall not deprive by\r\nact. But it shall leave all these things to be tried and adjudged by\r\nthe law of the land.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth article has been referred to before. It declares that no\r\none shall be \"deprived of his property, immunities, or privileges, but\r\nby the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.\" Notwithstanding\r\nthe light in which the learned judges in New Hampshire viewed the\r\nrights of the plaintiffs under the charter, and which has been before\r\nadverted to, it is found to be admitted in their opinion, that those\r\nrights are privileges within the meaning of this fifteenth article of\r\nthe Bill of Rights. Having quoted that article, they say: \"That the\r\nright to manage the affairs of this college is a privilege, within the\r\nmeaning of this clause of the Bill of Rights, is not to be doubted.\" In\r\nmy humble opinion, this surrenders the point. To resist the effect of\r\nthis admission, however, the learned judges add: \"But how a privilege\r\ncan be protected from the operation of the law of the land by a clause\r\nin the constitution, declaring that it shall not be taken away but by\r\nthe law of the land, is not very easily understood.\" This answer goes\r\non the ground, that the acts in question are laws of the land, within\r\nthe meaning of the constitution. If they be so, the argument drawn from\r\nthis article is fully answered. If they be not so, it being admitted\r\nthat the plaintiffs' rights are \"privileges,\" within the meaning of the\r\narticle, the argument is not answered, and the article is infringed by\r\nthe acts. Are, then, these acts of the legislature, which affect only\r\nparticular persons and their particular privileges, laws of the land?\r\nLord Coke citing and commenting on the celebrated twenty-ninth chapter\r\nof Magna Charta, says: \"No man shall be disseized, &c., unless it be by\r\nthe lawful judgment, that is, verdict of equals, or by the law of the\r\nland, that is (to speak it once for all), by the due course and process\r\nof law.\" Have the plaintiffs lost their franchises by \"due course and\r\nprocess of law\"? On the contrary, are not these acts \"particular acts\r\nof the legislature, which have no relation to the community in general,\r\nand which are rather sentences than laws\"?\r\n\r\nBy the law of the land is most clearly intended the general law; a law\r\nwhich hears before it condemns; which proceeds upon inquiry, and\r\nrenders judgment only after trial. The meaning is, that every citizen\r\nshall hold his life, liberty, property, and immunities under the\r\nprotection of the general rules which govern society. Every thing which\r\nmay pass under the form of an enactment is not therefore to be\r\nconsidered the law of the land. If this were so, acts of attainder,\r\nbills of pains and penalties, acts of confiscation, acts reversing\r\njudgments, and acts directly transferring one man's estate to another,\r\nlegislative judgments, decrees, and forfeitures in all possible forms,\r\nwould be the law of the land.\r\n\r\nSuch a strange construction would render constitutional provisions of\r\nthe highest importance completely inoperative and void. It would tend\r\ndirectly to establish the union of all powers in the legislature. There\r\nwould be no general, permanent law for courts to administer or men to\r\nlive under. The administration of justice would be an empty form, an\r\nidle ceremony. Judges would sit to execute legislative judgments and\r\ndecrees; not to declare the law or to administer the justice of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThat the power of electing and appointing the officers of this college\r\nis not only a right of the trustees as a corporation, generally, and in\r\nthe aggregate, but that each individual trustee has also his own\r\nindividual franchise in such right of election and appointment, is\r\naccording to the language of all the authorities. Lord Holt says: \"It\r\nis agreeable to reason and the rules of law, that a franchise should be\r\nvested in the corporation aggregate, and yet the benefit of it to\r\nredound to the particular members, and to be enjoyed by them in their\r\nprivate capacity. Where the privilege of election is used by particular\r\npersons, _it is a particular right, vested in every particular man_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also to be considered, that the president and professors of this\r\ncollege have rights to be affected by these acts. Their interest is\r\nsimilar to that of fellows in the English colleges; because they derive\r\ntheir living, wholly or in part, from the founders' bounty. The\r\npresident is one of the trustees or corporators. The professors are not\r\nnecessarily members of the corporation; but they are appointed by the\r\ntrustees, are removable only by them, and have fixed salaries payable\r\nout of the general funds of the college. Both president and professors\r\nhave freeholds in their offices; subject only to be removed by the\r\ntrustees, as their legal visitors, for good cause. All the authorities\r\nspeak of fellowships in colleges as freeholds, notwithstanding the\r\nfellows may be liable to be suspended or removed, for misbehavior, by\r\ntheir constituted visitors.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been less expected, in this age, than that there\r\nshould have been an attempt, by acts of the legislature, to take away\r\nthese college livings, the inadequate but the only support of literary\r\nmen who have devoted their lives to the instruction of youth. The\r\npresident and professors were appointed by the twelve trustees. They\r\nwere accountable to nobody else, and could be removed by nobody else.\r\nThey accepted their offices on this tenure. Yet the legislature has\r\nappointed other persons, with power to remove these officers and to\r\ndeprive them of their livings; and those other persons have exercised\r\nthat power. No description of private property has been regarded as\r\nmore sacred than college livings. They are the estates and freeholds of\r\na most deserving class of men; of scholars who have consented to forego\r\nthe advantages of professional and public employments, and to devote\r\nthemselves to science and literature and the instruction of youth in\r\nthe quiet retreats of academic life. Whether to dispossess and oust\r\nthem; to deprive them of their office, and to turn them out of their\r\nlivings; to do this, not by the power of their legal visitors or\r\ngovernors, but by acts of the legislature, and to do it without\r\nforfeiture and without fault; whether all this be not in the highest\r\ndegree an indefensible and arbitrary proceeding, is a question of which\r\nthere would seem to be but one side fit for a lawyer or a scholar to\r\nespouse.\r\n\r\nIf it could be made to appear that the trustees and the president and\r\nprofessors held their offices and franchises during the pleasure of the\r\nlegislature, and that the property holden belonged to the State, then\r\nindeed the legislature have done no more than they had a right to do.\r\nBut this is not so. The charter is a charter of privileges and\r\nimmunities; and these are holden by the trustees expressly against the\r\nState for ever.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that the State, by its courts of law, can enforce the\r\nwill of the donor, and compel a faithful execution of the trust. The\r\nplaintiffs claim no exemption from legal responsibility. They hold\r\nthemselves at all times answerable to the law of the land, for their\r\nconduct in the trust committed to them. They ask only to hold the\r\nproperty of which they are owners, and the franchises which belong to\r\nthem, until they shall be found, by due course and process of law, to\r\nhave forfeited them.\r\n\r\nIt can make no difference whether the legislature exercise the power it\r\nhas assumed by removing the trustees and the president and professors,\r\ndirectly and by name, or by appointing others to expel them. The\r\nprinciple is the same, and in point of fact the result has been the\r\nsame. If the entire franchise cannot be taken away, neither can it be\r\nessentially impaired. If the trustees are legal owners of the property,\r\nthey are sole owners. If they are visitors, they are sole visitors. No\r\none will be found to say, that, if the legislature may do what it has\r\ndone, it may not do any thing and every thing which it may choose to\r\ndo, relative to the property of the corporation, and the privileges of\r\nits members and officers.\r\n\r\nIf the view which has been taken of this question be at all correct,\r\nthis was an eleemosynary corporation, a private charity. The property\r\nwas private property. The trustees were visitors, and the right to hold\r\nthe charter, administer the funds, and visit and govern the college,\r\nwas a franchise and privilege, solemnly granted to them. The use being\r\npublic in no way diminishes their legal estate in the property, or\r\ntheir title to the franchise. There is no principle, nor any case,\r\nwhich declares that a gift to such a corporation is a gift to the\r\npublic. The acts in question violate property. They take away\r\nprivileges, immunities, and franchises. They deny to the trustees the\r\nprotection of the law; and they are retrospective in their operation.\r\nIn all which respects they are against the constitution of New\r\nHampshire.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs contend, in the second place, that the acts in question\r\nare repugnant to the tenth section of the first article of the\r\nConstitution of the United States. The material words of that section\r\nare: \"No State shall pass any bill of attainder, _ex post facto_ law,\r\nor law impairing the obligation of contracts.\"\r\n\r\nThe object of these most important provisions in the national\r\nconstitution has often been discussed, both here and elsewhere. It is\r\nexhibited with great clearness and force by one of the distinguished\r\npersons who framed that instrument. \"Bills of attainder, _ex post\r\nfacto_ laws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts, are\r\ncontrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every\r\nprinciple of sound legislation. The two former are expressly prohibited\r\nby the declarations prefixed to some of the State constitutions, and\r\nall of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these fundamental\r\ncharters. Our own experience has taught us, nevertheless, that\r\nadditional fences against these dangers ought not to be omitted. Very\r\nproperly, therefore, have the convention added this constitutional\r\nbulwark, in favor of personal security and private rights; and I am\r\nmuch deceived, if they have not, in so doing, as faithfully consulted\r\nthe genuine sentiments as the undoubted interests of their\r\nconstituents. The sober people of America are weary of the fluctuating\r\npolicy which has directed the public councils. They have seen with\r\nregret, and with indignation, that sudden changes, and legislative\r\ninterferences in cases affecting personal rights, become jobs in the\r\nhands of enterprising and influential speculators, and snares to the\r\nmore industrious and less informed part of the community. They have\r\nseen, too, that one legislative interference is but the link of a long\r\nchain of repetitions; every subsequent interference being naturally\r\nproduced by the effects of the preceding.\"\r\n\r\nIt has already been decided in this court, that a _grant_ is a\r\ncontract, within the meaning of this provision; and that a grant by a\r\nState is also a contract, as much as the grant of an individual. In the\r\ncase of _Fletcher v. Peck_, this court says: \"A contract is a compact\r\nbetween two or more parties, and is either executory or executed. An\r\nexecutory contract is one in which a party binds himself to do, or not\r\nto do, a particular thing; such was the law under which the conveyance\r\nwas made by the government. A contract executed is one in which the\r\nobject of contract is performed; and this, says Blackstone, differs in\r\nnothing from a grant. The contract between Georgia and the purchasers\r\nwas executed by the grant. A contract executed, as well as one which is\r\nexecutory, contains obligations binding on the parties. A grant, in its\r\nown nature, amounts to an extinguishment of the right of the grantor,\r\nand implies a contract not to reassert that right. If, under a fair\r\nconstruction of the Constitution, grants are comprehended under the\r\nterm contracts, is a grant from the State excluded from the operation\r\nof the provision? Is the clause to be considered as inhibiting the\r\nState from impairing the obligation of contracts between two\r\nindividuals, but as excluding from that inhibition contracts made with\r\nitself? The words themselves contain no such distinction. They are\r\ngeneral, and are applicable to contracts of every description. If\r\ncontracts made with the State are to be exempted from their operation,\r\nthe exception must arise from the character of the contracting party,\r\nnot from the words which are employed. Whatever respect might have been\r\nfelt for the State sovereignties, it is not to be disguised that the\r\nframers of the Constitution viewed with some apprehension the violent\r\nacts which might grow out of the feelings of the moment; and that the\r\npeople of the United States, in adopting that instrument, have\r\nmanifested a determination to shield themselves and their property from\r\nthe effects of those sudden and strong passions to which men are\r\nexposed. The restrictions on the legislative power of the States are\r\nobviously founded in this sentiment; and the Constitution of the United\r\nStates contains what may be deemed a bill of rights for the people of\r\neach State.\"\r\n\r\nIt also has been decided that a grant by a State before the Revolution\r\nis as much to be protected as a grant since. But the case of _Terrett\r\nv. Taylor_, before cited, is of all others most pertinent to the\r\npresent argument. Indeed, the judgment of the court in that case seems\r\nto leave little to be argued or decided in this. \"A private\r\ncorporation,\" say the court, \"created by the legislature, may lose its\r\nfranchises by a _misuser_ or a _nonuser_ of them; and they may be\r\nresumed by the government under a judicial judgment upon a _quo\r\nwarranto_ to ascertain and enforce the forfeiture. This is the common\r\nlaw of the land, and is a tacit condition annexed to the creation of\r\nevery such corporation. Upon a change of government, too, it may be\r\nadmitted, that such exclusive privileges attached to a private\r\ncorporation as are inconsistent with the new government may be\r\nabolished. In respect, also, to _public_ corporations which exist only\r\nfor public purposes, such as counties, towns, cities, and so forth, the\r\nlegislature may, under proper limitations, have a right to change,\r\nmodify, enlarge, or restrain them, securing, however, the property for\r\nthe uses of those for whom and at whose expense it was originally\r\npurchased. But that the legislature can repeal statutes creating\r\nprivate corporations, or confirming to them property already acquired\r\nunder the faith of previous laws, and by such repeal can vest the\r\nproperty of such corporations exclusively in the State, or dispose of\r\nthe same to such purposes as they please, without the consent or\r\ndefault of the corporators, we are not prepared to admit; and we think\r\nourselves standing upon the principles of natural justice, upon the\r\nfundamental laws of every free government, upon the spirit and letter\r\nof the Constitution of the United States, and upon the decisions of\r\nmost respectable judicial tribunals, in resisting such a doctrine.\"\r\n\r\nThis court, then, does not admit the doctrine, that a legislature can\r\nrepeal statutes creating private corporations. If it cannot repeal them\r\naltogether, of course it cannot repeal any part of them, or impair\r\nthem, or essentially alter them, without the consent of the\r\ncorporators. If, therefore, it has been shown that this college is to\r\nbe regarded as a private charity, this case is embraced within the very\r\nterms of that decision. A grant of corporate powers and privileges is\r\nas much a contract as a grant of land. What proves all charters of this\r\nsort to be contracts is, that they must be accepted to give them force\r\nand effect. If they are not accepted, they are void. And in the case of\r\nan existing corporation, if a new charter is given it, it may even\r\naccept part and reject the rest. In _Rex v. Vice-Chancellor of\r\nCambridge_, Lord Mansfield says: \"There is a vast deal of difference\r\nbetween a new charter granted to a new corporation, (who must take it\r\nas it is given,) and a new charter given to a corporation already in\r\nbeing, and acting either under a former charter or under prescriptive\r\nusage. The latter, a corporation already existing, are not obliged to\r\naccept the new charter _in toto_, and to receive either all or none of\r\nit; they may act partly under it, and partly under their old charter or\r\nprescription. The validity of these new charters must turn upon the\r\nacceptance of them.\" In the same case Mr. Justice Wilmot says: \"It is\r\nthe concurrence and acceptance of the university that gives the force\r\nto the charter of the crown.\" In the _King v. Pasmore_, Lord Kenyon\r\nobserves: \"Some things are clear: when a corporation exists capable of\r\ndischarging its functions, the crown cannot obtrude another charter\r\nupon them; they may either accept or reject it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd because charters of incorporation are of the nature of contracts,\r\nthey cannot be altered or varied but by consent of the original\r\nparties. If a charter be granted by the king, it may be altered by a\r\nnew charter granted by the king, and accepted by the corporators. But\r\nif the first charter be granted by Parliament, the consent of\r\nParliament must be obtained to any alteration. In _King v. Miller_,\r\nLord Kenyon says: \"Where a corporation takes its rise from the king's\r\ncharter, the king by granting, and the corporation by accepting another\r\ncharter, may alter it, because it is done with the consent of all the\r\nparties who are competent to consent to the alteration.\"\r\n\r\nThere are, in this case, all the essential constituent parts of a\r\ncontract. There is something to be contracted about, there are parties,\r\nand there are plain terms in which the agreement of the parties on the\r\nsubject of the contract is expressed. There are mutual considerations\r\nand inducements. The charter recites, that the founder, on his part,\r\nhas agreed to establish his seminary in New Hampshire, and to enlarge\r\nit beyond its original design, among other things, for the benefit of\r\nthat Province; and thereupon a charter is given to him and his\r\nassociates, designated by himself, promising and assuring to them,\r\nunder the plighted faith of the State, the right of governing the\r\ncollege and administering its concerns in the manner provided in the\r\ncharter. There is a complete and perfect grant to them of all the power\r\nof superintendence, visitation, and government. Is not this a contract?\r\nIf lands or money had been granted to him and his associates, for the\r\nsame purposes, such grant could not be rescinded. And is there any\r\ndifference, in legal contemplation, between a grant of corporate\r\nfranchises and a grant of tangible property? No such difference is\r\nrecognized in any decided case, nor does it exist in the common\r\napprehension of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore contended, that this case falls within the true meaning\r\nof this provision of the Constitution, as expounded in the decisions of\r\nthis court; that the charter of 1769 is a contract, a stipulation or\r\nagreement, mutual in its considerations, express and formal in its\r\nterms, and of a most binding and solemn nature. That the acts in\r\nquestion impair this contract, has already been sufficiently shown.\r\nThey repeal and abrogate its most essential parts.\r\n\r\nA single observation may not be improper on the opinion of the court of\r\nNew Hampshire, which has been published. The learned judges who\r\ndelivered that opinion have viewed this question in a very different\r\nlight from that in which the plaintiffs have endeavored to exhibit it.\r\nAfter some general remarks, they assume that this college is a public\r\ncorporation; and on this basis their judgment rests. Whether all\r\ncolleges are not regarded as private and eleemosynary corporations, by\r\nall law writers and all judicial decisions; whether this college was\r\nnot founded by Dr. Wheelock; whether the charter was not granted at his\r\nrequest, the better to execute a trust, which he had already created;\r\nwhether he and his associates did not become visitors, by the charter;\r\nand whether Dartmouth College be not, therefore, in the strictest\r\nsense, a private charity, are questions which the learned judges do not\r\nappear to have discussed.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted in that opinion, that, if it be a private corporation,\r\nits rights stand on the same ground as those of an individual. The\r\ngreat question, therefore, to be decided is, To which class of\r\ncorporations do colleges thus founded belong? And the plaintiffs have\r\nendeavored to satisfy the court, that, according to the well-settled\r\nprinciples and uniform decisions of law, they are private, eleemosynary\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nMuch has heretofore been said on the necessity of admitting such a\r\npower in the legislature as has been assumed in this case. Many cases\r\nof possible evil have been imagined, which might otherwise be without\r\nremedy. Abuses, it is contended, might arise in the management of such\r\ninstitutions, which the ordinary courts of law would be unable to\r\ncorrect. But this is only another instance of that habit of supposing\r\nextreme cases, and then of reasoning from them, which is the constant\r\nrefuge of those who are obliged to defend a cause, which, upon its\r\nmerits, is indefensible. It would be sufficient to say in answer, that\r\nit is not pretended that there was here any such case of necessity. But\r\na still more satisfactory answer is, that the apprehension of danger is\r\ngroundless, and therefore the whole argument fails. Experience has not\r\ntaught us that there is danger of great evils or of great inconvenience\r\nfrom this source. Hitherto, neither in our own country nor elsewhere\r\nhave such cases of necessity occurred. The judicial establishments of\r\nthe State are presumed to be competent to prevent abuses and violations\r\nof trust, in cases of this kind, as well as in all others. If they be\r\nnot, they are imperfect, and their amendment would be a most proper\r\nsubject for legislative wisdom. Under the government and protection of\r\nthe general laws of the land, these institutions have always been found\r\nsafe, as well as useful. They go on, with the progress of society,\r\naccommodating themselves easily, without sudden change or violence, to\r\nthe alterations which take place in its condition, and in the\r\nknowledge, the habits, and pursuits of men. The English colleges were\r\nfounded in Catholic ages. Their religion was reformed with the general\r\nreformation of the nation; and they are suited perfectly well to the\r\npurpose of educating the Protestant youth of modern times. Dartmouth\r\nCollege was established under a charter granted by the Provincial\r\ngovernment; but a better constitution for a college or one more adapted\r\nto the condition of things under the present government, in all\r\nmaterial respects, could not now be framed. Nothing in it was found to\r\nneed alteration at the Revolution. The wise men of that day saw in it\r\none of the best hopes of future times, and commended it as it was, with\r\nparental care, to the protection and guardianship of the government of\r\nthe State. A charter of more liberal sentiments, of wiser provisions,\r\ndrawn with more care, or in a better spirit, could not be expected at\r\nany time or from any source. The college needed no change in its\r\norganization or government. That which it did need was the kindness,\r\nthe patronage, the bounty of the legislature; not a mock elevation to\r\nthe character of a university, without the solid benefit of a\r\nshilling's donation to sustain the character; not the swelling and\r\nempty authority of establishing institutes and other colleges. This\r\nunsubstantial pageantry would seem to have been in derision of the\r\nscanty endowment and limited means of an unobtrusive, but useful and\r\ngrowing seminary. Least of all was there a necessity, or pretence of\r\nnecessity, to infringe its legal rights, violate its franchises and\r\nprivileges, and pour upon it these overwhelming streams of litigation.\r\n\r\nBut this argument from necessity would equally apply in all other\r\ncases. If it be well founded, it would prove, that, whenever any\r\ninconvenience or evil is experienced from the restrictions imposed on\r\nthe legislature by the Constitution, these restrictions ought to be\r\ndisregarded. It is enough to say, that the people have thought\r\notherwise. They have, most wisely, chosen to take the risk of\r\noccasional inconvenience from the want of power, in order that there\r\nmight be a settled limit to its exercise, and a permanent security\r\nagainst its abuse. They have imposed prohibitions and restraints; and\r\nthey have not rendered these altogether vain and nugatory by conferring\r\nthe power of dispensation. If inconvenience should arise which the\r\nlegislature cannot remedy under the power conferred upon it, it is not\r\nanswerable for such inconvenience. That which it cannot do within the\r\nlimits prescribed to it, it cannot do at all. No legislature in this\r\ncountry is able, and may the time never come when it shall be able, to\r\napply to itself the memorable expression of a Roman pontiff: \"Licet hoc\r\n_de jure_ non possumus, volumus tamen _de plenitudine potestatis_.\"\r\n\r\nThe case before the court is not of ordinary importance, nor of\r\nevery-day occurrence. It affects not this college only, but every\r\ncollege, and all the literary institutions of the country. They have\r\nflourished hitherto, and have become in a high degree respectable and\r\nuseful to the community. They have all a common principle of existence,\r\nthe inviolability of their charters. It will be a dangerous, a most\r\ndangerous experiment, to hold these institutions subject to the rise\r\nand fall of popular parties, and the fluctuations of political\r\nopinions. If the franchise may be at any time taken away, or impaired,\r\nthe property also may be taken away, or its use perverted. Benefactors\r\nwill have no certainty of effecting the object of their bounty; and\r\nlearned men will be deterred from devoting themselves to the service of\r\nsuch institutions, from the precarious title of their offices. Colleges\r\nand halls will be deserted by all better spirits, and become a theatre\r\nfor the contentions of politics, Party and faction will be cherished in\r\nthe places consecrated to piety and learning. These consequences are\r\nneither remote nor possible only. They are certain and immediate.\r\n\r\nWhen the court in North Carolina declared the law of the State, which\r\nrepealed a grant to its university, unconstitutional and void, the\r\nlegislature had the candor and the wisdom to repeal the law. This\r\nexample, so honorable to the State which exhibited it, is most fit to\r\nbe followed on this occasion. And there is good reason to hope that a\r\nState, which has hitherto been so much distinguished for temperate\r\ncounsels, cautious legislation, and regard to law, will not fail to\r\nadopt a course which will accord with her highest and best interests,\r\nand in no small degree elevate her reputation. It was for many and\r\nobvious reasons most anxiously desired that the question of the power\r\nof the legislature over this charter should have been finally decided\r\nin the State court. An earnest hope was entertained that the judges of\r\nthe court might have viewed the case in a light favorable to the rights\r\nof the trustees. That hope has failed. It is here that those rights are\r\nnow to be maintained, or they are prostrated for ever. \"Omnia alia\r\nperfugia bonorum, subsidia, consilia, auxilia, jura ceciderunt. Quem\r\nenim alium appellem? quem obtester? quern implorem? Nisi hoc loco, nisi\r\napud vos, nisi per vos, judices, salutem nostram, quae spe exigua\r\nextremaque pendet, tenuerimus; nihil est praeterea quo confugere\r\npossimus.\" [1]\r\n\r\nThis, sir, is my case. It is the case, not merely of that humble\r\ninstitution, it is the case of every college in the land. It is more.\r\nIt is the case of every eleemosynary institution throughout our\r\ncountry--of all those great charities formed by the piety of our\r\nancestors, to alleviate human misery, and scatter blessings along the\r\npathway of life. It is more! It is, in some sense, the case of every\r\nman among us who has property, of which he may be stripped, for the\r\nquestion is simply this: Shall our State legislatures be allowed to\r\ntake that which is not their own, to turn it from its original use, and\r\napply it to such ends or purposes as they in their discretion shall see\r\nfit?\r\n\r\nSir, you may destroy this little institution; it is weak; it is in your\r\nhands! I know it is one of the lesser lights in the literary horizon of\r\nour country. You may put it out. But, if you do so, you must carry\r\nthrough your work! You must extinguish, one after another, all those\r\ngreater lights of science, which, for more than a century, have thrown\r\ntheir radiance over our land!\r\n\r\nIt is, sir, as I have said, a small college, and yet there are those\r\nwho love it. [2]\r\n\r\nSir, I know not how others may feel (glancing at the opponents of the\r\ncolleges before him), but for myself, when I see my Alma Mater\r\nsurrounded, like Caesar, in the senate house, by those who are\r\nreiterating stab after stab, I would not, for this right hand, have her\r\nturn to me, and say, _et tu quoque, mi fili! And thou too, my son!_ [3]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Settlement of New England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us rejoice that we behold this day. Let us be thankful that we have\r\nlived to see the bright and happy breaking of the auspicious morn,\r\nwhich commences the third century of the history of New England.\r\nAuspicious, indeed,--bringing a happiness beyond the common allotment\r\nof Providence to men,--full of present joy, and gilding with bright\r\nbeams the prospect of futurity, is the dawn that awakens us to the\r\ncommemoration of the landing of the Pilgrims.\r\n\r\nLiving at an epoch which naturally marks the progress of the history of\r\nour native land, we have come hither to celebrate the great event with\r\nwhich that history commenced.

For ever remembered the day which saw them, weary\r\nand distressed, broken in every thing but spirit, poor in all but faith\r\nand courage, at last secure from the dangers of wintry seas, and\r\nimpressing this shore with the first footsteps of civilized man!\r\n\r\nIt is a noble faculty of our nature which enables us to connect our\r\nthoughts, our sympathies, and our happiness with what is distant in\r\nplace or time; and, looking before and after, to hold communion at once\r\nwith our ancestors and our posterity. Human and mortal although we are,\r\nwe are nevertheless not mere insulated beings, without relation to the\r\npast or the future. Neither the point of time, nor the spot of earth,\r\nin which we physically live, bounds our rational and intellectual\r\nenjoyments. We live in the past by a knowledge of its history; and in\r\nthe future, by hope and anticipation. By ascending to an association\r\nwith our ancestors; by contemplating their example and studying their\r\ncharacter; by partaking their sentiments, and imbibing their spirit; by\r\naccompanying them in their toils, by sympathizing in their sufferings,\r\nand rejoicing in their successes and their triumphs; we seem to belong\r\nto their age, and to mingle our own existence with theirs. We become\r\ntheir contemporaries, live the lives which they lived, endure what they\r\nendured, and partake in the rewards which they enjoyed. And in like\r\nmanner, by running along the line of future time, by contemplating the\r\nprobable fortunes of those who are coming after us, by attempting\r\nsomething which may promote their happiness, and leave some not\r\ndishonorable memorial of ourselves for their regard, when we shall\r\nsleep with the fathers, we protract our own earthly being, and seem to\r\ncrowd whatever is future, as well as all that is past, into the narrow\r\ncompass of our earthly existence. As it is not a vain and false, but an\r\nexalted and religious imagination, which leads us to raise our thoughts\r\nfrom the orb, which, amidst this universe of worlds, the Creator has\r\ngiven us to inhabit, and to send them with something of the feeling\r\nwhich nature prompts, and teaches to be proper among children of the\r\nsame Eternal Parent, to the contemplation of the myriads of\r\nfellow-beings with which his goodness has peopled the infinite of\r\nspace; so neither is it false or vain to consider ourselves as\r\ninterested and connected with our whole race, through all time; allied\r\nto our ancestors; allied to our posterity; closely compacted on all\r\nsides with others; ourselves being but links in the great chain of\r\nbeing, which begins with the origin of our race, runs onward through\r\nits successive generations, binding together the past, the present, and\r\nthe future, and terminating at last, with the consummation of all\r\nthings earthly, at the throne of God.\r\n\r\nThere may be, and there often is, indeed, a regard for ancestry, which\r\nnourishes only a weak pride; as there is also a care for posterity,\r\nwhich only disguises an habitual avarice, or hides the workings of a\r\nlow and grovelling vanity. But there is also a moral and philosophical\r\nrespect for our ancestors, which elevates the character and improves\r\nthe heart. Next to the sense of religious duty and moral feeling, I\r\nhardly know what should bear with stronger obligation on a liberal and\r\nenlightened mind, than a consciousness of alliance with excellence\r\nwhich is departed; and a consciousness, too, that in its acts and\r\nconduct, and even in its sentiments and thoughts, it may be actively\r\noperating on the happiness of those who come after it. Poetry is found\r\nto have few stronger conceptions, by which it would affect or overwhelm\r\nthe mind, than those in which it presents the moving and speaking image\r\nof the departed dead to the senses of the living. This belongs to\r\npoetry, only because it is congenial to our nature. Poetry is, in this\r\nrespect, but the handmaid of true philosophy and morality; it deals\r\nwith us as human beings, naturally reverencing those whose visible\r\nconnection with this state of existence is severed, and who may yet\r\nexercise we know not what sympathy with ourselves; and when it carries\r\nus forward, also, and shows us the long continued result of all the\r\ngood we do, in the prosperity of those who follow us, till it bears us\r\nfrom ourselves, and absorbs us in an intense interest for what shall\r\nhappen to the generations after us, it speaks only in the language of\r\nour nature, and affects us with sentiments which belong to us as human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nStanding in this relation to our ancestors and our posterity, we are\r\nassembled on this memorable spot, to perform the duties which that\r\nrelation and the present occasion impose upon us. We have come to this\r\nRock, to record here our homage for our Pilgrim Fathers; our sympathy\r\nin their sufferings; our gratitude for their labors; our admiration of\r\ntheir virtues; our veneration for their piety; and our attachment to\r\nthose principles of civil and religious liberty, which they encountered\r\nthe dangers of the ocean, the storms of heaven, the violence of\r\nsavages, disease, exile, and famine, to enjoy and to establish. And we\r\nwould leave here, also, for the generations which are rising up rapidly\r\nto fill our places, some proof that we have endeavored to transmit the\r\ngreat inheritance unimpaired; that in our estimate of public principles\r\nand private virtue, in our veneration of religion and piety, in our\r\ndevotion to civil and religious liberty, in our regard for whatever\r\nadvances human knowledge or improves human happiness, we are not\r\naltogether unworthy of our origin.\r\n\r\nThere is a local feeling connected with this occasion, too strong to be\r\nresisted; a sort of _genius of the place_, which inspires and awes us.\r\nWe feel that we are on the spot where the first scene of our history\r\nwas laid; where the hearths and altars of New England were first\r\nplaced; where Christianity, and civilization, and letters made their\r\nfirst lodgement, in a vast extent of country, covered with a\r\nwilderness, and peopled by roving barbarians. We are here, at the\r\nseason of the year at which the event took place. The imagination\r\nirresistibly and rapidly draws around us the principal features and the\r\nleading characters in the original scene. We cast our eyes abroad on\r\nthe ocean, and we see where the little bark, with the interesting group\r\nupon its deck, made its slow progress to the shore. We look around us,\r\nand behold the hills and promontories where the anxious eyes of our\r\nfathers first saw the places of habitation and of rest. We feel the\r\ncold which benumbed, and listen to the winds which pierced them.\r\nBeneath us is the Rock, on which New England received the feet of the\r\nPilgrims. We seem even to behold them, as they struggle with the\r\nelements, and, with toilsome efforts, gain the shore. We listen to the\r\nchiefs in council; we see the unexampled exhibition of female fortitude\r\nand resignation; we hear the whisperings of youthful impatience, and we\r\nsee, what a painter of our own has also represented by his pencil [1],\r\nchilled and shivering childhood, houseless, but for a mother's arms,\r\ncouchless, but for a mother's breast, till our own blood almost\r\nfreezes. The mild dignity of Carver and of Bradford; the decisive and\r\nsoldier-like air and manner of Standish; the devout Brewster; the\r\nenterprising Allerton; [2] the general firmness and thoughtfulness of\r\nthe whole band; their conscious joy for dangers escaped; their deep\r\nsolicitude about dangers to come; their trust in Heaven; their high\r\nreligious faith, full of confidence and anticipation; all of these seem\r\nto belong to this place, and to be present upon this occasion, to fill\r\nus with reverence and admiration.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of New England by the colony which landed here on the\r\ntwenty-second [3] of December, sixteen hundred and twenty, although not\r\nthe first European establishment in what now constitutes the United\r\nStates, was yet so peculiar in its causes and character, and has been\r\nfollowed and must still be followed by such consequences, as to give it\r\na high claim to lasting commemoration. On these causes and\r\nconsequences, more than on its immediately attendant circumstances, its\r\nimportance, as an historical event, depends. Great actions and striking\r\noccurrences, having excited a temporary admiration, often pass away and\r\nare forgotten, because they leave no lasting results, affecting the\r\nprosperity and happiness of communities. Such is frequently the fortune\r\nof the most brilliant military achievements. Of the ten thousand\r\nbattles which have been fought, of all the fields fertilized with\r\ncarnage, of the banners which have been bathed in blood, of the\r\nwarriors who have hoped that they had risen from the field of conquest\r\nto a glory as bright and as durable as the stars, how few that continue\r\nlong to interest mankind! The victory of yesterday is reversed by the\r\ndefeat of to-day; the star of military glory, rising like a meteor,\r\nlike a meteor has fallen; disgrace and disaster hang on the heels of\r\nconquest and renown; victor and vanquished presently pass away to\r\noblivion, and the world goes on in its course, with the loss only of so\r\nmany lives and so much treasure.\r\n\r\nBut if this be frequently, or generally, the fortune of military\r\nachievements, it is not always so. There are enterprises, military as\r\nwell as civil, which sometimes check the current of events, give a new\r\nturn to human affairs, and transmit their consequences through ages. We\r\nsee their importance in their results, and call them great, because\r\ngreat things follow. There have been battles which have fixed the fate\r\nof nations. These come down to us in history with a solid and permanent\r\ninterest, not created by a display of glittering armor, the rush of\r\nadverse battalions, the sinking and rising of pennons, the flight, the\r\npursuit, and the victory; but by their effect in advancing or retarding\r\nhuman knowledge, in overthrowing or establishing despotism, in\r\nextending or destroying human happiness. When the traveller pauses on\r\nthe plain of Marathon, what are the emotions which most strongly\r\nagitate his breast? What is that glorious recollection, which thrills\r\nthrough his frame, and suffuses his eyes? Not, I imagine, that Grecian\r\nskill and Grecian valor were here most signally displayed; but that\r\nGreece herself was saved. It is because to this spot, and to the event\r\nwhich has rendered it immortal, he refers all the succeeding glories of\r\nthe republic. It is because, if that day had gone otherwise, Greece had\r\nperished. It is because he perceives that her philosophers and orators,\r\nher poets and painters, her sculptors and architects, her governments\r\nand free institutions, point backward to Marathon, and that their\r\nfuture existence seems to have been suspended on the contingency,\r\nwhether the Persian or the Grecian banner should wave victorious in the\r\nbeams of that day's setting sun. And, as his imagination kindles at the\r\nretrospect, he is transported back to the interesting moment; he counts\r\nthe fearful odds of the contending hosts; his interest for the result\r\noverwhelms him; he trembles, as if it were still uncertain, and seems\r\nto doubt whether he may consider Socrates and Plato, Demosthenes,\r\nSophocles, and Phidias, as secure, yet, to himself and to the world.\r\n\r\n\"If we conquer,\" said the Athenian commander on the approach of that\r\ndecisive day, \"if we conquer, we shall make Athens the greatest city of\r\nGreece.\" [4] A prophecy how well fulfilled! \"If God prosper us,\" might\r\nhave been the more appropriate language of our fathers, when they\r\nlanded upon this Rock, \"if God prosper us, we shall here begin a work\r\nwhich shall last for ages; we shall plant here a new society, in the\r\nprinciples of the fullest liberty and the purest religion; we shall\r\nsubdue this wilderness which is before us; we shall fill this region of\r\nthe great continent, which stretches almost from pole to pole, with\r\ncivilization and Christianity; the temples of the true God shall rise,\r\nwhere now ascends the smoke of idolatrous sacrifice; fields and\r\ngardens, the flowers of summer, and the waving and golden harvest of\r\nautumn, shall spread over a thousand hills, and stretch along a\r\nthousand valleys, never yet, since the creation, reclaimed to the use\r\nof civilized man. We shall whiten this coast with the canvas of a\r\nprosperous commerce; we shall stud the long and winding shore with a\r\nhundred cities. That which we sow in weakness shall be raised in\r\nstrength. From our sincere, but houseless worship, there shall spring\r\nsplendid temples to record God's goodness; from the simplicity of our\r\nsocial union, there shall arise wise and politic constitutions of\r\ngovernment, full of the liberty which we ourselves bring and breathe;\r\nfrom our zeal for learning, institutions shall spring which shall\r\nscatter the light of knowledge throughout the land, and, in time,\r\npaying back where they have borrowed, shall contribute their part to\r\nthe great aggregate of human knowledge; and our descendants, through\r\nall generations, shall look back to this spot, and to this hour, with\r\nunabated affection and regard.\"\r\n\r\nA brief remembrance of the causes which led to the settlement of this\r\nplace; some account of the peculiarities and characteristic qualities\r\nof that settlement, as distinguished from other instances of\r\ncolonization; a short notice of the progress of New England in the\r\ngreat interests of society, during the century which is now elapsed;\r\nwith a few observations on the principles upon which society and\r\ngovernment are established in this country: comprise all that can be\r\nattempted, and much more than can be satisfactorily performed, on the\r\npresent occasion.\r\n\r\nOf the motives which influenced the first settlers to a voluntary\r\nexile, induced them to relinquish their native country, and to seek an\r\nasylum in this then unexplored wilderness, the first and principal, no\r\ndoubt, were connected with religion. They sought to enjoy a higher\r\ndegree of religious freedom, and what they esteemed a purer form of\r\nreligious worship, than was allowed to their choice, or presented to\r\ntheir imitation, in the Old World. The love of religious liberty is a\r\nstronger sentiment, when fully excited, than an attachment to civil or\r\npolitical freedom. That freedom which the conscience demands, and which\r\nmen feel bound by their hope of salvation to contend for, can hardly\r\nfail to be attained. Conscience, in the cause of religion and the\r\nworship of the Deity, prepares the mind to act and to suffer beyond\r\nalmost all other causes. It sometimes gives an impulse so irresistible,\r\nthat no fetters of power or of opinion can withstand it. History\r\ninstructs us that this love of religious liberty, a compound sentiment\r\nin the breast of man, made up of the clearest sense of right and the\r\nhighest conviction of duty, is able to look the sternest despotism in\r\nthe face, and, with means apparently most inadequate, to shake\r\nprincipalities and powers. There is a boldness, a spirit of daring, in\r\nreligious reformers, not to be measured by the general rules which\r\ncontrol men's purposes and actions. If the hand of power be laid upon\r\nit, this only seems to augment its force and its elasticity, and to\r\ncause its action to be more formidable and violent. Human invention has\r\ndevised nothing, human power has compassed nothing, that can forcibly\r\nrestrain it, when it breaks forth. Nothing can stop it, but to give way\r\nto it; nothing can check it, but indulgence. It loses its power only\r\nwhen it has gained its object. The principle of toleration, to which\r\nthe world has come so slowly, is at once the most just and the most\r\nwise of all principles. Even when religious feeling takes a character\r\nof extravagance and enthusiasm, and seems to threaten the order of\r\nsociety and shake the columns of the social edifice, its principal\r\ndanger is in its restraint. If it be allowed indulgence and expansion,\r\nlike the elemental fires, it only agitates, and perhaps purifies, the\r\natmosphere; while its efforts to throw off restraint would burst the\r\nworld asunder.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, that, although many of them were republicans in\r\nprinciple, we have no evidence that our New England ancestors would\r\nhave emigrated, as they did, from their own native country, would have\r\nbecome wanderers in Europe, and finally would have undertaken the\r\nestablishment of a colony here, merely from their dislike of the\r\npolitical systems of Europe. They fled not so much from the civil\r\ngovernment, as from the hierarchy, and the laws which enforced\r\nconformity to the church establishment. Mr. Robinson had left England\r\nas early as 1608, on account of the persecutions for non-conformity,\r\nand had retired to Holland. He left England from no disappointed\r\nambition in affairs of state, from no regrets at the want of preferment\r\nin the church, nor from any motive of distinction or of gain.\r\nUniformity in matters of religion was pressed with such extreme rigor,\r\nthat a voluntary exile seemed the most eligible mode of escaping from\r\nthe penalties of non-compliance. The accession of Elizabeth had, it is\r\ntrue, quenched the fires of Smithfield, and put an end to the easy\r\nacquisition of the crown of martyrdom. Her long reign had established\r\nthe Reformation, but toleration was a virtue beyond her conception, and\r\nbeyond the age. She left no example of it to her successor; and he was\r\nnot of a character which rendered it probable that a sentiment either\r\nso wise or so liberal would originate with him. At the present period\r\nit seems incredible that the learned, accomplished, unassuming, and\r\ninoffensive Robinson should neither be tolerated in his peaceable mode\r\nof worship in his own country, nor suffered quietly to depart from it.\r\nYet such was the fact. He left his country by stealth, that he might\r\nelsewhere enjoy those rights which ought to belong to men in all\r\ncountries. The departure of the Pilgrims for Holland is deeply\r\ninteresting, from its circumstances, and also as it marks the character\r\nof the times, independently of its connection with names now\r\nincorporated with the history of empire. [5] The embarkation was\r\nintended to be made in such a manner that it might escape the notice of\r\nthe officers of government. Great pains had been taken to secure boats,\r\nwhich should come undiscovered to the shore, and receive the fugitives;\r\nand frequent disappointments had been experienced in this respect.\r\n\r\nAt length the appointed time came, bringing with it unusual severity of\r\ncold and rain. An unfrequented and barren heath, on the shores of\r\nLincolnshire, was the selected spot, where the feet of the Pilgrims\r\nwere to tread, for the last time, the land of their fathers. The vessel\r\nwhich was to receive them did not come until the next day, and in the\r\nmeantime the little band was collected, and men and women and children\r\nand baggage were crowded together, in melancholy and distressed\r\nconfusion. The sea was rough, and the women and children were already\r\nsick, from their passage down the river to the place of embarkation on\r\nthe sea. At length the wished-for boat silently and fearfully\r\napproaches the shore, and men and women and children, shaking with fear\r\nand with cold, as many as the small vessel could bear, venture off on a\r\ndangerous sea. Immediately the advance of horses is heard from behind,\r\narmed men appear, and those not yet embarked are seized and taken into\r\ncustody. In the hurry of the moment, the first parties had been sent on\r\nboard without any attempt to keep members of the same family together,\r\nand on account of the appearance of the horsemen, the boat never\r\nreturned for the residue. Those who had got away, and those who had\r\nnot, were in equal distress. A storm, of great violence and long\r\nduration, arose at sea, which not only protracted the voyage, rendered\r\ndistressing by the want of all those accommodations which the\r\ninterruption of the embarkation had occasioned, but also forced the\r\nvessel out of her course, and menaced immediate shipwreck; while those\r\non shore, when they were dismissed from the custody of the officers of\r\njustice, having no longer homes or houses to retire to, and their\r\nfriends and protectors being already gone, became objects of necessary\r\ncharity, as well as of deep commiseration.\r\n\r\nAs this scene passes before us, we can hardly forbear asking whether\r\nthis be a band of malefactors and felons flying from justice. What are\r\ntheir crimes, that they hide themselves in darkness? To what punishment\r\nare they exposed, that, to avoid it, men, and women, and children, thus\r\nencounter the surf of the North Sea and the terrors of a night storm?\r\nWhat induces this armed pursuit, and this arrest of fugitives, of all\r\nages and both sexes? Truth does not allow us to answer these inquiries\r\nin a manner that does credit to the wisdom or the justice of the times.\r\nThis was not the flight of guilt, but of virtue. It was an humble and\r\npeaceable religion, flying from causeless oppression. It was\r\nconscience, attempting to escape from the arbitrary rule of the\r\nStuarts. It was Robinson and Brewster, leading off their little band\r\nfrom their native soil, at first to find shelter on the shore of the\r\nneighboring continent, but ultimately to come hither; and having\r\nsurmounted all difficulties and braved a thousand dangers, to find here\r\na place of refuge and of rest. Thanks be to God, that this spot was\r\nhonored as the asylum of religious liberty! May its standard, reared\r\nhere, remain for ever! May it rise up as high as heaven, till its\r\nbanner shall fan the air of both continents, and wave as a glorious\r\nensign of peace and security to the nations!\r\n\r\nThe peculiar character, condition, and circumstances of the colonies\r\nwhich introduced civilization and an English race into New England,\r\nafford a most interesting and extensive topic of discussion. On these,\r\nmuch of our subsequent character and fortune has depended. Their\r\ninfluence has essentially affected our whole history, through the two\r\ncenturies which have elapsed; and as they have become intimately\r\nconnected with government, laws, and property, as well as with our\r\nopinions on the subjects of religion and civil liberty, that influence\r\nis likely to continue to be felt through the centuries which shall\r\nsucceed. Emigration from one region to another, and the emission of\r\ncolonies to people countries more or less distant from the residence of\r\nthe parent stock, are common incidents in the history of mankind; but\r\nit has not often, perhaps never, happened, that the establishment of\r\ncolonies should be attempted under circumstances, however beset with\r\npresent difficulties and dangers, yet so favorable to ultimate success,\r\nand so conducive to magnificent results, as those which attended the\r\nfirst settlements on this part of the American continent. In other\r\ninstances, emigration has proceeded from a less exalted purpose, in\r\nperiods of less general intelligence, or more without plan and by\r\naccident; or under circumstances, physical and moral, less favorable to\r\nthe expectation of laying a foundation for great public prosperity and\r\nfuture empire.\r\n\r\nA great resemblance exists, obviously, between all the English colonies\r\nestablished within the present limits of the United States; but the\r\noccasion attracts our attention more immediately to those which took\r\npossession of New England, and the peculiarities of these furnish a\r\nstrong contrast with most other instances of colonization.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient nations, the Greeks, no doubt, sent forth from their\r\nterritories the greatest number of colonies. So numerous, indeed, were\r\nthey, and so great the extent of space over which they were spread,\r\nthat the parent country fondly and naturally persuaded herself, that by\r\nmeans of them she had laid a sure foundation for the universal\r\ncivilization of the world. These establishments, from obvious causes,\r\nwere most numerous in places most contiguous; yet they were found on\r\nthe coasts of France, on the shores of the Euxine Sea, in Africa, and\r\neven, as is alleged, on the borders of India. These emigrations appear\r\nto have been sometimes voluntary and sometimes compulsory; arising from\r\nthe spontaneous enterprise of individuals, or the order and regulation\r\nof government. It was a common opinion with ancient writers, that they\r\nwere undertaken in religious obedience to the commands of oracles, and\r\nit is probable that impressions of this sort might have had more or\r\nless influence; but it is probable, also, that on these occasions the\r\noracles did not speak a language dissonant from the views and purposes\r\nof the state.\r\n\r\nPolitical science among the Greeks seems never to have extended to the\r\ncomprehension of a system, which should be adequate to the government\r\nof a great nation upon principles of liberty. They were accustomed only\r\nto the contemplation of small republics, and were led to consider an\r\naugmented population as incompatible with free institutions. The desire\r\nof a remedy for this supposed evil, and the wish to establish marts for\r\ntrade, led the governments often to undertake the establishment of\r\ncolonies as an affair of state expediency. Colonization and commerce,\r\nindeed, would naturally become objects of interest to an ingenious and\r\nenterprising people, inhabiting a territory closely circumscribed in\r\nits limits, and in no small part mountainous and sterile; while the\r\nislands of the adjacent seas, and the promontories and coasts of the\r\nneighboring continents, by their mere proximity, strongly solicited the\r\nexcited spirit of emigration. Such was this proximity, in many\r\ninstances, that the new settlements appeared rather to be the mere\r\nextension of population over contiguous territory, than the\r\nestablishment of distant colonies. In proportion as they were near to\r\nthe parent state, they would be under its authority, and partake of its\r\nfortunes. The colony at Marseilles might perceive lightly, or not at\r\nall, the sway of Phocis; while the islands in the Aegean Sea could\r\nhardly attain to independence of their Athenian origin. Many of these\r\nestablishments took place at an early age; and if there were defects in\r\nthe governments of the parent states, the colonists did not possess\r\nphilosophy or experience sufficient to correct such evils in their own\r\ninstitutions, even if they had not been, by other causes, deprived of\r\nthe power. An immediate necessity, connected with the support of life,\r\nwas the main and direct inducement to these undertakings, and there\r\ncould hardly exist more than the hope of a successful imitation of\r\ninstitutions with which they were already acquainted, and of holding an\r\nequality with their neighbors in the course of improvement. The laws\r\nand customs, both political and municipal, as well as the religious\r\nworship of the parent city, were transferred to the colony; and the\r\nparent city herself, with all such of her colonies as were not too far\r\nremote for frequent intercourse and common sentiments, would appear\r\nlike a family of cities, more or less dependent, and more or less\r\nconnected. We know how imperfect this system was, as a system of\r\ngeneral politics, and what scope it gave to those mutual dissensions\r\nand conflicts which proved so fatal to Greece.\r\n\r\nBut it is more pertinent to our present purpose to observe, that\r\nnothing existed in the character of Grecian emigrations, or in the\r\nspirit and intelligence of the emigrants, likely to give a new and\r\nimportant direction to human affairs, or a new impulse to the human\r\nmind. Their motives were not high enough, their views were not\r\nsufficiently large and prospective. They went not forth, like our\r\nancestors, to erect systems of more perfect civil liberty, or to enjoy\r\na higher degree of religious freedom. Above all, there was nothing in\r\nthe religion and learning of the age, that could either inspire high\r\npurposes, or give the ability to execute them. Whatever restraints on\r\ncivil liberty, or whatever abuses in religious worship, existed at the\r\ntime of our fathers' emigration, yet even then all was light in the\r\nmoral and mental world, in comparison with its condition in most\r\nperiods of the ancient states. The settlement of a new continent, in an\r\nage of progressive knowledge and improvement, could not but do more\r\nthan merely enlarge the natural boundaries of the habitable world. It\r\ncould not but do much more even than extend commerce and increase\r\nwealth among the human race. We see how this event has acted, how it\r\nmust have acted, and wonder only why it did not act sooner, in the\r\nproduction of moral effects, on the state of human knowledge, the\r\ngeneral tone of human sentiments, and the prospects of human happiness.\r\nIt gave to civilized man not only a new continent to be inhabited and\r\ncultivated, and new seas to be explored; but it gave him also a new\r\nrange for his thoughts, new objects for curiosity, and new excitements\r\nto knowledge and improvement.\r\n\r\nRoman colonization resembled, far less than that of the Greeks, the\r\noriginal settlements of this country. Power and dominion were the\r\nobjects of Rome, even in her colonial establishments. Her whole\r\nexterior aspect was for centuries hostile and terrific. She grasped at\r\ndominion, from India to Britain, and her measures of colonization\r\npartook of the character of her general system. Her policy was\r\nmilitary, because her objects were power, ascendency, and subjugation.\r\nDetachments of emigrants from Rome incorporated themselves with, and\r\ngoverned, the original inhabitants of conquered countries. She sent\r\ncitizens where she had first sent soldiers; her law followed her sword.\r\nHer colonies were a sort of military establishment; so many advanced\r\nposts in the career of her dominion. A governor from Rome ruled the new\r\ncolony with absolute sway, and often with unbounded rapacity. In\r\nSicily, in Gaul, in Spain, and in Asia, the power of Rome prevailed,\r\nnot nominally only, but really and effectually. Those who immediately\r\nexercised it were Roman; the tone and tendency of its administration,\r\nRoman. Rome herself continued to be the heart and centre of the great\r\nsystem which she had established. [6] Extortion and rapacity, finding a\r\nwide and often rich field of action in the provinces, looked\r\nnevertheless to the banks of the Tiber, as the scene in which their\r\nill-gotten treasures should be displayed; or, if a spirit of more\r\nhonest acquisition prevailed, the object, nevertheless, was ultimate\r\nenjoyment in Rome itself. If our own history and our own times did not\r\nsufficiently expose the inherent and incurable evils of provincial\r\ngovernment, we might see them portrayed, to our amazement, in the\r\ndesolated and ruined provinces of the Roman empire. We might hear them,\r\nin a voice that terrifies us, in those strains of complaint and\r\naccusation, which the advocates of the provinces poured forth in the\r\nRoman Forum:--\"Quas res luxuries in flagitiis, crudelitas in\r\nsuppliciis, avaritia in rapinis, superbia in contumeliis, efficere\r\npotuisset, eas omnes sese pertulisse.\"\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected, the Roman Provinces partook of the fortunes, as\r\nwell as of the sentiments and general character, of the seat of empire.\r\nThey lived together with her, they flourished with her, and fell with\r\nher. The branches were lopped away even before the vast and venerable\r\ntrunk itself fell prostrate to the earth. Nothing had proceeded from\r\nher which could support itself, and bear up the name of its origin,\r\nwhen her own sustaining arm should be enfeebled or withdrawn. It was\r\nnot given to Rome to see, either at her zenith or in her decline, a\r\nchild of her own, distant, indeed, and independent of her control, yet\r\nspeaking her language and inheriting her blood, springing forward to a\r\ncompetition with her own power, and a comparison with her own great\r\nrenown. She saw not a vast region of the earth peopled from her stock,\r\nfull of states and political communities, improving upon the models of\r\nher institutions, and breathing in fuller measure the spirit which she\r\nhad breathed in the best periods of her existence; enjoying and\r\nextending her arts and her literature; rising rapidly from political\r\nchildhood to manly strength and independence; her offspring, yet now\r\nher equal; unconnected with the causes which might affect the duration\r\nof her own power and greatness; of common origin, but not linked to a\r\ncommon fate; giving ample pledge, that her name should not be\r\nforgotten, that her language should not cease to be used among men;\r\nthat whatsoever she had done for human knowledge and human happiness\r\nshould be treasured up and preserved; that the record of her existence\r\nand her achievements should not be obscured, although, in the\r\ninscrutable purposes of Providence, it might be her destiny to fall\r\nfrom opulence and splendor; although the time might come, when darkness\r\nshould settle on all her hills; when foreign or domestic violence\r\nshould overturn her altars and her temples; when ignorance and\r\ndespotism should fill the places where Laws, and Arts, and Liberty had\r\nflourished; when the feet of barbarism should trample on the tombs of\r\nher consuls, and the walls of her senate-house and forum echo only to\r\nthe voice of savage triumph. She saw not this glorious vision, to\r\ninspire and fortify her against the possible decay or downfall of her\r\npower. Happy are they who in our day may behold it, if they shall\r\ncontemplate it with the sentiments which it ought to inspire!\r\n\r\nThe New England Colonies differ quite as widely from the Asiatic\r\nestablishments of the modern European nations, as from the models of\r\nthe ancient states. The sole object of those establishments was\r\noriginally trade; although we have seen, in one of them, the anomaly of\r\na mere trading company attaining a political character, disbursing\r\nrevenues, and maintaining armies and fortresses, until it has extended\r\nits control over seventy millions of people. Differing from these, and\r\nstill more from the New England and North American Colonies, are the\r\nEuropean settlements in the West India Islands. It is not strange,\r\nthat, when men's minds were turned to the settlement of America,\r\ndifferent objects should be proposed by those who emigrated to the\r\ndifferent regions of so vast a country. Climate, soil, and condition\r\nwere not equally favorable to all pursuits. In the West Indies, the\r\npurpose of those who went thither was to engage in that species of\r\nagriculture, suited to the soil and climate, which seems to bear more\r\nresemblance to commerce than to the hard and plain tillage of New\r\nEngland. The great staples of these countries, being partly an\r\nagricultural and partly a manufactured product, and not being of the\r\nnecessaries of life, become the object of calculation, with respect to\r\na profitable investment of capital, like any other enterprise of trade\r\nor manufacture. The more especially, as, requiring, by necessity or\r\nhabit, slave labor for their production, the capital necessary to carry\r\non the work of this production is very considerable. The West Indies\r\nare resorted to, therefore, rather for the investment of capital than\r\nfor the purpose of sustaining life by personal labor. Such as possess a\r\nconsiderable amount of capital, or such as choose to adventure in\r\ncommercial speculations without capital, can alone be fitted to be\r\nemigrants to the islands. The agriculture of these regions, as before\r\nobserved, is a sort of commerce; and it is a species of employment in\r\nwhich labor seems to form an inconsiderable ingredient in the\r\nproductive causes, since the portion of white labor is exceedingly\r\nsmall, and slave labor is rather more like profit on stock or capital\r\nthan _labor_ properly so called. The individual who undertakes an\r\nestablishment of this kind takes into the account the cost of the\r\nnecessary number of slaves, in the same manner as he calculates the\r\ncost of the land. The uncertainty, too, of this species of employment,\r\naffords another ground of resemblance to commerce. Although gainful on\r\nthe whole, and in a series of years, it is often very disastrous for a\r\nsingle year, and, as the capital is not readily invested in other\r\npursuits, bad crops or bad markets not only affect the profits, but the\r\ncapital itself. Hence the sudden depressions which take place in the\r\nvalue of such estates.\r\n\r\nBut the great and leading observation, relative to these\r\nestablishments, remains to be made. It is, that the owners of the soil\r\nand of the capital seldom consider themselves _at home_ in the colony.\r\nA very great portion of the soil itself is usually owned in the mother\r\ncountry; a still greater is mortgaged for capital obtained there; and,\r\nin general, those who are to derive an interest from the products look\r\nto the parent country as the place for enjoyment of their wealth. The\r\npopulation is therefore constantly fluctuating. Nobody comes but to\r\nreturn. A constant succession of owners, agents, and factors takes\r\nplace. Whatsoever the soil, forced by the unmitigated toil of slavery,\r\ncan yield, is sent home to defray rents, and interest, and agencies, or\r\nto give the means of living in a better society. In such a state, it is\r\nevident that no spirit of permanent improvement is likely to spring up.\r\nProfits will not be invested with a distant view of benefiting\r\nposterity. Roads and canals will hardly be built; schools will not be\r\nfounded; colleges will not be endowed. There will be few fixtures in\r\nsociety; no principles of utility or of elegance, planted now, with the\r\nhope of being developed and expanded hereafter. Profit, immediate\r\nprofit, must be the principal active spring in the social system. There\r\nmay be many particular exceptions to these general remarks, but the\r\noutline of the whole is such as is here drawn.[7]\r\n\r\nAnother most important consequence of such a state of things is, that\r\nno idea of independence of the parent country is likely to arise;\r\nunless, indeed, it should spring up in a form that would threaten\r\nuniversal desolation. The inhabitants have no strong attachment to the\r\nplace which they inhabit. The hope of a great portion of them is to\r\nleave it; and their great desire, to leave it soon. However useful they\r\nmay be to the parent state, how much soever they may add to the\r\nconveniences and luxuries of life, these colonies are not favored spots\r\nfor the expansion of the human mind, for the progress of permanent\r\nimprovement, or for sowing the seeds of future independent empire.\r\n\r\nDifferent, indeed, most widely different, from all these instances, of\r\nemigration and plantation, were the condition, the purposes, and the\r\nprospects of our fathers, when they established their infant colony\r\nupon this spot. They came hither to a land from which they were never\r\nto return. Hither they had brought, and here they were to fix, their\r\nhopes, their attachments, and their objects in life. Some natural tears\r\nthey shed, as they left the pleasant abodes of their fathers, and some\r\nemotions they suppressed, when the white cliffs of their native\r\ncountry, now seen for the last time, grew dim to their sight. They were\r\nacting, however, upon a resolution not to be daunted. With whatever\r\nstifled regrets, with whatever occasional hesitation, with whatever\r\nappalling apprehensions, which might sometimes arise with force to\r\nshake the firmest purpose, they had yet committed themselves to Heaven\r\nand the elements; and a thousand leagues of water soon interposed to\r\nseparate them for ever from the region which gave them birth. A new\r\nexistence awaited them here; and when they saw these shores, rough,\r\ncold, barbarous, and barren, as then they were, they beheld their\r\ncountry. That mixed and strong feeling, which we call love of country,\r\nand which is, in general, never extinguished in the heart of man,\r\ngrasped and embraced its proper object here. Whatever constitutes\r\n_country_, except the earth and the sun, all the moral causes of\r\naffection and attachment which operate upon the heart, they had brought\r\nwith them to their new abode. Here were now their families and friends,\r\ntheir homes, and their property. Before they reached the shore, they\r\nhad established the elements of a social system,[8] and at a much\r\nearlier period had settled their forms of religious worship. At the\r\nmoment of their landing, therefore, they possessed institutions of\r\ngovernment, and institutions of religion: and friends and families, and\r\nsocial and religious institutions, framed by consent, founded on choice\r\nand preference, how nearly do these fill up our whole idea of country!\r\nThe morning that beamed on the first night of their repose saw the\r\nPilgrims already _at home_ in their country. There were political\r\ninstitutions, and civil liberty, and religious worship. Poetry has\r\nfancied nothing, in the wanderings of heroes, so distinct and\r\ncharacteristic. Here was man, indeed, unprotected, and unprovided for,\r\non the shore of a rude and fearful wilderness; but it was politic,\r\nintelligent, and educated man. Every thing was civilized but the\r\nphysical world. Institutions, containing in substance all that ages had\r\ndone for human government, were organized in a forest.[9] Cultivated\r\nmind was to act on uncultivated nature; and, more than all, a\r\ngovernment and a country were to commence, with the very first\r\nfoundations laid under the divine light of the Christian religion.\r\nHappy auspices of a happy futurity! Who would wish that his country's\r\nexistence had otherwise begun? Who would desire the power of going back\r\nto the ages of fable? Who would wish for an origin obscured in the\r\ndarkness of antiquity? Who would wish for other emblazoning of his\r\ncountry's heraldry, or other ornaments of her genealogy, than to be\r\nable to say, that her first existence was with intelligence, her first\r\nbreath the inspiration of liberty, her first principle the truth of\r\ndivine religion?\r\n\r\nLocal attachments and sympathies would ere long spring up in the\r\nbreasts of our ancestors, endearing to them the place of their refuge.\r\nWhatever natural objects are associated with interesting scenes and\r\nhigh efforts obtain a hold on human feeling, and demand from the heart\r\na sort of recognition and regard. This Rock soon became hallowed in the\r\nesteem of the Pilgrims, and these hills grateful to their sight.\r\nNeither they nor their children were again to till the soil of England,\r\nnor again to traverse the seas which surround her. But here was a new\r\nsea, now open to their enterprise, and a new soil, which had not failed\r\nto respond gratefully to their laborious industry, and which was\r\nalready assuming a robe of verdure. Hardly had they provided shelter\r\nfor the living, ere they were summoned to erect sepulchres for the\r\ndead. The ground had become sacred, by enclosing the remains of some of\r\ntheir companions and connections. A parent, a child, a husband, or a\r\nwife, had gone the way of all flesh, and mingled with the dust of New\r\nEngland. We naturally look with strong emotions to the spot, though it\r\nbe a wilderness, where the ashes of those we have loved repose. Where\r\nthe heart has laid down what it loved most, there it is desirous of\r\nlaying itself down. No sculptured marble, no enduring monument, no\r\nhonorable inscription, no ever-burning taper that would drive away the\r\ndarkness of the tomb, can soften our sense of the reality of death, and\r\nhallow to our feelings the ground which is to cover us, like the\r\nconsciousness that we shall sleep, dust to dust, with the objects of\r\nour affections.\r\n\r\nIn a short time other causes sprung up to bind the Pilgrims with new\r\ncords to their chosen land. Children were born, and the hopes of future\r\ngenerations arose, in the spot of their new habitation. The second\r\ngeneration found this the land of their nativity, and saw that they\r\nwere bound to its fortunes. They beheld their fathers' graves around\r\nthem, and while they read the memorials of their toils and labors, they\r\nrejoiced in the inheritance which they found bequeathed to them.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these causes, it was to be expected that an\r\ninterest and a feeling should arise here, entirely different from the\r\ninterest and feeling of mere Englishmen; and all the subsequent history\r\nof the Colonies proves this to have actually and gradually taken place.\r\nWith a general acknowledgment of the supremacy of the British crown,\r\nthere was, from the first, a repugnance to an entire submission to the\r\ncontrol of British legislation. The Colonies stood upon their charters,\r\nwhich, as they contended, exempted them from the ordinary power of the\r\nBritish Parliament, and authorized them to conduct their own concerns\r\nby their own counsels. They utterly resisted the notion that they were\r\nto be ruled by the mere authority of the government at home, and would\r\nnot endure even that their own charter governments should be\r\nestablished on the other side of the Atlantic. It was not a controlling\r\nor protecting board in England, but a government of their own, and\r\nexisting immediately within their limits, which could satisfy their\r\nwishes. It was easy to foresee, what we know also to have happened,\r\nthat the first great cause of collision and jealousy would be, under\r\nthe notion of political economy then and still prevalent in Europe, an\r\nattempt on the part of the mother country to monopolize the trade of\r\nthe Colonies. Whoever has looked deeply into the causes which produced\r\nour Revolution has found, if I mistake not, the original principle far\r\nback in this claim, on the part of England, to monopolize our trade,\r\nand a continued effort on the part of the Colonies to resist or evade\r\nthat monopoly; if, indeed, it be not still more just and philosophical\r\nto go farther back, and to consider it decided, that an independent\r\ngovernment must arise here, the moment it was ascertained that an\r\nEnglish colony, such as landed in this place, could sustain itself\r\nagainst the dangers which surrounded it, and, with other similar\r\nestablishments, overspread the land with an English population.\r\nAccidental causes retarded at times, and at times accelerated, the\r\nprogress of the controversy. The Colonies wanted strength, and time\r\ngave it to them. They required measures of strong and palpable\r\ninjustice, on the part of the mother country, to justify resistance;\r\nthe early part of the late king's reign furnished them. They needed\r\nspirits of high order, of great daring, of long foresight, and of\r\ncommanding power, to seize the favoring occasion to strike a blow,\r\nwhich should sever, for all time, the tie of colonial dependence; and\r\nthese spirits were found, in all the extent which that or any crisis\r\ncould demand, in Otis, Adams, Hancock, and the other immediate authors\r\nof our independence.\r\n\r\nStill, it is true that, for a century, causes had been in operation\r\ntending to prepare things for this great result. In the year 1660 the\r\nEnglish Act of Navigation was passed; the first and grand object of\r\nwhich seems to have been, to secure to England the whole trade with her\r\nplantations. It was provided by that act, that none but English ships\r\nshould transport American produce over the ocean, and that the\r\nprincipal articles of that produce should be allowed to be sold only in\r\nthe markets of the mother country. Three years afterwards another law\r\nwas passed, which enacted, that such commodities as the Colonies might\r\nwish to purchase should be bought only in the markets of the mother\r\ncountry. Severe rules were prescribed to enforce the provisions of\r\nthese laws, and heavy penalties imposed on all who should violate them.\r\nIn the subsequent years of the same reign, other statutes were enacted\r\nto re-enforce these statutes, and other rules prescribed to secure a\r\ncompliance with these rules. In this manner was the trade to and from\r\nthe Colonies restricted, almost to the exclusive advantage of the\r\nparent country. But laws, which rendered the interest of a whole people\r\nsubordinate to that of another people, were not likely to execute\r\nthemselves; nor was it easy to find many on the spot, who could be\r\ndepended upon for carrying them into execution. In fact, these laws\r\nwere more or less evaded or resisted, in all the Colonies. To enforce\r\nthem was the constant endeavor of the government at home; to prevent or\r\nelude their operation, the perpetual object here. \"The laws of\r\nnavigation,\" says a living British writer, \"were nowhere so openly\r\ndisobeyed and contemned as in New England.\" \"The people of\r\nMassachusetts Bay,\" he adds, \"were from the first disposed to act as if\r\nindependent of the mother country, and having a governor and\r\nmagistrates of their own choice, it was difficult to enforce any\r\nregulation which came from the English Parliament, adverse to their\r\ninterests.\" To provide more effectually for the execution of these\r\nlaws, we know that courts of admiralty were afterwards established by\r\nthe crown, with power to try revenue causes, as questions of admiralty,\r\nupon the construction given by the crown lawyers to an act of\r\nParliament; a great departure from the ordinary principles of English\r\njurisprudence, but which has been maintained, nevertheless, by the\r\nforce of habit and precedent, and is adopted in our own existing\r\nsystems of government.\r\n\r\n\"There lie,\" says another English writer, whose connection with the\r\nBoard of Trade has enabled him to ascertain many facts connected with\r\nColonial history, \"There lie among the documents in the board of trade\r\nand state-paper office, the most satisfactory proofs, from the epoch of\r\nthe English Revolution in 1688, throughout every reign, and during\r\nevery administration, of the settled purpose of the Colonies to acquire\r\ndirect independence and positive sovereignty.\" Perhaps this may be\r\nstated somewhat too strongly; but it cannot be denied, that, from the\r\nvery nature of the establishments here, and from the general character\r\nof the measures respecting their concerns early adopted and steadily\r\npursued by the English government, a division of the empire was the\r\nnatural and necessary result to which every thing tended.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt on this topic, because it seems to me, that the peculiar\r\noriginal character of the New England Colonies, and certain causes\r\ncoeval with their existence, have had a strong and decided influence on\r\nall their subsequent history, and especially on the great event of the\r\nRevolution. Whoever would write our history, and would understand and\r\nexplain early transactions, should comprehend the nature and force of\r\nthe feeling which I have endeavored to describe. As a son, leaving the\r\nhouse of his father for his own, finds, by the order of nature, and the\r\nvery law of his being, nearer and dearer objects around which his\r\naffections circle, while his attachment to the parental roof becomes\r\nmoderated, by degrees, to a composed regard and an affectionate\r\nremembrance; so our ancestors, leaving their native land, not without\r\nsome violence to the feelings of nature and affection, yet, in time,\r\nfound here a new circle of engagements, interests, and affections; a\r\nfeeling, which more and more encroached upon the old, till an undivided\r\nsentiment, _that this was their country_, occupied the heart; and\r\npatriotism, shutting out from its embraces the parent realm, became\r\n_local_ to America. Some retrospect of the century which has now\r\nelapsed is among the duties of the occasion. It must, however,\r\nnecessarily be imperfect, to be compressed within the limits of a\r\nsingle discourse. I shall content myself, therefore, with taking notice\r\nof a few of the leading and most important occurrences which have\r\ndistinguished the period.\r\n\r\nWhen the first century closed, the progress of the country appeared to\r\nhave been considerable; notwithstanding that, in comparison with its\r\nsubsequent advancement, it now seems otherwise. A broad and lasting\r\nfoundation had been laid; excellent institutions had been established;\r\nmany of the prejudices of former times had been removed; a more liberal\r\nand catholic spirit on subjects of religious concern had begun to\r\nextend itself, and many things conspired to give promise of increasing\r\nfuture prosperity. Great men had arisen in public life, and the liberal\r\nprofessions. The Mathers, father and son, were then sinking low in the\r\nwestern horizon; Leverett, the learned, the accomplished, the excellent\r\nLeverett, was about to withdraw his brilliant and useful light. In\r\nPemberton great hopes had been suddenly extinguished, but Prince and\r\nColman were in our sky; and along the east had begun to flash the\r\ncrepuscular light of a great luminary which was about to appear, and\r\nwhich was to stamp the age with his own name, as the age of Franklin.\r\n\r\nThe bloody Indian wars, which harassed the people for a part of the\r\nfirst century; the restrictions on the trade of the Colonies, added to\r\nthe discouragements inherently belonging to all forms of colonial\r\ngovernment; the distance from Europe, and the small hope of immediate\r\nprofit to adventurers, are among the causes which had contributed to\r\nretard the progress of population. Perhaps it may be added, also, that\r\nduring the period of the civil wars in England, and the reign of\r\nCromwell, many persons, whose religious opinions and religious temper\r\nmight, under other circumstances, have induced them to join the New\r\nEngland colonists, found reasons to remain in England; either on\r\naccount of active occupation in the scenes which were passing, or of an\r\nanticipation of the enjoyment, in their own country, of a form of\r\ngovernment, civil and religious, accommodated to their views and\r\nprinciples. The violent measures, too, pursued against the Colonies in\r\nthe reign of Charles the Second, the mockery of a trial, and the\r\nforfeiture of the charters, were serious evils. And during the open\r\nviolences of the short reign of James the Second, and the tyranny of\r\nAndros, as the venerable historian of Connecticut observes, \"All the\r\nmotives to great actions, to industry, economy, enterprise, wealth, and\r\npopulation, were in a manner annihilated. A general inactivity and\r\nlanguishment pervaded the public body. Liberty, property, and every\r\nthing which ought to be dear to men, every day grew more and more\r\ninsecure.\"  With the Revolution in England, a better prospect had\r\nopened on this country, as well as on that. The joy had been as great\r\nat that event, and far more universal, in New than in Old England. A\r\nnew charter had been granted to Massachusetts, which, although it did\r\nnot confirm to her inhabitants all their former privileges, yet\r\nrelieved them from great evils and embarrassments, and promised future\r\nsecurity. More than all, perhaps, the Revolution in England had done\r\ngood to the general cause of liberty and justice. A blow had been\r\nstruck in favor of the rights and liberties, not of England alone, but\r\nof descendants and kinsmen of England all over the world. Great\r\npolitical truths had been established the champions of liberty had been\r\nsuccessful in a fearful and perilous conflict. Somers, and Cavendish,\r\nand Jekyl, and Howard, had triumphed in one of the most noble causes\r\never undertaken by men. A revolution had been made upon principle. A\r\nmonarch had been dethroned for violating the original compact between\r\nking and people. The rights of the people to partake in the government,\r\nand to limit the monarch by fundamental rules of government, had been\r\nmaintained; and however unjust the government of England might\r\nafterwards be towards other governments or towards her colonies, she\r\nhad ceased to be governed herself by the arbitrary maxims of the\r\nStuarts.\r\n\r\nNew England had submitted to the violence of James the Second not\r\nlonger than Old England. Not only was it reserved to Massachusetts,\r\nthat on her soil should be acted the first scene of that great\r\nrevolutionary drama, which was to take place near a century afterwards,\r\nbut the English Revolution itself, as far as the Colonies were\r\nconcerned, commenced in Boston. The seizure and imprisonment of Andros,\r\nin April, 1689, were acts of direct and forcible resistance to the\r\nauthority of James the Second. The pulse of liberty beat as high in the\r\nextremities as at the heart. The vigorous feeling of the Colony burst\r\nout before it was known how the parent country would finally conduct\r\nherself. The king's representative, Sir Edmund Andros, was a prisoner\r\nin the castle at Boston, before it was or could be known that the king\r\nhimself had ceased to exercise his full dominion on the English throne.\r\n\r\nBefore it was known here whether the invasion of the Prince of Orange\r\nwould or could prove successful, as soon as it was known that it had\r\nbeen undertaken, the people of Massachusetts, at the imminent hazard of\r\ntheir lives and fortunes, had accomplished the Revolution as far as\r\nrespected themselves. It is probable that, reasoning on general\r\nprinciples and the known attachment of the English people to their\r\nconstitution and liberties, and their deep and fixed dislike of the\r\nking's religion and politics, the people of New England expected a\r\ncatastrophe fatal to the power of the reigning prince. Yet it was\r\nneither certain enough, nor near enough, to come to their aid against\r\nthe authority of the crown, in that crisis which had arrived, and in\r\nwhich they trusted to put themselves, relying on God and their own\r\ncourage. There were spirits in Massachusetts congenial with the spirits\r\nof the distinguished friends of the Revolution in England. There were\r\nthose who were fit to associate with the boldest asserters of civil\r\nliberty; and Mather himself, then in England, was not unworthy to be\r\nranked with those sons of the Church, whose firmness and spirit in\r\nresisting kingly encroachments in matters of religion, entitled them to\r\nthe gratitude of their own and succeeding ages.\r\n\r\nThe second century opened upon New England under circumstances which\r\nevinced that much had already been accomplished, and that still better\r\nprospects and brighter hopes were before her. She had laid, deep and\r\nstrong, the foundations of her society. Her religious principles were\r\nfirm, and her moral habits exemplary. Her public schools had begun to\r\ndiffuse widely the elements of knowledge; and the College, under the\r\nexcellent and acceptable administration of Leverett, had been raised to\r\na high degree of credit and usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe commercial character of the country, notwithstanding all\r\ndiscouragements, had begun to display itself, and _five hundred\r\nvessels_, then belonging to Massachusetts, placed her, in relation to\r\ncommerce, thus early at the head of the Colonies. An author who wrote\r\nvery near the close of the first century says:--\"New England is almost\r\ndeserving that _noble name_, so mightily hath it increased; and from a\r\nsmall settlement at first, is now become a very _populous_ and\r\n_flourishing_ government. The _capital city_, Boston, is a place of\r\n_great wealth and trade_; and by much the largest of any in the English\r\nempire of America; and not exceeded but by few cities, perhaps two or\r\nthree, in all the American world.\" But if our ancestors at the close of\r\nthe first century could look back with joy and even admiration, at the\r\nprogress of the country, what emotions must we not feel, when, from the\r\npoint on which we stand, we also look back and run along the events of\r\nthe century which has now closed! The country which then, as we have\r\nseen, was thought deserving of a \"noble name,\"--which then had\r\n\"mightily increased,\" and become \"very populous,\"--what was it, in\r\ncomparison with what our eyes behold it? At that period, a very great\r\nproportion of its inhabitants lived in the eastern section of\r\nMassachusetts proper, and in Plymouth Colony. In Connecticut, there\r\nwere towns along the coast, some of them respectable, but in the\r\ninterior all was a wilderness beyond Hartford. On Connecticut River,\r\nsettlements had proceeded as far up as Deerfield, and Fort Dummer had\r\nbeen built near where is now the south line of New Hampshire. In New\r\nHampshire no settlement was then begun thirty miles from the mouth of\r\nPiscataqua River, and in what is now Maine the inhabitants were\r\nconfined to the coast. The aggregate of the whole population of New\r\nEngland did not exceed one hundred and sixty thousand. Its present\r\namount (1820) is probably one million seven hundred thousand. Instead\r\nof being confined to its former limits, her population has rolled\r\nbackward, and filled up the spaces included within her actual local\r\nboundaries. Not this only, but it has overflowed those boundaries, and\r\nthe waves of emigration have pressed farther and farther toward the\r\nWest. The Alleghany has not checked it; the banks of the Ohio have been\r\ncovered with it. New England farms, houses, villages, and churches\r\nspread over and adorn the immense extent from the Ohio to Lake Erie,\r\nand stretch along from the Alleghany onwards, beyond the Miamis, and\r\ntowards the Falls of St. Anthony. Two thousand miles westward from the\r\nrock where their fathers landed, may now be found the sons of the\r\nPilgrims, cultivating smiling fields, rearing towns and villages, and\r\ncherishing, we trust, the patrimonial blessings of wise institutions,\r\nof liberty, and religion. The world has seen nothing like this. Regions\r\nlarge enough to be empires, and which, half a century ago, were known\r\nonly as remote and unexplored wildernesses, are now teeming with\r\npopulation, and prosperous in all the great concerns of life; in good\r\ngovernments, the means of subsistence, and social happiness. It may be\r\nsafely asserted, that there are now more than a million of people,\r\ndescendants of New England ancestry, living, free and happy, in regions\r\nwhich scarce sixty years ago were tracts of unpenetrated forest. Nor do\r\nrivers, or mountains, or seas resist the progress of industry and\r\nenterprise. Erelong, the sons of the Pilgrims will be on the shores of\r\nthe Pacific. The imagination hardly keeps pace with the progress of\r\npopulation, improvement, and civilization.\r\n\r\nIt is now five-and-forty years since the growth and rising glory of\r\nAmerica were portrayed in the English Parliament, with inimitable\r\nbeauty, by the most consummate orator of modern times. Going back\r\nsomewhat more than half a century, and describing our progress as\r\nforeseen from that point by his amiable friend Lord Bathurst, then\r\nliving, he spoke of the wonderful progress which America had made\r\nduring the period of a single human life. There is no American heart, I\r\nimagine, that does not glow, both with conscious, patriotic pride, and\r\nadmiration for one of the happiest efforts of eloquence, so often as\r\nthe vision of \"that little speck, scarce visible in the mass of\r\nnational interest, a small seminal principle, rather than a formed\r\nbody,\" and the progress of its astonishing development and growth, are\r\nrecalled to the recollection. But a stronger feeling might be produced,\r\nif we were able to take up this prophetic description where he left it,\r\nand, placing ourselves at the point of time in which he was speaking,\r\nto set forth with equal felicity the subsequent progress of the\r\ncountry. There is yet among the living a most distinguished and\r\nvenerable name, a descendant of the Pilgrims; one who has been attended\r\nthrough life by a great and fortunate genius; a man illustrious by his\r\nown great merits, and favored of Heaven in the long continuation of his\r\nyears. The time when the English orator was thus speaking of America\r\npreceded but by a few days the actual opening of the revolutionary\r\ndrama at Lexington. He to whom I have alluded, then at the age of\r\nforty, was among the most zealous and able defenders of the violated\r\nrights of his country. He seemed already to have filled a full measure\r\nof public service, and attained an honorable fame. The moment was full\r\nof difficulty and danger, and big with events of immeasurable\r\nimportance. The country was on the very brink of a civil war, of which\r\nno man could foretell the duration or the result. Something more than a\r\ncourageous hope, or characteristic ardor, would have been necessary to\r\nimpress the glorious prospect on his belief, if, at that moment, before\r\nthe sound of the first shock of actual war had reached his ears, some\r\nattendant spirit had opened to him the vision of the future;--if it had\r\nsaid to him, \"The blow is struck, and America is severed from England\r\nfor ever!\"--if it had informed him, that he himself, during the next\r\nannual revolution of the sun, should put his own hand to the great\r\ninstrument of independence, and write his name where all nations should\r\nbehold it and all time should not efface it; that erelong he himself\r\nshould maintain the interests and represent the sovereignty of his\r\nnew-born country in the proudest courts of Europe; that he should one\r\nday exercise her supreme magistracy; that he should yet live to behold\r\nten millions of fellow-citizens paying him the homage of their deepest\r\ngratitude and kindest affections; that he should see distinguished\r\ntalent and high public trust resting where his name rested; that he\r\nshould even see with his own unclouded eyes the close of the second\r\ncentury of New England, who had begun life almost with its\r\ncommencement, and lived through nearly half the whole history of his\r\ncountry; and that on the morning of this auspicious day he should be\r\nfound in the political councils of his native State, revising, by the\r\nlight of experience, that system of government which forty years before\r\nhe had assisted to frame and establish; and, great and happy as he\r\nshould then behold his country, there should be nothing in prospect to\r\ncloud the scene, nothing to check the ardor of that confident and\r\npatriotic hope which should glow in his bosom to the end of his long\r\nprotracted and happy life.\r\n\r\nIt would far exceed the limits of this discourse even to mention the\r\nprincipal events in the civil and political history of New England\r\nduring the century; the more so, as for the last half of the period\r\nthat history has, most happily, been closely interwoven with the\r\ngeneral history of the United States. New England bore an honorable\r\npart in the wars which took place between England and France. The\r\ncapture of Louisburg gave her a character for military achievement; and\r\nin the war which terminated with the peace of 1763, her exertions on\r\nthe frontiers were of most essential service, as well to the mother\r\ncountry as to all the Colonies.\r\n\r\nIn New England the war of the Revolution commenced. I address those who\r\nremember the memorable 19th of April, 1775; who shortly after saw the\r\nburning spires of Charlestown; who beheld the deeds of Prescott, and\r\nheard the voice of Putnam amidst the storm of war, and saw the generous\r\nWarren fall, the first distinguished victim in the cause of liberty. It\r\nwould be superfluous to say, that no portion of the country did more\r\nthan the States of New England to bring the Revolutionary struggle to a\r\nsuccessful issue. It is scarcely less to her credit, that she saw early\r\nthe necessity of a closer union of the States, and gave an efficient\r\nand indispensable aid to the establishment and organization of the\r\nFederal government.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we might safely say, that a new spirit and a new excitement\r\nbegan to exist here about the middle of the last century. To whatever\r\ncauses it may be imputed, there seems then to have commenced a more\r\nrapid improvement. The Colonies had attracted more of the attention of\r\nthe mother country, and some renown in arms had been acquired. Lord\r\nChatham was the first English minister who attached high importance to\r\nthese possessions of the crown, and who foresaw any thing of their\r\nfuture growth and extension. His opinion was, that the great rival of\r\nEngland was chiefly to be feared as a maritime and commercial power,\r\nand to drive her out of North America and deprive her of her West\r\nIndian possessions was a leading object in his policy. He dwelt often\r\non the fisheries, as nurseries for British seamen, and the colonial\r\ntrade, as furnishing them employment. The war, conducted by him with so\r\nmuch vigor, terminated in a peace, by which Canada was ceded to\r\nEngland. The effect of this was immediately visible in the New England\r\nColonies; for, the fear of Indian hostilities on the frontiers being\r\nnow happily removed, settlements went on with an activity before that\r\ntime altogether unprecedented, and public affairs wore a new and\r\nencouraging aspect. Shortly after this fortunate termination of the\r\nFrench war, the interesting topics connected with the taxation of\r\nAmerica by the British Parliament began to be discussed, and the\r\nattention and all the faculties of the people drawn towards them. There\r\nis perhaps no portion of our history more full of interest than the\r\nperiod from 1760 to the actual commencement of the war. The progress of\r\nopinion in this period, though less known, is not less important than\r\nthe progress of arms afterwards. Nothing deserves more consideration\r\nthan those events and discussions which affected the public sentiment\r\nand settled the Revolution in men's minds, before hostilities openly\r\nbroke out.\r\n\r\nInternal improvement followed the establishment and prosperous\r\ncommencement of the present government. More has been done for roads,\r\ncanals, and other public works, within the last thirty years, than in\r\nall our former history. In the first of these particulars, few\r\ncountries excel the New England States. The astonishing increase of\r\ntheir navigation and trade is known to every one, and now belongs to\r\nthe history of our national wealth.\r\n\r\nWe may flatter ourselves, too, that literature and taste have not been\r\nstationary, and that some advancement has been made in the elegant, as\r\nwell as in the useful arts.\r\n\r\nThe nature and constitution of society and government in this country\r\nare interesting topics, to which I would devote what remains of the\r\ntime allowed to this occasion. Of our system of government the first\r\nthing to be said is, that it is really and practically a free system.\r\nIt originates entirely with the people, and rests on no other\r\nfoundation than their assent. To judge of its actual operation, it is\r\nnot enough to look merely at the form of its construction. The\r\npractical character of government depends often on a variety of\r\nconsiderations, besides the abstract frame of its constitutional\r\norganization. Among these are the condition and tenure of property; the\r\nlaws regulating its alienation and descent; the presence or absence of\r\na military power; an armed or unarmed yeomanry; the spirit of the age,\r\nand the degree of general intelligence. In these respects it cannot be\r\ndenied that the circumstances of this country are most favorable to the\r\nhope of maintaining the government of a great nation on principles\r\nentirely popular. In the absence of military power, the nature of\r\ngovernment must essentially depend on the manner in which property is\r\nholden and distributed. There is a natural influence belonging to\r\nproperty, whether it exists in many hands or few; and it is on the\r\nrights of property that both despotism and unrestrained popular\r\nviolence ordinarily commence their attacks. Our ancestors began their\r\nsystem of government here under a condition of comparative equality in\r\nregard to wealth, and their early laws were of a nature to favor and\r\ncontinue this equality.\r\n\r\nA republican form of government rests not more on political\r\nconstitutions, than on those laws which regulate the descent and\r\ntransmission of property. Governments like ours could not have been\r\nmaintained, where property was holden according to the principles of\r\nthe feudal system; nor, on the other hand, could the feudal\r\nconstitution possibly exist with us. Our New England ancestors brought\r\nhither no great capitals from Europe; and if they had, there was\r\nnothing productive in which they could have been invested. They left\r\nbehind them the whole feudal policy of the other continent. They broke\r\naway at once from the system of military service established in the\r\nDark Ages, and which continues, down even to the present time, more or\r\nless to affect the condition of property all over Europe. They came to\r\na new country. There were, as yet, no lands yielding rent, and no\r\ntenants rendering service. The whole soil was unreclaimed from\r\nbarbarism. They were themselves, either from their original condition,\r\nor from the necessity of their common interest, nearly on a general\r\nlevel in respect to property. Their situation demanded a parcelling out\r\nand division of the lands, and it may be fairly said, that this\r\nnecessary act _fixed the future frame and form of their government_.\r\nThe character of their political institutions was determined by the\r\nfundamental laws respecting property. The laws rendered estates\r\ndivisible among sons and daughters. The right of primogeniture, at\r\nfirst limited and curtailed, was afterwards abolished. The property was\r\nall freehold. The entailment of estates, long trusts, and the other\r\nprocesses for fettering and tying up inheritances, were not applicable\r\nto the condition of society, and seldom made use of. On the contrary,\r\nalienation of the land was every way facilitated, even to the\r\nsubjecting of it to every species of debt. The establishment of public\r\nregistries, and the simplicity of our forms of conveyance, have greatly\r\nfacilitated the change of real estate from one proprietor to another.\r\nThe consequence of all these causes has been a great subdivision of the\r\nsoil, and a great equality of condition; the true basis, most\r\ncertainly, of a popular government. \"If the people,\" says Harrington,\r\n\"hold three parts in four of the territory, it is plain there can\r\nneither be any single person nor nobility able to dispute the\r\ngovernment with them; in this case, therefore, _except force be\r\ninterposed_, they govern themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of other nations may teach us how favorable to public\r\nliberty are the division of the soil into small freeholds, and a system\r\nof laws, of which the tendency is, without violence or injustice, to\r\nproduce and to preserve a degree of equality of property. It has been\r\nestimated, if I mistake not, that about the time of Henry the Seventh\r\nfour fifths of the land in England was holden by the great barons and\r\necclesiastics. The effects of a growing commerce soon afterwards began\r\nto break in on this state of things, and before the Revolution, in\r\n1688, a vast change had been wrought. It may be thought probable, that,\r\nfor the last half-century, the process of subdivision in England has\r\nbeen retarded, if not reversed; that the great weight of taxation has\r\ncompelled many of the lesser freeholders to dispose of their estates,\r\nand to seek employment in the army and navy, in the professions of\r\ncivil life, in commerce, or in the colonies. The effect of this on the\r\nBritish constitution cannot but be most unfavorable. A few large\r\nestates grow larger; but the number of those who have no estates also\r\nincreases; and there may be danger, lest the inequality of property\r\nbecome so great, that those who possess it may be dispossessed by\r\nforce; in other words, that the government may be overturned.\r\n\r\nA most interesting experiment of the effect of a subdivision of\r\nproperty on government is now making in France. It is understood, that\r\nthe law regulating the transmission of property in that country, now\r\ndivides it, real and personal, among all the children equally, both\r\nsons and daughters; and that there is, also, a very great restraint on\r\nthe power of making dispositions of property by will. It has been\r\nsupposed, that the effects of this might probably be, in time, to break\r\nup the soil into such small subdivisions, that the proprietors would be\r\ntoo poor to resist the encroachments of executive power. I think far\r\notherwise. What is lost in individual wealth will be more than gained\r\nin numbers, in intelligence, and in a sympathy of sentiment. If,\r\nindeed, only one or a few landholders were to resist the crown, like\r\nthe barons of England, they must, of course, be great and powerful\r\nlandholders, with multitudes of retainers, to promise success. But if\r\nthe proprietors of a given extent of territory are summoned to\r\nresistance, there is no reason to believe that such resistance would be\r\nless forcible, or less successful, because the number of such\r\nproprietors happened to be great. Each would perceive his own\r\nimportance, and his own interest, and would feel that natural elevation\r\nof character which the consciousness of property inspires. A common\r\nsentiment would unite all, and numbers would not only add strength, but\r\nexcite enthusiasm. It is true, that France possesses a vast military\r\nforce, under the direction of an hereditary executive government; and\r\nmilitary power, it is possible, may overthrow any government. It is in\r\nvain, however, in this period of the world, to look for security\r\nagainst military power to the arm of the great landholders. That notion\r\nis derived from a state of things long since past; a state in which a\r\nfeudal baron, with his retainers, might stand against the sovereign and\r\nhis retainers, himself but the greatest baron. But at present, what\r\ncould the richest landholder do, against one regiment of disciplined\r\ntroops? Other securities, therefore, against the prevalence of military\r\npower must be provided. Happily for us, we are not so situated as that\r\nany purpose of national defence requires, ordinarily and constantly,\r\nsuch a military force as might seriously endanger our liberties.\r\n\r\nIn respect, however, to the recent law of succession in France, to\r\nwhich I have alluded, I would, presumptuously perhaps, hazard a\r\nconjecture, that, if the government do not change the law, the law in\r\nhalf a century will change the government; and that this change will\r\nbe, not in favor of the power of the crown, as some European writers\r\nhave supposed, but against it. Those writers only reason upon what they\r\nthink correct general principles, in relation to this subject. They\r\nacknowledge a want of experience. Here we have had that experience; and\r\nwe know that a multitude of small proprietors, acting with\r\nintelligence, and that enthusiasm which a common cause inspires,\r\nconstitute not only a formidable, but an invincible power.\r\n\r\nThe true principle of a free and popular government would seem to be,\r\nso to construct it as to give to all, or at least to a very great\r\nmajority, an interest in its preservation; to found it, as other things\r\nare founded, on men's interest. The stability of government demands\r\nthat those who desire its continuance should be more powerful than\r\nthose who desire its dissolution. This power, of course, is not always\r\nto be measured by mere numbers. Education, wealth, talents, are all\r\nparts and elements of the general aggregate of power; but numbers,\r\nnevertheless, constitute ordinarily the most important consideration,\r\nunless, indeed, there be _a military force_ in the hands of the few, by\r\nwhich they can control the many. In this country we have actually\r\nexisting systems of government, in the maintenance of which, it should\r\nseem, a great majority, both in numbers and in other means of power and\r\ninfluence, must see their interest. But this state of things is not\r\nbrought about solely by written political constitutions, or the mere\r\nmanner of organizing the government; but also by the laws which\r\nregulate the descent and transmission of property. The freest\r\ngovernment, if it could exist, would not be long acceptable, if the\r\ntendency of the laws were to create a rapid accumulation of property in\r\nfew hands, and to render the great mass of the population dependent and\r\npenniless. In such a case, the popular power would be likely to break\r\nin upon the rights of property, or else the influence of property to\r\nlimit and control the exercise of popular power. Universal suffrage,\r\nfor example, could not long exist in a community where there was great\r\ninequality of property. The holders of estates would be obliged, in\r\nsuch case, in some way to restrain the right of suffrage, or else such\r\nright of suffrage would, before long, divide the property. In the\r\nnature of things, those who have not property, and see their neighbors\r\npossess much more than they think them to need, cannot be favorable to\r\nlaws made for the protection of property. When this class becomes\r\nnumerous, it grows clamorous. It looks on property as its prey and\r\nplunder, and is naturally ready, at all times, for violence and\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, to be the part of political wisdom to found\r\ngovernment on property; and to establish such distribution of property,\r\nby the laws which regulate its transmission and alienation, as to\r\ninterest the great majority of society in the support of the\r\ngovernment. This is, I imagine, the true theory and the actual practice\r\nof our republican institutions. With property divided as we have it, no\r\nother government than that of a republic could be maintained, even were\r\nwe foolish enough to desire it. There is reason, therefore, to expect a\r\nlong continuance of our system. Party and passion, doubtless, may\r\nprevail at times, and much temporary mischief be done. Even modes and\r\nforms may be changed, and perhaps for the worse. But a great revolution\r\nin regard to property must take place, before our governments can be\r\nmoved from their republican basis, unless they be violently struck off\r\nby military power. The people possess the property, more emphatically\r\nthan it could ever be said of the people of any other country, and they\r\ncan have no interest to overturn a government which protects that\r\nproperty by equal laws.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed, that this state of things possesses too strong\r\ntendencies towards the production of a dead and uninteresting level in\r\nsociety. Such tendencies are sufficiently counteracted by the infinite\r\ndiversities in the characters and fortunes of individuals. Talent,\r\nactivity, industry, and enterprise tend at all times to produce\r\ninequality and distinction; and there is room still for the\r\naccumulation of wealth, with its great advantages, to all reasonable\r\nand useful extent. It has been often urged against the state of society\r\nin America, that it furnishes no class of men of fortune and leisure.\r\nThis may be partly true, but it is not entirely so, and the evil, if it\r\nbe one, would affect rather the progress of taste and literature, than\r\nthe general prosperity of the people. But the promotion of taste and\r\nliterature cannot be primary objects of political institutions; and if\r\nthey could, it might be doubted whether, in the long course of things,\r\nas much is not gained by a wide diffusion of general knowledge, as is\r\nlost by diminishing the number of those who are enabled by fortune and\r\nleisure to devote themselves exclusively to scientific and literary\r\npursuits. However this may be, it is to be considered that it is the\r\nspirit of our system to be equal and general, and if there be\r\nparticular disadvantages incident to this, they are far more than\r\ncounterbalanced by the benefits which weigh against them. The important\r\nconcerns of society are generally conducted, in all countries, by the\r\nmen of business and practical ability; and even in matters of taste and\r\nliterature, the advantages of mere leisure are liable to be overrated.\r\nIf there exist adequate means of education and a love of letters be\r\nexcited, that love will find its way to the object of its desire,\r\nthrough the crowd and pressure of the most busy society.\r\n\r\nConnected with this division of property, and the consequent\r\nparticipation of the great mass of people in its possession and\r\nenjoyments, is the system of representation, which is admirably\r\naccommodated to our condition, better understood among us, and more\r\nfamiliarly and extensively practised, in the higher and in the lower\r\ndepartments of government, than it has been by any other people. Great\r\nfacility has been given to this in New England by the early division of\r\nthe country into townships or small districts, in which all concerns of\r\nlocal police are regulated, and in which representatives to the\r\nlegislature are elected. Nothing can exceed the utility of these little\r\nbodies. They are so many councils or parliaments, in which common\r\ninterests are discussed, and useful knowledge acquired and\r\ncommunicated. The division of governments into departments, and the\r\ndivision, again, of the legislative department into two chambers, are\r\nessential provisions in our system. This last, although not new in\r\nitself, yet seems to be new in its application to governments wholly\r\npopular. The Grecian republics, it is plain, knew nothing of it; and in\r\nRome, the check and balance of legislative power, such as it was, lay\r\nbetween the people and the senate. Indeed, few things are more\r\ndifficult than to ascertain accurately the true nature and construction\r\nof the Roman commonwealth. The relative power of the senate and the\r\npeople, of the consuls and the tribunes, appears not to have been at\r\nall times the same, nor at any time accurately defined or strictly\r\nobserved. Cicero, indeed, describes to us an admirable arrangement of\r\npolitical power, and a balance of the constitution, in that beautiful\r\npassage, in which he compares the democracies of Greece with the Roman\r\ncommonwealth. \"O morem preclarum, disciplinamque, quam a majoribus,\r\naccepimus, si quidem teneremus! sed nescio quo pacto jam de manibus\r\nelabitur. Nullam enim illi nostri sapientissimi et sanctissimi viri vim\r\nconcionis esse voluerunt, quae scisseret plebs, aut quae populus\r\njuberet; summota concione, distributis partibus, tributim et\r\ncenturiatim descriptis ordinibus, classibus, aetatibus, auditis\r\nauctoribus, re multos dies promulgata et cognita, juberi vetarique\r\nvoluerunt. Graecorum autem totae respublicae sedentis concionis\r\ntemeritate administrantur.\" [10]\r\n\r\nBut at what time this wise system existed in this perfection at Rome,\r\nno proofs remain to show. Her constitution, originally framed for a\r\nmonarchy, never seemed to be adjusted in its several parts after the\r\nexpulsion of the kings. Liberty there was, but it was a disputatious,\r\nan uncertain, an ill-secured liberty. The patrician and plebeian\r\norders, instead of being matched and joined, each in its just place and\r\nproportion, to sustain the fabric of the state, were rather like\r\nhostile powers, in perpetual conflict. With us, an attempt has been\r\nmade, and so far not without success, to divide representation into\r\nchambers, and, by difference of age, character, qualification, or mode\r\nof election, to establish salutary checks, in governments altogether\r\nelective.\r\n\r\nHaving detained you so long with these observations, I must yet advert\r\nto another most interesting topic,--the Free Schools. In this\r\nparticular, New England may be allowed to claim, I think, a merit of a\r\npeculiar character. She early adopted, and has constantly maintained\r\nthe principle, that it is the undoubted right and the bounden duty of\r\ngovernment to provide for the instruction of all youth. That which is\r\nelsewhere left to chance or to charity, we secure by law. [11] For the\r\npurpose of public instruction, we hold every man subject to taxation in\r\nproportion to his property, and we look not to the question, whether he\r\nhimself have, or have not, children to be benefited by the education\r\nfor which he pays. We regard it as a wise and liberal system of police,\r\nby which property, and life, and the peace of society are secured. We\r\nseek to prevent in some measure the extension of the penal code, by\r\ninspiring a salutary and conservative principle of virtue and of\r\nknowledge in an early age. We strive to excite a feeling of\r\nrespectability, and a sense of character, by enlarging the capacity and\r\nincreasing the sphere of intellectual enjoyment. By general\r\ninstruction, we seek, as far as possible, to purify the whole moral\r\natmosphere; to keep good sentiments uppermost, and to turn the strong\r\ncurrent of feeling and opinion, as well as the censures of the law and\r\nthe denunciations of religion, against immorality and crime. We hope\r\nfor a security beyond the law, and above the law, in the prevalence of\r\nan enlightened and well-principled moral sentiment. We hope to continue\r\nand prolong the time, when, in the villages and farm-houses of New\r\nEngland, there may be undisturbed sleep within unbarred doors. And\r\nknowing that our government rests directly on the public will, in order\r\nthat we may preserve it we endeavor to give a safe and proper direction\r\nto that public will. We do not, indeed, expect all men to be\r\nphilosophers or statesmen; but we confidently trust, and our\r\nexpectation of the duration of our system of government rests on that\r\ntrust, that, by the diffusion of general knowledge and good and\r\nvirtuous sentiments, the political fabric may be secure, as well\r\nagainst open violence and overthrow, as against the slow, but sure,\r\nundermining of licentiousness.\r\n\r\nWe know that, at the present time, an attempt is making in the English\r\nParliament to provide by law for the education of the poor, and that a\r\ngentleman of distinguished character (Mr. Brougham) has taken the lead\r\nin presenting a plan to government for carrying that purpose into\r\neffect. And yet, although the representatives of the three kingdoms\r\nlistened to him with astonishment as well as delight, we hear no\r\nprinciples with which we ourselves have not been familiar from youth;\r\nwe see nothing in the plan but an approach towards that system which\r\nhas been established in New England for more than a century and a half.\r\nIt is said that in England not more than _one child in fifteen_\r\npossesses the means of being taught to read and write; in Wales, _one\r\nin twenty_; in France, until lately, when some improvement was made,\r\nnot more than _one in thirty-five_. Now, it is hardly too strong to\r\nsay, that in New England _every child possesses_ such means. It would\r\nbe difficult to find an instance to the contrary, unless where it\r\nshould be owing to the negligence of the parent; and, in truth, the\r\nmeans are actually used and enjoyed by nearly every one. A youth of\r\nfifteen, of either sex, who cannot both read and write, is very seldom\r\nto be found. Who can make this comparison, or contemplate this\r\nspectacle, without delight and a feeling of just pride? Does any\r\nhistory show property more beneficently applied? Did any government\r\never subject the property of those who have estates to a burden, for a\r\npurpose more favorable to the poor, or more useful to the whole\r\ncommunity?\r\n\r\nA conviction of the importance of public instruction was one of the\r\nearliest sentiments of our ancestors. No lawgiver of ancient or modern\r\ntimes has expressed more just opinions, or adopted wiser measures, than\r\nthe early records of the Colony of Plymouth show to have prevailed\r\nhere. Assembled on this very spot, a hundred and fifty-three years ago,\r\nthe legislature of this Colony declared, \"Forasmuch as the maintenance\r\nof good literature doth much tend to the advancement of the weal and\r\nflourishing state of societies and republics, this Court doth therefore\r\norder, that in whatever township in this government, consisting of\r\nfifty families or upwards, any meet man shall be obtained to teach a\r\ngrammar school, such township shall allow at least twelve pounds, to be\r\nraised by rate on all the inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nHaving provided that all youth should be instructed in the elements of\r\nlearning by the institution of free schools, our ancestors had yet\r\nanother duty to perform. Men were to be educated for the professions\r\nand the public. For this purpose they founded the University, and with\r\nincredible zeal and perseverance they cherished and supported it,\r\nthrough all trials and discouragements.[12] On the subject of the\r\nUniversity, it is not possible for a son of New England to think\r\nwithout pleasure, or to speak without emotion. Nothing confers more\r\nhonor on the State where it is established, or more utility on the\r\ncountry at large. A respectable university is an establishment which\r\nmust be the work of time. If pecuniary means were not wanting, no new\r\ninstitution could possess character and respectability at once. We owe\r\ndeep obligation to our ancestors, who began, almost on the moment of\r\ntheir arrival, the work of building up this institution.\r\n\r\nAlthough established in a different government, the Colony of Plymouth\r\nmanifested warm friendship for Harvard College. At an early period, its\r\ngovernment took measures to promote a general subscription throughout\r\nall the towns in this Colony, in aid of its small funds. Other colleges\r\nwere subsequently founded and endowed, in other places, as the ability\r\nof the people allowed; and we may flatter ourselves, that the means of\r\neducation at present enjoyed in New England are not only adequate to\r\nthe diffusion of the elements of knowledge among all classes, but\r\nsufficient also for respectable attainments in literature and the\r\nsciences.\r\n\r\nLastly, our ancestors established their system of government on\r\nmorality and religious sentiment. Moral habits, they believed, cannot\r\nsafely be trusted on any other foundation than religious principle, nor\r\nany government be secure which is not supported by moral habits. Living\r\nunder the heavenly light of revelation, they hoped to find all the\r\nsocial dispositions, all the duties which men owe to each other and to\r\nsociety, enforced and performed. Whatever makes men good Christians,\r\nmakes them good citizens. Our fathers came here to enjoy their religion\r\nfree and unmolested; and, at the end of two centuries, there is nothing\r\nupon which we can pronounce more confidently, nothing of which we can\r\nexpress a more deep and earnest conviction, than of the inestimable\r\nimportance of that religion to man, both in regard to this life and\r\nthat which is to come.\r\n\r\nIf the blessings of our political and social condition have not been\r\ntoo highly estimated, we cannot well overrate the responsibility and\r\nduty which they impose upon us. We hold these institutions of\r\ngovernment, religion, and learning, to be transmitted, as well as\r\nenjoyed. We are in the line of conveyance, through which whatever has\r\nbeen obtained by the spirit and efforts of our ancestors is to be\r\ncommunicated to our children.\r\n\r\nWe are bound to maintain public liberty, and, by the example of our own\r\nsystems, to convince the world that order and law, religion and\r\nmorality, the rights of conscience, the rights of persons, and the\r\nrights of property, may all be preserved and secured, in the most\r\nperfect manner, by a government entirely and purely elective. If we\r\nfail in this, our disaster will be signal, and will furnish an\r\nargument, stronger than has yet been found, in support of those\r\nopinions which maintain that government can rest safely on nothing but\r\npower and coercion. As far as experience may show errors in our\r\nestablishments, we are bound to correct them; and if any practices\r\nexist contrary to the principles of justice and humanity within the\r\nreach of our laws or our influence, we are inexcusable if we do not\r\nexert ourselves to restrain and abolish them.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty on this occasion to suggest, that the land is not yet\r\nwholly free from the contamination of a traffic, at which every feeling\r\nof humanity must forever revolt,--I mean the African slave-trade.\r\nNeither public sentiment, nor the law, has hitherto been able entirely\r\nto put an end to this odious and abominable trade. At the moment when\r\nGod in his mercy has blessed the Christian world with a universal\r\npeace, there is reason to fear, that, to the disgrace of the Christian\r\nname and character, new efforts are making for the extension of this\r\ntrade by subjects and citizens of Christian states, in whose hearts\r\nthere dwell no sentiments of humanity or of justice, and over whom\r\nneither the fear of God nor the fear of man exercises a control. In the\r\nsight of our law, the African slave-trader is a pirate and a felon; and\r\nin the sight of Heaven, an offender far beyond the ordinary depth of\r\nhuman guilt. There is no brighter page of our history, than that which\r\nrecords the measures which have been adopted by the government at an\r\nearly day, and at different times since, for the suppression of this\r\ntraffic; and I would call on all the true sons of New England to\r\ncooperate with the laws of man, and the justice of Heaven. If there be,\r\nwithin the extent of our knowledge or influence, any participation in\r\nthis traffic, let us pledge ourselves here, upon the rock of Plymouth,\r\nto extirpate and destroy it. It is not fit that the land of the\r\nPilgrims should bear the shame longer. I hear the sound of the hammer,\r\nI see the smoke of the furnaces where manacles and fetters are still\r\nforged for human limbs. I see the visages of those who by stealth and\r\nat midnight labor in this work of hell, foul and dark, as may become\r\nthe artificers of such instruments of misery and torture. Let that spot\r\nbe purified, or let it cease to be of New England. Let it be purified\r\nor let it be set aside from the Christian world; let it be put out of\r\nthe circle of human sympathies and human regards, and let civilized man\r\nhenceforth have no communion with it.\r\n\r\nI would invoke those who fill the seats of justice, and all who\r\nminister at her altar, that they execute the wholesome and necessary\r\nseverity of the law. I invoke the ministers of our religion, that they\r\nproclaim its denunciation of these crimes, and add its solemn sanctions\r\nto the authority of human laws. If the pulpit be silent whenever or\r\nwherever there may be a sinner bloody with this guilt within the\r\nhearing of its voice, the pulpit is false to its trust. I call on the\r\nfair merchant, who has reaped his harvest upon the seas, that he assist\r\nin scourging from those seas the worst pirates that ever infested them.\r\nThat ocean, which seems to wave with a gentle magnificence to waft the\r\nburden of an honest commerce, and to roll along its treasures with a\r\nconscious pride,--that ocean, which hardy industry regards, even when\r\nthe winds have ruffled its surface, as a field of grateful toil,--what\r\nis it to the victim of this oppression, when he is brought to its\r\nshores, and looks forth upon it, for the first time, loaded with\r\nchains, and bleeding with stripes? What is it to him but a wide-spread\r\nprospect of suffering, anguish, and death? Nor do the skies smile\r\nlonger, nor is the air longer fragrant to him. The sun is cast down\r\nfrom heaven. An inhuman and accursed traffic has cut him off in his\r\nmanhood, or in his youth, from every enjoyment belonging to his being,\r\nand every blessing which his Creator intended for him.\r\n\r\nThe Christian communities send forth their emissaries of religion and\r\nletters, who stop, here and there, along the coast of the vast\r\ncontinent of Africa, and with painful and tedious efforts make some\r\nalmost imperceptible progress in the communication of knowledge, and in\r\nthe general improvement of the natives who are immediately about them.\r\nNot thus slow and imperceptible is the transmission of the vices and\r\nbad passions which the subjects of Christian states carry to the land.\r\nThe slave-trade having touched the coast, its influence and its evils\r\nspread, like a pestilence, over the whole continent, making savage wars\r\nmore savage and more frequent, and adding new and fierce passions to\r\nthe contests of barbarians.\r\n\r\nI pursue this topic no further, except again to say, that all\r\nChristendom, being now blessed with peace, is bound by everything which\r\nbelongs to its character, and to the character of the present age, to\r\nput a stop to this inhuman and disgraceful traffic.\r\n\r\nWe are bound, not only to maintain the general principles of public\r\nliberty, but to support also those existing forms of government which\r\nhave so well secured its enjoyment, and so highly promoted the public\r\nprosperity. It is now more than thirty years that these States have\r\nbeen united under the Federal Constitution, and whatever fortune may\r\nawait them hereafter, it is impossible that this period of their\r\nhistory should not be regarded as distinguished by signal prosperity\r\nand success. They must be sanguine indeed, who can hope for benefit\r\nfrom change. Whatever division of the public judgment may have existed\r\nin relation to particular measures of the government, all must agree,\r\none should think, in the opinion, that in its general course it has\r\nbeen eminently productive of public happiness. Its most ardent friends\r\ncould not well have hoped from it more than it has accomplished; and\r\nthose who disbelieved or doubted ought to feel less concern about\r\npredictions which the event has not verified, than pleasure in the good\r\nwhich has been obtained. Whoever shall hereafter write this part of our\r\nhistory, although he may see occasional errors or defects, will be able\r\nto record no great failure in the ends and objects of government. Still\r\nless will he be able to record any series of lawless and despotic acts,\r\nor any successful usurpation. His page will contain no exhibition of\r\nprovinces depopulated, of civil authority habitually trampled down by\r\nmilitary power, or of a community crushed by the burden of taxation. He\r\nwill speak, rather, of public liberty protected, and public happiness\r\nadvanced; of increased revenue, and population augmented beyond all\r\nexample; of the growth of commerce, manufactures, and the arts; and of\r\nthat happy condition, in which the restraint and coercion of government\r\nare almost invisible and imperceptible, and its influence felt only in\r\nthe benefits which it confers. We can entertain no better wish for our\r\ncountry, than that this government may be preserved; nor have a clearer\r\nduty than to maintain and support it in the full exercise of all its\r\njust constitutional powers.\r\n\r\nThe cause of science and literature also imposes upon us an important\r\nand delicate trust. The wealth and population of the country are now so\r\nfar advanced, as to authorize the expectation of a correct literature\r\nand a well formed taste, as well as respectable progress in the\r\nabstruse sciences. The country has risen from a state of colonial\r\nsubjection; it has established an independent government, and is now in\r\nthe undisturbed enjoyment of peace and political security. The elements\r\nof knowledge are universally diffused, and the reading portion of the\r\ncommunity is large. Let us hope that the present may be an auspicious\r\nera of literature. If, almost on the day of their landing, our\r\nancestors founded schools and endowed colleges, what obligations do not\r\nrest upon us, living under circumstances so much more favorable both\r\nfor providing and for using the means of education? Literature becomes\r\nfree institutions. It is the graceful ornament of civil liberty, and a\r\nhappy restraint on the asperities which political controversies\r\nsometimes occasion. Just taste is not only an embellishment of society,\r\nbut it rises almost to the rank of the virtues, and diffuses positive\r\ngood throughout the whole extent of its influence. There is a\r\nconnection between right feeling and right principles, and truth in\r\ntaste is allied with truth in morality. With nothing in our past\r\nhistory to discourage us, and with something in our present condition\r\nand prospects to animate us, let us hope, that, as it is our fortune to\r\nlive in an age when we may behold a wonderful advancement of the\r\ncountry in all its other great interests, we may see also equal\r\nprogress and success attend the cause of letters.\r\n\r\nFinally, let us not forget the religious character of our origin. Our\r\nfathers were brought hither by their high veneration for the Christian\r\nreligion. They journeyed by its light, and labored in its hope. They\r\nsought to incorporate its principles with the elements of their\r\nsociety, and to diffuse its influence through all their institutions,\r\ncivil, political, or literary. Let us cherish these sentiments, and\r\nextend this influence still more widely; in the full conviction, that\r\nthat is the happiest society which partakes in the highest degree of\r\nthe mild and peaceful spirit of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe hours of this day are rapidly flying, and this occasion will soon\r\nbe passed. Neither we nor our children can expect to behold its return.\r\nThey are in the distant regions of futurity, they exist only in the\r\nall-creating power of God, who shall stand here a hundred years hence,\r\nto trace, through us, their descent from the Pilgrims, and to survey,\r\nas we have now surveyed, the progress of their country, during the\r\nlapse of a century. We would anticipate their concurrence with us in\r\nour sentiments of deep regard for our common ancestors. We would\r\nanticipate and partake the pleasure with which they will then recount\r\nthe steps of New England's advancement. On the morning of that day,\r\nalthough it will not disturb us in our repose, the voice of acclamation\r\nand gratitude, commencing on the Rock of Plymouth, shall be transmitted\r\nthrough millions of the sons of the Pilgrims, till it lose itself in\r\nthe murmurs of the Pacific seas.\r\n\r\nWe would leave for the consideration of those who shall then occupy our\r\nplaces, some proof that we hold the blessings transmitted from our\r\nfathers in just estimation; some proof of our attachment to the cause\r\nof good government, and of civil and religious liberty; some proof of a\r\nsincere and ardent desire to promote every thing which may enlarge the\r\nunderstandings and improve the hearts of men. And when, from the long\r\ndistance of a hundred years, they shall look back upon us, they shall\r\nknow, at least, that we possessed affections, which, running backward\r\nand warming with gratitude for what our ancestors have done for our\r\nhappiness, run forward also to our posterity, and meet them with\r\ncordial salutation, ere yet they have arrived on the shore of being.\r\n\r\nAdvance, then, ye future generations! We would hail you, as you rise in\r\nyour long succession, to fill the places which we now fill, and to\r\ntaste the blessings of existence where we are passing, and soon shall\r\nhave passed, our own human duration. We bid you welcome to this\r\npleasant land of the fathers. We bid you welcome to the healthful skies\r\nand the verdant fields of New England. We greet your accession to the\r\ngreat inheritance which we have enjoyed. We welcome you to the\r\nblessings of good government and religious liberty. We welcome you to\r\nthe treasures of science and the delights of learning. We welcome you\r\nto the transcendent sweets of domestic life, to the happiness of\r\nkindred, and parents, and children. We welcome you to the immeasurable\r\nblessings of rational existence, the immortal hope of Christianity, and\r\nthe light of everlasting truth!\r\n\r\nTHE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT.\r\n\r\nThis uncounted multitude before me and around me proves the feeling\r\nwhich the occasion has excited. These thousands of human faces, glowing\r\nwith sympathy and joy, and from the impulses of a common gratitude\r\nturned reverently to heaven in this spacious temple of the firmament,\r\nproclaim that the day, the place, and the purpose of our assembling\r\nhave made a deep impression on our hearts.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, there be anything in local association fit to affect the\r\nmind of man, we need not strive to repress the emotions which agitate\r\nus here. We are among the sepulchres of our fathers. We are on ground,\r\ndistinguished by their valor, their constancy, and the shedding of\r\ntheir blood. We are here, not to fix an uncertain date in our annals,\r\nnor to draw into notice an obscure and unknown spot. If our humble\r\npurpose had never been conceived, if we ourselves had never been born,\r\nthe 17th of June, 1775, would have been a day on which all subsequent\r\nhistory would have poured its light, and the eminence where we stand a\r\npoint of attraction to the eyes of successive generations. But we are\r\nAmericans. We live in what may be called the early age of this great\r\ncontinent; and we know that our posterity, through all time, are here\r\nto enjoy and suffer the allotments of humanity. We see before us a\r\nprobable train of great events; we know that our own fortunes have been\r\nhappily cast; and it is natural, therefore, that we should be moved by\r\nthe contemplation of occurrences which have guided our destiny before\r\nmany of us were born, and settled the condition in which we should pass\r\nthat portion of our existence which God allows to men on earth.\r\n\r\nWe do not read even of the discovery of this continent, without feeling\r\nsomething of a personal interest in the event; without being reminded\r\nhow much it has affected our own fortunes and our own existence. It\r\nwould be still more unnatural for us, therefore, than for others, to\r\ncontemplate with unaffected minds that interesting, I may say that most\r\ntouching and pathetic scene, when the great discoverer of America stood\r\non the deck of his shattered bark, the shades of night falling on the\r\nsea, yet no man sleeping; tossed on the billows of an unknown ocean,\r\nyet the stronger billows of alternate hope and despair tossing his own\r\ntroubled thoughts; extending forward his harassed frame, straining\r\nwestward his anxious and eager eyes, till Heaven at last granted him a\r\nmoment of rapture and ecstasy, in blessing his vision with the sight of\r\nthe unknown world.\r\n\r\nNearer to our times, more closely connected with our fates, and\r\ntherefore still more interesting to our feelings and affections, is the\r\nsettlement of our own country by colonists from England. We cherish\r\nevery memorial of these worthy ancestors; we celebrate their patience\r\nand fortitude; we admire their daring enterprise; we teach our children\r\nto venerate their piety; and we are justly proud of being descended\r\nfrom men who have set the world an example of founding civil\r\ninstitutions on the great and united principles of human freedom and\r\nhuman knowledge. To us, their children, the story of their labors and\r\nsufferings can never be without its interest. We shall not stand\r\nunmoved on the shore of Plymouth, while the sea continues to wash it;\r\nnor will our brethren in another early and ancient Colony forget the\r\nplace of its first establishment, till their river shall cease to flow\r\nby it. [1] No vigor of youth, no maturity of manhood, will lead the\r\nnation to forget the spots where its infancy was cradled and defended.\r\n\r\nBut the great event in the history of the continent, which we are now\r\nmet here to commemorate, that prodigy of modern times, at once the\r\nwonder and the blessing of the world, is the American Revolution. In a\r\nday of extraordinary prosperity and happiness, of high national honor,\r\ndistinction, and power, we are brought together, in this place, by our\r\nlove of country, by our admiration of exalted character, by our\r\ngratitude for signal services and patriotic devotion.\r\n\r\nThe Society whose organ I am [2] was formed for the purpose of rearing\r\nsome honorable and durable monument to the memory of the early friends\r\nof American Independence. They have thought, that for this object no\r\ntime could be more propitious than the present prosperous and peaceful\r\nperiod; that no place could claim preference over this memorable spot;\r\nand that no day could be more auspicious to the undertaking than the\r\nanniversary of the battle which was here fought. The foundation of that\r\nmonument we have now laid. With solemnities suited to the occasion,\r\nwith prayers to Almighty God for his blessing, and in the midst of this\r\ncloud of witnesses, we have begun the work. We trust it will be\r\nprosecuted, and that, springing from a broad foundation, rising high in\r\nmassive solidity and unadorned grandeur, it may remain as long as\r\nHeaven permits the works of men to last, a fit emblem, both of the\r\nevents in memory of which it is raised, and of the gratitude of those\r\nwho have reared it.\r\n\r\nWe know, indeed, that the record of illustrious actions is most safely\r\ndeposited in the universal remembrance of mankind. We know, that if we\r\ncould cause this structure to ascend, not only till it reached the\r\nskies, but till it pierced them, its broad surfaces could still contain\r\nbut part of that which, in an age of knowledge, hath already been\r\nspread over the earth, and which history charges itself with making\r\nknown to all future times. We know that no inscription on entablatures\r\nless broad than the earth itself can carry information of the events we\r\ncommemorate where it has not already gone; and that no structure, which\r\nshall not outlive the duration of letters and knowledge among men, can\r\nprolong the memorial. But our object is, by this edifice, to show our\r\nown deep sense of the value and importance of the achievements of our\r\nancestors; and, by presenting this work of gratitude to the eye, to\r\nkeep alive similar sentiments, and to foster a constant regard for the\r\nprinciples of the Revolution. Human beings are composed, not of reason\r\nonly, but of imagination also, and sentiment; and that is neither\r\nwasted nor misapplied which is appropriated to the purpose of giving\r\nright direction to sentiments, and opening proper springs of feeling in\r\nthe heart. Let it not be supposed that our object is to perpetuate\r\nnational hostility, or even to cherish a mere military spirit. It is\r\nhigher, purer, nobler. We consecrate our work to the spirit of national\r\nindependence, and we wish that the light of peace may rest upon it\r\nforever. We rear a memorial of our conviction of that unmeasured\r\nbenefit which has been conferred on our own land, and of the happy\r\ninfluences which have been produced, by the same events, on the general\r\ninterests of mankind. We come, as Americans, to mark a spot which must\r\nforever be dear to us and our posterity. We wish that whosoever, in all\r\ncoming time, shall turn his eye hither, may behold that the place is\r\nnot undistinguished where the first great battle of the Revolution was\r\nfought. We wish that this structure may proclaim the magnitude and\r\nimportance of that event to every class and every age. We wish that\r\ninfancy may learn the purpose of its erection from maternal lips, and\r\nthat weary and withered age may behold it, and be solaced by the\r\nrecollections which it suggests. We wish that labor may look up here,\r\nand be proud, in the midst of its toil. We wish that, in those days of\r\ndisaster, which, as they come upon all nations, must be expected to\r\ncome upon us also, desponding patriotism may turn its eyes hitherward,\r\nand be assured that the foundations of our national power are still\r\nstrong. We wish that this column, rising towards heaven among the\r\npointed spires of so many temples dedicated to God, may contribute also\r\nto produce, in all minds, a pious feeling of dependence and gratitude.\r\nWe wish, finally, that the last object to the sight of him who leaves\r\nhis native shore, and the first to gladden his who revisits it, may be\r\nsomething which shall remind him of the liberty and the glory of his\r\ncountry. Let it rise! let it rise, till it meet the sun in his coming;\r\nlet the earliest light of the morning gild it, and parting day linger\r\nand play on its summit.\r\n\r\nWe live in a most extraordinary age. Events so various and so important\r\nthat they might crowd and distinguish centuries are, in our times,\r\ncompressed within the compass of a single life. When has it happened\r\nthat history has had so much to record in the same term of years, as\r\nsince the 17th of June, 1775? Our own Revolution, which, under other\r\ncircumstances, might itself have been expected to occasion a war of\r\nhalf a century, has been achieved; twenty-four sovereign and\r\nindependent States erected; and a general government established over\r\nthem, so safe, so wise, so free, so practical, that we might well\r\nwonder its establishment should have been accomplished so soon, were it\r\nnot far the greater wonder that it should have been established at all.\r\nTwo or three millions of people have been augmented to twelve, [3] the\r\ngreat forests of the West prostrated beneath the arm of successful\r\nindustry, and the dwellers on the banks of the Ohio and the Mississippi\r\nbecome the fellow-citizens and neighbors of those who cultivate the\r\nhills of New England. [4] We have a commerce, that leaves no sea\r\nunexplored; navies, which take no law from superior force; revenues,\r\nadequate to all the exigencies of government, almost without taxation;\r\nand peace with all nations, founded on equal rights and mutual respect.\r\n\r\nEurope, within the same period, has been agitated by a mighty\r\nrevolution, which, while it has been felt in the individual condition\r\nand happiness of almost every man, has shaken to the centre her\r\npolitical fabric, and dashed against one another thrones which had\r\nstood tranquil for ages. On this, our continent, our own example has\r\nbeen followed, and colonies have sprung up to be nations. Unaccustomed\r\nsounds of liberty and free government have reached us from beyond the\r\ntrack of the sun; and at this moment the dominion of European power in\r\nthis continent, from the place where we stand to the south pole, is\r\nannihilated forever.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, both in Europe and America, such has been the general\r\nprogress of knowledge, such the improvement in legislation, in\r\ncommerce, in the arts, in letters, and, above all, in liberal ideas and\r\nthe general spirit of the age, that the whole world seems changed.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding that this is but a faint abstract of the things\r\nwhich have happened since the day of the battle of Bunker Hill, we are\r\nbut fifty years removed from it; and we now stand here to enjoy all the\r\nblessings of our own condition, and to look abroad on the brightened\r\nprospects of the world, while we still have among us some of those who\r\nwere active agents in the scenes of 1775, and who are now here, from\r\nevery quarter of New England, to visit once more, and under\r\ncircumstances so affecting, I had almost said so overwhelming, this\r\nrenowned theatre of their courage and patriotism.\r\n\r\nVENERABLE MEN! you have come down to us from a former generation.\r\nHeaven has bounteously lengthened out your lives, that you might behold\r\nthis joyous day. You are now where you stood fifty years ago, this very\r\nhour, with your brothers and your neighbors, shoulder to shoulder, in\r\nthe strife for your country. Behold, how altered! The same heavens are\r\nindeed over your heads; the same ocean rolls at your feet; but all\r\nelse, how changed! You hear now no roar of hostile cannon, you see no\r\nmixed volumes of smoke and flame rising from burning Charlestown. The\r\nground strewed with the dead and the dying; the impetuous charge; the\r\nsteady and successful repulse; the loud call to repeated assault; the\r\nsummoning of all that is manly to repeated resistance; a thousand\r\nbosoms freely and fearlessly bared in an instant to whatever of terror\r\nthere may be in war and death;--all these you have witnessed, but you\r\nwitness them no more. All is peace. The heights of yonder metropolis,\r\nits towers and roofs, which you then saw filled with wives and children\r\nand countrymen in distress and terror, and looking with unutterable\r\nemotions for the issue of the combat, have presented you to-day with\r\nthe sight of its whole happy population, come out to welcome and greet\r\nyou with a universal jubilee. Yonder proud ships, by a felicity of\r\nposition appropriately lying at the foot of this mount, and seeming\r\nfondly to cling around it, are not means of annoyance to you, but your\r\ncountry's own means of distinction and defence.[5] All is peace; and\r\nGod has granted you the sight of your country's happiness, ere you\r\nslumber in the grave. He has allowed you to behold and to partake the\r\nreward of your patriotic toils; and he has allowed us, your sons and\r\ncountrymen, to meet you here, and in the name of the present\r\ngeneration, in the name of your country, in the name of liberty, to\r\nthank you! [6]\r\n\r\nBut, alas! you are not all here! Time and the sword have thinned your\r\nranks. Prescott, Putnam, Stark, Brooks, Read, Pomeroy, Bridge! our eyes\r\nseek for you in vain amid this broken band. You are gathered to your\r\nfathers, and live only to your country in her grateful remembrance and\r\nyour own bright example. But let us not too much grieve, that you have\r\nmet the common fate of men. You lived at least long enough to know that\r\nyour work had been nobly and successfully accomplished. You lived to\r\nsee your country's independence established, and to sheathe your swords\r\nfrom war. On the light of Liberty you saw arise the light of Peace, like\r\n\r\n  \"another morn,\r\n   Risen on mid-noon\"; [7]\r\n\r\nand the sky on which you closed your eyes was cloudless.\r\n\r\nBut ah! Him! the first great martyr in this great cause! Him! the\r\npremature victim of his own self-devoting heart! Him! the head of our\r\ncivil councils, and the destined leader of our military bands, whom\r\nnothing brought hither but the unquenchable fire of his own spirit!\r\nHim! cut off by Providence in the hour of overwhelming anxiety and\r\nthick gloom; falling ere he saw the star of his country rise; pouring\r\nout his generous blood like water, before he knew whether it would\r\nfertilize a land of freedom or of bondage!--how shall I struggle with\r\nthe emotions that stifle the utterance of thy name! Our poor work may\r\nperish; but thine shall endure! [8]\r\n\r\nThis monument may moulder away; the solid ground it rests upon may sink\r\ndown to a level with the sea; but thy memory shall not fail!\r\nWheresoever among men a heart shall be found that beats to the\r\ntransports of patriotism and liberty, its aspirations shall be to claim\r\nkindred with thy spirit!\r\n\r\nBut the scene amidst which we stand does not permit us to confine our\r\nthoughts or our sympathies to those fearless spirits who hazarded or\r\nlost their lives on this consecrated spot. We have the happiness to\r\nrejoice here in the presence of a most worthy representation of the\r\nsurvivors of the whole Revolutionary army.\r\n\r\nVeterans! you are the remnant of many a well-fought field. You bring\r\nwith you marks of honor from Trenton and Monmouth, from Yorktown,\r\nCamden, Bennington, and Saratoga. VETERANS OF HALF A CENTURY! when in\r\nyour youthful days you put everything at hazard in your country's\r\ncause, good as that cause was, and sanguine as youth is, still your\r\nfondest hopes did not stretch onward to an hour like this! At a period\r\nto which you could not reasonably have expected to arrive, at a moment\r\nof national prosperity such as you could never have foreseen, you are\r\nnow met here to enjoy the fellowship of old soldiers, and to receive\r\nthe overflowings of a universal gratitude.\r\n\r\nBut your agitated countenances and your heaving breasts inform me that\r\neven this is not an unmixed joy. I perceive that a tumult of contending\r\nfeeling rushes upon you. The images of the dead, as well as the persons\r\nof the living, present themselves before you. The scene overwhelms you\r\nand I turn from it. May the Father of all mercies smile upon your\r\ndeclining years, and bless them! And when you shall here have exchanged\r\nyour embraces, when you shall once more have pressed the hands which\r\nhave been so often extended to give succor in adversity, or grasped in\r\nthe exultation of victory, then look abroad upon this lovely land which\r\nyour young valor defended, and mark the happiness with which it is\r\nfilled; yea, look abroad upon the whole earth, and see what a name you\r\nhave contributed to give to your country, and what a praise you have\r\nadded to freedom, and then rejoice in the sympathy and gratitude which\r\nbeam upon your last days from the improved condition of mankind!\r\n\r\nThe occasion does not require of me any particular account of the\r\nbattle of the 17th of June, 1775, nor any detailed narrative of the\r\nevents which immediately preceded it. These are familiarly known to\r\nall. In the progress of the great and interesting controversy,\r\nMassachusetts and the town of Boston had become early and marked\r\nobjects of the displeasure of the British Parliament. This had been\r\nmanifested in the act for altering the government of the Province, and\r\nin that for shutting up the port of Boston. Nothing sheds more honor on\r\nour early history, and nothing better shows how little the feelings and\r\nsentiments of the Colonies were known or regarded in England, than the\r\nimpression which these measures everywhere produced in America. [9] It\r\nhad been anticipated, that, while the Colonies in general would be\r\nterrified by the severity of the punishment inflicted on Massachusetts,\r\nthe other seaports would be governed by a mere spirit of gain; and\r\nthat, as Boston was now cut off from all commerce, the unexpected\r\nadvantage which this blow on her was calculated to confer on other\r\ntowns would be greedily enjoyed. How miserably such reasoners deceived\r\nthemselves! How little they knew of the depth, and the strength, and\r\nthe intenseness of that feeling of resistance to illegal acts of power,\r\nwhich possessed the whole American people! Everywhere the unworthy boon\r\nwas rejected with scorn. The fortunate occasion was seized everywhere,\r\nto show to the whole world that the Colonies were swayed by no local\r\ninterest, no partial interest, no selfish interest. The temptation to\r\nprofit by the punishment of Boston was strongest to our neighbors of\r\nSalem. Yet Salem was precisely the place where this miserable proffer\r\nwas spurned, in a tone of the most lofty self-respect and the most\r\nindignant patriotism. \"We are deeply affected,\" said its inhabitants,\r\n\"with the sense of our public calamities; but the miseries that are now\r\nrapidly hastening on our brethren in the capital of the Province\r\ngreatly excite our commiseration. By shutting up the port of Boston,\r\nsome imagine that the course of trade might be turned hither and to our\r\nbenefit; but we must be dead to every idea of justice, lost to all\r\nfeelings of humanity, could we indulge a thought to seize on wealth and\r\nraise our fortunes on the ruin of our suffering neighbors.\" These noble\r\nsentiments were not confined to our immediate vicinity. In that day of\r\ngeneral affection and brotherhood, the blow given to Boston smote on\r\nevery patriotic heart from one end of the country to the other.\r\nVirginia and the Carolinas, as well as Connecticut and New Hampshire,\r\nfelt and proclaimed the cause to be their own. The Continental\r\nCongress, then holding its first session in Philadelphia, expressed its\r\nsympathy for the suffering inhabitants of Boston, and addresses were\r\nreceived from all quarters, assuring them that the cause was a common\r\none, and should be met by common efforts and common sacrifices. The\r\nCongress of Massachusetts responded to these assurances; and in an\r\naddress to the Congress at Philadelphia, bearing the official\r\nsignature, perhaps among the last, of the immortal Warren,\r\nnotwithstanding the severity of its suffering and the magnitude of the\r\ndangers which threatened it, it was declared, that this Colony \"is\r\nready, at all times, to spend and to be spent in the cause of America.\"\r\n\r\nBut the hour drew nigh which was to put professions to the proof, and\r\nto determine whether the authors of these mutual pledges were ready to\r\nseal them in blood. The tidings of Lexington and Concord had no sooner\r\nspread, than it was universally felt that the time was at last come for\r\naction. A spirit pervaded all ranks, not transient, not boisterous, but\r\ndeep, solemn, determined,\r\n\r\n  \"totamque infusa per artus\r\n   Mens agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet.\" [10]\r\n\r\nWar, on their own soil and at their own doors, was, indeed, a strange\r\nwork to the yeomanry of New England; but their consciences were\r\nconvinced of its necessity, their country called them to it, and they\r\ndid not withhold themselves from the perilous trial. The ordinary\r\noccupations of life were abandoned; the plough was staid in the\r\nunfinished furrow; wives gave up their husbands, and mothers gave up\r\ntheir sons, to the battles of a civil war. Death might come, in honor,\r\non the field; it might come, in disgrace, on the scaffold. For either\r\nand for both they were prepared. The sentiment of Quincy was full in\r\ntheir hearts. \"Blandishments,\" said that distinguished son of genius\r\nand patriotism, \"will not fascinate us, nor will threats of a halter\r\nintimidate; for, under God, we are determined that, wheresoever,\r\nwhensoever, or howsoever we shall be called to make our exit, we will\r\ndie free men.\"\r\n\r\nThe 17th of June saw the four New England Colonies standing here, side\r\nby side, to triumph or to fall together; and there was with them from\r\nthat moment to the end of the war, what I hope will remain with them\r\nforever: one cause, one country, one heart.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Bunker Hill was attended with the most important effects\r\nbeyond its immediate results as a military engagement. It created at\r\nonce a state of open, public war. There could now be no longer a\r\nquestion of proceeding against individuals, as guilty of treason or\r\nrebellion. That fearful crisis was past. The appeal lay to the sword,\r\nand the only question was, whether the spirit and the resources of the\r\npeople would hold out, till the object should be accomplished. Nor were\r\nits general consequences confined to our own country. The previous\r\nproceedings of the Colonies, their appeals, resolutions, and addresses,\r\nhad made their cause known to Europe. Without boasting, we may say,\r\nthat in no age or country has the public cause been maintained with\r\nmore force of argument, more power of illustration, or more of that\r\npersuasion which excited feeling and elevated principle can alone\r\nbestow, than the Revolutionary state papers exhibit. These papers will\r\nforever deserve to be studied, not only for the spirit which they\r\nbreathe, but for the ability with which they were written. [11]\r\n\r\nTo this able vindication of their cause, the Colonies had now added a\r\npractical and severe proof of their own true devotion to it, and given\r\nevidence also of the power which they could bring to its support. All\r\nnow saw, that if America fell, she would not fall without a struggle.\r\nMen felt sympathy and regard, as well as surprise, when they beheld\r\nthese infant states, remote, unknown, unaided, encounter the power of\r\nEngland, and, in the first considerable battle, leave more of their\r\nenemies dead on the field, in proportion to the number of combatants,\r\nthan had been recently known to fall in the wars of Europe.\r\n\r\nInformation of these events, circulating throughout the world, at\r\nlength reached the ears of one who now hears me.[12]\r\n\r\nHe has not forgotten the emotion which the fame of Bunker Hill, and the\r\nname of Warren, excited in his youthful breast.\r\n\r\nSir, we are assembled to commemorate the establishment of great public\r\nprinciples of liberty, and to do honor to the distinguished dead. The\r\noccasion is too severe for eulogy of the living. But, Sir, your\r\ninteresting relation to this country, the peculiar circumstances which\r\nsurround you and surround us, call on me to express the happiness which\r\nwe derive from your presence and aid in this solemn commemoration.\r\n\r\nFortunate, fortunate man! with what measure of devotion will you not\r\nthank God for the circumstances of your extraordinary life! You are\r\nconnected with both hemispheres and with two generations. Heaven saw\r\nfit to ordain, that the electric spark of liberty should be conducted,\r\nthrough you, from the New World to the Old; and we, who are now here to\r\nperform this duty of patriotism, have all of us long ago received it in\r\ncharge from our fathers to cherish your name and your virtues. You will\r\naccount it an instance of your good fortune, Sir, that you crossed the\r\nseas to visit us at a time which enables you to be present at this\r\nsolemnity. You now behold the field, the renown of which reached you in\r\nthe heart of France, and caused a thrill in your ardent bosom. You see\r\nthe lines of the little redoubt thrown up by the incredible diligence\r\nof Prescott; defended, to the last extremity, by his lion-hearted\r\nvalor; and within which the corner-stone of our monument has now taken\r\nits position. You see where Warren fell, and where Parker, Gardner,\r\nMcCleary, Moore, and other early patriots, fell with him. Those who\r\nsurvived that day, and whose lives have been prolonged to the present\r\nhour, are now around you. Some of them you have known in the trying\r\nscenes of the war. Behold! they now stretch forth their feeble arms to\r\nembrace you. Behold! they raise their trembling voices to invoke the\r\nblessing of God on you and yours forever!\r\n\r\nSir, you have assisted us in laying the foundation of this structure.\r\nYou have heard us rehearse, with our feeble commendation, the names of\r\ndeparted patriots. Monuments and eulogy belong to the dead. We give\r\nthem this day to Warren and his associates. On other occasions they\r\nhave been given to your more immediate companions in arms, to\r\nWashington, to Greene, to Gates, to Sullivan, and to Lincoln. We have\r\nbecome reluctant to grant these, our highest and last honors, further.\r\nWe would gladly hold them yet back from the little remnant of that\r\nimmortal band. _Serus in coelum redeas_. Illustrious as are your\r\nmerits, yet far, O very far distant be the day, when any inscription\r\nshall bear your name, or any tongue pronounce its eulogy!\r\n\r\nThe leading reflection to which this occasion seems to invite us,\r\nrespects the great changes which have happened in the fifty years since\r\nthe battle of Bunker Hill was fought. And it peculiarly marks the\r\ncharacter of the present age, that, in looking at these changes, and in\r\nestimating their effect on our condition, we are obliged to consider,\r\nnot what has been done in our own country only, but in others also. In\r\nthese interesting times, while nations are making separate and\r\nindividual advances in improvement, they make, too, a common progress;\r\nlike vessels on a common tide, propelled by the gales at different\r\nrates, according to their several structure and management, but all\r\nmoved forward by one mighty current, strong enough to bear onward\r\nwhatever does not sink beneath it.\r\n\r\nA chief distinction of the present day is a community of opinions and\r\nknowledge amongst men in different nations, existing in a degree\r\nheretofore unknown. Knowledge has, in our time, triumphed, and is\r\ntriumphing, over distance, over difference of languages, over diversity\r\nof habits, over prejudice, and over bigotry. The civilized and\r\nChristian world is fast learning the great lesson, that difference of\r\nnation does not imply necessary hostility, and that all contact need\r\nnot be war. The whole world is becoming a common field for intellect to\r\nact in. Energy of mind, genius, power, wheresoever it exists, may speak\r\nout in any tongue, and the _world_ will hear it. A great cord of\r\nsentiment and feeling runs through two continents, and vibrates over\r\nboth. Every breeze wafts intelligence from country to country; every\r\nwave rolls it; all give it forth, and all in turn receive it. There is\r\na vast commerce of ideas; there are marts and exchanges for\r\nintellectual discoveries, and a wonderful fellowship of those\r\nindividual intelligences which make up the mind and opinion of the age.\r\nMind is the great lever of all things; human thought is the process by\r\nwhich human ends are ultimately answered; and the diffusion of\r\nknowledge, so astonishing in the last half-century, has rendered\r\ninnumerable minds, variously gifted by nature, competent to be\r\ncompetitors or fellow-workers on the theatre of intellectual operation.\r\n\r\nFrom these causes important improvements have taken place in the\r\npersonal condition of individuals. Generally speaking, mankind are not\r\nonly better fed and better clothed, but they are able also to enjoy\r\nmore leisure; they possess more refinement and more self-respect. A\r\nsuperior tone of education, manners, and habits prevails. This remark,\r\nmost true in its application to our own country, is also partly true\r\nwhen applied elsewhere. It is proved by the vastly augmented\r\nconsumption of those articles of manufacture and of commerce which\r\ncontribute to the comforts and the decencies of life; an augmentation\r\nwhich has far outrun the progress of population. And while the\r\nunexampled and almost incredible use of machinery would seem to supply\r\nthe place of labor, labor still finds its occupation and its reward; so\r\nwisely has Providence adjusted men's wants and desires to their\r\ncondition and their capacity.\r\n\r\nAny adequate survey, however, of the progress made during the last\r\nhalf-century in the polite and the mechanic arts, in machinery and\r\nmanufactures, in commerce and agriculture, in letters and in science,\r\nwould require volumes. I must abstain wholly from these subjects, and\r\nturn for a moment to the contemplation of what has been done on the\r\ngreat question of politics and government. This is the master topic of\r\nthe age; and during the whole fifty years it has intensely occupied the\r\nthoughts of men. The nature of civil government, its ends and uses,\r\nhave been canvassed and investigated; ancient opinions attacked and\r\ndefended; new ideas recommended and resisted, by whatever power the\r\nmind of man could bring to the controversy. From the closet and the\r\npublic halls the debate has been transferred to the field; and the\r\nworld has been shaken by wars of unexampled magnitude, and the greatest\r\nvariety of fortune. A day of peace has at length succeeded; and now\r\nthat the strife has subsided, and the smoke cleared away, we may begin\r\nto see what has actually been done, permanently changing the state and\r\ncondition of human society. And, without dwelling on particular\r\ncircumstances, it is most apparent, that, from the before-mentioned\r\ncauses of augmented knowledge and improved individual condition, a\r\nreal, substantial, and important change has taken place, and is taking\r\nplace, highly favorable, on the whole, to human liberty and human\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nThe great wheel of political revolution began to move in America. Here\r\nits rotation was guarded, regular, and safe. Transferred to the other\r\ncontinent, from unfortunate but natural causes, it received an\r\nirregular and violent impulse; it whirled along with a fearful\r\ncelerity; till at length, like the chariot-wheels in the races of\r\nantiquity, it took fire from the rapidity of its own motion, and blazed\r\nonward, spreading conflagration and terror around.\r\n\r\nWe learn from the result of this experiment, how fortunate was our own\r\ncondition, and how admirably the character of our people was calculated\r\nfor setting the great example of popular governments. The possession of\r\npower did not turn the heads of the American people, for they had long\r\nbeen in the habit of exercising a great degree of self-control.\r\nAlthough the paramount authority of the parent state existed over them,\r\nyet a large field of legislation had always been open to our Colonial\r\nassemblies. They were accustomed to representative bodies and the forms\r\nof free government; they understood the doctrine of the division of\r\npower among different branches, and the necessity of checks on each.\r\nThe character of our countrymen, moreover, was sober, moral, and\r\nreligious; and there was little in the change to shock their feelings\r\nof justice and humanity, or even to disturb an honest prejudice. We had\r\nno domestic throne to overturn, no privileged orders to cast down, no\r\nviolent changes of property to encounter. In the American Revolution,\r\nno man sought or wished for more than to defend and enjoy his own. None\r\nhoped for plunder or for spoil. Rapacity was unknown to it; the axe was\r\nnot among the instruments of its accomplishment; and we all know that\r\nit could not have lived a single day under any well-founded imputation\r\nof possessing a tendency adverse to the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nIt need not surprise us, that, under circumstances less auspicious,\r\npolitical revolutions elsewhere, even when well intended, have\r\nterminated differently. It is, indeed, a great achievement, it is the\r\nmaster-work of the world, to establish governments entirely popular on\r\nlasting foundations; nor is it easy, indeed, to introduce the popular\r\nprinciple at all into governments to which it has been altogether a\r\nstranger. It cannot be doubted, however, that Europe has come out of\r\nthe contest, in which she has been so long engaged, with greatly\r\nsuperior knowledge, and, in many respects, in a highly improved\r\ncondition. Whatever benefit has been acquired is likely to be retained,\r\nfor it consists mainly in the acquisition of more enlightened ideas.\r\nAnd although kingdoms and provinces may be wrested from the hands that\r\nhold them, in the same manner they were obtained; although ordinary and\r\nvulgar power may, in human affairs, be lost as it has been won; yet it\r\nis the glorious prerogative of the empire of knowledge, that what it\r\ngains it never loses. On the contrary, it increases by the multiple of\r\nits own power; all its ends become means; all its attainments, helps to\r\nnew conquests. Its whole abundant harvest is but so much seed wheat,\r\nand nothing has limited, and nothing can limit, the amount of ultimate\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of this rapidly increasing knowledge, the people\r\nhave begun, in forms of government, to think and to reason, on affairs\r\nof state. Regarding government as an institution for the public good,\r\nthey demand a knowledge of its operations, and a participation in its\r\nexercise. A call for the representative system, wherever it is not\r\nenjoyed, and where there is already intelligence enough to estimate its\r\nvalue, is perseveringly made. Where men may speak out, they demand it;\r\nwhere the bayonet is at their throats, they pray for it.\r\n\r\nWhen Louis the Fourteenth said: \"I am the state,\" he expressed the\r\nessence of the doctrine of unlimited power. By the rules of that\r\nsystem, the people are disconnected from the state; they are its\r\nsubjects; it is their lord. These ideas, founded in the love of power,\r\nand long supported by the excess and the abuse of it, are yielding, in\r\nour age, to other opinions; and the civilized world seems at last to be\r\nproceeding to the conviction of that fundamental and manifest truth,\r\nthat the powers of government are but a trust, and that they cannot be\r\nlawfully exercised but for the good of the community. As knowledge is\r\nmore and more extended, this conviction becomes more and more general.\r\nKnowledge, in truth, is the great sun in the firmament. Life and power\r\nare scattered with all its beams. The prayer of the Grecian champion,\r\nwhen enveloped in unnatural clouds and darkness, is the appropriate\r\npolitical supplication for the people of every country not yet blessed\r\nwith free institutions:--\r\n\r\n  \"Dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore,\r\n   Give me TO SEE,--and Ajax asks no more.\" [13]\r\n\r\nWe may hope that the glowing influence of enlightened sentiment will\r\npromote the permanent peace of the world. Wars to maintain family\r\nalliances, to uphold or to cast down dynasties, and to regulate\r\nsuccessions to thrones, which have occupied so much room in the history\r\nof modern times, if not less likely to happen at all, will be less\r\nlikely to become general and involve many nations, as the great\r\nprinciple shall be more and more established, that the interest of the\r\nworld is peace, and its first great statute, that every nation\r\npossesses the power of establishing a government for itself. But public\r\nopinion has attained also an influence over governments which do not\r\nadmit the popular principle into their organization. A necessary\r\nrespect for the judgment of the world operates, in some measure, as a\r\ncontrol over the most unlimited forms of authority. It is owing,\r\nperhaps, to this truth, that the interesting struggle of the Greeks has\r\nbeen suffered to go on so long, without a direct interference, either\r\nto wrest that country from its present masters, or to execute the\r\nsystem of pacification by force, and, with united strength, lay the\r\nneck of Christian and civilized Greek at the foot of the barbarian\r\nTurk. [14] Let us thank God that we live in an age when something has\r\ninfluence besides the bayonet, and when the sternest authority does not\r\nventure to encounter the scorching power of public reproach. Any\r\nattempt of the kind I have mentioned should be met by one universal\r\nburst of indignation; the air of the civilized world ought to be made\r\ntoo warm to be comfortably breathed by any one who would hazard it.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, a touching reflection, that, while, in the fulness of\r\nour country's happiness, we rear this monument to her honor, we look\r\nfor instruction in our undertaking to a country which is now in fearful\r\ncontest, not for works of art or memorials of glory, but for her own\r\nexistence. Let her be assured that she is not forgotten in the world;\r\nthat her efforts are applauded, and that constant prayers ascend for\r\nher success. And let us cherish a confident hope for her final triumph.\r\nIf the true spark of religious and civil liberty be kindled, it will\r\nburn. Human agency cannot extinguish it. Like the earth's central fire,\r\nit may be smothered for a time; the ocean may overwhelm it; mountains\r\nmay press it down; but its inherent and unconquerable force will heave\r\nboth the ocean and the land, and at some time or other, in some place\r\nor other, the volcano will break out and flame up to heaven.\r\n\r\nAmong the great events of the half-century, we must reckon, certainly,\r\nthe revolution of South America; and we are not likely to overrate the\r\nimportance of that revolution, either to the people of the country\r\nitself or to the rest of the world. The late Spanish colonies, now\r\nindependent states, under circumstances less favorable, doubtless, than\r\nattended our own revolution, have yet successfully commenced their\r\nnational existence. They have accomplished the great object of\r\nestablishing their independence; they are known and acknowledged in the\r\nworld; and although in regard to their systems of government, their\r\nsentiments on religious toleration, and their provisions for public\r\ninstruction, they may have yet much to learn, it must be admitted that\r\nthey have risen to the condition of settled and established states more\r\nrapidly than could have been reasonably anticipated. They already\r\nfurnish an exhilarating example of the difference between free\r\ngovernments and despotic misrule. Their commerce, at this moment,\r\ncreates a new activity in all the great marts of the world. They show\r\nthemselves able, by an exchange of commodities, to bear a useful part\r\nin the intercourse of nations.\r\n\r\nA new spirit of enterprise and industry begins to prevail; all the\r\ngreat interests of society receive a salutary impulse; and the progress\r\nof information not only testifies to an improved condition, but itself\r\nconstitutes the highest and most essential improvement.\r\n\r\nWhen the Battle of Bunker Hill was fought, the existence of South\r\nAmerica was scarcely felt in the civilized world. The thirteen little\r\nColonies of North America habitually called themselves the \"Continent.\"\r\nBorne down by colonial subjugation, monopoly, and bigotry, these vast\r\nregions of the South were hardly visible above the horizon. But in our\r\nday there has been, as it were, a new creation. The southern hemisphere\r\nemerges from the sea. Its lofty mountains begin to lift themselves into\r\nthe light of heaven; its broad and fertile plains stretch out, in\r\nbeauty, to the eye of civilized man, and at the mighty bidding of the\r\nvoice of political liberty the waters of darkness retire.\r\n\r\nAnd now, let us indulge an honest exultation in the conviction of the\r\nbenefit which the example of our country has produced, and is likely to\r\nproduce, on human freedom and human happiness. Let us endeavor to\r\ncomprehend in all its magnitude, and to feel in all its importance, the\r\npart assigned to us in the great drama of human affairs. We are placed\r\nat the head of the system of representative and popular governments.\r\nThus far our example shows that such governments are compatible, not\r\nonly with respectability and power, but with repose, with peace, with\r\nsecurity of personal rights, with good laws, and a just administration.\r\n\r\nWe are not propagandists. Wherever other systems are preferred, either\r\nas being thought better in themselves, or as better suited to existing\r\ncondition, we leave the preference to be enjoyed. Our history hitherto\r\nproves, however, that the popular form is practicable, and that with\r\nwisdom and knowledge men may govern themselves; and the duty incumbent\r\non us is, to preserve the consistency of this cheering example, and\r\ntake care that nothing may weaken its authority with the world. If, in\r\nour case, the representative system ultimately fail, popular\r\ngovernments must be pronounced impossible. No combination of\r\ncircumstances more favorable to the experiment can ever be expected to\r\noccur. The last hopes of mankind, therefore, rest with us; and if it\r\nshould be proclaimed, that our example had become an argument against\r\nthe experiment, the knell of popular liberty would be sounded\r\nthroughout the earth.\r\n\r\nThese are excitements to duty; but they are not suggestions of doubt.\r\nOur history and our condition, all that is gone before us, and all that\r\nsurrounds us, authorize the belief, that popular governments, though\r\nsubject to occasional variations, in form perhaps not always for the\r\nbetter, may yet, in their general character, be as durable and\r\npermanent as other systems. We know, indeed, that in our country any\r\nother is impossible. The _principle_ of free governments adheres to the\r\nAmerican soil. It is bedded in it, immovable as its mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd let the sacred obligations which have devolved on this generation,\r\nand on us, sink deep into our hearts. Those who established our liberty\r\nand our government are daily dropping from among us. The great trust\r\nnow descends to new hands. Let us apply ourselves to that which is\r\npresented to us, as our appropriate object. We can win no laurels in a\r\nwar for independence. Earlier and worthier hands have gathered them\r\nall. Nor are there places for us by the side of Solon, and Alfred, and\r\nother founders of states. Our fathers have filled them. But there\r\nremains to us a great duty of defence and preservation; and there is\r\nopened to us, also, a noble pursuit, to which the spirit of the times\r\nstrongly invites us. Our proper business is improvement. Let our age be\r\nthe age of improvement. In a day of peace, let us advance the arts of\r\npeace and the works of peace. Let us develop the resources of our land,\r\ncall forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great\r\ninterests, and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not\r\nperform something worthy to be remembered. Let us cultivate a true\r\nspirit of union and harmony. In pursuing the great objects which our\r\ncondition points out to us, let us act under a settled conviction, and\r\nan habitual feeling, that these twenty-four States are one country. Let\r\nour conceptions be enlarged to the circle of our duties. Let us extend\r\nour ideas over the whole of the vast field in which we are called to\r\nact. Let our object be, OUR COUNTRY, OUR WHOLE COUNTRY, AND NOTHING BUT\r\nOUR COUNTRY. And, by the blessing of God, may that country itself\r\nbecome a vast and splendid monument, not of oppression and terror, but\r\nof Wisdom, of Peace, and of Liberty, upon which the world may gaze with\r\nadmiration forever!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reply to Hayne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President,--When the mariner has been tossed for many days in thick\r\nweather, and on an unknown sea, he naturally avails himself of the\r\nfirst pause in the storm, the earliest glance of the sun, to take his\r\nlatitude, and ascertain how far the elements have driven him from his\r\ntrue course. Let us imitate this prudence, and, before we float farther\r\non the waves of this debate, refer to the point from which we departed,\r\nthat we may at least be able to conjecture where we now are. I ask for\r\nthe reading of the resolution before the Senate. [1]\r\n\r\nThe Secretary read the resolution, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Committee on Public Lands be instructed to inquire\r\nand report the quantity of public lands remaining unsold within each\r\nState and Territory, and whether it be expedient to limit for a certain\r\nperiod the sales of the public lands to such lands only as have\r\nheretofore been offered for sale, and are now subject to entry at the\r\nminimum price. And, also, whether the office of Surveyor-General, and\r\nsome of the land offices, may not be abolished without detriment to the\r\npublic interest; or whether it be expedient to adopt measures to hasten\r\nthe sales and extend more rapidly the surveys of the public lands.\"\r\n\r\nWe have thus heard, Sir, what the resolution is which is actually\r\nbefore us for consideration; and it will readily occur to every one,\r\nthat it is almost the only subject about which something has not been\r\nsaid in the speech, running through two days, by which the Senate has\r\nbeen entertained by the gentleman from South Carolina. Every topic in\r\nthe wide range of our public affairs, whether past or present,--every\r\nthing, general or local, whether belonging to national politics or\r\nparty politics,--seems to have attracted more or less of the honorable\r\nmember's attention, save only the resolution before the Senate. He has\r\nspoken of every thing but the public lands; they have escaped his\r\nnotice. To that subject, in all his excursions, he has not paid even\r\nthe cold respect of a passing glance.\r\n\r\nWhen this debate, Sir, was to be resumed, on Thursday morning, it so\r\nhappened that it would have been convenient for me to be elsewhere. The\r\nhonorable member, however, did not incline to put off the discussion to\r\nanother day. He had a shot, he said, to return, and he wished to\r\ndischarge it. That shot, Sir, which he thus kindly informed us was\r\ncoming, that we might stand out of the way, or prepare ourselves to\r\nfall by it and die with decency, has now been received. Under all\r\nadvantages, and with expectation awakened by the tone which preceded\r\nit, it has been discharged, and has spent its force. It may become me\r\nto say no more of its effect, than that, if nobody is found, after all,\r\neither killed or wounded, it is not the first time, in the history of\r\nhuman affairs, that the vigor and success of the war have not quite\r\ncome up to the lofty and sounding phrase of the manifesto. [2]\r\n\r\nThe gentleman, Sir, in declining to postpone the debate, told the\r\nSenate, with the emphasis of his hand upon his heart, that there was\r\nsomething rankling _here_, which he wished to relieve. [Mr. Hayne rose,\r\nand disclaimed having used the word _rankling_.] It would not, Mr.\r\nPresident, be safe for the honorable member to appeal to those around\r\nhim, upon the question whether he did in fact make use of that word.\r\nBut he may have been unconscious of it. At any rate, it is enough that\r\nhe disclaims it. But still, with or without the use of that particular\r\nword, he had yet something _here_, he said, of which he wished to rid\r\nhimself by an immediate reply. In this respect, Sir, I have a great\r\nadvantage over the honorable gentleman. There is nothing _here_, Sir,\r\nwhich gives me the slightest uneasiness; neither fear, nor anger, nor\r\nthat which is sometimes more troublesome than either, the consciousness\r\nof having been in the wrong. There is nothing, either originating\r\n_here_, or now received _here_ by the gentleman's shot. Nothing\r\noriginating here, for I had not the slightest feeling of unkindness\r\ntowards the honorable member. Some passages, it is true, had occurred\r\nsince our acquaintance in this body, which I could have wished might\r\nhave been otherwise; but I had used philosophy and forgotten them. I\r\npaid the honorable member the attention of listening with respect to\r\nhis first speech; and when he sat down, though surprised, and I must\r\neven say astonished, at some of his opinions, nothing was farther from\r\nmy intention than to commence any personal warfare. Through the whole\r\nof the few remarks I made in answer, I avoided, studiously and\r\ncarefully, every thing which I thought possible to be construed into\r\ndisrespect. And, Sir, while there is thus nothing originating _here_\r\nwhich I have wished at any time, or now wish, to discharge, I must\r\nrepeat, also, that nothing has been received _here_ which _rankles_, or\r\nin any way gives me annoyance. I will not accuse the honorable member\r\nof violating the rules of civilized war; I will not say, that he\r\npoisoned his arrows. But whether his shafts were, or were not, dipped\r\nin that which would have caused rankling if they had reached their\r\ndestination, there was not, as it happened, quite strength enough in\r\nthe bow to bring them to their mark. If he wishes now to gather up\r\nthose shafts, he must look for them elsewhere; they will not be found\r\nfixed and quivering in the object at which they were aimed. [3]\r\n\r\nThe honorable member complained that I had slept on his speech. I must\r\nhave slept on it, or not slept at all. The moment the honorable member\r\nsat down, his friend from Missouri rose, [4] and, with much honeyed\r\ncommendation of the speech, suggested that the impressions which it had\r\nproduced were too charming and delightful to be disturbed by other\r\nsentiments or other sounds, and proposed that the Senate should\r\nadjourn. Would it have been quite amiable in me, Sir, to interrupt this\r\nexcellent good feeling? Must I not have been absolutely malicious, is;\r\nI could have thrust myself forward, to destroy sensations thus\r\npleasing? Was it not much better and kinder, both to sleep upon them\r\nmyself, and to allow others also the pleasure of sleeping upon them?\r\nBut if it be meant, by sleeping upon his speech, that I took time to\r\nprepare a reply to it, it is quite a mistake. Owing to other\r\nengagements, I could not employ even the interval between the\r\nadjournment of the Senate and its meeting the next morning, in\r\nattention to the subject of this debate. [5] Nevertheless, Sir, the\r\nmere matter of fact is undoubtedly true. I did sleep on the gentleman's\r\nspeech, and slept soundly. And I slept equally well on his speech of\r\nyesterday, to which I am now replying. It is quite possible that in\r\nthis respect, also, I possess some advantage over the honorable member,\r\nattributable, doubtless, to a cooler temperament on my part; for, in\r\ntruth, I slept upon his speeches remarkably well.\r\n\r\nBut the gentleman inquires why _he_ was made the object of such a\r\nreply. Why was _he_ singled out? If an attack has been made on the\r\nEast, he, he assures us, did not begin it; it was made by the gentleman\r\nfrom Missouri. Sir, I answered the gentleman's speech because I\r\nhappened to hear it; and because, also, I chose to give an answer to\r\nthat speech, which, if unanswered, I thought most likely to produce\r\ninjurious impressions. I did not stop to inquire who was the original\r\ndrawer of the bill. I found a responsible indorser before me, and it\r\nwas my purpose to hold him liable, and to bring him to his just\r\nresponsibility, without delay. But, Sir, this interrogatory of the\r\nhonorable member was only introductory to another. He proceeded to ask\r\nme whether I had turned upon him, in this debate, from the\r\nconsciousness that I should find an overmatch, if I ventured on a\r\ncontest with his friend from Missouri. If, Sir, the honorable member,\r\n_modestiae gratia_, had chosen thus to defer to his friend, and to pay\r\nhim a compliment, without intentional disparagement to others, it would\r\nhave been quite according to the friendly courtesies of debate, and not\r\nat all ungrateful to my own feelings. I am not one of those, Sir, who\r\nesteem any tribute of regard, whether light and occasional, or more\r\nserious and deliberate, which may be bestowed on others, as so much\r\nunjustly withholden from themselves. But the tone and manner of the\r\ngentleman's question forbid me thus to interpret it. I am not at\r\nliberty to consider it as nothing more than a civility to his friend.\r\nIt had an air of taunt and disparagement, something of the loftiness of\r\nasserted superiority, which does not allow me to pass it over without\r\nnotice. It was put as a question for me to answer, and so put as if it\r\nwere difficult for me to answer, whether I deemed the member from\r\nMissouri an overmatch for myself in debate here. It seems to me, Sir,\r\nthat this is extraordinary language, and an extraordinary tone, for the\r\ndiscussions of this body.\r\n\r\nMatches and overmatches! Those terms are more applicable elsewhere than\r\nhere, and fitter for other assemblies than this. Sir, the gentleman\r\nseems to forget where and what we are. This is a Senate, a Senate of\r\nequals, of men of individual honor and personal character, and of\r\nabsolute independence. We know no masters, we acknowledge no dictators.\r\nThis is a hall for mutual consultation and discussion; not an arena for\r\nthe exhibition of champions. I offer myself, Sir, as a match for no\r\nman; I throw the challenge of debate at no man's feet. But then, Sir,\r\nsince the honorable member has put the question in a manner that calls\r\nfor an answer, I will give him an answer; and I tell him, that, holding\r\nmyself to be the humblest of the members here, I yet know nothing in\r\nthe arm of his friend from Missouri, either alone or when aided by the\r\narm of _his_ friend from South Carolina, that need deter even me from\r\nespousing whatever opinions I may choose to espouse, from debating\r\nwhenever I may choose to debate, or from speaking whatever I may see\r\nfit to say, on the floor of the Senate. Sir, when uttered as matter of\r\ncommendation or compliment, I should dissent from nothing which the\r\nhonorable member might say of his friend. Still less do I put forth any\r\npretensions of my own. But when put to me as matter of taunt, I throw\r\nit back, and say to the gentleman, that he could possibly say nothing\r\nless [6] likely than such a comparison to wound my pride of personal\r\ncharacter. The anger of its tone rescued the remark from intentional\r\nirony, which otherwise, probably, would have been its general\r\nacceptation. But, Sir, if it be imagined that by this mutual quotation\r\nand commendation; if it be supposed that, by casting the characters of\r\nthe drama, assigning to each his part, to one the attack, to another\r\nthe cry of onset; or if it be thought that, by a loud and empty vaunt\r\nof anticipated victory, any laurels are to be won here; if it be\r\nimagined, especially, that any or all these things will shake any\r\npurpose of mine,--I can tell the honorable member, once for all, that\r\nhe is greatly mistaken, and that he is dealing with one of whose temper\r\nand character he has yet much to learn. Sir, I shall not allow myself,\r\non this occasion, I hope on no occasion, to be betrayed into any loss\r\nof temper; but if provoked, as I trust I never shall be, into\r\ncrimination and recrimination, the honorable member may perhaps find,\r\nthat, in that contest, there will be blows to take as well as blows to\r\ngive; that others can state comparisons as significant, at least, as\r\nhis own, and that his impunity may possibly demand of him whatever\r\npowers of taunt and sarcasm he may possess. I commend him to a prudent\r\nhusbandry of his resources.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, the Coalition! [7] The Coalition! Ay, \"the murdered\r\nCoalition!\" The gentleman asks, if I were led or frighted into this\r\ndebate by the spectre of the Coalition. \"Was it the ghost of the\r\nmurdered Coalition,\" he exclaims, \"which haunted the member from\r\nMassachusetts; and which, like the ghost of Banquo, would never down?\"\r\n\r\n\"The murdered Coalition!\" Sir, this charge of a coalition, in reference\r\nto the late administration, is not original with the honorable member.\r\nIt did not spring up in the Senate. Whether as a fact, as an argument,\r\nor as an embellishment, it is all borrowed. He adopts it, indeed, from\r\na very low origin, and a still lower present condition. It is one of\r\nthe thousand calumnies with which the press teemed, during an excited\r\npolitical canvass. It was a charge, of which there was not only no\r\nproof or probability, but which was in itself wholly impossible to be\r\ntrue. No man of common information ever believed a syllable of it. Yet\r\nit was of that class of falsehoods, which, by continued repetition,\r\nthrough all the organs of detraction and abuse, are capable of\r\nmisleading those who are already far misled, and of further fanning\r\npassion already kindling into flame. Doubtless it served in its day,\r\nand in greater or less degree, the end designed by it. Having done\r\nthat, it has sunk into the general mass of stale and loathed calumnies.\r\nIt is the very cast-off slough of a polluted and shameless press.\r\nIncapable of further mischief, it lies in the sewer, lifeless and\r\ndespised. It is not now, Sir, in the power of the honorable member to\r\ngive it dignity or decency, by attempting to elevate it, and to\r\nintroduce it into the Senate. He cannot change it from what it is, an\r\nobject of general disgust and scorn. On the contrary, the contact, if\r\nhe choose to touch it, is more likely to drag him down, down, to the\r\nplace where it lies itself.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, the honorable member was not, for other reasons, entirely\r\nhappy in his allusion to the story of Banquo's murder and Banquo's\r\nghost. It was not, I think, the friends, but the enemies of the\r\nmurdered Banquo, at whose bidding his spirit would not _down_. The\r\nhonorable gentleman is fresh in his reading of the English classics,\r\nand can put me right if I am wrong; but, according to my poor\r\nrecollection, it was at those who had begun with caresses and ended\r\nwith foul and treacherous murder that the gory locks were shaken. The\r\nghost of Banquo, like that of Hamlet, was an honest ghost. It disturbed\r\nno innocent man. It knew where its appearance would strike terror, and\r\nwho would cry out, A ghost! It made itself visible in the right\r\nquarter, and compelled the guilty and the conscience-smitten, and none\r\nothers, to start, with,\r\n\r\n  \"Pr'ythee, see there! behold!--look! lo,\r\n   If I stand here, I saw him!\"\r\n\r\nTheir eyeballs were seared (was it not so, Sir?) who had thought to\r\nshield themselves by concealing their own hand, and laying the\r\nimputation of the crime on a low and hireling agency in wickedness; who\r\nhad vainly attempted to stifle the workings of their own coward\r\nconsciences by ejaculating through white lips and chattering teeth,\r\n\"Thou canst not say I did it!\" I have misread the great poet if those\r\nwho had no way partaken in the deed of the death, either found that\r\nthey were, or _feared that they should be_, pushed from their stools by\r\nthe ghost of the slain, or exclaimed to a spectre created by their own\r\nfears and their own remorse, \"Avaunt! and quit our sight!\"\r\n\r\nThere is another particular, Sir, in which the honorable member's quick\r\nperception of resemblances might, I should think, have seen something\r\nin the story of Banquo, making it not altogether a subject of the most\r\npleasant contemplation. Those who murdered Banquo, what did they win by\r\nit? Substantial good? Permanent power? Or disappointment, rather, and\r\nsore mortification,--dust and ashes, the common fate of vaulting\r\nambition overleaping itself? Did not even-handed justice erelong\r\ncommend the poisoned chalice to their own lips? Did they not soon find\r\nthat for another they had \"filed their mind\"? that their ambition,\r\nthough apparently for the moment successful, had but put a barren\r\nsceptre in their grasp? [8] Ay, Sir,\r\n\r\n  \"a barren sceptre in their gripe,\r\n   _Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,\r\n   No son of theirs succeeding_.\"\r\n\r\nSir, I need pursue the allusion no farther. I leave the honorable\r\ngentleman to run it out at his leisure, and to derive from it all the\r\ngratification it is calculated to administer. If he finds himself\r\npleased with the associations, and prepared to be quite satisfied,\r\nthough the parallel should be entirely completed, I had almost said, I\r\nam satisfied also; but that I shall think of. Yes, Sir, I will think of\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my observations the other day, Mr. President, I paid a\r\npassing tribute of respect to a very worthy man, Mr. Dane of\r\nMassachusetts. It so happened that he drew the Ordinance of 1787, for\r\nthe government of the Northwestern Territory. A man of so much ability,\r\nand so little pretence; of so great a capacity to do good, and so\r\nunmixed a disposition to do it for its own sake; a gentleman who had\r\nacted an important part, forty years ago, in a measure the influence of\r\nwhich is still deeply felt in the very matter which was the subject of\r\ndebate,--might, I thought, receive from me a commendatory recognition.\r\nBut the honorable member was inclined to be facetious on the subject.\r\nHe was rather disposed to make it matter of ridicule, that I had\r\nintroduced into the debate the name of one Nathan Dane, of whom he\r\nassures us he had never before heard. Sir, if the honorable member had\r\nnever before heard of Mr. Dane, I am sorry for it. It shows him less\r\nacquainted with the public men of the country than I had supposed. Let\r\nme tell him, however, that a sneer from him at the mention of the name\r\nof Mr. Dane is in bad taste. It may well be a high mark of ambition,\r\nSir, either with the honorable gentleman or myself, to accomplish as\r\nmuch to make our names known to advantage, and remembered with\r\ngratitude, as Mr. Dane has accomplished. But the truth is, Sir, I\r\nsuspect, that Mr. Dane lives a little too far north. He is of\r\nMassachusetts, and too near the north star to be reached by the\r\nhonorable gentleman's telescope. If his sphere had happened to range\r\nsouth of Mason and Dixon's line, he might, probably, have come within\r\nthe scope of his vision.\r\n\r\nI spoke, Sir, of the Ordinance of 1787, which prohibits slavery, in all\r\nfuture times, northwest of the Ohio, as a measure of great wisdom and\r\nforesight, and one which had been attended with highly beneficial and\r\npermanent consequences. I supposed that, on this point, no two\r\ngentlemen in the Senate could entertain different opinions. But the\r\nsimple expression of this sentiment has led the gentleman, not only\r\ninto a labored defence of slavery, in the abstract, and on principle,\r\nbut also into a warm accusation against me, as having attacked the\r\nsystem of domestic slavery now existing in the Southern States. For all\r\nthis, there was not the slightest foundation, in anything said or\r\nintimated by me. I did not utter a single word which any ingenuity\r\ncould torture into an attack on the slavery of the South. I said, only,\r\nthat it was highly wise and useful, in legislating for the Northwestern\r\ncountry while it was yet a wilderness, to prohibit the introduction of\r\nslaves; and I added, that I presumed there was no reflecting and\r\nintelligent person, in the neighboring State of Kentucky, who would\r\ndoubt that, if the same prohibition had been extended, at the same\r\nearly period, over that commonwealth, her strength and population\r\nwould, at this day, have been far greater than they are. If these\r\nopinions be thought doubtful, they are nevertheless, I trust, neither\r\nextraordinary nor disrespectful. They attack nobody and menace nobody.\r\nAnd yet, Sir, the gentleman's optics have discovered, even in the mere\r\nexpression of this sentiment, what he calls the very spirit of the\r\nMissouri question! [9] He represents me as making an onset on the whole\r\nSouth, and manifesting a spirit which would interfere with, and\r\ndisturb, their domestic condition!\r\n\r\nSir, this injustice no otherwise surprises me, than as it is committed\r\nhere, and committed without the slightest pretence of ground for it. I\r\nsay it only surprises me as being done here; for I know full well, that\r\nit is, and has been, the settled policy of some persons in the South,\r\nfor years, to represent the people of the North as disposed to\r\ninterfere with them in their own exclusive and peculiar concerns. This\r\nis a delicate and sensitive point in Southern feeling; and of late\r\nyears it has always been touched, and generally with effect, whenever\r\nthe object has been to unite the whole South against Northern men or\r\nNorthern measures. This feeling, always carefully kept alive, and\r\nmaintained at too intense a heat to admit discrimination or reflection,\r\nis a lever of great power in our political machine. It moves vast\r\nbodies, and gives to them one and the same direction. But it is without\r\nadequate cause, and the suspicion which exists is wholly groundless.\r\nThere is not, and never has been, a disposition in the North to\r\ninterfere with these interests of the South. Such interference has\r\nnever been supposed to be within the power of government; nor has it\r\nbeen in any way attempted. The slavery of the South has always been\r\nregarded as a matter of domestic policy, left with the States\r\nthemselves, and with which the Federal government had nothing to do.\r\nCertainly, Sir, I am, and ever have been, of that opinion. The\r\ngentleman, indeed, argues that slavery, in the abstract, is no evil.\r\nMost assuredly I need not say I differ with him, altogether and most\r\nwidely, on that point. I regard domestic slavery as one of the greatest\r\nevils, both moral and political. But whether it be a malady, and\r\nwhether it be curable, and if so, by what means; or, on the other hand,\r\nwhether it be the _vulnus immedicabile_ of the social system, I leave\r\nit to those whose right and duty it is to inquire and to decide. And\r\nthis I believe, Sir, is, and uniformly has been, the sentiment of the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nWhen it became necessary, or was thought so, by some political persons,\r\nto find an unvarying ground for the exclusion of Northern men from\r\nconfidence and from lead in the affairs of the republic, then, and not\r\ntill then, the cry was raised, and the feeling industriously excited,\r\nthat the influence of Northern men in the public counsels would\r\nendanger the relation of master and slave. For myself, I claim no other\r\nmerit than that this gross and enormous injustice towards the whole\r\nNorth has not wrought upon me to change my opinions or my political\r\nconduct. I hope I am above violating my principles, even under the\r\nsmart of injury and false imputations. Unjust suspicions and undeserved\r\nreproach, whatever pain I may experience from them, will not induce me,\r\nI trust, to overstep the limits of constitutional duty, or to encroach\r\non the rights of others. The domestic slavery of the Southern States I\r\nleave where I find it,--in the hands of their own governments. It is\r\ntheir affair, not mine. Nor do I complain of the peculiar effect which\r\nthe magnitude of that population has had in the distribution of power\r\nunder this Federal government. We know, Sir, that the representation of\r\nthe States in the other house is not equal. We know that great\r\nadvantage in that respect is enjoyed by the slave-holding States; and\r\nwe know, too, that the intended equivalent for that advantage, that is\r\nto say, the imposition of direct taxes in the same ratio, has become\r\nmerely nominal, the habit of the government being almost invariably to\r\ncollect its revenue from other sources and in other modes.\r\nNevertheless, I do not complain; nor would I countenance any movement\r\nto alter this arrangement of representation. It is the original\r\nbargain, the compact; let it stand; let the advantage of it be fully\r\nenjoyed. The Union itself is too full of benefit to be hazarded in\r\npropositions for changing its original basis. I go for the Constitution\r\nas it is, and for the Union as it is. But I am resolved not to submit\r\nin silence to accusations, either against myself individually or\r\nagainst the North, wholly unfounded and unjust,--accusations which\r\nimpute to us a disposition to evade the constitutional compact, and to\r\nextend the power of the government over the internal laws and domestic\r\ncondition of the States. All such accusations, wherever and whenever\r\nmade, all insinuations of the existence of any such purposes, I know\r\nand feel to be groundless and injurious. And we must confide in\r\nSouthern gentlemen themselves; we must trust to those whose integrity\r\nof heart and magnanimity of feeling will lead them to a desire to\r\nmaintain and disseminate truth, and who possess the means of its\r\ndiffusion with the Southern public; we must leave it to them to\r\ndisabuse that public of its prejudices. But in the mean time, for my\r\nown part, I shall continue to act justly, whether those towards whom\r\njustice is exercised receive it with candor or with contumely.\r\n\r\nHaving had occasion to recur to the Ordinance of 1787, in order to\r\ndefend myself against the inferences which the honorable member has\r\nchosen to draw from my former observations on that subject, I am not\r\nwilling now entirely to take leave of it without another remark. It\r\nneed hardly be said, that that paper expresses just sentiments on the\r\ngreat subject of civil and religious liberty. Such sentiments were\r\ncommon, and abound in all our state papers of that day. But this\r\nOrdinance did that which was not so common, and which is not even now\r\nuniversal; that is, it set forth and declared it to be a high and\r\nbinding duty of government itself to support schools and advance the\r\nmeans of education, on the plain reason that religion, morality, and\r\nknowledge are necessary to good government, and to the happiness of\r\nmankind. One observation further. The important provision incorporated\r\ninto the Constitution of the United States, and into several of those\r\nof the States, and recently, as we have seen, adopted into the reformed\r\nconstitution of Virginia, restraining legislative power in questions of\r\nprivate right, and from impairing the obligation of contracts, is first\r\nintroduced and established, as far as I am informed, as matter of\r\nexpress written constitutional law, in this Ordinance of 1787. And I\r\nmust add, also, in regard to the author of the Ordinance, who has not\r\nhad the happiness to attract the gentleman's notice heretofore, nor to\r\navoid his sarcasm now, that he was chairman of that select committee of\r\nthe old Congress, whose report first expressed the strong sense of that\r\nbody, that the old Confederation was not adequate to the exigencies of\r\nthe country, and recommended to the States to send delegates to the\r\nconvention which formed the present Constitution.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made to transfer from the North to the South the\r\nhonor of this exclusion of slavery from the Northwestern Territory. The\r\njournal, without argument or comment, refutes such attempts. The\r\ncession by Virginia was made in March, 1784. On the 19th of April\r\nfollowing, a committee, consisting of Messrs. Jefferson, Chase, and\r\nHowell, reported a plan for a temporary government of the territory, in\r\nwhich was this article: \"That, after the year 1800, there shall be\r\nneither slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of the said States,\r\notherwise than in punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have\r\nbeen convicted.\" Mr. Spaight of North Carolina moved to strike out this\r\nparagraph. The question was put, according to the form then practised,\r\n\"Shall these words stand as a part of the plan?\" New Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and\r\nPennsylvania, seven States, voted in the affirmative; Maryland,\r\nVirginia, and South Carolina, in the negative. North Carolina was\r\ndivided. As the consent of nine States was necessary, the words could\r\nnot stand, and were struck out accordingly. Mr. Jefferson voted for the\r\nclause, but was overruled by his colleagues.\r\n\r\nIn March of the next year (1785), Mr. King of Massachusetts, seconded\r\nby Mr. Ellery of Rhode Island, proposed the formerly rejected article,\r\nwith this addition: \"And that this regulation shall be an article of\r\ncompact, and remain a fundamental principle of the constitutions\r\nbetween the thirteen original States, and each of the States described\r\nin the resolve.\" On this clause, which provided the adequate and\r\nthorough security, the eight Northern States at that time voted\r\naffirmatively, and the four Southern States negatively. The votes of\r\nnine States were not yet obtained, and thus the provision was again\r\nrejected by the Southern States. The perseverance of the North held\r\nout, and two years afterwards the object was attained. It is no\r\nderogation from the credit, whatever that may be, of drawing the\r\nOrdinance, that its principles had before been prepared and discussed,\r\nin the form of resolutions. If one should reason in that way, what\r\nwould become of the distinguished honor of the author of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence? There is not a sentiment in that paper\r\nwhich had not been voted and resolved in the assemblies, and other\r\npopular bodies in the country, over and over again.\r\n\r\nBut the honorable member has now found out that this gentleman, Mr.\r\nDane, was a member of the Hartford Convention. [10] However uninformed\r\nthe honorable member may be of characters and occurrences at the North,\r\nit would seem that he has at his elbow, on this occasion, some\r\nhighminded and lofty spirit, some magnanimous and true-hearted monitor,\r\npossessing the means of local knowledge, and ready to supply the\r\nhonorable member with every thing, down even to forgotten and\r\nmoth-eaten two-penny pamphlets, which may be used to the disadvantage\r\nof his own country. But as to the Hartford Convention, Sir, allow me to\r\nsay, that the proceedings of that body seem now to be less read and\r\nstudied in New England than farther South. They appear to be looked to,\r\nnot in New England, but elsewhere, for the purpose of seeing how far\r\nthey may serve as a precedent. But they will not answer the purpose,\r\nthey are quite too tame. The latitude in which they originated was too\r\ncold. Other conventions, of more recent existence, have gone a whole\r\nbar's length beyond it. The learned doctors of Colleton and Abbeville\r\nhave pushed their commentaries on the Hartford collect so far, that the\r\noriginal text-writers are thrown entirely into the shade. I have\r\nnothing to do, Sir, with the Hartford Convention. Its journal, which\r\nthe gentleman has quoted, I never read. So far as the honorable member\r\nmay discover in its proceedings a spirit in any degree resembling that\r\nwhich was avowed and justified in those other conventions to which I\r\nhave alluded, or so far as those proceedings can be shown to be\r\ndisloyal to the Constitution, or tending to disunion, as far I shall be\r\nas ready as any one to bestow on them reprehension and censure.\r\n\r\nHaving dwelt long on this convention, and other occurrences of that\r\nday, in the hope, probably, (which will not be gratified), that I\r\nshould leave the course of this debate to follow him at length in those\r\nexcursions, the honorable member returned, and attempted another\r\nobject. He referred to a speech of mine in the other house, the same\r\nwhich I had occasion to allude to myself, the other day; and has quoted\r\na passage or two from it, with a bold, though uneasy and laboring, air\r\nof confidence, as if he had detected in me an inconsistency. Judging\r\nfrom the gentleman's manner, a stranger to the course of the debate and\r\nto the point in discussion would have imagined, from so triumphant a\r\ntone, that the honorable member was about to overwhelm me with a\r\nmanifest contradiction. Any one who heard him, and who had not heard\r\nwhat I had, in fact, previously said, must have thought me routed and\r\ndiscomfited, as the gentleman had promised. Sir, a breath blows all\r\nthis triumph away. There is not the slightest difference in the purport\r\nof my remarks on the two occasions. What I said here on Wednesday is in\r\nexact accordance with the opinion expressed by me in the other house in\r\n1825. Though the gentleman had the metaphysics of Hudibras, though he\r\nwere able\r\n\r\n    \"to sever and divide\r\n     A hair 'twixt north and northwest side,\"\r\n\r\nhe could yet not insert his metaphysical scissors between the fair\r\nreading of my remarks in 1825, and what I said here last week. There is\r\nnot only no contradiction, no difference, but, in truth, too exact a\r\nsimilarity, both in thought and language, to be entirely in just taste.\r\nI had myself quoted the same speech; had recurred to it, and spoke with\r\nit open before me; and much of what I said was little more than a\r\nrepetition from it.\r\n\r\nI need not repeat at large the general topics of the honorable\r\ngentleman's speech. When he said yesterday that he did not attack the\r\nEastern States, he certainly must have forgotten, not only particular\r\nremarks, but the whole drift and tenor of his speech; unless he means\r\nby not attacking, that he did not commence hostilities, but that\r\nanother had preceded him in the attack. He, in the first place,\r\ndisapproved of the whole course of the government, for forty years, in\r\nregard to its disposition of the public lands; and then, turning\r\nnorthward and eastward, and fancying he had found a cause for alleged\r\nnarrowness and niggardliness in the \"accursed policy\" of the tariff, to\r\nwhich he represented the people of New England as wedded, he went on\r\nfor a full hour with remarks, the whole scope of which was to exhibit\r\nthe results of this policy, in feelings and in measures unfavorable to\r\nthe West. I thought his opinions unfounded and erroneous, as to the\r\ngeneral course of the government, and ventured to reply to them.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman had remarked on the analogy of other cases, and quoted\r\nthe conduct of European governments towards their own subjects settling\r\non this continent, as in point, to show that we had been harsh and\r\nrigid in selling, when we should have given the public lands to\r\nsettlers without price. I thought the honorable member had suffered his\r\njudgment to be betrayed by a false analogy; that he was struck with an\r\nappearance of resemblance where there was no real similitude. I think\r\nso still. The first settlers of North America were enterprising\r\nspirits, engaged in private adventure, or fleeing from tyranny at home.\r\nWhen arrived here, they were forgotten by the mother country, or\r\nremembered only to be oppressed. Carried away again by the appearance\r\nof anology, or struck with the eloquence of the passage, the honorable\r\nmember yesterday observed, that the conduct of government towards the\r\nWestern emigrants, or my representation of it, brought to his mind a\r\ncelebrated speech in the British Parliament. It was, Sir, the speech of\r\nColonel Barre. On the question of the stamp act, or tea tax, I forget\r\nwhich, Colonel Barre had heard a member on the treasury bench argue,\r\nthat the people of the United States, being British colonists, planted\r\nby the maternal care, nourished by the indulgence, and protected by the\r\narms of England, would not grudge their mite to relieve the mother\r\ncountry from the heavy burden under which she groaned. The language of\r\nColonel Barre, in reply to this, was: \"They planted by your care? Your\r\noppression planted them in America. They fled from your tyranny, and\r\ngrew by your neglect of them. So soon as you began to care for them,\r\nyou showed your care by sending persons to spy out their liberties,\r\nmisrepresent their character, prey upon them, and eat out their\r\nsubstance.\"\r\n\r\nAnd how does the honorable gentleman mean to maintain, that language\r\nlike this is applicable to the conduct of the government of the United\r\nStates towards the Western emigrants, or to any representation given by\r\nme of that conduct? Were the settlers in the West driven thither by our\r\noppression? Have they flourished only by our neglect of them? Has the\r\ngovernment done nothing but prey upon them, and eat out their\r\nsubstance? Sir, this fervid eloquence of the British speaker, just when\r\nand where it was uttered, and fit to remain an exercise for the\r\nschools, is not a little out of place, when it is brought thence to be\r\napplied here to the conduct of our own country towards her own\r\ncitizens. From America to England, it may be true; from Americans to\r\ntheir own government, it would be strange language. Let us leave it, to\r\nbe recited and declaimed by our boys against a foreign nation; not\r\nintroduce it here, to recite and declaim ourselves against our own.\r\n\r\nBut I come to the point of the alleged contradiction. In my remarks on\r\nWednesday, I contended that we could not give away gratuitously all the\r\npublic lands; that we held them in trust; that the government had\r\nsolemnly pledged itself to dispose of them as a common fund for the\r\ncommon benefit, and to sell and settle them as its discretion should\r\ndictate. Now, Sir, what contradiction does the gentleman find to this\r\nsentiment in the speech of 1825? He quotes me as having then said, that\r\nwe ought not to hug these lands as a very great treasure. Very well,\r\nSir, supposing me to be accurately reported in that expression, what is\r\nthe contradiction? I have not now said, that we should hug these lands\r\nas a favorite source of pecuniary income. No such thing. It is not my\r\nview. What I have said, and what I do say, is, that they are a common\r\nfund, to be disposed of for the common benefit, to be sold at low\r\nprices for the accommodation of settlers, keeping the object of\r\nsettling the lands as much in view as that of raising money from them.\r\nThis I say now, and this I have always said. Is this hugging them as a\r\nfavorite treasure? Is there no difference between hugging and hoarding\r\nthis fund, on the one hand, as a great treasure, and, on the other, of\r\ndisposing of it at low prices, placing the proceeds in the general\r\ntreasury of the Union? My opinion is, that as much is to be made of the\r\nland as fairly and reasonably may be, selling it all the while at such\r\nrates as to give the fullest effect to settlement. This is not giving\r\nit all away to the States, as the gentleman would propose; nor is it\r\nhugging the fund closely and tenaciously, as a favorite treasure; but\r\nit is, in my judgment, a just and wise policy, perfectly according with\r\nall the various duties which rest on government. So much for my\r\ncontradiction. And what is it? Where is the ground of the gentleman's\r\ntriumph? What inconsistency in word or doctrine has he been able to\r\ndetect? Sir, if this be a sample of that discomfiture with which the\r\nhonorable gentleman threatened me, commend me to the word\r\n_discomfiture_ for the rest of my life.\r\n\r\nWe approach, at length, Sir, to a more important part of the honorable\r\ngentleman's observations. Since it does not accord with my views of\r\njustice and policy to give away the public lands altogether, as a mere\r\nmatter of gratuity, I am asked by the honorable gentleman on what\r\nground it is that I consent to vote them away in particular instances.\r\nHow, he inquires, do I reconcile with these professed sentiments, my\r\nsupport of measures appropriating portions of the lands to particular\r\nroads, particular canals, particular rivers, and particular\r\ninstitutions of education in the West? This leads, Sir, to the real and\r\nwide difference in political opinion between the honorable gentleman\r\nand myself. On my part, I look upon all these objects as connected with\r\nthe common good, fairly embraced in its object and its terms; he, on\r\nthe contrary, deems them all, if good at all, only local good. This is\r\nour difference. The interrogatory which he proceeded to put at once\r\nexplains this difference. \"What interest,\" asks he, \"has South Carolina\r\nin a canal in Ohio?\" Sir, this very question is full of significance.\r\nIt develops the gentleman's whole political system; and its answer\r\nexpounds mine. Here we differ. I look upon a road over the Alleghenies,\r\na canal round the falls of the Ohio, or a canal or railway from the\r\nAtlantic to the Western waters, as being an object large and extensive\r\nenough to be fairly said to be for the common benefit. The gentleman\r\nthinks otherwise, and this is the key to his construction of the powers\r\nof the government. He may well ask what interest has South Carolina in\r\na canal in Ohio. On his system, it is true, she has no interest. On\r\nthat system, Ohio and Carolina are different governments, and different\r\ncountries; connected here, it is true, by some slight and ill-defined\r\nbond of union, but in all main respects separate and diverse. On that\r\nsystem, Carolina has no more interest in a canal in Ohio than in\r\nMexico. The gentleman, therefore, only follows out his own principles;\r\nhe does no more than arrive at the natural conclusions of his own\r\ndoctrines; he only announces the true results of that creed which he\r\nhas adopted himself, and would persuade others to adopt, when he thus\r\ndeclares that South Carolina has no interest in a public work in Ohio.\r\n\r\nSir, we narrow-minded people of New England do not reason thus. Our\r\n_notion_ of things is entirely different. We look upon the States, not\r\nas separated, but as united. We love to dwell on that union, and on the\r\nmutual happiness which it has so much promoted, and the common renown\r\nwhich it has so greatly contributed to acquire. In our contemplation,\r\nCarolina and Ohio are parts of the same country; States, united under\r\nthe same general government, having interests, common, associated,\r\nintermingled. In whatever is within the proper sphere of the\r\nconstitutional power of this government, we look upon the States as\r\none. We do not impose geographical limits to our patriotic feeling or\r\nregard; we do not follow rivers and mountains, and lines of latitude,\r\nto find boundaries, beyond which public improvements do not benefit us.\r\nWe who come here, as agents and representatives of these narrow-minded\r\nand selfish men of New England, consider ourselves as bound to regard\r\nwith an equal eye the good of the whole, in whatever is within our\r\npowers of legislation. Sir, if a railroad or canal beginning in South\r\nCarolina and ending in South Carolina, appeared to me to be of national\r\nimportance and national magnitude, believing, as I do, that the power\r\nof government extends to the encouragement of works of that\r\ndescription, if I were to stand up here and ask, What interest has\r\nMassachusetts in a railroad in South Carolina? I should not be willing\r\nto face my constituents. [11] These same narrow-minded men would tell\r\nme, that they had sent me to act for the whole country, and that one\r\nwho possessed too little comprehension, either of intellect or feeling,\r\none one who was not large enough, both in mind and in heart, to embrace\r\nthe whole, was not fit to be intrusted with the interest of any part.\r\n\r\nSir, I do not desire to enlarge the powers of the government by\r\nunjustifiable construction, nor to exercise any not within a fair\r\ninterpretation. But when it is believed that a power does exist, then\r\nit is, in my judgment, to be exercised for the general benefit of the\r\nwhole. So far as respects the exercise of such a. power, the States are\r\none. It was the very object of the Constitution to create unity of\r\ninterests to the extent of the powers of the general government. In war\r\nand peace we are one; in commerce, one; because the authority of the\r\ngeneral government reaches to war and peace, and to the regulation of\r\ncommerce. I have never seen any more difficulty in erecting\r\nlight-houses on the lakes, than on the ocean; in improving the harbors\r\nof inland seas, than if they were within the ebb and flow of the tide;\r\nor in removing obstructions in the vast streams of the West, more than\r\nin any work to facilitate commerce on the Atlantic coast. If there be\r\nany power for one, there is power also for the other; and they are all\r\nand equally for the common good of the country.\r\n\r\nThere are other objects, apparently more local, or the benefit of which\r\nis less general, towards which, nevertheless, I have concurred with\r\nothers, to give aid by donations of land. It is proposed to construct a\r\nroad, in or through one of the new States, in which this government\r\npossesses large quantities of land. Have the United States no right,\r\nor, as a great and untaxed proprietor, are they under no obligation to\r\ncontribute to an object thus calculated to promote the common good of\r\nall the proprietors, themselves included? And even with respect to\r\neducation, which is the extreme case, let the question be considered.\r\nIn the first place, as we have seen, it was made matter of compact with\r\nthese States, that they should do their part to promote education. In\r\nthe next place, our whole system of land laws proceeds on the idea that\r\neducation is for the common good; because, in every division, a certain\r\nportion is uniformly reserved and appropriated for the use of schools.\r\nAnd, finally, have not these new States singularly strong claims,\r\nfounded on the ground already stated, that the government is a great\r\nuntaxed proprietor, in the ownership of the soil? It is a consideration\r\nof great importance, that probably there is in no part of the country,\r\nor of the world, so great call for the means of education, as in these\r\nnew States, owing to the vast number's of persons within those ages in\r\nwhich education and instruction are usually received, if received at\r\nall. This is the natural consequence of recency of settlement and rapid\r\nincrease. The census of these States shows how great a proportion of\r\nthe whole population occupies the classes between infancy and manhood.\r\nThese are the wide fields, and here is the deep and quick soil for the\r\nseeds of knowledge and virtue; and this is the favored season, the very\r\nspring-time for sowing them. Let them be disseminated without stint.\r\nLet them be scattered with a bountiful hand, broadcast. Whatever the\r\ngovernment can fairly do towards these objects, in my opinion, ought to\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nThese, Sir, are the grounds, succinctly stated, on which my votes for\r\ngrants of lands for particular objects rest; while I maintain, at the\r\nsame time, that it is all a common fund, for the common benefit. And\r\nreasons like these, I presume, have influenced the votes of other\r\ngentlemen from New England. Those who have a different view of the\r\npowers of the government, of course, come to different conclusions, on\r\nthese, as on other questions. I observed, when speaking on this subject\r\nbefore, that if we looked to any measure, whether for a road, a canal,\r\nor any thing else, intended for the improvement of the West, it would\r\nbe found that, if the New England _ayes_ were struck out of the lists\r\nof votes, the Southern _noes_ would always have rejected the measure.\r\nThe truth of this has not been denied, and cannot be denied. In stating\r\nthis, I thought it just to ascribe it to the constitutional scruples of\r\nthe South, rather than to any other less favorable or less charitable\r\ncause. But no sooner had I done this, than the honorable gentleman asks\r\nif I reproach him and his friends with their constitutional scruples.\r\nSir, I reproach nobody. I stated a fact, and gave the most respectful\r\nreason for it that occurred to me. The gentleman cannot deny the fact;\r\nhe may, if he choose, disclaim the reason. It is not long since I had\r\noccasion, in presenting a petition from his own State, to account for\r\nits being intrusted to my hands, by saying, that the constitutional\r\nopinions of the gentleman and his worthy colleague prevented them from\r\nsupporting it. Sir, did I state this as matter of reproach? Far from\r\nit. Did I attempt to find any other cause than an honest one for these\r\nscruples? Sir, I did not. It did not become me to doubt or to insinuate\r\nthat the gentleman had either changed his sentiments, or that he had\r\nmade up a set of constitutional opinions accommodated to any particular\r\ncombination of political occurrences. Had I done so, I should have\r\nfelt, that, while I was entitled to little credit in thus questioning\r\nother people's motives, I justified the whole world in suspecting my\r\nown. But how has the gentleman returned this respect for others'\r\nopinions? His own candor and justice, how have they been exhibited\r\ntowards the motives of others, while he has been at so much pains to\r\nmaintain, what nobody has disputed, the purity of his own? Why, Sir, he\r\nhas asked _when_, and _how_, and _why_ New England votes were found\r\ngoing for measures favorable to the West. He has demanded to be\r\ninformed whether all this did not begin in 1825, and while the election\r\nof President was still pending.\r\n\r\nSir, to these questions retort would be justified; and it is both\r\ncogent and at hand. Nevertheless, I will answer the inquiry, not by\r\nretort, but by facts. I will tell the gentleman when, and how, and why\r\nNew England has supported measures favorable to the West. I have\r\nalready referred to the early history of the government, to the first\r\nacquisition of the lands, to the original laws for disposing of them,\r\nand for governing the territories where they lie; and have shown the\r\ninfluence of New England men and New England principles in all these\r\nleading measures. I should not be pardoned were I to go over that\r\nground again. Coming to more recent times, and to measures of a less\r\ngeneral character, I have endeavored to prove that every thing of this\r\nkind, designed for Western improvement, has depended on the votes of\r\nNew England; all this is true beyond the power of contradiction. And\r\nnow, Sir, there are two measures to which I will refer, not so ancient\r\nas to belong to the early history of the public lands, and not so\r\nrecent as to be on this side of the period when the gentleman\r\ncharitably imagines a new direction may have been given to New England\r\nfeeling and New England votes. These measures, and the New England\r\nvotes in support of them, may be taken as samples and specimens of all\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 (observe, Mr. President, in 1820) the people of the West\r\nbesought Congress for a reduction in the price of lands. In favor of\r\nthat reduction, New England, with a delegation of forty members in the\r\nother house, gave thirty-three votes, and one only against it. The four\r\nSouthern States, with more than fifty members, gave thirty-two votes\r\nfor it, and seven against it. Again, in 1821, (observe again, Sir, the\r\ntime,) the law passed for the relief of the purchasers of the public\r\nlands. This was a measure of vital importance to the West, and more\r\nespecially to the Southwest. It authorized the relinquishment of\r\ncontracts for lands which had been entered into at high prices, and a\r\nreduction in other cases of not less than thirty-seven and a half per\r\ncent on the purchase-money. Many millions of dollars, six or seven, I\r\nbelieve, probably much more, were relinquished by this law. On this\r\nbill, New England, with her forty members, gave more affirmative votes\r\nthan the four Southern States, with their fifty-two or fifty-three\r\nmembers. These two are far the most important general measures\r\nrespecting the public lands which have been adopted within the last\r\ntwenty years. They took place in 1820 and 1821. That is the time _when_.\r\n\r\nAs to the manner _how_, the gentleman already sees that it was by\r\nvoting in solid column for the required relief; and, lastly, as to the\r\ncause _why_, I tell the gentleman it was because the members from New\r\nEngland thought the measures just and salutary; because they\r\nentertained towards the West neither envy, hatred, nor malice; because\r\nthey deemed it becoming them, as just and enlightened public men, to\r\nmeet the exigency which had arisen in the West with the appropriate\r\nmeasure of relief; because they felt it due to their own characters,\r\nand the characters of their New England predecessors in this\r\ngovernment, to act towards the new States in the spirit of a liberal,\r\npatronizing, magnanimous policy. So much, Sir, for the cause _why_; and\r\nI hope that by this time, Sir, the honorable gentleman is satisfied; if\r\nnot, I do not know _when_, or _how_, or _why_ he ever will be. Having\r\nrecurred to these two important measures, in answer to the gentleman's\r\ninquiries, I must now beg permission to go back to a period somewhat\r\nearlier, for the purpose of still further showing how much, or rather\r\nhow little, reason there is for the gentleman's insinuation that\r\npolitical hopes or fears, or party associations, were the grounds of\r\nthese New England votes. And after what has been said, I hope it may be\r\nforgiven me if I allude to some political opinions and votes of my own,\r\nof very little public importance certainly, but which, from the time at\r\nwhich they were given and expressed, may pass for good witnesses on\r\nthis occasion.\r\n\r\nThis government, Mr. President, from its origin to the peace of 1815,\r\nhad been too much engrossed with various other important concerns to be\r\nable to turn its thoughts inward, and look to the development of its\r\nvast internal resources. In the early part of President Washington's\r\nadministration, it was fully occupied with completing its own\r\norganization, providing for the public debt, defending the frontiers,\r\nand maintaining domestic peace. Before the termination of that\r\nadministration, the fires of the French Revolution blazed forth, as\r\nfrom a new-opened volcano, and the whole breadth of the ocean did not\r\nsecure us from its effects. The smoke and the cinders reached us,\r\nthough not the burning lava. Difficult and agitating questions,\r\nembarrassing to government and dividing public opinion, sprung out of\r\nthe new state of our foreign relations, and were succeeded by others,\r\nand yet again by others, equally embarrassing and equally exciting\r\ndivision and discord, through the long series of twenty years, till\r\nthey finally issued in the war with England. Down to the close of that\r\nwar, no distinct, marked, and deliberate attention had been given, or\r\ncould have been given, to the internal condition of the country, its\r\ncapacities of improvement, or the constitutional power of the\r\ngovernment in regard to objects connected with such improvement.\r\n\r\nThe peace, Mr. President, brought about an entirely new and a most\r\ninteresting state of things; it opened to us other prospects and\r\nsuggested other duties. We ourselves were changed, and the whole world\r\nwas changed. The pacification of Europe, after June, 1815, assumed a\r\nfirm and permanent aspect. The nations evidently manifested that they\r\nwere disposed for peace. Some agitation of the waves might be expected,\r\neven after the storm had subsided; but the tendency was, strongly and\r\nrapidly, towards settled repose.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, Sir, that I was at that time a member of Congress, and,\r\nlike others, naturally turned my thoughts to the contemplation of the\r\nrecently altered condition of the country and of the world. It appeared\r\nplainly enough to me, as well as to wiser and more experienced men,\r\nthat the policy of the government would naturally take a start in a new\r\ndirection; because new directions would necessarily be given to the\r\npursuits and occupations of the people. We had pushed our commerce far\r\nand fast, under the advantage of a neutral flag. But there were now no\r\nlonger flags, either neutral or belligerent. The harvest of neutrality\r\nhad been great, but we had gathered it all. With the peace of Europe,\r\nit was obvious there would spring up in her circle of nations a revived\r\nand invigorated spirit of trade, and a new activity in all the business\r\nand objects of civilized life. Hereafter, our commercial gains were to\r\nbe earned only by success in a close and intense competition. Other\r\nnations would produce for themselves, and carry for themselves, and\r\nmanufacture for themselves, to the full extent of their abilities. The\r\ncrops of our plains would no longer sustain European armies, nor our\r\nships longer supply those whom war had rendered unable to supply\r\nthemselves. It was obvious, that, under these circumstances, the\r\ncountry would begin to survey itself, and to estimate its own capacity\r\nof improvement.\r\n\r\nAnd this improvement,--how was it to be accomplished, and who was to\r\naccomplish it? We were ten or twelve millions of people, spread over\r\nalmost half a world. We were more than twenty States, some stretching\r\nalong the same seaboard, some along the same line of inland frontier,\r\nand others on opposite banks of the same vast rivers. Two\r\nconsiderations at once presented themselves with great force, in\r\nlooking at this state of things. One was, that that great branch of\r\nimprovement which consisted in furnishing new facilities of intercourse\r\nnecessarily ran into different States in every leading instance, and\r\nwould benefit the citizens of all such States. No one State, therefore,\r\nin such cases, would assume the whole expense, nor was the co-operation\r\nof several States to be expected. Take the instance of the Delaware\r\nbreakwater. It will cost several millions of money. Would Pennsylvania\r\nalone ever have constructed it? Certainly never, while this Union\r\nlasts, because it is not for her sole benefit. Would Pennsylvania, New\r\nJersey, and Delaware have united to accomplish it at their joint\r\nexpense? Certainly not, for the same reason. It could not be done,\r\ntherefore, but by the general government. The same may be said of the\r\nlarge inland undertakings, except that, in them, government, instead of\r\nbearing the whole expense, co-operates with others who bear a part. The\r\nother consideration is, that the United States have the means. They\r\nenjoy the revenues derived from commerce, and the States have no\r\nabundant and easy sources of public income. The custom-houses fill the\r\ngeneral treasury, while the States have scanty resources, except by\r\nresort to heavy direct taxes.\r\n\r\nUnder this view of things, I thought it necessary to settle, at least\r\nfor myself, some definite notions with respect to the powers of the\r\ngovernment in regard to internal affairs. It may not savor too much of\r\nself-commendation to remark, that, with this object, I considered the\r\nConstitution, its judicial construction, its contemporaneous\r\nexposition, and the whole history of the legislation of Congress under\r\nit; and I arrived at the conclusion, that government had power to\r\naccomplish sundry objects, or aid in their accomplishment, which are\r\nnow commonly spoken of as INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS. That conclusion, Sir,\r\nmay have been right, or it may have been wrong. I am not about to argue\r\nthe grounds of it at large. I say only, that it was adopted and acted\r\non even so early as in 1816. Yes, Mr. President, I made up my opinion,\r\nand determined on my intended course of political conduct, on these\r\nsubjects, in the Fourteenth Congress, in 1816. And now, Mr. President,\r\nI have further to say, that I made up these opinions, and entered on\r\nthis course of political conduct, _Teucro duce_. [12] Yes, Sir, I\r\npursued in all this a South Carolina track on the doctrines of internal\r\nimprovement. South Carolina, as she was then represented in the other\r\nhouse, set forth in 1816 under a fresh and leading breeze, and I was\r\namong the followers. But if my leader sees new lights and turns a sharp\r\ncorner, unless I see new lights also, I keep straight on in the same\r\npath. I repeat, that leading gentlemen from South Carolina were first\r\nand foremost in behalf of the doctrines of internal improvements, when\r\nthose doctrines came first to be considered and acted upon in Congress.\r\nThe debate on the bank question, on the tariff of 1816, and on the\r\ndirect tax, will show who was who, and what was what, at that time.\r\n\r\nThe tariff of 1816, (one of the plain cases of oppression and\r\nusurpation, from which, if the government does not recede, individual\r\nStates may justly secede from the government,) is, Sir, in truth, a\r\nSouth Carolina tariff, supported by South Carolina votes. But for those\r\nvotes, it could not have passed in the form in which it did pass;\r\nwhereas, if it had depended on Massachusetts votes, it would have been\r\nlost. Does not the honorable gentleman well know all this? There are\r\ncertainly those who do, full well, know it all. I do not say this to\r\nreproach South Carolina. I only state the fact; and I think it will\r\nappear to be true, that among the earliest and boldest advocates of the\r\ntariff, as a measure of protection, and on the express ground of\r\nprotection, were leading gentlemen of South Carolina in Congress. I did\r\nnot then, and cannot now, understand their language in any other sense.\r\nWhile this tariff of 1816 was under discussion in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, an honorable gentleman from Georgia, [13] now of this\r\nhouse, moved to reduce the proposed duty on cotton. He failed, by four\r\nvotes, South Carolina giving three votes (enough to have turned the\r\nscale) against his motion. The act, Sir, then passed, and received on\r\nits passage the support of a majority of the Representatives of South\r\nCarolina present and voting. This act is the first in the order of\r\nthose now denounced as plain usurpations. We see it daily in the list,\r\nby the side of those of 1824 and 1828, as a case of manifest\r\noppression, justifying disunion. I put it home to the honorable member\r\nfrom South Carolina, that his own State was not only \"art and part\" in\r\nthis measure, but the _causa causans_. Without her aid, this seminal\r\nprinciple of mischief, this root of Upas, could not have been planted.\r\nI have already said, and it is true, that this act proceeded on the\r\nground of protection. It interfered directly with existing interests of\r\ngreat value and amount. It cut up the Calcutta cotton trade by the\r\nroots; but it passed, nevertheless, and it passed on the principle of\r\nprotecting manufactures, on the principle against free trade, on the\r\nprinciple opposed to that _which lets us alone_. [14]\r\n\r\nSuch, Mr. President, were the opinions of important and leading\r\ngentlemen from South Carolina, on the subject of internal improvement,\r\nin 1816. I went out of Congress the next year, and, returning again in\r\n1823, thought I found South Carolina where I had left her. I really\r\nsupposed that all things remained as they were, and that the South\r\nCarolina doctrine of internal improvements would be defended by the\r\nsame eloquent voices, and the same strong arms, as formerly. In the\r\nlapse of these six years, it is true, political associations had\r\nassumed a new aspect and new divisions. A strong party had arisen in\r\nthe South hostile to the doctrine of internal improvements.\r\nAnti-consolidation was the flag under which this party fought; and its\r\nsupporters inveighed against internal improvements, much after the\r\nmanner in which the honorable gentleman has now inveighed against them,\r\nas part and parcel of the system of consolidation. Whether this party\r\narose in South Carolina itself, or in the neighborhood, is more than I\r\nknow. I think the latter. However that may have been, there were those\r\nfound in South Carolina ready to make war upon it, and who did make\r\nintrepid war upon it. Names being regarded as things in such\r\ncontroversies, they bestowed on the anti-improvement gentlemen the\r\nappellation of Radicals. Yes, Sir, the appellation of Radicals, as a\r\nterm of distinction applicable and applied to those who denied the\r\nliberal doctrines of internal improvement, originated, according to the\r\nbest of my recollection, somewhere between North Carolina and Georgia.\r\nWell, Sir, these mischievous Radicals were to be put down, and the\r\nstrong arm of South Carolina was stretched out to put them down. About\r\nthis time I returned to Congress. The battle with the Radicals had been\r\nfought, and our South Carolina champions of the doctrines of internal\r\nimprovement had nobly maintained their ground, and were understood to\r\nhave achieved a victory. We looked upon them as conquerors. They had\r\ndriven back the enemy with discomfiture, a thing, by the way, Sir,\r\nwhich is not always performed when it is promised. A gentleman to whom\r\nI have already referred in this debate had come into Congress, during\r\nmy absence from it, from South Carolina, and had brought with him a\r\nhigh reputation for ability. He came from a school with which we had\r\nbeen acquainted, _et noscitur a sociis_. I hold in my hand, Sir, a\r\nprinted speech of this distinguished gentleman,[15] \"ON INTERNAL\r\nIMPROVEMENTS,\" delivered about the period to which I now refer, and\r\nprinted with a few introductory remarks upon _consolidation_; in which,\r\nSir, I think he quite consolidated the arguments of his opponents, the\r\nRadicals, if to _crush_ be to consolidate. I give you a short but\r\nsignificant quotation from these remarks. He is speaking of a pamphlet,\r\nthen recently published, entitled \"Consolidation\"; and, having alluded\r\nto the question of renewing the charter of the former Bank of the\r\nUnited States, he says:--\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, in the early history of parties, and when Mr. Crawford\r\nadvocated a renewal of the old charter, it was considered a Federal\r\nmeasure; which internal improvement never was, as this author\r\nerroneously states. This latter measure originated in the\r\nadministration of Mr. Jefferson, with the appropriation for the\r\nCumberland Road; and was first proposed, _as a system_, by Mr. Calhoun,\r\nand carried through the House of Representatives by a large majority of\r\nthe Republicans, including almost every one of the leading men who\r\ncarried us through the late war.\"\r\n\r\nSo, then, internal improvement is not one of the Federal heresies.\r\n\r\nWhen I took my seat there as a member from Massachusetts in 1823, we\r\nhad a bill before us, and passed it in that house, entitled, \"An Act to\r\nprocure the necessary surveys, plans, and estimates upon the subject of\r\nroads and canals.\" It authorized the President to cause surveys and\r\nestimates to be made of the routes of such roads and canals as he might\r\ndeem of national importance in a commercial or military point of view,\r\nor for the transportation of the mail, and appropriated thirty thousand\r\ndollars out of the treasury to defray the expense. This act, though\r\npreliminary in its nature, covered the whole ground. It took for\r\ngranted the complete power of internal improvement, as far as any of\r\nits advocates had ever contended for it. Having passed the other house,\r\nthe bill came up to the Senate, and was here considered and debated in\r\nApril, 1824. The honorable member from South Carolina was a member of\r\nthe Senate at that time. While the bill was under consideration here, a\r\nmotion was made to add the following proviso: \"_Provided_, That nothing\r\nherein contained shall be construed to affirm _or admit_ a power in\r\nCongress, on their own authority, to make roads or canals within any of\r\nthe States of the Union.\" The yeas and nays were taken on this proviso,\r\nand the honorable member voted _in the negative!_ The proviso failed.\r\n\r\nA motion was then made to add this proviso, viz.: \"_Provided_, That the\r\nfaith of the United States is hereby pledged, that no money shall ever\r\nbe expended for roads or canals, except it shall be among the several\r\nStates, and in the same proportion as direct taxes are laid and\r\nassessed by the provisions of the Constitution.\" The honorable member\r\nvoted _against this proviso_ also, and it failed. The bill was then put\r\non its passage, and the honorable member voted _for it_, and it passed,\r\nand became a law.\r\n\r\nNow, it strikes me, Sir, that there is no maintaining these votes, but\r\nupon the power of internal improvement, in its broadest sense. In\r\ntruth, these bills for surveys and estimates have always been\r\nconsidered as test questions; they show who is for and who against\r\ninternal improvement. This law itself went the whole length, and\r\nassumed the full and complete power. The gentleman's votes sustained\r\nthat power, in every form in which the various propositions to amend\r\npresented it. He went for the entire and unrestrained authority,\r\nwithout consulting the States, and without agreeing to any\r\nproportionate distribution. And now suffer me to remind you, Mr.\r\nPresident, that it is this very same power, thus sanctioned, in every\r\nform, by the gentleman's own opinion, which is so plain and manifest a\r\nusurpation, that the State of South Carolina is supposed to be\r\njustified in refusing submission to any laws carrying the power into\r\neffect. Truly, Sir, is not this a little too hard? May we not crave\r\nsome mercy, under favor and protection of the gentleman's own\r\nauthority? Admitting that a road, or a canal, must be written down flat\r\nusurpation as was ever committed, may we find no mitigation in our\r\nrespect for his place, and his vote, as one that knows the law?\r\n\r\nThe tariff, which South Carolina had an efficient hand in establishing,\r\nin 1816, and this asserted power of internal improvement, advanced by\r\nher in the same year, and, as we have seen, approved and sanctioned by\r\nher Representatives in 1824,--these two measures are the great grounds\r\non which she is now thought to be justified in breaking up the Union,\r\nif she sees fit to break it up!\r\n\r\nI may now safely say, I think, that we have had the authority of\r\nleading and distinguished gentlemen from South Carolina in support of\r\nthe doctrine of internal improvement. I repeat, that, up to 1824, I for\r\none followed South Carolina; but when that star, in its ascension,\r\nveered off in an unexpected direction, I relied on its light no longer.\r\nI have thus, Sir, perhaps not without some tediousness of detail,\r\nshown, if I am in error on the subject of internal improvement, how,\r\nand in what company, I fell into that error. If I am wrong, it is\r\napparent who misled me.\r\n\r\nI go to other remarks of the honorable member; and I have to complain\r\nof an entire misapprehension of what I said on the subject of the\r\nnational debt, though I can hardly perceive how any one could\r\nmisunderstand me. What I said was, not that I wished to put off the\r\npayment of the debt, but, on the contrary, that I had always voted for\r\nevery measure for its reduction, as uniformly as the gentleman himself.\r\nHe seems to claim the exclusive merit of a disposition to reduce the\r\npublic charge. I do not allow it to him. As a debt, I was, I am for\r\npaying it, because it is a charge on our finances, and on the industry\r\nof the country. But I observed, that I thought I perceived a morbid\r\nfervor on that subject, an excessive anxiety to pay off the debt, not\r\nso much because it is a debt simply, as because, while it lasts, it\r\nfurnishes one objection to disunion. It is, while it continues, a tie\r\nof common interest. I did not impute such motives to the honorable\r\nmember himself, but that there is such an opinion in existence I have\r\nnot a particle of doubt. The most I said was, that, if one effect of\r\nthe debt was to strengthen our Union, that effect itself was not\r\nregretted by me, however much others might regret it. The gentleman has\r\nnot seen how to reply to this, otherwise than by supposing me to have\r\nadvanced the doctrine that a national debt is a national blessing.\r\nOthers, I must hope, will find much less difficulty in understanding\r\nme. I distinctly and pointedly cautioned the honorable member not to\r\nunderstand me as expressing an opinion favorable to the continuance of\r\nthe debt. I repeated this caution, and repeated it more than once; but\r\nit was thrown away.\r\n\r\nOn yet another point, I was still more unaccountably misunderstood. The\r\ngentleman had harangued against \"consolidation.\" I told him, in reply,\r\nthat there was one kind of consolidation to which I was attached, and\r\nthat was the consolidation of our Union; that this was precisely that\r\nconsolidation to which I feared others were not attached, and that such\r\nconsolidation was the very end of the Constitution, the leading object,\r\nas they had informed us themselves, which its framers had kept in view.\r\nI turned to their communication,[16] and read their very words, \"the\r\nconsolidation of the Union,\" and expressed my devotion to this sort of\r\nconsolidation. I said, in terms, that I wished not in the slightest\r\ndegree to augment the powers of this government; that my object was to\r\npreserve, not to enlarge; and that by consolidating the Union I\r\nunderstood no more than the strengthening of the Union, and\r\nperpetuating it. Having been thus explicit, having thus read from the\r\nprinted book the precise words which I adopted, as expressing my own\r\nsentiments, it passes comprehension how any man could understand me as\r\ncontending for an extension of the powers of the government, or for\r\nconsolidation in that odious sense in which it means an accumulation,\r\nin the federal government, of the powers properly belonging to the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI repeat, Sir, that, in adopting the sentiment of the framers of the\r\nConstitution, I read their language audibly, and word for word; and I\r\npointed out the distinction, just as fully as I have now done, between\r\nthe consolidation of the Union and that other obnoxious consolidation\r\nwhich I disclaimed. And yet the honorable member misunderstood me. The\r\ngentleman had said that he wished for no fixed revenue,--not a\r\nshilling. If by a word he could convert the Capitol into gold, he would\r\nnot do it. Why all this fear of revenue? Why, Sir, because, as the\r\ngentleman told us, it tends to consolidation. Now this can mean neither\r\nmore nor less than, that a common revenue is a common interest, and\r\nthat all common interests tend to preserve the union of the States. I\r\nconfess I like that tendency; if the gentleman dislikes it, he is right\r\nin deprecating a shilling of fixed revenue. So much, Sir, for\r\nconsolidation.\r\n\r\nAs well as I recollect the course of his remarks, the honorable\r\ngentleman next recurred to the subject of the tariff. He did not doubt\r\nthe word must be of unpleasant sound to me, and proceeded, with an\r\neffort neither new nor attended with new success, to involve me and my\r\nvotes in inconsistency and contradiction. I am happy the honorable\r\ngentleman has furnished me an opportunity of a timely remark or two on\r\nthat subject. I was glad he approached it, for it is a question I enter\r\nupon without fear from anybody. The strenuous toil of the gentleman has\r\nbeen to raise an inconsistency between my dissent to the tariff in\r\n1824, and my vote in 1828. It is labor lost. He pays undeserved\r\ncompliment to my speech in 1824; but this is to raise me high, that my\r\nfall, as he would have it, in 1828, may be more signal. Sir, there was\r\nno fall. Between the ground I stood on in 1824 and that I took in 1828,\r\nthere was not only no precipice, but no declivity. It was a change of\r\nposition to meet new circumstances, but on the same level. A plain tale\r\nexplains the whole matter. In 1816 I had not acquiesced in the tariff,\r\nthen supported by South Carolina. To some parts of it, especially, I\r\nfelt and expressed great repugnance. I held the same opinions in 1820,\r\nat the meeting in Faneuil Hall, to which the gentleman has alluded.\r\n\r\nWith a great majority of the Representatives of Massachusetts, I voted\r\nagainst the tariff of 1824.[17] My reasons were then given, and I will\r\nnot now repeat them. But, notwithstanding our dissent, the great States\r\nof New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky went for the bill, in\r\nalmost unbroken column, and it passed. Congress and the President\r\nsanctioned it, and it became the law of the land. What, then, were we\r\nto do? Our only option was, either to fall in with this settled course\r\nof public policy, and accommodate ourselves to it as well as we could,\r\nor to embrace the South Carolina doctrine, and talk of nullifying the\r\nstatute by State interference.\r\n\r\nThis last alternative did not suit our principles, and of course we\r\nadopted the former. In 1827, the subject came again before Congress, on\r\na proposition to afford some relief to the branch of wool and woollens.\r\nWe looked upon the system of protection as being fixed and settled. The\r\nlaw of 1824 remained. It had gone into full operation, and, in regard\r\nto some objects intended by it, perhaps most of them, had produced all\r\nits expected effects. No man proposed to repeal it; no man attempted to\r\nrenew the general contest on its principle. But, owing to subsequent\r\nand unforeseen occurrences, the benefit intended by it to wool and\r\nwoollen fabrics had not been realized. Events not known here when the\r\nlaw passed had taken place, which defeated its object in that\r\nparticular respect. A measure was accordingly brought forward to meet\r\nthis precise deficiency, to remedy this particular defect. It was\r\nlimited to wool and woollens. Was ever anything more reasonable? If the\r\npolicy of the tariff laws had become established in principle, as the\r\npermanent policy of the government, should they not be revised and\r\namended, and made equal, like other laws, as exigencies should arise,\r\nor justice require? Because we had doubted about adopting the system,\r\nwere we to refuse to cure its manifest defects, after it had been\r\nadopted, and when no one attempted its repeal? And this, Sir, is the\r\ninconsistency so much bruited. I had voted against the tariff of 1824,\r\nbut it passed; and in 1827 and 1828 I voted to amend it, in a point\r\nessential to the interest of my constituents. Where is the\r\ninconsistency? Could I do otherwise? Sir, does political consistency\r\nconsist in always giving negative votes? Does it require of a public\r\nman to refuse to concur in amending laws, because they passed against\r\nhis consent? Having voted against the tariff originally, does\r\nconsistency demand that I should do all in my power to maintain an\r\nunequal tariff, burdensome to my own constituents in many respects,\r\nfavorable in none? To consistency of that sort, I lay no claim. And\r\nthere is another sort to which I lay as little, and that is, a kind of\r\nconsistency by which persons feel themselves as much bound to oppose a\r\nproposition after it has become a law of the land as before.\r\n\r\nSir, as to the general subject of the tariff, I have little now to say.\r\nAnother opportunity may be presented. I remarked the other day, that\r\nthis policy did not begin with us in New England; and yet, Sir, New\r\nEngland is charged with vehemence as being favorable, or charged with\r\nequal vehemence as being unfavorable, to the tariff policy, just as\r\nbest suits the time, place, and occasion for making some charge against\r\nher. The credulity of the public has been put to its extreme capacity\r\nof false impression relative to her conduct in this particular. Through\r\nall the South, during the late contest, it was New England policy and a\r\nNew England administration that were afflicting the country with a\r\ntariff beyond all endurance; while on the other side of the Alleghanies\r\neven the act of 1828 itself, the very sublimated essence of oppression,\r\naccording to Southern opinions, was pronounced to be one of those\r\nblessings for which the West was indebted to the \"generous South.\"\r\n\r\nWith large investments in manufacturing establishments, and many and\r\nvarious interests connected with and dependent on them, it is not to be\r\nexpected that New England, any more than other portions of the country,\r\nwill now consent to any measure destructive or highly dangerous. The\r\nduty of the government, at the present moment, would seem to be to\r\npreserve, not to destroy; to maintain the position which it has\r\nassumed; and, for one, I shall feel it an indispensable obligation to\r\nhold it steady, as far as in my power, to that degree of protection\r\nwhich it has undertaken to bestow. No more of the tariff.\r\n\r\nProfessing to be provoked by what he chose to consider a charge made by\r\nme against South Carolina, the honorable member, Mr. President, has\r\ntaken up a new crusade against New England. Leaving altogether the\r\nsubject of the public lands, in which his success, perhaps, had been\r\nneither distinguished nor satisfactory, and letting go, also, of the\r\ntopic of the tariff, he sallied forth in a general assault on the\r\nopinions, politics, and parties of New England, as they have been\r\nexhibited in the last thirty years. This is natural. The \"narrow\r\npolicy\" of the public lands had proved a legal settlement in South\r\nCarolina, and was not to be removed. The \"accursed policy\" of the\r\ntariff, also, had established the fact of its birth and parentage in\r\nthe same State. No wonder, therefore, the gentleman wished to carry the\r\nwar, as he expressed it, into the enemy's country. Prudently willing to\r\nquit these subjects, he was, doubtless, desirous of fastening on\r\nothers, which could not be transferred south of Mason and Dixon's line.\r\nThe politics of New England became his theme; and it was in this part\r\nof his speech, I think, that he menaced me with such sore discomfiture.\r\nDiscomfiture! Why, Sir, when he attacks anything which I maintain, and\r\noverthrows it, when he turns the right or left of any position which I\r\ntake up, when he drives me from any ground I choose to occupy, he may\r\nthen talk of discomfiture, but not till that distant day. What has he\r\ndone? Has he maintained his own charges? Has he proved what he alleged?\r\nHas he sustained himself in his attack on the government, and on the\r\nhistory of the North, in the matter of the public lands? Has he\r\ndisproved a fact, refuted a proposition, weakened an argument,\r\nmaintained by me? Has he come within beat of drum of any position of\r\nmine? O, no; but he has \"carried the war into the enemy's country\"!\r\nCarried the war into the enemy's country! Yes, Sir, and what sort of a\r\nwar has he made of it? Why, Sir, he has stretched a drag-net over the\r\nwhole surface of perished pamphlets, indiscreet sermons, frothy\r\nparagraphs, and fuming popular addresses,--over whatever the pulpit in\r\nits moments of alarm, the press in its heats, and parties in their\r\nextravagance, have severally thrown off in times of general excitement\r\nand violence. He has thus swept together a mass of such things as, but\r\nthat they are now old and cold, the public health would have required\r\nhim rather to leave in their state of dispersion. For a good long hour\r\nor two, we had the unbroken pleasure of listening to the honorable\r\nmember, while he recited with his usual grace and spirit, and with\r\nevident high gusto, speeches, pamphlets, addresses, and all the _et\r\ncaeteras_ of the political press, such as warm heads produce in warm\r\ntimes; and such as it would be \"discomfiture\" indeed for any one, whose\r\ntaste did not delight in that sort of reading, to be obliged to peruse.\r\nThis is his war. This it is to carry the war into the enemy's country.\r\nIt is in an invasion of this sort, that he flatters himself with the\r\nexpectation of gaining laurels fit to adorn a Senator's brow!\r\n\r\nMr. President, I shall not, it will not, I trust, be expected that I\r\nshould, either now or at any time, separate this farrago into parts,\r\nand answer and examine its components. I shall barely bestow upon it\r\nall a general remark or two. In the run of forty years, Sir, under this\r\nConstitution, we have experienced sundry successive violent party\r\ncontests. Party arose, indeed, with the Constitution itself, and, in\r\nsome form or other, has attended it through the greater part of its\r\nhistory. Whether any other constitution than the old Articles of\r\nConfederation was desirable, was itself a question on which parties\r\ndivided; if a new constitution were framed, what powers should be given\r\nto it was another question; and when it had been formed, what was, in\r\nfact, the just extent of the powers actually conferred was a third.\r\nParties, as we know, existed under the first administration, as\r\ndistinctly marked as those which have manifested themselves at any\r\nsubsequent period. The contest immediately preceding the political\r\nchange in 1801, and that, again, which existed at the commencement of\r\nthe late war, are other instances of party excitement, of something\r\nmore than usual strength and intensity. In all these conflicts there\r\nwas, no doubt, much of violence on both and all sides. It would be\r\nimpossible, if one had a fancy for such employment, to adjust the\r\nrelative _quantum_ of violence between these contending parties. There\r\nwas enough in each, as must always be expected in popular governments.\r\nWith a great deal of popular and decorous discussion, there was mingled\r\na great deal, also, of declamation, virulence, crimination, and abuse.\r\nIn regard to any party, probably, at one of the leading epochs in the\r\nhistory of parties, enough may be found to make out another inflamed\r\nexhibition, not unlike that with which the honorable member has edified\r\nus. For myself, Sir, I shall not rake among the rubbish of bygone\r\ntimes, to see what I can find, or whether I cannot find something by\r\nwhich I can fix a blot on the escutcheon of any State, any party, or\r\nany part of the country. General Washington's administration was\r\nsteadily and zealously maintained, as we all know, by New England. It\r\nwas violently opposed elsewhere. We know in what quarter he had the\r\nmost earnest, constant, and persevering support, in all his great and\r\nleading measures. We know where his private and personal character was\r\nheld in the highest degree of attachment and veneration; and we know,\r\ntoo, where his measures were opposed, his services slighted, and his\r\ncharacter vilified. We know, or we might know, if we turned to the\r\njournals, who expressed respect, gratitude, and regret, when he retired\r\nfrom the chief magistracy, and who refused to express either respect,\r\ngratitude, or regret. I shall not open those journals. Publications\r\nmore abusive or scurrilous never saw the light, than were sent forth\r\nagainst Washington, and all his leading measures, from presses south of\r\nNew England. But I shall not look them up. I employ no scavengers, no\r\none is in attendance on me, furnishing such means of retaliation; and\r\nif there were, with an ass's load of them, with a bulk as huge as that\r\nwhich the gentleman himself has produced, I would not touch one of\r\nthem. I see enough of the violence of our own times, to be no way\r\nanxious to rescue from forgetfulness the extravagances of times past.\r\n\r\nBesides, what is all this to the present purpose? It has nothing to do\r\nwith the public lands, in regard to which the attack was begun; and it\r\nhas nothing to do with those sentiments and opinions which, I have\r\nthought, tend to disunion and all of which the honorable member seems\r\nto have adopted himself, and undertaken to defend. New England has, at\r\ntimes, so argues the gentleman, held opinions as dangerous as those\r\nwhich he now holds. Suppose this were so; why should _he_ therefore\r\nabuse New England? If he finds himself countenanced by acts of hers,\r\nhow is it that, while he relies on these acts, he covers, or seeks to\r\ncover, their authors with reproach? But, Sir, if, in the course of\r\nforty years, there have been undue effervescences of party in New\r\nEngland, has the same thing happened nowhere else? Party animosity and\r\nparty outrage, not in New England, but elsewhere, denounced President\r\nWashington, not only as a Federalist, but as a Tory, a British agent, a\r\nman who, in his high office, sanctioned corruption. But does the\r\nhonorable member suppose, if I had a tender here who should put such an\r\neffusion of wickedness and folly into my hand, that I would stand up\r\nand read it against the South? Parties ran into great heats again in\r\n1799 and 1800. What was said, Sir, or rather what was not said, in\r\nthose years, against John Adams, one of the committee that drafted the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and its admitted ablest defender on the\r\nfloor of Congress? If the gentleman wishes to increase his stores of\r\nparty abuse and frothy violence, if he has a determined proclivity to\r\nsuch pursuits, there are treasures of that sort south of the Potomac,\r\nmuch to his taste, yet untouched. I shall not touch them.\r\n\r\nThe parties which divided the country at the commencement of the late\r\nwar were violent. But then there was violence on both sides, and\r\nviolence in every State. Minorities and majorities were equally\r\nviolent. There was no more violence against the war in New England,\r\nthan in other States; nor any more appearance of violence, except that,\r\nowing to a dense population, greater facility of assembling, and more\r\npresses, there may have been more in quantity spoken and printed there\r\nthan in some other places. In the article of sermons, too, New England\r\nis somewhat more abundant than South Carolina; and for that reason the\r\nchance of finding here and there an exceptionable one may be greater. I\r\nhope, too, there are more good ones. Opposition may have been more\r\nformidable in New England, as it embraced a larger portion of the whole\r\npopulation; but it was no more unrestrained in principle, or violent in\r\nmanner. The minorities dealt quite as harshly with their own State\r\ngovernments as the majorities dealt with the administration here. There\r\nwere presses on both sides, popular meetings on both sides, ay, and\r\npulpits on both sides also. The gentleman's purveyors have only catered\r\nfor him among the productions of one side. I certainly shall not supply\r\nthe deficiency by furnishing samples of the other. I leave to him, and\r\nto them, the whole concern.\r\n\r\nIt is enough for me to say, that if, in any part of this their grateful\r\noccupation, if, in all their researches, they find anything in the\r\nhistory of Massachusetts, or New England, or in the proceedings of any\r\nlegislative or other public body, disloyal to the Union, speaking\r\nslightingly of its value, proposing to break it up, or recommending\r\nnon-intercourse with neighboring States, on account of difference of\r\npolitical opinion, then, Sir, I give them all up to the honorable\r\ngentleman's unrestrained rebuke; expecting, however, that he will\r\nextend his buffetings in like manner _to all similar proceedings,\r\nwherever else found_.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman, Sir, has spoken at large of former parties, now no\r\nlonger in being, by their received appellations, and has undertaken to\r\ninstruct us, not only in the knowledge of their principles, but of\r\ntheir respective pedigrees also. He has ascended to their origin, and\r\nrun out their genealogies. With most exemplary modesty, he speaks of\r\nthe party to which he professes to have himself belonged, as the true\r\nPure, the only honest, patriotic party, derived by regular descent,\r\nfrom father to son, from the time of the virtuous Romans! Spreading\r\nbefore us the _family tree_ of political parties, he takes especial\r\ncare to show himself snugly perched on a popular bough! He is wakeful\r\nto the expediency of adopting such rules of descent as shall bring him\r\nin, to the exclusion of others, as an heir to the inheritance of all\r\npublic virtue, and all true political principle. His party and his\r\nopinions are sure to be orthodox; heterodoxy is confined to his\r\nopponents. He spoke, Sir, of the Federalists, and I thought I saw some\r\neyes begin to open and stare a little, when he ventured on that ground.\r\nI expected he would draw his sketches rather lightly, when he looked on\r\nthe circle round him, and especially if he should cast his thoughts to\r\nthe high places out of the Senate. [18] Nevertheless, he went back to\r\nRome, _ad annum urbis condita_, and found the fathers of the\r\nFederalists in the primeval aristocrats of that renowned--city! He\r\ntraced the flow of Federal blood down through successive ages and\r\ncenturies, till he brought it into the veins of the American Tories, of\r\nwhom, by the way, there were twenty in the Carolinas for one in\r\nMassachusetts. From the Tories he followed it to the Federalists; and,\r\nas the Federal party was broken up, and there was no possibility of\r\ntransmitting it further on this side the Atlantic, he seems to have\r\ndiscovered that it has gone off collaterally, though against all the\r\ncanons of descent, into the Ultras of France, and finally become\r\nextinguished, like exploded gas, among the adherents of Don Miguel! [19]\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is an abstract of the gentleman's history of Federalism. I\r\nam not about to controvert it. It is not, at present, worth the pains\r\nof refutation; because, Sir, if at this day any one feels the sin of\r\nFederalism lying heavily on his conscience, he can easily procure\r\nremission. He may even obtain an indulgence, if he be desirous of\r\nrepeating the same transgression. It is an affair of no difficulty to\r\nget into this same right line of patriotic descent. A man now-a-days is\r\nat liberty to choose his political parentage. He may elect his own\r\nfather. Federalist or not, he may, if he choose, claim to belong to the\r\nfavored stock, and his claim will be allowed. He may carry back his\r\npretensions just as far as the honorable gentleman himself; nay, he may\r\nmake himself out the honorable gentleman's cousin, and prove,\r\nsatisfactorily, that he is descended from the same political\r\ngreat-grandfather. All this is allowable. We all know a process, Sir,\r\nby which the whole Essex Junto [Footnote:20] could, in one hour, be all\r\nwashed white from their ancient Federalism, and come out, every one of\r\nthem, original Democrats, dyed in the wool! Some of them have actually\r\nundergone the operation, and they say it is quite easy. The only\r\ninconvenience it occasions, as they tell us, is a slight tendency of\r\nthe blood to the face, a soft suffusion, which, however, is very\r\ntransient, since nothing is said by those whom they join calculated to\r\ndeepen the red on the cheek, but a prudent silence is observed in\r\nregard to all the past. Indeed, Sir, some smiles of approbation have\r\nbeen bestowed, and some crumbs of comfort have fallen, not a thousand\r\nmiles from the door of the Hartford Convention itself. And if the\r\nauthor of the Ordinance of 1787 possessed the other requisite\r\nqualifications, there is no knowing, notwithstanding his Federalism, to\r\nwhat heights of favor he might not yet attain.\r\n\r\nMr. President, in carrying his warfare, such as it is, into New\r\nEngland, the honorable gentleman all along professes to be acting on\r\nthe defensive. He chooses to consider me as having assailed South\r\nCarolina, and insists that he comes forth only as her champion, and in\r\nher defence. Sir, I do not admit that I made any attack whatever on\r\nSouth Carolina. Nothing like it. The honorable member, in his first\r\nspeech, expressed opinions, in regard to revenue and some other topics,\r\nwhich I heard both with pain and with surprise. I told the gentleman I\r\nwas aware that such sentiments were entertained _out_ of the\r\ngovernment, but had not expected to find them advanced in it; that I\r\nknew there were persons in the South who speak of our Union with\r\nindifference or doubt, taking pains to magnify its evils, and to say\r\nnothing of its benefits; that the honorable member himself, I was sure,\r\ncould never be one of these; and I regretted the expression of such\r\nopinions as he had avowed, because I thought their obvious tendency was\r\nto encourage feelings of disrespect to the Union, and to impair its\r\nstrength. This, Sir, is the sum and substance of all I said on the\r\nsubject. And this constitutes the attack which called on the chivalry\r\nof the gentleman, in his own opinion, to harry us with such a foray\r\namong the party pamphlets and party proceedings of Massachusetts! If he\r\nmeans that I spoke with dissatisfaction or disrespect of the\r\nebullitions of individuals in South Carolina, it is true. But if he\r\nmeans that I assailed the character of the State, her honor, or\r\npatriotism, that I reflected on her history or her conduct, he has not\r\nthe slightest ground for any such assumption. I did not even refer, I\r\nthink, in my observations, to any collection of individuals. I said\r\nnothing of the recent conventions. I spoke in the most guarded and\r\ncareful manner, and only expressed my regret for the publication of\r\nopinions, which I presumed the honorable member disapproved as much as\r\nmyself. In this, it seems, I was mistaken. I do not remember that the\r\ngentleman has disclaimed any sentiment, or any opinion, of a supposed\r\nanti-union tendency, which on all or any of the recent occasions has\r\nbeen expressed. [21] The whole drift of his speech has been rather to\r\nprove, that, in divers times and manners, sentiments equally liable to\r\nmy objection have been avowed in New England. And one would suppose\r\nthat his object, in this reference to Massachusetts, was to find a\r\nprecedent to justify proceedings in the South, were it not for the\r\nreproach and contumely with which he labors, all along, to load these\r\nhis own chosen precedents. By way of defending South Carolina from what\r\nhe chooses to think an attack on her, he first quotes the example of\r\nMassachusetts, and then denounces that example in good set terms. This\r\ntwofold purpose, not very consistent, one would think, with itself, was\r\nexhibited more than once in the course of his speech. He referred, for\r\ninstance, to the Hartford Convention. Did he do this for authority, or\r\nfor a topic of reproach? Apparently for both, for he told us that he\r\nshould find no fault with the mere fact of holding such a convention,\r\nand considering and discussing such questions as he supposes were then\r\nand there discussed; but what rendered it obnoxious was its being held\r\nat the time, and under the circumstances of the country then existing.\r\nWe were in a war, he said, and the country needed all our aid; the hand\r\nof government required to be strengthened, not weakened; and patriotism\r\nshould have postponed such proceedings to another day. The thing\r\nitself, then, is a precedent; the time and manner of it only, a subject\r\nof censure.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I go much further, on this point, than the honorable member.\r\nSupposing, as the gentleman seems to do, that the Hartford Convention\r\nassembled for any such purpose as breaking up the Union, because they\r\nthought unconstitutional laws had been passed, or to consult on that\r\nsubject, or _to calculate the value of the Union_; supposing this to be\r\ntheir purpose, or any part of it, then I say the meeting itself was\r\ndisloyal, and was obnoxious to censure, whether held in time of peace\r\nor time of war, or under whatever circumstances. The material question\r\nis the _object_. Is dissolution the _object_? If it be, external\r\ncircumstances may make it a more or less aggravated case, but cannot\r\naffect the principle. I do not hold, therefore, Sir, that the Hartford\r\nConvention was pardonable, even to the extent of the gentleman's\r\nadmission, if its objects were really such as have been imputed to it.\r\nSir, there never was a time, under any degree of excitement, in which\r\nthe Hartford Convention, or any other convention, could have maintained\r\nitself one moment in New England, if assembled for any such purpose as\r\nthe gentleman says would have been an allowable purpose. To hold\r\nconventions to decide constitutional law! To try the binding validity\r\nof statutes by votes in a convention! Sir, the Hartford Convention, I\r\npresume, would not desire that the honorable gentleman should be their\r\ndefender or advocate, if he puts their case upon such untenable and\r\nextravagant grounds.\r\n\r\nThen, Sir, the gentleman has no fault to find with these recently\r\npromulgated South Carolina opinions. And certainly he need have none;\r\nfor his own sentiments, as now advanced, and advanced on reflection, as\r\nfar as I have been able to comprehend them, go the full length of all\r\nthese opinions. I propose, Sir, to say something on these, and to\r\nconsider how far they are just and constitutional. Before doing that,\r\nhowever, let me observe that the eulogium pronounced by the honorable\r\ngentleman on the character of the State of South Carolina, for her\r\nRevolutionary and other merits, meets my hearty concurrence. I shall\r\nnot acknowledge that the honorable member goes before me in regard for\r\nwhatever of distinguished talent, or distinguished character, South\r\nCarolina has produced. I claim part of the honor, I partake in the\r\npride, of her great names. I claim them for countrymen, one and all,\r\nthe Laurenses, the Rutledges, the Pinckneys, the Sumpters, the Marions,\r\nAmericans all, whose fame is no more to be hemmed in by State lines,\r\nthan their talents and patriotism were capable of being circumscribed\r\nwithin the same narrow limits. In their day and generation, they served\r\nand honored the country, and the whole country; and their renown is of\r\nthe treasures of the whole country. Him whose honored name the\r\ngentleman himself bears,--does he esteem me less capable of gratitude\r\nfor his patriotism, or sympathy for his sufferings, than if his eyes\r\nhad first opened upon the light of Massachusetts, instead of South\r\nCarolina? Sir, does he suppose it in his power to exhibit a Carolina\r\nname so bright as to produce envy in my bosom? No, Sir, increased\r\ngratification and delight, rather. I thank God, that, if I am gifted\r\nwith little of the spirit which is able to raise mortals to the skies,\r\nI have yet none, as I trust, of that other spirit, which would drag\r\nangels down. When I shall be found, Sir, in my place here in the\r\nSenate, or elsewhere, to sneer at public merit, because it happens to\r\nspring up beyond the little limits of my own State or neighborhood;\r\nwhen I refuse, for any such cause or for any cause, the homage due to\r\nAmerican talent, to elevated patriotism, to sincere devotion to liberty\r\nand the country; or, if I see an uncommon endowment of Heaven, if I see\r\nextraordinary capacity and virtue, in any son of the South, and if,\r\nmoved by local prejudice or gangrened by State jealousy, I get up here\r\nto abate the tithe of a hair from his just character and just fame, may\r\nmy tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!\r\n\r\nSir, let me recur to pleasing recollections; let me indulge in\r\nrefreshing remembrance of the past; let me remind you that, in early\r\ntimes, no States cherished greater harmony, both of principle and\r\nfeeling, than Massachusetts and South Carolina. Would to God that\r\nharmony might again return! Shoulder to shoulder they went through the\r\nRevolution, hand in hand they stood round the administration of\r\nWashington, and felt his own great arm lean on them for support. Unkind\r\nfeeling, if it exist, alienation, and distrust are the growth,\r\nunnatural to such soils, of false principles since sown. They are\r\nweeds, the seeds of which that same great arm never scattered.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I shall enter on no encomium upon Massachusetts; she\r\nneeds none. There she is. Behold her, and judge for yourselves. There\r\nis her history; the world knows it by heart. The past, at least, is\r\nsecure. There is Boston, and Concord, and Lexington, and Bunker Hill;\r\nand there they will remain for ever. The bones of her sons, falling in\r\nthe great struggle for Independence, now lie mingled with the soil of\r\nevery State from New England to Georgia; and there they will lie for\r\never. And, Sir, where American Liberty raised its first voice, and\r\nwhere its youth was nurtured and sustained, there it still lives, in\r\nthe strength of its manhood and full of its original spirit. If discord\r\nand disunion shall wound it, if party strife and blind ambition shall\r\nhawk at and tear it, if folly and madness, if uneasiness under salutary\r\nand necessary restraint, shall succeed in separating it from that\r\nUnion, by which alone its existence is made sure, it will stand, in the\r\nend, by the side of that cradle in which its infancy was rocked; it\r\nwill stretch forth its arm with whatever of vigor it may still retain\r\nover the friends who gather round it; and it will fall at last, if fall\r\nit must, amidst the proudest monuments of its own glory, and on the\r\nvery spot of its origin. [22]\r\n\r\nThere yet remains to be performed, Mr. President, by far the most grave\r\nand important duty, which I feel to be devolved on me by this occasion.\r\nIt is to state, and to defend, what I conceive to be the true\r\nprinciples of the Constitution under which we are here assembled. I\r\nmight well have desired that so weighty a task should have fallen into\r\nother and abler hands. I could have wished that it should have been\r\nexecuted by those whose character and experience give weight and\r\ninfluence to their opinions, such as cannot possibly belong to mine.\r\nBut, Sir, I have met the occasion, not sought it; and I shall proceed\r\nto state my own sentiments, without challenging for them any particular\r\nregard, with studied plainness, and as much precision as possible.\r\n\r\nI understand the honorable gentleman from South Carolina to maintain,\r\nthat it is a right of the State legislatures to interfere, whenever, in\r\ntheir judgment, this government transcends its constitutional limits,\r\nand to arrest the operation of its laws.\r\n\r\nI understand him to maintain this right, as a right existing _under_\r\nthe Constitution, not as a right to overthrow it on the ground of\r\nextreme necessity, such as would justify violent revolution.\r\n\r\nI understand him to maintain an authority, on the part of the States,\r\nthus to interfere, for the purpose of correcting the exercise of power\r\nby the general government, of checking it, and of compelling it to\r\nconform to their opinion of the extent of its powers.\r\n\r\nI understand him to maintain, that the ultimate power of judging of the\r\nconstitutional extent of its own authority is not lodged exclusively in\r\nthe general government, or any branch of it; but that, on the contrary,\r\nthe States may lawfully decide for themselves, and each State for\r\nitself, whether, in a given case, the act of the general government\r\ntranscends its power.\r\n\r\nI understand him to insist, that, if the exigency of the case, in the\r\nopinion of any State government, require it, such State government may,\r\nby its own sovereign authority, annul an act of the general government\r\nwhich it deems plainly and palpably unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nThis is the sum of what I understand from him to be the South Carolina\r\ndoctrine, and the doctrine which he maintains. I propose to consider\r\nit, and compare it with the Constitution. Allow me to say, as a\r\npreliminary remark, that I call this the South Carolina doctrine only\r\nbecause the gentleman himself has so denominated it. I do not feel at\r\nliberty to say that South Carolina, as a State, has ever advanced these\r\nsentiments. I hope she has not, and never may. That a great majority of\r\nher people are opposed to the tariff laws, is doubtless true. That a\r\nmajority, somewhat less than that just mentioned, conscientiously\r\nbelieve these laws unconstitutional, may probably also be true. But\r\nthat any majority holds to the right of direct State interference at\r\nState discretion, the right of nullifying acts of Congress by acts of\r\nState legislation, is more than I know, and what I shall be slow to\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nThat there are individuals besides the honorable gentleman who do\r\nmaintain these opinions, is quite certain. I recollect the recent\r\nexpression of a sentiment, which circumstances attending its utterance\r\nand publication justify us in supposing was not unpremeditated. \"The\r\nsovereignty of the State,--never to be controlled, construed, or\r\ndecided on, but by her own feelings of honorable justice.\" [23]\r\n\r\nWe all know that civil institutions are established for the public\r\nbenefit, and that when they cease to answer the ends of their existence\r\nthey may be changed. But I do not understand the doctrine now contended\r\nfor to be that, which, for the sake of distinction, we may call the\r\nright of revolution. I understand the gentleman to maintain, that it is\r\nconstitutional to interrupt the administration of the Constitution\r\nitself, in the hands of those who are chosen and sworn to administer\r\nit, by the direct interference, in form of law, of the States, in\r\nvirtue of their sovereign capacity. The inherent right in the people to\r\nreform their government I do not deny; and they have another right, and\r\nthat is, to resist unconstitutional laws, without overturning the\r\ngovernment. It is no doctrine of mine that unconstitutional laws bind\r\nthe people. The great question is, Whose prerogative is it to decide on\r\nthe constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the laws? On that, the\r\nmain debate hinges. The proposition, that, in case of a supposed\r\nviolation of the Constitution by Congress, the States have a\r\nconstitutional right to interfere and annul the law of Congress, is the\r\nproposition of the gentleman. I do not admit it. If the gentleman had\r\nintended no more than to assert the right of revolution for justifiable\r\ncause, he would have said only what all agree to. But I cannot conceive\r\nthat there can be a middle course, between submission to the laws, when\r\nregularly pronounced constitutional, on the one hand, and open\r\nresistance, which is revolution or rebellion, on the other.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to inquire into the origin of this government and the\r\nsource of its power. Whose agent is it? Is it the creature of the State\r\nlegislatures, or the creature of the people? If the government of the\r\nUnited States be the agent of the State governments, then they may\r\ncontrol it, provided they can agree in the manner of controlling it; if\r\nit be the agent of the people, then the people alone can control it,\r\nrestrain it, modify, or reform it. It is observable enough, that the\r\ndoctrine for which the honorable gentleman contends leads him to the\r\nnecessity of maintaining, not only that this general government is the\r\ncreature of the States, but that it is the creature of each of the\r\nStates severally, so that each may assert the power for itself of\r\ndetermining whether it acts within the limits of its authority. It is\r\nthe servant of four-and-twenty masters, of different wills and\r\ndifferent purposes, and yet bound to obey all. This absurdity (for it\r\nseems no less) arises from a misconception as to the origin of this\r\ngovernment and its true character. It is, Sir, the people's\r\nConstitution, the people's government, made for the people, made by the\r\npeople, and answerable to the people. The people of the United States\r\nhave declared that this Constitution shall be the supreme law. We must\r\neither admit the proposition, or dispute their authority. The States\r\nare, unquestionably, sovereign, so far as their sovereignty is not\r\naffected by the supreme law. But the State legislatures, as political\r\nbodies, however sovereign, are yet not sovereign over the people. So\r\nfar as the people have given power to the general government, so far\r\nthe grant is unquestionably good, and the government holds of the\r\npeople, and not of the State governments. We are all agents of the same\r\nsupreme power, the people. The general government and the State\r\ngovernments derive their authority from the same source. Neither can,\r\nin relation to the other, be called primary, though one is definite and\r\nrestricted, and the other general and residuary. The national\r\ngovernment possesses those powers which it can be shown the people have\r\nconferred on it, and no more. All the rest belongs to the State\r\ngovernments, or to the people themselves. So far as the people have\r\nrestrained State sovereignty, by the expression of their will, in the\r\nConstitution of the United States, so far, it must be admitted, State\r\nsovereignty is effectually controlled. I do not contend that it is, or\r\nought to be, controlled farther. The sentiment to which I have referred\r\npropounds that State sovereignty is only to be controlled by its own\r\n\"feeling of justice\"; that is to say, it is not to be controlled at\r\nall, for one who is to follow his own feelings is under no legal\r\ncontrol. Now, however men may think this ought to be, the fact is, that\r\nthe people of the United States have chosen to impose control on State\r\nsovereignties. There are those, doubtless, who wish they had been left\r\nwithout restraint; but the Constitution has ordered the matter\r\ndifferently. To make war, for instance, is an exercise of sovereignty;\r\nbut the Constitution declares that no State shall make war. To coin\r\nmoney is another exercise of sovereign power; but no State is at\r\nliberty to coin money. Again, the Constitution says that no sovereign\r\nState shall be so sovereign as to make a treaty. These prohibitions, it\r\nmust be confessed, are a control on the State sovereignty of South\r\nCarolina, as well as of the other States, which does not arise \"from\r\nher own feelings of honorable justice.\" The opinion referred to,\r\ntherefore, is in defiance of the plainest provisions of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThere are other proceedings of public bodies which have already been\r\nalluded to, and to which I refer again for the purpose of ascertaining\r\nmore fully what is the length and breadth of that doctrine, denominated\r\nthe Carolina doctrine, which the honorable member has now stood up on\r\nthis floor to maintain. In one of them I find it resolved, that \"the\r\ntariff of 1828, and every other tariff designed to promote one branch\r\nof industry at the expense of others, is contrary to the meaning and\r\nintention of the federal compact; and such a dangerous, palpable, and\r\ndeliberate usurpation of power, by a determined majority, wielding the\r\ngeneral government beyond the limits of its delegated powers, as calls\r\nupon the States which compose the suffering minority, in their\r\nsovereign capacity, to exercise the powers which, as sovereigns,\r\nnecessarily devolve upon them, when their compact is violated.\"\r\n\r\nObserve, Sir, that this resolution holds the tariff of 1828, and every\r\nother tariff designed to promote one branch of industry at the expense\r\nof another, to be such a dangerous, palpable, and deliberate usurpation\r\nof power, as calls upon the States, in their sovereign capacity, to\r\ninterfere by their own authority. This denunciation, Mr. President, you\r\nwill please to observe, includes our old tariff of 1816, as well as all\r\nothers; because that was established to promote the interest of the\r\nmanufacturers of cotton, to the manifest and admitted injury of the\r\nCalcutta cotton trade. Observe, again, that all the qualifications are\r\nhere rehearsed and charged upon the tariff, which are necessary to\r\nbring the case within the gentleman's proposition. The tariff is a\r\nusurpation; it is a dangerous usurpation; it is a palpable usurpation;\r\nit is a deliberate usurpation. It is such a usurpation, therefore, as\r\ncalls upon the States to exercise their right of interference. Here is\r\na case, then, within the gentleman's principles, and all his\r\nqualifications of his principles. It is a case for action. The\r\nConstitution is plainly, dangerously, palpably, and deliberately\r\nviolated; and the States must interpose their own authority to arrest\r\nthe law. Let us suppose the State of South Carolina to express this\r\nsame opinion, by the voice of her legislature. That would be very\r\nimposing; but what then? Is the voice of one State conclusive? It so\r\nhappens that, at the very moment when South Carolina resolves that the\r\ntariff laws are unconstitutional, Pennsylvania and Kentucky resolve\r\nexactly the reverse. _They_ hold those laws to be both highly proper\r\nand strictly constitutional. And now, Sir, how does the honorable\r\nmember propose to deal with this case? How does he relieve us from this\r\ndifficulty, upon any principle of his? His construction gets us into\r\nit; how does he propose to get us out?\r\n\r\nIn Carolina, the tariff is a palpable, deliberate usurpation; Carolina,\r\ntherefore, may nullify it, and refuse to pay the duties. In\r\nPennsylvania, it is both clearly constitutional and highly expedient;\r\nand there the duties are to be paid. And yet we live under a government\r\nof uniform laws, and under a Constitution too, which contains an\r\nexpress provision, as it happens, that all duties shall be equal in all\r\nthe States. Does not this approach absurdity?\r\n\r\nIf there be no power to settle such questions, independent of either of\r\nthe States, is not the whole Union a rope of sand? Are we not thrown\r\nback again, precisely, upon the old Confederation?\r\n\r\nIt is too plain to be argued. Four-and-twenty interpreters of\r\nconstitutional law, each with a power to decide for itself, and none\r\nwith authority to bind anybody else, and this constitutional law the\r\nonly bond of their union! What is such a state of things but a mere\r\nconnection during pleasure, or, to use the phraseology of the times,\r\n_during feeling_? And that feeling, too, not the feeling of the people,\r\nwho established the Constitution, but the feeling of the State\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nIn another of the South Carolina addresses, having premised that the\r\ncrisis requires \"all the concentrated energy of passion,\" an attitude\r\nof open resistance to the laws of the Union is advised. Open resistance\r\nto the laws, then, is the constitutional remedy, the conservative power\r\nof the State, which the South Carolina doctrines teach for the redress\r\nof political evils, real or imaginary. And its authors further say,\r\nthat, appealing with confidence to the Constitution itself, to justify\r\ntheir opinions, they cannot consent to try their accuracy by the courts\r\nof justice. In one sense, indeed, Sir, this is assuming an attitude of\r\nopen resistance in favor of liberty. But what sort of liberty? The\r\nliberty of establishing their own opinions, in defiance of the opinions\r\nof all others; the liberty of judging and of deciding exclusively\r\nthemselves, in a matter in which others have as much right to judge and\r\ndecide as they; the liberty of placing their own opinions above the\r\njudgment of all others, above the laws, and above the Constitution.\r\nThis is their liberty, and this is the fair result of the proposition\r\ncontended for by the honorable gentleman. Or, it may be more properly\r\nsaid, it is identical with it, rather than a result from it.\r\n\r\nResolutions, Sir, have been recently passed by the legislature of South\r\nCarolina. I need not refer to them; they go no farther than the\r\nhonorable gentleman himself has gone, and I hope not so far. I content\r\nmyself, therefore, with debating the matter with him.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, what I have first to say on this subject is, that at no\r\ntime, and under no circumstances, has New England, or any State in New\r\nEngland, or any respectable body of persons in New England, or any\r\npublic man of standing in New England, put forth such a doctrine as\r\nthis Carolina doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman has found no case, he can find none, to support his own\r\nopinions by New England authority. New England has studied the\r\nConstitution in other schools, and under other teachers. She looks upon\r\nit with other regards, and deems more highly and reverently both of its\r\njust authority and its utility and excellence. The history of her\r\nlegislative proceedings may be traced. The ephemeral effusions of\r\ntemporary bodies, called together by the excitement of the occasion,\r\nmay be hunted up; they have been hunted up. The opinions and votes of\r\nher public men, in and out of Congress, may be explored. It will all be\r\nin vain. The Carolina doctrine can derive from her neither countenance\r\nnor support. She rejects it now; she always did reject it; and till she\r\nloses her senses, she always will reject it. The honorable member has\r\nreferred to expressions on the subject of the embargo law, made in this\r\nplace, by an honorable and venerable gentleman, now favoring us with\r\nhis presence. [24] He quotes that distinguished Senator as saying,\r\nthat, in his judgment, the embargo law was unconstitutional, and that\r\ntherefore, in his opinion, the people were not bound to obey it. That,\r\nSir, is perfectly constitutional language. An unconstitutional law is\r\nnot binding; _but then it does not rest with a resolution or a law of a\r\nState legislature to decide whether an act of Congress be or be not\r\nconstitutional_. An unconstitutional act of Congress would not bind the\r\npeople of this District, although they have no legislature to interfere\r\nin their behalf; and, on the other hand, a constitutional law of\r\nCongress does bind the citizens of every State, although all their\r\nlegislatures should undertake to annul it by act or resolution. The\r\nvenerable Connecticut Senator is a constitutional lawyer, of sound\r\nprinciples and enlarged knowledge; a statesman practised and\r\nexperienced, bred in the company of Washington, and holding just views\r\nupon the nature of our governments. He believed the embargo\r\nunconstitutional, and so did others; but what then? Who did he suppose\r\nwas to decide that question? The State legislatures? Certainly not. No\r\nsuch sentiment ever escaped his lips.\r\n\r\nLet us follow up, Sir, this New England opposition to the embargo laws;\r\nlet us trace it, till we discern the principle which controlled and\r\ngoverned New England throughout the whole course of that opposition. We\r\nshall then see what similarity there is between the New England school\r\nof constitutional opinions, and this modern Carolina school. The\r\ngentleman, I think, read a petition from some single individual\r\naddressed to the legislature of Massachusetts, asserting the Carolina\r\ndoctrine; that is, the right of State interference to arrest the laws\r\nof the Union. The fate of that petition shows the sentiment of the\r\nlegislature. It met no favor. The opinions of Massachusetts were very\r\ndifferent. They had been expressed in 1798, in answer to the\r\nresolutions of Virginia, and she did not depart from them, nor bend\r\nthem to the times. Misgoverned, wronged, oppressed, as she felt herself\r\nto be, she still held fast her integrity to the Union. The gentleman\r\nmay find in her proceedings much evidence of dissatisfaction with the\r\nmeasures of government, and great and deep dislike to the embargo; all\r\nthis makes the case so much the stronger for her; for, notwithstanding\r\nall this dissatisfaction and dislike, she still claimed no right to\r\nsever the bonds of the Union. There was heat, and there was anger in\r\nher political feeling. Be it so; but neither her heat nor her anger\r\nbetrayed, her into infidelity to the government. The gentleman labors\r\nto prove that she disliked the embargo as much as South Carolina\r\ndislikes the tariff, and expressed her dislike as strongly. Be it so;\r\nbut did she propose the Carolina remedy? did she threaten to interfere,\r\nby State authority, to annul the laws of the Union? That is the\r\nquestion for the gentleman's consideration.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, Sir, a great majority of the people of New England\r\nconscientiously believed the embargo law of 1807 unconstitutional; [25]\r\nas conscientiously, certainly, as the people of South Carolina hold\r\nthat opinion of the tariff. They reasoned thus: Congress has power to\r\nregulate commerce; but here is a law, they said, stopping all commerce,\r\nand stopping it indefinitely. The law is perpetual; that is, it is not\r\nlimited in point of time, and must of course continue until it shall be\r\nrepealed by some other law. It is as perpetual, therefore, as the law\r\nagainst treason or murder. Now, is this regulating commerce, or\r\ndestroying it? Is it guiding, controlling, giving the rule to commerce,\r\nas a subsisting thing or is it putting an end to it altogether? Nothing\r\nis more certain, than that a majority in New England deemed this law a\r\nviolation of the Constitution. The very case required by the gentleman\r\nto justify State interference had then arisen. Massachusetts believed\r\nthis law to be \"a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of a\r\npower not granted by the Constitution.\" Deliberate it was, for it was\r\nlong continued; palpable she thought it, as no words in the\r\nConstitution gave the power, and only a construction, in her opinion\r\nmost violent, raised it; dangerous it was, since it threatened utter\r\nruin to her most important interests. Here, then, was a Carolina case.\r\nHow did Massachusetts deal with it? It was, as she thought, a plain,\r\nmanifest, palpable violation of the Constitution, and it brought ruin\r\nto her doors. Thousands of families, and hundreds of thousands of\r\nindividuals, were beggared by it. While she saw and felt all this, she\r\nsaw and felt also, that, as a measure of national policy, it was\r\nperfectly futile; that the country was no way benefited by that which\r\ncaused so much individual distress; that it was efficient only for the\r\nproduction of evil, and all that evil inflicted on ourselves. In such a\r\ncase, under such circumstances, how did Massachusetts demean herself?\r\nSir, she remonstrated, she memorialized, she addressed herself to the\r\ngeneral government, not exactly \"with the concentrated energy of\r\npassion,\" but with her own strong sense, and the energy of sober\r\nconviction. But she did not interpose the arm of her own power to\r\narrest the law, and break the embargo. Far from it. Her principles\r\nbound her to two things; and she followed her principles, lead where\r\nthey might. First, to submit to every constitutional law of Congress,\r\nand secondly, if the constitutional validity of the law be doubted, to\r\nrefer that question to the decision of the proper tribunals. The first\r\nprinciple is vain and ineffectual without the second. A majority of us\r\nin New England believed the embargo law unconstitutional; but the great\r\nquestion was, and always will be in such cases, Who is to decide this?\r\nWho is to judge between the people and the government? And, Sir, it is\r\nquite plain, that the Constitution of the United States confers on the\r\ngovernment itself, to be exercised by its appropriate department, and\r\nunder its own responsibility to the people, this power of deciding\r\nultimately and conclusively upon the just extent of its own authority.\r\nIf this had not been done, we should not have advanced a single step\r\nbeyond the old Confederation.\r\n\r\nBeing fully of the opinion that the embargo law was unconstitutional,\r\nthe people of New England were yet equally clear in the opinion, (it\r\nwas a matter they did doubt upon,) that the question, after all, must\r\nbe decided by the judicial tribunals of the United States. Before those\r\ntribunals, therefore, they brought the question. Under the provisions\r\nof the law, they had given bonds to millions in amount, and which were\r\nalleged to be forfeited. They suffered the bonds to be sued, and thus\r\nraised the question. In the old-fashioned way of settling disputes,\r\nthey went to law. The case came to hearing and solemn argument; and he\r\nwho espoused their cause, and stood up for them against the validity of\r\nthe embargo act, was none other than that great man, of whom the\r\ngentleman has made honorable mention, Samuel Dexter. He was then, Sir,\r\nin the fulness of his knowledge, and the maturity of his strength. He\r\nhad retired from long and distinguished public service here, to the\r\nrenewed pursuit of professional duties, carrying with him all that\r\nenlargement and expansion, all the new strength and force, which an\r\nacquaintance with the more general subjects discussed in the national\r\ncouncils is capable of adding to professional attainment, in a mind of\r\ntrue greatness and comprehension. He was a lawyer, and he was also a\r\nstatesman. He had studied the Constitution, when he filled public\r\nstation, that he might defend it; he had examined its principles that\r\nhe might maintain them. More than all men, or at least as much as any\r\nman, he was attached to the general government and to the union of the\r\nStates. His feelings and opinions all ran in that direction. A question\r\nof constitutional law, too, was, of all subjects, that one which was\r\nbest suited to his talents and learning. Aloof from technicality, and\r\nunfettered by artificial rule, such a question gave opportunity for\r\nthat deep and clear analysis, that mighty grasp of principle, which so\r\nmuch distinguished his higher efforts. His very statement was argument;\r\nhis inference seemed demonstration. The earnestness of his own\r\nconviction wrought conviction in others. One was convinced, and\r\nbelieved, and assented, because it was gratifying, delightful, to\r\nthink, and feel, and believe, in unison with an intellect of such\r\nevident superiority.\r\n\r\nMr. Dexter, Sir, such as I have described him, argued the New England\r\ncause. He put into his effort his whole heart, as well as all the\r\npowers of his understanding; for he had avowed, in the most public\r\nmanner, his entire concurrence with his neighbors on the point in\r\ndispute. He argued the cause; it was lost, and New England submitted.\r\nThe established tribunals pronounced the law constitutional, and New\r\nEngland acquiesced. Now, Sir, is not this the exact opposite of the\r\ndoctrine of the gentleman from South Carolina? According to him,\r\ninstead of referring to the judicial tribunals, we should have broken\r\nup the embargo by laws of our own; we should have repealed it, _quoad_\r\nNew England; for we had a strong, palpable, and oppressive case. Sir,\r\nwe believed the embargo unconstitutional; but still that was matter of\r\nopinion, and who was to decide it? We thought it a clear case; but,\r\nnevertheless, we did not take the law into our own hands, because we\r\ndid not wish to bring about a revolution, nor to break up the Union;\r\nfor I maintain, that between submission to the decision of the\r\nconstituted tribunals, and revolution, or disunion, there is no middle\r\nground; there is no ambiguous condition, half allegiance and half\r\nrebellion. And, Sir, how futile, how very futile it is, to admit the\r\nright of State interference, and then attempt to save it from the\r\ncharacter of unlawful resistance, by adding terms of qualification to\r\nthe causes and occasions, leaving all these qualifications, like the\r\ncase itself, in the discretion of the State governments. It must be a\r\nclear case, it is said, a deliberate case, a palpable case, a dangerous\r\ncase. But then the State is still left at liberty to decide for herself\r\nwhat is clear, what is deliberate, what is palpable, what is dangerous.\r\nDo adjectives and epithets avail any thing?\r\n\r\nSir, the human mind is so constituted, that the merits of both sides of\r\na controversy appear very clear, and very palpable, to those who\r\nrespectively espouse them; and both sides usually grow clearer as the\r\ncontroversy advances. South Carolina sees unconstitutionality in the\r\ntariff; she sees oppression there also, and she sees danger.\r\nPennsylvania, with a vision not less sharp, looks at the same tariff,\r\nand sees no such thing in it; she sees it all constitutional, all\r\nuseful, all safe. The faith of South Carolina is strengthened by\r\nopposition, and she now not only sees, but _resolves_, that the tariff\r\nis palpably unconstitutional, oppressive, and dangerous; but\r\nPennsylvania, not to be behind her neighbors, and equally willing to\r\nstrengthen her own faith by a confident asseveration, _resolves_, also,\r\nand gives to every warm affirmative of South Carolina, a plain,\r\ndownright, Pennsylvania negative. South Carolina, to show the strength\r\nand unity of her opinion, brings her assembly to a unanimity, within\r\nseven voices; Pennsylvania, not to be outdone in this respect any more\r\nthan in others, reduces her dissentient fraction to a single vote. Now,\r\nSir, again, I ask the gentleman, What is to be done? Are these States\r\nboth right? Is he bound to consider them both right? If not, which is\r\nin the wrong? or rather, which has the best right to decide? And if he,\r\nand if I, are not to know what the Constitution means, and what it is,\r\ntill those two State legislatures, and the twenty-two others, shall\r\nagree in its construction, what have we sworn to, when we have sworn to\r\nmaintain it? I was forcibly struck, Sir, with one reflection, as the\r\ngentleman went on in his speech. He quoted Mr. Madison's resolutions,\r\nto prove that a State may interfere, in a case of deliberate, palpable,\r\nand dangerous exercise of a power not granted. The honorable member\r\nsupposes the tariff law to be such an exercise of power; and that\r\nconsequently a case has arisen in which the State may, if it see fit,\r\ninterfere by its own law. Now it so happens, nevertheless, that Mr.\r\nMadison deems this same tariff law quite constitutional. Instead of a\r\nclear and palpable violation, it is, in his judgment, no violation at\r\nall. So that, while they use his authority for a hypothetical case,\r\nthey reject it in the very case before them. All this, Sir, shows the\r\ninherent futility, I had almost used a stronger word, of conceding this\r\npower of inference to the State, and then attempting to secure it from\r\nabuse by imposing qualifications of which the States themselves are to\r\njudge. One of two things is true; either the laws of the Union are\r\nbeyond the discretion and beyond the control of the States; or else we\r\nhave no constitution of general government, and are thrust back again\r\nto the days of the Confederation.\r\n\r\nLet me here say, Sir, that if the gentleman's doctrine had been\r\nreceived and acted upon in New England, in the times of the embargo and\r\nnon-intercourse, we should probably not now have been here. The\r\ngovernment would very likely have gone to pieces, and crumbled into\r\ndust. No stronger case can ever arise than existed under those laws; no\r\nStates can ever entertain a clearer conviction than the New England\r\nStates then entertained; and if they had been under the influence of\r\nthat heresy of opinion, as I must call it, which the honorable member\r\nespouses, this Union would, in all probability, have been scattered to\r\nthe four winds. I ask the gentleman, therefore, to apply his principles\r\nto that case; I ask him to come forth and declare, whether, in his\r\nopinion, the New England States would have been justified in\r\ninterfering to break up the embargo system under the conscientious\r\nopinions which they held upon it? Had they a right to annul that law?\r\nDoes he admit or deny? If what is thought palpably unconstitutional in\r\nSouth Carolina justifies that State in arresting the progress of the\r\nlaw, tell me whether that which was thought palpably unconstitutional\r\nalso in Massachusetts would have justified her in doing the same thing?\r\nSir, I deny the whole doctrine. It has not a foot of ground in the\r\nConstitution to stand on. No public man of reputation ever advanced it\r\nin Massachusetts in the warmest times, or could maintain himself upon\r\nit there at any time.\r\n\r\nI must now beg to ask, Sir, Whence is this supposed right of the States\r\nderived? Where do they find the power to interfere with the laws of the\r\nUnion? Sir, the opinion which the honorable gentleman maintains is a\r\nnotion founded in a total misapprehension, in my judgment, of the\r\norigin of this government, and of the foundation on which it stands. I\r\nhold it to be a popular government, erected by the people; those who\r\nadminister it, responsible to the people; and itself capable of being\r\namended and modified, just as the people may choose it should be. It is\r\nas popular, just as truly emanating from the people, as the State\r\ngovernments. It is created for one purpose; the State governments for\r\nanother. It has its own powers; they have theirs. There is no more\r\nauthority with them to arrest the operation of a law of Congress, than\r\nwith Congress to arrest the operation of their laws. We are here to\r\nadminister a Constitution emanating immediately from the people, and\r\ntrusted by them to our administration. It is not the creature of the\r\nState governments. It is of no moment to the argument, that certain\r\nacts of the State legislatures are necessary to fill our seats in this\r\nbody. That is not one of their original State powers, a part of the\r\nsovereignty of the State. It is a duty which the people, by the\r\nConstitution itself, have imposed on the State legislatures; and which\r\nthey might have left to be performed elsewhere, if they had seen fit.\r\nSo they have left the choice of President with electors; but all this\r\ndoes not affect the proposition that this whole government, President,\r\nSenate, and House of Representatives, is a popular government. It\r\nleaves it still all its popular character. The governor of a State (in\r\nsome of the States) is chosen, not directly by the people, but by those\r\nwho are chosen by the people, for the purpose of performing, among\r\nother duties, that of electing a governor. Is the government of the\r\nState, on that account, not a popular government? This government, Sir,\r\nis the independent offspring of the popular will. It is not the\r\ncreature of State legislatures; nay, more, if the whole truth must be\r\ntold, the people brought it into existence, established it, and have\r\nhitherto supported it, for the very purpose, amongst others, of\r\nimposing certain salutary restraints on State sovereignties. The States\r\ncannot now make war; they cannot contract alliances; they cannot make,\r\neach for itself, separate regulations of commerce; they cannot lay\r\nimposts; they cannot coin money. If this Constitution, Sir, be the\r\ncreature of State legislatures, it must be admitted that it has\r\nobtained a strange control over the volitions of its creators.\r\n\r\nThe people, then, Sir, erected this government. They gave it a\r\nConstitution, and in that Constitution they have enumerated the powers\r\nwhich they bestow on it. They have made it a limited government. They\r\nhave defined its authority. They have restrained it to the exercise of\r\nsuch powers as are granted; and all others, they declare, are reserved\r\nto the States or the people. But, Sir, they have not stopped here. If\r\nthey had, they would have accomplished but half their work. No\r\ndefinition can be so clear, as to avoid possibility of doubt; no\r\nlimitation so precise as to exclude all uncertainty. Who, then, shall\r\nconstrue this grant of the people? Who shall interpret their will,\r\nwhere it may be supposed they have left it doubtful? With whom do they\r\nrepose this ultimate right of deciding on the powers of the government?\r\nSir, they have settled all this in the fullest manner. They have left\r\nit with the government itself, in its appropriate branches. Sir, the\r\nvery chief end, the main design, for which the whole Constitution was\r\nframed and adopted, was to establish a government that should not be\r\nobliged to act through State agency, or depend on State opinion and\r\nState discretion. The people had had quite enough of that kind of\r\ngovernment under the Confederation. Under that system, the legal\r\naction, the application of law to individuals, belonged exclusively to\r\nthe States. Congress could only recommend; their acts were not of\r\nbinding force, till the States had adopted and sanctioned them. Are we\r\nin that condition still? Are we yet at the mercy of State discretion\r\nand State construction? Sir, if we are, then vain will be our attempt\r\nto maintain the Constitution under which we sit.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, the people have wisely provided, in the Constitution itself,\r\na proper, suitable mode and tribunal for settling questions of\r\nconstitutional law. There are in the Constitution grants of powers to\r\nCongress, and restrictions on these powers. There are, also,\r\nprohibitions on the States. Some authority must, therefore, necessarily\r\nexist, having the ultimate jurisdiction to fix and ascertain the\r\ninterpretation of these grants, restrictions, and prohibitions. The\r\nConstitution has itself pointed out, ordained, and established that\r\nauthority. How has it accomplished this great and essential end? By\r\ndeclaring, Sir, that \"_the Constitution, and the laws of the United\r\nStates made in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the land,\r\nanything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding_.\"\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, was the first great step. By this the supremacy of the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States is declared. The people so\r\nwill it. No State law is to be valid which comes in conflict with the\r\nConstitution, or any law of the United States passed in pursuance of\r\nit. But who shall decide this question of interference? To whom lies\r\nthe last appeal? This, Sir, the Constitution itself decides also, 25 by\r\ndeclaring, \"_that the judicial power shall extend to all cases arising\r\nunder the Constitution and laws of the United States_.\" These two\r\nprovisions cover the whole ground. They are, in truth, the keystone of\r\nthe arch! With these it is a government; without them it is a\r\nconfederation. In pursuance of these clear and express provisions,\r\nCongress established, at its very first session, in the judicial act, a\r\nmode for carrying them into full effect, and for bringing all questions\r\nof constitutional power to the final decision of the Supreme Court. It\r\nthen, Sir, became a government. It then had the means of\r\nself-protection; and but for this, it would, in all probability, have\r\nbeen now among things which are past. Having constituted the\r\ngovernment, and declared its powers, the people have further said,\r\nthat, since somebody must decide on the extent of these powers, the\r\ngovernment shall itself decide; subject, always, like other popular\r\ngovernments, to its responsibility to the people. And now, Sir, I\r\nrepeat, how is it that a State legislature acquires any power to\r\ninterfere? Who, or what, gives them the right to say to the people,\r\n\"We, who are your agents and servants for one purpose, will undertake\r\nto decide, that your other agents and servants, appointed by you for\r\nanother purpose, have transcended the authority you gave them!\" The\r\nreply would be, I think, not impertinent, \"Who made you a judge over\r\nanother's servants? To their own masters they stand or fall.\"\r\n\r\nSir, I deny this power of State legislatures altogether. It cannot\r\nstand the test of examination. Gentlemen may say, that, in an extreme\r\ncase, a State government might protect the people from intolerable\r\noppression. Sir, in such a case, the people might protect themselves,\r\nwithout the aid of the State governments. Such a case warrants\r\nrevolution. It must make, when it comes, a law for itself. A nullifying\r\nact of a State legislature cannot alter the case, nor make resistance\r\nany more lawful. In maintaining these sentiments, Sir, I am but\r\nasserting the rights of the people. I state what they have declared,\r\nand insist on their right to declare it. They have chosen to repose\r\nthis power in the general government, and I think it my duty to support\r\nit, like other constitutional powers.\r\n\r\nFor myself, Sir, I do not admit the competency of South Carolina, or\r\nany other State, to prescribe my constitutional duty; or to settle,\r\nbetween me and the people, the validity of laws of Congress for which I\r\nhave voted. I decline her umpirage. I have not sworn to support the\r\nConstitution according to her construction of its clauses. I have not\r\nstipulated, by my oath of office or otherwise, to come under any\r\nresponsibility, except to the people, and those whom they have\r\nappointed to pass upon the question, whether laws, supported by my\r\nvotes, conform to the Constitution of the country. And, Sir, if we look\r\nto the general nature of the case, could anything have been more\r\npreposterous, than to make a government for the whole Union, and yet\r\nleave its powers subject, not to one interpretation, but to thirteen or\r\ntwenty-four interpretations? Instead of one tribunal, established by\r\nall, responsible to all, with power to decide for all, shall\r\nconstitutional questions be left to four-and-twenty popular bodies,\r\neach at liberty to decide for itself, and none bound to respect the\r\ndecisions of others,--and each at liberty, too, to give a new\r\nconstruction on every new election of its own members? Would anything,\r\nwith such a principle in it, or rather with such a destitution of all\r\nprinciple, be fit to be called a government? No, Sir. It should not be\r\ndenominated a Constitution. It should be called, rather, a collection\r\nof topics for everlasting controversy; heads of debate for a\r\ndisputatious people. It would not be a government. It would not be\r\nadequate to any practical good, or fit for any country to live under.\r\n\r\nTo avoid all possibility of being misunderstood, allow me to repeat\r\nagain, in the fullest manner, that I claim no powers for the government\r\nby forced or unfair construction. I admit that it is a government of\r\nstrictly limited powers; of enumerated, specified, and particularized\r\npowers; and that whatsoever is not granted, is withheld. But\r\nnotwithstanding all this, and however the grant of powers may be\r\nexpressed, its limit and extent may yet, in some cases, admit of doubt;\r\nand the general government would be good for nothing, it would be\r\nincapable of long existing, if some mode had not been provided in which\r\nthose doubts, as they should arise, might be peaceably, but\r\nauthoritatively, solved.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. President, let me run the honorable gentleman's doctrine a\r\nlittle into its practical application. Let us look at his probable\r\n_modus operandi_. If a thing can be done, an ingenious man can tell how\r\nit is to be done, and I wish to be informed how this State interference\r\nis to be put in practice, without violence, bloodshed, and rebellion.\r\nWe will take the existing case of the tariff law. South Carolina is\r\nsaid to have made up her opinion upon it. If we do not repeal it, (as\r\nwe probably shall not,) she will then apply to the case the remedy of\r\nher doctrine. She will, we must suppose, pass a law of her legislature,\r\ndeclaring the several acts of Congress usually called the tariff laws\r\nnull and void, so far as they respect South Carolina, or the citizens\r\nthereof. So far, all is a paper transaction, and easy enough. But the\r\ncollector at Charleston is collecting the duties imposed by these\r\ntariff laws. He, therefore, must be stopped. The collector will seize\r\nthe goods if the tariff duties are not paid. The State authorities will\r\nundertake their rescue, the marshal, with his posse, will come to the\r\ncollector's aid, and here the contest begins. The militia of the State\r\nwill be called out to sustain the nullifying act. They will march, Sir,\r\nunder a very gallant leader; for I believe the honorable member himself\r\ncommands the militia of that part of the State. He will raise the\r\nNULLIFYING ACT on his standard, and spread it out as his banner! It\r\nwill have a preamble, setting forth that the tariff laws are palpable,\r\ndeliberate, and dangerous violations of the Constitution! He will\r\nproceed, with this banner flying, to the custom-house in Charleston,\r\n\r\n  \"All the while\r\n   Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds.\" [26]\r\n\r\nArrived at the custom-house, he will tell the collector that he must\r\ncollect no more duties under any of the tariff laws. This he will be\r\nsomewhat puzzled to say, by the way, with a grave countenance,\r\nconsidering what hand South Carolina herself had in that of 1816. But,\r\nSir, the collector would not, probably, desist, at his bidding. He\r\nwould show him the law of Congress, the treasury instruction, and his\r\nown oath of office. He would say, he should perform his duty, come what\r\ncome might.\r\n\r\nHere would ensue a pause; for they say that a certain stillness\r\nprecedes the tempest. The trumpeter would hold his breath awhile, and\r\nbefore all this military array should fall on the custom-house,\r\ncollector, clerks, and all, it is very probable some of those composing\r\nit would request of their gallant commander-in-chief to be informed a\r\nlittle upon the point of law; for they have, doubtless, a just respect\r\nfor his opinions as a lawyer, as well as for his bravery as a soldier.\r\nThey know he has read Blackstone and the Constitution, as well as\r\nTurenne and Vauban. They would ask him, therefore, something concerning\r\ntheir rights in this matter. They would inquire, whether it was not\r\nsomewhat dangerous to resist a law of the United States. What would be\r\nthe nature of their offence, they would wish to learn, if they, by\r\nmilitary force and array, resisted the execution in Carolina of a law\r\nof the United States, and it should turn out, after all, that the law\r\n_was constitutional_? He would answer, of course, Treason. No lawyer\r\ncould give any other answer. John Fries,[27] he would tell them, had\r\nlearned that, some years ago. How, then, they would ask, do you propose\r\nto defend us? We are not afraid of bullets, but treason has a way of\r\ntaking people off that we do not much relish. How do you propose to\r\ndefend us? \"Look at my floating banner,\" he would reply; \"see there the\r\n_nullifying law!_\" Is it your opinion, gallant commander, they would\r\nthen say, that, if we should be indicted for treason, that same\r\nfloating banner of yours would make a good plea in bar? \"South Carolina\r\nis a sovereign state,\" he would reply. That is true; but would the\r\njudge admit our plea? \"These tariff laws,\" he would repeat, \"are\r\nunconstitutional, palpably, deliberately, dangerously.\" That may all be\r\nso; but if the tribunal should not happen to be of that opinion, shall\r\nwe swing for it? We are ready to die for our country, but it is rather\r\nan awkward business, this dying without touching the ground! After all,\r\nthat is a sort of hemp tax worse than any part of the tariff.\r\n\r\nMr. President, the honorable gentleman would be in a dilemma, like that\r\nof another great general. He would have a knot before him which he\r\ncould not untie. He must cut it with his sword. He must say to his\r\nfollowers, \"Defend yourselves with your bayonets\"; and this is\r\nwar,--civil war.\r\n\r\nDirect collision, therefore, between force and force, is the\r\nunavoidable result of that remedy for the revision of unconstitutional\r\nlaws which the gentleman contends for. It must happen in the very first\r\ncase to which it is applied. Is not this the plain result? To resist by\r\nforce the execution of a law, generally, is treason. Can the courts of\r\nthe United States take notice of the indulgence of a State to commit\r\ntreason? The common saying, that a State cannot commit treason herself,\r\nis nothing to the purpose. Can she authorize others to do it? If John\r\nFries had produced an act of Pennsylvania, annulling the law of\r\nCongress, would it have helped his case? Talk about it as we will,\r\nthese doctrines go the length of revolution. They are incompatible with\r\nany peaceable administration of the government. They lead directly to\r\ndisunion and civil commotion; and therefore it is, that at their\r\ncommencement, when they are first found to be maintained by respectable\r\nmen, and in a tangible form, I enter my public protest against them all.\r\n\r\nThe honorable gentleman argues, that, if this government be the sole\r\njudge of the extent of its own powers, whether that right of judging be\r\nin Congress or the Supreme Court, it equally subverts State\r\nsovereignty. This the gentleman sees, or thinks he sees, although he\r\ncannot perceive how the right of judging, in this matter, if left to\r\nthe exercise of State legislatures, has any tendency to subvert the\r\ngovernment of the Union. The gentleman's opinion may be, that the right\r\nought not to have been lodged with the general government; he may like\r\nbetter such a constitution as we should have under the right of State\r\ninterference; but I ask him to meet me on the plain matter of fact. I\r\nask him to meet me on the Constitution itself. I ask him if the power\r\nis not found there, clearly and visibly found there? But, Sir, what is\r\nthis danger, and what are the grounds of it? Let it be remembered, that\r\nthe Constitution of the United States is not unalterable. It is to\r\ncontinue in its present form no longer than the people who established\r\nit shall choose to continue it. If they shall become convinced that\r\nthey have made an injudicious or inexpedient partition and distribution\r\nof power between the State governments and the general government, they\r\ncan alter that distribution at will.\r\n\r\nIf anything be found in the national Constitution, either by original\r\nprovision or subsequent interpretation, which ought not to be in it,\r\nthe people know how to get rid of it. If any construction, unacceptable\r\nto them, be established, so as to become practically a part of the\r\nConstitution, they will amend it at their own sovereign pleasure. But\r\nwhile the people choose to maintain it as it is, while they are\r\nsatisfied with it, and refuse to change it, who has given, or who can\r\ngive, to the State legislatures a right to alter it, either by\r\ninterference, construction, or otherwise? Gentlemen do not seem to\r\nrecollect that the people have any power to do anything for themselves.\r\nThey imagine there is no safety for them, any longer than they are\r\nunder the close guardianship of the State legislatures. Sir, the people\r\nhave not trusted their safety in regard to the general Constitution to\r\nthese hands. They have required other security, and taken other bonds.\r\nThey have chosen to trust themselves, first, to the plain words of the\r\ninstrument, and to such construction as the government themselves, in\r\ndoubtful cases, should put on their own powers, under their oaths of\r\noffice, and subject to their responsibility to them; just as the people\r\nof a State trust their own State governments with a similar power.\r\nSecondly, they have reposed their trust in the efficacy of frequent\r\nelections, and in their own power to remove their own servants and\r\nagents whenever they see cause. Thirdly, they have reposed trust in the\r\njudicial power, which, in order that it might be trustworthy, they have\r\nmade as respectable, as disinterested, and as independent as was\r\npracticable. Fourthly, they have seen fit to rely, in case of\r\nnecessity, or high expediency, on their known and admitted power to\r\nalter or amend the Constitution, peaceably and quietly, whenever\r\nexperience shall point out defects or imperfections. And, finally, the\r\npeople of the United States have at no time, in no way, directly or\r\nindirectly, authorized any State legislature to construe or interpret\r\n_their_ high instrument of government; much less to interfere, by their\r\nown power, to arrest its course and operation.\r\n\r\nIf, Sir, the people in these respects had done otherwise than they have\r\ndone, their Constitution could neither have been preserved, nor would\r\nit have been worth preserving. And if its plain provisions shall now be\r\ndisregarded, and these new doctrines interpolated in it, it will become\r\nas feeble and helpless a being as its enemies, whether early or more\r\nrecent, could possibly desire. It will exist in every State but as a\r\npoor dependent on State permission. It must borrow leave to be; and\r\nwill be, no longer than State pleasure, or State discretion, sees fit\r\nto grant the indulgence, and to prolong its poor existence.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, although there are fears, there are hopes also. The people\r\nhave preserved this, their own chosen Constitution, for forty years,\r\nand have seen their happiness, prosperity, and renown grow with its\r\ngrowth, and strengthen with its strength. They are now, generally,\r\nstrongly attached to it. Overthrown by direct assault, it cannot be;\r\nevaded, undermined, NULLIFIED, it will not be, if we and those who\r\nshall succeed us here as agents and representatives of the people shall\r\nconscientiously and vigilantly discharge the two great branches of our\r\npublic trust, faithfully to preserve, and wisely to administer it.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I have thus stated the reasons of my dissent to the\r\ndoctrines which have been advanced and maintained. I am conscious of\r\nhaving detained you and the Senate much too long. I was drawn into the\r\ndebate with no previous deliberation, such as is suited to the\r\ndiscussion of so grave and important a subject. But it is a subject of\r\nwhich my heart is full, and I have not been willing to suppress the\r\nutterance of its spontaneous sentiments. I cannot, even now, persuade\r\nmyself to relinquish it, without expressing once more my deep\r\nconviction, that, since it respects nothing less than the Union of the\r\nStates, it is of most vital and essential importance to the public\r\nhappiness. I profess, Sir, in my career hitherto, to have kept steadily\r\nin view the prosperity and honor of the whole country, and the\r\npreservation of our Federal Union. It is to that Union we owe our\r\nsafety at home, and our consideration and dignity abroad. It is to that\r\nUnion that we are chiefly indebted for whatever makes us most proud of\r\nour country. That Union we reached only by the discipline of our\r\nvirtues in the severe school of adversity. It had its origin in the\r\nnecessities of disordered finance, prostrate commerce, and ruined\r\ncredit. Under its benign influences, these great interests immediately\r\nawoke, as from the dead, and sprang forth with newness of life. Every\r\nyear of its duration has teemed with fresh proofs of its utility and\r\nits blessings; and although our territory has stretched out wider and\r\nwider, and our population spread farther and farther, they have not\r\noutrun its protection or its benefits. It has been to us all a copious\r\nfountain of national, social, and personal happiness.\r\n\r\nI have not allowed myself, Sir, to look beyond the Union, to see what\r\nmight lie hidden in the dark recess behind. I have not coolly weighed\r\nthe chances of preserving liberty when the bonds that unite us together\r\nshall be broken asunder. I have not accustomed myself to hang over the\r\nprecipice of disunion, to see whether, with my short sight, I can\r\nfathom the depth of the abyss below; nor could I regard him as a safe\r\ncounsellor in the affairs of this government, whose thoughts should be\r\nmainly bent on considering, not how the Union may be best preserved,\r\nbut how tolerable might be the condition of the people when it should\r\nbe broken up and destroyed. While the Union lasts, we have high,\r\nexciting, gratifying prospects spread out before us, for us and our\r\nchildren. Beyond that I seek not to penetrate the veil. God grant that,\r\nin my day, at least, that curtain may not rise! God grant that on my\r\nvision never may be opened what lies behind! When my eyes shall be\r\nturned to behold for the last time the sun in heaven, may I not see him\r\nshining on the broken and dishonored fragments of a once glorious\r\nUnion; on States dissevered, discordant, belligerent; on a land rent\r\nwith civil feuds, or drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood! Let their\r\nlast feeble and lingering glance rather behold the gorgeous ensign of\r\nthe republic, now known and honored throughout the earth, still full\r\nhigh advanced, its arms and trophies streaming in their original\r\nlustre, not a stripe erased or polluted, nor a single star obscured,\r\nbearing for its motto, no such miserable interrogatory as \"What is all\r\nthis worth?\" nor those other words of delusion and folly, \"Liberty\r\nfirst and Union afterwards\"; but everywhere, spread all over in\r\ncharacters of living light, blazing on all its ample folds, as they\r\nfloat over the sea and over the land, and in every wind under the whole\r\nheavens, that other sentiment, dear to every true American\r\nheart,--Liberty _and_ Union, now and for ever, one and inseparable! [28]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Murder of Captain Joseph White.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am little accustomed, Gentlemen, to the part which I am now\r\nattempting to perform. Hardly more than once or twice has it happened\r\nto me to be concerned on the side of the government in any criminal\r\nprosecution whatever; and never, until the present occasion, in any\r\ncase affecting life.\r\n\r\nBut I very much regret that it should have been thought necessary to\r\nsuggest to you that I am brought here to \"hurry you against the law and\r\nbeyond the evidence.\" I hope I have too much regard for justice, and\r\ntoo much respect for my own character, to attempt either; and 10 were I\r\nto make such attempt, I am sure that in this court nothing can be\r\ncarried against the law, and that gentlemen, intelligent and just as\r\nyou are, are not, by any power, to be hurried beyond the evidence.\r\nThough I could well have wished to shun this occasion, I have not felt\r\nat liberty to withhold my professional assistance, when it is supposed\r\nthat I may be in some degree useful in investigating and discovering\r\nthe truth respecting this most extraordinary murder. It has seemed to\r\nbe a duty incumbent on me, as on every other citizen, to do my best and\r\nmy utmost to bring to light the perpetrators of this crime. Against the\r\nprisoner at the bar, as an individual, I cannot have the slightest\r\nprejudice. I would not do him the smallest injury or injustice. But I\r\ndo not affect to be indifferent to the discovery and the punishment of\r\nthis deep guilt. I cheerfully share in the opprobrium, how great soever\r\nit may be, which is cast on those who feel and manifest an anxious\r\nconcern that all who had a part in planning, or a hand in executing,\r\nthis deed of midnight assassination, may be brought to answer for their\r\nenormous crime at the bar of public justice.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it is a most extraordinary case. In some respects, it has\r\nhardly a precedent anywhere; certainly none in our New England history.\r\nThis bloody drama exhibited no suddenly excited, ungovernable rage. The\r\nactors in it were not surprised by any lion-like temptation springing\r\nupon their virtue, and overcoming it, before resistance could begin.\r\nNor did they do the deed to glut savage vengeance, or satiate\r\nlong-settled and deadly hate. It was a cool, calculating, money-making\r\nmurder. It was all \"hire and salary, not revenge.\" It was the weighing\r\nof money against life; the counting out of so many pieces of silver\r\nagainst so many ounces of blood.\r\n\r\nAn aged man, without an enemy in the world, in his own house, and in\r\nhis own bed, is made the victim of a butcherly murder, for mere pay.\r\nTruly, here is a new lesson for painters and poets. Whoever shall\r\nhereafter draw the portrait of murder, if he will show it as it has\r\nbeen exhibited, where such example was last to have been looked for, in\r\nthe very bosom of our New England society, let him not give it the grim\r\nvisage of Moloch, the brow knitted by revenge, the face black with\r\nsettled hate, and the bloodshot eye emitting livid fires of malice. Let\r\nhim draw, rather, a decorous, smooth-faced, bloodless demon; a picture\r\nin repose, rather than in action; not so much an example of human\r\nnature in its depravity, and in its paroxysms of crime, as an infernal\r\nbeing, a fiend, in the ordinary display and development of his\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe deed was executed with a degree of self-possession and steadiness\r\nequal to the wickedness with which it was planned. The circumstances\r\nnow clearly in evidence spread out the whole scene before us. Deep\r\nsleep had fallen on the destined victim, and on all beneath his roof. A\r\nhealthful old man, to whom sleep was sweet, the first sound slumbers of\r\nthe night held him in their soft but strong embrace. The assassin\r\nenters, through the window already prepared, into an unoccupied\r\napartment. With noiseless foot he paces the lonely hall, half lighted\r\nby the moon; he winds up the ascent of the stairs, and reaches the door\r\nof the chamber. Of this, he moves the lock, by soft and continued\r\npressure, till it turns on its hinges without noise; and he enters, and\r\nbeholds his victim before him. The room is uncommonly open to the\r\nadmission of light. The face of the innocent sleeper is turned from the\r\nmurderer, and the beams of the moon, resting on the gray locks of his\r\naged temple, show him where to strike. The fatal blow is given! and the\r\nvictim passes, without a struggle or a motion, from the repose of sleep\r\nto the repose of death! It is the assassin's purpose to make sure work;\r\nand he plies the dagger, though it is obvious that life has been\r\ndestroyed by the blow of the bludgeon. He even raises the aged arm,\r\nthat he may not fail in his aim at the heart, and replaces it again\r\nover the wounds of the poinard! To finish the picture, he explores the\r\nwrist for the pulse! He feels for it, and ascertains that it beats no\r\nlonger! It is accomplished. The deed is done. He retreats, retraces his\r\nsteps to the window, passes out through it as he came in, and escapes.\r\nHe has done the murder. No eye has seen him, no ear has heard him. The\r\nsecret is his own, and it is safe!\r\n\r\nAh! Gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake. Such a secret can be safe\r\nnowhere. The whole creation of God has neither nook nor corner where\r\nthe guilty can bestow it, and say it is safe. Not to speak of that eye\r\nwhich pierces all disguises, and beholds every thing as in the splendor\r\nof noon, such secrets of guilt are never safe from detection, even by\r\nmen. True it is, generally speaking, that \"murder will out.\" True it\r\nis, that Providence hath so ordained, and doth so govern things, that\r\nthose who break the great law of Heaven by shedding man's blood seldom\r\nsucceed in avoiding discovery. Especially, in a case exciting so much\r\nattention as this, discovery must come, and will come, sooner or later.\r\nA thousand eyes turn at once to explore every man, every thing, every\r\ncircumstance, connected with the time and place; a thousand ears catch\r\nevery whisper; a thousand excited minds intensely dwell on the scene,\r\nshedding all their light, and ready to kindle the slightest\r\ncircumstance into a blaze of discovery. Meantime the guilty soul cannot\r\nkeep its own secret. It is false to itself; or rather it feels an\r\nirresistible impulse of conscience to be true to itself. It labors\r\nunder its guilty possession, and knows not what to do with it. The\r\nhuman heart was not made for the residence of such an inhabitant. It\r\nfinds itself preyed on by a torment, which it dares not acknowledge to\r\nGod or man. A vulture is devouring it, and it can ask no sympathy or\r\nassistance, either from heaven or earth. The secret which the murderer\r\npossesses soon comes to possess him; and, like the evil spirits of\r\nwhich we read, it overcomes him, and leads him whithersoever it will.\r\nHe feels it beating at his heart, rising to his throat, and demanding\r\ndisclosure. He thinks the whole world sees it in his face, reads it in\r\nhis eyes, and almost hears its workings in the very silence of his\r\nthoughts. It has become his master. It betrays his discretion, it\r\nbreaks down his courage, it conquers his prudence. When suspicions from\r\nwithout begin to embarrass him, and the net of circumstances to\r\nentangle him, the fatal secret struggles with still greater violence to\r\nburst forth. It must be confessed, it will be confessed; there is no\r\nrefuge from confession but suicide, and suicide is confession.[1]\r\n\r\nMuch has been said, on this occasion, of the excitement which has\r\nexisted, and still exists, and of the extraordinary measures taken to\r\ndiscover and punish the guilty. No doubt there has been, and is, much\r\nexcitement, and strange indeed it would be had it been otherwise.\r\nShould not all the peaceable and well-disposed naturally feel\r\nconcerned, and naturally exert themselves to bring to punishment the\r\nauthors of this secret assassination? Was it a thing to be slept upon\r\nor forgotten? Did you, Gentlemen, sleep quite as quietly in your beds\r\nafter this murder as before? Was it not a case for rewards, for\r\nmeetings, for committees, for the united efforts of all the good, to\r\nfind out a band of murderous conspirators, of midnight ruffians, and to\r\nbring them to the bar of justice and law? If this be excitement, is it\r\nan unnatural or an improper excitement?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, Gentlemen, that there are appearances of another\r\nfeeling, of a very different nature and character; not very extensive,\r\nI would hope, but still there is too much evidence of its existence.\r\nSuch is human nature, that some persons lose their abhorrence of crime\r\nin their admiration of its magnificent exhibitions. Ordinary vice is\r\nreprobated by them, but extraordinary guilt, exquisite wickedness, the\r\nhigh flights and poetry of crime, seize on the imagination, and lead\r\nthem to forget the depths of the guilt, in admiration of the excellence\r\nof the performance, or the unequalled atrocity of the purpose. There\r\nare those in our day who have made great use of this infirmity of our\r\nnature, and by means of it done infinite injury to the cause of good\r\nmorals. They have affected not only the taste, but I fear also the\r\nprinciples, of the young, the heedless, and the imaginative, by the\r\nexhibition of interesting and beautiful monsters. They render depravity\r\nattractive, sometimes by the polish of its manners, and sometimes by\r\nits very extravagance; and study to show off crime under all the\r\nadvantages of cleverness and dexterity. Gentlemen, this is an\r\nextraordinary murder, but it is still a murder. We are not to lose\r\nourselves in wonder at its origin, or in gazing on its cool and skilful\r\nexecution. We are to detect and to punish it; and while we proceed with\r\ncaution against the prisoner, and are to be sure that we do not visit\r\non his head the offences of others, we are yet to consider that we are\r\ndealing with a case of most atrocious crime, which has not the\r\nslightest circumstance about it to soften its enormity. It is murder;\r\ndeliberate, concerted, malicious murder.\r\n\r\nAlthough the interest of this case may have diminished by the repeated\r\ninvestigation of the facts; still, the additional labor which it\r\nimposes upon all concerned is not to be regretted, if it should result\r\nin removing all doubts of the guilt of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe learned counsel for the prisoner has said truly, that it is your\r\nindividual duty to judge the prisoner; that it is your individual duty\r\nto determine his guilt or innocence; and that you are to weigh the\r\ntestimony with candor and fairness. But much at the same time has been\r\nsaid, which, though it would seem to have no distinct bearing on the\r\ntrial, cannot be passed over without some notice.\r\n\r\nA tone of complaint so peculiar has been indulged, as would almost lead\r\nus to doubt whether the prisoner at the bar, or the managers of this\r\nprosecution, are now on trial. Great pains have been taken to complain\r\nof the manner of the prosecution. We hear of getting up a case; of\r\nsetting in motion trains of machinery; of foul testimony; of\r\ncombinations to overwhelm the prisoner; of private prosecutors; that\r\nthe prisoner is hunted, persecuted, driven to his trial; that everybody\r\nis against him; and various other complaints, as if those who would\r\nbring to punishment the authors of this murder were almost as bad as\r\nthey who committed it.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my whole life, I have never heard before so much said\r\nabout the particular counsel who happen to be employed; as if it were\r\nextraordinary that other counsel than the usual officers of the\r\ngovernment should assist in the management of a case on the part of the\r\ngovernment.[2] In one of the last criminal trials in this county, that\r\nof Jackman for the \"Goodridge robbery\" (so called), I remember that the\r\nlearned head of the Suffolk Bar, Mr. Prescott, came down in aid of the\r\nofficers of the government. This was regarded as neither strange nor\r\nimproper. The counsel for the prisoner, in that case, contented\r\nthemselves with answering his arguments, as far as they were able,\r\ninstead of carping at his presence.\r\n\r\nComplaint is made that rewards were offered, in this case, and\r\ntemptations held out to obtain testimony. Are not rewards always\r\noffered, when great and secret offences are committed? Rewards were\r\noffered in the case to which I have alluded; and every other means\r\ntaken to discover the offenders, that ingenuity or the most persevering\r\nvigilance could suggest. The learned counsel have suffered their zeal\r\nto lead them into a strain of complaint at the manner in which the\r\nperpetrators of this crime were detected, almost indicating that they\r\nregard it as a positive injury to them to have found but their guilt.\r\nSince no man witnessed it, since they do not now confess it, attempts\r\nto discover it are half esteemed as officious intermeddling and\r\nimpertinent inquiry.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that here even a Committee of Vigilance was appointed. This\r\nis a subject of reiterated remark. This committee are pointed at, as\r\nthough they had been officiously intermeddling with the administration\r\nof justice. They are said to have been \"laboring for months\" against\r\nthe prisoner. Gentlemen, what must we do in such a case? Are people to\r\nbe dumb and still, through fear of overdoing? Is it come to this, that\r\nan effort cannot be made, a hand cannot be lifted, to discover the\r\nguilty, without its being said there is a combination to overwhelm\r\ninnocence? Has the community lost all moral sense? Certainly, a\r\ncommunity that would not be roused to action upon an occasion such as\r\nthis was, a community which should not deny sleep to their eyes, and\r\nslumber to their eyelids, till they had exhausted all the means of\r\ndiscovery and detection, must indeed be lost to all moral sense, and\r\nwould scarcely deserve protection from the laws. The learned counsel\r\nhave endeavored to persuade you, that there exists a prejudice against\r\nthe persons accused of this murder. They would have you understand that\r\nit is not confined to this vicinity alone; but that even the\r\nlegislature have caught this spirit. That through the procurement of\r\nthe gentleman here styled private prosecutor, who is a member of the\r\nSenate, a special session of this court was appointed for the trial of\r\nthese offenders. That the ordinary movements of the wheels of justice\r\nwere too slow for the purposes devised. But does not everybody see and\r\nknow, that it was matter of absolute necessity to have a special\r\nsession of the court? When or how could the prisoners have been tried\r\nwithout a special session? In the ordinary arrangement of the courts,\r\nbut one week in a year is allotted for the whole court to sit in this\r\ncounty. In the trial of all capital offences a majority of the court,\r\nat least, is required to be present. In the trial of the present case\r\nalone, three weeks have already been taken up. Without such special\r\nsession, then, three years would not have been sufficient for the\r\npurpose. It is answer sufficient to all complaints on this subject to\r\nsay, that the law was drawn by the late Chief Justice [3] himself, to\r\nenable the court to accomplish its duties, and to afford the persons\r\naccused an opportunity for trial without delay.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is said that it was not thought of making Francis Knapp, the\r\nprisoner at the bar, a PRINCIPAL till after the death of Richard\r\nCrowningshield, Jr.; that the present indictment is an afterthought;\r\nthat \"testimony was got up\" for the occasion. It is not so. There is no\r\nauthority for this suggestion. The case of the Knapps had not then been\r\nbefore the grand jury. The officers of the government did not know what\r\nthe testimony would be against them. They could not, therefore, have\r\ndetermined what course they should pursue. They intended to arraign all\r\nas principals who should appear to have been principals, and all as\r\naccessories who should appear to have been accessories. All this could\r\nbe known only when the evidence should be produced. But the learned\r\ncounsel for the defendant take a somewhat loftier flight still. They\r\nare more concerned, they assure us, for the law itself, than even for\r\ntheir client. Your decision in this case, they say, will stand as a\r\nprecedent. Gentlemen, we hope it will. We hope it will be a precedent\r\nboth of candor and intelligence, of fairness and of firmness; a\r\nprecedent of good sense and honest purpose pursuing their investigation\r\ndiscreetly, rejecting loose generalities, exploring all the\r\ncircumstances, weighing each, in search of truth, and embracing and\r\ndeclaring the truth when found.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that \"laws are made, not for the punishment of the guilty,\r\nbut for the protection of the innocent.\" This is not quite accurate,\r\nperhaps, but if so, we hope they will be so administered as to give\r\nthat protection. But who are the innocent whom the law would protect?\r\nGentlemen, Joseph White was innocent. They are innocent who, having\r\nlived in the fear of God through the day, wish to sleep in his peace\r\nthrough the night, in their own beds. The law is established that those\r\nwho live quietly may sleep quietly; that they who do no harm may feel\r\nnone. The gentleman can think of none that are innocent except the\r\nprisoner at the bar, not yet convicted. Is a proved conspirator to\r\nmurder innocent? Are the Crowningshields and the Knapps innocent? What\r\nis innocence? How deep stained with blood, how reckless in crime, how\r\ndeep in depravity may it be, and yet remain innocence? The law is made,\r\nif we would speak with entire accuracy, to protect the innocent by\r\npunishing the guilty. But there are those innocent out of a court, as\r\nwell as in; innocent citizens not suspected of crime, as well as\r\ninnocent prisoners at the bar.\r\n\r\nThe criminal law is not founded in a principle of vengeance. It does\r\nnot punish that it may inflict suffering. The humanity of the law feels\r\nand regrets every pain it causes, every hour of restraint it imposes,\r\nand more deeply still every life it forfeits. But it uses evil as the\r\nmeans of preventing greater evil. It seeks to deter from crime by the\r\nexample of punishment. This is its true, and only true main object. It\r\nrestrains the liberty of the few offenders, that the many who do not\r\noffend may enjoy their liberty. It takes the life of the murderer, that\r\nother murders may not be committed. The law might open the jails, and\r\nat once set free all persons accused of offences, and it ought to do so\r\nif it could be made certain that no other offences would hereafter be\r\ncommitted, because it punishes, not to satisfy any desire to inflict\r\npain, but simply to prevent the repetition of crimes. When the guilty,\r\ntherefore, are not punished, the law has so far failed of its purpose;\r\nthe safety of the innocent is so far endangered. Every unpunished\r\nmurder takes away something from the security of every man's life.\r\nWhenever a jury, through whimsical and ill-founded scruples, suffer the\r\nguilty to escape, they make themselves answerable for the augmented\r\ndanger of the innocent.\r\n\r\nWe wish nothing to be strained against this defendant. Why, then, all\r\nthis alarm? Why all this complaint against the manner in which the\r\ncrime is discovered? The prisoner's counsel catch at supposed flaws of\r\nevidence, or bad character of witnesses, without meeting the case. Do\r\nthey mean to deny the conspiracy? Do they mean to deny that the two\r\nCrowningshields and the two Knapps were conspirators? Why do they rail\r\nagainst Palmer, while they do not disprove, and hardly dispute, the\r\ntruth of any one fact sworn to by him? Instead of this, it is made\r\nmatter of sentimentality that Palmer has been prevailed upon to betray\r\nhis bosom companions and to violate the sanctity of friendship. Again I\r\nask, Why do they not meet the case? If the fact is out, why not meet\r\nit? Do they mean to deny that Captain White is dead? One would have\r\nalmost supposed even that, from some remarks that have been made. Do\r\nthey mean to deny the conspiracy? Or, admitting a conspiracy, do they\r\nmean to deny only that Frank Knapp, the prisoner at the bar, was\r\nabetting in the murder, being present, and so deny that he was a\r\nprincipal? If a conspiracy is proved, it bears closely upon every\r\nsubsequent subject of inquiry. Why do they not come to the fact? Here\r\nthe defence is wholly indistinct. The counsel neither take the ground,\r\nnor abandon it. They neither fly, nor light. They hover. But they must\r\ncome to a closer mode of contest. They must meet the facts, and either\r\ndeny or admit them. Had the prisoner at the bar, then, a knowledge of\r\nthis conspiracy or not? This is the question. Instead of laying out\r\ntheir strength in complaining of the _manner_ in which the deed is\r\ndiscovered, of the extraordinary pains taken to bring the prisoner's\r\nguilt to light, would it not be better to show there was no guilt?\r\nWould it not be better to show his innocence? They say, and they\r\ncomplain, that the community feel a great desire that he should be\r\npunished for his crimes. Would it not be better to convince you that he\r\nhas committed no crime?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, let us now come to the case. Your first inquiry, on the\r\nevidence, will be, Was Captain White murdered in pursuance of a\r\nconspiracy, and was the defendant one of this conspiracy? If so, the\r\nsecond inquiry is, Was he so connected with the murder itself as that\r\nhe is liable to be convicted as a _principal_? The defendant is\r\nindicted as a _principal_. If not guilty _as such_, you cannot convict\r\nhim. The indictment contains three distinct classes of counts. In the\r\nfirst, he is charged as having done the deed with his own hand; in the\r\nsecond, as an aider and abettor to Richard Crowningshield, Jr., who did\r\nthe deed; in the third, as an aider and abettor to some person unknown.\r\nIf you believe him guilty on either of these counts, or in either of\r\nthese ways, you must convict him.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to say, as a preliminary remark, that there are two\r\nextraordinary circumstances attending this trial. One is, that Richard\r\nCrowningshield, Jr., the supposed immediate perpetrator of the murder,\r\nsince his arrest, has committed suicide. He has gone to answer before a\r\ntribunal of perfect infallibility. The other is, that Joseph Knapp, the\r\nsupposed originator and planner of the murder, having once made a full\r\ndisclosure of the facts, under a promise of indemnity, is,\r\nnevertheless, not now a witness. Notwithstanding his disclosure and his\r\npromise of indemnity, he now refuses to testify. He chooses to return\r\nto his original state, and now stands answerable himself, when the time\r\nshall come for his trial. These circumstances it is fit you should\r\nremember, in your investigation of the case.\r\n\r\nYour decision may affect more than the life of this defendant. If he be\r\nnot convicted as principal, no one can be. Nor can any one be convicted\r\nof a participation in the crime as accessory. The Knapps and George\r\nCrowningshield will be again on the community. This shows the\r\nimportance of the duty you have to perform, and serves to remind you of\r\nthe care and wisdom necessary to be exercised in its performance. But\r\ncertainly these considerations do not render the prisoner's guilt any\r\nclearer, nor enhance the weight of the evidence against him. No one\r\ndesires you to regard consequences in that light. No one wishes any\r\nthing to be strained, or too far pressed against the prisoner. Still,\r\nit is fit you should see the full importance of the duty which devolves\r\nupon you.[4] . . .\r\n\r\nGentlemen, your whole concern should be to do your duty, and leave\r\nconsequences to take care of themselves. You will receive the law from\r\nthe court. Your verdict, it is true, may endanger the prisoner's life,\r\nbut then it is to save other lives. If the prisoner's guilt has been\r\nshown and proved beyond all reasonable doubt, you will convict him. If\r\nsuch reasonable doubts of guilt still remain, you will acquit him. You\r\nare the judges of the whole case. You owe a duty to the public, as well\r\nas to the prisoner at the bar. You cannot presume to be wiser than the\r\nlaw. Your duty is a plain, straightforward one. Doubtless we would all\r\njudge him in mercy. Towards him, as an individual, the law inculcates\r\nno hostility; but towards him, if proved to be a murderer, the law, and\r\nthe oaths you have taken, and public justice, demand that you do your\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nWith consciences satisfied with the discharge of duty, no consequences\r\ncan harm you. There is no evil that we cannot either face or fly from,\r\nbut the consciousness of duty disregarded. A sense of duty pursues us\r\never. It is omnipresent, like the Deity. If we take to ourselves the\r\nwings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, duty\r\nperformed, or duty violated, is still with us, for our happiness or our\r\nmisery. If we say the darkness shall cover us, in the darkness as in\r\nthe light our obligations are yet with us. We cannot escape their\r\npower, nor fly from their presence. They are with us in this life, will\r\nbe with us at its close; and in that scene of inconceivable solemnity,\r\nwhich lies yet further onward, we shall still find ourselves surrounded\r\nby the consciousness of duty, to pain us wherever it has been violated,\r\nand to console us so far as God may have given us grace to perform it.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION NOT A COMPACT BETWEEN SOVEREIGN STATES.\r\n\r\nMr. President,-The gentleman from South Carolina has admonished us to\r\nbe mindful of the opinions of those who shall come after us. We must\r\ntake our chance, Sir, as to the light in which posterity will regard\r\nus. I do not decline its judgment, nor withhold myself from its\r\nscrutiny. Feeling that I am performing my public duty with singleness\r\nof heart and to the best of my ability, I fearlessly trust myself to\r\nthe country, now and hereafter, and leave both my motives and my\r\ncharacter to its decision.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman has terminated his speech in a tone of threat and\r\ndefiance towards this bill, even should it become a law of the land,\r\naltogether unusual in the halls of Congress. But I shall not suffer\r\nmyself to be excited into warmth by his denunciation of the measure\r\nwhich I support. Among the feelings which at this moment fill my\r\nbreast, not the least is that of regret at the position in which the\r\ngentleman has placed himself. Sir, he does himself no justice. The\r\ncause which he has espoused finds no basis in the Constitution, no\r\nsuccor from public sympathy, no cheering from a patriotic community. He\r\nhas no foothold on which to stand while he might display the powers of\r\nhis acknowledged talents. Every thing beneath his feet is hollow and\r\ntreacherous. He is like a strong man struggling in a morass: every\r\neffort to extricate himself only sinks him deeper and deeper. And I\r\nfear the resemblance may be carried still farther; I fear that no\r\nfriend can safely come to his relief, that no one can approach near\r\nenough to hold out a helping hand, without danger of going down\r\nhimself, also, into the bottomless depths of this Serbonian bog.\r\n\r\nThe honorable gentleman has declared, that on the decision of the\r\nquestion now in debate may depend the cause of liberty itself. I am of\r\nthe same opinion; but then, Sir, the liberty which I think is staked on\r\nthe contest is not political liberty, in any general and undefined\r\ncharacter, but our own well-understood and long-enjoyed _American_\r\nliberty,\r\n\r\nSir, I love Liberty no less ardently than the gentleman himself, in\r\nwhatever form she may have appeared in the progress of human history.\r\nAs exhibited in the master states of antiquity, as breaking out again\r\nfrom amidst the darkness of the Middle Ages, and beaming on the\r\nformation of new communities in modern Europe, she has, always and\r\neverywhere, charms for me. Yet, Sir, it is our own liberty, guarded by\r\nconstitutions and secured by union, it is that liberty which is our\r\npaternal inheritance, it is our established, dear-bought, peculiar\r\nAmerican liberty, to which I am chiefly devoted, and the cause of which\r\nI now mean, to the utmost of my power, to maintain and defend.\r\n\r\nMr. President, if I considered the constitutional question now before\r\nus as doubtful as it is important, and if I supposed that its decision,\r\neither in the Senate or by the country, was likely to be in any degree\r\ninfluenced by the manner in which I might now discuss it, this would be\r\nto me a moment of deep solicitude. Such a moment has once existed.\r\nThere has been a time, when, rising in this place, on the same\r\nquestion, I felt, I must confess, that something for good or evil to\r\nthe Constitution of the country might depend on an effort of mine. But\r\ncircumstances are changed. Since that day, Sir, the public opinion has\r\nbecome awakened to this great question; it has grasped it; it has\r\nreasoned upon it, as becomes an intelligent and patriotic community,\r\nand has settled it, or now seems in the progress of settling it, by an\r\nauthority which none can disobey, the authority of the people\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nI shall not, Mr. President, follow the gentleman, step by step, through\r\nthe course of his speech. Much of what he has said he has deemed\r\nnecessary to the just explanation and defence of his own political\r\ncharacter and conduct. On this I shall offer no comment. Much, too, has\r\nconsisted of philosophical remark upon the general nature of political\r\nliberty, and the history of free institutions; and upon other topics,\r\nso general in their nature as to possess, in my opinion, only a remote\r\nbearing on the immediate subject of this debate.\r\n\r\nBut the gentleman's speech made some days ago, upon introducing his\r\nresolutions, those resolutions themselves, and parts of the speech now\r\njust concluded, may, I presume, be justly regarded as containing the\r\nwhole South Carolina doctrine. That doctrine it is my purpose now to\r\nexamine, and to compare it with the Constitution of the United States.\r\nI shall not consent, Sir, to make any new constitution, or to establish\r\nanother form of government. I will not undertake to say what a\r\nconstitution for these United States ought to be. That question the\r\npeople have decided for themselves; and I shall take the instrument as\r\nthey have established it, and shall endeavor to maintain it, in its\r\nplain sense and meaning, against opinions and notions, which, in my\r\njudgment, threaten its subversion.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions introduced by the gentleman were apparently drawn up\r\nwith care, and brought forward upon deliberation. I shall not be in\r\ndanger, therefore, of misunderstanding him, or those who agree with\r\nhim, if I proceed at once to these resolutions, and consider them as an\r\nauthentic statement of those opinions upon the great constitutional\r\nquestion by which the recent proceedings in South Carolina are\r\nattempted to be justified.\r\n\r\nThese resolutions are three in number.\r\n\r\nThe third seems intended to enumerate, and to deny, the several\r\nopinions expressed in the President's proclamation, respecting the\r\nnature and powers of this government. Of this third resolution, I\r\npurpose, at present, to take no particular notice.\r\n\r\nThe first two resolutions of the honorable member affirm these\r\npropositions, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. That the political system under which we live, and under which\r\nCongress is now assembled, is a _compact_, to which the people of the\r\nseveral States, as separate and sovereign communities, are _the\r\nparties_.\r\n\r\n2. That these sovereign parties have a right to judge, each for itself,\r\nof any alleged violation of the Constitution by Congress; and, in case\r\nof such violation, to choose, each for itself, its own mode and measure\r\nof redress.\r\n\r\nIt is true, Sir, that the honorable member calls this a\r\n\"constitutional\" compact; but still he affirms it to be a compact\r\nbetween sovereign States. What precise meaning, then, does he attach to\r\nthe term _constitutional_? When applied to compacts between sovereign\r\nStates, the term _constitutional_ affixes to the word _compact_ no\r\ndefinite idea. Were we to hear of a constitutional league or treaty\r\nbetween England and France, or a constitutional convention between\r\nAustria and Russia, we should not understand what could be intended by\r\nsuch a league, such a treaty, or such a convention. In these\r\nconnections, the word is void of all meaning; and yet, Sir, it is easy,\r\nquite easy, to see why the honorable gentleman has used it in these\r\nresolutions. He cannot open the book, and look upon our written frame\r\nof government, without seeing that it is called a _constitution_. This\r\nmay well be appalling to him. It threatens his whole doctrine of\r\ncompact, and its darling derivatives, nullification and secession, with\r\ninstant confutation. Because, if he admits our instrument of government\r\nto be a _constitution_, then, for that very reason, it is not a compact\r\nbetween sovereigns; a constitution of government and a compact between\r\nsovereign powers being things essentially unlike in their very natures,\r\nand incapable of ever being the same. Yet the word _constitution_ is on\r\nthe very front of the instrument. He cannot overlook it. He seeks,\r\ntherefore, to compromise the matter, and to sink all the substantial\r\nsense of the word, while he retains a resemblance of its sound. He\r\nintroduces a new word of his own, viz. _compact_, as importing the\r\nprincipal idea, and designed to play the principal part, and degrades\r\n_constitution_ into an insignificant, idle epithet, attached to\r\n_compact_. The whole then stands as a _\"constitutional compact\"!_ And\r\nin this way he hopes to pass off a plausible gloss, as satisfying the\r\nwords of the instrument. But he will find himself disappointed. Sir, I\r\nmust say to the honorable gentleman, that, in our American political\r\ngrammar, CONSTITUTION is a noun substantive; it imports a distinct and\r\nclear idea of itself; and it is not to lose its importance and dignity,\r\nit is not to be turned into a poor, ambiguous, senseless, unmeaning\r\nadjective, for the purpose of accommodating any new set of political\r\nnotions. Sir, we reject his new rules of syntax altogether. We will not\r\ngive up our forms of political speech to the grammarians of the school\r\nof nullification. By the Constitution, we mean, not a \"constitutional\r\ncompact,\" but, simply and directly, the Constitution, the fundamental\r\nlaw; and if there be one word in the language which the people of the\r\nUnited States understand, this is that word. We know no more of a\r\nconstitutional compact between sovereign powers, than we know of a\r\n_constitutional_ indenture of copartnership, a _constitutional_ deed of\r\nconveyance, or a _constitutional_ bill of exchange. But we know what\r\nthe _Constitution_ is; we know what the plainly written fundamental law\r\nis; we know what the bond of our Union and the security of our\r\nliberties is; and we mean to maintain and to defend it, in its plain\r\nsense and unsophisticated meaning.\r\n\r\nThe sense of the gentleman's proposition, therefore, is not at all\r\naffected, one way or the other, by the use of this word. That\r\nproposition still is, that our system of government is but a _compact_\r\nbetween the people of separate and sovereign States.\r\n\r\nWas it Mirabeau, Mr. President, or some other master of the human\r\npassions, who has told us that words are things? They are indeed\r\nthings, and things of mighty influence, not only in addresses to the\r\npassions and high-wrought feelings of mankind, but in the discussion of\r\nlegal and political questions also; because a just conclusion is often\r\navoided, or a false one reached, by the adroit substitution of one\r\nphrase, or one word, for another. Of this we have, I think, another\r\nexample in the resolutions before us.\r\n\r\nThe first resolution declares that the people of the several States\r\n_\"acceded\"_ to the Constitution, or to the constitutional compact, as\r\nit is called. This word \"accede,\" not found either in the Constitution\r\nitself, or in the ratification of it by any one of the States, has been\r\nchosen for use here, doubtless, not without a well-considered purpose.\r\n\r\nThe natural converse of _accession_ is _secession_; and, therefore,\r\nwhen it is stated that the people of the States acceded to the Union,\r\nit may be more plausibly argued that they may secede from it. If, in\r\nadopting the Constitution, nothing was done but acceding to a compact,\r\nnothing would seem necessary, in order to break it up, but to secede\r\nfrom the same compact. But the term is wholly out of place.\r\n_Accession_, as a word applied to political associations, implies\r\ncoming into a league, treaty, or confederacy, by one hitherto a\r\nstranger to it; and _secession_ implies departing from such league or\r\nconfederacy. The people of the United States have used no such form of\r\nexpression in establishing the present government. They do not say that\r\nthey _accede_ to a league, but they declare that they _ordain_ and\r\n_establish_ a Constitution. Such are the very words of the instrument\r\nitself; and in all the States, without an exception, the language used\r\nby their conventions was, that they \"_ratified the Constitution_\"; some\r\nof them employing the additional words \"assented to\" and \"adopted,\" but\r\nall of them \"ratifying.\"\r\n\r\nThere is more importance than may, at first sight, appear, in the\r\nintroduction of this new word, by the honorable mover of these\r\nresolutions. Its adoption and use are indispensable to maintain those\r\npremises from which his main conclusion is to be afterwards drawn. But\r\nbefore showing that, allow me to remark, that this phraseology tends to\r\nkeep out of sight the just view of a previous political history, as\r\nwell as to suggest wrong ideas as to what was actually done when the\r\npresent Constitution was agreed to. In 1789, and before this\r\nConstitution was adopted, the United States had already been in a\r\nunion, more or less close, for fifteen years. At least as far back as\r\nthe meeting of the first Congress, in 1774, they had been in some\r\nmeasure, and for some national purposes, united together. Before the\r\nConfederation of 1781, they had declared independence jointly, and had\r\ncarried on the war jointly, both by sea and land; and this not as\r\nseparate States, but as one people. When, therefore, they formed that\r\nConfederation, and adopted its articles as articles of perpetual union,\r\nthey did not come together for the first time; and therefore they did\r\nnot speak of the States as _acceding_ to the Confederation, although it\r\nwas a league, and nothing but a league, and rested on nothing but\r\nplighted faith for its performance. Yet, even then, the States were not\r\nstrangers to each other; there was a bond of union already subsisting\r\nbetween them; they were associated, united States; and the object of\r\nthe Confederation was to make a stronger and better bond of union.\r\nTheir representatives deliberated together on these proposed Articles\r\nof Confederation, and being authorized by their respective States,\r\nfinally \"_ratified and confirmed_\" them. Inasmuch as they were already\r\nin union, they did not speak of _acceding_ to the new Articles of\r\nConfederation, but of _ratifying_ and _confirming_ them; and this\r\nlanguage was not used inadvertently, because, in the same instrument,\r\n_accession_ is used in its proper sense, when applied to Canada, which\r\nwas altogether a stranger to the existing union. \"Canada,\" says the\r\neleventh article, \"_acceding_ to this Confederation, and joining in the\r\nmeasures of the United States, shall be admitted into the Union.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus used the terms _ratify_ and _confirm_, even in regard to\r\nthe old Confederation, it would have been strange indeed, if the people\r\nof the United States, after its formation, and when they came to\r\nestablish the present Constitution, had spoken of the States, or the\r\npeople of the States, as _acceding_ to this constitution. Such language\r\nwould have been ill-suited to the occasion. It would have implied an\r\nexisting separation or disunion among the States, such as never has\r\nexisted since 1774. No such language, therefore, was used. The language\r\nactually employed is, _adopt, ratify, ordain, establish_.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, since any State, before she can prove her right to\r\ndissolve the Union, must show her authority to undo what has been done,\r\nno State is at liberty to _secede_, on the ground that she and other\r\nStates have done nothing but _accede_. She must show that she has a\r\nright to _reverse_ what has been _ordained_, to _unsettle_ and\r\n_overthrow_ what has been _established_, to _reject_ what the people\r\nhave _adopted_, and to breakup what have _ratified_; because these are\r\nthe terms which express the transactions which have actually taken\r\nplace. In other words, she must show her right to make a revolution.\r\n\r\nIf, Mr. President, in drawing these resolutions, the honorable member\r\nand confined himself to the use of constitutional language, there would\r\nhave been a wide and awful _hiatus_ between his premises and his\r\nconclusion. Leaving out the two words _compact_ and _accession_, which\r\nare not constitutional modes of expression, and stating the matter\r\nprecisely as the truth is, his first resolution would have affirmed\r\nthat _the people of the several States ratified this Constitution, or\r\nform of government_. These are the very words of South Carolina\r\nherself, in her act of ratification. Let, then, his first resolution\r\ntell the exact truth; let it state the fact precisely as it exists; let\r\nit say that the people of the several States ratified a constitution,\r\nor form of government, and then, Sir, what will become of his inference\r\nin his second resolution, which is in these words, viz. \"that, as in\r\nall other cases of compact among sovereign parties, each has an equal\r\nright to judge for itself, as well of the infraction as of the mode and\r\nmeasure of redress\"? It is obvious, is it not, Sir? that this\r\nconclusion requires for its support quite other premises; it requires\r\npremises which speak of _accession_ and of _compact_ between sovereign\r\npowers; and, without such premises, it is altogether unmeaning.\r\n\r\nMr. President, if the honorable member will truly state what the people\r\ndid in forming this Constitution, and then state what they must do if\r\nthey would now undo what they then did, he will unavoidably state a\r\ncase of revolution.\r\n\r\nLet us see if it be not so. He must state, in the first place, that the\r\npeople of the several States adopted and ratified this Constitution, or\r\nform of government; and, in the next place, he must state that they\r\nhave a right to undo this; that is to say, that they have a right to\r\ndiscard the form of government which they have adopted, and to break up\r\nthe Constitution which they have ratified. Now, Sir, this is neither\r\nmore nor less than saying that they have a right to make a revolution.\r\nTo reject an established government, to break up a political\r\nconstitution, is revolution.\r\n\r\nI deny that any man can state accurately what was done by the people,\r\nin establishing the present Constitution, and then state accurately\r\nwhat the people, or any part of them, must now do to get rid of its\r\nobligations, without stating an undeniable case of the overthrow of\r\ngovernment. I admit, of course, that the people may, if they choose,\r\noverthrow the government. But, then, that is revolution. The doctrine\r\nhow contended for is, that, by _nullification_, or _secession_, the\r\nobligations and authority of the government may be set aside or\r\nrejected, without revolution. But that is what I deny; and what I say\r\nis, that no man can state the case with historical accuracy, and in\r\nconstitutional language, without showing that the honorable gentleman's\r\nright, as asserted in his conclusion, is a revolutionary right merely;\r\nthat it does not and cannot exist under the Constitution, or agreeably\r\nto the Constitution, but can come into existence only when the\r\nConstitution is overthrown. This is the reason, Sir, which makes it\r\nnecessary to abandon the use of constitutional language for a new\r\nvocabulary, and to substitute, in the place of plain historical facts,\r\na series of assumptions. This is the reason why it is necessary to give\r\nnew names to things, to speak of the Constitution, not as a\r\nconstitution, but as a compact, and of the ratifications by the people,\r\nnot as ratifications, but as acts of accession.\r\n\r\nSir, I intend to hold the gentlemen to the written record. In the\r\ndiscussion of a constitutional question, I intend to impose upon him\r\nthe restraints of constitutional language. The people have ordained a\r\nConstitution; can they reject it without revolution? They have\r\nestablished a form of government; can they overthrow it without\r\nrevolution? These are the true questions.\r\n\r\nAllow me now, Mr. President, to inquire further into the extent of the\r\npropositions contained in the resolutions, and their necessary\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nWhere sovereign communities are parties, there is no essential\r\ndifference between a compact, a confederation, and a league. They all\r\nequally rest on the plighted faith of the sovereign party. A league, or\r\nconfederacy, is but a subsisting or continuing treaty.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman's resolutions, then, affirm, in effect, that these\r\ntwenty-four United States are held together only by a subsisting\r\ntreaty, resting for its fulfilment and continuance on no inherent power\r\nof its own, but on the plighted faith of each State; or, in other\r\nwords, that our Union is but a league; and, as a consequence from this\r\nproposition, they further affirm that, as sovereigns are subject to no\r\nsuperior power, the States must judge, each for itself, of any alleged\r\nviolation of the league; and if such violation be supposed to have\r\noccurred, each may adopt any mode or measure of redress which it shall\r\nthink proper.\r\n\r\nOther consequences naturally follow, too, from the main proposition. If\r\na league between sovereign powers have no limitation as to the time of\r\nits duration, and contain nothing making it perpetual, it subsists only\r\nduring the good pleasure of the parties, although no violation be\r\ncomplained of. If, in the opinion of either party, it be violated, such\r\nparty may say that he will no longer fulfil its obligations on his\r\npart, but will consider the whole league or compact at an end, although\r\nit might be one of its stipulations that it should be perpetual. Upon\r\nthis principle, the Congress of the United States, in 1798, declared\r\nnull and void the treaty of alliance between the United States and\r\nFrance, though it professed to be a perpetual alliance.\r\n\r\nIf the violation of the league be accompanied with serious injuries,\r\nthe suffering party, being sole judge of his own mode and measure of\r\nredress, has a right to indemnify himself by reprisals on the offending\r\nmembers of the league; and reprisals, if the circumstances of the case\r\nrequire it, may be followed by direct, avowed, and public war.\r\n\r\nThe necessary import of the resolution, therefore, is that the United\r\nStates are connected only by a league; that it is in the good pleasure\r\nof every State to decide how long she will choose to remain a member of\r\nthis league; that any State may determine the extent of her own\r\nobligations under it, and accept or reject what shall be decided by the\r\nwhole; that she may also determine whether her rights have been\r\nviolated, what is the extent of the injury done her, and what mode and\r\nmeasure of redress her wrongs may make it fit and expedient for her to\r\nadopt. The result of the whole is, that any State may secede at\r\npleasure; that any State may resist a law which she herself may choose\r\nto say exceeds the power of Congress; and that, as a sovereign power,\r\nshe may redress her own grievances, by her own arm, at her own\r\ndiscretion. She may make reprisals; she may cruise against the property\r\nof other members of the league; she may authorize captures, and make\r\nopen war.\r\n\r\nIf, Sir, this be our political condition, it is time the people of the\r\nUnited States understood it. Let us look for a moment to the practical\r\nconsequences of these opinions. One State, holding an embargo law\r\nunconstitutional, may declare her opinion, and withdraw from the Union.\r\n_She_ secedes. Another, forming and expressing the same judgment on a\r\nlaw laying duties on imports, may withdraw also. _She_ secedes. And as,\r\nin her opinion, money has been taken out of the pockets of her citizens\r\nillegally, under pretence of this law, and as she has power to redress\r\ntheir wrongs, she may demand satisfaction; and, if refused, she may\r\ntake it with a strong hand. The gentleman has himself pronounced the\r\ncollection of duties, under existing laws, to be nothing but robbery.\r\nRobbers, of course, may be rightfully dispossessed of the fruits of\r\ntheir flagitious crimes; and therefore, reprisals, impositions on the\r\ncommerce of other States, foreign alliances against them, or open war,\r\nare all modes of redress justly open to the discretion and choice of\r\nSouth Carolina; for she is to judge of her own rights, and to seek\r\nsatisfaction for her own wrongs, in her own way.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, a _third_ State is of opinion, not only that these laws of\r\nimposts are constitutional, but that it is the absolute duty of\r\nCongress to pass and to maintain such laws; and that, by omitting to\r\npass and maintain them, its constitutional obligations would be grossly\r\ndisregarded. She herself relinquished the power of protection, she\r\nmight allege, and allege truly, and gave it up to Congress, on the\r\nfaith that Congress would exercise it. If Congress now refuse to\r\nexercise it, Congress does, as she may insist, break the condition of\r\nthe grant, and thus manifestly violate the Constitution; and for this\r\nviolation of the Constitution, _she_ may threaten to secede also.\r\nVirginia may secede, and hold the fortresses in the Chesapeake. The\r\nWestern States may secede, and take to their own use the public lands.\r\nLouisiana may secede, if she choose, form a foreign alliance, and hold\r\nthe mouth of the Mississippi. If one State may secede, ten may do so,\r\ntwenty may do so, twenty-three may do so. Sir, as these secessions go\r\non, one after another, what is to constitute the United States? Whose\r\nwill be the army? Whose the navy? Who will pay the debts? Who fulfil\r\nthe public treaties? Who perform the constitutional guaranties? Who\r\ngovern this District and the Territories? Who retain the public\r\nproperty?\r\n\r\nMr. President, every man must see that these are all questions which\r\ncan arise only _after a revolution_. They presuppose the breaking up of\r\nthe government. While the Constitution lasts, they are repressed; they\r\nspring up to annoy and startle us only from its grave.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution does not provide for events which must be preceded by\r\nits own destruction. SECESSION, therefore, since it must bring these\r\nconsequences with it, is REVOLUTIONARY, and NULLIFICATION is equally\r\nREVOLUTIONARY. What is revolution? Why, Sir, that is revolution which\r\noverturns, or controls, or successfully resists, the existing public\r\nauthority; that which arrests the exercise of the supreme power; that\r\nwhich introduces a new paramount authority into the rule of the State.\r\nNow, Sir, this is the precise object of nullification. It attempts to\r\nsupersede the supreme legislative authority. It arrests the arm of the\r\nexecutive magistrate. It interrupts the exercise of the accustomed\r\njudicial power. Under the name of an ordinance, it declares null and\r\nvoid, within the State, all the revenue laws of the United States. Is\r\nnot this revolutionary? Sir, so soon as this ordinance shall be carried\r\ninto effect, a _revolution_ will have commenced in South Carolina. She\r\nwill have thrown off the authority to which her citizens have\r\nheretofore been subject. She will have declared her own opinions and\r\nher own will to be above the laws and above the power of those who are\r\nintrusted with their administration. If she makes good these\r\ndeclarations, she is revolutionized. As to her, it is as distinctly a\r\nchange of the supreme power as the American Revolution of 1776. That\r\nrevolution did not subvert government in all its forms. It did not\r\nsubvert local laws and municipal administrations. It only threw off the\r\ndominion of a power claiming to be superior, and to have a right, in\r\nmany important respects, to exercise legislative authority. Thinking\r\nthis authority to have been usurped or abused, the American Colonies,\r\nnow the United States, bade it defiance, and freed themselves from it\r\nby means of a revolution. But that revolution left them with their own\r\nmunicipal laws still, and the forms of local government. If Carolina\r\nnow shall effectually resist the laws of Congress; if she shall be her\r\nown judge, take her remedy into her own hands, obey the laws of the\r\nUnion when she pleases and disobey them when she pleases, she will\r\nrelieve herself from a paramount power as distinctly as the American\r\nColonies did the same thing in 1776. In other words, she will achieve,\r\nas to herself, a revolution.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, while practical nullification in South Carolina would be, as\r\nto herself, actual and distinct revolution, its necessary tendency must\r\nalso be to spread revolution, and to break up the Constitution, as to\r\nall the other States. It strikes a deadly blow at the vital principle\r\nof the whole Union. To allow State resistance to the laws of Congress\r\nto be rightful and proper, to admit nullification in some States, and\r\nyet not expect to see a dismemberment of the entire government, appears\r\nto me the wildest illusion, and the most extravagant folly. The\r\ngentleman seems not conscious of the direction or the rapidity of his\r\nown course. The current of his opinions sweeps him along, he knows not\r\nwhither. To begin with nullification, with the avowed intent,\r\nnevertheless, not to proceed to secession, dismemberment, and general\r\nrevolution, is as if one were to take the plunge of Niagara, and cry\r\nout that he would stop half-way down. In the one case, as in the other,\r\nthe rash adventurer must go to the bottom of the dark abyss below, were\r\nit not that that abyss has no discovered bottom.\r\n\r\nNullification, if successful, arrests the power of the law, absolves\r\ncitizens from their duty, subverts the foundation both of protection\r\nand obedience, dispenses with oaths and obligations of allegiance, and\r\nelevates another authority to supreme command. Is not this revolution?\r\nAnd it raises to supreme command four-and-twenty distinct powers, each\r\nprofessing to be under a general government, and yet each setting its\r\nlaws at defiance at pleasure. Is not this anarchy, as well as\r\nrevolution? Sir, the Constitution of the United States was received as\r\na whole, and for the whole country. If it cannot stand altogether, it\r\ncannot stand in parts; and if the laws cannot be executed everywhere,\r\nthey cannot long be executed anywhere. The gentleman very well knows\r\nthat all duties and imposts must be uniform throughout the country. He\r\nknows that we cannot have one rule or one law for South Carolina, and\r\nanother for other States. He must see, therefore, and does see, and\r\nevery man sees, that the only alternative is a repeal of the laws\r\nthroughout the whole Union, or their execution in Carolina as well as\r\nelsewhere. And this repeal is demanded because a single State\r\ninterposes her veto, and threatens resistance! The result of the\r\ngentleman's opinion, or rather the very text of his doctrine, is, that\r\nno act of Congress can bind all the States, the constitutionality of\r\nwhich is not admitted by all; or, in other words, that no single State\r\nis bound, against its own dissent, by a law of imposts. This is\r\nprecisely the evil experienced under the old Confederation, and for\r\nremedy of which this Constitution was adopted. The leading object in\r\nestablishing this government, an object forced on the country by the\r\nconditions of the times and the absolute necessity of the law, was to\r\ngive to Congress power to lay and collect imposts _without the consent\r\nof particular States_. The Revolutionary debt remained unpaid; the\r\nnational treasury was bankrupt; the country was destitute of credit;\r\nCongress issued its requisitions on the States, and the States\r\nneglected them; there was no power of coercion but war, Congress could\r\nnot lay imposts, or other taxes, by its own authority; the whole\r\ngeneral government, therefore, was little more than a name. The\r\nArticles of Confederation, as to purposes of revenue and finance, were\r\nnearly a dead letter. The country sought to escape from this condition,\r\nat once feeble and disgraceful, by constituting a government which\r\nshould have power, of itself, to lay duties and taxes, and to pay the\r\npublic debt, and provide for the general welfare; and to lay these\r\nduties and taxes in all the States, without asking the consent of the\r\nState governments. This was the very power on which the new\r\nConstitution was to depend for all its ability to do good; and without\r\nit, it can be no government, now or at any time. Yet, Sir, it is\r\nprecisely against this power, so absolutely indispensable to the very\r\nbeing of the government, that South Carolina directs her ordinance. She\r\nattacks the government in its authority to raise revenue, the very\r\nmainspring of the whole system; and if she succeed, every movement of\r\nthat system must inevitably cease. It is of no avail that she declares\r\nthat she does not resist the law as a revenue law, but as a law for\r\nprotecting manufacturers. It is a revenue law; it is the very law by\r\nforce of which the revenue is collected; if it be arrested in any\r\nState, the revenue ceases in that State; it is, in a word, the sole\r\nreliance of the government for the means of maintaining itself and\r\nperforming its duties.\r\n\r\nMr. President, the alleged right of a State to decide constitutional\r\nquestions for herself necessarily leads to force because other States\r\nmust have the same right, and because different States will decide\r\ndifferently; and when these questions arise between States, if there be\r\nno superior power, they can be decided only by the law of force. On\r\nentering into the Union, the people of each State gave up a part of\r\ntheir own power to make laws for themselves, in consideration, that, as\r\nto common objects, they should have a part in making laws for other\r\nStates. In other words, the people of all the States agreed to create a\r\ncommon government, to be conducted by common counsels. Pennsylvania,\r\nfor example, yielded the right of laying imposts in her own ports, in\r\nconsideration that the new government, in which she was to have a\r\nshare, should possess the power of laying imposts on all the States. If\r\nSouth Carolina now refuses to submit to this power, she breaks the\r\ncondition on which other States entered into the Union. She partakes of\r\nthe common counsels, and therein assists to bind others, while she\r\nrefuses to be bound herself. It makes no difference in the case whether\r\nshe does all this without reason or pretext, or whether she sets up as\r\na reason, that, in her judgment, the acts complained of are\r\nunconstitutional. In the judgment of other States, they are not so. It\r\nis nothing to them that she offers some reason or some apology for her\r\nconduct, if it be one which they do not admit. It is not to be expected\r\nthat any State will violate her duty without some plausible pretext.\r\nThat would be too rash a defiance of the opinion of mankind. But if it\r\nbe a pretext which lies in her own breast, if it be no more than an\r\nopinion which she says she has formed, how can other States be\r\nsatisfied with this? How can they allow her to be judge of her own\r\nobligations? Or, if she may judge of her obligations, may they not\r\njudge of their rights also? May not the twenty-three entertain an\r\nopinion as well as the twenty-fourth? And if it be their right, in\r\ntheir own opinion, as expressed in the common council, to enforce the\r\nlaw against her, how is she to say that her right and her opinion are\r\nto be every thing, and their right and their opinion nothing?\r\n\r\nMr. President, if we are to receive the Constitution as the text, and\r\nthen to lay down in its margin the contradictory commentaries which\r\nhave been, and which may be, made by different States, the whole page\r\nwould be a polyglot indeed. It would speak with as many tongues as the\r\nbuilders of Babel, and in dialects as much confused, and mutually as\r\nunintelligible. The very instance now before us presents a practical\r\nillustration. The law of the last session is declared unconstitutional\r\nin South Carolina, and in obedience to it is refused. In other States,\r\nit is admitted to be strictly constitutional. You walk over the limit\r\nof its authority, therefore, when you pass a State line. On one side it\r\nis law, on the other side a nullity; and yet it is passed by a common\r\ngovernment, having the same authority in all the States.\r\n\r\nSuch, Sir, are the inevitable results of this doctrine. Beginning with\r\nthe original error, that the Constitution of the United States is\r\nnothing but a compact between sovereign States; asserting, in the next\r\nstep, that each State has a right to be its own sole judge of the\r\nextent of its own obligations, and consequently of the\r\nconstitutionality of laws of Congress; and, in the next, that it may\r\noppose whatever it sees fit to declare unconstitutional, and that it\r\ndecides for itself on the mode and measure of redress,--the argument\r\narrives at once at the conclusion, that what a State dissents from, it\r\nmay nullify; what it opposes, it may oppose by force; what it decides\r\nfor itself, it may execute by its own power; and that, in short, it is\r\nitself supreme over the legislation of Congress, and supreme over the\r\ndecisions of the national judicature; supreme over the constitution of\r\nthe country, supreme over the supreme law of the land. However it seeks\r\nto protect itself against these plain inferences, by saying that an\r\nunconstitutional law is no law, and that it only opposes such laws as\r\nare unconstitutional, yet this does not in the slightest degree vary\r\nthe result; since it insists on deciding this question for itself; and,\r\nin opposition to reason and argument, in opposition to practice and\r\nexperience, in opposition to the judgment of others, having an equal\r\nright to judge, it says, only, \"Such is my opinion, and my opinion\r\nshall be my law, and I will support it by my own strong hand. I\r\ndenounce the law; I declare it unconstitutional; that is enough; it\r\nshall not be executed. Men in arms are ready to resist its execution.\r\nAn attempt to enforce it shall cover the land with blood. Elsewhere it\r\nmay be binding; but here it is trampled under foot.\" This, Sir, is\r\npractical nullification.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, against all these theories and opinions, I maintain,--\r\n\r\n1. That the Constitution of the United States is not a league,\r\nconfederacy, or compact between the people of the several States in\r\ntheir sovereign capacities; but a government proper, founded on the\r\nadoption of the people, and creating direct relations between itself\r\nand individuals.\r\n\r\n2. That no State authority has power to dissolve these relations; that\r\nnothing can dissolve them but revolution; and that, consequently, there\r\ncan be no such thing as secession without revolution.\r\n\r\n3. That there is a supreme law, consisting of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, and acts of Congress passed in pursuance of it, and\r\ntreaties; and that, in cases not capable of assuming the character of a\r\nsuit in law or equity, Congress must judge of, and finally interpret,\r\nthis supreme law so often as it has occasion to pass acts of\r\nlegislation; and in cases capable of assuming, and actually assuming,\r\nthe character of a suit, the Supreme Court of the United States is the\r\nfinal interpreter.\r\n\r\n4. That an attempt by a State to abrogate, annul, or nullify an act of\r\nCongress, or to arrest its operation within her limits, on the ground\r\nthat, in her opinion, such law is unconstitutional, is a direct\r\nusurpation on the just powers of the general government, and on the\r\nequal rights of other States; a plain violation of the Constitution,\r\nand a proceeding essentially revolutionary in its character and\r\ntendency.\r\n\r\nWhether the Constitution be a compact between States in their sovereign\r\ncapacities, is a question which must be mainly argued from what is\r\ncontained in the instrument itself. We all agree that it is an\r\ninstrument which has been in some way clothed with power. We all admit\r\nthat it speaks with authority. The first question then is, What does it\r\nsay of itself? What does it purport to be? Does it style itself a\r\nleague, confederacy, or compact between sovereign States? It is to be\r\nremembered, Sir, that the Constitution began to speak only after its\r\nadoption. Until it was ratified by nine States, it was but a proposal,\r\nthe mere draught of an instrument. It was like a deed drawn, but not\r\nexecuted. The Convention had framed it; sent it to Congress, then\r\nsitting under the Confederation; Congress had transmitted it to the\r\nState legislatures; and by these last it was laid before conventions of\r\nthe people in the several States. All this while it was inoperative\r\npaper. It had received no stamp of authority, no sanction; it spoke no\r\nlanguage. But when ratified by the people in their respective\r\nconventions, then it had a voice, and spoke authentically. Every word\r\nin it had then received the sanction of the popular will, and was to be\r\nreceived as the expression of that will. What the Constitution says of\r\nitself, therefore, is as conclusive as what it says on any other point.\r\nDoes it call itself a \"compact\"? Certainly not. It uses the word\r\n_compact_ but once, and that is when it declares that the States shall\r\nenter into no compact. Does it call itself a \"league,\" a \"confederacy,\"\r\na \"subsisting treaty between the States\"? Certainly not. There is not a\r\nparticle of such language in all its pages. But it declares itself a\r\nCONSTITUTION. What is a _constitution_? Certainly not a league,\r\ncompact, or confederacy, but a _fundamental law_. That fundamental\r\nregulation which determines the manner in which the public authority is\r\nto be executed, is what forms the _constitution_ of a state. Those\r\nprimary rules which concern the body itself, and the very being of the\r\npolitical society, the form of government, and the manner in which\r\npower is to be exercised,--all, in a word, which form together the\r\n_constitution of a state_,--these are the fundamental laws. This, Sir,\r\nis the language of the public writers. But do we need to be informed,\r\nin this country, what a _constitution_ is? Is it not an idea perfectly\r\nfamiliar, definite, and settled? We are at no loss to understand what\r\nis meant by the constitution of one of the States; and the Constitution\r\nof the United States speaks of itself as being an instrument of the\r\nsame nature. It says this _Constitution_ shall be the law of the land,\r\nanything in any State _constitution_ to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\nAnd it speaks of itself, too, in plain contradistinction from a\r\nconfederation; for it says that all debts contracted, and all\r\nengagements entered into, by the United States, shall be as valid under\r\nthis _Constitution_ as under the _Confederation_. It does not say, as\r\nvalid under this _compact_, or this league, or this confederation, as\r\nunder the former confederation, but as valid under this _Constitution_.\r\n\r\nThis, then, Sir, is declared to be a _constitution_. A constitution is\r\nthe fundamental law of the state; and this is expressly declared to be\r\nthe supreme law. It is as if the people had said, \"We prescribe this\r\nfundamental law,\" or \"this supreme law,\" for they do say that they\r\nestablish this Constitution, and that it shall be the supreme law. They\r\nsay that they _ordain and establish_ it. Now, Sir, what is the common\r\napplication of these words? We do not speak of ordaining leagues and\r\ncompacts. If this was intended to be a compact or league, and the\r\nStates to be parties to it, why was it not so said? Why is there found\r\nno one expression in the whole instrument indicating such intent? The\r\nold Confederation was expressly called a _league_, and into this league\r\nit was declared that the States, as States, severally entered. Why was\r\nnot similar language used in the Constitution, if a similar intention\r\nhad existed? Why was it not said, \"the States enter into this new\r\nleague,\" \"the States form this new confederation,\" or \"the States agree\r\nto this new compact\"? Or why was it not said, in the language of the\r\ngentleman's resolution, that the people of the several States acceded\r\nto this compact in their sovereign capacities? What reason is there for\r\nsupposing that the framers of the Constitution rejected expressions\r\nappropriate to their own meaning, and adopted others wholly at war with\r\nthat meaning?\r\n\r\nAgain, Sir, the Constitution speaks of that political system which is\r\nestablished as \"the government of the United States.\" Is it not doing\r\nstrange violence to language to call a league or a compact between\r\nsovereign powers a _government_? The government of a state is that\r\norganization in which the political power resides. It is the political\r\nbeing created by the constitution or fundamental law. The broad and\r\nclear difference between a government and a league or compact is, that\r\na government is a body politic; it has a will of its own; and it\r\npossesses powers and faculties to execute its own purposes. Every\r\ncompact looks to some power to enforce its stipulations. Even in a\r\ncompact between sovereign communities, there always exists this\r\nultimate reference to a power to insure its execution; although, in\r\nsuch case, this power is but the force of one party against the force\r\nof another; that is to say, the power of war. But a _government_\r\nexecutes its decisions by its own supreme authority. Its use of force\r\nin compelling obedience to its own enactments is not war. It\r\ncontemplates no opposing party having a right of resistance. It rests\r\non its own power to enforce its own will; and when it ceases to possess\r\nthis power, it is no longer a government.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I concur so generally to the very able speech of the\r\ngentleman from Virginia near me [1], that it is not without diffidence\r\nand regret that I venture to differ with him on any point. His\r\nopinions, Sir, are redolent of the doctrines of a very distinguished\r\nschool, for which I have the highest regard, of whose doctrines I can\r\nsay, what I can also say of the gentleman's speech, that, while I\r\nconcur in the results, I must be permitted to hesitate about some of\r\nthe premises. I do not agree that the Constitution is a compact between\r\nStates in their sovereign capacities. I do not agree, that, in\r\nstrictness of language, it is a compact at all. But I do agree that it\r\nis founded on consent or agreement, or on compact, if the gentleman\r\nprefers that word, and means no more by it than voluntary consent or\r\nagreement. The Constitution, Sir, is not a contract, but the result of\r\na contract; meaning by contract no more than assent. Founded on\r\nconsent, it is a government proper. Adopted by the agreement of the\r\npeople of the United States, when adopted, it has become a\r\nConstitution. The people have agreed to make a Constitution; but when\r\nmade, that Constitution becomes what its name imports. It is no longer\r\na mere agreement. Our laws, Sir, have their foundation in the agreement\r\nor consent of the two houses of Congress. We say, habitually, that one\r\nhouse proposes a bill, and the other agrees to it; but the result of\r\nthis agreement is not a compact, but a law. The law, the statute, is\r\nnot the agreement, but something created by the agreement; and\r\nsomething which, when created, has a new character, and acts by its own\r\nauthority. So the Constitution of the United States, founded in or on\r\nthe consent of the people, may be said to rest on compact or consent;\r\nbut it is not itself the compact, but its result. When the people agree\r\nto erect a government, and actually erect it, the thing is done, and\r\nthe agreement is at an end. The compact is executed, and the end\r\ndesigned by it attained. Henceforth, the fruit of the agreement exists,\r\nbut the agreement itself is merged in its own accomplishment; since\r\nthere can be no longer a subsisting agreement or compact _to form_ a\r\nconstitution or government, after that constitution or government has\r\nbeen actually formed and established.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me, Mr. President, that the plainest account of the\r\nestablishment of this government presents the most just and\r\nphilosophical view of its foundation. The people of the several States\r\nhad their separate State governments; and between the States there also\r\nexisted a Confederation. With this condition of things the people were\r\nnot satisfied, as the Confederation had been found not to fulfil its\r\nintended objects. It was _proposed_, therefore, to erect a new, common\r\ngovernment, which should possess certain definite powers, such as\r\nregarded the prosperity of the people of all the States, and to be\r\nformed upon the general model of American constitutions. This proposal\r\nwas assented to, and an instrument was presented to the people of the\r\nseveral States for their consideration. They approved it, and agreed to\r\nadopt it, as a Constitution. They executed that agreement; they adopted\r\nthe Constitution as a Constitution, and henceforth it must stand as a\r\nConstitution until it shall be altogether destroyed. Now, Sir, is not\r\nthis the truth of the whole matter? And is not all that we have heard\r\nof compact between sovereign States the mere effect of a theoretical\r\nand artificial mode of reasoning upon the subject? a mode of reasoning\r\nwhich disregards plain facts for the sake of hypothesis?\r\n\r\nMr. President, the nature of sovereignty or sovereign power has been\r\nextensively discussed by gentlemen on this occasion, as it generally is\r\nwhen the origin of our government is debated. But I confess myself not\r\nentirely satisfied with arguments and illustrations drawn from that\r\ntopic. The sovereignty of government is an idea belonging to the other\r\nside of the Atlantic. No such thing is known in North America. Our\r\ngovernments are all limited. In Europe, sovereignty is of feudal\r\norigin, and imports no more than the state of the sovereign. It\r\ncomprises his rights, duties, exemptions, prerogatives, and powers. But\r\nwith us, all power is with the people. They alone are sovereign; and\r\nthey erect what governments they please, and confer on them such powers\r\nas they please. None of these governments is sovereign, in the European\r\nsense of the word, all being restrained by written constitutions. It\r\nseems to me, therefore, that we only perplex ourselves when we attempt\r\nto explain the relations existing between the general government and\r\nthe several State governments according to those ideas of sovereignty\r\nwhich prevail under systems essentially different from our own.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, to return to the Constitution itself; let me inquire what it\r\nrelies upon for its own continuance and support. I hear it often\r\nsuggested, that the States, by refusing to appoint Senators and\r\nElectors, might bring this government to an end. Perhaps that is true;\r\nbut the same may be said of the State governments themselves. Suppose\r\nthe legislature of a State, having the power to appoint the governor\r\nand the judges, should omit that duty, would not the State government\r\nremain unorganized? No doubt, all elective governments may be broken up\r\nby a general abandonment on the part of those intrusted with political\r\npowers of their appropriate duties. But one popular government has, in\r\nthis respect, as much security as another. The maintenance of this\r\nConstitution does not depend on the plighted faith of the States, as\r\nStates, to support it; and this again shows that it is not a league. It\r\nrelies on individual duty and obligation.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States creates direct relations between\r\nthis government and individuals. This government may punish individuals\r\nfor treason, and all other crimes in the code, when committed against\r\nthe United States. It has power also to tax individuals, in any mode\r\nand to any extent; and it possesses the further power of demanding from\r\nindividuals military service. Nothing, certainly, can more clearly\r\ndistinguish a government from a confederation of states than the\r\npossession of these powers. No closer relations can exist between\r\nindividuals and any government.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the government owes high and solemn duties to every\r\ncitizen of the country. It is bound to protect him in his most\r\nimportant rights and interests. It makes war for his protection, and no\r\nother government in the country can make war. It makes peace for his\r\nprotection, and no other government can make peace. It maintains armies\r\nand navies for his defence and security, and no other government is\r\nallowed to maintain them. He goes abroad beneath its flag, and carries\r\nover all the earth a national character imparted to him by this\r\ngovernment, and which no other government can impart. In whatever\r\nrelates to war, to peace, to commerce, he knows no other government.\r\nAll these, Sir, are connections as dear and as sacred as can bind\r\nindividuals to any government on earth. It is not, therefore, a compact\r\nbetween States, but a government proper, operating directly upon\r\nindividuals, yielding to them protection on the one hand, and demanding\r\nfrom them obedience on the other.\r\n\r\nThere is no language in the whole Constitution applicable to a\r\nconfederation of States. If the States be parties, as States, what are\r\ntheir rights, and what their respective covenants and stipulations? And\r\nwhere are their rights, covenants, and stipulations expressed? The\r\nStates engage for nothing, they promise nothing. In the Articles of\r\nConfederation, they did make promises, and did enter into engagements,\r\nand did plight the faith of each State for their fulfilment; but In the\r\nConstitution there is nothing of that kind. The reason is, that, in the\r\nConstitution, it is the _people_ who speak, and not the States. The\r\npeople ordain the Constitution, and therein address themselves to the\r\nStates, and to the legislatures of the States, in the language of\r\ninjunction and prohibition. The Constitution utters its behests in the\r\nname and by authority of the people, and it does not exact from States\r\nany plighted public faith to maintain it. On the contrary, it makes its\r\nown preservation depend on individual duty and individual obligation.\r\nSir, the States cannot omit to appoint Senators and Electors. It is not\r\na matter resting in State discretion or State pleasure. The\r\nConstitution has taken better care of its own preservation. It lays its\r\nhand on individual conscience and individual duty. It incapacitates any\r\nman to sit in the legislature of a State who shall not first have taken\r\nhis solemn oath to support the Constitution of the United States. From\r\nthe obligation of this oath no State power can discharge him. All the\r\nmembers of all the State legislatures are as religiously bound to\r\nsupport the Constitution of the United States as they are to support\r\ntheir own State constitution. Nay, Sir, they are as solemnly sworn to\r\nsupport it as we ourselves are, who are members of Congress.\r\n\r\nNo member of a State legislature can refuse to proceed, at the proper\r\ntime, to elect Senators to Congress, or to provide for the choice of\r\nElectors of President and Vice-President, any more than the members of\r\nthis Senate can refuse, when the appointed day arrives, to meet the\r\nmembers of the other house, to count the votes for those officers, and\r\nascertain who are chosen. In both cases, the duty binds, and with equal\r\nstrength, the conscience of the individual member, and it is imposed on\r\nall by an oath in the same words. Let it then never be said, Sir, that\r\nit is a matter of discretion with the States whether they will continue\r\nthe government, or break it up by refusing to appoint Senators and to\r\nelect Electors. They have no discretion in the matter. The members of\r\ntheir legislatures cannot avoid doing either, so often as the time\r\narrives, without a direct violation of their duty and their oaths; such\r\na violation as would break up any other government.\r\n\r\nLooking still further to the provisions of the Constitution itself, in\r\norder to learn its true character, we find its great apparent purpose\r\nto be, to unite the people of all the States under one general\r\ngovernment, for certain definite objects, and, to the extent of this\r\nunion, to restrain the separate authority of the States. Congress only\r\ncan declare war; therefore, when one State is at war with a foreign\r\nnation, all must be at war. The President and the Senate only can make\r\npeace; when peace is made for one State, therefore, it must be made for\r\nall.\r\n\r\nCan anything be conceived more preposterous, than that any State should\r\nhave power to nullify the proceedings of the general government\r\nrespecting peace and war? When war is declared by a law of Congress,\r\ncan a single State nullify that law, and remain at peace? And yet she\r\nmay nullify that law as well as any other. If the President and Senate\r\nmake peace, may one State, nevertheless, continue the war? And yet, if\r\nshe can nullify a law, she may quite as well nullify a treaty.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, Mr. President, and no ingenuity of argument, no subtilty\r\nof distinction can evade it, that, as to certain purposes, the people\r\nof the United States are one people. They are one in making war, and\r\none in making peace; they are one in regulating commerce, and one in\r\nlaying duties of imposts. The very end and purpose of the Constitution\r\nwas, to make them one people in these particulars; and it has\r\neffectually accomplished its object. All this is apparent on the face\r\nof the Constitution itself. I have already said, Sir, that to obtain a\r\npower of direct legislation over the people, especially in regard to\r\nimposts, was always prominent as a reason for getting rid of the\r\nConfederation, and forming a new Constitution. Among innumerable proofs\r\nof this, before the assembling of the Convention, allow me to refer\r\nonly to the report of the committee of the old Congress, July, 1785.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, let us go to the actual formation of the Constitution; let us\r\nopen the journal of the Convention itself, and we shall see that the\r\nvery first resolution which the Convention adopted was, \"That a\r\nnational government ought to be established, consisting of a supreme\r\nlegislature, judiciary, and executive.\"\r\n\r\nThis itself completely negatives all idea of league, and compact, and\r\nconfederation. Terms could not be chosen more fit to express an\r\nintention to establish a national government, and to banish for ever\r\nall notion of a compact between sovereign States.\r\n\r\nThis resolution was adopted on the 30th of May, 1787. Afterwards, the\r\nstyle was altered, and, instead of being called a national government,\r\nit was called the government of the United States; but the substance of\r\nthis resolution was retained, and was at the head of that list of\r\nresolutions which was afterwards sent to the committee who were to\r\nframe the instrument.\r\n\r\nIt is true, there were gentlemen in the Convention, who were for\r\nretaining the Confederation, and amending its Articles; but the\r\nmajority was against this, and was for a national government. Mr.\r\nPatterson's propositions, which were for continuing the Articles of\r\nConfederation with additional powers, were submitted to the Convention\r\non the 15th of June, and referred to the committee of the whole. The\r\nresolutions forming the basis of a national government, which had once\r\nbeen agreed to in the committee of the whole, and reported, were\r\nrecommitted to the same committee, on the same day. The Convention,\r\nthen, in committee of the whole, on the 19th of June, had both these\r\nplans before them; that is to say, the plan of a confederacy, or\r\ncompact, between States, and the plan of a national government. Both\r\nthese plans were considered and debated, and the committee reported,\r\n\"That they do not agree to the propositions offered by the honorable\r\nMr. Patterson, but that they again submit the resolutions formerly\r\nreported.\" If, Sir, any historical fact in the world be plain and\r\nundeniable, it is that the Convention deliberated on the expediency of\r\ncontinuing the Confederation, with some amendments, and rejected that\r\nscheme, and adopted the plan of a national government, with a\r\nlegislature, an executive, and a judiciary of its own. They were asked\r\nto preserve the league; they rejected the proposition. They were asked\r\nto continue the existing compact between States; they rejected it. They\r\nrejected compact, league, and confederation, and set themselves about\r\nframing the constitution of a national government; and they\r\naccomplished what they undertook.\r\n\r\nIf men will open their eyes fairly to the lights of history, it is\r\nimpossible to be deceived on this point. The great object was to\r\nsupersede the Confederation by a regular government; because, under the\r\nConfederation, Congress had power only to make requisitions on States;\r\nand if States declined compliance, as they did, there was no remedy but\r\nwar against such delinquent States. It would seem, from Mr. Jefferson's\r\ncorrespondence, in 1786 and 1787, that he was of opinion that even this\r\nremedy ought to be tried. \"There will be no money in the treasury,\"\r\nsaid he, \"till the confederacy shows its teeth\"; and he suggests that a\r\nsingle frigate would soon levy, on the commerce of a delinquent State,\r\nthe deficiency of its contribution. But this would be war; and it was\r\nevident that a confederacy could not long hold together, which should\r\nbe at war with its members. The Constitution was adopted to avoid this\r\nnecessity. It was adopted that there might be a government which should\r\nact directly on individuals, without borrowing aid from the State\r\ngovernments. This is clear as light itself on the very face of the\r\nprovisions of the Constitution, and its whole history tends to the same\r\nconclusion. Its framers gave this very reason for their work in the\r\nmost distinct terms. Allow me to quote but one or two proofs, out of\r\nhundreds. That State, so small in territory, but so distinguished for\r\nlearning and talent, Connecticut, had sent to the general Convention,\r\namong other members, Samuel Johnston and Oliver Ellsworth. The\r\nConstitution having been framed, it was submitted to a convention of\r\nthe people of Connecticut for ratification on the part of that State;\r\nand Mr. Johnston and Mr. Ellsworth were also members of this\r\nconvention. On the first day of the debates, being called on to explain\r\nthe reasons which led the Convention at Philadelphia to recommend such\r\na Constitution, after showing the insufficiency of the existing\r\nconfederacy, inasmuch as it applied to States, as States, Mr. Johnston\r\nproceeded to say:--\r\n\r\n\"The Convention saw this imperfection in attempting to legislate for\r\nStates in their political capacity, that the coercion of law can be\r\nexercised by nothing but a military force. They have, therefore, gone\r\nupon entirely new ground. They have formed one new nation out of the\r\nindividual States. The Constitution vests in the general legislature a\r\npower to make laws in matters of national concern; to appoint judges to\r\ndecide upon these laws; and to appoint officers to carry them into\r\nexecution. This excludes the idea of an armed force. The power which is\r\nto enforce these laws is to be a legal power, vested in proper\r\nmagistrates. The force which is to be employed is the energy of law;\r\nand this force is to operate only upon individuals who fail in their\r\nduty to their country. This is the peculiar glory of the Constitution,\r\nthat it depends upon the mild and equal energy of the magistracy for\r\nthe execution of the laws.\"\r\n\r\nIn the further course of the debate, Mr. Ellsworth said:--\r\n\r\n\"In republics, it is a fundamental principle, that the majority govern,\r\nand that the minority comply with the general voice. How contrary,\r\nthen, to republican principles, how humiliating, is our present\r\nsituation! A single State can rise up, and put a veto upon the most\r\nimportant public measures. We have seen this actually take place; a\r\nsingle State has controlled the general voice of the Union; a minority,\r\na very small minority, has governed us. So far is this from being\r\nconsistent with republican principles, that it is, in effect, the worst\r\nspecies of monarchy.\r\n\r\n\"Hence we see how necessary for the Union is a coercive principle. No\r\nman pretends the contrary. We all see and feel this necessity. The only\r\nquestion is, Shall it be a coercion of law, or a coercion of arms?\r\nThere is no other possible alternative. Where will those who oppose a\r\ncoercion of law come out? Where will they end? A necessary consequence\r\nof their principles is a war of the States one against another. I am\r\nfor coercion by law; that coercion which acts only upon delinquent\r\nindividuals. This Constitution does not attempt to coerce sovereign\r\nbodies, States, in their political capacity. No coercion is applicable\r\nto such bodies, but that of an armed force. If we should attempt to\r\nexecute the laws of the Union by sending an armed force against a\r\ndelinquent State, it would involve the good and bad, the innocent and\r\nguilty, in the same calamity. But this legal coercion singles out the\r\nguilty individual, and punishes him for breaking the laws of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, Sir, if we look to all contemporary history, to the numbers of\r\nthe Federalist, to the debates in the conventions, to the publications\r\nof friends and foes, they all agree, that a change had been made from a\r\nconfederacy of States to a different system; they all agree, that the\r\nConvention had formed a Constitution for a national government. With\r\nthis result some were satisfied, and some were dissatisfied; but all\r\nadmitted that the thing had been done. In none of these various\r\nproductions and publications did any one intimate that the new\r\nConstitution was but another compact between States in their sovereign\r\ncapacities. I do not find such an opinion advanced in a single\r\ninstance. Everywhere, the people were told that the old Confederation\r\nwas to be abandoned, and a new system to be tried; that a proper\r\ngovernment was proposed, to be founded in the name of the people, and\r\nto have a regular organization of its own. Everywhere, the people were\r\ntold that it was to be a government with direct powers to make laws\r\nover individuals, and to lay taxes and imposts without the consent of\r\nthe States. Everywhere, it was understood to be a popular Constitution.\r\nIt came to the people for their adoption, and was to rest on the same\r\ndeep foundation as the State constitutions themselves. Its most\r\ndistinguished advocates, who had been themselves members of the\r\nConvention, declared that the very object of submitting the\r\nConstitution to the people was, to preclude the possibility of its\r\nbeing regarded as a mere compact. \"However gross a heresy,\" say the\r\nwriters of the Federalist, \"it may be to maintain that a party to a\r\n_compact_ has a right to revoke that _compact_, the doctrine itself has\r\nhad respectable advocates. The possibility of a question of this nature\r\nproves the necessity of laying the foundations of our national\r\ngovernment deeper than in the mere sanction of delegated authority. The\r\nfabric of American empire ought to rest on the solid basis of THE\r\nCONSENT OF THE PEOPLE.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the language, Sir, addressed to the people, while they yet had\r\nthe Constitution under consideration.  The powers conferred on the new\r\ngovernment were perfectly well understood to be conferred, not by any\r\nState, or the people of any State, but by the people of the United\r\nStates. Virginia is more explicit, perhaps, in this particular, than\r\nany other State. Her convention, assembled to ratify the Constitution,\r\n\"in the name and behalf of the people of Virginia, declare and make\r\nknown, that the powers granted under the Constitution, _being derived\r\nfrom the people of the United States_, may be resumed by them whenever\r\nthe same shall be perverted to their injury or oppression.\"\r\n\r\nIs this language which describes the formation of a compact between\r\nStates? or language describing the grant of powers to a new government,\r\nby the whole people of the United States?\r\n\r\nAmong all the other ratifications, there is not one which speaks of the\r\nConstitution as a compact between States. Those of Massachusetts and\r\nNew Hampshire express the transaction, in my opinion, with sufficient\r\naccuracy. They recognize the Divine goodness \"in affording THE PEOPLE\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES an opportunity of entering into an explicit and\r\nsolemn compact with each other _by assenting to and ratifying a new\r\nConstitution_.\" You will observe, Sir, that it is the PEOPLE, and not\r\nthe States, who have entered into this compact; and it is the PEOPLE of\r\nall the United States. These conventions, by this form of expression,\r\nmeant merely to say, that the people of the United States had, by the\r\nblessing of Providence, enjoyed the opportunity of establishing a new\r\nConstitution, _founded in the consent of the people_. This consent of\r\nthe people has been called, by European writers, the _social compact_;\r\nand, in conformity to this common mode of expression, these conventions\r\nspeak of that assent, on which the new Constitution was to rest, as an\r\nexplicit and solemn compact, not which the States had entered into with\r\neach other, but which the _people_ of the United States had entered\r\ninto.\r\n\r\nFinally, Sir, how can any man get over the words of the Constitution\r\nitself?--\"WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, DO ORDAIN AND ESTABLISH\r\nTHIS CONSTITUTION.\" These words must cease to be a part of the\r\nConstitution, they must be obliterated from the parchment on which they\r\nare written, before any human ingenuity or human argument can remove\r\nthe popular basis on which that Constitution rests, and turn the\r\ninstrument into a mere compact between sovereign States.\r\n\r\nThe second proposition, Sir, which I propose to maintain, is, that no\r\nState authority can dissolve the relations subsisting between the\r\ngovernment of the United States and individuals; that nothing can\r\ndissolve these relations but revolution; and that, therefore, there can\r\nbe no such thing as _secession_ without revolution. All this follows,\r\nas it seems to me, as a just consequence, if it be first proved that\r\nthe Constitution of the United States is a government proper, owing\r\nprotection to individuals, and entitled to their obedience.\r\n\r\nThe people, Sir, in every State, live under two governments. They owe\r\nobedience to both. These governments, though distinct, are not adverse.\r\nEach has its separate sphere, and its peculiar powers and duties. It is\r\nnot a contest between two sovereigns for the same power, like the wars\r\nof the rival houses of England; nor is it a dispute between a\r\ngovernment _de facto_ and a government _de jure_. It is the case of a\r\ndivision of powers between two governments, made by the people, to whom\r\nboth are responsible. Neither can dispense with the duty which\r\nindividuals owe to the other; neither can call itself master of the\r\nother; the people are masters of both. This division of power, it is\r\ntrue, is in a great measure unknown in Europe. It is the peculiar\r\nsystem of America; and, though new and singular, it is not\r\nincomprehensible. The State constitutions are established by the people\r\nof the States. This Constitution is established by the people of all\r\nthe States. How, then, can a State secede? How can a State undo what\r\nthe whole people have done? How can she absolve her citizens from their\r\nobedience to the laws of the United States? How can she annul their\r\nobligations and oaths? How can the members of her legislature renounce\r\ntheir own oaths? Sir, secession, as a revolutionary right, is\r\nintelligible; as a right to be proclaimed in the midst of civil\r\ncommotions, and asserted at the head of armies, I can understand it.\r\nBut as a practical right, existing under the Constitution, and in\r\nconformity with its provisions, it seems to me to be nothing but a\r\nplain absurdity; for it supposes resistance to government, under the\r\nauthority of government itself; it supposes dismemberment, without\r\nviolating the principles of union; it supposes opposition to law,\r\nwithout crime; it supposes the violation of oaths, without\r\nresponsibility; it supposes the total overthrow of government, without\r\nrevolution. The Constitution, Sir, regards itself as perpetual and\r\nimmortal. It seeks to establish a union among the people of the States,\r\nwhich shall last through all time. Or, if the common fate of things\r\nhuman must be expected at some period to happen to it, yet that\r\ncatastrophe is not anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe instrument contains ample provisions for its amendment, at all\r\ntimes; none for its abandonment at any time. It declares that new\r\nStates may come into the Union, but it does not declare that old States\r\nmay go out. The Union is not a temporary partnership of States. It is\r\nthe association of the people, under a constitution of government,\r\nuniting their power, joining together their highest interests,\r\ncementing their present enjoyments, and blending, in one indivisible\r\nmass, all their hopes for the future. Whatsoever is steadfast in just\r\npolitical principles; whatsoever is permanent in the structure of human\r\nsociety; whatsoever there is which can derive an enduring character\r\nfrom being founded on deep-laid principles of constitutional liberty\r\nand on the broad foundations of the public will,--all these unite to\r\nentitle this instrument to be regarded as a permanent constitution of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, Mr. President, I contend that there is a supreme law\r\nof the land, consisting of the Constitution, acts of Congress passed in\r\npursuance of it, and the public treaties. This will not be denied,\r\nbecause such are the very words of the Constitution. But I contend,\r\nfurther, that it rightfully belongs to Congress, and to the courts of\r\nthe United States, to settle the construction of this supreme law, in\r\ndoubtful cases. This is denied; and here arises the great practical\r\nquestion, _Who is to construe finally the Constitution of the United\r\nStates_? We all agree that the Constitution is the supreme law; but who\r\nshall interpret that law? In our system of the division of powers\r\nbetween different governments, controversies will necessarily sometimes\r\narise, respecting the extent of the powers of each. Who shall decide\r\nthese controversies? Does it rest with the general government, in all\r\nor any of its departments, to exercise the office of final interpreter?\r\nOr may each of the States, as well as the general government, claim\r\nthis right of ultimate decision? The practical result of this whole\r\ndebate turns on this point. The gentleman contends that each State may\r\njudge for itself of any alleged violation of the Constitution, and may\r\nfinally decide for itself, and may execute its own decisions by its own\r\npower. All the recent proceedings in South Carolina are founded on this\r\nclaim of right. Her convention has pronounced the revenue laws of the\r\nUnited States unconstitutional; and this decision she does not allow\r\nany authority of the United States to overrule or reverse. Of course\r\nshe rejects the authority of Congress, because the very object of the\r\nordinance is to reverse the decision of Congress; and she rejects, too,\r\nthe authority of the courts of the United States, because she expressly\r\nprohibits all appeal to those courts. It is in order to sustain this\r\nasserted right of being her own judge, that she pronounces the\r\nConstitution of the United States to be but a compact, to which she is\r\na party, and a sovereign party. If this be established, then the\r\ninference is supposed to follow, that, being sovereign, there is no\r\npower to control her decision; and her own judgment on her own compact\r\nis, and must be, conclusive.\r\n\r\nI have already endeavored, Sir, to point out the practical consequences\r\nof this doctrine, and to show how utterly inconsistent it is with all\r\nideas of regular government, and how soon its adoption would involve\r\nthe whole country in revolution and absolute anarchy. I hope it is easy\r\nnow to show, Sir, that a doctrine bringing such consequences with it is\r\nnot well founded; that it has nothing to stand on but theory and\r\nassumption; and that it is refuted by plain and express constitutional\r\nprovisions. I think the government of the United States does possess,\r\nin its appropriate departments, the authority of final decision on\r\nquestions of disputed power. I think it possesses this authority, both\r\nby necessary implication and by express grant.\r\n\r\nIt will not be denied, Sir, that this authority naturally belongs to\r\nall governments. They all exercise it from necessity, and as a\r\nconsequence of the exercise of other powers. The State governments\r\nthemselves possess it, except in that class of questions which may\r\narise between them and the general government, and in regard to which\r\nthey have surrendered it, as well by the nature of the case as by clear\r\nconstitutional provisions. In other and ordinary cases, whether a\r\nparticular law be in conformity to the constitution of the State is a\r\nquestion which the State legislature or the State judiciary must\r\ndetermine. We all know that these questions arise daily in the State\r\ngovernments, and are decided by those governments; and I know no\r\ngovernment which does not exercise a similar power.\r\n\r\nUpon general principles, then, the government of the United States\r\npossesses this authority; and this would hardly be denied were it not\r\nthat there are other governments. But since there are State\r\ngovernments, and since these, like other governments, ordinarily\r\nconstrue their own powers, if the government of the United States\r\nconstrues its own powers also, which construction is to prevail in the\r\ncase of opposite constructions? And again, as in the case now actually\r\nbefore us, the State governments may undertake, not only to construe\r\ntheir own powers, but to decide directly on the extent of the powers of\r\nCongress. Congress has passed a law as being within its just powers;\r\nSouth Carolina denies that this law is within its just powers, and\r\ninsists that she has the right so to decide this point, and that her\r\ndecision is final. How are these questions to be settled?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Sir, even if the Constitution of the United States had\r\nmade no express provision for such cases, it would yet be difficult to\r\nmaintain, that, in a Constitution existing over four-and-twenty States,\r\nwith equal authority over all, one could claim a right of construing it\r\nfor the whole. This would seem a manifest impropriety; indeed, an\r\nabsurdity. If the Constitution is a government existing over all the\r\nStates, though with limited powers, it necessarily follows, that, to\r\nthe extent of those powers, it must be supreme. If it be not superior\r\nto the authority of a particular State, it is not a national\r\ngovernment. But as it is a government, as it has a legislative power of\r\nits own, and a judicial power coextensive with the legislative, the\r\ninference is irresistible that this government, thus created _by_ the\r\nwhole and _for_ the whole, must have an authority superior to that of\r\nthe particular government of any one part. Congress is the legislature\r\nof all the people of the United States; the judiciary of the general\r\ngovernment is the judiciary of all the people of the United States. To\r\nhold, therefore, that this legislature and this judiciary are\r\nsubordinate in authority to the legislature and judiciary of a single\r\nState, is doing violence to all common sense, and overturning all\r\nestablished principles. Congress must judge of the extent of its own\r\npowers so often as it is called on to exercise them, or it cannot act\r\nat all; and it must also act independent of State control, or it cannot\r\nact at all.\r\n\r\nThe right of State interposition strikes at the very foundation of the\r\nlegislative power of Congress. It possesses no effective legislative\r\npower, if such right of State interposition exists; because it can pass\r\nno law not subject to abrogation. It cannot make laws for the Union, if\r\nany part of the Union may pronounce its enactments void and of no\r\neffect. Its forms of legislation would be an idle ceremony, if, after\r\nall, any one of four-and-twenty States might bid defiance to its\r\nauthority. Without express provision in the Constitution, therefore,\r\nSir, this whole question is necessarily decided by those provisions\r\nwhich create a legislative power and a judicial power. If these exist\r\nin a government intended for the whole, the inevitable consequence is,\r\nthat the laws of this legislative power and the decisions of this\r\njudicial power must be binding on and over the whole. No man can form\r\nthe conception of a government existing over four-and-twenty States,\r\nwith a regular legislative and judicial power, and of the existence at\r\nthe same time of an authority, residing elsewhere, to resist, at\r\npleasure or discretion, the enactments and the decisions of such a\r\ngovernment. I maintain, therefore, Sir, that, from the nature of the\r\ncase, and as an inference wholly unavoidable, the acts of Congress and\r\nthe decisions of the national courts must be of higher authority than\r\nState laws and State decisions. If this be not so, there is, there can\r\nbe, no general government.\r\n\r\nBut, Mr. President, the Constitution has not left this cardinal point\r\nwithout full and explicit provisions. First, as to the authority of\r\nCongress. Having enumerated the specific powers conferred on Congress,\r\nthe Constitution adds, as a distinct and substantive clause, the\r\nfollowing, viz.: \"To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper\r\nfor carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers\r\nvested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or\r\nin any department or officer thereof.\" If this means anything, it means\r\nthat Congress may judge of the true extent and just interpretation of\r\nthe specific powers granted to it, and may judge also of what is\r\nnecessary and proper for executing those powers. If Congress is to\r\njudge of what is necessary for the execution of its powers, it must, of\r\nnecessity, judge of the extent and interpretation of those powers.\r\n\r\nAnd in regard, Sir, to the judiciary, the Constitution is still more\r\nexpress and emphatic. It declares that the judicial power shall extend\r\nto all _cases_ in law or equity arising under the Constitution, laws of\r\nthe United States, and treaties; that there shall be _one_ Supreme\r\nCourt, and that this Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction of\r\nall these cases, subject to such exceptions as Congress may make. It is\r\nimpossible to escape from the generality of these words. If a case\r\narises under the Constitution, that is, if a case arises depending on\r\nthe construction of the Constitution, the judicial power of the United\r\nStates extends to it. It reaches _the case, the question_; it attaches\r\nthe power of the national judicature to the _case_ itself, in whatever\r\ncourt it may arise or exist; and in this _case_ the Supreme Court has\r\nappellate jurisdiction over all courts whatever. No language could\r\nprovide with more effect and precision than is here done, for\r\nsubjecting constitutional questions to the ultimate decision of the\r\nSupreme Court. And, Sir, this is exactly what the Convention found it\r\nnecessary to provide for, and intended to provide for. It is, too,\r\nexactly what the people were universally told was done when they\r\nadopted the Constitution. One of the first resolutions adopted by the\r\nConvention was in these words, viz.: \"That the jurisdiction of the\r\nnational judiciary shall extend to cases which respect _the collection\r\nof the national revenue_, and questions which involve the national\r\npeace and harmony.\" Now, Sir, this either had no sensible meaning at\r\nall, or else it meant that the jurisdiction of the national judiciary\r\nshould extend to these questions, _with a paramount authority_. It is\r\nnot to be supposed that the Convention intended that the power of the\r\nnational judiciary should extend to these questions, and that the power\r\nof the judicatures of the States should also extend to them, _with\r\nequal power of final decision_. This would be to defeat the whole\r\nobject of the provision. There were thirteen judicatures already in\r\nexistence. The evil complained of, or the danger to be guarded against,\r\nwas contradiction and repugnance in the decisions of these judicatures.\r\nIf the framers of the Constitution meant to create a fourteenth, and\r\nyet not to give it power to revise and control the decisions of the\r\nexisting thirteen, then they only intended to augment the existing evil\r\nand the apprehended danger by increasing still further the chances of\r\ndiscordant judgments. Why, Sir, has it become a settled axiom in\r\npolitics that every government must have a judicial power coextensive\r\nwith its legislative power? Certainly, there is only this reason,\r\nnamely, that the laws may receive a uniform interpretation and a\r\nuniform execution. This object cannot be otherwise attained. A statute\r\nis what it is judicially interpreted to be; and if it be construed one\r\nway in New Hampshire, and another way in Georgia, there is no uniform\r\nlaw. One supreme court, with appellate and final jurisdiction, is the\r\nnatural and only adequate means, in any government, to secure this\r\nuniformity. The Convention saw all this clearly; and the resolution\r\nwhich I have quoted, never afterwards rescinded, passed through various\r\nmodifications, till it finally received the form which the article now\r\nbears in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniably true, then, that the framers of the Constitution\r\nintended to create a national judicial power, which should be paramount\r\non national subjects. And after the Constitution was framed, and while\r\nthe whole country was engaged in discussing its merits, one of its most\r\ndistinguished advocates, Mr. Madison, told the people that it _was\r\ntrue, that, in controversies relating to the boundary between the two\r\njurisdictions, the tribunal which is ultimately to decide is to be\r\nestablished under the general government_. Mr. Martin, who had been a\r\nmember of the Convention, asserted the same thing to be the legislature\r\nof Maryland, and urged it as a reason for rejecting the Constitution.\r\nMr. Pinckney, himself also a leading member of the Convention, declared\r\nit to the people of South Carolina. Everywhere it was admitted, by\r\nfriends and foes, that this power was in the Constitution. By some it\r\nwas thought dangerous, by most it was thought necessary; but by all it\r\nwas agreed to be a power actually contained in the instrument. The\r\nConvention saw the absolute necessity of some control in the national\r\ngovernment over State laws. Different modes of establishing this\r\ncontrol were suggested and considered. At one time, it was proposed\r\nthat the laws of the States should, from time to time, be laid before\r\nCongress, and that Congress should possess a negative over them. But\r\nthis was thought inexpedient and inadmissible; and in its place, and\r\nexpressly as a substitute for it, the existing provision was\r\nintroduced; that is to say, a provision by which the federal courts\r\nshould have authority to overrule such State laws as might be in\r\nmanifest contravention of the Constitution. The writers of the\r\nFederalist, in explaining the Constitution, while it was yet pending\r\nbefore the people, and still unadopted, give this account of the matter\r\nin terms, and assign this reason for the article as it now stands. By\r\nthis provision Congress escaped the necessity of any revision of State\r\nlaws, left the whole sphere of State legislation quite untouched, and\r\nyet obtained a security against any infringement of the constitutional\r\npower of the general government. Indeed, Sir, allow me to ask again, if\r\nthe national judiciary was not to exercise a power of revision on\r\nconstitutional questions over the judicatures of the States, why was\r\nany national judicature erected at all? Can any man give a sensible\r\nreason for having a judicial power in this government, unless it be for\r\nthe sake of maintaining a uniformity of decision on questions arising\r\nunder the Constitution and laws of Congress, and insuring its\r\nexecution? And does not this very idea of uniformity necessarily imply\r\nthat the construction given by the national courts is to be the\r\nprevailing construction? How else, Sir, is it possible that uniformity\r\ncan be preserved?\r\n\r\nGentlemen appear to me, Sir, to look at but one side of the question.\r\nThey regard only the supposed danger of trusting a government with the\r\ninterpretation of its own powers. But will they view the question in\r\nits other aspect? Will they show us how it is possible for a government\r\nto get along with four-and-twenty interpreters of its laws and powers?\r\nGentlemen argue, too, as if, in these cases, the State would be always\r\nright, and the general government always wrong. But suppose the\r\nreverse,--suppose the State wrong (and, since they differ, some of them\r\nmust be wrong),--are the most important and essential operations of the\r\ngovernment to be embarrassed and arrested, because one State holds the\r\ncontrary opinion? Mr. President, every argument which refers the\r\nconstitutionality of acts of Congress to State decision appeals from\r\nthe majority to the minority; it appeals from the common interest to a\r\nparticular interest; from the counsels of all to the counsel of one;\r\nand endeavors to supersede the judgment of the whole by the judgment of\r\na part.\r\n\r\nI think it is clear, Sir, that the Constitution, by express provision,\r\nby definite and unequivocal words, as well as by necessary implication,\r\nhas constituted the Supreme Court of the United States the appellate\r\ntribunal in all cases of a constitutional nature which assume the shape\r\nof a suit, in law or equity. And I think I cannot do better than to\r\nleave this part of the subject by reading the remarks made upon it in\r\nthe convention of Connecticut, by Mr. Ellsworth; a gentleman, Sir, who\r\nhas left behind him, on the records of the government of his country,\r\nproofs of the clearest intelligence and the deepest sagacity, as well\r\nas of the utmost purity and integrity of character. \"This\r\nConstitution,\" says he, \"defines the extent of the powers of the\r\ngeneral government. If the general legislature should, at any time,\r\noverleap their limits, the judicial department is a constitutional\r\ncheck. If the United States go beyond their powers, if they make a law\r\nwhich the Constitution does not authorize, it is void; and the\r\njudiciary power, the national judges, who, to secure their\r\nimpartiality, are to be made independent, will declare it to be void.\r\nOn the other hand, if the States go beyond their limits, if they make a\r\nlaw which is a usurpation upon the general government, the law is void;\r\nand upright, independent judges will declare it to be so.\" Nor did this\r\nremain merely matter of private opinion. In the very first session of\r\nthe first Congress, with all these well-known objects, both of the\r\nConvention and the people, full and fresh in his mind, Mr. Ellsworth,\r\nas is generally understood, reported the bill for the organization of\r\nthe judicial department, and in that bill made provision for the\r\nexercise of this appellate power of the Supreme Court, in all the\r\nproper cases, in whatsoever court arising; and this appellate power has\r\nnow been exercised for more than forty years, without interruption, and\r\nwithout doubt.\r\n\r\nAs to the cases, Sir, which do not come before the courts, those\r\npolitical questions which terminate with the enactments of Congress, it\r\nis of necessity that these should be ultimately decided by Congress\r\nitself. Like other legislatures, it must be trusted with this power.\r\nThe members of Congress are chosen by the people, and they are\r\nanswerable to the people; like other public agents, they are bound by\r\noath to support the Constitution. These are the securities that they\r\nwill not violate their duty, nor transcend their powers. They are the\r\nsame securities that prevail in other popular governments; nor is it\r\neasy to see how grants of power can be more safely guarded, without\r\nrendering them nugatory. If the case cannot come before the courts, and\r\nif Congress be not trusted with its decision, who shall decide it? The\r\ngentleman says, each State is to decide it for herself. If so, then, as\r\nI have already urged, what is law in one State is not law in another.\r\nOr, if the resistance of one State compels an entire repeal of the law,\r\nthen a minority, and that a small one, governs the whole country.\r\n\r\nSir, those who espouse the doctrines of nullification reject, as it\r\nseems to me, the first great principle of all republican liberty; that\r\nis, that the majority _must_ govern. In matters of common concern, the\r\njudgment of a majority _must_ stand as the judgment of the whole. This\r\nis a law imposed on us by the absolute necessity of the case; and if we\r\ndo not act upon it, there is no possibility of maintaining any\r\ngovernment but despotism. We hear loud and repeated denunciations\r\nagainst what is called _majority government_. It is declared, with much\r\nwarmth, that a majority government cannot be maintained in the United\r\nStates. What, then, do gentlemen wish? Do they wish to establish a\r\n_minority_ government? Do they wish to subject the will of the many to\r\nthe will of the few? The honorable gentleman from South Carolina has\r\nspoken of absolute majorities and majorities concurrent; language\r\nwholly unknown to our Constitution, and to which it is not easy to\r\naffix definite ideas. As far as I understand it, it would teach us that\r\nthe absolute majority may be found in Congress, but the majority\r\nconcurrent must be looked for in the States; that is to say, Sir,\r\nstripping the matter of this novelty of phrase, that the dissent of one\r\nor more States, as States, renders void the decision of a majority of\r\nCongress, so far as that State is concerned. And so this doctrine,\r\nrunning but a short career, like other dogmas of the day, terminates in\r\nnullification.\r\n\r\nIf this vehement invective against _majorities_ meant no more than\r\nthat, in the construction of government, it is wise to provide checks\r\nand balances, so that there should be various limitations on the power\r\nof the mere majority, it would only mean what the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States has already abundantly provided. It is full of such\r\nchecks and balances. In its very organization, it adopts a broad and\r\nmost effective principle in restraint of the power of mere majorities.\r\nA majority of the people elects the House of Representatives, but it\r\ndoes not elect the Senate. The Senate is elected by the States, each\r\nState having, in this respect, an equal power. No law, therefore, can\r\npass, without the assent of the representatives of the people, and a\r\nmajority of the representatives of the States also. A majority of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people must concur, and a majority of the States\r\nmust concur, in every act of Congress; and the President is elected on\r\na plan compounded of both these principles. But having composed one\r\nhouse of representatives chosen by the people in each State, according\r\nto their numbers, and the other of an equal number of members from\r\nevery State, whether larger or smaller, the Constitution gives to\r\nmajorities in these houses thus constituted the full and entire power\r\nof passing laws, subject always to the constitutional restrictions and\r\nto the approval of the President. To subject them to any other power is\r\nclear usurpation. The majority of one house may be controlled by the\r\nmajority of the other; and both may be restrained by the President's\r\nnegative. These are checks and balances provided by the Constitution,\r\nexisting in the government itself, and wisely intended to secure\r\ndeliberation and caution in legislative proceedings. But to resist the\r\nwill of the majority in both houses, thus constitutionally exercised;\r\nto insist on the lawfulness of interposition by an extraneous power; to\r\nclaim the right of defeating the will of Congress, by setting up\r\nagainst it the will of a single State,--is neither more nor less, as it\r\nstrikes me, than a plain attempt to overthrow the government. The\r\nconstituted authorities of the United States are no longer a\r\ngovernment, if they be not masters of their own will; they are no\r\nlonger a government, if an external power may arrest their proceedings;\r\nthey are no longer a government, if acts passed by both houses, and\r\napproved by the President, may be nullified by State vetoes or State\r\nordinances. Does any one suppose it could make any difference, as to\r\nthe binding authority of an act of Congress, and of the duty of a State\r\nto respect it, whether it passed by a mere majority of both houses, or\r\nby three fourths of each, or the unanimous vote of each? Within the\r\nlimits and restrictions of the Constitution, the government of the\r\nUnited States, like all other popular governments, acts by majorities.\r\nIt can act no otherwise. Whoever, therefore, denounces the government\r\nof majorities, denounces the government of his own country, and\r\ndenounces all free governments. And whoever would restrain these\r\nmajorities, while acting within their constitutional limits, by an\r\nexternal power, whatever he may intend, asserts principles which, if\r\nadopted, can lead to nothing else than the destruction of the\r\ngovernment itself.\r\n\r\nDoes not the gentleman perceive, Sir, how his argument against\r\nmajorities might here be retorted upon him? Does he not see how\r\ncogently he might be asked, whether it be the character of\r\nnullification to practise what it preaches? Look to South Carolina, at\r\nthe present moment. How far are the rights of minorities there\r\nrespected? I confess, sir, I have not known, in peaceable times, the\r\npower of the majority carried with a higher hand, or upheld with more\r\nrelentless disregard of the rights, feelings, and principles of the\r\nminority;--a minority embracing, as the gentleman himself will admit, a\r\nlarge portion of the worth and respectability of the state;--a minority\r\ncomprehending in its numbers men who have been associated with him, and\r\nwith us, in these halls of legislation; men who have served their\r\ncountry at home and honored it abroad; men who would cheerfully lay\r\ndown their lives for their native state, in any cause which they could\r\nregard as the cause of honor and duty; men above fear, and above\r\nreproach, whose deepest grief and distress spring from the conviction,\r\nthat the present proceedings of the state must ultimately reflect\r\ndiscredit upon her. How is this minority, how are these men, regarded?\r\nThey are enthralled and disfranchised by ordinances and acts of\r\nlegislation; subjected to tests and oaths incompatible, as they\r\nconscientiously think, with oaths already taken, and obligations\r\nalready assumed; they are proscribed and denounced as recreants to duty\r\nand patriotism, and slaves to a foreign power. Both the spirit which\r\npursues them, and the positive measures which emanate from that spirit,\r\nare harsh and proscriptive beyond all precedent within my knowledge,\r\nexcept in periods of professed revolution.\r\n\r\nIt is not, sir, one would think, for those who approve these\r\nproceedings to complain of the power of majorities.\r\n\r\nMr. President, all popular governments rest on two principles, or two\r\nassumptions:--\r\n\r\nFirst, That there is so far a common interest among those over whom the\r\ngovernment extends, as that it may provide for the defence, protection,\r\nand good government of the whole, without injustice or oppression to\r\nparts; and\r\n\r\nSecondly, That the representatives of the people, and especially the\r\npeople themselves, are secure against general corruption, and may be\r\ntrusted, therefore, with the exercise of power.\r\n\r\nWhoever argues against these principles argues against the\r\npracticability of all free governments. And whoever admits these, must\r\nadmit, or cannot deny, that power is as safe in the hands of Congress\r\nas in those of other representative bodies. Congress is not\r\nirresponsible. Its members are agents of the people, elected by them,\r\nanswerable to them, and liable to be displaced or superseded, at their\r\npleasure; and they possess as fair a claim to the confidence of the\r\npeople, while they continue to deserve it, as any other public\r\npolitical agents.\r\n\r\nIf, then, Sir, the manifest intention of the Convention, and the\r\ncontemporary admission of both friends and foes, prove anything; if the\r\nplain text of the instrument itself, as well as the necessary\r\nimplication from other provisions, prove anything; if the early\r\nlegislation of Congress, the course of judicial decisions, acquiesced\r\nin by all the States for forty years, prove any thing,--then it is\r\nproved that there is a supreme law, and a final interpreter.\r\n\r\nMy fourth and last proposition, Mr. President, was, that any attempt by\r\na State to abrogate or nullify acts of Congress is a usurpation on the\r\npowers of the general government and on the equal rights of other\r\nStates, a violation of the Constitution, and a proceeding essentially\r\nrevolutionary. This is undoubtedly true, if the preceding propositions\r\nbe regarded as proved. If the government of the United States be\r\ntrusted with the duty, in any department, of declaring the extent of\r\nits own powers, then a State ordinance, or act of legislation,\r\nauthorizing resistance to an act of Congress, on the alleged ground of\r\nits unconstitutionality, is manifestly a usurpation upon its powers. If\r\nthe States have equal rights in matters concerning the whole, then for\r\none State to set up her judgment against the judgment of the rest, and\r\nto insist on executing that judgment by force, is also a manifest\r\nusurpation on the rights of other States. If the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States be a government proper, with authority to pass laws, and\r\nto give them a uniform interpretation and execution, then the\r\ninterposition of a State, to enforce her own construction, and to\r\nresist, as to herself, that law which binds the other States, is a\r\nviolation of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIf that be revolutionary which arrests the legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial power of government, dispenses with existing oaths and\r\nobligations of obedience, and elevates another power to supreme\r\ndominion, then nullification is revolutionary. Or if that be\r\nrevolutionary the natural tendency and practical effect of which are to\r\nbreak the Union into fragments, to sever all connection among the\r\npeople of the respective States, and to prostrate this general\r\ngovernment in the dust, then nullification is revolutionary.\r\n\r\nNullification, Sir, is as distinctly revolutionary as secession; but I\r\ncannot say that the revolution which it seeks is one of so respectable\r\na character. Secession would, it is true, abandon the Constitution\r\naltogether; but then it would profess to abandon it. Whatever other\r\ninconsistencies it might run into, one, at least, it would avoid. It\r\nwould not belong to a government, while it rejected its authority. It\r\nwould not repel the burden, and continue to enjoy the benefits. It\r\nwould not aid in passing laws which others are to obey, and yet reject\r\ntheir authority as to itself. It would not undertake to reconcile\r\nobedience to public authority with an asserted right of command over\r\nthat same authority. It would not be in the government, and above the\r\ngovernment, at the same time. But though secession may be a more\r\nrespectable mode of attaining the object than nullification, it is not\r\nmore truly revolutionary. Each, and both, resist the constitutional\r\nauthorities; each, and both, would sever the Union and subvert the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMr. President, having detained the Senate so long already, I will not\r\nnow examine at length the ordinance and laws of South Carolina. These\r\npapers are well drawn for their purpose. Their authors understood their\r\nown objects. They are called a peaceable remedy, and we have been told\r\nthat South Carolina, after all, intends nothing but a lawsuit. A very\r\nfew words, Sir, will show the nature of this peaceable remedy, and of\r\nthe lawsuit which South Carolina contemplates.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the ordinance declares the law of last July, and\r\nall other laws of the United States laying duties, to be absolutely\r\nnull and void, and makes it unlawful for the constituted authorities of\r\nthe United States to enforce the payment of such duties. It is\r\ntherefore, Sir, an indictable offence, at this moment, in South\r\nCarolina, for any person to be concerned in collecting revenue under\r\nthe laws of the United States. It being declared, by what is considered\r\na fundamental law of the State, unlawful to collect these duties, an\r\nindictment lies, of course, against any one concerned in such\r\ncollection; and he is, on general principles, liable to be punished by\r\nfine and imprisonment. The terms, it is true, are, that it is unlawful\r\n\"to enforce the payment of duties\"; but every custom-house officer\r\nenforces payment while he detains the goods in order to obtain such\r\npayment. The ordinance, therefore, reaches everybody concerned in the\r\ncollection of the duties.\r\n\r\nThis is the first step in the prosecution of the peaceable remedy. The\r\nsecond is more decisive. By the act commonly called _replevin_ law, any\r\nperson whose goods are seized or detained by the collector for the\r\npayment of duties may sue out a writ of replevin, and, by virtue of\r\nthat writ, the goods are to be restored to him. A writ of replevin is a\r\nwrit which the sheriff is bound to execute, and for the execution of\r\nwhich he is bound to employ force, if necessary. He may call out the\r\n_posse_, and must do so, if resistance be made. This _posse_ may be\r\narmed or unarmed. It may come forth with military array, and under the\r\nlead of military men. Whatever number of troops may be assembled in\r\nCharleston, they may be summoned, with the governor, or\r\ncommander-in-chief, at their head, to come in aid of the sheriff. It is\r\nevident, then, Sir, that the whole military power of the State is to be\r\nemployed, if necessary, in dispossessing the custom-house officers, and\r\nin seizing and holding the goods, without paying the duties. This is\r\nthe second step in the peaceable remedy.\r\n\r\nSir, whatever pretences may be set up to the contrary, this is the\r\ndirect application of force, and of military force. It is unlawful, in\r\nitself, to replevy goods in the custody of the collectors. But this\r\nunlawful act is to be done, and it is to be done by force. Here is a\r\nplain interposition, by physical force, to resist the laws of the\r\nUnion. The legal mode of collecting duties is to detain the goods till\r\nsuch duties are paid or secured. But force comes, and overpowers the\r\ncollector and his assistants, and takes away the goods, leaving the\r\nduties unpaid. There cannot be a clearer case of forcible resistance to\r\nlaw. And it is provided that the goods thus seized shall be held\r\nagainst any attempt to retake them, by the same force which seized them.\r\n\r\nHaving thus dispossessed the officers of the government of the goods,\r\nwithout payment of duties, and seized and secured them by the strong\r\narm of the State, only one thing more remains to be done, and that is,\r\nto cut off all possibility of legal redress; and that, too, is\r\naccomplished, or thought to be accomplished. The ordinance declares,\r\n_that all judicial proceedings founded on the revenue laws_ (including,\r\nof course, proceedings in the courts of the United States), _shall be\r\nnull and void_. This nullifies the judicial power of the United States.\r\nThen comes the test-oath act. This requires all State judges and jurors\r\nin the State courts to swear that they will execute the ordinance, and\r\nall acts of the legislature passed in pursuance thereof. The ordinance\r\ndeclares, that no appeal shall be allowed from the decision of the\r\nState courts to the Supreme Court of the United States; and the\r\nreplevin act makes it an indictable offence for any clerk to furnish a\r\ncopy of the record, for the purpose of such appeal.\r\n\r\nThe two principal provisions on which South Carolina relies, to resist\r\nthe laws of the United States, and nullify the authority of this\r\ngovernment, are, therefore, these:--\r\n\r\n1. A forcible seizure of goods, before duties are paid or secured, by\r\nthe power of the State, civil and military.\r\n\r\n2. The taking away, by the most effectual means in her power, of all\r\nlegal redress in the courts of the United States; the confining of\r\njudicial proceedings to her own State tribunals; and the compelling of\r\nher judges and jurors of these her own courts to take an oath,\r\nbeforehand, that they will decide all cases according to the ordinance,\r\nand the acts passed under it; that is, that they will decide the cause\r\none way. They do not swear to _try_ it, on its own merits; they only\r\nswear to _decide_ it as nullification requires.\r\n\r\nThe character, Sir, of these provisions defies comment. Their object is\r\nas plain as their means are extraordinary. They propose direct\r\nresistance, by the whole power of the State, to laws of Congress, and\r\ncut off, by methods deemed adequate, any redress by legal and judicial\r\nauthority. They arrest legislation, defy the executive, and banish the\r\njudicial power of this government. They authorize and command acts to\r\nbe done, and done by force, both of numbers and of arms, which, if\r\ndone, and done by force, are clearly acts of rebellion and treason.\r\n\r\nSuch, Sir, are the laws of South Carolina; such, Sir, is the peaceable\r\nremedy of nullification. Has not nullification reached, Sir, even thus\r\nearly, that point of direct and forcible resistance to law to which I\r\nintimated, three years ago, it plainly tended?\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. President, what is the reason for passing laws like these?\r\nWhat are the oppressions experienced under the Union, calling for\r\nmeasures which thus threaten to sever and destroy it? What invasions of\r\npublic liberty, what ruin to private happiness, what long list of\r\nrights violated, or wrongs unredressed, is to justify to the country,\r\nto posterity, and to the world, this assault upon the free Constitution\r\nof the United States, this great and glorious work of our fathers? At\r\nthis very moment, Sir, the whole land smiles in peace, and rejoices in\r\nplenty. A general and a high prosperity pervades the country; and,\r\njudging by the common standard, by increase of population and wealth,\r\nor judging by the opinions of that portion of her people not embarked\r\nin these dangerous and desperate measures, this prosperity overspreads\r\nSouth Carolina herself.\r\n\r\nThus happy at home, our country, at the same time, holds high the\r\ncharacter of her institutions, her power, her rapid growth, and her\r\nfuture destiny, in the eyes of all foreign states. One danger only\r\ncreates hesitation; one doubt only exists, to darken the otherwise\r\nunclouded brightness of that aspect which she exhibits to the view and\r\nto the admiration of the world. Need I say, that that doubt respects\r\nthe permanency of our Union? and need I say, that that doubt is now\r\ncaused, more than any thing else, by these very proceedings of South\r\nCarolina? Sir, all Europe is, at this moment, beholding us, and looking\r\nfor the issue of this controversy; those who hate free institutions,\r\nwith malignant hope; those who love them, with deep anxiety and\r\nshivering fear.\r\n\r\nThe cause, then, Sir, the cause! Let the world know the cause which has\r\nthus induced one State of the Union to bid defiance to the power of the\r\nwhole, and openly to talk secession. Sir, the world will scarcely\r\nbelieve that this whole controversy, and all the desperate measures\r\nwhich its support requires, have no other foundation than a difference\r\nof opinion upon a provision of the Constitution, between a majority of\r\nthe people of South Carolina, on one side, and a vast majority of the\r\nwhole people of the United States, on the other. It will not credit the\r\nfact, it will not admit the possibility, that, in an enlightened age,\r\nin a free, popular republic, under a constitution where the people\r\ngovern, as they must always govern under such systems, by majorities,\r\nat a time of unprecedented prosperity, without practical oppression,\r\nwithout evils such as may not only be pretended, but felt and\r\nexperienced,--evils not slight or temporary, but deep, permanent, and\r\nintolerable,--a single State should rush into conflict with all the\r\nrest, attempt to put down the power of the Union by her own laws, and\r\nto support those laws by her military power, and thus break up and\r\ndestroy the world's last hope. And well the world may be incredulous.\r\nWe, who see and hear it, can ourselves hardly yet believe it. Even\r\nafter all that had preceded it this ordinance struck the country with\r\namazement. It was incredible and inconceivable that South Carolina\r\nshould plunge headlong into resistance to the laws on a matter of\r\nopinion and on a question in which the preponderance of opinion, both\r\nof the present day and of all past time, was so overwhelmingly against\r\nher. The ordinance declares that Congress has exceeded its just power\r\nby laying duties on imports, intended for the protection of\r\nmanufactures. This is the opinion of South Carolina; and on the\r\nstrength of that opinion she nullifies the laws. Yet has the rest of\r\nthe country no right to its opinion also? Is one State to sit sole\r\narbitress? She maintains that those laws are plain, deliberate, and\r\npalpable violations of the Constitution; that she has a sovereign right\r\nto decide this matter; and that, having so decided, she is authorized\r\nto resist their execution by her own sovereign power; and she declares\r\nthat she will resist it, though such resistance should shatter the\r\nUnion into atoms.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I do not intend to discuss the propriety of these laws\r\nat large; but I will ask, How are they shown to be thus plainly and\r\npalpably unconstitutional? Have they no countenance at all in the\r\nConstitution itself? Are they quite new in the history of the\r\ngovernment? Are they a sudden and violent usurpation on the rights of\r\nthe States? Sir, what will the civilized world say, what will posterity\r\nsay, when they learn that similar laws have existed from the very\r\nfoundation of the government, that for thirty years the power was never\r\nquestioned, and that no State in the Union has more freely and\r\nunequivocally admitted it than South Carolina herself?\r\n\r\nTo lay and collect duties and imposts is an _express power_ granted by\r\nthe Constitution to Congress. It is, also, an _exclusive power_; for\r\nthe Constitution as expressly prohibits all the States from exercising\r\nit themselves. This express and exclusive power is unlimited in the\r\nterms of the grant, but is attended with two specific restrictions:\r\nfirst, that all duties and imposts shall be equal in all the States;\r\nsecond, that no duties shall be laid on exports. The power, then, being\r\ngranted, and being attended with these two restrictions, and no more,\r\nwho is to impose a third restriction on the general words of the grant?\r\nIf the power to lay duties, as known among all other nations, and as\r\nknown in all our history, and as it was perfectly understood when the\r\nConstitution was adopted, includes a right of discriminating while\r\nexercising the power, and of laying some duties heavier and some\r\nlighter, for the sake of encouraging our own domestic products, what\r\nauthority is there for giving to the words used in the Constitution a\r\nnew, narrow, and unusual meaning? All the limitations which the\r\nConstitution intended, it has expressed; and what it has left\r\nunrestricted is as much a part of its will as the restraints which it\r\nhas imposed.\r\n\r\nBut these laws, it is said, are unconstitutional on account of the\r\n_motive_. How, Sir, can a law be examined on any such ground? How is\r\nthe motive to be ascertained? One house, or one member, may have one\r\nmotive; the other house, or another member, another. One motive may\r\noperate to-day, and another to-morrow. Upon any such mode of reasoning\r\nas this, one law might be unconstitutional now, and another law, in\r\nexactly the same words, perfectly constitutional next year. Besides,\r\narticles may not only be taxed for the purpose of protecting home\r\nproducts, but other articles may be left free, for the same purpose and\r\nwith the same motive. A law, therefore, would become unconstitutional\r\nfrom what it omitted, as well as from what it contained. Mr. President,\r\nit is a settled principle, acknowledged in all legislative halls,\r\nrecognized before all tribunals, sanctioned by the general sense and\r\nunderstanding of mankind, that there can be no inquiry into the motives\r\nof those who pass laws, for the purpose of determining on their\r\nvalidity. If the law be within the fair meaning of the words in the\r\ngrant of the power, its authority must be admitted until it is\r\nrepealed. This rule, everywhere acknowledged, everywhere admitted, is\r\nso universal and so completely without exception, that even an\r\nallegation of fraud, in the majority of a legislature, is not allowed\r\nas a ground to set aside a law.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, is it true that the motive for these laws is such as is\r\nstated? I think not. The great object of all these laws is,\r\nunquestionably, revenue. If there were no occasion for revenue, the\r\nlaws would not have been passed; and it is notorious that almost the\r\nentire revenue of the country is derived from them. And as yet we have\r\ncollected none too much revenue. The treasury has not been more reduced\r\nfor many years than it is at the present moment. All that South\r\nCarolina can say is, that, in passing the laws which she now undertakes\r\nto nullify, _particular imparted articles were taxed, from a regard to\r\nthe protection of certain articles of domestic manufacture, higher than\r\nthey would have been had no such regard been entertained_. And she\r\ninsists, that, according to the Constitution, no such discrimination\r\ncan be allowed; that duties should be laid for revenue, and revenue\r\nonly; and that it is unlawful to have reference, in any case, to\r\nprotection. In other words, she denies the power of DISCRIMINATION. She\r\ndoes not, and cannot, complain of excessive taxation; on the contrary,\r\nshe professes to be willing to pay any amount for revenue, merely as\r\nrevenue; and up to the present moment there is no surplus of revenue.\r\nHer grievance, then, that plain and palpable violation of the\r\nConstitution which she insists has taken place, is simply the exercise\r\nof the power of DISCRIMINATION. Now, Sir, is the exercise of this power\r\nof discrimination plainly and palpably unconstitutional?\r\n\r\nI have already said, the power to lay duties is given by the\r\nConstitution in broad and general terms. There is also conferred on\r\nCongress the whole power of regulating commerce, in another distinct\r\nprovision. Is it clear and palpable, Sir, can any man say it is a case\r\nbeyond doubt, that, under these two powers, Congress may not justly\r\n_discriminate_, in laying duties, _for the purpose of countervailing\r\nthe policy of foreign nations, or of favoring our own home\r\nproductions?_ Sir, what ought to conclude this question for ever, as it\r\nwould seem to me, is, that the regulation of commerce and the\r\nimposition of duties are, in all commercial nations, powers avowedly\r\nand constantly exercised for this very end. That undeniable truth ought\r\nto settle the question; because the Constitution ought to be\r\nconsidered, when it uses well-known language, as using it in its\r\nwell-known sense. But it is equally undeniable, that it has been, from\r\nthe very first, fully believed that this power of discrimination was\r\nconferred on Congress; and the Constitution was itself recommended,\r\nurged upon the people, and enthusiastically insisted on in some of the\r\nStates, for that very reason. Not that, at that time, the country was\r\nextensively engaged in manufactures, especially of the kinds now\r\nexisting. But the trades and crafts of the seaport towns, the business\r\nof the artisans and manual laborers,--those employments, the work in\r\nwhich supplies so great a portion of the daily wants of all\r\nclasses,--all these looked to the new Constitution as a source of\r\nrelief from the severe distress which followed the war. It would, Sir,\r\nbe unpardonable, at so late an hour, to go into details on this point;\r\nbut the truth is as I have stated. The papers of the day, the\r\nresolutions of public meetings, the debates in the conventions, all\r\nthat we open our eyes upon in the history of the times, prove it.\r\n\r\nSir, the honorable gentleman from South Carolina has referred to two\r\nincidents connected with the proceedings of the Convention at\r\nPhiladelphia, which he thinks are evidence to show that the power of\r\nprotecting manufactures by laying duties, and by commercial\r\nregulations, was not intended to be given to Congress. The first is, as\r\nhe says, that a power to protect manufactures was expressly proposed,\r\nbut not granted. I think, Sir, the gentleman is quite mistaken in\r\nrelation to this part of the proceedings of the Convention. The whole\r\nhistory of the occurrence to which he alludes is simply this. Towards\r\nthe conclusion of the Convention, after the provisions of the\r\nConstitution had been mainly agreed upon, after the power to lay duties\r\nand the power to regulate commerce had both been granted, a long list\r\nof propositions was made and referred to the committee, containing\r\nvarious miscellaneous powers, some or all of which it was thought might\r\nbe properly vested in Congress. Among these was a power to establish a\r\nuniversity; to grant charters of incorporation; to regulate\r\nstage-coaches on the post-roads; and also the power to which the\r\ngentleman refers, and which is expressed in these words: \"To establish\r\npublic institutions, rewards, and immunities, for the promotion of\r\nagriculture, commerce, trades, and manufactures.\" The committee made no\r\nreport on this or various other propositions in the same list. But the\r\nonly inference from this omission is, that neither the committee nor\r\nthe Convention thought it proper to authorize Congress \"to establish\r\npublic institutions, rewards, and immunities,\" for the promotion of\r\nmanufactures, and other interests. The Convention supposed it had done\r\nenough,--at any rate, it had done all it intended,--when it had given\r\nto Congress, in general terms, the power to lay imposts and the power\r\nto regulate trade. It is not to be argued, from its omission to give\r\nmore, that it meant to take back what it had already given. It had\r\ngiven the impost power; it had given the regulation of trade; and it\r\ndid not deem it necessary to give the further and distinct power of\r\nestablishing public institutions.\r\n\r\nThe other fact, Sir, on which the gentleman relies, is the declaration\r\nof Mr. Martin to the legislature of Maryland. The gentleman supposes\r\nMr. Martin to have urged against the Constitution, that it did not\r\ncontain the power of protection. But if the gentleman will look again\r\nat what Mr. Martin said, he will find, I think, that what Mr. Martin\r\ncomplained of was, that the Constitution, by its prohibitions on the\r\nStates, had taken away from the States themselves the power of\r\nprotecting their own manufactures by duties on imports. This is\r\nundoubtedly true; but I find no expression of Mr. Martin intimating\r\nthat the Constitution had not conferred on Congress the same power\r\nwhich it had thus taken from the States.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, let us go to the first Congress; let us look in upon this and\r\nthe other house, at the first session of their organization.\r\n\r\nWe see, in both houses, men distinguished among the framers, friends,\r\nand advocates of the Constitution. We see in both, those who had drawn,\r\ndiscussed, and matured the instrument in the Convention, explained and\r\ndefended it before the people, and were now elected members of\r\nCongress, to put the new government into motion, and to carry the\r\npowers of the Constitution into beneficial execution. At the head of\r\nthe government was WASHINGTON himself, who had been President of the\r\nConvention; and in his cabinet were others most thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith the history of the Constitution, and distinguished for the part\r\ntaken in its discussion. If these persons were not acquainted with the\r\nmeaning of the Constitution, if they did not undergo stand the work of\r\ntheir own hands, who can understand it, or who shall now interpret it\r\nto us?\r\n\r\nSir, the volume which records the proceedings and debates of the first\r\nsession of the House of Representatives lies before me. I open it, and\r\nI find that, having provided for the administration of the necessary\r\noaths, the very first measure proposed for consideration is, the laying\r\nof imposts; and in the very first committee of the whole into which the\r\nHouse of Representatives ever resolved itself, on this its earliest\r\nsubject, and in this its very first debate, the duty of so laying the\r\nimposts as to encourage manufactures was advanced and enlarged upon by\r\nalmost every speaker, and doubted or denied by none. The first\r\ngentleman who suggests this as the clear duty of Congress, and as an\r\nobject necessary to be attended to, is Mr. Fitzsimons, of Pennsylvania;\r\nthe second, Mr. White, of Virginia; the third, Mr. Tucker, of South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nBut the great leader, Sir, on this occasion, was Mr. Madison. Was _he_\r\nlikely to know the intentions of the Convention and the people? Was\r\n_he_ likely to understand the Constitution? At the second sitting of\r\nthe committee, Mr. Madison explained his own opinions of the duty of\r\nCongress, fully and explicitly. I must not detain you, Sir, with more\r\nthan a few short extracts from these opinions, but they are such as are\r\nclear, intelligible, and decisive. \"The States,\" says he, \"that are\r\nmost advanced in population, and ripe for manufacturers, ought to have\r\ntheir particular interest attended to, in some degree. While these\r\nStates retained the power of making regulations of trade, they had the\r\npower to cherish such institutions. By adopting the present\r\nConstitution, they have thrown the exercise of this power into other\r\nhands; they must have done this with an expectation that those\r\ninterests would not be neglected here.\" In another report of the same\r\nspeech, Mr. Madison is represented as using still stronger language; as\r\nsaying that, the Constitution having taken this power away from the\r\nStates and conferred it on Congress, it would be a _fraud_ on the\r\nStates and on the people were Congress to refuse to exercise it.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison argues, Sir, on this early and interesting occasion, very\r\njustly and liberally, in favor of the general principles of\r\nunrestricted commerce. But he argues, also, with equal force and\r\nclearness, for certain important exceptions to these general\r\nprinciples. The first, Sir, respects those manufactures which had been\r\nbrought forward under encouragement by the State governments. \"It would\r\nbe cruel,\" says Mr. Madison, \"to neglect them, and to divert their\r\nindustry into other channels; for it is not possible for the hand of\r\nman to shift from one employment to another without being injured by\r\nthe change.\" Again: \"There may be some manufactures which, being once\r\nformed, can advance towards perfection without any adventitious aid;\r\nwhile others, for want of the fostering hand of government, will be\r\nunable to go on at all. Legislative provision, therefore, will be\r\nnecessary to collect the proper objects for this purpose; and this will\r\nform another exception to my general principle.\" And again: \"The next\r\nexception that occurs is one on which great stress is laid by some\r\nwell-informed men, and this with great plausibility; that each nation\r\nshould have, within itself, the means of defence, independent of\r\nforeign supplies; that, in whatever relates to the operations of war,\r\nno State ought to depend upon a precarious supply from any part of the\r\nworld. There may be some truth in this remark; and therefore it is\r\nproper for legislative attention.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same debate, Sir, Mr. Burk, from South Carolina, supported a\r\nduty on hemp, for the express purpose of encouraging its growth on the\r\nstrong lands of South Carolina. \"Cotton,\" he said, \"was also in\r\ncontemplation among them, and, if good seed could be procured, he hoped\r\nmight succeed.\" Afterwards, Sir, the cotton was obtained, its culture\r\nwas protected, and it did succeed. Mr. Smith, a very distinguished\r\nmember from the same state, observed: \"It has been said, and justly,\r\nthat the States which adopted this Constitution expected its\r\nadministration would be conducted with a favorable hand. The\r\nmanufacturing States wished the encouragement of manufactures, the\r\nmaritime States the encouragement of shipbuilding, and the agricultural\r\nStates the encouragement of agriculture.\"\r\n\r\nSir, I will detain the Senate by reading no more extracts from these\r\ndebates. I have already shown a majority of the members of South\r\nCarolina, in this very first session, acknowledging this power of\r\nprotection, voting for its exercise, and proposing its extension to\r\ntheir own products. Similar propositions came from Virginia; and,\r\nindeed, Sir, in the whole debate, at whatever page you open the volume,\r\nyou find the power admitted, and you find it applied to the protection\r\nof particular articles, or not applied, according to the discretion of\r\nCongress. No man denied the power, no man doubted it; the only\r\nquestions were, in regard to the several articles proposed to be taxed,\r\nwhether they were fit subjects for protection, and what the amount of\r\nthat protection ought to be. Will gentlemen, Sir, now answer the\r\nargument drawn from these proceedings of the first Congress? Will they\r\nundertake to deny that that Congress did act on the avowed principle of\r\nprotection? Or, if they admit it, will they tell us how those who\r\nframed the Constitution fell, thus early, into this great mistake about\r\nits meaning? Will they tell us how it should happen that they had so\r\nsoon forgotten their own sentiments and their own purposes? I confess I\r\nhave seen no answer to this argument, nor any respectable attempt to\r\nanswer it. And, Sir, how did this debate terminate? What law was\r\npassed? There it stands, Sir, among the statutes, the second law in the\r\nbook. It has a _preamble_, and that preamble expressly recites, that\r\nthe duties which it imposes are laid \"for the support of government,\r\nfor the discharge of the debts of the United States, and _the\r\nencouragement and protection of manufactures_.\" Until, Sir, this early\r\nlegislation, thus coeval with the Constitution itself, thus full and\r\nexplicit, can be explained away, no man can doubt of the meaning of\r\nthat instrument in this respect.\r\n\r\nMr. President, this power of _discrimination_, thus admitted, avowed,\r\nand practised upon in the first revenue act, has never been denied or\r\ndoubted until within a few years past. It was not at all doubted in\r\n1816, when it became necessary to adjust the revenue to a state of\r\npeace. On the contrary, the power was then exercised, not without\r\nopposition as to its expediency, but, as far as I remember or have\r\nunderstood, without the slightest opposition founded on any supposed\r\nwant of constitutional authority. Certainly, South Carolina did not\r\ndoubt it. The tariff of 1816 was introduced, carried through, and\r\nestablished, under the lead of South Carolina. Even the minimum policy\r\nis of South Carolina origin. The honorable gentleman himself supported,\r\nand ably supported, the tariff of 1816. He has informed us, Sir, that\r\nhis speech on that occasion was sudden and off-hand, he being called up\r\nby the request of a friend. I am sure the gentleman so remembers it,\r\nand that it was so; but there is, nevertheless, much method,\r\narrangement, and clear exposition in that extempore speech. It is very\r\nable, very, very much to the point, and very decisive. And in another\r\nspeech, delivered two months earlier, on the proposition to repeal the\r\ninternal taxes, the honorable gentleman had touched the same subject,\r\nand had declared \"_that a certain encouragement ought to be extended at\r\nleast to our woollen and cotton manufactures_.\" I do not quote these\r\nspeeches, Sir, for the purpose of showing that the honorable gentleman\r\nhas changed his opinion: my object is other and higher. I do it for the\r\nsake of saying that that cannot be so plainly and palpably\r\nunconstitutional as to warrant resistance to law, nullification, and\r\nrevolution, which the honorable gentleman and his friends have\r\nheretofore agreed to and acted upon without doubt and without\r\nhesitation. Sir, it is no answer to say that the tariff of 1816 was a\r\nrevenue bill. So are they all revenue bills. The point is, and the\r\ntruth is, that the tariff of 1816, like the rest, _did discriminate_;\r\nit did distinguish one article from another; it did lay duties for\r\nprotection. Look to the case of coarse cottons under the minimum\r\ncalculation: the duty on these was from sixty to eighty per cent.\r\nSomething beside revenue, certainly, was intended in this; and, in\r\nfact, the law cut up our whole commerce with India in that article.\r\n\r\nIt is, Sir, only within a few years that Carolina has denied the\r\nconstitutionality of these protective laws. The gentleman himself has\r\nnarrated to us the true history of her proceedings on this point. He\r\nsays, that, after the passing of the law of 1828, despairing then of\r\nbeing able to abolish the system of protection, political men went\r\nforth among the people, and set up the doctrine that the system was\r\nunconstitutional. \"_And the people_,\" says the honorable gentleman,\r\n\"_received the doctrine_.\" This, I believe, is true, Sir. The people\r\ndid then receive the doctrine; they had never entertained it before.\r\nDown to that period, the constitutionality of these laws had been no\r\nmore doubted in South Carolina than elsewhere. And I suspect it is\r\ntrue, Sir, and I deem it a great misfortune, that, to the present\r\nmoment, a great portion of the people of the State have never yet seen\r\nmore than one side of the argument. I believe that thousands of honest\r\nmen are involved in scenes now passing, led away by one-sided views of\r\nthe question, and following their leaders by the impulses of an\r\nunlimited confidence. Depend upon it, Sir, if we can avoid the shock of\r\narms, a day for reconsideration and reflection will come; truth and\r\nreason will act with their accustomed force, and the public opinion of\r\nSouth Carolina will be restored to its usual constitutional and\r\npatriotic tone.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, I hold South Carolina to her ancient, her cool, her\r\nuninfluenced, her deliberate opinions. I hold her to her own\r\nadmissions, nay, to her own claims and pretensions, in 1789, in the\r\nfirst Congress, and to her acknowledgments and avowed sentiments\r\nthrough a long series of succeeding years. I hold her to the principles\r\non which she led Congress to act in 1816; or, if she have changed her\r\nown opinions, I claim some respect for those who still retain the same\r\nopinions. I say she is precluded from asserting that doctrines, which\r\nshe has herself so long and so ably sustained, are plain, palpable, and\r\ndangerous violations of the Constitution. Mr. President, if the friends\r\nof nullification should be able to propagate their opinions, and give\r\nthem practical effect, they would, in my judgment, prove themselves the\r\nmost skilful \"architects of ruin,\" the most effectual extinguishers of\r\nhigh-raised expectation, the greatest blasters of human hopes, that any\r\nage has produced. They would stand up to proclaim, in tones which would\r\npierce the ears of half the human race, that the last great experiment\r\nof representative government had failed. They would send forth sounds,\r\nat the hearing of which the doctrine of the divine right of kings would\r\nfeel, even in its grave, a returning sensation of vitality and\r\nresuscitation. Millions of eyes, of those who now feed their inherent\r\nlove of liberty on the success of the American example, would turn away\r\nfrom beholding our dismemberment, and find no place on earth whereon to\r\nrest their gratified sight. Amidst the incantations and orgies of\r\nnullification, secession, disunion, and revolution, would be celebrated\r\nthe funeral rites of constitutional and republican liberty.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, if the government do its duty, if it act with firmness and\r\nwith moderation, these opinions cannot prevail. Be assured, Sir, be\r\nassured, that, among the political sentiments of this people, the love\r\nof union is still uppermost. They will stand fast by the Constitution,\r\nand by those who defend it. I rely on no temporary expedients, on no\r\npolitical combination; but I rely on the true American feeling, the\r\ngenuine patriotism of the people, and the imperative decision of the\r\npublic voice. Disorder and confusion, indeed, may arise; scenes of\r\ncommotion and contest are threatened, and perhaps may come. With my\r\nwhole heart, I pray for the continuance of the domestic peace and quiet\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nI desire, most ardently, the restoration of affection and harmony to\r\nall its parts. I desire that every citizen of the whole country may\r\nlook to this government with no other sentiments than those of grateful\r\nrespect and attachment. But I cannot yield even to kind feelings the\r\ncause of the Constitution, the true glory of the country, and the great\r\ntrust which we hold in our hands for succeeding ages. If the\r\nConstitution cannot be maintained without meeting these scenes of\r\ncommotion and contest, however unwelcome, they must come. We cannot, we\r\nmust not, we dare not, omit to do that which, in our judgment, the\r\nsafety of the Union requires. Not regardless of consequences, we must\r\nyet meet consequences; seeing the hazards which surround the discharge\r\nof public duty, it must yet be discharged. For myself, Sir, I shun no\r\nresponsibility justly devolving on me, here or elsewhere, in attempting\r\nto maintain the cause. I am bound to it by indissoluble ties of\r\naffection and duty, and I shall cheerfully partake in its fortunes and\r\nits fate. I am ready to perform my own appropriate part, whenever and\r\nwherever the occasion may call on me, and to take my chance among those\r\nupon whom blows may fall first and fall thickest. I shall exert every\r\nfaculty I possess in aiding to prevent the Constitution from being\r\nnullified, destroyed, or impaired; and even should I see it fall, I\r\nwill still, with a voice feeble, perhaps, but earnest as ever issued\r\nfrom human lips, and with fidelity and zeal which nothing shall\r\nextinguish, call on the PEOPLE to come to its rescue. [2]\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT SARATOGA.\r\n\r\nWe are, my friends, in the midst of a great movement of the people.\r\nThat a revolution in public sentiment on some important questions of\r\npublic policy has begun, and is in progress, it is vain to attempt to\r\nconceal, and folly to deny. What will be the extent of this revolution,\r\nwhat its immediate effects upon political men and political measures,\r\nwhat ultimate influence it may have on the integrity of the\r\nConstitution, and the permanent prosperity of the country, remains to\r\nbe seen. Meantime, no one can deny that an extraordinary excitement\r\nexists in the country, such as has not been witnessed for more than\r\nhalf a century; not local, nor confined to any two, or three, or ten\r\nStates, but pervading the whole, from north to south, and from east to\r\nwest, with equal force and intensity. For an effect so general, a cause\r\nof equal extent must exist. No cause, local or partial, can produce\r\nconsequences so general and universal. In some parts of the country,\r\nindeed, local causes may in some degree add to the flame; but no local\r\ncause, nor any number of local causes, can account for the generally\r\nexcited state of the public mind.\r\n\r\nIn portions of the country devoted to agriculture and manufactures, we\r\nhear complaints of want of market and low prices. Yet there are other\r\nportions of the country, which are consumers, and not producers, of\r\nfood and manufactures; and, as purchasers, they should, it would seem,\r\nbe satisfied with the low prices of which the sellers complain; but in\r\nthese portions, too, of the country, there are dissatisfaction and\r\ndiscontent. Everywhere we find complaining and a desire for change.\r\n\r\nThere are those who think that this excitement among the people will\r\nprove transitory and evanescent. I am not of that opinion. So far as I\r\ncan judge, attention to public affairs among the people of the United\r\nStates, has increased, is increasing, and is not likely to be\r\ndiminished; and this not in one part of the country, but all over it.\r\nThis certainly is the fact, if we may judge from recent information.\r\nThe breeze of popular excitement is blowing everywhere. It fans the air\r\nin Alabama and the Carolinas; and I am of opinion, that, when it shall\r\ncross the Potomac, and range along the Northern Alleghanies, it will\r\ngrow stronger and stronger, until, mingling with the gales of the\r\nEmpire State, and the mountain blasts of New England, it will blow a\r\nperfect hurricane.\r\n\r\nThere are those, again, who think these vast popular meetings are got\r\nup by effort; but I say that no effort could get them up, and no effort\r\ncan keep them down. There must, then, be some general cause that\r\nanimates the whole country. What is that cause? It is upon this point I\r\npropose to give my opinion to-day. I have no design to offend the\r\nfeelings of any, but I mean in perfect plainness to express my views to\r\nthe vast multitude assembled around. I know there are among them many\r\nwho from first to last supported General Jackson. I know there are many\r\nwho, if conscience and patriotism permitted, would support his\r\nsuccessor; and I should ill repay the attention with which they may\r\nhonor me by any reviling or denunciation. Again, I come to play no part\r\nof oratory before you. If there have been times and occasions in my\r\nlife when I might be supposed anxious to exhibit myself in such a\r\nlight, that period has passed, and this is not one of the occasions. I\r\ncome to dictate and prescribe to no man. If my experience, not now\r\nshort, in the affairs of government, entitle my opinions to any\r\nrespect, those opinions are at the service of my fellow-citizens. What\r\nI shall state as facts, I hold myself and my character responsible for;\r\nwhat I shall state as opinions, all are alike at liberty to reject or\r\nto receive. I ask such consideration for them only as the fairness and\r\nsincerity with which they are uttered may claim.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, has excited the whole land, from Maine to Georgia, and\r\ngives us assurance, that, while we are meeting here in New York in such\r\nvast numbers, other like meetings are holding throughout all the\r\nStates? That this cause must be general is certain, for it agitates the\r\nwhole country, and not parts only.\r\n\r\nWhen that fluid in the human system indispensable to life becomes\r\ndisordered, corrupted, or obstructed in its circulation, not the head\r\nor the heart alone suffers; but the whole body--head, heart, and hand,\r\nall the members, and all the extremities--is affected with debility,\r\nparalysis, numbness, and death. The analogy between the human system\r\nand the social and political system is complete; and what the lifeblood\r\nis to the former, circulation, money, currency, is to the latter; and\r\nif that be disordered or corrupted, paralysis must fall on the system.\r\n\r\nThe original, leading, main cause, then, of all our difficulties and\r\ndisasters, is the disordered state of the circulation. This is,\r\nperhaps, not a perfectly obvious truth; and yet it is one susceptible\r\nof easy demonstration. In order to explain this the more readily, I\r\nwish to bring your minds to the consideration of the internal\r\ncondition, and the vast domestic trade, of the United States. Our\r\ncountry is not a small province or canton, but an empire, extending\r\nover a large and diversified surface, with a population of various\r\nconditions and pursuits. It is in this variety that consists its\r\nprosperity; for the different parts become useful one to the other, not\r\nby identity, but by difference, of production, and thus each by\r\ninterchange contributes to the interest of the other. Hence, our\r\ninternal trade, that which carries on this exchange of the products and\r\nindustry of the different portions of the United States, is one of our\r\nmost important interests, I had almost said the most important. Its\r\noperations are easy and silent, not always perceptible, but diffusing\r\nhealth and life throughout the system by the intercourse thus promoted,\r\nfrom neighborhood to neighborhood, and from State to State.\r\n\r\nThis circuit of trade, in a country of such great extent as ours,\r\ndemands, more than in any country under heaven, a uniform currency for\r\nthe whole people; that what is money in Carolina shall be so elsewhere;\r\nthat what the Kentucky drover receives, what the planter of Alabama\r\nsells for, what the laborer in New York gets in pay for his work, and\r\ncarries home to support his family, shall be of ascertained and uniform\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThis is not the time nor the occasion for an essay or dissertation on\r\nmoney; but I mean distinctly to express the opinion, that until the\r\ngeneral government shall take in hand the currency of the country,\r\nuntil that government shall devise some means, I say not what, of\r\nraising the whole currency to the level of gold and silver, there can\r\nbe no prosperity.\r\n\r\nLet us retrace briefly the history of the currency question in this\r\ncountry, a most important branch of the commercial question. I appeal\r\nto all who have studied the history of the times, and of the\r\nConstitution, whether our fathers, in framing the Constitution which\r\nshould unite us in common rights and a common glory, had not also among\r\ntheir chief objects to provide a uniform system of commerce, including\r\na uniform system of currency for the whole country. I especially invite\r\nthe ingenuous youth of the country to go back to the history of those\r\ntimes, and particularly to the Virginia resolutions of 1786, and to the\r\nproceedings of the convention at Annapolis, and they will there find\r\nthat the prevailing motive for forming a general government was, to\r\nsecure a uniform system of commerce, of customhouse duties, and a\r\ngeneral regulation of the trade, external and internal, of the whole\r\ncountry. It was no longer to be the commerce of New York, or of\r\nMassachusetts, but of the United States, to be carried on under that\r\nstar-spangled banner, which was to bear to every shore, and over every\r\nsea, the glorious motto, _E Pluribus Unum_.\r\n\r\nAt the second session, of the first Congress, the United States Bank\r\nwas established. From the incorporation of the bank to the expiration\r\nof its charter,[1] embracing a period of great commercial and political\r\nvicissitudes, the currency furnished by that bank was never objected\r\nto: it, indeed, surpassed the hopes and equalled the desires of\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\nOf the hundreds here, possibly, who supported General Jackson, not one\r\ndreamed that he was elected to put down established institutions and\r\noverthrow the currency of the country. Who, among all those that, in\r\nthe honest convictions of their hearts, cried, Hurrah for Jackson!\r\nbelieved or expected or desired that he would interfere with the Bank\r\nof the United States, or destroy the circulating medium of the country?\r\n[Here there arose a cry from the crowd, \"None! None!\"] I stand here\r\nupon the fact, and defy contradiction from any quarter, that there was\r\nno complaint then, anywhere, of the bank. There never before was a\r\ncountry, of equal extent, where exchanges and circulation were carried\r\non so cheaply, so conveniently, and so securely. General Jackson was\r\ninaugurated in March, 1829, and pronounced an address upon that\r\noccasion, which I heard, as I did the oath which he took to support the\r\nConstitution. In that address were enumerated various objects,\r\nrequiring, as he said, reform; but among them was not the Bank of the\r\nUnited States, nor the currency. This was in March, 1829. In December,\r\n1829, General Jackson came out with the declaration (than which none I\r\nhave ever heard surprised me more), that \"the constitutionality of the\r\nBank of the United States might be well questioned,\" and that it had\r\nfailed to furnish a sound and uniform currency to the country.\r\n\r\nWhat produced this change of views? Down to March of the same year,\r\nnothing of this sort was indicated or threatened. What, then, induced\r\nthe change? [A voice from the crowd said, \"Martin Van Buren.\"] If that\r\nbe so, it was the production of mighty consequences by a cause not at\r\nall proportioned. I will state, in connection with, and in elucidation\r\nof, this subject, certain transactions, which constitute one of those\r\ncontingencies in human affairs, in which casual circumstances, acting\r\nupon the peculiar temper and character of a man of very decided temper\r\nand character, affect the fate of nations. A movement was made in the\r\nsummer of 1829, for the purpose of effecting a change of certain\r\nofficers of the branch of the Bank of the United States in Portsmouth,\r\nNew Hampshire. Mr. Woodbury, then a Senator from New Hampshire,\r\ntransmitted to the president of the bank at Philadelphia a request;\r\npurporting to proceed from merchants and men of business of all\r\nparties, asking the removal of the president of that branch, _not on\r\npolitical grounds_, but as acceptable and advantageous to the business\r\ncommunity. At the same time, Mr. Woodbury addressed a letter to the\r\nthen Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Ingham, suggesting that his\r\ndepartment should, on _political grounds_, obtain from the mother bank\r\nthe removal of the branch president. This letter was transmitted to the\r\npresident of the mother bank, and reached him about the same time with\r\nthe other, so that, looking upon this picture and upon that, upon one\r\nletter, which urged the removal on political grounds, and upon the\r\nother, which denied that political considerations entered into the\r\nmatter at all, he concluded to let things remain as they were. Appeals\r\nwere then artfully made to the President of the United States. His\r\nfeelings were enlisted, and it is well known that, when he had an\r\nobject in view, his character was to go ahead.[2] I mean to speak no\r\nevil nor disrespect of General Jackson. He has passed off the stage to\r\nhis retirement at the Hermitage, which it would be as well, perhaps,\r\nthat friends should not disturb, and where I sincerely wish he may, in\r\ntranquillity, pass the residue of his days. But General Jackson's\r\ncharacter was imperious; he took the back track never; and however his\r\nfriends might differ, or whether they concurred or dissented, they were\r\nfain always to submit. General Jackson put forth the pretension, that\r\nappointments by the bank should have regard to the wishes of the\r\ntreasury; the matter was formally submitted to the directors of the\r\nbank, and they as formally determined that the treasury could not\r\nrightly or properly have any thing to say in the matter. A long and\r\nsomewhat angry correspondence ensued; for General Jackson found in the\r\npresident of the bank a man who had something of his own quality. The\r\nresult was that the bank resisted, and refused the required\r\nacquiescence in the dictation of the treasury.\r\n\r\nThis happened in the summer and autumn of 1829, and in December we had\r\nthe message in which, for the first time, the bank was arraigned and\r\ndenounced. Then came the application of the bank for re-incorporation,\r\nthe passage of a bill for that purpose through both houses, and the\r\nPresidential veto.[3] The Bank of the United States being thus put\r\ndown, a multitude of new State banks sprang up; and next came a law,\r\nadopting some of these as deposit banks. Now, what I have to say in\r\nregard to General Jackson in this matter is this: he said he could\r\nestablish a better currency; and, whether successful or not in this, it\r\nis at least to be said in his favor and praise, that he never did\r\nrenounce the obligation of the federal government to take care of the\r\ncurrency, paper as well as metallic, of the people. It was in\r\nfurtherance of this duty, which he felt called on to discharge, of\r\n\"providing a better currency,\" that he recommended the prohibition of\r\nsmall bills. Why? Because, as it was argued, it would improve the\r\ngeneral mixed currency of the country; and although he did not as\r\ndistinctly as Mr. Madison admit and urge the duty of the federal\r\ngovernment to provide a currency for the people, _he never renounced\r\nit_, but, on the contrary, in his message of December, 1835, held this\r\nexplicit language:--\r\n\r\n\"By the use of the State banks, which do not derive their charters from\r\nthe general government, and are not controlled by its authority, it is\r\nascertained that the moneys of the United States can be collected and\r\ndistributed without loss or inconvenience, and that all the wants of\r\nthe community, in relation to exchange and currency, are supplied as\r\nwell as they have ever been before.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not here a question whether these banks did, or did not, effect\r\nthe purpose which General Jackson takes so much praise to himself for\r\naccomplishing through their agency, that of supplying the country with\r\nas good a currency as it ever enjoyed. But why, if this was not a duty\r\nof the federal government, is it mentioned at all?\r\n\r\nTwo months only after General Jackson had retired, and when his\r\nvigorous hand was no longer there to uphold it, the league of State\r\nbanks fell, and crumbled into atoms; and when Mr. Van Buren had been\r\nonly three months President, he convoked a special session of Congress\r\nfor the ensuing September. The country was in wide-spread confusion,\r\nparalyzed in its commerce, its currency utterly deranged.[4] What was\r\nto be done? What would Mr. Van Buren recommend? He could not go back to\r\nthe Bank of the United States, for he had committed himself against its\r\nconstitutionality; nor could he, with any great prospect of success,\r\nundertake to reconstruct the league of deposit banks; for it had\r\nrecently failed, and the country had lost confidence in it. What, then,\r\nwas to be done? He could go neither backward nor forward. What did he\r\ndo? I mean not to speak disrespectfully, but I say he--_escaped!_\r\nAfraid to touch the fragments of the broken banks, unable to touch the\r\nUnited States Bank, he folded up his arms, and said, The government has\r\nnothing to do with providing a currency for the people. That I may do\r\nhim no wrong, I will read his own language. His predecessors had all\r\nsaid, We _will not_ turn our backs upon this duty of government to\r\nprovide a uniform currency; his language is, We _will_ turn our backs\r\non this duty. He proposes nothing for the country, nothing for the\r\nrelief of commerce, or the regulation of exchanges, but simply the\r\nmeans of getting money into the treasury without loss. In his first\r\nmessage to Congress, he thus expresses himself:--\r\n\r\n\"It is not the province of our government to aid individuals in the\r\ntransfer of their funds, otherwise than through the facilities of the\r\nPost-Office Department. As justly might it be called on to provide for\r\nthe transportation of their merchandise.\r\n\r\n\"If, therefore, I refrain from suggesting to Congress any specific plan\r\nfor regulating the exchanges or the currency, relieving mercantile\r\nembarrassments, or interfering with the ordinary operations of foreign\r\nor domestic commerce, it is from a conviction that such are not within\r\nthe constitutional province of the general government, and that their\r\nadoption would not promote the real and permanent welfare of those they\r\nmight be designed to aid.\"\r\n\r\nI put it to you, my friends, if this is a statesman's argument. You can\r\ntransport your merchandise yourselves; you can build ships, and make\r\nyour own wagons; but can you make a currency? Can you say what shall be\r\nmoney, and what shall not be money, and determine its value here and\r\nelsewhere? Why, it would be as reasonable to say, that the people make\r\nwar for themselves, and peace for themselves, as to say that they may\r\nexercise this other not less exclusive attribute of sovereignty, of\r\nmaking a currency for themselves. He insists that Congress has no power\r\nto regulate currency or exchanges, none to mitigate the embarrassments\r\nof the country, none to relieve its prostrate industry, and even if the\r\npower did exist, it would be unwise, in his opinion, to exercise it!\r\n\r\nLet us compare this declaration with that of one now numbered with the\r\nmighty dead; of one who has left behind a reputation excelled by that\r\nof no other man, as understanding thoroughly the Constitution; of one\r\ntaking a leading part in its inception, and closing his public career\r\nby administering its highest office; I need not name JAMES MADISON.[5]\r\n\r\nIn his message to Congress, in December, 1815, when the war had closed,\r\nand the country was laboring under the disordered currency of that\r\nperiod, the President thus spoke:--\r\n\r\n\"It is essential to every modification of the finances, that the\r\nbenefits of a uniform national currency should be restored to the\r\ncommunity. The absence of the precious metals will, it is believed, be\r\na temporary evil; but until they can again be rendered the general\r\nmedium of exchange, it devolves on the wisdom of Congress to provide a\r\nsubstitute, which shall equally engage the confidence and accommodate\r\nthe wants of the citizens throughout the Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe new doctrine which the administration had set up is one vitally\r\naffecting the business and pursuits of the people at large, extending\r\nits efforts to the interests of every family, and of every individual;\r\nand you must determine for yourselves if it shall be the doctrine of\r\nthe country. But, before determining, look well at the Constitution,\r\nweigh all the precedents, and if names and authority are to be appealed\r\nto, contrast those of President Van Buren with those of the dead\r\npatriarch whose words I have just read to you, and decide accordingly.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Van Buren's message contains a principle,--one altogether\r\nerroneous as a doctrine, and fatal in its operations,--the principle\r\nthat the government has nothing to do with providing a currency for the\r\ncountry; in other words, proposing a separation between the money of\r\nthe government and the money of the people. This is the great error,\r\nwhich cannot be compromised with, which is susceptible of no\r\namelioration or modification, like a disease which admits no remedy and\r\nno palliative but the caustic which shall totally eradicate it.\r\n\r\nDo we not know that there must always be bank paper? Is there a man\r\nhere who expects that he, or his children, or his children's children,\r\nshall see the day when only gold coin, glittering through silk purses,\r\nwill be the currency of the country, to the entire exclusion of bank\r\nnotes? Not one. But we are told that the value of these notes is\r\nquestionable. It is the neglect of government to perform its duties\r\nthat makes them so. You here, in New York, have sound bank paper,\r\nredeemable in coin; and if you were surrounded by a Chinese wall, it\r\nmight be indifferent to you whether government looked after the\r\ncurrency elsewhere or not. But you have daily business relations with\r\nPennsylvania, and with the West, and East, and South, and you have a\r\ndirect interest that their currency too shall be sound; for otherwise\r\nthe very superiority of yours is, to a certain degree, an injury and\r\nloss to you, since you pay in the equivalent of specie for what you\r\nbuy, and you sell for such money as may circulate in the States with\r\nwhich you deal. But New York cannot affect the general restoration of\r\nthe currency, nor any one State, nor any number of States short of the\r\nwhole, and hence the duty of the general government to superintend this\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nBut what does the sub-treasury propose? [6] Its basis is a separation\r\nof the concerns of the treasury from those of the people. It directs\r\nthat there shall be certain vaults, and safes, and rooms for deposit of\r\nthe money of the government. But it has not been for want of adequate\r\nvaults and rooms that we have lost our money, but owing to the hands to\r\nwhich we have intrusted the keys. It is in the character of the\r\nofficers, and not in the strength of bars and vaults, that we must look\r\nfor the security of the public treasure. There are no securities under\r\nthis new system of keeping the public moneys that we had not before;\r\nwhile many that did exist, in the personal character, high trusts, and\r\ndiversified duties of the officers and directors of banks are removed.\r\nMoreover, the number of receiving and disbursing officers is increased,\r\nand the danger to the public treasure is increased in proportion.  The\r\nnext provision is, that money once received into the treasury is not to\r\nbe lent out. Yet the practice of this government hitherto has always\r\nbeen opposed to this policy of locking up the money of the people, when\r\nand while it is not required for the public service. Until this time\r\nthe public deposits, like private deposits, were used by the banks in\r\nwhich they were placed, as some compensation for the trouble of\r\nsafe-keeping, and in furtherance of the general convenience. The next\r\nprovision is that requiring, after 1843, all dues to the government to\r\nbe paid in gold and silver. But what are we promised as the equivalent\r\nfor all this inconvenience and oppression? Why, that the government in\r\nits turn will pay its debts in specie, and that thus what it receives\r\nwith one hand it will pay out with the other, and a metallic\r\ncirculation will be established. I undertake to say, that no greater\r\nfallacy than this was ever uttered; the thing is impossible, and for\r\nthis plain reason. The dues which the government collects come from\r\nindividuals; each pays for himself. But it is far otherwise with the\r\ndisbursements of government. They do not go down to individuals, and,\r\nseeking out the workmen and the laborers, pay to each his dues.\r\nGovernment pays in large sums, to large contractors, and to these it\r\nmay pay gold and silver. But do the gold and silver reach those whom\r\nthe contractor employs? On the contrary, the contractors deal as they\r\nsee fit, with those whom they employ, or of whom they purchase. I speak\r\nof what is in proof. A contractor came to Washington last winter, and\r\nreceived a draft of $180,000 on a specie-paying bank in New York. This\r\nhe sold at ten per cent premium, and with the avails purchased funds in\r\nthe West, with which he paid the producer, the farmer, the laborer.\r\nThis is the operation of specie payments. It gives to the government\r\nhard money, to the rich contractor hard money; but to the producer and\r\nthe laborer it gives paper, and bad paper only. And yet this system is\r\nrecommended as specially favoring the poor man, rather than the rich,\r\nand credit is claimed for this administration as the poor man's friend.\r\n\r\nLet us look a little more nearly at this matter, and see whom, in\r\ntruth, it does favor. Who are the rich in this country? There is very\r\nlittle hereditary wealth among us; and large capitalists are not\r\nnumerous. But some there are, nevertheless, who live upon the interest\r\nof their money; and these, certainly, do not suffer by this new\r\ndoctrine; for their revenues are increased in amount, while the means\r\nof living are reduced in value. There is the money-lender, too, who\r\nsuffers not by the reduction of prices all around him. Who else are the\r\nrich in this country? Why, the holders of office. He who has a fixed\r\nsalary of from $2,500 to $5,000 finds prices falling; but does his\r\nsalary fall? On the contrary, three fourths of that salary will now\r\npurchase more than the whole of it would purchase before; and he,\r\ntherefore, is not dissatisfied with this new state of things.\r\n\r\nI live on the sea-coast of New England, and one of my nearest neighbors\r\nis the largest ship-owner, probably, in the United States. During the\r\npast year, he has made what might suffice for two or three fortunes of\r\nmoderate size; and how has he made it? He sends his ships to Alabama,\r\nLouisiana, Mississippi, to take freights of cotton. This staple,\r\nwhatever may be the price abroad, cannot be suffered to rot at home;\r\nand therefore it is shipped. My friend tells his captain to provision\r\nhis ship at Natchez, for instance, where he buys flour and stores in\r\nthe currency of that region, which is so depreciated that he is able to\r\nsell his bills on Boston at forty-eight per cent premium! Here, at\r\nonce, it will be seen, he gets his provisions for half price, because\r\nprices do not always rise suddenly, as money depreciates. He delivers\r\nhis freight in Europe, and gets paid for it in good money. The\r\ndisordered currency of the country to which he belongs does not follow\r\nand afflict him abroad. He gets his freight in good money, places it in\r\nthe hands of his owner's banker, who again draws at a premium for it.\r\nThe ship-owner, then, makes money, when all others are suffering,\r\n_because he can escape from the influence of the bad laws and bad\r\ncurrency of his own country_.\r\n\r\nNow, I will contrast the story of this neighbor with that of another of\r\nmy neighbors, not rich. He is a New England mechanic, hard-working,\r\nsober, and intelligent, a tool-maker by trade, who wields his own\r\nsledge-hammer. His particular business is the making of augers for the\r\nSouth and Southwest. He has for years employed many hands, and been the\r\nsupport thereby of many families around him, himself, meanwhile,\r\nmoderately prosperous until these evil times came on. Annually,\r\nhowever, for some years, he has been going backwards. Not less\r\nindustrious, not less frugal, he has yet found, that, however good\r\nnominally the prices he might receive at the South and Southwest for\r\nhis tools, the cost of converting his Southern or Western funds into\r\nmoney current in New England was ruinous. He has persevered, however,\r\nalways hoping for some change for the better, and contracting gradually\r\nthe circle of his work and the number of his workmen, until at length,\r\nthe little earnings of the past wasted, and the condition of the\r\ncurrency becoming worse and worse, he is reduced to bankruptcy; and he,\r\nand the twenty families that he supported, are beggared by no fault of\r\ntheir own. What was his difficulty? He _could not escape_ from the\r\nevils of bad laws and bad currency at home; and while his rich\r\nneighbor, who could and did, is made richer by these very causes, he,\r\nthe honest and industrious mechanic, is crushed to the earth; and yet\r\nwe are told that this is a system for promoting the interests of the\r\npoor!\r\n\r\nThis leads me naturally to the great subject of _American labor_, which\r\nhas hardly been considered or discussed as carefully as it deserves.\r\nWhat is _American labor_? It is best described by saying, _it is not_\r\nEuropean labor. Nine tenths of the whole labor of this country is\r\nperformed by those who cultivate the land they or their fathers own, or\r\nwho, in their workshops, employ some little capital of their own, and\r\nmix it up with their manual toil. No such thing exists in other\r\ncountries. Look at the different departments of industry, whether\r\nagricultural, manufacturing, or mechanical, and you will find that, in\r\nalmost all, the laborers mix up some little capital with the work of\r\ntheir hands. The laborer of the United States is the United States.\r\nStrike out the laborers of the United States, including therein all who\r\nin some way or other belong to the industrious and working classes, and\r\nyou reduce the population of the United States from sixteen millions to\r\none million. The American laborer is expected to have a comfortable\r\nhome, decent though frugal living, and to be able to clothe and educate\r\nhis children, to qualify them to take part, as all are called to do, in\r\nthe political affairs and government of their country. Can this be said\r\nof any European laborer? Does he take any share in the government of\r\nhis country, or feel it an obligation to educate his children? In most\r\nparts of Europe, nine tenths of the laborers have no interest in the\r\nsoil they cultivate, nor in the fabrics they produce; no hope, under\r\nany circumstances, of rising themselves, or of raising their children,\r\nabove the condition of a day-laborer at wages; and only know the\r\ngovernment under which they live by the sense of its burdens, which\r\nthey have no voice in mitigating.\r\n\r\nTo compare such a state of labor with the labor of this country, or to\r\nreason from that to ours, is preposterous. And yet the doctrine now is,\r\nnot of individuals only, but of the administration, that the wages of\r\nAmerican labor must be brought down to the level of those of Europe.\r\n\r\nI have said this is not the doctrine of a few individuals; and on that\r\nhead I think injustice has been done to a Senator from Pennsylvania,\r\nwho has been made to bear a large share of the responsibility of\r\nsuggesting such a policy. If I mistake not, the same idea is thrown out\r\nin the President's message at the commencement of the last session, and\r\nin the treasury report. Hear what Mr. Woodbury says:--\r\n\r\n\"Should the States not speedily suspend more of their undertakings\r\nwhich are unproductive, but, by new loans or otherwise, find means to\r\nemploy armies of laborers in consuming rather than raising crops, and\r\nshould prices thus continue in many cases to be unnaturally inflated,\r\nas they have been of late years, in the face of a contracting currency,\r\nthe effect of it on our finances would be still more to lessen exports,\r\nand, consequently, the prosperity and revenue of our foreign trade.\"\r\n\r\nHe is for turning off from the public works these \"armies of laborers,\"\r\nwho consume without producing crops, and thus bring down prices, both\r\nof crops and labor. Diminish the mouths that consume, and multiply the\r\narms that produce, and you have the treasury prescription for\r\nmitigating distress and raising prices! How would that operate in this\r\ngreat State? You have, perhaps, some fifteen thousand men employed on\r\nyour public works, works of the kind that the Secretary calls\r\n\"unproductive\"; and, even with such a demand as they must produce for\r\nprovisions, prices are very low. The Secretary's remedy is to set them\r\nto raise provisions themselves, and thus augment the supply, while they\r\ndiminish the demand. In this way, the wages of labor are to be reduced,\r\nas well as the prices of agricultural productions. But this is not all.\r\nI have in my hand an extract from a speech in the House of\r\nRepresentatives of a zealous supporter, as it appears, of the\r\nadministration, who maintains that, other things being reduced in\r\nproportion, you may reduce the wages of labor, without evil\r\nconsequences. And where does he seek this example? On the shores of the\r\nMediterranean. He fixes upon Corsica and Sardinia. But what is the\r\nCorsican laborer, that he should be the model upon which American labor\r\nis to be formed? Does he know any thing himself? Has he any education,\r\nor does he give any to his children? Has he a home, a freehold, and the\r\ncomforts of life around him? No: with a crust of bread and a handful of\r\nolives, his daily wants are satisfied. And yet, from such a state of\r\nsociety, the laborer of New England, the laborer of the United States,\r\nis to be taught submission to low wages. The extract before me states\r\nthat the wages of Corsica are,\r\n\r\n  \"For the male laborer, 24 cents a day;\r\n   And the female do. 11 cents do.\";--\r\n\r\nboth, I presume, finding their own food. And the honorable gentleman\r\nargues, that, owing to the greater cheapness of other articles, this is\r\nrelatively as much as the American laborer gets; and he illustrates the\r\nfact by this bill of clothing for a Corsican laborer:--\r\n\r\n  \"Jacket,   lasting 24 months, 8 francs;\r\n  Cap,           do. 24     do. 2 do.\r\n  Waistcoat,     do. 36     do. 4 do.\r\n  Pantaloons,    do. 18     do. 5 do.\r\n  Shirt,         do. 12     do. 3 do.\r\n  Pair of shoes, do. 6      do. 6 do.\r\n                              ---\r\n                               28 francs.\"\r\n\r\nEight francs are equal to one dollar and sixty cents, and five francs\r\nto one dollar. Now, what say you, my friends? What will the farmer of\r\nNew York, of Pennsylvania, or of New England say to the idea of walking\r\non Sunday to church, at the head of his family, in his jacket _two\r\nyears old?_ What will the young man say, when, his work ended, he\r\ndesires to visit the families of his neighbors, to the one pair of\r\npantaloons, not quite two years old, indeed, but, as the farmers say of\r\na colt, \"coming two next grass,\" and which, for eighteen months, have\r\nevery day done yeoman's service? Away with it all! Away with this plan\r\nof humbling and degrading the free, intelligent, well-educated, and\r\nwell-paid laborer of the United States to the level of the almost brute\r\nlaborer of Europe!\r\n\r\nThere is not much danger that schemes and doctrines such as these shall\r\nfind favor with the people. They understand their own interest too well\r\nfor that. Gentlemen, I am a farmer, on the sea-shore, [7] and have, of\r\ncourse, occasion to employ some degree of agricultural labor. I am\r\nsometimes also rowed out to sea, being, like other New England men,\r\nfond of occasionally catching a fish, and finding health and\r\nrecreation, in warm weather, from the air of the ocean. For the few\r\nmonths during which I am able to enjoy this retreat from labor, public\r\nor professional, I do not often trouble my neighbors, or they me, with\r\nconversation on politics. It happened, however, about three weeks ago,\r\nthat, on such an excursion as I have mentioned, with one man only with\r\nme, I mentioned this doctrine of the reduction of prices, and asked him\r\nhis opinion of it. He said he did not like it. I replied, \"The wages of\r\nlabor, it is true, are reduced; but then flour and beef, and perhaps\r\nclothing, all of which you buy, are reduced also. What, then, can be\r\nyour objections?\" \"Why,\" said he, \"it is true that flour is now low;\r\nbut then it is an article that may rise suddenly, by means of a scanty\r\ncrop in England, or at home; and if it should rise from five dollars to\r\nten, I do not know for certain that it would fetch the price of my\r\nlabor up with it. But while wages are high, then I am safe; and if\r\nproduce chances to fall, so much the better for me. But there is\r\nanother thing. I have but one thing to sell, that is, my labor; but I\r\nmust buy many things, not only flour, and meat, and clothing, but also\r\nsome articles that come from other countries,--a little sugar, a little\r\ncoffee, a little tea, a little of the common spices, and such like.\r\nNow, I do not see how these foreign articles will be brought down by\r\nreducing wages at home; and before the price is brought down of the\r\nonly thing I have to sell, I want to be sure that the prices will fall\r\nalso, not of a part, but of all the things which I must buy.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Gentlemen, though he will be astonished, or amused, that I should\r\ntell the story before such a vast and respectable assemblage as this, I\r\nwill place the argument of _Seth Peterson_, sometimes farmer and\r\nsometimes fisherman on the coast of Massachusetts, stated to me while\r\npulling an oar with each hand, and with the sleeves of his red shirt\r\nrolled up above his elbows, against the reasonings, the theories, and\r\nthe speeches of the administration and all its friends, in or out of\r\nCongress, and take the verdict of the country, and of the civilized\r\nworld, whether he has not the best of the argument.\r\n\r\nSince I have adverted to this conversation, Gentlemen, allow me to say\r\nthat this neighbor of mine is a man fifty years of age, one of several\r\nsons of a poor man; that by his labor he has obtained some few acres,\r\nhis own unencumbered freehold, has a comfortable dwelling, and plenty\r\nof the poor man's blessings. Of these, I have known six, decently and\r\ncleanly clad, each with the book, the slate, and the map proper to its\r\nage, all going at the same time daily to enjoy the blessing of that\r\nwhich is the great glory of New England, the common free school. Who\r\ncan contemplate this, and thousands of other cases like it, not as\r\npictures, but as common facts, without feeling how much our free\r\ninstitutions, and the policy hitherto pursued, have done for the\r\ncomfort and happiness of the great mass of our citizens? Where in\r\nEurope, where in any part of the world out of our own country, shall we\r\nfind labor thus rewarded, and the general condition of the people so\r\ngood? Nowhere; nowhere! Away, then, with the injustice and the folly of\r\nreducing the cost of productions with us to what is called the common\r\nstandard of the world! Away, then, away at once and for ever, with the\r\nmiserable policy which would bring the condition of a laborer in the\r\nUnited States to that of a laborer in Russia or Sweden, in France or\r\nGermany, in Italy or Corsica! Instead of following these examples, let\r\nus hold up our own, which all nations may well envy, and which,\r\nunhappily, in most parts of the earth, it is easier to envy than to\r\nimitate.\r\n\r\nBut it is the cry and effort of the times to stimulate those who are\r\ncalled poor against those who are called rich; and yet, among those who\r\nurge this cry, and seek to profit by it, there is betrayed sometimes an\r\noccasional sneer at whatever savors of humble life. Witness the\r\nreproach against a candidate now before the people for their highest\r\nhonors, that a log cabin, with plenty of hard cider, is good enough for\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nIt appears to some persons, that a great deal too much use is made of\r\nthe symbol of the log cabin. No man of sense supposes, certainly, that\r\nthe having lived in a log cabin is any further proof of qualification\r\nfor the Presidency, than as it creates a presumption that any one who,\r\nrising from humble condition, or under unfavorable circumstances, has\r\nbeen able to attract a considerable degree of public attention, is\r\npossessed of reputable qualities, moral and intellectual.\r\n\r\nBut it is to be remembered, that this matter of the log cabin\r\noriginated, not with the friends of the Whig candidate, but with his\r\nenemies. Soon after his nomination at Harrisburg, a writer for one of\r\nthe leading administration papers spoke of his \"log cabin,\" and his use\r\nof \"hard cider,\" by way of sneer and reproach. As might have been\r\nexpected, (for pretenders are apt to be thrown off their guard,) this\r\ntaunt at humble life proceeded from the party which claims a monopoly\r\nof the purest democracy. The whole party appeared to enjoy it, or, at\r\nleast, they countenanced it by silent acquiescence; for I do not know\r\nthat, to this day, any eminent individual or any leading newspaper\r\nattached to the administration has rebuked this scornful jeering at the\r\nsupposed humble condition or circumstances in life, past or present, of\r\na worthy man and a war-worn soldier. But it touched a tender point in\r\nthe public feeling. It naturally roused indignation. What was intended\r\nas reproach was immediately seized on as merit. \"Be it so! Be it so!\"\r\nwas the instant burst of the public voice. \"Let him be the log cabin\r\ncandidate. What you say in scorn, we will shout with all our lungs.\r\nFrom this day forward, we have our cry of rally; and we shall see\r\nwhether he who has dwelt in one of the rude abodes of the West may not\r\nbecome the best house in the country!\"\r\n\r\nAll this is natural, and springs from sources of just feeling. Other\r\nthings, Gentlemen, have had a similar origin. We all know that the term\r\n\"Whig\" was bestowed in derision, two hundred years ago, on those who\r\nwere thought too fond of liberty; and our national air of \"Yankee\r\nDoodle\" was composed by British officers, in ridicule of the American\r\ntroops. Yet, ere long, the last of the British armies laid down its\r\narms at Yorktown, while this same air was playing in the ears of\r\nofficers and men. Gentlemen, it is only shallow-minded pretenders who\r\neither make distinguished origin matter of personal merit, or obscure\r\norigin matter of personal reproach. Taunt and scoffing at the humble\r\ncondition of early life affect nobody, in this country, but those who\r\nare foolish enough to indulge in them, and they are generally\r\nsufficiently punished by public rebuke. A man who is not ashamed of\r\nhimself need not be ashamed of his early condition.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it did not happen to me to be born in a log cabin; but my\r\nelder brothers and sisters were born in a log cabin, raised amid the\r\nsnow-drifts of New Hampshire, at a period so early that, when the smoke\r\nfirst rose from its rude chimney, and curled over the frozen hills,\r\nthere was no similar evidence of a white man's habitation between it\r\nand the settlements on the rivers of Canada. Its remains still exist. I\r\nmake to it an annual visit. I carry my children to it, to teach them\r\nthe hardships endured by the generations which have gone before them. I\r\nlove to dwell on the tender recollections, the kindred ties, the early\r\naffections, and the touching narratives and incidents, which mingle\r\nwith all I know of this primitive family abode. I weep to think that\r\nnone of those who inhabited it are now among the living; and if ever I\r\nam ashamed of it, or if I ever fail in affectionate veneration for him\r\nwho reared it, and defended it against savage violence and destruction,\r\ncherished all the domestic virtues beneath its roof, and, through the\r\nfire and blood of a seven years' revolutionary war, shrunk from no\r\ndanger, no toil, no sacrifice, to serve his country, and to raise his\r\nchildren to a condition better than his own, may my name and the name\r\nof my posterity be blotted for ever from the memory of mankind!\r\n\r\nI have now frankly stated my opinions as to the nature of the present\r\nexcitement, and have answered the question I propounded as to the\r\ncauses of the revolution in public sentiment now in progress. Will this\r\nrevolution succeed? Does it move the masses, or is it an ebullition\r\nmerely on the surface? And who is it that opposes the change which\r\nseems to be going forward? [Here some one in the crowd cried out,\r\n\"None, hardly, but the office-holders, oppose it.\"] I hear one say that\r\nthe office-holders oppose it; and that is true. If they were quiet, in\r\nmy opinion, a change would take place almost by common consent. I have\r\nheard of an anecdote, perhaps hardly suited to the sobriety and dignity\r\nof this occasion, but which confirms the answer which my friend in the\r\ncrowd has given to my question. It happened to a farmer's son, that his\r\nload of hay was blown over by a sudden gust, on an exposed plain. Those\r\nnear him, seeing him manifest a degree of distress, which such an\r\naccident would not usually occasion, asked him the reason; he said he\r\nshould not _take on_ so much about it, only father was under the load.\r\nI think it very probable, Gentlemen, that there are many now very\r\nactive and zealous friends, who would not care much whether the wagon\r\nof the administration were blown over or not, if it were not for the\r\nfear that father, or son, or uncle, or brother, might be found under\r\nthe load. Indeed, it is remarkable how frequently the fire of\r\npatriotism glows in the breast of the holders of office. A thousand\r\nfavored contractors shake with horrid fear, lest the proposed change\r\nshould put the interests of the public in great danger. Ten thousand\r\npost-offices, moved by the same apprehension, join in the cry of alarm,\r\nwhile a perfect earthquake of disinterested remonstrance proceeds from\r\nthe custom-houses. Patronage and favoritism tremble and quake, through\r\nevery limb and every nerve, lest the people should be found in favor of\r\na change, which might endanger the liberties of the country, or at\r\nleast break down its present eminent and distinguished prosperity, by\r\nabandoning the measures, so wise, so beneficent, so successful, and so\r\npopular, which the present administration has pursued!\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, we have all sober and important duties to perform. I\r\nhave not addressed you to-day for the purpose of joining in a premature\r\nnote of triumph, or raising a shout for anticipated victories. We are\r\nin the controversy, not through it. It is our duty to spare no pains to\r\ncirculate information, and to spread the truth far and wide. Let us\r\npersuade those who differ from us, if we can, to hear both sides. Let\r\nus remind them that we are all embarked together, with a common\r\ninterest and a common fate. And let us, without rebuke or unkindness,\r\nbeseech them to consider what the good of the whole requires, what is\r\nbest for them and for us.\r\n\r\nThere are two causes which keep back thousands of honest men from\r\njoining those who wish for a change. The first of these is the fear of\r\nreproach from former associates, and the pain which party denunciation\r\nis capable of inflicting. But, surely, the manliness of the American\r\ncharacter is superior to this! Surely, no American citizen will feel\r\nhimself chained to the wheels of any party, nor bound to follow it,\r\nagainst his conscience and his sense of the interest of the country.\r\nResolution and decision ought to dissipate such restraints, and to\r\nleave men free at once to act upon their own convictions. Unless this\r\ncan be done, party has entailed upon us a miserable slavery, by\r\ncompelling us to act against our consciences on questions of the\r\ngreatest importance.\r\n\r\nThe other cause is the constant cry that the party of the\r\nadministration is the true democratic party, or the more popular party\r\nin the government and in the country. The falsity of this claim has not\r\nbeen sufficiently exposed. It should have been met, and should be now\r\nmet, not only by denial, but by proof. If they mean the new\r\ndemocracy,--the cry against credit, against industry, against labor,\r\nagainst a man's right to leave his own earnings to his own\r\nchildren,--why, then, doubtless, they are right; all this sort of\r\ndemocracy is theirs. But if by democracy they mean a conscientious and\r\nstern adherence to the true popular principles of the Constitution and\r\nthe government, then I think they have very little claim to it. Is the\r\naugmentation of executive power a democratic principle? Is the\r\nseparation of the currency of the government from the currency of the\r\npeople a democratic principle? Is the imbodying a large military force,\r\nin time of peace, a democratic principle?\r\n\r\nLet us entreat honest men not to take names for things, nor pretences\r\nfor proofs. If democracy, in any constitutional sense, belongs to our\r\nadversaries, let them show their title and produce their evidence. Let\r\nthe question be examined; and let not intelligent and well-meaning\r\ncitizens be kept to the support of measures which in their hearts and\r\nconsciences they disapprove, because their authors put forth such loud\r\nclaims to the sole possession of regard for the people.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens of the County of Saratoga, in taking leave of you, I\r\ncannot but remind you how distinguished a place your county occupies in\r\nthe history of the country. I cannot be ignorant, that in the midst of\r\nyou are many, at this moment, who saw in this neighborhood the triumph\r\nof republican arms in the surrender of General Burgoyne. I cannot doubt\r\nthat a fervent spirit of patriotism burns in their breasts and in the\r\nbreasts of their children. They helped to save their country amidst the\r\nstorms of war; they will help to save it, I am fully persuaded, in the\r\npresent severe civil crisis. I verily believe it is true, that, of all\r\nthat are left to us from the Revolution, nine tenths are with us in the\r\nexisting contest. If there be living a Revolutionary officer, or\r\nsoldier, who has joined in the attacks upon General Harrison's military\r\ncharacter, I have not met with him. It is not, therefore, in the county\r\nof Saratoga, that a cause sustained by such means is likely to prevail.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, the great question is now before the country. If, with\r\nthe experience of the past, the American people think proper to confirm\r\npower in the hands which now hold it, and thereby sanction the leading\r\npolicy of the administration, it will be your duty and mine to bow,\r\nwith submission, to the public will; but, for myself, I shall not\r\nbelieve it possible for me to be of service to the country, in any\r\ndepartment of public life. I shall look on, with no less love of\r\ncountry than ever, but with fearful forebodings of what may be near at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nBut I do not at all expect that result. I fully believe the change is\r\ncoming. If we all do our duty, we shall restore the government to its\r\nformer policy, and the country to its former prosperity. And let us\r\nhere, to-day, fellow-citizens, with full resolution and patriotic\r\npurpose of heart, give and take pledges, that, until this great\r\ncontroversy be ended, our time, our talents, our efforts, are all due,\r\nand shall all be faithfully given, to OUR COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour solemn announcement, Mr. Chief Justice, has confirmed the sad\r\nintelligence which had already reached us, through the public channels\r\nof information, and deeply afflicted us all.\r\n\r\nJoseph Story, one of the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, and for many years the presiding judge of this Circuit,\r\ndied on Wednesday evening last, at his house in Cambridge, wanting only\r\na few days for the completion of the sixty-sixth year of his age.\r\n\r\nThis most mournful and lamentable event has called together the whole\r\nBar of Suffolk, and all connected with the courts of law or the\r\nprofession. It has brought you, Mr. Chief Justice, and your associates\r\nof the Bench of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, into the midst of\r\nus; and you have done us the honor, out of respect to the occasion, to\r\nconsent to preside over us, while we deliberate on what is due, as well\r\nto our own afflicted and smitten feelings, as to the exalted character\r\nand eminent distinction of the deceased judge. The occasion has drawn\r\nfrom his retirement, also, that venerable man, whom we all so much\r\nrespect and honor, (Judge Davis,) who was, for thirty years, the\r\nassociate of the deceased upon the same Bench. It has called hither\r\nanother judicial personage, now in retirement, (Judge Putnam,) but long\r\nan ornament of that Bench of which you are now the head, and whose\r\nmarked good fortune it is to have been the professional teacher of Mr.\r\nJustice Story, and the director of his early studies. He also is\r\npresent to whom this blow comes near; I mean, the learned judge (Judge\r\nSprague) from whose side it has struck away a friend and a highly\r\nvenerated official associate. The members of the Law School at\r\nCambridge, to which the deceased was so much attached, and who returned\r\nthat attachment with all the ingenuousness and enthusiasm of educated\r\nand ardent youthful minds, are here also, to manifest their sense of\r\ntheir own severe deprivation, as well as their admiration of the bright\r\nand shining professional example which they have so loved to\r\ncontemplate,--an example, let me say to them, and let me say to all, as\r\na solace in the midst of their sorrows, which death hath not touched\r\nand which time cannot obscure.\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice, one sentiment pervades us all. It is that of the\r\nmost profound and penetrating grief, mixed, nevertheless, with an\r\nassured conviction, that the great man whom we deplore is yet with us\r\nand in the midst of us. He hath not wholly died. He lives in the\r\naffections of friends and kindred, and in the high regard of the\r\ncommunity. He lives in our remembrance of his social virtues, his warm\r\nand steady friendships, and the vivacity and richness of his\r\nconversation. He lives, and will live still more permanently, by his\r\nwords of written wisdom, by the results of his vast researches and\r\nattainments, by his imperishable legal judgments, and by those\r\njuridical disquisitions which have stamped his name, all over the\r\ncivilized world, with the character of a commanding authority. \"Vivit,\r\nenim, vivetque semper; atque etiam latius in memoria hominum et sermone\r\nversabitur, postquam ab oculis recessit.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice, there are consolations which arise to mitigate our\r\nloss, and shed the influence of resignation over unfeigned and\r\nheart-felt sorrow. We are all penetrated with gratitude to God that the\r\ndeceased lived so long; that he did so much for himself, his friends,\r\nthe country, and the world; that his lamp went out, at last, without\r\nunsteadiness or flickering. He continued to exercise every power of his\r\nmind without dimness or obscuration, and every affection of his heart\r\nwith no abatement of energy or warmth, till death drew an impenetrable\r\nveil between us and him. Indeed, he seems to us now, as in truth he is,\r\nnot extinguished or ceasing to be, but only withdrawn; as the clear sun\r\ngoes down at its setting, not darkened, but only no longer seen.\r\n\r\nThis calamity, Mr. Chief Justice, is not confined to the bar or the\r\ncourts of this Commonwealth. It will be felt by every bar throughout\r\nthe land, by every court, and indeed by every intelligent and well\r\ninformed man in or out of the profession. It will be felt still more\r\nwidely, for his reputation had a still wider range. In the High Court\r\nof Parliament, in every tribunal in Westminster Hall, in the\r\njudicatories of Paris and Berlin, of Stockholm and St. Petersburg, in\r\nthe learned universities of Germany, Italy, and Spain, by every eminent\r\njurist in the civilized world, it will be acknowledged that a great\r\nluminary has fallen from the firmament of public jurisprudence.[1]\r\n\r\nSir, there is no purer pride of country than that in which we may\r\nindulge when we see America paying back the great debt of civilization,\r\nlearning, and science to Europe. In this high return of light for light\r\nand mind for mind, in this august reckoning and accounting between the\r\nintellects of nations, Joseph Story was destined by Providence to act,\r\nand did act, an important part. Acknowledging, as we all acknowledge,\r\nour obligations to the original sources of English law, as well as of\r\ncivil liberty, we have seen in our generation copious and salutary\r\nstreams turning and running backward, replenishing their original\r\nfountains, and giving a fresher and a brighter green to the fields of\r\nEnglish jurisprudence. By a sort of reversed hereditary transmission,\r\nthe mother, without envy or humiliation, acknowledges that she has\r\nreceived a valuable and cherished inheritance from the daughter. The\r\nprofession in England admits with frankness and candor, and with no\r\nfeeling but that of respect and admiration, that he whose voice we have\r\nso recently heard within these walls, but shall now hear no more, was\r\nof all men who have yet appeared, most fitted by the comprehensiveness\r\nof his mind, and the vast extent and accuracy of his attainments, to\r\ncompare the codes of nations, to trace their differences to difference\r\nof origin, climate, or religious or political institutions, and to\r\nexhibit, nevertheless, their concurrence in those great principles upon\r\nwhich the system of human civilization rests.\r\n\r\nJustice, Sir, is the great interest of man on earth. It is the ligament\r\nwhich holds civilized beings and civilized nations together. Wherever\r\nher temple stands, and so long as it is duly honored, there is a\r\nfoundation for social security, general happiness, and the improvement\r\nand progress of our race. And whoever labors on this edifice with\r\nusefulness and distinction, whoever clears its foundations, strengthens\r\nits pillars, adorns its entablatures, or contributes to raise its\r\naugust dome still higher in the skies, connects himself, in name, and\r\nfame, and character, with that which is and must be as durable as the\r\nframe of human society.\r\n\r\nAll know, Mr. Chief Justice, the pure love of country which animated\r\nthe deceased, and the zeal, as well as the talent, with which he\r\nexplained and defended her institutions. His work on the Constitution\r\nof the United States is one of his most eminently successful labors.\r\nBut all his writings, and all his judgments, all his opinions, and the\r\nwhole influence of his character, public and private, leaned strongly\r\nand always to the support of sound principles, to the restraint of\r\nillegal power, and to the discouragement and rebuke of licentious and\r\ndisorganizing sentiments. \"Ad rempublicam firmandam, et ad stabiliendas\r\nvires, et sanandum populum, omnis ejus pergebat institutio.\"\r\n\r\nBut this is not the occasion, Sir, nor is it for me to consider and\r\ndiscuss at length the character and merits of Mr. Justice Story, as a\r\nwriter or a judge. The performance of that duty, with which this Bar\r\nwill no doubt charge itself, must be deferred to another opportunity,\r\nand will be committed to abler hands. But in the homage paid to his\r\nmemory, one part may come with peculiar propriety and emphasis from\r\nourselves. We have known him in private life. We have seen him descend\r\nfrom the bench, and mingle in our friendly circles. We have known his\r\nmanner of life, from his youth up. We can bear witness to the strict\r\nuprightness and purity of his character, his simplicity and\r\nunostentatious habits, the ease and affability of his intercourse, his\r\nremarkable vivacity amidst severe labors, the cheerful and animating\r\ntones of his conversation, and his fast fidelity to friends. Some of\r\nus, also, can testify to his large and liberal charities, not\r\nostentatious or casual, but systematic and silent, --dispensed almost\r\nwithout showing the hand, and falling and distilling comfort and\r\nhappiness, like the dews of heaven. But we can testify, also, that in\r\nall his pursuits and employments, in all his recreations, in all his\r\ncommerce with the world, and in his intercourse with the circle of his\r\nfriends, the predominance of his judicial character was manifest. He\r\nnever forgot the ermine which he wore. The judge, the judge, the useful\r\nand distinguished judge, was the great picture which he kept constantly\r\nbefore his eyes, and to a resemblance of which all his efforts, all his\r\nthoughts, all his life, were devoted. We may go the world over, without\r\nfinding a man who shall present a more striking realization of the\r\nbeautiful conception of D'Aguesseau: \"C'est en vain que l'on cherche a\r\ndistinguer en lui la personne privée et la personne publique; un même\r\nesprit les anime, un même objet les réunit; l'homme, le père de\r\nfamille, le citoyen, tout est en lui consacré à la gloire du magistrat.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice, one may live as a conqueror, a king, or a\r\nmagistrate; but he must die as a man. The bed of death brings every\r\nhuman being to his pure individuality; to the intense contemplation of\r\nthat deepest and most solemn of all relations, the relation between the\r\ncreature and his Creator. Here it is that fame and renown cannot assist\r\nus; that all external things must fail to aid us; that even friends,\r\naffection, and human love and devotedness, cannot succor us. This\r\nrelation, the true foundation of all duty, a relation perceived and\r\nfelt by conscience and confirmed by revelation, our illustrious friend,\r\nnow deceased, always acknowledged.\r\n\r\nHe reverenced the Scriptures of truth, honored the pure morality which\r\nthey teach, and clung to the hopes of future life which they impart. He\r\nbeheld enough in nature, in himself, and in all that can be known of\r\nthings seen, to feel assured that there is a Supreme Power, without\r\nwhose providence not a sparrow falleth to the ground. To this gracious\r\nbeing he entrusted himself for time and for eternity; and the last\r\nwords of his lips ever heard by mortal ears were a fervent supplication\r\nto his Maker to take him to himself.

In August of\r\nthat year (1816) he removed his family to Boston, and decided to devote\r\nhimself exclusively to the profession of the law. He had won a high\r\nposition both in law and politics in New Hampshire. The change of\r\nresidence marks an era in the life of Mr. Webster. Mr. Lodge says that\r\nthere is a tradition that the worthies of the Puritan city were\r\ndisposed at first to treat the newcomer somewhat cavalierly, but that\r\nthey soon learned that it was worse than useless to attempt such a\r\ncourse with a man whose magnificent physical and intellectual bearing\r\nwon the admiration of all who met him.\r\n\r\nHe now began a career of great professional distinction, and took a\r\nplace at the Boston bar even more conspicuous than his friends had\r\nanticipated--that of an equal of the most famous of its members. His\r\ncases called him before the Massachusetts Supreme Court, the Circuit\r\nCourt of the United States, and the United States Supreme Court. Among\r\nthe first cases which came to him on his retirement from political life\r\nwas the Goodridge Robbery Case, the argument in which was addressed to\r\nthe jury at the term of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts\r\nheld at Ipswich in April, 1817.\r\n\r\nThe singularly dramatic story of the prosecutor, the almost universal\r\nbelief in the guilt of the accused, both by the public and by the\r\nmembers of the Essex bar, and the impossibility of accounting for the\r\nmotive (self-robbery) assumed by the defence, make this exhibition of\r\nMr. Webster's \"acute, penetrating, and terrifying\" power of\r\ncross-examination,--by which such a complicated and ingenious story was\r\nunravelled,--one of the most memorable in the history of the\r\n\r\nMassachusetts bar. It is a model of close, simple, unadorned argument,\r\nadapted to the minds of the jurymen. In it there are no attempts to\r\ncarry the jury off their feet by lofty appeals to their sense of\r\njustice, nor to cover the weak points in the case by fine oratory. The\r\noft-repeated, \"It is for the jury to determine,\" illustrates Mr.\r\nWebster's respect for the common sense of the jurymen before him and\r\nhis reliance upon evidence to win the case. The following are the facts\r\nrelating to the case:--Major Goodridge of Bangor, Maine, professed to\r\nhave been robbed of a large sum of money at nine o'clock on the night\r\nof Dec. 19, 1816, while travelling on horseback, near the bridge\r\nbetween Exeter and Newburyport. In the encounter with the robbers he\r\nreceived a pistol wound in his left hand; he was then dragged from his\r\nhorse into a field, beaten until insensible, and robbed. On recovering,\r\nhe procured the assistance of several persons, and with a lantern\r\nreturned to the place of the robbery and found his watch and some\r\npapers. The next day he went to Newburyport, and remained ill for\r\nseveral weeks, suffering from delirium caused by the shock. When he\r\nrecovered he set about the discovery of the robbers. His story seemed\r\nso probable that he had the sympathy of all the country-folk. He at\r\nonce charged with the crime Levi and Laban Kenniston, two poor men, who\r\nlived in an obscure part of the town of Newmarket, New Hampshire, and\r\nfinding some of his money (which he had previously marked) in their\r\ncellar, he had them arrested, and held for trial. By and by a few of\r\nthe people began to doubt the story of Goodridge; this led him to\r\nrenewed efforts, and he arrested the toll gatherer, Mr. Pearson, in\r\nwhose house, by the aid of a conjurer, he found some of his money. On\r\nexamination by the magistrate, Pearson was discharged. It now became\r\nnecessary to find some accomplice of the Kennistons, and he arrested\r\none Taber of Boston, whom he had seen (he said) on his way up, and from\r\nwhom he had obtained his information against the Kennistons. In Taber's\r\nhouse was found some of the money; he was accordingly bound over for\r\ntrial with the Kennistons. As none of these men lived near the scene of\r\nthe robbery, Mr. Jackman, who, soon after the robbery, had gone to New\r\nYork, was arrested, his house searched, and some of the money found in\r\nthe garret. The guilt of these men seemed so conclusive that no eminent\r\nmember of the Essex bar would undertake their defence. A few of those\r\nwho mistrusted Goodridge determined to send to Suffolk County for\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster had been well known in New Hampshire, and his services were\r\nat once secured; without having time to examine any of the details of\r\nthe case--as he had arrived at Ipswich on the night before the\r\ntrial--he at once undertook the defence of the Kennistons and secured\r\ntheir acquittal. The indictment against Taber was _nol prossed_. Later,\r\nhe defended Jackman and secured his acquittal. Mr. Pearson brought\r\naction against Goodridge for malicious prosecution, and was awarded\r\n$2000, but Goodridge took the poor debtor's oath and left the State.\r\n\r\nCf. Curtis's _Life of Webster_, Ch. VIII.; Everett's _Memoir of\r\nWebster_, in Vol. I. of Webster's Works.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE CASE_.\r\n\r\nMarch, 1818.\r\n\r\nWithin a year after the defence of the Kennistons, Mr. Webster was\r\ncalled upon to defend his Alma Mater against the acts of the\r\nLegislature of his native State.\r\n\r\nThe case was one of the most interesting ever argued before the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, because there were involved in it certain\r\nconstitutional questions which had never been tested. \"Mr. Webster by\r\nhis management of this case,\" says Edward Everett, \"took the lead in\r\nestablishing what might almost be called a new school of constitutional\r\nlaw.\" Not until within a few years has the complete history of the case\r\nbeen accessible. In 1879, a volume of \"Dartmouth College Causes\" was\r\npublished by Mr. John M. Shirley, and in it we have, for the first\r\ntime, a clear statement of all the points relating to the origin and\r\ndevelopment of the case.\r\n\r\nDartmouth College was originally a charity school, and was founded by\r\nEleazor Wheelock at Lebanon, Connecticut, in 1754. Afterwards private\r\nsubscriptions were solicited in England, and the Earl of Dartmouth was\r\na large donor and became one of the trustees. The site was soon moved\r\nto Hanover, New Hampshire, where large grants of land had been made by\r\nthe proprietors. It was chartered by the Crown in 1769, and was created\r\na perpetual corporation, with Dr. Wheelock as founder and President; he\r\nwas empowered to name his own successor subject to the approval of the\r\ntrustees, to whom was given power to fill vacancies in their own body\r\nand to make laws for the College subject to the Crown.\r\n\r\nIt seems that in his early days Dr. Wheelock had a controversy on\r\nreligious matters with Dr. Bellamy. These men were graduates of Yale;\r\nthe former was a Presbyterian, and the latter a Congregationalist. This\r\nreligious war was carried on by the successors of these men, the son of\r\nDr. Wheelock, and President of the College, and a pupil of Dr. Bellamy,\r\nwho had been elected a trustee; it soon, however, became a political\r\ncontest between factions of the trustees, one of which objected to what\r\nit called the \"family dynasty.\" In 1809 this faction became a majority\r\nand opposed the other so vigorously that in 1815 the Wheelock party set\r\nforth its case in a lengthy pamphlet. Much ink was shed upon both sides\r\nas a result. Wheelock then sent a memorial to the Legislature charging\r\nthe trustees with violation of trust and religious intolerance, and\r\nprayed for an investigation by a committee of the Legislature. The\r\ntrustees were Federalists and Congregationalists, the ruling power in\r\nState and Church. Mr. Mason, Mr. Webster's old antagonist at the New\r\nHampshire bar, was secured as counsel for the trustees. The Wheelock\r\nparty made advances to Mr. Webster, but he saw that the case was fast\r\nassuming a political tone, and he declined the offer. Contrary to Mr.\r\nMason's advice, the trustees removed President Wheelock, and appointed\r\nRev. Francis Brown in his place. As a result all the Democrats and all\r\nreligious orders, other than the Congregational, united against the\r\ntrustees--and the political die was cast.\r\n\r\nAt the next election the Democrats carried the State, and the Governor\r\nin his message took occasion to declare against the trustees. The\r\nLegislature, in June, 1816, passed an act to reorganize the College,\r\nand under this law the new trustees were chosen; thus the College\r\nbecame a State institution. Woodward, the Secretary of the old board,\r\nhad been removed, and became the Secretary of the newly constituted\r\nboard. Suit was brought against him by the old board, for the College\r\nseal and other property, and the case in charge of Mr. Mason and Judge\r\nSmith came up for trial in May, 1817; it was argued and then went over\r\nto the September term of the same year at Exeter. It was at this stage\r\nof the proceedings that Mr. Webster joined the counsel for the College.\r\nHe made the closing argument of such force and pathos as to draw tears\r\nfrom the crowd in the court-room. The decision was against the College.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Mason's brief we find that there were three points made against\r\nthe Acts of the Legislature: (1) that they were not within the power of\r\nthat body; (2) that they violated the Constitution of New Hampshire;\r\nand (3) that they violated the Constitution of the United States, or\r\nthe right of private contracts. The third point was not, however,\r\npressed by the counsel, and was not considered as very important; they\r\nbased their case mostly upon the first point: that the College was\r\nfounded by private parties, for special purposes, and that any quarrel\r\nof the trustees was a question for the courts to settle, and not for\r\nthe Legislature. When it was decided against them, they removed the\r\ncase to the Supreme Court of the United States on this one point, that\r\nthe acts impaired the obligation of contracts. The friends of the\r\nCollege now desired Mr. Webster to take entire charge of the case; he\r\nconsented, and selected as his assistant, Mr. Hopkinson, of\r\nPhiladelphia. Mr. Holmes of Maine and Mr. Wirt conducted the defence.\r\n\r\nThe case was heard on March 10, 1818, and was opened by Mr. Webster.\r\nWith the notes and minutes of the previous counsel Mr. Webster was\r\nfamiliar, and he said that the credit of the legal points and theories\r\nhe set forth was due to them; he was only the arranger and reciter of\r\nwhat they had prepared. Mr. Webster had a remarkable power of selecting\r\nand using the material of other men, but he was always ready to give\r\nthem the credit due.\r\n\r\nWith a skill and judgment which Chief Justice Marshall said he never\r\nsaw equalled, Mr. Webster outlined the question at issue, and by his\r\nmarvellous adroitness in arranging, and clearness in presenting the\r\nfacts, together with that wealth of legal and historical illustration\r\nwith which he was always so well endowed, he seemed to carry with him\r\nevery man in the court-room. Such was the ease, grace, and fascination\r\nof his argument, that Justice Story, who sat, pen in hand, to take\r\nnotes, was completely absorbed and forgot his pen and paper.\r\n\r\n[1]P. 58, l. 15. I. Here, the argument being ended, Mr. Webster stood\r\nstill for some time before the court, while every eye was fixed upon\r\nhim, and then addressing the Chief Justice, he proceeded with that\r\nnoble peroration which has become one of the masterpieces of eloquence,\r\nand which is an expansion of the closing argument which he delivered at\r\nthe previous trial in New Hampshire. This does not appear in the\r\nprinted argument; I have added it from the report of Dr. Goodrich.\r\n\r\n[2]P. 59, l. 5. 1. I give the beautiful description which Dr. Goodrich\r\nwrote to Mr. Choate in 1853. \"Here the feelings, which he had thus far\r\nsucceeded in keeping down, broke forth. His lips quivered; his firm\r\ncheeks trembled with emotion; his eyes were filled with tears; his\r\nvoice choked, and he seemed struggling to the utmost simply to gain\r\nthat mastery over himself which might save him from an unmanly burst of\r\nfeeling. I will not attempt to give you the few broken words of\r\ntenderness in which he went on to speak of his attachment for the\r\ncollege. The whole seemed to be mingled throughout with recollections\r\nof father, mother, brother, and all the privations and trials through\r\nwhich he had made his way into life. Every one saw that it was wholly\r\nunpremeditated, a pressure on his heart, which sought relief in words\r\nand tears.\" The court-room during these two or three minutes presented\r\nan extraordinary spectacle. Chief Justice Marshall, with his tall and\r\ngaunt figure, bent over as if to catch the slightest whisper, the deep\r\nfurrows of his cheek expanded with emotion, and his eyes suffused with\r\ntears; Mr. Justice Washington at his side, with his small and emaciated\r\nframe, and countenance more like marble than I ever saw on any other\r\nhuman being--leaning forward with an eager troubled look; and the\r\nremainder of the Court at the two extremities, pressing, as it were,\r\ntoward a single point, while the audience below were wrapping\r\nthemselves around in closer folds beneath the bench, to catch each look\r\nand every feature of the speaker's face. If a painter could give us the\r\nscene on canvas,--those forms and countenances, and Daniel Webster as\r\nhe there stood in their midst,--it would be one of the most touching\r\npictures in the history of eloquence. One thing it taught me, that the\r\n_pathetic_ depends not merely on the words uttered, but still more on\r\nthe estimate we put upon him who utters them. There was not one among\r\nthe strong-minded men of that assembly who could think it unmanly to\r\nweep, when he saw standing before him the man who had made such an\r\nargument, melted into the tenderness of a child. Mr. Webster had now\r\nrecovered his composure, and, fixing his keen eye on the Chief Justice,\r\nin that deep tone with which he sometimes thrilled the heart of an\r\naudience, continued.\"[3] L. 10. 2. When Mr. Webster sat down, there was\r\na stillness as of death in the court-room, and when the audience had\r\nslowly recovered itself the replies of the opposing counsel were made,\r\nbut seemed weak indeed in comparison to what had just been heard. On\r\nthe conclusion of the arguments, the Chief Justice announced that the\r\nCourt could not agree, and that the case must be continued to the next\r\nterm. During the interim, the utmost effort was used by the friends of\r\nthe College, the press, and the Federalists, to bring the matter before\r\nthe public, and to impress the judges with the condition of the public\r\nmind. The defence prepared to renew the contest, and able counsel was\r\nsecured. At the next term, however, the Chief Justice ruled that the\r\nActs of the Legislature were void, as they impaired the right of\r\nprivate contract. Of this argument Mr. Justice Story said: \"For the\r\nfirst hour we listened with perfect astonishment; for the second hour\r\nwith perfect delight; and for the third hour with perfect conviction.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lodge says: \"From the day when it was announced, to the present\r\ntime, the Doctrine of Marshall in the Dartmouth College Case has\r\ncontinued to exert an enormous influence.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the trial Mr. Hopkinson wrote to the President of the College and\r\nsaid: \"I would have an inscription over the door of your building:\r\n'Founded by Eleazor Wheelock, Refounded by Daniel Webster.'\"\r\n\r\nCf.

This field of occasional oratory was a new and\r\npeculiar one for him. He had never before spoken upon a great\r\nhistorical subject demanding not only wealth of imagination, but the\r\npeculiar quality of mind and heart which unites dignity and depth of\r\nthought with ease and grace of manner. But he was equal to the task.\r\nThe simplicity and beauty of the thought, the grand and inspiring\r\nmanner of presentation, gave evidence of commanding genius, and gave\r\nMr. Webster a place in the front rank of orators and stylists.\r\n\r\n\"I never saw him,\" says Mr. Ticknor, \"when he seemed to me to be more\r\nconscious of his own powers, or to have a more true and natural\r\nenjoyment from their possession.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Adams, who had heard Pitt and Fox, Burke and Sheridan, says: \"It\r\nis the effort of a great mind, richly stored with every species of\r\ninformation.

The\r\nrequest was granted on condition that the government of the colony\r\nshould be permitted to erect a monument to his memory.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies of burial were performed, but no steps were taken to\r\nbuild the monument. General Warren was, at the time of his death, Grand\r\nMaster of the Masonic Lodges of America, and as nothing had been done\r\ntoward erecting a memorial, King Solomon's Lodge of Charlestown voted\r\nto erect a monument. The land was purchased, and a monument dedicated\r\nby the Lodge Dec. 2, 1794. It was a wooden pillar of Tuscan order,\r\neighteen feet high, raised on a pedestal ten feet in height. The pillar\r\nwas surmounted by a gilt urn. An appropriate inscription was placed on\r\nthe south side of the pedestal.\r\n\r\nThe half-century from the date of the battle was at hand, and, despite\r\na resolution of Congress and the efforts of a committee of the\r\nLegislature of Massachusetts, no suitable monument had been erected by\r\nthe people. It was then that, at the suggestion of William Tudor, the\r\nmatter was taken up in earnest and an association was formed known as\r\nthe Bunker Hill Monument Association. Ground was broken for the\r\nmonument June 7, 1825. On the morning of the 17th of June, 1825, the\r\nceremonies of laying the corner-stone of the monument took place. It\r\nwas a typical June day, and thousands flocked to see the pageant and to\r\nhear the greatest orator in the land.\r\n\r\nThe procession started from the State House at ten o'clock. The\r\nmilitary led the van. About two hundred veterans of the Revolution rode\r\nin carriages, and among them were forty survivors of the battle. Some\r\nwore their old uniform, others various decorations of their service,\r\nand some bore the scars of honorable wounds. Following the patriots\r\ncame the Monument Association, and then the Masonic fraternity to the\r\nnumber of thousands. Then came the noble Frenchman, Lafayette, the\r\nadmiration of all eyes. Following him were numerous societies with\r\nbanners and music. The head of the procession touched Charlestown\r\nBridge before the rear had left the State House, and the march was a\r\ncontinual ovation. Arriving at Breed's Hill, the Grand Master of the\r\nMasons, Lafayette, and the President of the Monument Association laid\r\nthe corner-stone, and then moved to the spacious amphitheatre on the\r\nnorthern side of the hill, where the address was delivered by Mr.\r\nWebster.\r\n\r\n[1]P. 122, l. 7. 1.

It is more compact, more picturesque, more vigorous, more\r\nfinished. In this field of oratory he probably has never had any equal\r\nin the English-speaking world.\r\n\r\nMr. Everett said of the Address: \"From such an orator as Mr. Webster,\r\non such a platform, on such a theme, in the flower of his age, and the\r\nmaturity of his faculties, discoursing upon an occasion of transcendent\r\ninterest, and kindling with the enthusiasm of the day and the spot, it\r\nmight well be regarded as an intellectual treat of the highest order.\r\nHappy the eyes that saw that most glorious gathering!

Up to this time\r\nWebster had opposed Protection, but now as the business of New England\r\nrequired assistance, he boldly stood forth as the champion of a\r\nProtective Tariff. It was in connection with the tariff legislation of\r\n1816, 1824, and 1828 that the monster Nullification--carefully\r\ndisguised until 1830--had its birth. In this year it was found stalking\r\nabroad, and in the halls of Congress menacing the bulwark of our\r\nliberties--the Constitution of the country. It fell to the lot of Mr.\r\nWebster to grapple with this monster and to strangle it in his giant\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of December, 1829, Senator Foot of Connecticut moved a\r\nresolution in regard to the Public Lands, and a long and weary\r\ndiscussion followed until Mr. Hayne, a Senator from South Carolina, on\r\nJune 19, 1830, took part and introduced a new element into the\r\ndiscussion by making an elaborate attack on the New England States. Mr.\r\nWebster had taken no special interest in the question, and on the day\r\nin which Mr. Hayne began his speech he was engaged in the Supreme\r\nCourt, but came into the Senate in season to hear the closing\r\nparagraphs. Thinking that such an attack upon New England required a\r\nreply, Mr. Webster at once rose, but yielded to a motion to adjourn. On\r\nthe next day, the 20th, Mr. Webster proceeded with his reply, in which\r\nhe showed the absurdity of Hayne's accusations and by which he\r\ncompletely shattered his whole elaborate argument. There was hardly an\r\nallusion in Mr. Webster's speech to the question of the tariff as it\r\nconcerned South Carolina, but so aroused was Hayne by Webster's defence\r\nof New England, that on the following day he spoke a second time and in\r\na tone of even greater severity and bitterness than that which marked\r\nhis previous speech; he indulged in personal allusion to Mr. Webster,\r\nand strove to bring odium upon him and the State which he represented;\r\nhe openly espoused the cause of Nullification and declared war upon the\r\ntariff. Before he concluded the Senate adjourned until the 25th, when\r\nhe completed his speech; Mr. Webster immediately rose to reply, but as\r\nit was late yielded to a motion to adjourn. Mr. Hayne's speech had\r\ncaused the greatest alarm throughout the North; many were afraid that\r\nit was unanswerable. This was an evidence that the true nature of the\r\nConstitution was not thoroughly understood. \"It is a critical moment,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Bell of New Hampshire to Mr. Webster on the morning of the\r\n26th, \"and it is time, it is high time, that the people of this country\r\nshould know what this Constitution _is_.\" \"Then,\" said Mr. Webster, \"by\r\nthe blessing of Heaven, they shall learn, this day, before the sun goes\r\ndown, what I understand it to be.\" With this utterance upon his lips,\r\nhe entered the Senate Chamber, which was already crowded. Every seat on\r\nthe floor and in the galleries was occupied; the House of\r\nRepresentatives was deserted; the lobbies and staircases were packed.\r\nThe vast audience was composed, on the one hand, of those who feared\r\nand trembled lest the rushing tide of hostility to the Constitution and\r\nthe Union should sweep over the country; and on the other, of those who\r\nbelieved that New England had no champion strong enough to stand in the\r\nbreach. This scene in the Senate Chamber is rivalled only by that in\r\nthe House of Commons, when Burke, in 1774, stood forth as the defender\r\nof the American colonies. Such was the anxiety to hear the speech that\r\nall the ordinary preliminaries of senatorial action were postponed, and\r\nMr. Webster began his \"Second Speech on Foot's Resolution,\" better\r\nknown as \"The Reply to Hayne.\"\r\n\r\n[1]P. 146, l. 10. 1. Mr. Webster rose with great calmness, and in the\r\nmajesty of that personal presence which could cause the English navvy\r\nto shout as he saw him, \"By Jove, there goes a king!\" with a confidence\r\nin his own resources which was the result of experience, in a clear,\r\ncalm, and firm tone pronounced this magnificent exordium which was such\r\na piece of consummate art that its effect was electric; all who feared,\r\nand all who hated, knew that he was master of the situation.\r\n\r\n[ 2] P. 147, l. 27. 1. When on the 21st Mr. Chambers asked that there\r\nbe a delay to enable Mr. Webster, who had engagements out of the house,\r\nto be present, Mr. Hayne was unwilling to grant the request, saying\r\nthat the gentleman (Mr. Webster) has discharged his fire in the\r\npresence of the Senate, and he wanted an opportunity to return it. Mr.\r\nWebster said, \"Let the discussion proceed: I am ready now to receive\r\nthe gentleman's fire.\"\r\n\r\n[3] P. 149, l. 8. 1. The notes, covering only five sheets of ordinary\r\nletter paper, from which Webster developed the entire speech of seventy\r\npages, contain no hint of the exordium, but begin with\r\n\r\n\"No man hurt. If his 'rankling' is relieved, glad of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no 'rankling' fear, anger, consciousness of refutation.\"\r\n\r\n\"No 'rankling,' original, or received--bow not strong enough.\"\r\n\r\n[4]L. 12. 2. Mr. Benton.\r\n\r\n[5]L. 27. 3. Mr. Webster's preparation for this reply lay in the nature\r\nof his thought and reading from his first entrance into public life,\r\nand especially from the nature of the constitutional questions which he\r\nhas argued before the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\n[6]P. 152, l. 1. 1. Should not this be \"_more_\"?\r\n\r\n[7]L. 24. 2. This was a political cry raised against President Adams,\r\nwho was elected by the House of Representatives. Clay had been a\r\ncandidate, and because Adams gave him a seat in his Cabinet, a cry went\r\nup that they had made a bargain, by which Mr. Clay's friends were to\r\nvote for Adams in the House, and in return Clay was to receive a\r\nCabinet position. This was a piece of political clap-trap. Cf.\r\n_American Politics_, Johnston, Ch. XI.\r\n\r\n[8]P. 155, l. 5. 1.

Eye, brow, each feature, every line of the face, seemed\r\ntouched as with celestial fire.... His voice penetrated every recess or\r\ncorner of the Senate,--penetrated even the anterooms and stairways.\"\r\nMr. Webster himself said: \"I never spoke in the presence of an audience\r\nso eager and so sympathetic.\" Mr. Everett says: \"Of the effectiveness\r\nof Mr. Webster's manner in many parts, it would be in vain to attempt\r\nto give any one not present the faintest idea. It has been my fortune\r\nto hear some of the ablest speeches of the greatest living orators on\r\nboth sides of the water, but I must confess I never heard anything\r\nwhich so completely realized my conception of what Demosthenes was when\r\nhe delivered the Oration for the Crown.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lodge in his excellent review of the speech says: \"The speech as a\r\nwhole has all the qualities which made Mr. Webster a great orator. An\r\nanalysis of the Reply to Hayne, therefore, gives us all the conditions\r\nnecessary to forming a correct idea of Mr. Webster's eloquence, of its\r\ncharacteristics, and its value.\" Cf. Ch. VI., _Webster_, American\r\nStatesman Series. This book should be a constant companion of the\r\nstudent while reading these selections.\r\n\r\nDr. Francis Lieber wrote: \"To test Webster's oratory, I read a portion\r\nof my favorite speeches of Demosthenes, and then read, always aloud,\r\nparts of Webster; then returned to the Athenian; and Webster stood the\r\ntest.\" As a result of this great effort, Mr. Webster was overwhelmed\r\nwith congratulations from all parts of the land. The speech was the\r\nuniversal theme of conversation, and there was a general demand for the\r\nprinted copy. Probably no speech in history has had so many readers as\r\nthe Reply to Hayne.\r\n\r\nCf. Healey's historical painting of the scene of this great debate, in\r\nFaneuil Hall; Curtis's _Life of Webster_, Ch. XVI.; Everett's _Memoir_,\r\nVol. I. of Webster's Works; _Correspondence of Webster_, Vol. I., p.\r\n488.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_THE MURDER OF CAPTAIN JOSEPH WHITE_.\r\n\r\nAugust, 1830.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the Reply to Hayne, Mr. Webster was engaged\r\nwith the Attorney-General of Massachusetts in one of the most\r\nremarkable criminal cases on record, and on August 3d made the argument\r\nin the trial of John Francis Knapp for the murder of Captain Joseph\r\nWhite.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the facts: On the night of the 6th of\r\nApril, 1830, the town of Salem was visited by a desperado who entered\r\nthe house of Joseph White, a wealthy and respectable citizen, and\r\nmurdered him in his bed. The citizens formed a vigilance committee and\r\nworked without avail until there came a rumor that a prisoner in the\r\nNew Bedford jail knew something of the affair. He was accordingly\r\nbrought up before the grand jury, and on his testimony Richard\r\nCrowningshield, of Danvers, was indicted. A few weeks later Captain\r\nJoseph Knapp, a shipmaster of good character, received a strange note\r\nfrom Belfast, Maine, which was signed by Charles Grant, Jr. This note\r\nthreatened exposure unless money was forwarded. Knapp could not\r\nunderstand it. He showed it to his sons, Francis and Joseph, Jr., who\r\nresided in Wenham. The wife of the latter was a niece of the late Mr.\r\nWhite, and was his housekeeper prior to the murder. When Joseph saw the\r\nletter he said it contained trash, and told his father to hand it to\r\nthe vigilance committee. When they received the letter they sent to\r\nBelfast to find the writer. This proved to be one Palmer, who had been\r\nin state prison and who was intimate with Crowningshield. He said he\r\nsaw, on the 2nd of April, Frank Knapp and a man, Allen, in company with\r\nCrowningshield, and that he heard the latter say that Frank Knapp\r\nwished them to kill Mr. White, and that Joseph Knapp would pay them one\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\nAfter the murder the Knapps reported that, on the 27th of April, they\r\nhad been attacked by robbers on their way from Salem to Wenham. The\r\npurpose of this will be seen in what follows. On the testimony of\r\nPalmer the Knapps were held for investigation, and on the third day\r\nJoseph made a full confession of the murder and of the fabrication of\r\nthe robbery story. He had found that Mr. White intended to leave his\r\n(Knapp's) wife but fifteen thousand dollars by will, and he thought\r\nthat if he died intestate she would come in for one-half of the estate,\r\nas the sole representative of Mr. White's sister. Under this impression\r\nhe determined to destroy the will. Frank agreed to hire the assassin,\r\nand he (Joseph) was to pay one thousand dollars for the deed.\r\nCrowningshield was hired; he entered the house by a window and\r\ncommitted the murder. So cool was he that, as he said, he paused to\r\nfeel the pulse of the old man to be sure he was dead. Frank was waiting\r\nthe issue, while Joseph, who had got the will, was in Wenham at his\r\nhome. When Crowningshield heard that the Knapps were in custody, and\r\nthat Joseph had confessed, he committed suicide in his cell.\r\n\r\nAt a special term of the Supreme Court at Salem, July 20th, indictments\r\nfor murder were found against Francis Knapp as principal, and Joseph\r\nKnapp and George Crowningshield (a companion of Richard) as\r\naccessories. The trial of Francis took place August 3d, with Mr.\r\nFranklin Dexter and Mr. W. H. Gardner for the defence, and Mr. Webster\r\nassisting the Attorney-General in the prosecution.\r\n\r\n[1]P. 239, l. 13. 1. Mr. Lodge says that this account of the murder and\r\nanalysis of the workings of a mind, haunted with the remembrance of the\r\nhorrid crime, must be placed among the very finest masterpieces of\r\nmodern oratory. \"I have studied this famous exordium,\" he says, \"with\r\nextreme care, and I have sought diligently in the works of all the\r\ngreat modern orators, and of some of the ancient as well, for similar\r\npassages of higher merit. My quest has been in vain.\"\r\n\r\n[2]P. 241, l. 23. 1. Mr. Webster's appearance for the prosecution gave\r\nrise to some complaints on the part of the defence, who intimated that\r\nhe was in the interest of Mr. Stephen White, a residuary legatee of the\r\nmurdered man. The fact was that both the Attorney-General and the\r\nSolicitor-General were old men, and had asked for Mr. Webster's\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n[3]P. 243, l. 20. 1. Chief Justice Parker.\r\n\r\n[4]P. 248, l. 10. 1. Mr. Webster's presentation of the evidence is\r\nomitted. Cf. Webster's Complete Works, Vol. VI., p. 61.\r\n\r\nKnapp was convicted as principal and sentenced to death. At the\r\nNovember term Joseph was convicted as accessory and sentenced to share\r\nthe same fate. George Crowningshield proved an _alibi_, and was\r\nacquitted. The argument in the Goodridge case stands in marked contrast\r\nto this; and it must be conceded that, as a presentation of the law and\r\nthe evidence, with no attempt to work upon the feelings of the jurymen,\r\nit is a work of higher quality. As a specimen of eloquence, of dramatic\r\nsetting forth of the horror of such a deed, of the experiences of the\r\ncriminal, and of the certainty that \"murder will out,\" the argument has\r\nno equal in the language.\r\n\r\nFor a remarkable analysis of Mr. Webster's career as a lawyer, see\r\nRufus Choate's address before the students of Dartmouth College in 1853\r\nin \"Memorial of Daniel Webster from the City of Boston.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_THE CONSTITUTION NOT A COMPACT_.\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1833.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster had intimated in his Reply to Hayne that South Carolina was\r\nplaying a high game. There were some at that time who thought that he\r\nhad sounded the note of alarm in too loud a strain; but when in\r\nNovember, 1832, the State Convention, assembled at Columbia, South\r\nCarolina, adopted an ordinance declaring the revenue laws of the United\r\nStates null and void, the voice of the croakers ceased to be heard in\r\nthe general excitement that filled the country. The Legislature\r\nassembled on the 27th, and the governor in his message said that \"the\r\ndie has been at last cast,\" and that the Legislature was called upon to\r\nmake \"such enactments as would make it utterly impossible to collect\r\nwithin our limits the duties imposed by the protective tariffs thus\r\nnullified.\" The Legislature passed acts providing that any one who\r\nshould attempt to collect the revenue should be punished, and made it\r\nlawful to use the military force of the State to resist any attempt of\r\nthe United States to enforce the tariff laws. Mr. Webster now had a\r\nvery difficult and delicate task before him; he was bound to criticise\r\nthe general tone of the administration of Jackson, for he believed that\r\nit had not met the needs of the country, and yet he was equally bound\r\nnot to put himself in such antagonism as to prevent him from aiding the\r\nadministration, should his aid be sought, against those who were\r\ndetermined to destroy the laws of the land. In the then impending\r\npresidental canvass he took the ground that President Jackson was in\r\nhostility to the idea of protection, and that therefore he could not be\r\nsafely trusted with the executive power. But President Jackson,\r\nwhatever had been his record on the question of the tariff, showed that\r\nhe had no desire to shirk his duty, for he at once issued a\r\nproclamation, which embodied the principles maintained by Mr. Webster\r\nin his Reply to Hayne, and warned the authorities of South Carolina\r\nthat all opposition to the laws of the United States would be put down.\r\nHe thus served notice that treason was not to win by default of the\r\nPresident. Calhoun had resigned the vice-presidency and had taken his\r\nseat in the Senate, and it was known that such an act meant the attempt\r\nto raise the flag of nullification high in the Senate-chamber.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was on his way to Washington when he heard of the prompt\r\nand decisive action of the President. At Philadelphia he met Mr. Clay,\r\nwho told him that he had a plan for settling the difficulty by\r\ngradually reducing the tariff, and for levying duties \"without regard\r\nto protection or encouragement of any branch of domestic industry.\"\r\nWhen Mr. Clay brought in his bill, it was not so strong as the one he\r\nhad submitted to Mr. Webster a short time before, but yet Mr. Webster\r\ncould not think of taking any step at such a time that would look like\r\nconcession. The first thing to be done was to enforce the existing laws\r\nand sustain the administration by suitable legislation. There was to be\r\nno surrender of constitutional power. At the opening of the session the\r\nPresident asked Congress for the power to use the land and naval forces\r\nif necessary to enforce the laws. The committee to which the message\r\nwas referred reported what is known as the \"Force Bill,\" which granted\r\nthe President the powers asked for. Some of the senators doubted that\r\nthe President had such \"daring effrontery\" as to ask for such power.\r\nMr. Webster said, \"I will tell you gentlemen that the President _has_\r\nhad the 'daring effrontery' to ask for these powers, no matter how high\r\nmay be the offence.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson had used very strong language against the leaders of\r\nNullification, and this made many of the (Southern) administration\r\nsenators hostile to the measures of the \"Force Bill.\" When it was found\r\nthat the President had called for the assistance of Mr. Webster, Mr.\r\nCalhoun became very uneasy, and at once sought for Mr. Clay, who\r\npromised to bring in his bill for reducing the tariff. On the 8th of\r\nFebruary, Mr. Clay introduced the measure and claimed that its purpose\r\nwas to save the tariff, which he considered to be in imminent danger.\r\nMr. Webster, as was expected, opposed the bill and introduced a series\r\nof resolutions. On the two following days he was prevented from\r\naddressing the Senate on his resolutions because of the discussion of\r\nthe \"Force Bill,\" when Mr. Calhoun took the opportunity to expound the\r\ntheory and practice of Nullification. The speech was in Mr. Calhoun's\r\nvery best style of close, logical argument, with but little that made\r\nfor eloquence. Calhoun was a master of logical method, and such was his\r\nskill in dovetailing together the elements of his speculations that he\r\nwas a powerful antagonist. He had waited until most of the senators in\r\nopposition had spoken and then broke upon them and tore their arguments\r\ninto shreds. It was an able supplement to the speech of Hayne and was\r\nlikely to produce quite as much alarm, unless its position could be\r\nturned. Here were sown the seeds of secession which grew into that\r\nfrightful civil war. By establishing the principle of the Union as but\r\na confederacy of States the right of secession was assured.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster felt the importance of the occasion; he saw clearly the\r\ndirection in which such appeals were sure to lead the people, and he at\r\nonce determined to throw himself into the conflict. The doctrines which\r\nhe had maintained in the Reply to Hayne had now taken strong hold of\r\nthe people of the Central and Western States, and of many of the\r\nstrongest public men of both parties; it was from this vantage ground\r\nthat (on the 16th) he began his great speech known as \"The Constitution\r\nnot a Compact between Sovereign States.\"\r\n\r\n[1]P. 275, l. 9. 1. Mr. Rives.\r\n\r\n[2]P. 326, l. 27. 1. \"The vital question went to the great popular\r\njury. The world knows what the verdict was, and will never forget that\r\nit was largely due to the splendid eloquence of Daniel Webster when he\r\ndefended the cause of nationality against the slave-holding separatists\r\nof South Carolina.\"--HENRY CABOT LODGE.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever,\" says Mr. Curtis, \"would understand that theory of the\r\nConstitution of the United States which regards it as the enactment of\r\na fundamental law must go to this speech to find the best and clearest\r\nexposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then and there,\" says Dr. Hudson, \"it was that real battles of the\r\nUnion were fought and won. For the cause had to be tried in the courts\r\nof legislative reason before it could come to trial on field of battle.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech is much less rhetorical than the Reply to Hayne. The\r\nsubject was not a new one, nor was the condition of the public mind so\r\nfeverish as in 1830; consequently the case required not so much an\r\nappeal to the emotions as to the reason. It has always been considered\r\nas the most compact, close, logical, and convincing of all Mr.\r\nWebster's speeches. The people have relied upon it from that day to\r\nthis to teach them the principles of the Constitution: in it they find\r\nthe origin, the history, and the purpose of our great national fabric.\r\nBy this speech Webster placed himself upon the highest pinnacle of\r\nfame, and added to his title of first orator that of the greatest\r\nstatesman of his time, winning the proud distinction of \"Expounder,\r\nCommentator, and Defender of the Constitution.\" On the 12th of October,\r\n1835, the citizens of Boston presented to Mr. Webster a massive silver\r\nvase in testimony of their gratitude for his services in defence of the\r\nConstitution against South Carolina Nullification.\r\n\r\nIt contained the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n            PRESENTED TO\r\n           DANIEL WEBSTER,\r\n   The Defender of the Constitution,\r\n     BY THE CITIZENS OF BOSTON,\r\n           Oct. 12, 1835.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the address of presentation Mr. Webster said:--\r\n\r\n\"In one respect, Gentlemen, your present oppresses me. It assigns to me\r\na character of which I feel I am not worthy. 'The Defender of the\r\nConstitution' is a title quite too high for me. He who shall prove\r\nhimself the ablest among the able men of the country, he who shall\r\nserve it longest among those who may serve it long, he on whose labors\r\nall the stars of benignant fortune shall shed their selectest\r\ninfluence, will have praise enough, and reward enough, if, at the end\r\nof his political and earthly career, though that career may have been\r\nas bright as the track of the sun across the sky, the marble under\r\nwhich he sleeps, and that much better record, the grateful breasts of\r\nhis living countrymen, shall pronounce him 'the Defender of the\r\nConstitution.' It is enough for me, Gentlemen, to be connected, in the\r\nmost humble manner, with the defence and maintenance of this great\r\nwonder of modern times, and this certain wonder of all future times. It\r\nis enough for me to stand in the ranks, and only to be counted as one\r\nof its defenders.\"\r\n\r\nCf. Curtis's _Life of Webster_, Ch. XIX.; Lodge's _Webster_, Ch. VII.;\r\nAddress of Dr. Hudson on the Hundredth Anniversary of the Birth of\r\nDaniel Webster, June 18, 1882.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_SPEECH AT SARATOGA_.\r\n\r\nAugust, 1840.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster had been in almost continual public service since 1813, and\r\nduring that period the two great questions which demanded the attention\r\nof statesmen were the tariff and the currency. The history of the\r\nformer is to be found in the Reply to Hayne and the Reply to Calhoun;\r\nthe history of the latter, in that memorable series of speeches during\r\nthe session of 1831-1833 on the policy of President Jackson regarding\r\nthe United States Bank. Out of this great controversy the Whig party\r\narose, and its first nominee for the presidency was William Henry\r\nHarrison in 1835, but the friends of Jackson were strong, and Van Buren\r\nwas elected. He continued the financial policy of his predecessor, or\r\nat least made no effort to remedy the evils which it had brought upon\r\nthe country. Mr. Webster gave himself to the task of exposing the\r\nfinancial heresies of the administration and of preventing further\r\ninjurious legislation. In the summer of 1839 he visited England for\r\nrest, and was everywhere received with the honor due to his high\r\nposition and his distinguished attainments; he received courtesies\r\nusually confined to ambassadors and foreign ministers. On his return he\r\nfound that the Whigs had again nominated Harrison. Although he had\r\nreason to expect his own nomination, for this was the desire of _the\r\npeople_, he at once threw himself into the campaign in support of the\r\nnominee. The people from all sections of the country wished to hear and\r\nsee the man who had done such noble service for them in Congress. His\r\nspeeches during this campaign are a fit supplement to those which he\r\nhad just completed on the subject of the bank. The theme was\r\nessentially the same, but the audience was in many respects a more\r\ndifficult one to reach. In the familiarity with financial questions Mr.\r\nWebster had shown himself second only to Hamilton himself, and in\r\npresenting the subject to a popular audience he reached the high-water\r\nmark of political oratory; there is no cant, no bluster, no personal\r\nabuse, but the dignity and simplicity of the simple and dignified\r\nfriend of the people.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of August, 1840, he addressed the citizens of New York in a\r\nmass meeting at Saratoga. Of all the great speeches of this campaign\r\nthis best represents the mind and art of Mr. Webster, and is especially\r\ninteresting in this year (1892) when essentially the same\r\nquestions--the tariff and the currency--are before the people, and when\r\nthe nominee of the party, which is the child of the old Whig party, is\r\nBenjamin Harrison.\r\n\r\n[1]P. 331, l. 28. 1. The history of banking in the United States is\r\ninteresting as a chapter in the general history of banking. It began\r\nwith that great financier, Alexander Hamilton. When Secretary of the\r\nTreasury he conceived the plan of a great national bank, which should\r\ntake charge of the disbursement of the revenues, and which should\r\nfurnish a paper circulation,--founded on national resources,--which\r\nshould be current all over the country. After a prolonged opposition by\r\nthe Anti-federalists, who claimed that the establishment of such a bank\r\nwould be unconstitutional, he prevailed upon Washington to sign the\r\nbill of incorporation, and in 1791 the bank began its work. It\r\ncontinued its existence until 1811, when the Anti-federalists refused\r\nto recharter it. Owing to the disordered currency resulting from the\r\nWar of 1812, Mr. Madison brought the matter before Congress in his\r\nmessage, and in 1816 the second Bank of the United States was\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n[2]P. 333, l. 27. 1. Cf. Sumner's _Life of Andrew Jackson_, Chs. XIII.,\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n[3]P. 334, l. 20. 1. In the session of 1831-1832 the bank applied for a\r\nnew charter, and here began the great struggle with President Jackson.\r\nThe bill to recharter the bank passed both Houses in 1832, and was\r\nvetoed by the President. Mr. Webster made a notable speech against the\r\nveto, and at once took the lead as an authority on questions of\r\nfinance. The following year the President struck his hardest blow\r\nagainst the bank, by ordering the removal of the deposits. The Senate\r\npassed resolutions condemning the act, and Mr. Webster, on presenting\r\nresolutions to the same effect from Boston, made a most powerful speech\r\nin which he depicted the great commercial distress resulting from the\r\nremoval and from the institution of State banks. Between the time of\r\nthis speech and the close of the session he spoke on the subject of the\r\nbank and national finance over sixty times. No other such exhibition of\r\nintellectual power and grasp of intricate problems, united with\r\ncommanding eloquence, has ever been made in our history. As a result of\r\nthe censure by the Senate, the President sent a protest in which he\r\nargued that the Senate had exceeded its power. Mr. Webster replied to\r\nthis in what is now considered the greatest of all his speeches during\r\nthe great struggle.\r\n\r\n[4]P. 335, l. 26. 1. After the removal of the deposits, effected by\r\nJackson, State banks were formed in large numbers, and certain of these\r\nbecame deposit banks. The notes of State banks were used for the\r\npurchase of public lands from the United States, and the treasury was\r\nthus accumulating paper currency of doubtful value. The Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury (1836) issued the so-called \"Specie Circular,\" ordering\r\nthe government agents to receive in future only gold and silver. Only\r\nthose banks which held government revenue deposits could furnish coin,\r\nand widespread bankruptcy was the result.\r\n\r\n[5]P. 337, l. 17. 1. Cf. Gay's _Life of James Madison_.\r\n\r\n[6]P. 339, l. 9, 1. Jackson had never questioned the right of the\r\ngovernment to regulate the currency, but had asserted it when he made\r\ncertain State banks banks of deposit. Van Buren was obliged either to\r\nreturn to the policy of a national bank, or to renounce all rights of\r\nthe Government to regulate the currency. He chose the latter, and by\r\nmeans of the \"Sub-Treasury Scheme\" completed the separation of \"bank\r\nand State.\" The speech of Mr. Webster on the \"Sub-Treasury\" is the most\r\ncomplete and convincing of all his speeches on the right of the\r\nGovernment to regulate the currency.\r\n\r\n[7]P. 346, l. 24. 1. Mr. Webster was living at this time at Marshfield,\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nCf. Curtis's _Life of Webster_, Chs. XIX.-XXIII.; Lodge's _Webster_,\r\nCh. VII.; _Works of Daniel Webster_, Vols. III., IV.; _Private\r\nCorrespondence of Daniel Webster_, Vol. II., p. 83.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_MR. JUSTICE STORY_.\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1845.\r\n\r\nOf the many friends of Webster during his long political career, there\r\nwas no one more constant in his attentions, more sympathetic in his\r\njudgments, or more helpful in his counsels than was Mr. Justice Story.\r\nEver since they had acted together in the Massachusetts Convention in\r\n1820 they had maintained for each other's character and attainments the\r\nmost generous and cordial enthusiasm. The death of Mr. Story on the\r\n10th of September, 1845, was a great affliction to Mr. Webster, and\r\ncast a gloom over his Marshfield home, where they had passed so many\r\ndelightful hours together.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Suffolk Bar held in the Circuit Court Room, on the\r\nmorning of the 12th of September, the day of the funeral, Chief Justice\r\nShaw having taken the chair and announced the object of the meeting,\r\nMr. Webster pronounced the following noble and beautiful eulogium.\r\n\r\nThe following letter of dedication to the mother of Judge Story\r\naccompanied these remarks in the original edition:--\r\n\r\n\"BOSTON, September 15, 1845.\r\n\r\n\"Venerable Madam,--I pray you to allow me to present to you the brief\r\nremarks which I made before the Suffolk Bar, on the 12 instant, at a\r\nmeeting occasioned by the sudden and afflicting death of your\r\ndistinguished son. I trust, dear Madam, that as you enjoyed through his\r\nwhole life constant proofs of his profound respect and ardent filial\r\naffection, so you may yet live long to enjoy the remembrance of his\r\nvirtue and his exalted reputation.\r\n\r\n\"I am with very great regard, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"DANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n\"To Madam Story.\"\r\n\r\n[1]P. 358, l. 28. 1. Cf. _Life and Works of Judge Story_.\r\n\r\n[2]P. 362, l. 10. 1. The following inscription, which Mr. Webster wrote\r\nwith his own hand a short time before his death, and which he desired\r\nto have placed on his monument, is interesting in connection with these\r\nclosing words of the eulogy:--\r\n\r\n                  \"LORD, I BELIEVE; HELP THOU\r\n                        MINE UNBELIEF.\"\r\n\r\n                         Philosophical\r\n                      argument, especially\r\n                that drawn from the vastness of\r\n             the Universe, in comparison with the\r\n       apparent insignificance of this globe, has some-\r\n     times shaken my reason for the faith which is in me;\r\n  but my heart has always assured and reassured me, that the\r\n     Gospel of Jesus Christ must be a Divine Reality. The\r\n         Sermon on the Mount cannot be a merely human\r\n            production. This belief enters into the\r\n                   very depth of my conscience.\r\n                     The whole history of man\r\n                             proves it.\r\n\r\n                                                        DANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nWhen he wrote the above, he said to a friend: \"If I get well and write\r\na book on Christianity, about which we have talked, we can attend more\r\nfully to this matter; but if I should be taken away suddenly, I do not\r\nwish to leave any duty of this kind unperformed. I want to leave\r\nsomewhere a declaration of my belief in Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not Mr. Webster's custom to make a parade of his religious\r\nbeliefs; he was simple, sincere, and unaffected in his religious life.\r\nThat he was a lover and student of our English Bible, no one familiar\r\nwith his thought and style needs to be told. Mr. Choate, in speaking of\r\nWebster's models in the matter of style, mentions Cicero, Virgil, our\r\nEnglish Bible, Shakespeare, Addison, and Burke.\r\n\r\nFor the latest estimates of Webster's work the student should consult\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\nThe Proceedings of the Webster Centennial, Dartmouth College (1902).\r\n\r\nAddress of Hon.
